 INTENDED USE AND LEVEL
Electrical Wiring—Industrial is intended for use in industrial wiring courses at two-year 
community and technical colleges. The text walks the reader step by step through an indus-
trial building, providing the basics on installing industrial wiring systems. An accompany-
ing set of plans at the back of the book allows the student to proceed step by step through 
the wiring process by applying concepts learned in each chapter to an actual industrial 
building, in order to understand and meet requirements set forth by the National Electrical 
Code® (NEC®).
 SUBJECT AND APPROACH
The fifteenth edition of Electrical Wiring—Industrial is based on the 2014 NEC. The NEC is 
used as the basic standard for the layout and construction of electrical systems. To gain the 
greatest benefit from this text, the learner must use the NEC on a continuing basis.
In addition to the NEC, the instructor should provide the learner with 
 applicable state and local wiring regulations as they may affect the indus-
trial installation.
In addition to the accurate interpretation of the requirements of the NEC, the successful 
completion of any wiring installation requires the electrician to have a thorough understand-
ing of basic electrical principles, a knowledge of the tools and materials used in installations, 
familiarity with commonly installed equipment and the specific wiring requirements of the 
equipment, the ability to interpret electrical construction drawings, and a constant awareness 
of safe wiring practices.
Electrical Wiring—Industrial builds upon the knowledge and experience gained from 
working with the other texts in the Delmar Cengage Learning electrical wiring series and 
related titles. The basic skills developed through previous applications are now directed 
to industrial installations. The industrial electrician is responsible for the installation of 
electrical service, power, lighting, and special systems in new construction; the change-
over from old systems to new in established industrial buildings; the provision of addi-
tional electrical capacity to meet the growth requirements of an industrial building; and 
periodic maintenance and repair of the various systems and components in the building.

PREFACE
 FEATURES
An introduction to plans and sitework is the topic 
of the first chapter in the book, providing expla-
nations of identifying symbols and interpreting 
the plans in order to help orient the student to the 
industrial job site. Examples are integrated into 
the text and take the student step by step through 
problems, to illustrate how to derive solutions 
using newly introduced mathematical formulas 
and calculations. Industrial building drawings are 
included in the back of the book, offering students 
the opportunity to apply the concepts that they 
have learned in each chapter as they step through 
the wiring process. Review questions at the end of 
each chapter allow students to test what they have 
learned and to target any sections that require fur-
ther review.

This edition of Electrical Wiring—Industrial 
was completed after all normal steps of revis-
ing the NEC NFPA 70 were taken and before 
the actual issuance and publication of the 2014 
edition of the NEC. These steps include the fol-
lowing:
• The National Fire Protection Association 
(NFPA) solicits proposals for the 2014 NEC.
• Interested parties submit proposals to the 
NFPA.
• Proposals are sent to Code-Making Panels 
(CMPs).
• CMPs and the Technical Correlating 
Committee review proposals.
• Report on Proposals document is published.
• Interested parties submit comments on the 
proposals to the NFPA.
• CMPs and Technical Correlating Committee 
review comments.
• Report on comments document is published.
• Review of all Proposals and Comments is 
conducted at the NFPA Annual Meeting.
• New motions are permitted to be made at the 
NFPA Annual Meeting.
• Finally, the Standard Council meets to review 
actions made at the NFPA Annual Meeting 
and to authorize publication of the NEC.
Every effort has been made to be technically 
correct, but there is the possibility of typographi-
cal errors or appeals made to the NFPA board 
of directors after the normal review process that 
could result in reversal of previous decisions by 
the CMPs.
If changes in the NEC do occur after the 
printing of this book, these changes will be incor-
porated in the next printing.
The NFPA has a standard procedure to intro-
duce changes between Code cycles after the 
actual NEC is printed. These are called Tentative 
Interim Amendments, or TIAs. TIAs and cor-
rected typographical errors can be downloaded 
from the NFPA website, http://www.nfpa.org, to 
make your copy of the Code current.

CHAPTER 1  Plans and Sitework
ensure that the installations have the proper cover 
after the final grading. The responsibility of who 
does the ditch-work (general contractor or electri-
cian) is usually agreed upon before the contract is 
awarded.
Figure 1-1 gives the standard symbols used on 
construction site plans for contour lines and other 
features.
Benchmark
The benchmark (BM), as given on the site plan, 
is the reference point from which all elevations are 
located. The benchmark elevation is established by 
the surveyor responsible for the preliminary survey 
of the industrial site. This BM elevation is related to 
a city datum or to the mean sea level value for the 
site. The elevation is usually given in feet and tenths 
of a foot. For example, an elevation of 123.4 ft is 
read as “one hundred twenty-three and four-tenths 
feet.” Table 1-1 is used in making conversions from 
tenths of a foot to inches.
Elevations
The electrician must give careful attention to the 
elevations of the proposed building. These details 
are shown on Sheet Z-1 of the enclosed plans for the 
industrial building. These drawings provide valuable 
information concerning the building construction. 
Measurements on the elevations may be a plus or a 
minus reference to the BM elevation as given on the 
site plan.
Invert Elevation (INV)
When an invert elevation (INV) is given, this 
quantity indicates the level of the lower edge of 
the inside of a conduit entering the manhole (this 
conduit is usually the lower one in an installation). 
Refer ahead to Figure 1-19.
Site Plan Scales
Residential site plans generally are drawn to the 
same scale as is used on the building plans; that is, 1⁄8

 CONSTRUCTION 
PLANS
An electrician who has previously wired a resi-
dence or a commercial building is familiar with 
electrical floor plans and symbols. Although the 
electrical plans and symbols are basically simi-
lar for an industrial building project, additional 
emphasis is often placed on the sitework. The 
electrician must continually coordinate and work 
with the general foreman who is employed by the 
general contractor.
After the contract for the project is awarded, 
the electrical contractor must inspect the site plans 
to determine the approximate location of the indus-
trial building on the site, as well as the locations of 
underground wiring, raceways, and manholes. The 
contractor then moves a trailer to the site and locates 
it so that it will require a minimal amount of reloca-
tion during construction. This trailer is used to store 
materials and tools during the construction of the 
building.
Building Location
The building location is given on the site plan 
by referring to existing points such as the center-
line of a street. If the electrical contractor and the 
crew arrive on the site before the general contractor 
arrives, they are not required to “stake out” (locate) 
the building. However, they should be able to deter-
mine its approximate location. A site plan, such as 
the one given on Sheet Z-1 of the industrial build-
ing plans included in this text, shows the property 
lines and the centerlines of the street from which 
the electrician can locate the building and other site 
improvements.

plans typically use scales ranging from 1==  20= and 
1==  30= up to 1==  60=. It is recommended that the 
electrician use a special measuring device, called a 
scale, to measure the site plans, Figure 1-2.
 SITEWORK
There may be requirements for several different 
types of electrical systems to be installed on the site 
apart from the building itself. The electrician should 
review the plans and specifications carefully to be 
aware of all requirements. It is then the responsibil-
ity of the electrical contractor/electrician to ensure 
that these requirements are met and that installations 
are made at the most advantageous time and in a 
fashion that will not conflict with sitework being 
carried out by other trades.
 TESTING THE SITE 
FOR GROUNDING 
REQUIREMENTS
When determining the site for a building, one of the 
most important considerations is the system ground. 
Proper grounding helps protect against transient cur-
rents, electrical noise, and lightning strikes. Several 
methods can be used to test the electrical grounding 
system. The effectiveness of the grounding system 
greatly depends on the resistivity of the earth at the 
location of the system ground. The resistivity of the 
earth varies greatly throughout the world and even 
within small areas. Many factors affect the earth’s 
resistivity such as soil type (clay, shell, sand, etc.), 
moisture content, electrolyte content (acids, salts, 
etc.), and temperature.
In theory, the system ground is considered to 
have a resistance of zero because it is connected to 
system grounds everywhere, via the neutral conduc-
tor, Figure 1-3. In actual practice, however, the cur-
rent carrying capacity of the grounding system can 
vary greatly from one area to another.
Testing
There are different methods for determining the 
resistivity of the grounding system. An old method 
used by electricians for many years is to connect a 
100-watt lamp between the ungrounded (hot) con-
ductor and the grounding conductor, Figure 1-4. To 
perform this test, the grounding conductor must be 
disconnected from the neutral bus in the panel. The 
brightness of the lamp gives an indication of the 
effectiveness of the grounding system. Although this

test indicates whether the grounding system works, it 
does not indicate the actual resistance of the system. 
To measure the actual resistance of the grounding 
system requires the use of special equipment such as 
a ground resistance tester, Figure 1-5. There are three 
main tests used to measure ground resistance: the 
Wenner four-point test, the three-point fall-of-poten-
tial test, and the clamp-on ground resistance test.
The Wenner Four-Point Method
The Wenner four-point test is generally performed 
before building construction begins. This method 
measures the ground resistance over a wide area. The 
results are used in designing the grounding system to 
ensure that it performs properly. This test requires the 
use of a 4-pole ground resistance meter, four metal 
rods, and conductors. The four rods are driven into 
the ground in a straight line, with equal space between 
each rod, Figure 1-6. To perform this test, the ground 
resistance tester produces a known amount of current 
between rods C1 and C2, producing a voltage drop 
across rods P1 and P2. The amount of voltage drop 
is proportional to the amount of current and ground 
resistance. Readings are generally taken with probes 
C1 and C2 spaced 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, and 
100 feet apart. If possible, it is recommended to per-
form the test with the probes spaced 150 feet apart.
The calculated soil resistance is the average of the 
soil resistance from the surface to a depth equal to the 
space between the probes. If the probes are set 30 feet 
apart, for example, each probe will provide an average 
resistance measurement from the surface to a depth 
of 30 feet. The tests should not only be made with the

CHAPTER 1  Plans and Sitework
probes spaced different distances apart but also with 
the probes in different directions from a central point. 
If the site is large enough, it is generally recommended 
to perform the test along at least two sides, generally 
from one corner to the other. It should be noted that 
underground structures such as metal water pipes 
can influence the readings. The best results will be 
obtained by gathering as much data as possible.
Three-Point Fall-of-Potential Test
The fall-of-potential test requires the use of a 
ground resistance meter. It is performed after the 
installation of the grounding system and should be 
done annually to ensure the quality of the grounding 
system. Annual testing provides protection against 
the degradation of the system before damage to 
equipment and performance problems occur.
In the three-point fall-of-potential test, the three 
points of ground contact are
 1. the system ground (grounding rod) (point A);
 2. a current probe placed some distance from the 
grounding rod (point B); and
 3. a voltage probe that is inserted at various dis-
tances between the grounding rod and the cur-
rent probe (C). The voltage probe is placed in 
a straight line between the grounding rod and 
the current probe.
Ideally, the current probe (B) should be placed at 
a distance that is at least 10 times the length of the 
grounding rod (A), Figure 1-7. If the grounding 
rod is 8 feet in length, the current probe should be 
placed at least 80 feet from the grounding rod.
To perform this test, the grounding rod must be dis-
connected (electrically isolated) from the neutral bus 
in the service panel. Failure to do so will completely 
invalidate the test. The meter provides a known amount 
of current that flows from the current probe and back 
to the meter through the system grounding rod. The 
resistance of the earth causes a voltage drop that is 
measured between the current probe and the voltage 
probe. The amount of voltage drop is proportional to 
the amount of current flow and the ground resistance. 
Resistance readings should be taken at several loca-
tions by moving the voltage probe a distance equal to 
10% of the distance between the system grounding 
rod and the current probe. If performed properly, the

the effective resistance of the entire grounding 
system.
 4. Because this test is performed by a clamp-on 
meter, there are no connections that have to 
be broken or reconnected, resulting in a safer 
procedure, Figure 1-8.
The clamp-on ground resistance tester, Figure 1-9, 
contains two transformers. One transformer induces 
a small fixed voltage at approximately 2 kHz on the 
grounding conductor. If a path exists, the voltage will 
result in a current flow. The path is provided by the 
grounding system under test, the utility neutral, and 
the utility grounding system. The second transformer 
inside the meter senses the amount of current at the 
unique frequency provided by the first transformer. 
The amount of current is proportional to the induced 
voltage and the resistance of the grounding system. 
The meter uses the two known electrical quantities to 
calculate the resistance of the grounding system.
three-point ground resistance test is the most accurate 
method of determining ground resistance.
The Clamp-On Ground 
Resistance Test
The clamp-on ground resistance test requires the 
use of a special clamp-on ground resistance meter. 
This test has several advantages over the three-point 
fall-of-potential test.
 1. The service grounding system does not have to 
be disconnected and isolated from the neutral 
bus.
 2. There are no probes that have to be driven into 
the ground or long connecting conductors.
 3. The neutral conductor supplied by the utility 
company ties innumerable grounds together in 
parallel. The clamp-on ground tester measures

back down to 13.8 kV at a unit substation. The plant 
substation steps the voltage down to 480 volts to 
feed the plant bus system. Other 3-phase and single-
phase transformers are powered by the plant bus. A 
battery backup system is used by an uninterruptable 
power supply. All of these different power systems 
and voltages are connected together via ground-
ing conductors. Grounding is also used to protect 
against lightning, static electricity, and the influence 
of high frequency. It should be noted, however, that 
the grounding requirements listed in the National 
Electrical Code are intended for direct current and 
60-hertz AC systems. These requirements may not 
provide an effective ground for high frequency. 
Alternating current systems are subject to skin 
effect, which is the tendency of electrons to move 
toward the surface of a conductor, Figure 1-11.
The higher the frequency, the greater the skin 
effect. At a frequency of 10 MHz, a 6 AWG cop-
per conductor may exhibit a resistance of several 
thousand ohms. High-frequency circuits must be 
grounded with a conductor that contains a large sur-
face area, such as braided cable or wide copper tape.
Safety
Besides providing a common point of connection 
for different systems and voltages, grounding plays 
Grounding and Bonding 
Considerations
Many technicians and electricians pay little 
attention to grounding and know only the basic 
requirements specified by the National Electrical 
Code. However, grounding is one of the most 
important parts of any electrical installation. Proper 
grounding protects circuits and equipment from 
destruction and personnel from injury. Grounding is 
generally thought of as connecting a system to earth 
via a grounding electrode, as shown in Figure 1-8. In 
reality, grounding is connecting a circuit to a com-
mon point of reference. Almost all grounded systems 
are connected to earth, which is a common point of 
reference, but the earth generally does not provide 
the low-impedance path necessary to protect against 
ground-fault currents. NEC 250.4(A)(5) states, The 
earth shall not be considered an effective ground-
fault current path.
Grounding not only provides a low-impedance 
path for fault currents, but it also provides a com-
mon point of reference for different electrical sys-
tems and voltages, Figure 1-10. A low-impedance 
path exists from the alternator supplying power to 
the last device connected to the circuit. The alterna-
tor has an output of 13.8 kV, which is stepped up 
to 138 kV for transmission. The voltage is stepped

CHAPTER 1  Plans and Sitework
The phase current will be 13.85 A (277/20). 
Because the stator windings are connected in wye, 
the line current will be the same as the phase cur-
rent. Now assume that one of the phase windings 
develops a shorted winding to ground. If only part of 
the winding is shorted, the motor may still operate 
with an increase of current on two of the lines, and 
the current may not be sufficient to cause the circuit 
breaker to open, Figure 1-13.
If the case of the motor is not grounded, there is 
no complete circuit for current flow, which causes 
the case of the motor to exhibit a voltage of approxi-
mately 277 volts to ground. Anyone touching the 
motor is in danger of electrocution. The resistance of 
the human body can vary from as low as 500 ohms 
to as high as 600,000 ohms. Assume that a person 
touching the motor has a resistance of 1000 ohms 
to ground. That would produce a current flow of 
approximately 277 mA, which is about three times 
the amount necessary to cause death.
If the motor is properly grounded, Figure 1-14, 
the grounding conductor will provide a very low-
impedance path to ground. The low-impedance 
a large part in the safety of equipment and personal. 
When the grounding system is properly installed 
and maintained, it provides a low-impedance path to 
ground. A common saying among people in the elec-
trical trades is that current follows the path of least 
resistance. There is some truth to that idea, but it is 
not the whole truth. Current will behave in the man-
ner dictated by Ohm’s law. Assume that a 3-phase, 
480-volt motor is protected by a 30-ampere circuit 
breaker. Also assume that the stator windings have 
an impedance of 20 ohms. If the stator windings are 
connected in wye, Figure 1-12, each winding will 
have an applied voltage of 277 volts (480/1.732).

to move toward the surface of the conductor. This

bonding of equipment. Bonding jumpers are lengths 
of wire used to connect the equipment to the ground-
ing system. Some examples of where bonding jump-
ers are required are around impaired connections 
such as reducing washers or oversized, concentric, 
or eccentric knockouts. Metallic boxes, raceways, 
cable trays, cable sheath, armored cable, metal water 
pipes, and exposed parts of metal buildings are also 
required to be bonded, Figure 1-15.
 INTERPRETING THE 
SITE PLAN
Notations that do not normally appear on a site plan 
have been added to plan Z1 of the plans located in 
the back of the text. These notations are aids used to 
locate specific spots on the plan. The notations are 
grounding conductor forces the motor case to exist at 
ground potential, and the shock hazard is eliminated. 
Also, the current path to ground will very likely 
cause enough current flow for the circuit breaker to 
open. It should be noted that grounding conductors 
should be installed in the same conduit as circuit con-
ductors; otherwise, the impedance of the grounding 
conductor may increase due to inductance.
Bonding
Bonding is used to connect the metal parts of 
equipment or building structure to the grounding 
system. The NEC states that Bonding shall be pro-
vided where necessary to ensure electrical conti-
nuity and the capacity to conduct safely any fault 
current likely to be imposed. Article 250 of the 
NEC lists the requirements and specifications for the

duit up the pole to the point of connection. The con-
duit is then sealed with a special telephone fitting 
or with a compound known as gunk. A long sweep 
conduit elbow or quarter bend is installed at the base 
of the pole. At the lowest point of this fitting, a small 
V-groove is cut or a 3⁄8 in. (9.5 mm) hole is drilled 
for moisture drainage. This drainage hole is known 
as a weep hole. A small dry well is then constructed 
below the weep hole and is filled with rocks. A pull 
wire (fish wire) is installed in the raceway from the 
pole to the junction box at the point where it enters 
the building. In general, 12-gauge galvanized wire 
is used as the fish wire, but a nylon string will do as 
well.
Direct Burial Wiring
The electrician may have a choice of several 
methods of installing underground wiring. The 
selection of the method to be used depends on the 
type of materials available and whether provisions 
are to be made for replacing the conductors. If direct 
burial cable is used, Figure 1-17, care must be taken 
to protect the cable from damage. For example, the 
cable can be installed in the ground to a greater 
depth than that at which normal digging takes place. 
Added protection is obtained by placing a treated 
board over the cable to provide a shield against dig-
ging and probing near the cable. The cable should 
also be surrounded by a layer of sand to prevent 
any abrasion of the cable by sharp stones and other 
objects in the soil.
Underground Raceways
Although underground raceways are more 
expensive to install, they provide many advantages 
that direct burial installations do not, such as permit-
ting the removal of the original conductors and/or the 
installation of new conductors with higher current or 
voltage ratings. Underground raceways are available 
in a number of different materials, including rigid 
metal conduit and rigid nonmetallic conduit.
Rigid metal conduit can be installed directly 
in the soil if (300.5 and 300.6 of the National 
Electrical Code [NEC]):
• ferrous conduits (iron or steel) do not rely 
solely on enamel for corrosion protection;
identified by an asterisk followed by a number such 
as *1, *2, and so on.
Refer to the Composite Site Plan. Note the 
benchmark located in the southeast quadrant of the 
plan. This is the point at which the surveyor began 
measuring the elevations seen on the plan. Notice 
that some of the elevation lines have crossing hash 
marks. The hash marks indicate that that section of 
the elevation is to be changed. Locate the contour 
lines for 748 and 749. Parts of these lines have 
crossing hash marks and parts do not. Only the sec-
tions denoted with hash marks are to be changed.
The new elevations are shown with dark heavy 
lines. These dark heavy lines are shown to connect 
at some point with the existing contour lines. The 
elevation of the connecting contour line indicates 
what the new elevation is intended to be. At position 
*1, located in the upper southwest quadrant, a heavy 
dark line connects with the 749 elevation line. The 
area indicated by the new contour line is to be 749. 
Locate the new contour line connecting with the 749 
contour line at *2. Trace this line to the point where it 
intersects with the layout of the building. Notice that 
the entire building is positioned in an area marked by 
these two new contour lines. This indicates that the 
building site is to be changed to a uniform 749 ft in 
preparation for pouring the concrete slab.
New spot elevations are used to indicate an 
elevation different from that marked by the plot 
plan. For example, locate the new contour line at *3. 
This new contour line connects to the 747 contour 
line. Now locate the new spot elevation at position 
*4. The arrow points to the curb inlet drain. The curb 
inlet drain is located in an area that is indicated to be 
747 ft. The new spot elevation, however, shows that 
the curb inlet drain is to be 0.3 ft (90 mm) lower than 
the surrounding area.
Telephone Service
Telephone service is provided by conduit that 
runs from the telephone pole. The conduit runs 
underground at a minimum depth of 18 in. (450 mm) 
and then is run up the telephone pole for a distance 
of 8 ft (2.5 m), Figure 1-16. A temporary standard 
pole cap is installed to protect the equipment from 
water until the cables are pulled in. The telephone 
company later removes this cap and extends the con-

conduit must be encased in not less than 2 in. 
(50 mm) of concrete.
NEC Article 344 gives the installation require-
ments for rigid metal conduit and NEC Article 352 
covers rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit type PVC.
The minimum requirements for the installation 
of conduit and cables underground are given in NEC 
Table 300.5. The general installation requirements 
are as follows.
For direct burial cables:
• the minimum burial depth is 24 in. (600 mm);
• where necessary, additional protection is to 
be provided, such as sand, running boards, or 
sleeves;
• a residential exception permits cable burial to a 
depth of only 12 in. (300 mm) with GFCI pro-
tection; NEC Table 300.5, column 4.
For rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit type PVC:
• the minimum burial depth is 18 in. (450 mm);
• a 12 in. (300 mm) burial depth is permitted if a 
2 in. (50 mm) concrete cover is provided over 
conduit;
from contacting sodium chloride (salt) mixtures. 
Concrete mixes often use such mixtures to lower 
the freezing temperature of the green concrete. The 
chemical reaction between the aluminum and the salt 
may cause the concrete to fracture or spall (chip or 
fragment). When protection is desired or required for 
the type of raceway used, concrete is poured around 
the conduit, as shown in Figure 1-18, with at least 
2 in. (50 mm) of cover in compliance with NEC Table 
300.5.
The use of rigid polyvinyl chloride conduit type 
PVC is covered in NEC Article 352. These conduits 
may be used:
• concealed in walls, floors, and ceilings;
• under cinder fill;
• in locations subject to severe corrosive conditions;
• in dry and damp locations;
• exposed where not subject to physical damage; 
and
• underground.

at a potential higher than 600 volts, the nonmetallic

ber and size of raceways and conductors that are to 
be installed. The drain is an important part of the 
installation because it removes moisture and allows 
the manhole to remain relatively dry. If a storm sewer 
is not available for drainage, the installation of a dry 
well is an alternate choice.
Lighting Standards
Most types of area lighting standards require 
the installation of a concrete base, Figure 1-20. The 
manufacturer of the lighting standard should provide 
a template for the placement of the anchor bolts. If 
• a 24 in. (600 mm) burial depth is required in

For rigid conduit:

areas subjected to heavy vehicular traffic.

English (U.S. Customary) values, but this is chang-
ing. Manufacturers are now showing both inch-
pound and metric dimensions in their catalogs. Plans 
and specifications for governmental new construc-
tion and renovation projects started after January 1, 
1994, have been using the metric system. You may 
not feel comfortable with metrics, but metrics are 
here to stay. You might just as well get familiar with 
the metric system.
Some common measurements of length in the 
English (Customary) system are shown with their 
metric (SI) equivalents in Table 1-2.
The NEC and other National Fire Protection 
Association (NFPA) Standards are becoming inter-
national standards. All measurements in the 2014 
NEC are shown with metrics first, followed by the 
inch-pound value in parentheses—for example, 600 
mm (24 in.).
In Electrical Wiring—Industrial, ease in 
understanding is of utmost importance. Therefore, 
inch-pound values are shown first, followed by 
metric values in parentheses—for example, 24 in. 
(600 mm).
the manufacturer fails to provide a template for the 
placement of anchor bolts, the electrician should 
supply the general contractor with the template. 
The conduit installed in the base should be supplied 
with bushings on the ends to protect the cables. It 
is important that proper grounding be achieved at 
each lighting standard. A grounding conductor shall 
be installed with the supply conductors as the earth 
cannot be the sole grounding path; see 250.54. This 
section also permits the installation of supplemen-
tary grounding electrodes as shown in Figure 1-20. 
It is mandatory that all conductive parts, includ-
ing the grounding electrode, base, bolts, and con-
duits, be bonded together to achieve comprehensive 
grounding. See 250.2, 250.134, and 250.54.

A hard metric measurement is where a prod-
uct has been designed to SI metric dimensions. No 
conversion from inch-pound measurement units is 
involved. A hard conversion is where an existing 
product is redesigned into a new size.
In the 2014 edition of the NEC, existing inch-
pound dimensions did not change. Metric conver-
sions were made, then rounded off. Please note that 
when comparing calculations made by both English 
and metric systems, slight differences will occur as 
a result of the conversion method used. These differ-
ences are not significant, and calculations for both 
systems are therefore valid. Where rounding off 
would create a safety hazard, the metric conversions 
are mathematically identical.
For example, if a dimension is required to 
be 6  ft, it is shown in the NEC as 1.8 m (6 ft). 
Note that the 6 ft remains the same, and the met-
ric value of 1.83 m has been rounded off to 1.8 
m. This edition of Electrical Wiring—Industrial 
reflects these rounded-off changes. In this text, 
the inch-pound measurement is shown first—for 
example, 6 ft (1.8 m).
Trade Sizes
A unique situation exists. Strange as it may 
seem, what electricians have been referring to for 
years has not been correct!
Raceway sizes have always been an approxima-
tion. For example, there has never been a 1⁄2 in. race-
way! Measurements taken from the NEC for a few 
types of raceways are shown in Table 1-3.

CHAPTER 1  Plans and Sitework
Outlet boxes and device boxes use their nomi-
nal measurement as their trade size. For example, a 
4 in.  4 in.  11⁄2 in. does not have an internal cubic-
inch area of 4 in.  4 in.  11⁄2 in.  24 cubic inches. 
Table 314.16(A) shows this size box as having an 
area of 21 in.3 This table shows trade sizes in two 
columns—millimeters and inches.
Table 1-6 provides the detailed dimensions of 
some typical sizes of outlet and device boxes in both 
metric and English units.
In practice, a square outlet box is referred to as 
4  4  11⁄2-inch square box, 4>  4>  11⁄2> square 
box, or trade size 4  4  11⁄2 square box. Similarly, 
a single-gang device box might be referred to as a 
3  2  3-inch device box, a 3>  2>  3>-deep 
device box, or a trade size 3  2  3 device box. 
The box type should always follow the trade size 
numbers.
Trade sizes for construction material will not 
change. A 2  4 is really a name, not an actual 
dimension. A 2  4 stud will still be referred to as a 
2  4 stud. This is its trade size.
In this text, measurements directly related to the 
NEC are given in both inch-pound and metric units. 
In many instances, only the inch-pound units are 
shown. This is particularly true for the examples of 
raceway calculations, box fill calculations, and load 
calculations for square foot areas, and on the plans 
(drawings). To show both English and metric mea-
surements on a plan would certainly be confusing 
and would really clutter up the plans, making them 
difficult to read.
Because the NEC rounded off most metric con-
version values, a calculation using metrics results 
in a different answer when compared with the same 
You can readily see that the cross-sectional areas, 
critical when determining conductor fill, are different. 
It makes sense to refer to conduit, raceway, and tub-
ing sizes as trade sizes. The NEC in 90.9(C)(1) states 
that where the actual measured size of a product is 
not the same as the nominal size, trade size desig-
nators shall be used rather than dimensions. Trade 
practices shall be followed in all cases. This edition 
of Electrical Wiring—Industrial uses the term trade 
size when referring to conduits, raceways, and tubing. 
For example, instead of 1⁄2 in. electrical metal tubing 
(EMT), it is referred to as trade size 1⁄2 EMT.
The NEC also uses the term metric designa-
tor. A 1⁄2 in. EMT is shown as metric designator 
16 (1⁄2). A 1 in. EMT is shown as metric designa-
tor 27 (1). The numbers 16 and 27 are the metric 
designator values. The (1⁄2) and (1) are the trade 
sizes. The metric designator is the raceways’ 
inside diameter—in rounded-off millimeters 
(mm). Table 1-4 shows some of the more common 
sizes of conduit, raceways, and tubing. A com-
plete table is found in the NEC, Table 300.1(C). 
Because of possible confusion, this text uses only 
the term trade size when referring to conduit and 
raceway sizes.
Conduit knockouts in boxes do not measure up 
to what we call them. Table 1-5 shows trade size 
knockouts and their actual measurements.

calculation done using inch-pounds. For example, 
load calculations for a residence are based on 3 
volt-amperes per square foot or 33 volt-amperes per 
square meter.
For a 40 ft  50 ft dwelling:
3 VA  40 ft  50 ft  6000 volt-amperes.
In metrics, using the rounded-off values in the 
NEC:
33 VA  12 m  15 m  5940 volt-amperes.
The difference is small, but nevertheless, there is a 
difference.
To show calculations in both units throughout 
this text would be very difficult to understand and 
would take up too much space. Calculations in 
either metrics or inch-pounds are in compliance 
with 90.9(D). In 90.9(C)(3) we find that metric units 
are not required if the industry practice is to use 
inch-pound units.
It is interesting to note that the examples in 
Chapter 9 of the NEC use inch-pound units, not 
metrics.

to the unit, such as kilo-, forms the new name kilo-
watt, meaning 1000 watts. Refer to Table 1-7 for 
prefixes used in the numerical systems.
Certain prefixes shown in Table 1-7 have a pref-
erence in usage. These prefixes are mega-, kilo-, the 
unit itself, centi-, milli-, micro-, and nano-. Consider 
that the basic metric unit is a meter (one). Therefore, 
a kilometer is 1000 meters, a centimeter is 0.01 
meter, and a millimeter is 0.001 meter.
The advantage of the SI metric system is that 
recognizing the meaning of the proper prefix lessens 
the possibility of confusion.
In this text, when writing numbers, the names 
are often spelled in full, but when used in calcula-
tions, they are abbreviated. For example: m for 
meter, mm for millimeter, in. for inch, and ft for 
foot. It is interesting to note that the abbreviation 
for inch is followed by a period (12 in.), but the 
abbreviation for foot is not followed by a period 
(6 ft). Why? Because ft. is the abbreviation for 
fort.
 SUMMARY
As time passes, there is no doubt that metrics will be 
commonly used in this country. In the meantime, we 
need to take it slow and easy. The transition will take 
time. Table 1-8 shows useful conversion factors for 
converting English units to metric units.
Guide to Metric Usage
The metric system is a base-10 or decimal 
system in that values can be easily multiplied or 
divided by 10 or powers of 10. The metric system 
as we know it today is known as the International 
System of Units (SI) derived from the French term le 
Système International d’Unités.
In the United States, it is the practice to use 
a period as the decimal marker and a comma to 
separate a string of numbers into groups of three 
for easier reading. In many countries, the comma 
has been used in lieu of the decimal marker, and 
spaces are left to separate a string of numbers into 
groups of three. The SI system, taking something 
from both, uses the period as the decimal marker 
and the space to separate a string of numbers into 
groups of three, starting from the decimal point 
and counting in either direction. For example, 
12345.789 99. An exception to this is when there 
are four numbers on either side of the decimal 
point. In this case, the third and fourth numbers 
from the decimal point are not separated. For 
example, 2015.1415.
In the metric system, the units increase or 
decrease in multiples of 10,100,1000, and so on. For 
instance, one megawatt (1,000,000 watts) is 1000 
times greater than one kilowatt (1000 watts).
By assigning a name to a measurement, such as 
a watt, the name becomes the unit. Adding a prefix

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation 
25
Utility companies generally supply 3-phase power 
to industrial customers. The requirements of the 
industrial location determine the type of service-
entrance connection, voltage, and current capacity. 
To understand the difference between single-phase 
and 3-phase power, imagine a single-phase winding 
and a rotating magnetic field, Figure 2-1.
The rotating magnet produces a single sine 
wave. Three-phase power is produced by plac-
ing three different phase windings 120° apart. The 
rotating magnetic field produces three separate sine 
waves 120° apart, Figure 2-2.
There are two major types of 3-phase connec-
tions: the wye, or star, and the delta. The wye con-
nection is made by connecting one end of each phase 
winding together at a central point, Figure 2-3.
In this example, it is assumed that the finish end 
of each phase winding is connected together. The 
start end of each winding is the point of connection 
to the outside circuit. Schematically, the connection 
looks like the letter Y or a three-point star.
The delta connection is formed by connecting 
the finish end of a winding to the start end of another 
winding, Figure 2-4.
If the connection is drawn schematically, it 
looks like the Greek letter delta (Δ). Each of these 
connections exhibits different characteristics. Three-
phase connections have two different values for 
voltage and current. One is the line-to-line value, 
generally called the line value, and the other is the 
phase value. In the wye connection, the line volt-
age and line-current values are the values associated 
with the connected lines. The phase values of volt-
age and current are the values associated with each 
individual phase winding, Figure 2-5.
In a wye connection, the phase voltage is less 
than the line voltage by a factor of the square root 
of 3. In the example shown, a wye-connected load 
is supplied by a 208-volt, 3-phase power source.

Power companies commonly supply high-voltage 
service to large commercial or industrial buildings 
and complexes. The customer owns the step-down 
transformers, metering, and switching equipment 
necessary to supply the low-voltage loads. This 
equipment is housed in a unit substation, Figure 2-7. 
The unit substation consists of three compartments: 
the high-voltage section, the transformer section, 
and the low-voltage section.
 THE HIGH-VOLTAGE 
SECTION
The Pothead
The high-voltage section must include a means 
by which the incoming line can be terminated. A 
device called a pothead provides a reliable method 
of terminating a high-voltage cable, Figure 2-7 and 
Figure 2-8. To connect the incoming lead-covered 
cable at the pothead, the cable is opened and the 
conductors are bared for several inches. The wiping 
sleeve of the pothead is cut off until the opening is 
the correct size to receive the cable. The cable is then 
inserted until the lead sheath is inside the sleeve. 
The voltage across each phase winding, however, is 
120 volts.

is 17.32 amperes. The phase current is only 10 amperes.

The following steps are then completed in the order 
given: (1) The cable conductors are connected to the 
terminals at the end of the porcelain insulators; (2) the 
lead cable is wiped (soldered) to the wiping sleeve; 
and (3) the pothead is filled with a protective and 
insulating compound (usually made from an asphalt 
or resin base). The pothead installation is now ready 
for the external connections. Several precautions 
should be observed when the pothead is filled with 
the selected compound. First, the correct compound 
is heated to a specified temperature (usually between 
250°F and 450°F). The pothead is then filled accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. Extreme care 
must be taken to ensure that voids do not occur within 
the pothead where moisture can accumulate.
Lightning Arresters
Lightning arresters, Figure 2-9, are installed 
on buildings in areas where lightning storms are 
common. These devices are designed to provide a 
low-impedance path to ground for any surge cur-
rents such as those resulting from a lightning strike. 
Surge arresters installed in accordance with the 
requirements of NEC Article 280 shall be installed 
on each ungrounded overhead service conduc-
tor. See 230.209. The internal components of the 
arrester vary according to the type of arrester and 
the specific application. The electrician must ensure 
that a good ground connection is made to the 
arrester.
TIP: If the transformer section of the unit sub-
station is to be given a megohmmeter test, the 
line connection to the arrester must be discon-
nected during the test to prevent a false ground 
reading. z

High-Voltage, Current-Limiting 
Fuses
High-voltage, current-limiting fuses are installed 
as protective devices in power distribution systems 
such as the one installed in the industrial building. 
The selection of the proper fuse is based on several 
factors, including the continuous current rating, 
voltage rating, frequency rating, interrupt rating, 
and coordination. The fuse selected for a particular 
installation must meet the predetermined voltage 
and frequency requirements listed. Fuses are avail-
able for both 25- and 60-hertz systems and for volt-
age ratings of 2400 volts and up, Figure 2-10.
Continuous Current Rating
High-voltage fuses are available with either an 
N or an E rating. These ratings indicate that certain 
standards established by the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronic Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) and National

transformer;
• select a fuse with a continuous current rating of 
1.6 times the continuous current rating of the 
transformer;
• select a fuse that complies with NEC Article 
450.
 TRANSFORMER 
PROTECTION
In general, fuses are selected for high-voltage pro-
tection because they are less expensive than other 
types of protection, are extremely reliable, and 
do not require as much maintenance as do circuit 
breakers. The protection will be further enhanced 
if the protective device has the proper interrupt 
rating.
The minimum interrupt rating permitted for a 
fuse in a specific installation is the maximum sym-
metrical fault current available at the fuse location. 
Power companies will provide the information 
when requested and will recommend a fuse rating in 
excess of this value.
 OVERCURRENT 
PROTECTION
Interrupt Rating
As stated earlier, the maximum rating of over-
current devices for transformers rated at 1000 volts 
or higher is set forth in NEC Table 450.3(A). To use 
this table, the percent impedance (%Z) of the trans-
former must be known. This value is stamped on the 
nameplate of transformers rated 25 kVA and larger. 
See 450.11. The actual impedance of a transformer 
is determined by its physical construction, such as 
the gauge of the wire in the winding, the number of 
turns, the type of core material, and the magnetic 
efficiency of the core construction. Percent imped-
ance is an empirical value that can be used to predict 
transformer performance. It is common practice to 
use the symbol %Z to represent the percent imped-
ance. Percentages must be converted to a decimal 
form before they can be used in a mathematical 
formula.
Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) have 
been met. The N rating represents an older set of 
standards and indicates that a cable-type fuse link 
will open in less than 300 seconds at a load of 220% 
of its rated current.
An E-type fuse rated at 100 amperes or less will 
open in 300 seconds at a current of 200% to 240% of 
its rating. Above 100 amperes, an E-rated fuse will open 
in 600 seconds at a current of 220 to 264% of its rated 
current. The electrician should note, however, that an 
E-rated fuse does not provide protection in the range of 
one to two times the continuous load current rating.
The selection of the fuse with the correct contin-
uous current rating to provide transformer protection 
is based on the following recommendations:
• select a fuse with the lowest rating that has 
a minimum melting time of 0.1 second at

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation
EXAMPLE
Assume that the transformer shown in 
Figure 2-11 is a 2400/480-volt, 15 kVA 
transformer. To determine the impedance of the 
transformer, first calculate the full-load current 
rating of the secondary winding. Given the trans-
former rating in VA, and the secondary voltage E, 
the secondary current I can be calculated:
I  VA
E   15,000
480   31.25 amperes
Next, increase the source voltage connected to 
the high-voltage winding until there is a current 
of 31.25 amperes in the low-voltage winding. For 
the purpose of this example, assume that voltage 
When this conversion has been made, the sym-
bol •Z will be used to represent the decimal imped-
ance, that is, the percent impedance in decimal form. 
The percent value is converted to a numerical value 
by moving the decimal point two places to the left; 
thus, 5.75% becomes 0.0575. This value has no 
units, as it represents a ratio.
When working with any transformer, it is impor-
tant to keep in mind the full meaning of the terms 
primary and secondary and high-voltage and low-
voltage. The primary is the winding that is con-
nected to a voltage source; the secondary is the 
winding that is connected to an electrical load. The 
source may be connected to either the low-voltage 
or the high-voltage terminals of the transformer. 
If a person inadvertently connects a high-voltage 
source to the low-voltage terminals, the transformer 
would increase the voltage by the ratio of the turns. 
A 600-volt to 200-volt transformer would become a 
600-volt to 1800-volt transformer if the connections 
were reversed. This would not only create a very 
dangerous situation but could also result in perma-
nent damage to the transformer because of excessive 
current flow in the winding. Always be careful when 
working with transformers, and never touch a termi-
nal unless the power source has been disconnected.
The percent impedance is measured by con-
necting an ammeter across the low-voltage ter-
minals and a variable voltage source across the 
high-voltage terminals. This arrangement is shown 
in Figure 2-11. The connection of the ammeter is 
short-circuiting the secondary of the transformer. 
An ammeter should be chosen that has a scale with 
about twice the range of the value to be measured 
so that the reading will be taken in the middle of 
the range. If the current to be measured is expected 
to be about 30 amperes, a meter with a 0- to 
60-ampere range would be ideal. Using a meter 
with a range under 40 amperes or over 100 amperes 
may not permit an accurate reading.
After the connections have been made, the volt-
age is increased until the ammeter indicates the 
rated full-load current of the secondary (low-voltage 
winding). The value of the source voltage is then 
used to calculate the decimal impedance (•Z). The 
•Z is found by determining the ratio of the source 
voltage as compared to the rated voltage of the high-
voltage winding.

 DETERMINING 
TRANSFORMER FUSE 
SIZE
The transformer impedance value is also used to 
determine the fuse size for the primary and second-
ary windings. It will be assumed that the transformer 
shown in Figure 2-11 is a step-down transformer 
and the 2400-volt winding is used as the primary 
and the 480-volt winding is used as the secondary. 
NEC Table 450.3(A) indicates that the fuse size for 
a primary over 1000 volts and having an impedance 
of 6% or less is 300% of the rated current. The rated 
current for the primary winding in this example is
 I  15,000
2400
  6.25 amperes
The fuse size will be
6.25  3.00  18.75 amperes
NEC Table 450.3(A) Note 1 permits the next higher 
fuse rating to be used if the calculated value does 
not correspond to one of the standard fuse sizes 
listed in 240.6. The next higher standard fuse size is 
20 amperes.
NEC Table 450.3(A) indicates that if the second-
ary voltage is 1000 volts or less, the fuse size will be 
value to be 138 volts. Finally, determine the 
ratio of source voltage as compared to the rated 
voltage.

To change the decimal value to %Z, move the 
decimal point two places to the right and add a

decimal value by 100.
%Z  5.75%
Transformer impedance is a major factor in 
determining the amount of voltage drop a 
transformer will exhibit between no load and 
full load and in determining the current in a 
short-circuit condition. When the transformer 
impedance is known, it is possible to calculate 
the maximum possible short-circuit current. 
This would be a worst-case scenario, and the 
available short-circuit current would decrease as 
the length of the connecting wires increases the 
impedance. The following formulas can be used 
to calculate the short-circuit current value when 
the transformer impedance is known.

This equation is not an application of Ohm’s law 
because decimal impedance is not measured 
in ohms. The purpose of the equation is to 
determine the current in a circuit when the 
transformer capacity (volt-amperes) and the 
percent impedance are given.

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation
overcurrent protective device that is not rated more 
than 250% of the primary current.
EXAMPLE
Assume that a transformer is rated 
480/120 volts, and the secondary winding 
is protected with a fuse that is not greater than 
125% of its rated current. Now assume that 
the rated primary current of this transformer is 
8 amperes. If the feeder supplying the primary of 
the transformer is protected with an overcurrent 
protective device rated at 20 amperes or less 
(8  2.50  20), the primary of the transformer 
does not require separate overcurrent protection, 
Figure 2-13. The Code further states in 450.3(B) 
that if the transformer is rated at 1000 volts 
or less and has been provided with a thermal 
overload device in the primary winding by the 
manufacturer, no further primary protection is 
required if the feeder overcurrent protective 
device is not greater than six times the primary 
current for a transformer with a rated impedance 
of not more than 6%, and not more than four 
times the primary rated current for a transformer 
with a rated impedance greater than 6% but not 
more than 10%.
set at 125% of the rated secondary current. In this 
example, the fuse size will be
31.25  1.25  39.06 amperes
A 40-ampere fuse will be used as the secondary 
short-circuit protective device, Figure 2-12.
Transformers Rated 1000 Volts or 
Less
Fuse protection for transformers rated 1000 volts 
or less is stipulated by 450.3(B). If the rated primary 
current is less than 9 amperes, the overcurrent protec-
tive device can be set at not more than 167% of this 
value. If the primary current is less than 2 amperes, 
the short-circuit protective device can be set at not 
more than 300% of this value.
Notice that if the primary current is 9 amperes or 
more, it is permissible to increase the fuse size to the 
next highest standard rating. If the primary current is 
less than 9 amperes, the next lowest fuse size must 
be used.
NEC 450.3(B) addresses only transformers that 
have short-circuit protection in both the primary 
and secondary windings. If the secondary winding 
is protected with an overcurrent protective device 
that is not rated more than 125% of the rated sec-
ondary current, the primary winding does not have 
to be provided with separate overcurrent protection 
if the feeder it is connected to is protected with an

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation

EXAMPLE
Assume that a transformer has a 
primary winding rated at 240 volts and 
is provided with a thermal overload device 
by the manufacturer. Also assume that the 
primary has a rated current of 3 amperes and 
an impedance of 4%. To determine whether 
separate overcurrent protection is needed for 
the primary, multiply the rated primary current 
[NEC Table 450.3(B), Note 3] by 6 (3  6  
18 amperes). If the branch-circuit protective 
device supplying power to the transformer 
primary has an overcurrent protective device 
rated at 18 amperes or less, no additional 
protection is required. If the branch-circuit 
overcurrent protective device is calculated 
greater than 18 amperes, a separate 
overcurrent protective device for the primary 
is required.
If separate overcurrent protection is required, 
it is calculated at 167% of the primary current 
rating because the primary current is less than 
9 amperes but greater than 2 amperes. In this 
example, the primary overcurrent protective 
device should be rated at
3  1.67  5.01 amperes
A 5-ampere fuse would be used to provide 
primary overcurrent protection.
Coordination
Coordination is the process of selecting pro-
tective devices so that there is a minimum of 
power interruption in case of a fault or overload. 
In other words, for a particular situation, a value 
of high-voltage fuse should be selected that 
ensures that other protective devices between it 
and the loads can react to a given condition in less 
time.
Coordination studies require that the time-
current characteristic of the different protective 
devices be compared and that the selection of the 
proper devices be made accordingly. Problems in 
the coordination of high-voltage fusing occur most 
frequently when
 1. circuit breakers are used as secondary protec-
tive devices, and
 2. a single main protective device is installed on 
the secondary side of the transformer.
 THE TRANSFORMER 
SECTION
There is little difference between the transformer 
in a unit substation and any other power trans-
former (see the connection diagram in Figure 2-14). 
However, the topic of transformer taps should be 
explained in some detail.
Taps
Although voltage systems are generally clas-
sified by a voltage value, such as a 2300-volt or 
a 4160-volt system, this exact value is rarely the 
voltage provided at the transformer. To compen-
sate for this probable voltage difference, taps 
are built into the transformer, Figure 2-15. These 
taps are usually provided at 2½% increments 
above and below the standard rated voltage. For 
example, taps on a 4160/480-volt transformer may 
provide for voltages of 3952, 4056, 4160, 4264, 
and 4368 volts. Connections at the proper voltage 
levels will provide the desired 480 volts on the 
secondary.
 THE LOW-VOLTAGE 
SECTION
After the incoming voltage is reduced to the 
desired value, it is taken by busbars into the 
low-voltage section. Here, protective devices 
are installed to distribute the voltage throughout 
the area to be served. Numerous variations in 
the arrangements of these devices are possible 
depending upon the needs of the installation. A 
main device can be installed to interrupt the total 
power, or any combination of main and feeder 
devices can be used.

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation

grounded is made by the utility company. The gen-
eral rule, however, is to ground the wye system as 
shown in this figure. The grounding of the second-
ary system is optional when the system is a 480-volt 
delta-connected type, according to 250.26(4). If the 
phase is grounded, then special attention should 
be given to 240.22. This section says that if fuses 
are used for overcurrent protection, they should be 
installed only in the ungrounded conductors.
An alternative to grounding the secondary 
is to let it float; that is, the secondary remains 
ungrounded. If this design is selected, ground 
detectors should be installed, Figure 2-16, to detect 
any unintentional system grounding. See 250.21(B). 
It should be noted that if a conductor makes con-
tact with ground at any point, the entire system is 
grounded. However, such a ground may not be an 
effective ground connection, and serious equipment 
damage may result when a second ground connec-
tion occurs on another phase.
The ground detector system in Figure 2-16 
consists of three lamps connected as shown. The 
lamps used have the same voltage ratings as for 
the line-to-line voltage. The lamps light dimly 
when there are no grounded conductors. If any 
phase becomes grounded, however, the lamp con-
nected to that phase dims even more or goes out 
entirely, whereas the other two lamps become 
brighter. Thus, a quick visual check by mainte-
nance personnel can determine whether a ground 
has developed. Ground detectors are shown on 
the riser diagram on Sheet E-1 of the plans for the 
industrial building.
Grounding
The majority of the connections to ground are 
made in the low-voltage section. However, the 
electrician should be aware that a grounding bus 
usually runs the entire length of the unit substa-
tion. This bus provides the means for a positive 
ground connection between the compartments, as 
well as a convenient place to make other ground 
connections. Two types of grounding connections 
are of special interest. The system grounding con-
nection is used to connect a phase or the neutral of 
the transformer secondary to ground. This ground-
ing electrode conductor is sized according to NEC 
250.66 and Table 250.66.
The second grounding connection of special 
interest is the connection of all the incoming metal 
raceways to the grounding system. There are no 
problems in grounding when the raceways enter the 
substation through the metal structure. However, 
when a raceway enters through the base of the unit, 
a grounding connection must be installed between 
the conduit and the grounding system. This con-
ductor is sized according to NEC 250.122 and 
Table 250.122.
Ground Detectors
A careful inspection of Figure 2-14 reveals that 
there are two grounding connections, one on the 
center tap of the 3-phase wye, high-voltage connec-
tion and another to X2 on the 3-phase delta second-
ary. The decision as to whether the high side is to be

 nipples. Connections between the current and poten-
tial transformers in the high-voltage section of 
the unit substation and the autotransformer and 
meter sockets in the cabinet are made with size 
12  American Wire Gauge (AWG) wire. The auto-
transformer is designed to provide voltage com-
ponents of the proper magnitude and at the correct 
phase angles to the potential coils of the reactive 
meter (to be described shortly). These voltage 
components are 90° out of phase with the line 
voltage. The left-hand meter socket is wired to 
receive a standard socket-type watt-hour meter that 
measures active kilowatt hours. The right-hand 
meter socket will receive a reactive var-hour (volt-
amperes- reactive) meter, Figure 2-18. This second 
meter measures reactive kilovar-hours.
The two meters are provided with 15-minute 
demand attachments. The local power company 
furnishes these meters, which are installed by power 
 THE HIGH-VOLTAGE 
METERING EQUIPMENT
The specifications for the industrial building indi-
cate that to provide for energy use measurements, 
two 3⁄4-inch conduits must be run from the high-
voltage section of the unit substation to a cabinet 
located in a caged section of the loading platform 
behind the unit substation, Figure 2-17. Current and 
potential transformers located in the high-voltage 
section (4160 volts) are an integral part of the sub-
station as assembled at the factory. (The ratio of the 
potential transformers is 40:1, and the ratio of the 
current transformers is 400:1.) The metering cabinet 
is provided with meter test blocks and an instrument 
autotransformer.
A double 3-phase meter socket trough must be 
installed above the metering cabinet. This socket 
trough is connected to the cabinet with conduit

ments are taken on the high-voltage side of the 
transformer. Both of these conditions for preferen-
tial rates are present in the industrial installation 
being considered in this text.
If the power factor is unity (1.00), it is evident 
that the reactive meter (var-hour meter) indicating 
disk is stationary. However, if the power factor falls 
below unity, then the var-hour meter disk will rotate 
in one direction for a lagging current and in the 
opposite direction for a leading current.
In the industrial building, two 350-kVAR synchro-
nous condensers furnish leading current as desired to 
raise and correct the power factor. (Synchronous con-
densers are described in Chapter 10.) Simple adjust-
ments of these machines minimize the kVAR-hours, 
as registered on the reactive meter.
 SERVICE ENTRANCES
Page E1 of the plans indicates that the incoming 
power for this installation is a wye-delta 3-phase 
transformer rated at 1500 kVA. The transformer pri-
mary is protected by 300 A fuses. The drawing is a 
one-line diagram that shows the feeder busways and 
company personnel. The meters each have two 
elements and maximum ratings of 150 volts and 
5 amperes. The two demand attachments (not shown) 
register the demand in kilowatts and kilovars for the 
respective meters if the demand is sustained for a 
period of more than 15 minutes at any one time.
Industrial Power Rates
The rates charged by the power company for 
the energy used are based on the readings of the 
meter registers and the maximum demand indi-
cators. Some power companies charge a penalty 
if the power factor falls below a certain level, as 
indicated in the example shown in Figure 2-18, 
Note 3. Assume that the reactive meter reading is 
one-half the kilowatt-hour reading. Thus, the tan-
gent of the phase angle is 5⁄10, or 0.5, and the cosine 
of the phase angle is 0.9. As a result, no penalty is 
imposed by the power company because the power 
factor is 90%.
Preferential rates are given when the power 
transformer is owned by the customer. Further rate 
reductions are made when the metering measure-

amount of power are generally supplied by a pad-
mounted, 3-phase transformer, Figure 2-23.
Three-phase transformers have an advantage 
in that they are more efficient than a 3-phase 
bank composed of single-phase transformers. 
A 3-phase transformer contains three separate 
transformers that share the same core material, 
which improves the magnetic coupling among 
the transformers. Common output voltages for 
a delta-connected secondary are 240 volts and 
480 volts. Some installations may use a voltage of 
560 volts, but they not as common as the 240- or 
480-volt connections.
Although the wye-delta transformer connection 
used in this installation is very common in industry, 
it is not the only connection employed for industrial 
and commercial applications.
Grounded Delta Connection
Another common industrial connection is the 
grounded delta connection. This connection is referred 
to as the B phase ground system because the B phase 
of the delta secondary is grounded, Figure 2-24.
Grounding one phase of the transformer does 
reduce problems with transient voltages and makes 
troubleshooting simpler because there is a true ref-
erence to ground. B phase ground systems can be 
identified by the fact that only two fuses are required 
power supplies throughout the building. One-line 
diagrams are a very common method used for this 
application. The unit substation is drawn as shown 
in Figure 2-19.
A wiring diagram of this installation would 
show a 3-phase fused disconnect, a 3-phase trans-
former bank, a 1000 A circuit breaker with discon-

circuit breaker with disconnect that protects feeder

Most 3-phase transformer connections have a 
delta connection as either the primary or second-
ary. The delta connection stabilizes the voltage in 
the event of an unbalanced condition. A schematic 
diagram of the unit substation connection is shown 
in Figure 2-21.
This connection is often referred to as a float-
ing delta connection because it is not grounded. 
Although floating delta connections are common, 
they can experience some unpredictable voltage 
transients relative to ground. These transients can 
cause insulation failure and other concerns.
Installations that do not require a large kVA 
capacity are generally supplied by pole-mounted, 
single-phase transformers that are connected to form 
a 3-phase bank, Figure 2-22.
Connections of this type have an advantage in 
that if one transformer fails, only one transformer 
has to be replaced. Installations that require a large

Open Delta Connection
Open delta connections are used for installa-
tions that do not have a large kVA requirement. 
The advantage of the open delta connection is that 
it requires only two transformers to supply 3-phase

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation
Open Delta Connection with 
Ground
Open delta connections often ground the center 
tap of one transformer, Figure 2-26.
This connection is used when the installation 
requires both single-phase and 3-phase power. 
The output voltage is generally 240 volts between 
phases. The center tap of one transformer is 
grounded to provide a neutral conductor. This 
connection is referred to as a high-leg connection, 
because the voltage between the neutral conductor 
and the phase conductor of the transformer that was 
not center tapped is 208 volts (120 volts  1.732 
[square root of 3]). The voltage between the neutral 
and the phase conductors of the transformer that is 
center tapped is 120 volts. Because one transformer 
must supply all the single-phase load and part of 
the 3-phase load it must have a larger kVA capacity 
than the transformer that does not supply any of the 
single-phase load. This connection can be identified 
by the fact that one transformer will be larger than 
the other, Figure 2-27.
Assume that a business requires 50 kVA of 
single-phase load and 30 kVA of 3-phase load. 
First determine the minimum size transformers that 
would supply the 3-phase load.
 30,000 VA/0.866  34,642 VA
 34,642 VA/2  17,321 VA
Each transformer must have a minimum capac-
ity of 17,321 to supply the needed 3-phase load. One 
transformer, however, must also supply the entire 
single-phase load.
17,321  50,000  67,321 VA
Although only two transformers are required for 
the connection, they must have a larger kVA capacity 
than a closed delta connection with three transform-
ers. For example, if an installation required a total 
kVA capacity of 600 kVA, the three transformers of 
a closed delta connection would need a capacity of 
200 kVA each (200 kVA  3  600 kVA). An open 
delta connection can supply only 86.6% of the total 
capacity of the two transformers. Therefore, the total 
kVA capacity of the two transformers would need to 
be 692.8 kVA (600 kVA/0.866  692.8 kVA). Each 
transformer would need a minimum kVA capacity 
of 346.4 kVA (692.8 kVA/2  346.4 kVA). As with 
closed delta connections, common output voltages 
for the open delta connection are 240 and 480 volts.

Another common voltage for the grounded 
wye is 480/277. A voltage of 480 volts exists 
between any two phase conductors, and a voltage of 
277 volts exists between any phase conductor and 
neutral (480/1.732). This connection is common 
in large department stores and office buildings.

Delta-Wye Connection
To make this connection, the primary windings 
are connected in delta, and the secondary windings 
are connected in wye, Figure 2-28.
The delta-connected primary provides a stable 
voltage for the wye-connected secondary. The center 
point of the secondary is often grounded to provide 
a neutral conductor, Figure 2-29. A very common 
voltage for this type connection is 208/120 volts. 
A voltage of 208 volts is provided between any of 
the phase conductors and a voltage of 120 volts 
exists between any phase conductor and neutral. 
The 208/120-volt connection is commonly used for 
apartment complexes and schools.

connection is used, the utility company generally 
connects a grounded (neutral) conductor to the cen-
ter connection of the primary, Figure 2-33.
Grounding the center point of the primary greatly 
increases the voltage stability of the connection. It is 
also common practice to connect the center points of 
both the primary and secondary windings together 
to help improve voltage stability, Figure 2-34. 
Doing this, however, does have the disadvantage of 
losing line isolation between the primary and sec-
ondary windings.
Many commercial lighting systems operate on 
277 volts. Air conditioning and heating systems are 
powered by 480 volts.
Delta-Delta Connection
Delta-delta connections are made by connecting 
both the primary and secondary of the transformers 
in a delta, Figure 2-30.
The delta-delta connection exhibits the same 
basic characteristics as the wye-delta connection 
discussed previously. One of the secondary wind-
ings of the delta-delta is often center tapped and 
grounded to produce a neutral connection. Like the 
open delta with one transformer having a grounded 
center tap to supply single-phase loads, this connec-
tion will also produce a high leg. The transformer 
supplying the single-phase load will have a greater 
kVA capacity that the other two transformers.
EXAMPLE
An installation requires a 3-phase load of 
75 kVA and an additional single-phase load 
of 50 kVA. Two of the transformers would have a 
minimum rating of 25 kVA (75 kVA/3  25 kVA). 
The third transformer that supplies the single-
phase load would have a minimum rating of 
75 kVA (25 kVA + 50 kVA  75 kVA), Figure 2-31.
Wye-Wye Connection
Wye-wye connections, Figure 2-32, are sel-
dom employed because they can exhibit extremely 
unstable voltages between phases if the line cur-
rents should become unbalanced. When a wye-wye

step of the process of de-energizing the equipment. 
By following a written procedure and initialing each 
step as it is taken, errors in switching can be avoided.
In many larger installations, grounds are 
placed on each side of the transformer after it 
is  de-energized, to protect the workers. If these 
grounds are not removed before the transformer is 
energized, the windings could be severely damaged. 
A written switching procedure includes the place-
ment and removal of these grounding connections. 
This helps avoid energizing a transformer with the 
grounds still in place.
After the power to the transformer has been dis-
connected and before doing any work, it is advisable 
to test all exposed connections for voltage. Be sure 
to use the proper test instrument with a voltage rat-
ing at least as high as the voltage rating of the con-
nection. This is especially important when there is 
more than one source of power, as in a double-ended 
substation, Figure 2-35.
Double-ended substations permit power to be 
supplied from another source in the event of equip-
ment failure. Although the circuit kVA capacity is 
reduced, power can be maintained until the defec-
tive equipment is repaired or replaced. This can, 
however, cause a backfeed to the secondary side 
of a transformer that has the primary disconnected. 
Extreme care must be taken when working with 
double-ended systems to ensure that power is not 
being applied to either the primary or secondary 
windings.
Entering a Transformer Tank
In some of the maintenance procedures, it is 
necessary to enter a transformer tank. When this is 
part of the maintenance procedure, the atmosphere 
in the tank must be tested for the presence of com-
bustible and/or toxic gases and also for the presence 
of sufficient oxygen. Oxygen is normally present in 
the atmosphere at about 21.2%. If this concentration 
is less than about 20%, it could be a health threat 
to the worker. If there are dangerous gases present 
or if there is insufficient oxygen in the tank, it must 
be ventilated with fresh air until safe conditions are 
met. When anyone is inside the tank, there must be a 
person outside the entrance to observe the worker in 
the tank and be alert for any problems encountered.
 TRANSFORMER 
MAINTENANCE
Regardless of the type of service-entrance connec-
tion, it is generally necessary to perform regular 
transformer maintenance. Transformers are usu-
ally thought of as being stationary objects with no 
moving parts. Because of this misconception, trans-
formers are often neglected and left out of routine 
preventive maintenance schedules. This could prove 
to be a very expensive omission. Transformers must 
be inspected and maintained on a regular schedule 
in order to get maximum performance and life from 
them. This applies to all transformers no matter how 
large or small they are. Environmental conditions 
such as changing temperatures caused by varying 
loads and changing ambient temperature affect the 
operation and life of the transformer. Dust, mois-
ture, and corrosive chemicals in the air surrounding 
the transformer greatly affect its operation and life. 
The type of maintenance procedures and intervals 
between procedures are governed by the type, size, 
location, and application of the transformer.
Safety Procedures
As with any electrical equipment, the primary 
consideration when working on or near transform-
ers must be the safety of personnel. Before working 
on any transformer, establish whether it is energized 
and whether the work can be done safely with power 
on the transformer. Most maintenance procedures 
require that power be disconnected and locked 
or tagged out. On larger transformers with high-
voltage connections, it is usually advisable to pre-
pare a written switching procedure detailing each 
FIGURE 2-34 The center points of both primary 
and secondary are connected together to help 
improve voltage stability.

the primary and secondary windings will test the insu-
lation between windings, Figure 2-36. A megger test 
from each winding to the housing or core will show 
any insulation weakness in this area, Figure 2-37.
Use a megger with voltage ratings close to the 
rating of the transformer winding; for example, a 
500-volt megger would be used to test the insulation 
on a transformer with a 480-volt rated winding.
Preventive Maintenance
The first step in any preventive maintenance 
procedure is inspection of the equipment. Inspection 
of the transformer will reveal the presence of rust or 
corrosion. Dirt or dust buildup or rust and corrosion 
should be noted at this time.
Cleaning
The outside of the transformer should be cleaned 
with an approved solvent or cleaner. Rust and corrosion 
should be removed and the housing painted if necessary.
Tightening
All connections and mounting bolts should be tight-
ened. Any corroded connections should be replaced.

These small transformers should be tested for short 
circuits and grounds annually. A megger test between

higher than the rated value under a no load condi-
tion. Voltage ratings are listed for full load, not no 
load. It would not be uncommon for a transformer 
winding rated at 24 volts to measure 28 or 30 volts 
with no load connected.
Pad-Mounted Oil-Cooled 
Transformers
External Inspection The first step in maintaining 
these transformers is a thorough external inspection. 
Look for evidence of leaks in the housing or cooling 
radiators. Inspect the housing for rust, corrosion, or 
damage, and note the general condition of the paint. 
Inspect the bushings for cracks or chips. Look for 
loose, corroded, or discolored connections. Inspect 
the housing ground connection. Make sure it is tight 
and free of corrosion. Most pad-mounted transform-
ers are contained in vaults, Figure 2-39. Many are 
equipped with temperature and pressure gauges to 
measure the coolant temperature and the pressure 
inside the transformer.
Cooling Equipment If the transformer utilizes 
external cooling fins, make sure that they are free of 
debris and clean, Figure 2-40.
After testing the windings with a megger, each 
winding should be tested for continuity with an 
ohmmeter, Figure 2-38.
This can be accomplished by connecting the 
ohmmeter leads across the terminals or leads con-
nected to the ends of each winding. This test will 
determine whether any of the windings are open, 
but it will probably not determine whether they are 
shorted. In some instances, the insulation of the wire 
breaks down and permits the turns to short together. 
When this occurs, it has the effect of reducing the 
number of turns for that winding. If these shorted 
windings do not make contact with the case or core 
of the transformer, a megger test will not reveal the 
problem. This type of problem is generally found by 
connecting the transformer to power and measuring 
the current and voltage values. Excessive current 
draw or a large deviation from the rated voltage of 
a winding is a good indicator of a shorted winding. 
When making this test, however, be aware that it 
is not uncommon for the secondary voltage to be

fans should be operated manually to be sure they 
work. Temperature and pressure switches and gauges 
are removed and calibrated once a year to ensure their 
proper operation. On transformers with a gas blanket 
(usually dry nitrogen) over the oil, the gas pressure 
should be checked at least once a week. These trans-
formers often have external temperature and pres-
sure gauges because the transformer is in a sealed 
container, Figure 2-41. The pressure regulator and 
gauges should be removed and calibrated once a year.
Transformer Protective Relaying
Transformers that have a gas blanket on top of 
the insulating oil have pressure switches that actuate 
an alarm system if the gas pressure on the blanket 
drops below a certain point. These switches should 
be tested frequently along with any temperature or 
pressure alarm devices on the transformer wind-
ings or tank. Protective relaying usually includes 
If the transformer is equipped with auxiliary 
cooling equipment, it should be checked for proper 
operation. Check radiator connections to the tank for 
leaks, and make necessary repairs. Automatic  cooling

Be sure to follow manufacturer’s recommendations 
for torque when tightening any connections. Check 
and tighten any mounting bolts. Look for deposits 
of sludge on windings core material or other struc-
tures. Sludge deposits indicate contamination of the 
oil and reduce the dielectric strength of the insula-
tion. Sludge can also act as thermal insulation, thus 
decreasing the transfer of heat from the internal parts 
to the cooling oil. While inspecting the internal parts 
of the transformer, it is good practice to look for any 
evidence of rust on the inside of the housing or cov-
ers. This might indicate condensation of moisture on 
these parts, which could be caused by a leaky gasket 
that allows ambient air to be admitted to the housing.
Insulation Testing
As with any other transformer, the dielectric 
strength of the insulation must be tested at least once a 
year. Megger testing can be done on the lower voltage 
transformers. Hand crank and battery-operated meg-
gers are shown in Figure 2-42. Special high- voltage 
equipment is necessary to test the insulation on 
higher-voltage units. A high-voltage tester, generally 
referred to as a “HiPot,” is shown in Figure 2-43. This 
unit develops a high voltage and measures any leak-
age current caused by weak or defective insulation.
For voltages above 13,800 volts, it is usually 
advisable to contract high-voltage insulation tests to 
a company that specializes in this type of tests and 
overcurrent relays, sudden pressure relays, reverse-
current relays, and winding and oil over tempera-
ture relays of various types. These devices should 
be tested and calibrated by qualified technicians on 
a regularly scheduled basis, but at least once a year.
Internal Inspection and 
Maintenance
On larger transformers, it is necessary to open 
manholes or inspection covers to determine the 
condition of the windings, connections, and other 
parts inside the housing. Before removing any cov-
ers, it is advisable to have new gaskets available for 
replacement when the opening is reclosed. Relieve 
any internal pressure in the transformer before loos-
ening flange bolts. It is very important that no tools 
or equipment be left inside the housing. Inventory all 
tools, parts, and equipment brought to the work area 
before opening the transformer and also before reclos-
ing it. Anything left in the transformer could cause a 
short circuit or interfere with the normal circulation 
of the cooling medium, and destroy the transformer. 
Make sure all safety precautions are followed, and 
atmosphere is tested before entering the transformer.
Look for loose, corroded, or discolored connec-
tions; distorted or damaged windings; and broken 
or missing spacers between windings. Check the 
general condition of the insulation for deterioration. 
Clean and tighten connections where necessary.

CHAPTER 2  The Unit Substation
dielectric strength of the oil. An average dielectric 
strength of 26 kV to 29 kV is considered usable. 
29 kV to 30 kV is good. Less than 26 kV is poor, 
and the oil should be replaced or filtered to increase 
dielectric strength. Special equipment is required to 
filter transformer oil, and the transformer must be 
de-energized. This process is usually contracted to 
companies specializing in transformer maintenance.
Other tests conducted on transformer oil include 
water content, gas content, and color. A water 
content of less than 25 parts per million is usually 
acceptable for units operating at voltages up to 
228 kV. Excess water can come from condensation 
or leaks in the housing or cooling system, and it 
reduces the dielectric strength of the insulation and 
oil. Filtering removes excess water from the oil.
Arcing or overheating can cause combustible gases 
such as acetylene, hydrogen, methane, and ethane to be 
formed in the oil. The presence of these gases can only 
be detected by specialized test equipment and should 
be done by qualified technicians. Samples should be 
sent to laboratories specializing in this type of test-
ing. Most transformer consulting firms prefer to have 
their technicians collect the samples in order to ensure 
uniform sampling procedures. In most cases the com-
panies doing this type of testing submit a report listing 
the conditions found, probable causes, suggested rem-
edies, and suggested frequency of retesting.
has trained technicians and the proper equipment 
available. As with any insulation testing a record 
should be kept of test results in order to establish 
any trends in insulation dielectric strength.
Oil Testing
Transformer oil testing should be conducted at 
least once a year, and more frequently in cases of 
frequent overloads, or if there is a history of mar-
ginal oil test results. Oil samples are drawn into 
clean dry containers. Label each container with 
the identity of the transformer. After the sample 
is drawn, it should be allowed to stand for a short 
period of time to allow any free water to settle to the 
bottom of the sample. If glass containers are used, 
it will be easier to see any free water in the sample.
Testing for dielectric strength is done in a special 
device that has a cup for the sample, and electrodes 
placed 0.1 inch apart. Thoroughly clean and dry 
the sample cup, and then rinse it with a portion of 
the sample. Fill the cup and allow it to settle for at 
least three minutes to eliminate air bubbles. Turn the 
device on and gradually increase the voltage until it 
arcs across the sample. Record the voltage and repeat 
the test five times on each of three samples from 
each transformer. Calculate the average of the fifteen 
tests done in this manner to get the representative

CHAPTER 3  Feeder Bus System
The enclosure containing the buses is con-
structed of two identical ventilated steel halves. 
When these halves are bolted together, they form 
a complete housing for the busbars. The copper 
busbars are supported on insulators inside the enclo-
sure, Figure 3-1.
The enclosure contains six busbars that are 
connected together in pairs to form a 3-conductor 
system. The busbars are machine wrapped with var-
nished cambric insulating tape, except where con-
nections are to be made.
The connection of the busway to enclosures 
such as unit substations is accomplished with 
flanged end connections. In addition, these connec-
tions are used to transpose the positions of the buses 
connected to the same phase, Figure 3-2. This trans-
position reduces the impedance of the total length 
of the busway. Because each phase is located at two 
places (or more in larger busways), the effects of 
the magnetic field are reduced, and the opposition 
to the current flow is also reduced. See 300.20 in 
the NEC for installation requirements related to 
induced currents.
 FEEDER DUCTS
Modern industrial electrical systems use several meth-
ods to transport electrical energy from the source of 
supply to the points within the plant where panelboards 
or switchboards are located. These methods may 
include the use of heavy feeder conductors or cables 
run in troughs or trays, or heavy busbars enclosed in 
ventilated ducts. For the industrial building covered in 
this text, busbars in a ventilated enclosure are speci-
fied and shown on the plans. The proper name for this 
assembly is a busway; however, most electricians and 
others call the assembly a bus duct. NEC Article 368 
contains the provisions for the installation of busways.
The source of electrical energy in this case is the 
unit substation located at the rear of the industrial 
building. Two ventilated feeder busways originate at 
the unit substation.
Feeder busway sections are available in standard 
10 ft (3 m) lengths and in other lengths on special order. 
Numerous fittings can be used to make branches, turn 
corners (in both the edgewise and the flat types of instal-
lation), and in general follow the contours of a building.

are used at the termination of each of the busway 
runs, NEC 368.10.
Power can be tapped from the feeder busway 
at any handhole opening. The handhole open-
ings are located at every joint in the enclosure. 
For standard lengths, the joints and the handhole 
openings are 10 ft (3 m) apart. Cable tap boxes are 
used for cable or conduit tapoff or feed-ins at any 
handhole opening, Figure 3-4A. Tap box cable lugs 
and straps, Figure 3-4B, are provided with each 
tap box. Fusible switch adapters (cubicles) and 
circuit-breaker cubicles are available for use when 
it is necessary to connect loads to the feeder, NEC 
368.17(C).
Feeder Busway No. 2
Much of the information presented for the ven-
tilated feeder busway No. 1 also applies to feeder 
busway No. 2. This feeder also begins at the low-
voltage section of the unit substation and rises 
vertically to a point slightly below the overhead 
roof structure of the building. An elbow section is 
installed at this point to change the direction of the 
busway while positioning it so that it runs horizon-
tally to form a flat type of installation. The busway 
runs in a westerly direction down the center of the 
manufacturing area until it reaches the approximate 
center of the area where a tee section is installed. As 
a result, branches of the same feeder duct run north 
and south and extend as far as the two outside plug-
in busways, Figure 3-5.
Feeder busway No. 2 is designed to carry large 
current values with a minimum power loss and at a 
Feeder Busway No. 1
Feeder busway No. 1 of the industrial building 
has a 600-volt and 1000-ampere rating. It starts 
at the low-voltage section of the unit substation 
and rises vertically for almost 8 ft (2.5 m). At 
this point, a tee section is installed to carry the 
busway in an edgewise, double-branch formation 
in both directions along the east wall of the main 
structure (toward the north and south walls of the 
building).
When the two busway branches meet the north 
and south walls of the building, edgewise ells change 
the direction of the branches. The branches of feeder 
busway No. 1 continue in an edgewise installation 
along the north and south walls of the manufactur-
ing area at a height of about 16 ft (4.9 m) above the 
floor. The feeder busway runs along the south ends 
at approximately the midpoint of the wall.
The branch of the feeder busway running along 
the north wall extends to the west wall of the manu-
facturing area. An edgewise ell installed at this point 
changes the direction of the busway once again. It 
now continues along the west wall of the building 
and ends before reaching the southwest corner of the 
manufacturing area. End closing sections, Figure 3-3,

or elevation requirements. The casing ends of adja-
cent sections overlap and are bolted together to form 
a rigid scarf-lap joint, Figure 3-6.
The flat busbars overlap in the same manner 
as for the casing. The busbars are bolted together 
with spring washers, cap screws, and splined 
nuts furnished with the sections. Vinyl plastic 
snap-on covers insulate the bolted busbar sec-
tions. There are two busbars per phase, for a total 
of six bars. Each bar measures 2¼ in. by 27⁄16 in. 
(6 mm by 58 mm).
Each busbar has a cross-sectional area of 0.61 in.2 
(394 mm2); thus, the total area per phase is 1.22 in.2 
(788 mm2). Because the assembly is rated for 1600 
amperes, the current density in the busbars is
1600 A
1.22 in.2  1311 amperes/in.2
 
(of cross-sectional area)
1600 A
788 mm2  2  amperes/mm2
When this is compared with a standard den-
sity value of 1000 amperes per square inch 
(1.55 amperes per square millimeter), the value of 
transposing the buses to reduce the impedance is 
evident.
low operating temperature. The busway is rated at 
1600 amperes and 600 volts.
Feeder busway No. 2 is constructed of flat, 
closely spaced, completely insulated, paired-phase 
busbars enclosed in a ventilated steel casing similar 
to that of busway No. 1. Straight sections, elbows, 
tees, and crosses are standard components available 
for use so that the duct can be installed horizontally 
or vertically, edgewise or flat, and can meet any turn

CHAPTER 3  Feeder Bus System
 PLUG-IN BUSWAY
The plug-in busway is actually a subfeeder taken 
from the No. 2 ventilated feeder. According to the 
layout shown on the plans, the plug-in busway 
makes 3-phase, 480-volt power available to all parts 
and at any point of the manufacturing area of the 
plant.
The busbars in the busway are coated with silver 
at each connection point. Silver is unequaled as an 
electrical conductor. In addition, silver is less sub-
ject to pitting (corrosion) than is copper. Thus, when 
the bus plug fingers contact the silver coating of the 
busbars, a high-conductivity connection is ensured. 
Standard plug-in sections are 10 ft (3 m) in length 
and consist of two identical formed steel halves that 
are bolted together to form the complete outside 
housing, Figure 3-8. This housing also provides the 
scarf-lap feature, which permits two adjacent duct 
sections to overlap each other by 12 in. (300 mm). 
The resulting lap simulates an interlocked joint and 
provides high rigidity and strength to the assembly, 
Figure 3-9.
The busway specified for the industrial build-
ing is 3-phase duct and is rated at 225 amperes and 
480 volts. Although ells, tees, and cross sections (or 
fittings) are not required for the industrial building 
installation, such fittings are available for use when 
specified by the design or layout. Some of these fit-
tings are shown in Figure 3-10.
Power takeoff plug-in openings are spaced at 
convenient intervals on alternate sides of the enclo-
sure. (Each side has the same number of openings.) 
Bus plugs can be inserted into any one of these 
openings. In this manner, branch circuits can be 
dropped to any item of equipment requiring electric 
power. The design of the bus plugs is such that they 
ground against the enclosure before the plug fingers 
contact the busbars. Additional safety is provided by 
this design during plug insertion, Figure 3-11.
A plug-in busway is used to provide a flexible 
tapoff means for motor branch circuits. In other 
words, the plug-in busway transports electrical 
energy from the ventilated feeder to the loca-
tions of the production machines. Tapoff openings 
every 10 in. (250 mm) along the busway mean that 
there is always a convenient location to connect a 
machine.
The pairs of busbars are joined together at the 
flanged ends located at the substation. End closers 
are installed at the two dead-end sections of the 
feeder.
 THE CIRCUIT-BREAKER 
CUBICLES
Circuit-breaker cubicles are used to connect the 
No.  2 feeder busway to the 225-ampere, plug-in 
busway runs, Figure 3-7. There are ten of these runs 
in the industrial building; thus, five double circuit-
breaker cubicles are required.
The circuit-breaker cubicle consists of a cube-
shaped steel housing. This housing can be attached 
to the lower side of the ventilated feeder duct. Two 
225-ampere circuit breakers are provided in a single 
housing. Openings in the sides of the cubicle permit 
the attachment of a plug-in busway. This busway 
runs in opposite directions at right angles to the 
feeder (review Figure 3-5). The circuit breakers 
protect the plug-in duct from overloads, as required 
by 368.17(C). This section of the Code requires that 
a means such as chains, ropes, or sticks be provided 
so that the disconnecting means can be operated 
from the floor. In this installation, a rope is to be 
connected to each operating handle and extended to 
within 7 ft (2.1 m) of the floor.

disrupting production in any way. Figure 3-12 shows 
a typical power distribution system.
The ten separate runs of the plug-in busway in the 
industrial building start at the circuit-breaker cubicles 
and extend for a distance of approximately 96 ft (29 m) 
in either direction (east-west). The runs are about 32 ft 
(9.6 m) apart on centers with a lesser distance between 
the outside runs and the walls of the structure. The 
ends of each run are fitted with end closer fittings.
The plug-in busway is much like a panel-
board extending through a complete load area. 
However, the busway system is much more flexible. 
If a machine is to be moved from one location to 
another, it is a simple matter to unplug the circuit-
protective device, move it and the machine to the 
new location, and plug the protective device back 
into the busway system. A move of this type can be 
made without shutting off power to the system or

 BUS PLUGS
One bus plug, Figure 3-14, must be furnished for 
each machine in the manufacturing area of the plant. 
According to the plans and specifications for the 
industrial building, there are 111 machines to be 
supplied with power from the plug-in system. The 
number and size of the bus plugs required are sum-
marized in Table 3-1.
The bus plugs provide branch-circuit protection 
for each of the machines and must be selected accord-
ing to the specific requirements of the individual 
machines. The plug-in devices are identified on Sheet 
E-2 of the plans with regard to the type of machine 
tool to be supplied. More detailed information is given

CHAPTER 4  Panelboards 
63
 PANELBOARDS
Circuit control and overcurrent protection must be 
provided for all circuits and the power-consuming 
devices connected to these circuits. Lighting and 
power panelboards located throughout the build-
ing being supplied with electrical energy provide 
this control and protection. Fifteen panelboards are 
provided in the industrial building to feed electrical 
energy to the various circuits, Table 4-1.
All of the required panelboards are listed in the 
specifications and are shown on the plans or are 
referred to on the riser diagram. These panelboards 
distribute the electrical energy and protect the cir-
cuits supplying outlets throughout the building. The 
schedule in Table 4-1 shows that eleven of the fifteen 
panelboards listed supply lighting and receptacle 
circuits. As a general rule, a panelboard for which 
more than 10% of its overcurrent devices are rated 
at 30 amperes or less, and for which neutral con-
nections are provided, is defined as a lighting and 
appliance branch-circuit panelboard. Throughout 
this text, this type of panelboard will be called a 
lighting panelboard. Panelboards not meeting these 
requirements are known as power or distribution 
panelboards.
Lighting and Appliance 
Panelboards
The basic requirements for panelboards are 
given in 408.36. Panelboards P-1 through P-10 and 
P-12 are considered as lighting and appliance panel-
boards (Table 4-1).
For these panelboards, follow these require-
ments:
• The panelboard shall have a rating of not less 
than the minimum feeder capacity as calcu-
lated according to NEC Article 408.
• The panelboard must be protected using an 
overcurrent protective device with a trip setting 
not exceeding the rating of the panelboard.
• The total 3-hour load shall not exceed 80% of 
the panelboard rating except when specifically 
rated for 100% continuous duty.
Panelboards are available with standard main rat-
ings of 100, 225, 400, 600, 800, and 1200 amperes. 
These panelboards may be installed without a main 
protective device and can be connected directly to 
a feeder protected at not more than the rating of 
the panelboard. Individual protection is required 
on lighting and appliance panelboards when these 
panelboards are connected to the secondary of 
a transformer having only primary protection, 
Figure 4-1.
When a subfeeder, such as the one from trans-
former TA (as shown on Sheet E-1 of the working 
drawings), serves more than one panelboard, then 
connections must be made in the subfeeder for each 
of the panelboards. These connections can be made 
either by tapping the conductor or by using subfeed 
lugs in the panelboards, Figure 4-2.
If subfeed lugs are used, the electrician must 
ensure that the lugs are suitable for making mul-
tiple connections, as required by 110.14(A). In 
general, this means that a separate lug is to be 
provided for each conductor being connected, 
Figure 4-3.
When connections of this type are employed, it 
is very important to make certain that the connec-
tions are tightened properly. Loose or poor connec-
tions are one of the leading causes of electrical fires 
and damaged equipment. The damage caused by

If taps are made to the subfeeder, they may be 
reduced in size according to 240.21. This specification 
is very useful in cases such as that of panelboard P-12. 
For this panelboard, a 100-ampere main breaker is fed 
by a 350 kcmil conductor. Within the distances given 
in the section, a conductor with a 100-ampere rating 
a poor connection on a relay terminal is shown in 
Figure 4-4. The damaged conductor and terminal are 
shown in Figure 4-5. Many manufacturers provide 
torque specifications. When this is the case, a torque 
wrench should be used to properly tighten the con-
nections, Figure 4-6.

including two double-pole breakers (to supply spe-
cial receptacle outlets). Two single-pole breakers, 
Figure 4-7, require the same installation space as for 
a double-pole breaker, Figure 4-8.
For a 3-pole circuit breaker such as the one 
shown in Figure 4-9, three poles are required 
for each breaker used. When the panelboards are 
purchased, the interiors are specified by the total 
number of poles required; the circuit breakers are 
ordered separately.

CHAPTER 4  Panelboards 
67
The importance of the interrupt rating is covered 
in detail in Electrical Wiring–Commercial. The stu-
dent should recall that if there is any question as to 
the exact value of the short-circuit current available 
at a point, a circuit breaker with a high interrupt rat-
ing is to be installed.
Many circuit breakers used as the main protec-
tive device are provided with an adjustable magnetic 
trip, Figure 4-10. Adjustments of this trip determine 
the degree of protection provided by the circuit 
breaker if a short circuit occurs. The manufacturer 
of this device provides exact information about the 
adjustments to be made. In general, a low setting 
may be ten or twelve times the overload trip rating. 
Two rules should be followed whenever the mag-
netic trip is set:
• The lower setting provides the greater protection.
• The setting should be lower than the value 
of the short-circuit current available at that 
point.
 POWER 
PANELBOARDS
The panelboard schedule in Table 4-1 shows that 
four panelboards in the industrial building are 
power panelboards. A typical power panelboard is 
 PANELBOARD 
PROTECTIVE DEVICE
The main for a panelboard may be either a fuse or 
a circuit breaker. Because the Electrical Wiring–
Commercial text discusses the use of fuses in detail, 
this text will concentrate on the use of circuit break-
ers. The selection of the circuit breaker should be 
based on the necessity to
• provide the proper overload protection;
• ensure a suitable voltage rating;
• provide a sufficient interrupt current rating;
• provide short-circuit protection; and
• coordinate the breaker(s) with other protective 
devices.
The choice of the overload protection is based 
on the rating of the panelboard. The trip rating 
of the circuit breaker cannot exceed the ampacity 
of the busbars in the panelboard. The number of 
branch-circuit breakers generally is not a factor in 
the selection of the main protective device except 
in a practical sense. It is a common practice to have 
the total amperage of the branch breakers exceed 
the rating of the main breaker by several times.
The voltage ratings of the breakers must be 
higher than that of the system. Breakers are usually 
rated at 250 or 600 volts.

CHAPTER 5  Trolley Busways
Trolley Busway Run A
Trolley run A consists of straight busway 
extending for 68 ft (20.7 m). One 3-phase drop-out 
section is installed at the approximate midpoint of 
the run. A drop-out section provides the means for 
removing or inserting the trolleys, Figure 5-2. As 
shown in Figure 5-2, the drop-out section contains 
two hinged doors that open when a lever is raised. 
When the lever is in the down position, the doors 
are firmly closed and the trolleys move past this sec-
tion smoothly. Blocking straps ensure that a trolley 
cannot be placed in the duct incorrectly. This feature 
also ensures that the polarity is always correct after 
the trolleys are inserted. Drop-out sections are avail-
able in lengths of 10 ft (3 m), and one drop section 
must be installed in each run.
The trolley busway is to be suspended 8 ft 
(2.5 m) above the floor according to the specifica-
tions and is supported by standard hangers. These 
hangers also serve as a means for joining adjacent 
sections and automatically aligning the busbars. The 
hangers are formed from 12-gauge steel. However, 
the only tool needed to join the industrial-type trol-
ley duct is a screwdriver.
Intermediate-type hangers are used at the mid-
point of each standard 10 ft (3 m) section to give 
extra support. The intermediate hangers fit snugly 
around the duct sections but do not interfere with the 
free passage of the trolleys. The combination of the 
standard hangers and the intermediate hangers sup-
ports the busway at 5 ft (1.5 m) intervals, resulting in 
a very rigid and secure installation, Figure 5-3. The 
standard and intermediate hangers are attached to 
the overhead structure by rod or strap-type supports, 
Figure 5-4.
 THREE-PHASE 
TROLLEY BUSWAY
Many modern industrial plants use systems of 
mobile trolley outlets that move along specially 
constructed busways. The industrial trolley bus is 
a 100-ampere, enclosed busbar electrical system. 
Such a trolley bus provides a continuous outlet sys-
tem for feeding electrical energy to portable electric 
tools, cranes, hoists, and other electrical loads.
When the trolley system is installed over pro-
duction and assembly lines, it provides current to 
equipment through trolleys that move along with the 
particular object being assembled. Because the bus-
bars are totally enclosed in a steel casing, there are 
no exposed live parts to provide hazards to worker 
safety. This system eliminates the need for and the 
hazards of portable cords plugged into fixed outlets 
at the floor level.
 THE TROLLEY 
BUSWAY RUNS
Sheet E-2 of the industrial building plans shows the 
layout of the four trolley busway runs to be installed. 
The specifications provide more detailed informa-
tion about the trolley busway system. The four runs 
as shown on Sheet E-2 are labeled A, B, C, and D. 
These runs are 68 ft (20.7 m), 131 ft (40 m), 96 ft 
(29 m), and 106 ft (32.3 m) long, respectively.
The trolley systems are constructed of straight 
sections joined end to end, Figure 5-1. The standard 
section is 10 ft (3 m) long, but sections of less than 
10 ft (3 m) in length are available so that a run can 
be made to exact dimensions. Curved sections and 
other fittings are also available.

CHAPTER 5  Trolley Busways
The trolleys have six graphite bronze shoes. 
These shoes make contact with the busbars and 
provide a path that continues through the fuse cut-
out and receptacle to the heavy-duty, 4-wire rubber 
cord. This cord is used to attach the various portable 
tools such as electric drills, buffers, grinders, and 
other equipment to the busway system, Figure 5-6.
Each end of the busway is capped with an end 
plate and bumper assembly. This device closes the 
ends of the busway run and acts as a bumper for any 
trolley reaching the end of the busway. The bumper 
absorbs shock and protects the trolley from damage.
Feed-in Adapter
The power supply from the panelboard is fed 
into the busway run through a feed-in adapter, 
Figure 5-4. The feed-in adapter has pressure-type 
wire terminals. This adapter can be used at the end 
of a run, or it can be installed in the center of the 
busway to provide center feed for the connection of 
the conduit or cable from the panelboard. Conduit 
must be installed between the power panelboard and 
the feed-in adapter to bring power to the trolley bus-
way. A 100-ampere circuit will run in this conduit 
from panelboard P-15.
The Trolleys
Several types of both fused and unfused trolleys 
are available. The trolley specified for the industrial 
building is a fusible, box-type tool hanger with a 
heavy-duty rating. The box tool hanger, Figure 5-5, 
has a hinged cover and is provided with puller-type 
fuse cutouts, plug receptacles, and cord clamps. For 
the industrial building, cutouts for 0- to 30-ampere 
fuses are provided. The trolley has eight wheels and 
four side thrust rollers to ensure smooth movement 
along the busway.

energy to the duct runs. A 100-ampere feeder circuit 
will run in this conduit from panelboard P-15.
Trolley Busway Run B
As shown on the plans, trolley busway run B 
extends 131 ft (40 m) in length. The information sup-
plied for busway run A also applies to trolley runs B, 
C, and D. The location of run B is shown on Sheet 
E-2. As is the case for run A, conduit must be installed 
to power panelboard No. 15. The conduit runs must 
be routed to conform with the structure of the build-
ing. Nine trolleys are required for trolley run B.
Trolley Run C
Trolley run C is a straight run extending 96 ft 
(29 m) (see Sheet E-2 of the plans). This run is con-
nected to power panelboard No. 15 by conduit from 
the feed-in adapter located at the end of the run. Six 
trolleys are required for trolley run C.
The 4-wire rubber cord provides three conduc-
tors to operate the 3-phase portable tools used on the 
job. The fourth conductor (green in color) is used to 
ground the equipment (400.23 and 400.24).
One end of the grounding conductor must be 
attached securely to the trolley, and the other end to 
the housing of the portable tool. The cord must be 
approved for heavy-duty usage and may be a type 
SJ containing 12 AWG conductors. The fuses in the 
trolley are rated at 20 amperes, Figure 5-7.
The specifications for the industrial building 
call for the use of one trolley for each 15 ft (4.5 m) 
or fraction thereof of trolley busway. Thus, for run 
A (68 ft [20.7 m] long), the contractor must furnish 
five trolleys. Figure 5-8 shows a typical installation 
of trolley busway.

Trolley Run D
Trolley run D is 106 ft (32.3 m) long. The instal-
lation methods and parts used for this run are the 
same as those used in the other runs. Panelboard 
P-15 (located on the west wall of the manufactur-
ing area) again supplies electrical energy to the run. 
According to the specifications, run D requires eight 
trolleys including tool hangers to be installed, one 
for every 15 ft (4.5 m) or fraction thereof of busway.
Each of the four trolley systems (A through D) 
is a 3-phase system and is rated at 208 volts and 100 
amperes. The equipment attachment plugs used with 
the duct system are polarized. This feature elimi-
nates several problems when portable tools having 
3-phase motors are used. For example, reversed 
phases and the resulting reversal in the direction of 
rotation of the portable tools are eliminated.
These trolley systems have several advantages. The 
runs follow the production and assembly lines of the 
plant. This convenience tends to increase the amount 
of work that can be completed. A neater and safer 
production area is maintained because the tools the 
worker commonly uses are not scattered over the floor

outlet system. If extensive alterations or a major 
plant changeover requires the removal of the light-
ing trolley duct, the duct sections are completely 
reusable.
The lighting trolley busways are rated at 50 amperes. 
Thus, 50-ampere lighting circuits are available, as com-
pared with the 15- or 20-ampere branch circuits used in 
conventional lighting systems. The 50-ampere lighting 
circuits used in the trolley systems are approved by the 
Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL).
The trolley lighting circuits in the industrial 
building consist of twenty 50-ampere branch cir-
cuits. These branch circuits, in turn, are composed 
of 20 trolley runs constructed of standard 10 ft (3 m) 
lengths and special lengths as necessary. Each run is 
about 96 ft (29.3 m) long. The runs are suspended by 
special clips from messenger wires stretched tightly 
below the roof structure trusswork. These messenger 
wires are adjusted for tension by turnbuckles located 
at the ends of the runs. Intermediate supports for the 
messenger cables, Figure 5-10, must be attached to 
 LIGHTING IN THE 
MANUFACTURING 
AREA
The general illumination system for the manufac-
turing area of the plant consists of 180 fluorescent 
luminaires suspended from a system of 50-ampere 
lighting trolley busways. This type of lighting sys-
tem is in wide use in industrial applications because 
of the mobility provided by the system, Figure 5-9. 
For example, in modern industry, production lines 
and machine layouts can be changed when so 
required by the introduction of new products or 
manufacturing methods. A lighting system com-
posed of fixed outlets and a fixed conduit system is 
not easily adaptable to such changing requirements.
On the other hand, a system of luminaires sus-
pended from a trolley system can be readily shifted 
from one location to another as desired. It is not nec-
essary to take down or replace heavy conduit sys-
tems as would be required to change a fixed lighting

the overhead structure at appropriate intervals to 
prevent any sagging of the lighting system.
The lighting trolley is available in 5 ft (1.5 m) 
and 10 ft (3 m) sections. These sections are joined 
by plain couplings. The ends of the sections contain 
trolley entrance end caps. The plain couplings make 
a positive connection, electrically and mechanically, 
between two duct sections and permit free passage of 
the trolleys along the duct runs. The trolley entrance 
and caps serve two purposes: They close the ends of 
the duct runs and they provide an entrance point for 
the insertion or removal of the trolleys, Figure 5-11.
Other trolley entrance couplings are used at the 
midpoint (approximately) of each duct run. This 
arrangement is an additional convenience when 
removing or inserting trolleys. To prevent arcing, 
trolleys should not be inserted or removed while 
they are under load.
Center feed-in boxes are used to bring the elec-
trical supply cables to the trolley busway. Each box

has two adjustable couplings (one on each end of the 
box) connected by removable flexible jumper wires. 
In addition, the feed-in box has two sets of concen-
tric knockouts that provide a means of bringing the 
feeding conduits into the duct system, Figure 5-12.
The Busbars
The trolley busway is equipped with two cop-
per busbars. Each bar has a cross-sectional area 
of 30,557 circular mils and is rated by UL at 50 
amperes and 250 volts, Figure 5-13.
FIGURE 5-13 Busbar section.
Copyright © 2015 Cengage Learning®.
The Trolleys
Several types of trolleys are available for use 
with the lighting trolley busway. The trolley speci-
fied for the industrial building is equipped with a 
cord clamp and grounding screw. The trolley has 
metal wheels and rolls freely along the busway from 
one position to another. Two heavy-duty, weight-
supporting devices are used with the trolley when 
heavy luminaires are to be suspended from it as is 
the case with the industrial building, Figure 5-14.
The twenty 50-ampere trolley busway branch 
lighting circuits in the manufacturing area run east 
and west from the twenty center feed-in boxes (see 
Sheet E-3 of the plans). These circuits form ten lines 
of trolley busway suspended lighting. Each circuit 
has nine trolleys, and an industrial-type, 96 in. long 
(2.5 m long) fluorescent luminaire is suspended from 
each trolley.
The luminaires used in the manufacturing area 
are industrial-type fluorescent luminaires. Each 
luminaire uses two F96T12/CW/VHO lamps rated 
at 215 watts each. However, the power losses in the 
ballasts increase this value to 450 volt-amperes per 
luminaire. The fluorescent ballasts used are all of

CHAPTER 5  Trolley Busways
the high power factor type, with individual fusing 
provided in accordance with 368.17.
The luminaires are also equipped with lead-lag 
adders, which cause the lamps to fire at different times. 
In other words, the current wave crest of one lamp 
occurs nearly one-half cycle before the second lamp 
receives the wave crest. This arrangement eliminates 
most of the stroboscopic effect that occurs if individual 
lamps are used or if the lead-lag system is not used.
The luminaires are supported at the center by the 
trolley attachment and by two additional supports 
near the ends of each luminaire. Of the 180 lumi-
naires installed in the industrial building, 45 are fed 
from each of the four panelboards.
In addition to the lighting, several receptacle 
outlets are also supplied with power from each of 
the panelboards. According to the plans and the 
Schedule of Receptacle Outlets included in the 
specifications, each of the four lighting panelboards 
in the manufacturing area of the plant contains seven 
20-ampere circuit breakers feeding fifteen duplex 
grounding receptacles. Two or three receptacle out-
lets are assigned to each of these 120-volt circuits.
 LIGHTING IN THE 
BOILER ROOM
Panelboard P-12 is located in the boiler room of 
the plant. This panelboard supplies the lighting and 
receptacle needs in this area. There are sixteen light-
ing outlets in the boiler room connected to four sep-
arate circuits so that there are four outlets on each 
circuit. The luminaires used in the boiler room are 
the same as those used in the manufacturing area. 
However, these sixteen luminaires are suspended by 
chains from fixed outlet boxes.
The Cord Drops (NEC Article 400)
The specifications call for the use of 4-conductor 
type SJ rubber cord to connect the various machines 
in the manufacturing area to the busway system. 
These cords are rated for heavy-duty usage. The 
colors of the individual conductors of the cord are 
black, white, red, and green.
The green conductor is reserved for equipment 
grounding. One end of this conductor is connected 
to the steel housing of the bus plug. The other end 
of the conductor is connected to the steel housing of 
the motor control equipment on the machine.
The drop from the overhead busway system to 
supply power to the machines located at various points 
on the floor is usually made by either of two methods.
One method involves the use of rigid or thinwall 
conduit to extend from the bus plug to the machine 
that it will serve. The conduit may be run horizon-
tally with or without bends to a point directly over the 
machine to be supplied and then dropped vertically.

CHAPTER 5  Trolley Busways 
81
The resulting system is a rigid raceway assembly 
that must be supported by appropriate hangers. The 
ungrounded conductors are pulled into the conduit, 
which serves as the equipment ground.
One disadvantage of this method is its inflex-
ibility when the layout of the machines being served 
must be rearranged. In such a case, the conduit 
assemblies must be taken down, the wire removed, 
and the conduit disassembled. Then, the entire run 
must be rebuilt to fit the new location using new 
wire and new conduit for part or all of the assembly.
The second method is to use rubber cord drops 
from the bus plug to the machine being served, 
Figure 5-15. This method is flexible in terms of 
making changes and thus is commonly used. The 
industrial building uses the rubber cord drop method.
Strain Reliefs
Strain relief grips are used in the cord drop method 
of supplying equipment to comply with 400.10. The 
strain relief type of grip is designed for use at the ter-
minals or ends of the rubber cord drop where it enters 
or leaves a knockout opening in the bus plug, in the 
disconnecting switch, or in a motor controller.
The bus drop grips are used at or near the ends 
of the rubber cord runs and also where the cord 
changes direction from the horizontal to the vertical, 
Figure 5-15 and Figure 5-16.
Figure 5-17 shows that the cord grips are con-
structed in a basketweave pattern. The grips are 
tubular in shape and are made from strands of gal-
vanized plow steel wire. Grips are available in a

variety of sizes to fit most cables or cords. When 
strain or tension is placed on the rubber cord so that 
it is pulled taut, the basket structure of the cord grip 
contracts to apply a stronger grip on the cord.
Bus drop safety springs are used to maintain the 
proper tension on the horizontal and vertical cord runs.

on an ambient air temperature of 86°F (30°C).
• If the ambient temperature is above 86°F 
(30°C), a correction factor must be applied. 
These factors are given in Table 310.15(B)(2)
(a) reproduced in this chapter as Table 6-4.
• If there are four or more conductors in the 
raceway, an adjustment factor shall be applied. 
These factors are given in NEC Table 310.15(B)

 INSULATION TYPE
A factor that determines the amount of current a con-
ductor is permitted to carry is the type of insulation 
used. The insulation is the nonconductive covering

around the wire, as shown in Figure 6-1. Some types 
of insulation can withstand more heat than other types. 
The voltage rating of the conductor is also determined 
by the type of insulation. The amount of voltage a par-
ticular type of insulation can withstand without break-
ing down is determined by the type of material from 
which it is made and its thickness. Table 6-1 [NEC 
Table 310.104(A)] lists different types of insulation 
and certain specifications about each one.
The table is divided into seven main columns. 
The first column lists the trade name of the insula-
tion; the second lists its identification code letter; the

third column lists its maximum operating tempera-
ture; and the fourth shows its applications and where 
it is permitted to be used. The fifth column lists the 
material from which the insulation is made; the sixth 
states its thickness; and the last column lists the type 
of outer covering over the insulation.
PROBLEM 1: Find the maximum operating tem-
perature of type TW insulation. Refer to Table 6-1.
⦁ Solution: The eighteenth data row of Table 6-1
gives the specifications for type TW conductors. The 
third column gives the maximum operating tempera-
ture as 60°C, or the equivalent 140°F. ⦁
PROBLEM 2: Can type THHN insulation be 
used in wet locations?
⦁ Solution: Locate type THHN insulation in 
Table 6-1. The fourth column indicates that this insula-
tion can be used in dry and damp locations. This type 
of insulation cannot be used in wet locations. For an 
explanation of the difference between damp and wet 
locations, consult “locations” in NEC Article 100. ⦁
Conductor Metals
Another factor that determines the allowable 
ampacity of the conductor is the type of metal used 
for the wire. Table 6-2 (NEC Table 310.15(B)(16)) 
lists the current-carrying capacity of both copper 
and aluminum or copper-clad aluminum conductors. 
A study of the table reveals that a copper conductor 
is permitted to carry more current than an aluminum 
conductor of the same size and insulation type. An 
8 AWG copper conductor with type TW insulation 
has an allowable ampacity of 40 amperes. An 8 
AWG aluminum conductor with type TW insulation 
has an allowable ampacity of 30 amperes.
 CORRECTION 
FACTORS
One of the main conditions that determines the 
current a conductor is permitted to carry is the 
ambient, or surrounding, air temperature. Table 6-2 
lists the allowable ampacity of not more than three 
conductors in a raceway. These allowable ampacities 
are based on an ambient air temperature of 86°F, or 
30°C. If these conductors are to be used in a location 
with a higher ambient temperature, the ampacity of 
the conductor must be reduced.
The correction factor chart located in Table 
310.15(B)(2)(a), Table 6-4, provides the necessary 
factors for ambient temperatures from 50°F to 437°F 
(10°C to 225°C). This table is divided into columns 
that list the temperature rating of different types of 
insulation. To use this table, find the column that list 
the temperature rating of the conductor in question.  
Then find the correction factor listed for the ambient 
temperature where the conductor is located.
NOTE: After reduction, the current-carrying 
capacity of a conductor is referred to as the 
ampacity, not the allowable ampacity. z
PROBLEM 1: What is the ampacity of a 4 
AWG copper conductor with type THWN insulation 
that will be used in an area with an ambient tempera-
ture of 43°C?
⦁ Solution: Determine the allowable ampacity of 
a 4 AWG copper conductor with type THWN insula-
tion. Type THWN insulation is located in the 75°C col-
umn of Table 6-2. The table lists an allowable ampacity 
of 85 amperes. Refer to the Correction Factors shown 
in Table 6-4. In the left-hand column, select a tempera-
ture range that includes 43°C. The table lists a correc-
tion factor of 0.82 in the 75°C column. The ampacity is 
to be multiplied by the correction factor. ⦁
85  0.82  69.7 amperes
PROBLEM 2: What is the ampacity of a 1/0 
AWG copper-clad aluminum conductor with type 
RHH insulation when the conductor is installed on 
insulators in free air, in an area with an ambient air 
temperature of 100°F?

⦁ Solution: In Table 6-3, locate the column that 
contains type RHH copper-clad aluminum. RHH 
insulation is located in the 90°C column. The table 
indicates an allowable ampacity of 205 amperes. 
Determine the correction factor from the 90°C column 
in Table 6-4. Fahrenheit degrees are located in the far 
right hand column of Table 310.15(B)(2)(a). The 
100°F temperature is between 97°F and 104°F. The 
correction factor for this temperature is 0.91. Multiply 
the ampacity of the conductor by this factor. ⦁
205  0.91  187 amperes
 MORE THAN THREE 
CONDUCTORS IN 
RACEWAY
Table 6-2 (NEC Table 310.15(B)(16)) and NEC 
Table 310.15(B)(18) list allowable ampacities for 
three conductors in a raceway. If a raceway is to 
contain more than three conductors, the allowable 
ampacity of the conductors must be derated. This 
is because the heat from each conductor combines 
with the heat dissipated by the other conductors to 
produce a higher temperature inside the raceway. 
Table 6-5 [NEC Table 310.15(B)(3)(a)] lists the 
adjustment factors. If the raceway is used in a space 
with a greater ambient temperature than that listed in 
the appropriate wire table, the temperature correc-
tion formula also shall be applied.
• When conductors are of different systems, or 
where installing the conductors in a cable tray, 
310.15(B)(3) should be reviewed.
• Adjustment is not required for raceways size 24 
(600 mm) or less in length.
PROBLEM: Twelve 14 AWG copper conductors 
with type RHW insulation are to be installed in con-
duit in an area with an ambient temperature of 110°F. 
What will be the ampacity of these conductors?
⦁ Solution: First, determine the allowable 
ampacity of a 14 AWG copper conductor with type 
RHW insulation. Type RHW insulation is located in 
the 75°C column of Table 6-2. A 14 AWG copper 
conductor has an allowable ampacity of 20 amperes. 
The next step is to use the correction factor for 
ambient temperature. A correction factor of 0.82 is 
appropriate.
20  0.82  16.4 amperes
Next, an adjustment factor located in Table 6-5 shall 
be applied. The table indicates a factor of 50% where 10 
through 20 conductors are installed in a raceway.
16.4  0.50  8.2 amperes
A 14 AWG, Type RHW conductor where installed 
in a raceway, with a group of twelve conductors, in a 
110°F ambient has an ampacity of 8.2 amperes. ⦁
 UNDERGROUND 
CONDUCTORS
NEC Tables 310.60(C)(81) through 310.60(C)(84) 
list ampacities and temperature correction factors for 
conductors with voltage ratings from 2001 to 35,000 
volts and intended for direct burial. NEC Tables 
310.60(C)(77), 310.60(C)(78), and 310.60(C)(79) 
list conductors that are to be buried in electrical 
duct banks. An electrical duct can be a single metal 
or nonmetallic conduit. An electrical duct bank is a 
group of electrical ducts buried together, as shown in 
NEC Figure 310.60. When a duct bank is used, the 
center point of individual ducts should be separated 
by a distance of no less than 7.5 in. (190 mm).
 CALCULATING 
CONDUCTOR SIZES 
AND RESISTANCE
Although the wire tables in the NEC are used to 
determine the proper wire size for most installa-
tions, there are instances in which these tables are 
not used. One example of this is the formula shown 
in 310.60(C). This formula may be used under engi-
neering supervision.

 LONG WIRE 
LENGTHS
It also becomes necessary to calculate wire sizes 
instead of using the tables in the Code when the 
length of the conductor is excessively long. The 
listed ampacities in the Code tables assume that 
the length of the conductor will not significantly 
increase the resistance of the circuit. When the wire 
length becomes extremely long, however, it is neces-
sary to calculate the size of wire needed.
All wire contains resistance. As the length of 
wire is increased, it has the effect of adding resis-
tance in series with the load. There are four factors 
that determine the resistance of a length of wire:
 1. The material from which the wire is made. 
Different types of material have different wire 
resistances. A copper conductor will have less 
resistance than an aluminum conductor of the 
same size and length. An aluminum conductor 
will have less resistance than a piece of iron 
wire the same size and length.
 2. The diameter of the conductor. The larger 
the diameter, the less resistance it will have. 
The diameter of a wire is measured in mils. 
One mil equals 0.001 inch. The circular mil 
area of a wire is the diameter of the wire in 
mils squared.
EXAMPLE
Assume a wire has a diameter of 0.064 inch. 
Converting to mils:
0.064 in.  1000 mil per in.  64 mils
The area in circular mils is
642  (64  64)  4096 cmil
 3. The length of the conductor. The longer the 
conductor, the more resistance it will have. 
Adding length to a conductor has the same 
effect as connecting resistors in series.
 4. The temperature of the conductor. As a general 
rule, most conductive materials will increase 
their resistance with an increase of tempera-
ture. Some exceptions to this rule are carbon, 
silicon, and germanium. If the coefficient of 
temperature for a particular material is known, 
its resistance at different temperatures can be 
calculated. Materials that increase their resis-
tance with an increase of temperature have a 
positive coefficient of temperature. Materials 
that decrease their resistance with an increase 
of temperature have a negative coefficient of 
temperature.
In the customary system of measurement, a 
standard value of resistance is the mil foot. It is used 
to determine the resistance of different lengths and 
sizes of wire. A mil foot is a piece of wire 1 foot long 
and 1 mil in diameter, Figure 6-2. The resistances of 
a mil foot of wire at 20°C for different materials 
are shown in Table 6-6. Notice the wide range of 
0.001 in.

resistances for different materials. The temperature 
coefficient of the different types of conductors is 
also listed. The temperature of a conductor can 
greatly affect its resistance. Table 6-6 lists the ohms 
per mil foot at 20°C. The resistance of material is 
generally given at 20°C because it is the standard 
used in the American Engineers Handbook. The 
temperature coefficient of the material can be used 
to determine the resistance of a material at different 
temperatures.
PROBLEM: What is the ohms per mil foot at 
75°C?
⦁ Solution: Use the formula:
R  Rref [1  a(T  Tref)]
where
 
R = Conductor resistance at temperature “T”
 
Rref =  Conductor resistance at reference 
temperature (20°C in this example)
 
α =  Coefficient of resistance for the conductor 
material
 
T = Conductor temperature in °C
Tref =  Reference temperature at which α is 
specified for the conductor material
R  10.4[1  0.0039(75  20)]
R  10.4[1  0.0039(55)]
R  10.4[1  0.2145]
R  10.4[1.2145]
R  12.63
At a temperature of 75°C, copper would have a 
resistance of 12.63 ohms per mil foot. ⦁
 CALCULATING 
RESISTANCE
Now that a standard measure of resistance for dif-
ferent types of materials is known, the resistance of 
different lengths and sizes of these materials can be 
calculated. The formula for calculating resistance of 
a certain length, size, and type of wire is
R  K  L
cmil
where
 R = resistance of the wire
 K = ohms per mil foot
 L = length of wire in feet
cmil = circular mil area of the wire
This formula can be converted to calculate other 
values in the formula such as size, length, and area 
of wire used.
To find the size of wire, use
cmil  K  L
R
To find the length of wire, use

CHAPTER 6  Using Wire Tables and Determining Conductor Sizes
⦁ Solution: The value for K can be found in 
Table 6-6, where the resistance and temperature 
coefficient of several types of materials are listed. 
The table indicates a value of 10.4 ohms per cmil 
foot for a copper conductor. The length (L) was 
given at 550 feet, and the area of 6 AWG wire is 
listed at 26,240 cmil, as shown in Table 6-7. ⦁
R  10.4  550
26,240
  0.218 ohm
PROBLEM 2: An aluminum wire 2250 feet 
long cannot have a resistance greater than 0.2 ohm. 
What is the minimum size wire that may be used?
⦁ Solution: To find the size of wire, use
 cmil  K (ohms per mil ft)  L (ft)
R (ohms)
  17  2250
0.2
  191,250
The standard size conductor for this installation can 
be found in Table 6-7. Because the resistance can-
not be greater than 0.2 ohm, the conductor cannot 
be smaller than 191,250 circular mils. The smallest 
acceptable standard conductor size is 4/0 AWG.
Good examples of when it becomes necessary 
to calculate the wire size for a particular installation 
can be seen in the following problems. ⦁
PROBLEM 3: A workshop is to be installed 
in a  facility separate from the main building. The 
workshop is to contain a small arc welder, air com-
pressor, various power tools, lights, and receptacles. 
It is determined that a 100-ampere, 120/240-volt, 
single-phase panelboard will be needed for this instal-
lation. The distance between the buildings is 206 
ft (62.79 m). An extra 10 ft (3.05 m) of cable is to 
be added for connections, making a total length of 
216 ft (65.84 m). The maximum current will be 100 
amperes. The voltage drop, at full load, is to be kept to 
a maximum of 3%, as recommmended by 210.19(A), 
Informational Note No. 4. An ambient temperature of 
68°F (20°C) is assumed. What size copper conductors 
should be used for this installation?
⦁ Solution: The first step is to determine the 
maximum amount of resistance the conductors can 
have without producing a voltage drop greater than 
3% of the applied voltage.
The maximum voltage drop can be determined 
by multiplying the applied voltage by the decimal 
equivalent of 3%.
240  0.03  7.2 volts
Ohm’s law can now be used to determine the 
resistance that will permit a voltage drop of 7.2 volts 
at 100 amperes.
R  E
I  
7.2 volts
100 ampere  0.072 ohm
The length of cable between the main building 
and the workshop is 216 ft (66 m). Because current 
exists in two conductors at the same time, it is the 
same as having the conductors connected in series, 
which effectively doubles the length of the conductor. 
Therefore, the conductor length will be 432 ft (132 m).

R (ohms)
  10.4  432

  62,400
A 2 AWG copper conductor may be used. ⦁
PROBLEM 4: This problem concerns conduc-
tors used in a 3-phase system. It is to be assumed that a 
motor is located 2500 ft (762 m) from its power source 
and operates on 560 volts. When the motor starts, 
the current will be 168 amperes. The voltage drop at 
the motor terminals shall not be greater than 5% of the 
source voltage during starting. What size aluminum 
conductors should be used for this installation?
⦁ Solution: First, find the maximum voltage 
drop that can be permitted at the load by multiplying 
the source voltage by 5%.
E  560  0.05  28 volts
The second step is to determine the maximum 
amount of resistance of the conductors. To calculate

CHAPTER 6  Using Wire Tables and Determining Conductor Sizes
2 and 3 are in opposite directions and less than 
maximum. This condition is illustrated in Figure 
6-5. Notice that only two of the three phase lines are 
conducting current, and that the current in each line is 
less than maximum.
Because the phase currents in a 3-phase system 
are never maximum at the same time, and at other 
times the current is divided between two phases, the 
total conductor resistance will not be the sum of two 
conductors. To calculate the resistance of conduc-
tors in a 3-phase system, a demand factor of 0.866 
is used.
In this problem, the motor is located 2500 ft 
(762 m) from the source. The effective conductor 
length (Le) will be calculated by doubling the length 
of one conductor and then multiplying by 0.866.
Le  2500 ft  2  0.866  4330 ft
(  762 m  2  0.866  1320 m)
Now that all the factors are known, the size of 
the conductor can be calculated using the formula:
where K = 17 (ohms per mil foot for aluminum)
cmil  K  L
R
  17  4330
0.166
  443,434
Three 500 kcmil conductors will be used. ⦁
this value, the maximum voltage drop will be 
divided by the starting current of the motor.
R  E
I   28
168  0.166 ohm
The third step is to calculate the length of the 
conductors. In the previous example, the length of 
the two conductors was added together to find the 
total amount of wire resistance. In a single-phase 
system, each conductor must carry the same amount 
of current. During any period of time, one conductor 
is supplying current from the source to the load, and 
the other conductor completes the circuit by permit-
ting the same amount of current to flow from the 
load to the source.
In a balanced 3-phase circuit, there are three 
 currents that are 120° out of phase with each other, 
Figure 6-3. These three conductors share the flow of 
current between source and load. In Figure 6-3, two 
lines labeled A and B have been drawn through the 
three current waveforms. Notice that at position A, the 
current in line 1 is maximum and in a positive direction. 
The currents in lines 2 and 3 are less than maximum 
and in a negative direction. This condition corresponds 
to the example shown in Figure 6-4. Notice that the 
maximum current exists in only one conductor.
Observe the line marking position B in Figure 6-3. 
The current in line 1 is zero, and the currents in lines

 PARALLEL 
CONDUCTORS
Under certain conditions, it may become necessary 
or advantageous to connect conductors in parallel. 
One example of this condition is when conductor 
size is very large, as is the case in problem 4 in the 
previous section. In that problem, it was calculated 
that the conductors supplying a motor 2500 ft from 
its source would have to be 500 kcmil. A 500 kcmil 
conductor is very large and difficult to handle. For 
this reason, it may be preferable to use parallel 
conductors for this installation. The NEC lists five 
conditions that must be met when conductors are 
connected in parallel (310.10(H)):
 1. The conductors must be of the same length.
 2. The conductors must be made of the same 
material. It is not permissible to use copper for 
one conductor and aluminum for the others.
 3. The conductors must have the same circular 
mil area.
 4. The conductors must use the same type of 
insulation.
 5. The conductors must be terminated and con-
nected in the same manner.
In the previous problem, the actual conductor size 
needed was calculated to be 443,434 circular mils. This 
circular mil area could be obtained by connecting two 
250 kcmil conductors in parallel for each phase, or 
three 3/0 AWG conductors in parallel for each phase.
NOTE: Each 3/0 AWG conductor has an area 
of 167,800 circular mils. This is a total of 503,400 
circular mils. z
Another example of when it may be necessary 
to connect wires in parallel is when conductors of 
a large size must be run in conduit. The conduc-
tors of a single phase are not permitted to be run in 
metallic conduit, as shown in Figure 6-6 (300.5(I)
and 300.20). The reason for this is that when current 
exists in a conductor, a magnetic field is produced 
around the conductor. In an alternating current cir-
cuit, the current continuously changes direction and 
magnitude, which causes the magnetic field to cut 
through the wall of the metal conduit. This cutting

CHAPTER 6  Using Wire Tables and Determining Conductor Sizes
action of the magnetic field induces a current called 
an eddy current into the metal of the conduit. Eddy 
currents can produce enough heat in high-current 
circuits to melt the insulation surrounding the con-
ductors. All metal conduits can have eddy current 
induction, but conduits made of magnetic materials 
such as steel have an added problem with hysteresis 
loss. Hysteresis loss is caused by molecular fric-
tion. As the direction of the magnetic field reverses, 
the molecules of the metal are magnetized with the 
opposite polarity and swing to realign themselves. 
This continuous aligning and realigning of the 
molecules produces heat due to friction. Hysteresis 
losses become greater with an increase in frequency.
To correct this problem, a conductor of each 
phase must be run in each conduit, Figure 6-7. When 
all three phases are contained in a single conduit, the 
magnetic fields of the separate conductors cancel 
each other, resulting in no current being induced in 
the walls of the conduit.
 TESTING WIRE 
INSTALLATIONS
After the conductors have been installed in conduits 
or raceways, it is accepted practice to test the instal-
lation for grounds and shorts. This test requires an 
ohmmeter, which not only can measure resistance in 
millions of ohms but also can provide a high enough 
voltage to ensure that the insulation will not break 
down when rated line voltage is applied to the con-
ductors. Most ohmmeters operate with a maximum 
voltage that ranges from 1.5 to about 9 volts, depend-
ing on the type of ohmmeter and the setting of the 
range scale. To test wire insulation, a megohmmeter 
is used with a voltage from about 250 to 5000 volts, 
depending on the model of the meter and the range 
setting. One model of a megohmmeter is shown in 
Figure 6-8. This instrument contains a hand crank 
that is connected to the rotor of a brushless DC gen-
erator. The advantage of this particular instrument is 
that it does not require the use of batteries. A range 
selector switch permits the meter to be used as a 
standard ohmmeter or as a megohmmeter. When it is 
used as a megohmmeter, the selector switch permits 
the test voltage to be selected. Test voltages of 100, 
250, 500, and 1000 volts can be obtained.
A megohmmeter can also be obtained in battery-
operated models, as shown in Figure 6-9. These models 
are small, lightweight, and particularly useful when it 
becomes necessary to test the dielectric of a capacitor.
Wire installations are generally tested for two con-
ditions: shorts and grounds. Shorts are current paths 
that exist between conductors. To test an installation 
for shorts, the megohmmeter is connected across two 
conductors at a time, as shown in Figure 6-10. The 
circuit is tested at rated voltage or slightly higher.

102 
CHAPTER 6  Using Wire Tables and Determining Conductor Sizes
The megohmmeter indicates the resistance between 
the two conductors. Because both conductors are 
insulated, the resistance between them should be 
extremely high. Each conductor should be tested 
against every other conductor in the installation.
To test the installation for grounds, one lead 
of the megohmmeter is connected to the metallic 
raceway, as shown in Figure 6-11. The other meter 
lead is connected to one of the conductors. The con-
ductor should be tested at rated voltage or slightly 
higher. Each conductor should be tested.
 THE AMERICAN 
WIRE GAUGE (AWG)
The American Wire Gauge was standardized in 
1857 and is used mainly in the United States for 
the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous electrical 
wire. The gauge size is important for determining the 
 current-carrying capacity of a conductor. Gauge sizes 
are determined by the number of draws necessary to 
produce a given diameter or wire. Electrical wire is 
produced by drawing it through a succession of dies, 
Figure 6-12. Each time a wire passes through a die,

it is wrapped around a draw block several times. The

draw the wire through the die. A 24 AWG wire would 
be drawn through 24 dies, each having a smaller 
diameter. In the field, wire size can be determined

gauge lists the AWG size of the wire, Figure 6-14. 
The opposite side of the wire gauge indicates the 
diameter of the wire in thousandths of an inch, Figure 
6-15. When determining wire size, first remove the 
insulation from around the conductor. The slots in the 
wire gauge, not the holes behind the slots, are used to 
determine the size, Figure 6-16.

tance. If a display with a number larger than about 
0.55 in. (14 mm) is desired, it will generally use a 
planar gas discharge display rather than an LED dis-
play. A diagram showing a master clock with several 
display units attached is shown in Figure 7-2.
Several methods can be used to sense time in 
the master clock unit. One of the most common 
methods for many years was to use a single-phase 
synchronous motor. The speed of the synchronous 
motor is proportional to its number of poles and 
the line frequency. This method uses the 60-hertz 
line frequency to measure time. This is the same 
method often used to operate electric clocks in 
the home. Sensing the line frequency is relatively 
accurate. Clocks using this method to sense time 
A signaling circuit is any electric circuit that ener-
gizes signaling equipment. A signaling system may 
include one or more signaling circuits. For example, 
in the industrial building, there are several electrical 
systems that give recognizable visual and audible 
signals and are classified as signaling systems:
• a master clock;
• a program system;
• a paging or locating system; and
• a fire alarm system.
 THE MASTER CLOCK
The master clock is a clock designed to drive some 
number of units that display the time. The display 
units are not actually clocks themselves, but depend 
for their operation on signals received from the 
master clock. A display unit is shown in Figure 7-1. 
This type of display unit uses light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs) to indicate the time, rather than an analog 
display using numbers and hands. These types of 
displays are generally designed to accommodate 
large-size LEDs that can be seen from a long dis-

are generally accurate to within a couple of minutes 
per month.
Another method that has become popular is the 
sensing of vibrations produced by a piece of quartz 
crystal. When an AC voltage is impressed across two 
faces of the crystal, it will resonate at some specific 
frequency. This resonant frequency is extremely 
constant and therefore can be used to accurately 
measure time. The frequency at which the quartz 
will resonate is inversely proportional to the size 
of the crystal. The smaller the crystal, the higher 
the resonant frequency will be. The shape of the 
crystal also plays a part in determining the resonant 
frequency. Quartz clocks are generally accurate to 
within 1 second per month.
The clock in this installation is shown in Figure 7-3. 
This master clock senses time by receiving a radio 
signal from WWV, a radio station that broadcasts 
time pulses. WWV is operated by the National 
Bureau of Standards and is used as a time standard 
throughout the United States. A cesium beam atomic 
clock is used to produce the pulses that are transmit-
ted. WWV can be received on frequencies of 18, 20, 
and 60 kHz, and on frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 
20, and 25 MHz. At the beginning of each minute, 
a 1000 Hz signal is transmitted, except at the begin-
ning of each hour, when a 1500 Hz signal is trans-
mitted. The clock in this installation contains a radio 
receiver capable of receiving WWV pulses. The tim-
ing of the clock depends on the pulses received, and 
in this way, the time clock is continually updated 
each minute.
The clock also contains a battery and battery 
charger. The battery is used to provide power to the 
clock in the event of a power failure. The battery can 
operate the clock for a period of at least 12 hours. 
During this time, the displays will be turned off to 
conserve battery power, but the clock continues to 
operate. The master clock also can be set to operate 
in a 12- or 24-hour mode.
 THE PROGRAM 
SYSTEM
The program system is used to provide automatic 
signals for the operation of horns, bells, and buzz-
ers. These devices are used in industry to signal the 
beginning and ending of shifts, lunch periods, and 
breaks. Different parts of the plant operate on dif-
ferent time schedules. Office workers, for example, 
begin and end work at different times than employ-
ees who work in the manufacturing area of the plant. 
Lunch and coffee break times also vary. For this 
reason, the program control system must be capable 
of providing different signals to different parts of the 
plant at the proper times.
The program controller used in this installa-
tion is shown in Figure 7-4. This controller is a 
microprocessor-based programmable timer. This 
unit has thirty-two separate output channels and 
can be programmed for up to 1000 events. Each 
channel contains a normally open reed relay. Each 
relay can be operated by momentary contact or 
latching, or the unit can be set so that there can be 
sixteen of each. A simple modification will permit 
sixteen double-pole relays to be used instead of 
thirty-two single-pole relays. The 1000 events can 
be entered into the unit randomly as opposed to 
entering them in chronological order. Cyclic events 
can be programmed to occur every minute, hour, 
day, or week, or in any combination desired. Any of 
the thirty-two output channels can be turned on at 
the same time.
Programming is done with a twelve-button 
keyboard located on the front of the unit. The 
 keyboard contains numbers 0 through 9, and

CLEAR and ENTER buttons. Two toggle switches, 
also located on the front of the panelboard, are 
used to provide active/disable and run/enter func-
tions. These switches permit programmed events 
to be viewed without interrupting the program. 
Once the timer has been programmed, it is pos-
sible to save the program on a cassette tape. This 
is done by connecting a cassette tape recorder to a 
jack provided on the rear of the timer. If for some 
reason the timer should have to be replaced, the 
same program can be loaded into the new unit 
from the cassette tape. This saves the time of hav-
ing to reprogram the unit.
The program timer also contains a digital clock. 
The clock is operated by an internal crystal oscilla-
tor. A battery and battery charger are provided with 
the unit in case of power failure. With the addition of 
a serial time code generator, the program timer also 
can be used as a master clock. The time code genera-
tor gives the unit the capability of driving up to 100 
display units.
 THE PAGING 
SYSTEM
In many industrial installations, it is important to 
convey messages to all areas of the plant. When 
selecting a paging system, several factors should be 
taken into consideration, such as these:
 1. What is the amount of area to be covered and 
the number of paging units needed?
 2. The design of the system should permit expan-
sion as the plant increases in size.
 3. Should the paging system be voice, tone, or a 
combination of both?
 4. Do areas of the plant require explosionproof 
or weatherproof equipment?
 5. What is the ambient noise level of the plant?
A very important consideration when choos-
ing the type of equipment to be used is the ambi-
ent, or surrounding, noise level. The chart shown 
in Figure 7-5 illustrates different levels of noise 
measured in decibels (dB). For a signal or voice 
to be heard, it should be at least 5 decibels louder 
than the surrounding noise level at the workstation. 
Another important consideration is the distance of 
the speaker from the workstation. As a general rule, 
sound decreases by 6 decibels each time the distance 
from the speaker is doubled.

10 ft (3 m), and decreases 6 decibels each time the 
distance is doubled. At a distance of 160 ft (49 m), 
the sound level should be 86 decibels. This is loud 
enough to permit the worker to hear the voice or tone.
The paging system chosen for this plant is 
manufactured by Audiosone Inc. It has the capabil-
ity of producing both voice and tone signals. Two 
types of paging units will be used. The first type can 
be used to send voice messages only. The second 
type, shown in Figure 7-7, can send both voice and 
tone messages. Each paging unit contains its own 
PROBLEM: A speaker is rated to produce 110 
decibels at a distance of 10 ft (3 m). The ambient 
noise level at the workstation is measured at 80 
decibels. If the speaker is mounted 160 ft (49 m) 
away from the workstation, will the worker be able 
to clearly hear the messages?

sound decrease with distance. Notice that the chart

parallel to a 4-conductor circuit. The system also 
can be expanded to use a voice evacuation alarm, 
shown in Figure 7-9. This unit permits taped mes-
sages to be used, which can instruct employees as to 
the nature of the emergency.

The tones are to be used to announce different 
conditions. One is to be used as a fire signal and 
will be connected to the fire alarm system. The other 
three tones can be used to announce such conditions 
as plant evacuation, shift change, and so on. Two 
types of speakers will be used, Figure 7-10. These 
speakers will be located at strategic points through-
out the plant. ⦁
 THE FIRE ALARM 
SYSTEM
The fire alarm is part of a digital automation and 
control system manufactured by Jensen Electric 
Co. This system was chosen because of its flex-
ibility and expansion capability. The central control 
unit (CCU) is a modern desktop computer. The 
processor, Figure 7-11, provides communication 
interface between the CCU and the system control-
lers. This system permits any number of processors 
(up to 100) to be connected to the CCU. The power 
equipment of the processor is 24 volts DC, which 
is provided by an uninterruptible power supply, 
Figure 7-12. The uninterruptible power supply pro-
duces a regulated 24 volts DC from a 120-volt AC, 
60-hertz supply line. Two 12-volt lead acid storage 
batteries are contained inside the power supply. If 
the incoming AC power should fail, the lead acid 
batteries continue to provide power to the system. 
This ensures that control power to critical systems is 
maintained during a power failure.
The controller, Figure 7-13, is an intelligent 
device that provides interface between the control 
modules and the processor. Each processor can 
handle up to 100 controllers. Each controller can

contain up to four interface modules, Figure 7-14. 
This system can operate with only one input/output 
(I/O) point or with as many as 640,000.
The type of interface module used determines the 
system control function. Modules can be obtained 
that permit the system to be used for motor control, 
burglar alarm, ground-fault detection, or to interface 
with television cameras. Some modules permit ana-
log input and output signals that operate from 0 to

input and output modules are shown in Figure 7-15.
Each fire alarm module contains a momentary 
contact switch located on the front cover. This 
switch permits the alarm to be operated automati-
cally or manually, or to be tested. Each module con-
tains three LEDs. The green LED indicates normal 
circuit operation. A red LED indicates that a fire has 
been detected, and a yellow LED indicates trouble

with the system. The conductor sizes and types for 
the alarm system are sized to meet the requirements 
of 725.1 (Informational note), and conduit size is 
determined in accordance with 725.31(B).
The fire alarm system uses a combination 
of smoke detectors, Figure 7-16, and manual 
pull handles, Figure 7-17. Once the manual pull

handles have been used, they must be reset with a 
key. The smoke detector, manufactured by Whelen 
Engineering Co., is powered by a separate 120-volt 
AC source and contains an internal horn that pro-
duces 86 decibels at 10 ft (3 m). This permits the 
smoke detector to be used in office areas without 
the addition of a separate audible alarm. An LED 
located on the front cover flashes every 4 sec-
onds to indicate the detector is in working order. 
If smoke is detected, the LED will emit a steady 
glow.
When a fire condition is detected, two alarm 
devices are activated. The first is one of the 
tones produced by the paging system. The sec-
ond is a high-intensity strobe light that produces 
75  flashes per minute, Figure 7-18. The strobe 
light is powered directly by the smoke detector in 
office areas. The fire alarm system is programmed 
so that when a fire is detected, all of the audible 
alarms produced by the paging system are acti-
vated. Not all of the strobe lights are activated, 
however. Only the strobe lights located in the area 
of the detected fire are permitted to flash. A basic 
line drawing of the fire alarm system is shown in 
Figure 7-19.

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls 
121
Anyone working as an electrician in industry should 
be able to connect and troubleshoot basic motor con-
trol circuits. Control circuits are used to start, stop, 
accelerate, decelerate, and protect motors. They may 
also consist of a number of sensing devices such as 
limit switches, float switches, push buttons, flow 
switches, pressure switches, temperature switches, 
and so on, that tell the circuit what action is to be 
performed. Motor control circuits can be divided 
into two major categories: 2 wire and 3 wire.
 TWO-WIRE 
CONTROLS
Two-wire control circuits are the simplest. Two-wire 
controls basically consist of a switch used to con-
nect or disconnect power to the motor, Figure 8-1. 
Many manual-type starters are designed as 2-wire 
controllers. Motor starters contain both a means to 
connect and disconnect the motor to and from the 
power source and also provide overload protec-
tion for the motor. Overload protection should not 
be confused with fuse or circuit protection. Fuses 
and circuit breakers protect the circuit from some 
types of high-current condition such as shorts and 
grounds. Overload  protection is designed to protect 
the motor from an overload condition. Assume, 
for example, that a motor has a full-load current 
rating of 10 amperes. Also assume that the motor 
is connected to a 20-ampere circuit. If the motor 
should become overloaded and the current increase 
to 15 amperes, the circuit breaker would never trip 
or the fuse never blow because the current draw is 
below the 20-ampere rating. The motor, however, 
will probably be damaged or destroyed because of 
the excessive current. Overloads are intended to 
open the circuit when the current exceeds the full-
load current rating of the motor by 115% to 125%.
A single-phase manual starter with overload pro-
tection is shown in Figure 8-2. The starter resembles 
a single-pole switch with the addition of overload 
protection. A schematic diagram of the single-phase 
manual starter is shown in Figure 8-3.
A 3-phase manual starter, Figure 8-4, operates in 
a similar manner to the single-phase manual starter 
except that it provides three sets of contacts and three 
overloads. The starter is so designed that an overload 
on any phase of the 3-phase system will cause all 
three contacts to open. A schematic diagram of a 
3-phase manual starter is shown in Figure 8-5.

 THREE-WIRE 
CONTROLS
The designation 3-wire control comes from the fact 
that three wires are run from a set of start–stop push 
buttons to a motor starter. Three-wire controls are 
characterized by the fact that they use magnetic con-
tactors and starters. A magnetic contactor or relay 
is basically an electrical solenoid that closes a set 
of contacts when the coil is energized, Figure 8-6. 
A relay similar to the one illustrated in Figure 8-6 
is shown in Figure 8-7. The terms used to describe 
motor control components can often be confusing. 
The term relay refers to a magnetically operated 
switch that contains small or auxiliary contacts. 
Auxiliary contacts are used as part of the control 
circuit and are not intended to connect a load to the 
line. Contactors contain large load contacts that are 
intended to handle large amounts of current. Load 
contacts are used to connect loads such as motors 
or other high-current devices to the power line. 
Contactors may or may not also contain  auxiliary

Figure 8-10A. If the contact is to be drawn normally 
closed, it is drawn so that the movable contact is above 
and touching the stationary contact, Figure 8-10B. 
There are some instances where a contact must be 
connected normally open, but when the circuit is not 
in operation, the contact is being held closed. A good 
example of this is the low-pressure switch on many 
air-conditioning circuits. The pressure in the system 
holds the contact closed. If the refrigerant should 
leak out, the reduced pressure will cause the switch 
to reopen and stop the operation of the compressor. 
A normally open held closed switch is drawn with the 
movable contact below but touching the stationary 
contact, Figure 8-10C. The switch is normally open 
because the movable contact is drawn below the sta-
tionary contact. It is held closed because the movable 
contact is touching the stationary contact.
A normally closed held open switch can be 
drawn in a similar manner, Figure 8-10D. The 
contacts. Motor starters are contactors that are 
equipped with overload protection for a motor, 
Figure 8-8. Combination starters contain the fused 
disconnect or circuit breaker, control transformer, 
and motor starter in one enclosure, Figure 8-9.
 SCHEMATIC 
SYMBOLS
Schematic and wiring diagrams are the written lan-
guage of motor controls. To understand these draw-
ings, it is helpful to understand some of the symbols 
employed when control diagrams are drawn. 
Although there is no set standard for drawing motor 
control symbols, the most commonly accepted are 
those used by the National Electrical Manufacturers 
Association (NEMA). When reading control sche-
matics, all switch and contact symbols are drawn to 
indicate their position when the circuit is turned off 
or not operating. This is called the normal position 
for that contact or switch.
Switch contacts can be drawn as normally open 
(NO), normally closed (NC), normally open held 
closed (NOHC), or normally closed held open 
(NCHO). When a switch is to be shown as normally 
open, it is drawn so that the movable contact is 
shown below and not touching the stationary  contact,

and overload protection for motors.

a line. The flat portion of the symbol represents a 
diaphragm used to sense pressure. A temperature 
switch or thermostat is indicated by drawing a zig-
zag line that represents a bimetal helix that expands 
and contracts with a change of temperature.
Normally open contact symbols are shown as 
parallel lines with connecting wires, Figure 8-13. 
Normally closed contact symbols are the same, with 
the exception that a diagonal line is drawn through 
the two parallel lines. Contacts are always shown 
in the de-energized or off position.
Another very common schematic symbol is the 
push button. Normally open push buttons are shown 
with the movable contact above and not touching 
the two stationary contacts, Figure 8-14. The sym-
bol indicates that when finger pressure is applied 
switch is normally closed because the movable con-
tact is shown above the stationary contact. It is being 
held open because the movable contact is not touch-
ing the stationary contact.
Other symbols are added to switch symbols to 
indicate a particular type of switch. A limit switch, 
for example, is shown with a wedge drawn below the 
movable contact. The wedge represents the bumper 
arm of the limit switch. Limit switch symbols are 
shown in Figure 8-11. Other symbols are used to 
indicate different types of switches (Figure 8-12). 
A float switch, for example, uses a circle drawn on 
the bottom of a line. The circle represents a ball float. 
A flow switch uses a flag drawn on a line to repre-
sent the paddle that detects air or liquid flow. A pres-
sure switch is drawn by connecting a semicircle to

bridges the gap between the two stationary contacts. 
Normally closed push-button symbols are drawn 
with the movable contact below and touching the 
stationary contacts. When pressure is applied to the 
movable contact, it travels downward and breaks 
the connection between the two stationary contacts. 
Another very common push-button symbol is the 
double- acting push button. Double-acting push but-
tons contain both normally open and normally closed 
contacts with one movable contact, Figure 8-15.
Control circuits often require push buttons that 
contain multiple contacts. When this is the case, a 
stacked push button can be employed. Stacked push 
buttons are so designed that different contact sets 
can be connected that are controlled by a single push

an overload condition occurs. The  overload relay 
contains a set of normally closed auxiliary contacts 
that are connected in series with the coil of the motor 
starter. If an overload condition occurs, the contacts 
open and disconnect power to the coil of the motor 
starter. This causes the load contacts on the starter to 
open and disconnect the motor from the power line.
The current-sensing section of the overload relay 
can be magnetic, electronic, or thermal. Magnetic over-
load relays operate by connecting a current coil in series 
with the motor, Figure 8-18. If the motor current should 
become excessive, the magnetic field will become strong 
enough to cause the normally closed auxiliary contacts 
to open and de-energize the coil of the motor starter.

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls
Thermal overload relays are by far the most 
common. Thermal overload relays operate by con-
necting a heater element in series with the motor, 
Figure 8-20. The temperature of the heater is depen-
dent on motor current and the ambient temperature. 
There are two types of thermal overload relays, the 
solder pot type and the bimetal strip type.
The solder pot–type overload relay works by 
placing a brass shaft inside a brass tube. A serrated 
wheel is attached to the brass shaft, Figure 8-21. 
Solder is used to bond the brass shaft to the brass 
tube. A lever arm between the contacts and serrated 
wheel holds the contacts in place, Figure 8-22. If the 
motor current becomes excessive, the heater will melt 
the solder and permit the serrated wheel to turn, caus-
ing the normally closed auxiliary contacts to open.
The bimetal strip–type overload uses a bimetal 
strip to open the normally closed auxiliary contacts 
if the motor current becomes excessive, Figure 8-23. 
There are other differences between the solder pot–
type and bimetal strip–type overload relay. Bimetal 
One-piece thermal unit
Solder pot (heat sensitive
element) is an integral part of
the thermal unit. It provides
accurate response to overload
current, yet prevents nuisance
tripping.
Heating winding (heat producing
element) is permanently joined to
the solder pot, ensuring proper heat
transfer and preventing misalignment
in the field.

strip–type overload relays generally permit the trip 
current to be adjusted to between 85 and 115% of 
the heater rating, Figure 8-24. Another difference 
is that bimetal strip–type overloads can generally 
be set to permit the contacts to reset automatically 
or manually after the bimetal strip has cooled suffi-
ciently, Figure 8-25. Generally, the relay is adjusted 
for manual reset. Automatic reset should be used 
only if the sudden starting of a motor will not cause 
danger to personnel or damage equipment.
Regardless of the type of thermal overload relay 
used, the trip current of the relay is set by the size of 
the heater used with the relay. Manufacturers make 
different-sized heaters that are designed to open the 
contacts at different current levels. A chart provided 
by the manufacturer of the relay can be used to 
select the proper heater for a particular application.
When three single-phase overload relays are 
employed to protect a 3-phase motor, the three aux-
iliary overload contacts are connected in series, as 
shown in Figure 8-26. With this type of connection, 
if one relay should trip, the motor starter coil is dis-
connected from the power line. Three-phase overload 
relays, Figure 8-27, contain three separate heaters

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls 
133
Although all overload relays contain a set of nor-
mally closed contacts, some manufacturers include a 
set of normally open contacts as well. There are two 
arrangements for normally open overload relay con-
tacts. One arrangement contains two separate contacts, 
one normally open and the other normally closed. The 
second is basically a single-pole double-throw switch. 
The contacts contain a common terminal, a normally 
closed terminal, and a normally open terminal. The 
normally open terminal is sometimes labeled in some 
manner other than normally open. The overload 
relay shown in Figure 8-29 contains three terminals 
labeled COM. (common), OL. (overload), and ALAR. 
(alarm). The common terminal is connected to one 
side of the power supply for the control circuit. The 
overload terminal is connected in series with the coil 
of the motor starter, and the alarm terminal is con-
nected to a pilot lamp, Figure 8-30. The pilot lamp 
indicates that the overload relay has tripped.
Another common method used for the normally 
open contacts is to supply power to the coil of a 
small control relay, Figure 8-31. The contact of the 
control relay can provide power to the input of a 
programmable logic controller. If the overload relay 
should trip, a signal is provided to the PLC to inform 
the circuit that the motor has tripped on overload. 
but only one set of overload contacts. If an overload 
occurs on any phase, it will open the normally closed 
contacts. When a 3-phase overload relay is used, 
only one set of normally closed contacts is connected 
in series with the starter coil, Figure 8-28.

the components with connecting wires. Schematic 
diagrams are by far the more widely used in  industry. 
There are several rules that should be followed when 
reading a schematic diagram:
• All electrical components are shown in their off 
or de-energized position.
• Schematics should be read like a book, from 
top to bottom and from left to right.
• Contacts that contain the same letter or number 
as a coil are controlled by that coil regardless of 
where they are located in the drawing.
• When a circuit is completed to a coil, that coil 
will energize, and all contacts controlled by that 
coil will change position. All normally open 
contacts will close and all normally closed con-
tacts will open.
Interposing relays are used to prevent more than 
one power source from entering the control system 
either at the motor starter or at the PLC.
 SCHEMATICS AND 
WIRING DIAGRAMS
Schematic or ladder diagrams and wiring diagrams 
both show electrical connections, but they differ 
greatly in appearance. The drawing in Figure 8-32 
shows a schematic or ladder diagram and a wir-
ing diagram of a start–stop push-button control. 
Although both of these circuits are  identical electri-
cally, they are different in appearance. Schematic

sequence without regard for physical location.

 START–STOP PUSH-
BUTTON CONTROL 
CIRCUIT
The start–stop push-button control circuit is 
often the beginning of more complex circuits. This 
circuit is often referred to as the basic circuit. To 
understand the operation of the circuit, refer to the 
schematic shown in Figure 8-33. Note that there are 
four normally open contacts labeled with the let-
ter M. Also note that the coil of the motor starter is 
labeled with the letter M. This indicates that all the 
contacts that are labeled with an M are controlled by 
the coil labeled M. When the start button is pressed, 
Figure 8-34, a circuit is completed to M coil. When 
coil M energizes, all M contacts change from open 
to closed, Figure 8-35. The small auxiliary M con-
tact connected in parallel with the start push button 
closes to maintain the circuit to the coil when the 
push button is released. This contact is generally 
referred to as a hold, sealing, or maintaining contact, 
because it holds the circuit closed after the start but-
ton is released. The three load contacts labeled M 
close and connect the motor to the power line. The 
circuit will remain in operation until the stop but-

the normally closed overload contacts to open, 
breaking the circuit to M coil, Figure 8-36. When 
coil M de-energizes, all M contacts return to their 
open position, and the circuit is back to its original 
 de-energized state.

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls
 FORWARD–REVERSE 
CONTROL
Another very common control circuit found 
throughout industry is the forward–reverse control. 
Three-phase motors can be reversed by changing 
any two stator leads. Forward–reverse controls also 
employ interlocking to prevent both the forward 
and reverse coils from being energized at the same 
time. A typical forward–reverse control is shown 
in Figure  8-37. The dashed lines drawn from the 
F and R coils to a single line indicate mechani-
cal interlocking. Mechanical interlocks are used 
to prevent both forward and reverse contactors 
from being energized at the same time. When one 
contactor is energized, a mechanism prevents the 
other from being able to close its contacts even if 
the coil should be energized. Electrical interlocking 
is accomplished by using the two normally closed 
auxiliary contacts connected in series with F and 
R coils, Figure 8-38. Note that the normally closed 
F contact is connected in series with the R contactor 
coil, and the normally closed R contact is connected 
in series with the F contactor coil.
When the forward push button is pressed, a 
circuit is completed through the normally closed 
R contact to the F coil. When F coil energizes, all 
F contacts change position, Figure 8-39. The three

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls
F load contacts close and connect the motor to 
the power line, causing the motor to run in what 
is considered the forward direction. The normally 
open F auxiliary contact connected in parallel 
with the forward push button closes to maintain 
the circuit when F push button is released. The 
normally closed F contact connected in series 
with R coil opens. This would prevent R coil from 
energizing if the reverse push button were to be 
pressed.
Before the motor can be operated in reverse, 
the stop push button must be pressed to break 
the circuit to F coil. When F coil de-energizes, 
all F contacts return to their normal positions, as 
shown in Figure 8-37. When the reverse push but-
ton is pressed, a circuit is completed through the 
now closed F auxiliary contact to R coil. When 
R coil energizes, all R contacts change position, 
Figure  8-40. The three R load contacts close and 
connect the motor to the power line. Note that the 
connections for L1 and L3 that go to the motor have 
been reversed. This causes the motor to operate in 
the reverse direction. Also note that the normally 
closed R auxiliary contact connected in series 
with F coil is now open, preventing a circuit from 
being established to F coil if the forward push but-
ton should be pressed. The wiring diagram of a 
 forward–reverse control circuit with electrical inter-
locks is shown in Figure 8-41.
 BASIC AIR-
CONDITIONING 
CIRCUIT
A basic circuit for a central air-conditioning sys-
tem is shown in Figure 8-42. The circuit ensures 
that the condenser fan is in operation before the 
compressor is permitted to start. A flow switch is 
used to sense the airflow caused by the condenser 
fan. The compressor is also protected from low 
pressure and high pressure by pressure switches. 
Both the condenser fan and compressor are also 
protected from overload by overload relays. A ther-
mostat is used to control the operation of the cir-
cuit. A transformer is used to step the 240 volts of 
line voltage down to 24 volts for operation of the 
control circuit.
 TIMING RELAYS
One of the basic control components found in many 
control circuits is the timing relay. Timing relays 
can be divided into two general types, on delay and 
off delay. On-delay relays are sometimes noted as 
DOE (delay on energize), and off-delay times are 
sometimes noted as DODE (delay on de-energize). 
The contact symbols for on- and off-delay timers 
are shown in Figure 8-43. The arrow on the symbol 
points in the direction that the contacts will move 
after the delay period.
On-Delay Timers
The contacts of an on-delay timer delay 
changing their position after the timer has been 
energized. The contacts return to their normal 
position immediately when the timer is de-ener-
gized. Refer to the circuit shown in Figure 8-44. 
Assume that on-delay timer TR is set for a delay 
of 10 seconds. When switch S1 is closed, the coil 
of timer TR is energized. TR contacts, controlled 
by coil TR, remain open for a period of 10 seconds 
before closing. After the contacts have closed 
and turned on the green pilot lamp, they remain 
closed until the coil of timer TR is  de-energized. 
When the coil of TR is  de- energized, the TR 
contacts return to their normally open condition 
immediately.
Off-Delay Timers
The contacts of an off-delay timer change imme-
diately when the timer is energized. They remain in 
their energized state for some period of time after 
the timer is de-energized. Refer to the circuit shown 
in Figure 8-45. Assume that off-delay timer TR is set 
for a delay of 10 seconds. When switch S1 is closed, 
the coil of timer TR is energized. TR contacts, con-
trolled by coil TR, close immediately and turn on the 
amber lamp. When switch S1 is opened, and TR coil

A Timer Circuit for Two Motors
The circuit shown in Figure 8-46 involves two 
motors. The circuit functions as follows:
• When the start button is pressed, motor 1 starts 
running immediately.
• There is a delay of 10 seconds before motor 2 
starts running.
• When the stop button is pressed, motor 1 stops 
immediately, but motor 2 continues to run for 
5 seconds before stopping.

• An emergency stop button will stop both motors 
immediately without a time delay.
• If the emergency stop button is pressed, the 
reset button must be pressed before the circuit 
will operate again.
• An overload on either motor will stop both

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls
power is connected to motor starter coil M1. All M1 
contacts change position. The three load contacts 
connected to motor 1 close and supply power to 
motor 1. The M1 auxiliary contact in parallel with 
the start button maintains the circuit when the stop 
button is released. The M1 auxiliary contact con-
nected in series with timer coil TR1 closes to sup-
ply power to the timer. Timer TR1 begins timing. 
The M1 auxiliary contact connected in series with 
timer TR2 closes, but a circuit is not completed 
to coil TR2 because auxiliary contact M2 is open, 
Figure 8-47.
After a delay of 10 seconds, TR1 contact closes 
and energizes the coil of M2 starter, causing all M2 
contacts to change position. The three load contacts 
close and supply power to motor 2. The M2 auxil-
iary contact connected in series with timer coil TR2 
closes and supplies power to timer TR2. Because 
TR2 is an off-delay timer, TR2 contact closes imme-
diately, Figure 8-48. Both motors are now running.
When the stop button is pressed, the circuit to 
M1 coil is open and all M1 contacts return to their 
normal position. The three M1 load contacts open 
and disconnect power to motor 1. The M1 auxiliary 
contact connected in series with timer coil TR1 
opens and de-energizes the timer. Because TR1 is 
an on-delay timer, TR1 contact opens immediately. 
The circuit is maintained to motor starter coil M2 
by the now closed TR2 contact. The M1 auxiliary 
contact connected in series with timer TR2 opens

and de-energizes the timer. Because TR2 is an off-
delay timer, the time delay begins when the timer is 
de-energized, Figure 8-49.
After a delay of 5 seconds, contact TR2 returns 
to its normally open state causing starter coil M2 to 
de-energize and stop motor 2. The M2 auxiliary con-
tact connected in series with timer TR2 opens and 
the circuit is back to its original de-energized state.
Capacitor Discharge Timers
Time delay relays achieve a time delay in differ-
ent ways. Some use a capacitive discharge, whereas 
others employ air. Clock timers are common as 
well as electronic timers. Capacitive discharge tim-
ers are generally used with direct-current control 
systems that operate at on-line voltage. If a capaci-
tor is connected in parallel with the coil of a relay, 
Figure 8-50, when the switch is closed, the capacitor 
will charge to the voltage applied to the coil.

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls
When the switch is opened, the capacitor 
discharges through the relay coil. The relay con-
tacts remain in their energized position until the 
capacitor voltage drops below the point that the 
magnetic field of the coil can resist the spring 
tension trying to de-energize the relay. The spring 
tension of the relay can be adjusted so that more 
or less current is required to de-energize the relay. 
Capacitors discharge at an exponential rate. If 
the spring tension is set to the amount of current 
necessary to resist the spring force to position I1 in 
Figure 8-51, then the time delay will be T1. If the 
spring tension is readjusted so that the current can 
resist the spring force to position I2, the time delay 
will be T2. A capacitor discharge timer is shown in 
Figure 8-52.
Pneumatic Timers
Pneumatic, or air, timers depend on the flow of 
air through an orifice to a bellows or diaphragm, 
to achieve a time delay. Figure 8-53 illustrates the 
operation of a simple bellows timer.
When the relay is energized, rod A pushes 
against the bellows and causes air to be forced out 
of the check valve. Contact TR closes when the bel-
lows contracts. Rod A remains against the bellows 
as long as the relay is energized. When the relay is 
de-energized, rod A moves away. The spring forces 
the bellows to expand, but air must flow into the 
bellows through the air inlet for expansion to be

 possible. A needle valve regulates the time neces-
sary for the bellows to expand. When the bellows 
expands, contact TR again opens. Pneumatic tim-
ers have good repeat accuracy, and many can be 
adjusted for seconds or minutes. Some timers can be 
set to operate as either on delay or off delay. A pneu-
matic timer is shown in Figure 8-54.

CHAPTER 8  Basic Motor Controls 
147
Clock Timers
Clock timers employ the used of a small synchro-
nous motor similar to those used in electric wall clocks. 
The time can vary greatly from one timer to another. 
Some may have a range of 1 second or less, and others 
may have a range of hours. Some have the ability to 
provide a wide range of delay timers by changing gear 
ratios inside the timer. Clock timers are generally very 
easy to set the time delay and have very good repeat 
accuracy. A clock timer is shown in Figure 8-55.
Electronic Timers
Electronic timers have become very popular 
because they have excellent repeat accuracy; most 
can be set for a wide range of time delay; and they are 
much less expensive than other types of  timers. Many 
are designed to fit into some type of plug socket, which 
makes replacing a defective timer fast and simple. An 
8-pin on-delay timer is shown in Figure 8-56. Because 
on-delay timers begin their timing when power is 
applied, only 8 pins are needed. When power is applied 
to pins 2 and 7, the time sequence begins. When the 
timer is  de- energized, the time is reset to zero.
Multifunction timers can generally be employed 
as on delay, off delay, interval, one shot, or repeat, 
Figure 8-57. These timers generally require an 11-pin 
socket base. Certain functions, such as off delay and 
one shot, require that constant power be connected

to the timer at all times in order for the timing cir-
cuit to operate. A separate method of triggering the 
timer must be used. The pin connection for the timer 
shown in Figure 8-57 is shown in Figure 8-58.
Note that power is connected to pins 2 and 10. 
If the timer is to be used as an on-delay or repeat 
timer, all that is necessary is to apply power to pins 
2 and 10. If the timer is to be used as an off-delay or 
one-shot timer, it must be triggered. To use this timer 
as an off-delay timer, power must be continuously 
applied to pins 2 and 10. Activation of the timer will 
not begin until pins 5 and 6 are shorted together. This 
has the same effect as energizing the coil of a com-
mon off-delay timer. When pins 5 and 6 are shorted 
together, the timer contacts change position imme-
diately. As long as pins 5 and 6 are shorted together, 
the contacts will remain in their energized position. 
When the short is removed, the time sequence will 
begin, and the contacts will not return to their nor-
mal position until the set time has expired.
Other manufacturers may employ different 
methods of controlling an electronic multifunction 
timer. The diagram in Figure 8-59 indicates that 
the timer is started by connecting pin 6 to pin 2. 
The diagram of another timer shown in Figure 8-60 
indicates that the timer is triggered when 120 VAC is 
applied to pins 5 and 7.
Because different manufacturers employ differ-
ent methods of controlling a multifunction timer, care 
must be taken when replacing a defective timer with 
a new one. If the manufacturers are different, it may 
require modifying the circuit to accommodate the pin

arrangement of the new timer or finding a timer with 
the same pin arrangement as the one being replaced.
Interval Timer
The following descriptions of operations are 
for the timer shown in Figure 8-57 and the pin 
 configuration shown in Figure 8-58. It is assumed 
that a time delay of 2 seconds is set for each illus-
tration. An interval timer does not depend on trig-
gering the timer by shorting pins 5 and 6. The time 
sequence starts when power is applied to pins 2 
and 10. A schematic diagram of the circuit is shown 
in Figure 8-61. When switch S1 is closed, the indi-
cator lamp lights immediately for a period of 2 sec-
onds and then turns off. It remains off until switch 
S1 is opened.
One-Shot Timer
The one-shot timer is very similar to the interval 
timer. It operates basically the same way except that 
the trigger is used to active the timer. When switch 
S1 is closed the indicator lamp will not turn on. 
When the timer is triggered by shorting pins 5 and 
6 together, the indicator lamp turns on for 2 seconds 
and then turns off. If the trigger circuit is opened, 
the timer remains off until the timer is triggered 
again.
Repeat Timer
The repeat timer does not require the use of 
the trigger. When switch S1 is closed, the indicator 
lamp remains off for 2 seconds. It then turns on for 
2 s econds. It will continue to turn on for 2 seconds 
and off for 2 seconds until switch S1 is opened.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers 
153
Chapters 3 and 5 of this text detailed the method of 
distributing power to the various machines in the 
manufacturing area of the industrial building. Recall 
that plug-in busway is installed throughout the plant, 
and bus plugs are installed at selected points. With 
the use of rubber cord drops to each machine, power 
is supplied to the motor branch circuit that operates 
each machine.
 THE MACHINES 
AND THEIR MOTORS
Sheet E-2 of the industrial building plans shows the 
layout of the 111 machines in the manufacturing 
area. The various types of machines are identified by 
a code number, as shown in the following list.

Special Machines
Each of these machines has a 3-phase motor 
rated at 460 volts. The current required by each 
motor is based on the horsepower rating of the 
motor. The current can be determined by the follow-
ing equation:
Amperes 
Hp  746
Volts  1.73  Eff.  PF
where 
Hp  horsepower
  
1.73  the square root of 3
  
Eff.  the assumed efficiency
  
PF  the power factor (estimated)
  
746  watts per horsepower
By applying this equation to the engine lathes 
(MA), the current required can be determined.
Amperes 
5  746
460  1.73  0.82  0.86  6.64
The efficiency of 82% and the power factor of 
86% were taken from Table 9-1. Note that larger 
motors may have slightly higher efficiencies, whereas 
smaller motors usually have lower power factors and 
lower efficiencies. The values used in the equation are 
the assumed values at full load. When the motor is 
less than fully loaded, the values are much lower.
When the conductors to a motor are being 
selected, 430.6(A) requires that the values given 
in NEC Tables 430.247, 430.248, 430.249, and 
430.250 (reproduced in this book as Tables 9-1 
through 9-4) be used in place of the actual full-load 
current of the motor, as determined by the equa-
tion given previously. Thus, for a 5-horsepower, 
460-volt, 3-phase motor (look ahead to Table 10-4), 
a full-load current of 7.6 amperes is used to deter-
mine conductor sizes rather than the value of 6.64 
amperes as calculated.
 MOTOR TYPES
Several different types of motors having entirely 
different characteristics or patterns of performance 
are required for the various machine tools. One of 
the most commonly used motors is the squirrel-cage 
type. Refer to Figure 9-1 for a listing of motor con-
trol symbols.
 SINGLE-SPEED 
SQUIRREL-CAGE 
INDUCTION MOTOR
The squirrel-cage type of induction motor does not 
have a conventional rotor winding. Instead, the lami-
nated steel rotor has copper or aluminum bars that 
run axially around the periphery of the rotor. These 
bars are short-circuited by copper or aluminum end 
rings. When aluminum is used for the assembly, the 
bars and end rings are usually cast in one piece.
Three-phase squirrel-cage motors have a good 
starting torque, and their performance character-
istics make them an ideal motor for general use. 
Figure 9-2 is a cutaway view of a 3-phase squirrel-
cage motor.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
An induction motor is much like a transformer, 
except that the secondary winding and core are 
mounted on a shaft set in bearings. This arrange-
ment permits the secondary winding to rotate (hence 
the name rotor). An induction motor consists of two 
electrical circuits (the stator and the rotor) linked by a 
common magnetic circuit. Electric current applied to 
the stator winding induces a secondary current in the 
rotor winding. This winding is a closed circuit, either 
a short-circuit or nearly so. The induced current in 
the secondary always flows in a direction opposite to 
that of the applied current. In addition, the induced 
current lags 90° or one-quarter cycle behind the 
applied current. Magnetic fields are set up in the sta-
tor and rotor in a manner that gives rise to attracting 
and repelling forces. Because these forces are in the 
same direction (either clockwise or counterclock-
wise), a torque is produced and rotation results.
For example, Figure 9-3 shows that the north 
and south poles of the induction motor stator rotate 
at synchronous speed. That is, the poles of the sta-
tor and rotor are always in the position shown, with 
respect to each other. Because unlike poles attract 
and like poles repel, forces are set up that produce 
rotation. The force acting at the rim of the rotor 
multiplied by the radius from the center of the rotor 
is called the torque. Torque can be determined by the 
following equation:
T  Hp  5252
RPM
where T = torque (in lb.-ft)
 
Hp = motor horsepower
 
5252 = constant (33,000/2π)
RPM =  rotor speed (in revolutions per minute)

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
Figure 9-3 also shows that the magnetic poles of 
the rotor are always midway between the magnetic 
poles of the stator so that the attracting and repelling 
forces work together. The frequency of the current 
in this case is 60 hertz (supplied by the power com-
pany). Sixty-hertz current is applied to the stator 
winding, but the frequency in the rotor is very low at 
operating speed and varies with the slip. The slip is 
the difference between the synchronous speed of the 
motor and its actual speed under full load.
The synchronous speed of an AC motor is 
obtained from the formula given as follows:
 Synchronous speed 
 
120  frequency
number of poles per phase  RPM
where the 120 is used to convert from seconds to 
minutes and to adjust for pairs of poles and the fre-
quency is in cycles per second.
Thus, for a 4-pole, 60-hertz motor, the synchro-
nous speed is
Synchronous speed  120  60
4
  1800 RPM
If the load causes the rotor to slip 75 RPM below 
the value of the synchronous speed, then the actual 
speed under full load is 1800 minus 75, or 1725 
revolutions per minute.
Similarly, the synchronous speed of a 6-pole, 
60-hertz motor is

Induction Motors in the 
Industrial Plant
Many of the machines in the industrial build-
ing are driven by 3-phase, squirrel-cage, single-
speed induction motors, Table 9-2. In addition to 
the motors listed in Table 9-2, other single-speed 
squirrel-cage motors are used as listed in Table 9-3.
The smaller sizes of squirrel-cage motors use con-
trollers known as across-the-line starters, Figure 9-4.
The controller is a magnetic switch or contac-
tor including overload relays that provide running 
protection for the motor. A push-button station can 
provide a means for starting, stopping, reversing, or 
jogging the motor, Figure 9-5 and Figure 9-6.

Four-Speed Squirrel-Cage Motors
The manufacturing area of the industrial build-
ing contains eight multispindle drills (MDs) that 
are equipped with 4-speed squirrel-cage induction 
motors. Motors of this type are called consequent-
pole motors. The synchronous speed (the speed of 
the rotating magnetic field) of an induction motor is 
determined by two factors:
 1. The number of stator poles per phase.
 2. Frequency of the applied voltage.
The standard frequency supplied by utility com-
panies throughout the United States and Canada 
is 60 Hz. A chart showing synchronous speeds

of 60  Hz motors with different numbers of poles 
is shown in Table 9-4. A 3-phase, 2-pole motor 
contains six actual poles. The magnetic field will 
make one revolution of a 2-pole motor each com-
plete cycle. If the stator of a motor were to be cut 
and laid out flat, the magnetic field would traverse 
the entire length in one cycle, Figure 9-7A. If the 
number of stator poles is doubled to four per phase, 
Figure  9-7B, the magnetic will traverse the same 
number of stator poles during one cycle. Because 
the number of poles has been doubled, the mag-
netic field will travel only half as far during one 
complete cycle. Consequent-pole motors have an 
advantage over some others types of variable-speed 
alternating-current motors in that they maintain a 
high torque when speed is reduced.
Consequent-pole motors obtain different speeds 
by changing the number of stator poles per phase.

Figure 9-8 illustrates the method used to change 
the number of stator poles. In Figure 9-8A, the two 
windings are connected in series, producing a single 
path for current flow. Because the current flows 
in the same direction through both windings, the 
polarity of the magnetic field is the same for both 
windings, and they are essentially one pole. If the 
windings are reconnected in such a manner that the 
direction of current flow through the two windings 
is in opposite directions, as shown in Figure 9-8B, 
the magnetic polarity of the two windings is differ-
ent and they are essentially two separate poles. In 
this manner a 4-pole stator winding can be changed 
to an 8-pole winding.
Consequent-pole motors that produce two 
speeds contain one reconnectable stator winding. 
Three-speed consequent-pole motors contain two 
stator windings. One is reconnectable, and the other 
is not. Four-speed motors contain two separate sta-
tor windings. Each of these windings can be recon-
nected to produce two separate speeds.
Two-speed stator windings can be connected to 
form a series delta or parallel wye, Figure 9-9. If the 
motor is wound in such a way that the series delta

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
connection gives the high speed and the parallel wye 
provides the low speed, the horsepower will be the 
same for either connection. If the winding is such 
that the series delta provides the low speed and the 
parallel wye gives the high speed, the torque will be 
the same for both speeds.
Induction motors cannot operate at the speed of 
the rotating magnetic field. At no load, a motor will 
operate to within 95% of the synchronous speed. 
The speed reduces as load is added to the motor. 
The speed listed on the nameplate of a motor is the 
full-load speed. The drill motors in this example 
have nameplate speeds of 560 RPM, 870 RPM, 
1175 RPM, and 1740 RPM. These full-load speeds 
indicate that the synchronous speeds would be 
600 RPM, 900 RPM, 1200 RPM, and 1800 RPM. 
Each speed is one-half of another. One stator wind-
ing contains four poles, to produce a synchronous 
speed of 1800 RPM. If that winding is changed 
to an 8-pole winding, the synchronous speed will 
be 900 RPM. The second stator winding contains 
six poles, to produce a synchronous speed of 
1200 RPM. This stator winding can be reconnected 
to provide 12 poles that will produce a synchro-
nous speed of 600 RPM.
The motor in this example contains fourteen 
terminal leads. The four speeds are obtained by 
connecting certain leads to the power supply and in 
some cases certain leads together. Table 9-5 lists the 
terminal connections for each speed. The control-
ler is generally arranged to provide a sequence of 
speeds such as REVERSE, OFF, LOW, 2nd, 3rd,

used to select the direction and speed of the motor, 
Figure 9-10.
The wiring has been omitted. The motor ter-
minal leads are connected to a terminal strip. The 
terminal strip makes connection to different sections 
of the controller. Each section of the controller is 
labeled to indicate how it is connected to the termi-
nal strip. Controllers can be drum type, cam type, 
or push button. The schematic diagram of a push- 
button control for a 4-speed, 3-phase consequent-
pole motor is shown in Figure 9-11.
The control permits any speed to be selected 
by pushing the button that initiates that particu-
lar speed. In this circuit, stacked push buttons 
are used to break the circuit to any other speed 
before the starter that controls the selected speed

is  energized. Electrical interlocks are also used 
to ensure that two speeds cannot be energized at 
the same time. Eleven-pin control relays are used 
to provide interlock connection because each 
contains three sets of double-acting contacts. 
Double-acting contacts can be connected as either 
normally open or normally closed. The load con-
tact connection is also shown. The circuit assumes 
that the starters and contactors each contain three 
load contacts. Note that 3rd speed and high speed 
require the used of two contactors to supply the 
necessary number of load contacts. The wind-
ing arrangement and connection diagram for this 
motor is shown in Figure 9-12.
Primary Resistance Starters
The milling machines are equipped with primary 
resistance starters. For this type of starter or control-
ler, the heavy starting current results in a voltage 
drop while it passes through the primary resistors; 
thus, there is a lower voltage value at the motor ter-
minals. The motor accelerates gently with less torque 
than is the case when line starters are used. When the 
motor has almost reached its normal speed, a time-
delay relay (set for about 5 seconds) closes a second 
contactor to short out the primary resistors. At this 
point, the motor receives the full line voltage and 
accelerates to its normal speed, Figure 9-13.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
Reduced Voltage Starters
The motors used on the surface grinders have 
another type of controller called a reduced voltage 
starter, Figure 9-14. This type of controller uses an 
autotransformer to obtain a reduced voltage. When the 
starting push button is depressed, a magnetic 5-pole 
contactor (S) connects the autotransformer to the line. 
Taps are made from the autotransformer at a value of 
about 70% of the line voltage at the start portion of the

cycle. Several seconds after the motor begins to rotate, 
a timing relay opens the first contactor (S) and closes 
a second 3-pole contactor (R). This action disconnects 
the autotransformer from the line and connects the 
motor directly across the line. As a result, the motor is 
accelerated to its normal speed, Figure 9-15.
The controllers covered in the chapter to this 
point are used with squirrel-cage motors. There 
are several other types of controllers used on other 
motors of various types in the industrial building.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
 squirrel-cage induction motor. The difference 
between the two motors is the construction of the 
rotor. The rotor of the squirrel-cage induction motor 
contains bars connected together at each end by 
shorting rings. The rotor of the wound-rotor induc-
tion motor contains a 3-phase winding very similar 
to the stator winding. The stator winding leads are 
marked L1, L2, and L3. The rotor winding leads 
are marked M1, M2, and M3. One end of each rotor 
winding is connected together with the others to 
form a wye connection. The other end of the winding 
is connected to slip rings (collector rings) located on 
the rotor shaft, Figure 9-16. Low-resistance carbon 
brushes in contact with the slip rings provide con-
nection to external resistors, Figure 9-17. The ability 
to  control the amount of resistance connected to the 
rotor circuit causes the wound-rotor induction motor 
to exhibit several desirable characteristics over other 
types of 3-phase motors:
 1. The amount of starting current can be con-
trolled by controlling the amount of resistance 
connected to the rotor. Induction motors are 
very similar to transformers. The stator wind-
ing is the primary and the rotor is the second-
ary. Limiting the amount of rotor (secondary) 
current limits the stator (primary) current also.
 2. The wound-rotor induction motor exhibits the 
highest amount of starting torque per ampere 
of starting current of any 3-phase motor. There 
are three factors that determine the amount of 
torque developed by an induction motor:
 
a.  The magnetic fi eld strength of the stator.
 
b.  The magnetic fi eld strength of the rotor.
 
c.  The phase angle difference between rotor 
and stator current.
 
 The torque reaches maximum when the rotor 
and stator currents are in phase with each 
other. Adding resistance to the rotor circuit 
causes the rotor current to be more in phase 
with the stator current, thus producing a 
greater amount of starting torque.
 3. The speed of the wound-rotor induction motor 
can be controlled by the amount of resis-
tance connected in the rotor circuit. Because 
the amount of resistance in the rotor circuit 
controls the current in both the rotor and sta-
tor windings, it controls the strength of the 
magnetic fields in the rotor and stator wind-
ings. Controlling the magnetic field strength 
controls the amount of torque produced by 
the motor. Inserting resistance in the rotor 
circuit results in a reduction of torque, which 
causes a greater amount of slip between the 
speed of the rotor and the speed of the rotating 
magnetic field. When resistance is decreased, 
magnetic field strength increases, causing 
an increase in torque and a corresponding 
increase in speed. Full motor speed is obtained 
when all the resistance has been shorted out 
of the rotor circuit. The rotors of wound-rotor 
induction motors are shown in Figure 9-18.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
Secondary Resistance Controller
The punch press motors can be operated in 
any of three speeds. The control circuit is shown 
in Figure 9-19. Motor speed is controlled by two 
sets of three resistors each connected in the rotor 
circuit. Three push buttons permit the motor to be 
operated in any of the three speeds. The speed can 
be changed at any time by pressing the appropriate 
button. However, there is a time delay of 3 seconds 
between any increases in speed. If the third speed 
button is pressed, for example, the motor will start 
in the first or lowest speed. After a 3-second delay, 
the motor will increase to the second speed. After 
another 3-second delay, the motor will increase to 
third or full speed. Motor speed can be decreased by 
pressing either of the other two push buttons. There 
is no time delay if the motor speed is decreased.
The wound-rotor induction has a larger than nor-
mal shaft diameter because of its ability to develop 
high torque. It is possible for the motor to develop 
torque that is 300% above normal running torque. 
This can create a great amount of stress on the shaft.
The wound-rotor motor is used for extra heavy-
duty starting. Typical applications include the use of 
this type of motor with pumps having an extremely 
high back pressure, or with machines having a very 
high static inertia. The secondary resistance control-
ler is used to bring the motor up to speed smoothly. 
In addition, this controller is used in normal running 
operations to adjust the torque and speed to any 
desired values.
 DETERMINING 
DIRECTION OF 
ROTATION FOR 
3-PHASE MOTORS
On many types of machinery, the direction of rota-
tion of the motor is critical. The direction of rotation 
of any 3-phase motor can be changed by reversing 
two of its stator leads. This causes the direction of 
the rotating magnetic field to reverse. When a motor 
is connected to a machine that will not be damaged 
when its direction of rotation is reversed, power can 
be momentarily applied to the motor to observe its 
direction of rotation. If the rotation is incorrect, any 
two line leads can be interchanged to reverse the 
motor’s rotation.
When a motor is to be connected to a machine 
that can be damaged by incorrect rotation, how-
ever, the direction of rotation must be determined 
before the motor is connected to its load. This can 
be accomplished in two basic ways. One way is to 
make electrical connection to the motor before it is 
mechanically connected to the load. The direction of 
rotation can then be tested by momentarily applying 
power to the motor before it is coupled to the load.

There may be occasions when this is not prac-
tical or convenient. It is possible to determine the 
direction of rotation of a motor before power is con-
nected to it with the use of a phase rotation meter, as 
shown in Figure 9-20. The phase rotation meter is 
used to compare the phase rotation of two  different 
3-phase connections. The meter contains six termi-
nal leads. Three of the leads are connected to one 
side of the meter and labeled “Motor.” Each of these 
three motor leads is labeled A, B, or C. The line 
leads are located on the other side of the meter, and 
each of these leads is labeled A, B, or C.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
To determine the direction of rotation of the 
motor, first zero the meter by following the instruc-
tions provided by the manufacturer. Then set 
the meter selector switch to motor, and connect the 
three motor leads of the meter to the “T” leads of the 
motor, as shown in Figure 9-21. The phase rotation 
meter contains a zero-center voltmeter. One side of 
the voltmeter is labeled “INCORRECT,” and the 
other side is labeled “CORRECT.” While observing 
the zero-center voltmeter, turn the motor shaft in the 
direction of desired rotation. The zero-center volt-
meter will immediately swing in the CORRECT or 
INCORRECT direction. When the motor shaft stops 
turning, the needle may swing in the opposite direc-
tion. It is the first indication of the voltmeter that is 
to be used.
If the voltmeter needle indicated CORRECT, 
label the motor “T” leads A, B, or C to correspond 
with the motor leads from the phase rotation meter. If 
the voltmeter needle indicated INCORRECT, change 
any two of the motor leads from the phase rotation 
meter and again turn the motor shaft. The voltmeter 
needle should now indicate CORRECT. The motor 
“T” leads can now be labeled to correspond with the 
motor leads from the phase rotation meter.
After the motor “T” leads have been labeled A, 
B, or C to correspond with the leads of the phase 
rotation meter, the rotation of the line supplying 
power to the motor must be determined. Set the 
selector switch on the phase rotation meter to the 
line position. After making certain the power has 
been turned off, connect the three line leads of 
the phase rotation meter to the motor supply line, 
Figure  9-22. Turn on the power and observe the 
zero-center voltmeter. If the meter is pointing in the 
CORRECT direction, turn off the power and label 
the line leads A, B, or C to correspond with the line 
leads of the phase rotation meter.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers

If the voltmeter is pointing in the INCORRECT 
direction, turn off the power and change any two of 
the leads from the phase rotation meter. When the 
power is turned on, the voltmeter should point in the 
CORRECT direction. Turn off the power and label 
the line leads A, B, or C to correspond with the leads 
from the phase rotation meter.
Now that the motor “T” leads and the incoming 
power leads have been labeled, connect the line lead 
labeled A to the “T” lead labeled A; the line lead labeled 
B to the “T” lead labeled B; and the line lead labeled C 
to the “T” lead labeled C. When power is connected to 
the motor, it will operate in the proper direction.
Notice that the phase rotation meter can be used 
to determine the phase rotation of two different con-
nections. It cannot determine which of the three phase 
lines is A, B, or C, or which line lead is L1, L2, or L3. 
The phase rotation meter can be used to determine the 
rotation of two separate 3-phase systems. For exam-
ple, assume all the short-circuit protective devices 
and switch gear for an existing 3-phase system must 
be replaced. To minimize downtime, a temporary 
3-phase service will be connected to supply power 
while the existing switch gear is being replaced. It is 
critical that the phase rotation of the temporary ser-
vice be the same as the existing service when power 
is applied. The phase rotation meter can be used to 
ensure the connection is correct.
The first step is to connect the line leads of 
the phase rotation meter to the existing power, 
Figure 9-23. If the zero-center voltmeter indicates 
CORRECT, label the load side of the service A, B, 
and C to correspond with the leads of the phase rota-
tion meter. If the voltmeter indicates INCORRECT, 
change two of the meter leads. This should cause the 
phase rotation meter to indicate CORRECT. Label 
the load side of the service to correspond with A, B, 
or C of the phase rotation meter leads.
Before connecting the temporary service to the 
load side of the circuit, connect the phase rota-
tion meter to the line side of the temporary service, 
Figure  9-24. Obtain a CORRECT reading on the 
phase rotation meter by changing two of the meter 
leads if necessary. After the correct reading has been 
obtained, label the service leads A, B, and C to corre-
spond with the leads of the phase rotation meter. If the 
marked temporary service leads are connected to their 
like-marked load leads, the phase rotation of the tem-
porary service will be the same as the existing service.
 CONNECTING  DUAL-
VOLTAGE 3-PHASE 
MOTORS
Many of the 3-phase motors used in industry are 
designed to be operated on two voltages, such as 240 
to 480 volts. Motors of this type contain two sets 
of windings per phase. Most dual-voltage motors 
bring out nine “T” leads at the terminal box. There 
is a standard method used to number these leads,

as shown in Figure 9-25. Starting with terminal #1, 
the leads are numbered in a decreasing spiral as 
shown. Another method of determining the proper 
lead numbers is to add three to each terminal. For 
example, starting with lead #1, add three to one. 
Three plus one equals four. The phase winding that 
begins with #1 ends with #4. Now add three to four. 
Three plus four equals seven. The beginning of the 
second winding for phase one is seven. This method 
will work for the windings of all phases. If in doubt, 
draw a diagram of the phase windings and number 
them in a spiral.
Three-phase motors can be constructed to operate 
in either wye or delta. If a motor is to be connected to 
high voltage, the phase windings will be connected in 
series. In Figure 9-26, a schematic diagram and ter-
minal connection chart for high voltage are shown for 
a wye-connected motor. In Figure 9-27, a schematic 
diagram and terminal connection chart for high volt-
age are shown for a  delta-connected motor.
When a motor is to be connected for low-voltage 
operation, the phase windings must be connected in 
parallel. Figure 9-28 shows the basic schematic dia-
gram for a wye-connected motor with parallel phase 
windings. In actual practice, however, it is not pos-
sible to make this exact connection with a  nine-lead 
motor. The schematic shows that terminal #4 con-
nects to the other end of the phase winding that 
starts with terminal #7. Terminal #5 connects to the 
other end of winding #8, and terminal #6  connects

solved, however, by forming a second wye connec-
tion by connecting terminals 4, 5, and 6, as shown in 
Figure 9-29.
The phase winding of a delta-connected motor 
must also be connected in parallel for use on low 
voltage. A schematic for this connection is shown in 
Figure 9-30. A connection diagram and terminal con-
nection chart for this hookup are shown in Figure 9-31.
Some dual-voltage motors contain twelve “T” 
leads instead of nine. In this instance, the opposite 
ends of terminals 7, 8, and 9 are brought out for con-
nection. Figure 9-32 shows the standard numbering 
for both delta- and wye-connected motors. Twelve 
leads are brought out if the motor is intended to be 
used for wye-delta starting. When this is the case, 
the motor must be designed for normal operation 
with its windings connected in delta. If the windings 
are connected in wye during starting, the starting 
current of the motor is greatly reduced.

 DUAL-VOLTAGE 
SINGLE-PHASE 
MOTORS
Many single-phase motors are designed to be con-
nected to either 120 or 240 volts. Most dual- voltage 
single-phase motors will be of the split-phase type, 
which contains both run and starting windings. Figure 
9-33 shows the schematic diagram of a  split-phase 
motor designed for dual-voltage operation. This par-
ticular motor contains two run  windings and two start 
windings. The lead numbers for single-phase motors 
are also numbered in a standard manner. One of the 
run windings has lead numbers of T1 and T2. The 
other run winding has its leads numbered T3 and T4. 
This particular motor uses two different sets of start 
winding leads. One set is labeled T5 and T6, and the 
other set is labeled T7 and T8.
If the motor is to be connected for high-voltage 
operation, the run windings and start windings will be 
connected in series, as shown in Figure 9-34. The start 
windings are then connected in parallel with the run 
windings. It should be noted that if the opposite direc-
tion of rotation is desired, T5 and T8 will be changed.

illustration, the start winding is labeled T5 and T6. It 
should be noted, however, that some motors identify 
the start winding by labeling it T5 and T8, as shown 
in Figure 9-37.
Regardless of which method is used to label the 
terminal leads of the start winding, the connection 
will be the same. If the motor is to be connected 
for high-voltage operation, the run windings will 
be connected in series, and the start winding will be 
connected in parallel with one of the run windings, 
as shown in Figure 9-38. In this type of motor, each 
winding is rated at 120 volts. If the run windings are 
connected in series across 240 volts, each winding 
will have a voltage drop of 120 volts. By connect-
ing the start winding in parallel across only one run 
winding, it will receive only 120 volts when power 
is applied to the motor. If the opposite direction of 
rotation is desired, T5 and T8 should be changed.
For low-voltage operation, the windings must be 
connected in parallel, as shown in Figure 9-35. This 
connection is made by first connecting the run wind-
ings in parallel by hooking T1 and T3 together, and 
T2 and T4 together. The start windings are paral-
leled by connecting T5 and T7 together, and T6 and 
T8 together. The start windings are then connected 
in parallel with the run windings. If the opposite 
direction of rotation is desired, T5 and T6, and T7 
and T8 should be reversed.
Not all dual-voltage single-phase motors contain 
two sets of start windings. Figure 9-36 shows the 
schematic diagram of a motor that contains two sets 
of run windings and only one start winding. In this

facing the back or rear of the motor. Figure 9-40 
shows a connection diagram for rotation. If  clockwise 
rotation is desired, T5 should be connected to T1. 
If counterclockwise rotation is desired, T8 (or T6) 
should be connected to T1. It should be noted that this 
connection diagram assumes the motor contains two 
sets of run and two sets of start windings. The type 
of motor used will determine the actual connection. 
For example, Figure 9-38 shows the connection of a 
motor with two run windings and only one start wind-
ing. If this motor were to be connected for clockwise 
rotation, terminal T5 should be connected to T1 and 
terminal T8 should be connected to T2 and T3. If 
counterclockwise rotation were desired, terminal T8 
would be connected to T1, and terminal T5 would be 
connected to T2 and T3.
If the motor is to be operated on low voltage, 
the windings are connected in parallel, as shown in 
Figure 9-39. Because all windings are connected in 
parallel, each will receive 120 volts when power is 
applied to the motor.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
A part of the shunt field and a part of the series 
field are wound on each pole piece. The windings on 
each alternate pole piece are made in opposite direc-
tions, clockwise and counterclockwise. In this man-
ner, each pole piece is alternately magnetized north 
and south. The ends of the shunt winding (two ends) 
and the series field winding (two ends) are brought 
out to the motor terminal box.
Commutating poles or interpoles are also pro-
vided. These very small pole pieces are placed mid-
way between the main pole pieces. The interpoles 
are wound with a few turns of heavy wire. As with 
the main pole pieces, the interpoles are also wound 
in an alternate clockwise and counterclockwise 
manner. The pole pieces are connected permanently 
in series with the armature brush holders and are 
considered to be a part of the armature circuit. 
Interpoles counteract the distortion of the field mag-
netism caused by the rotation of the heavily magne-
tized armature in the field flux. As a result, sparking 
or arcing at the brushes is reduced.
A DC compound motor can be connected in 
several ways. When the shunt field spans only the 
armature, it is known as a short shunt connection, 
Figure 9-43. If, on the other hand, the shunt field 
spans both the armature and the series field, it is 
called a long shunt connection. When the motor 
is connected short shunt, the shunt field current 
is added to the series field current. This generally 
causes a slight overcompounding of the motor, 
which permits it to exhibit stronger torque charac-
teristics. When the motor is connected long shunt, it 
exhibits better speed regulation.
If the motor terminal connections are made so that 
the series field magnetism aids or strengthens the mag-
netism produced by the shunt field, then the motor is 
said to be a cumulative compound motor, Figure 9-44.
If the motor terminal connections are reversed 
so that the magnetism of the series field opposes or 
weakens the magnetism of the shunt field, the motor 
is called a differential compound motor, Figure 9-44.
Although the differential compound motor gives 
a more constant speed at all loads, the motor is 
somewhat unstable. For this reason, this type of 
motor is not used in as many applications as the 
cumulative compound motor.
The strength of the shunt field is constant. 
However, because the series field is connected in 
Direct-Current Motors
Two types of machine tools in the industrial 
building require DC motors. Five vertical boring 
mills (MG) require one DC motor each, and three 
planers (MH) require the same type of motors and 
controllers.
The motors used are standard compound wound 
DC motors and are all rated at 25 horsepower. The 
motors are not operated from regular DC sources, 
but rather are operated from 480-volt AC lines 
through electronic controllers that rectify the current 
(change it from AC to DC).
Direct-current compound motors contain a rotat-
ing armature and a stationary field. The field also 
serves as the frame or housing of the motor. End 
bells or end brackets support the shaft bearings. 
The armature has a winding that is connected to 
a  commutator. Brush holders and carbon brushes 
mounted on the front end bell contact the commuta-
tor, which rotates when the motor is running.
A typical DC motor is shown in Figure 9-41.
The compound wound field consists of two sep-
arate field windings. The shunt field is wound with 
relatively small wire and has thousands of turns. The 
series field is wound with large wire and has only a 
few turns. The field windings or coils are placed on 
pole pieces attached to the frame or yoke.
Compound wound motors have an even number 
of poles, with the smaller motor sizes usually having 
two or four poles, and the larger motor sizes having 
a larger number of poles. The field frame of a DC 
motor is shown in Figure 9-42.

has a coil span equal to one-quarter of the circum-
ference of the armature, less a few slots. A 6-pole 
armature has a coil span equal to one-sixth of the 
circumference of the armature, less one or two slots, 
Figure  9-45. The coil span arrangement depends 
entirely on the number of poles present. A 4-pole 
armature cannot be used with a 2-pole field. The 
two units, the armature and the field, must be wound 
with the same number of poles.
It was shown that for AC motors, the torque and 
horsepower are proportional to the square of the 
voltage applied, and the speed of rotation depends 
upon the frequency and the number of poles in the 
motor. However, the performance of a DC motor 
depends upon entirely different factors. The speed 
series with the armature, the strength of the series 
field varies with the load on the motor. When the 
motor is running at idle speed (no output), the series 
field contributes almost no magnetism to that of the 
shunt field. When the motor is loaded, the series 
field increases the magnetism of the shunt field to 
produce more torque and cause a slight drop in the 
motor speed.
The armature/commutator also has poles. This 
component of the motor is a wrought copper cyl-
inder with segments or bars. These segments are 
insulated from one another and serve as a mount-
ing to which the armature winding is connected. A 
2-pole armature has a coil span equal to the diameter 
of the armature, less a few slots. A 4-pole armature

and A2 are connected to the armature through the 
brushes. The ends of the series field are identified 
with S1 and S2, and the ends of the shunt field are 
marked F1 and F2. Some DC machines will provide 
access to another set of windings called the com-
mutating field or interpoles. The ends of this wind-
ing will be labeled C1 and C2, or S3 and S4. It is 
common practice to provide access to the interpole 
winding on machines designed to be used as motors 
or generators.
 DETERMINING 
THE DIRECTION OF 
ROTATION OF A 
DIRECT-CURRENT 
MOTOR
The direction of rotation of a DC motor is deter-
mined by facing the commutator end of the motor. 
This is generally the back or rear of the motor. If the 
windings have been labeled in a standard manner, 
of a DC motor increases when the voltage increases 
and decreases if the field strength is increased or if 
there is an increase in the number of poles or turns 
of wire wound on the armature.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
The direction of rotation of a DC motor can be 
reversed by changing the connections of the arma-
ture leads or the field leads. It is common practice 
to change the connection of the armature leads. This 
is done to prevent changing a cumulative compound 
motor into a differential compound motor.
 DIRECT-CURRENT 
POWER SUPPLIES
The use of direct-current motors in industry creates 
a need for a supply of DC power. Because most 
of industry operates on AC power, the DC power 
needed is generally produced within the indus-
trial plant. The most common method to convert 
AC voltage to DC voltage is by the use of solid-state 
 components.
A simple half-wave rectifier is shown in 
Figure  9-50. The diode is used to convert the AC 
voltage to DC voltage. The diode operates like an 
electric check valve; it permits the current to flow 
through it in only one direction. When the voltage 
applied to the cathode end of the diode is more nega-
tive than the voltage applied to the anode end, the 
diode becomes forward biased. This permits current 
to flow through the load resistor and then through 
the diode to complete the circuit. When the voltage 
applied to the cathode end of the diode becomes 
it is possible to determine the direction of rotation 
when the motor is connected. Figure 9-47 illustrates 
the standard connections for a series motor. The 
standard connections for a shunt motor are illus-
trated in Figure 9-48, and the standard connections 
for a compound motor are shown in Figure 9-49.

the operation of this rectifier, assume the voltage 
applied to the cathode of diode D1 to be negative, 
and the voltage applied to the cathode of diode 
D2 to be positive. Because diode D1 has a nega-
tive voltage applied to its cathode, it is forward 
biased and current can flow through it. Diode D2, 
however, is reverse biased and no current can flow 
through it. The current must flow from the center 
tap of the transformer, through the load resistor, 
and complete the circuit through diode D1 back to 
the transformer.
During the next half-cycle of AC voltage, a 
negative voltage is applied to the cathode of diode 
D2 and a positive voltage is applied to the cathode 
of diode D1. Diode D2 is now forward biased and 
diode D1 is reverse biased. Current can flow from 
the center tap of the transformer, through the load 
resistor, and then complete the circuit through diode 
D2 back to the transformer. Notice in this rectifier 
that current flowed through the load resistor during 
both half cycles of AC voltage. Because both cycles 
of AC voltage were changed into DC, it is full-wave 
rectification.
more positive than the voltage applied to the anode 
end, the diode becomes reverse biased and turns 
off. When the diode is reverse biased, no current 
flows in the circuit. The waveforms in Figure 9-50 
illustrate this condition. The negative half of the 
AC input wave has been cut off to produce the DC 
output wave. This type of rectifier is called a half-
wave because only one-half of the AC waveform is 
used. The output voltage is pulsating. It turns on and 
off, but the direction of current flow never reverses. 
Because the output voltage never reverses direction, 
it is direct current.
Single-Phase, Full-Wave Rectifiers
Full-wave rectification of single-phase AC 
can be obtained by using either of two circuits. 
Figure  9-51 shows these two types of full-wave 
rectifiers: the two-diode type and the bridge 
type. The two-diode rectifier requires the use of a 
center-tapped transformer. It is the more efficient 
of the two because there is a voltage drop across 
only two diodes instead of four. To understand

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
AC input voltage. To determine the output DC voltage, 
the average value must be found. The average value of 
DC voltage for a single-phase, full-wave rectifier can 
be determined by multiplying the RMS value of AC 
voltage by 0.9 or the peak value by 0.637. Assume that 
120 volts AC is rectified with a bridge rectifier.
 
 
E(average)  E(RMS)  0.9
 
 
E(average)  120  0.9
 
 
E(average)  108 volts
The average voltage value can also be deter-
mined by changing the RMS value into the peak 
value and then multiplying by 0.637. To change the 
RMS value into the peak value, multiply the RMS 
value by the square root of 2, or 1.414.
 
 
E(peak)  E(RMS)  1.414
 
 
E(peak)  120  1.414
 
 
E(peak)  169.68
Now that the peak value has been determined, 
multiply by 0.637.
 
E(average)  169.68  0.637
 
E(average)  108 volts
The bridge-type rectifier requires the use of 
four diodes, but it does not require the use of a 
center-tapped transformer. To understand the oper-
ation of this type of rectifier, assume the voltage 
applied to point A of the rectifier to be positive, 
and the voltage applied to point D to be negative. 
Current can flow through diode D4 to point C of 
the rectifier. Because diode D3 is reverse biased, 
the current must flow through the load resistor 
to point B of the rectifier. The current then flows 
through diode D1 to point A and back to complete 
the circuit. During the next half cycle, the volt-
age applied to point A is negative, and the voltage 
applied to point D is positive. Current can now 
flow through diode D3 to point C of the recti-
fier. Because diode D4 is reverse biased, the cur-
rent must flow through the load resistor to point 
B of the rectifier. At this point, the current flows 
through diode D2 to complete the circuit. Notice 
the current flowed through the load resistor during 
both half cycles of AC voltage.
Average Value of Voltage
When AC voltage is changed into DC voltage, the 
output DC value of voltage will not be the same as the

For a single-phase, half-wave rectifier divide the 
answer by 2.
Three-Phase Rectifiers
Most of industry operates on 3-phase power 
instead of single phase. When it is necessary to 
change AC voltage into DC voltage, it is generally 
done with a 3-phase rectifier. There are two basic 
types of 3-phase rectifiers: the half-wave rectifier 
and the full-wave rectifier. A 3-phase, half-wave rec-
tifier is shown in Figure 9-52.
The 3-phase, half-wave rectifier requires the 
use of a wye-connected transformer with a cen-
ter tap to complete the circuit. Notice that only 
three diodes are used to make this connection. 
The average DC output voltage for a 3-phase, 
half-wave rectifier is 0.827 of the peak value or 
1.169 of the RMS value. When determining the 
average value for a 3-phase, half-wave rectifier, 
the phase value of voltage must be used. Because 
the center tap of the wye connection is used as the 
return path, the diodes are rectifying the phase 
value instead of the line value. In the circuit 
shown in Figure 9-52, it is assumed that the out-
put line voltage is 480 volts. The phase value can 
be determined by dividing the line value by the 
square root of 3, or 1.732.

The average voltage value can also be deter-
mined by changing the RMS value into the peak 
value and then multiplying by 0.827.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
Silicon-Controlled Rectifiers
When the amount of DC output voltage must be 
varied, silicon-controlled rectifiers (SCRs) are gener-
ally used instead of diodes. The reason for this is that 
the SCR can be turned on at different points during 
the AC waveform applied to it. This permits the out-
put voltage to be varied from 0 volts to the full output 
voltage of the power supply. The heart of the SCR 
controller is the phase-shift control. The phase-shift 
control determines when the SCRs turn on during the 
AC voltage cycle applied to it. A 3-phase bridge recti-
fier using SCRs and a phase-shift control is shown 
   E(Peak)  E(RMS)  1.414
E(Peak)  277.1  1.414
 
E(Peak)  391.8
Now that the peak value has been determined, 
multiply by 0.827.
 E(Average)  391.8  0.827
 
E(Average)  324 volts
The slight difference in answer is caused by 
rounding off of values.
A 3-phase, full-wave type of rectifier is shown 
in Figure 9-53. This rectifier does not require the 
use of a wye-connected transformer with center 
tap, so it can be used with a wye- or delta-connected 
system. This rectifier does, however, require the 
use of six diodes. The average DC output voltage 
for this rectifier is 0.955 of the peak value or 1.35 
of the RMS value. If the AC voltage applied to this 
rectifier has a line value of 208 volts, the output 
DC voltage will be 280.8 volts (208 × 1.35). The 
multiplication factors for determining the average 
values for both single-phase and 3-phase rectifiers 
are shown in Table 9-6.

on more to provide more voltage to the armature 
of the motor. If the motor speed should increase, 
the phase-shift control will cause the SCRs to turn 
on less of the time; thus, the voltage applied to the 
armature will decrease.
 VARIABLE-
FREQUENCY DRIVES
Although DC motors are still used in many 
industries, they are being replaced by variable-
frequency drives controlling squirrel-cage induction 
motors. The advantage of a DC motor compared 
to an AC motor is the fact that the speed of the DC 
motor can be controlled. Although the wound-rotor 
induction motor does permit some degree of speed 
control, it does not have the torque characteristics 
of a DC motor. Direct-current motors can develop 
maximum torque at 0 RPM. Variable-frequency 
drives can give these same speed control and torque 
characteristics to squirrel-cage induction motors. A 
variable-frequency drive and AC squirrel-cage motor 
are less expensive to purchase than a comparable DC 
in Figure 9-54. A basic diagram of an SCR control 
system for a DC motor is shown in Figure  9-55. 
Notice that all sensor controls are connected to the 
phase-shift control. The operator control permits the 
operator to determine the amount of output voltage 
that is to be applied to the armature of the motor. This 
in turn determines the speed of the motor.
The field-failure control senses the current flow 
through the shunt field of the motor. If the shunt-
field current should drop below a predetermined 
level, a signal is sent to the phase-shift control, 
which turns off the SCRs.
The current-limit control senses the input cur-
rent to the controller. If a predetermined amount of 
current should be sensed, the phase-shift control will 
not permit the SCRs to turn on more and produce 
more current flow. This is designed to prevent dam-
age to the motor and controller if the motor should 
become shorted or stalled.
The electrotachometer is connected to the shaft 
of the motor. Its function is to sense the speed of the 
motor. If the motor speed should decrease, a signal 
is sent to the phase-shift control, and the SCRs turn

tenance problems than DC drives and DC motors.
Variable-Frequency Drive 
Operating Principles
The operating principle of all polyphase AC 
motors is the rotating magnetic field. The speed 
of the rotating field is called synchronous speed 
and is controlled by two factors: frequency of the 
applied voltage and the number of stator poles. 
Table 9-7 lists the synchronous speed for different 
numbers of poles at different frequencies. Variable-
frequency drives control motor speed by controlling 
the  frequency of the power supplied to the motor.

A critical factor that must be considered when 
the frequency supplying a motor load is reduced is

winding T3 to be connected to a positive voltage and 
T2 to be connected to a negative voltage. Current 
can flow through Q4 to T2, through the motor stator 
winding and through T3 to Q1.

ing T1, through the motor to T2, and through Q3 to 
the positive of the power supply.
Because the transistors are turned completely on 
or completely off, the waveform produced is a square 
wave instead of a sine wave, Figure 9-57. Induction 
motors will operate on a square wave without a great 
problem. Some manufacturers design units that will 
produce a stepped waveform, as shown in Figure 9-58. 
The stepped waveform is used because it more closely 
approximates a sine wave.
Some Related Problems
The circuit illustrated in Figure 9-56 employs 
the use of SCRs in the power supply and junction 
transistors in the output stage. SCR power supplies 
control the output voltage by chopping the incoming 
waveform. This can cause harmonics on the line that 
cause overheating of transformers and motors, and can 
cause fuses to blow and circuit breakers to trip. When 
bipolar junction transistors are employed as switches, 
they are generally driven into saturation by supply-
ing them with an excessive amount of base-emitter 
current. Saturating the transistor causes the collector-
emitter voltage to drop to between 0.04 and 0.03 volt. 
If a motor operates on 480 volts at 60 hertz, the 
voltage should be reduced to 400 volts when the 
frequency is decreased to 50 hertz, 320 volts at a 
frequency of 40 hertz, 240 volts at a frequency of 
30 hertz, and so on.
Basic Construction of a Variable-
Frequency Drive
Most variable-frequency drives operate by first 
changing the AC voltage into DC and then changing it 
back to AC at the desired frequency. There are several 
methods used to change the DC voltage back into AC.
The method employed is generally determined by 
the manufacturer, age of the equipment, and the size 
motor the drive must control. Variable-frequency 
drives intended to control the speed of motors up 
to 500 horsepower generally use transistors. In the 
circuit shown in Figure 9-56, a single-phase bridge 
changes the alternating current into direct current.
The bridge rectifier uses two SCRs and two 
diodes. The SCRs permit the output voltage of 
the rectifier to be controlled. As the frequency 
decreases, the SCRs fire later in the cycle and lower 
the output voltage to the transistors. A choke coil 
and capacitor bank are used to filter the output 
 voltage before transistors Q1 through Q6 change the 
DC voltage back into AC. An electronic control unit 
is connected to the bases of transistor Q1 through Q6. 
The control unit converts the DC voltage back into 
3-phase alternating current by turning transistors on 
or off at the proper time and in the proper sequence. 
Assume, for example, that transistors Q1 and Q4 are

collector, but they do not suffer from the slow recov-
ery time of common junction transistors. The sche-
matic symbol for an IGBT is shown in Figure 9-59.
Drives using IGBTs generally use diodes to rec-
tify the AC voltage into DC, not SCRs, Figure 9-60. 
The 3-phase rectifier supplies a constant DC voltage 
to the transistors. The output voltage to the motor 
is controlled by pulse-width modulation (PWM). 
PWM is accomplished by turning the transistor 
on and off several times during each half cycle, 
 Figure  9-61. The output voltage is an average of 
the peak or maximum voltage and the amount of 
time the transistor is turned on or off. Assume that 
480-volt, 3-phase AC is rectified to DC and filtered. 
The DC voltage applied to the IGBTs is approxi-
mately 630 volts. The output voltage to the motor 
is controlled by the switching of the transistors. 
Assume that the transistor is on for 10 microseconds 
and off for 20 microseconds. In this example, the 
transistor is on for one-third of the time and off for 
two-thirds of the time. The voltage applied to the 
motor would be 210 volts (630/3).
This small voltage drop allows the transistor to control 
large amounts of current without being destroyed. 
When a transistor is driven into saturation, however, it 
cannot recover or turn off as quickly as normal. This 
greatly limits the frequency response of the transistor.
IGBTs
Many transistor-controlled variable drives now 
employ a special type of transistor called an insu-
lated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). IGBTs have 
an insulated gate very similar to some types of 
field-effect transistors (FETs). Because the gate is 
insulated, it has a very high impedance. The IGBT is 
a voltage-controlled device, not a current-controlled 
device. This gives it the ability to turn off very 
quickly. IGBTs can be driven into saturation to pro-
vide a very low voltage drop between emitter and 
FIGURE 9-57 Square wave voltage waveform.

a sine wave.

The greatest disadvantage is that the fast switching rate 
of the transistors can cause voltage spikes in the range 
of 1600 volts to be applied to the motor. These voltage 
spikes can destroy some motors. Line length from the 
drive to the motor is of great concern with drives using 
IGBTs. The shorter the line length, the better.
Advantages and Disadvantages 
of IGBT Drives
A great advantage of drives using IGBTs is the fact 
that SCRs are generally not used in the power supply 
and this greatly reduces problems with line harmonics.

of the insulation stress caused by high-voltage 
spikes occurs at the beginning of a winding.
 4. The magnet wire used in the construction of 
the motor windings has a higher rated insula-
tion than other motors.
 5. The case size is larger than most 3-phase 
motors. The case size is larger because of the 
added insulating paper between the windings 
and the stator core. Also, a larger case size 
helps cool the motor by providing a larger sur-
face area for the dissipation of heat.
Variable-Frequency Drives Using 
SCRs and GTOs
Variable-frequency drives intended to control 
motors of more than 500 horsepower generally use 
SCRs or gate turnoff devices (GTOs). GTOs are 
similar to SCRs except that conduction through the 
GTO can be stopped by applying a negative voltage, 
negative with respect to the cathode, to the gate. 
SCRs and GTOs are thyristors and have the ability 
to handle a greater amount of current than transis-
tors. An example of a single-phase circuit used to 
convert DC voltage to AC voltage with SCRs is 
shown in Figure 9-63.
In this circuit, the SCRs are connected to a con-
trol unit that controls the sequence and rate at which 
the SCRs are gated on. The circuit is constructed so 
that SCRs A and A′ are gated on at the same time 
Inverter-Rated Motors
Due to the problem of excessive voltage spikes 
caused by IGBT drives, some manufacturers pro-
duce a motor that is “inverter rated.” These motors 
are specifically designed to be operated by variable-
frequency drives. They differ from standard motors 
in several ways:
 1. Many inverter-rated motors contain a separate 
blower to provide continuous cooling for the 
motor regardless of the speed. Many motors 
use a fan connected to the motor shaft to help 
draw air though the motor. When the motor 
speed is reduced, the fan cannot maintain suf-
ficient airflow to cool the motor.
 2. Inverter-rated motors generally have insulating 
paper between the windings and the stator core, 
Figure 9-62. The high-voltage spikes produce 
high currents that produce a high magnetic 
field. This increased magnetic field causes the 
motor windings to move. This movement can 
eventually cause the insulation to wear off the 
wire and produce a grounded motor winding.
 3. Inverter-rated motors generally have phase paper 
added to the terminal leads. Phase paper is 
insulating paper added to the terminal leads that 
exit the motor. The high-voltage spikes affect 
the beginning lead of a coil much more than 
the wire inside the coil. The coil is an inductor 
that  naturally opposes a change of current. Most

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers

Now assume that SCRs B and B′ are turned 
on. Because SCRs A and A′ are still turned on, two 
current paths now exist through the circuit. The 
positive charge on capacitor C1, however, causes 
the negative electrons to see an easier path. The cur-
rent will rush to charge the capacitor to the opposite 
polarity, stopping the current flowing through SCRs 
A and A′, permitting them to turn off. The current 
now flows through SCRs B and B′ and charges 
the capacitor to the opposite polarity, Figure 9-65. 
Notice that the current now flows through the load 
in the opposite direction, which produces alternating 
current across the load.
To produce the next half cycle of AC current, 
SCRs A and A′ are gated on again. The positively 
charged side of the capacitor will now cause the 
current to stop flowing through SCRs B and B′ 
permitting them to turn off. The current again 
flows through the load in the direction indicated in 
Figure 9-64. The frequency of the circuit is deter-
mined by the rate at which the SCRs are gated on.
and SCRs B and B′ are gated on at the same time. 
Inductors L1 and L2 are used for filtering and wave 
shaping. Diodes D1 through D4 are clamping diodes 
and are used to prevent the output voltage from 
becoming excessive. Capacitor C1 is used to turn one 
set of SCRs off when the other set is gated on. This 
capacitor must be a true AC capacitor because it will 
be charged to the alternate polarity each half cycle. 
In a converter intended to handle large amounts of 
power, capacitor C1 will be a bank of capacitors.
To understand the operation of the circuit, 
assume that SCRs A and A′ are gated on at the same 
time. Current will flow through the circuit as shown 
in Figure 9-64. Notice the direction of current flow 
through the load and that capacitor C1 has been 
charged to the polarity shown. When an SCR is gated 
on, it can be turned off only by permitting the cur-
rent flow through the anode–cathode section to drop 
below a certain level called the holding current level. 
As long as the current continues to flow through the 
anode–cathode, the SCR will not turn off.

CHAPTER 9  Motors and Controllers
permits the motor to bring the load up to speed slowly 
as opposed to simply connecting the motor directly 
to the line. Even if the speed control is set in the 
maximum position when the start button is pressed, 
ramping permits the motor to accelerate the load 
from zero to its maximum RPM over several seconds. 
This feature can be a real advantage for some types 
of loads, especially gear drive loads. In some units 
the amount of acceleration and deceleration time can 
be adjusted by setting potentiometers on the main 
control board. Other units are completely digitally 
controlled and the acceleration and deceleration times 
are programmed into the computer memory.
Some other adjustments that can usually be set 
by changing potentiometers or programming the 
unit are as follows:
Current limit: This control sets the maximum 
amount of current the drive is permitted to deliver to 
the motor.
Volts per hertz: This sets the ratio by which the 
voltage changes as frequency increases or decreases.
Features of Variable-Frequency 
Control
Although the primary purpose of a variable- 
 frequency drive is to provide speed control for an 
AC motor, most drives provide functions that other 
types of controls do not. Many variable-frequency 
drives can provide the low-speed torque that is so 
desirable in DC motors. It is this feature that permits 
AC squirrel-cage motors to replace DC motors for 
many applications. Many variable-frequency drives 
also provide current limit and automatic speed 
regulation for the motor. Current limit is generally 
accomplished by connecting current transformers 
to the input of the drive and sensing the increase in 
current as load is added. Speed regulation is accom-
plished by sensing the speed of the motor and feed-
ing this information back to the drive.
Another feature of variable-frequency drives is 
acceleration and deceleration control, sometimes 
called ramping. Ramping is used to accelerate or 
decelerate a motor over some period of time. Ramping

Maximum hertz: This control sets the maximum 
speed of the motor. Most motors are intended to 
operate between 0 and 60 hertz, but some drives 
permit the output frequency to be set above 60 hertz, 
which would permit the motor to operate at higher-
than-normal speed. The maximum hertz control can 
also be set to limit the output frequency to a value 
less than 60 hertz, which would limit the motor 
speed to a value less than normal.
Minimum hertz: This sets the minimum speed 
the motor is permitted to run.
Some variable-frequency drives permit adjust-
ment of current limit, maximum and minimum 
speed, ramping time, and so on, by adjustment of 
trim resistors located on the main control board. 
Other drives employ a microprocessor as the con-
troller. The values of current limit, speed, ramping 
time, and so on, for these drives are programmed 
into the unit and are much easier to make and 
are generally more accurate than adjusting trim 
resistors. A variable-frequency drive is shown in 
Figure 9-66.

Therefore, the definition of horsepower is
Hp  Ft-lb per minute/33,000
or
Hp  Ft-lb per second/550
Torque is the twisting or turning force produced by 
the motor. It is rated in either foot-pounds or inch-
pounds, depending on the motor. Horsepower and 
torque are related as shown by the formula:
Hp  (Torque  Speed)/Constant
If the torque is given in foot-pounds, the constant 
is 5252 (33,000/2π). If the torque is given in inch-
pounds, the constant is 63,025 (5252 × 12). Standard 
NEMA horsepower ratings are shown in Figure 10-2.
Revolutions per Minute (RPM)
The RPM indicates the speed in revolutions per 
minute that the motor will run at full-load rating. The 
motor will run faster at light load or no load. The 
nameplate indicates that the motor will have a speed 
of 1720 RPM when the motor is under full load.
 MOTOR 
NAMEPLATE DATA
One of the major sources of information concern-
ing the motor is the nameplate. The National 
Electrical Manufacturers Association specifies that 
every motor nameplate must list specific items such 
as these:
• Manufacturer’s name
• Rated voltage
• Full-load current
• Frequency
• Number of phases
• Full-load speed
• Temperature rise or insulation system class
• Duty or time rating
• Horsepower
• Locked rotor indicating code letter
• Service factor
• Frame size
• Efficiency
• NEMA design code
It should be noted that not all motor manufacturers 
comply with NEMA specifications, and their name-
plates may or may not contain all the information spec-
ified by NEMA. In some instances, information not 
specified by NEMA may also be listed on a nameplate. 
A typical motor nameplate is shown in Figure 10-1. 
Each item on the nameplate will be discussed.
Manufacturer’s Name
This lists the manufacturer of the motor.
Horsepower
Motors have a rate horsepower that is determined 
by the amount of torque they can produce at a spe-
cific speed under full load. The horsepower listed on 
the nameplate in this example is 1 horsepower. When 
James Watt invented the steam engine, he needed to 
rate its power in a way that the average person could 
understand. Through experimentation, he determined 
that the average horse could lift 550 pounds 1 foot

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
Frequency
The frequency is measured in hertz. The stan-
dard frequency used throughout the United States 
and Canada is 60 Hz. Some manufacturers, however, 
design motors for use in both the United States and 
Europe. The standard frequency in Europe is 50 
Hz. Motors with a frequency rating of 50 or 60 Hz 
are not uncommon. The nameplate in Figure 10-1 
indicates that the motor is designed to operate on a 
frequency of 60 Hz.
Phases
Phase indicates the number of phases on which 
the motor is designed to operate. Most industrial 
motors are 3-phase, which means that the power 
connected to them is three separate lines with the 
voltages 120° out of phase with each other. Other 
alternating-current motors are generally single 
phase. Although there are some single-phase motors 
used in industrial applications, most are found in 
residential applications. Although two-phase motors 
do exist, they are extremely rare in the United States. 
The nameplate indicates that the motor is to operate 
on 3-phase power.
Motor Type
Three-phase motors can be divided into three 
general types: squirrel-cage induction, wound-
rotor induction, and synchronous. Motors listed as 
“induction” will generally be squirrel-cage–type, 
which describes the type of rotor use in the motor. 
Wound-rotor induction motors are easily recognized 
by the fact that they contain three slip rings on the 
rotor shaft. Synchronous motors are not induction-
type motors. The nameplate shown in Figure 10-1 
lists this motor as an induction-type motor.
Frame
The frame number indicates the type of motor 
frame. A chart is generally needed to determine the 
exact dimensions of the frame. When dealing with 
frame sizes, a general rule of thumb is that the cen-
terline shaft height (dimension D) above the bottom 
of the base is the first two digits of the frame number 
divided by 4. The nameplate in Figure 10-1 indicates 
that the motor has a 143T frame. A frame 143T, for 
example, would have a shaft height of 3.5 inches 
(14/4) above the base of the motor.
In addition to frame numbers, letters also appear 
at the end of the numbers. These letters represent 
different frame styles.
C—The letter C designates a flange-mounted 
motor. C style are the most popular flange-
mounted motors and have a specific bolt 
pattern on the shaft end of the motor that per-
mits mounting to the driven device. C flange 
motors always have threaded bolt-holes in 
the face of the motor.
D—Another type of flange mount motor is 
the D. The flange diameter of these motors 
is larger than the body of the motor, and 
the bolt-holes are not threaded. They are 
designed for bolts to pass through the holes.
H—These frames are used on some 56 frame 
motors. The H indicates that the base can be 
mounted in either 56, 143T, or 145T mount-
ing positions.
J—J indicates that the motor is especially 
designed to mount to jet pumps. It has a 
threaded stainless steel shaft and a standard 
56 C face.
JM—The letters JM indicate that the pump 
shaft is designed for a mechanical seal. This 
motor also has a C face.
JP—The JP motor is similar to the JM motor. 
The seal is designed for a packing type seal.

S—S indicates that the motor has a short shaft. 
These motors are generally intended to be 
directly coupled to a load. They are not 
intended to be used with belt drives.
T—T frame motors were standardized after 
1964. Any motor with a T at the end of the 
frame size was made after 1964.
U—NEMA first standardized motor frames in 
1952. Motors with a U in the frame number 
were manufactured between 1952 and 1964.
Y—Y indicates that the motor has a special 
mounting configuration. It does not indicate 
what the configuration is, only that it is non-
standard.
Z—Z indicates that the motor has a special 
shaft. It could be longer, larger in diameter, 
threaded, or contain holes. Z indicates that 
the shaft is special in some undefined way.
Voltage
Volts indicate the operating voltage of the motor. 
The nameplate in Figure 10-1 indicates that the 
motor in this example is designed to operate on dif-
ferent voltages, depending on the connection of the 
stator windings. These motors are generally referred 
to as “dual-voltage motors.” If the motor is con-
nected for low-voltage operation, it will operate on 
208 or 230 volts. If it is connected for high-voltage 
operation, it will operate on 460 volts. The 230-volt 
rating applies for voltage ranges of 220 to 240 volts. 
The 460-volt rating applies for voltage ranges of 440 
to 480 volts.
Full-Load Current
The ampere rating indicates the amount of 
current the motor should draw at full load. It will 
draw less current at light load or no load. Note 
that there are three currents listed. The first two 
currents’ (3.8–3.6) amperes indicate the amount of 
current the motor should draw when connected to 
208 or 230 volts, respectively. The last current rat-
ing of 1.8 amperes indicates the amount of full-load 
 current the motor should draw when connected to 
460 volts. The nameplate shown in Figure 10-1 lists 
the current as FLA (full-load amps). Some name-
plates simply list the current as AMPS.
Enclosure
The nameplate in Figure 10-1 indicates that the 
motor has an ODP type enclosure. Motors have dif-
ferent types of enclosures depending on the applica-
tion. Some of the common enclosures are:
ODP—Open drip proof. These are very com-
mon. The case has openings to permit venti-
lation through the motor windings.
TEFC—Totally enclosed fan cooled. The motor 
case is sealed to prevent the entrance of mois-
ture or dirt. A fan is used to help cool the motor.
TENV—Totally enclosed nonvented. These 
motors are generally used in harsh environ-
ments such as chemical plants. They are 
designed to be hosed down.
EXP—Explosionproof. Totally enclosed and 
nonvented. Designed to be used in areas that 
have hazardous atmospheres.
Duty Cycle
The nameplate in Figure 10-1 lists the duty cycle 
as continuous. The duty cycle indicates the amount 
of time the motor is expected to operate. A motor 
with a continuous duty cycle is rated to run continu-
ously at full load for 3 hours or more. Most motors 
are rated for continuous duty.
Intermittent-duty motors are intended to oper-
ate for short periods of time. An example of an 
intermittent-duty motor is the starter motor on an 
automobile. These motors develop a large amount 
of horsepower in a small case size. If these motors 
were to be operated continuously for a long period 
of time, they would be damaged by overheating.
Temperature Rise
The maximum temperature indicates the maxi-
mum amount of rise in temperature the motor will 
exhibit when operating continuously at full load. 
The nameplate indicates a maximum temperature 
rise of 40°C for this motor. If the motor is operated 
in an area with a high ambient temperature, it could 
cause the motor to overheat. If the motor is operated 
in an area with a low ambient temperature, it may 
operate at a lower temperature than that marked on 
the nameplate.

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
Service Factor
Motor service factor (SF) gives the allowable 
horsepower loading that may be carried out under 
the conditions specified for the service factor at 
rated voltage and frequency. It is determined by 
multiplying the horsepower rating on the nameplate 
by the service factor. It gives some parameters in 
 estimating horsepower needs and actual running 
horsepower requirements. The nameplate shown in 
Figure 10-1 indicates that the motor has a nameplate 
horsepower of 1 hp. The service factor, however, 
indicates that the motor is capable of producing 
1.15 hp (1 × 1.15). Selecting motors with a service 
factor greater than 1 allows for cooler winding tem-
peratures at rated load, protects against intermittent 
heat rises, and helps to offset low or unbalanced line 
voltages.
If the motor is operated in the service factor 
range, however, it will cause a reduction in motor 
speed and efficiency and will increase motor tem-
perature. This in turn will lessen the overall lifespan 
of the motor. For this reason, the motor should not 
run in the SF range continuously. Service factors are 
established for operations at rated voltage, frequency, 
and ambient temperature at sea level conditions.
If the horsepower requirements fall between 
standard size horsepower ratings, it is generally 
better to purchase a motor of the next higher horse-
power rating rather than depend on operating a 
motor in the service factor range.
Locked Rotor Code Letter
The locked rotor code letter is determined by the 
construction of the squirrel-cage rotor. It can be used 
to determine the approximate amount of inrush cur-
rent when the motor is started. The locked rotor code 
letter should not be confused with the NEMA design 
code on many motors. To determine the approxi-
mate starting current of a squirrel-cage induction 
motor using the locked rotor code letter, multiply 
the horsepower of the motor by the kVA per horse-
power factor, and divide by the applied voltage. If 
the motor is 3-phase, be sure to include the factor for 
the square root of 3 in the calculation. A chart show-
ing the kVA per horsepower rating for different code 
letters is shown in Table 10-6.
PROBLEM: A 15-horsepower, 3-phase motor is 
connected to 480 volts. The motor has a locked rotor 
code J. What is the approximate starting current for 
this motor?
⦁ Solution: The chart in Table 10-6 lists that 
the approximate mid-range value for code J is 7.5. ⦁

NEMA Design Code
Induction motors have different operating char-
acteristics determined by their design. Such factors 
as the amount of iron used in the stator, the wire size, 
the number turns of wire, and the rotor design all play 
a part in the operating characteristics of the motor. To 
obtain some uniformity in motor operating character-
istics, NEMA assigns code letters to general-purpose 
motors base on factors such as locked rotor torque, 
breakdown torque, slip, starting current, and other 
values. The NEMA code letters are: A, B, C, and D.
A—Motors with the code letter A exhibit nor-
mal starting torque and high to medium start-
ing current. These motors are designed for 
brief heavy overloads. They exhibit a maxi-
mum slip of 5% and are suited for a variety 
of applications such as fans and pumps.
B—Design B motors are the most common. They 
exhibit normal starting torque and low start-
ing current. They have high lock rotor starting 
torque to start most industrial loads. They have 
a maximum slip of 5% and are suitable for 
HVAC applications with fans, blowers, and 
pumps. The nameplate in Figure 10-1 indicates 
that this motor has a NEMA design code B.

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation 
201
C—Motors with the code letter C have high 
starting torques and low starting currents. 
They exhibit a maximum slip of 5% and are 
suited for equipment with high inertia starts 
such as positive displacement pumps.
D—Design D motors have high starting torque 
and low starting current. These motors 
exhibit a large amount of rotor slip, gener-
ally in the range of 5% to 13% when load 
is added. They are suitable for high inertial 
starts such as cranes and hoists.
Motor Efficiency
The full-load efficiency indicates the overall 
efficiency of the motor. The efficiency basically 
describes the amount of electrical energy supplied to 
the motor that is converted into kinetic energy. The 
remaining power is a loss and is mostly converted 
into heat. The nameplate in Figure 10-1 indicates that 
the motor in this example has an efficiency of 77%.
Insulation Classification
The nameplate indicates that this motor has a 
temperature classification B. The classification of 
insulation greatly affects the lifespan of the motor. 
Motor temperature is based on the hottest point in 
the motor under full-load operation and is deter-
mined by the temperature rise of the motor and the 
surrounding ambient air temperature. Motors that 
operate in hotter climates should have a higher insu-
lation temperature rating. The thermal capacity of 
different insulations is rated as A, B, F, and H. The 
chart shown in Figure 10-3 lists the amount of tem-
perature each is designed to handle over a 20,000-
hour period.
Model and Serial Numbers
The manufacturer assigns the model number. It 
can be used to purchase a motor with identical char-
acteristics. Many motors with the same model num-
ber can generally be obtained. The manufacturer 
also assigns the serial number. The serial number, 
however, is used to identify a particular motor. No 
other motor should have the same serial number.
Connection Diagrams
The connection diagrams for both low- and 
high-voltage connections are given on the name-
plate shown in Figure 10-1. Most dual-voltage 
motors contain nine leads in the terminal connec-
tion box. These leads are numbered T1 through 
T9. The connection diagram is used to make high- 
or low-voltage connection for the motor. In the 
diagram shown, if the motor is to be operated on 
low voltage, T4, T5, and T6 should be connected 
together. T1 and T7 should be connected together, 
T2 and T8 should be connected together, and T3 
and T9 should be connected together. Power is con-
nected to T1, T2, and T3.
If the motor is connected for high-voltage opera-
tion, T4 and T7 are connected together, T5 and T8 
are connected together, and T6 and T9 are connected 
together. Power is connected to T1, T2, and T3.
 MOTOR TABLES
There are different types of motors, such as DC, 
single-phase AC, 2-phase AC, and 3-phase AC. 
Different tables are used to list the running current 
for different types of motors.
• Table 10-1 (NEC Table 430.247) lists the 
 currents for DC motors;
• Table 10-2 (NEC Table 430.248) lists the 
 currents for single-phase AC motors;
• Table 10-3 (NEC Table 430.249) lists the 
 full-load currents for 2-phase AC motors;
• Table 10-4 (NEC Table 430.250) lists the full-
load currents for 3-phase motors.
The tables list the amount of current the motor 
is expected to require under full-load conditions.

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
A motor will have a lower current requirement if it is 
not under a full load.
These tables list the ampere rating of the motors 
according to horsepower and connected voltage. 
It should be noted that according to 430.6(A), the 
currents listed in these tables are to be used in deter-
mining conductor size, fuse size, and ground-fault 
protection instead of the motor’s nameplate rating. 
The motor overload size, however, is to be deter-
mined by using the current listed on the nameplate 
of the motor.
 DIRECT-CURRENT 
MOTORS
Table 10-1 lists the full-load running current for DC 
motors. The horsepower rating of the motor is given in 
the far left column. Rated voltages are listed across the 
top of the table. The table shows that a 1-horsepower 
motor will have a full-load current of 12.2 amperes 
when connected to 90 volts DC. If the 1-horsepower 
motor is designed to be connected to 240 volts DC, it 
will have a full-load current of 4.7 amperes.
 SINGLE-PHASE 
ALTERNATING-
CURRENT MOTORS
The current ratings for single-phase AC motors are 
given in Table 10-2. These ratings are for motors 
that operate at normal speeds and torques. Motors 
especially designed for low speed and high torque, or 
multispeed motors, shall have their running current 
determined from the nameplate rating of the motor.

203
EXAMPLE
A 3-horsepower single-phase motor 
is connected to a 208-volt supply. To 
properly size the conductors it is necessary to 
know the full-load current. The full-load current 
for single-phase motors is given in Table 10-2 
(NEC Table 430.248 ). The full-load current for 
a 3-horsepower motor connected to a 208-volt 
single-phase AC supply is given as 18.7 amperes.
 TWO-PHASE 
MOTORS
Although 2-phase motors are seldom used, 
Table  10-3 lists rated full-load currents for these 
motors. Like single-phase motors, 2-phase motors 
that are especially designed for low speed–high 
torque applications, and multispeed motors use the 
nameplate rating instead of the value shown in the 
chart. When a 2-phase, 3-wire system is used, the 
size of the neutral conductor must be increased by 
the square root of 2, or 1.41. This is because the 
NEC® TABLE 10-3
NEC® TABLE 10-2
voltages of a 2-phase system are 90° out of phase 
with each other, as shown in Figure 10-4.
EXAMPLE
A 60-horsepower, 460-volt motor is 
connected to a 2-phase supply. To determine 
the phase and neutral currents, refer to Table 10-3 
(NEC Table 430.249). The phase current is given 
as 67 amperes. To determine the neutral current, 
multiply the phase current by 1.41 (12). Neutral 
current = 67 × 1.41 = 94.5 amperes.

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
 DETERMINING 
CONDUCTOR SIZE FOR 
A SINGLE MOTOR
As stated by 430.6(A), the conductor size for a 
motor connection shall be based on the values 
from NEC tables that are included in this text as 
Table 10-1, Table 10-2, Table 10-3, and Table 10-4, 
instead of motor nameplate current. NEC 430.22 
states that the conductors supplying a single motor 
shall have an ampacity of not less than 125% of the 
motor full-load current. NEC Article 310 is used to 
select the conductor size after the ampacity has been 
determined. The exact table employed will be deter-
mined by the wiring conditions. Probably the most 
frequently used table is NEC Table 310.15(B)(16), 
which is provided in this text as Table 6-2.
Another factor that must be taken into consider-
ation when determining the conductor size is the tem-
perature rating of the devices and terminals as specified 
in 110.14(C). This section states that the conductor will 
be selected and coordinated so as to not exceed the low-
est temperature rating of any connected termination, 
any connected conductor, or any connected device. 
This means that regardless of the temperature rating of 
the conductor, the allowable ampacity must be selected 
from a column that does not exceed the temperature 
rating of the terminations. The conductors listed in the 
first column of Table 6-2 have a temperature rating of 
60°C (140°F), the conductors in the second column 
have a rating of 75°C (167°F), and the conductors in 
the third column have a rating of 90°C (194°F). The 
temperature ratings of devices such as circuit breakers, 
fuses, and terminals are found in UL product directo-
ries. The temperature rating may be found on the piece 
of equipment. As a general rule, the temperature rating 
of devices will not exceed 75°C (167°F).
When the termination temperature rating is not 
listed or known, 110.14(C) further states that for 
circuits rated at 100 amperes or less, or for 14 AWG 
through 1 AWG conductors, the ampacity of the 
wire, regardless of its temperature rating, will be 
selected from the 60°C (140°F) column. This does 
not mean that only those insulation types listed in 
the 60°C (140°F) column must be used, but that the 
ampacity must be selected from that column. For 
example, assume that a copper conductor with type 
XHHW insulation is to be connected to a 50-ampere 
 THREE-PHASE 
MOTORS
Table 10-4 (NEC Table 430.250) is used to deter-
mine the full-load current of a 3-phase motor. 
The full-load current of low speed–high torque 
and multispeed motors is to be determined from 
the nameplate rating. The table has a note that 
addresses synchronous motors. Notice that the 
right side of the table is devoted to the full-load 
currents of synchronous-type motors. The cur-
rents listed are for motors that are to be operated at 
unity or 100% power factor. Because synchronous 
motors are often made to have a leading power 
factor by overexcitation of the rotor current, the 
full-load current rating must be increased when 
this is done. If the motor is operated at 90% power 
factor, the rated full-load current in the table is to 
be increased by 10%. If the motor is to be operated 
at 80% power factor, the full-load current is to be 
increased by 25%.
EXAMPLE
A 150-horsepower, 460-volt synchronous 
motor is to be operated at 80% power 
factor. What will be the full-load current rating of 
the motor?

D. This section states that conductors rated at 75°C 
(167°F) or higher may be selected from the 75°C 
(167°F) column in the table even if the ampacity 
is 100 amperes or less. This code does not apply to 
motors that do not have a NEMA design code mark-
ing on their nameplate. Most motors manufactured 
before 1996 do not have a NEMA design code. 
The NEMA design code letter should not be con-
fused with the code letter that indicates the type of 
s quirrel-cage rotor used in the motor.
circuit breaker that does not have a listed tem-
perature rating. According to Table 6-2, an 8 AWG 
copper conductor with XHHW insulation is rated 
to carry 55 amperes as given in the 90°C (194°F) 
column, but the temperature rating of the circuit 
breaker is unknown. Therefore, the wire size must 
be selected from the ampacity ratings in the 60°C 
(140°F) column. A 6 AWG conductor may be used.
NEC 110.14(C)(1)(a)(4) has a special provision 
for motors marked with NEMA design code B, C, or

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
PROBLEM: A 30-horsepower, 3-phase squirrel-
cage induction motor is connected to a 480-volt line. 
The conductors are run in conduit to the motor. The 
termination temperature rating of the devices is not 
known. Copper conductors with THWN insulation 
are to be used for motor connection. The motor 
nameplate is not marked with a NEMA design code. 
What size conductor must be used?
⦁ Solution: The first step is to determine the 
full-load current of the motor. This is determined 
from Table 10-4. The table indicates a current of 
40 amperes for this motor. This current must be 
increased by 25% according to 430.22.
40  1.25  50  amperes
Table 6-2 (NEC Table 310.15(B)(16)) is used 
to determine the conductor size. Locate the column 
that contains THWN insulation. THWN is located in 
the 75°C (167°F) column. Because this circuit is less 
than 101 amperes and the termination temperature 
is not known, the conduction size must be selected 
from the allowable ampacities listed in the 60°C 
(140°F) column. A size 6 AWG conductor with type 
THWN insulation may be used. ⦁
For circuits rated over 100 amperes, or for con-
ductor sizes larger than 1 AWG, 110.14(C) states 
that the ampacities listed in the 75°C (167°F) col-
umn may be used to select wire sizes unless a con-
ductor with a 60°C (140°F) temperature rating has 
been selected for use. For example, types TW and 
UF insulation are listed in the 60°C (140°F) column. 
If one of these two insulation types has been speci-
fied, the wire size must be chosen from the 60°C 
(140°F) column regardless of the ampere rating of 
the circuit.
 OVERLOAD SIZE
In determining the overload size for a motor, the 
nameplate current rating of the motor is to be used 
instead of the current values listed in the tables 
(430.6). Other factors such as the service factor (SF) 
or temperature rating (°C) of the motor are also to 
be used to determine the overload size of a motor. 
The temperature rating of the motor is an indication 
of the type of insulation used in the motor windings 
and should not be confused with termination tem-
perature discussed in 110.14(C).
NEC 430.32, which covers overload protection 
in continuous-duty motors, is reproduced here as 
Table 10-5; 430.32(A)(1) is used to determine the 
overload size for motors of 1 horsepower or more. 
The overload size is based on a percentage of the 
full-load current of the motor.
PROBLEM: A 25-horsepower, 3-phase induc-
tion motor has a nameplate rating of 32 amperes. 
The nameplate also shows a temperature rise of 
30°C. What is the overload size for this motor?
⦁ Solution: As indicated by 430.32(A)(1) in 
Table 10-5, the overload size is to be 125% of the 
full-load current rating of the motor.
32  1.25  40 amperes
If for some reason this overload size does not permit 
the motor to start without tripping out, 430.32(C) 
permits the overload size to be increased to a 
maximum of 140% for this motor. If this increase 
NEC® TABLE 10-5

(A) More Than 1 Horsepower. Each motor used in a 
continuous duty application and rated more than 1 hp 
shall be protected against overload by one of the means 
in 430.32(A)(1) through (A)(4).
(1) Separate Overload Device. A separate overload 
device that is responsive to motor current. This device 
shall be selected to trip or shall be rated at no more 
than the following percent of the motor nameplate

in overload size does not solve the starting problem, 
the overload may be shunted out of the circuit dur-
ing the starting period in accordance with 430.35(A) 
and 430.35(B). ⦁
 DETERMINING 
LOCKED-ROTOR 
CURRENT
There are two basic methods for determining the 
locked-rotor current (starting current) of a squirrel-
cage motor, depending on the information available. 
If the nameplate lists code letters that range from A 
to V, they indicate the type of rotor bars used when 
the rotor was made. Different types of bars are used 
to make motors designed for different applications. 
The type of bar largely determines the locked-rotor 
current of the motor. The locked-rotor current of the 
motor is used to determine the maximum starting 
current. NEC Table 430.7(B), reproduced here as 
Table 10-6, lists the different code letters and gives 
the locked-rotor kilovolt-amperes per horsepower. 
The starting current can be determined by multiply-
ing the kVA rating by the horsepower rating and 
then dividing by the applied voltage.
PROBLEM: A 15-horsepower, 3-phase squirrel-
cage motor with a code letter of K is connected to 
a 240-volt line. Determine the locked-rotor current.
⦁ Solution: The table lists 8.0 to 8.99 kVA per 
horsepower for a motor with a code letter of K. An 
average value of 8.5 will be used. ⦁
8.5  15  127.5 kVA (or 127,500 VA)
127,500
240  13  306.7 amperes
The locked-rotor current for motors with NEMA 
design codes is determined using NEC Tables 
430.251(A) and 430.251(B). NEC Table 430.251(A) 
lists the locked-rotor currents for single-phase 
motors, and Table 430.251(B) lists the locked-rotor 
currents for polyphase motors.
 SHORT-CIRCUIT 
PROTECTION
The ratings of the short-circuit protective devices are 
set forth in NEC Table 430.52, reproduced here as 
Table 10-7. The far left-hand column lists the type 
of motor that is to be protected. To the right of this 
are four columns that list different types of short-
circuit protective devices: nontime-delay fuse, dual-
element time-delay fuse, instantaneous trip circuit 
breaker, and inverse-time circuit breaker. Although 
it is permissible to use nontime-delay fuses and 
instantaneous trip circuit breakers, most motor cir-
cuits are protected by dual-element time-delay fuses 
or inverse-time circuit breakers.
Each of these columns lists a percentage of the 
motor current that is to be used in determining fuse 
size. The current listed in the appropriate motor 
table is to be used instead of nameplate current. 
According to 430.52(C)(1), the protective device is

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
C, or D. Motors manufactured before this require-
ment, however, do not list design letters on the 
nameplate. Most common squirrel-cage motors used 
in industry actually fall into the design B classifica-
tion and, for the purposes of selecting fuse size, are 
considered to be design B unless otherwise listed.
PROBLEM 1: A 100-horsepower, 3-phase 
squirrel-cage induction motor is connected to a 
 240-volt line. A dual-element time-delay fuse is to 
be used as the short-circuit protective device. What 
is the correct fuse rating?
⦁ Solution: Table 10-4 (NEC Table 430.250) 
lists a full-load current of 248 amperes for this 
motor. Table 10-7 (NEC Table 430.52) indicates that 
a dual-element time-delay fuse is to be set at 175% 
of the full-load current for an AC polyphase (more 
to have a rating or setting not exceeding the value 
calculated in accord with Table 10-7. Exception 1 
of this section, however, states that if the calculated 
value does not correspond to a standard size or rat-
ing of a fuse or circuit breaker, it shall be permissi-
ble to use the next higher standard size. The standard 
sizes of fuses and circuit breakers are listed in NEC 
240.6, reproduced here as Table 10-8.
Table 10-7 lists squirrel-cage motor types by 
design letter instead of code letter. Design letters 
are assigned by NEMA. As required by 430.7(A)(9), 
motor nameplates are marked with design letter B,

240.6 Standard Ampere Ratings.
(A) Fuses and Fixed-Trip Circuit Breakers. The standard 
ampere ratings for fuses and inverse time circuit 
breakers shall be considered 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 
60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300,

2500, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 amperes. Additional 
standard ampere ratings for fuses shall be 1, 3, 6, 10, and 
601. The use of fuses and inverse time circuit breakers 
with nonstandard ampere ratings shall be permitted.
(B) Adjustable-Trip Circuit Breakers. The rating of 
adjustable-trip circuit breakers having external means 
for adjusting the current setting (long-time pickup 
setting), not meeting the requirements of 240.6(C), shall 
be the maximum setting possible.
(C) Restricted Access Adjustable-Trip Circuit Breakers. 
A circuit breaker(s) that has restricted access to the 
adjusting means shall be permitted to have an ampere 
rating(s) that is equal to the adjusted current setting 
(long-time pickup setting). Restricted access shall be 
defined as located behind one of the following:
(1)  Removable and sealable covers over the adjusting 
means
(2) Bolted equipment enclosure doors
(3) Locked doors accessible only to qualified personnel

direct-current motors (constant voltage), the instan-
taneous trip circuit-breaker rating is given at 250%.
140  2.50  350 amperes
Because 350 amperes is one of the standard ratings of 
circuit breakers listed in Table 10-8, that rating breaker 
will be used as the short-circuit protective device. ⦁
The overload size is determined from 430.32(A)(1). 
Because there is no service factor or temperature 
rise listed for the motor, the heading ALL OTHER 
MOTORS will be used. The motor nameplate cur-
rent will be increased by 15%.

3: A 150-horsepower, 3-phase 
 squirrel-cage induction motor is connected to 440 volts. 
The motor nameplate lists the following information:

than one phase) squirrel-cage motor. Because this 
motor does not list a design letter on the nameplate, 
it will be assumed that the motor is design B.
248  1.75  434  amperes
The next standard fuse rating above this calculated 
value listed in Table 10-8 [240(A)] is 450 amperes. A 
450-ampere fuse will be used to protect this motor circuit.
If for some reason this fuse will not permit the 
motor to start, 430.52(C)(1), Exception No. 2(b), 
states that the rating of a dual-element time-delay 
fuse may be increased to a maximum of 225% of the 
full-load motor current.
It should be noted that because this is a maximum 
value, the fuse size cannot be increased to the next 
higher value, but must be reduced to the closest stan-
dard value without exceeding the maximum value. For 
example, 248 amperes × 2.25 (225%) = 558 amperes. 
In this case, a 500-ampere fuse would be employed.
Determine the conductor size, overload size, and 
short-circuit protection for the following motors. ⦁
PROBLEM 2: A 40-horsepower, 240-volt 
DC motor has a nameplate current rating of 132 
amperes. The conductors are to be copper with TW 
insulation. The short-circuit protective device is to 
be an instantaneous trip circuit breaker. Refer to 
Figure 10-5. The termination temperature rating of 
the connected devices is not known.
⦁ Solution: The conductor size must be deter-
mined from the current listed in Table 10-1. This 
current is to be increased by 25%.
140  1.25  175 amperes
Table 6-2 (NEC Table 310.15(B)(16)) is used to 
find the conductor size. Although 110.14(C) states 
that for circuit currents of 100 amperes or greater, 
the allowable ampacity of the conductor is to be 
determined from the 75°C (167°F) column, in this 
instance, the specified insulation type is located in 
the 60°C (140°F) column. Therefore, the conductor 
size must be determined using the 60°C (140°F) col-
umn. A 4/0 AWG conductor will be used.
The circuit-breaker rating is selected from 
Table 10-7. The current value from Table 10-1 is 
used instead of the motor nameplate rating. Under

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
The percentage of full-load current listed in Table 
10-7 is used to determine the circuit-breaker rating. 
The table indicates a factor of 250% for squirrel-
cage motors with a NEMA design code B. The value 
of current from Table 10-4 is used in this calculation.
180  2.50  450 amperes
One of the standard circuit-breaker ratings 
listed in 240.6(A) in Table 10-8 is 450 amperes. 
A 450-ampere inverse-time circuit breaker will be 
used as the short-circuit protective device.
 MULTIPLE MOTOR 
CALCULATIONS
When several motors or loads are to be connected to 
a single branch circuit, NEC 403.53(C) requires that 
the branch circuit be protected by fuses or inverse-
time circuit breakers.
The main feeder short-circuit protective device and 
conductor size for a multiple motor connection are set 
forth in 430.62(A) and 430.24. In this example, three 
motors are connected to a common feeder. The feeder 
is 440 volts, 3-phase, and the conductors are to be 
 copper with type THHN insulation. Each motor is to 
be protected with a dual-element time-delay fuse and a 
separate overload device. The main feeder is also pro-
tected by a dual-element time-delay fuse. The termina-
tion temperature rating of the connected devices is not 
known. The motor nameplate ratings are as follows:

The conductors are to be copper with type THHN

an inverse-time circuit breaker. The termination tem-
perature rating is not known. Refer to Figure 10-6.
⦁ Solution: The conductor size is determined 
from the current listed in Table 10-4 (NEC Table 
430.250) and then increased by 25%. ⦁
180  1.25  225 amperes
Table 6-2 (NEC Table 310.15(B)(16)) is used to 
determine conductor size. Type THHN insulation 
is located in the 90°C (194°F) column. Because the 
motor nameplate indicates a NEMA code B, the con-
ductor size will be selected from the 75°C (167°F) 
column. The conductor size will be 4/0 AWG.
The overload size is determined from the name-
plate current and 430.32(A)(1). Because the motor 
has a marked service factor of 1.25, the motor name-
plate current will be increased by 25%.

27  175%  47.25 amperes
The next higher standard fuse rating listed in Table 
10-8 is 50 amperes. A 50-ampere fuse will be used.
The overload size is calculated from the name-
plate current. The demand factors in 430.32(A)(1) 
are used for the overload calculation. Because this 
motor has a marked service factor of 1.25, the motor 
nameplate current will be increased by 25%.
23  1.25  28.75 amperes
Motor #2 Calculations
Figure 10-8 shows an example for the calcula-
tion of motor #2. Table 10-4 lists a full-load current 
of 77 amperes for this motor. This value of current is 
increased by 25% for the calculation of the conduc-
tor current.
77  1.25  96.25 amperes
Table 6-2 indicates that a 1 AWG conductor 
should be used for this motor connection. The con-
ductor size is chosen from the 60°C (140°F) column 
Motor #1 Calculations
The first step is to calculate the values for 
motor amperage, conductor size, overload size, and 
 short-circuit protective device size for each motor. 
These values for motor #1 are shown in Figure 10-7. 
The motor amperage rating from Table 10-4 is used to 
determine the conductor and fuse size. The amperage 
rating must be increased by 25% for the conductor size.
27  1.25  33.75 amperes
The conductor size is now chosen from Table 6-2. 
Although type THHN insulation is located in the 90°C 
(194°F) column, the conductor size will be chosen 
from the 75°C (167°F) column, per 110.14(C)(1)(d).
33.75 amperes  10 AWG
The fuse rating is determined by using the motor 
current rating from Table 10-4 and the demand factor 
from Table 10-7. The percent of full-load current for 
a dual-element time-delay fuse protecting a squirrel-
cage motor listed as Design C is 175%. The current 
listed in Table 10-4 will be increased by 175%.

CHAPTER 10  Motor Installation
101  1.10  111 amperes
The conductor size is calculated by using this 
current rating and increasing it by 25%.
111  1.25  138.75 amperes
Table 6-2 indicates that a 1/0 AWG conductor 
will be acceptable for this circuit. Because the cir-
cuit current is over 100 amperes, the conductor is 
chosen from the 75°C (167°F) column.
The fuse rating is determined from Table 10-7. 
The percentage of full-load current for a synchro-
nous motor is 175%.
111  1.75  194.25 amperes
The next highest standard rating fuse listed in 
Table 10-8 is 200 amperes. Thus, 200-ampere fuses 
will be used to protect this circuit.
This motor does not have a marked service fac-
tor or a marked temperature rise. The overload size 
is calculated by increasing the nameplate current by 
15%, as indicated in 430.32(A)(1).
96  1.15  110.4 amperes
Main Feeder Calculation
An example of the main feeder calculation 
is shown in Figure 10-10. The conductor size is 
 calculated by increasing the highest amperage rating 
of the motors connected to the feeder by 25% and 
then adding the amperage ratings of the other motors 
to this amount. In this example, the 100-horsepower 
synchronous motor has the highest running current. 
This current will be increased by 25%, and then the 
running currents of the other motors as determined 
from Table 10-4 will be added.
111  1.25  138.75 amperes
138.75  77  27  242.75 amperes
Table 6-2 indicates that 250 kcmil conductors are to 
be used as the main feeder conductors. The conduc-
tors were chosen from the 75°C (167°F) column.
The size of the short-circuit protective device is 
determined by 430.62(A). The Code states that the 
rating or setting of the short-circuit protective device 
shall not be greater than the highest rating or setting 
of the branch-circuit short-circuit and ground-fault 
protective device plus the sum of the full-load cur-
rents of the other motors. The highest fuse size was 
because the circuit current is less than 100 amperes 
in accord with 110.14(C), and the motor nameplate 
does not indicate a NEMA design code.
The fuse size will be determined from Table 10-7. 
The value is to be increased by 175% for squirrel-
cage motors other than design E.
77  175%  134.75 amperes
The next higher standard fuse size listed in Table 
10-8 is 150 amperes. Thus, 150-ampere fuses will be 
used to protect this circuit.
The overload size is determined from 430.32(A)(1). 
The motor nameplate lists a temperature rise of 
40°C for this motor. The nameplate current will be 
increased by 25%.
72  1.25  90 amperes
Motor #3 Calculations
Motor #3 is a synchronous motor intended to 
operate with a 90% power factor. Figure 10-9 shows 
an example of this calculation. The note at the bot-
tom of Table 10-4 indicates that the listed current is 
to be increased by 10% for synchronous motors with 
a listed power factor of 90%.

200  77  27  304 amperes
The highest-rated standard fuse listed in Table 10-8, 
without going over 304 amperes, is 300 amperes. Thus, 
300-ampere fuses will be used as the short-circuit 
protective devices for this circuit.
that of the 100-horsepower synchronous motor. The 
fuse calculation for this motor was 200 amperes. 
The running currents of the other two motors will 
be added to this value to determine the rating of the 
fuse for the main feeder.

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor 
217
 LOADING ON 
ALTERNATING- 
CURRENT CIRCUITS
To understand power factor and especially how to 
correct power factor, it is necessary to first under-
stand the different types of alternating-current loads, 
their characteristics, and how they interact with 
each other. There are three basic types of loads that 
can exist in AC circuits: resistive, inductive, and 
 capacitive.
Resistive—Resistive loads contain pure resis-
tive elements. A pure resistive element causes the 
voltage and current to be in phase with each other, 
Figure 11-1.
All wire contains some amount of resistance. 
Other resistive loads are incandescent lighting, 
electric heating elements, the amount of true power 
produced by motors, and the power losses associ-
ated with transformers or other devices in the form 
of heat. Resistance is the only load that can produce 
true power or watts. Electricity is a form of pure 
energy. The laws of physics dictate that energy can 
be neither created nor destroyed, but its form can be 
changed. Watts is the measure of the amount of elec-
trical energy that is converted into some other form. 
Electric heating elements convert electrical energy 
into thermal energy, and  electric motors convert 
electrical energy into kinetic energy. True power or 
watts can be produced only when both the voltage 
and current have the same polarity. If the waveforms 
shown in Figure 11-1 are divided into quadrants, it 
can be seen that electrical energy is being converted 
during each quadrant, Figure 11-2.
Quadrant 1 (volts   amps   watts)
Quadrant 2 (volts   amps   watts)
Quadrant 3 (volts   amps   watts)
Quadrant 4 (volts   amps   watts)
Inductive—Inductive loads contain inductive 
elements such as motors, transformers, and fil-
ter chokes. Although inductors are constructed by 
winding turns of wire around some type of core 
material, and wire does contain resistance, the flow 
of current is not limited solely because of resistance. 
Inductors limit the flow of current by inductive 
reactance. When current begins to flow through an 
inductor, a magnetic field expands around the induc-
tor, Figure 11-3.
This expanding or moving magnetic field cuts 
through the wires of the inductor and induces 
a voltage into them. Induced voltage is always 
opposite in polarity to the voltage that produces it.

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor
Therefore, the induced voltage opposes the applied 
voltage. It is this opposing voltage that limits the 
current through an inductor. This opposing volt-
age is called reactance, symbolized by the letter 
X. Because this reactance is caused by inductance, 
it is called  inductive reactance and is symbolized 
by XL. The quantity of inductance is the henry and 
is symbolized by the letter L. Because inductive 
reactance is a counter voltage, it is subject to the 
three factors that determine the amount of induced 
voltage:
Number of turns of wire
Strength of the magnetic field
Speed of the cutting action
The number of turns of wire and strength of 
the magnetic field are the factors that determine the 
inductance, or henrys, of the inductor. The speed of 
the cutting action is determined by the frequency of 
the AC source. Inductive reactance is measured in 
ohms and can be determined by the formula:
XL  2p fL
where f is the frequency in hertz, and L is the induc-
tance in henrys.

60 Hz line. What is the inductive reactance?

In a pure inductive load the current will lag the 
voltage by 90°, Figure 11-4.
Because wire is used to construct inductors, 
they all contain some amount of resistance and 
are therefore not a pure inductive load. However, 
when the inductive reactance is 10 times greater

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor 
219
Inductors do not produce true power or watts 
because electrical energy is not converted into 
some other form. When current rises through 
an inductor, a magnetic field expands outward, 
as shown in Figure 11-3. The power source 
provided power to produce the magnetic field. 
When the current decreases, the magnetic field 
collapses back again, cutting the windings of 
the conductor and inducing a voltage into them, 
Figure 11-5.
The electrical energy necessary to create the 
magnetic field was stored in the electromagnetic 
field and then given back when the field collapsed. 
Although the only true power produced in the 
 inductor is due to the resistance of the wire and core 
losses caused by eddy current and hysteresis losses, 
the voltage and current supplied to the inductor 
are very real. The power associated with reactive 
devices is called VARs (volt amps reactive). VARs 
are sometimes referred to as wattless power. If the 
waveform shown in Figure 11-4 is divided into 
quadrants, it will be seen that the average power is 
zero, Figure 11-6.

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor
Apparent Power
Apparent power is generally called volt amps. 
It is the value that can be obtained by multiplying 
the circuit voltage by the circuit current. Apparent 
power and true power would be the same in a circuit 
that contained only resistive load, but if a reactive 
load were in the same circuit, volt amps and watts 
would not be the same. Reactive power, or VARs, is 
90° out of phase with true power, or watts. Apparent 
power can be determined using the formula
VA  2Watts2  VARs2
EXAMPLE
An AC circuit contains a 1500-watt electric 
heating element and an inductor rated at 
1200 VARs. What is the apparent power?
 
 VA  215002  12002
 
 VA  12,250,000  1,440,000
 
 VA  13,690,000
 
 VA  1920.9
Capacitive—Capacitive loads consist almost 
entirely of capacitors connected to the line. 
Capacitive loads cause the current to lead the volt-
age by 90°, Figure 11-7.
Like the inductor, the capacitor is a reactive 
load. It does not produce true power because it does 
not convert electrical energy into some other form. 
When voltage rises, current flows to the plates of the 
capacitor, and it becomes charged. When the volt-
age decreases, the capacitor discharges and gives 
the energy required to charge it back to the circuit. 
Also like inductors, the power rating for capacitors 
is VARs. At this point the similarity between induc-
tors and capacitors ends. They are basically exactly 
opposite electrically. Inductors cause the current 
to lag the voltage by 90°, and capacitors cause the 
current to lead the voltage by 90°. Inductors store 
energy in the form of an electromagnetic field; 
capacitors store energy in the form of an electro-
static field. Because inductors cause current to lag 
the voltage and capacitors cause current to lead 
the voltage, when they are connected in a circuit 
together, they are 180° out of phase with each other.
EXAMPLE
A circuit contains an electric heating 
element that produces 2500 watts, an 
inductor rated at 3000 VARs and a capacitor rated 
at 2000 VARs. What is the apparent power?
 VA  3Watts2  (VARsL  VARsC)2
 VA  325002  (3000  2000)2
 VA  225002  10002
 VA  2692.6
The current-limiting effect of a capacitor is 
called capacitive reactance and is symbolized as XC. 
Capacitors are rated in farads. The farad is an extremely 
large amount of capacitance. For this reason, capaci-
tors are generally rated in microfarads, nanofarads, or 
picofarads. A microfarad is one-millionth of a farad, a 
nanofarad is one-billionth of a farad, and a picofarad is 
one-trillionth of a farad. When calculating capacitive 
values, it is necessary to take the capacitor rating into 
consideration. For example, capacitive reactance can 
be determined using the formula:

What is the capacitive reactance of a 
20-microfarad capacitor connected in 
a 60 Hz line? (Note: The Greek letter mu (μ) 
is generally used to represent micro.) Twenty 
microfarads is 20-millionths of a farad, or 
0.000020 farad. Scientific calculators allow 
entering numbers in scientific notation. These 
calculators generally contain a key marked EE 
or EXP, Figure 11-8.
In scientific notation, micro is 10−6. Scientific 
calculators also contain a reciprocal key, Figure 11-9. 
The reciprocal key is used to divide any number on 
the display into 1.

When entering the scientific notation value of 10 to

using a scientific calculator, enter the following:

All three of these loads are generally present 
to varying degrees in nearly all AC circuits. The 
actual current-limiting effect, phase angle of current 
and voltage, apparent power, true power, and reac-
tive power of any AC circuit is determined by the 
amount of each of these three loads. Industrial loads 
are generally inductive because of the presence of 
electromagnetic devices such as motors and trans-
formers. For this reason, the current generally lags 
the voltage by some amount in industrial circuits. 
The amount of out-of-phase condition is determined

resistance, and the length is equal to 0.6. Impedance 
is drawn from the point where resistance and induc-
tive reactance join to the point where they would 
intersect. The length of the line is equal to 0.781, and 
the angle between impedance and resistance is 50.2°.
Power Factor
Power factor is the ratio of true power as com-
pared to apparent power. In Figure 11-11, there is 
a phase angle difference of 50.2° between the true 
power (watts) and the apparent power (volt amps). 
The power factor is the cosine of this angle:

 PF   cos 50.2

Power factor is expressed as a percent. The decimal 
fraction 0.64 is changed to a percent by moving the dec-
imal two places to the right and adding a percent sign.
 PF  64%

using the resistance and impedance. Angle theta 
can also be determined using apparent power, true 
power, and reactive power.

The Importance of Power Factor
Power factor is of great concern especially to 
utility companies. Utility companies charge their 
customers based on the number of watt-hours con-
sumed. However, the utility company must supply 
the apparent power. In the previous example, the cir-
cuit in question has a power factor of 64%. Assume 
that an industrial location has a 64% power factor, 
and the true power consumption is 450 kW. Also 
assume that the voltage supplying the plant is 480 
volts, 3 phase. The amount of current necessary to 
supply the true power is
 I  450,000
480  13
 
 I  541.3 A
The utility company must supply the apparent 
power.

I(True)

0.64
      I(Apparent)  845.8 A
The utility company is supplying 845.8 amperes 
for a load that actually requires 541.3 amperes. 
Conductors are rated by the amount of current that 
they can carry. This excess current affects power 
lines, transformer windings, and any other types of 
loads that contain wire. If the power factor were to 
be corrected to 90%, the current would drop from 
845.8 amperes to 601.4 amperes.
 I(Apparent)  541.3
0.9
Utility companies generally charge industrial 
plants a higher rate for power when the power fac-
tor drops below a certain level. As a general rule, 
utility companies do not try to measure the power 
factor of residential locations. Residential loads are 
mostly resistive. Motor-driven devices such as air-
conditioning units will cause a lagging power factor. 
To compensate for this, the utility company gener-
ally installs capacitors on power lines to reduce the 
current caused by low-power factor, Figure 11-12.

correction.

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor
 POWER FACTOR 
MEASUREMENT
When an industrial plant has a lagging power factor, 
the value of the power factor should be maintained 
between 0.9 and 1.0, if possible. This condition is 
desirable because of a number of factors, including 
the need to reduce the reactive current to achieve 
more capacity for useful current on the mains, 
feeders, and subfeeders; the need for better voltage 
 regulation and stability; and the desirability of obtain-
ing lower power rates from the power  company.
As shown in the following list, there are several 
ways of determining the power factor of an entire 
plant, a single feeder, or even a branch circuit. The 
power factor can be determined by the use of
 1. a power factor meter.
 2. a kilovarmeter and kilowattmeter.
 3. wattmeters or kilowattmeters in combination 
with voltmeters and ammeters.
The last of the three methods listed is the most 
convenient one in terms of the connections to be 
made. However, the use of a permanently connected 
kilovarmeter is also convenient. When the power 
factor of the plant is 1.0 (unity), the kilovarmeter 
reads zero.
The instrument has a zero center scale. The nee-
dle indicates the number of reactive kilovolt amperes 
( kiloVARs) by which the system is lagging or lead-
ing. The electrician can tell at a glance whether it is 
necessary to supply either a larger or a smaller lead-
ing component to the system. This determination is 
a simple matter when a synchronous condenser is 
available. (See the following section on synchronous 
condensers.)
When a synchronous condenser is connected 
across the line, it supplies the leading component 
of the current needed to offset or counteract the 
existing lagging component of the current. The 
plans show the locations of the two synchronous 
condensers used to correct the power factor of 
feeder duct No. 2.
Power Factor Correction
Power or true power is expressed in kilowatts. 
The term kilovolt amperes, which means volts 
 multiplied by amperes and divided by 1000, is called 
the apparent power. Reactive power is not power at 
all, but rather is a component that is 90° out of phase 
with the true power. Reactive power is measured in 
volt-amperes reactive (VAR).
The total motor load on feeder duct No. 2 is 
approximately 927 horsepower. This load requires 
nearly 1293 amperes per leg to supply the 3-phase, 
480-volt, 60-hertz motors. The apparent power 
required for this load is found as shown by the fol-
lowing calculation:
 Apparent power  1293  480  1.73
1000
  1074 kVA
The actual value of the apparent power is obtain-
able only when all of the motors are running and 
loaded.
For the present example, assume that the power 
factor is 0.74. Recall that the power factor is the 
cosine of the angle theta. When the angle that cor-
responds to a cosine of 0.74 is determined using a 
scientific calculator or a table of trigonometric func-
tions, it is found to be 42°, Figure 11-13. The  kilovar 
(kVAR) reactive component in the power group is 
equal to the value of the apparent power (in kVA) 
multiplied by the sine of θ:
 
   kVAR  kVA (sine 42)
 
 
  1074  0.67
 
 
  720 kilovolt-amperes reactive
Because 180° separate the leading component sup-
plied by the synchronous condenser and the lagging 
component caused by the inductive characteristics of 
the motor load (90° lead and 90° lag, respectively), 
the leading kVAR value needed to cancel the lagging 
kVAR value is 720. Two 350 kVAR synchronous con-
densers are to be installed to provide a leading power 
factor and reduce the lagging power factor produced 
by the induction motors and other inductive loads. 
It is not necessary to reduce the reactance to zero as 
shown in Figure 11-14. This illustration shows that 
the  synchronous condenser is supplying 520 kVAR 
of leading reactance. This value reduces the original 
lagging reactance to 200 kVAR. However, the power 
factor is increased to 0.97 and the apparent power

to 821 kVA. The  kW  value is unchanged, as it is 
established by the loading of the motors and the fric-
tion losses in the motor. Both of these quantities are 
actual loads.
 THE SYNCHRONOUS 
CONDENSERS
The synchronous condenser is a rotating electrical 
machine, as shown in Figure 11-15. It is similar to 
a synchronous motor or an AC generator. However, 
in operation, there are no electrical or mechanical 
loads connected to it. The only power required for 
the operation of a synchronous condenser is the 
power needed to supply its own small losses.
The synchronous condenser has a stationary 
3-phase armature winding rated at 480 volts and 
60  hertz. The rotating field of the condenser is 
excited from a source of DC, sometimes a small DC 
generator mounted on the shaft of the synchronous 
condenser. The schematic diagrams of the controller 
and the control scheme for this synchronous con-
denser are shown in Figure 11-16.
Large synchronous machines often employ the 
use of a brushless exciter instead of a generator 
mounted on the motor shaft. The brushless exciter 
consists of a 3-phase wound armature surrounded by 
stationary electromagnets, Figure 11-17.
The 3-phase armature winding is connected to 
a 3-phase bridge rectifier. The output of the rectifier 
supplies the DC excitation current to the rotor field, 
Figure 11-18. A brushless exciter assembly is shown 
in Figure 11-19.
The amount of excitation to the rotor field of 
the synchronous condenser is controlled by the 
amount of DC excitation to the stationary electro-
magnets. The brushless exciter eliminates prob-
lems with brushes and commutators associated 
with small DC generators mounted on the synchro-
nous machine.
The operation of the synchronous condenser is 
such that if the rotor field is underexcited, it will 
exhibit a lagging power factor as any other type of 
AC motor. If the field current is increased to the 
point that the condenser power factor is 1, or unity, 
the current and voltage are in phase and there is no 
lead or lag. This is generally referred to as normal 
excitation. If the excitation current is increased

above normal, the synchronous condenser will 
exhibit a leading power factor in the same way it 
does when capacitance is added to the circuit. The 
amount of overexcitation determines the amount of 
leading power.
When the industrial plant is not operating at its 
full capacity, the excitation must be regulated to 
maintain a low kVAR value in the feeder. Periodic 
inspections and adjustments as necessary will ensure 
that a high power factor is maintained. The power 
factor is corrected or increased only from the point 
of attachment of the synchronous condenser back 
to the source of supply, Figure 11-20. Power factor 
corrections have no effect on the current in the plug-
in ducts or the motor branch circuits.
Therefore, to cancel the lagging currents in 
the feeder duct, the synchronous condenser must 
be overexcited. Because this installation does not 
employ the use of automatic controls, the strength of 
the field excitation is increased by adjusting the field 
rheostat on the control panelboard.
When the synchronous condenser is started from 
the control panelboard, it performs in the same man-
ner as any synchronous motor, with the exception 
that a load is not connected. Before the condenser 
starts, a normally closed contactor shorts out the field 
windings to prevent a high-voltage buildup. As soon 
as the machine is close to its synchronous speed, the 
contactor removes the short and connects the field 
to the exciter. As soon as the normal field excitation 
is achieved, the current decreases to a relatively low 
value. The AC ammeter on the control panelboard 
will rise rapidly when the field rheostat is adjusted 
for either underexcitation or  overexcitation.
When the machine is underexcited by a lower 
than normal field current, the current lags the volt-
age. But, when the field excitation is stronger than 
normal, the current leads the voltage and provides a 
leading kVAR value to counteract the lagging kVAR 
value in the feeder duct. This lagging value is caused 
by the inductive effect of the AC motor load. By 
using the field rheostat to regulate the field excita-
tion, any value of leading kVAR is made available 
up to the rated output of the machine.
If the plant is running at full capacity, both syn-
chronous condensers must be used. The condensers 
should be adjusted so that their kVAR outputs are

power factor is improved to a value close to unity.
 THE TIE-IN
Each of the 350 kVAR synchronous condensers is 
connected to the No. 2 feeder busway. The wiring for 
these connections is sized according to 430.22. The 
conductors must have an ampacity of at least 125% 
of the full-load current rating of the synchronous 
condenser that is supplied by the manufacturer. Using 
370 amperes as an example, when 370 is multiplied 
by 1.25, the result is 463 amperes, the required 
ampacity of the conductors. To permit the use of 
smaller conductors and conduit, it was decided to par-
allel the feeders. Several rules must be followed when 
using parallel feeders (see 300.20 and 310.10(H)):
• All phase conductors, and the neutral if used, 
as well as all equipment grounding conductors 
must be grouped in each raceway;
• the conductors must be 1/0 AWG or larger;
• the conductor in one grouping must be the same 
length, the same conductor material, the same 
size, have the same type of insulation, and be ter-
minated in the same manner as the conductors in 
the other grouping(s); and
• the raceways containing the groups of conduc-
tors must have the same physical  characteristics.
Because two parallel feeders are installed to 
each of the synchronous condensers, the  conductors 
can be sized for half the value of the required ampac-
ity, or 232 amperes. The connections are illustrated 
in Figure 11-21.

 CORRECTING 
POWER FACTOR WITH 
CAPACITORS
Although this plant uses synchronous condensers 
for power factor correction, it is common practice 
in many industrial installations to use banks of 
 capacitors, as shown in Figure 11-22, to perform 
this task. A capacitor is a device that has a leading 
current and therefore a leading power factor. When 
capacitors are connected in a circuit with inductors, 
the leading VARs of the capacitors act to cancel the 
lagging VARs of the inductors. In this way, power 
factor can be corrected.
To correct the power factor of a circuit or motor, 
the existing power factor must first be determined. 
In the example shown in Figure 11-23, a 3-phase 
wattmeter, an ammeter, and a voltmeter have been

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor
connected to a 3-phase circuit. It is assumed the 
meters indicate the values shown:
 Wattmeter: 13.9 kilowatts
 Ammeter: 25 amperes
 Voltmeter: 480 volts
To calculate the power factor, it will be nec-
essary to first calculate the apparent power. In a 
3-phase circuit, the apparent power can be calcu-
lated using the formula:
 VA  13  volts  amps
  1.732  480  25
 
  20.8  kVA
Now that both the apparent power and the true 
power of the circuit are known, the power factor 
can be determined by comparing the true power and 
apparent power.
PF  W
VA  13.9
20.8  0.668  66.8%
The amount of reactive power in the circuit can 
now be calculated using the formula:
 kVAR  2kVA2  kW2
  220.82  13.92
  1432.64  193.21
  1239.43
 
  15.47  kVAR
The power factor is generally not corrected to 
100%. In this example, the power factor will be cor-
rected to 97%.
To determine the capacitive kVARs needed to 
correct the power factor to 97%, first determine 
what the apparent power would be with a 97% 
power factor.
kVA  kW
PF   13.9
0.97  14.3
 Now determine the amount of inductive VARs 
necessary to produce an apparent power to 14.3 kVA.
 kVAR  2kVA2  kW2
  214.32  13.92
  3.36
Because the circuit presently contains 15.47 induc-
tive kVARs, 12.11 capacitive kVARs (15.47 − 3.36) 
would be added to the circuit.
Another method for determining the capaci-
tance needed to correct the power factor is to use 
Table  11-1. To find the amount of capacitance

CHAPTER 11  Power Factor 
233
Determining the Amount of Capacitance Necessary 
To determine the amount of capacitance neces-
sary to correct the power factor to 95% it is first 
necessary to determine the inductive VARs in the 
circuit.
 
 VARsL  2VA2  Watts2
 
 VARsL  24,233,2162  3,000, 0002
 
 VARsL  2,986,657
At a power factor of 70.9%, the plant has 
2,986,657 inductive VARs. To determine the 
capacitance needed to correct the power factor, 
it is necessary to determine the capacitive VARs 
needed. To make this calculation, determine the 
apparent power if the plant were operating with a 
95% power factor. The true power or watts will not 
change.
 VA  True Power
PF
 VA  3,000, 000
0.95
 VA  3,145,895
Now determine the inductive VARs necessary to 
produce an apparent power of 3,145,895 volt amps.
 
 VARsL  23,145,8952  3,000,0002
 
 VARsL  946,919
To determine the capacitive VARs needed to cor-
rect the power factor, subtract the present inductive 
VARs from the needed inductive VARs.
 
 VARsC  2,986,657  946,919
 
 VARsC  2,039,738
Once the capacitive VARs have been deter-
mined, it is possible to calculate the capacitive reac-
tance necessary to produce that amount of reactive 
power in several ways. Because the capacitors form 
the phases of the wye connection, phase values of 
voltage and current, not line values, should be used 
in the calculation. Recall that 3-phase power can be 
needed, calculate the power factor in the same man-
ner described previously. The circuit in the previous 
example has a true power of 13.9 kilowatts and a 
power factor of 67%. To find the amount of capaci-

is 0.857. Multiply the true power value by the multi-

Correcting Plant Power Factor
Utility companies often require the power factor 
to be corrected at the point where power is supplied 
to an industrial plant. In this example a utility com-
pany supplies the substation of a plant with 12,470 
volts three-phase. An ammeter indicates a current 
draw of 196 amperes on the supply lines. A watt-
meter indicates a power consumption of 3,000 kW. 
Capacitors are to be installed to correct the power 
factor to 95%. The capacitors are to be connected in 
wye. Determine:
 1. The plant power factor
 2. The capacitance of the capacitors necessary to 
correct the power factor to 95%
 3. The minimum voltage rating of the capacitors
 4. The minimum kVAR rating of the capacitors

late the apparent power.

Minimum Voltage Rating Because each capacitor 
is one phase of the wye connection, the minimum 
voltage rating of a capacitor is the phase voltage of 
7200 volts.
Minimum kVAR Rating of Capacitors The mini-
mum kVAR rating of each capacitor can be deter-
mined by multiplying the capacitive current by the 
voltage applied to the capacitor and then dividing 
by 1000.

If the phase values of voltage and current are

 VA  E(Phase)  I(Phase)  3
In a wye connection, the phase current and line 
current are the same. The phase voltage, however, 
is less than the line voltage by the square root of 3. 
Therefore, the voltage across each capacitor is 7200 
volts instead of 12,470.

One method of determining the capacitive reac-
tance is to first determine the amount of current per 
phase. The amount of capacitive current necessary 
to produced 2,039,738 capacitive VARs can be 
determined using the formula:
 
VARsC
E(Phase)  3

The next step is to determine the capacitive reac-
tance of each capacitor. The capacitive reactance can 
be determined using Ohm’s law, where current is 
equal to voltage divided by resistance. In this prob-
lem, the current is limited by capacitive reactance 
instead of resistance.
The capacitive reactance can now be determined.

It should be noted that although a capacitive 
load that requires a current of 94.4 amperes has 
been added to the line, the actual current being sup-
plied by the utility company has decreased from 
196 amperes to 145.6 amperes. The apparent power 
after the power factor has been corrected to 95% 
changed from 4,233,216 volt amps to 3,145,895 
volt amps.

 CORRECTING 
MOTOR POWER 
FACTOR
It is often desirable to correct the power factor of 
a single motor. The amount of capacitance needed 
can be determined in the same manner as shown 
previously, by connecting a wattmeter, ammeter, and 
voltmeter in the circuit. Charts similar to the ones 
shown in Table 11-2 can also be used. These two 
charts list the horsepower and synchronous speed 
of both U-frame and T-frame motors. The charts 
assume a correction factor of 93% to 97%. The val-
ues shown are the kVAR of capacitance needed to 
correct the motor power factor. For motors designed 
to operate on 208 volts, the kVAR value shown 
should be increased by 1.33. For motors designed 
to operate on 50 hertz, increase the chart values by a 
factor of 1.2.
 INSTALLING 
CAPACITORS
NEC Article 460 covers the installation and protec-
tion of capacitor circuits. As stated in 460.8(A), 
conductors in capacitor circuits must be rated no less 
than 135% of the current rating of the capacitor. This 
section further states that if the capacitor is used in a 
motor circuit, the conductors connecting the capaci-
tor cannot be less than one-third the rating of the 
motor current and in no case less than 135% of the 
rated current of the capacitor.
If capacitors are to be used to correct the power 
factor of a single motor, the manner in which the 
capacitors are installed can greatly influence the 
Code requirements. For example, 460.8(B) states 
that an overcurrent device must be provided for 
each ungrounded conductor in a capacitor bank. 
The exception, however, states that a separate 
overcurrent device does not have to be provided 
if the capacitor bank is connected to the load 
side of the motor overload protective device, 
Figure 11-24. NEC 460.8(C) states that a capacitor 
must have a separate disconnecting means rated 
no less than 135% of the rated capacitor current. 
The exception, however, states that a separate dis-
connect means is not required if the capacitor is 
connected to the load side of the motor overload 
protective device, as shown in Figure 11-24. If 
the capacitor is connected ahead of the overload 
protective device, as shown in Figure 11-25, both 
a separate disconnecting means and an overcurrent 
protective device are required. Table 11-3 provides 
a list of sizes of wire, fuses, and switches for dif-
ferent kVAR capacitor ratings on different voltages 
of 3-phase systems.
 TESTING 
CAPACITORS
WARNING: Capacitors are among the most 
dangerous components in the electrical field. 
A charged capacitor has the ability to deliver 
an almost infinite amount of current. Use cau-
tion when testing or working with capacitors. 
NEVER charge a capacitor and hand it to some-
one as a joke. Capacitors can cause the heart to 
go into fibrillation under the right  conditions.
To understand how to test a capacitor, it is nec-
essary to first understand what a capacitor is. Most 
capacitors used in industry, especially for power fac-
tor correction, are called AC or nonpolarized capaci-
tors. This simply means that the capacitor is not 
sensitive to which polarity of voltage is connected 
to which plate. These capacitors are  generally 
 constructed of two metal plates separated by an

insulating material called the dielectric, as illus-
trated in Figure 11-26. To accurately test a capacitor, 
two measurements must be made. One is to measure 
the capacitance value of the capacitor to determine 
whether it is the same or approximately the same as 
the rate value. The other is to test the strength of the 
dielectric.
The first test should be made with an ohmmeter. 
With the power disconnected, connect the termi-
nals of an ohmmeter directly across the capacitor 
terminals as shown in Figure 11-27. (It is a good 
practice to discharge the capacitor, by connecting 
a resistor across the leads, before connecting to the 
 ohmmeter.)
This test determines whether the dielectric is 
shorted. When the ohmmeter is connected, the 
needle should swing up-scale and return to infinity. 
The amount of needle swing is determined by the 
capacitance of the capacitor. Then reverse the ohm-
meter connection; the needle should move twice as 
far up-scale and return to the infinity setting.
If the ohmmeter test is successful, the dielectric 
must be tested at its rated voltage. This is called a 
dielectric strength test. To make this test, a dielectric 
test set must be used. This device is often referred 
to as a HiPot because of its ability to produce a 
high voltage or high potential. The dielectric test set 
contains a variable voltage control, a voltmeter, and 
a microammeter, Figure 11-28. To use the HiPot, 
connect its terminal leads to the capacitor terminals. 
Increase the output voltage until rated voltage is 
applied to the capacitor. The microammeter indi-
cates any current flow between the plates and the 
dielectric. If the capacitor is good, the microamme-
ter should indicate zero current.
The capacitance value must be measured to 
determine whether there are any open plates in the 
capacitor. To measure the capacitance value of the 
capacitor, connect, as shown in Figure 11-29, some 
value of AC voltage across the plates of the capaci-
tor. This voltage must not be greater than the rated 
capacitor voltage. Then measure the amount of cur-
rent in the circuit. Now that the voltage and current 
are known, the capacitive reactance can be calcu-
lated using the formula:
 XC  E
I
After the capacitive reactance has been deter-
mined, the capacitance can be calculated using the 
formula:

CHAPTER 12  Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Other Facilities  
243
The plans and specifications for the industrial build-
ing indicate that there are still several other circuits 
to be installed. Although these circuits are smaller in 
scale than those covered in previous chapters, they 
are important nonetheless.
 THE VENTILATOR 
AND EXHAUST 
SYSTEMS
According to the plans and specifications, there are 
six ventilating units to be installed and connected 
for operation. Four of these units are located on the 
roof of the manufacturing area. The two remaining 
units are located on the roof of the office structure 
(see Sheet E-3 of the plans). Each ventilating unit 
consists of a steel housing designed for mounting on 
a flat surface and a blower unit enclosed in the steel 
housing.
The exhaust blower unit consists of a 3-horse power, 
3-phase, 208-volt motor driving a propeller- type fan 
through a V-belt drive, Figure  12-1. This arrange-
ment results in a quieter mode of operation than is 
obtainable using a direct drive unit. The motor and 
fan assembly are cushion mounted to absorb vibra-
tion. As a result, the unit is almost noiseless during 
operation except for the sound of the rush of air. 
The fan rotates at a speed of 905 RPM and is rated 
at 17,300 cubic feet per minute (CFM) at a static air 
pressure of 0 inches.
The two ventilating blowers located on the roof 
of the office structure are also rated at 3 horsepower, 
Figure 12-2. These blowers exhaust the air from the 
toilets and washrooms located on the first and sec-
ond floors, as well as the basement washroom and 
locker room. The fan has a speed of 913 RPM and 
should be used with a static air pressure of less than 
1 inch.
As shown on Sheet E-3, the two ventila-
tors and the four exhaust blowers are supplied 
from a special power panel, P-11. This power 
panelboard is shown in Figure 12-3. The panel-
board contains a fusible disconnect means for 
each of the motor circuits. Six-inch wireways 
are installed to the right and left from the pan-
elboard. Manual motor controllers are supplied 
from these wireways.

Maximum Overcurrent Protective 
Device
The manufacturer is required to mark the maxi-
mum overcurrent protective device on the name-
plate. This value is determined by multiplying 
the rated-load current, or the branch-circuit selec-
tion current of the hermetic refrigerant motor- 
compressor, by 225% and then adding all concurrent 
loads such as electric heaters, motors, and so on.
 THE COOLING 
EQUIPMENT
The cooling equipment for the industrial building 
consists of three liquid chillers and ten fan coil units, 
as shown on Sheet E-3 of the plans. The water- 
circulating pumps are located in the boiler room 
and are not shown in the plans. Although the actual 
installation of the cooling equipment is the responsi-
bility of another contractor, the electrician should be 
familiar with and understand the basic operation of 
the cooling system.
Each of the three liquid chillers is capable of 
cooling nearly 100 gallons of water per minute to 
a temperature of 46°F (8°C) from a return water 
temperature of 52°F (11°C). This water is circu-
lated through a piping system to the fan coil units, 
Figure 12-4, located at various points in the build-
ing. Cool air is then blown from these units into the 
immediate area. Each serves to maintain a comfort-
able air temperature.
Each fan coil unit is equipped with a 2- horsepower 
induction motor driving a squirrel-cage-type fan. 
The fan moves nearly 3000 cubic feet of air per min-
ute through a fin tube coil, Figure 12-5. The move-
ment of air through the coil removes the heat from 
the air, which is then forced through ductwork to the 
proper area to be cooled. Whenever the specific area 
is cooled to the desired temperature, a thermostat 
opens the control circuit to the motor controller and 
the air movement stops until the area again requires 
cooling. The controller for each fan coil unit is 
located adjacent to the cooling unit. Three circuits 
from panelboard P-14 are used to  supply the ten fan 
coil cooling units.
The motors of the fan coil units can be expected 
to run for continuous periods of time exceeding 
 SPECIAL 
TERMINOLOGY
Most of the following phrases are used repeatedly in 
NEC Article 440.
Maximum Continuous Current
The maximum continuous current is determined 
by the manufacturer of the hermetic refrigerant 
motor-compressor under specific test conditions. The 
maximum continuous current is needed to properly 
design the unit. The electrician need not know this 
information, and it is not placed on the nameplate.
Rated-Load Current
The rated-load current is determined by the manu-
facturer of the hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor 
by testing at rated refrigerant pressure, tempera-
ture conditions, and voltage. In most instances, the 
rated-load current is at least equal to 64.1% of 
the 
hermetic 
refrigerant 
motor-compressor’s
maximum continuous current.
Branch-Circuit Selection Current
Some hermetic refrigerant motor-compressors 
are designed to operate continuously at currents 
greater than 156% of the rated-load current. In such 
cases, the unit’s nameplate is marked with branch-
circuit selection current. The branch-circuit selec-
tion current will be at least 64.1% of the maximum 
continuous current rating of the hermetic refrigerant 
motor-compressor.
Minimum Circuit Ampacity
The manufacturer of an air-conditioning unit is 
required to mark the nameplate with the minimum 
circuit ampacity. This is important information for 
the electrician. The manufacturer determines the 
minimum circuit ampacity by multiplying the rated-
load current, or the branch-circuit selection current 
of the hermetic refrigerant motor-compressor, by 
125%. The current ratings of all other concurrent 
loads, such as fan motors, transformers, relay coils, 
and so on, are then added to this value.

CHAPTER 12  Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Other Facilities  
247
After the raceway is installed, the electrician 
usually is responsible for aligning the motor and 
adjusting the drive belts. The drive for the cooling 
unit requires three V-belts. It is recommended that 
the three belts be purchased as a set so that they all 
have the same length. The belts should be installed 
only after the motor is loosened from its base and 
moved closer to the fan sheave. The belts should 
not be pulled on over the sheaves because the 
belt fabric can be damaged. The motor should be 
placed so that the sheaves are in perfect alignment, 
Figure 12-6. The motor is then moved to tighten 
the belts.
The correct tension for a belt can be deter-
mined from the motor manufacturer’s literature. A 
measurement can be made to find the force that is 
required to deflect the belt a distance equal to 1/64 of 
the belt span, Figure 12-7. Depending upon the class 
of the belt cross section, representative values of the 
deflection are shown in Table 12-1.
3 hours. Thus, these motors are considered to be 
continuous-duty motors. Overload protection must 
be provided for the motors and is sized according to 
430.32(A)(1). In summary, this section requires
• a separate overload device for each motor;
• a device that is selected as follows:
•   For motors with a service factor of not less 
than 1.15, the device rating is 125% full load 
amps (FLA).
•   For motors with a temperature rise of not 
over 40°C, the device rating is 125% FLA.
•   For all other motors, the device rating is 
115% FLA.
For example, the protection for a 50°C motor 
having a service factor of 1 is sized to trip at a value 
not to exceed 115% of the full-load rating of the 
motor. For the fan coil cooling units, this trip value is
7.5 amperes  1.15  8.625 amperes
When the raceway is installed from the con-
troller to the motor, several sections of the NEC 
must be applied. In particular, 430.242, 430.245(A), 
250.112(C), 250.112(D), and 250.134 are relevant to 
the installation. In addition, because the motor must 
be movable to adjust the tension in the drive belt, 
NEC Article 350 will apply.
A typical installation includes a section of flexi-
ble metal conduit slightly less than 3 ft (900 mm) long, 
with an equipment grounding conductor installed in 
the raceway to ground the motor.

a reserve to ensure that adequate cooling is always 
available.
The chillers each have the equivalent of two 
12½-horsepower motors in the form of hermetic 
motor-compressors (see NEC Article 440). A her-
metic motor is an integral part of the refrigeration 
system. The refrigerant medium provides a cooling 
effect as it passes through the motor, Figure 12-9. 
The motor is labeled with the rated-load current 
and the locked-rotor current. The rated-load current 
is used to size the heater elements for the overload 
relays. According to 440.52(A)(1), these relays are 
selected to trip at not more than 140% of the rated-
load current.
37.4 amperes  1.40  52.36 amperes
When the disconnect means is selected, both 
the locked-rotor current and the rated-load current 
are considered. For example, if a hermetic compres-
sor has a rated-load current of 37.4 amperes and a 
locked-rotor current of 250 amperes, the require-
ments of 440.12 are applied as follows to determine 
 LIQUID CHILLERS
The cooling installation includes three liquid chill-
ers, Figure 12-8, which provide cooled water to the 
fan coil units. Each chiller is connected to a separate 
circuit from panelboard P-14. Any two of the three 
chillers are adequate to meet the cooling needs of 
the industrial building. As a result, one unit acts as

 3. Because a 15-horsepower disconnect means 
is the minimum acceptable by NEC Table 
430.251(B), this is the minimum required for 
installation.
The two hermetic motors on each of the chiller 
units are connected so that they cannot start at the 
same time. A timer is installed to delay the start of 
the second motor until 15 seconds after the start of 
the first motor. This delay reduces the current surge 
on the supply conductors.
 THE PRECIPITATION 
UNIT
Oil mist is present in the air of most large machine 
shops. The mist consists of tiny, almost microscopic, 
droplets of oil or coolant. High-speed machine tools 
the equivalent horsepower required for selecting the 
correct disconnect means.
 1. From Table 10-4 (NEC Table 430.250):
 
  A 208-volt, 3-phase motor with a rated-
load current of 37.4 amperes is equivalent to a 
230-volt, 3-phase motor with a rated-load cur-
rent of 42 amperes. The table shows that this 
value exceeds that given for a 10-horsepower 
motor. As a result, a disconnect means with a 
15-horsepower rating is acceptable according 
to this table.
 2. From Table 10-4 [NEC Table 430.251(B)]:
 
  A locked-rotor current of 250 amperes 
is found to be less than the value given for 
a 15-horsepower motor; thus, a disconnect 
means rated at 15 horsepower is acceptable 
according to this table.

CHAPTER 12  Ventilating, Air Conditioning, and Other Facilities 
The specifications for the industrial building call 
for individual precipitation units to be installed at 
the rear of each vertical boring mill, turret lathe, and 
cylindrical grinder. As a result, 23 precipitation units 
must be installed and connected.
Each precipitation unit occupies a floor area of 
18 in. by 30 in. (45.7 cm by 76.2 cm). The unit is 
36 in. (91.4 cm) in height and is mounted on a spe-
cially constructed stand. The unit has an air-handling 
capacity of 600 cu. ft per minute.
The basic construction of the precipitation unit 
is as follows: Mounted at or near a high-speed 
tool, it draws the contaminated air from around 
the cutting or grinding operation; removes the oil 
mist, smoke, and odor; and returns the cleaned 
air to the shop space. The salvaged coolant oil is 
returned to the machine coolant supply reservoir 
and reused.
This air-cleaning unit consists of a rugged steel 
cabinet, which is easily installed. The entire unit 
is accessible from the side. Hinged doors permit 
ready access to the unit. The cabinet contains col-
lector cells, an ionizer, a power pack, and the fan 
assembly. The air inlet is located near the bottom 
of the cabinet. This inlet is connected to the source 
of the oil mist or the hood of the machine. Flexible 
or fixed piping similar to an aluminum stovepipe 
is used to make the connection. A connecting 
flange provides a means of attachment between the 
machine and the air inlet. The air outlet is located 
at the back of the precipitation unit and is provided 
with a grill.
Basic Construction of a 
Precipitator
The main parts of a precipitator are the ion-
izer, collector cells, and power supply. The ionizer 
consists of tungsten wires that are electrically con-
nected together. The entire ionizer unit is insulated 
from the metal case. The ionizer is connected 
to one conductor of a high-voltage DC source. 
The ionizer generally is connected to the positive 
 voltage.
Collector plates are flat metal plates that are elec-
trically connected together, and the entire assembly 
is also insulated from the metal case. The collector 
plates are connected to the negative terminal of the 
such as boring mills, grinders, and turret lathes tend 
to pollute the surrounding air with an oil mist. A sin-
gle high-speed grinder can give off nearly 38 liters 
(10 gallons) of coolant oil in the form of mist in an 
8-hour period.
The oil mist in the air lowers visibility within the 
manufacturing area and leaves a coating or  residue 
on any surrounding machinery and equipment. In 
addition, the mist may be the cause of skin and 
eye irritations, as well as throat and lung ailments 
among the workers.
One method of removing this pollutant is by 
the use of precipitation units such as the one shown 
in Figure 12-10. These units are manufactured 
in sizes large enough to be used with groups of 
machines or in a small package unit that can be 
installed at the individual machine causing the oil 
mist. Precipitation units can be installed directly 
behind, above, or at the side of a machine; however, 
a site at the rear of the machine is the most common 
 location.

tungsten wires. The positively charged particles are 
then attracted to the negative collector plates. To 
clean the precipitator, the power is turned off and 
the plates are removed for cleaning. Large amounts 
of oil, however, will accumulate and flow down 
the plates, where they are returned to the machine 
 cooling tank.

CHAPTER 13  System Protection 
255
 SYSTEM 
PROTECTION
The previous chapters of this text described numer-
ous devices and methods of providing system pro-
tection. This chapter evaluates the complete power 
protective system to determine whether it complies 
fully with the recommendations of the NEC.
Ground-Fault Protection in a 
Coordinated System
The NEC specifies in 230.95 that ground-fault 
protection shall be provided on certain electrical equip-
ment. In addition, the NEC lists several other applica-
tions as follows for this type of protective device:
Required
• for 1000 ampere or larger, solidly grounded 
wye service of more than 150 volts to ground, 
but not exceeding 1000 volts phase-to-phase for 
each service disconnect rated 1000 amperes or 
more.
Exception
• Provisions of this section of the Code shall 
not apply in a continuous industrial process 
where a nonorderly shutdown will introduce or 
increase hazards.
Of equal importance to the requirement for 
ground-fault protection is the need to coordinate the 
proper selective overcurrent protection. To achieve 
coordination, the electrician must be knowledge-
able with regard to the operating characteristics 
of the various types of protective devices. Thus, 
after the proper selection of equipment is made, the 
electrician must be able to check and make adjust-
ments where necessary to achieve coordination, 
Figure 13-1.
Selective coordination means that when an 
overload or fault condition occurs, only the part of 
the electrical system that is in jeopardy is discon-
nected. For example, a fault on a branch circuit 
causes the branch-circuit protective device to open. 
At the same time, all of the other protective devices 
remain closed. Similarly, an overload on a feeder 
causes only the feeder overcurrent protective device 
to open.
The three basic types of devices involved in 
selective coordination are circuit breakers, fuses, 
and ground-fault protectors. Circuit breakers and 
fuses are installed in the ungrounded conductors 
of an electrical system to protect the system by 
monitoring the current in those conductors. These 
protective devices disconnect the conductors from 
the power source if a specified abnormal condition 
occurs, Figure 13-2.

CHAPTER 13  System Protection
A ground-fault protective device consists of a 
ground-fault sensor (current transformer) and a relay. 
All of the phase conductors and the neutral of the 
system are installed through the center of the sensor. 
As long as the current in these conductors is balanced 
(the normal condition), the relay is static. However, if 
one of the conductors makes contact with ground, the 
resulting current through the sensor is unbalanced.
If this fault has sufficient magnitude and lasts 
for a long enough period, the relay sends a signal 
to the circuit protective device, which then opens 
the circuit. The following detailed description of 
the operating characteristics of these devices is pre-
sented to help the student gain an understanding of 
their operation.
 CIRCUIT BREAKERS
Circuit breakers are categorized by the method 
employed to interrupt the circuit current (extinguish 
the arc) when the contacts open. The three major 
types of circuit breakers are air, oil, and vacuum. 
Regardless of the method employed to extinguish 
an arc, circuit breakers sense circuit current in one 
of two ways. One method of sensing circuit current 
is through the production of heat. These breakers 
are often referred to as thermal circuit breakers. 
Thermal circuit breakers generally use some type 
of heating element inserted in series with the load, 
Figure 13-3. The heater is located close to a bime-
tallic strip. The bimetallic strip is mechanically 
connected to the movable contacts of the circuit 
breaker.
When there is a current through the heater, 
it causes the bimetallic strip to bend or warp. If 
the current is higher than a predetermined limit, 
the bimetallic strip will warp far enough to cause the 
contacts to snap open.
Because the action of the circuit breaker 
depends on heating a bimetallic strip, there is some 
amount of time delay before the circuit opens. The 
amount of time delay depends on the amount of 
overcurrent. If the amount of overcurrent is small,

it may take several minutes before the circuit 
breaker opens its contacts. A large overcurrent will 
cause the contacts to open much faster. A single-
pole thermal circuit breaker is shown in Figure 
13-4. The schematic symbol generally used to 
represent a thermal-type circuit breaker is shown in 
Figure 13-5.
Magnetic Circuit Breakers
The second method of sensing circuit current is 
accomplished by connecting a coil in series with the 
load, Figure 13-6. As current flows through the cir-
cuit, a magnetic field is established around the coil. 
The magnetic field attracts the metal arm of a sole-
noid. If the magnetic field becomes intense enough, 
the metal arm mechanically opens the contacts of 
the circuit breaker. Circuit breakers that operate 
on this principle are referred to as magnetic circuit 
breakers. A 3-pole magnetic circuit breaker is shown 
in Figure 13-7.

CHAPTER 13  System Protection
The internal construction of the magnetic circuit 
breaker is shown in Figure 13-8. In Figure 13-9, one 
of the solenoids has been removed. This permits the 
series coil to be seen. The schematic symbol gener-
ally used to represent a magnetic circuit breaker is 
shown in Figure 13-10.
Because magnetic-type circuit breakers do not 
depend on heating a bimetallic strip, there is very 
little time delay in the opening of the contacts 
when an overload occurs. For this reason, they are 
often referred to as instantaneous circuit break-
ers. NEC Table 430.52 lists the maximum rating 
or setting of motor branch-circuit, short-circuit, 
and ground-fault protective devices. One of the 
protection devices listed is the instantaneous trip 
breaker.
There are some types of circuit breakers that 
employ both thermal and magnetic current sensors. 
These circuit breakers are known as thermomagnetic 
circuit breakers. The schematic symbol generally 
used to denote the use of a thermomagnetic breaker 
is shown in Figure 13-11.
Circuit-Breaker Current Ratings
Circuit breakers actually have two different 
current ratings. One is the trip rating, and the other 
is the interrupt rating. The trip current rating is 
the amount of current that should cause the circuit 
breaker to open its contacts when it is exceeded. 
Standard trip current ratings for inverse-time circuit 
breakers (thermal circuit breakers) and fuses are 
listed in 240.6. Trip current ratings range from 15 to 
6000 amperes.
The interrupt rating indicates the maximum 
amount of current a circuit breaker is intended to 
interrupt when its contacts open. The amount of cur-
rent that will flow during a short-circuit condition is 
determined by two factors:
 1. Circuit voltage
 2. Circuit impedance

CHAPTER 13  System Protection 
259
The circuit impedance is determined by factors 
such as the kVA capacity of the transformers sup-
plying power to the branch circuit, the size of wire 
used in the circuit, contact resistance of connections, 
and so on.
When a short or grounded circuit occurs, the 
 circuit breaker must be capable of interrupting the 
current. Assume, for example, that a circuit breaker 
has a trip current rating of 100 amperes. Now assume 
that a short circuit occurs and there is a current of 
15,000 amperes in the circuit. Because the circuit 
breaker has a trip current rating of 100 amperes, it 
will open its contacts almost immediately.
For the circuit breaker to stop the current, 
it must be capable of interrupting a current of 
15,000  amperes. Circuit breakers commonly have 
an interrupt rating of 5000 amperes. Because the 
interrupt rating can be very important in the event of 
a short circuit, 240.83(C) states that circuit breakers 
having an interrupt rating other than 5000 amperes 
must have the rating marked on the circuit breaker, 
Figure 13-12.
When it is necessary to replace a circuit 
breaker, always make sure of the interrupt rat-
ing. If a circuit breaker with an interrupt rating of 
5000 amperes is used to replace a breaker with an 
interrupt rating of 10,000 amperes, a short circuit 
could cause a great deal of damage to both equip-
ment and individuals.
Shunt Trips and Auxiliary 
Switches
Some circuit breakers contain a small solenoid 
coil known as a shunt trip. Shunt trips are used to 
open the circuit-breaker contacts by energizing the 
solenoid from an external source.
Assume, for example, that it is desirable to 
disconnect the power to a circuit if the temperature 
rises above a certain level. If the circuit breaker

protecting the circuit contains a shunt trip, a ther-
mostat can be connected in series with the solenoid. 
If the temperature rises above the desired level, the 
thermostat contact will close and energize the coil, 
Figure 13-13. When the coil energizes, the circuit-
breaker contacts will open and disconnect power 
to the circuit. A 3-pole circuit breaker  containing 
a shunt trip and auxiliary switch is shown in 
Figure 13-14. The shunt trip connection for the cir-
cuit breaker is shown in Figure 13-15.
Some circuit breakers contain an auxiliary switch 
as shown in Figure 13-14. The auxiliary switch is a

small micro-limit switch. Its contacts are controlled 
by the action of the circuit breaker. The auxiliary 
switch generally contains a set of normally open and 
normally closed contacts connected to a common 
terminal, as shown in Figure 13-16. The contacts are 
shown in the position they will be in when the cir-
cuit breaker is turned off, or open. When the circuit 
breaker is turned on, or closed, the auxiliary switch 
contacts will change position. The normally closed 
contact will open and the normally open contact will 
close.
Auxiliary switch contacts can be used for a 
variety of purposes. In some instances, if the circuit 
breaker should open, it may be desirable to discon-
nect power to some other control device on a dif-
ferent circuit. In another application, if the breaker 
should open, the auxiliary contacts may be used to 
illuminate an indicator light on the operator’s panel-
board. The auxiliary switch connection for a 3-pole 
circuit breaker is shown in Figure 13-17.
Air Circuit Breakers
Air circuit breakers are so named because they 
use air as the insulating medium to break the arc 
when contacts open. They can be divided into three 
basic types:
 1. Molded-case circuit breakers
 2. Low-voltage power circuit breakers
 3. Medium-voltage circuit breakers
Regardless of the type of air circuit breaker 
employed, all have one similar characteristic: They 
use air as a medium to extinguish an arc. When 
contacts separate to interrupt the current, an arc 
is produced that contains a great deal of heat. 
The farther apart the contacts become, the lon-
ger the arc becomes and the greater the cooling 
effect. Convection airflow causes the arc to rise, 
Figure 13-18.

262 
CHAPTER 13  System Protection
Molded-Case Circuit Breakers
Molded-case circuit breakers are used in low-
voltage (1000 volts or less), low-current circuits. 
They are characterized by the use of a molded case, 
which results in minimum space requirements. They 
are used to protect small motor, lighting, and appli-
ance circuits.
Circuit breakers intended for lower voltage and 
current ratings often depend on the distance between 
the contacts being sufficient to stretch the arc far 
enough to extinguish it. Circuit breakers intended 
for use on higher-voltage circuits often employ 
other devices to help extinguish an arc. One of these 
devices is the splitter. A splitter consists of metal or 
insulated plates located at the top of the contacts, 
Figure 13-19. Their function is to permit hot gases to 
escape, but lengthen the path of the arc so the cool-
ing effect is increased. The longer arc path weakens 
the arc to the point that it is eventually extinguished. 
A 2-pole molded-case circuit breaker with an arc 
splitter is shown in Figure 13-20. The arc splitter is 
shown outside the circuit breaker in Figure 13-21.
Low-Voltage Power Circuit 
Breakers
Low-voltage power circuit breakers are gen-
erally constructed with a metal case. They can 
be obtained in case sizes that range from 100 to 
6000 amperes and can have trip current ratings that 
range from 15 to 6000 amperes. Because they are 
intended to interrupt higher currents, the contact

 arrangement is generally different from that of 
molded-case  circuit breakers.
Low-voltage power circuit breakers commonly 
have two separate sets of contacts. One set is the 
main contacts and is used to connect the line and 
load together. The second set, the arcing contacts, 
is used to direct the arc away from the main con-
tacts, Figure 13-22. The arcing contacts are further 
assisted by an arc horn, which aids in drawing the 
arc away from the arcing contacts and also helps 
stretch the arc. A splitter, generally located above 
the arc horn, breaks the arc into pieces to extinguish 
it, Figure 13-23.
Medium-Voltage Air Circuit 
Breakers
Medium-voltage air circuit breakers are intended 
to operate on system voltages that range from 
600 volts to 15 kilovolts. They are constructed with 
a metal case and generally contain blow-out coils 
and a puffer, as well as a splitter and an arc horn to 
help extinguish the arc.
Blow-out coils are connected in series with the 
arcing contacts so that current flows through them 
when the main contacts open. The current through 
the coils produces a magnetic field, which attracts 
the arc and helps to move it into the splitter. The 
puffer is constructed by attaching a small piston 
to the operating lever of the breaker. The piston is 
located inside a cylinder. When the circuit breaker 
opens, the piston is forced to move through the cyl-
inder, sending a puff of air in the direction of the arc. 
This puff of air helps move the arc into the splitter.
Oil Circuit Breakers
Oil circuit breakers are often used in substations 
to interrupt voltages as high as 230 kilovolts. They 
use oil as a dielectric or insulator. The contacts are 
located under the oil. When the contacts open, the 
heat of the arc causes the surrounding oil to decom-
pose and form a gas. The gas extinguishes the arc.

264 
CHAPTER 13  System Protection
There are two basic types of oil circuit break-
ers, the full tank or dead tank type and the low oil or 
oil-poor type. The dead tank type is the oldest and is 
generally used for voltages above 13.8 kilovolts. The 
construction of a typical dead tank circuit breaker 
is shown in Figure 13-24. The dead tank circuit 
breaker receives its name from the fact that the tank 
is at ground potential and insulated from the live 
parts by the dielectric oil. The circuit breaker shown 
is a double-break type containing a set of main con-
tacts and arcing contacts. The movable parts of both 
the main and arcing contacts are controlled by an 
actuator rod, which is manually operated.
Oil-poor circuit breakers are manufactured in 
several different styles. The plain-break type relies 
on the surrounding oil and the pressure generated 
by the production of gas to control the arc when the 
contacts open, Figure 13-25. The pressure is eventu-
ally vented between the case and the movable con-
tact. Another type of low oil circuit breaker is often 
referred to as a vented type and is designed with 
vents that permit the pressure produced by the for-
mation of gas to exit the arc chamber, Figure 13-26. 
Another type of low oil circuit breaker intended for 
use on higher voltages, called the double-break type, 
employs a double-break contact arrangement, as 
shown in Figure 13-27.
Vacuum Circuit Breakers
An understanding of the operation of vacuum 
circuit breakers begins with an understanding of the 
mechanics of an electric arc occurring in air. When 
an electric arc occurs in air, gas molecules in the air 
become ionized. These ionized molecules form a 
conducting path for the flow of electrons. It is the 
ionization of gas molecules that makes the job of 
extinguishing an electric arc in air so difficult.
In the vacuum circuit breaker, the contacts are 
contained inside a sealed enclosure, Figure 13-28. 
If the air could be completely removed from the 
container, no arc could occur because there would 
be no molecules to ionize. Although it is not pos-
sible to obtain a perfect vacuum, very few air 
molecules are left in the chamber, and any arc 
produced by the opening of the contacts will be 
extremely small. This small arc is extinguished by

Time-current characteristic charts are published for

circuit breakers require only about one-half to 
three-quarters of an inch clearance between the 
contacts to control voltages over 13.8 kilovolts. A 
metallic bellows is connected to the movable con-
tact. The bellows permits movement of the contact 
while maintaining the vacuum. Vacuum circuit 
breakers are being used to replace the older oil cir-
cuit breakers because they are smaller in size and 
require very little maintenance.

Unlatching time is the point beyond which 
the opening action of the breaker is irreversible, 
Figure 13-31.
The characteristic curve of a circuit breaker is 
a band that represents the range of time or current 
through which the breaker can be expected to oper-
ate. The upper limit of the band indicates the maxi-
mum value; the lower band limit is the minimum 
value. In Figure 13-29, the curve indicates that a 
250% load (2500 amperes) can be cleared in no less 
than 23 seconds or in no more than 110 seconds.
Each protective device that is designed to open 
a circuit under fault conditions must be able to 
interrupt the maximum current that can flow in that 
circuit (110.9). The interrupt rating of a protec-
tive device indicates the maximum current that the 
device can interrupt. For currents above this value, 
an arc may be sustained across the contact gaps after 
they open. This arc continues to supply current to 
the fault and damages the protective device. Devices 
are available with interrupting capacities ranging 
from 5000 to 200,000 amperes.
 FUSE TIME-CURRENT 
CHARACTERISTIC 
CHARTS
A fuse has a highly predictable performance, which 
is usually represented on a chart by a single curve 
similar to the right hand line in Figure 13-32. A curve 
of this type is called the total clearing time-current 
characteristic curve. Another value is also significant 
in determining the selectivity of fuses. The minimum 
melting time is that value of time current at which the 
opening of the fuse becomes irreversible.
 GROUND-FAULT
PROTECTOR 
TIME-CURRENT 
CHARACTERISTIC 
CHARTS
Ground-fault protector curves indicate the reac-
tion of the device at a specific time-delay setting, 
Figure  13-33. A ground-fault sensor is always 
used in conjunction with another protective device 
that can respond to a signal. Thus, for a given 
Terms used with circuit-breaker curves are trip 
coil rating, frame size, long-time delay, long-time 
pickup, instantaneous pickup current, short-time 
delay, short-time pickup, unlatching time, and inter-
rupting rating.
The trip coil rating is also known as the breaker 
rating. That is, a 150-ampere breaker is a breaker with 
a 150-ampere trip coil. This rating is not adjustable 
in molded-case circuit breakers. However, in some 
breaker models, the physical construction is such 
that breakers of various ratings are interchangeable. 
Because of this, a breaker of a different size (rating) 
can be installed to meet specific protective needs. 
Most air-type circuit breakers are adjustable. The rat-
ing can be changed from 80% to 160% of the trip coil 
rating. An adjustment above 100% of the trip coil rat-
ing should be made only in those installations where 
motors or other surge-generating loads are factors.
The value of current at which the trip coil oper-
ates is called the long-time pickup. A 200-ampere 
trip coil adjusted to 120% has a long-time pickup of 
240 amperes.
The frame size indicates the maximum size of 
trip unit that a specific breaker can accommodate. 
Thus, a breaker with a 100-ampere frame size will 
accept a trip unit of any standard rating ranging from 
15 to 100 amperes.
The long-time delay portion of the curve 
indicates the operating characteristic of a breaker 
under overload conditions. For molded-case cir-
cuit breakers, this delay is usually controlled by 
a device sensitive to thermal changes. If a breaker 
has long-time delay adjustment, the time value 
may be set to a low value for lighting and resis-
tive loads. However, a high time-value setting 
is required for motor starting and other surge-
generating loads.
The instantaneous pickup current is the point at 
which a breaker responds to a short-circuit current 
through a magnetically actuated trip arrangement. 
This value is adjustable in many breakers.
The instantaneous opening is the time required 
for the breaker to open when no intentional delay is 
added. However, when the trip must be delayed inten-
tionally, a short-time delay is added, Figure 13-30. 
This feature is available only on more sophisticated 
breakers. Short-time pickup is that value of current 
at which short-time delay is initiated.

rating be made. Figure 13-34 shows the character-
istic curves of two circuit breakers, a 1600-ampere 
main and an 800-ampere feeder. The cross-hatching 
in the figure indicates areas in which the breakers do 
not coordinate. For this situation, if a 5000-ampere 
overload continues for 20 seconds, there is a high 
probability that both breakers will open. Thus, 
instead of protecting a feeder circuit, the open 
breakers will cause an entire building to be without 
power. The same end result will occur for a short cir-
cuit of more than 18,000 amperes. This problem can 
 ground-fault current, the time required for the clear-
ance of its circuit is the sum of the time delay of the 
ground-fault sensor and the time required for the 
associated protective device to open.
 COORDINATION
Each of the three types of protective devices 
described previously has distinct operating charac-
teristics. The addition of these devices to a coordi-
nated system requires that the proper selection of the

be minimized by the proper selection, adjustment, 
and maintenance of the protective devices. However, 
it must be noted that circuit breakers in general are 
difficult to coordinate. In particular, molded-case 
circuit breakers are almost impossible to coordinate, 
except at low overload current values.
All circuit breakers in a system, except the 
branch-circuit breakers, must have a short-time 
delay feature if coordination is to be achieved. The 
insertion of a delay in the magnetic tripping of the 
feeder and main devices makes it possible to achieve 
coordination, as indicated in Figure 13-35. There is 
a problem with this method of obtaining coordina-
tion: A condition is established where a fault may 
not be opened for several cycles. This increases the 
possibility of damage that may occur as a result of 
the faulting condition.
Coordination can be accomplished easily, as 
shown in Figure 13-36, by using fuses alone or in 
combination with circuit breakers. The 800-ampere 
fuse coordinates with the 1600-ampere circuit 
breaker, and coordination is achieved—with one 
possible exception. The unlatching time of the 
breaker may, under certain conditions, exceed the 
speed of the fuse, in which case coordination will 
not be obtained.
A system containing only fuses is the easiest 
situation to coordinate. When the fuses are selected 
according to the manufacturer’s recommendation, 
complete coordination can be achieved. That is, 
fuses are used with a certain ratio to the upstream 
protective device. For example, a 1600-ampere 
current-limiting fuse used for a main will coordinate 
on a 2:1 basis with another current-limiting fuse or 
on a 4:1 basis with a time-delay fuse (such as the 
type used with motors). If ground-fault protection is 
required after the overcurrent protective devices are 
coordinated, it should be added to the system with-
out disrupting the coordination.
If more than one ground-fault protector is 
installed, a double problem is posed: Both protectors 
should coordinate with the overcurrent system and 
with one another, Figure 13-37.
Coordination with overcurrent protective 
devices can be achieved by selecting and adjust-
ing the ground-fault protector so that its char-
acteristic curve is above the total clearing curve 
of the next downstream overcurrent protective

device. Coordination with other ground-fault pro-
tectors is achieved by using a lower trip setting 
and progressively shorter time settings on each of 
the downstream devices, or by making interlock 
 connections between the devices so that the device 
that first senses a fault locks the upstream device in 
until the time setting of the downstream device is 
exceeded.

In summary, to coordinate a system, proper 
selection of the protective devices must be accom-
panied by the correct sizing of the various com-
ponents followed by careful adjustment of these 
devices. In addition, the proper maintenance of the 
devices after they are placed in operation will help 
to ensure that coordination, once achieved, will be 
maintained.

 collected electrons that have been dislodged from 
the atoms at Point A. If 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 
(6.25 × 1018) electrons are transferred from Point A 
to Point B, the quantity of charge is referred to as a 
coulomb.
For a moment, digress from the hypothetical 
situation and turn your attention to the basic nature 
of charges. It is a fundamental law that charged bod-
ies of unlike charges attract each other, and charged 
bodies of like charges repel each other. The force of 
attraction or repulsion between charges is directly 
proportional to the square of the distance between 
these charges. This brings us to another definition 
of the coulomb. A coulomb (C) is that quantity of 
charge that, when placed 1 meter (m) from a like 
charge, repels it with a force of 9,000,000,000 
(9 × 109) newtons (N). It follows that it takes work 
(force × distance) to collect charges at a point, 
for, as 1 coulomb of charge is formed, a force of 
9,000,000,000 (9 × 109) newtons must be exerted 
over a distance of 1 meter. The work done (energy 
released) by a force of 1 newton, acting over a dis-
tance of 1 meter, is expressed as 1 joule (J).
Going back to Points A and B, it should now be 
apparent that, as electrons are forced from Point A 
to Point B, work is done and an energy differential 
is established. In electrical studies, this is called 
a potential difference, which is measured in volts 
(V). A volt is that potential energy a charge gains 
when 1 joule of work is done on 1 coulomb of 
charge.
The Ionosphere
We now expand on the hypothetical example by 
giving locations to Points A and B. Because the sub-
ject is lightning, it is reasonable to locate Point B on 
Earth and Point A in a region called the ionosphere. 
The ionosphere is located at altitudes of 40 miles or 
so above the earth, where the atmosphere contains 
more ions than neutral atoms, Figure 14-1.
The earth has a surplus of electrons and is 
about 300,000 (3 × 105) volts negative with 
respect to the ionosphere. This means that a per-
son of average height, while standing, is covered 
from foot to head by a potential gradient of about 
260 volts, Figure  14-2. The typical reaction to 
Lightning is simultaneously a fascinating, awesome, 
and mysterious phenomenon. It is beautiful to wit-
ness but destructive and fatal to experience. Yet, it is 
a natural, necessary occurrence. Lightning is elec-
tricity on exhibit; and as with the electrical power in 
our homes, businesses, and factories, specific pre-
cautions are to be taken or we must expect to suffer 
the consequences.
To understand the intricacies of lightning protec-
tion, it is necessary to also understand, or at least 
accept, the rudiments of atomic structure and what 
occurs within that structure. For that reason, this 
study of lightning protection begins with a brief 
 presentation of the theory of atomic structure.
 ATOMIC STRUCTURE
All matter is made up of atoms. For example, a single 
drop of water contains about 100 billion atoms. Each 
atom has at its center a nucleus that is composed of 
protons and neutrons. The nucleus is considered to 
have a positive charge equal to the number of protons. 
Under normal conditions, the nucleus is surrounded 
by a number of electrons, each having a negative 
charge, equal to the number of protons in the nucleus.
The exact numbers of protons or electrons, 
under normal conditions, are different for each 
 element and are stated as the atomic number of 
that element. Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, 
 copper 29, lead 82, and so on.
If a force is exerted on an atom to the extent that 
an electron is dislodged or added, the atom is said 
to become an ion. The atom that loses an electron 
has a net positive charge and thus is called a positive 
ion; the atom that gains an electron is a negative ion. 
This phenomenon of being able to remove electrons 
from atoms, or ionizing them, makes it possible to 
store electrical power and to transfer that power 
from place to place.
Electrons at Work
For the purpose of further explanation, assume 
a hypothetical situation in which a large number 
of positive ions are collected at Point A. At another 
point (call it Point B) located in space are the

CHAPTER 14  Lightning Protection
this statement is “Why doesn’t the person feel 
a shock?” Electrical shock is measured in terms 
of current, and the current in this case is infini-
tesimal. (The air–Earth current is calculated to 
be between 1400 amperes and 1800 amperes or 
about 0.000,009 [10−6] ampere per square mile.) 
But the total current from Earth is sufficient to 
upset nature’s balance, and lightning is thought 
to be a natural way of restoring the balance. It is 
estimated that, on the average, the earth is struck 
by lightning 100 times per second, and in about 
90% of these events, electrons flow to the earth. 
However, there is not full agreement on how this 
comes about.
 HOW LIGHTNING IS 
GENERATED
Lightning is generated by the ominous-looking 
cumulonimbus cloud, or thundercloud. Here the 
action is so violent that charges may be formed on 
the lower portion of the cloud. Most of these charges 
are negative with respect to the upper portion of the 
cloud and to the earth below the cloud, Figure 14-3. 
Now, we essentially have a Point B at a high negative 
charge and several Points A at high positive charges. 
What happens depends upon how high the potential 
differences become and the impedance between the 
points. There may be lightning strokes from cloud

CHAPTER 14  Lightning Protection
to cloud, from points of high potential difference 
within a cloud, or between the thundercloud and the 
earth. We, of course, are primarily interested in the 
cloud-to-Earth strokes.
These strokes are most likely to occur at a high 
point—that is, where a tree, a tall building, or some 
other extension of the earth rises upward, thereby 
reducing the distance and, thus, the impedance 
between the charge on Earth and the cloud charge.
Lightning Strokes
According to the National Center for Health 
Statistics, each year lightning in the United States 
alone kills about 150 people, injures another 250, 
and causes damage in excess of $250 million. These 
disasters are all caused by the enormous energy 
transfer that takes place during a cloud-to-Earth 
strike. The current may rise to as high as 200,000 
(2 × 105) amperes, and the potential difference may 
be as much as 100 million volts. Yet, the stroke lasts 
only a fraction of a second. Our goal in lightning 
protection is to provide a low-impedance path from 
the high point, where the stroke makes contact with 
the earth, so that the current may be dissipated over 
a large area.
 MASTER LABEL
The installation of lightning protection systems for 
buildings, trees, and other structures in the open 
should be guided by the requirements of Master 
Label Service, which is endorsed by UL, and/or by 
the Lightning Protection Institute Installation Code. 
The systems advocated by these organizations are 
based upon the basic principle of providing a low-
impedance path for the stroke to follow to Earth, 
while minimizing the possibility of damage, fire, 
and personal injury or death as the stroke follows 
that path.
 BUILDING 
PROTECTION
Lightning protection systems have three basic com-
ponents: air terminals, lightning conductors, and 
grounding connections.
Air Terminal (Lightning Rod)
The air terminal, or lightning rod, is the highest 
element of a lightning protection system. It is a solid 
or tubular rod made of copper, bronze, or aluminum. 
Usually sharp pointed, it is available with a safety 
tip, as shown in Figure 14-4. These are installed 
where they will not create a hazard to personnel, 
such as on a flat roof.
The terminal attracts lightning but does not pre-
vent lightning, as originally supposed by Benjamin 
Franklin. The lightning stroke is attracted to the ter-
minal because it is a part of the path that offers the 
least impedance to ground. In general, air terminals 
should
• extend above the object to be protected, not 
less than 10 in. (250 mm) or more than 36 in. 
(900 mm);
• be placed on ridges of gable, gambrel, and hip 
roofs;
• be placed on the perimeter of flat roofs at inter-
vals not exceeding 20 ft (6 m) and within 2 ft 
(600 mm) of the edge;
• be placed in the center of a roof area at intervals 
not exceeding 50 ft (15 m);
• be placed on dormers and chimneys except 
when these projections are protected by other 
terminals.

because humans are also vulnerable to lightning, 
we should be aware of various safety rules that will 
help us avoid the shocking experience of a lightning 
stroke. The United States Department of Commerce, 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
has compiled the following safety rules for human 
protection when lightning threatens:
• Stay indoors and do not venture outside unless 
absolutely necessary.
• Stay away from open doors and windows, fire-
places, radiators, stoves, metal pipes, sinks, and 
plug-in electrical appliances.
• Do not use plug-in electrical equipment such 
as hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, or electric 
razors during the storm.
• Do not use the telephone during the storm—
lightning may strike telephone lines outside.
• Do not take laundry off the clothesline.
• Do not work on fences, telephone or power 
lines, pipelines, or structural steel fabrication.
• Do not use metal objects such as fishing rods 
and golf clubs. Golfers wearing cleated shoes 
are particularly good lightning rods.
• Do not handle flammable materials in open 
containers.
• Stop tractor work and dismount, especially when 
the tractor is pulling metal equipment. Tractors 
and other implements in metallic contact with 
the ground are often struck by lightning.
• Get out of the water and off small boats.
• Stay in your automobile if you are driving. 
Automobiles offer lightning protection.
• Seek shelter in a building. If a building is 
unavailable, seek protection in a cave, a ditch, 
a canyon, or under head-high clumps of trees in 
open forest glades.
• When there is no shelter, avoid the highest 
object in the area. If only isolated trees are 
nearby, the best protection is to crouch in the 
open, keeping twice as far away from isolated 
trees as the trees are high.
• Avoid hilltops, open spaces, wire fences, metal 
clotheslines, exposed sheds, and any electri-
cally conductive elevated objects.
Lightning Conductors
Lightning conductors are installed to connect 
and interconnect to the earth, the air terminals, and 
other metal parts of the object to be protected. They 
are made of copper or aluminum. In general, light-
ning conductors should
• not be bent to a radius of less than 8 inches;
• not be bent to an angle of more than 90°;
• have a cross-sectional area of not less than 
59,000 circular mils for copper or 98,500 circu-
lar mils for aluminum;
• maintain a horizontal or downward course;
• provide at least two paths for current flow from 
an air terminal to Earth;
• provide a ground path for every 100 ft (30 m) 
of perimeter;
• connect all metal bodies, such as exhaust fans 
and roof vents, to the protection system;
• be securely fastened to the air terminals, the 
grounds, and the structure; and
• not be concealed in metal conduit unless the 
conductor is securely bonded to the conduit at 
both ends.
Grounding Connections
The grounds are usually copper-clad steel rods at 
least 10 feet long and ½ inch in diameter. However, 
where the topsoil is very shallow, groundplates may 
be used. In general, grounding connections should be
• made with rods driven into the earth, at least 
2 ft (600 mm) from the protected object so that 
the rod top is 1 ft (300 mm) under grade;
• made to underground metal water pipes or well 
casings; and
• interconnected with driven ground electrodes 
for the electric or telephone system.
 SAFETY RULES
Following the specific requirements of the organi-
zations referred to previously will result in a struc-
ture that is free from the hazards of lightning. But

spontaneously, although burns and other injuries 
may require treatment. Recovery from lightning 
strokes is usually complete, except for possible 
impairment or loss of sight or hearing.
If you are ever present when a person is struck 
by lightning, immediately begin cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation (CPR). If you do not know how to 
apply this basic life-support technique, contact 
your American Heart Association for instruction. 
Encourage your friends to learn too, for if lightning 
ever strikes you, it may save your life to have friends 
who are able to come to your aid.
• Should you feel the electrical charge—if your 
hair stands on end or your skin tingles—light-
ning may be about to strike you. Drop to the 
ground immediately.
Persons struck by lightning suffer a severe 
electrical shock and may be burned, but they carry 
no electrical charge and can be handled safely. A 
person thought to be killed by lightning can often 
be revived by prompt CPR, cardiac massage, and 
prolonged artificial respiration. In a group struck by 
lightning, the apparently dead should be treated first. 
Those who show vital signs will probably recover

intensity discharge (HID). It is recommended that 
the person selecting or installing the light source 
have at hand a lamp specification and application 
guide (this is available from most electrical distri-
bution centers or can be requested from any of the 
major lamp manufacturers), for there are hundreds 
of lamp types available, all with different charac-
teristics. Following are abbreviated descriptions of 
several types of lamps.
Incandescent There are two styles of incandes-
cent lamps. The first to be discussed is the filament, 
or Edison, type, and the second is the tungsten 
halogen lamp. The Edison-type lamp uses a wire 
filament enclosed in a glass bulb to produce the 
light. The bulb may be vacuumed or filled with an 
inert gas. The filament is a coil of wire that emits 
light when heated. The light output varies from 100 
to 10,000 lumens, and the lamp wattage varies from 
3 to 1500 watts. Both the light output and the lamp 
life are sensitive to the voltage applied. A small 
increase in voltage above the rated value will result 
in a higher intensity of light and a much shorter 
lamp life. In practice, where lamp life is an impor-
tant factor, lamps rated for 130 volts are installed on 
120 volt systems, which will almost double the lamp 
life. The halogen-type lamp uses a tightly wound 
tungsten filament coil in a small quartz tube. The 
light is produced at a higher temperature; thus, it has 
superior color-rendering properties when compared 
with the Edison lamps. The lamp is costly, but life 
is longer than, sometimes double, that of the Edison 
lamp. The luminaires are smaller and could provide 
superior control of the light distribution.
Fluorescent The fluorescent is a tubular type of 
lamp with a filament at both ends of the tube. The 
tube size and length vary greatly, from a few inches 
(millimeters) to 8 ft (2.5 m) in length and from 5/8 to 
12/8 in. (15.87 to 38 mm) in diameter. Light output 
varies from slightly over 400 lumens to near 6000 
lumens. The light is produced by electrons bom-
barding phosphors; thus, the color rendition prop-
erties of the light can be varied by the selection of 
phosphors. Fluorescent lamps have a long life and a 
fair tolerance for voltage swings. Their application 
in site lighting has been limited because the lamp 
light output drops with the ambient temperature, 
and because of the length, the luminaires must be 
 LAMP SELECTION
In choosing an appropriate lamp for site lighting, 
at least three factors should be considered: (1) the 
amount of power the lamp requires to provide the 
needed light, (2) the color the lamp creates, and (3) 
the maintenance requirements of the lamp.
At first thought, the study of site lighting could 
be perceived as a limited subject. However, a few 
experiences will reveal there is an array of options 
that can be applied in the lighting of a large area site. 
To examine these options, it is useful to divide the 
system into three parts: power control, light sources, 
and light distribution.
Power Control
A toggle switch may be adequate if the load is 
small and the control requirements are minimal. 
As the load increases, it is common to install a 
contactor that will, on signal, turn on or off a large 
number of light sources. A contactor is similar to a 
motor starter in that completing the control circuit 
will energize a coil that closes a set of contacts. The 
circuit controlled may connect directly to the light 
sources, or it may energize a panelboard where many 
circuits are connected to an array of light sources. 
The operation of the system may be manual, such as 
the toggle switch, or it may be fully automated. The 
advantage to using a toggle switch is initial cost; the 
disadvantage is that a person must perform the oper-
ation, which can be costly and likely unreliable. The 
automated system has a high initial cost but only a 
minimal maintenance cost, plus it is reliable. For site 
lighting, it would need to be sensitive to the day and 
night cycle. The simplest option is an astronomical 
time clock. These clocks are set for the time and the 
date; then they automatically adjust the on period for 
the seasonal changes in nighttime hours. A control 
device with greater reliability is a photocell that can 
be adjusted to a precise intensity of light for on and 
off control. On a cloudy day, it would probably ener-
gize the lighting earlier than the time clock.
Light Sources
The light sources (lamps) can be placed in three 
categories: incandescent, fluorescent, and high-

CHAPTER 15  Site Lighting
strongly supported if there is the possibility of high-
velocity winds.
HID There are four styles of HID lamps: mercury, 
metal halide, high-pressure sodium, and low- pressure 
sodium. The vast majority of these lamps have a 
single screw-type base. The mercury lamp is the old-
est style but is now in diminished use. It is usually 
available with power ratings of 100 to 1000 watts, 
with a light output of 2850 to 63,000 lumens. Light 
depreciation over the lamp’s life is high and the color 
rendition poor. The metal halide lamp is available in 
power ratings from 39 to 1000 watts, with the light 
output varying from 2300 to 125,000 lumens and 
lamp life from 10,000 to 24,000 hours. The lamps 
vary in length from 4 to 15 in. (100 to 375 mm). They 
are usually preferred over the mercury lamp.
The high-pressure sodium lamp is available with 
power ratings from 35 to 1000 watts, with the light 
output varying from 1250 to 140,000 lumens. Lamp 
life varies from 10,000 to 24,000 hours. Color rendi-
tion is poor, but color discrimination is possible.
The low-pressure sodium lamp has a power rat-
ing that varies from 18 to 180 watts and light output 
from 1800 to 33,000 lumens. Lamp life ranges from 
14,000 to 18,000 hours. The light output and the 
life are excellent, but color discrimination is void, 
everything appearing the same color: yellow. People 
parking in the lot would not be able to identify their 
automobiles by color.
Table 15-1 provides a comparison of lamps 
that might be selected for illuminating the site at 
the industrial building. The operational data for the 
listed lamps is provided in columns two through 
six. In the last column, a comparison is made by 
choosing a quantity of light to be produced, then 
calculating the number of lamps and the electrical 
power required. As can be seen in the table, the low-
pressure sodium is the least expensive to operate. 
This does not indicate that it is the lamp of choice. 
When all other factors such as color discrimination, 
lamp life, and number of poles required are consid-
ered, the metal halide is a strong contender.
Light Distribution
The distribution of the light after it has been 
created in the lamp is affected by three factors: the 
lamp, reflectors, and lens. Many halogen and all the 
fluorescent lamps are tubular in shape, thus emitting 
light in 360° the entire length of the tube. In most 
cases, a reflector is installed to redirect 50% or more 
of the light. When light is reflected by a surface, 
there is absorption dependent on the reflectivity of 
the surface. When selecting a reflector, keep in mind 
that white has the highest reflectivity. This surface 
should be cleaned before installation and every time 
the lamps are replaced. Although the distribution 
from the other types of lamps is more directed, most 
likely there will be a reflector to redirect the light in

CHAPTER 15  Site Lighting

automobiles take on an entirely different look at night-
time when the parking lot lighting is turned on.
When it is important that good color discrimi-
nation be possible, then lamps must be selected to 
make this possible. If exact color discrimination is 
required, the objects to be seen should be viewed 
under the lamps before the lamps are selected for 
installation. However, for general usage, the listing 
in Table 15-2 can be used as a guide.
A comparison of the characteristics in Table 15-2, 
along with the performance information in Table 
15-1, would indicate the low-pressure sodium lamp to 
be the best lamp if color discrimination is unimport-
ant. The low-pressure sodium lamp would be accept-
able for the majority of exterior uses, and the others 
would be used in cases where color is more important.
Lamp Maintenance
The maintenance of any lighting system is 
strongly sensitive to how often the lamp can be 
expected to fail and how difficult it is to replace. 
Looking back at Table 15-1, it can be noticed that 
the incandescent lamp has, by far, the shortest life 
expectancy, followed by the fluorescent and the 
a specific pattern. Lenses are made of clear glass or 
plastic and are designed to redirect the light. They 
should be cleaned regularly and replaced if they 
begin to yellow as is the tendency of some plastics. 
With most luminaires, charts are available to detail 
the light distribution. These should be studied to 
determine whether the luminaire has the proper dis-
tribution pattern for the application. For example, 
a luminaire designed for illuminating book shelves 
would be a poor choice for an assembly room.
Lamp Efficacy
To be fair in comparing the power requirement 
of lamps, it is assumed that the light output of the 
lamps is the same. Because this is rarely the case, 
a technique has been developed that compares 
the light output of a lamp (lumen) with the power 
requirement (watt). By dividing the lumen rating of 
a lamp by the watts rating, a value called the efficacy 
of the lamp is determined. A high efficacy means 
that the lamp produces a great amount of light for 
each watt of power. When evaluating lamps that use 
ballasts, the watts rating of the ballast should also be 
included.
Typical lamp types and their efficacies (lumens 
per watt) are shown in Table 15-1. A review of 
Table  15-1 would indicate that the low-pressure 
sodium lamp is preferred, when power only is con-
sidered; the high-pressure sodium lamp is second; 
and the metal-halide lamp and the high-output 
fluorescent lamp are tied for third. The incandescent 
lamp and the mercury lamp are so poor for this pur-
pose that their use would be difficult to justify.
Lamp Color Characteristics
The colors that a person perceives when view-
ing a building and its surrounding area can be very 
important. The image of the structure, the automo-
biles in the parking lot, the materials in the storage 
yard, and the people entering the building will all 
have a different appearance when illuminated by 
light with different color content.
The perceived color of any of these objects is 
affected by the color of the object itself and the color 
of the light used to illuminate the object. A common 
example of this is often observed in parking lots where

CHAPTER 15  Site Lighting
 POWER LIMITATION
Since the oil embargo of the early 1970s, many 
states have legislated measures that restrict the 
power that can be dedicated to lighting exterior (and 
interior) areas. Several procedures are common, 
but the one adopted by the majority of the states is 
“ASHRAE/IES Standard 90, Energy Conservation 
in New Building Construction.”
For the areas on the industrial building site, the 
power allowances are shown in Table 15-4. The pro-
cedure dictates that the power values determined for 
each of the areas be totaled and only the total value 
be considered the power limit.
For the industrial building site, the power limits 
are shown in Table 15-5. The actual connected load 
is shown in Table 15-6. Because the total connected 
load is not significantly greater than the power limit, 
this installation complies with the typical energy 
code.
metal halide; all the others have a life expectancy 
of more than 18,000 hours (over a 4-year period at 
50% burning time). It should also be noted that the 
fluorescent lamp is 4 ft (1.2 m) in length, which 
makes it most difficult to handle on pole installa-
tions.
Again, the high-pressure sodium lamp and the 
low-pressure sodium lamp are given the highest 
rating. For the industrial building, the need to iden-
tify automobiles in the parking lot and materials in 
the storage area was justification to use the high- 
pressure sodium lamp as the light source for all the 
site areas.
 ILLUMINANCE 
SELECTIONS
The amount of light, or illuminance, needed for 
exterior areas is dependent upon the type of activ-
ity that is to take place in a specific area. The 
Illuminating Engineering Society of North America 
(IES) has published recommendations for various 
activity areas. Unless otherwise specified, the illu-
minance value given is the footcandle, which can be 
measured on the horizontal surface of the area, on 
the pavement in a parking lot or roadway, or on the 
sidewalk where people walk.
For the areas on the industrial building site, 
the recommended illuminances are as shown in 
Table 15-3.
Note that the storage area is recommended to 
have a considerably higher lighting level than the 
other areas. This is because it is considered a work 
area, as compared with the other areas where only 
walking or driving takes place.

 high-pressure sodium lamp in each luminaire, and 
that the luminaires are mounted 30 ft (9 m) above 
the surface being illuminated.
Parking Lighting
In practice, this curve is combined with other 
similar and dissimilar curves to form a pattern such 
as that shown in Figure 15-2. This is the layout for 
the industrial building parking lot, showing three of 
the twin luminaires on the median and a single lumi-
naire installed next to the street. The values assigned 
to the curves are additive; thus, this layout indicates 
that there will be a little more than 2.2 footcandles 
where the light patterns overlap. Because the rec-
ommendation was for 2 footcandles, this value is 
acceptable. This same technique was used to locate 
the remaining luminaires.
Pedestrian Lighting
The lighting of the sidewalks and the entryway 
was placed so that it is close to the walk surface. 
The luminaires are located using the same tech-
nique described earlier but are designed into the 
landscaping to be as unnoticeable as possible. The 
outer sidewalk, shown in Figure 15-3, is designed 
for use with a 50-watt high-pressure sodium lamp 
at a 36 in. (900 mm) mounting height. The center 
entry walk, shown in Figure 15-4, is designed with 
 LUMINAIRE 
PLACEMENT
The location and selection of luminaires, as well as 
the sizing of the lamp, are facilitated by drawings 
similar to that shown in Figure 15-1. This type of 
drawing, which is provided by the luminaire manu-
facturers, is called iso-illuminance curves or, in this 
specific instance, isofootcandle curves. Each curve 
represents a line, if drawn on the horizontal surface 
being illuminated, where the illuminance is at the 
designated value. In Figure 15-1, the egg-shaped 
curve next to the center symbol shows that 5.6 
footcandles are present along that line. The center 
symbol designates that this is for a twin luminaire. 
The labeling also indicates that it is for a 250-watt,

CHAPTER 15  Site Lighting
in  addition, raceways were installed wherever the 
conductors had to run under sidewalk.
Two very important considerations dictated the 
selection of conductor size and the circuit arrange-
ment. First, the conductors were sized to ensure 
a low voltage drop. This is particularly important 
because of the long distances that the conductors 
must run. The second important consideration was 
to be able to have selective control of the lighting in 
the various activity areas.
Lighting Control
Because of the high energy cost, the use of 
advanced electric lighting control for site lighting is 
cost-effective in many instances.
Photocell control is essentially a must for all 
site lighting. It can be installed on individual light-
ing units or at master control points. The photocell 
is used to ensure that the site lighting is turned off 
 during the daylight hours.
Time clocks are often used in conjunction with 
photocells to deactivate the lighting when there is 
no longer a use for it. The industrial building uses 
a photocell to activate the pedestrian lighting at 
twilight, then a time clock is used to deactivate that 
lighting after the last worker has left.
Dimmers for site lighting are rapidly gaining in 
popularity. Dimming has the advantage, over other 
control systems, of being able to lower the lighting 
and the energy use while maintaining uniform light-
ing throughout the area. Energy use can be reduced 
by 20%, or more, of the original value. A dimming 
system is to be installed on the storage area and the 
parking lot. A photocell will signal when to turn the 
lights on; then, a time clock will initiate the dim-
mers when the high level of lighting is no longer 
needed. Override switches will be located in conve-
nient places if there is a need to have full lighting at 
any time.

CHAPTER 16  Programmable Logic Controllers
PLCs were first used by the automotive industry in 
the late 1960s. Each time a change was made in the 
design of an automobile, it was necessary to change 
the control system operating the machinery. This 
consisted of physically rewiring the control system 
to make it perform the new operation. Rewiring the 
system was, of course, very time-consuming and 
expensive. What the industry needed was a control 
system that could be changed without the extensive 
rewiring required to change relay control systems.
 DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN 
PROGRAMMABLE 
LOGIC CONTROLLERS 
AND PERSONAL 
COMPUTERS
One of the first questions generally asked is “Is a 
PLC a computer?” The answer to that question is 
yes. The PLC is a special type of computer designed 
to perform a special function. Although the PLC 
and the personal computer (PC) are both computers, 
there are some significant differences. Both gener-
ally employ the same basic type of computer and 
memory chips to perform the tasks for which they 
are intended, but the PLC must operate in an indus-
trial environment. Any computer that is intended for 
industrial use must be able to withstand extremes of 
temperature, ignore voltage spikes and drops on the 
power line, withstand shock and vibration, and sur-
vive in an atmosphere that often contains corrosive 
vapors, oil, and dirt.
PLCs are designed to be programmed with sche-
matic or ladder diagrams instead of common com-
puter languages. An electrician who is familiar with 
ladder logic diagrams can generally learn to pro-
gram a PLC in a few hours, as opposed to the time 
required to train a person how to write programs for 
a standard computer.
 BASIC 
COMPONENTS
PLCs can be divided into four primary parts:
 1. The power supply
 2. The CPU
 3. The programming terminal or program loader
 4. The I/O (pronounced “eye-oh”) rack
The Power Supply
The function of the power supply is to lower the 
incoming AC voltage to the desired level, rectify it to 
DC, and then filter and regulate it. The internal logic of 
a PLC generally operates on 5 to 24 volts DC, depend-
ing on the type of controller. This voltage must be free 
of voltage spikes and other electrical noise and be regu-
lated to within 5% of the required voltage value. Some 
manufacturers of PLCs build a separate power supply, 
and others build the power supply into the CPU.
The CPU
The CPU is the “brains” of the PLC. It con-
tains the microprocessor chip and related integrated 
circuits to perform all of the logic functions. The 
microprocessor chip used in most PLCs is the same 
as that found in most home and business PCs.
The CPU, Figure 16-1, often has a key located on 
the front panel. This switch must be turned on before 
the CPU can be programmed. This is done to prevent 
the circuit from being changed accidentally. Plug 
connections on the CPU provide connection for the 
programming terminal and I/O racks, Figure  16-2. 
CPUs are designed so that once a program has been 
developed and tested, it can be stored on some type 
of medium such as tape, disk, CD, or other stor-
age device. As a result, if a CPU fails and has to be 
replaced, the program can be downloaded from the 
storage medium. This eliminates the time-consuming 
process of having to reprogram the unit by hand.
The Programming Terminal
The programming terminal or loading terminal 
is used to program the CPU. The type of terminal 
used depends on the manufacturer and often on 
the preference of the consumer. Some are small, 
handheld devices that use a liquid crystal display or 
LEDs to show the program, Figure 16-3. Some of 
these small units display one line of the program at a 
time, and others require the program to be entered in 
a language called Boolean.
Another type of programming terminal contains 
a display and keyboard, Figure 16-4. This type

examined while it is in operation. Figure 16-6 illus-
trates a circuit typical of those seen on the  display. 
Notice that this schematic diagram is different from 
the typical ladder diagram. All of the line com-
ponents are shown as normally open or normally 
closed contacts. There are no NEMA symbols for 
push-button, float switch, limit switches, and so on. 
The PLC recognizes only open or closed contacts. 
It does not know whether a contact is connected to 
a push button, a limit switch, or a float switch. Each 
contact, however, does have a number. The number 
is used to distinguish one contact from another.
In this example, coil symbols look like a set of 
parentheses instead of a circle as shown on most lad-
der diagrams. Each line ends with a coil, and each 
coil has a number. When a contact symbol has the 
same number as a coil, it means that the contact is 
controlled by that coil. The schematic in Figure 16-6 
shows a coil numbered 257 and two contacts num-
bered 257. When coil 257 is energized, the PLC 
interprets both contacts 257 to be closed.
A characteristic of interpreting a diagram when 
viewed on the screen of most loading terminals is that 
when a current path exists through a contact, or if a coil 
is energized, that coil or contact will be highlighted on 
the display. In the example shown in Figure 16-6 for 
coil 257, contact 16 and contact 18 are drawn with 
dark heavy lines, illustrating that they are highlighted 
or illuminated on the display. Highlighting a contact 
does not mean that it has changed from its original 
state. It means that there is a complete circuit through 
that contact. Contact 16  is highlighted, indicating 
that coil 16 has  energized and contact 16 is closed,  
of terminal generally displays several lines of the 
 program at a time and can be used to observe the 
operation of the circuit as it is operating.
Many industries prefer to use a notebook or 
laptop computer for programming, Figure 16-5. An 
interface that permits the computer to be connected 
to the input of the PLC and software program is gen-
erally available from the manufacturer of the PLC.
The terminal is used not only to program the 
PLC but also to troubleshoot the circuit. When the 
terminal is connected to the CPU, the circuit can be

carry information from control sensor devices to 
the CPU and output modules that carry instruc-
tions from the CPU to output devices in the 
field. I/O racks are shown in Figure 16-8A and 
Figure 16-8B. Input and output modules contain 
more than one input or output. Any number from 
four to sixteen is common, depending on the 
manufacturer and model of PLC. The modules 
shown in Figure 16-8A each can handle sixteen 
connections. This means that each input module 
can handle sixteen different input devices such as 
push buttons, limit switches, proximity switches, 
and float switches. The output modules can each 
handle sixteen external devices such as pilot 
lights, solenoid coils, and relay coils. The oper-
ating voltage can be either AC or DC, depend-
ing on the make and model of controller, and is 
generally either 120 or 24 volts. The I/O rack 
shown in Figure 16-8A can handle ten modules. 
Because each module can handle sixteen input or 
output devices, the I/O rack is capable of handling 
160  input and output devices. Many PLCs are 
capable of handling multiple I/O racks.
providing a complete  circuit. Contact 18, however, is 
shown as normally closed. Because it is highlighted, 
coil 18 has not been energized, as a current path still 
exists through contact 18. Coil 257 is shown high-
lighted, indicating that it is energized. Because coil 
257 is energized, both 257 contacts are now closed, 
providing a current path through them.
When the loading terminal is used to load a pro-
gram into the PLC, contact and coil symbols on the 
keyboard are used, Figure 16-7. Other keys permit 
specific types of relays, such as timers, counters, or 
retentive relays, to be programmed into the logic of 
the circuit. Some keys permit parallel paths, generally 
referred to as down rungs, to be started and ended. 
The method employed to program a PLC is specific 
to the make and model of the controller. It is generally 
necessary to consult the manufacturer’s literature if 
you are not familiar with the specific PLC.

CHAPTER 16  Programmable Logic Controllers
the I/O input module uses opto-isolation to electri-
cally separate the incoming signal from the CPU. 
Figure  16-10 shows a typical circuit used for the 
input. A metal-oxide varistor (MOV) is connected 
across the AC input to help eliminate any voltage 
spikes that may occur on the line. The MOV is a 
voltage-sensitive resistor. As long as the voltage 
across its terminals remains below a certain level, it 
exhibits a very high resistance. If the voltage should 
become too high, the resistance almost instantly 
changes to a very low value. A bridge rectifier 
changes the AC voltage into DC. A resistor is used 
to limit current to an LED. When power is applied to 
the circuit, the LED turns on. The light is detected 
by a phototransistor, which signals the CPU that 
there is a voltage present at the input terminal.
When the module has more than one input, the 
bridge rectifiers are connected together on one side 
to form a common terminal. On the other side, the 
rectifiers are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Figure 16-11 
shows four bridge rectifiers connected together to 
form a common terminal. Figure 16-12 shows a 
limit switch connected to input 1, a temperature 
switch connected to input 2, a float switch con-
nected to input 3, and a normally open push button 
connected to input 4. Notice that the pilot devices 
complete a circuit to the bridge rectifiers. If any 
switch closes, 120 volts AC will be connected to a 
bridge rectifier, causing the corresponding LED to 
turn on and signal the CPU that the input has voltage 
applied to it. When voltage is applied to an input, the 
CPU considers that input to be at a high level.
I/O Capacity
One factor that determines the size and cost of 
a PLC is its I/O capacity. Many small units may be 
intended to handle as few as sixteen input and output 
devices. Large PLCs can generally handle several 
hundred. The number of input and output devices 
the controller must handle also affects the processor 
speed and amount of memory the CPU must have. 
A CPU with I/O racks is shown in Figure 16-9.
The Input Module
The CPU of a PLC is extremely sensitive to 
voltage spikes and electrical noise. For this reason,

LED. The LED is used to signal a solid-state device 
to connect the load to the line. If the load is operated 
by DC, a power phototransistor is used to connect the 
load to the line, Figure 16-13. If the load is an AC 
device, a triac is used to connect the load to the line, 
Figure 16-14. Notice that the CPU is separated from 
the external circuit by a light beam. No voltage spikes 
or electrical noise can be transmitted to the CPU.
The Output Module
The output module is used to connect the CPU 
to the load. Output modules provide line isolation 
between the CPU and the external circuit. Isolation 
is generally provided in one of two ways. The most 
popular is with optical isolation, very similar to the 
input modules. In this case, the CPU controls an

CHAPTER 16  Programmable Logic Controllers
interposing relay. Interposing relays are employed 
when the current draw of the load is above the cur-
rent rating of the output.
Internal Relays
The actual logic of the control circuit is per-
formed by internal relays. An internal relay is an 
imaginary device that exists only in the logic of 
the computer. It can have any number of contacts 
from one to several hundred, and the contacts 
can be programmed normally open or normally 
closed. Internal relays are programmed into the 
logic of the PLC by assigning them a certain 
number. Manufacturers provide a chart that lists 
which numbers can be used to program inputs and 
outputs, internal relay coils, timers, counters, and 
so on. When a coil is entered at the end of a line of 
logic and is given a number that corresponds to an 
internal relay, it will act like a physical relay. Any 
The second method of controlling the output is 
with small relays, Figure 16-15. The CPU controls 
the relay coil. The contacts connect the load to the 
line. The advantage of this type of output module is 
that it is not sensitive to whether the voltage is AC 
or DC and can control 120- or 24-volt circuits. The 
disadvantage is that it does contain moving parts 
that can wear. In this instance, the CPU is isolated 
from the external circuit by a magnetic field instead 
of a light beam.
If the module contains more than one output, one 
terminal of each output device is connected together 
to form a common terminal, similar to a module 
with multiple inputs, Figure 16-16. Notice that one 
side of each triac has been connected together to 
form a common point. The other side of each triac 
is labeled 1, 2, 3, or 4. If power transistors are used 
as output devices, the collectors or emitters of each 
transistor would be connected to form a common 
terminal. Figure 16-14 shows a relay coil connected 
to the output of a triac. Notice that the triac is used 
as a switch to connect the load to the line. The power 
to operate the load must be provided by an external 
source. Output modules do not provide power to 
operate external loads.
The amount of current an output can control is 
limited. The current rating of most outputs can range 
from 0.5 to about 3 amperes, depending on the make 
of the controller and the type of output being used. 
Outputs are intended to control loads that draw a 
small amount of current such as solenoid coils, pilot 
lights, and relay coils. Some outputs can control 
motor starter coils directly, and others require an

understand the action of the circuit, recall the opera-
tion of an off-delay timer. When the timer coil is 
energized, the timed contacts change position imme-
diately. When the coil is de-energized, the contacts 
remain in their energized state for some period of 
time before returning to their normal state.
In the circuit shown in Figure 16-17, it is assumed 
that contact 400 controls the action of the timer. Coil 
400 is an internal relay coil located somewhere in the 
circuit. Coil 12 is an output and controls some exter-
nal device. Coil TO-1 is an on-delay timer set for 
100-tenths of a second. When coil 400 is energized, 
both 400 contacts change position. The normally 
open 400 contact closes and provides a current path 
to coil 12. The normally closed 400 contact opens, 
which prevents a circuit from being completed to coil 
TO-1 when coil 12 energizes. Note that coil 12 turns 
on immediately when contact 400 is closed. When 
coil 400 is de-energized, both 400 contacts return to 
their normal position. A current path is maintained to 
coil 12 by the now closed 12 contact, in parallel with 
the normally open 400 contact. When the normally 
closed 400 contact returns to its normal position, a 
current path is established to coil TO-1 through the 
now closed 12 contact. This starts the time sequence 
of timer TO-1. After a delay of 10 seconds, the nor-
mally closed TO-1 contact opens and de-energizes 
coil 12, returning the two 12 contacts to their normal 
position. The circuit is now back in the state shown 
in Figure 16-17. Note the action of the circuit. When 
coil 400 was energized, output coil 12 turned on 
contacts given the same number as that relay will 
be controlled by that relay.
Timers and Counters
Timers and counters are also internal relays. 
There is no physical timer or counter in the PLC. 
They are programmed into the logic in the same 
manner as any other internal relay, by assign-
ing them a number that corresponds to a timer 
or counter. The difference is that the time delay 
or number of counts must be programmed when 
they are inserted into the program. The number of 
counts for a counter is entered using numbers on 
the keys on the load terminal. Timers are generally 
programmed in 0.1-second intervals. Some manu-
facturers provide a decimal key, whereas others do 
not. If a decimal key is not provided, the time delay 
is entered as 0.1-second intervals. If a delay of 10 
seconds is desired, for example, the number 100 
would be entered. One-hundred-tenths of a second 
equals 10 seconds.
Off-Delay Circuit
Some PLCs permit a timer to be programmed 
as on or off delay, but others permit only on-delay 
timers to be programmed. When a PLC permits only 
on-delay timers to be programmed, a simple circuit 
can be used to permit an on-delay timer to perform 
the function of an off-delay timer, Figure 16-17. To

cables. Electrical noise is such a problem in some 
installations that several manufacturers are using 
optical cables instead of wires for connection to the 
I/O rack.
Keep Wire Runs Short
Try to keep the wire runs as short as possible. A 
long wire run has more surface area of wire to pick 
up stray electrical noise.
Plan the Route of the Signal Cable
Before starting, plan how the signal cable should 
be installed. Never run signal wire in the same con-
duit with power wiring. Try to run signal wiring as 
far away from power wiring as possible. When it is 
necessary to cross power wiring, install the signal 
cable so that it crosses at a right angle, as shown in 
Figure 16-19.
Use Shielded Cable
Shielded cable is used for the installation of sig-
nal wiring. One of the most common types, shown 
in Figure 16-20, uses twisted wires with a Mylar 
foil shield. The ground wire must be grounded if 
the shielding is to operate properly. This type of 
shielded cable can provide a noise reduction ratio of 
about 30,000:1.
Another type of signal cable uses a twisted pair 
of signal wires surrounded by a braided shield. This 
type of cable provides a noise reduction ratio of 
about 300:1.
immediately. When coil 400 was de-energized, out-
put 12 remained on for 10  seconds before turning 
off.
The number of internal relays and timers con-
tained in a PLC is determined by the memory 
capacity of the computer. As a general rule, PLCs 
that have a large I/O capacity have a large amount 
of memory. The use of PLCs has steadily increased 
since their invention in the late 1960s. A PLC can 
replace hundreds of relays and occupy only a frac-
tion of the space. The circuit logic can be changed 
easily and quickly without requiring extensive hand 
rewiring. It has no moving parts or contacts to wear 
out, and its downtime is less than that for an equiva-
lent relay circuit. When replacement is necessary, it 
can be reprogrammed from a media storage device.
The programming methods presented in this text 
are general because it is impossible to include exam-
ples of equipment from each specific manufacturer. 
The concepts, however, are common to all program-
mable controllers. A PLC used to control a DC drive 
is shown in Figure 16-18.

LOGIC CONTROLLERS
In installing PLCs, several general rules should be 
followed. These rules are basically common sense 
and are designed to help reduce the amount of 
electrical noise that can be induced into the input

end. The preferred method is generally to ground the 
shield at the sensor.
 THE DIFFERENTIAL 
AMPLIFIER
An electronic device that is often used to help 
overcome the problem of induced noise is the dif-
ferential amplifier. This device, as illustrated in 
Figure 16-22, detects the voltage difference between 
the pair of signal wires and amplifies this difference. 
Because the induced noise level should be the same 
in both conductors, the amplifier will ignore the 
noise. For example, assume a sensor is producing a 
50- millivolt signal. This signal is applied to the input 
module, but induced noise is at a level of 5 volts. In 
this case the noise level is 100 times greater than the 
signal level. The induced noise level, however, is the 
same for both of the input conductors. Therefore, 
the differential amplifier ignores the 5-volt noise 
and amplifies only the voltage difference, which is 
50 millivolts.
Use of common coaxial cable should be avoided. 
This cable consists of a single conductor surrounded 
by a braided shield. This type of cable offers very 
poor noise reduction.
Grounding
Ground is generally thought of as being electri-
cally neutral or zero at all points. However, this may 
not always be the case in practical application. It is 
not uncommon to find that different pieces of equip-
ment have ground levels that are several volts apart, 
Figure 16-21. To overcome this problem, large cable 
is sometimes used to tie the two pieces of equip-
ment together. This forces them to exist at the same 
potential. This method is sometimes referred to as 
the brute-force method.
Where the brute-force method is not practical, 
the shield of the signal cable is grounded at only one

 operate each time the pressure switch closes in the 
event that one pump fails. An on–off switch can be 
used to stop all operation of the circuit.
Before a program can be developed from a ladder 
diagram, it is first necessary to determine the number 
of input and output devices. In the circuit shown in 
Figure 17-1, there are actually three input devices: the 
on–off switch, the pressure switch, and the selector 
switch. The selector switch, however, requires three 
separate inputs. Therefore, there will be five inputs 
to the PLC. Only two outputs are required for motor 
starter coils 1M and 2M. Coils TR and CR are inter-
nal relays that exist only in the logic of the PLC.
The first step in developing a program is to 
assign the external input and output devices to 
specific inputs and outputs. In this example, it is 
assumed that the PLC to be used has sixteen inputs 
and eight outputs.
Control circuits are generally drawn as standard 
schematic or ladder diagrams. These circuits are 
then converted into a logic diagram that can be 
loaded into the memory of a programmable logic 
controller. The circuit shown in Figure 17-1 will be 
converted for programming into a PLC. This circuit 
is used to control two well pumps. A housing devel-
opment contains one pressure tank that supplies 
water to the development. There are two separate 
deep wells, however, that supply water to the tank. It 
is desired that the wells be used equally. The circuit 
in Figure 17-1 will cause the pumps to alternate run-
ning each time the pressure switch closes. A selector 
switch can be set to any of three operating modes. 
In the auto mode, the circuit will operate automati-
cally and permit the pumps to alternate running each 
time the pressure switch closes. The selector switch 
can also be set to permit only one of the pumps to

CHAPTER 17  Developing a Program for a PLC 
Table 17-1 lists the numbers associated with 
inputs, outputs, internal relays, and timers. The table 
indicates that terminals 1 through 16 are inputs and 
terminals 17 through 24 are outputs. This PLC can 
have as many as seventy-five internal relays. Internal 
relay coil numbers range from 100 through  175. 
There can be a total of twenty-five timers pro-
grammed into this controller. Coils numbered 200 
through 225 are used for timers. It is also assumed 
that the internal clock that controls the operation of 
timers operates in 0.1-second intervals. Therefore, 
it will be necessary to program a value of 10 to 
produce the 1-second time delay for timer TR, as 
indicated on the schematic.
 ASSIGNING INPUTS 
AND OUTPUTS
In this example, the on–off switch is assigned to 
input 1; the pressure switch is assigned to input 2; 
the auto terminal of the selector switch is assigned to 
input 4; the pump 1 terminal is assigned to input 3; 
and the pump 2 terminal is assigned to input 5, 
Figure 17-2. Note that one side of each input device 
has been connected to the hot, or ungrounded, power 
terminal. The other side of each input device is con-
nected to the appropriate input terminal. PLCs do 
not provide power to the input or output terminals. 
The inputs and outputs must have power provided to 
them. The common (C) input terminal is connected 
to the neutral, or grounded, power conductor.
Motor starter coil 1M is connected to output 
terminal 17, and motor starter coil 2M is connected 
to output terminal 18. Also note that the normally 
closed overload contacts for starters 1M and 2M are 
 connected in series with the appropriate starter. It is 
common practice by many industries to leave the over-
load contacts hard wired to the starter coil to ensure 
that the starter will de-energize in the event of an over-
load. Some manufacturers of motor control equipment 
provide a second overload contact that is normally 
open. This contact can be used as an input to the PLC 
and placed in the logic of the circuit. In this example, 
however, it is assumed that the overload relay contains 
a single normally closed contact that will remain hard 
wired to the coil. The common output terminal is con-
nected to the hot, or ungrounded, power conductor, 
and the other side of each coil is connected to the neu-
tral, or grounded, power conductor.
 CONVERTING THE 
SCHEMATIC
The next step is to change the control schematic 
or ladder diagram into a logic diagram that can be 
loaded into the PLC. Some basic rules should be 
 followed when making this conversion:
• Each line of logic must end with a coil.
• Any contact labeled the same number as a coil 
is controlled by that coil.
• Each relay can have an infinite number of con-
tacts and they can be assigned as normally open 
or normally closed.
• Any coil assigned the same number as an out-
put will control that output.
• Any contact assigned the same number as an 
input is controlled by that input.
• The PLC assumes inputs to be low (no power 
applied) when the program is loaded into 
memory. When power is applied to an input, 
it will cause the contact assigned to that input 
to change state. A normally open contact will 
close, and a normally closed contact will open.
• Any number of contacts can be assigned to the 
same input.
In the schematic shown in Figure 17-1, contacts 
controlled by relay CR are used throughout the 
 circuit. It is assumed that this relay will be assigned 
coil number 100. It is also assumed that timer coil TR 
will be assigned coil number 200. The simplest way 
to convert a ladder diagram into a logic circuit is to

make the changes in stages. The first step is to draw a 
logic diagram that will control the operation of motor 
starter coil 1M. Because coil 1M is connected to out-
put 17, coil number 17 will be used for coil 1M. The 
circuit shown in Figure 17-3 fulfills the first basic step 
of the logic. Note that the on–off switch is connected 
to input 1. Therefore, contact 1 will be controlled 
by the on–off switch. When the switch is turned 
on, power will be provided to input terminal 1, and 
the normally open contact labeled 1 will close. The 
pressure switch is connected to input 2, and the auto 
terminal of the selector switch is  connected to input 
4. Because the control relay is to be assigned coil 
number 100, the CR1 contact is labeled 100. The nor-
mally closed 2M3 contact is labeled 18 because 2M 
motor starter coil is  connected to output terminal 18. 
Note that the normally closed overload contact (OL1) 
is not shown in the logic diagram because it is hard

CHAPTER 17  Developing a Program for a PLC 
wired to the starter coil. The 1M2 contact connected 
in parallel with the normally closed CR1 contact is 
labeled 17 because output 17 controls the operation of 
1M starter coil.
The next step is to add the logic that permits 
the pump 1 terminal of the selector switch to 
bypass the automatic control circuit. The pump 1 
terminal of the selector switch is connected to 
input terminal 3. The pressure switch must still 
control the operation of the pump if the collector 
switch is set in the pump 1 position. Therefore, 
another contact labeled 2 will be connected in 
series with contact 3. Another consideration is that 
the on–off switch controls power to the rest of the 
circuit. There are several ways of accomplishing 
this logic, depending on the type of PLC used, but 
in this example it will be accomplished by insert-
ing a normally open contact controlled by input 1 
in series with each line of logic. One advantage 
of PLCs is that any input can be assigned any 
 number of contacts. This amendment to the circuit 
is shown in Figure 17-4.
The logic to control motor starter coil 2M is 
developed in the same way as the logic for controlling 
starter coil 1M. The new logic is shown in Figure 17-5. 
The pump 2 terminal of the selector switch is con-
nected to input 5 of the PLC. The bypass control for 
pump 2 is added to the circuit in Figure 17-6.
In the circuit shown in Figure 17-1, the coil of 
CR relay is controlled by an off-delay timer with a 
delay of 1 second. This timer is used to ensure that 
there is no problem with a contact race. A contact 
race occurs when it is possible for one contact to open 
before another closes or for one contact to close before 
another opens. It is assumed that the PLC in this 
example contains on-delay timers only. It is therefore 
necessary to change the logic to make an off-delay 
timer. This was discussed in Chapter 16. To make this 
change, a second control relay labeled 101 is required. 
The complete circuit is shown in Figure 17-7.

CHAPTER 18  Fiber Optics
 FIBER OPTICS
Fiber-optic cable is becoming increasingly popular 
for data transmission in industrial environments. 
Fiber-optic cable has several advantages over copper 
wire for transmission of data. Copper wire is very 
susceptible to electromagnetic interference caused 
by electrical devices that draw large amounts of 
current, such as motors, transformers, and variable- 
frequency drives. Fiber-optic cable is totally immune 
to electromagnetic interference.
Also, the data transmission rate for fiber-optic 
cable is much higher than for copper. Twisted-pair 
copper cable is generally limited to a data transmis-
sion rate of about 1 MBPS (million bits per second). 
Coaxial cable can carry about 10 MBPS. Some spe-
cial coaxial cable can handle 400 MBPS. Fiber-optic 
cable can typically handle 8000 MBPS, and labora-
tory tests have shown that rates as high as 200,000 
MBPS are possible.
Due to the high frequency of light, fiber-optic 
cable has a very wide bandwidth as compared 
with copper wire. The bandwidth of fiber-optic 
cable is about a million times that of copper wire. 
Fiber-optic cables are much smaller and lighter 
in weight than copper cables. A single fiber is 
approximately 0.001 in. (1 micrometer [formerly 
“micron”]) in diameter and can carry five times 
more information than a telephone cable contain-
ing 900 pairs of 22 AWG twisted conductors. 
Single and duplex fiber-optic cables are shown in 
Figure 18-1.
Cable Construction
Fiber-optic cables are composed of three 
sections: the core, the cladding, and the sheath, 
Figure 18-2. The core is composed of either glass or 
plastic. Glass has a higher bit rate of transmission 
or bandwidth than plastic, and it has less line loss 
than plastic. Glass fibers are also able to withstand 
higher temperatures and are less affected by cor-
rosive atmospheres and environments. Plastic core 
fibers are more flexible and can be bent to a tighter 
radius than glass. Plastic fibers are stronger and can 
be cut, spliced, and terminated with less difficulty 
than glass.
The cladding or clad surrounds the core and is 
made of glass or plastic also. The clad serves two 
basic functions. It protects the core from the sur-
rounding environment, and it increases the size and 
strength of the cable itself. Increasing the size of the 
cable makes it easier to handle. The core and clad-
ding are considered the fiber optic.
The sheath is a polyurethane jacket that sur-
rounds the cable. The sheath protects the fiber optics 
from the environment. Fiber-optic cables may be 
packaged as a single fiber, fiber pairs, or several 
thousand fibers.
How Fiber-Optic Cable Works
Light travels in a straight line. Fiber-optic cable, 
however, makes it possible to bend light around 
corners and conduct it to any desired  location,

erty. The optical property is the speed at which 
light can travel through a material. Optical property 
is generally expressed as a term called index of 
refraction (IR), or . The index of refraction is the 
speed at which light travels through a material. It is 
determined by comparing the speed of light travel-
ing through vacuum to the speed of light traveling 
through a particular material.

Speed of light in material
In glass optical fibers, the index of refraction is 
approximately 1.46 to 1.51.
When an optical fiber cable is connected to a 
light source, Figure 18-4, light strikes the cable at 
Figure 18-3. The reason that light can travel through 
an optical fiber is because of refraction. Imagine 
that you are standing on the shore of a clear moun-
tain lake on a calm, windless day. If you looked out 
over the surface of the lake, you would probably see 
the sun, clouds, and trees reflected on the surface 
of the water. If you looked directly at the water at 
your feet, you would no longer see reflections of 
the clouds or trees, but you would see down into 
the water. This is an example of refraction instead 
of reflection. The angle at which you stopped see-
ing the reflection of clouds and trees and started 
seeing down into the water is called the critical 
angle or acceptance angle. The critical angle occurs 
because air and water have a different optical prop-

of the rings beneath. This produces a sharper angle 
of refraction for the outer rings. This arrangement 
helps to eliminate modal dispersion.
Cable Losses
Fiber-optic cables do suffer some losses or 
attenuation. No fiber-optic cable is perfect, and 
some amount of light does escape through the clad-
ding and is absorbed by the sheath. The greatest 
losses generally occur when cable is terminated or 
spliced. The ends of fiber-optic cable must be clean 
and free of scratches, nicks, or uneven strands. It is 
generally recommended that the ends of fiber-optic 
cable be polished when they are terminated. A spe-
cial hot knife cutting tool is available for cutting 
fiber-optic cable. A cable with multiple fiber-optic 
cables is shown in Figure 18-5.
Transmitters
Several factors should be considered in selecting 
a transmitter or light source for a fiber-optic system. 
One is the wavelength of the light source. Many 
fiber-optic cables specify a range of wavelengths for 
best performance. The wavelength can be measured 
by the color of the emitted light.
Another consideration is the spectral width. 
Spectral width is a measure of the range of colors 
that are emitted by the light source. The spectral 
width affects the color distortion that occurs in the 
optic fiber.
many different angles. Some photons strike at an 
angle that cannot be refracted and are lost through 
the cladding and absorbed by the sheath. Photons 
that can be refracted bounce down the core to the 
receiving device. This bouncing action of the pho-
tons causes a condition known as modal dispersion. 
Because photons enter the cable at different angles, 
some bounce more times than others before they 
reach the end of the cable, causing them to arrive 
later than photons that bounce fewer times. This 
causes a variance in the phase of the light reach-
ing the source. Modal dispersion can be greatly 
reduced by using fiber cables called single-mode 
cables. Single-mode cables have a diameter of 1 
to 2 micrometers. The cladding also affects modal 
dispersion. If the cladding thickness is kept to within 
three times the wavelength of the light, modal dis-
persion is eliminated.
Another type of cable that is much larger than 
single-mode cable is multimode cable. Multimode 
cable ranges in thickness from about 5 to 1000 
micrometers. Multimode cable can cause severe 
modal dispersion in long lengths of several thou-
sand feet. For short runs, however, it is generally 
preferred because it is larger in size and easier to 
work with than single-mode cable. Multimode cable 
is also less expensive than single-mode cable, and 
for short runs the modal dispersion generally is neg-
ligible.
Another type of multimode cable called graded 
cable has a core made of concentric rings. The 
rings on the outside have a lower density than that

CHAPTER 18  Fiber Optics 
321
Receivers
Receivers convert the light input signal into an 
electrical signal that can be used by the program-
mable controller or other devices. Receiver units 
generally consist of a photodiode, Figure 18-7. 
Photodiodes are preferred over other types of photo 
detection devices because of their speed of operation.
Transceivers
Transceivers house both a transmitter and 
receiver in the same package. Transceivers are often 
used as photodetection devices. Assume that half 
of the fiber-optic fibers in a cable are connected to 
the transmitter, and the other half are connected to 
the receiver. If a shiny object, such as a can on an 
assembly line, should pass in front of the cable, the 
light supplied by the transmitter would be reflected 
off the can back to the receiver, Figure 18-8. The 
output of the receiver could be connected to the 
input of a programmable controller that causes a 
counter to step each time a can is detected.
Another device that contains both a transmitter 
and receiver is call a repeater. A repeater is used to 
boost the signal when fiber-optic cable is run long 
distances. Repeaters not only amplify the signal but 
also can reshape digital signals back to their original 
form. This ability of the repeater to reshape a digital 
signal back to its original form is one of the great 
advantages of digital-type signals over analog. The 
repeater “knows” what the original digital signal 
looked like, but it does not “know” what an origi-
nal analog signal looked like. A great disadvantage 
of analog-type signals is that any distortion of the 
original signal or noise is amplified.
 FIBER-OPTIC 
CONNECTORS
One of the greatest problems with fiber-optic sys-
tems is poor connections. There are two conditions 
that generally account for poor connections: bad 
alignment between cables, or devices and air gaps 
between cables or devices. An air gap changes the 
index of refraction, causing Fresnel reflection at the 
point of connection. An air gap can produce an opti-
cal resonant cavity at the point of connection. This 
The numerical aperture (NA) is a measure of the 
angle at which light is emitted from the source. If 
the NA of the source is too wide, it can overfill the 
NA of the optical fiber. If the NA of the source is 
too small, it will underfill the fiber. A low-NA light 
source helps reduce losses in both the optical fiber 
and at connection points.
Transmitter light sources are generally light-
emitting diode (LED) or laser, Figure 18-6. LEDs 
are relatively inexpensive, operate with low power, 
and have a wide spectral width. They are generally 
used for short distances of about 7 kilometers, or 
4.3 miles. LEDs have relatively low bandwidths of 
about 200 MHz or less. They can be used for data bit 
transmission rates of about 200 MBPS or less. LEDs 
have wavelengths that range from about 850 to 
1300 nanometers.
Laser diodes are expensive, require a large 
amount of operating power, and have a narrow 
spectral width. They can be used for extremely long 
distance transmission and can handle very high rates 
of data transmission. Laser diodes are generally 
used for telephone and cable television applica-
tions. Laser diodes operate at a wavelength of about 
1300 nanometers.

probably not be in the same alignment. Threaded 
connectors typically have losses of 0.6 to 0.8 dB.
In the mid-1980s, the bayonet connector, shown 
in Figure 18-11, was introduced. This connector 
solved some of the basic problems of the threaded 
connector. The twist-lock action provides uniform 
tightness each time the connector is used, and rota-
tional alignment is more constant. This connector 
typically has a loss of about 0.5 dB. Bayonet con-
nectors are still widely used throughout industry. 
The push–pull type of connector, Figure 18-12, 
has become very popular for connecting fiber-optic 
cables because it offers excellent alignment and 
has less back reflection than other types of connec-
tors. Push–pull connectors typically have a loss of 
about 0.2 dB.
Electrical connection devices, such as extension 
cords, generally have a male connector on one end 
and a female on the other. Fiber-optic cables gener-
ally employ male connectors on both ends. Devices 
that they connect to have a female connection. When 
two fiber-optic cables are to be joined together, a 
coupler with two female ends is employed, as illus-
trated in Figure 18-13.
resonant cavity causes light to be reflected back to 
the transmitter, where it is bounced back again to be 
reflected back to the receiver.
If the fiber-optic cable is not aligned correctly, 
part of the light signal will not be transmitted 
between the two cables and the device to which it 
is connected. Losses due to poor connection can be 
substantial. Losses are measured in decibels (dB).

There are three basic types of fiber-optic con-
nectors: the threaded, the bayonet, and the push–
pull, as illustrated in Figure 18-9. The threaded type, 
shown in Figure 18-10, was one of the earliest to 
be introduced. The use of threaded connectors has 
decreased because of poor performance. One prob-
lem with this type of connector is how tight to make 
the connection. Also, there is nothing to control 
rotational alignment. If a threaded connector is dis-
connected and then reconnected, the two cables will

• The individual light sources do not produce 
an electromagnetic field that could interfere 
with sensitive electrical equipment. The only 
electrical connection is at the illuminator; thus, 
individual light sources do not produce an elec-
tromagnetic field.
Fiber-optic lighting has a significant limitation: 
It cannot provide the amount of illumination that 
can be obtained with conventional light sources. 
Advances are being made in this technology, and 
in the near future it is likely that fiber-optic cables 
will deliver the quantity of light necessary to com-
pete with the common luminaire. Fiber-optic cables 
could then be employed to provide illumination in 
hazardous locations without expensive explosion-
proof luminaires.
Fiber-optic lighting systems are composed of 
three primary sections: the illuminator, the cable, 
and the end fixtures, Figure 18-15. The illumina-
tor is the only part of the system requiring electri-
cal connections, permitting it to be located where 
it is convenient for maintenance and lamp (bulb) 
replacement.

kit contains a crimp tool and crimping dies, polishing 
bushings, polishing film, cable and fiber strippers, 
microscope with tripod, and an epoxy curing oven.
 FIBER-OPTIC 
LIGHTING
Fiber-optic lighting has several advantages over con-
ventional lighting.
• It can be employed in swimming pools and 
fountains without the shock hazard and electri-
cal requirements of waterproof luminaires.
• It can be located in outdoor areas for accent 
lighting of buildings and walkways.
• It is supplied by a single light source; thus, the lumi-
naires produce no heat and have no electrical con-
nections, and the lamps never need replacement.
• It is ideal for applications in museums to accent 
valuable works of art because it does not pro-
duce heat or ultraviolet radiation, which is a 
major cause of color fading.

the typical ignition temperature of these hazardous 
materials. Groups A, B, C, and D are found in Class 
I locations. Groups E, F, and G are found in Class II 
locations. There are no group listings for Class III 
locations.
In addition, hazardous locations are divided into 
two divisions that depend on the likelihood of the 
hazard being present. Division 1 locations are areas 
considered to be hazardous at any or all times during 
normal operations. Division 2 locations are areas that 
could become hazardous through a foreseeable acci-
dent. For example, an area in which gasoline is manu-
factured would be considered Class I, Division 1. 
An area in which maintenance is done on trucks that 
transport the gasoline would be Class I, Division 2.
 EQUIPMENT 
APPROVAL
The NEC states in 500.8(B) that equipment shall be 
approved not only for the class location but also for 
the specific type of atmosphere that will be present. 
In addition, equipment located in a Class I location 
cannot have an exposed surface that operates at a 
temperature greater than the autoignition temperature 
of the surrounding gas or vapor. Equipment located in 
a Class II location cannot have a surface temperature 
greater than that specified in 500.8(D)(2), and equip-
ment located in a Class III location cannot have a sur-
face temperature greater than that specified in 503.5.
Group A
Group A is an atmosphere that contains acetylene.
Group B
Group B contains flammable gas or flammable 
liquid-produced vapor having either a maximum 
experimental safe gap (MESG) value less than or 
equal to 0.45 mm or a minimum ignition current 
ratio (MIC) less than or equal to 0.40 mm.
Group C
Group C contains flammable gas or flammable 
liquid-produced vapor having either a maximum 
experimental safe gap value greater than 0.45 mm 
and less than or equal to 0.75 mm, or a minimum 
ignition current ratio greater than 0.40 mm and less 
than or equal to 0.80 mm.
Group D
Group D contains flammable gas or flammable-
produced vapor having either a MESG value greater 
than 0.75 mm or a minimum current ratio greater 
than 0.80 mm. Typical materials and atmosphere 
ignition temperatures are shown in Table 19-1 for 
different groups.
Group E
Group E contains combustible metal dusts, 
including aluminum, magnesium, and their com-
mercial alloys, or other combustible dusts whose 
particle size, abrasives, and conductivity present 
similar hazards in the use of electrical equipment.
Group F
Group F contains combustible carbonaceous 
dusts that have more than 8% total entrapped vola-
tiles or that have been sensitized by other materials 
so that they present an explosion hazard.
Group G
Group G contains combustible dusts not included 
in Groups E or F, including flour, grain, wood, plas-
tic, and chemicals.
 INTRINSICALLY 
SAFE CIRCUITS AND 
EQUIPMENT
As stated in 504.10(B), equipment and associated 
apparatus that have been identified as intrinsically 
safe are permitted in any hazardous (classified) loca-
tion for which it has been identified. The equipment 
must be approved for the type of atmosphere in 
which it is to be used. Intrinsically safe equipment 
and circuits operate at low power  levels. These cir-
cuits and equipment operate at a low enough power 
that, even under overload or fault conditions, they 
do not contain enough electrical or thermal energy

to cause ignition of the surrounding atmosphere. 
Abnormal conditions are considered to be accidental 
damage to field wiring, failure of equipment, acci-
dental application of overvoltage, and misadjust-
ment of equipment. Intrinsically safe circuits must 
be physically separated from all other circuits that 
are not so considered. Seals must be used to prevent 
the passage of gas or vapor as they are in higher-
voltage systems. The installation of intrinsically safe 
systems is covered in 504.
 EQUIPMENT
The NEC states in 500.8(B) that the equipment used 
in a hazardous location must be approved not only 
for that location but also for the particular type of 
atmosphere in which the equipment is used. As stated 
in 501.10(A)(1), rigid metal conduit, threaded steel 
intermediate metal conduit, or type MI cable with 
approved termination fittings is required in a Class I, 
Division 1 location. In general, the use of rigid metal 
conduit or threaded steel intermediate metal conduit 
is also required in Class II locations (502.10) and in 
Class III locations (503.10). In a Class I, Division 2 
location, type MI, MC, MV, or TC cable may be used 
with approved fittings. A type SNM cable with an 
approved termination fitting is shown in Figure 19-1.
Class I, Division 1 locations are considered to 
be the most hazardous. Equipment used in a Class 
I, Division 1 location must be explosionproof. 
Explosionproof equipment is designed to withstand 
an internal explosion without permitting hot gases 
or vapors to escape to the outside atmosphere. This 
is accomplished by forcing the escaping gas to 
travel across large, flat surfaces or through screw 
threads before it exits to the outside atmosphere, 
Figure 19-2. This cools the hot gas or vapor below 
the ignition point of the surrounding atmosphere.
As a general rule, equipment installed in a Class 
II location must be dust-ignitionproof. The defini-
tion of a dust-ignitionproof enclosure is given in

500.2. A dusttight enclosure is constructed so that 
dust cannot enter the enclosure.
Manufacturers of equipment intended for use 
in hazardous locations often design the equipment 
so that it can be used in more than one area. In 
Figure 19-3, several outlet boxes are shown. These 
outlet boxes can be used in Class I, Groups C and D; 
Class II, Groups E, F, and G; and Class III locations.
 SEALS
NEC 501.15 requires the use of conduit seals. Seals 
are used to minimize the passage of gas and to pre-
vent the passage of flame through the conduit. In 
general, they are required within 18 in. (450 mm) of 
an explosionproof enclosure and in any conduit that 
exits from a more hazardous location to a less haz-
ardous location, Figure 19-4. Seals are available in 
standard conduit sizes and can be installed vertically 
or horizontally. Seals designed to be installed in a 
vertical position are shown in Figure 19-5. Those 
designed to be installed in a horizontal position are 
shown in Figure 19-6.
When seals are installed, the conductors must 
be pulled through the seal and the system tested for 
shorts or grounds before the sealing compound is 
added. A cutaway view of a vertical seal is shown in 
Figure 19-7. To add the sealing compound, the large 
plug is removed. A fiber material is then packed

CHAPTER 19  Hazardous Locations
Horizontal seals contain two separate plugs, a large 
one and a small one. When the seal is installed, the 
large plug is removed first to permit the installation 
of the fiber material. Once this has been accom-
plished, the plug is replaced and the liquid sealing 
around the inside bottom of the seal to form a dam. 
The dam prevents the sealing compound, before it 
becomes hard, from flowing down the conduit.
When horizontal seals are installed, two separate 
fiber dams must be used, as shown in Figure 19-8.

A multiple circuit-breaker panelboard, suitable 
for Class II areas, is shown in Figure 19-11. This 
panelboard is considered to be dust-ignitionproof 
and can contain up to 24 single-pole breakers, 
12  double-pole breakers, or eight 3-pole breakers. 
This panelboard, however, is not permitted in areas 
 containing hazardous gas or vapors. A multiple 
compound is poured in through the opening pro-
vided by the smaller plug.
Condensation is sometimes a problem because 
it causes moisture to collect inside the conduit. To 
help prevent this problem, some vertical seals are 
designed with drain plugs, Figure 19-9. These seals 
are installed in low areas where long horizontal 
runs of conduit turn down. The seals are designed 
so that a hollow shaft extends through the sealing 
compound. The plugs can be removed periodically 
to drain moisture from the system. Some drain seal 
fittings contain weep holes to permit continuous 
draining.
 CIRCUIT-BREAKER 
PANELBOARDS
When circuit breakers are installed in Class I loca-
tions, they must be explosionproof. The type of 
enclosure used is determined by the atmosphere in 
the area where the device is to be installed, the size 
of the breaker needed, and the number of breakers 
required. A single circuit breaker and enclosure is 
shown in Figure 19-10. This type of breaker can 
be obtained in 50-, 100-, and 225-ampere frame 
sizes.

glass globe that covers the lamp is not designed to 
contain an internal explosion. For this reason, these 
luminaires are not permitted in a Class I, Division 
1 location. They can be used in a Class I, Division 
2 location, however.
An explosionproof luminaire is shown in 
Figure 19-14. This luminaire can be used in a Class 
I, Division 1 location. The glass globe is made 
of tempered glass, which can withstand an inter-
nal explosion. This type of luminaire can also be 
equipped with an inner globe of colored glass if 
circuit-breaker panelboard that is permitted in Class 
I areas is shown in Figure 19-12.
 LUMINAIRES
Luminaires used in hazardous locations can be 
obtained in many different types, styles, and sizes. 
The luminaires shown in Figure 19-13 are known 
as enclosed and gasketed. They are considered to 
be vaportight, but they are not explosionproof. The

CHAPTER 19  Hazardous Locations

T Ratings of Luminaires
Luminaires intended for use in hazardous loca-
tions have a temperature or “T” rating. The T rat-
ing indicates the maximum operating temperature 
of the luminaire. The operating temperature must 
be kept below the ignition temperature of the sur-
rounding atmosphere. The chart in Table 19-2 lists 
the T number and the maximum operating tempera-
ture of a luminaire with that number. Luminaires 
listed for use in Division 1 locations are expected 
to be installed in areas where hazardous material 
is present at all times. For this reason, the T rating 
is established by measuring the temperature on the 
outer surface of the luminaire. Luminaires listed 
for use in Division 2 locations are not expected 
to be in the presence of hazardous material under 
normal conditions. The T rating of these luminaires 
is established by measuring the temperature at the 
hottest spot on the luminaire, which is the lamp 
itself.
Installation of Luminaires
NEC 501.130(A)(3) describes the method for 
installing pendant (hanging) luminaires in a hazard-
ous location. In general, power is supplied through 
threaded rigid metal conduit or threaded steel inter-
mediate conduit. If the stem is 12 in. (300  mm) 
long or less, no extra bracing is required. If the 
stem is longer than 12 in. (300 mm), however, lat-
eral braces must be placed within 12 in. (300 mm) 
of the luminaire, or an explosionproof flexible 
coupling must be used within 12 in. (300 mm) of 
the junction box, Figure 19-17. An explosionproof 
flexible coupling used for this purpose is shown in 
Figure 19-18.
 MOTOR CONTROLS
NEC 501.115 states that switches, circuit break-
ers, and make-and-break contacts of push buttons, 
relays, alarms, and so on, must be enclosed in an 
explosionproof enclosure when used in a Class I 
location. There is an exception, however, if the con-
tacts are immersed in oil or hermetically sealed, or 
if the circuit does not contain sufficient energy to 
ignite the surrounding atmosphere. Explosionproof 
desired. A cutaway view of this type of luminaire is 
shown in Figure 19-15.
Fluorescent-type luminaires can also be 
obtained for use in hazardous locations. The lumi-
naire shown in Figure 19-16 can be used in Class 
I and Class II locations. These luminaires are also 
permitted in paint-spray areas and wet locations. 
They use heavy-duty glass tubes to cover the fluo-
rescent lamps. The ballast is contained in an explo-
sionproof enclosure.

manual motor starters are shown in Figure 19-19. 
These starters can be used to control AC or DC 
motors. They contain heaters to provide running 
overcurrent protection for the motor. A single man-
ual motor starter is shown in Figure 19-20. This 
particular starter can be used in atmospheres that 
contain hydrogen.
With use of explosionproof starters, it is often 
necessary to adjust the rating of the overload heater 
size. This is because the heater must be contained 
inside the explosionproof enclosure, which makes 
heat dissipation difficult. The chart in Figure 19-21 
is used to select the proper overload heater size for 
the manual motor starter shown in Figure 19-20.

CHAPTER 19  Hazardous Locations
Most motor control circuits are either semi-
automatic or automatic, and require the use of 
pilot devices such as the push buttons shown 
in Figure  19-22. All pilot devices, such as limit 
switches, flow switches, float switches, and so on, 
must be contained inside explosionproof enclosures 
when used in a Class I location. Semiautomatic 
and automatic controls require the use of magnetic 
starters, contactors, and relays. These contactors 
and/or starters also must be contained inside explo-
sionproof enclosures. The motor starter shown in 
Figure 19-23 contains a circuit breaker and motor 
starter with overload relay.
 FLEXIBLE CORDS 
AND RECEPTACLES
Flexible cords and attachment plugs are permitted 
in hazardous locations for the operation of por-
table lights or equipment, Figure 19-24 (501.140, 
502.140, and 503.140). When they are used, they 
must comply with the following conditions:
 1. Be approved for extra-hard usage
 2. Contain a separate grounding conductor
 3. Be properly connected to terminals or supply 
conductors

that no tension is transmitted to the terminal 
 connection
 5. Be supplied with seals to prevent the entrance 
of flammable vapors in a Class I location, 
flammable dust in a Class II location, or the 
entrance of fibers in a Class III location
Plugs and receptacles must be approved for the 
location in which they are used (501.145, 502.145, 
and 503.145). Explosionproof receptacles are con-
structed with an internal switch that disconnects the 
power from the circuit before the attachment plug is 
removed. A cutaway view of this type of receptacle is 
shown in Figure 19-25. This plug and receptacle are 
constructed in such a manner that the attachment plug 
can be inserted into or removed from the receptacle 
only when the disconnect switch is in the off position. 
This is done to prevent the possibility of an arc being 
produced outside of the explosionproof enclosure 
when the plug is connected or disconnected. Once the 
plug has been inserted into the receptacle, the switch 
is turned on by twisting the plug in a clockwise direc-
tion. An explosionproof receptacle and attachment 
plug are shown in Figure 19-26.

Great care must be exercised when installing or main-
taining explosionproof equipment. The improper instal-
lation or maintenance of this equipment can completely 
negate the system’s integrity. The mating surfaces of 
explosionproof boxes are ground flat to provide a very 
close fit. A screwdriver gouge or deep scratch can pro-
vide the exit point for hot gases to escape and ignite the 
surrounding atmosphere, Figure 19-34.

as pressure piling. Pressure piling occurs when 
the hot gases produced by an internal explosion 
travel through a conduit to an adjacent enclosure, 
Figure 19-35.
These hot gases add to the volume of gas already 
present in the second enclosure. If the gases in the 
second enclosure are ignited by the hot gas produced 
by the explosion in the first enclosure, the pressure 
produced in the second enclosure can be as great 
as three times what would be normally expected. 
A properly installed seal, however, prevents the 
passage of hot gas from one enclosure to the other, 
Figure 19-36.
Seals are especially important when the conduit 
leaves a hazardous location and enters a nonhazard-
ous location, Figure 19-4. The equipment and enclo-
sures in a nonhazardous location are not designed to 
withstand any type of internal explosion and would 
be completely destroyed.
Some types of explosionproof enclosures are 
designed to be drilled and tapped in the field. When 
this is done, at least five full threads should be 
engaged between the conduit and the enclosure, 
Figure 19-37.
The ground surfaces of explosionproof enclo-
sures should be cleaned with solvent to remove dirt 
particles before the parts are bolted together. If it 
is necessary to remove a substance that cannot be 
cleaned with solvent, use a fine steel wool; never use 
sandpaper or a sharp scraping instrument such as a 
putty knife. All bolts must be in place and tight. If 
one bolt is missing, the enclosure may not be able 
to prevent ignition of the surrounding atmosphere in 
the event of an internal explosion.
Seals must be installed between explosion-
proof enclosures to prevent a condition known

of current produced by the charging capacitor can 
cause the AC sine wave to become distorted. These 
distorted current and voltage waveforms flow back 
into the other parts of the power system, Figure 20-2.
 HARMONIC 
EFFECTS
Harmonics can have very detrimental effects on elec-
trical equipment. Some common symptoms of har-
monics are overheated conductors and transformers, 
and circuit breakers that seem to trip when they should 
not. Harmonics are classified by name, frequency, and 
sequence. The name refers to whether the harmonic is 
the second, third, fourth, and so on, of the fundamental 
frequency. The frequency refers to the operating fre-
quency of the harmonic. The second harmonic oper-
ates at 120 hertz, the third at 180 hertz, the fourth at 
240 hertz, and so on. The sequence refers to the phasor 
rotation with respect to the fundamental waveform. 
In an induction motor, a positive sequence harmonic 
rotates in the same direction as the fundamental 
frequency. A negative sequence harmonic rotates in 
the opposite direction of the fundamental frequency. 
Harmonics called triplens have a zero sequence. 
Triplens are the odd multiples of the third harmonic 
(3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, and so on). The sequence of the 
first nine harmonics is shown in Table 20-1.
Harmonics are voltages or currents that operate at 
a frequency that is a multiple of the fundamental 
power frequency. If the fundamental power fre-
quency is 60 hertz, for example, the second harmonic 
would be 120 hertz, the third harmonic would be 
180 hertz, and so on. Harmonics are produced by 
nonlinear loads that draw current in pulses rather 
than in a continuous manner. Harmonics on single-
phase power lines are generally caused by devices 
such as computer power supplies, electronic ballasts 
in fluorescent lights, triac light dimmers, and so on. 
Three-phase harmonics are generally produced by 
variable-frequency drives for AC motors and elec-
tronic drives for DC motors. A good example of a 
pulsating load is one that converts accurrent into DC 
and then regulates the DC voltage by pulse-width 
modulation, Figure 20-1. Many regulated power 
supplies operate in this manner. The bridge rectifier 
in Figure 20-1 changes the AC into pulsating DC. A 
filter capacitor is used to smooth the pulsations. The 
transistor turns on and off to supply power to the 
load. The amount of time the transistor is turned on 
as compared with the time it is turned off determines 
the output DC voltage. Each time the transistor turns 
on, it causes the capacitor to begin discharging. 
When the transistor turns off, the capacitor will begin 
to charge again. Current is drawn from the AC line 
each time the capacitor charges. These pulsations

CHAPTER 20  Harmonics
Harmonics with a positive sequence generally 
cause overheating of conductors and transformers 
and circuit breakers. Negative sequence harmonics 
can cause the same heating problems as positive 
harmonics plus additional problems with motors. 
Because the phasor rotation of a negative harmonic 
is opposite that of the fundamental frequency, it 
tends to weaken the rotating magnetic field of an 
induction motor, causing it to produce less torque. 
The reduction of torque causes the motor to operate 
below normal speed. The reduction in speed results 
in excessive motor current and overheating.
Although triplens do not have a phasor rota-
tion, they can cause a great deal of trouble in a 
3-phase, 4-wire system, such as a 208/120-volt or 
480/277-volt system. In a common 208/120-volt 
wye-connected system, the primary is generally 
connected in delta, and the secondary is connected 
in wye, Figure 20-3.
Single-phase loads that operate on 120 volts are 
connected between any phase conductor and the neu-
tral conductor. The neutral current is the vector sum 
of the phase currents. In a balanced 3-phase circuit 
(all phases having equal current), the neutral current 
is zero. Although single-phase loads tend to cause an 
unbalanced condition, the vector sum of the currents 
generally causes the neutral conductor to carry less 
current than any of the phase  conductors. This is true 
for loads that are linear and draw a continuous sine 
wave current. When pulsating (nonlinear) currents 
are connected to a 3-phase, 4-wire system, triplen 
harmonic frequencies disrupt the normal phasor

to respond to the heating effect of the true RMS cur-
rent value. If the current becomes too great, the bime-
tallic mechanism trips the breaker open. Harmonic 
currents cause a distortion of the RMS value, which 
can cause the breaker to trip when it should not, or not 
to trip when it should. Thermomagnetic circuit break-
ers, however, are generally better protection against 
harmonic currents than electronic circuit breakers. 
Electronic breakers sense the peak value of cur-
rent. The peaks of harmonic currents are generally 
higher than the fundamental sine wave, Figure 20-4. 
Although the peaks of harmonic currents are generally 
higher than the fundamental frequency, they can be 
lower. In some cases, electronic breakers may trip at 
low currents and in other cases they may not trip at all.
 BUS DUCTS 
AND PANELBOARD 
PROBLEMS
Triplen harmonic currents can also cause problems 
with neutral bus ducts and connecting lugs. A neu-
tral bus is sized to carry the rated phase current. 
Because triplen harmonics can cause the neutral 
 current to be higher than the phase current, it is pos-
sible for the neutral bus to become overloaded.
Electrical panelboards and bus ducts are 
designed to carry currents that operate at 60 hertz. 
Harmonic currents produce magnetic fields that 
operate at higher frequencies. If these fields should 
become mechanically resonant with the panelboard 
relationship of the phase currents and can cause the 
phase currents to add in the neutral conductor instead 
of cancel. Because the neutral conductor is not pro-
tected by a fuse or circuit breaker, there is real danger 
of excessive heating in the neutral conductor.
Harmonic currents are also reflected in the delta 
primary winding where they circulate and cause 
overheating. Other heating problems are caused by 
eddy current and hysteresis losses. Transformers 
are typically designed for 60-hertz operation. 
Higher harmonic frequencies produce greater core 
losses than the transformer is designed to handle. 
Transformers that are connected to circuits that 
produce harmonics must sometimes be derated 
or replaced with transformers that are  specially 
designed to operate with harmonic  frequencies.
Transformers are not the only electrical compo-
nent to be affected by harmonic currents. Emergency 
and standby generators can be affected in the same 
way as transformers. This is especially true for 
standby generators used to power data-processing 
equipment in the event of a power failure. Some har-
monic frequencies can even distort the zero crossing 
of the waveform produced by the generator.
 CIRCUIT-BREAKER 
PROBLEMS
Thermomagnetic circuit breakers use a bimetallic trip 
mechanism that is sensitive to the heat produced by 
the circuit current. These circuit breakers are designed

CHAPTER 20  Harmonics
 1. Make an equipment check. Personal com-
puters, printers, and fluorescent lights with 
electronic ballast are known to produce har-
monics. Any piece of equipment that draws 
current in pulses can produce harmonics.
 2. Review maintenance records to see whether 
there have been problems with circuit breakers 
tripping for no apparent reason.
 3. Check transformers for overheating. If the 
cooling vents are unobstructed and the trans-
former is operating excessively hot, harmonics 
could be the problem. Check transformer cur-
rents with an ammeter capable of indicating 
a true RMS current value. Make sure that the 
voltage and current ratings of the transformer 
have not been exceeded.
It is necessary to use an ammeter that responds 
to true RMS current when making this check. Some 
ammeters respond to the average value, not the RMS 
value. Meters that respond to the true RMS value 
generally state this on the meter. Meters that respond 
to the average value are generally less expensive 
and do not state that they are RMS meters. A clamp-
type ammeter that responds to a true RMS current is 
shown in Figure 20-5.
or bus duct enclosures, the panelboards and bus 
ducts can vibrate and produce buzzing sounds at the 
harmonic frequency.
Telecommunications equipment is often affected 
by harmonic currents. Telecommunication cable is 
often run close to power lines. To minimize inter-
ference, communication cables are run as far from 
phase conductors as possible and as close to the 
neutral conductor as possible. Harmonic currents 
in the neutral conductor induce high-frequency 
currents into the communication cable. These high-
frequency currents can be heard as a high-pitched 
buzzing sound on telephone lines.
 DETERMINING 
HARMONIC 
PROBLEMS ON 
SINGLE-PHASE 
SYSTEMS
There are several steps that can be followed in deter-
mining whether there is a problem with harmonics. 
One step is to do a survey of the equipment. This is 
especially important in determining whether there is 
a problem with harmonics in a single-phase system.

waveforms.

value for a sine wave current. True RMS-responding 
meters calculate the heating effect of the current. 
The chart in Figure 20-6 shows some of the differ-
ences between average indicating meters and true 
RMS meters. In a distorted waveform, the true RMS 
value of current will no longer be the average value 
multiplied by 1.111, Figure 20-7. The distorted 
waveform generally causes the average value to be 
as much as 50% less than the RMS value.
Another method of determining whether a har-
monic problem exists in a single-phase system is 
to make two separate current checks. One check is 
made using an ammeter that indicates the true RMS 
value and the other is made using a meter that indi-
cates the average value, Figure 20-8. In this example, 
it is assumed that the true RMS ammeter indicates a 
value of 36.8 amperes and the average ammeter 
indicates a value of 24.8 amperes. Determine the 
ratio of the two measurements by dividing the aver-
age value by the true RMS value.

A ratio of 1 would indicate no harmonic distortion. 
A ratio of 0.5 would indicate extreme harmonic 
distortion. This method does not reveal the name or 
Meters that respond to the average value use a 
rectifier to convert the alternating current into direct 
current. This value must be increased by a factor of 
1.111 to change the average reading into the RMS

higher current measurements made with the true 
RMS-indicating ammeter, and also the fact that the 
neutral current is higher than any phase current.
 DEALING WITH 
HARMONIC 
PROBLEMS
After it has been determined that harmonic prob-
lems exist, something must be done to deal with the 
problems. It is generally not practical to remove the 
equipment causing the harmonic distortion, so other 
methods must be employed. It is a good idea to con-
sult a power quality expert to determine the exact 
nature and amount of harmonic distortion present. 
Some general procedures for dealing with harmon-
ics are as follows:
 1. In a 3-phase, 4-wire system, reduce the 
60-hertz part of the neutral current by balanc-
ing the current on the phase conductors. If all 
phases have equal current, the neutral current 
would be zero.
 2. If triplen harmonics are present on the neutral 
conductor, add harmonic filters at the load. 
These filters can help reduce the amount of 
harmonics on the line.
 3. Pull extra neutral conductors. The ideal situa-
tion would be to use a separate neutral for each 
phase instead of using a shared neutral.
 4. Install a larger neutral conductor. If it is 
impractical to supply a separate neutral con-
ductor for each phase, increase the size of the 
common neutral.
 DETERMINING 
HARMONIC 
PROBLEMS ON 
3-PHASE SYSTEMS
Determining whether a problem with harmonics 
exists in a 3-phase system is similar to determining 
the problem in a single-phase system. Because har-
monic problems in a 3-phase system generally occur 
in a wye-connected, 4-wire system, this example 
will assume a delta-connected primary and wye-
connected secondary with a center-tapped neutral, 
as shown in Figure 20-3. To test for harmonic distor-
tion in a 3-phase, 4-wire system, measure all phase 
currents and the neutral current with both a true 
RMS-indicating ammeter and an average indicat-
ing ammeter. It is assumed that the 3-phase system 
being tested is supplied by a 200 kVA transformer, 
and that the current values shown in Table 20-2 are 
recorded. The current values indicate that a problem 
with harmonics does exist in the system. Note the

CHAPTER 20  Harmonics
taneous peak value of current is equal to the RMS 
value multiplied by 1.414, if the current waveforms 
are sinusoidal (no harmonic distortion), the formula 
will produce a derating factor of 1.0. Once the derat-
ing factor is determined, multiply the derating factor 
by the kVA capacity of the transformer. The product 
will be the maximum load that should be placed on 
the transformer.
If the phase currents are unequal, find an 
 average value by adding the currents together and 
dividing by 3.

The 200 kVA transformer in this example should 
be derated to 144.4 kVA (200 kVA multiplied 
by 0.722).
 5. Derate or reduce the amount of load on the 
transformer. Harmonic problems generally 
involve overheating of the transformer. In 
many instances, it is necessary to derate the 
transformer to a point that it can handle the 
extra current caused by the harmonic distor-
tion. When this is done, it is generally neces-
sary to add a second transformer and divide 
the load between the two.
 DETERMINING 
TRANSFORMER 
HARMONIC DERATING 
FACTOR
Probably the most practical and straightforward 
method for determining the derating factor for a 
transformer is recommended by the Computer & 
Business Equipment Manufacturers Association. To 
use this method, two ampere measurements must be 
made. One is the true RMS current of the phases, 
and the second is the instantaneous peak phase cur-
rent. The instantaneous peak current can be deter-
mined with an oscilloscope connected to a current 
probe or with an ammeter capable of measuring the 
peak value. Many of the digital clamp-on ammeters 
are capable of measuring the average, true RMS 
and peak values of current. For this example, it will 
be assumed that peak current values are measured 
for the 200 kVA transformer discussed previously. 
These values are added to the previous data obtained 
with the true RMS- and average indicating amme-
ters, Table 20-3. The formula for determining the 
transformer harmonic derating factor (THDF) is
THDF 
(1.414) (RMS phase current)
Instantaneous peak phase current
This formula will produce a derating factor 
somewhere between 0 and 1.0. Because the instan-
