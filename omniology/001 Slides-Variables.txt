Variables
●
A variable is a name for a memory location or address that stores any type of value. 
Variables are how the program remembers values.
Naming conventions:
●
names can contain letters (a-z A-Z), digits (0-9) and the underscore (_)character; if it 
starts with an underscore it has a special meaning;
●
a variable name can’t start with a number, it can only start with underscore or letters;
●
special characters ( :, “$, !?( ){ }[ ] ) are not allowed in variable names
●
variable names can’t be reserved words like: True, False, None, class, if, else, while etc
●
it’s recommended to use words written with lower case letters, separated by underscores 
for example max_value = 999. This is known as snake_case.
●
avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like list, set, str ...
●
Python is case-sensitive (it makes a distinction between lower and upper-case letters), 
and so are variable names;
●
sometimes the camel case notation is used. PEP 8 recommends using the snake_case;
