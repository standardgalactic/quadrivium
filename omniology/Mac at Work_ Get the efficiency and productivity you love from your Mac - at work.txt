Acknowledgments
T
his book is the result of a two-year campaign to document the fact you 
can work on your Mac. I had a lot of help along the way.
A person does not get the gumption to write a book without some 
amazing teachers. I’ve had several, including my mother, Jean Sparks, who stayed 
up many late nights teaching her dense son to read, and Dr. Ronald Peterson, a 
college professor who became a lifelong mentor and friend. 
I would like to thank Wiley Press, particularly Aaron Black, for taking a 
chance on an unpublished author and championing Mac at Work from the 
beginning. Many thanks also go to my capable editorial team, Galen Gruman and 
Carol Person, for their advice and support throughout this journey. This book is 
better as a result of their talents (and patience). I had additional proofreading 
help from Jeanelle Cameron. Thanks also go to E. John Thawley III for my 
photograph. 
Additional thanks for permission to use their photography in this book to 
Apple (Figures 1-1 through 1-6, and portions of Figures 2-5, 2-6, and 20-1) and 
Livescribe (Figure 10-9).
Finally, I want to thank my family (especially Daisy, Samantha, and Sarah), 
friends, the MacPowerUsers.com community (particularly Katie Floyd), and the 
MacSparky.com readers for hanging in there with me while I spent my nights and 
weekends writing 90,000 words.

also created by Apple, integrates seamlessly with the hardware. Everything just 
works. Moreover, there is a rich ecosystem of software developers for the Mac that 
have adopted Apple’s standard of excellence. Mac software isn’t just functional, it 
is magniﬁ cent.
The word is getting out. Macs are showing up in boardrooms, courtrooms, 
ofﬁ ces, and even enterprise networks. The Mac is a serious business tool. So can 
you take advantage of this superior hardware and software to up your game at 
work? Absolutely. I’ve been using my Mac at work for years.
This book is intended as a resource, not an encyclopedia. You are not going 
to learn about every Mac application available for each topic covered. Instead you 
will discover a selected group of applications that work. This is important. I have 
gone down the dark and ugly road of bad software. With this book, you get the 
beneﬁ t of my travels.
You can read this book cover to cover or treat it as a reference. Do you suddenly 
ﬁ nd yourself looking for paperless solutions and not know where to start? Read 
Chapter 19. Need to ﬁ gure out e-mail? Jump to Chapter 5. You get the idea. 
Whether you’ve been using a Mac since 1984 or are simply considering 
switching to a Mac, this book is for you. You’ll learn to work more efﬁ ciently with 
superior results than your unfortunate competitors saddled with Windows PCs. 
This book shows you the way.

Conventions
Throughout this book, I describe how to use the mouse and keyboard 
shortcuts for many of the applications covered. In doing so, I use the following 
terms to explain mouse and keyboard actions.
Mouse Conventions
I’ll be asking you to use your mouse to run your Mac and all the applications 
that help you get work done. When I do, I use the following terms:
 ◗
Click: Most Mac mice have only one button, but some have two or more. 
If you have a multibutton mouse, quickly press and release the leftmost 
mouse button once when I say to click the mouse. (If your mouse has 
only one button, just press and release the button you have.) If you are 
using a MacBook laptop, click the trackpad.
 ◗
Double-click: When I say to double-click, quickly press and release the 
leftmost mouse button twice (if your mouse has only one button, just 
press and release twice the button you have). On some multibutton mice, 
one of the buttons can function as a double-click (you click it once, the 
mouse clicks twice); if your mouse has this feature, use it — it saves strain 
on your hand. You can also double-click a MacBook trackpad.
 ◗
Right-click: Right-clicking means clicking the right-hand mouse button. 
On a Mac’s one-button mouse, hold the Control key when clicking the 
mouse button to achieve the right-click effect. On multibutton Mac mice, 
Mac OS X automatically assigns the righthand button to Control+click. 
On a MacBook’s trackpad, hold the Control key when clicking the 
trackpad. Newer MacBooks can also be configured to right-click by 
tapping the lower right corner of the trackpad or tapping with two fingers.
 ◗
Drag: Dragging is used for moving and sizing items in a document. To 
drag an item, position the mouse pointer on it. Press and hold down 
the mouse button, and then slide the mouse across a flat surface to drag 
the item. Release the mouse button to drop the dragged item in its new 
location. You can also drag using the trackpad in the same fashion.
Menu commands
The commands that you select by using the program menus appear in this 
book in normal typeface. When you choose some menu commands, a related 
pop-up menu appears (these are sometimes called pull-down menus). If I describe a 
situation in which you need to select one menu and then choose a command from 

a secondary menu or list box, I use an arrow symbol. For example, “Choose Edit ➧ 
Paste” means that you should choose the Paste menu option from the Edit menu.
Keyboard conventions
Sometimes, it is easier to invoke a keyboard shortcut than to take your hands 
off the keyboard and drill through menus with the mouse. The following keys are 
typically used in keyboard shortcuts.
 ◗
The Command key, which is indicated on keyboards and program 
menus (and thus in this book) by the symbol J. On older Macs, the 
Command key has an Apple logo (i) on it, while some newer Macs’ 
keyboards use only the label “Command.”
 ◗
The Shift key is displayed in menus by the symbol C.
 ◗
The Option key is displayed in menus by the symbol E.
 ◗
The Control key is displayed in menus with the symbol D.
 ◗
The Tab key is used both to move within fields in panels and dialog 
boxes and to insert the tab character in text. iTunes and many other Mac 
programs indicate it in menus with the symbol A.
 ◗
The Return key is used to apply a dialog box’s settings and close the 
dialog box (equivalent to clicking OK or Done), as well as to insert a hard 
paragraph return in text. In many Mac programs, it is indicated in menus 
by the symbol G. Note that there is another key labeled Enter on some 
keyboards, in the numeric keypad. This keypad Enter (indicated in menus 
by the symbol U) usually works like the regular Return.
 ◗
The Delete key deletes text, one character at a time, to the left of 
the text-insertion point (like the Backspace key on PCs). On the Mac, 
programs like iTunes use the symbol K in menus to indicate Delete. To 
delete forward (to the right of the text-insertion point, like the PC’s Del 
key does), you can use the Delete F key on some Mac keyboards.
If you’re supposed to press several keys at the same time, I indicate that 
by placing plus signs (+) between them. Thus, Control+J+A means press and 
hold the Control key and the Command key, then press the A key. After you’ve 
pressed the A key, let go of all three keys.
I use the plus sign (+) to join keys to mouse movements. For example, 
Option+drag means to hold the Option key while dragging the mouse.
I also provide Web addresses and, sometimes, programming code or text 
you must enter into some dialog box or other program interface. I do that by 
formatting such text in a typewriter-like font like this.

A Tour of 
A Tour of 
the Mac
the Mac
S
o you’ve decided to use a Mac at work. Great decision. Once you get your 
hands on the fantastic Mac-only applications in this book, you are going 
to dazzle your bosses, co-workers, and clients. Now you just need to 
decide which Mac is right for you.
The Mac Family 
There was a time when Apple had so many different Mac models that you 
needed a slide ruler to pick the right one for you. Fortunately, that is no longer 
the case. The current Apple product line is streamlined, with each Mac designed 
to serve a different role. Apple sells both laptop and desktop Macs.
The desktops
If you work at a desk and don’t need the portability of a laptop, you get the 
most bang for your buck with the Mac desktop line. There are three categories of 
desktop Macs: the Mac Pro, the iMac, and the Mac Mini.
The Mac Pro
The  Mac Pro, shown in Figure 1-1, is Apple’s top-of-the-line desktop 
machine. It features an industrial aluminum design and looks like it came off the 
set of a science ﬁ ction movie. Apple let its hardware engineers go nuts with the 
Mac Pro. Every new Mac Pro model gets the latest and fastest processors. The Mac 
Pro has options for the most processing cores and memory of any Mac available.
If you’ve ever worked on the inside of a computer, you will be surprised 
the ﬁ rst time you open a Mac Pro. The inside looks like it was laid out by a very 
small, very skilled city planner. Gone is the usual spaghetti jumble of wires and 
plugs. The Mac Pro is the most upgradable desktop Mac.
But with high-end performance comes a high-end price: The Mac Pro starts 
at $2,499. Once you begin upgrading, that price goes up. You can customize 
your Mac Pro to include faster components — and end up spending more than 
$10,000 on a Mac Pro. You will also need to buy a monitor.
www.ebook777.com

As wonderful and shiny as the Mac Pro is, it is also delicious overkill for most 
of this book’s readers. The Mac Pro is ideal for heavy video editing, 3D graphics, 
intense gaming, and other heavy, processor-draining tasks. If you want to make 

the next Avatar, the Mac Pro is for you. For most mere mortals, however, an iMac 
better suits your desktop needs.
The iMac
The  iMac was the computer that saved Apple (see the sidebar “A Macintosh 
History Lesson”). The current iMac, shown in Figure 1-2, features an aluminum-
and-glass design and is an “all-in-one” computer. It includes the computer, an 
LED monitor, and an optical drive all in one nifty design that is not much bigger 
than a standard ﬂ at-screen monitor. The high-end iMacs pack a lot of punch and 
can do complex computing tasks. Even the lower-end iMacs can handle less-
complex video and photo editing.
Apple has three models of iMacs, ranging from $1,199 to $1,999. The ﬁ rst 
has a 21.5-inch display and the other two have a 27-inch display. Apple lets you 
conﬁ gure the iMac when you buy it at the Apple Store; options include faster 
processors, better graphics, and more memory. Except for adding memory, the 
iMac is difﬁ cult to upgrade, so make sure to get it with the options you’ll want for 
the entire lifetime of the machine. Whatever options you get, note that the entire 
line of iMacs is fully able to run all the software mentioned in this book. 
The Mac Mini
The  Mac Mini, shown in Figure 1-3, is Apple’s least expensive Mac, starting at 
$699. You have to add your own display, keyboard, and mouse. The device itself 
more closely resembles a space-age cigar box than a computer. Although the Mac 
Mini is not as powerful as the iMac or Mac Pro, it can handle typical computing 
tasks, such as word processing, spreadsheets, e-mail, and the Internet with no 
troubles. Mac Mini upgrade options are limited to memory and hard drive. (The 
newest Mac Mini opens from the bottom — much easier!) Apple recommends 
any upgrades or repairs to a Mac Mini be done by an Apple-authorized 
technician.

The laptops
Laptop usage increases every year. Computers have evolved to a point that 
laptops have enough power to satisfy the computing needs of most people. Apple 
has three categories of laptops: the MacBook, MacBook Pro, and MacBook Air.
The MacBook
The  MacBook is Apple’s entry-level laptop. Shown in Figure 1-4, the 
MacBook starts at $999 and features a 13-inch screen. The MacBook is the only 
plastic computer in Apple’s laptop line. Although it is technically the low-end 
Mac, that isn’t a fair description. The MacBook is enough computer for most Mac 
workers. Indeed, much of this book was written on a MacBook.
A MACINTOSH HISTORY LESSON
Once upon a time, people said that if you wanted a computer, you 
needed a multimillion dollar budget and a team of engineers. Then two guys 
named Steve ( Steve Jobs and  Steve Wozniak) started selling the ﬁ rst personal 
computer, the  Apple I. It came in a plywood case.
Next, Apple released the  Apple II and started a revolution. Computers of 
that era ran on the command line using obscure textual codes, which was 
empowering for nerds and bafﬂ ing to everyone else. In 1986, Apple started 
another revolution with the  Macintosh, the ﬁ rst consumer computer with a 
graphical user interface. In other words, it gave us the mouse.
Although the Macintosh changed the world, Apple soon fell on hard 
times and the two Steves left the company. By the early 1990s everyone was 
predicting Apple’s demise.
In 1997 Steve Jobs came back to Apple and kicked off a reboot of the 
company, including the release of the iMac. The company is now more 
successful than ever with Macs, iPhones, iPods, and iPads. The Mac’s market 
share is on an upward march. Indeed, the Mac is now entrenched at work.

The MacBook Pro
The  MacBook Pro line starts at $1,199 and includes three aluminum-and-
glass notebooks in 13-, 15-, and 17-inch varieties. The MacBook Pro, shown in 
Figure 1-5, is carved out of a single piece of aluminum and is thus extremely 
rigid. The MacBook Pro also includes better video performance for video editing, 
3D gaming, graphics, and advanced photo editing. As with the MacBook, the 
memory and disk storage are both user-upgradable in the MacBook Pro.
The MacBook Air
The  MacBook Air series, shown in Figure 1-6, starts at $999 and is the 
ultimate traveling Mac: One model weighs just 2.3 pounds and the other 2.9 
pounds. With its slim design and light weight, a MacBook Air takes very little 
space in your bag. But to get this small size, the MacBook Air has performance 
compromises and so is not as powerful as the MacBook or MacBook Pro. 
The MacBook Air’s thinness also creates physical compromises: Not all USB 
cables can plug into their USB ports due to the cramped space around them, and 
www.ebook777.com

the MacBook Air requires a separate adapter for an Ethernet cable (a big issue for 
older models that had just one USB port). For basic computing tasks — e-mail, 
Internet, word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations — the MacBook Air can 
do the job. If you are planning to do video editing, however, move along. Nothing 
in the MacBook Air can be upgraded, so be sure to order enough RAM and storage.
Which Mac is right for you?
Picking the right Mac depends on your particular needs. Do you want the 
mobility of a laptop or the luxury of a 27-inch iMac screen? Do you revel in 
owning the fastest, screamingest computer money can buy, or do you want the 
least-expensive machine to satisfy your needs. The best way to decide is to get 
your hands on a few Macs and ﬁ gure out what model ﬁ ts you the best.
Although this book is about the Macintosh, I’d be remiss not to mention that 
Apple has a few other products that complement your Mac. The iPhone, iPad, 
and iPod Touch all synchronize with your Mac and, to a limited extent, become 
an extension of your computer. You can learn more about your Mac and mobile 
devices in Chapter 7. 
Installing, Removing, and Updating 
Applications
This book covers a lot of Mac OS X applications. So let’s review installing, 
removing, and updating applications on the Mac.
Installing applications 
Mac applications install from  disk image (.dmg) ﬁ les. Sometimes, Mac 
OS X developers compress the installation ﬁ les into a  Zip compression package. 
The Zip ﬁ le needs to be decompressed to get the disk image ﬁ le. To do that, just 
double-click the Zip ﬁ le, and Mac OS X will extract the disk image ﬁ le.
Once you have the disk image ﬁ le, you are ready to install the application. 
There are two ways to install software from a disk image: an installation bundle 
and a Mac OS X  installer. 
Installers are the easiest. You double-click the installer icon and the installer 
walks you through each step of the process. When completed, the application and 
its supporting ﬁ les are all where they need to be. Installers are normally used by 
more complicated applications, such as Adobe Creative Suite.
Most Mac OS X applications don’t have a full installer but instead use 
application bundles. The bundle opens a Finder window or folder that contains 
the application ﬁ le. Quite often, as shown in Figure 1-7, the application 

automatically opens a Finder window. Regardless, you then copy the application 
to its desired location, which is almost always the Applications folder.
Once the application is where it belongs, you can eject the disk image using the 
Eject icon next to the disk name in the Finder’s Sidebar. You can also eject an image 
by clicking the disk image and pressing J+E or dragging the disk image to the Trash. 
Ejecting the image after installation is important: Novice users usually don’t 
realize they need to put the new application in their Applications folder, and 
so they instead run the application from the mounted disk image. Doing so is 
dangerous: You can’t always count on the disk image being there, and it may 
cause problems with the application’s data ﬁ les.
If you want your application to remain in the  Dock, that quick-access bar 
at the bottom of the screen, you can drag it there from the Application folder or 
Control+click or right-click the icon in the Dock while the application is running 
and choose Options ➧ Keep in Dock, as shown in Figure 1-8.
Removing Mac OS X applications
Mac OS X does not have a dedicated application uninstaller. This often 
surprises Windows switchers, but the reason for its omission is simple: It is not 
www.ebook777.com

necessary. To remove most Mac OS X applications, you just drag them to the 
Trash. (Some applications — typically those installed via an installer — come 
with an uninstaller app; use that if it exists.)
Some developers have released applications that clean up after deleted 
applications by tracking down and deleting their support ﬁ les. AppZapper ($13;

Mac OS X periodically checks for you and reports when there are updates. You 
should always apply security updates as soon as they become available. With other 
updates, wait a few days until after Apple releases them before installing. Why? 
Because these upgrades are tested only with a limited number of users and so 
sometimes include glitches. You are better off letting someone else ﬁ nd out ﬁ rst. 
Most software applications periodically check to see if there are updates for those 
applications. When   updates exist, they prompt you to download and install them.
File Management 
Moving ﬁ les around Mac OS X follows the same user interface paradigms 
found in the ﬁ rst Macintosh. Indeed, if you could teleport a 1984 Mac user to the 
present, he would have no trouble copying ﬁ les. In Mac OS X, ﬁ les are objects 
that can be moved or copied between folders and disks, as well as to and from 
the  Desktop. Mac OS X automatically creates folders in your  user folder for the 
most common ﬁ le types, such as Documents, Music, Pictures, and Movies. If the 
 Finder is too constraining for you,  PathFinder ($40; www.cocoatech.com) is a 
powerful replacement.
One change to Mac OS X that a 1984 time traveler would appreciate is the 
addition of  Spotlight. Spotlight is a systemwide search that indexes your ﬁ les and 
data. Whether you are looking up an Address Book entry, an e-mail you received 
last week, or a draft sales proposal, you can usually ﬁ nd it by typing the name 
in the Spotlight search bar and pressing Return or clicking the Spotlight iconic 
button (the magnifying glass icon) at the top-right corner of your screen. The 
point of Spotlight is to help you avoid having to drill through Finder windows — 
and it usually works. 
Spotlight also is an excellent application launcher. If you type the ﬁ rst few 
letters of an application, Spotlight ﬁ nds it; you can then launch it by pressing 
Return. To perform this magic, Mac OS X automatically indexes every ﬁ le you 
save. Address Book, for example, adds each contact’s name to the Spotlight index. 
Some applications, such as Default Folder X (covered in Chapter 3), let you add 
additional terms to the Spotlight index. You can manually add terms to a ﬁ le’s 
Spotlight index in the ﬁ le’s  Info window (displayed by selecting the ﬁ le and 
pressing J+I).
Maintenance and Troubleshooting
One of the biggest challenges for Windows users switching to Mac OS X 
is accepting the fact there simply isn’t much maintenance on a Mac. There are, 
however, some basic maintenance and troubleshooting tools worthy of a mention.

Basic maintenance
Mac OS X has three built-in  scripts that run on a daily, weekly, and monthly 
basis. These scripts clean out system ﬁ les and preferences so Mac OS X runs 
optimally. Most users aren’t even aware they exist. 
The operating system is supposed to run these scripts in the background, 
usually in periods of low activity, quite often in the middle of the night, if your 
Mac is on then. If you have a laptop or a Mac that is frequently turned off, there is 
a possibility your Mac will not run these scripts as often as it should. 
You can check these ﬁ les on your own Mac by looking at the script logs to 
determine the last time they were modiﬁ ed. You do this by choosing Go ➧ Go 
to Folder in the Finder and typing in /var/log/. Once in this folder, you can 
select the daily.out, weekly.out, and monthly.out ﬁ les and open an Info 
window (select the ﬁ le and press J+I). When looking at the ﬁ le information, the 
date last modiﬁ ed tells you the last time the script ran.
If your are not running on the usual daily, weekly, and monthly routines, it is 
not the end of the world. Your Mac won’t implode and cats won’t start living with 
dogs. Just leave your Mac on overnight. You can also manually run these scripts a 
variety of ways. My favorite method is using the application  Maintenance (www.
titanium.free.fr). Maintenance is a free application, although a donation 
is requested by the developer. (There are many such useful “ donationware” 
applications for Mac OS X.)
Maintenance, shown in Figure 1-9, allows you to perform several functions 
on your Mac, including manually running the Mac OS X daily, weekly, and 
monthly scripts. Maintenance can perform other useful Mac maintenance tasks:  
 ◗
Repair permissions: Mac OS X assigns  access privileges, known as 
permissions, to applications, folders, and files. The operating system 
manages these permissions automatically, but occasionally the permissions 
www.ebook777.com

get corrupted. (Corruption was more of a problem with earlier versions 
of Mac OS X than it is today.) Errors in the permissions can manifest 
themselves in several ways, from slowing down your Mac to prohibiting 
certain applications from starting. In addition to repairing permissions in 
Maintenance, you can also repair permissions using Apple’s  Disk Utility. 
Repairing permissions is not a normal maintenance issue but can be used 
to troubleshoot odd behavior. It is also a good idea to repair permissions 
before doing any major software or operating system upgrade. 
 ◗
Cache cleaning:  Caches are files containing commonly used system 
resources. For example, the browser caches files from your most frequently 
visited Web sites. When you return to a site, your browser does not have 
to re-download every file associated with that site; it loads them from the 
cache and then downloads only changed or new elements for that site. 
Mac OS X creates caches for system files, applications, and font files. It is a 
common myth that cleaning cache files is necessary maintenance in Mac 
OS X. This is not true. Cleaning out the cache files usually slows down your 
Mac. When you delete them, Mac OS X must then go through the time-
consuming act of rebuilding them. (Your Mac created those cache files 
for a reason.) Although not necessary for maintenance, cleaning caches 
is appropriate when experiencing problems. Cleaning the font cache, for 
example, often solves text-related problems.
 ◗
Launch Services directory:  Launch Services is the directory that 
tracks the available applications for the Open With contextual menu 
option when you Control+click or right-click on a file. If you find you are 
getting multiple instances of applications in this menu option, use this 
command to rebuild the directory and remove the duplicate entries.
 ◗
Spotlight index: The  Spotlight index is Mac OS X’s index of your files 
and directories. Rebuilding the index should only be necessary when you 
detect corruption with your Spotlight searches.
To get at deeper level system repair, try Onyx (donation requested; www.
titanium.free.fr), by the developers of Maintenance. But beware when 
using Onyx:  It can modify essential system ﬁ les, so if used improperly, Onyx 
could destroy data and harm your Mac. Make sure you know what you are doing 
before you start pushing buttons — and always back up ﬁ rst (see Chapter 2).
Disk  defragmentation
Hard disks don’t usually keep ﬁ les together. When you write a ﬁ le to the disk, 
it takes blank space wherever it may ﬁ nd it; thus, large ﬁ les may be split up into 
multiple pieces. It is like reading a book where you are required to turn forward 
20 pages, then back 30 pages, to continue. When ﬁ les get heavily fragmented, the 

disk has to work harder to read them by jumping to multiple locations, which 
slows performance. 
Windows switchers to Mac OS X often look for defragmentation tools. 
Mac OS X, however, performs its own defragmentation, so user interference 
is generally not necessary. I don’t defrag my Mac hard disks. In fact, the few 
times I’ve bothered to defrag a Mac OS X hard disk, I’ve never experienced any 
noticeable improvement in performance. 
The exception is if you work with a lot of large ﬁ les or routinely keep your 
disk nearly full. In that case,  iDefrag ($30; www.coriolis-systems.com/
idefrag) is a good tool. Before defragmenting your disk, however, make certain 
to back up everything.
Getting help
One advantage to buying Apple hardware is the company’s excellent customer 
support. So many Mac workers have had such bad experience with computer repair 
with other computers that they sometimes overlook this advantage. 
If you are having trouble with your Mac, take it into your local  Apple Store 
or call Apple and send it in. Note, however, that Apple does not generally offer 
priority service. Moreover, Apple does not offer same-day service for  repairs at the 
ofﬁ ce like some PC manufacturers do. So you could experience longer downtimes 
when you need upgrades and repairs.

Backing Up
Backing Up
E
ven more valuable than your shiny Mac hardware is the  data you create 
on it. At any time, your Mac may contain that vital customer list or the last 
three months’ sales ﬁ gures. Although a computer can always be replaced, 
critical data cannot. In this chapter, you will learn about the most common 
backup tools and recommended backup plans.
Why  Back Up?
Your computer data is important, and your hard disk is going to fail. 
Hopefully that failure will be sometime after you are done with your computer 
but oftentimes it is not. The trouble is, you don’t know when that failure is going 
to take place. Most disks are sold with one-, three-, or ﬁ ve-year warranties, but 
those are just estimates. The only thing certain is that your disk will fail sometime 
between the next few years and the next few seconds. You can survive this 
inevitable disk failure with a reliable backup plan.
Apple’s Backup Tools
The reason so few computer users historically have had a backup plan 
is because, until recently, backing up was hard. The software was cryptic and 
unfriendly. Worse yet, there was no simple way to test your backup to know if 
it even worked. People didn’t trust their backup, so they didn’t bother. Apple 
provides several products to address these difﬁ culties, including a simple and 
reliable backup system that comes free with Mac OS X:  Time Machine.
Time Machine
Starting with Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Apple built a painless and reliable 
backup plan into every Mac. The ﬁ rst time you plug an external hard disk into 
your Mac, Time Machine asks if you want to make it your backup disk. With one 
click, Time Machine formats the external disk and begins backing up the full 
contents of your Mac; Figure 2-1 shows the Time Machine settings dialog box.
www.ebook777.com

After initiating a Time Machine backup, you don’t need to adjust another 
setting. The ﬁ rst backup takes several hours because it is copying everything on 
your Mac to the backup disk. After the initial backup, Time Machine backs up just 
new and changed ﬁ les every hour, which usually takes just a few minutes. If your 
disk fails, you use Time Machine to restore your replacement disk.

In addition to worry-free backups, Time Machine also keeps versions of your 
ﬁ les. This allows you to restore older ﬁ les that were later modiﬁ ed. So, using Time 
Machine, you can recover an older version of your sales proposal that you hacked 
to pieces six hours ago in a caffeine-induced haze of overzealous editing. 
To recover your ﬁ les from Time Machine, navigate to the folder containing 
your now emasculated proposal and activate Time Machine. This opens the Time 
Machine recovery interface, shown in Figure 2-2. You can then scroll back in time 
using the time bar at the far right (here, by six hours), select your ﬁ le, and click 
Restore. Time Machine replaces your current version with the older one and you 
can pick up where you left off. You can use the same technique to recover ﬁ les 
you deleted, even if you emptied the Trash in the meantime.
The biggest advantage of Time Machine is that it takes zero user 
conﬁ guration. You plug it in and it just works. If, however, you want to customize 
your Time Machine, you can. The Time Machine system preference has an 
option that allows you to exclude (or add) data to the backup list. Also, if the 
hourly backup is overkill, you can run the free  TimeMachineScheduler (free; 
www.klieme.com) utility, which allows you to adjust the backup frequency to 
between one and 12 hours.
Restoring files with  Time Machine
Restoring from a Time Machine backup is simple. After installing a new 
startup disk on your Mac (such as to replace a failed one or to simply use a larger 
disk in place of the original one), you have to reinstall Mac OS X. The installer 
will ask if you have a Time Machine backup; if you do, it is just a matter of 
plugging in the Time Machine disk and letting the installer do the work. Do note 
that depending on the size of your disk, the entire process takes a few hours — 
but you don’t have to reinstall anything manually this way. 
External disks and Time Machine
Time Machine backs up externally connected disks, not just your Mac’s 
internal disk. For example, if your work ﬁ les are on an external disk and then you 
add a second external backup disk, Time Machine will back up both the internal 
and the external disks. Just make sure your Time Machine disk is large enough to 
accommodate both the internal and the external disks. For example, if you have a 
250GB internal disk and 250GB external disk, you should have a backup disk of 
at least 1TB — double the capacity of the disks you’re backing up. 
However, Time Machine only works for disks physically connected to your 
Mac. If you have data on a network disk not physically connected to your Mac, 
Time Machine will not back it up.

Time Capsule
Time Machine is a fantastic backup system; it solves the simplicity and 
reliability problems that have prevented users from backing up in the past. 
However, laptop owners often forget to stop and plug in their external Time 
Machine disk. If you don’t plug the disk into your laptop, the backup doesn’t 
happen and so your data is at risk.
Apple has a wireless solution:  Time Capsule (www.apple.com/
timecapsule), a wireless router with a built-in hard disk. Once the Time 
Capsule is on your network, Time Machine recognizes it and offers to wirelessly 
back up to it. Because the backup is done over a wireless connection, you don’t 
have to remember to plug the backup disk into your laptop. Apple sells 1TB 
and 2TB versions of the Time Capsule for $299 and $499, respectively. Because 
multiple Macs can back up to a single Time Capsule, it is an excellent low-cost 
backup solution for a small ofﬁ ce running several Macs.
However, do note that wireless backup speeds are signiﬁ cantly slower than 
a directly connected USB or FireWire hard disk. If you are using a Time Capsule, 
WHICH HARD DISK FOR  TIME MACHINE?
When choosing an external disk for your Time Machine backup, there are 
two considerations to note: capacity and connection type.
Because Time Machine keeps multiple versions of your data, the backup 
disk needs to hold more information than the disk in your Mac. A good 
rule of thumb is to get a disk at least two times the capacity of your Mac’s 
internal disk.
The two primary external hard disk connection types are USB and 
FireWire. 
USB: Universal Serial Bus (USB) is the most common hard disk connector 
and can be found on every currently shipping Mac. Some USB disks are bus-
powered, which lets them run without being plugged into the wall. USB disks 
are generally cheaper but usually a bit slower than FireWire disks. 
FireWire: FireWire disks come in two ﬂ avors: 400 and 800 Mbps 
(megabits per second), and each has a different style of port. Currently 
shipping Mac Pros, iMacs, and MacBook Pros support FireWire 800 ports 
only, but older Macs have FireWire 400 ports. (There are adapters that let you 
connect FireWire 400 disks to FireWire 800 ports and vice versa.) For several 
technical reasons, FireWire disks are generally faster, but they are also more 
expensive than USB disks of the same capacity. A faster disk is useful for 
speedier backups, but not essential. 
Both USB and FireWire are adequate for Time Machine backups. If you 
can afford FireWire disks, you’ll ﬁ nd that they not only back up faster but 
also don’t slow your Mac down during backup as the use of USB disks can.

make sure your backups are completed before closing the lid on your MacBook and 
running out the door; otherwise, you may lose important data. You can tell that the 
backup is ﬁ nished when the Time Machine icon in your menu bar stops spinning.
Cloning Your Mac
Another backup solution involves making a copy of your internal hard disk, 
often called  cloning. A cloned disk is an exact copy of your internal disk, so if your 
internal disk fails, you can boot from your cloned disk (just press and hold the 
Option key during startup to get a choice of startup disks connected to your Mac, 
and then click the desired disk; in this case, the clone) and have immediate access 
to your backed-up data and ﬁ les. If your internal hard disk crashes, you can be 
up and running from the cloned disk in ﬁ ve minutes or so. Another beneﬁ t of 
a clone is that you can easily browse the contents of the backup without having 
to load separate software. A cloned disk can be plugged into any Mac and easily 
browsed through the Finder.
Because it is an exact copy of your internal disk, a clone does not contain 
prior versions of your data, as a Time Machine backup does. So a cloned disk is 
best suited as a safety copy of your Mac startup disk, such as before upgrading 
the OS or installing security or encryption software that can sometimes make a 
disk unusable. A cloned disk lets you continue working in your old conﬁ guration 
while you ﬁ gure out what went wrong on your upgraded or secured original disk 
— or decide to replace that corrupted original disk’s contents with the clone disk’s 
backup. Of course, you can use a Time Machine backup for the same purpose.
One of the best cloning tools for the Mac is  SuperDuper ($28; www.shirt-
pocket.com). SuperDuper simpliﬁ es the process of cloning your Mac. It can 
be conﬁ gured so you just plug in your external disk and the application does the 
rest. SuperDuper also includes a built-in scheduler, shown in Figure 2-3, which 
allows you to automatically clone your hard disk every day at a convenient time. 
www.ebook777.com

One strategy many Mac workers use is to run an hourly Time Machine backup 
of their Mac throughout the day and script SuperDuper to make a clone on a 
separate backup disk once a day in the middle of the night.
Although cloned disks are a terriﬁ c backup solution, you must be careful 
when you are experiencing computer problems. When you clone a disk, you 
make an exact duplicate of the existing data. If your Mac’s internal hard disk 
is corrupted, those corruptions are copied onto the clone disk. Although it is 
usually a good idea to immediately back up if you begin having trouble with your 
Mac, backing up with a clone disk may replace a prior uncorrupted version of 
your data with a new corrupted version. For this reason, if you are using a cloned 
backup strategy and your Mac is out of sorts, make your emergency clone backup 
to a separate disk and keep your prior, uncorrupted version intact.
File-Specific Backup
If you just want to back up speciﬁ c folders or groups of data, use 
ChronoSync, from Econ Technologies ($40; www.econtechnologies.com). 
ChronoSync lets you designate particular folders and ﬁ les for backup. It looks 
at any source available in the Finder, including ﬁ les and disks on your network, and 
copies the ﬁ les to any location you designate. It can both back up and synchronize 
DISK STATUS AND RECOVERY
Although your hard disk can  fail without any warning, there is a protocol 
to check the status of your disk called S.M.A.R.T., which stands for Self-
Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology. This can sometimes give you 
the advance warning you need to prevent disaster.
You can check the  S.M.A.R.T. status of your disk in Mac OS X’s built in 
Disk Utility. S.M.A.R.T. is used to ﬁ nd predictable disk failures that result from 
mechanical wear and degradation of the disk. If S.M.A.R.T. reports a problem 
with your disk, back it up immediately and then replace it soon. S.M.A.R.T., 
however, is not perfect and will not predict all disk failures. Disks are always 
subject to unpredictable failures.
If you experience a disk failure and have no backup, get your Mac to an 
authorized technician. There are several “Hail Mary” techniques, including 
putting the disk in the freezer, they can try. If an authorized repairperson 
can’t help, you can submit the disk to a  disk recovery company, such as  Disk 
Savers (www.disksaversdatarecovery.com). Disk recovery services 
cannot always deliver, and when they do they can cost hundreds and even 
thousands of dollars to recover the disk’s data. You are much better served 
putting your own backup system in place so when a disk goes bad, you can 
discard it and move to a backed-up copy.

data, and it includes scripting and scheduling components. For example, if you 
want to just back up your budgeting and spreadsheet ﬁ les to a network disk every 
six hours, ChronoSync can do so automatically. As shown in Figure 2-4, with a little 
tinkering, you can set up an automated network backup system.
The only limitation of ChronoSync is that it only sees the ﬁ les and disks 
mounted on your Mac or on your local network. Using  ExpanDisk ($20; www.
expandisk.com/mac), you can mount Internet-based storage, such as Amazon.
com’s cloud -based S3 storage, to your Mac as if it were a local disk. 
Network Data  Backup
A networked Mac ofﬁ ce also requires reliable backup. Most network storage 
products include their own backup systems. Some of the most common devices 
are  RAID 1 backup drives, available from many vendors, and  Drobo from Data 
Robotics.
A RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) Level 1 drive is an external 
hard drive that includes at least two hard disks. The disks are formatted to make 
two copies of all data. RAID disks can be connected to the network server. When 
choosing a RAID 1 drive, make sure it includes hard disks with network-class 
warranties (usually ﬁ ve years) and an idiot-proof system, like a red light, for 
notifying you when the disk fails. 
www.ebook777.com

Not all RAID is created equal. Make sure your backup RAID disk is 
conﬁ gured as RAID 1. A  RAID 0 conﬁ guration, for example, is very fast but 
provides no backup whatsoever.
Another popular tool for Mac workers is the Data Robotics  Drobo drive. 
Drobo (www.drobo.com) is an external disk enclosure that holds between four 
and eight hard disks. Like a RAID 1 drive, the Drobo makes an extra copy of all 
the data you throw at it. One of Drobo’s primary beneﬁ ts is that, unlike a RAID 1 
disk, Drobo does not require matched disks; you can ﬁ ll a four-bay Drobo with 
disks of different capacities. When you start running out of space, the light next 
to the smallest disk turns yellow; you then pull out that disk and replace it with a 
bigger one and Drobo does the rest.
Online  Backup
There are several online services useful for backing up key ﬁ les. Two of 
the most popular for Mac workers are Apple’s  MobileMe (www.apple.com/
mobileme) and  Dropbox (www.dropbox.com). Although the primary selling 
point of these services is the ability to share ﬁ les among multiple computers 
(these services are featured in Chapter 21), they also offer an efﬁ cient method for 
offsite backup of your critical ﬁ les.
Both services offer the ability to create a virtual, cloud-based storage disk 
on your Mac. Dropbox always keeps a local copy on your internal disk and the 
cloud-based copy. MobileMe also allows you to keep a local copy of the data. 
Before leaving town or after hitting a key milestone, drag a copy of your ﬁ le to 
this virtual disk. The service does the rest, copying it to the Internet and tucking it 
away safely in your account. If you later lose your local copy, you simply log on to 
your MobileMe or Dropbox account and download the saved copy.
Dropbox offers a free 2GB account, but for $100 a year, you can increase the 
online storage to 50GB (or 100GB for $200 per year). If you are running a small 
ofﬁ ce, Dropbox could be used as a cloud-based server storage site. Dropbox also 
keeps versions of your ﬁ les much like Time Machine so you may restore older 
versions of your ﬁ les. MobileMe costs $99 per year for 20GB of storage, though that 
amount includes any e-mail you send and receive via a MobileMe e-mail address. 
Offsite  Backup Services
There are also several companies offering Mac users more systematic online 
backup services. Two of the most popular are  Mozy (www.mozy.com) and 
Backblaze (www.backblaze.com). With these services, you pay a monthly 
$5 fee and designate certain portions of your hard disk for backup. The service 
software installed on your internal disk sends your data through your Internet 

connection to the backup company’s data servers. If your ofﬁ ce burns down or 
there is a burglary, your data is preserved safely offsite. 
Offsite backup technology is emerging and there are some issues to consider 
before jumping in.
Privacy and security
Make sure the service has a privacy policy that keeps your data secure and 
private. The better services will allow you to encrypt the data with your own 
password before uploading it. 
Backup speed
The amount of time it takes to make a signiﬁ cant upload to an online backup 
service is not measured in minutes or hours, but days and weeks. Be prepared. 
Some services, such as Backblaze and Mozy, install an application on your Mac 
that trickles the data up to the online storage in the background. Backblaze even 
allow you to change the amount of system and bandwidth resources devoted to 
the upload so you can throttle it up during slow periods.
Download speeds are also slow when recovering ﬁ les from an online backup. 
Some services compensate for this speed by offering to send your data on an 
optical media or a portable hard disk for an additional fee. Of course, if you get 
your data back by mail or download, you will not have immediate access to it.
Backup Strategies Compared 
Each strategy is summarized in Table 2-1. As you can see there are good and 
bad points for each backup system. There is no single best solution. Indeed if you 
pick just one solution, you are making a mistake.
Backup redundancy
Keeping your data backed up to just one place is dangerous. Backup disks 
and media, by their very nature, are not used often and you don’t want to wait 
until after your hard disk fails to discover your backup is corrupt. Likewise, in the 
event of a disaster or theft, quite often the backup disks are also lost. For critical 
data, one backup simply is not enough. The best backup systems are redundant 
with copies of the data at different locations.
External hard disks are a cheap and a fast alternative for offsite backup 
— just be sure to store the disks offsite! Using backup applications, such as 
SuperDuper or  ChronoSync, you can automate the process of making an 
external backup of your Macs or server attached RAID disks on a regular basis. 
The most recent version of SuperDuper can automatically start the application, 
www.ebook777.com

mount the backup disk, make the backup, and then dismount the disk without 
ever requiring you to touch the keyboard. If you don’t want to buy another hard 
disk, you can also make offsite backups with optical media, such as recordable 
CDs and DVDs.
Sample backup plans
Having surveyed the most common backup solutions and understanding the 
importance of redundancy, here are some sample backup plans.
TEST YOUR BACKUPS
No matter how you go about making backups, it is important to routinely 
test them to verify the data was copied and is available to be restored. How 
you test your backups depends on their format.
Time Machine: Testing your Time Machine backup just requires opening 
the Time Machine application and browsing the ﬁ les to make sure everything 
works. If your Mac is out of commission, you can restore from or browse the 
Time Machine backup from a new installation of Mac OS X. You can also 
access your Time Machine  backup from a different Mac. To do so, connect 
your Time Machine disk to the other Mac and while holding down the Option 
key, click the Time Machine menu bar icon and choose Browse Other Time 
Machine Disks. Your Time Machine backup should then appear.
Cloned hard disks: You can test your cloned disk by plugging it into your 
Mac and exploring it using the Finder. If your cloned disks spend a lot of 
time on the shelf, it is important to routinely make sure they still work. Hard 
disks at rest often remain at rest — permanently.
Optical media: There are a lot of opinions about exactly how long a DVD 
or CD will retain the data written to it before “bit rot” corrupts the data. 
Rather than push the envelope with your important data, you should copy 
the data to new discs every few years. 

The home office’s backup plan
This backup plan is for a Mac worker who runs a consulting business from 
her home. She has an iMac at her desk and a MacBook for the road. The data 
on both Macs is usually the same, but she wants to have multiple backups. 
Her backup gear includes a 1TB external FireWire disk, a 320GB USB-powered 
portable external disk, and a 500GB external hard disk. Her backup plan covers 
both Macs.
First, she attaches the 1TB FireWire disk to the iMac. She splits it into 320GB 
and 680GB partitions. The ﬁ rst partition is assigned to a SuperDuper mirror 
backup that runs every day at 2:00 a.m. The second partition holds the Time 
Machine backup. (Ideally, of course, she would have the Time Machine and 
SuperDuper backups on separate physical disks.)
She uses the 320GB portable USB disk to back up her MacBook with Time 
Machine. She keeps this disk in a drawer and attaches it to her MacBook every few 
nights. This way, if she loses her MacBook, she doesn’t lose the backup.
Because she is the cautious type, she also runs a ChronoSync script on the 
external 500GB disk every few weeks. This disk does not get a clone or Time 
Machine backup. Instead, it holds essential work ﬁ les, archives, and work in

SuperDuper)

progress. She also backs up her personal music, pictures, and video. Once this 
backup is made, she leaves it with her brother, who keeps it in his closet. This is 
her offsite backup.
For the really important ﬁ les, she also uses her MobileMe account to copy 
ﬁ les to her iDisk. In the event all her computers simultaneously combust, she can 
still access those ﬁ les from the Apple servers.
Using this plan, illustrated in Figure 2-5, her key ﬁ les are located on her iMac, 
her MacBook, two different  Time Machine backups, a SuperDuper backup, on 
the MobileMe servers, and in her brother’s closet. With very little effort, this Mac 
worker has a complete backup system.
The Mac office’s backup plan
In this example, there is a small ofﬁ ce running a Mac network. There are 
ﬁ ve Macs — a variety of iMacs and MacBook Pros. All the Macs are networked 
through an Apple  Xserve server (which Apple stopped selling in early 2011 in 
favor of the Mac Pro and the Mac Mini running Snow Leopard Server). The users 
have little involvement with the backup plan. All ﬁ les stored on the network 
server are located on a RAID 1 storage drive. Everything attached to the network is 
backed up. Furthermore, every other night, the server copies the  RAID 1 data to a 
series of external hard disks that are rotated and kept offsite.
The ofﬁ ce also runs a script that synchronizes key ﬁ nancial and client ﬁ les 
to a paid  Dropbox account, providing immediate cloud-based access to key ﬁ les 
from anywhere. Finally, even though employees are supposed to keep all their 
data on the Xserve RAID disk, there is a 2TB  Time Capsule in the ofﬁ ce that 
wirelessly backs up the Macs’ internal hard disks for any data that does not get to 
the server. This backup plan is illustrated in Figure 2-6.
For a backup plan to be successful, it needs to be both easy and redundant. 
This is why Apple’s inclusion of Time Machine was one of the single best 
improvements to Mac OS X. Using the tools described in this chapter, you should 
have no trouble developing your own solutions and backing up.

Useful  Utilities
Utilities
A
pple is conservative about adding features to Mac OS X. But, when 
Apple ﬁ nally does add a feature to the operating system, it is designed 
to be easy to understand and use. Time Machine (covered in Chapter 2) 
is a good example: To back up your Mac, you plug in an external drive and click 
one button. Sometimes, however, you need tools that go a bit deeper. As a result, 
there are several third-party utilities that are too geeky for conservative Apple but 
just the thing to help power users work faster and more efﬁ ciently. Although these 
utilities don’t ﬁ t in any speciﬁ c chapter of this book, they are all useful to Mac 
workers. So they get their own chapter — this one!
TextExpander
Typing is a drag, especially when you ﬁ nd yourself typing the same bits of 
text over and over again. TextExpander ($35; www.smilesoftware.com/
textexpander) handles such repeated typing for you. Shown in Figure 3-1, 
TextExpander lets you create extended text entries (called snippets) that are 
automatically created when you type a predeﬁ ned key combination. 
For example, when you type the letters HmAdd, TextExpander could replace 
the letters with your home address. HmAdd is one of my snippets, along with 
WorkAdd, Cell#, and Office#. The idea is simple: Any bit of text you type 
repeatedly gets a keyword and, in the future, typing that keyword instructs 
TextExpander to do the typing for you. Creating new snippets is easy in 
TextExpander, as shown in Figure 3-2.
The Content ﬁ eld holds the text that you want TextExpander to type for you. 
You can make the snippet plain or formatted text. You can also make the snippet 
AppleScript code or a shell script. I always get a certain amount of pleasure typing 
long bits of text into the Content ﬁ eld knowing I will never have to type that text 
again. 
The Label ﬁ eld lets you identify the snippet and the Abbreviation is the 
keyword that TextExpander will look for, like HmAdd, to autoﬁ ll the snippet. 
You can optionally organize your snippets into groups. I recommend you do so 
because you will quickly amass a lot of them, and organization helps.
www.ebook777.com

You can create snippets for any kind of text. An advertising executive might 
have snippets for a market research report. I have snippets that create contract text 
and legal documents. Use your imagination: A snippet can be a four-letter word 
with foreign characters or a 20-page specimen sales report.
TextExpander lets you specify the position of the cursor in your completed 
snippet. This is useful if you want to place the cursor in the middle of an 
expanded snippet. There is also form support, which allows you to embed blank 
ﬁ elds in a snippet and ﬁ ll them in later.
TextExpander really proves its usefulness when you’re working with e-mail. 
If you repeatedly type the same e-mail messages, it is easy to automate the 
process with snippets. Customer service and support e-mails, for example, lend 

themselves to TextExpander automation. I know of one company that answers 90 
percent of its customer e-mail from a list of TextExpander snippets.
TextExpander can also replace your e-mail client’s signature support. The 
problem with most e-mail clients is that they blindly add the same signature to 
every e-mail from a given account. Some e-mails, however, don’t need your full 
e-mail signature, so you have to later delete or modify the signature. Instead, 
disable your e-mail client’s signature support and use TextExpander. I have 
three professional signatures that can each be triggered as a snippet at the end 
of e-mails. You can also create signatures appropriate for business associates, 
vendors, customers, family, and friends and then selectively apply the snipped to 
any e-mail.
You can organize snippets in folders keeping groups of snippets (such as 
e-mail, billing, and report text). TextExpander offers several predeﬁ ned snippet 
groups that you can add to your snippet library. Just choose File ➧ Add Predeﬁ ned 
Group and then choose the group you want to add.
Predeﬁ ned groups include  spelling-correction snippets that automatically 
ﬁ x common misspellings. For example, freind will be replaced with friend. 
There is also an  accented-words snippet group that will turn cafe’ into café 
and a symbol snippet group that will change text into common symbols, such 
as iinfinity into ∞. (The double ii in iinfinity lets you type the word 
inﬁ nity without triggering the snippet.)
If you are a Web programmer, there are CSS and HTML snippet groups that 
will create automatic CSS and HTML  markup styling for Web pages. Typing 
h1, for example, expands to h1 { }, with the cursor positioned between the 
brackets.
TextExpander also has the ability to automatically enter dates and times in 
a format that you choose. Setting up an automatic date or time entry, shown in 
Figure 3-3, is not difﬁ cult. I have a snippet that creates a date and time string 
that I can add to any document when recording an entry. This snippet, shown in 
Figure 3-3, is activated by typing .dts and produces an entry that looks like this: 
2010-12-18 11:01:50.
Your snippet library can be synced with all your Macs using the  MobileMe 
or  Dropbox syncing services (both are covered in Chapter 21). There are also 
TextExpander  iPhone and  iPad applications that let you use your snippet library 
on your mobile devices. You can share your snippet library between a Windows 
PC and your Mac using Dropbox and a Windows application,  Breevy ($30; 
www.16software.com/breevy). 
TextExpander even keeps track of how much time you’ve saved by using 
snippets instead of typing. As I write this sentence, TextExpander has typed 3,415 
www.ebook777.com

snippets totaling 201,253 characters and saved me eight hours of typing in the 
last nine months. 
Default Folder X
The built-in Mac OS X  Open and Save As dialog boxes can, at best, be 
described as spartan. Every time you open one, you ﬁ nd yourself wasting 
productive time drilling for a folder to save or open your document. Default 
Folder X ($35, www.stclairsoft.com), shown in Figure 3-4, is a utility that 
replaces the default Open and Save As dialog boxes, giving them a much-needed 
function overhaul. 
The Default Folder X Open and Save dialog boxes includes a series of buttons 
on the right side. The top iconic button is the default folder icon, which allows 
you to specify a directory for saving items by application. Gone are the days 
of always starting in the Documents folder. Using Default Folder X, you can 
specify that, for example, iWork Pages opens and saves to one  folder while iWork 
Numbers saves and opens to a different folder.
The second iconic button opens a directory to your hard disk and  Home 
folder. This is similar to clicking the  My Computer icon on a Windows PC. 
The third iconic button provides a list of favorites. You can mark any folder 
as a favorite using this iconic button and later navigate to it with one click. I mark 

active case folders as favorites along with several other folders I frequently click to 
in the Open and Save dialog boxes.
The ﬁ nal iconic button presents a list of recent locations. When you 
have your head down on a big project with multiple ﬁ les and applications 
squirreled away in different places on your Mac, clicking this button will let you 
immediately access those most recently used folders.
www.ebook777.com

In addition to using the iconic buttons to ﬁ nd speciﬁ c folders, you can also 
point Default Folder X to a speciﬁ c location by clicking on the location in a 
separate Finder window.
The bottom of the Default Folder X Save dialog box includes a Spotlight 
comment ﬁ eld that lets you attach  Spotlight tags (covered in Chapter 1) to your 
ﬁ les as you save them. The bottom of the Default Folder X Open dialog box 
gives you a preview of the highlighted ﬁ le (shown in Figure 3-5), and displays 
permissions, comments, information, and tags.
Default Folders X also installs menu bar and Dock icons that give you access 
to the Default Folder X shortcuts outside the Save As and Open dialog boxes. One 
measure of Default Folder X’s usefulness is the not-so-silent groan I make every 
time I work on a Mac without it and have to open or save a ﬁ le.
Hazel
Hazel ($22; www.noodlesoft.com/hazel), shown in Figure 3-6, is an 
appropriately named system preference that does the housekeeping on your Mac. 
Instead of watching rooms, Hazel watches  folders and cleans up all the ﬁ les in 
those folders pursuant to your instruction. For example, you could have Hazel 
take all the image ﬁ les in your Downloads folder and move them to your Pictures 
folder, as shown in Figure 3-6. 
In Figure 3-6, Hazel is examining the contents of the Downloads folder and 
this rule description is, appropriately named, Move Images. Hazel then constantly 
examines the contents of the Downloads folder for image ﬁ les. The second 
condition requires that the ﬁ le be more than a day old. This way, Hazel won’t ﬁ le 
the image away before you have a chance to access it yourself. Assuming Hazel 
ﬁ nds a ﬁ le that is both an image and more than a day old, it moves the ﬁ le out of 
your Downloads folder and into you Pictures folder. If there is already a copy of 
that image in the Pictures folder, Hazel throws it away.

Hazel doesn’t just look at a ﬁ le’s type. It can also look at a ﬁ le’s extension, 
name, date, label color, and a variety of other criteria. Using Hazel, you can 
develop some sophisticated strategies for automatic  ﬁ le organization. For 
example, you can create a rule where Hazel looks at the ﬁ le names in a given 
folder and sorts the ﬁ les accordingly, as Figure 3-7 shows.
This rule picks any ﬁ le that includes the words “Expense Report” in its name 
and moves the ﬁ le to the Expense folder. The destination folder can be anywhere 
your Mac can see, including your network server. Next, the rule sorts the ﬁ le into 
a subfolder based on the year. If there is no subfolder for the year of the ﬁ le, 
Hazel automatically creates one. Finally, Hazel renames the ﬁ le, inserting the date 
before the name. (When setting up the date string, don’t forget to add a space or 
hyphen between the date and name.) 
Hazel can be set to run the rules automatically or on your command. The 
application runs in the background and uses few processing cycles. I’ve run Hazel 
automatically for years and never noticed it bogging down my Mac. 
Nearly any ﬁ le management you repeatedly do can be automated with Hazel. 
I have rules that empty my Trash every few days, sort my Downloads folder, and 
sort all my scanned ﬁ les to subfolders. These examples only scratch the surface; 
Hazel can also set color labels and add Spotlight comments. It even integrates 
with the iLife library, allowing you to send ﬁ les into iPhoto and iTunes. 
If you are trying to break yourself of the habit of accumulating ﬁ les on your 
desktop, Hazel can lend a hand. You can instruct Hazel to automatically ﬁ le 
documents according to type (putting .doc ﬁ les in a word processing folder, 
for example) or sweep all the desktop ﬁ les into a separate sort folder for later 
processing. If you are brave, you could tell Hazel to throw any ﬁ le that remains on 
your desktop for more than seven days straight into the Trash. 
If you don’t already have a program to delete applications, like AppZapper 
(covered in Chapter 1), Hazel has a feature called  AppSweep that sniffs out 
application support ﬁ les when you delete an application and gives you the option 
to trash them.

Hazel excels at handling the tedious computer management tasks that get in 
the way of doing work, or having fun, with your Mac. 
LaunchBar
LaunchBar ($35; www.obdev.at/products/launchbar) gives you 
ninja-like abilities to operate your Mac quickly without ever touching the mouse. 
The most common use is  application launching. To load applications, 
activate LaunchBar (the default shortcut is J+spacebar) and type in the ﬁ rst 
few characters of your favorite application. If your chosen application is at the 
top of the list, press the Return key. Otherwise, you can use the ↓ key to move 
down and select the application and launch it with the Return key, as shown in 
Figure 3-8. The next time you type the same search string, LaunchBar remembers 
your preference and places the application you chose at the top of the list. 
Also, LaunchBar doesn’t just match text alphabetically; it looks logically at your 
applications in comparison to your shortcut. For example, when I type of, 
LaunchBar displays OmniFocus. 
The ability to quickly launch applications is nice, but that capability is 
already built into Mac OS X with Spotlight (covered in Chapter 1). In addition to 
indexing applications, LaunchBar also indexes ﬁ les, Web sites, contacts, calendar 
entries, and your iTunes library. LaunchBar then makes it easy for you to ﬁ nd and 
access all that information using a few keyboard shortcuts.
For example, in addition to just opening applications, you can open 
applications with speciﬁ c recently used ﬁ les. If you activate LaunchBar and type 
pag to get Pages and then press the spacebar, LaunchBar shows you a list of the 
most recently opened Pages ﬁ les. You then press ↓ to move to the ﬁ le you want 
and press Return. LaunchBar then opens the selected ﬁ le in Pages. This is much 
faster than opening Pages and then going to the Open dialog box and clicking 
through folders to ﬁ nd your ﬁ le. Note that for this to work, the application 
must use the  Mac OS X Recent Items framework. Nearly all applications do, but, 
unfortunately,  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce does not.
LaunchBar indexes all your bookmarked and recent-history Web sites. So if 
you need to quickly navigate to a Web site, activate LaunchBar and start typing 
the Web site’s name. Once the site appears in the LaunchBar search window, press 
Return and LaunchBar opens your default browser and loads the selected page.
You can also do Web searches from LaunchBar: Just activate LaunchBar and 
type in your desired search engine. Typing goo is enough to pull up the Google 
search engine. Then press the spacebar and LaunchBar gives you a line to type 
in your search query, as shown in Figure 3-9. Once you’ve typed in your search, 
press Return and LaunchBar opens your browser, goes to Google, and performs 

your search, displaying the results. LaunchBar supports many common searchable 
databases with this technology, including Wikipedia, Amazon.com, iTunes, 
Google Images, and eBay.
LaunchBar is also useful for accessing information from the Mac OS X 
Address Book. LaunchBar indexes all your contacts, so if you activate LaunchBar 
and begin typing the name of a contact in the LaunchBar search menu, you can 
open that person’s card in Address Book or press the spacebar to get his or her 
contact information. From there you can press Return on the e-mail address to 
automatically open a new e-mail addressed to that person in your default mail 
client. If you press Return when on the person’s phone number, the person’s 
www.ebook777.com

name and phone number are displayed in large text on your Mac’s screen so you 
can dial your phone from across the room, as shown in Figure 3-10.
You can add calendar items and to-dos to  iCal using LaunchBar. To do 
so, you must use LaunchBar’s calendar syntax. For example, to set a lunch 
appointment with Jean on May 8 on your personal calendar, activate LaunchBar, 
select your personal calendar by typing personal, press the spacebar, and type 
Lunch with Jean @ Jan 12 12-1pm. Once you get the hang of it, entering 
events is faster with LaunchBar than opening iCal and creating events. To-dos 
are easier: Again you select the calendar for the to-do item and then just type the 
to-do. For example Write Smith report !! adds a to-do item with medium 
priority.
If you don’t want to drill through the Finder for a ﬁ le, you can search your 
Mac’s ﬁ le system using LaunchBar. If you need to open your Pictures folder for 
example, activate LaunchBar and type pictures. LaunchBar displays your 
Pictures folder from your Home folder. You can then press Return to open the 
Pictures folder in the Finder or press → to start navigating the Pictures folder in 
the LaunchBar window. If you activate LaunchBar and press the ~ (tilde) key, 
LaunchBar jumps to your Home folder. Mac OS X’s  Quick Look feature also 
works from LaunchBar, so if you have a ﬁ le selected in the LaunchBar window, 
pressing the spacebar previews the ﬁ le. With a little practice you can navigate to 
any ﬁ le on your Mac using just your keyboard much faster than using the Finder 
and a mouse or trackpad.
In addition to navigating to ﬁ les, LaunchBar lets you manipulate them. If 
you have an image ﬁ le on your desktop, for example, you can select it (by clicking 
it with the mouse or using LaunchBar) and then act on it with LaunchBar by 
pressing and holding J+spacebar for a few seconds activating LaunchBar’s Instant 
Send mode. You can tell an item is tagged for Instant Send by the orange arrow 
icon in the LaunchBar window. You can then navigate to a different location 
on your Mac using LaunchBar (such as the Pictures folder) and press Return. 
LaunchBar then gives an option to copy or move the ﬁ le from the desktop to the 
chosen destination. Instead of moving the ﬁ le, you could instead type in a contact 
name and automatically attach the ﬁ le to an outgoing e-mail. Once you get the 
hang of it, you will be surprised how fast you can manipulate ﬁ les.
Another LaunchBar feature is the ability to save the  Clipboard history. Every 
time you copy a new item into your Clipboard, the prior contents are ﬂ ushed 
from memory. When you ﬁ nd yourself switching your clipboard between several 
items, it becomes maddening. LaunchBar can remember up to 40 items on 
your Clipboard and what applications they came from. You can access all these 
clippings by activating LaunchBar and typing ClipboardHistory (I use the 
shortcut ch). LaunchBar then gives you a list of the most recent clippings, as 

shown in Figure 3-11. You can scroll down the list with the arrow keys or type a 
few letters from a particular entry to make LaunchBar focus on it. Once you’ve 
found the entry you want to use, press Return and LaunchBar pastes it in your 
current application. LaunchBar also lets you set a preference that all text is copied 
and pasted as plain text; this helps when moving text between word processors 
and the Web.
LaunchBar has many additional tricks up its sleeve. You can resize an image 
by selecting a ﬁ le, activating LaunchBar, and typing resize. You can create an 
archive by selecting multiple ﬁ les, activating LaunchBar, and typing zip. 
There are several competing application launchers for Mac OS X, but none 
of them works with LaunchBar’s panache. Once you get the hang of LaunchBar, 
you can make your Mac dance using your keyboard. I have bafﬂ ed many long-
time Mac users with my lightning-fast Web searches and ﬁ le manipulations using 
LaunchBar.

The Internet 
The Internet 
and Your Mac
and Your Mac
O
ne of the reasons for the resurgence of the Mac OS X platform is the 
 Internet. As we do more of our computing through Web browsers and 
Internet portals, our operating system becomes less important. When 
you read the New York Times on the Internet, it doesn’t care whether you are using 
Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X to do so. This gives Mac workers the freedom to use 
Mac OS X. This chapter explains the best ways to access the Internet from your Mac.
The  Web Browser Options
Although Internet Explorer rules Windows, there are several browsing 
applications on the Mac OS X. Three of the most popular Mac browsers are Apple 
Safari, Mozilla  Firefox, and Google  Chrome. 
Apple Safari
Safari (free; www.apple.com/safari), shown in Figure 4-1, ships on every 
new Mac. Safari, designed by Apple, includes the best Mac OS X Internet browser 
integration. For example,  Safari works out of the box with the built-in Mac OS X 
downloads stack. It also works natively with Apple’s  Mail application, allowing 
you to e-mail a link or contents of a page. You can even save photos from Safari 
directly to  iPhoto. Safari is also very automation-friendly and accepts instructions 
from Automator and AppleScript, both of which are explained in Chapter 24. 
Safari also integrates the Mac OS X  Dashboard with the  Web clippings feature 
that turns a Web page into a Mac OS X Dashboard widget accessible for quick 
reference. If you use Safari and also use a Windows PC, there is a Windows 
version that follows most of the same interface guidelines as Safari on the Mac.
Font rendering runs deep in the Mac OS X DNA. This is apparent in Safari, 
which renders fonts beautifully with its own anti-aliasing. Safari is also intelligent 
about the way it prints Web sites, auto-shrinking when appropriate.
Safari is based on  WebKit, an open source Internet rendering engine. 
WebKit is the foundation of Safari on the Mac, iPhone, and iPad. It is also the 
engine used for Google’s Chrome, covered later. With WebKit, Apple, which was 
legendary for its proprietary systems when the Mac was ﬁ rst released, now ﬁ nds 
www.ebook777.com

itself at the leading edge of open Internet standards. Safari supports numerous 
experimental properties such as text and object effects that enhance the browsing 

experience. Unfortunately, not all Web sites are compliant with these emerging 
properties. Some sites, particularly high-security and ﬁ nancial sites, may not 
render in a WebKit-based browser. Mozilla’s Firefox, explained later, does 
normally render these sites.
Safari supports   extensions (also called  plug-ins and  add-ins). Apple has a Web 
site with a collection of some of the most popular Safari extensions (choose Safari 
➧ Safari Extensions Gallery or visit http://extensions.apple.com). Using 
extensions, you can add features to the browser.
Extensions are a new addition to Safari 5, so developers are just starting to 
sink their teeth into the capability. Still, extensions already exist that add security, 
bookmarking, productivity, shopping, and translation tools. My favorites include 
the following::
 ◗
AutoPagerize. Some Web sites use a practice of paginating their 
articles, requiring you to click through multiple pages (and multiple ads) 
to complete the article. AutoPagerize automatically assembles multipage 
articles into one page.
 ◗
A Cleaner YouTube. Have you noticed how messy YouTube is? 
When you go to watch a video, you are bombarded with additional 
information. A Cleaner YouTube removes the junk and lets you watch just 
the video.
www.ebook777.com

 ◗
Google Reader Styles. This extension cleans up the otherwise 
uninspiring Google Reader (covered later in this chapter) Web view.
 ◗
InstaPaperBeyond. This extension adds keyboard shortcuts to the 
Instapaper service (covered later in this chapter), making navigation 
much easier. 
Other popular Safari extensions include  1Password (covered in Chapter 23)
and  ClickToFlash (covered later in this chapter).
In Safari, you can start browsing where you left off by choosing to reopen all 
the windows from your last session in the   History menu. Another useful feature 
in Safari for Mac workers is the built-in  PDF-rendering engine. This allows you to 
view PDF documents in Safari without going to an outside application or add-in. 
You can open the PDF in Preview, covered in Chapter 12, or save it to your Mac 
for later use.
Safari’s  Top Sites feature, shown in Figure 4-2, allows users to get an attractive 
page with small images of their favorite Web sites. Top Sites can be conﬁ gured 
to your favorite sites and is easily navigable with one click. The  Cover Flow view, 
shown in Figure 4-3, allows you to ﬂ ip through sites in your browsing history. 
Because Safari keeps an index of all the content in the page history, you can even 
search for individual words contained on the pages.
Mozilla Firefox
Mozilla’s  Firefox (free; www.mozilla.org), shown in Figure 4-4, is an open 
source browser and was the ﬁ rst real alternative to Internet Explorer on Windows 

since the original browser, Netscape Navigator. Because it has such penetration on 
the Windows platform, Firefox works with just about every Web site. If you come 
across a site that doesn’t load in Safari or Chrome, try it in Firefox.
Firefox is also the most extensible browser available for Mac OS X. If you like 
to customize your browser, Firefox is for you. There are multiple add-ins for every 
conceivable use. At the time of this writing, there were more than 6,000 add-
ins available for Firefox. Additionally, there are thousands of themes to change 
the look of the application. If you want your browser to feature unicorns and 
cupcakes, you can do it with Firefox. 
The following  add-ins are particularly helpful for Mac workers (you can ﬁ nd 
most Firefox add-ins at http://addons.mozilla.org):
 ◗
Merriam-Webster (www.merriam-webster.com) puts a dictionary 
in your browser.
 ◗
DeeperWeb allows you to navigate through Google search results using 
tag clouds.
 ◗
FastestFox speeds up Firefox with several tweaks and improvements.
 ◗
Wired-Marker installs a highlighter in your browser. You can mark 
up a page in different colors and the page is automatically saved in a 
scrapbook, as shown in Figure 4-5.
 ◗
Converter lets you convert units, time zones, and currency on any Web site. 
 ◗
Adblock Plus stops a lot of advertising before it gets to your browser.
www.ebook777.com

 ◗
Greasemonkey allows you to drastically change the functionality with 
downloaded  JavaScript programs.
Because Firefox add-ins work on all platforms, it is a popular browser for 
people who use both Windows and Mac OS X; they can have the same browser 
experience on both machines. 
Google Chrome
Google recently launched its own browser, Chrome, shown in Figure 
4-6.  Chrome for the Mac (free; www.google.com/chrome) simpliﬁ es the 

traditional browser interface. The search bar and address bar are combined into 
one box, called the Omnibox. You can type a Web address or a search query in 
the same place, and Chrome is smart enough to do the right thing. The Chrome 
address bar also displays the security level of the current site and allows you to 
bookmark pages.
The Chrome browser’s  New Tab button works much like Top Sites in Apple’s 
Safari, opening a preview page of several sites available to you, as shown in Figure 
4-7. Also like Safari, Chrome uses  WebKit as its rendering engine.
Google Chrome runs each browser tab in its own block of memory. This 
technique, called  sandboxing, makes for a stable browsing environment. If you 
have seven tabbed pages open and one page crashes, Chrome ﬂ ushes the memory 
for that single tab and keeps the remaining six tabs open. This sandboxing also 
makes your browser more secure: If a hacker gets into your sandboxed Web page, 
he usually can’t get any further than the tab assigned to that particular page. This 
partitioning of the browser is a signiﬁ cant advance in browser technology. Indeed 
the WebKit team has announced that it will adopt this feature, so it will also be in 
Safari, and Firefox is sure to follow suit.
Although Chrome doesn’t offer the slick user experience you get with Safari’s 
Cover Flow view, Chrome does a good job indexing and searching visited sites. 
You shouldn’t be surprised; Google is the undisputed king of search.
Where Safari offers the best integration with Mac OS X, Chrome has the best 
integration with the cloud-based  Google applications such as  Gmail,  Google 
BOOKMARK SYNCING
Because there are several attractive browser options on the Mac, you may 
ﬁ nd yourself using multiple browsers and if you do, you will want to share 
your bookmarks among them.
When syncing bookmarks between multiple browsers, one popular tool is 
Xmarks (free; www.xmarks.com). This Internet-based service installs on 
your computer and keeps your bookmarks in sync. It is multiplatform, so if 
you use a Windows PC at your desk and the Mac on the road, you will have 
no trouble sharing your bookmarks.
If you’re not comfortable synchronizing your bookmarks through 
the Web, a local tool is Agile Web Solutions’  All Bookmarks (free; www.
agilewebsolutions.com/allbookmarks). This application puts 
all your bookmarks in your menu bar for use in any Web browser installed on 
your Mac.
If you just use Safari but have multiple Macs, an  iPad, or an  iPhone, you 
can sync your bookmarks with Apple’s  MobileMe service ($100 per year; 
www.apple.com/mobileme). MobileMe is a subscription service that 
has several additional beneﬁ ts as referenced throughout this book.
www.ebook777.com

Docs,  Google Reader, and the ever-expanding Google cloud-based software 
library. If you rely on the Google applications, Chrome is probably the right 
browser for you.
Chrome is also extensible. Although it does not have the exhaustive add-in 
library available to Firefox, there is an active community of Chrome developers. 
There are  add-ins for Twitter and many Web social networking services, as well 
as feature improvements, ad blockers, and enhancements. One of the best is 
SearchPreview, which allows you to see thumbnail images of the Web sites 
generated in response to your Google search.
Despite its newness, Chrome is making an impression with innovative 
security and stability features, making it a favorite for many Mac workers.
Choosing a browser
I have not said which browser is fastest because there is no clear winner. 
There is a constant arms race among the various browsers over which is the 
fastest. Every time a new version of any particular browser comes out, it is claimed 
to be the fastest, until the next browser’s update shows up. All three Mac browsers 
are fast. More important, with modern computer processors, there isn’t much of a 
difference between the slowest and fastest browser. 
The real choice is about features and stability. Firefox is the most extensible 
and most likely to open any Web page you throw at it. Safari masters the Mac 
OS X experience and integrates throughout the operating system. Chrome features 
some great new technologies and the Google Web experience. They are all free, 
and the best way to choose is to try them out and see what works best for you. 
There is no wrong decision. And you can use more than one if you like.
Taming Flash
Adobe Flash is a programming environment that allows Web developers 
to make animated graphics for the Internet, as well as other interactive items. 
When you log onto a Web site and there are popping lights, jumping boxes, 
and moles to whack, most likely there is a Flash animation involved. Flash is 
the programming environment of choice for many advertisements and complex 
animated Web pages. 
Unfortunately, Flash doesn’t always run efﬁ ciently on the Mac. Moreover, 
not all Flash programmers are created equal. Once you start opening multiple 
tabs and have several Flash instances running on your Mac at the same time, 
your browser — and your Mac in general — may slow to a crawl. Because Flash 
animations are processor-intensive, running them for extended periods makes 
your Mac run hotter, requires the fans to run more often, and reduces the 

available battery life on your MacBook. Flash also can present a security risk as 
some hackers exploit Flash as a point of entry into your computer.
One of the best methods to ensure efﬁ cient browser performance is to stop 
Flash in its tracks. For Apple Safari, use the shareware add-in,  ClickToFlash 
(www.clicktoflash.com). Once installed, ClickToFlash blocks all incoming 
Flash animations. When your page loads, you just see an empty box with the 
word “Flash” written in the middle, as shown in Figure 4-8. If ClickToFlash 
blocks a Flash animation that you do want to see, just click the blank space 
and the animation loads. If you Control+click or right-click on a blocked Flash 
animation, you can instruct ClickToFlash to always allow (or to always ban) Flash 
animations on certain Web sites, as shown in Figure 4-8. An additional beneﬁ t 
is that ClickToFlash also strips the Flash out of YouTube, allowing you to watch 
dogs surf without overloading your Mac.
Because ClickToFlash stops Flash animations until you speciﬁ cally authorize 
viewing them, your browser is much less likely to get bogged down. Stopping 
Flash results in a more stable and secure browsing environment for you and 
much less work for your Mac, which will run cooler and longer. If you are using 
Firefox or Chrome, use the  Flashblock extension for the same purpose. It is not as 
feature-rich as ClickToFlash but it does block Flash.
Once you install a Flash blocker, you will be amazed at how much more 
stable your Web browsing is and surprised by how infrequently you need to click 
the box and let Flash loose on your Mac.
If you really want to declare war on Flash, you can also install BashFlash 
(www.bashflash.com). This shareware application installs to your menu bar 
and gives you feedback as to how much work Flash is giving your Mac. It works 
with both Chrome and Safari. If the menu bar icon turns red, Flash is using a lot 
www.ebook777.com

of system resources. With two clicks on the menu bar icon, you can kill all active 
Flash animations.
By using a Flash blocker with BashFlash, you can limit your exposure to Flash 
animations in your browser and make sure the Flash code you do let through to 
your Mac doesn’t get in your way.
RSS
Do you have a lot of bookmarks and ﬁ nd it tedious clicking them to see what 
is new? You are not alone. If you had even 15 Web sites that were relevant to your 
industry and worth checking on a daily basis, you could spend hours just clicking 
to see what is new. Fortunately, there is a solution for this called RSS, which 
stands for Really Simple Syndication. 
An RSS document, usually called a  feed, is a bit of Web code that includes 
a list of articles and their text from a blog or Web site (sometimes summarized) 
along with the author and publisher data, as shown in Figure 4-9.
You give an RSS reader a list of your favorite Web sites and it pulls the feeds 
from those sites, giving you a list of new articles from all your favorite Web sites 
in one location. This allows you to keep up with all your important Web sites 
with just a glance, and it saves you the trouble of the bookmark tango.
On the Mac, there are several  RSS readers. My favorite is  Google Reader (free; 
www.google.com/reader), shown in Figure 4-10. You can set up Google 

Reader as part of your free Google account and check your feeds from any Web 
browser. Google Reader also has several social networking features, allowing you 
to share and mark feeds for other people.
One of the primary advantages of using the Google Reader service is the ability 
to synchronize with multiple devices. There are Google Reader clients for the iPhone, 
iPad, and Windows, so you can stay current with your feeds from any device.
Some users prefer a dedicated Mac OS X application to read their 
newsfeeds. There are several native Mac OS X applications that synchronize 
with Google Reader. My favorite is  NetNewsWire (free; www.newsgator.com/
individuals/netnewswire), shown in Figure 4-11.
Another option is  Fever ($30; www.feedafever.com). Fever is set up 
on a Web server. You tell Fever which feeds are the most important and it 
automatically ﬁ lters the news for you. Fever uses an interesting temperature 
metaphor to bring what it believes are the most important news items to your 
attention: Articles of interest may be set at 101 degrees, whereas something that 
Fever thinks you must read immediately might be set at 106 degrees.
Once you discover the magic of RSS, you will begin to notice the  RSS logo at 
all your favorite Web sites. It is so easy to click that RSS button and add the feed 
that before long you will ﬁ nd yourself with 200 RSS subscriptions, and when you 
open RSS feed reader over your morning tea you will discover there are 1,732 
unread articles from the last eight hours. It is really easy to go overboard with 
www.ebook777.com

RSS feeds. When you have too many feeds, you either spend your whole day 
catching up (and get nothing else done) or you don’t bother reading any of them 
and lose the beneﬁ t of RSS. So put yourself on a data diet: Pick the feeds that are 
particularly relevant to your industry and stick with those.
Instapaper
Once you become Internet-savvy with your customized browser and efﬁ cient 
RSS workﬂ ow, you will discover there are a lot of interesting articles you want to 
read. The trouble is ﬁ nding a time and a place to read those articles. Instapaper 
(free; www.instapaper.com) is a great tool. 
As part of the Instapaper account setup, you copy a special bookmark named 
Read Later to your browser’s bookmarks bar. This special bookmark, called a 
bookmarklet, has a bit of  JavaScript code in it. After you copy the bookmarklet 
into your bookmarks, anytime you ﬁ nd an interesting Web article that you don’t 
have time for, you just click the Read Later button to have that JavaScript push a 
copy into your Instapaper account. Instapaper then does its best to remove the 
Internet noise and show you just the article text and any inline pictures. You can 
later log in to your Instapaper account and read the articles at your leisure. If you 
own an  iPhone or  iPad, there is also an  Instapaper application that allows you to 
synchronize your Instapaper articles to those mobile devices.
Instapaper is very useful to Mac workers: No matter what your profession, 
using the Web to intelligently ﬁ nd, ﬁ lter, and absorb information is within your 
grasp on the Mac.

Web 2.0 and the Future
Although the Internet started life as a pipe of information, it has become so 
much more. There is an emerging group of Internet-based software applications 
that work out of your browser and are licensed with a monthly fee. This  software-
as-a-service, or SaaS, model seeks to replace the traditional approach of buying 
software licenses for your ofﬁ ce computers and servers. Instead, companies and 
users subscribe to software from an online vendor. This book addresses several of 
the popular Internet-based (or cloud) applications in their appropriate chapters, 
such as  Google Docs in Chapter 11.
There are certain beneﬁ ts to software as a service. It is, by its very nature, 
multiplatform. These applications run on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and 
mobile operating systems — as long as they follow accepted Web standards, of 
course. These services also are low-maintenance. The software is upgraded and 
maintained by the software vendor on its servers. No longer do you have to bring 
in IT staff in the middle of the night because your key application decided to stop 
behaving. Also, if your staff is mobile, it gives them easy access wherever they are, 
as cloud-based data is accessible from anywhere there’s an Internet connection. In 
some cases, it can replace costly data servers in your ofﬁ ce. 
Despite these beneﬁ ts, software as a service is not a solution for every 
company. Data security may require that you keep everything on your local 
servers. Also, this is an emerging ﬁ eld, and often the cloud-based software lack 
features found in traditional local applications. Regardless, as browsers become 
more powerful, the move toward cloud-based software is going to accelerate.
The Internet is a blessing and a curse for Mac workers. It offers a wide 
variety of tools and services to allow us to get work done more easily, but it 
also constantly threatens to drown us in information. Using the tools from this 
chapter, you should be able to tame the Internet on your Mac.

Using E-mail
Using E-mail
 E
-mail is, for many Mac workers, their primary mode of communication. 
Although e-mail is now ﬁ rmly entrenched in the workplace, few Mac 
workers have given much thought about how to manage their e-mail 
efﬁ ciently. This chapter will make you an e-mail power user, explaining how 
e-mail works, showing you some of the best e-mail clients on the Mac, and 
offering tips to make e-mail work for you.
E-mail Protocols
One of the beneﬁ ts of using a Mac is you don’t have to spend much time 
thinking about the underlying technologies of how it works. That is what you 
pay Apple for. E-mail, however, is different. After someone clicks Send and 
before a message arrives in your inbox, it is parked somewhere on the Internet. 
The purpose of your local e-mail application (often called the mail client) is to 
talk to the mail server holding your message and successfully get it delivered to 
your computer. The technology used by the Internet to deliver that message to 
you is called an  e-mail protocol, and there are several popular ones: POP, IMAP, 
Gmail IMAP, and Exchange. Picking the right protocol is essential to efﬁ ciently 
managing your e-mail. 
POP and IMAP are the most common protocols used in small businesses 
as well as by Internet-based e-mail services used by individuals and businesses 
alike. Microsoft’s proprietary Exchange is typically used by larger companies, and 
I cover it and other corporate e-mail technology later in this chapter.
POP e-mail
The  POP (Post Ofﬁ ce Protocol) e-mail protocol dates back to 1984. The goal 
of the POP protocol is to get the e-mail off the Internet e-mail server and onto 
your computer. When using a POP server, your computer sends a message asking 
for new messages, and the POP server sends the messages to the local client. 
Usually, a POP server sends the entire message to your computer without keeping 
a copy on the mail server. This made a lot of sense when everyone used just one 
www.ebook777.com

computer. All the messages came to one place, and you always had local access to 
all your mail. 
But once you start adding laptops, smartphones, and iPads, a problem 
arises: Messages are scattered across several devices. For example, when your 
iMac connects to a POP mail server and retrieves your e-mail, the POP server 
dutifully drops that e-mail in your inbox and deletes it from the server. When, 
three hours later, you check e-mail on your MacBook, the POP server reports 
there is no e-mail: It has already discarded the e-mail downloaded to your iMac. 
A few hours later, you check your e-mail again, this time on your iPhone; there’s 
a new message from a co-worker that was sent after you checked your e-mail 
on the MacBook. The server sends that message to the iPhone and deletes it, so 
now neither the MacBook nor iMac will get it when you next check for e-mail on 
them. Before long, you have your e-mail split among several devices, and not one 
device has everything. 
It didn’t take long for people to realize this was a problem. One solution is 
to tell the POP server to keep copies of all e-mail (usually, for a speciﬁ ed period, 
such as a week or month). This way, each e-mail gets delivered to all devices. But 
this workaround can prove troublesome: The POP mail server has no idea what 
you do with the e-mail after it is downloaded to your device. So, if you read and 
move the message into a folder on your iMac, when you get e-mail later on your 
iPhone, the POP server doesn’t know that and shows the message as unread in 
your inbox. That can be confusing — requiring you to remember which messages 
you’ve read and dealt with previously.
By default, a POP server deletes any message on the server that you delete 
on your mail client, which helps ensure that you see speciﬁ c spam messages just 
once. But many people conﬁ gure the POP server to keep deleted messages for a 
day or a week as a safety precaution in case they deleted a message by accident 
and want to get it from the server’s Trash folder. In that case, all your devices get 
the deleted spam messages as well — at least until the server ﬁ nally deletes them.
The bottom line is that there isn’t enough communication between the mail 
client and POP server to manage mail across multiple devices.
IMAP e-mail
IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol) solves the POP problem. The idea 
behind IMAP is to not remove the message from the server after sending it to the 
e-mail client, but instead to leave it on the server so it’s available for any and all 
devices that check e-mail on that account. Because the server retains the e-mail, 
each of your devices can download a copy and remain synchronized with each 
device and the server.

IMAP also synchronizes  folders (POP does not). So, if you create an e-mail 
folder called Action on your iMac using an IMAP mail account, the IMAP server 
synchronizes that folder and its contents to your MacBook and iPhone. Say that 
you read a message on your iMac and move it to the Action folder; the server sees 
this and moves the message to the Action folder on the server. The next time your 
MacBook and iPhone access the e-mail server, their Action folders are updated to 
include that message.
In addition to keeping your work e-mail organized, IMAP synchronization 
helps you out with spam: Once you delete a spam e-mail on, say, your iPhone, it 
goes in the trash on the IMAP server and you will not see it when checking e-mail 
on your other devices. 
Mail Clients
There are several popular  mail clients available for your Mac to manage your 
e-mail accounts. The most commonly used clients in the workplace are Apple 
Mail,  Gmail, and  Microsoft Outlook/Entourage.
Apple Mail
Mac OS X ships with its own e-mail client, Apple  Mail, which is shown 
in Figure 5-1. Apple Mail is a full-featured mail client that works with POP, 
IMAP, and Exchange mail servers. Although Apple’s marketing focuses on Mail’s 
consumer features, it is fully capable of being used for work. 
www.ebook777.com

You set up accounts in Apple Mail in the Accounts pane of the Preferences 
dialog box, shown in Figure 5-2. For  MobileMe,  Gmail,  Yahoo, and  AOL 
accounts, setup is automatic: Type in your account name and password, and Mail 
does the rest. For other POP and IMAP mail services, you need to provide your 
mail server details, which should be available from your mail service provider. 
Apple Mail also works with Microsoft  Exchange, as covered later.
If you use multiple accounts, Mail tracks each account separately and lets 
you set different server rules, such as how long to keep deleted messages, for each 
account.
Composing a new e-mail in Mail is intuitive: As you start typing a recipient’s 
name, Mail follows your keystrokes and tries to ﬁ ll in the name from your 
Address Book database and Mail’s own list of recent correspondents. Mail also 
looks for groups from your Address Book. If you create a group of 12 people 
called Smith Account in Address Book, typing Smith Account in a Mail 
recipient ﬁ eld adds all 12 members. Alternatively, you could open Address Book 
and drag people (or groups of people) into your message’s recipient ﬁ elds.
If you want to add an attachment to your message, drag the ﬁ le in from the 
Finder or your Desktop. If you want to add a link, click and drag the address from 
the Safari or Firefox address bar straight into the body of the message. Mail lets 
you embed a Web link in your e-mail. To do so, select the text where you want to 
include the link and press J+K. Mail opens a dialog box in which you can insert 
a Web link. The linked text then displays in blue in the recipient’s mail box, and 
clicking on the words opens the Web link. This is especially useful when sending 
long links.
To add photos, click the Photo Browser button in the Mail toolbar (or choose 
Window ➧ Photo Browser) and a photo browser listing your  iPhoto and  Aperture 
libraries appears. Mail lets you set an image size in the lower-right corner of the 

outgoing message box. This allows you to skip the step of shrinking large images 
to reduce ﬁ le size before sending them; Mail does it for you.
Mail has tools to help you manage incoming e-mail. Mail incorporates 
the Mac OS X  Quick Look feature that lets you preview a mail attachment by 
selecting it and pressing the spacebar. This works for most common data formats, 
including Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, iWork, image, and PDF documents.
Mail’s  data detectors examine your incoming mail. If Mail detects the 
existence of contact information or a calendar event, you can add the contact 
to Address Book or the event to your  iCal calendar by clicking the data detector 
disclosure triangle that appears next to the contact or event in the mail body, as 
shown in Figure 5-3.
Taking a page from iTunes, Mail allows you to create   “smart” mailboxes 
where you can build a  mailbox that automatically populates with messages based 
on the criteria you set. Note that the messages in a smart mailbox are actually 
aliases to the original messages, which remain in the inbox or in whatever folders 
Mail ﬁ nds them. Thus, a smart mailbox is a virtual mailbox, which means you 
can have the same message in several smart mailboxes, even though the actual 
message resides in just one physical location. To create a new smart mailbox, 
choose Mailbox ➧ New Smart Mailbox or click the + (plus) iconic button in the 
lower left of the Mail window.
As an example, you could create a smart mailbox that looks for e-mail with 
the words “Smith account” in the subject line, dated in the last two months, 
and is ﬂ agged. Once you create that smart mailbox, it automatically ﬁ lls with 
www.ebook777.com

all e-mails matching your criteria, and keeps updating the smart mailbox as 
you receive more e-mail. So, if you unﬂ ag a message in the smart mailbox, that 
message is immediately removed from the smart mailbox, because it no longer 
satisﬁ es the smart mailbox criteria. (The message isn’t deleted from your mail 
database, of course.) 
You can be very creative with smart mailboxes. For example, you can create a 
smart mailbox for messages from your supervisor, messages to your key clients, or 
messages that contain the words “new order.” Smart mailboxes are easy to create 
and can be easily deleted when they are no longer needed. Because the process of 
manually sorting your mail into subfolders is usually a waste of time (as I explain 
later in this chapter), creating a smart mailbox when the need arises is the better 
approach.
Mail also includes a powerful search engine. When using its search bar, 
Mail searches as you type each letter. You can search your entire mail database, 
including all the information in every message, or limit your search to the sender, 
recipient, or subject ﬁ elds. You can also limit your search to speciﬁ ed mailboxes. 
I have always found Mail search to be fast: My e-mail database contains about 
50,000 messages and I’m able to quickly locate messages using Mail search. Some 
users report that Mail’s search slows down with larger databases. In that case, 
there are third-party applications designed to streamline Mail’s search, such as 
Rocketbox ($15; www.getrocketbox.com).
Mail has a useful rule system for automating your mail messages. In the Rules 
pane of the Preferences dialog box, you can create rules to automatically process 
incoming e-mail. For example, you can create a rule that takes any incoming 
message from your key client and turns the message red, forwards a copy to your 
assistant, and plays an alarm when it arrives (see Figure 5-4). You could also 
create a rule that takes any e-mail message from that one relative who enjoys 
forwarding e-mail about dancing cats (we all have at least one of those relatives) 
and moves it straight to the trash. 

Rule-based e-mail management is limited only by your imagination. Mail’s 
rules management even includes the ability to run AppleScripts (covered in 
Chapter 24) upon receipt of the message. Mail’s native rule support applies to 
every incoming message. You cannot limit its application to speciﬁ c messages or 
outgoing messages. Nor can you create rules that act on messages inside folders, 
such as to archive older mail from speciﬁ c folders on a periodic basis to keep 
your server storage under control. The ability to apply rules to outgoing mail and 
speciﬁ c messages is, however, available with the Mail Act-On plug-in covered later 
in this chapter. 
Apple Mail add-ons
Like most Apple software applications, Apple Mail focuses on the user 
experience details but does not include a lot of extra features. Fortunately, Apple 
Mail is extensible. Several software developers have created add-ons for Apple 
Mail to enhance its capabilities. My favorite ones include the following.
Mail Act-On
Mail Act-On ($25; www.indev.ca/mailacton) allows you to ﬁ le e-mail 
messages much quicker. Although the Apple Mail rule system provides a way to 
manage messages, everything is automatic. You do not have a choice of when, 
and when not, to activate rules. Mail Act-On gives you this ability. It allows you to 
create rules that are selectively activated on your keystrokes.
For example, in Apple Mail the only way to move a message to a folder is to 
click and drag it. This takes time. First you must take your hands off the keyboard 
and put them on the mouse. Then you must drag the message to a folder and 
drop it. In addition to the lost time, there is always the possibility that you will 
land on the wrong folder and misﬁ le the message. If you process 50 messages a 
day, this lost time adds up. Using Mail Act-On, you can create a keyboard rule 
that automatically ﬁ les messages in a designated mailbox when you press a 
keyboard shortcut. The rules are created in the Mail Act-On window of the Apple 
Mail Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 5-5. 
www.ebook777.com

Let’s break down the rule in Figure 5-5 to understand how it works. The rule 
name is listed in the rule description ﬁ eld so you can identify it later. The Act-On 
Key is the keyboard letter that is combined with the Control key to activate the 
rule. In this case, the keyboard combination is Control+S. Leave the default 
setting at Any, so any conditions satisfy the criteria; in this case, there is just one 
criterion: Every Message. Now that you’ve deﬁ ned how the rule applies and what 
keyboard combination triggers it, you need to instruct Mail Act-On what to do 
with the messages when activated. You do that with the rule actions. In this case, 
I’m telling Mail Act-On to move the message to a speciﬁ ed mailbox and mark the 
message as read. Finally, I’m asking Mail to play the Ping sound to notify me the 
move is done. Using rules like this, you can ﬁ le all your mail messages to different 
mailboxes with different key combinations. 
Moving messages isn’t the only use for Mail Act-On. You can also copy 
messages, set their color, and delete them. If you want to create rules to process 
mail, you can set actions to reply, forward, and redirect messages. You can also 
use Mail Act-On to trigger AppleScript code or apply additional Mail Act-On 
rules. With a little thought, you can automate much of your mail processing with 
this application.
In addition to allowing you to trigger rules upon keystrokes, Mail Act-On also 
gives you the ability to apply rules to your outbox. If, for example, you wanted to 
color every outgoing e-mail to a certain client green, you can create a rule to do 
that. You could also create a rule to copy any e-mail sent to a speciﬁ ed client to 
the account manager for the client. The outbox rules do not require a keyboard 
combination; they are applied automatically to every e-mail you send. 
MailTags
MailTags ($30; www.indev.ca/mailtags.html) adds tagging to Mail 
messages. You can tag any e-mail message you send or receive with multiple tags, 
such as client and project. The interface, shown in Figure 5-6, appears on the right 
side of every Mail message.
Tags created by MailTags can be added as a smart mailbox criterion. For 
example, you can create a smart mailbox that includes all the messages you 
have tagged with a certain project name. Likewise, tags created with MailTags are 
searchable in Mail’s search bar. The tags are also attached to the e-mail message’s 
IMAP data, so if you sync your messages among multiple devices using an IMAP 
server, your tags will follow.
MailTags can be applied in  Mail rules. You can, for example, create a rule that 
automatically adds a MailTag to each incoming message that includes speciﬁ ed 
terms, such as “Jones Proposal.” You can also create rules based on people. If, for 
example, you receive e-mail from Hank Morgan only in relation to a medieval 

studies project, you can create a rule that automatically applies the Medieval 
Study MailTag to every e-mail from Morgan. The beneﬁ t of MailTags is increased 
control over indexing and searching. 
MailSteward
MailSteward ($50; www.mailsteward.com) lets you create a searchable 
backup of your Mail message database. In addition to backing up your mail, 
MailSteward can also archive old messages to slim down Mail’s message database. 
(There is also a $100 version that provides more ﬂ exibility and search tools.)
Gmail
Google Mail (free; www.gmail.com), known as Gmail, is a Web-based 
e-mail service. Several years ago, Google decided to start from scratch and do 
Web-based mail right. It largely succeeded. Gmail is not so much an e-mail client 
as it is an e-mail service. It supports  POP and  IMAP protocols (although Gmail 
IMAP is not the same as normal IMAP, as covered later in this section). You can 
sign up and get your own gmail.com e-mail account with an ever-increasing 
amount of free storage space. Gmail is shown in Figure 5-7.
Rather than install a client on your Mac, Google Mail is Web-based. You 
access your account at www.gmail.com. The Gmail site is a work in progress, 
and Google is constantly updating and adding features. The Gmail Web site looks 
and feels a lot like engineers designed it: It is efﬁ cient, but not very pretty.
www.ebook777.com

One of Gmail’s best features is the ability to manage your e-mail using 
keyboard shortcuts. To move to the next message, press N. To compose a new 
message, press C. You can star a message (Gmail’s version of ﬂ agging) by pressing 
S. These are just a taste of the shortcuts available. With a little practice, you can ﬂ y 
through a crowded e-mail inbox using Gmail’s shortcuts — much faster, in fact, 
than anything you could do in Outlook/Entourage or Mail.
If you want Gmail but don’t want to use the Web interface, you can also 
access your Gmail account using Apple Mail. There is a Gmail-only Mac OS X 
application, called  MailPlane ($25; mailplaneapp.com), that includes 
multiple account support and is better at handling Gmail’s pesky IMAP system.
Gmail supports e-mail message tagging similar to the  MailTags plug-in 
covered earlier. You can tag your e-mail with multiple categories, and Gmail turns 
them into IMAP tags. Where IMAP normally identiﬁ es an e-mail with a single 
folder, Gmail  IMAP identiﬁ es an e-mail with multiple tags. As a result, when you 
sync your Gmail account with a client looking for traditional IMAP, such as Apple 
Mail, things can get a bit wonky. It works, but sometimes Mail gets confused 
about where exactly a mail message belongs because each message has multiple 
IMAP tags.
In addition to setting up your own personal Gmail account, you can use 
Google mail for a company-wide e-mail system. This fee-based corporate e-mail 
service allows you to customize the domain and simply use Gmail as a cloud-
based server. Google has a suite of Internet applications (including Gmail, Google 

Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks) that combine for a cloud-based 
computing lifestyle that a lot of Mac users are adopting. Google is fearless about 
adding new features, making usage of its applications always new and interesting. 
Gmail’s search capabilities are, naturally, outstanding. You can easily search 
your Gmail archive and locate long-forgotten e-mail with simple search terms. 
Gmail also pioneered threaded conversations, which link all e-mails together on a 
given subject, allowing you to view each in succession. Apple Mail and Outlook/
Entourage have added this feature, but it still feels most natural with Gmail.
Another innovative feature in Gmail is the Priority Inbox. Gmail looks at all 
your incoming messages and compares them against your prior e-mails. Gmail 
then displays the messages it believes are the most important in the Priority 
Inbox. (Messages from people you’ve replied to in the past, for example, are 
considered to be priorities.) You can promote and demote speciﬁ c correspondents 
to tell Priority Inbox your speciﬁ c priorities. 
There are downsides to switching to the Gmail. Sometimes, Google adds 
enhancements that aren’t quite ready for prime time, leading to service problems. 
Also, Google makes its money selling advertisements. As a result, it uses all its 
applications to collect information about your preferences so it can do a better 
job of selling ads. If, for example, you send an e-mail to a friend asking about ﬁ le 
server advice, there is a very good chance Gmail will simultaneously display to 
you an ad about ﬁ le servers. I don’t think there is any nefarious purpose behind 
www.ebook777.com

this data collection, but it still keeps some people — including me — from fully 
embracing the Google lifestyle. 
Microsoft  Outlook and Entourage
Outlook ($200; www.microsoft.com/mac) is a new addition to the Mac 
OS, coinciding with the release of  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2011. Outlook, shown in 
Figure 5-8, does not ship with the Ofﬁ ce for Mac 2011 Home and Student edition; 
to get Outlook, you need to purchase the Home and Ofﬁ ce edition. It supports 
POP, IMAP, and Exchange mail servers.
Outlook is a big improvement over its predecessor, Microsoft  Entourage, 
which shipped with prior versions of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce for Mac. Although 
Entourage had some beneﬁ ts over the Mac OS X address, mail, and contact 
applications, it kept all its data in one single database ﬁ le. If that database 
became corrupted, you lost all your e-mail, contacts, and calendars. In my own 
experience, this database corruption was not uncommon. Furthermore, because 
everything was in one large database, it threw  Time Machine (covered in Chapter 
2) into ﬁ ts. Despite some interesting features, I recommend you avoid Entourage.
Unlike Entourage, Outlook uses a ﬁ le-based database that is  Spotlight-
searchable and Time Machine-friendly. The new Outlook brings the familiar 
Windows Outlook experience to the Mac. If you like using Outlook on your 
Windows PC, you’ll feel right at home with it on your Mac. It integrates easily 
with an Exchange server (covered later) and combines your calendar, contacts, 
and e-mail all in one place. 
As an e-mail client, Outlook provides junk mail ﬁ ltering, folders, and rule-
based sorting. It doesn’t, however, integrate with Mac OS X as well as Apple’s 
Mail application does. For example, there are no  data detectors. Outlook is best 
suited to Mac workers who are comfortable with Outlook on the PC or need its 
enhanced Exchange features covered next.
Microsoft Exchange and the Mac
Many workplaces use Microsoft  Exchange data servers to keep track of e-mail, 
contact information, and calendars. As a Mac-based worker, you need to access 
the Exchange data. You can accomplish Exchange access and collaboration with 
varying degrees of success depending on your mail client and Exchange server 
version.
Microsoft Outlook and Entourage 
Outlook is the easiest way to interact with Exchange, because Microsoft 
designed Outlook largely to work with Exchange. Outlook automatically detects 

your Exchange servers and makes account setup as easy as typing in your account 
credentials. Once authorized, you get immediate access to your company’s e-mail 
system, contact database, and calendars. These can be reviewed, modiﬁ ed, and 
deleted depending to your Exchange permissions.
Microsoft Outlook also does the best job of working with the additional 
collaborative features available in Microsoft Exchange. It uses the Exchange Web 
services protocol, so you can make and accept invitations, create and view groups, 
access shared Exchange accounts, and use the other Exchange collaborative 
features. (Note that Microsoft Outlook works only with Exchange 2007 and later.) 
Outlook’s predecessor, Entourage, had more limited Exchange support. 
It did not include support for shared Exchange accounts and several other 
Microsoft server features, such as  SharePoint support. Entourage remains the 
only application with built-in support for Exchange 2003, and working with an 
Exchange 2003 server is perhaps the only reason to use Entourage. If you decide 
to use Entourage, back up your database early and often.
Apple Mail,  iCal, and  Address Book
The ability to use the native Mac OS X Mail, iCal, and Address Book 
applications with an Exchange server depends on which versions of Mac OS X 
and Microsoft Exchange you are running.
USING  LOTUS NOTES OR  NOVELL GROUPWISE
Although Microsoft Exchange is the most popular corporate e-mail server, 
it’s not the only one. IBM’s Lotus Notes is widely used in large enterprises, 
while Novell’s GroupWise is widely used in government agencies.
Both IBM and Novell have mail clients for the Mac. Just as Microsoft’s 
Mac mail clients aren’t quite as capable as their Windows counterparts, so 
too are IBM’s and Novell’s Mac clients not quite as capable as their Windows 
counterparts. For example, GroupWise for Mac doesn’t let you subscribe to 
external calendars, import or export contacts, or support  LDAP address books. 
Notes for Mac doesn’t support left-reading languages such as Arabic and 
Hebrew, and doesn’t integrate fully with Lotus collaboration tools such as 
Lotus Quikr. For both Lotus Notes and GroupWise, the more recent the client 
version, the more equal the Mac client is to the Windows client.
But, as with Microsoft Outlook and Entourage, the Mac clients for Lotus 
Notes and GroupWise support the capabilities most people use, so there’s no 
reason if your company uses Lotus Notes or GroupWise that it can’t support 
Mac users.
And like Microsoft Outlook and Exchange, both Lotus Notes and 
GroupWise support  POP and  IMAP servers in addition to their proprietary 
corporate servers, so you can use them for a mix of e-mail accounts.
www.ebook777.com

Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard includes native Microsoft  Exchange support. 
If your workplace is running Microsoft Exchange 2007 or 2010 servers, setup is 
simply a matter of typing in your network domain, username, and password. At 
that point, Apple Mail, Address Book, and iCal do the rest: They interact with 
your Exchange server and begin sharing data. Mail has a separate account for your 
work Exchange e-mail and displays all the folders from your Exchange account. 
When you ﬁ le an e-mail into an Apple Mail folder, the message is also ﬁ led in the 
corresponding folder on the Exchange server. (This works just like IMAP does, 
except Exchange allows mail folders on the server to have subfolders, while  IMAP 
allows them only as subfolders to local folders, and Exchange can sync contacts 
and calendar data, whereas IMAP cannot.) 
In essence, your Mac becomes pretty much just another client for the 
Exchange database of mail, contacts, and calendars. I say “pretty much” 
because Mail does not support shared Exchange mail accounts or out-of-ofﬁ ce 
notiﬁ cations, and it cannot integrate with other Microsoft server products such as 
SharePoint as Outlook can. 
Unfortunately, neither Outlook nor Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard Exchange 
support Microsoft Exchange 2003. (Microsoft Entourage does.) But you can 
get e-mail access from the older Exchange server if it is conﬁ gured to use the 
Exchange IMAP protocol, in which case you would set up an Exchange  IMAP 
account in Mail. 
Syncing a calendar from a Microsoft Exchange 2003 server is difﬁ cult. There 
is an open source project called  DavMail (http://davmail.sourceforge.
net) that works for some users depending on how their Exchange is conﬁ gured. 
Another possibility is to share your Outlook calendar data with Google calendar 
using   Google’s Outlook synchronization tool (www.google.com/apps/intl/
en/business/outlook_sync.html). Once your Outlook calendar is located 
on Google Calendar, you can access it there or sync it to your Mac using BusyCal, 
which I cover in Chapter 6.
E-mail Best Practices
No matter which e-mail client you decide to use, it is a good idea to form 
good e-mail habits. Too often, Mac workers face inboxes with hundreds (if not 
thousands) of unread e-mails. This becomes overwhelming. When the unread 
e-mail count begins accumulating, you feel powerless to keep up with it and 
eventually declare “ e-mail bankruptcy” (a term coined by famed technology 
lawyer Lawrence Lessig) by deleting or archiving all the contents of your inbox 
without reviewing any of it. You can avoid e-mail bankruptcy by developing some 
new e-mail habits.

Inbox  management 
Think about the mailbox outside your front door for a moment. Has it ever 
been okay to just leave mail in your mailbox? Has it ever occurred to you to just 
let the mail pile up in the box as the mailman keeps stufﬁ ng mail in for weeks on 
end? How about taking some of the mail out of that overstuffed mailbox, looking 
at it for a few minutes, and then cramming it back in the mailbox before walking 
back in the house? Of course not. Nevertheless, it is common practice among 
many Mac workers to do exactly that with their e-mail. 
Most of us treat our e-mail inboxes as some type of substandard to-do list. 
We open a few e-mails and we skip others. Regardless, we leave them all in the 
same place with the idea that we will somehow be able to go back and ﬁ gure out 
what needs to be done and what can be ignored. I don’t think we could design 
FIGHTING  SPAM
Although Mac OS X is much less susceptible to virus attacks than 
Windows PCs (see Chapter 23), there is no difference between Windows and 
Mac OS X when it comes to spam. According to some estimates, 80 percent 
of all e-mail sent is spam. 
Your time is valuable. You should not have to spend it sorting through 
piles of spam to ﬁ nd important e-mail. Two ways to combat spam on your 
Mac are to use a mail server with its own spam ﬁ lters and to install your own 
local spam ﬁ lter to catch anything that still gets through.
Most mail servers (including Exchange, Gmail, MobileMe, and Mac OS X 
Server) have their own spam-ﬁ ghting algorithms. So do most hosted e-mail 
services. These algorithms look at every arriving e-mail and discard most 
spam mail before you ever see it. Gmail is generally considered to have some 
of the best spam ﬁ ltering available. In fact, some users direct all their e-mail 
to a Gmail account for the sole purpose of taking advantage of Google’s 
spam ﬁ lters. 
You can also install your own local spam-ﬁ ghting application on your 
Mac to catch any spam that makes it through your server’s ﬁ lters. The best 
spam-ﬁ ghting Mac application is  SpamSieve ($30; http://c-command.
com/spamsieve). SpamSieve does its own search of all incoming e-mail 
and compares it against a database of known spam mail servers. SpamSieve 
works with most Mac e-mail clients. SpamSieve keeps its own “white list” 
of your previous correspondents so e-mail from your co-workers and clients 
never gets marked as spam. It also integrates with the Mac OS X Address 
Book. Additionally, SpamSieve looks inside attached images and documents 
to detect spam.
By combining mail server and local spam ﬁ lters, you should be able to 
avoid most spam on your Mac.

a more inefﬁ cient and impractical system if we tried. So let’s start over with the 
inbox.
Treat the inbox exactly like that mailbox outside your house. Let the mail be 
delivered there and collect it every day. Just like you sort the mail in your house, 
sort the mail in your inbox. It really is not that difﬁ cult. There aren’t that many 
different kinds of e-mail. When you get right down to it, there are only four types 
of e-mail, and so four types of actions to take:
1. 
1. Get rid of  junk mail. “Dave, don’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime offer to 
purchase Florida swamp land.” Trash your junk mail immediately. Junk 
mail doesn’t just include the obvious spam and solicitations; it includes 
anything you are not interested in or don’t need to keep. Be honest with 
yourself: Unless you are willing to archive or commit to take action in 
response to an e-mail, get rid of it. Keeping e-mail you are ambivalent 
about is the first step toward e-mail bankruptcy.
2. 
2. If there is no response required, archive it. “Dave, it was great 
seeing you at the conference. Let me know if you need any further assistance 
in the future.” If the e-mail does not require a response, get it out of your 
inbox and into your archive. You can always seek it out again later if you 
need it.
3. 
3. If the e-mail requires a quick response, quickly respond. “Dave, 
are we still on for lunch next Tuesday?” A lot of e-mail from co-workers, 
clients, and friends just requires a brief answer and very little thinking 
to get there. We get these all the time. Don’t waste time managing this 
e-mail. While it’s still in your inbox, fire off your response, and file the 
original in your archive.

4. Set aside the rest of your e-mail for later. “Dave, the supplier has 
let us down again. What should we do for a long-term solution?” After getting 
rid of the junk mail, information-only e-mail, and quickie e-mail, you 
will inevitably have some e-mail that doesn’t lend itself to a quick reply. 
The e-mail may require research, or you may need to spend some time 
thinking about your response. Either way, you don’t deal with this type 
of e-mail while you’re sorting your inbox. Instead you move it out of 
your inbox to some reliable place where you know you will come back 
to it later. I do this by copying the e-mail into OmniFocus (covered in 
Chapter 9). You could also put it in some other task application or you 
could create a folder in your mail client called Action where you keep 
e-mails requiring further contemplation and response.
This workﬂ ow is summarized in Figure 5-9.

Folder management
If you were reading carefully my suggested e-mail strategies, you noticed 
that I referenced only three mail locations: the inbox, the Action folder, and the 
archive. Everything else went to the trash. I just use three folders. A lot of e-mail 
users rely upon a Byzantine jumble of nested mail folders including speciﬁ c 
folders for every project, client, administrative function, and employee that have 
ever crossed their path. This system is completely unmanageable. You will spend 
literally days of your life maintaining such a system, and you will never get that 
time back. All the e-mail clients covered in this chapter include powerful search 
technologies that allow you to ﬁ nd any e-mail in your archive. It is important 
to note that the guy who never found that needle in the haystack did not have 
Google search or Spotlight on his side.
You will be ﬁ ne dropping all your e-mail into a central archive and using 
search technologies to ﬁ nd them later. If the thought of getting rid of your e-mail 
folder hierarchy keeps you awake at night, you can add some additional search 
capabilities via plug-ins (like  MailTags in Apple Mail) or tagging the e-mails with 
Gmail. The important thing is to put the nested folders in your past.

E-mail notification
How many times have you been working productively and suddenly heard 
that not-so-subtle “ding” from your Mac informing you there is new mail. As 
soon as you hear that sound, you have already lost. Your concentration is broken 
and it will take some effort to return to work. To add insult to injury, you ﬁ nd 
yourself powerless to resist leaving whatever you were doing and going to your 
e-mail client only to ﬁ nd that the subject of this urgent “ding” was an offer to 
attend a free seminar about the beneﬁ ts of time-shares.
The default setting in Apple Mail is to check your e-mail every ﬁ ve minutes. 
That makes for 12 potential interruptions an hour, 96 interruptions a day, 480 
interruptions in a 40-hour week, and 24,000 interruptions over the course of 
the year (assuming you keep your e-mail turned off during vacation). With this 
constant distraction, it’s amazing anyone gets anything done. Break the chains 
of slavery to your e-mail notiﬁ cation system. Turn off the ding. Whatever e-mail 
client you use, disable the audio alert. It might be scary at ﬁ rst, but then it 
becomes liberating. 
Next, decide how many times a day you need to check e-mail. This really 
depends on your work. I check my mail only twice a day. In some workplaces, 
that would not be enough. Either way, decide the absolute minimum number 
of times you need to check e-mail and stick to it. When it is time to check your 
e-mail, blitz through your inbox as I described earlier. Remember, four kinds of 
e-mail and three folders. Then, get back to work.
As you process mail over the course of your day, you will move several 
e-mails to the Action folder. Take some time and respond to the Action e-mail. 
I do this in the late afternoon. I can normally clear out most of the day’s e-mail 
this way. There may be some items, however, that still require additional work 
and thought. I assign those items to be dealt with tomorrow or next month, as 
the case may be, in OmniFocus (covered in Chapter 9). Once I assign them to a 
future date, I can archive them and access them later from  OmniFocus. By the end 
of the day, my inbox is empty and my Action folder is empty. I haven’t necessarily 
responded to all my e-mail, but I have at least accounted for it.
Using the right applications and a little common sense, you can liberate 
yourself from you inbox and get real work done on your Mac.

Contacts and 
Contacts and 
Calendars
Calendars
A
s much as technology moves forward, everyone still needs a reliable 
address book and calendar. There are several tools for the Mac to help 
you manage this information. Some applications are dedicated to one 
task (like Apple’s Address Book) while others seek to manage contacts, calendars, 
and more (like Microsoft Outlook). This chapter takes a look at the best tools for 
managing calendars and contacts on your Mac.
Contacts
Apple’s built-in  Address Book is a good tool for contact management. 
Shown in Figure 6-1, Address Book is a virtual version of that book of names and 
addresses everyone kept in a drawer a generation ago. 
You can create a new contact in Address Book by clicking the + (plus) iconic 
button below the names column in the left pane of Address Book or by pressing 
J+N. The new contact ﬁ eld is shown in Figure 6-2. 
Address Book includes a default set of ﬁ elds for each new contact but you 
can add ﬁ elds by choosing Card ➧ Add Field. There are several additional useful 
ﬁ elds. The Phonetic Last Name ﬁ eld, for example, is helpful if your contacts 
have unusual names. The URL ﬁ eld lets you add a contact’s Web site to his or 
her contact card. You can add speciﬁ c ﬁ elds for individual cards or you can edit 
the default template (Choose Card ➧ Add Field and then the desired submenu 
option). If you have trouble remembering names, drag a picture of your contact 
on top of the picture placeholder, shown in Figure 6-2, and you can digitally keep 
a face with the name. The Company check box in the address card can be selected 
to convert a contact from an individual to a company, like from Steve Jobs to 
Apple, Inc. The contact will then be alphabetized by the company name instead 
of the individual’s name.
The Birthday ﬁ eld in Address Book works directly with iCal. Any  birthday 
you list in the Address Book can automatically synchronize to your iCal calendar. 
(iCal is covered in further detail later in this chapter.)
You should also create a contact for yourself. In it, list all your contact 
information and then make it your contact  card by choosing Card ➧ Make This 
www.ebook777.com

My Card. Once you do so, any component of Mac OS X that needs your contact 
data, such as a letter template in iWork Pages, will automatically ﬁ ll in your 
contact information.
The Address Book window contains two panes. The right pane has the 
contact details. The left pane contains two columns: groups and individual 
contacts. You create groups by clicking the + (plus) iconic button at the bottom 
of the Groups column. You can create  groups for any logical organization of 
your contacts, such as clients, vendors, and co-workers. Whenever I go on a 
trip, I create a group based on the trip. In it I put contact information for all the 
people I plan to meet as well as information on the hotels, restaurants, shuttle 
services, and other contacts I may need access to quickly.

Address Book also lets you to create   smart groups. Smart groups are 
similar to smart mailboxes in Apple Mail: You set up criteria and Address Book 
automatically populates the smart group with all contacts matching the criteria. 
A smart group could examine the notes section of every contact in your Address 
Book database and ﬂ ag any contact containing the words Smith Proposal, for 
example. Smart groups lets you easily keep track of all your contacts on a big 
project. Another useful smart group is shown in Figure 6-3; it examines all the 
contacts in your Address Book database and selects any contact with a  birthday in 
the next 30 days.
In addition to organizing your contacts, groups are useful for e-mail. You can 
type a group name in an Apple Mail recipient ﬁ eld to automatically populate it 
with all the individuals in that  group.
Address Book is integrated throughout the operating system, letting you use 
your contact data in many places. For example, you can:
 ◗
Drag a  contact (or group of contacts) into an address field of a new 
e-mail (covered in Chapter 5).
 ◗
Drag a contact onto a new Pages letter to automatically fill in the 
addressee’s information (covered in Chapter 11).
 ◗
Drag a group of contacts on a Numbers spreadsheet to create a 
membership list (covered in Chapter 15).
 ◗
Extract contact data from e-mail messages using  data detectors (covered 
in Chapter 5).
This integration throughout the operating system is Address Book’s killer 
feature and the reason it has so few competitors.
Address Book provides several approaches for synchronizing your contact 
data. The easiest is with MobileMe. If you are a  MobileMe subscriber ($100 per 
year), Address Book automatically synchronizes your contact database with the 
MobileMe service. You set this up through the Accounts pane of the  Address Book 
Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 6-4, or through the MobileMe system 
preference. Once your contacts are synced with MobileMe, you can access them 
through the MobileMe Web portal or, if you are an  iPhone, iPod Touch, or  iPad 
user, directly on your mobile iOS devices. So, if you’re at lunch with a client and 
www.ebook777.com

she tells you her assistant’s name, you can add it to the contact card on your 
iPhone and know it will also appear on your Mac.
You can also synchronize your contact database with   Yahoo contacts or 
Google contacts in the Accounts pane of the Address Book Preferences dialog 
box, shown in Figure 6-4. If you use the Google or Yahoo services for e-mail, 
calendaring, and contacts, syncing provides an easy way to take advantage of 
Address Book’s built-in Mac OS X integration and still use your Google or Yahoo 
contacts.
Finally, Address Book interfaces directly with Microsoft   Exchange Server 2007 
or later. Setting up synchronization with Microsoft Exchange is simply a matter 
of typing in your Exchange username and password (synchronization is covered 
in detail in Chapter 21). The Exchange contacts are synchronized separately from 
your other listed contacts, allowing you to keep your work and personal contacts 
separate. Depending on your network’s Exchange settings, you can have a read-
only access or a full synchronization of the Exchange contacts.
 Calendars
Using a digital calendar is great. You can also print it, back it up, and 
even put it on your phone. Mac OS X has some fantastic desktop and online 
calendaring tools depending on how you work.
iCal
 iCal, shown in Figure 6-5, is Mac OS X’s built-in calendar application. iCal 
works much like Address Book. It has a left pane with a list of calendars and a 
right pane that shows the details. The right pane can display a daily, weekly, or 

monthly view of your calendar items. The iCal interface can also display to-do 
items (covered in Chapter 9).
Using iCal, you can create calendars for different aspects of your life. For 
example, you can create calendars for speciﬁ c projects (which can be helpful 
for to-do items as covered in Chapter 9). To create a new calendar, click the + 
(plus) iconic button at the bottom of the left pane in iCal or choose File ➧ New 
Calendar.
To  create a new iCal event, press J+N or choose File ➧ New Event. Using 
the Inspector (accessed by selecting any iCal event and pressing J+I), shown in 
Figure 6-6, you can modify the details of any calendar entry including adding 
alarms or sending out invitations to potential participants.
In addition to creating your own calendars, you can also subscribe to publicly 
available Internet calendars. Apple keeps a list of subscription calendars for iCal 
at www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/calendars. At the time of this 
writing, the list contained more than 200 calendars ranging from U.S. holidays to 
WEB CONTACT TOOLS
Web-based tools for managing  contacts are on the rise. With an 
increasingly mobile workforce and the relatively small data size of contact 
databases, it makes sense to put your contacts on the Web. Using the Web, 
employees and co-workers can all have access to contact data from any 
computer or mobile device. 
Google Contacts is one service for managing your contacts online. It 
synchronizes with your Google account and works particularly well if you use 
Google’s Gmail (covered in Chapter 5) and Google Calendar (covered later in 
this chapter).
Because of the tight integration between Address Book in the operating 
system and the easy ability to synchronize with other contact applications, 
I recommend you use Address Book to manage the contacts on your Mac.
Some companies are taking online contact management one step further 
with  CRM ( customer relationship management) Web services.  Salesforce.com 
(www.salesforce.com) and 37signals’  Highrise (www.highrisehq.
com) are two popular CRM services that work on the Mac.
These services track contacts, leads, and other tools to work with clients 
and synchronize with Microsoft  Outlook and  vCard (the format for Apple’s 
Address Book). In addition to providing contact management, they provide 
tools to help you follow up on sales leads, track existing transactions, and 
better manage e-mail. Because they are Web-based, the software is updated 
“in the cloud” and does not require extensive IT support. Pricing for these 
CRM services depends on the size of your business and the tools you select. 
The customer relationship management industry is in its infancy and will no 
doubt expand in coming years.

golf tour dates. You can also subscribe to third-party  iCal calendars by choosing 
Calendar ➧ Subscribe and inserting the calendar’s URL. URL calendar subscription 
also works with Google Calendar (covered later in this chapter).
iCal features tight integration with Mac OS X. You can create a  birthday 
calendar by checking the Show Birthdays Calendar option in the General pane of 
iCal’s Preferences dialog box; iCal creates a separate calendar with birthday events 
for every contact in your Address Book that has a birthday ﬁ eld entry. 

Apple Mail’s  data detectors (that read your e-mail and ﬁ nd contact 
information, covered in Chapter 5) also work with iCal. If you receive an e-mail 
with a request to meet for lunch tomorrow at noon, Mail sees the event in the 
e-mail text and lets you add it to iCal (demonstrated in Figure 6-7).
You can set up synchronization for your iCal calendar in the Accounts pane 
of the iCal Preferences dialog box. There are several options. 
 ◗
CalDAV is an Internet standard that lets users access and modify 
scheduling data on a centralized remote server. It is similar to IMAP 
for e-mail (covered in Chapter 5). Because the calendaring data is on 
a server, multiple users can access it for planning and sharing calendar 
information. CalDAV was added to Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard. More 
recently, Apple embraced CalDAV further with the  MobileMe service; the 
MobileMe CalDAV scheduling allows users to send invitations and share 
calendar data, two of the biggest complaints against iCal in years past.
 ◗
iCal also supports Microsoft Exchange 2007 and later. As explained 
in Chapter 21, you can enter your Exchange credentials in iCal and 
automatically synchronize with your Exchange server.  Exchange calendars 
appear as a separate calendar in iCal, and you have access to view 
and modify the data as provided by your network administrator. The 
Exchange support in iCal, however, does not match that of Microsoft 
Outlook, covered later in this chapter.
 ◗
Like Address Book, you can also synchronize your calendar data with 
Google Calendar and the Yahoo calendar. Because so many companies 
are adopting the Google online applications and Google Calendar 
(covered later in this chapter), the ability to synchronize Google Calendar 
with your native Mac OS X calendar is important.
iCal is missing several features commonly found in other calendaring 
applications. These include the ability to set recurring   to-do items and the 
ability to share  calendars on the same network. iCal has been much maligned 
by calendar power users because of these missing features. Although Apple has 
answered some of these complaints with  CalDAV integration and MobileMe 
synchronization, there are still unhappy iCal users. This, in part, led to the 
development of BusyCal.
www.ebook777.com

BusyCal
BusyCal ($50; www.busycal.com) bills itself as "iCal Pro." I can't disagree. 
BusyCal, shown in Figure 6-8, closely resembles iCal but provides several 
essential features. Most important, BusyCal can sync calendars with other users 
on your local area network without requiring a dedicated server such as Mac OS X 
Server (covered in Chapter 20). You can publish your BusyCal calendars on your 
network with read-only or read-and-write access. Using BusyCal, a small ofﬁ ce 
can share calendars and avoid the expense of a dedicated server.  BusyCal also 
syncs with Google Calendar (covered later).
BusyCal includes a number of features missing from iCal. BusyCal lets you 
create recurring to-do items. BusyCal also includes a list view, not available in 
iCal, that allows you to create a list of all events in your calendar and sort by type, 
calendar, and other criteria.
Mac OS X has a centralized calendar data ﬁ le where iCal gets its data but 
BusyCal also saves to the same location. As a result, you can open and modify 
your calendar data in both iCal and BusyCal. MobileMe also looks at the same 
data set so your  BusyCal data syncs automatically to MobileMe. 
Google Calendar
Just like Google turned the world of e-mail on its head with Google Mail, it 
has done the same with  Google Calendar (http://calendar.google.com). 

Google Calendar, shown in Figure 6-9 is a simple to use and powerful free Web-
based  calendaring system. 
You can register for the free Google Calendar as part of your Google account. 
The Google Calendar interface is noticeably Web-based. It does not have the 
typical Mac OS X feel but it is functional. The left side of the window includes 
a list of calendars. The right side includes the calendar data. The calendar can 
be displayed in day, week, month, four-day (showing the next four days), and 
agenda views. On the left side of the Google Calendar window, you can see a list 
of your calendars, and manage their setting and sharing preferences.
There are several ways to add a new event. One way is to click on the date 
in Google Calendar and insert the event details. Like Gmail, Google Calendar 
is keyboard-shortcut-friendly, so you can also create a new event by pressing N. 
(You can jump to today by pressing T.)
Like its other online applications, Google Calendar has fantastic sharing 
support. You can share your calendars with co-workers and friends, giving them 
read-only or read-and-write access. You can also make your calendars public. 
Alternatively, you can choose to share only the times that you’re available for new 
events. With these controls, you can tailor your calendar sharing as liberally or 
conservatively as you want. Because it’s a free service, your co-workers can do the

same. Many progressive workplaces are switching their entire calendar system to 
the Google Calendar. 
Google Calendar can also serve as the go-between for many calendaring 
systems. For example, as covered in Chapter 5, you can use Google Calendar as 
an intermediary between a Microsoft Exchange 2003 server and BusyCal. Google 
Calendar also associates a Web link with each calendar, making it easy to publish 
or import the calendar into another application, like iCal. 
With the development of Internet protocols (such as CalDAV) the days of 
all work calendars being managed through a speciﬁ c Exchange-like centralized 
server are over. Calendar sharing and modiﬁ cation are much easier now with 
these software tools. Over the next several years, it will be fascinating to see 
how calendars in the workplace change with the rise of CalDAV and Web-based 
calendaring. 
Integrated   Calendars and Contacts
Mac OS X also offers integrated tools for managing your calendar, contacts, 
and e-mail, but you may want to go beyond them. In that case, two of the best 
tools are Microsoft  Outlook and Daylite.
Microsoft Outlook and  Entourage
Microsoft Outlook ($200; www.microsoft.com/mac) is a welcome 
addition to Mac OS X. Outlook for the Mac, shown in Figure 6-10, was ﬁ rst 

released with Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2011. (Microsoft Outlook replaces Microsoft 
Entourage software from previous versions of Ofﬁ ce.)
As explained in Chapter 5, I am not a fan of Microsoft Entourage. It had, in 
my opinion, several fatal ﬂ aws, chief among them was how it stored data. The 
Microsoft Entourage database includes all your e-mail, contacts, and calendar 
items in one single database. The smallest corruption in the database can lead to 
a complete loss of your data. Entourage’s large, constantly changing, database also 
caused trouble with Time Machine backups (covered in Chapter 2).
Microsoft Outlook ﬁ xes both of these problems by using an incremental 
database that easily backs up to Time Machine. Outlook brings many of the tools 
familiar to Outlook users on Windows computers to the Mac. Plus, Microsoft 
Outlook features the best Microsoft Exchange integration of any software 
application available on the Mac. Although Apple’s built-in iCal and Address 
Book supports Exchange servers, Outlook supports more of Exchange’s sharing 
and collaboration tools. For example, Outlook uses the  Exchange Web services 
protocol and lets you use shared Exchange accounts; Mac OS X Mail does not. 
Outlook supports only Microsoft Exchange 2007 and later, so if your ofﬁ ce runs 
on an Exchange 2003 server, you are out of luck.
The user interface in Outlook 2011 received a much-needed upgrade. Like 
the other applications in the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce suite, Outlook now uses the 
ribbon-style interface which groups types of features together and allows you to 
transform the toolbar by clicking different portions of the ribbon. The ribbon is 
shown in Figure 6-10.
Creating and organizing calendar events is also easier with Outlook 2011. 
Shown in Figure 6-11, calendar event creation gives you several options to 
customize and share your calendar events.
Likewise, the user interface and contact windows received an overhaul. You 
can arrange contacts by group and update contact information easily. The best 
candidates for using Microsoft Outlook are those who are comfortable with 
Outlook on Windows. Although developed by separate teams, the applications 
www.ebook777.com

have similar functions and workﬂ ows. With the improvements and modiﬁ cations 
in Outlook 2011, Microsoft now has a worthwhile alternative to the built-in 
calendar and contact management systems in Mac OS X.
Daylite
Daylite ($190 per user; www.marketcircle.com/daylite) is another 
integrated tool for managing your mail, contacts, calendar, and tasks. Shown 
in Figure 6-12, it is intended as a full-service business productivity application 
allowing you to manage a company's projects, sales, contacts, appointments, 
and e-mail. The Daylite system is fully networked, allowing users to access and 
modify data for other users. It can also be modiﬁ ed for particular industries. 
I've seen it used widely in the legal industry. It is also used in real estate, sales, 
manufacturing, and other businesses.
Team  calendaring is easy in Daylite. To schedule a meeting, you pick the 
co-workers you would like at a meeting and the calendar shows you who’s busy 
and when. The calendar in Daylite also includes project-planning components, 
allowing you to see key milestones for existing projects.
The contact database also works over your ofﬁ ce network. Everyone on the 
Daylite network can add and modify contacts. Daylite color-codes contacts by 
their relationship to the business, such as customers, employees, and vendors. 
With color coding, it is easy to ﬁ gure out who does what when looking through 
the contact list. Because the entire system is integrated, when you click on a 
contact, you can also see related appointments, tasks, e-mail, and notes to that 
contact.

Daylite’s project-management component allows you to deﬁ ne and manage 
projects and team members. There is also an  iPhone application that lets you 
access your Daylite database on the go.
Both Daylite and Outlook go far beyond mere contact and calendar 
management. Both products focus on collaboration and are particularly useful 
with teams of employees working on a single project.
SHIPPING WITH YOUR MAC
What if your business requires  shipping products to customers? You no 
longer need to spend your afternoons at the post ofﬁ ce. Software exists to 
purchase postage, process, ship, and track your packages.  Endicia (starts at 
$16 per month; www.endicia.com) is a reliable application for just this 
purpose. 
It is an approved vendor of the United States Postal Service and 
accommodates domestic and international shipping. You can customize your 
postage with your company logo and change your plan depending on your 
shipping volume. It works directly with the Mac OS X Address Book and, 
unlike several of its competitors, does not require a long-term contract.

Macs and 
Macs and 
Mobile Devices
Mobile Devices
M
obile technology has improved to such an extent that we no longer talk 
about phones and personal digital assistants ( PDAs). They’ve become 
pocket computers.  Mobile devices do so much more for us now that 
some speculate they may end up replacing our desktop and laptop computers 
entirely. Apple played no small part in this quiet revolution with the release of the 
iPhone and  iPad. Regardless, no matter which mobile device you use, there is a 
way to use it with your Mac.
iOS Devices  
Not surprisingly, Apple makes the mobile devices easiest to use with Apple 
computers: The iPhone, iPad, and  iPod Touch all run Apple’s  iOS mobile 
operating system. Although most synchronization between iOS devices and your 
Mac takes place through iTunes, there are limited wireless syncing options as well.
iTunes Sync
Originally designed to manage music libraries,  iTunes has now expanded 
far beyond its original intention. Figure 7-1 shows the iTunes synchronization 
interface for an iPhone. The options work the same for the iPod Touch and iPad.
You can select a speciﬁ c iOS device to manage in iTunes’ left sidebar. Only iOS 
devices currently plugged into your Mac appear in the Devices list. Clicking on the 
iPhone (named Trane in Figure 7-1) brings up the device in iTunes’ main window.
You manage your iOS device through a series of panes, accessed by clicking 
the names across the top of the window. The Summary pane, shown in Figure 
7-1, provides details concerning the selected device, including software version 
number, capacity, free space, and serial number. The Summary pane also provides 
options for synchronizing your iOS device with your Mac.
 ◗
Open iTunes when this iPhone is connected. This option is self-
explanatory: When you plug in your iOS device, iTunes starts.
 ◗
Sync only checked songs and videos. Every song and video file 
in iTunes has a check box next to it. Use this check box to manually 
synchronize music and video.
www.ebook777.com

 ◗
Prefer standard definition videos. If your library contains both 
high-definition and standard-definition videos, checking this option 
ensures that the smaller file sized standard versions are synchronized to 
your device. This option is usually a good idea because you are not likely 
to see the benefit of high definition on those small screens.
 ◗
Convert higher bit rate songs to 128 Kbps AAC. The conversion 
option allows you to reduce the file size of your  media files (this time, 
music) before being synchronized to your device and allows you to save 
space on your iOS device. Some users hear a big difference between 256 
Kbps and smaller 128 Kbps audio files. Others don’t. Decide for yourself.
 ◗
Manually manage music videos. This option allows you to avoid 
automatic synchronization entirely. Instead, you manually drag music 
and videos from your iTunes library to your iOS device.
 ◗
Encrypt iPhone  backup. If you’re concerned about the security of 
your iPhone data, you can encrypt the backup file. If this option is not 
checked, anyone with access to your Mac can open and inspect the 
contents of your iPhone backup file. Using an application such as iPhone 
Backup Extractor, covered later in this chapter, these users have access to 
all your backup files, including photographs, videos, media files, books, 
and other data stored on your iOS device.

You can also use the Info pane to sync contacts,   calendars, and e-mail 
between your Mac and your mobile device. If you’re not a  MobileMe subscriber, 
you can sync selected (or all) contacts, calendar, and e-mail account data directly 
to your iOS device using the Info pane. You can also sync your bookmarks to your 
iOS device. If you are a MobileMe subscriber, you do not need to sync through 
iTunes. Instead, you sync wirelessly via MobileMe (covered in Chapters 5 and 
6). Finally, you use the Info pane to reset data on your iOS device, including its 
contacts, calendars, mail accounts, and notes.
Use the Apps pane, shown in Figure 7-2, to organize and install applications 
on your iOS device. This pane also has a graphical representation of the screen 
layout on your iOS device. Working in this pane, you can rearrange screens and 
individual icons by clicking and dragging them in the graphical representation of 
your iOS device screens. Interestingly, you cannot buy apps in the Apps pane; the 
Apps pane manages the iOS applications you have already purchased. Instead, 
you purchase Apps from the iTunes Store menu (located in the left sidebar). 
Using the Apps pane, you can add and remove data from your iOS devices. 
If, for example, you use Pages on your iPad, you can copy Pages  documents to or 
from the iPad and open them with Pages on your Mac. There are many useful iOS 
applications that take advantage of the ability to drag and drop ﬁ les onto your 
mobile device.
www.ebook777.com

If, for example, you keep your records in PDF form (see Chapters 12 and 
19), you could use a PDF-reading application to copy or remove PDF ﬁ les on 
your iOS device. My favorite iPad application for this purpose is  Air Sharing 
($10; www.avatron.com/apps/air-sharing). To move ﬁ les back and forth, 
simply click and drag data ﬁ les from the Mac to the application’s ﬁ le window at 
the bottom of the Apps pane, shown in Figure 7-3. The applications that let you 
transfer ﬁ les require that the ﬁ les be in a particular format. Numbers for iPad, for 
example, requires that you transfer iWork Numbers (covered in Chapter 15) ﬁ les 
to your iPad. 
iTunes has several additional panes to let you customize the media on your 
iOS mobile device, including  ringtones, music, movies, TV shows, podcasts, and 
photos. They all work the same. You can set iTunes to automatically synchronize 
unwatched or new media. You can also synchronize speciﬁ c artists or albums. 
An often-overlooked pane is  iTunes U, which is a collection of university 
lectures available for free download to your iOS devices. Apple has partnered with 
universities all over the nation to make some remarkable lectures available for 
download. 
The  Books pane lets you load PDF and  ePub (the electronic book 
format iOS uses) ﬁ les directly to your mobile device as long as you have 
the iBooks application installed on the iOS device. Although the free Apple 

iBooks app is ﬁ ne for reference materials, a dedicated PDF viewer (like Air 
Sharing) is better for viewing indexed, highlighted, and annotated PDF ﬁ les. 
Dedicated PDF apps include additional features, such as the ability to view 
bookmarks and annotations, that you don’t get with iBooks.
Wireless syncing with iOS devices
iOS does not make it easy to wirelessly sync documents from the mobile 
device to your Mac. Some applications get around this problem using Web-based 
services like  Evernote and  SimpleNote (covered in Chapter 10). Others include 
direct integration with  Dropbox or  Box.net (covered in Chapter 21), allowing 
you to open and save ﬁ les directly from your cloud storage. All these applications 
rely on one trick or another to wirelessly sync documents. Although Apple has 
yet to provide a complete wireless syncing tool, it is moving in that direction. 
For example, you can synchronize Pages, Numbers, and Keynote ﬁ les on an iPad 
directly with your MobileMe cloud storage.
Dangers of  file-sharing
Whether you are sharing ﬁ les directly through iTunes or e-mailing yourself 
copies, you always end up with multiple copies of the data. For example, copying 
a document from your iPad does not remove the document from your iPad. 
Likewise, e-mailing a copy leaves the original on the iPad. Instead of syncing 
the ﬁ le, you are copying it. You end up with two copies of the document: one on 
your Mac, and one on the iPad. If you continue to copy the same ﬁ le, you will 
end up with a folder full of versions of the same document. If you’re not careful, 
you can accidentally make changes to or delete the wrong version. When you 
have multiple copies, be careful.
BACKING UP 
Every time you connect an iOS device to your Mac, iTunes makes a 
backup of all the data. This is really convenient if something goes wrong with 
your hardware. If you lose your phone, you can get a new one and restore 
your data from the backup. 
Once in a while, you may not want to restore an iOS device from a 
backup but still need some of the data from the backup ﬁ le. There is a 
donation-supported application called iPhone Backup Extractor (www.
supercrazyawesome.com) for just this purpose. iPhone Backup 
Extractor lets you open your iOS device backup ﬁ le and extract individual ﬁ les.

The Missing Sync for iPhone
If you are using an iOS device, you’re probably ﬁ ne doing all your syncing 
through iTunes. There are, however, other options. Mark/Space is an application 

developer that specializes in synchronizing mobile devices with computers. It 
has applications to help transfer data from most popular smartphones to a Mac. 
Several of its products are the best tools for syncing mobile devices to Macs.
The Missing Sync for iPhone ($40; www.markspace.com), shown in Figure 
7-4, adds a few features not available with iTunes sync. It has its own ringtone 
editor, allowing you to make custom ringtones. You can sync  notes from the 
Apple iOS Notes app directly to Entourage, Yojimbo, or Mark/Space’s own Notes 
application. The Migration Assistant lets you transfer contacts, and other data 
from older smartphones to your new iPhone. You can also archive text messages 
and call history. You can even save visual voicemail messages to your Mac. 
Other Devices
Not everyone uses Apple mobile devices, and for a long time, syncing 
phones and PDAs to a Mac was an odyssey of pain and suffering. Phone and 
PDA manufacturers treated Mac synchronization software as an afterthought (at 
best) — and it showed. But things are looking better for Mac workers these days: 
Hardware manufacturers are showing their respect for the Mac’s increasing market 
share by releasing better syncing software for their devices and Mac OS X. Several 
application developers have also entered the fray, developing their own tools.
BlackBerry and the Mac
Research in Motion’s free Mac syncing software (http://na.blackberry.
com/eng/services/desktop/desktop_mac.jsp) for its BlackBerry devices 
is a lot better than it used to be. It allows you to back up your device and manage 
the installation and removal of applications. It syncs with Microsoft Entourage 
(Outlook 2011 support is in the works), iCal, and Address Book. It also syncs 
iTunes playlists.
If the  BlackBerry application isn’t enough, try  The Missing Sync for 
BlackBerry ($45; www.markspace.com). Shown in Figure 7-5, The Missing 
Sync for BlackBerry lets you sync via a USB-to-MicroUSB cable or  Bluetooth. 
In addition to syncing contacts, calendars, and tasks, you can sync music and 
movies. You can transfer (and view) Word and Excel documents from your Mac 
to your BlackBerry. The Missing Sync also lets you archive text messages and call 
history. You can synchronize BlackBerry notes with Entourage, Yojimbo, or The 
Missing Sync for Mark/Space’s own Notes application. 
Android and the Mac
Google’s   Android mobile platform is gaining popularity as several handset 
manufacturers adopt it. Because Android does most of its syncing through your 
www.ebook777.com

Google account, many of the traditional syncing problems are already solved. 
Google Android relies on  Gmail (covered in Chapter 5),  Google Contacts, and 
Google Calendar (both covered in Chapter 6) to keep your data in sync. Once 
you enter your Google account name and password on your Android device, 
Google does all the heavy lifting for your e-mail, contacts, and calendars. Google 
Android even pushes software updates to the handset. As a result, many Android 
owners never sync their handsets to their computers. 
For the Android owners who want to sync their devices, getting music and 
media ﬁ les on your handset takes a little more work.  Salling Media Sync for Mac 
($22; www.salling.com/mediasync/mac) lets you copy  music, podcasts, 
and photos from your Mac to your Android device. Salling Media Sync shows the 
remaining capacity of your device and lets you sync all media or selected playlists 
(including iTunes Genius mixes). If you make  smart playlists in iTunes, Salling 
Media Sync syncs them as well.
If you just want to sync music, videos, and photos, Salling Media Sync is 
probably all you need. If you need to sync more data, use The  Missing Sync for 
Android ($40; www.markspace.com). Shown in Figure 7-6, it works over USB, 
Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, although for large ﬁ le transfers using a USB-to-MicroUSB 
cable is still much faster. The Proximity Sync feature automatically (and 
wirelessly) syncs your Android device when you are near your computer. 
In addition to syncing music, podcasts, and pictures, The Missing Sync also 
downloads your other personal data. Calendars can be synced with Outlook, 

Entourage, and iCal. Likewise, your contact database can be synced with Outlook 
and Apple Address Book. If you want to back up your call history, text messages, 
or Android Notes, The Missing Sync does that too. 
Windows Mobile, Windows Phone 7, and the Mac
Microsoft has released a beta tool for Mac users that lets them synchronize 
some data from its Windows Phone 7 mobile devices. Mark/Space also plans to 
release a version of The Missing Sync that supports  Windows Phone 7 on the Mac.
Some Mac workers still carry around  Windows Mobile (the predecessor to 
Windows Phone 7) devices, of which many models are in use. If your Windows 
Mobile smartphone does not have native support for Mac syncing, try  The 
Missing Sync for Windows Mobile ($40; www.markspace.com). It supports 
most Windows Mobile phones, including the HTC Touch, Samsung Omnia, Sony 
Ericsson Xperia, and  Palm Treo W series.
The Missing Sync for Windows Mobile syncs calendars, contacts, music, 
pictures, and video. It works with Entourage, the Mac OS X Address Book, and iCal. 
It also lets you sync Word and Excel documents to your Windows Mobile phone. 
The Missing Sync for Windows Mobile lets you synchronize via Bluetooth or USB.
WebOS and the Mac
There was a running battle between  Palm and Apple over how to sync the 
WebOS-based Palm Pre and Palm Pixi smartphones: Palm’s engineers ﬁ gured out 
how to sync directly with iTunes, even though Apple didn’t permit such direct 
syncing — so Apple changed iTunes to block such syncing, Palm ﬁ gured out how 
to get around it, and Apple found a way to block that end run. 
Things have calmed down, especially since Hewlett-Packard purchased Palm, 
but if you are using a Palm Pre or Pixi, look into  The Missing Sync for Palm Pre 
($40; www.markspace.com). Using it, you can sync music, photos, ringtones, 
and your contact and calendar data to your Mac.
Other devices
There are several other mobile devices still in use. If your device doesn’t have 
acceptable software for the Mac, look at Mark/Space’s offerings. In addition to the 
applications mentioned earlier, Mark/Space also has Mac-based The Missing Sync 
software for  Palm OS, Nokia’s  Symbian OS, and the Sony PSP.
With Mac OS X’s recent success and corresponding growth in market share, 
just about any mobile device that ﬁ ts in your pocket can now talk to your Mac.

Talking to 
Talking to 
Your Mac
Your Mac
I I 
have used  speech recognition software for nearly 10 years. I started with 
Dragon Dictate version 1, which required me to pause … between … every … 
word. Speech recognition has come a long way since those days. Unfortunately, 
the advances were primarily on the Windows platform. Until recently, the best 
way to get speech recognition was by loading Windows on your Mac (see Chapter 
22) and running Nuance’s Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows. Fortunately, 
that has changed.
Mac OS X Speech Tools
Mac OS X has its own speech tools in the  Speech system preference, shown in 
Figure 8-1. Using the Speech Recognition settings, you can set your Mac to accept 
basic verbal commands to control your Mac. You can also set your Mac to speak 
commands when you mouse over them, which is helpful for users with visual 
impairment. Although these tools are not a dictation solution, they do give you 
some voice control. However, even for voice control, the native speech command 
support in the Speech system preference is not as extensive as the Command 
Mode in Dragon Dictate, covered later in this chapter.
The Speech system preference’s Text to Speech tab lets you choose a voice 
and speaking rate for the Mac OS X system voice, which can be a useful tool 
for proofreading. The default voice, Alex, sounds the most natural. In all 
applications that allow access to Mac OS X  services (the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Suite 
does not support Mac OS X services), you can select a block of text and, by 
Control+clicking or right-clicking it, play back the text as speech, as shown in 
Figure 8-2.
Dragon Dictate
Dragon Dictate for Mac ($199; www.macspeech.com), shown in Figure 
8-3, is published by Nuance, the same people who pioneered speech dictation 
on Windows PCs. With Dragon Dictate for Mac, Nuance brings its 10 years of 
www.ebook777.com

dictation experience to the Mac, ﬁ nally giving Mac users a legitimate speech-
recognition tool.
Repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome are a real danger 
for computer users, so many users are attracted to voice dictation to help avoid 
injury: Talking into your Mac is much easier on your ﬁ ngers and wrists than 
typing for extended periods. 

An additional beneﬁ t is speed: If you spend time learning to dictate to your 
computer, you will be surprised how fast you can enter text. I’m a touch typist 
and still dictate much faster than I type.
Dragon Dictate includes a speech-friendly noise-canceling microphone. 
Although the software’s installation takes a while (you need to install both the 
application and vocabulary ﬁ les), it is not difﬁ cult. Once installed, the initial 
training takes about 15 minutes: Dragon Dictate sets your microphone volume 
and walks you through a short dictation training session where you read aloud 
an explanation of how to dictate. This helps you understand the basics and at the 
same time gives your Mac the voice samples required to create your voice proﬁ le, 
the ﬁ le Dragon Dictate creates based on your voice and dictation style. 
After the initial training, the speech recognition accuracy is surprisingly good. 
To further reﬁ ne your voice proﬁ le, there are additional training modules you can 
use once you get more comfortable with Dragon Dictate. 
Dictating to your Mac
The Dragon Dictate interface consists of a series of information panes that 
you can turn off or on in the application’s window settings. The Status window, 
shown in Figure 8-4, indicates when the microphone is on, the application’s 
interpretation of your most recently dictated text, and indicators for dictation, 
command, and other modes. 
www.ebook777.com

The Available Commands window, shown in Figure 8-5, provides a list of 
commands you can use. The application has global commands (meaning that 
they available throughout the operating system), dictation commands (relating 
to the dictation of text), and application-speciﬁ c commands for the current 
application. For example, when working in TextEdit, Dragon Dictate provides 
a list of possible TextEdit commands. (I ﬁ nd  TextEdit the best application for 
dictating text.) The application-speciﬁ c commands must be built speciﬁ cally 
for the application; although Dragon Dictate does not have application speciﬁ c 
commands for every application, it does cover several of the most common Mac 
OS X applications. 
The Recognition window, shown in Figure 8-6, is opened in the Dragon 
Dictate Preferences dialog box or via the voice command “Open recognition 
window.” This window takes your most recently dictated text and provides a list 
of alternative transcriptions of your dictation. You can select one of the alternative 
transcriptions when MacSpeech makes a mistake. If you select an alternative 
transcription, Dragon Dictate will make note of the change and adjust your voice 
proﬁ le accordingly.
Although you can dictate text into any word processing application, it is best 
to use Mac OS X’s built-in TextEdit for your ﬁ rst draft because Dragon Dictate’s 
support for TextEdit is superb. You can easily make any text dictated in TextEdit 
into plain text (choose Format ➧ Make Plain Text) and copy and paste it into your 
application of choice.
When editing text with Dragon Dictate for Mac, you can select words with 
your voice. You just say “Select” then say the words you want to select. You can 
then dictate the words you want to replace the selected text. You can also say 
things like “Put parentheses around” and “Capitalize that” for selected text. 
Alternatively, you can say “Correct” and add the words you need to correct. 

Dragon Dictate then gives you correction options. Every time you correct your 
text, Dragon Dictate remembers what you did and gets smarter for the next time. 
The more you use Dragon Dictate for Mac, the better the dictation gets. 
Because Dragon Dictate keeps track of the words typed and where the cursor 
should be, if you move the cursor with the keyboard while editing with your 
voice, Dragon Dictate gets confused. To avoid this, speak the “Cache document” 
command; Dragon Dictate reviews the entire text of your dictated document and 
refreshes its memory as to where all your words ﬁ t. Because you will inevitably 
make changes using your keyboard, the Dragon Dictate memory buffer becomes 
confused again until you again speak the ”Cache document” command. This is 
another reason to use TextEdit: Dragon Dictate automatically caches text you have 
in TextEdit so you don’t have to keep repeating the “Cache document” command.
Although Dragon Dictate works well out of the box with minimal training, 
the application really ﬁ nds its legs when you complete the additional training 
modules and learn the voice commands. For example, instead of fumbling with 
your scroll wheel in a document, just say, “Go to beginning.” The “Train the 
word“ voice command lets you add words to the Dragon Dictate library. If you 
change your mind halfway through a sentence, just stop and say “Scratch that.” 
MacSpeech then erases your last dictation, and you can start over.
Dictating dates, deleting words, and changing capitalization all can be 
accomplished with speciﬁ c voice commands. Dragon Dictate gives you a lot of 
power over your text, but you must know the proper commands to wield it. When 
ﬁ rst learning Dragon Dictate, keep the Available Commands window open to 
display the available commands for the applications you are using. Once you 
memorize the commands, your dictation will go faster. Spending a few hours 
learning Dragon Dictate signiﬁ cantly increases its usefulness.
In addition to learning the Dragon Dictate commands, you also need to train 
yourself. Don’t mumble or skip words; Dragon Dictate relies on the context of 
your words to work. 
Starting a sentence without an idea of how it is going to end doesn’t work, 
either; all dictation engines work best when you give some thought to what you 
www.ebook777.com

are going to say before speaking. When doing extended dictation, ﬁ rst create an 
outline. I use  OmniOutliner. Looking at an outline helps keep the dictation clear 
and on point. 
Once you have your thoughts composed, sit up straight and dictate as if you 
were Walter Cronkite. Using a deliberate, steady dictation voice goes a long way in 
improving dictation accuracy. 
A common mistake is speaking too slowly. When you dictate too slowly, 
Dragon Dictate may break individual syllables into separate words. If you want to 
take your time, pause between sentences while composing. 
I also upgraded my dictation microphone. I use a  Plantronics Calisto Pro 
Bluetooth  microphone ($90; www.plantronics.com). Although the audio 
quality is not as good as with a wired microphone, the freedom from a cord 
is liberating. If you decide to upgrade your microphone, make certain Dragon 
Dictate supports it — not all microphones are compatible.
Another important bit of advice when dictating: Proofread. Don’t just read it 
back once. Print the draft and get out your trusty red pen. As fantastic as dictation 
technology is, it sometimes makes mistakes, and those mistakes are difﬁ cult to 
catch. “Relevant” may be transcribed as “Irrelevant.” “He” might become “She.” 
Save yourself some embarrassment and keep a sharp eye out when proofreading 
dictated text.
Using voice commands
Using the Command mode, Dragon Dictate can also operate your Mac. 
You can do just about anything on your Mac, including launching applications, 
opening new ﬁ les, and saving documents. With practice, the Command mode can 
take the place of several mouse clicks and key presses and is particularly helpful 
for users with disabilities. 
In addition to using Dragon Dictate to command your Mac, you can also use 
it to search the Web. For example, you could say, “Search the Web for MacSparky” 
to make Dragon Dictate open your default Web browser and perform a Google 
search.
Again, this functionality is slightly more rough around the edges than its 
Windows counterpart. Dragon Dictate is not yet at the point where you can 
simply sit back and drive your Mac without any keyboard and mouse interaction.
Vocabulary Editor
 Dragon Dictate’s Vocabulary Editor, shown in Figure 8-7, allows you to 
customize the Dragon Dictate dictionary by adding frequently used words and 
phrases. When adding speciﬁ c words or phrases to the vocabulary editor, be 
certain to repeat them several times for increased accuracy. Also, you don’t have 

to add just individual words as dictionary entries. For example, you could add 
the name “Mr. Hank Morgan” as a single vocabulary entry. After you train Dragon 
Dictate with a longer phrase, it is unlikely Dragon Dictate will get it wrong.
In addition to adding particular phrases, you can also have Dragon Dictate 
scan documents you specify on your Mac to pull out new words. This signiﬁ cantly 
increases recognition. 
Speech recognition also increases with usage. Once you get comfortable 
with the application and have reﬁ ned your voice ﬁ le, you will get better accuracy. 
This improved accuracy is most noticeable with the little things, like plurals and 
possessives.
The processing power required to recognize and transcribe spoken words 
is signiﬁ cant. Dragon Dictate can use more than 1GB of active memory. On an 
older Mac or one without sufﬁ cient memory, the program can hang or even crash. 
However, if your work requires lots of writing, you will appreciate Dragon Dictate. 
Sitting back in your chair and dictating while the words appear on screen feels 
like something out of the future.
There is no competition to Dragon Dictate on Mac OS X. The only other 
viable alternative is to load Windows through a virtual machine and run  Dragon 
NaturallySpeaking, which has the same dictation engine but a slightly better 
editing interface and more features. Because running Windows is a signiﬁ cant 
burden on your system memory and processor, it is not worth the trouble. I’ve 
used Dragon Dictate and its  MacSpeech Dictate predecessor on my Mac as my 
only dictation tool for more than a year without regret.
In addition to the basic version of Dragon Dictate, which is sufﬁ cient for 
most users, there are vocabulary-enhanced, higher-priced editions for doctors 
and lawyers, as well as an international edition. The legal and medical editions 
cost $600 each, and the international edition costs $300. Whether you need one 
www.ebook777.com

of the professional editions depends on how much you need their specialized 
dictionaries. The basic application can learn new words and already has a good 
dictionary of basic medical and legal jargon. 
MacSpeech Scribe
Although Dragon Dictate is great for dictating while sitting at your Mac, what 
if you want to dictate when you are not at your computer? Nuance, the maker 
of Dragon Dictate, has a separate product for translating previously recorded 

dictation called  MacSpeech Scribe ($149; www.macspeech.com/scribe). Using 
MacSpeech Scribe, you can turn recorded audio into text. 
Training MacSpeech Scribe involves making a recording (at least two 
minutes long) of your voice reading text and loading the resulting audio ﬁ le. 
MacSpeech Scribe transcribes the ﬁ rst 15 seconds of the recording and displays 
its transcription in a window where you can compare the recording to the 
transcribed words and make corrections, as shown in Figure 8-8. Learning from 
its mistakes, the program starts over. The initial training takes about 20 minutes. 
Once you are ﬁ nished, MacSpeech Scribe can transcribe future recordings.
The supported audio formats are AIFF, WAV, M4V, MP4, and M4A. Strangely, 
MacSpeech Scribe does not support the widely used  MP3 format. You can use 
any electronic recorder that saves in an approved format, but the better quality 
recorders provide better transcription. Interestingly, the iPhone’s Voice Memo 
recorder application makes a clear recording that is a good starting point for 
MacSpeech Scribe. 
MacSpeech Scribe’s interface is simple, as Figure 8-9 shows. Because 
MacSpeech Scribe does not have to work inside other Mac OS X applications as 
Dragon Dictate does, it does not require as many tools. You can review the text 
and make corrections. When done, copy and paste the completed text wherever it 
belongs. 
MacSpeech Scribe frees you from your computer and is well suited to longer 
dictation projects. Although not having the immediate feedback of seeing your 
words appear on the screen can be disconcerting, it also removes the distraction. 
Again, there are enhanced versions for the legal and medical professionals for an 
additional $99 each. 
If you want to dictate to your Mac, I recommend you try Dragon Dictate ﬁ rst. 
Having the on-screen feedback helps reﬁ ne your dictation skills. Once you master 
Dragon Dictate, moving to MacSpeech Scribe should not be difﬁ cult.

Task 
Task 
Management
Management
I I 
am a believer in keeping task lists. I would like to say this arises from some 
inherent sense of order and organization. In truth, however, it arises from 
my realization that I am scatterbrained and often have the attention span of 
a goldﬁ sh. As a result, if I cannot do something immediately, I write it down. 
Dumping tasks into a list is liberating. When my tasks are on a list, I don’t forget 
them. When I was a student, I had a really simple task-management system. Every 
morning I’d eat my cereal and write on a napkin the three things I needed to 
accomplish that day and then put it in my pocket. It worked brilliantly.
Today my responsibilities have expanded, exponentially. I have personal and 
professional commitments that affect many people. At any time, I have many 
plates in the air and if any of them crash to the ground, it is a problem. As I write 
this sentence, I have 1,713 tasks stored in 257 projects. Although this sounds 
completely insane, I have it under control thanks to the tools I cover in this 
chapter. 
This chapter gets into the nitty-gritty of the best available tools for task 
management on the Mac. The focus is managing your tasks; managing your team 
is covered in Chapter 17.
Task-Management Fundamentals
Before diving in, let’s cover some fundamentals of how a task-management 
 system should work. There are four pieces to serious task management: capture, 
organize, process, and review. Putting these ideas in perspective will help later 
when I explain the task management options on the Mac.
Capture
The purpose of a task-management system is to avoid having tasks fall 
through the cracks. As the number of tasks increases, the ability to keep them 
in your head becomes increasingly difﬁ cult. A task-management system needs 
to make it easy to record new tasks as they occur to you. If you are working on 
a report and remember you need to buy spicy carrots, you should be able to 
capture that task and return your attention to your report. Getting from brain to 
www.ebook777.com

paper should require a minimum of fuss. Otherwise, you wait to capture that task 
and, quite often, forget entirely about it until something goes wrong. All the tools 
covered in this chapter have capture capabilities. 
But capture doesn’t need to happen on your Mac. Of all the task-
management fundamentals, capture is the one that can be accomplished without 
digital assistance. Many people use a notebook or a pocket recorder, for example, 
to capture tasks and later add them to their Mac’s task-management software.
Organize
Once you’ve captured your tasks, you next need to organize them and your 
Mac can be a big help. Traditionally, task lists are organized by date or project. 
Modern task management strategies expand these criteria to also include priority 
(using a grading system, ﬂ ags, or other mechanism) and context (for example, 
differentiating tasks that can be completed on the phone versus those that can be 
completed on the computer). A Mac and task-management software can make 
organization much easier.
Process
The big payoff with a task list is completing the tasks. Working through the 
list and checking off items is the purpose of the exercise. Software tools again can 
be helpful for sorting and presenting your task list and then getting out of the way 
so you can get work done.
Review
The best task-management tools have a system to allow you to audit your 
tasks and make sure you are not missing anything. An audit system is that one 
last safety net keeping those plates from hitting the ﬂ oor.
The trick with setting up a task-management system is to make it as complex 
as you need it to be and not a single bit more complex than that. When in law 
school, my napkin task list was perfect: I captured and organized every morning, 
I processed the tasks throughout the day, and I audited my list every night when 
I emptied my pockets. Now I have many more responsibilities, so the napkin no 
longer cuts it. 
It is easy to let a task-management system take over. For some people, it 
becomes a form of procrastination, where they spend hours a day making their 
list and accomplishing very little work. When looking at the options in this 
chapter, think about your needs and ﬁ nd the system that gives you as much 
complexity as you require but doesn’t get in the way of completing your work. 
After all, the point of task management is task completion.

Task-Management Software
Until the last few years, the state of task-management software on the 
Mac was dismal. Fortunately, however, there has been an explosion of task 
management tools for Mac OS X. This chapter covers some of the most useful 
tools in their order of complexity, starting with the simplest, iCal.
iCal tasks
iCal, the free calendar application that ships on every new Mac, includes a 
built-in task manager. iCal calls tasks to-do items, and they can be added to the 
right pane in the iCal window, as shown in Figure 9-1. (If that To-Do Lists pane is 
not displayed, choose View ➧ Show To-Do List or press Option+J+T to display it.)
You create a new to-do item in iCal by double-clicking the To-Do List pane 
or pressing J+K. Adding  to-do items to the list just requires that you type in the 
name of the to-do task, such as “Call Smith Client.” You can add further data to 
www.ebook777.com

your to-do item by double-clicking on the to-do item (or selecting it and pressing 
J+I). This calls up the  to-do info window shown in Figure 9-2.
In the to-do info window, you can rename a task and mark it as completed. 
You can set a task’s priority level choosing low, medium, high, or no priority. 
You can optionally set a due date or alarm for your to-do item. If you have more 
information about your to-do item, you can use the Note ﬁ eld. There is also a 
URL ﬁ eld into which you can copy a Web site’s address.
iCal lets you attach a  to-do item to a speciﬁ c calendar. You assign to-do’s to 
calendars in the info window or by Control+clicking or right-clicking the to-do 
item in the To-Do List pane. Assigning to-dos to calendars can be useful if you 
have separate iCal calendars for different areas of responsibility. You may have 
distinct calendars for work and personal items. By attaching your to-do items to 
the appropriate calendars, you can turn off the display of certain tasks by hiding 
the afﬁ liated calendar. For example, you could, upon arriving in the ofﬁ ce deselect 
your personal calendar (by unchecking the box for your personal calendar in 
iCal’s left pane) to hide your personal to-do items. You can take this method to 
another level by making custom calendars for each work project. If you have a 
separate calendar for each major client, you can ﬁ lter your to-do list by selecting 
(and deselecting) calendars.
You can display your to-do items  in order of priority, due date, title 
(alphabetically), or calendar. You can also organize them manually dragging tasks 
into your own pecking order.
Adding to-do items to iCal requires loading iCal and adding them directly 
to the application. If you use an  Exchange server, you can sync to-do items to 
iCal. Strangely, Apple does not have an iOS to-do app and there is no way to sync 
to-do items to your  iPhone,  iPad, or iPod Touch using iTunes. Using   MobileMe, 
you can save the To-Do items to an IMAP mail account, which then syncs to the 
Mail iOS application on your mobile device in the Apple To Do mailbox. The 
whole process is unintuitive and un-Apple. If you want to sync to-do items to an 
iOS device, move on to one of the other options in this chapter. 
Likewise, organizing your tasks by calendar can become tedious, requiring 
multiple mouse clicks for each item. iCal to-do lists also do not allow you to 
create recurring  tasks. If you want to prepare a staff meeting agenda every Monday 
morning, you need to create a new to-do item; you cannot simply create one and 
set it to repeat every week. Organizing your tasks from one big list is ﬁ ne if you 
only have a few dozen to-dos, but if you have hundreds, it is unworkable.
It is easy to poke holes in Apple’s to-do management. However, if your task 
management needs are small, iCal may work for you. It would have been a ﬁ ne 
replacement for my napkin 20 years ago in school. Remember: The point is not to 
spend your time managing your task list but instead completing tasks.

Remember the Milk
There is a growing crop of Web-based  task-management services. These allow 
you to create your task lists in the Internet cloud and access them from connected 
computers and mobile devices. A Web-based tool is convenient for mobile Mac 
workers because it allows access to task lists from  iPhones, Macs, PCs, and other 
Internet-connected devices.
One of the leaders in this space is  Remember the Milk (free; www.
rememberthemilk.com). Shown in Figure 9-3, Remember the Milk allows you 
to create and manage tasks through your Web browser. In addition to creating 
tasks, you can set due dates, priorities, and time estimates. 
Remember the Milk uses intelligent data recognition to make entering dates 
easier. For example, if you want an item to be due in three weeks, you type 3 
weeks in the Due ﬁ eld and Remember the Milk calculates the date for you. It also 
interprets days of the week, like “Next Tuesday.” Remember the Milk supports 
recurring tasks; if you want a task to repeat every three days, type 3 days in the 
Repeat ﬁ eld. Remember the Milk also lets you tag your task items with keywords 
to make searching easier.
The interface uses a tab system to keep tasks in different projects. You can 
create tabs for each project. This works well if your project list isn’t too large. After 
you have nine projects entered, the Interface starts adding additional rows of tabs. 
After you have about 20 projects, the interface gets noisy. 
www.ebook777.com

Because it is Web-based, Remember the Milk can send reminders to your 
Internet-connected devices with e-mail, SMS, and instant message accounts. 
Remember the Milk gives you an e-mail address with every new account. You can 
e-mail tasks to this address to have them automatically added to your task list. 
Although this gives you a way to capture tasks from your mobile device, stopping 
to write an e-mail every time you think of a new task isn’t efﬁ cient. There are 
mobile Remember the Milk applications for iPhone, Android, BlackBerry, and 
Windows Mobile devices to put your list in your pocket.
The basic Remember the Milk service is free, but for $25 per year you can get 
a Pro account that gives priority e-mail support and has better syncing and push 
notiﬁ cations with the mobile device applications. 
The big advantage of a Web-based tool occurs when you are working on both 
Macs and Windows PCs. Because everything is browser-based, you can access and 
modify your task lists from either operating system using a Web-based service like 
Remember the Milk. 
This marriage to the browser is also Remember the Milk’s biggest 
disadvantage. It does not have the polish that you get with a native Mac OS X 
application. Remember the Milk has tried to compensate with extensive 
keyboard shortcuts to streamline the service, but it still feels uniquely un-Mac-
like compared to other task management applications. Regardless, Web-based 
task management applications are only going to become more sophisticated and 
polished over time. This is one to watch.
Things
Things ($50; http://culturedcode.com/things) is one of the most 
widely adopted task-management applications on the Mac. Things, shown in 
Figure 9-4, excels at the software design principles Mac users love. It has a simple 
interface but includes sufﬁ cient features to handle the task-management needs of 
many Mac workers. 
The Things application window uses the familiar Mac OS X left-and-right-
pane format, where the left pane includes a source list of projects and search 
criteria and the right pane holds the task list. There is also a toolbar on the 
bottom of the task window.
The interface is clean, and you can immediately start using the application. 
All the information for each task is included in each task entry. There is no 
inspector.
There are several ways to create tasks in Things. Perhaps the easiest is by 
clicking the New  Task iconic button in the lower-left section of the toolbar. You 
are then presented the screen view shown in Figure 9-4. The top line holds the 
name of your new task. The check box to the left of the name allows you to mark 

the task as completed. You can optionally assign tags in the second line and add 
notes to your task item in the Notes ﬁ eld. The bottom line lets you assign a due 
date to the task. If you assign a due date, you are given the option to assign a start 
date relative to the due date. For example, you can have a task not appear until 
three days before the due date.
Things also has a Quick Entry panel that is activated with a keyboard 
shortcut (the default is Control+spacebar), shown in Figure 9-5. The Quick 
Entry panel opens in the middle of the screen without requiring you to exit your 
current application and enter Things, although Things must be running in the 
background. You type in your new task and any tags, notes, and due dates, then 
press Return. The task is automatically added to Things. You can also add Web 
pages, e-mails, and ﬁ les to the tasks by dragging them into the Quick Entry panel.
Once you start building your list of task items, you’ll  need to organize them. 
Things’ primary means of organization is the use of descriptive tags. To edit a 
task’s tags, reopen it (by double-clicking it, by selecting it and clicking the Edit 
iconic button in the toolbar, or by selecting it and pressing Return) and add 
www.ebook777.com

descriptions in the Tags ﬁ eld. Things includes a set of pre-deﬁ ned tags accessed by 
clicking the + iconic button at the right side of the Tags ﬁ eld. The predeﬁ ned tags 
include contexts (work, home, and errand), priority (low, medium, and high), 
duration (15 minutes and one hour), and difﬁ culty (easy and challenge). You can 
add your own custom tags to this list. You can also create new tags by typing them 
in the tag ﬁ eld of any task item.
Because you can apply multiple tags to a task, you can create as many 
indices as you can handle. For example, a task item to write a contract can 
include tags with the name of the client, the name of the project, the project 
priority, the people involved, and the estimated time. It is important when you 
start using Things that you structure your tags to be manageable. If you start 
creating different tags for every task item, the tags become useless as an indexing 
tool. Once you have a tag system in place, you can quickly drill into your task 
list by selecting speciﬁ c tags. So long as you spend time thinking about the tag 
descriptions, tagging is an effective way to manage tasks.
Whatever task-management system you embrace, you do not want to start 
every day facing a list of all your future uncompleted tasks. For some people 
(myself included), the whole list could number in the thousands. To keep 
your task list from including all your future task items every day, Things has a 
Scheduled list. When you drag a task into the Scheduled list, Things prompts you 
to choose a date. That task then disappears from your task list until the scheduled 
date. Things also has a Someday list where you can drag tasks that you are not 
ready to start but want to review again in the future.
Tasks in Things can also be organized into projects by dragging a task into the 
Projects list. You can then input additional tasks for a speciﬁ c project, as shown 
in Figure 9-6. Projects in Things can be ﬂ agged as active or inactive. All active 

projects are displayed in the left pane. Keeping the Project list on screen works 
great if you have 10 to 15 projects. But if you have 200 projects, it becomes a 
mess.
The Next list shows you the next few tasks available for every project. As you 
check off those items, additional tasks from the project will appear. You can then 
scroll through the list of projects, pick the tasks you want to complete, and get to 
work. You can also type in some task tags to further narrow the available task list 
for easier management in the Next list.
One of the easiest ways to prioritize tasks with Things is to drag the tasks 
you want to complete onto the Today list. The Today list holds all the tasks you 
drag onto it and automatically adds any tasks with an active start date or from 
the Scheduled list set for the current day. You can then spend the rest of the 
day completing the Today list tasks. Once you complete a task, it is sent to the 
Logbook, found on the lower portion of the left pane. You can open the Logbook 
and view your completed tasks. While in the Logbook, you can mark a task as 
uncompleted and it will return to its project.
Things also has dedicated  iPhone and  iPad applications. But syncing requires 
that your mobile devices be on the same wireless network as your Mac. You 
cannot, for example, update your iPhone’s tasks while at the coffee shop using its 
Wi-Fi hot spot.
There is no review mechanism built into Things. Although you can review 
your tasks in total, there is no way to set different review periods for each project.
You will know within 30 minutes if Things is right for you. The application 
works straight out of the box with little need for customization. In my opinion, 
it is the best “install and go” task-management system on the Mac. I’ve set up 
Things for many Mac workers who are efﬁ ciently keeping up with their task list. 
But for the most comprehensive task-management system, look at OmniFocus.
OmniFocus
OmniFocus ($80; www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), is the most 
powerful task manager covered in this chapter. Where most task-management 
applications are built with a planned workﬂ ow in mind for users, OmniFocus, 
shown in Figure 9-7, includes numerous task-management tools so you can make 
the application as simple (or complex) as you choose.
Collecting tasks and sorting your Inbox
As you go about your day, new task  items might occur. You want to quickly 
enter those items into OmniFocus so you can clear your mind of that item and 
get back to work. With OmniFocus, you enter tasks in the inbox, shown in Figure 
9-7. Accessed from within OmniFocus by clicking the Inbox iconic button in the 
www.ebook777.com

toolbar or pressing Option+J+1, the inbox presents a list of all your new and 
unassigned tasks. If you are brainstorming about a project, the inbox is a great 
place to quickly get your tasks into the system. You enter new tasks by typing the 
task description and pressing Return. 
The inbox is not the only way to collect tasks. OmniFocus has a Quick Entry 
panel that can be activated from anywhere in Mac OS X with a key combination; 
the default is Control+Option+spacebar. The Quick Entry panel, shown in Figure 
9-8, then appears on your screen and you can type in a new task. For this panel to 
work, OmniFocus needs to be running in the background. Like Things, the Quick 
Entry panel lets you add new tasks quickly and return to your work. There is no 
need to switch applications or break your concentration. You can conﬁ gure the 
Quick Entry panel so you just enter a task’s description or you can add additional 
details such as start and end dates, context, project, and ﬂ ag status. 
OmniFocus also lets you automate task collection with  clippings. Using the 
Preferences dialog box’s Clipping pane, you can deﬁ ne a keyboard shortcut (I use 
Control+Option+J+C) that, when activated, takes any selected text and creates 
a new task. For example, you could select text on a Web page and activate the 
clipping shortcut to automatically save that selected text to OmniFocus.
The Clipping pane also lets you install a  clipping service in Apple Mail, called 
the  Clip-o-Tron 3000, that automates clipping e-mails. You can click any e-mail 
message (or group of e-mail messages) and, by activating your clipping keyboard 
shortcut, drop the e-mail into OmniFocus as a new task. The task will include the 
entire text of the e-mail and a link that you can later click to reopen the e-mail 
in Apple Mail. This is a great solution for dealing with e-mail that requires later 

action: It gives you a reliable way to track the e-mail and lets you ﬁ le the original 
out of your e-mail inbox. (For more information on integrating tasks with e-mail, 
see Chapter 5.) OmniFocus can also use Apple Mail rules to add  tasks from 
incoming e-mail to the OmniFocus Inbox. You can, for example, send yourself an 
e-mail about taking the dog to the vet and it will appear in OmniFocus.
When you are on the road, you can add tasks to OmniFocus with the  iPhone 
and  iPad applications. Both mobile apps have an easily accessed inbox that sync 
to your Mac.
Once your tasks are collected in the OmniFocus inbox, you can add  notes 
and attachments to the tasks. I scan most important documents that come my 
way and drop them into OmniFocus as an attachment to their corresponding 
tasks so, I don’t have to go searching for the related documents when it comes 
time to get to work. 
The two primary view modes in OmniFocus are projects and contexts. 
Processing your inbox requires you to identify a project and context for each new 
task. A project is a goal that requires one or more tasks. A project can be lofty, like 
creating a foundation, or mundane, like washing the dog. It doesn’t matter: The 
tools for managing all projects are the same in OmniFocus. 
A context is the location, people, or tools necessary to accomplish a task. For 
example responding to e-mail requires that you are sitting at your computer and 
are connected to the Internet. E-mail is, therefore, a context. You can assign a task 
(such as responding to a client e-mail) the context of E-mail. Later, you’ll see how 
OmniFocus can use that information to give you a list of all tasks with the E-mail 
context, making it easy for you deal with all outstanding e-mail tasks at once. 
Contexts can also be a speciﬁ c location or a person. I have a context for several 
of my co-workers. That way, when we get together, I can select their context in 
OmniFocus and immediately have a list of all tasks I need their assistance on.
OmniFocus does an intelligent job of sorting your projects and contexts. 
For example, when adding tasks to my project for this book, I would type maw 
and OmniFocus ﬁ gured out I was using the Mac at Work project. You can also 
add new projects and contexts in the inbox by typing the name and pressing 
J+Return. When processing inbox items, you can add start and due dates, 
www.ebook777.com

estimated time, and ﬂ ag status. Once an item has a project and a context, it 
disappears from the inbox. After you are done with the inbox, you can further 
manage your tasks in the Projects and Context views.
Organizing and processing tasks
The Project view, shown in Figure 9-9, is a list of all the projects you are 
working on. You create new projects in OmniFocus by clicking the New Project 
iconic button in the toolbar or pressing Shift+J+N. You can create projects for all 
aspects of your work and personal life. I have projects for speciﬁ c clients, articles 
I want to write, and upgrading my backyard vegetable garden. Each chapter of this 
book was, at one point, a project in OmniFocus. 
Anything that merits your  time and attention can have its own place in 
OmniFocus. You can have one long list of all your projects or create hierarchical 
folders to organize your projects. For example, in my Work folder I have a 
subfolder called Clients where I keep a separate folder for each client. This way 
I can keep all projects related to each client in a single folder.
When using Project view (activated by pressing J+1 or clicking the Projects 
iconic button in the toolbar), you are presented a list of all your projects in the 
left pane. When you click a project, all the related tasks appear in the right pane, 
as Figure 9-9 shows.
In the Project view, you can also choose whether a speciﬁ c project’s tasks 
are shown in sequential or parallel order. A  sequential project is one where tasks 
need to be performed in order. For example, if you want to wash the dog, you ﬁ rst 
need to get the tub, then ﬁ ll it with water and soap, and then put Rover in the tub. 
This is true for work projects, too: Quite often, pitching an account or writing a 
report are sequential projects. If you mark a project in OmniFocus as sequential 

(by clicking the Sequential/Parallel iconic button shown in Figure 9-10), it shows 
the tasks in order, making only the next task available. Using the dog-washing 
project as an example, you won’t see a task to ﬁ ll the tub with water until after 
you’ve checked off that you have a tub. Marking a project as sequential is useful to 
remove extra noise from your daily task list.
Tasks in parallel projects can be completed in any order. Checking in 
with clients, for example, is a parallel project. The order in which you call 
clients doesn’t matter. If you have a project that involves a series of parallel 
tasks, all available tasks are shown; all the parallel tasks can be accomplished 
independently of one another. 
The Project view is also a good place to manage start and due dates for your 
tasks. There are several ways to enter dates in OmniFocus. You can enter a date 
by writing the month and date, such as 11/12 for November 12. You can also 
set dates relative to the current date. If, for example, on October 11, you typed 3d 
in a date ﬁ eld, OmniFocus would ﬁ ll in the ﬁ eld with the date in three days, or 
October 14. If you want to push the start date of a task to begin two weeks from 
Monday, type 2w Mon and OmniFocus will ﬁ ll in the right date.
When using OmniFocus, you should be aggressive with the use of start dates 
and conservative with the use of due dates. Start dates are a great way to keep your 
task list manageable. If you are going to write the Smith proposal in two weeks, 
set the start date in two weeks. Otherwise, it will appear as available on your task 
list every day between now and then. The idea is to only have items on your task 
list that you intend to complete on any given day. 
Due dates are the exact opposite. Most tasks don’t require a due date. When 
you give every task a due date, the list becomes unwieldy because OmniFocus 
puts a red badge on its icon telling you the number of overdue items. If every 
item has a due date, every morning you will be swamped with many artiﬁ cial due 
dates (on items that don’t require a due date) and the few true due dates will get 
lost in the noise. Only enter due dates on tasks that truly need them. Then when 
you see that red badge, you can make sure to take care of it.
www.ebook777.com

The Context view organizes all tasks by context, as shown in Figure 9-11. If 
you entered contexts for your tasks in the inbox, you now have a simple way to 
organize your tasks by where you are sitting. For example, my ofﬁ ce e-mail server 
crashed a few weeks ago. Everyone in the ofﬁ ce completely freaked. I turned off 
my e-mail context and switched over to other contexts where I had the necessary 
tools and people available and got back to work. 
Both the Context and Project views allow you to ﬁ lter the tasks displayed. 
There are several ﬁ lters, including project name, ﬂ ag status, and duration. 
OmniFocus lets you customize the ﬁ lters to create custom views of your tasks, 
called perspectives. You can then save the perspectives for later use. I have created 
several custom perspectives to help me manage tasks. One, called Today, just 
shows tasks that are active today. Another, called Clear, lets me quickly audit 
uncompleted tasks at the end of the day.
Once the planning is over, you need to get to work. I usually spend about 
20 minutes every morning planning and prioritizing as necessary in the Today 
perspective. Although I keep OmniFocus running in the background the rest of 
the day, I rarely open its window except to check off items and add new tasks. 
Remember: The point is to get work done and not ﬁ ddle with task lists. In the 
evening, I go back into OmniFocus and clear out the day’s tasks and process any 
new items in the inbox so the following day I can hit the ground running. 
Reviewing tasks
The last piece of OmniFocus is its review capability. You can set a review 
period for every project. The review period could be once a week for an important 
project or once every six months for a not-so-important project. You can then 
activate the Review pane, shown in Figure 9-12, by clicking the Review iconic 
button in the toolbar. The Review pane presents all projects that are due for 
review. You can make sure the tasks are still necessary and the project is still 

relevant. After you mark the project as reviewed, you can set the new review 
period and OmniFocus will reset the review timer on that project and the project 
will disappear from the Review pane. A methodical review process is another way 
to make sure no project or task gets overlooked.
Among productivity nerds, there is a running dispute between OmniFocus 
and Things. Both applications are good, but they are also different. Things has an 
accessible simplicity at the cost of some additional OmniFocus features that I ﬁ nd 
useful, such as better implementation of start and due dates, sequential versus 
parallel tasks, and a project review process.
In the last few years, the task-management support on the Mac has matured 
from a barren wasteland to a rich spectrum of applications covering all Mac 
worker’s task-management needs.

Notes and 
Notes and 
Outlines
Outlines
A
lthough there was a time where bringing a computer to a meeting 
was frowned upon, laptops at the conference table have since become 
commonplace. Whether at weekly staff meetings or client sales calls, 
there are several opportunities to take notes using your Mac. 
Of course, not everyone takes notes the same way. Some users want a linear 
outline while others prefer the ﬂ uid style of a mind map. This chapter looks at 
some of the best note-taking and outlining tools available for Mac OS X. No 
matter how you manage notes and information, at least one of the applications 
in this chapter should work for you.
OmniOutliner
The Omni Group’s  OmniOutliner ($40; www.omnigroup.com/products/
omnioutliner), shown in Figure 10-1, is the best outlining application on the 
Mac. OmniOutliner’s interface presents a basic outline that you can expand on 
during meetings or planning projects. You can promote and demote outline 
entries using Tab and Shift+Tab and insert a new row using Shift+Return. You can 
also move and adjust outline entries using the mouse. After just a few minutes, 
you will be structuring and building outlines in OmniOutliner. If you are in a 
meeting or an interview that jumps around among several topics, you can easily 
keep up with an outline by adding and expanding outline branches as you go. 
OmniOutliner is much more than a traditional outliner. You can add 
multiple columns with different data types such as pop-up menus, check boxes, 
numerical values, dates, durations, and even plain text, as shown in Figure 10-2. 
Often, following a meeting, I add columns to my outline. For example, I include 
a column for the person responsible for an item, the estimated time to complete, 
costs, and deadlines. The columns can be shown or hidden. What starts out as an 
outline becomes a project management tool. 
If you keep numbers in a column, you can instruct OmniOutliner to calculate 
sums and averages. Another good use for columns is to embed links to Web sites 
and ﬁ les. If, for example, you have a  PDF document that relates to an outline 
entry, drag the document to your outline, and OmniOutliner creates a link. You 
www.ebook777.com

can then access that PDF while in OmniOutliner by clicking the link. This also 
works for the built-in Mac OS X Address Book. You can make a separate column 
for contacts and drag names from your Address Book straight into the outline. 
OmniOutliner also holds larger media such as images, audio ﬁ les, and movies.
Each OmniOutliner entry supports inline notes. This feature lets you attach 
a writing pad to every outline entry. The inline notes can collapse or open as 
needed, as shown in Figure 10-3. Some writers use this feature to outline a 
document in OmniOutliner and then write the full text in the inline notes. You 
can then adjust the document by re-arranging the outline. Later the outline, 
including the inline notes, can be exported to a word processor.
OmniOutliner’s styles capability allows you to customize the look of your 
outline. For example, if you want every Level 1 outline item to have a blue 
background and every Level 3 item to use italicized text, you can make that 
happen. Your entire OmniOutliner outline is also searchable. All the search 
results appear in a Utility drawer that slides out the side of your outline window.
There are two versions of OmniOutliner: Standard and Professional. The 
$70 Professional version includes clipping, recording, and template features. The 

clipping service adds text from other applications with a keystroke.  OmniOutliner 
Professional can additionally record audio. Using the recording feature, you can 
capture the audio from a meeting while making an outline. You can later go 
back and update your outline while listening to the recording. The Professional 
version’s custom template support gives you a starting point for repeating 
outlines. For example, if you have a weekly staff meeting, a custom template with 
the repeating agenda items will save you time.
If you want to work on your outline in a different application,  OmniOutliner 
provides several export options. You can export your outline to Microsoft Word, 
HTML, RTF, and several other text formats. OmniOutliner also supports the 
OPML (Outline Processor Markup Language), which allows you to open the 
outline in other applications and preserve your outline formatting. OPML export 
works particularly well with  Scrivener, covered in Chapter 11. 
Moreover, OmniOutliner exports directly to Apple’s  Keynote. Many of my 
best presentations started life in OmniOutliner. When exporting slides to Keynote, 
OmniOutliner creates a new Keynote slide for every Level 1 outline entry. 
I use OmniOutliner often. Anytime I have a collection of random thoughts, 
sorting and organizing them in an outline helps. In fact, this book started in 
OmniOutliner. 
Circus Ponies NoteBook
Circus Ponies’  NoteBook ($50; www.circusponies.com) allows you to 
create virtual three-ring binders on your Mac. Just like the binders you carried in 
school, NoteBook allows you to remove pages, cut and paste pictures or articles 
of interest, and add tabs to give you quick access to key information, as shown in 
Figure 10-4.
The NoteBook interface is immediately useful. You can customize your pages 
with several ruled and grid options, including a  Cornell-style note-taking format. 
www.ebook777.com

You can also customize the binding to make it look as modern (or as old-school) 
as you prefer. Once you set the look of your notebook, you can start adding data. 
To add text, click on the page and start typing. You can write the next great novel 
or a series of notes from customer telephone calls. Once you’ve entered your text, 
you can ﬂ ag it with sticky notes or clip art.
NoteBook also supports to-do lists that you can append to a page. The 
NoteBook index, covered later, tracks unchecked items so you can ﬁ nd them 
quickly. (Although NoteBook is great for tracking tasks for a particular project, 
it doesn’t provide the global task management tools found in the applications 
covered in Chapter 9.)
If you think visually, you can create diagrams. NoteBook includes an 
assortment of shapes and connectors that you can size and move around the 
page. As an example, you could create an organizational chart for your client 
to help remember who ﬁ ts where in the organization, as shown in Figure 10-5. 
(Again, the diagramming tools in NoteBook are not as capable as those in a 
dedicated diagramming application such as OmniGrafﬂ e, covered in Chapter 13.)
NoteBook accepts just about any media you throw at it, including image ﬁ les, 
video, and sound. It also imports and displays  PDF ﬁ les, giving you the ability 
to annotate them. These components can be mixed on a page, allowing you to 
customize the pages for your projects.

Normally, copying information to NoteBook involves selecting the text, 
e-mails, or Web pages in a separate application, opening NoteBook, ﬁ nding the 
page where you want to save the information, and pasting it in. Using NoteBook’s 
Clipping feature, you can bypass those steps. To enable Clippings in NoteBook, 
open your notebook to the page you want to receive clippings and choose Page ➧
Add a Clipping Service. After that, you can select text, e-mails, or Web pages in a 
separate application and invoke the Clipping Service, by Control+clicking or right-
clicking the selected item, and sending the selection to the designated notebook 
page. This is all done in the background, saving you the trouble of jumping 
between applications. In addition to copying in the text, e-mail, or Web clipping, 
NoteBook adds additional information to the clippings, including the name of 
the application and (in the case of  Web clippings) the Web URL the clipping came 
from. 
Like OmniOutliner, NoteBook can record audio. You can later reference 
your voice-annotated NoteBook pages. You can also password-encrypt notebooks 
containing sensitive data.
NoteBook’s Multidex search engine prepares a live index of everything in your 
notebook. The index pages are automatically added to the end of your notebook. 
To locate any information in your notebook, turn to the index pages and ﬁ nd it in 
the alphabetized list. Clicking on an entry takes you directly to that page. 
www.ebook777.com

You can export your notebook in PDF format . NoteBook also provides the 
option of exporting to a Web-ready HTML ﬁ le. In addition to publishing your 
notebook on the Internet, you can install it on your  iPad by choosing File ➧ 
Export as a Web Site ➧ To Disk. Create a folder on your Mac with the name of 
your notebook and save the HTML ﬁ le to that folder. Then move the HTML folder 
to your  iPad using the iPad applications  Air Sharing HD (www.avatron.com/
apps/air-sharing-hd) or  GoodReader (www.goodiware.com). You can then 
view and navigate the hyperlinked HTML ﬁ le on your iPad. 
NoteBook is a great project management tool, giving you one place to keep 
every scrap of data concerning a project. Although there are better alternatives 
for many of its components, there are few applications with the same expansive 
feature set. Because NoteBook is so ﬂ exible, it is greater than the sum of its parts.
Evernote
Evernote (www.evernote.com), which has a free and a premium, $50-per-
year option, is a virtual notebook application with a wrinkle: It stores all your 
data on Evernote’s Internet-based servers. Evernote is ideal for Mac workers who 
use multiple computers or must switch between Windows and Mac OS X. The 
Evernote client application that runs on your Mac includes a text editor for taking 
notes. The completed text ﬁ les are automatically indexed so you can later search 
for words contained in the ﬁ le. You can add tags to the text ﬁ les with keywords. 
You can also organize the text ﬁ les by putting them in folders. 
Because the Evernote application links to your Evernote cloud storage, your 
notes are automatically synced to the Evernote Internet servers and shared back to 
other computers and mobile devices with your Evernote account. 
Using Evernote, you can take notes in a meeting using your Mac laptop and 
access those notes on your desktop Windows PC when you return to the ofﬁ ce. 
You can limit access to the Evernote data to just yourself or you can share the 
login with co-workers, giving everyone access to the Evernote data and notes.
Evernote accepts more than just text. Using the Evernote Mac OS X client, 
shown in Figure 10-6, you can upload notes, documents, pictures, audio ﬁ les, and 
other data to the Evernote servers. You can set Evernote to sync your records to its 
cloud servers automatically or manually. All the records you upload to Evernote 
(whether they be text ﬁ les, pictures, or audio) can be tagged with keywords or 
stored in folders you create on your Evernote account.
As an example, let’s say you are going to Chicago for a sales presentation. 
Using your Evernote account, you can upload PDF images of your plane tickets 
and hotel conﬁ rmation, a text ﬁ le with your shuttle reservation number, your 
sales estimates and reports, selected Web pages from your potential customer’s 

Web site, a text ﬁ le with the contact information for everyone you will meet, 
the schedule for the Art Institute (just in case you have free time), and the text 
for a half-written letter to your sister. Because your data is then in the cloud 
and Evernote has applications for all the major desktop and mobile platforms 
(including Mac OS X, Windows,  iPhone,  iPad,  BlackBerry, and  Android), you can 
view, append, and modify your Evernote data from any device. Some companies 
run their entire business through the Evernote database. If you lose your Mac on 
the way, you can log in to your account from any Internet-connected computer 
and access the stored information.
The mobile applications, particularly the iPhone application, are engineered 
to quickly capture information. It is easy to dictate a voice note, snap a picture, or 
simply enter some text on the go and have it immediately synchronized to your 
Evernote database.
An added beneﬁ t of cloud-based data  storage is that the Evernote servers can 
work on your data for you. With the free account, Evernote runs a text-recognition 
algorithm that extracts the text from uploaded pictures. With a paid account, it 
also does this for PDF ﬁ les. So, if while in Chicago you ﬁ nd a particularly good 
oolong tea and have the foresight to take a picture of the label, you can sync it to 
Evernote, which searches and indexes the text from the picture. If, two months 
later, you want to see that label again, just type oolong in the search ﬁ eld and 
ﬁ nd the picture. This becomes very powerful if you have a paid account and keep 
your work-related PDFs in your Evernote database. 
Many Evernote users make a practice of taking a picture of people’s business 
cards and letting Evernote pull the text out so it may easily search for that 
www.ebook777.com

information in the future. Another good use for this feature is to take pictures of 
the whiteboard at the end of your meetings. You can then go back and search for 
the text on the board. 
There are some limits to cloud-based data. The ﬁ rst is a concern for security. 
Because your data is on Internet servers, anyone with your user name and 
password can access it. Also, although Evernote makes it easy to put data into 
your account, it is not as easy to pull data back out; it does not offer the drag-and-
drop export functionality that you get with many native Mac OS X applications. 
But if you work on multiple platforms and don’t mind keeping your data in the 
cloud, Evernote is a good tool for taking notes and tracking information.
MindNode Pro
A recent addition to the arsenal of digital note-taking is  mind-mapping. As 
computers have advanced, people have moved beyond mere text input and now 
use graphical mind-mapping applications to take notes and develop ideas more 
visually. A mind map is a diagram arranged around a central idea. It allows you 
to visualize a project and the necessary branches or components that grow out 
of it. A mind map consists of a page (often called a canvas) upon which there 
are a series of connected ideas, called nodes. For example, in Figure 10-7, there is 
a node for Basic Business. That node has a parent node called Mac at Work. The 
line between Basic Business and Mac at Work is a connection. The Basic Business 
node has children nodes called Fundamentals, Backing Up, and Useful Utilities 
and sibling nodes called Advanced Business, Mac Basics, Communications and 
Connections, and Advanced Topics.
Because a mind map is in diagram format, it is easy to draw lines between 
connected ideas and ﬁ nd connections that you may not otherwise realize exist. 
Mind maps are useful both when working alone and when brainstorming in a 
meeting. There are several mind-mapping applications available for Mac OS X. 
One of the most useful apps is  MindNode Pro ($25; www.mindnode.com), 
shown in Figure 10-7.
Using MindNode Pro requires no learning curve. To make a new node, you 
click the + (plus) iconic button on any existing note and drag. The application 
can also be operated with keyboard shortcuts for quicker entry. The Return key, 
for example, opens a new node. You can set a constrained width for the nodes 
and even combine multiple mind maps on one canvas. (The page or canvas 
automatically grows to ﬁ t your mind map.)
MindNode Pro allows you to create secondary connections, called cross-
connections, between otherwise unrelated branches. You can expand and collapse 

branches of your mind map. You can add images by dragging them on top of 
the node. 
You can export MindNode ﬁ les to several formats, including  OPML (which 
works with the OmniOutliner application covered earlier in this chapter), 
FreeMind, RTF, HTML, and several image types, including PDF, PNG, and TIFF. 
There is an  iPhone version that works on both the iPhone and iPad. MindNode 
Pro’s simplicity and clean interface make it a great tool for creating mind maps in 
meetings or while planning strategy.
Notational Velocity
Notational Velocity (free; www.notational.net) is an interesting contrast 
to Evernote. Where you can put just about anything in an Evernote database, 
Notational Velocity just holds text. However, if you want a place to manage text, 
this application is pretty spectacular. 
Notational Velocity has no interface to speak of, just a search bar and a 
list of text ﬁ les, as shown in Figure 10-8. The search bar and new note creation 
are all tied to one line. Creating a new note does not require pressing any key 
combination or clicking a button; you just type the name of your new note and 
press Return. 
If you start typing in the name ﬁ eld and already have a similarly titled note, 
just press Tab and then Return to start editing that note. No dialog boxes. No 
www.ebook777.com

mouse clicks. Just enter a few keystrokes and you are working. Notational Velocity 
also searches the text note contents. 
The trick with Notational Velocity is to use smart naming conventions so 
you can quickly search your notes. For example, you could start all work related 
notes with the letters WK followed by the client name, followed by a date string 
and the event. As an example, for a note you took while talking to Mike on the 
Smith account on October 11, 2010, the name would be WK-Smith-2010-10-05 
Phone call from Mike. Using this naming convention, you could type 
WK-Smith-2010 in the search bar and get all your notes on the Smith account 
from 2010. By putting a little thought into how you name your notes, you can 
get even faster access in a large Notational Velocity database. If you have trouble 
remembering how to name your Notational Velocity notes, create a note called 
Naming Conventions.
This application has one of the simplest user interfaces I have ever 
experienced. For example, there is no Save button; Notational Velocity saves 
everything as you type. The ﬁ rst time I used it I thought I was doing something 
wrong. Once you get the hang of it, you can ﬂ y through your notes. This 
application quickly moves from being a way to capture notes in a meeting or a 
phone call to becoming a text bank with snippets of reference information and 
frequently used text at your ﬁ ngertips.
There aren’t many additional features in Notational Velocity. You can 
choose to keep your database as one single ﬁ le or a series of individual text ﬁ les. 
You can also encrypt your data. If you use multiple Macs, you can relocate your 

Notational Velocity data to a cloud-based storage location, such as Dropbox 
(covered in Chapter 21) and have your Notational Velocity data sync among 
every Mac you own. 
If you use an  iPhone or  iPad, the free application  SimpleNote (www.
simplenoteapp.com) also synchronizes with the Notational Velocity database. 
Using SimpleNote, you can have all your Notational Velocity notes in your pocket 
ready to review or edit. SimpleNote has an optional $9-per-year paid service that 
allows you to access your SimpleNote database from the Web. This is useful for 
accessing your data from a Windows PC. Quite often, I start writing bits of text for 
correspondence, reports, and even pieces of this book, on SimpleNote on my iPad 
that gets ﬁ nished in Notational Velocity on my Mac.
Notational Velocity is one of my favorite Mac applications and my 
Notational Velocity database is bursting with snippets of text, code, and random 
thoughts. 
Livescribe Pulse Smartpen
The  Livescribe Pulse Smartpen ($150 and up; www.livescribe.com) 
offers a different approach to taking notes. This device, shown in Figure 10-9, is 
a computer in a pen. It has an infrared camera and audio recorder built in. In a 
meeting, you just take out your Smartpen and take notes on its special microdot 
paper just as if you were using normal pen and paper. However, the Smartpen 
records every pen stroke; when you synchronize your Smartpen to your Mac, 
the Livescribe software re-creates the pen strokes on the screen. It looks as if you 
www.ebook777.com

scanned in your notes. You can then save your notes as a PDF ﬁ le or e-mail them 
to a co-worker. Livescribe also has a Web service for sharing your notes over the 
Internet. If your business frowns upon bringing laptops into meetings, this pen is 
the perfect digital solution.
Even more useful, during a meeting you can — after getting permission of 
all the people in attendance, of course — record audio from the meeting with 
your Smartpen. Its computer synchronizes the recording with the pen strokes as 
you take notes. You can later go back and touch the Smartpen to any portion of 
your notes; the pen plays back the audio from the exact moment you wrote those 
pen strokes through its internal speaker. These audio ﬁ les are also synchronized 
to your Mac, so you can play back the audio on your computer. The Smartpen’s 
ability to synchronize audio with written notes has proven to be a real game-
changer in my work.
Because the Smartpen is a computer, it also has several additional functions, 
including time-value-money calculations and a limited capability of translating 
written words. Livescribe has its own App Store where you can buy additional 
applications for your Smartpen such as optical character recognition for your 
hand-writing, conversion applications, or, for boring meetings,  Hangman.

Word Processing
Word Processing
 W
ord processing is probably the most common work task we all do 
on our computers. No matter what your business, at some point 
you will ﬁ nd yourself pushing the curser slowly across the screen. 
Not long after personal computers ﬁ rst landed on our desks, word processors 
gravitated toward a standard interface that hasn’t changed much in the last 20 
years — until recently.
Today, there are more software developers creating word processing 
applications than ever before, with some interesting new innovations. There is a 
rich ﬁ eld of word processors available on the Mac, with feature sets ranging from 
sparse to intricate. This chapter covers the word processing veterans (Microsoft 
Word and iWork Pages) and some of the newer, promising rookies that may 
change the way you write.
Microsoft Word
Microsoft Word is the de facto word processor of many workplaces. Microsoft 
was an early supporter of the Mac platform; the ﬁ rst version of Word for the Mac 
shipped in 1985, the year after the Mac was ﬁ rst released. Despite its long history 
on the Mac, there have been several issues with the last few releases of Word on 
the Mac. When Apple switched to Intel processors in 2006, Microsoft was one 
of the last major software companies to ship an Intel version of its application: 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2008 didn’t ship until January 2009. In the interim, Word had 
to run on Intel Macs through the use of an interpreter, which made Word nearly 
unusably slow; there was a noticeable delay between the time you pressed a key 
and the letter appeared on the screen.
When Ofﬁ ce 2008 was released, it felt rushed. The user interface was cluttered 
with buttons and switches, and support for  Visual Basic, a macro language many 
Ofﬁ ce power users rely on, had been removed because Microsoft said converting 
it to the Intel-based Mac OS X would take too long. Finally, with the recent 
release of Ofﬁ ce 2011, Microsoft appears to have recovered from the Intel switch 
and once again has a useful version of Word on the Mac.
www.ebook777.com

Word (www.microsoft.com/mac) is part of the $200  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 
Home & Business suite, which also includes Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. 
(The $120 Home & Student edition does not include Outlook.) Starting with 
Ofﬁ ce 2011, Microsoft switched to a per-installation licensing system: Each copy 
can be installed on only one Mac. So if you own a laptop and desktop Mac, you’ll 
need to purchase two copies. Fortunately, there are multiple-install discounts: You 
can get two install codes for the Home & Business edition for $280, and three 
install codes for the Home & Student edition for $150. 
When you open Word 2011, you are given an opportunity to open a new 
document from one of the many included templates or a previously opened 
document, as shown in Figure 11-1. You can access and download additional 
templates directly from Microsoft in the same window. Your previously opened 
documents are indexed by the last day you worked on them; for example, you 
could choose from the seven documents you opened yesterday.
Word improves the user interface over prior versions, and it adopts the 
ribbon toolbar paradigm used in Microsoft Ofﬁ ce for Windows, as shown in 
Figure 11-2. The Mac Word ribbon isn’t identical to the Windows version, but it 
does use many of the same labels and tools to make cross-platform use easier. 
Improvements to the interface with Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2011 are signiﬁ cant, and 
they go beyond the ribbon. 

For example, Word’s style tools simplify document formatting, and Word 
2011 has improved styles. For 20 years, Word’s styles have let you designate 
exactly how you want headings, paragraphs, footnotes, and other common 
document elements to look. By applying styles, you can automatically set that 
formatting. If, later, you decide to change some element of any particular style, 
it is automatically corrected throughout the document. For example, you may 
decide to increase the line spacing of your body text formatting from 14 to 
18 points; adjusting the style applies this change throughout your document 
anywhere the body text style is applied. The problem with styles in Microsoft 
Word before version 2011 was that they were difﬁ cult to access and modify. That 
has now changed: The styles are listed in the Home ribbon bar, shown in Figure 
11-2. Word even puts the most commonly used styles right in the ribbon bar so 
you can access them with one click.
In previous versions, changing  formatting required navigation of complex 
inspector windows, but in Word 2011 you can now format your document 
much easier using the Layout ribbon. It has easily identiﬁ able iconic buttons 
for orientation, size, page break, and margins. It also gives you a speciﬁ c 
measurement for your top, bottom, left, and right margins. You can also create 
columns, watermarks, and borders using iconic buttons in the Layout ribbon.
www.ebook777.com

The Document Elements ribbon lets you customize the header and footer 
settings. The Document Elements ribbon also simpliﬁ es creation of tables of 
contents, bibliographies, text boxes, Word Art illustrations, and equations boxes. 
Although none of these tools is remarkable, all were tedious to use in prior 
versions of Word for Mac. By including them in the ribbons, Microsoft has made 
them more intuitive and easier for Windows switchers.
In addition to its ability to import Excel spreadsheets, Word has its own chart 
support, allowing you to input your own data for simple  charts directly in the 
word processor. The Chart ribbon makes it easy to adjust colors and styles with 
predeﬁ ned color schemes. The application previews the predeﬁ ned formats in 
your document as you mouse over them so you can get a look at the ﬁ nal product 
before selecting a format.
Word 2011 also tweaks the user interface for  tracking changes and review. 
Until Word 2011, tracking changes was clumsy in Mac Word. That is no longer 
the case: Using the Review ribbon, shown in Figure 11-3, you can add and delete 
comments, turn on change tracking (with an easily understood slider switch), set 
which changes to display, and accept or reject changes. You can manage all this 
from the Review ribbon without having to open and navigate inspectors or the 
menu bar as before.

Thankfully, Word 2011 supports Visual Basic. This scripting language lets you 
automatically format documents and share Word data with Excel, PowerPoint, 
and Outlook. If you are interested in automating your word processing using 
Word, Visual Basic (along with Word’s additional support for AppleScript and 
Automator) is where you can go nuts.
Word 2011 supports the traditional .doc and controversial Ofﬁ ce Open XML 
(.docx) formats. (Some people argue the Ofﬁ ce Open XML standard is overly 
complicated and, ironically, not open.) Regardless, Mac workers need access to 
both formats, and Word provides it. Documents can be exported to several other 
text formats as well as to Microsoft’s version of the Web’s HTML format. But note 
that Microsoft’s  HTML export is considered very messy (it is legendary for adding 
excess HTML code) and thus difﬁ cult to use on Web sites. All the special code 
Microsoft adds to make the ﬁ nal result look just like what’s on your Word screen 
is formatting you usually don’t want to carry over to the Web, ironically. 
With decades of development behind it, Word has the most features of any 
word processor on the Mac. No matter how obscure your feature request, Word is 
the most likely word processor to support it. If the feature isn’t available, there is 
probably a way to add it using Visual Basic, AppleScript, or Automator.
This abundance of features comes at a cost. The user interface is crowded 
with controls. So many controls in fact that, despite the ribbon toolbars 
improvement, it can be bafﬂ ing trying to ﬁ nd the two or three features you really 
need. Somewhere along the way in Word’s development (I would argue the 
trouble started with version 6), it stopped being a word processor and became a 
processor-killing feature list. Microsoft has improved the performance but every 
new version of Word adds still more features that take up screen real estate and 
your Mac’s resources. 
Despite its improvements,  Word still does not fully adopt Apple’s 
programming frameworks. Word 2011 uses some of the Apple Cocoa 
programming frameworks (the ribbon bar, for example, is programmed with 
Cocoa, taking advantage of Mac OS X’s built-in graphics acceleration), but it still 
has not fully adopted Mac OS X technologies. As a result, Ofﬁ ce 2011 runs only in 
32-bit mode and so cannot take advantage of Mac OS X’s latest 64-bit technology, 
such as accessing signiﬁ cant amounts of memory. Although this probably won’t 
be an issue for word processing documents, it can be a problem with larger Excel 
and PowerPoint ﬁ les.
It has been some time since there has been a reliable version of Word on 
Mac OS X, so Word 2011 is a welcome upgrade. You can now certainly get your 
word processing done with Word for Mac 2011. But do you have to get your word 
processing done in Word? The time when Word was your only option is long 
www.ebook777.com

gone. There are good reasons (price and feature glut, to name two) to avoid Word, 
and today there are several alternatives available.
Apple iWork Pages
Pages is the word processing component of the iWork Suite ($79; www.
apple.com/iwork) that also includes Numbers and Keynote. Pages premiered 
in 2005 but the initial versions were much more about page layout than word 
processing. It wasn’t until version 3 in 2007 that Pages came into its own as a 
word processor. Pages, shown in Figure 11-4, does not try to match Word in terms 
of features. Instead, Pages included the features Apple considered to be the most 
important and then polished the heck out of them. 
In addition to its own format, Pages can open Microsoft Word, plain text 
(ASCII), RTF (Rich Text Format), and AppleWorks ﬁ les. When Pages imports a 
different format, it creates a new instance of the document, leaving the original 
untouched in case anything goes wrong. When importing documents, Pages does a 
passable job of converting the formatting. Word styles are imported and converted 
to Pages styles, for example. For documents with complex formatting, Pages 
provides a notiﬁ cation of any conversion problems with the Document Warnings 
dialog box that explains what parts of the document Pages had trouble with.

It’s no surprise that Pages (developed by Apple) is the best word processor in 
terms of integrating with Mac OS X. If, for example, you open a letter template in 
Pages and then go to the Mac OS X Address Book and drag a person’s contact on 
top of the letter template, Pages automatically ﬁ lls in the letter with the relevant 
contact information. Likewise, Pages ﬁ lls in your address and contact information 
on the letter using the contact information you used when you registered your Mac.
The Pages toolbar demonstrates the key difference between Pages and Word: 
There is no ribbon or crowded buttons. The Pages toolbar includes just the most 
commonly used tools — and no more. You can customize the toolbar: Choose 
View ➧ Customize Toolbar or Control+click or right-click the toolbar and choose 
Customize Toolbar from the contextual menu. When you choose to customize 
the toolbar, Pages provides the settings sheet shown in Figure 11-5 from which 
you can add or remove tools by clicking and dragging them onto or off of the 
toolbar — the same method Apple uses to customize the toolbars in Mac OS X 
and its other applications.
Below the toolbar is the  format bar, which holds context-sensitive tools 
speciﬁ c to whatever task you are working on. If you are working with text, you 
get text tools. If you are working on images, you see image tools. This is a clean 
alternative to other word processors’ cluttered controls that quickly turn the user 
www.ebook777.com

interface into something that more closely resembles a NASA control panel than 
a place to write.
Writing in Pages is friction-free. Pages is snappy and melts out of the way, 
letting you focus on the work of getting your words on the screen. Pages taps into 
the built-in Mac OS X dictionary and thesaurus tools. It also provides spell-check 
and proofreading support. The distraction-free writing mode (see the sidebar 
“Writing sans Distraction”) in Pages is well-designed and especially useful for 
proofreading.
Pages includes several view modes. You can put two pages on the screen at 
once (called Two Up) or zoom the page width to match the screen. One of the 
most innovative views is the thumbnail view, which puts a thumbnail-size strip of 
images down the left side of the page showing all the pages in the document. 
If you work with Microsoft Ofﬁ ce users, you can  track changes in Word 
documents. I’ve traded documents with tracked changes several times with Word 
users without them ever knowing I was working in Pages. The only exception 
I’ve encountered is documents with unusually complex formatting, such as 
legal pleadings. The tracked-changes view in Pages, shown in Figure 11-6, is also 
attractive.

Pages’ Save dialog box lets you save a copy of your document in Microsoft 
Word format. You can also export Pages documents to text, HTML, and RTF 
formats. The RTF standard is supposed to act as the lingua franca across word 
processors, allowing you to copy text with formatting from one word processor to 
another. Unfortunately,  Pages does not support all the RTF formatting functions, 
so exporting a document to RTF from Pages does not always retain all the 
formatting you would expect. Speciﬁ cally, Pages does not export style formatting: 
If you need to convert a Pages document to RTF with styles retained, you must 
ﬁ rst export it as a Word (.doc) ﬁ le and then open it in Word, where you can 
export it as a proper RTF document.
One glaring omission in the entire iWork Suite is the lack of an automatic 
save feature, a standard feature on most word processors for the past 20 years. 
If you work on a document in Pages for 10 hours without saving and the power 
goes out, consider those 10 hours lost because you’ll be starting from scratch. So, 
WRITING SANS DISTRACTION
Something we’ve lost as writers with the advent of word processing is 
simplicity. Not so long ago, you sat down with a pen and a blank sheet of 
paper. Then you wrote. Writers didn’t have the marvelous distractions we get 
these days with dinging e-mail reminders, chiming RSS feeds, and chirping 
Twitter updates to interrupt our writing with important information about 
our friends’ tastes in ﬁ zzy cola. 
When you consider all the diversions available on our Macs, it is 
remarkable anything gets written at all. Distractions have become such a 
problem that some Mac workers use applications like  Freedom ($10; www.
macfreedom.com) to disable their Internet connection when they need 
to grind that grindstone.
Word processors are starting to help.  Microsoft Word has a full-screen 
mode that places your page on a black background. Likewise,  Pages’ 
Full-Screen View helps you avoid  distractions and get back to work. Once 
activated, Pages turns your entire screen black except for the page you 
are working on. It is a great way to focus on your writing and avoid the 
distractions. And Scrivener’s distraction-free mode lets you customize it to 
also display your research. 
However, the champion of distraction-free writing on the Mac by far 
is  WriteRoom ($25; www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/
writeroom). This application displays green type on a ﬂ at black screen. If 
you are old enough to remember using an Apple II, WriteRoom will take you 
back. Although simple in execution, WriteRoom gets the details right. For 
example, rather than push your active text line to the bottom of the screen, 
WriteRoom keeps the line where you enter text in the center of the screen.
www.ebook777.com

when you’re writing with Pages, train yourself to save often. The universal 
keyboard shortcut to save in Mac OS X is J+S, and it works in Pages, too. 
Another save feature, accessed in Pages’ General Preferences dialog box (press 
J+, [comma] or choose Pages ➧ Preferences), allows you to back up previous 
versions of documents. This way, every time you save a ﬁ le, the new version is 
saved in the same directory as the prior version. Doing so is a good idea: Disk 
space is much cheaper than your time. 
There are also third-party applications that  automatically save your 
documents for you. One of the best is  ForeverSave ($15; www.tool-forcesw.
com/foreversave), which can auto-save and back up ﬁ les from most Mac OS X 
applications, including iWork.
One place that Pages clearly outshines Word is page layout. Pages makes 
it easy to create newsletters, ﬂ yers, and other graphics-intensive documents. 
Importing and placing graphics is as simple as dragging and dropping them. 
Pages does the rest. You can easily create your own layout using Pages or use one 
of its built-in templates (there are more than 160). The page layout tools go far 
beyond anything offered by Word 2011 — or any competing word processor, 
for that matter. Although the Pages layout tools don’t rival a professional layout 
application, such as Adobe InDesign, they are sufﬁ cient for most users.
Although the usability disparity between Word and Pages is not nearly as 
large now as it was before Word 2011, I still ﬁ nd Pages to be the superior writing 
environment. But this is now legitimately a matter open to debate, and Mac 
workers more familiar with Microsoft Word will not go wrong electing to use 
Word on the Mac. 
Scrivener
There has been a renaissance of sorts for word processing on the Mac. Not 
so long ago, everyone used Microsoft Word. It was, practically speaking, the only 
word processor on the Mac (and Windows too). That is no longer the case. Apple 
built many  text-management tools into the Mac OS X development software. As 
a result, application developers can tap into the Apple code and design their own 
word processors more easily. With this lower barrier of entry, small developers 
are rethinking the word processor. This has resulted in some truly revolutionary 
writing software. One of the best in this class is  Scrivener.
Scrivener ($40; www.literatureandlatte.com), shown in Figure 11-7, 
is a word processor with extensive research tools baked in. The developer created 
Scrivener to help him write his own novel, and the application has the kind of 
subtle touches you ﬁ nd when a developer creates software for his own use.

Scrivener is as much about planning and organizing your writing project 
as it is about getting your words on the screen. Using Scrivener, you can capture 
all your research in the same space you use for writing. Although developed as a 
novel-writing tool, it works equally well for other kinds of serious writing. I use it 
to write legal briefs, research projects, and this book.
Quite often, your writing project includes source materials. These can be bits 
of text, Web pages, videos, pictures, and any other digital scrap of information. 
Traditionally, these reference materials are kept in a folder or some other 
application on your Mac. But Scrivener holds them for you and makes them 
accessible next to your writing space. Scrivener takes just about anything you 
throw at it and organizes it in a research tab. 
Scrivener holds research in a series of nested icons on the left side of the 
screen. Adding research just requires you to drag and drop it there. For text, you 
can open a research tab and start typing. You can then arrange Scrivener to display 
your research next to your typing window. With everything nicely organized, 
Scrivener is an efﬁ cient way to make progress on writing projects.
You may remember the day when you pinned index cards to a piece of 
corkboard to organize large writing projects. It was a great way to summarize 
important points and work out the ﬂ ow. Following this paradigm, Scrivener has 
a virtual corkboard, shown in Figure 11-8, and an endless supply of virtual note 
cards. All your research notes and related documents are given their own index 
cards, which you can then shufﬂ e and sort on the virtual corkboard. Scrivener 
keeps an eye on how you move the cards around and sorts the underlying 
www.ebook777.com

documents accordingly. It also lets you to tie keywords to your note cards to make 
organization and retrieval easier in large projects.
If you need to reduce your note cards to an outline, Scrivener can handle 
that as well. Although Scrivener is not as powerful an outliner as OmniOutliner 
(covered in Chapter 10), it is enough for most writing projects and has the added 
bonus of being attached to your research and drafts. Because Scrivener can import 
ﬁ les in the  OPML format, you can use  OmniOutliner with Scrivener. I often start 
a large project as an OmniOutliner document and then export it to OPML format. 
Then I import the OPML outline into Scrivener, which converts the outline to an 
organized writing project. Scrivener also syncs with  SimpleNote, a Web-syncing 

text service covered in Chapter 10, so you can work on bits and pieces of your 
Scrivener project using your  iPhone and  iPad.
Scrivener understands that sometimes editing can go a bit astray, so it has a 
“snapshot” feature that allows you to capture versions of a document during the 
editing process. You can then go back and retrieve that discarded treasure when 
you come to your senses. It is a bit like Time Machine for words.
Scrivener makes the process of writing as simple and distraction-free as 
possible. It has a very clean full-screen mode, shown in Figure 11-9, that clears all 
the usual diversions off your screen and provides easy access to your research. 
Part of Scrivener’s charm is how it breaks the old paradigm of what a word 
processor does. Although you can mark text as bold, underline, and italic, 
Scrivener has no page-formatting support. Instead, you get your text and research 
displayed in a way conducive to making the words better. Using a construction 
CLEANING DIRTY TEXT
No matter which word processor you use, you will occasionally bump into 
text that has an  overabundance of carriage returns or apostrophes turned 
into dollar signs. You then end up spending valuable time moving your 
cursor around the screen and ﬁ xing the offending text. The good news is 
there is an app for that. 
TextSoap ($40; www.unmarked.com) cleans your dirty text. TextSoap 
is loaded with tools that address all the common text problems that anyone 
who writes on a regular basis has come to dread. It includes more than 100 
built-in cleaners and allows you to make your own custom cleaners.
TextSoap’s Scrub ﬁ lter, shown in the ﬁ gure below, handles the most 
common cleaning tasks, like removing extra spaces, ﬁ xing broken paragraphs, 
and removing those e-mail forwarding marks (>) that look like they want to 
stab every line of text. Using TextSoap, you can eliminate the tedious act of 
manually cleaning text and get back to work.

analogy, Scrivener lets you set the foundation and erect the walls but painting 
is done elsewhere. The application lets you focus on the words and leaves the 
formatting for later. 
Once you are done writing, you can print your document or export it to one 
of several formats, including Microsoft Word, plain text, and HTML. Scrivener 
supports  multimarkdown (a writing syntax that lets you embed codes for footnotes, 
emphasis, and other text effects in plain text documents), which lets you easily 
publish to multimarkdown-supported Web services. Although I write most of my 
large projects in Scrivener, I ultimately export the document to Pages or Word 
for the ﬁ nal formatting. Scrivener is substance over style, and a gem for all Mac 
writers.
Web-Based Word Processing
Word processing is no longer just in the domain of local applications. There 
are several Internet-based tools available now. One of the best is Notational 
Velocity when combined with SimpleNote (both covered in Chapter 10). There 
are also Web-based, full-featured word processors being developed to run from 
your browser. The two biggest are the  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps version of Word 
and Google Docs.

Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps, shown in Figure 11-10, is a Web-based version of 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce. To use it on an ofﬁ ce network, you need Microsoft SharePoint 
(a set of network sharing tools) installed on your server and a license for the 
Microsoft Home & Business edition. Consumers can use the Microsoft Web Apps 
for free using a Microsoft SkyDrive account (www.windowslive.com/online/
skydrive). This new iteration of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce was ﬁ rst released in 2010 as 
a competitor to Google Docs. Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps is the best online tool 
for uploading and modifying intricate Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents. 
Although not a replacement for Microsoft Ofﬁ ce on your Mac, Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 
Web Apps does a creditable job viewing and editing Ofﬁ ce documents with 
complex formatting. Although it doesn’t have most of the features available in 
Word for Mac 2011, in a pinch Ofﬁ ce Web Apps will do.
Google Docs, shown in Figure 11-11, is several years old and more mature 
in some respects than Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps. Although not as seamless 
with Word formatting as Ofﬁ ce Web Apps, Google Docs shines at collaboration. 
Google Docs lets multiple users edit the same document at once and is rock-solid 
at keeping the document in one piece. (Many text editors, including Pages, go 
into ﬁ ts if multiple people edit a document at once.) Collaboration is the best use 
of Google Docs: It is a great way for colleagues to work on the same document 
from multiple locations. Once the collaboration is completed, the text can be 
moved to Word or Pages for ﬁ nal formatting and editing. Microsoft announced 
www.ebook777.com

its intention to add multiuser ﬁ le access and collaboration to Ofﬁ ce for Mac 2011 
and the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps but it was not available as this book went to 
press.
Google Docs takes advantage of Google’s other products. It has great 
search tools, for example. Google Docs also feels more responsive when typing 
compared to Ofﬁ ce Web Apps; you don’t think about the fact you are typing onto 
the Web with Google Docs whereas Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps’ Word has just 
enough of a delay to remind you it is a browser and not a local application when 
you are typing.
It is not surprising that while this new class of word processors is still in its 
infancy. Microsoft is marching toward lots of features and Google is marching 
toward simplicity. The user interfaces of both Ofﬁ ce Web Apps and Google Docs 
are unmistakably Web-based. Neither one is very pretty, but the color coding and 
organization of Google Docs is more utilitarian and easier to understand.
Although the idea of cloud-based, available-everywhere word processing has 
a certain appeal, I still prefer a locally installed word processor. I’ve tried to work 
exclusively in both Google Docs and Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Web Apps and in both 
instances happily came back to Scrivener,  Notational Velocity, and Pages. Still, 
like other Web services, I suspect cloud-based word processing will become more 
appealing as the technology improves, and we may one day look back on the 
locally installed word processor and data ﬁ les with the same nostalgia we now 
have for ﬂ oppy disks.
Ernest Hemingway wrote amazing ﬁ ction on a napkin, while I often write 
complete drivel on my expensive Mac. No matter what software you use to write, 
at the end of the day it is your words, and not some arbitrary feature set, that 
determines the quality of the ﬁ nal product. Find the word processor that suits 
your needs and start writing.

Managing 
Managing 
PDF Files
PDF Files
A
dobe’s Portable Document Format ( PDF) is the lingua franca of the 
Internet for document-sharing. Because PDF-formatted documents 
embed the layout and fonts of the original document, they can be 
shared with others who don’t have the same application, or even the same 
operating system. Spreadsheets, timelines, contracts, and sales proposals often 
end up in PDF format before being released to the world. Mac OS X includes 
built-in PDF support. There are also several useful third-party PDF applications. 
Creating PDFs
In Mac OS X, you can create a  PDF document from any application that 
can print. The standard Mac OS X Print dialog box has a pop-up menu in the 
lower-left corner labeled PDF. Figure 12-1 shows a Print dialog box with the PDF 
pop-up menu open.
This menu provides several PDF options:
 ◗
Open PDF in Preview: This option creates a PDF file in  Preview, the 
basic PDF management and annotation tool that comes with Mac OS X. 
(Preview is covered in detail later.)
 ◗
Save as PDF: The Save as PDF option enables you to create PDF 
documents from any file you could otherwise print, including 
spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, and diagrams. The PDF files can 
then be sent to your Windows co-workers without any further processing. 
 ◗
Save as  PostScript: This setting saves your document to a PostScript 
file. The Postscript file format contains codes and instructions for a 
PostScript interpreter, used by some printers.
 ◗
Fax PDF: If you have a facsimile ( fax) modem attached to your Mac, you 
can encode your document to PDF and send the facsimile in one step.
 ◗
Mail PDF: The Mail PDF option lets you to share PDF files in one step: 
A new mail message is created in your default e-mail application and the 
freshly minted PDF is attached.
 ◗
Save as PDF-X:  PDF-X is a customized PDF format used in the printing 
industry. 
www.ebook777.com

 ◗
Save to application: Depending on the applications you install, 
you will find additional options to save PDF files directly to installed 
applications. Independent developers can also add entries to this menu.
 ◗
Save to custom location: You can add your own destinations for PDF 
files by choosing the Edit With menu option and pressing the + (plus) 
iconic button, to select a folder. That folder then becomes a new entry with 
the selected folder as a PDF target. This feature is useful for making custom 
PDF file locations for clients, expenses, and other categories.
 ◗
Security settings: The  PDF Save dialog box also include the Security 
Settings button that leads to a second dialog box, shown in Figure 12-2, 
where you set access and passwords for your PDF files. The security 
settings allow you to set passwords for opening, copying text from, and 
printing your newly created PDF document.
PDF Applications
In addition to creating PDF ﬁ les, there are several applications that allow you 
to edit and modify PDF ﬁ les, starting with Mac OS X’s Preview.
Preview
Mac OS X ships with the  Preview application that, among other things, you 
can use to edit PDF ﬁ les. In Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and 10.6 Snow Leopard, 
Apple has added several PDF management tools to Preview that were previously 

only available by purchasing additional software. For basic PDF document editing 
and management, Preview may be all you need.
Because PDF documents are more like printed documents then application 
ﬁ les, you need tools to mark them up electronically in a fashion similar to using 
your highlighter and red pen for printed documents. In Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, 
Apple added annotation tools to Preview for this purpose. 
Preview has tools for highlighting and annotating PDF ﬁ les, as shown in 
Figure 12-3. For deleting text, there is the Strike Through Text tool. You can draw 
attention to speciﬁ c sections of a PDF document with the Oval and Rectangle 
tools. All the Preview  PDF annotations save to the PDF ﬁ le and are viewable in 
other PDF applications on Windows and Mac OS X, including  Adobe Acrobat.
To add text annotation to your PDF document, choose Tools ➧ Annotate ➧ Add 
Note. Then click the location in your PDF document where you want the note to 
appear, and Preview will insert a small yellow icon. You can move the icon to any 
location in your document. When you click the icon, a yellow text box opens and 
you can add notes. Unlike the more advanced PDF applications PDFpen and Adobe 
Acrobat Pro, you cannot hide Preview comments when printing or sharing.
To apply other text revisions, choose Tools ➧ Annotate. You can pick among 
several markup tools — including Highlight Text, Strike Through Text, and 
Underline Text — and go to town. For the text-markup tools to work, however, 
Preview must recognize there is text in the PDF ﬁ le. It doesn’t always do so: Some 
scanned documents do not have embedded text, so the annotation tools are 
unavailable. PDFpen and Acrobat Pro, covered later, can ﬁ x this problem.
Preview’s Link tool lets you include links to a different page in the same PDF 
ﬁ le or to an external Web site. To do this, choose Tools ➧ Annotate ➧ Add Link. 
Then use the mouse to click and drag a link box over the relevant portion of your 
PDF document. Once you have created the link box, Preview prompts you to 
either create a link within the PDF document or to an external Web page. The link 
is not active, however, until you save, close, and reopen the ﬁ le.
www.ebook777.com

Quite often, multipage PDF documents may be out of order or contain extra, 
unwanted pages. Using the Preview sidebar, shown in Figure 12-3 and accessed 
by clicking the Sidebar button in the Preview toolbar or pressing Shift+J+D, you 
can view all the pages of a PDF document. Working in the Preview sidebar, you 
can click and drag to rearrange pages or delete pages by selecting them with the 
mouse and pressing the Delete key. 
You can combine two  PDF documents in Preview by dragging pages to and 
from the sidebars. You can also merge an entire PDF ﬁ le by dragging the PDF ﬁ le 
icon into the Preview sidebar of another PDF ﬁ le. After you merge, you can then 
rearrange or delete pages further from the Preview sidebar. Once saved, all the 
pages will be combined into a single PDF ﬁ le.
Preview makes it easy to export pages from a PDF ﬁ le. If you have a large PDF 
ﬁ le and need to send a few pages to a colleague, select the pages in the sidebar 
and then drag them onto the desktop. Preview makes a copy of the pages as 
a separate PDF ﬁ le. When selecting pages in the sidebar, Shift+clicking selects 
consecutive pages, whereas J+clicking selects pages out of sequence.
Considering that Preview comes free on every new Mac, it has a surprising 
number of PDF management and annotation features. However, Preview is still 
missing several tools useful for working with PDF ﬁ les. If Preview isn’t enough for 
you, consider using one of the dedicated PDF applications.

PDFpen
Smile Software’s  PDFpen ($50; www.smilesoftware.com), shown 
in Figure 12-4, includes all the tools found in Preview and adds more PDF 
management and editing features.
PDFpen has several text- annotation tools, including ones to highlight (in 
multiple colors), strike-through, underline, and squiggle-underline. To apply 
annotations, ﬁ rst select the text, then apply the desired effect from the toolbar. 
PDFpen has a redaction tool that can block out or blur those portions of your 
PDF documents you want to keep private.
PDFpen gives you the ability to select text embedded in a  PDF document 
and change it using the Correct Text tool, activated by Control+clicking or right-
clicking the highlighted text. Once you complete correcting the text, you can save 
the ﬁ le and the corrected text is embedded in the PDF document. Although the 
Correct Text tool works great for correcting a few words or typos, if you intend to 
make signiﬁ cant changes to an article, I recommend going back to the original 
document, making the changes, and then resaving the PDF ﬁ le.
Scanning software often saves scanned documents as an image without 
recognizing the text; as a result,  you cannot edit or annotate the text in the 
PDF document. If your PDF document is just an image without embedded 
www.ebook777.com

text, PDFpen can perform optical character recognition ( OCR) on the scanned 
image to reconstruct the text and add it to the PDF document ﬁ le so you can 
later annotate, edit, and search it. The PDFpen OCR engine does a good job of 
recognizing printed text, but it cannot recognize handwriting.
If you receive electronic documents requiring your signature, PDFpen has 
tools for digitally signing the document on screen with a mouse, pen tablet, or 
a saved digital version of your signature. You can use a scanned version of your 
signature and PDFpen can make the image transparent, as shown in Figure 12-5. 
First, choose Edit ➧ Make Transparent Image; then you can move the signature 
image in your document and proportionally resize it by holding down the Shift 
key and moving the resizing handles.
PDFpen features more annotation shapes than Preview, including polygons, 
rounded-corner boxes, and a free-form scribble in addition to rectangles and 
ovals. You can further customize the shapes ﬁ lls, line color and thickness, and 
opacity settings. Except for the Rectangle and Oval annotation tools, Preview 
does not allow you to insert graphics and images in your PDF documents. 
PDFpen does. In addition to adding and manipulating graphics, PDFpen allows 
you to move, resize, copy, and delete images in the original PDF ﬁ le. This is 
convenient for business use. For example, I use PDFpen to insert an image as a 
semitransparent watermark on important documents.
PDFpen works with interactive  PDF forms. When you click in a ﬁ eld, a blue 
border appears, and you can type in the form. For noninteractive forms (forms 
with spaces but no built-in ﬁ elds), choose Tools ➧ Text Tool (similar to Adobe 
Acrobat’s Typewriter tool) to create a ﬁ eld and type in the blank space. If your 

form requires several entries, double-clicking the Text tool in the toolbar keeps it 
active so you can quickly move through the PDF document. 
The PDFpen Library Panel allows you to collect commonly used graphics 
such as  watermarks, diagrams, and company logos for repeated use. (Choose 
Window ➧ Library to open it.) Assuming you are comfortable with the security 
risks, you can save your signature to your image library. The Library panel also 
includes proofreading marks, shown in Figure 12-6, with more than 100 standard 
editing marks, for use in your PDF document.
Finally, PDFpen includes automation support, allowing you to customize 
repeated PDF management tasks using AppleScript, which is covered in Chapter 24. 
PDFpenPro
PDFpenPro, ($100; www.smilesoftware.com) includes all the PDFpen 
features plus the ability to add tables of contents and create ﬁ llable forms.
The Table of Contents feature, shown in Figure 12-7, is PDFpenPro’s version 
of bookmarks in Adobe Acrobat Pro. It allows you to set jump points in long PDF 
documents, making them easier to navigate. The table-of-contents entries can be 
nested, so you can, for example, have one group of content entries called Contract 
and another group of content entries in a group called Attachments. If you are 
sharing PDF documents with Adobe Acrobat Pro (Windows or Mac OS X versions), 
everything works: PDFpenPro reads Acrobat Pro bookmark entries as table-of-
contents entries and Acrobat Pro reads the PDFpenPro entries as bookmarks. 
Using PDFpenPro you can also build cross-platform PDF  forms. You can 
add text ﬁ elds, check boxes, and buttons and save the PDF document as a ﬁ llable 
form usable on both Mac OS X and Windows. To prepare a ﬁ llable PDF form in 
PDFpenPro, use the Text Field pop-up menu in the toolbar to insert a text ﬁ eld, 
check box, or radio button. If you are adding a text ﬁ eld, click and drag the tool 
over the blank area of your PDF document. Check boxes and radio buttons can 
likewise be dropped on your document and sized and labeled appropriately. You 
can set default values for your ﬁ elds where appropriate and limit the number of 
characters in text boxes. 
www.ebook777.com

Adobe  Acrobat Pro
Adobe Acrobat Pro ($449; www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro), 
shown in Figure 12-8, is the most feature-rich PDF editor on the Mac. (Adobe 
does not sell its $299  Acrobat Standard application for Mac OS X.) Adobe is the 
originator of the PDF format and, as a result, Acrobat has a lot of features for 
managing and altering PDF ﬁ les.
In addition to reading PDF ﬁ les, Acrobat Pro accepts Web pages and image 
ﬁ les. Like PDFpen, Acrobat Pro can perform  optical character recognition. Adobe 
didn’t stop there, however: Acrobat Pro also allows you to insert 3D animations 
and video in your PDF documents.
Acrobat Pro has a rich tool set for PDF   markup. You can highlight, underline, 
and cross out text. You can also insert many graphic forms, including callouts, text 
boxes, arrows, rectangles, ovals, lines, polygons, and a useful cloud tool. You can 
even attach ﬁ les and audio notes as comments.
Acrobat Pro also features advanced  security tools. You can encrypt your 
PDF ﬁ les with 256-bit encryption. As with PDFpen, if your PDF ﬁ le contains 
conﬁ dential information, you can use Acrobat Pro’s Redaction tools to strike out 
portions and permanently delete information, including text and images, from 
the PDF ﬁ le. Adobe Acrobat Pro also allows you to use a digital ID to verify your 
documents came from a trusted source.

Another Acrobat Pro feature is the ability to create PDF portfolios that 
combine multiple documents in a single  PDF package. You can customize your 
PDF portfolio with headers, footers, and watermarks. A portfolio is not limited 
to just PDF ﬁ les. It can also hold Microsoft Ofﬁ ce documents and image ﬁ les. 
The documents are kept in their native format, so you can open them in the 
appropriate applications. Although you could largely duplicate this feature by 
creating a  Zip archive, a capability built into Mac OS X, PDF portfolios are more 
presentation-friendly: You can open a portfolio as part of a presentation and 
jump between the portfolio documents. 
The collaboration tools in Acrobat Pro are impressive. Comments for 
individual team members are all tracked. Users can also comment on a PDF 
document using Adobe’s free Reader application, covered later. Because Acrobat 
Pro allows you to embed video in PDF ﬁ les, the markup and annotation tools 
additionally provide frame-speciﬁ c feedback. 
The Acrobat Pro PDF  form tools go beyond anything else available on Mac 
OS X. In addition to the ability to create ﬁ llable forms, Acrobat Pro can assist 
with form distribution and collection. Once you distribute an Acrobat Pro created 
form, Acrobat Pro can track which users have submitted completed forms and 
send reminders to users who still have incomplete forms. 
www.ebook777.com


In addition to Acrobat Pro, Adobe publishes  Reader. This free application 
allows users to view and ﬁ ll in PDF forms. Because every new Mac ships with 
Preview already installed, Reader is largely unnecessary in Mac OS X. Preview is 
faster, is more stable, and includes more features than Adobe Reader. Also, several 
security ﬂ aws have been discovered in Reader. The only reason to install Reader is 
if you work on a team that uses the collaborative features of Acrobat Pro. (Acrobat 
Pro can track comments made in Reader.)
Which PDF Document Application?
With varying prices and features, summarized in Table 12-1, deciding which 
PDF document application to use can quickly become overwhelming. 
If you are not sure what is best for you, start with  Preview. It is free and 
already on your Mac. If you need more PDF tools, move up to  PDFpen. At $50, 
this application has many features comparable to Adobe Acrobat Pro at a fraction 
of the price. If you know you need form creation or the table of contents features, 
try  PDFpenPro; it is still signiﬁ cantly less expensive than Adobe Acrobat Pro. 
(PDFpen and PDFpenPro both offer a free 30-day trial.) If you still need more 
features, get Adobe  Acrobat Pro. But note that the extensive features available 
in Acrobat Pro come at a cost, and not just price: Acrobat is slow to load and 
generally more sluggish than Preview and PDFpen. 
CONVERTING PDF DOCUMENTS
Although there are several tools to convert your documents to PDF 
format, what about the other way around? The PDF format has become so 
universal that sometimes you receive PDF documents that you want to open 
in a word processor or spreadsheet application.
PDF2Ofﬁ ce ($129; www.recosoft.com) converts PDF ﬁ les to 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce format. For Word, the conversion doesn’t just extract the 
text ﬁ le, it tries to re-create the PDF formatting as Word formatting — and 
it does a credible (but rarely perfect) job of it: It creates frames, headers, 
footers, footnotes, and columns. PDF2Ofﬁ ce also converts PDF documents to 
Excel, PowerPoint,  Rich Text Format (RTF), and the Web HTML formats.
Recosoft also publishes the $59  PDF2Ofﬁ ce for iWork, which converts PDF 
documents to Apple’s Pages and Keynote formats. The PDF ﬁ le’s formatting 
is replicated in the converted paragraphs and graphic elements in  iWork.

Graphics for 
Graphics for 
Business
Business
N
o matter what your business, at some point you are likely to show a 
product, concept, or idea visually. This used to be possible only by 
hiring an artist or graphics designer. Graphics are not nearly so hard as 
they used to be. From its very inception, graphics designers embraced the Mac. 
As Macs have become more powerful and software more sophisticated, all Mac 
workers now have the ability to create compelling  diagrams and graphics with 
very little time and effort. This chapter presents easy-to-use applications for 
business graphics. Although Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are impressive, 
their expense and complexity don’t lend them to business graphics and so I do 
not cover them in this chapter.
OmniGraffle
OmniGrafﬂ e ($100; www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle) is 
the premier diagramming tool on the Mac. As shown in Figure 13-1, when you 
ﬁ rst open OmniGrafﬂ e, it gives you a choice of 16 template forms. The templates 
include organizational charts, hierarchical structures, and mind-mapping. You 
can also create custom templates.
Once you start a new project, OmniGrafﬂ e opens the main window, shown 
in Figure 13-2. The toolbar includes the most frequently used tools. With 
OmniGrafﬂ e, you can create multipage diagrams. Each page is called a canvas. You 
can display or hide the canvases using the Canvases iconic button in the toolbar.
The drawing tools
The toolbar also has several basic drawing tools, including the Selection tool, 
Shape tool, Line tool, and Text tool. Each tool has a small triangle icon in the 
lower-right corner; clicking the triangle displays additional options for each tool. 
Clicking on the tool divider (to the immediate right of the Text tool in Figure 
13-2) opens the remaining drawing tools in the toolbar. The expanded toolbar is 
shown in Figure 13-2. (You can also customize which tools appear in the toolbar 
in the Drawing Tools pane in the Preferences dialog box.)
www.ebook777.com


The Selection tool
This tool looks like the standard Mac OS X mouse pointer. Using this tool, 
you can select and move objects around the screen. You can also select multiple 
objects (by clicking the objects while holding the Shift key or clicking and 
dragging a selection box around the desired objects) and move them as a group.
If your object is resizable, it will sprout eight selection handles when you 
click on it with the Selection tool. You can then resize the object by grabbing a 
handle and dragging it with the mouse or trackpad. If you Shift+drag the handle, 
the object is resized proportionally. If you J+drag a handle, you can rotate an 
object.
When resizing or moving objects, you can take advantage of OmniGrafﬂ e’s 
smart guides. To activate smart guides in OmniGrafﬂ e, choose Arrange ➧ Guides 
➧ Smart Alignment Guides and then choose Arrange ➧ Guides ➧ Smart Distance 
Guides. Smart guides automatically generate measurement guides that show 
the spacing and sizing of objects as you move objects around your OmniGrafﬂ e 
canvas, similar to the guides in Keynote (covered in Chapter 14).
The Shape tool
You create shapes with the Shape tool. To do so, pick a shape, then click and 
drag on the canvas. There are several shapes available. More can be added using 
the Stencil tool, covered later in this chapter.
By default, if you choose the Shape tool, it remains selected so you can draw 
multiple objects. If you just want to draw one shape, click the Shape tool; a small 
blue circle with the numeral 1 appears, which indicates the Shape tool will work 
only once and then OmniGrafﬂ e will revert to the Selection tool.
The Line tool
There are several styles of lines you can draw with the Line tool, including 
straight, curved, orthogonal (perpendicular), and Bézier (highly customizable 
curves). A Bézier curve is shown in Figure 13-2.
When drawing a line in OmniGrafﬂ e, you can constrain the line to 45-degree 
increments by holding down the Shift key. (When the line is at the length and at 
the location you want, release the mouse button and then the Shift key.) You can 
also add labels to lines by creating a text item (with the Text tool explained on the 
next page) and dragging it onto the line until the line becomes highlighted. 
If you want to connect two shapes with a line, select the Line tool and then, 
rather than drawing a line, click the two shapes you want to connect; OmniGrafﬂ e 
creates a line between the two shapes. Afterward, when you move the shape with 
the Selection tool, the line follows.
www.ebook777.com

The Text tool
Clicking the Text tool turns the pointer into a cursor-insertion point. You 
can click anywhere on your canvas and start typing text. That is not the only way 
to add text in OmniGrafﬂ e: You can also add text to a shape by double-clicking 
inside it. You can make adjustments to the text using the Text inspector (covered 
later). Interestingly, OmniGrafﬂ e adds all text inside your canvas to the ﬁ le’s 
Spotlight index, so you can then search your OmniGrafﬂ e documents using 
Spotlight (covered in Chapter 1).
The Pen tool
You use the Pen tool to create custom shapes in OmniGrafﬂ e. To create a 
custom shape, click anywhere on the canvas. Then continue clicking to add points 
to your shape. When you double-click (or press Return), the shape is completed. 
You can drag and adjust your shape points or use the Bézier handles to customize 
the shape.
The Diagramming tool
This tool is helpful when quickly assembling a diagram (such as during a 
meeting). With the Diagramming tool is selected, click on any empty space on 
the canvas to create a generic shape that is automatically selected. With that ﬁ rst 
shape selected, click any empty spot and a new shape is connected to the original. 
If you leave the second shape selected and Option+click another empty space, 
OmniGrafﬂ e creates a sibling shape (connected to the same parent). Holding the 
Shift key instead of Option creates an aunt (connected as a sibling to the parent). 
Holding the J key creates a separate, disconnected shape. Once you master the 
modiﬁ er keys, you can assemble professional-looking diagrams quickly, as shown 
in Figure 13-3.
The Style Brush tool
Say you just created a diagram using the Diagramming tool, with seven 
different shapes that are all plain white boxes. You then use inspectors to give 
one of the boxes just the right shading, shadow, and other graphic elements. 
You don’t want to repeat that task for each of the other six boxes. Using the Style 
Brush tool, you can copy the styling of your customized box and paste it to each 
of the remaining six. Select the Style Brush tool, click the source shape that has 
the styling you want to copy, and then click on each of the remaining shapes to 
paste that formatting.
In addition to the Style Brush tool, the lower-left corner of the main 
OmniGrafﬂ e window holds the Styles tray, shown in Figure 13-2. The Styles tray 
also lets you copy and paste styles.

The Rubber Stamp tool
This tool lets you take any existing object and duplicate it, multiple times. 
Select the tool and click any object. Once selected, the dot on the Rubber Stamp 
tool icon changes from white to dark. The dark dot indicates the Rubber Stamp 
tool has an image and is ready to duplicate it. In other words, when the dot is 
dark, the stamp has ink. After that, every click on the canvas with this tool creates 
an exact copy of the original object.
The Magnet tool
When attaching lines to different shapes, the default connection point is 
the center of the shape. The Magnet tool allows you to adjust the point. If, for 
example, you want all your lines to be attached to the lower-right corner of a box, 
select the Magnet tool and move the magnet to the lower-right corner and you are 
in business.
The Zoom tool
Sometimes you need to zoom in on your diagram to make ﬁ ne adjustments. 
Select the Zoom tool and click anywhere on the canvas to center on that point 
and double the zoom percentage. Use multiple clicks to zoom in quickly and 
www.ebook777.com

Option+click on the canvas to zoom out. To select a speciﬁ c portion of your 
canvas, click and drag a box while the Zoom tool is active. If you click and drag 
while holding the Option key, the selection centers itself on your starting point. 
Shift+click the Zoom tool to return your canvas to its actual size.
In addition to the Zoom tool, you can adjust the zoom level of your 
OmniGrafﬂ e document with the Zoom iconic button in the lower-right corner of 
the main canvas window, shown in Figure 13-2.
The Hand tool
This tool lets you grab and move the canvas. It is most helpful when you are 
zoomed in for detail work.
The Browse tool
You can build interactive OmniGrafﬂ e presentations that transition between 
diagrams. Use the Browse tool to set speciﬁ c actions to objects on your canvas 
for the presentation. In practice, my OmniGrafﬂ e diagrams are always a part of a 
bigger presentation in Keynote. As a result, I ﬁ nd little use for this feature.
To get a separate ﬂ oating tool palette with all the available drawing tools, 
choose Window ➧ Tool Palette.
The remaining tools in the toolbar include the Front and Back iconic buttons 
to set the order of objects in your OmniGrafﬂ e diagram, and Group and Ungroup 
iconic buttons to combine (or separate) multiple objects.
Using stencils
The Stencils tool is one of OmniGrafﬂ e’s best features. When you activate 
the Stencils inspector using the Stencils iconic button in the toolbar, you get the 
window shown in Figure 13-4. The Stencil library includes several prebuilt objects 
that you can drag and drop on your OmniGrafﬂ e document.
Using stencils takes the drudgery out of creating diagrams. You just 
drag in a series of prebuilt elements and arrange them on the OmniGrafﬂ e 
canvas. OmniGrafﬂ e ships with several stencil sets, including shapes, 
connections, textures, and ﬂ owcharts. Additional stencils are available at www.
graffletopia.com, including network diagramming, shapes and ﬁ gures for 
presentations, wireframe models for programming, and mind-mapping. As of 
this writing, the Web site has 80 pages of downloadable OmniGrafﬂ e stencils. 
Whether you are designing a new kitchen or creating the next great iPhone app, 
there are stencils for you.
The most recent version of OmniGrafﬂ e has built-in support for Grafﬂ etopia. 
(Choose Help ➧ Visit Grafﬂ etopia.) You can also search www.graffletopia.
com from the Stencil inspector and import new stencil sets without leaving 

OmniGrafﬂ e. To search Grafﬂ etopia from within OmniGrafﬂ e, click the 
selection triangle iconic button in the Stencil inspector’s search bar and choose 
Grafﬂ etopia. 
Inspectors
OmniGrafﬂ e’s inspector, activated by clicking the Inspector iconic button in 
the toolbar (shown in Figure 13-2), includes many ﬁ ne controls for your shapes. 
If, for example, you want to change the shape of the arrows at the end of your 
lines, go to the inspector. 
OmniGrafﬂ e also has the Mini Inspector, a context-sensitive bar just below 
the toolbar that displays attributes and tools for the selected object. The Mini 
Inspector is similar to the context-sensitive toolbar in the iWork applications. If, 
for example, you select a rectangle, the Mini Inspector indicates the size, location, 
line size, and other elements of the rectangle. The Mini Inspector also allows 
you to make adjustments, including adding ﬁ lls, shadows, line weight, and other 
rectangle attributes.
Organizational charts
Making  organizational charts is easy with OmniGrafﬂ e. To do so, start with 
one of the organizational chart templates. You can create an organizational chart 
on the OmniFocus canvas with the graphic objects (using the Diagramming tool 
covered earlier is helpful here) or create it as an outline in the View mode. As you 
www.ebook777.com

type in parent and children outline levels, OmniGrafﬂ e automatically creates a 
graphic representation on the canvas, as shown in Figure 13-5. 
After you are done, you can change the look and orientation of the 
organizational chart using the Diagram Layout inspector, shown in Figure 13-6. 
The magic of OmniGrafﬂ e is the ability to quickly create diagram elements 
and arrange them on the screen in relation to one another. You can label, 
connect, and color elements to create impressive-looking diagrams. There is 
an  iPad version that lets you create, view, and edit OmniGrafﬂ e diagrams on 
the iPad. You can also add downloaded stencil sets to the OmniGrafﬂ e iPad 
application through iTunes (see Chapter 7).
Once your diagram is complete, OmniGrafﬂ e offers several export options, 
including Photoshop (.psd), PDF, JPEG, and vector images. Normally, I export 
completed OmniGrafﬂ e images as PNG ﬁ les and deselect the Include Non-
Printing Layers check box. The image has a transparent background and can be 
imported into Keynote or Pages without a background.
OmniGrafﬂ e also has a professional version that costs $200. It includes 
several additional features, including subgraphs (which can be contained inside 
larger graphs), shared layers, support for multiple windows, and greater export 
options, such as to Microsoft Visio.

OmniGrafﬂ e is one of my secret weapons. Often, in advance of an important 
meeting or presentation, I will spend just a few minutes putting together a 
diagram of important points. It doesn’t take long once you get the mechanics 
of OmniGrafﬂ e down. Then inevitably someone who attended the meeting will 
ask what company I used to produce my graphics. My answer is always the same. 
“You can’t afford my graphics department.”
Apple  Preview
Apple Preview comes free on every new Mac. Chapter 12 covers Preview’s 
PDF features, but it has more capabilities than just working with PDF ﬁ les or 
looking at other images. Although you cannot create graphics with Preview like 
you can with OmniGrafﬂ e, it is handy for working with existing images.
Quite often you have an image that needs resizing, cropping, or other 
tweaking before you can use it in a graphic or a presentation. Previously, Mac 
users used expensive image applications for this purpose. But for most needs, you 
can now get away with using Preview.
Preview image tools
To change an image’s size, open the  image in Preview and choose Tools ➧ 
Adjust Size. You then get the dialog box shown in Figure 13-7, which lets you 
resize an image. You can change the size using pixels, inches, centimeters, and 
several other units of measure. To keep the image proportional, select the Scale 
Proportionally check box. Selecting the Resample image check box helps keep the 
image quality as you make it smaller. It is usually a bad idea to make an image 
bigger in Preview: The enlargement process makes the image look pixelated 
(blocky).
Cropping is also easy with Preview. Click the Select button in the Preview 
toolbar, then (using the mouse) select the portion of the image you want to 
keep. If the Select button’s icon is not a square, click and hold it and choose the 
www.ebook777.com

Rectangle Selection tool. Once you’ve selected the portion of the image to crop, 
choose Tools ➧ Crop or press J+K.
The  annotation tools covered in Chapter 12 are also available for images. You 
can add lines, ovals, and rectangles to your pictures. You can also type in labels 
and annotations. Preview lets you adjust colors, brightness, exposure, and other 
image settings. Using Preview, you can avoid loading a separate image editor for 
most small adjustments.
Removing backgrounds
Preview also lets you remove backgrounds from images. Let’s say you have an 
image of a baseball and you want to include it in a presentation. You only want 
the round ball in the Keynote slide, though. You don’t want a rectangular image 
and the background. 
First, you need to extract the image, so choose the Smart Lasso tool from the 
Select pop-up menu in the Preview toolbar. Then use the mouse to trace the edge 
of the image you want to extract (in this case, the ball). Make sure the thick lasso 
line does not touch the edge of the ball.
Once you complete the circle with the Lasso tool, you can delete the 
background, as shown in Figure 13-8. First, reverse the selection (choose Edit ➧ 
Invert Selection), then press Delete.
If the Smart Lasso tool doesn’t completely remove the background, Preview 
has another tool, Instant Alpha, that will ﬁ nish the job. The Instant Alpha tool, 
found in the Select pop-up menu in the Preview toolbar, looks at an image and 
tries to remove the background. To use the Instant Alpha tool, place the cursor 
in the background and then hold down the mouse button as you slowly drag 
the mouse away from the point of origin; Preview removes the background. The 
further away you drag the mouse, the more aggressive Preview is about removing 
the background. If you go too far, move the mouse back toward the point of 

www.ebook777.com

origin. Once you have it just right, press Return. Although not perfect, Instant 
Alpha does a good job removing the background. 
The Instant Alpha tool is also available in Keynote (covered in Chapter 14), 
Pages (covered in Chapter 11), and Numbers (covered in Chapter 15); in Keynote, 
Instant Alpha is really helpful for pulling the background off images. Figure 13-9 
shows the ﬁ nalized image in a Keynote slide.
Removing backgrounds from images used to be a painstaking process 
accomplished only with expensive graphics software. Using Preview’s Smart Lasso 
and Instant Alpha tools, you now have this ability on every Mac. 
Other Graphics Software
Adobe  Photoshop ($700; www.adobe.com/products/photoshop) and 
Adobe  Illustrator ($700; www.adobe.com/products/illustrator) are 
the leading photo and drawing applications for Mac OS X. They are also very 
expensive and, for the types of graphics contemplated by this book, something 
like killing a gnat with a hand grenade. These applications are powerful and 
complicated. Some users spend years perfecting their skills with these tools but 
they are not necessary for making simple graphs, charts, and illustrations. 
 Pixelmator ($60; www.pixelmator.com) and  Acorn ($50; www.
flyingmeat.com/acorn) are both less-expensive alternatives to Photoshop 
and Illustrator with smaller feature sets. Both applications are good options for 
drawing and working on images. Pixelmator uses more of the look and feel of 
Adobe Photoshop, while Acorn has its own unique interface.
Using  OmniGraphSketcher for graphs ($30; www.omnigroup.com/
products/omnigraphsketcher) and  Timeline 3D for timelines ($65; www.
beedocs.com) are also useful niche graphics applications. OmniGraphSketcher is 
covered in more detail in Chapter 15, and Timeline 3D is covered in Chapter 14.

Presentations
Presentations
B
ecause I’m a trial lawyer in my day job, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking 
about and giving presentations over the years. There was a time when 
going to trial meant heading to the local copier to get blow-ups the size 
of coffee tables and loading up on felt-tip pens. Presentation software started as 
a new and liberating tool to avoid the super-sized copies and let people create 
interactive presentations. Sadly, presentation software has been abused to such an 
extent that audiences now groan when they walk in a room and see a projector.
In many ways, presentation software is the poster-child example of why the 
Mac is such a great ﬁ t for work. Macintosh hardware and software combine to let 
you make fantastic presentations that will turn your audience from a “death by 
PowerPoint” mentality to attentive listeners while you make your case.
Keynote versus PowerPoint
Keynote is the presentation component of Apple’s  iWork ofﬁ ce suite ($79; 
www.apple.com/iwork). In comparing iWork’s other components (Pages 
and Numbers) to Microsoft Ofﬁ ce (Word and Excel), I’ve found an argument for 
all contenders. But this is not the case with Keynote. Keynote is so superior to 
PowerPoint that even if you have no intention of ever using Pages or Numbers, 
Keynote alone is worth iWork’s $79 price tag.
Although PowerPoint has made progress with recent releases, it still does 
not hold a candle to Keynote on the Mac. This is partly because of how well 
Keynote integrates with Mac OS X, as covered later, and also partly because of the 
complete saturation PowerPoint has obtained in corporate America. PowerPoint 
is everywhere, and people are sick of it. They are tired of the same themes, 
transitions, and fonts. Often jurors who work in sales will ask me for copies of my 
“PowerPoint” after a trial. They know it is better (and different) from their own, 
but they can’t put their ﬁ nger on why. I wish I had a cut of all the Macs I’ve sold 
after explaining it was a Keynote presentation that I gave.
www.ebook777.com

Apple iWork Keynote
Keynote is, in my opinion, the best presentation software available on any 
computing platform.
Creating a presentation
When creating a  presentation in Keynote, you ﬁ rst choose a theme and screen 
resolution, as shown in Figure 14-1. The resolution should match your projector 
but can be changed later in the Keynote inspector’s Document pane (press 
Option+J+I). 
As an alternative,  Keynote can import PowerPoint presentations, doing 
a credible job of importing PowerPoint ﬁ les. However, because the Keynote 
transitions, graphics, and fonts are different, you will need to check your slides.
Like the other applications in the iWork suite, there is no automatic save 
function in Keynote. Remember to save your ﬁ le (press J+S) often.
Keynote includes 44 built-in themes, which are professionally designed and 
look great. You can also create your own custom themes or purchase third-party 
themes. A good source of Keynote themes is www.keynoteuser.com.
Setting a theme does more than give you a color scheme and font selection. 
The Keynote themes also include stylized graphics and a series of professionally 
designed slides for different elements of a presentation, including bullet points, 
pictures, and graphics. You can access these master slides by clicking the Masters 
iconic button in the toolbar, as shown in Figure 14-2.

There are several advantages to using slide masters.  Master slides provide an 
easy way to apply consistent formatting throughout your presentation. When 
an audience sees a presentation that has different indentation on every slide, it 
notices. Indeed, they may start thinking more about where the next text block 
will appear than the actual content of your presentation. The slide masters also 
provide uniﬁ ed animations, frames, and media presentation.
A lot of users don’t realize you can use more than one theme in a single 
presentation. If you want the presentation to use the Gradient theme but prefer 
how the Showroom theme displays pictures, you can mix and match the two 
themes. To do this, ﬁ rst build your presentation in Gradient theme, then select 
the photo slide only and change the theme to Showroom (using the Theme 
iconic button in the toolbar). 
Outlines and Keynote
It is a good idea to start your  presentation with an outline. There are several 
ways you can do this with Keynote. In Keynote, you can create an outline by using 
the Keynote Outline view by choosing View ➧ Outline; the application presents 
an outline view of your presentation in the slide navigator on the left side of the 
screen. You will see the title and bullet points for every slide; if the slide does 
not contain any text, it appears empty. You can edit the text directly in the slide 
www.ebook777.com

navigator, which is useful for proofreading slides. In Outline view, you can further 
delete, duplicate, move, and add slides. If you select a slide in outline view and 
press Tab (or drag the slide’s icon to the right), you demote that slide into a bullet 
point on the prior slide. Conversely, you can Shift+Tab a bullet (or drag it to the 
left) to make it an independent slide.
You can create an outline in  OmniOutliner (covered in Chapter 10) 
and export it directly to Keynote; you get a new presentation with bullets for 
each of your subpoints. If you choose to outline your Keynote presentation 
in OmniOutliner, each new slide must be a Level 1 outline item. If your 
OmniOutliner outline only has three Level 1 points with many subpoints, your 
imported Keynote presentation will have only three slides with many, many 
bullet points.
When starting a presentation from an outline, be careful. Just because you 
can create outlines with bullet point slides, don’t create a text-heavy, boring 
Keynote presentation that puts your audience to sleep. Instead, use the outlining 
procedure to create a structure for your presentations. For example, I might make 
a Level 1 outline entry in OmniOutliner called Hammer Photo. When imported 
into Keynote, that Level 1 entry becomes a slide named Hammer Photo that 
serves as a reminder to ﬁ nd an interesting image to hammer home whatever point
I am making. Many of the Level 1 outline entries I use are simply labels (like 
Timeline, Graph, or Image) for slides that never get any text.
Using objects
Objects are the bits of  text and graphics you put on a blank slide. Keynote 
objects include text, graphics, tables, charts, pictures, movies, and links. You 
can select, move, copy, resize, rotate, and ﬂ ip objects. Keynote’s copy and paste 
functionality not only remembers the object size and look but also its location. 
If, for example, you want your company logo to appear in the lower corner of a 
series of slides, you can put it in the same position on each slide by copying it 
from one slide and manually pasting it into every subsequent slide.
The trick to using Keynote objects is to keep  the inspector open (open it by 
pressing Option+J+I). A little known Keynote fact is that you can open multiple 
inspectors by choosing View ➧ New Inspector. When building a presentation, 
I open three inspectors: one with text tools, another with graphics tools, and 
a third with animations. As long as you have the available screen real estate, it 
speeds things up for you.
Once you’ve created a slide, you can resize the text box or click inside it and 
start typing. By default, if your text exceeds the size of the box, Keynote displays 
an icon of a small box with a + (plus) inside it at the bottom of the text box, to 
indicate there is additional text. You can resize the box to display all your entered 

text, or you can click the + iconic button to shrink the text to ﬁ t in the box. 
Keynote also spell-checks your text, and puts a dotted line under suspect words.
You can adjust the text formatting using the Text inspector, as Figure 14-3 
shows. Using the Text inspector, you can adjust the justiﬁ cation, spacing, margins, 
and other text attributes. 
Use text sparingly in your presentations . A good rule of thumb is to make 
certain no text in your presentation is set to a point size smaller than one-half the 
age of the oldest listener in your audience. Lots of small type on the screen simply 
doesn’t get read. Also, don’t go crazy with fonts and colors.
Keynote gives you the option of adding hyperlinks to your text, using the 
Hyperlink inspector. When you click hyperlinked text, Keynote jumps to the 
designated slide, to a separate Keynote presentation, or to an external Web page. 
Hyperlinks can be very powerful: If you’re giving an interactive presentation 
where the order of the slides may vary, you can create an index slide with a list of 
the available subjects and hyperlink each entry to the starting slide number for 
that subject.
Keynote provides a full suite of graphics tools, including lines and shapes. 
Graphics can be added using  the Shapes iconic button in the toolbar or choosing 
Insert ➧ Shapes. Once you create a shape in your Keynote slide, you can resize it, 
move it, and change its formatting using the graphics inspector. The Graphics 
inspector is contextually sensitive to the selected shape: If you select a line, you 
get line tools (including end points and thickness). If you select a rectangle, you 
get ﬁ ll and gradient tools. When working with shapes, I recommend keeping the  
Graphics inspector open.
One of the biggest advantages of creating your graphics in Keynote is 
the Keynote smart guides feature. Keynote includes an ingenious system for 
constantly measuring the relative position of all objects on the screen in 
www.ebook777.com

comparison to other objects. This capability lets you snap a line of text to the 
center or offset two boxes with very little work, as shown in Figure 14-4. 
Using Keynote’s tools, you will quickly be able to put together formidable 
graphics. But you can also create your own graphics for Keynote in other 
applications, like OmniGrafﬂ e (covered in Chapter 13) or OmniGraphSketcher 
(covered in Chapter 15). When exporting graphics for Keynote, save the image 
as a PNG ﬁ le with a transparent background. This way, when you drag the 
image into Keynote, the background is already removed. If you need to remove 
the background from an imported graphic, you can use the Instant Alpha tool 
(covered in Chapter 13) in the Keynote toolbar.
You can also add hyperlinks to graphics. If, for example, you create a Keynote 
presentation with an index slide that has a list of subjects, you can create a small 
icon (I make one that looks like a home button) and put it in the bottom-right 
corner of each slide. At any point during the presentation, I can return to the 
index slide by clicking on the icon. 
Keynote includes impressive  table and chart tools. (The 3D charts are 
particularly attractive.) You can create your own tables and charts in Keynote or 
import them from  Numbers (covered in Chapter 15). If you’re using a consistent 
theme, Keynote automatically applies theme-based formatting to charts and 

tables. You can adjust individual charts and tables using the Chart  inspector, 
which is context-sensitive. For example, the tools for a bar chart are different from 
the tools for a pie cart. Figure 14-5 shows a sample Keynote chart.
You can add images to Keynote slides by simply dragging them onto the 
slide. You can then format them using the Graphics inspector. Keynote also lets 
you add masks, frames, lines, and shadows to the image, as well as adding a text 
box to annotate an image.
If you want to show multiple images on a single Keynote slide, you can use 
the Keynote  smart build feature (choose Insert ➧ Smart Build). When creating a 
smart build, you can choose the transition method and drag in multiple images. 
When you arrive at that slide in your presentation, Keynote transitions through 
each image. If you use images repeatedly, add them to your iPhoto library so 
you can access them directly in Keynote using the Inspector iconic button in the 
toolbar.
You can import an iMovie  or a  QuickTime movie onto a slide. Using the 
Keynote QuickTime  inspector, you can set the start and end playback points, as 
well choose the poster frame, which is the image shown on the screen when the 
movie is not playing.
When working with multiple objects, you need to pay attention to the 
display order (also called the  stacking order) of each object. If, for example, you 
www.ebook777.com

want text to appear on top of a solid box, make certain the object holding the box 
is behind the object holding the text. Otherwise the text is hidden.
You can adjust the order of your objects by selecting an object and then 
choosing Arrange ➧ Bring Forward or Arrange ➧ Send Backward to change its place 
in the display order. You can also adjust the order of objects by Control+clicking 
or right-clicking on the object and then, via the contextual menu, move the object 
forward or backward.
Animations and transitions
You can animate objects (making them appear, disappear, and move) in 
Keynote using the Build  inspector. Depending on the type of object you are 
animating, Keynote provides a variety of effects.  
With animations, less is more. Despite the fact that Keynote gives you the 
ability to make words in the text box appear to burn up in ﬂ ames, it is not a 
reason to use it on every slide. Indeed, I’m still waiting for a presentation where 
that particular animation would be appropriate. Audiences quickly grow tired 
of excessive animations in your slides: It is like ending every sentence with an 
exclamation point! 
You can instruct Keynote to perform animations when you click the mouse 
or after a set amount of time. You can also set up animations to run in relation 
to one another. For example, you can animate the drawing of an arrow and then 
have Keynote create a text box at the end of the arrow. To do this, you use the 
Build inspector. First, click the More Options button at the bottom of the Build 
inspector to open a drawer that lists each object and its build order, as shown in 
Figure 14-6. You can click and drag objects in the build order list to change their 
appearance relative to other objects. When working on complicated animations, 
I keep this inspector open on the side of the Keynote window.
You use the slide inspector to access slide transitions, those interesting 
animations between slides. The same advice I gave in using animations applies to 
using slide transitions: Don’t overdo it. 
Keynote offers several 2D and 3D transitions. For most purposes, the 
Dissolve transition is all you need. However, when moving between major points 
in your presentation, you may want to ﬁ nd a more distinctive transition to cue 
the audience that you are moving to a new subject. 
One of the best additions to the most recent release of  Keynote is Magic 
Move. Magic Move is a slide transition that lets you select a series of objects on 
one slide and move them to pre-ordained positions on the next slide. To do this, 
ﬁ rst create a slide with objects. Then duplicate the slide (press J+D or choose 
Edit ➧ Duplicate). In the duplicated slide, move and resize your objects to their 

new locations. Finally go back to the ﬁ rst slide and set the slide transition to 
Magic Move. That’s it! 
When you give the presentation, the objects will automatically move and 
resize themselves. Before this feature was added to Keynote, moving multiple 
objects in one transition required you to painstakingly set the motion track and 
destination for each object. For complicated slides, this took hours.
Timelines
Quite often, you want to insert a  timeline in your Keynote presentation. 
There is no timeline object in Keynote so creating timelines is often a matter of 
building the individual graphic objects. If the timeline is simple, you can use a 
series of lines and text boxes. Using animation, you can build a timeline in front 
of your audience one piece at a time. If you have more complicated timelines, you 
can use a separate timeline application. 
One of my favorites is  Timeline 3D ($65; www.beedocs.com), shown in 
Figure 14-7. Timeline 3D does all the hard work of putting the text and timeline 
on the screen and ﬁ nding a way to make everything ﬁ t. You can then display the 
timeline as a static image or open it in 3D mode and move between each point 
on the screen. You can display your animation directly from Timeline 3D, using 
the arrow keys to move through the timeline. If you do so, be sure to hide your 
Keynote presentation by pressing the H key before switching to Timeline 3D. 
Alternatively, you could export the timeline from Timeline 3D as a 
QuickTime movie ﬁ le and place it in one of your Keynote slides. This is safer in 
front of an audience than exiting your presentation and displaying the timeline 
www.ebook777.com

in Timeline 3D. It lets you avoid that awkward moment of ﬁ nding your way back 
into Keynote and restarting the presentation. However, displaying the timeline as 
a pre-rendered movie does not let you ﬂ uidly move forward and backward in it as 
you can when working directly in Timeline 3D.
Organization and sharing
As your slideshow begins to take shape, you will inevitably want to 
reorganize. Keynote’s  Light Table view (choose View ➧ Light Table) is made for 
this purpose. Keynote presents thumbnail images of your slides, which you can 
select and move at will. The Light Table view is a good place to choose which 
slides you will want in your presentation. You can hide an individual slide by 
Control+clicking or right-clicking it and choosing Skip Slide from the contextual 
menu. The slide is then skipped when you give your presentation. You can add 
the slide back into the presentation by Control+clicking or right-clicking the slide 
and choosing Don’t Skip Slide from the contextual menu.
As you ﬁ nish building your presentation, always remember to put a blank 
slide at the end. This way, if you accidently click Forward at the end of your 
presentation, the presentation doesn’t exit to Keynote but instead just leaves an 
attractive blank screen.

Once your  presentation is ﬁ nished, you have several methods for sharing 
it. You can export it as a QuickTime movie and then play it on any computer 
(including Windows PCs) that has QuickTime installed. As part of the export 
settings, you can set the Keynote presentation-turned-QuickTime-movie for 
manual advance, as shown in Figure 14-8. The ﬁ nished movie will wait for a 
mouse click before each build — just as if it were being presented in Keynote. 
When giving important presentations, I always export and save a QuickTime 
version of the presentation on a USB thumb drive. That way, when I arrive for the 
presentation and all my computers choose that moment to implode, I can load 
the movie ﬁ le on any computer with QuickTime and give the presentation.
You can also save your completed Keynote presentation as a PDF ﬁ le or 
as a set of Web pages. You can even export it to  PowerPoint. However, because 
PowerPoint does not support the same transitions and effects as Keynote does, 
OTHER USES FOR KEYNOTE
Keynote is surprisingly useful. The Keynote graphic tools combined with 
the easy ability to animate objects makes it perfect for simple  video effects 
processing. You can create animated words or objects and then export the 
Keynote presentation as a QuickTime movie for later import into your movie 
editing software as a graphical effect. 
Another interesting use for  Keynote is as a sales kiosk. You can create 
a hyperlinked presentation with an index screen. Potential customers can 
then use the mouse to click any icon or words of interest and have the 
presentation jump to those slides. You can set up automatic transitions that, 
ultimately, return to the menu. I recently attended a conference where there 
was a 27-inch iMac with a mouse set up for just this purpose, and people 
were lined up in front of it all day.
www.ebook777.com

you will most likely not be satisﬁ ed with the results. Sending a well-designed 
Keynote presentation to PowerPoint feels something like putting Cheez Whiz on 
artisan bread.
Do note that  Keynote’s collaboration tools are limited. Using iWork.com, you 
can share your Keynote ﬁ le (for download as images or in Keynote or PowerPoint 
formats) or allow co-workers to annotate images of the Keynote presentation 
directly on  iWork.com. I ﬁ nd this useful when working with clients, as it allows 
them to make suggested changes and annotations without accessing the source 
ﬁ le.
Presentation day
As presentation day approaches, make sure to test your Keynote presentation 
with whatever projecting hardware you will be using. Make a list of whatever 
cables and extension cords you need — and check it twice.
Keynote has the  Presenter Display view mode that provides critical data on 
your Mac’s screen while projecting your presentation on the projector screen. 
Access this mode by choosing Play ➧ Customize Presenter Display, as shown in 
Figure 14-9.

You can customize the Presenter Display view mode to your liking. It 
includes options to show the current slide, the next slide, notes, a clock, a timer 
(showing time elapsed or time remaining), and an indicator that Keynote has 
completed all animations and is ready to advance to the next slide. I usually run 
it with a preview of the next slide and a clock.
Get to the location of your presentation early. Make certain you have enough 
time to set up and get through any last-minute problems before anyone arrives. 
I always make sure to run through the entire presentation once before anyone 
www.ebook777.com

in the audience shows up, so my movies are already in Keynote’s memory cache 
(which speeds up display and avoids awkward load times). 
While you are giving your presentation with Keynote, there are several handy 
keyboard shortcuts to remember, shown in Table 14-1.
You can advance your slides remotely using the $19  Apple Remote. I’m not 
a fan of Apple’s remote because it uses infrared wireless technology. Thus, if the 
remote loses the line of sight with your Mac’s infrared sensor, the Mac can’t see 
any of your remote control actions, so slides and builds will stop advancing. 
There are also a variety of iPhone applications and non-Apple  remotes that 
work over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. I recommend those instead. If you give lots of 
presentations, get a remote with a built-in laser pointer.
Microsoft PowerPoint
 PowerPoint is the presentation component of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2011 ($200; 
www.microsoft.com/mac). PowerPoint started life as a Mac application in 
1987 called Presenter. It was eventually acquired by Microsoft and incorporated 
into Microsoft Ofﬁ ce. Shown in Figure 14-10, PowerPoint for Mac has 
traditionally lagged behind PowerPoint for Windows. For example, PowerPoint 
2008 for Mac was unable to track changes if you were working on presentations 
with co-workers despite this feature being available on the Windows version. The 
ability to track changes was added in  PowerPoint 2011. Microsoft also restored 
Visual Basic support to PowerPoint 2011.
Like the rest of the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce suite, PowerPoint now uses the improved 
ribbon interface, making it easier to ﬁ nd desired features. It also includes 
improved SmartArt graphics that makes it easier to generate common graphics 
such as organizational charts and Venn diagrams.
In my years of using a Mac for presentations, I have never encountered 
another speaker that uses PowerPoint on the Mac. In fact, the truth is quite the 
opposite: I’ve met some speakers who want nothing to do with Mac OS X but 
nevertheless own a MacBook that is only used with one application, Keynote. 
Keynote has always had the edge with respect to clean font rendering, animations, 
and ease of use. Microsoft has made lots of progress in streamlining PowerPoint 
2011’s interface. It will be interesting to see if the changes cause more users to use 
PowerPoint.
So where does PowerPoint ﬁ t on the Mac? I still think it sits a distant second 
behind Keynote. However, if your co-workers don’t have Keynote and if you are 
required to use PowerPoint, it is at least available on the Mac. PowerPoint 2011 
is much closer to the Windows version than PowerPoint 2008 was, so there’ll be 
fewer hassles. Nevertheless, the graphics-intensive nature of presentation software 

means that compatibility issues will continue to arise between the Mac and 
Windows versions of PowerPoint. If using PowerPoint for Windows is absolutely 
critical, you are better off running it using virtualization software (covered in 
Chapter 22).
Presentation Mojo
So now that I’ve covered the how of presentation software, I’d like to cover 
the why. Speciﬁ cally, why do so many presentations stink and put the audience 
to sleep? Many users fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of presentation 
software. Presentation software does not exist to replace the speaker, it is there to 
enhance the speaker. But most presentations are all icing and no cake. 
Many people are afraid of public speaking, so they look at presentation 
software as the ultimate crutch. They type their entire speech into the presentation 
and then proceed to project it on the screen, turn their back to their audience, 
and read it. 
Every time I watch one of these presentations, my head gets fuzzy with the 
long sentences in small typeface and multiple bullets. Despite my best intentions, 
within minutes I am completely checked out and thinking about going to the 
beach. I’m not alone. The audience needs cake.
www.ebook777.com

Presentation software gives the speaker a tremendous opportunity. Studies have 
shown that most people don’t learn (and rarely remember) information presented 
to them in a verbal-only fashion. But when information is presented both verbally 
and visually, people are much more likely to understand and retain it. 
Presentation software lets you combine verbal and visual learning to make a 
maximum impact on your audience. But to do so, you need to stop using slides as 
giant shared cue cards and instead use them as tools to hammer your key points 
visually. This is not easy. It starts with you breaking down each presentation into 
its key components. A presentation is much like a story. It needs a beginning, 
middle, and an end. It needs to be emotional and involve your audience. 
I plan presentations using  mind-mapping software (like MindNode, 
covered in Chapter 10). In addition to outlining the general chronology of my 
presentation, I also give thought to the ebb and ﬂ ow of the points and how they 
ﬁ t together. Any presentation has high and low points. Spend time thinking about 
how best to ﬁ t them together. It is important that you arrange your presentation 
in a way that makes it relevant to your audience. Do not let them mentally go to 
the beach on your watch. 
This initial planning takes time. In my case, it usually takes hours (sometimes 
days). I was told once as a young lawyer that if I couldn’t summarize any case in 
two sentences, I didn’t know the case well enough. This advice applies equally 
to planning presentations. You need to spend lots of time looking at each 
component and distilling it down to its simplest form for your presentation. Your 
audience is not interested in doing the hard work of ﬁ guring out your product, 
plan, or case. You have to do it for them, in advance.
Once you have those simple pieces laid out, begin making slides. Pick the 
most important points and reinforce them with slides. The slides shouldn’t be 
ﬁ lled with bullets and words but instead with visual representations of your most 
important points. 
As an example, I once had a very complicated business case that involved a 
once-successful but now failed business, and there was a lot of talk about how 
and why that happened. I struggled with how to represent that business to the 
jury until I noticed a neighbor’s lawn was dying. I took a close picture of all 
this dead grass and then took another close picture of a different lawn that was 
healthy and green. I then used two slides (one with a green lawn and one with a 
dead lawn) to explain the business and the relative causes for why the grass died. 
It worked brilliantly, and the other lawyer’s random scribbling and ranting on 
a chalkboard never sunk home with the jury. Because the audience understood 
my analogy, they understood my argument. Pictures, analogies, and simpliﬁ ed 
data and graph slides are a great way to reinforce your points without losing your 
audience.

Once you’ve prepared a polished slide deck that includes fantastic icing, you 
still need to work on another part of the cake: your own presentation style. The 
sad truth is there is no magic formula to giving a good presentation. Instead, it 
comes down to spending an obscene amount of time practicing. When I give 
a big presentation, I practice it endlessly. I script it in my mind as I prepare 
the slides. I say the presentation out loud as I revise the slides. I give it in the 
mirror. I give the presentation to patient family members. I even talk through 
the presentation as I sit in trafﬁ c. There is no substitute for the process of getting 
the words from your mind to your lips many times. Until you are comfortable 
verbalizing your presentation, you are not ready. After you spend the time and 
effort perfecting your presentation, you will be full of conﬁ dence and fantastic.

Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets
 S
preadsheets, and their ability to quickly run many calculations, were 
the ﬁ rst “killer apps” for business computers. Thirty years later we still 
use spreadsheets on our computers, and there are several options for 
crunching numbers on your Mac. This chapter focuses on three — Microsoft 
Excel, Apple iWork Numbers, and Google Spreadsheets — that take different 
approaches to spreadsheets. You’ll also learn about OmniGraphSketcher, an 
application to help make better graphs and charts from your spreadsheet data.
Microsoft Excel
Microsoft Excel, shown in Figure 15-1, is part of the  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce suite. 
The Ofﬁ ce suite (www.microsoft.com/mac/products/office2011), 
includes Microsoft’s Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. The price for Ofﬁ ce 
varies from $120 (for the Home and Student Edition) to $200 (for the Home and 
Business Edition). 
Excel is the 800-pound gorilla of spreadsheet applications. Microsoft has 
been building on the Excel code for two decades — in fact, it was ﬁ rst created for 
the Mac back in 1985, then went on to Windows two years later — and has no 
equal in terms of calculating capability and features. 
Microsoft’s primary focus with Mac Excel is making it compatible with its 
Windows sibling. The Mac team at Microsoft strives to have the spreadsheet you 
create on your Mac in the airport open and run on the PC in the boardroom. If 
cross-platform compatibility with Windows Excel is essential, Mac Excel is your 
best bet. 
However, if you are switching from Windows, don’t expect Excel to look like 
Windows Excel. Two separate teams at Microsoft develop them. The user interfaces 
are different and so switching between them can take some getting used to. 
Also, even with the emphasis on cross-platform compatibility, it doesn’t 
always work. Opening Mac-created spreadsheets in Windows sometimes brings 
unexpected surprises. Missing fonts or differences in how Windows handles ﬁ les 
may distort or even break a Mac Excel spreadsheet. Mac Excel 2008 removed the 
Visual Basic macro language, making it impossible to use many Windows-based 
www.ebook777.com

Excel spreadsheets. This was, fortunately, remedied with the release of Mac Excel 
2011, which returns  Visual Basic to the Mac.
In addition to cross-platform compatibility, Excel is a powerful spreadsheet. 
It has more built-in calculations, formulas, and computing tools than any 
spreadsheet application. No matter how esoteric your formula, Microsoft has 
probably built a formula for it; and if Microsoft hasn’t, there’s likely a third-party 
add-on available. This is no small accomplishment, and it’s the reason most large 
companies rely so heavily on Excel. If, for example, you need to use the Weibull 
Statistical Probability Distribution, you need Excel. 
Despite its power, Mac users do not universally love the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 
suite. Traditionally, using Ofﬁ ce felt something like piloting a battleship. It was 
slow to start, slow to maneuver, and involved way too many buttons, switches, 
and levers. Microsoft has addressed some of these complaints with the release 
of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce for Mac 2011. Its user interface borrows the ribbon look 
from the Windows version of Ofﬁ ce, as shown in Figure 15-2. This is a notable 
improvement over prior versions that had mushroomed into a jumbled mess of 
options, buttons, and toolbars.
In the past, Microsoft Ofﬁ ce did not follow conventions used in most Mac 
OS X applications; it tended to use Windows conventions and some unique 

approaches Microsoft’s Mac Business Unit added that were neither Windows- nor 
Mac-standard. 
The newest version is more Mac-like. For example, the toolbar is displayed 
using Mac OS X’s  Core Animation framework, which provides smooth 
animations between the different ribbons. The Mac  ribbon is not identical to 
that in the Windows version but is close enough for users transitioning between 
operating systems. 
Although Microsoft is moving it in the right direction, Mac Excel remains 
very much a Microsoft product and still does not follow many standard Mac OS X 
guidelines. For example, although virtually all Mac applications tie into the Mac 
OS X  Recent Documents framework, Microsoft uses its own recent documents 
system, thus excluding the Ofﬁ ce applications from quick-launching documents 
in  LaunchBar (covered in Chapter 3).
www.ebook777.com

Microsoft Excel offers multiple chart styles, as shown in Figure 15-3. As 
a result of the application’s maturity, there are a variety of three-dimensional 
and two-dimensional charts available. Whether you require stacked pyramids, 
exploding pie charts, or a mixture of both, Excel has you covered. 
Mac Excel 2011 adds a new type of  chart called  sparklines. Sparklines are 
charts and graphs the size of words that ﬁ t directly in the spreadsheet. Rather than 
just looking at numbers in your table, sparklines can, at a glance, give meaning 
and context to your data. Sparklines show trends, highs, and lows. Because they 
ﬁ t right in your table, you don’t need to go looking for the information. Figure 
15-4 contains a sparklines-enabled table showing manufacturing costs over time. 
Excel’s implementation of sparklines allows pie charts, lines, bar charts, and other 
graphs styles. 
Another key Excel capability is its long-time support for pivot tables, which 
allow you to summarize categories of data.  Pivot tables sort, count, and total the 
data stored in a table, giving you additional information not otherwise available. 
(Apple’s competing iWork Numbers can categorize a table, but that capability is 
not as mature as the pivot table support in Microsoft Excel.)
Excel for Mac 2011 provides access to the Microsoft cloud-based data service, 
which provides online access and collaboration, as well as the cloud-based ﬁ le 
storage. Although cloud-based Excel is still in its infancy, its mere existence is a 
step in the right direction.
Power users can take advantage of the  Visual Basic  macro language, 
which allows them to customize the Ofﬁ ce applications. Talented Visual Basic 
programmers can dramatically improve Excel’s functionality by automating complex 
calculations and spreadsheet formatting. I’ve seen some Visual Basic-driven Excel 
ﬁ les reduce hours of work into a few minutes of automated computing. 

Ironically, Microsoft Excel embraces Mac OS X automation tools better 
than Apple’s iWork does. Some editions of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce ship with built-in 
Automator actions, and Excel has an extensive AppleScript library (Automator 
and AppleScript are covered in Chapter 24). I once witnessed a nerdy CPA use 
a combination of AppleScript and Visual Basic macros to make Mac Excel do 
nothing less than integer ballet.
Microsoft Excel 2011 is a very powerful spreadsheet application with many 
features simply not available in other Mac OS X spreadsheet programs. Although 
it still suffers from the feature glut found in all Microsoft Ofﬁ ce applications, the 
Microsoft Mac team has made notable strides with Mac Excel 2011 toward making 
it a more Mac-like application.
Apple  iWork Numbers
Although one of Excel’s strong points is the years of development and 
weight of features behind it, that is also one of its weaknesses. Excel is anchored 
to decades of feature bloat. For many users, Excel is overkill. Fortunately, Apple 
developed its own spreadsheet application as part of the  iWork suite ($79; www.
apple.com/iwork) called Numbers, shown in Figure 15-5.
Where the focus of Excel is to provide maximum compatibility and nearly all 
the features and formulas from Windows Excel, the focus of iWork Numbers is to 
provide a simple to use alternative for everyone else. This design mandate appears 
in little ways throughout the application. For example, the menu bar is context-
sensitive: If you select a data table, you get data table tools. If you select an image, 
you get image tools.
The ﬁ rst thing you notice when opening a new Numbers spreadsheet is 
that it does not include the familiar Excel cell table grid to inﬁ nity. A Microsoft 
employee once told me, proudly, that every new Excel sheet provides the user 
more than 1 billion cells. The default table size in Numbers provides just 585 
cells. The tables resize to ﬁ t the data set, and no more. 
The tables are also smart. If, for example you make a table and use column 
headings such as Name, Address, and Phone Number and then drag a contact list 
THE OPENOFFICE ALTERNATIVE
If you want the Excel experience without the cost of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, try 
OpenOfﬁ ce (free; www.openoffice.org). OpenOfﬁ ce reads and writes 
the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce formats. Although OpenOfﬁ ce does not have all the bells 
and whistles of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, it has enough to get the job done for many 
users — and it’s free.
www.ebook777.com

onto the table from Apple’s  Address Book application, Numbers automatically 
imports those contacts and ﬁ lls in the appropriate data.
Although Numbers does not support Excel  pivot tables, it has a similar feature, 
called categories. Numbers tables can look for recurring entries in a designated 
column and then sort the entire table around those items. For example, if you have 
a column listing manufacturing costs, with recurring entries of research, materials, 
and labor, Control+clicking or right-clicking the column title and then choosing 
the Categorize by This Column contextual menu option, Numbers sorts and counts 
each entry. You can even categorize by multiple columns.
Because the tables scale to the size of your data, you can put multiple tables 
in a single sheet. If your spreadsheet includes monthly sales ﬁ gures, you can 
place a separate table in the same sheet with ﬁ xed costs, such as mark-up and 
commission rates. 
The tables can share data, and you can then model different options without 
ﬂ ipping through different sheets. Because each table is independent, resizing 
and changing one does not affect the others. If you use multiple sheets in one 
spreadsheet, you can move the tables to different sheets, and Numbers keeps 
track of your formulas.
In addition to placing multiple tables in a sheet, you can place other objects 
outside the table such as text, graphics, objects, and  charts. With very little work, 
you can create a sheet with a corporate logo next to a data table and above an 
attractive chart. The application has automatic layout guides that help you align 
objects on the sheet. The ﬁ nal product is much cleaner on the screen and printed 
page than what Excel produces, as shown in Figure 15-5. 
Entering data is also intuitive. Numbers allows you to change cell formatting 
from the toolbar. To prevent errors in data entry, you can set up sliders (where 
you click and drag a slider to adjust entries), steppers (where you increase or 
decrease a value by a set amount), and pop-up menus (which allow you to 
choose from a group of preset values) to adjust cell contents with mouse clicks. 
Once you format a cell for sliders, steppers, or pop-up menus, the appropriate 
interface appears any time you select that cell. This is especially helpful for 
reference cells. For example, if you want to create a percentage discount 
calculation, you can set up the discount reference as a slider as shown in Figure 
15-6 and then easily adjust the amount. 
Check box cells are also helpful; they provide a Boolean value of 1 (for yes) 
and 0 (for no) for your calculations. If, for example, you have a row that has the 
product price and then a check box for whether a commission is earned, you 
could set up a formula that multiplies the product price times the commission 
rate times the commission check box (which is 1 for checked and 0 for 
unchecked). It would look like: 

(Product value * (Commission Rate * Commission Check Box))
This equation allows you to turn certain portions of your spreadsheet on or 
off with one mouse click.
Apple also made Numbers more accessible by using the standard Mac OS X 
application interface. If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, the  Sheet Navigator, 
shown in Figure 15-7, located on the left side of the screen — just like in iTunes, 
www.ebook777.com

Mail, and several other Apple applications — lists every table, chart, and sheet in 
your spreadsheet for quick access.
Formulas allow spreadsheets to do calculations without a lot of work on 
your part. By applying formulas, you can add and subtract dates or perform 
complex ﬁ nancial and statistical calculations. Numbers does not support as many 
formulas as Excel; Apple ships Numbers with about 250 formulas. If you need to 
run formulas that are unsupported by Numbers, you simply can’t, and you’ll have 
to work instead in Excel. For the formulas it does support, Numbers makes them 
easy to use by explaining each formula, as shown in Figure 15-8, and giving usage 
examples. 
Once you insert a formula into your Numbers spreadsheet, the application 
puts color-coded placeholders in your tables over each variable. You can change 

variables by dragging the placeholder to a different cell. The Formula List view 
displays all your calculations.
A show-stopper for some Excel users is Numbers’ inability to work with 
linked  spreadsheets. Using Excel, you can link to a separate spreadsheet ﬁ le 
and use its data. This feature is useful in business where, for example, different 
departments prepare their own spreadsheets that are later tied together in one 
master spreadsheet.
Numbers sheets look better than Excel sheets. The combination of limited 
sized tables and easy customization of fonts, sizes, colors, styles, and borders 
allow you to quickly make visually attractive spreadsheets. The Mac OS X Media 
Browser is available from Numbers, so you can add pictures from your iPhoto 
library. Numbers also includes alignment guides and rulers for laying out your 
worksheets. You can even use iWork tools, such as Instant Alpha (covered in 
Chapter 13), to remove backgrounds from images. This feature, which was only 
available in expensive graphics applications, is now (remarkably) available in 
Apple’s spreadsheet application.
The Numbers built-in templates are a mix of business and personal 
spreadsheets, all professionally designed. The templates provide a starting point 
that can save you hours of work in making your own custom spreadsheet.
Charts in Numbers are easy to create and customize: You select the data set 
and click on the desired chart format. If you want to add a data set to a chart, 
just highlight the data set and drag it onto the existing chart; Numbers does the 
rest. Although it doesn’t support as many chart types as Excel, Numbers supports 
all the standard chart types — bar, pie, line, and scatter point — in 2D and 3D 
models, as shown in Figure 15-9. You can also combine chart types such as lines 
PIE CHARTS OR BAR CHARTS?
There is a raging battle between  nerdy spreadsheet types as to which is 
better: pie charts or bar charts. The answer is usually bar charts. Although it 
can be easy to show small differences in data with a bar or line chart, it is 
nearly impossible to do so with a pie chart. Pie charts with multiple data sets 
in the same ballpark make each pie slice appear as if they were the same size, 
so the differences are easily missed. That’s much less likely in a bar chart. 
Also, when using 3D pie charts, the angle of the chart can misleadingly skew 
the look of the data; that distortion is less in a 3D bar chart. 
So, whenever you’re making charts, stick with lines and bars and avoid pie 
charts. The big exception is when there is a signiﬁ cant difference in data sets. 
For example, if you want to call out a data set that is only 10 percent of the 
total, using a big pie chart with the tiny 10 percent slice exploded out is an 
effective presentation technique.
www.ebook777.com

and columns. If you use iWork Pages and Keynote, you can link the charts across 
the two programs and have them auto-update.
Although Numbers opens Microsoft Excel ﬁ les and exports to Microsoft 
Excel format, Apple does not put the same priority on Ofﬁ ce compatibility that 
Microsoft does. The fancy layouts, graphics, and titles in a Numbers spreadsheet 
often get mangled in the export to Excel. 
Likewise, some elements of a Numbers spreadsheet get modiﬁ ed during 
export to Excel. For example, Numbers allows you to put multiple tables on a 
single sheet whereas Excel does not. When you export to Excel, each table is 
broken into a separate sheet. Another Numbers feature is footer rows. You can 
create footer rows in Numbers that exist independently of the table data. Because 
Excel does not support footer rows, the export process converts the footer rows 
into a bottom row on your Excel sheet. 
Apple has its own cloud-based collaboration service,  iWork.com, that allows 
you to publish your Numbers sheet to the Web. Other people in your group can 
review and comment on the data or even download their own Numbers or Excel 
versions of the data. Although iWork.com is a good ﬁ rst step for Apple, it is not 
as capable as  Google Spreadsheets or Microsoft’s  Ofﬁ ce Web Apps cloud service. 
The main reason: iWork.com does not host the source ﬁ le but instead merely 

provides a copy of it. iWork.com also does not allow multiple users to modify 
a spreadsheet at the same time. If your co-worker modiﬁ es a spreadsheet from 
iWork.com while you are making changes at the same time on your local copy, 
there is no easy way to reconcile the different versions.
Still, Apple has succeeded in its goal with iWork Numbers to create a 
spreadsheet application that is simple to use and visually appealing. Because I so 
often use spreadsheets in presentations and I want them to be easy to build and 
look great, I ﬁ nd that Apple’s Numbers is the right ﬁ t for me.
Google Spreadsheets
Google has its own spreadsheet application as part of the free  Google Docs 
online applications package (http://docs.google.com). Shown in Figure 
15-10, Google Spreadsheets is all about collaboration. Multiple users can access 
and edit the data, with the changes immediately available to everyone. There is 
no need to e-mail the most recent ﬁ le or synchronize changes, just log in and 
open the ﬁ le. If you are working on a spreadsheet with multiple users in multiple 
locations, it is hard to beat Google Spreadsheets. 
Because it is a cloud-based application, you need an Internet connection for 
Google Spreadsheets to work. There are some workarounds for ofﬂ ine use, but 
they all require extra steps and, by their nature, destroy the biggest reason to use 
the Google Applications: immediate online collaboration. 
www.ebook777.com

The user interface is Web-based and thus rudimentary. However, Google is 
always making improvements and I have no doubt that in the future we’ll look 
back at any productivity application that does not have cloud-based collaboration 
as quaint.
Except for its superior collaboration tools, Google Spreadsheets does 
not stack up well against Excel and Numbers; there are simply too many 
compromises required to make a browser-based spreadsheet application. For 
example, Google Spreadsheets does not include a deep formula set like Excel 
or Numbers and does not include Numbers’ layout and printing tools. The best 
use for Google Spreadsheets is a starting point with team members ultimately 
importing the ﬁ le into Numbers or Excel for the ﬁ nal push.
OmniGraphSketcher
If you make charts as part of your work, another useful Mac application 
is OmniGraphSketcher ($30; www.omnigroup.com/products/
omnigraphsketcher). Despite the recent improvements to Numbers’ and 
Excel’s  charting tools, creating charts and graphs is still often much harder than 
it should be. For example, if you want to call out one data point on your chart 
or selectively ﬁ ll in space in a line chart, it is often not possible to do so without 
additional editing in a graphics application.
OmniGraphSketcher, shown in Figure 15-11, ﬁ lls this void by taking 
graphing out of the spreadsheet. It essentially combines a charting tool with a 
drawing application. You can quickly create accurate graphs with colorful data 
sets and highlights, curves, and shading without requiring an advanced degree in 
mathematics and statistics. 

Using OmniGraphSketcher, you can input your own data set or copy data 
from Numbers or Excel. You can then make your graphs with annotations, 
shapes, arrows, and check marks. OmniGraphSketcher also makes it easy to 
export graphics for text-editing, presentation, and other applications.

Databases
Databases
D
atabase management is the meat and potatoes of workplace computing. 
Using a database, you can track customers, employees, students, projects, 
products, inventory, and anything that ﬁ ts in a list. Databases also 
occupy a unique position among computer technologies: They were some of the 
ﬁ rst applications developed for workplace computers so they’ve been around for a 
long time. And, because nobody wants to lose their data, databases are probably 
the single most upgrade-resistant applications in any workplace. Once a company 
has a working database in place that holds precious company data, it is easier to 
convince management and IT staff to dynamite the building than to change the 
database software. 
As a result, the database applications and computers that run them are 
usually the most antiquated in the ofﬁ ce. They are difﬁ cult to upgrade and 
modify, and they require copious amounts of consultant time and duct tape to 
keep going. Fortunately, there are several modern database applications on the 
Mac. Two of the best are FileMaker Pro and Bento. 
FileMaker Pro
FileMaker Pro (starting at $299; www.filemaker.com) is the premier 
database application on the Mac. Shown in Figure 16-1, FileMaker Pro has long 
roots on the Mac; in fact, its ﬁ rst Mac OS release was on the original Macintosh. 
Although initially developed by another company, Apple has long owned and 
published FileMaker Pro through its old Claris subsidiary or its current FileMaker 
subsidiary. 
FileMaker Pro is a relational database with both Windows and Mac OS X 
versions. Most commercial database applications are built with two pieces: the 
database engine (which does all the sorting and storage) and the user interface 
(which displays the data on computers). FileMaker Pro, as one of the ﬁ rst 
database applications to embrace the graphical user interface, doesn’t split the 
database engine from the user interface. Instead, it keeps them together, making 
it possible for users to drag elements of the interface into new forms and layouts. 
Because of FileMaker Pro’s graphical approach, users can adjust and customize 
www.ebook777.com

their own database. If you want to change your database, you don’t need to call in 
a database guru to perform special incantations. You can change it yourself.
Using FileMaker Pro
FileMaker Pro ships with more than 30 built-in Starter Solutions that offer a 
jumping-off point to customize your database. There are several business-friendly 
Starter Solutions, including expense reporting, customer lists, and inventory 
tracking. Each template is attractive and professionally designed. The Starter 
Solution databases are ready for business without any additional work. For 
example, the invoicing Starter Solution database, shown in Figure 16-2, includes 
customer and inventory databases and combines them with a tax schedule 
to create invoices. You can customize the template, but if you just want to get 
started, everything works out of the box.
If you have an Excel-based spreadsheet “database,” you can drag the Excel ﬁ le 
onto the FileMaker Pro icon; FileMaker autogenerates a database using the Excel 
data. You can then add ﬁ elds and further customize it as needed. This takes much 
of the pain out of transitioning your databases from spreadsheet to FileMaker Pro. 
Whether you start with a template or roll your own database, once you have 
it set up, FileMaker Pro provides several viewing options. The Table view provides 
spreadsheet-like columns for each database ﬁ eld, with records listed as rows 

below the ﬁ eld. This view combines the look of a spreadsheet with the sorting 
capabilities of a database. You can deﬁ ne ﬁ elds and enter data in Table view. You 
can even hide or show ﬁ elds in this view. 
The Table view is the default view when you create a new database, which 
helps with initial organization and record entry. But there are other views: The 
Form view taps into the FileMaker Pro database but uses a custom screen form to 
enter and review data. The Layout Mode view allows you to customize the look 
and feel of your database.
Although FileMaker Pro does not have the computing power of a dedicated 
spreadsheet application, it does include the functions often needed for a 
database. For example, you can total sorted groups of records by record state, 
average, sums, and several other mathematical functions.
You can search all the ﬁ elds in your FileMaker Pro database using the Quick 
Find feature, which provides a search bar that quickly searches all the ﬁ elds in the 
current layout. Quick Find is helpful when you are not sure which ﬁ eld contains 
the data you are looking for, and it’s faster than using an advanced search. 
FileMaker Pro helps you visualize your database with easy chart creation. 
To create a chart, set your database to Layout Mode view and click Charting 
Tools to get the dialog box shown in Figure 16-3. You can then choose a chart 
format and select the data sets you want to chart. It takes just a few minutes; 
www.ebook777.com

when completed, you have an attractive chart that visually displays your data and 
updates as you enter new data.
In addition to the ability to make your own database adjustments, 
graphs, and reports, FileMaker Pro has a plug-in architecture that enables 
you to add features and custom databases. Although you can manage your 
FileMaker Pro database yourself, there is an active community of FileMaker Pro 
developers releasing industry-speciﬁ c and networking plug-ins. Whether you 
are manufacturing buggy whips or running a dental ofﬁ ce, there is probably a 
customized FileMaker plug-in for you. FileMaker developers also contract with 
companies to construct their databases to speciﬁ c requirements.
Sharing data with FileMaker Pro
Once you’ve built your database, you will want to share the data. FileMaker 
Pro has extensive reporting functions that are user-adjustable. You can export it 
to PDF, Excel, or the Web’s HTML format. The Quick Reports feature allows you 
to make detailed reports without entering the sometimes-intimidating Layout 
Mode view. If you want more granular control over reporting, the Layout Report 
Assistant allows you to make custom reports with the data and layout you specify.
FileMaker Pro also includes powerful networking tools. Using its Server 
editions, you can deploy FileMaker Pro in large companies and share data 
throughout the network. You can use FileMaker Pro Server to host your database 
on the Web, allowing remote users to access and modify data from their browsers. 
It can even be set up for customers to ﬁ ll in Web forms and automatically update 
your local FileMaker Pro database. Internally, users can share snapshots of data. A 
snapshot can contain a speciﬁ c view of the data, such as a list of customers with 
orders more than two days old. This allows employees on a network to easily 
share managed lists. 

You can also take your data with you using the  FileMakerGo  iPad application.
There are four versions of FileMaker Pro. The $299 FileMaker Pro 11 is the 
standard FileMaker Pro database software covered in this chapter. The $499 
FileMaker Pro 11 Advanced version includes more advanced design and layout 
tools, such as a custom menu user interface and the ability to cut and paste 
custom functions in your database. Using  FileMaker Pro 11 Advanced, you can 
build a kiosk-style database where users just see the entry form and all menus are 
hidden.
The $999  FileMaker Pro 11 Server lets you connect as many as 250 users and 
gives you server management tools such as the ability to manage the database 
remotely, schedule automatic backups, and automate tasks. You can also share 
your data with the Web. You can create customer feedback forms or surveys for 
customers to ﬁ ll in from the Web. The $2,999  FileMaker Pro 11 Server Advanced 
allows an unlimited number of users and as many as 100 concurrent Web users. It 
also provides more administrative tools appropriate for large installations.
In the years since it ﬁ rst appeared on the original Macintosh, FileMaker 
has matured into a feature-rich database that combines a user-controllable 
architecture with strong plug-in support. Most remarkable, despite its powerful 
database engine (FileMaker Pro can manage data ﬁ les as large as 8TB), the 
interface has maintained its original vision of making it easy to use and modify. 
DATABASES AND SPREADSHEETS
If you have Numbers or Excel on your Mac, you can create a database 
using spreadsheet tables. But the trouble with using a spreadsheet to manage 
data is the lack of tools for data management. 
Although you can keep a  customer list in a Numbers spreadsheet, you 
cannot ﬁ lter the data with the same ﬂ exibility as with a database application. 
For example, what if you want all customers who have moved to Wyoming in 
the last year and have made a purchase in the last nine months? Data sorting 
and ﬁ ltering is where a database earns its keep. Spreadsheets just don’t have 
the ability to keep up. 
Spreadsheets also do not provide the same network sharing and ﬁ ltering 
options that you get with a dedicated database like FileMaker Pro or Bento. 
Spreadsheets also limit your ability to view the data: Spreadsheets only 
provide a table view, whereas a database application allows you to create lists 
and custom forms for displaying your data. 
It is possible to manage databases on a spreadsheet, but data 
management is easier with a dedicated database application. The point is 
that you should use the right tools for the job. Nothing beats a spreadsheet 
for computing data, and nothing beats a database for organizing, sorting, 
and viewing data.

Bento
Small businesses and consultants have database needs, but they often don’t 
need the 8TB capacity and Web-active features that come with FileMaker Pro. For 
them, FileMaker Pro is overkill. Instead they just want a simple database they can 
install and start using. For these users, FileMaker publishes Bento.
Bento ($49; www.filemaker.com/bento), shown in Figure 16-4, is a user-
friendly database that trades some of FileMaker Pro’s power and ﬂ exibility for 
simplicity and ease of use. Despite its limited scope, Bento is useful for getting 
work done.
Creating a database with Bento
Opening Bento for the ﬁ rst time, you will ﬁ nd 35 professionally designed 
database templates. The New Library window, shown in Figure 16-5, includes 
many useful work templates, including inventory, time billing, customers, and 
issue tracking. Each template can be further customized. 
If Bento doesn’t include the template you are looking for, you can visit the 
Bento Template Exchange (shown in Figure 16-6) at  http://solutions.
filemaker.com/database-templates; it lists user and professionally 
designed templates for download. The template exchange includes templates such 

www.ebook777.com

as mail management, sales leads, contact and customer manager, and product 
research libraries. If you create your own specialized template, you can upload it 
to the exchange to share with other users.
If you’d rather start from scratch, open the blank template. Customizing or 
creating a new template is easy in Bento: Click the Form tool in the lower-right 
corner and begin adding ﬁ elds to your form. You can also delete, modify, and 
move ﬁ elds that are already on your form.
Databases in Bento are called libraries. Rather than reloading a different 
database every time you need access, Bento keeps a list of all your libraries in its 
left pane. For example, you can have your customer list library right above your 
supplier and inventory libraries. You can then jump among the libraries with one 
click; you do not need to separately load and close your Bento libraries. As long 
as the application is running, all your libraries are available.
When working with libraries, Bento uses a two-pane window similar to that 
in iTunes. In addition to displaying your libraries, the left pane also displays 
collections, which (following the iTunes metaphor) are record clusters within 
libraries. Building collections inside your Bento libraries allows you to further 
reﬁ ne your database and make it more manageable. You can add a collection 
to a library by Control+clicking or right-clicking on the library to display the 

contextual menu, from which you choose the New Collection option to create 
the collection. For example, if you have an address book library, you can have a 
collection that just includes customers. 
You can add records to the collection by dragging them from the library. 
You can also create “smart” collections that populate with records based on the 
conditions you set (just like Mac OS X, iTunes, and Apple Mail let you create 
smart folders, smart playlists, and smart mailboxes, respectively). 
The right pane in the Bento library window is the Records pane where you 
access and modify the data in your libraries. The records can be displayed in Table 
View, as Figure 16-7 shows, or in Form View, as Figure 16-4 shows. There is also 
the Grid View that displays a thumbnail for each record and the Split View that 
mixes two views (for example, Table View and Grid View) in one window. Bento 
simpliﬁ es database management by tying together your libraries, records, and 
ﬁ elds in one interface.
Data fields
Fields are the basic building blocks of a database. A ﬁ eld is a lot like 
Tupperware: You have different kinds of Tupperware containers for different kinds 
of food. The Tupperware is not the food but simply where you hold the food. 
Fields serve the same function with data: They are not the data you put in the 
database but instead the containers for it. You have different types of data — such 
as  dates, numbers, and names — so Bento has a lot of different ﬁ eld types, as 
shown in the Create a Field dialog box in Figure 16-8. 
In addition to the usual text, dates, and numbers, Bento includes ﬁ elds for 
time, currency, and rating. The Rating ﬁ eld allows you to grade a record with up 
to ﬁ ve stars. On ﬁ rst glance, the Rating ﬁ eld doesn’t seem useful for work, but it 
can be: You can use it to rate sales leads or new product ideas and later sort in 
order of rating. 
You can also create a Media ﬁ eld in Bento to hold images, video, and sounds. 
If you have customers in your iPhoto database, for example, you can display 
them in your Bento database on the customer contact form. There are also several 
Internet ﬁ elds, including URL, Email Address, and IM Account. 
You can use the Checkbox ﬁ eld to create ﬁ lters for items such as a company 
holiday card list. The Simple List ﬁ eld creates a list in your database. The File List 
ﬁ eld allows you to make a list of ﬁ les. You can, for example, keep a list of artwork 
for a customer account in a File List. Double-clicking the ﬁ le name in the File List 
opens the ﬁ le in its associated application. 
Bento also simpliﬁ es data entry with the Choice ﬁ eld that creates a pop-up 
menu limiting data entry to a group of predeﬁ ned options. The Calculation ﬁ eld 
manipulates existing ﬁ elds similar to how a spreadsheet’s formulas work on cells. 
www.ebook777.com

For example, you can use the Calculation ﬁ eld to combine a ﬁ rst and last name 
into a single ﬁ eld or to perform basic math operations.
Once you have created your database and set up the ﬁ elds, you can customize 
the look of the database by dragging the individual ﬁ elds from the ﬁ eld list in 
the lower left pane onto your database layout. It is as simple as that: Click and 
drag. You can add and remove ﬁ elds and add bits of text or graphical elements to 
make your form easier to follow and more attractive. You can also change texture 
and colors of your library using the Theme button in the Form Tools bar at the 
bottom of the screen. 
Making a database in Bento can be a pleasant distraction. Just make sure to 
remember to start ﬁ lling in your data at some point.

Sharing Bento libraries
You can share your Bento libraries with as many as ﬁ ve users on your 
network. Users can then view and modify the data in your library based on the 
permissions you set in the Bento Sharing preferences pane, shown in Figure 16-9. 
(For user sharing to work, each user must have his or her own Bento license.) 
Bento also has versions available for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad that 
allow you to use your database on the go. Using the mobile editions, you can 
view, edit, and add new records to your Bento data remotely. When you sync your 
device back to Bento, it adds any changes to your library.
Enhancing Mac OS X applications
Bento also adds some much needed functionality to Apple’s  Address Book 
and  iCal. If you use these applications, Bento may be worth its cost for these 
features alone.
The Bento Address Book template ties into the Mac OS X’s built-in Address 
Book database. This means the Apple Address Book and Bento share the same 
contact data. If you make a change to a phone number in Address Book (or on 
your iPhone tied to your MobileMe account or synced via iTunes), the next time 
you launch Bento, that changed number is reﬂ ected in your Bento library. It 
works in both directions: If you update an e-mail address in your Bento library, it 
is reﬂ ected in Address Book.
You can customize the data layout in Bento in ways not possible with Address 
Book. Rather than being forced to display your contact entries one record at a 
time, you can display them in a tabular format. You can also add new data ﬁ elds. 
For example, you can place a check box labeled Vendors or Customers in Bento 
and then sort your list using those values. 
Bento is one of those tools that either works spectacularly or fails entirely. 
Bento’s simple interface and low cost makes it perfect for a small business or 
consultant practice. Bento falls down, however, when you need database features 
such as networking with large groups, Web hosting, and the customization tools 
found in FileMaker Pro. 
Whether you want to organize a customer list for your home crafting 
business or manage 8TB of data for a global product release, there is a database 
on the Mac for you.

Project 
Project 
Management
Management
C
hapter 9 is full of great tools to help you manage tasks and projects. 
Managing teams, however, is different: You must manage deadlines, 
collaborative resources, and, most important, time.  Scheduling large 
groups of people can be daunting: Certain  tasks are always contingent on the 
completion of other tasks. A setback in one small part of the project can send 
shock waves down the entire project plan, resulting in delays and more expenses.
Because of the contingent nature of each piece in a project plan, there can be 
a lot of calculation and rejiggering of schedules involved. This is exactly the kind 
of tedium that computers manage. And you’ll ﬁ nd many project management 
tools available for the Mac, in both desktop application and online varieties.
Desktop Project Management
As you dip your toes in the world of Web-based software, there are good 
reasons to keep your project management software on your desktop. Desktop 
applications are usually more secure, because the data is normally located on 
local drives and not available on the Internet. Furthermore, desktop applications 
are built using Apple’s Mac development software, so they usually have 
more features and always look better. Two of my favorite Mac OS X project 
management applications are OmniPlan and FastTrack Schedule.
OmniPlan
OmniPlan ($150; www.omnigroup.com/products/omniplan) comes 
from Omni Group, which is regarded as one of the best Macintosh productivity 
software companies. Indeed, the Omni Group software appears several times in 
this book, including OmniOutliner (see Chapter 10), OmniFocus (see Chapter 
9), and OmniGraphSketcher (see Chapter 15). Its software is known for its 
stability and clean interfaces. 
OmniPlan, shown in Figure 17-1, lives up to the Omni Group’s reputation. 
Project management software is legendary for a steep learning curve, and many 
applications are so complicated that you have no hope of operating them without 
several days of training. This is not the case with OmniPlan.
www.ebook777.com

OmniPlan uses a two-pane view. The left pane includes a list of tasks while 
the right pane lays out a Gantt  chart (see the sidebar “How Henry Gantt Became 
Famous”) showing the start and end dates for each task. The ﬁ rst time you open 
OmniPlan, a new project is already created with the ﬁ rst task entry. 
Adding new tasks in OmniPlan is simply a matter of clicking in the Task 
pane, pressing Enter, and typing in your new tasks. When starting from scratch 
on any large project, it’s a good idea to brainstorm in the Task pane and create 
a long list of all the relevant tasks. Once you have your list of tasks, you can 
sort and reorganize them by clicking and dragging on any task entry. You can 
also group tasks by selecting multiple tasks and clicking the Group iconic 
button in the toolbar or pressing Option+J+L. The objective is to have your 
tasks in chronological order and grouped appropriately. Like OmniFocus and 
HOW HENRY GANTT BECAME FAMOUS
Virtually all self-respecting project management applications include 
a Gantt chart function. So what is a Gantt chart anyway? Around 1910, 
Henry Gantt designed a new type of chart that included a list of tasks to 
be completed with a line representing the start and end date for each task. 
Productivity nerds loved the idea and immediately adopted it. They were so 
thankful that they named the chart after Henry.
Gantt charts really came into their own with the arrival of computers 
with graphical user interfaces (like the Mac). Computers automate the labor-
intensive process of laying out Gantt charts and making adjustments when 
the inevitable delay occurs. 

OmniOutliner, OmniPlan has a note ﬁ eld for each entry where you can enter 
detailed notes concerning any particular task.
Once you have an outline of all the steps in your project, you add a time 
estimate for each task. At this point, you are not worried about when any 
particular task will be completed but instead how long each task will take. You do 
the estimation in the Task pane, under the Effort column or in the Task inspector, 
shown in Figure 17-2. It is easiest to enter the time estimates directly in the 
Task pane. Using the inspector requires several extra clicks for each entry. When 
inserting time estimates, you can use a type of shorthand: 3d for three days, 2w 
for two weeks, and 1w3d for one week and three days, for example. At this stage, 
your project plan should look something like Figure 17-2.
You can also input costs for each task in the Task inspector. Depending on 
your type of business, this could be material costs, labor, or both. Although 
OmniPlan includes support for costs, it is primarily a  scheduling tool. The 
calculation of costs is better done in a spreadsheet like Microsoft Excel or iWork 
Numbers (covered in Chapter 15). Nevertheless, those amounts can be referenced 
in your OmniPlan.
Once you have your list of tasks and an estimate as to how long each task 
will take, OmniPlan needs to know which tasks must wait for the completion of 
other tasks, called dependencies. For example, in Figure 17-3, the group of tasks 
called Sell Lemonade, is dependent on the group of tasks called Build Lemonade 
Stand. In OmniPlan you create dependencies by selecting two tasks and clicking 
www.ebook777.com

the Connection iconic button in the toolbar, by pressing Control+J+=, or by 
dragging an arrow from one task to another. Once you do this, OmniPlan moves 
the second task to begin at the conclusion of the ﬁ rst task and draws a line 
between the two. You can have dependencies between two individual tasks, two 
groups of tasks, or any combination of the two. 
OmniPlan provides several ways to customize the dependencies. You can 
create prioritizations in the dependencies in relation to material supplies. For 
example, you could relate the Make Lemonade group with the acquisition 
of lemons. As you create dependencies, OmniPlan builds a Gantt chart that 
graphically shows each task. OmniPlan will schedule the entire project using your 
estimates and dependencies. Alternatively, you can set the ﬁ nish date and have 
OmniPlan schedule backward, based on your estimates and dependencies. The 
OmniPlan Gantt chart in Figure 17-3 shows an example: If you plan to become 
a captain of industry in the lemonade business and you want to open your stand 
on February 5, you need to start on January 9.
In addition to scheduling tasks, OmniPlan lets you schedule people. You can 
assign individual team members to tasks. OmniPlan tracks each person and their 
assignments in the background and makes certain you don’t have any of your team 
members working on two tasks at the same time. (To assign team members, switch 
to Resource view by choosing View ➧ Resource View or pressing Option+J+2.)
Once in Resource view, the task list in the left pane is replaced with a 
resource list. You can enter your resources the same way you add tasks. Type the 
team member or resource name and press Return. Resource view lets you see a 
convenient list of all your team members and their contributions as shown in 
Figure 17-4.

In addition to project planning, OmniPlan is a good tool for project 
management. Using OmniPlan, you can track the progress of all the tasks in 
your project as it progresses. Project management with OmniPlan enables you to 
anticipate problems ahead of time and schedule time and resources accordingly 
as you move forward.
You can also share your OmniPlan, so multiple team members can access 
the OmniPlan data at once and make changes and adjustments to it. OmniPlan 
tracks the changes and lets the project administrator review and approve (or 
reject) the changes later. OmniPlan also has an  iPad application that can access 
the OmniPlan data. (There is no Windows PC version of OmniPlan, so to modify 
the OmniPlan data, users must have a Mac or an iPad.) OmniPlan can save your 
data ﬁ le to the Internet using a  MobileMe account or  WebDAV server. (WebDAV is 
a protocol that allows you to share ﬁ les using Internet servers.)
OmniPlan also offers several export options to share data. It exports to 
Microsoft Project, iCal, HTML, OmniOutliner, OmniGrafﬂ e, and PDF. Most of 
my staff uses Windows computers, so I regularly export OmniPlan data to PDF to 
share it with them.
FastTrack Schedule
FastTrack Schedule ($350; www.aecsoftware.com/project-
management-software/fasttrack-schedule-mac) is another desktop 
project management tool on the Mac. (The networked ﬁ ve-user version costs 
$3,000.) Shown in Figure 17-5, FastTrack Schedule has both Mac and Windows 
versions.
www.ebook777.com

The workﬂ ow in FastTrack Schedule is similar to that of OmniPlan, covered 
earlier in this chapter: You create a list of tasks, set dependencies, and assign 
resources. FastTrack Schedule includes additional features worth noting. 
One additional feature is FastTrack Schedule’s inclusion of project templates. 
These are a great way to get a head start on planning a new project. The templates 
include varied projects that range from construction management to wedding 
planning. FastTrack Schedule also has an online depository with more project 
templates at www.aecsoftware.com/resources/project-management-
templates.
While in the midst of a project, you sometimes need to change team 
members’  assignments. FastTrack Schedule’s Effort-Driven Scheduling 
automatically adjusts task durations as resources are added (or removed). If, for 
example, you realize a project is behind schedule, you can throw more resources 
at a lagging task in FastTrack Schedule and see how that would impact the 
schedule before committing to it. 
The Assignment Contouring feature, shown in Figure 17-6, analyzes the most 
labor-intensive portions of a task and helps you assign staff when they are needed 
most, based on the contour of the resource requirements. For example, a bell-
contoured task requires more labor in the middle of execution whereas a front-

loaded task requires more staff at the beginning. Using Assignment Contouring 
and FastTrack Schedule, you can predict the particular labor needs of any task.
Despite the fact that it is multiplatform, FastTrack Schedule takes advantage 
of several Mac OS X conventions: It integrates with the built-in Address Book 
and also uses FastTrack Schedule’s own iMedia browser (which keeps images in a 
pop-up window) to apply images to your project plan. Overall, it very much feels 
like a Mac application.
If you are working in a multiplatform ofﬁ ce, FastTrack Schedule is the best 
tool. If you’re a Mac-only ofﬁ ce, take a careful look at both OmniPlan and 
FastTrack Schedule. In my experience, OmniPlan is easier to get up and running 
but lacks some of the features offered by FastTrack Schedule. Both applications 
are well-designed, are stable, and have a free trial period.
WORKING WITH  MICROSOFT PROJECT
The most used project management application in Windows is Microsoft 
Project. Many large companies have employees whose sole job is managing 
Microsoft Project data ﬁ les. If your ofﬁ ce lives and breathes by Microsoft 
Project, you have several options on the Mac.
Both OmniPlan and FastTrack Schedule can import and export their data 
ﬁ les to Microsoft Project with varying degrees of success — the conversion 
process can cause loss of data, and speciﬁ c features in Microsoft Project do 
not always translate. 
For general project management, exporting to Microsoft Project should do 
the trick. However, if you ﬁ nd the exported ﬁ les do not have all the required 
information, the best solution is to run Microsoft Project on your Mac. 
Although there is no Mac OS X version of Microsoft Project, you can run the 
Windows version using desktop virtualization software (covered in Chapter 
22). Microsoft Project is not resource-intensive and thus can run just ﬁ ne in a 
virtual environment on a modern Macintosh.

Web Tools
In addition to desktop tools, there is a growing crop of Web-based project 
management software. Web-based project management applications share their 
data in a centralized database available to all team members given access. Because 
they are browser-based, these tools eliminate all compatibility problems across 
different computing platforms.
Web-based project management software is still in its infancy and generally 
does not have the exhaustive feature sets available in applications such as 
OmniPlan and FastTrack Schedule. However, what they lack in features, they 
make up in collaboration. Two of my favorite Web-based project management 
applications are 37signals’ Basecamp and Tom’s Planner.
Basecamp
Basecamp (starting at $24 per month; www.basecamphq.com), shown in 
Figure 17-7, seeks to provide one centralized location for all elements of project 
management.
The Web service includes modules to share communications between teams. 
Instead of tracking multiple e-mail chains, Basecamp has a centralized message 
board where all team members can share information. Basecamp also can prepare 
and mail a daily digest of all communications to team members.
Basecamp provides a depository for  documents. Team members can upload to 
it Microsoft Ofﬁ ce documents (including Word, Excel, and PowerPoint), Photoshop 
documents, movies, Zip ﬁ les, and PDFs. Everyone with access to the Basecamp 
project can download and review the shared documents. It also includes version 
tracking so if a team member modiﬁ es a document and uploads it back to the 
Basecamp project, both versions are available to team members.
Basecamp has scheduling modules to track project deadlines and milestones. 
Like more traditional project management applications, you can track each task 
related to a project and who is responsible for getting it done. 
Basecamp also includes several features not found in traditional Gantt chart-
style project managers, such as tracking team members’ time. This feature, which 
is normally associated with ﬁ nancial management software (covered in Chapter 
18), is an interesting addition to project management software. It is, however, 
only available in the higher-tier Basecamp pricing plans (those starting at $50 per 
month).
Basecamp also includes other innovative features such as writeboards, which 
allows members to collaboratively write text documents, and Campﬁ re, which is a 
useful group chat tool that works within Basecamp projects.

What makes Basecamp so interesting are its innovative features and fresh 
take on project management. There is nothing else like it. When combined with 
37signals’  Highrise Web-based contact management service (www.highrisehq.
com), it provides a powerful management tool for small to medium companies.
 Tom’s Planner
Tom’s Planner (www.tomsplanner.com) is a no-nonsense Web-based 
Gantt  chart project management tool. It is free if you just have one project. You 
www.ebook777.com

can have up to 20 projects for $9 a month, and an unlimited number of projects 
for $19 a month. 
Shown in Figure 17-8, Tom’s Planner lacks much of the sophistication and 
polish of OmniPlan and FastTrack Schedule. Nonetheless, it is absurdly easy 
to use. Furthermore, as a Web-based application, you can access it from any 
computer.
As Figure 17-8 shows, Tom’s Planner tracks project task, resources, and status 
all in one view. You simply Control+click or right-click on a task item to make 
adjustments to the task list. You can change or add new tasks, and adjust the 
timing and dependencies of speciﬁ c tasks by dragging and dropping the task on 
the Gantt chart. Tom’s Planner is very intuitive: If you have no interest in learning 
the more sophisticated tools available in OmniPlan or FastTrack Schedule, spend 
ﬁ ve minutes with Tom’s Planner and you may ﬁ nd that it has all the project 
planning tools you need.
Whether you are planning a new Web site or managing a multimillion-dollar 
construction project, the project management tools on the Mac are up to the task.

Billing and 
Billing and 
Invoicing
Invoicing
U
sing the applications in this book, you are doing some great work on 
your Mac. So how about getting paid? That’s where billing and invoicing 
software comes in, to track your product (whatever that may be) and 
who pays for it. There are several Mac products to do so, including  accounting 
packages, which manage all the ﬁ nancial aspects of your business, to more focused 
packages that track just your time. This chapter looks at some of the best billing and 
invoicing options and answers the question of what to do if you are working in an 
ofﬁ ce that requires QuickBooks for Windows. 
QuickBooks
QuickBooks, published by Intuit Software, is the default billing and invoicing 
software package for most small and medium companies. Just like most graphics 
designers learn their trade on a Mac, most bookkeepers and CPAs learn the ropes 
using QuickBooks on a Windows PC.
QuickBooks for Mac ($200; http://quickbooks.intuit.com/
product/accounting-software/mac-accounting-software) is 
Intuit’s Mac-friendly version of QuickBooks. QuickBooks has an erratic history 
on the Mac. For the longest time, QuickBooks on the Mac felt like a poor quality 
port of prior releases of QuickBooks for Windows. Most Mac ofﬁ ces that relied 
on QuickBooks kept around one Windows PC for no other reason but to run 
QuickBooks. Indeed, some Mac ofﬁ ces still do this.
More recently, Intuit tried to close the gap between the Mac and Windows 
versions with QuickBooks 2009 for Mac. With this release, Intuit scrapped the 
prior code and started over. QuickBooks was rewritten for the Mac — and the 
results bear that out: The application was suddenly more Mac-like. However, 
although Intuit deﬁ nitely gave the application a new coat of paint in QuickBooks 
2009, the software remained a clunker under the hood: Several features that are 
staples on the Windows version (multiple users, credit card processing, and cross-
platform data ﬁ les, and online bill pay) were left out. 
The current iteration, QuickBooks 2011 (shown in Figure 18-1), improves 
on these deﬁ ciencies, but not enough. The new version does provide for

in-application credit card processing and multiple users but several features, as 
covered later in this chapter, are still missing.
QuickBooks 2011 for Mac eases new account setup with a streamlined 
process that lets you start a new ﬁ le in minutes. Intuit also added improved 
support for new users with Guide Me, a virtual helper that walks you through 
how to set up and maintain your books. Guide Me will be a big help with the 
initial learning curve for new users.
QuickBooks lets you track inventory,  expenses, and income. Using its tools, 
you can issue payroll checks and client invoices. It is intended to be a complete 
business accounting tool, and so has more than 100 customizable reports to 
analyze your data. The application speeds up monthly reporting by remembering 
your favorite report formats. Intuit also added a time-tracking module to 
QuickBooks, called My Time, where you can bill time directly to projects and 
clients. For  MobileMe subscribers, QuickBooks can automatically back up your 
data ﬁ le to the MobileMe cloud storage service. 
Although QuickBooks for Mac is better than it used to be, it falls down with 
its continuing inability to match features in the Windows version. QuickBooks 
for Mac 2011 still does not allow online bill-pay, or have a ﬁ le format compatible 
with the Windows version.

Because nearly all bookkeepers and CPAs speak QuickBooks and nearly 
all are using Windows computers, it is important that the QuickBooks for Mac 
data ﬁ le is readable by  QuickBooks on Windows. You need to be able to share 
your ﬁ les and send a copy of your data to your CPA for review. Unfortunately, 
QuickBooks for Mac doesn’t use the same data ﬁ le type as QuickBooks for 
Windows, but instead offers a very convoluted ﬁ le-sharing process: You have to 
click the Windows Backup toolbar icon in QuickBooks for Mac and export your 
.mac.qbb Mac ﬁ le as a .qbb Windows ﬁ le. You can then import the .qbb 
ﬁ le on a Windows PC to work with QuickBooks for Windows. When ﬁ nished 
working on Windows, you have to then save the ﬁ le for QuickBooks for Mac 
(.mac.qbb) and then, back on your Mac, restore the ﬁ le. There are multiple 
steps (and opportunities for data corruption) involved. 
The best reason to use QuickBooks is its near-universal adoption in the 
Windows world but Intuit still hasn’t released a Mac version that easily works 
with its Windows cousin. It’s bafﬂ ing.
An interesting development is Intuit’s recent release of  QuickBooks Online 
Edition (www.quickbooksonline.intuit.com). This is a hosted version of 
QuickBooks accessed through your browser for a monthly fee, starting at $10 per 
month. Although the online edition does not have as many features as a locally 
installed version of QuickBooks, it does solve the disparity between Windows 
and Mac versions. Plus, your offsite accountant can access the data. QuickBooks 
Online Edition is shown in Figure 18-2.
www.ebook777.com

QuickBooks Online works with both Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari 
(both are covered in Chapter 4). QuickBooks Online data can also be accessed 
with  iOS (iPhone,  iPad, and iPod Touch), BlackBerry, and Android smartphone 
operating systems. Although the idea of keeping a company’s ﬁ nancial records 
with an online service may leave some managers running for the hills, most 
people’s banking information is already online in one form or another, so putting 
ﬁ nancial management online is not as much of a stretch as it may ﬁ rst seem.
Still, most businesses will insist on using locally installed software. For them, 
until Intuit improves QuickBooks for Mac, the software is not worth the trouble. 
Go elsewhere: If you do not need QuickBooks for Windows compatibility, there are 
better tools available on Mac OS X (as covered in this chapter). If you are working 
with QuickBooks to share data with Windows users, you are better off installing a 
Windows virtual machine on your Mac (covered in Chapter 22) and just running 
QuickBooks for Windows on your Mac or using the QuickBooks Online service. 
AccountEdge 
Acclivity (formerly called MYOB) is an accounting software company 
with several products for Mac OS X. Acclivity  AccountEdge ($299; www.
accountedge.com/mac) is Acclivity’s ﬂ agship product, business accounting 
software built from the ground up for the Mac. Where QuickBooks has suffered 
from years of Intuit’s changing priorities on the Mac, AccountEdge has steadily 
improved to provide solid business accounting for the Mac.
AccountEdge, shown in Figure 18-3, manages the ﬁ nancial aspects of a small 
to medium business with tools to manage employee wages, pay bills, create 
invoices, and track inventory. 
Like QuickBooks, AccountEdge tries to help with the initial learning curve. 
The New Company File Assistant lets you choose from 100 editable business 
GETTING HELP WITH ACCOUNTING
Whether you use AccountEdge or QuickBooks, simply buying a license 
and installing the software usually is not enough. Although QuickBooks and 
AccountEdge do a valiant job of explaining accounting principles with their 
tutorials, there is no accounting software package that can automatically 
bestow on you the underlying principles required to properly use it. That’s 
why, no matter which accounting package you use on your Mac, it is 
important you have an understanding of how accounting works. 
Just as important, you need to work with your accounting professional 
to do the initial software setup. Getting off on the right foot makes all the 
difference. If you enter the data wrong, your accounting fees to sort it all out 
will eclipse any license fees for the software.

templates. Alternatively, you can start your accounting ﬁ le from scratch. 
AccountEdge also has an Accounting 101 Guide to help with setup.
AccountEdge handles all ﬁ nancial aspects of your business. You can create 
sales quotes and invoices using its built-in forms or customize your own. 
The application supports print and e-mail forms, so you can electronically 
communicate with your customers. In addition to taking orders, AccountEdge 
tracks your accounts payable. It can track taxes, discounts, and returns. 
AccountEdge lets you make electronic vendor payments and even create the 
necessary federal tax forms. The inventory tools are also impressive: You can track 
inventory in multiple locations, check shipments against purchases, and keep 
digital reference photos.
The time-billing component is customizable with multiple billing rates and 
can track chargeable and non-chargeable time. There are also several time-billing 
reports that let you track productivity. You can enter time manually or use the 
built-in timer. The employee payroll tools include withholdings, allowances, 
and bonuses. Employee wages can be calculated by set hours or time sheets. 
AccountEdge also interfaces with outside payroll services.
AccountEdge includes more than 200 reports that show key ﬁ nancial 
indicators for your business, including proﬁ t margins, inventory, and receivables. 
The reports’ formatting looks better than the comparable reports in QuickBooks.
The security features go beyond a simple login password. The trouble with 
having login-based security in business accounting software is that employees who 
get any access get all the access to the data. To prevent that, AccountEdge lets you 
set security within the application. For example, an employee can have access to 
www.ebook777.com

inventory data but no access to personal data about employees. AccountEdge also 
tracks all changes so you can see who made what changes and when.
AccountEdge has a network version ($300; www.accountedge.com/mac/
networkedition) that supports as many as 15 simultaneous users (its client 
licenses cost $150 each or ﬁ ve for $500). Acclivity also has a Windows edition 
($300; www.accountedge.com/windows). If your accountant doesn’t use 
AccountEdge, Acclivity will send him or her a free copy.
AccountEdge also embraces AppleScript automation. (AppleScript is 
covered in Chapter 24.) Even if you are not an AppleScript guru, AppleScript 
automation support can still beneﬁ t you because third-party software developers 
use AppleScript code to link applications. For example, Marketcircle (makers 
of Daylite, covered in Chapter 6) publish  AccountEdge Connect ($99; www.
marketcircle.com/daylite/addons/accountedgeconnector.html) 
that connects AccountEdge data to  Daylite.
Acclivity also publishes  FirstEdge ($100; www.firstedgeapp.com/
firstedge), which includes AccountEdge’s quotes, invoices, and expenses 
modules. It does not, however, handle payroll, inventory, and time-billing.
Acclivity gets the Mac in a way that Intuit has yet to demonstrate. It has 
steadily developed an accounting package for the Mac that, for most small to 
medium companies, just works.
PERSONAL FINANCE
You can also manage your personal ﬁ nances on the Mac. Quicken, 
published by Intuit, has a Mac version, Quicken Essentials for Mac ($50; 
quicken.intuit.com/personal-finance-software/mac-
personal-financial-software.jsp), but again the Mac version’s 
features trail behind the Windows version.
One of the better personal ﬁ nance applications is iBank ($60; www.
iggsoftware.com/ibank), which connects directly with your bank 
and does its best to automatically categorize your transactions. iBank also 
includes the best reporting and investment tracking tools of all the Mac 
personal ﬁ nancing software applications.
One of the most interesting developments in personal ﬁ nancial 
management is the rise of the Web-based money manager Mint (www.
mint.com). Mint interfaces with your ﬁ nancial institutions, so you can 
manage your expenses and income from any computer with Web access. 
Mint was so successful that Intuit bought it. The security concerns of online 
ﬁ nancial management aside, Mint’s success indicates people are ready 
to move their ﬁ nancial management to the Web. In the end, Web-based 
ﬁ nancial management may put an end once and for all to the disparity 
between Intuit’s Mac and Windows-based software.

Billings
QuickBooks and AccountEdge are the kitchen-sink class of ﬁ nancial software. 
They track everything you need for your business including costs, time, customers, 
and invoices. Marketcircle’s  Billings ($40; www.marketcircle.com/billings) 
does not boast the full accounting features of QuickBooks and AccountEdge but 
instead is limited to  time billings often used by accountants, attorneys, artists, and 
other professionals. If time is your stock in trade, Billings may be all you need.
Billings, shown in Figure 18-4, is a well-designed Mac OS X application that 
borrows the iTunes interface paradigm, with projects and accounts in the left 
pane and data in the right pane. 
Billings interfaces with the Apple Address Book (covered in Chapter 6) to 
manage your clients; Billings creates an Address Book group containing all your 
clients. Using Address Book for client contacts lets you use  MobileMe syncing 
with an  iPhone,  iPad, or iPod Touch or with another Mac; you can also use 
Address Book’s Google and Yahoo sync tools to automatically synchronize your 
contacts with other devices (see Chapter 6). 
There are several ways to track your time in Billings. You can track time from 
inside the application or use a menu bar timer, which makes it easy to run a clock 
while you are working in other applications. The timer continues to run even 
when Billings is closed. Additionally, you can manually enter time in the editor, 
www.ebook777.com

as shown in Figure 18-5. There is also an iOS application that lets you enter time 
on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.

Billings includes several professionally designed invoice templates and 
includes an editor so you can modify the included template, shown in Figure 
18-6, or create your own. Once your invoice format is done, you can generate 
client invoices by choosing Client ➧ Send Invoice. Billings supports multiple 
currencies, which can be set on a per-client basis, so American clients receive their 
bills in dollars while European clients will receive invoices in euros, for example.
Billings, which has more than 30 built-in reports to analyze your accounts, 
also lets you track payments. The entire experience is user-friendly and intuitive. 
For example, if you want to quickly ﬁ nd all clients with past-due accounts, their 
names appear in red in the left sidebar.
Daylite (covered in Chapter 6) is published by the same developer. As a result, 
Billings and Daylite feature tight integration. Working together, you can send 
existing Daylite events, such as calendar appointments, to Billings as billing events.
Billings Pro ($200; www.marketcircle.com/billingspro) is an 
enhanced version of Billings. Shown in Figure 18-7, Billings Pro allows multiple 
users to access the data at the same time. Billings Pro also includes a Web 
interface from which timekeepers can enter time and expenses from their Web 
browsers (including Windows and mobile browsers).

The Paperless 
The Paperless 
Mac
Mac
P
eople have been talking about “going paperless” and transferring all their 
records to digital form for years, but this ideal has been largely unavailable 
to anyone except large corporations until recently. Fortunately, paperless 
technology is ﬁ nally here for small and medium businesses. This chapter covers 
how to get your records into digital form and to use available Mac tools to sort 
and organize them.
Getting  Paper Records on Your Mac
Transferring existing records to a digital format requires that they be scanned 
into the computer. For large corporations, there are commercial scanners and 
copiers that can process thousands of documents at a time. These devices are too 
costly for small and medium businesses. Likewise, digital conversion is not a job for 
a your traditional ﬂ atbed scanner: The scanners on your multifunction printer or 
ﬂ atbed scanner are slow and usually require that you manually feed each page (or 
limit you to maybe a dozen or so pages at a time). If the page is double-sided, you 
have to scan it twice. Although ﬂ atbed scanners are great for getting high-resolution 
scans of photographs, when scanning multipage documents, they are unworkable.
Instead, you need a dedicated document scanner. Just not the expensive types 
that large companies use. Some of the best paper digitizers on the Mac platform 
for small and medium businesses are the Fujitsu ScanSnap scanners.
The Fujitsu  ScanSnap S1500M ($500; http://scansnap.fujitsu.
com), shown in Figure 19-1, is Fujitsu’s premier desktop scanner. The S1500M 
document scanner holds up to 50 pages and scans at a rate of 20 pages per 
minute. The unit has two scanners, so it can simultaneously scan both the front 
and back pages of a document as its pages are fed through the scanner. The result: 
The ScanSnap ﬂ ies through scanning projects. (There is also a networked version, 
the ScanSnap ﬁ -6010N, which costs $2,500.)
The S1300 ($280) mobile scanner is the portable ScanSnap model. At 3.1 
pounds and 11 × 3 × 4 inches, it can ﬁ t in a medium-size briefcase. It can run off 
AC power or a powered USB port. Like the S1500M, the S1300 also includes front 
and back scanners. The S1300 can scan up to 10 pages per minute.
www.ebook777.com

Fujitsu has embraced the Mac community with custom software for 
Mac OS X. Just as important as the ScanSnap hardware, is the software, 
included with both the S1500M and the S1300. The ScanSnap software is fully 
customizable but defaults to save scans to the near-universal  PDF format (see 
Chapter 12). The scanner software has built-in logic to align the paper correctly. 
Thus, if you scan a page sideways, the ScanSnap software recognizes the text 
direction is wrong and rotates the page image automatically. The software also 
includes automatic size detection, which allows it to distinguish between a 
business card and a letter easily. 
With years of experience, Fujitsu has made a lot of progress with common 
problems associated with scanning lots of documents. For example, sometimes the 
sheet feeder grabs more than one page at a time, but the ScanSnap has a sensor that 
checks for this problem. And often, extra-long documents cause scanners to seize; 
again, the ScanSnap handles long pages (including grocery receipts). 
One challenge of going paperless is making the text of the scanned 
documents searchable using optical character recognition ( OCR; covered later 
in this chapter and in Chapter 12). The ScanSnap software checks your scanned 
documents for highlighted text (green highlighters work best) and then selectively 
performs OCR on just the highlighted portions. For example, you can highlight 
the words “Smith Sales Report” on a document. After you scan the report with 
your ScanSnap, the software sees those highlighted words, performs optical 
character recognition on them, and adds the words “Smith Sales Report” to the 
ﬁ le’s  Spotlight index. You can then ﬁ nd the document by searching for those 
words using Mac OS X’s  Spotlight utility (covered in Chapter 1).

The Fujitsu scanning software lets you save multiple scanning proﬁ les, so 
you can have one setup for getting fast low-resolution scans of black-and-white 
records to PDF and slower high-resolution scans of color pictures to JPEG format. 
You can also set a custom destination for your scanned documents. I save mine 
to a folder on my Dropbox account (covered in Chapter 21) so I can sort and 
organize them from any computer with Dropbox access.
Both the S1300 and S1500M include additional software, including Abbyy 
FineReader (www.abbyy.com), which performs optical character recognition 
on your scans and converts them into Microsoft Word and Excel documents. 
The scanners also ship with  Cardiris, which scans business cards and saves them 
directly into the Mac OS X  Address Book. The S1500M also ships with Adobe 
Acrobat Professional for Mac, version 8. Although this is one version behind the 
current Acrobat Pro, it originally sold for $500.
If your ofﬁ ce has more unscanned documents than you can handle, there 
are services that will do bulk scanning. This can be helpful for getting your 
paperless systems started. However, when choosing a vendor to scan documents, 
make certain it is trustworthy. Depending on your industry, there may be privacy 
concerns that prohibit this option.
Once your physical documents are scanned, what do you do with them? 
Some industries require that original documents be retained. In that event, look 
for an offsite storage service. There are many companies that will pick up boxes 
of documents and store them for a fee. If there isn’t a good reason to retain 
documents, shred or discard them. After all, the point of this exercise is to get that 
paper out of your life.
Saving Electronic Records
Once you commit to a paperless system, you are also going to generate 
electronic documents you want to ﬁ le. You can’t simply save your Pages, Excel, 
and Keynote documents in their native formats to your paperless archive. A 
paperless  archive needs to be viewable on any system, regardless of what software 
is installed on those systems; thus you need to store your documents in a 
universal format. Also, saving your archived documents as application ﬁ les lets 
later users open and modify the ﬁ les (if they have compatible editing software), 
which is bad for version control and records management. 
The answer is to save the ﬁ les in an uneditable but widely readable format, of 
which there are several options. 
 ◗
TIFF, the Tagged Image File Format, uses different compression types to 
minimize the file size of scanned documents. Not all TIFF decoders work 
the same way: Some do a better job at compression than others. Because 
www.ebook777.com

there are different decoding algorithms, occasionally you will come across 
TIFF files that will not open in Mac OS X  Preview, Adobe  Reader, or other 
viewer. Although TIFF was often used for scanned documents several 
years ago, its popularity has ebbed.
 ◗
JPEG, the Joint Photographic Expert Group format, is a compressed 
image type most often used for Web and digital photographs. Most 
cameras automatically compress photos to JPEG. JPEG does a great job of 
reducing file sizes but it can throw away detail and quality in the process, 
making it generally inappropriate for archiving diagrams and documents.
 ◗
PNG, the Portable Network Graphics, format is a newer Web graphics 
standard. PNG is useful for graphics but not suitable for scanned 
documents. It has several features not available to JPEG, including the use 
of an alpha channel (transparency) background. Thus, graphics created 
in the PNG format can have their backgrounds removed (as Chapter 
13 explains), which is useful when using graphics in documents and 
presentations. 
 ◗
PDF, the Portable Document Format, is the clear winner for a paperless 
system file format. PDF is ubiquitous. Free software exists on all the 
major computing platforms to view and annotate PDF files. Mac OS X’s 
Preview application has PDF tools built in, and you can easily create 
PDFs from any file that can be printed (see Chapter 12). 
Organizing Scanned Documents
Once you commit to saving and scanning documents, you need to decide 
where they go. An electronic document depository has a few speciﬁ c needs:
1. 
1. Accessibility. The  documents need to be in a centralized location 
where everyone that needs access has access. For a small consultancy, this 
could be on a single iMac with file sharing turned on (see Chapter 20). 
In a larger office, it makes more sense to store paperless documents on 
a central server (also covered in Chapter 20). If you are part of a virtual 
office with team members all over the country, you are better off using 
an online service such as  Dropbox or  Box.net (covered in Chapter 21). 
2. 
2. Privacy and security. The  document organization needs to reflect any 
security requirements. Health records, for example, have very specific 
legal requirements for keeping their information private. But a scanned 
copy of the menu for that rib joint everyone is considering for the next 
office party has no such security concerns. The amount of privacy and 
security depends on your specific industry but must be considered when 
deciding where to keep your paperless files.

3. 
3. Automated   backup. A paperless system needs multiple backups, with 
at least one automated system for daily backups. To do this, you could use 
any of the backup plans covered in Chapter 2. One advantage of going 
paperless is the relative ease of creating copies of the files; it is much easier 
to make copies of electronic documents than physical ones. In 1994, I had 
a work project that included 32 banker’s boxes full of documents. It cost 
nearly $4,000 to make copies for everyone involved. Today, I could make 
those same copies for the $30 price of a spindle of blank recordable DVDs.
Having decided where to store documents, you need to devote time deciding 
how you will organize the documents. Investing time upfront ﬁ guring out the 
document organization will save you multiples of that time later.
Speciﬁ cally, you need to settle on a naming convention and hierarchical ﬁ le 
structure. There are a couple ways to go about this. One popular approach is the 
use of nested folders,  technically called a  hierarchical ﬁ le structure. This is how I do 
it. I have a master folder called Client Folder on my Mac that contains separate 
folders for each client. Each client folder has separate folders for each of that 
client’s business dealings. Figure 19-2 illustrates this organization.
Because the folder names indicate the type of documents stored (letters 
are, for example, located in the Correspondence folder), I use the ﬁ lenames to 
provide the date and detail. The format I use is the date, in the format yyyy-mm-dd 
www.ebook777.com

followed by a brief description. For example, I might call a ﬁ le 2010-12-18 
Letter to Lynn re Meeting.pdf. (I automate the date entry with my 
TextExpander date-stamp macro, covered in Chapter 3.)
Although the ﬁ le is   date-stamped by Mac OS X, the date for a scanned ﬁ le is the 
date the scan occurred, not when the original ﬁ le was created, so putting the date in 
the ﬁ lename assures an accurate date for scanned ﬁ les. It also helps if I need to copy 
documents to another disk, which can change the copies’ date stamp to the date 
of the copying. Also, naming ﬁ les in this way makes it very easy to ﬁ nd documents 
and gives you the ability to quickly sort documents in chronological order. This 
system makes it easy for others to use and understand your ﬁ le system. 
You can further automate this process using Hazel, covered in Chapter 3. For 
example, you could create a rule in Hazel that any scanned ﬁ le named Smith-
Ltr gets a date stamp added by Hazel to the front of the ﬁ lename and saved to 
the Clients/Smith Co/Correspondence folder.
Another way to save paperless documents is to just assign it an  index stamp 
(usually a series of letters and numbers) and then use a separate application 
like Bento or FileMaker (both covered in Chapter 16) to create a detailed index 
for each document. Using a  database application gives you more ﬂ exibility to 
organize your documents. For example, you could create a search that includes 
just letters to Smith and Jones between January and March. Provided you set 
OCR AND STORED DOCUMENTS
Optical character recognition, the technology that enables your Mac to 
read and index the words on your scanned documents (covered in Chapter 
12), lets you search all your documents. PDF documents with embedded text 
(which is added as part of the OCR process) are indexed by the Mac OS X 
Spotlight service (covered in Chapter 1). Thus, if you set up a scanning 
process that OCRs documents as they are scanned, you can later search them.
One advantage of the Fujitsu ScanSnap software is that it can 
automatically OCR every document it scans. There are other ways to perform 
OCR, however.  PDFpen and Adobe Acrobat Pro (covered in Chapter 12) 
both perform automatic OCR on PDF documents. The paid Evernote service 
(covered in Chapter 10) also recognizes text in scanned and saved PDF (and 
JPEG) ﬁ les. There are also independent software tools; one of the best is 
Abbyy  FineReader ($100; www.abbyy.com).
Despite the increasing ease of performing OCR on a ﬁ le, I still do not OCR 
every document in my paperless system. The OCR process takes time, and 
many of my scanned documents are meant only as a historical archive, so the 
time investment to OCR them isn’t worthwhile. Think about your paperless 
system and what documents are worth the trouble of OCR before devoting 
time to the process.

up clickable links from the database to your ﬁ le storage system, you can then 
immediately get access to the documents.
Although not as prevalent on the Mac, there are several  document 
management systems available in Windows. In my experience, these systems are 
expensive and cumbersome. Moreover, I am always leery of these closed systems 
because of the inability to get the documents back out later. What if, in two 
years, you want to get access to your documents but your license to the $800 
management software has expired? If you must have a document management 
system, roll your own in FileMaker Pro. 
Still, there are consumer-focused document organization applications for 
Mac OS X that can be used for business.
Yep ($39; www.ironicsoftware.com/yep), shown in Figure 19-3, 
presents an interface that is, essentially, iTunes for documents. The Sidebar is a list 
of your keywords letting you selectively ﬁ lter your documents, which appear in 
the right pane. The documents can be kept in their original location and format, 
so you have a clean set of hierarchal folders in addition to the Yep tools. If you 
are willing to commit the additional time to tag your ﬁ les, Yep is a good tool for 
viewing and indexing your documents.
EagleFiler ($40; http://c-command.com/eaglefiler) is another tool 
to consider. You can import PDF (and several other formats, including e-mail) 
www.ebook777.com

into EagleFiler and set up  smart folders and smart folder actions. One advantage 
of EagleFiler is that it lets you save a separate library for every project so you can 
easily separate your data.
DevonThink Professional Ofﬁ ce ($150; www.devon-technologies.com), 
shown in Figure 19-4, is a popular document manager for the Mac. The software 
interfaces directly with the Fujitsu ScanSnap to import PDF documents as you scan 
them. DevonThink uses artiﬁ cial intelligence to assist you in ﬁ ling documents, 
reading the document and suggesting where to ﬁ le it. In addition to reading 
PDF ﬁ les, DevonThink can also store and organize e-mails, Word documents, 
multimedia ﬁ les, and other ﬁ le types. DevonThink includes sharing tools so you 
can post documents to the Web or share them with co-workers on a local network.
A ﬁ nal possibility for paperless document management is to use one of 
the “everything bucket” applications for Mac OS X such as  Evernote (covered in 
Chapter 10) or  Yojimbo ($40; www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo). 
Yojimbo is designed to capture all those bits and pieces of data on your Mac that 
you don’t know where to keep. It can include snippets of text, e-mails, images, 
and PDF ﬁ les. For a modest PDF paperless system (a few thousand documents), 
Yojimbo provides impressive indexing and organizational tools. You can tag your 
documents and selectively encrypt secure documents in it.

There is no one right tool for managing your paperless documents. I’ve tried 
most of them but keep gravitating back toward a simple hierarchical ﬁ le structure. 
It is easy to maintain using automation tools and the data is extremely portable.
Faxing on a Mac
Once you have your paperless system in place, what about faxes? Fax 
machines are so 1990s. Still, Mac OS X includes built-in fax support, accessed 
in the Print & Fax system preference. In it, you can conﬁ gure a modem attached 
to your Mac and use it to send and receive faxes. Although this is ﬁ ne for the 
occasional fax, the built-in tools are not suitable for daily business use. 
My favorite Mac  faxing application is PageSender ($40; www.
smilesoftware.com/pagesender). PageSender, shown in Figure 19-5, 
provides drag-and-drop simplicity to faxing from your Mac.  PageSender works with 
just about any modem you can use with your Mac, including internal, Bluetooth, 
USB, serial, and PC Card modems. It includes spam ﬁ ltering and multiple styles of 
cover pages (you can also design your cover page in the application).
The faxing tools (such as retry counts, redial interval, and electronic delivery 
of fax conﬁ rmation) are easy to conﬁ gure. PageSender also supports  AppleScript 
(covered in Chapter 24) and can be scripted to send faxes using  FileMaker 
Pro lists. PageSender, developed by the same company that publishes PDFpen 
(covered in Chapter 12), works well with  PDFpen. For example, you can sign a 
document in PDFpen and send it (via PageSender) directly from PDFpen.
Using modern document scanners and Mac OS X software, small companies 
(and individuals) can easily take the plunge and go paperless.

Networking
Networking
A 
A 
computer network includes at least two computers communicating with 
each other. Although modern computers are fast and powerful, they are 
even more useful when they can work with other computers. In addition 
to allowing communication between computers, a computer network allows Macs 
to share ﬁ les, hardware, and software. 
There are two basic types of  networks: server networks and peer networks. 
Server-based  networks have a central computer serving the ﬁ les and data to the 
attached client computers. On peer-based  networks, each computer holds its 
own ﬁ les and shares them directly with the other computers on the network. The 
server and peer-based networks are illustrated in Figure 20-1.
With the emergence of standard protocols used in both Windows and 
Mac OS X, networking is easier than ever. The largest computer network is the 
Internet, which is covered in Chapter 4. This chapter focuses on local networks 
of computers attached to your Mac, on your wireless network, and on remote 
networking that allows you to access your work network from a distance.
The Mac Server Network
The best tool for creating a Mac server network is using Apple’s  Mac OS X 
Server software ($499, www.apple.com/server/macosx). The most recent 
edition, Snow Leopard Server, is a 64-bit operating system with advanced ﬁ le-
sharing tools such as the ability to read from and write to multiple clients 
simultaneously and virtual local area networks (VLANs) that allow different 
departments in different locations to appear to be on the same network. Mac 
OS X Server also includes security controls that allow network administrators to 
set speciﬁ c access for each user as well as global security settings on the network. 
Mac OS X Server makes it possible to efﬁ ciently share, control, and manage ﬁ les.
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard Server provides useful services for network 
users. iCal Server manages calendars for network users and allows users to see 
co-workers’ schedules and set up meetings when everyone is available. It supports 
push notiﬁ cation that immediately notify team members when a meeting is set. 
www.ebook777.com

The  Address Book Server keeps a master list of names and addresses that can 
be shared with each computer. Users can add, modify, and delete contacts for the 
entire network.
For group projects, Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server includes  Wiki Server; a 
wiki is a Web site that provides the ability for the group to easily review, modify, 
and collaborate on data. Users can create links between different data sets and 

collaborate on large projects. A wiki is best used with groups of people adding 
bits and pieces of data to a larger whole. (The most popular wiki is  Wikipedia.)
Mac OS X Server’s Wiki Server brings this power to your local network: You 
can create a locally hosted internal wiki shared by everyone on the network where 
they can collaborate on information and ideas for a speciﬁ c project. Participants 
can upload ﬁ les and images, add comments, and access the wiki pages from 
their iPhones and iPads. Tapping into other Mac OS X Server tools, the wiki can 
include mailing lists and its own calendar.
Mac OS X Server also includes  Mail Services. Using this tool, small ofﬁ ces can 
create their own e-mail server on the local network server. Mail Services include 
tools for junk mail ﬁ ltering, virus detection and quarantine, and setting up 
vacation messages. Administrators can also create server-based rules to scan and 
ﬁ lter  e-mail messages before they are delivered to users. 
For companies where in-person collaboration is not always possible, Mac 
OS X Server includes  iChat Server to permit secure conﬁ dential iChat sessions 
and persistent chat rooms. Using iChat Server, you can keep track of ongoing 
projects even when you are away from your Mac. Every time you log in, all 
communications from the chat that occurred while you were logged off is loaded 
for review.
Finally, Mac OS X Server simpliﬁ es ﬁ le management. Keeping all your key 
ﬁ les on a central server makes a lot of sense, even in small ofﬁ ces. Mac OS X 
Server’s ﬁ le sharing works with Macs and Windows computers. File access and 
security can be set for each user. Network administrators can control access to 
data and make certain everything is backed up (Mac OS X Server includes support 
for  Time Machine backup). Mac OS X Server also includes tools for ﬁ le-level 
locking that keep Mac or PC clients from overwriting changes when more than 
one user has a ﬁ le open at the same time.
The best hardware options for running Mac OS X Server are Apple’s dedicated 
server products (see Chapter 1):  the Mac Pro, the  Mac Mini, and the recently 
discontinued Xserve. The Mac Pro, starting at $2,499, provides the most power. A 
Mac Mini bundled with Mac OS X Server ($999) provides a simple server solution 
for ofﬁ ces that don’t require the additional computing power offered by the Mac 
Pro. Before buying a server, talk to a networking consultant.
File Sharing
Mac OS X makes it easy to share ﬁ les, even if you don’t use Mac OS X Server. 
If you just need to host and serve ﬁ les, you could set up a dedicated Mac using 
the standard Mac OS X; such a server could beneﬁ t from using a  RAID 1 or 
Drobo external drive (see Chapter 2) to handle the volume of ﬁ les. You can also 
www.ebook777.com

have each Mac act as a ﬁ le server to the other computers on your network. Or 
you can have both: a dedicated ﬁ le server (Mac OS X Server or just Mac OS X) 
for common ﬁ les, plus individual Macs set up for ﬁ le sharing so individuals can 
share their own ﬁ les.
Sharing files from a Mac
For basic  ﬁ le sharing, you do not need a dedicated server. Every Mac has the 
ability to share ﬁ les directly with other computers, including PCs, on a network.
To permit sharing on your Mac, open the  Sharing system preference, shown 
in Figure 20-2. If the Lock iconic button (located in the lower-left corner) displays 
as a closed padlock icon, you can’t make changes to the preferences until you 
unlock the Sharing system preference by clicking the Lock iconic button and 
entering your system password; the button then displays as an open padlock icon. 
The ﬁ rst step is to select the File Sharing option from the list on the left side 
of the Sharing system preference. Then designate folders to share by clicking the 
+ iconic button below the Shared Folders list. This presents a dialog box where 
you can navigate to the folder you want to share. Repeat this step for each folder 
you want to share. If you want to share folders with Windows computers, click the 
Options button and select the Share Files and Folders Using  SMB check box; then 
click Done.
Once you’ve chosen which folders to share, you need to identify which 
users get access, then specify what access they get. To add users, click the + 
iconic button below the Users list. You can add individuals or groups from your 
network. Conversely, you could limit access by removing users; select them one at 

a time and click the – (minus) iconic button. Once you have added and removed 
speciﬁ c users and groups, you set the access  privileges for each using the following 
options, which are available in a pop-up menu adjacent to each user or group 
name (select Everyone to apply privileges to all users on the network):
 ◗
Read Only: This is the default setting. Other users can read or copy 
files from the shared folder but cannot write to the folder or modify files 
inside it.
 ◗
Read & Write: This allows other users to read, copy, edit, and delete the 
contents of the folder.
 ◗
Write Only (Drop Box): This option allows users to drop files in the 
folder. Users cannot view the contents of the folder or pull files back out. 
The Drop box is useful if you want to collect different files from team 
members in a central location. (The  Drop box feature should not be 
confused with the Dropbox synchronization service covered in Chapter 21.)
 ◗
No Access: This option, available only for groups and Everyone, allows 
you to prohibit access to certain folders. Note that if the permissions 
separately set for an individual user in this group allows access to the 
selected folder, that user will still have access even though the group he or 
she is in is set to prohibit access.
Once you’re done, other users on the network (including Windows users) can 
access your shared folders consistent with the permissions you set. 
Sharing  Files from a Windows PC
Your Mac can also access ﬁ les stored on a Windows PC. Just like on your Mac, 
the Windows PC needs to enable sharing. The steps involved to enable sharing on 
a Windows PC depend on which version of Windows you are running.
In Windows XP, choose Start ➧ My Network Places. Then click Set Up a Home 
or Small Ofﬁ ce Network in the left column. Windows XP presents the Network 
Setup Wizard, which allows you to set up ﬁ le sharing and printing. Once enabled, 
the Shared Documents folder is available for sharing. You can add additional 
folders by right-clicking the folders and adjusting their sharing properties. 
In Windows 7, you set ﬁ le sharing in the Network and Sharing Center in the 
Control Panel. Select Choose Homegroup and Sharing. Then select the Change 
Advanced Sharing Settings option and enable File and Printer Sharing. You can 
then designate a folder for sharing by right-clicking the folder in the Windows 
Explorer and choosing Share. 
The Mac OS X Finder is always on the lookout for shared folders, including 
shared Windows folders. So, once you share a Windows folder, it should appear 
in your Finder’s sidebar. 
www.ebook777.com

Online file sharing
Another way to share your ﬁ les is through the use of Internet-based ﬁ le 
storage. Services such as MobileMe, Dropbox, and Box.net allow you to keep 
ﬁ les on Internet-based servers. These cloud services seek to take the place of a 
traditional server: You can designate shared folders on your cloud-based storage, 
so co-workers can upload and download shared ﬁ les (see Chapter 21 for the 
details).
Sharing external media
Before computer communication protocols existed, computer networking 
was accomplished with a box of ﬂ oppy disks and your feet. We called it 
“ sneakernet.” Although technology has moved on, using portable media still 
serves in a pinch. USB ﬂ ash drives ﬁ t on your key ring and can hold gigabytes of 
data. Likewise, portable hard drives with large capacities are sometimes the best 
way to move gigabytes of data between Macs. In short, the sneakernet still lives.
Using portable media is easy when you are moving data between two Macs 
or two Windows PCs. When you move data between Macs and Windows PCs, 
however, things can go a bit sideways if you’re using hard drives. The trouble 
is that Mac OS X and Windows use different ﬁ le systems. Mac OS X uses  HFS 
Extended formatting, referred to in Mac OS X as Mac OS Extended (Journaled). 
Every version of Windows since Windows NT uses the New Technology File 
System ( NTFS) format. Unfortunately, these formats don’t get along as well as 
we’d like them to. Mac OS X can read NTFS but not write to it. You are out of luck 
getting Mac data on a Windows computer because Windows can’t read from or 
write to the HFS Extended format. Table 20-1 summarizes the disk formats and 
their platforms support. 
(If you’re using  ﬂ ash drives, don’t worry: Mac OS X and Windows use the 
same format for these devices —  FAT32 — so there’s no problem sharing data 
across the two platforms.)
There are applications to help out. If you want to read an HFS drive on a 
Windows PC, you need MacDrive 8 ($50; www.mediafour.com/products/
macdrive), which gives Windows the ability to read and write to HFS Extended 

drives. On the Mac side,  NTFS for Mac OS X ($40; www.paragon-software.
com/home/ntfs-mac) allows Macs to read from and write to NTFS.
Another solution is to skip NTFS and HFS Extended altogether and format 
your portable drives with the older FAT32 format. Both Mac OS X and Windows 
can read and write  FAT32. But there are some limitations: It is slower than both 
HFS Extended and NTFS, and you can’t store ﬁ les larger than 4GB. Nevertheless, 
FAT32 is an excellent choice for transferring ﬁ les between operating systems. To 
format a disk in FAT32 in Mac OS X, erase and reformat the drive (using the Mac 
OS X Disk Utility) in the MS-DOS (FAT) format. 
Sharing Printers
Sharing a  printer in Mac OS X is painless. To make your printer available to 
other computers, go to the  Print & Fax system preference shown in Figure 20-3. 
Select the printer you want to share from the list of available printers and click 
Share This Printer on the Network. Next go to the Sharing system preference and 
click Printer Sharing in the list on the left to display its options. You can adjust 
user access just as you set user access for ﬁ le sharing (covered earlier in this 
chapter). Computers on your network can then use the printer connected to your 
Mac. If you use a Mac as your central ﬁ le server, you can also make it a print server 
by attaching printers and turning on sharing. This is illustrated in Figure 20-3.
Remote Access
Another way to network computers is through  remote access, which allows 
you to log in to a local computer network, such as at your ofﬁ ce, through an 
www.ebook777.com

Internet connection. Depending on the network type, you can then download 
ﬁ les from the remote network or take control of a remote computer and make its 
screen appear on your Mac. 
Remote access is one of the best tools for a Mac worker connecting 
to a Windows PC network. It allows you to put a Windows PC, and all its 
accompanying software, on your Mac without loading Windows on your Mac. 
There are several ways to pull this off in Mac OS X.
Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection
Microsoft’s Remote Desktop Connection (free; www.microsoft.com/
mac/products/remote-desktop) is one of the best tools for remote access 
into a Windows network. Remote Desktop Connection uses standard Windows 
authentication and allows you to log into Windows computers. You provide 
Remote Desktop Connection with the  Internet Protocol  (IP) address of the 
computer you are connecting to, and Remote Desktop Connection does the rest 
of the work for you. 
To use Remote Desktop Connection, you need to enable your ofﬁ ce Windows 
PC to receive and authorize the connection. This may require some network 
settings (such as assigning an IP address and adjusting the ﬁ rewall settings) but 
is not difﬁ cult with the assistance of your network administrator. Also, when you 
log in, the remote computer must be turned on.
Once Microsoft Remote Desktop connects, you are asked to enter your user 
name and password as if you were sitting in front of your Windows PC. After you 
log in, your ofﬁ ce computer appears in a window on your Mac. You can use the 
Start menu and run your software as if you were in your ofﬁ ce. As long as you 
have a broadband Internet connection, your remotely connected computer will 
respond at an acceptable speed. You can write documents, create spreadsheets, 
and even e-mail yourself missing ﬁ les. If you don’t want to tangle with Windows 
virtualization on your Mac (covered in Chapter 22) but are saddled with a 
Windows PC at work that you sometimes must run, Remote Desktop Connection 
may be all you need.
CoRD
The open source (free but donation requested)  CoRD (http://cord.
sourceforge.net)is another Remote Desktop client that works similarly to 
Microsoft Remote Desktop Client. It supports multiple logins for different PCs 
(Microsoft Remote Desktop supports only one) and makes it easier to change 
settings than Microsoft Remote Desktop. CoRD has a slide-out drawer on the 
left side of its window that keeps a list of all your logins and allows you to log in 
using hot keys, which is convenient. 

I prefer CoRD over Microsoft Remote Desktop, but they both get the job 
done. If your network administrator is already nervous about you using a Mac, 
use the Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection (IT people are more comfortable 
with Microsoft tools); otherwise, give CoRD a try.
VNC applications
Where Microsoft Remote Desktop Connection and CoRD allow you to 
remotely log into a Windows PC, an alternative technology, called  virtual network 
computing (VNC), lets you share the screen of another computer. This is not the 
same as a remote login covered earlier but often can obtain the same result. There 
are two pieces to VNC, the  server and the  client. The VNC server allows other 
computers to log into it and the client allows a remote computer to access and 
control a computer with a VNC server enabled. VNC server software is built into 
Mac OS X and can be turned on with the Computer Settings button in the Remote 
Management pane in the  Sharing system preference, shown in Figure 20-4.
There are two VNC client applications on the Mac worth noting: 
 ◗
Chicken of the VNC (free; http://sourceforge.net/projects/
cotvnc) is an open source tool that has been popular for years. Chicken 
of the VNC can automatically discover available servers on your network 
and work in full-screen mode. This application is a simple VNC client 
without many bells and whistles but with an uncanny ability to establish 
a VNC connection where other VNC clients cannot.
 ◗
RealVNC ($50; www.realvnc.com) is a commercial VNC tool. If you 
use VNC in a large corporate network, you are more likely to be successful 
www.ebook777.com

convincing the IT staff to let you use RealVNC rather than Chicken of 
the VNC. RealVNC includes several security features including 2,048-bit 
server authentication and 128-bit encryption. RealVNC is multiplatform, 
supporting Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. To operate it on Mac OS X, 
however, you need to purchase the $50 Enterprise edition.
Apple Remote Desktop
For controlling multiple Macs on a single network, use  Apple Remote 
Desktop (www.apple.com/remotedesktop), which allows you to access and 
control multiple Macs. You can manage 10 systems for $299 or an unlimited 
number of systems for $499.
Apple Remote Desktop goes beyond mere remote access to provide 
administrator tools for software distribution, automation, and remote search. It 
is ideal for a network of managed Macs. You can install applications and even 
restart machines remotely. Apple Remote Desktop can be automated, allowing 
the administrator to quickly apply settings to all computers on the network.
Moreover, Apple Remote Desktop has a “curtained” mode where system 
maintenance and updates can be applied in the background without local users 
seeing the administrator do so. If you need to report on computer activity, 
Remote Desktop compiles application usage and hardware reports with more 
than 200 attributes about networked Mac OS X systems. 

Back to My Mac
Back to My Mac is a part of the  MobileMe service, covered in detail in 
Chapter 21. It allows you to easily create a virtual connection between Macs 
registered to your MobileMe account. Although Apple markets it as a consumer 
service, it is also useful for work. If you have an iMac at the ofﬁ ce and a MacBook 
for home, you can remotely control your ofﬁ ce iMac and access ﬁ les over the 
Internet using Back to My Mac. You enable Back to My Mac in the MobileMe 
system preference shown in Figure 20-5. Additionally, you need to enable  Screen 
Sharing and File Sharing on your remote Mac in its  Sharing system preference.
Once enabled, your other Mac should appear in your Finder’s sidebar. 
Clicking on the remote Mac’s name in the Finder sidebar connects you to the 
remote Mac, allowing you to access ﬁ les and, if  Screen Sharing is enabled in the 
remote Mac’s Sharing system preference, share screens with the remote Mac.
We’ve come a long way since sneakernet. Using the products covered in this 
chapter, you should have no trouble networking your Mac to get work done.

H
aving more than one computer is great. It gives you the ﬂ exibility of 
having a nice big screen on your desk and the ability to escape to the 
coffee shop with a laptop. The trouble occurs when you get seated with 
your venti triple-shot mocha latte and realize that the spreadsheet you need is on 
your ofﬁ ce computer and not on your laptop. Your computers are out of sync, 
and you are unable to work. 
Syncing used to be a real pain in the neck involving color-coded ﬂ oppy disks 
and lots of praying. But it’s much easier now with local and Internet-based tools.
Local Syncing
ChronoSync ($40; www.econtechnologies.com) was covered in Chapter 
2 as a backup tool. However, ChronoSync really shines as a synchronization 
tool. Using ChronoSync, shown in Figure 21-1, you can synchronize ﬁ les among 
multiple computers.
ChronoSync can share any ﬁ les your Mac sees. If you have PC ﬁ les or servers 
networked to your Mac (see Chapter 20), you can synchronize the ﬁ les to your 
Mac. For example, if your ofﬁ ce’s Windows server holds your project documents, 
you can mount that server on your Mac and ChronoSync will synchronize those 
ﬁ les to your Mac’s internal hard disk. That loads your Mac with all the ﬁ les 
you need for your next trip to the coffee shop. When you return, you can run 
ChronoSync again, syncing your changed ﬁ les back to the network drive. 
Even if you use more complicated syncing and ﬁ le-management tools, 
ChronoSync is great for helping things along. For example, if you have a mission-
critical project that requires lots of work and you cannot lose any data, you can 
create a ChronoSync template that saves that project folder to a thumb drive or 
even to the cloud-based synchronization tools covered later in this chapter.
Internet Synchronization Tools
With the advantage of high-speed Internet connections and cheap storage, 
several companies now offer ﬁ le synchronization among multiple computers 
Synchronization
Synchronization
www.ebook777.com

using Internet-based (or cloud  storage) synchronization services. This industry is 
in its infancy but is already proving useful to Mac workers. Three of the best tools 
are MobileMe, Dropbox, and Box.net.
MobileMe
MobileMe ($100 per year; www.apple.com/mobileme) is Apple’s tool for 
online synchronization. MobileMe synchronizes many of the user settings on 
your Mac and is conﬁ gured in the Sync pane of the MobileMe system preference, 
shown in Figure 21-2.
MobileMe synchronizes  calendars and  contacts, as explained in Chapter 
6. It also synchronizes e-mail account settings and rules. Synchronizing  e-mail 
settings is handy when working with multiple Macs. For example, if you have 
to change your e-mail server settings on one computer, most likely you need 
that change on all your computers. Using MobileMe, you only need to make 
the adjustment once. The MobileMe server keeps copies of your e-mail account 
settings and automatically updates the other devices. If you create custom rules 
and mailboxes, covered in Chapter 5, MobileMe also keeps those in sync.
Apple did not stop with just e-mail, contacts, and calendars, however. The 
MobileMe synchronization service also synchronizes your Safari bookmarks, 
keychains, Dock items, dashboard widgets, and system preferences. If you 

fully embrace the MobileMe synchronization settings, you can have identical 
preferences on all your Macs.
Apple also opened MobileMe synchronization to third-party application 
developers, so other applications can tap into MobileMe to sync data and settings. 
For example,  TextExpander, covered in Chapter 3, allows you to synchronize your 
text snippets database through the MobileMe service. Once you add a snippet on 
any Mac, MobileMe synchronizes it to your other Macs.
In the MobileMe system preference, shown in Figure 21-2, you can set the 
frequency of your MobileMe synchronization to a speciﬁ c interval (like once 
every hour), manually on your command, or automatically whenever there is a 
change. I ﬁ nd automatic syncing is best: It helps prevent the same record being 
independently modiﬁ ed on two Macs before syncing, which can cause syncing 
conﬂ icts.
Sometimes ﬁ les become corrupt and MobileMe gets confused. When this 
happens, the MobileMe service gives you a warning message explaining that 
two versions of some bit of data (an Address Book entry, for example) are 
inconsistent. You are then prompted to choose which version is correct, and the 
MobileMe service then does its best to sort things out.
Sometimes, these simple measures are not enough and you need to reset the 
MobileMe database. Do so in the  MobileMe system preference as follows:
1. 
1. Click the Advanced button, as shown in Figure 21-2.
2. 
2. Once in the Advanced settings sheet, click the Reset Sync 
Data button to reset your database. The best strategy for resetting 
the database is to have one Mac with the correct version of the data. I’ll 
www.ebook777.com

call that the Correct Mac. You can then instruct MobileMe to replace all 
the data in the MobileMe database with the data from the Correct Mac. 
3. 
3. Once the master reset is completed, use the replaced 
MobileMe data to reset your other Macs again using the Reset 
Sync Data button. But this time, have the MobileMe database replace 
the data on your other Macs. 
The MobileMe service also ties directly into the Apple   iLife applications. If 
you have a MobileMe account, it is easy to share your photographs from iPhoto, 
your Web sites from iWeb, and your movies from iMovie directly to the Web. 
There are no settings to ﬁ ddle with or Internet protocols to master; you just click 
and share. 
Apple also offers a Web interface for MobileMe, shown in Figure 21-3. You can 
log into your account from any computer (including Windows PCs) and have full 
access to your MobileMe calendar, contacts, and e-mail. You can also use the Web 
interface to send large ﬁ les stored on your iDisk, as covered later in this chapter.
The MobileMe synchronization service ties all this data together with your 
Apple mobile devices such as  iPhone,  iPad, and iPod Touch. You can wirelessly 
share and synchronize your contacts, calendar, e-mail settings, and Safari 
bookmarks. Using the MobileMe service, you can remain connected no matter 
where you go. (Chapter 7 covers MobileMe’s integration with Apple’s mobile 
devices in greater detail.)

With your MobileMe subscription, you also receive a 20GB allotment 
of space on the MobileMe servers, called iDisk, that can be split between ﬁ le 
storage and mail storage. For the ﬁ le  storage, you can designate folders as public 
and make them available for friends, family, and co-workers to access; they can 
download ﬁ les from your public folder and upload their ﬁ les for you.
MobileMe also helps to tackle the problem of large e-mail attachments. 
Everyone has a war story about the time you sent a large proposal to a client or 
boss to ﬁ nd out the e-mail was not delivered because the attachment was too 
large, causing a missed deadline and leading to nothing but further misery and 
grief. Using MobileMe, you can store large ﬁ les on your iDisk and then send them 
to clients and bosses with an e-mail that includes a download link to your  iDisk 
ﬁ le, as shown in Figure 21-4. You can even assign a password to keep the ﬁ le 
secure. The recipient then clicks the link in his or her e-mail client to have the ﬁ le 
downloaded. (This works for both PCs and Macs.) You can also place a time limit 
on the download link so it expires for time-sensitive ﬁ les.
As with the rest of MobileMe, you can access your iDisk ﬁ les from the Web 
interface. Before giving an important presentation, I often upload copies of the 
essential documents and Keynote ﬁ les to my iDisk. If my computer does not work 
or the hard drive fails or there is some other last-minute problem, I can always 
get the ﬁ les from another computer and keep marching forward. Apple has also 
released  iPhone and  iPad applications for iDisk that allow you to access the ﬁ les 
from your mobile device and forward e-mail links to friends and colleagues.
The MobileMe settings allow you to keep a local copy of your MobileMe 
iDisk ﬁ les on your Mac. This creates a second copy of your MobileMe data, one 
on your hard disk and the second on the MobileMe server. If you have your 
MobileMe account linked to an additional Mac and also have it set to keep local 
copies of your MobileMe data, you have a third copy. The MobileMe servers keep 
the computers synchronized. The next time you spend a few hours at the coffee 
shop working on your Pages sales proposal and then sync it to the MobileMe 
servers before closing the lid and heading to the ofﬁ ce, your iMac at the ofﬁ ce will 
download the most recent version while you drive back, and you will be able to 
continue where you left off. 
MobileMe is a fantastic service for syncing Macs and does a great job with 
small data ﬁ les, such as your address book, calendar, and individual documents. 
However, when synchronizing larger ﬁ les, the MobileMe servers are simply too 
slow to keep up. If that sales proposal you worked on in the coffee shop includes 
video and music, you have to wait for it to ﬁ nish syncing to the MobileMe server 
before closing your MacBook. Depending on the size of the ﬁ le, that wait could 
be a long time. Although Apple does not control all the variables involved with 
www.ebook777.com

synchronizing data over the Internet (such as Internet speed, wireless network 
speed, and trafﬁ c), the bottleneck very often is the MobileMe service. 
The Achilles heel of MobileMe is its lack of speed. As Apple releases even 
more mobile devices and becomes the hub of our digital lifestyle, I suspect it will 
address this problem in the future.
Despite my concerns with the MobileMe service’s ability to quickly 
synchronize ﬁ les, it is valuable to anyone who operates multiple Macs. The ability 
to sync so many elements of your computing experience among devices, plus 
the support for wireless synchronization of contact and calendar data with your 
iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, make the service worthwhile for many users in 
spite of its network speed issues. 
Apple offers a 60-day free trial, so I recommend you give it a try and make 
your own decision. If you are looking for it only as a ﬁ le-synchronization service, 
however, move on to a faster service such as Dropbox or Box.net.
Dropbox
Dropbox (www.dropbox.com) is the reigning champ of online ﬁ le syncing 
services for the Mac. When you sign up for the service, it creates a local Dropbox 
folder on your Mac. On the free service, you can then load that folder with up to 
2GB of data, which is copied to the Dropbox servers. (You can get more storage 

capacity if you pay for it: 50GB costs $10 per month and 100GB costs $20 per 
month.) When the upload completes, your ﬁ les are in both your local Dropbox 
folder and the cloud-based Dropbox servers.
Working on the ﬁ les is done from the local copies on your Mac. For example, 
if you are syncing a text ﬁ le, you open the ﬁ le from your local Dropbox folder. 
When you are ﬁ nished working on the ﬁ le and save it, the Dropbox application 
automatically syncs the updated version to the Dropbox cloud storage. In this 
sense, Dropbox gives you a backup in addition to syncing service. (For more 
about backup, see Chapter 2.) 
If you have two computers, they can both synchronize to the Dropbox server. 
Dropbox creates a local Dropbox on your second computer just like on the ﬁ rst 
one. All the data is synced both locally and in the cloud, so you can share data 
and ﬁ les between the computers. When you update a text ﬁ le on one Mac, it gets 
synced to both the Dropbox server and to your other Mac (as soon as it connects 
to the Internet, of course). 
The service also handles connectivity problems like a champ: If you lose 
your Internet connection in the middle of syncing, Dropbox resumes syncing 
the next time you connect in a way that protects the ﬁ le integrity. In the years 
that I’ve been using Dropbox, I have never experienced data corruption despite 
lost Internet connections and my complete disregard for in-progress syncing 
operations when closing the lid of my laptop.
Although there are several competing services that do essentially the same 
thing as Dropbox, what makes Dropbox so popular among Mac users is its speed 
and reliability. Dropbox is incredibly fast. So fast that you can modify a ﬁ le on 
your laptop and, in the time it takes for you to push your chair to your iMac, the 
LIMITING THE DROPBOX SYNC
When using  Dropbox, there is no way to limit the synchronization: It’s 
everything or nothing. Although this normally is not a problem, it can be 
an issue if you have mixed personal and work data in your Dropbox ﬁ les. By 
synchronizing with your ofﬁ ce PC or Mac, you’re making your personal data 
available to anyone who has access to that computer. Although Dropbox has 
promised it will add tools to limit the sync, it has not yet done so. 
But there is a workaround: Run multiple Dropbox accounts. Keep your 
primary account on your Mac. Then add an additional free 2GB Dropbox 
account on the work computer under a different e-mail address and share a 
folder from the paid Dropbox account with the new account on the ofﬁ ce 
PC. Just put ﬁ les you want to share with the ofﬁ ce computer in that shared 
folder. You can then control access of what gets synchronized and at the 
same time keep personal ﬁ les off the work computer.

ﬁ le is already synchronized. Dropbox accomplishes this speed by syncing only 
those parts of a ﬁ le that have changed. 
Your ﬁ les stored on the Dropbox server are encrypted and inaccessible 
without your account password. All the data transmissions are done over an SSL-
encrypted channel, which keeps your data safe from prying eyes.
The Dropbox service is not limited to Mac users. There are also clients for 
Windows and Linux, enabling you to easily share ﬁ les between a work PC and 
your Mac laptop. Dropbox has also embraced the mobile operating systems with 
native applications for the  iPhone,  iPad,  BlackBerry, and  Android devices. 
The iPad and iPhone applications are particularly good: They keep an index 
of all ﬁ les in your Dropbox server and allow you to star any ﬁ le as a favorite 
and keep it downloaded locally to your iPad or iPhone so you have access to it 
regardless of your Internet connection. Dropbox also allow you to easily e-mail 
and forward ﬁ les from your Dropbox storage via an e-mail link; During lunch, 
I can send a contract to a colleague that is stored on my Dropbox by just pressing 
a few buttons on the Dropbox app on my iPhone.
If you are away from your computer, you can still access all your Dropbox 
ﬁ les by logging into the Dropbox Web site, shown in Figure 21-5 with your user 
name and password. Once logged in, you can search your entire Dropbox for 
ﬁ les, recover previous versions, undelete ﬁ les, and create shared folders.
In addition to synchronizing, Dropbox is a great resource for  sharing ﬁ les. You 
can designate any folder in your Dropbox storage as a shared folder by creating a 
shared folder in the Dropbox Web interface. Dropbox then sends out invitations to 
the e-mail recipients you identify. Once they accept and install Dropbox on their 
computers, they will have the shared folder available on their computers. 
A shared Dropbox folder allows you to get around the e-mail attachment 
size limitations that often plague telecommuters. Although you cannot place 
large attachments to your e-mail ﬁ les, you can place large ﬁ les in the Dropbox 
shared folder and send an e-mail to your colleagues informing them it has been 
loaded. But one note of caution when using a Dropbox shared ﬁ le: Everyone in 
the shared group has administrative access to that folder and so can copy, modify, 
and delete the ﬁ les.
Some businesses use a Dropbox account to replace their ﬁ le  server. They keep 
all their shared ﬁ les on the Dropbox server where employees can access them from 
any location. A better tool for this, however, is Box.net, covered in the next section.
Another advantage of Dropbox is  ﬁ le versioning. The service keeps versions 
of your ﬁ les for 30 days (or for an unlimited period with a paid account). This 
ability to fetch prior versions of ﬁ les is similar to the Time Machine feature 
explained in Chapter 2. To obtain an earlier version of a document, log into the 

Dropbox Web interface and choose the desired version for download, as shown 
in Figure 21-6.
In addition to syncing your ﬁ les, Dropbox is useful for syncing system and 
application ﬁ les. For example, both 1Password (covered in Chapter 23) and 
TextExpander (covered in Chapter 3) allow you to sync your application database 
over Dropbox, which makes using these applications on multiple computers 
much easier. In the case of  TextExpander, it is better to sync your data with 
Dropbox than with MobileMe because of Dropbox’s speed advantages.
Box.net
Box.net (www.box.net) is another popular online collaboration tool similar 
to Dropbox. It allows you to securely upload and store your   online ﬁ les and 
folders using 256-bit encryption. Box.net, shown in Figure 21-7, is speciﬁ cally 
aimed at businesses. Box.net offers a free 2GB account, as well as a 15GB account 
for $15 per month. For larger businesses, Box.net offers additional usage-based 
pricing tiers.
Box.net allows you to manage your ﬁ les easily. You can create nested folders 
or even host your entire company ﬁ le database on the Box.net server. You can then 
selectively set permissions for different users, such as edit, read only, or exclude 
www.ebook777.com


from certain ﬁ les. Using a business account, you can search the text in your Box.net 
ﬁ les and access them from mobile devices such as an  iPhone or  iPad.
Once your ﬁ les are located on the Box.net server, you can take advantage of 
several  collaboration tools useful for business. Box.net supports discussion and 
commenting threads on documents and keeps version histories. You can also 
set up tasks around speciﬁ c ﬁ les that all team members can review and update. 
Because Box.net tracks each team member who accesses its ﬁ les, it can also send 
e-mail notiﬁ cations when changes are made or there is other activity in the Box.
net account.
Box.net is marketed as a Web-based  server replacement, which is pretty 
remarkable. It includes server administrative tools so you can manage user 
settings and permissions, manage ﬁ le security, and get reports including an audit 
trail of all activity on any ﬁ le in your Box.net storage. You can also customize the 
Box.net interface for your company account to reﬂ ect your company brand.
We’ve come along way since synchronizing was accomplished with ﬂ oppy 
disks and sneakers. Although Web-based syncing is an emerging technology, it 
holds much promise to make the seamless sharing of data among computers 
even easier.

I
n 2006, Apple switched the Macintosh platform to  Intel processors, which are 
the same processors used on most Windows PCs. Overnight, Macs and PCs got 
a lot more alike. Apple CEO Steve Jobs had not left the stage from making this 
announcement before people began speculating about how to run Windows on 
their new Intel Macs.
It didn’t take long. Today there are several ways to run Windows on your Mac, 
including Apple’s  Boot Camp software, desktop  virtualization software, and code 
interpretation. Now Macs can run Mac OS X, Windows, and  Linux. Indeed, Apple 
computers are the only computers that easily run every major operating system 
on the same computer. You can have your cake and eat it too. In fact, the Mac is 
so good at running Windows that when Windows Vista was ﬁ rst released, some 
tests showed that the best hardware to run Vista was a Macintosh.
Why  Windows?
So as we near the end of this book about working with your Mac in business, 
you may wonder why on earth you would want to run Windows on your Mac. 
After all, this book is full of Mac OS X applications that run circles around creaky 
old Windows applications. But sometimes there is that one application that you 
absolutely cannot live without that hasn’t made the jump (yet) to Mac OS X. This 
may be true for an application you love or, more likely, your company loves and 
insists you use. 
Another reason to load Windows is as a safety net. If you are a lifelong 
Windows user with a rebellious streak and you’ve decided to try a Mac, it is 
comforting to know that, in a jam, you can boot up Windows. I have set up new 
Macs for many switcher friends over the years and for all the times I’ve installed 
this Windows safety net, I have yet to hear from one switcher who still used 
Windows after three months on the Mac unless they were absolutely required to 
do so (kicking and screaming) for some speciﬁ c Windows-only software.

Boot Camp
Shortly after the Macs with the Intel chips started shipping, Apple released its 
own tool for running Windows on your Mac:  Boot Camp.  Boot Camp Assistant is 
a free utility (found in the Utilities folder) that ships on every new Mac that helps 
you install Windows on your Mac and then allows you to boot up directly into 
Microsoft Windows.
Installing Boot Camp
To run Boot Camp, you need an Intel-based Mac with the latest ﬁ rmware 
running Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard or later. Your Mac’s startup (internal) disk 
needs enough extra room for Windows, plus you’ll need the installation discs for 
Microsoft Windows XP, Vista, or 7, along with the appropriate license.
One of the ﬁ rst steps in the Boot Camp installation is partitioning your 
startup disk for Windows; that is, reserving a chunk of space for holding the 
complete Windows environment, as shown in Figure 22-1. Under normal 
circumstances, partitioning your startup disk results in the destruction of all its 
data. Boot Camp, however, does a nondestructive partition, so your existing Mac 
MAC, WINDOWS, AND A FREE LUNCH
I once attended a seminar for a Windows-only application and during the 
ﬁ rst break the speaker practically sprinted toward me to argue how I couldn’t 
possibly be running his application on a Mac. I bet him lunch that I could, 
and it was delicious. Once the other attendees saw how easily I was running 
Windows applications on my Mac, the seminar became more about Macs than 
the software we were there to learn. I think I sold about 10 Macs that day.

data is preserved. You need to have enough free space on your Mac’s startup disk 
(Boot Camp can’t create a Windows partition on other disks) for Windows.
So how big should this partition be? It depends. First, you’ll need enough 
space to run Windows itself, which could require as much as 3GB. Then you must 
decide how much Windows software you intend to install and how many ﬁ les 
you intend to hold on your Boot Camp partition. If you are planning on running 
Windows regularly and keep data ﬁ les on the drive, the partition could be quite 
large. You can get a more precise estimate by looking at the speciﬁ c applications 
you intend to install and their related data ﬁ les to gauge the space required.
I know of one Mac worker who keeps a 200GB Boot Camp partition. In my 
case, I need Windows for only one application and very little data, so I made my 
Boot Camp partition just 10GB, and I have plenty of room left. The trick is to 
make the partition as big as it needs to be, but no larger. After all, you want to 
save space on your hard disk for all those great Mac OS X apps. 
Make sure to leave at least 5GB of free space on the Mac OS X partition 
for memory swap ﬁ les and other system requirements. (If you have less than 
5GB of available space on the Mac OS X partition on your startup disk, it 
slows down your Mac.)
Once you choose your partition size, you can’t change it. If you run out of 
space, you have to start over: wiping out your existing Windows partition, creating 
a new one, and reinstalling Windows and all its apps. So spend a few minutes 
deciding how big to make your partition. 
After telling Boot Camp how much space to carve out for Windows, the 
rest of the installation is straightforward. You are asked to insert the Windows 
installation disc, as shown in Figure 22-2; clicking the Start Installation button 
reboots the Mac. It is important to remember that when prompted to install 
www.ebook777.com

Windows, you do so on the BOOTCAMP partition. If you make a new partition or 
install Windows in your existing Mac OS X partition, you will wipe out all your 
Mac OS X data.
One of the unenviable challenges Microsoft faces with Windows is the 
driver problem. Unlike Apple, which controls the hardware platforms on which 
Mac OS X operates, Microsoft releases Windows to the world with a seemingly 
inﬁ nite number of different computers and hardware combinations. That means 
Microsoft’s driver support burden is practically unimaginable. 
For Mac users, that problem has a direct implication: Microsoft doesn’t 
have drivers for the Mac’s hardware or Mac peripherals. Fortunately, Apple has 
created the drivers for Windows to support Mac hardware, and Boot Camp 
installs them for you. Depending on the age of your Mac, the drivers on your 
Mac OS X installation disc may be out of date, so run the  Apple Software Update 
application in Windows to update your  drivers.
When you are done, your hard disk will have its own Windows partition with 
a full Windows installation ready for use. Having set up a lot of PC computers in 
my day, I can assure you that installing Windows with Boot Camp is one of the 
most painless Windows installations I have ever experienced.
Using Boot Camp
Holding down the Option key while booting a  Boot Camp-enabled Mac 
brings up the Boot Manager. The Boot Manager allows you to choose which disk 
or partition to boot from; use the ➞ and 
➞
 keys to move among the options 
and press Return to select the desired one, or just click the desired option with 
the mouse. If you select a Mac OS X disk or partition, your system boots as 
normal into familiar Mac OS X. If you select a Windows partition, your Mac will 
transform itself into a Windows PC before your eyes.
Running Windows under Boot Camp is no different from running Windows 
on any PC. You can download and install Windows software and data ﬁ les. And 
with Boot Camp 3.0 (the version that comes with Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard), 
you can open, read, and copy ﬁ les from the Mac OS X partition when booted into 
Windows . 
When running Windows, Boot Camp devotes the entire resources of your 
Mac to operating Windows. This is both good and bad. Any computer that runs 
just one operating system at a time has more available resources than one that is 
running multiple operating systems. 
If you are running a resource-intensive graphics application or 3D modeling 
application under Windows, you will want all your system’s processors, memory, 
and resources available to support it.

Most Mac workers, however, do not run Windows applications that are so 
resource-intensive. Instead, they run ofﬁ ce suites and basic graphics applications 
that are not so taxing on their Mac. For them, the inconvenience of having to 
reboot the computer every time they want to switch between operating systems 
outweighs any beneﬁ t of having a single operating system running optimally. You 
can avoid having to reboot to switch between Mac OS X and Windows by using 
third-party desktop virtualization software.
Desktop  Virtualization Software
Although Boot Camp is a great tool, rebooting the Mac to run a Windows 
application is a pain. Especially when the Windows application is something 
simple like Microsoft Access or Intuit QuickBooks. As soon as Apple made the 
Intel transition for the Mac, software developers began releasing products that 
allow you to run Windows as an application inside Mac OS X. This creates a 
virtual Windows computer inside your Mac OS X operating system (thus the 
name “desktop virtualization”). 
Once you have Windows running inside Mac OS X, you can run, for example, 
Microsoft Access for Windows at the same time as iWork Keynote for Mac OS X. 
You can access the same ﬁ les and even copy and paste among them. The best 
desktop virtualization applications on the Mac are Parallels Desktop, VMware 
Fusion, and the open source VirtualBox. Table 22-1 summarizes the beneﬁ ts of 
each application.
www.ebook777.com

Parallels Desktop
Parallels Desktop ($80; www.parallels.com), shown in Figure 22-3, was 
the ﬁ rst commercial desktop virtualization application for the Mac. It can install 
various editions of  Linux and Windows 2000 through Windows 7. 
Parallels Desktop walks you through the Windows installation, streamlining 
the process where possible. Parallels Desktop also installs Parallels Tools on 
the Windows virtual machine, which helps deal with the integration between 
Windows and Mac OS X.
The default setting when installing a Parallels virtual Windows machine is to 
fully integrate your data ﬁ les between Windows and Mac OS X, as shown in Figure 
22-4. This setting allows the PC virtual machine to access your Mac OS X ﬁ les. 
Although  sharing ﬁ les can be convenient if you frequently work in both operating 
systems, it is not necessary if you are only running Windows for a few application. 
Moreover, there is at least a theoretical security risk if a shared data ﬁ le was written 
to corrupt Mac OS X. Although I’ve never heard of such a virus, it is worth noting. 
Regardless, I recommend that you disable the ﬁ le-integration option when setting 
up Parallels Desktop unless you have a good reason to keep it.
Another installation default behavior is to boot Windows in Parallels 
Desktop’s Coherence mode, shown in Figure 22-5, which integrates your 
Windows applications into Mac OS X. This mode allows Windows applications 
to run in Mac OS X as if they were Mac applications, and it gets rid of a lot of the 
Windows trappings of a separate desktop. If you prefer to work in the traditional 
Windows desktop, turn off Coherence mode.
WINDOWS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE AND BACKUP
Although there is a legitimate debate about whether to run  antivirus 
software on a Mac (see Chapter 23), there is no question of the need for 
antivirus software in Windows.
Whether you are running Windows through Boot Camp or through 
desktop virtualization, you really need to have an antivirus program installed 
in Windows if it is ever connected to the Internet, accesses e-mail, or accesses 
shared ﬁ les. Windows, whether run on a PC or on a Mac, is susceptible to all 
the viruses, worms, Trojan horses, key loggers, and other malicious software 
every other Windows computer faces. One free option is Microsoft’s  Security 
Essentials, found at www.microsoft.com/security_essentials.
If your Windows Boot Camp partition or virtual machine becomes 
infected, it is generally not an issue for your Mac OS X partition. The 
malicious code is usually speciﬁ cally written for Windows and thus cannot 
execute in Mac OS X. 

www.ebook777.com

Parallels Desktop provides a great Windows experience. As of this writing, 
Parallels Desktop is generally considered to be the fastest Windows virtualization 
application. It wins most benchmark tests for graphics performance and for more 
nuts-and-bolts tasks like copying ﬁ les and rebooting.
The newest version of Parallels includes the Crystal View mode, which 
integrates Windows even deeper into the Mac OS X Desktop. The Crystal View 
mode is similar to the Coherence mode but hides Windows even more. In Crystal 
View mode, all Parallels Desktop controls, icons, and menus are hidden, except 
for the Parallels icon in the Mac menu bar and Windows Applications folder 
in the  Dock. Although Parallels can hide Windows, Crystal View mode does 
not magically turn your Windows applications into Mac OS X applications. For 
example, Windows applications still don’t work with the Mac OS X Dock’s Exposé 
feature. However, Crystal Mode view does remove nearly all traces of Windows 
from your desktop.
Parallels Desktop runs the common Windows productivity applications, 
such as Microsoft Ofﬁ ce for Windows, Internet Explorer, and QuickBooks 
without breaking a sweat. The most recent version of Parallels Desktop is even 
more graphics-friendly. Parallels Desktop also supports using up to eight cores 
(on Macs whose processors have eight cores). The ability to run up to eight 

cores substantially increases the computing power of Windows processor-heavy 
applications such as graphics and video applications.
There was a time when Windows video processing and graphics applications 
could only run on a Mac by rebooting into Windows on a Boot Camp partition, 
thus turning your entire Mac over to Windows. This is not true any more. Parallels 
Desktop now uses Mac OS X’s  OpenGL graphics protocols to deliver acceptable 
performance for high-end graphics applications. 
A nice feature in Parallels Desktop (as well as in VMware Fusion, covered later), 
is  multimonitor support. If you have two monitors hooked up to your Mac, you 
can use one for a Windows screen and the other as a Mac OS X screen. If you often 
work in both operating systems, it is nice having each platform on its own screen — 
plus it provides a constant source of amusement as you watch co-workers’ reactions.
If you have a multitouch Apple  Magic Trackpad or  Magic Mouse, Parallels 
Desktop supports  gestures. But I have to warn you: After using gestures in 
Windows on a Mac through Parallels Desktop, it feels strange to lose that ability 
when you sit at a traditional Windows PC.
Parallels Desktop was the ﬁ rst virtualization application on the Mac, and its 
maturity is repeatedly evident as recent versions continue to add useful tools and 
additional spit and polish to an already stable desktop virtualization environment.
Fusion
EMC VMware is an experienced virtualization software developer, with 
several virtualization products on other platforms. It’s in the Mac desktop 
virtualization business with its  Fusion ($80; www.vmware.com/fusion) 
product, shown in Figure 22-6.
Although Fusion was later to the Mac virtualization game than Parallels 
Desktop, the company’s virtualization experience allowed Fusion to hit the 
WHAT ABOUT  LINUX?
Windows isn’t the only alternative operating system you may want to run 
on your Mac. Linux is an alternative, open source, free operating system that 
comes in many variations. A user-friendly version of Linux popular among 
desktop virtualization users is Ubuntu, although many IT staff prefer Novell’s 
Suse because it works well with some Windows administration tools. There 
are open-source applications, such as IBM’s  Symphony, for  Ubuntu, Suse, and 
some Linux variants that work well with Microsoft Ofﬁ ce ﬁ les. The  Firefox 
browser is available for Linux, and the  Evolution e-mail client holds its own 
against Microsoft Outlook and Entourage.
If you are running desktop virtualization software on your Mac, you can 
load Linux as a virtual machine and kick the tires for yourself.

ground running. Fusion has many of the same features as Parallels, including 
multicore and 64-bit support to take advantage of the latest Macs’ performance 
capabilities. Like Parallels Desktop, Fusion streamlines the Windows installation 
process by offering an easy-install option that automates several steps. Once 
Windows is installed, you can manage your virtual machines with the Fusion 
Virtual Machine Library panel, shown in Figure 22-7.
VMware also provides a free application,  VMware Migration Assistant, that 
allows you to clone your existing PC onto your Fusion-equipped Mac. To make 
the transfer, both computers need to be attached to the same network. Although 
VMware states this can be done wirelessly, it is much faster (and likely to succeed) 
if both computers are wired to the network with Ethernet cables. This is ideal for 
Windows switchers who want to have the safety blanket of that old PC available 
on their Mac, even if they no longer have the actual PC around. 
Fusion does not have the feature-creep that you ﬁ nd in Parallels Desktop: 
The interface is more streamlined and more comprehensible for new users, 
making it easier to use and conﬁ gure.
Fusion’s Unity view, shown in Figure 22-8, helps you run Windows 
applications while getting rid of much of the Windows interface. Using the 
Unity view, you can hide the Windows Start menu and the Windows taskbar. 

www.ebook777.com

Unity view can also run Windows applications directly from the Mac OS X 
Dock. 
Fusion lets you drag and drop  ﬁ les between Windows and Mac OS X. For 
easier sharing, you can make ﬁ les available to both operating systems via shared 
folders. I’m more in favor of copying ﬁ les as needed. Move the ﬁ le onto your 
Windows desktop and when you are ﬁ nished working with the ﬁ le in Windows, 
copy it back to Mac OS X. Chalk it up to superstition but I prefer to keep my data 
ﬁ les exclusively in Mac OS X whenever possible.
One of Fusion’s more interesting features is the ability to install 
preconﬁ gured virtual machines. Fusion virtual machines are portable, so they can 
be installed on other VMware products. VMware has its own  Virtual Appliance 
Marketplace, found at www.vmware.com/appliances, with more than 1,000 
ready-made operating-system-and-application combinations. You just download 
the virtual machine of your choice and plug it into Fusion. This is great if you 
want to experiment with other operating systems, such as Linux.
Fusion’s application upgrade process is more reliable than Parallels 
Desktop’s. With Fusion, you are prompted when there is a software update, 
and the application does all the work. In my experience, Parallels Desktop’s 
autoinstaller is not as reliable and often requires me to manually install updates. 
An important feature recently added to Fusion, which Parallels Desktop also 
offers, is  application sharing. You can set certain ﬁ le types to launch with speciﬁ c 
Mac or Windows applications. For example, you can open all PDF ﬁ les — even 
those on your Windows virtual machine — with Mac OS X’s Preview application. 
Likewise, it allows you to open all QuickBooks ﬁ les — even those in Mac OS X 
folders — in QuickBooks under Windows. You can even drag a Windows ﬁ le on 
to a Mac OS X application in the Mac OS X Dock and, assuming the ﬁ le type is 
supported by the application, have it opened in that application.
The newest version of Fusion adds support for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow 
Leopard’s  OpenGL graphics acceleration. As in Parallels Desktop, this means 
you don’t need to use a Boot Camp partition to run Windows by itself for many 
graphics-heavy applications. Fusion’s graphics performance, however, generally 
trails slightly behind Parallels Desktop’s on most benchmark tests. 
Both Parallels Desktop and Fusion support installation of Mac OS X 10.6 
Server clients. If you have a license to run Mac OS X Server, you can do it virtually 
on your “regular” Mac. The ability to run Mac OS X Server is useful for network 
administrators and software developers.
VirtualBox
Several years ago, the now-defunct Sun Microsystems created a Mac OS X 
virtualization product called  VirtualBox, shown in Figure 22-9. Now managed 

as an open source project, VirtualBox (www.virtualbox.org) is available 
through a free license for personal and educational use and through a paid 
license for commercial use. 
Although VirtualBox can adequately run Windows applications, it lacks many 
of the features as well as the speed found in Parallels Desktop and Fusion.
For example, VirtualBox does not assist you with the Windows installation. 
Both Parallels Desktop and Fusion allow you to run a Boot Camp Windows 
partition as if it were their own virtual machine, VirtualBox does not.
The most notable deﬁ ciency in VirtualBox is the inability to run graphics-
intense applications. Although VirtualBox has some graphics support, the 
performance is noticeably slower than that of Parallels Desktop and Fusion. 
VirtualBox is also glitchy when you try to watch video in the Windows virtual 
machine.
Which virtual machine application?
Deciding which virtual machine application to use depends on your needs. 
If you only run QuickBooks for Windows or similar Windows-only application 
speciﬁ c to your work that does not overly tax your Mac, any of the three desktop 
virtualization products will work. However, VirtualBox is a little more tricky to set 
www.ebook777.com

up and a bit slower, so I believe it is worth paying for Parallels Desktop or Fusion. 
For the additional expense,  Parallels Desktop and  Fusion give you better ease of 
use, migration between operating systems, and better graphics performance. 
But choosing between Parallels Desktop and Fusion is not so easy. Generally, 
Parallels Desktop wins on power and tools, whereas Fusion wins on usability. But 
neither victory is by a large margin; both applications are very good. VMware’s 
Virtual Machine Marketplace is also extremely convenient if you plan on loading 
Linux operating systems. Fortunately, both Parallels Desktop and Fusion have free 
trial periods, so you can try them before making your decision. 
I have been using Parallels Desktop since it was released on the Mac and thus 
am most comfortable with it. However, when working with Fusion for this book, 
I was able to duplicate all the functionality I use in Parallels Desktop with very 
little effort, and I haven’t gone back to Parallels Desktop. 
Whichever you choose, one thing is clear: Both applications have made so 
many advances with graphics performance that there is little need for Apple’s 
Boot Camp except for the most performance-intensive applications.
CrossOver Mac
Whether you run Boot Camp or a virtualization application to put Windows 
on your Mac, you need to buy a full Microsoft Windows license and install 
Windows on your Mac.  CrossOver Mac allows you to avoid that.
A long time ago, there was an open source project called Wine that sought 
to get Windows applications running in Linux without Windows. The idea was 
to duplicate the Windows commands in Linux. For example, when a Windows 
program loaded and told the computer to print, the software could translate that 
command into the Print command for Linux, effectively bypassing the need for 
Windows. The Wine project sought to do the same thing on a Mac. It worked, but 
only sort of.
Since then, CodeWeavers built on the Wine project to release CrossOver Mac 
(www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac), which allows you to install and 
run Windows software without having Windows. CrossOver Mac Standard costs 
$40, and a professional version costs $70, offering better technical support and a 
copy of  CrossOver Games so you can run Windows games on the Mac. 
CrossOver acts as an intermediary between the Windows software and the 
Mac OS, translating Windows instructions into their counterparts on the Mac OS. 
The result is surreal, as Figure 22-10 shows as the Windows application appears 
on your Mac using the Mac OS X user interface.
The trouble is that not all Windows applications are programmed the same 
way, so — as a simple example — how Microsoft Word handles printing can differ 

from how Intuit’s Quicken does. As a result, CodeWeavers would have to do a lot of 
work to ensure the huge variety of Windows applications will run in CrossOver. 
The result is that only a few actually do run in CrossOver, and even then 
not all their capabilities work. CodeWeavers has the most popular Windows 
applications — such as Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, Microsoft Project, several Adobe 
applications, and Quicken — working in CrossOver. Sadly, QuickBooks — one 
of best reasons to install Windows on a Mac — works only in a limited fashion 
with CrossOver:  QuickBooks 2005 and 2006 run, but no version since has been 
certiﬁ ed to run at all. 
The CodeWeavers Web site has a complete list of tested and untested 
Windows applications at www.codeweavers.com/compatibility. If the 
Windows applications you need works in CrossOver, download the free trial and 
decide for yourself whether you can forego installing Windows.
Running Windows on your Mac gives you the best of both worlds: a stable 
secure operating system and the ability to run any software you may need. If you 
play your cards right, it may also one day get you a free lunch.

one are the days when we can use our computers without concern 
for security. Your Mac is important to you; it is an expensive machine 
containing important data that allows you to get ahead at work. You 
need to take steps to protect both the Mac and the data on it. The Mac features 
some useful security tools, both built-in and from independent developers, to 
keep your computer and your data safe. This chapter explains the best practices 
for securing your Mac.
Physical Security
When addressing computer  security, the importance of physical security is 
often overlooked. It is much easier to steal your data, ideas, and information 
if someone has physical possession of your Mac than through some indirect 
Internet-based attack. So how do you keep prying hands off your Mac?
The best tool to protect your computer’s physical security is your own 
common sense. If you ﬁ nd yourself in a coffee shop and want a reﬁ ll, do not walk 
across the room leaving your computer on the table. Shut the lid and carry it with 
you. Also, spend some time thinking about where you want to sit in a public 
place with your expensive computer. Right next to the door is a bad idea. In the 
corner, where a potential thief would have to navigate through a room full of 
patrons to escape with your machine, is a much better one.
Every Mac laptop has built-in support for a  Kensington lock (www.
kensington.com). This computer lock allows you to bolt your computer to a 
ﬁ xed device, such as a table leg. For example, you can lock your Mac to the desk 
in your hotel room while you are out. A Kensington lock may also be helpful at 
an unsecured workplace.
There are several software packages and services available that track 
the location of your Mac. One is  Undercover ($49; www.orbicule.com/
undercover/mac). Undercover uses Wi-Fi positioning to locate your stolen or 
missing Mac. It also sends screenshots from your Mac and snaps pictures every 
eight minutes using the built-in iSight Web camera. Plus, Undercover simulates

a hardware failure, which may prompt the thief to take it in for repair. Your Mac 
then posts a message on the screen explaining it is stolen.
The important thing is to remember that while you have good intentions, not 
everyone else does. There are crooks looking for low-hanging fruit, and Apples are 
particularly juicy. When you leave home with your Mac, you need to take steps to 
protect yourself and your Mac.
Insuring Your Mac
It is expensive to replace your computer, so insuring your investment may be 
a good idea. There are two types of insurance: the  AppleCare Protection Plan and 
third-party insurance.
AppleCare
AppleCare (www.apple.com/applecare) is Apple’s own insurance for 
your Apple hardware. Every new Mac includes a one-year warranty. Purchasing an 
AppleCare warranty (prices vary between $200 and $350) allows you to extend 
the insurance to three years. You can purchase an AppleCare warranty at any time 
within the ﬁ rst year of ownership. Quite often you can get a slight discount on 
AppleCare if you buy it with a new Mac or shop for it online from resellers such 
as Amazon.com.
An AppleCare warranty covers manufacturing problems and normal wear. 
If, after two and a half years, your hard drive fails, Apple will install a new one if 
you have the extended AppleCare warranty. However, AppleCare does not cover 
accidental damage. If you drop your Mac and crack the screen, the AppleCare 
warranty does not cover the repair. It also does not cover theft or loss.
Although opinions are mixed concerning the need for AppleCare with 
desktop Macs, it is a good idea with laptops. The electronics on laptops are 
crammed into a small package and take a lot of abuse as you carry them around 
and are more likely than the desktop Macs to have problems within the ﬁ rst three 
years of ownership. The cost of just about any service performed on a laptop will 
THE COFFEE SHOP SNATCH AND GRAB
A law enforcement friend once told me about one of the most common 
criminal gambits for stealing laptops. The criminals work coffee shops as a 
team and look for  someone near an exit. The ﬁ rst team member, usually an 
attractive woman, approaches and distracts the unwitting victim. The other 
team member then snatches the laptop and runs out the door. When done 
properly, the laptop is halfway down the street before the owner realizes it’s 
gone. Be careful.

exceed the expense of AppleCare. Also, Apple is pretty fair about warranty service. 
I once had a laptop that had several problems. After three attempts to repair it, 
Apple simply gave me a new one.
Theft, loss, and damage policies
Because AppleCare does not cover accidental damage, theft, and loss, 
additional insurance coverage may be appropriate. If you have a homeowner’s or 
renter’s insurance policy, you can often purchase an insurance rider policy that 
covers accidental damage, theft, and loss of your Mac. If you can’t get insurance 
through an existing policy, you can purchase a speciﬁ c policy for your Mac. There 
are several reputable insurance brokers that specialize in portable electronics. 
I keep one on my MacBook that costs about $100 a year. If I lose my computer, or 
it gets run over by a truck, I get a replacement. If you take your Mac out often, the 
premium may be worth the peace of mind.
An important point is that AppleCare and a damage and loss policy cover 
two separate problems. Most accidental damage, theft, and loss policies do not 
cover warranty repairs. You need to check with your insurer but you may need 
both types of policies for full coverage.
Data  Security
In addition to physical security, Mac workers need to protect the data on their 
machines. There are several tools built into Mac OS X and available from third-
party vendors for just this purpose.
System password
The very ﬁ rst thing you should do with any Mac is install a system password. 
A system  password, set up in the  Accounts system preference shown in Figure 
23-1, is the ﬁ rst level of defense on your Mac. Although well-motivated hackers 
can get past a system password, it will keep honest people honest. Moreover, 
when combined with PGP or FileVault encryption, explained later, your security 
becomes formidable. (You get to the system preferences by choosing 4 ➧ System 
Preferences.)
After setting your system password, you can add security to it in the Security 
system preference, as shown in Figure 23-2.
You can set your Mac to require a password immediately or within a set time 
after your screen saver begins. You can also disable automatic login and set a 
timer to lock your Mac after a set period. 
The secure virtual memory setting encrypts your data as the contents of your 
Mac’s memory (including passwords and other sensitive data) are swapped out 
www.ebook777.com

to your hard disk. This setting causes a slight performance hit to your Mac but is 
worth it for the security-conscious. While you are in this system preference, also 
disable your Mac’s infrared receiver unless you plan on using an Apple remote 
with your Mac. Besides subjecting you to unplanned computer activity if there is 
surrounding infrared noise, this receiver also provides hackers one more vector 
into your Mac.
Data  encryption
One of the best ways to protect your data is to encrypt it. Encryption 
scrambles your data, preventing others from reading it without the encryption 
key. There are two ways to accomplish this with Apple’s built-in software, File 
Vault, and by using secured disk images.

File Vault
FileVault is Apple’s disk encryption utility. It is built into Mac OS X and 
available on every Mac currently sold. It can be accessed through the Security 
system preference’s FileVault tab, as shown in Figure 23-3. Once enabled, 
FileVault encrypts your  Home folder. The data kept within the FileVault is not 
accessible without a password.
With FileVault enabled, it is difﬁ cult for someone to access ﬁ les in your 
Home folder. But FileVault encryption has a cost: It increases the amount of space 
used on your hard disk by your home directory. FileVault also limits your ability 
to use a  Time Machine backup. When using FileVault, you can’t restore individual 
ﬁ les; you can only restore the entire FileVault database. There are also claims by 
some researchers that the FileVault encryption algorithm can be hacked. I’ve never 
heard of anyone actually breaking through FileVault’s encryption and suspect 
it would be quite difﬁ cult. Finally, make sure to keep track of your FileVault 
password. If you lose the password, you also lose all your data.
Perhaps the biggest shortcoming with FileVault is that you cannot select 
which data to encrypt. FileVault encrypts only the entire Home folder: your 
Documents, Downloads, Movies, Music, and Pictures folders, as well as any 
folders and ﬁ les inside them. Any data outside your  Home folder is not 
encrypted.
If FileVault is not enough for your privacy needs, there is a paid product, PGP 
(covered later in this chapter), that offers more complete data encryption.

Mac OS X secured disk images
One little-known feature of Mac OS X is the ability to create secured disk 
images without any additional software. These are small (or large) virtual drives 
that you create and encrypt. It takes just minutes to create such a password-
protected disk. Once created, you can ﬁ ll the encrypted disk with conﬁ dential 
data and, once the secured disk image is closed, no prying eyes can return to the 
data without the password.
Many users keep several secured disk images with particular data such as 
client information, ﬁ nancial data, and personal information. Let’s walk through 
the creation of an encrypted disk image:
1. 
1. Open Disk Utility. Go to your  Utilities folder (found inside the 
Applications folder; you can press Shift+J+U to get there quickly) and 
double-click Disk Utility to open the application. Disk Utility comes free 
with Mac OS X to manage, modify, and monitor your hard disk. It also is 
the application from which you create a secured disk image.
2. 
2. Create the disk image. In the sidebar of Disk Utility is a list of all the 
disks on your computer. It is important to verify that none of the existing 
disks are selected when creating a new disk image; you can ensure nothing 
is selected by clicking in the white space below the list of disks. Once you 
are certain that no disks are selected, click the New Image icon at the top.
3. 
3. Specify the disk image settings. You are then presented with the 
Save As dialog box that has all the parameters for your secured disk 
image. They should be filled in as follows (see Figure 23-4):
 ◗
Name: Give your secure image a distinctive name so you will 
remember what it is in the future. Alternatively, you can give it a 
generic name to confuse prying eyes.
 ◗
Size: There are several built-in default sizes. You can choose any of 
these or create your own custom size. Once the encrypted disk image 
is formed, you cannot change the size, so make sure you make it large 
enough to hold any anticipated needs. If your sparse image begins to 
run out of room, make a new, larger one and copy the data into the 
new image before discarding the old one.
 ◗
Format: Leave this at the default setting:  Mac OS Extended 
(Journaled).
 ◗
Encryption: Choose your encryption method, 128- or 256-bit 
encryption. I normally use 128-bit encryption, but for the strongest 
possible security, use the slower 256-bit method.
 ◗
Partitions: Leave this at the default: Single Partition – Apple 
Partition Map.

 ◗
Image Format: Select Sparse Disk Image, which allows you to keep 
the size of the drive to the actual data stored inside it. If you make a 
5GB sparse image but only place 200MB of data in it, the disk image’s 
ﬁ le size is 200MB. The disk image’s ﬁ le can grow to 5GB as you add 
data, but you don’t use the full 5GB until you need to. Note that 
sparse disk images don’t get smaller as you delete ﬁ les.
4. 
4. Pick a location for your new image, and then click Create.
5. 
5. Enter a password. Make it a good one. Do not check Remember 
Password in My  Keychain; otherwise, someone with Keychain access 
to your Mac can open the secure image. Once you have entered your 
password and clicked OK, Mac OS X builds the secure sparse image. 
If you open the Finder, you will see the image is already mounted and ready 
to be ﬁ lled with your conﬁ dential data. Once you have loaded your conﬁ dential 
data into the sparse image, you can eject it to lock it. When you need to access the 
data, simply double-click the sparse image ﬁ le to open a dialog box that asks for 
your password. When you are ﬁ nished, eject the disk to lock it again.
The sparse image ﬁ le can be copied, relocated, moved, and otherwise treated 
like any Mac OS X ﬁ le. It is a good idea to make several copies of the sparse image 
and place them on backup disks, thumb drives, or other locations. 
Secure sparse images are great for keeping data sets conﬁ dential. Because 
they are so portable, they are an excellent option for storing data on cloud-based 
servers, like  MobileMe or  Dropbox, with an extra layer of protection. If you have 
limited amounts of secure data, a secure sparse image might be all the protection 
you need.

PGP encryption
In addition to the Apple tools, several companies have released Mac-based 
encryption products. One of the best is  PGP Whole Disk Encryption.
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption ($150; www.pgp.com) is an 
established encryption company in the PC world but a relative newcomer to 
the Mac. Unlike FileVault, which just encrypts the  Home folder’s contents, PGP 
Whole Disk Encryption encrypts the entire disk. Everything is secured.
Setting up PGP is simple: You install the software and allow it to encrypt 
the disk. Depending on the size of your disk, this can take several hours. Once 
the process is complete, the disk completely encrypts itself every time you shut it 
down. When you turn on your Mac, you are prompted for your PGP password. 
Without it, the disk is locked up tight. Unless the thief has your password, he 
can’t get access to the disk’s contents, even if he boots from a different disk. PGP 
also gives you the ability to securely  encrypt  e-mail and  iChat communications. 
PGP works at the root level of the disk, so it can limit some functionality. For 
example, when making a major operating system upgrade, such as from Mac OS X 
10.5 Leopard to Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, PGP requires that you uninstall it 
ﬁ rst. I have used PGP on my MacBook since it was ﬁ rst released and I have never 
had any signiﬁ cant issue or degradation in performance. It is very comforting 
knowing that if my MacBook is stolen or lost, conﬁ dential data will remain 
conﬁ dential.
PGP is an enterprise-friendly company: If you are running a Mac network, 
you can buy site licenses to cover your entire ofﬁ ce. Although there are no perfect 
tools and hackers are always probing for ways to access encrypted data, PGP is 
one of the most complete tools available on Mac OS X.
Viruses and Other Malware
 Apple spends a lot of time bragging how the Mac platform is safer than 
Windows. That is true, to a certain point. Although Mac OS X has not experienced 
the types of security problems that plague Windows, there are still risks to Mac 
users.
 Viruses and  antivirus software
One of the most frequent questions asked by Windows switchers to the Mac 
OS X platform is “What antivirus program should I run?” The answer depends on 
several factors. Although Mac OS X certainly isn’t impervious to viruses, the fact 
remains there have been very few documented cases of viruses in the wild on Mac 
OS X. There are several reasons for there have been few viruses in Mac OS X. 

First, Mac OS X isn’t as friendly to viruses as other operating systems. Because 
it is based on Unix, Mac OS X compartmentalizes a lot of the data it holds. 
Although a virus could get into certain parts of memory, that doesn’t mean it will 
ﬁ nd its way into others. Mac OS X is very good at segregating its memory, also 
called  sandboxing. Mac OS X also requires you to enter your name and system 
password for the installation of any new software. This act of requiring you to 
actively approve installation of new software is useful to prevent installation of 
viruses and malicious code.
Another reason Mac OS X doesn’t have the virus problems Windows does is 
market share: Even with its recent success, the Mac is a very small portion of the 
overall computing market. When an operating system is only on one of every 20 
computers, virus programmers are less likely to target it. But this could change 
given the Mac’s recent popularity (it now accounts for about one in 10 new PCs 
sold). At some point, Mac market share is going to rise so high that viruses will be 
targeted at Mac OS X.
Several software vendors sell antivirus software for the Macintosh. Two of 
the more notable products are  Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh ($50; www.
norton.com/mac) and  Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Mac ($40; www.kaspersky.
com). These products not only detect known Macintosh viruses but also Windows 
viruses. Quite often, Windows viruses are spread using e-mail attachments, so 
Mac workers may unwittingly help distribute these viruses when forwarding 
e-mail with Windows virus attachments.
In addition to security tools on your Mac, your company may have its own 
IT-imposed security policies. These often require installation of software endpoint 
security tools for IT staff. The same companies that make desktop virus software 
usually design these tools, and most have Mac support. In that case, you need to 
check with your IT department to make certain it gets the right tools on your Mac.
The decision to install virus software requires a balancing of the necessity for 
the additional protection against the impact on system resources and is different 
for every person. If you do run antivirus software, you should not have a false 
sense of security. Even with antivirus software installed, you are still vulnerable to 
Trojan and phishing attacks explained later.
Trojan horse attacks
A Trojan horse, named after the mythological trickery in Homer’s and Virgil’s 
epic poems, is something attractive to the user that, once installed, creates all 
sorts of mischief. Trojan infection involves some action by the Mac user. The 
user unwittingly downloads and approves the malicious code. Trojans are useful 
to virus writers for data theft, keyboard logging (tracking your keystrokes to get 
www.ebook777.com

passwords and other secrets), creating botnets (a network of computers used for 
spamming), or even the malicious destruction of your hard disk.
Trojans have been distributed on the Mac OS X platform. In 2009, following 
Apple’s release of iWork, an illegal unlocked copy found its way onto the Bit 
Torrent ﬁ le-sharing site. Many users downloaded copies and, when installing 
them, unwittingly installed a Trojan horse on their Macs. Both the Norton and 
Kapersky antivirus programs were quickly updated to catch the  iWork Trojan.
The best practice for avoiding Trojan horses is to practice safe computing. The 
iWork incident is a good example. It infected only people downloading illegal 
software. Trojans are often distributed through illegal software downloads and 
pornography Web sites. Anyone who downloads software from the Internet is at 
risk of allowing a Trojan onto his or her Mac. Again, the best defense is common 
sense: Only download and install software from trusted sources. Like your mother 
always told you: If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Phishing
Phishing (pronounced “ﬁ shing”) is the fraudulent acquisition of your 
sensitive data. Phishing is not a form of virus. Instead it is a subterfuge where 
the bad guys masquerade as a trustworthy Web site to get you to provide credit 
card, ﬁ nancial information, or other sensitive data. Phishing attacks often start 
with you receiving an e-mail that informs you of some important change to your 
bank account. When you click the link, you are presented a Web site that looks 
USING THE  FIREWALL
Mac OS X has a built-in ﬁ rewall that, oddly, is turned off by default. The 
Mac OS X ﬁ rewall, found in the Security system preference, exists to monitor 
the communications entering your Mac and block unauthorized access. The 
idea is to allow you to communicate with the outside world using tools like 
iChat and Safari while preventing malicious attacks from the outside. 
Although some ﬁ rewalls are extremely complex, the built-in Mac OS X 
ﬁ rewall is not. In Mac OS X, the ﬁ rewall is either on or off. You can make 
adjustments for speciﬁ c applications under the Advanced tab but otherwise 
there is nothing to conﬁ gure. If, while using your ﬁ rewall, you ﬁ nd a certain 
application cannot send or receive data from the Internet, check your 
ﬁ rewall’s Advanced tab and add that application to the list.
Although Apple’s ﬁ rewall is not the strongest, it does afford some 
protection. Most ofﬁ ce networks have their own hardware ﬁ rewall built into 
their network. In those instances, the ﬁ rewall may be unnecessary on your 
Mac. However, whenever accessing coffee shop, airport, or other public  Wi-Fi 
hot spots, you should have your ﬁ rewall turned on.

identical to your bank’s Web site but in reality is an entirely different site hosted, 
quite frequently, on the other side of the world. You dutifully type in your 
account information and password — and you are compromised. 
These attacks aren’t just limited to banking. Phishing attacks are also 
engineered around any ﬁ nancial or other transaction such as PayPal and 
MobileMe account information. Mac users are just as vulnerable to phishing 
attacks as any other computer user on the Internet.
Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and on the rise. You 
used to be able to determine a phishing attack by looking at your address bar in 
your browser. If, for example, you believed you were going to Bank of America 
but your address bar showed some Web site in Russia, you knew you had a 
problem. Unfortunately, phishers have now ﬁ gured out how to spoof (fake) those 
addresses. 
No legitimate ﬁ nancial institution is going to e-mail you and ask you to 
click a link to give sensitive data. When you get an e-mail from your bank or 
other ﬁ nancial institution, don’t click any links. Instead open your browser and 
use your own bookmarks or type in the address yourself. Another clue is how 
the e-mail is addressed. When your bank writes an e-mail, it generally includes 
your account name in the e-mail. If the user name isn’t present and the e-mail is 
simply addressed to “valued customer,” your defense shields should immediately 
go up. Finally, if you are ever informed of any account problems, close the lid on 
your Mac and call the bank. Don’t call the number in your e-mail. Open your 
address book or look at your last statement and call the number that you know is 
good.
Managing  Passwords
When using your Mac, it is essential that you have a reliable password 
management system. Using modern computers, a hacker can easily throw the 
entire dictionary at a password ﬁ eld. Gone are the days when “pencil” was good 
enough. Many users don’t give passwords enough thought and end up defaulting 
to the same two or three passwords over and over again. The trouble is that the 
hackers know this: Once they get your password anywhere, they have it nearly 
everywhere.
That’s why you need a reliable password generation and management system. 
Some users keep a text ﬁ le on their computer with a list of sites and passwords. 
Although this may be sufﬁ cient, it is insecure. Anyone with ﬁ ve minutes at your 
machine could access and copy your entire list.
Another solution is to have your browser keep your login passwords in 
the built-in Mac OS X  Keychain utility. This is a better solution but also has its 
www.ebook777.com

security risks. Also, because Mac workers often ﬁ nd themselves using multiple 
Web browsers, the passwords and logins may not always be available.
One of the best password tools on the Mac is  1Password ($40; 
www.1password.com). This application, which also has Windows,  iPhone, 
and  iPad versions, installs as a standalone application in Mac OS X and creates 
shortcuts in your browsers. When you sign up for a new Web site, 1Password 
creates a password with a random string of characters extremely difﬁ cult to crack. 
You can even set parameters to the password such as length and avoidance of 
confusingly similar characters, as shown in Figure 23-5. 
1Password then inserts your new super password and creates its own login in 
the 1Password database. Forever after, when you visit that site, you can click on 
the 1Password icon in your browser bar and automatically ﬁ ll in your user name 
and the insanely complicated password. Because everything is automated, you 
can use a different password for every login.
An additional beneﬁ t of using 1Password is that it helps avoid phishing 
attacks. 1Password only offers to ﬁ ll in passwords for sites you have already 
registered. So, if you are directed to your bank’s alleged Web site but 1Password 
is not offering to log in, you may not be at your bank’s Web site and red ﬂ ags 
should go up.
1Password also stores your biographical and credit card information so you 
can ﬁ ll in Web forms directly from your 1Password data store. Finally, 1Password 
also keeps other data such as e-mail and FTP logins and secure notes where you 
can keep any conﬁ dential data that is locked behind the 1Password wall, as 
shown in Figure 23-6.

Security and Mac OS X Server
If you are running a Mac ofﬁ ce,   Mac OS X Server adds several network 
wide security tools. The server administration tools provide the IT staff remote 
administration and granular ﬁ le management and communication  privileges. 
Mac OS X Server also integrates a 128-bit encrypted channel between systems 
and ﬁ le authentication services, limiting access to particular data. In addition 
to its own strong ﬁ rewall, Mac OS X Server also incorporates the open standard 
Common Data Security Architecture (CDSA) that includes the ability to create 
security-enabled applications. As you can see, Mac OS X Server has many 
advanced security tools.
Although you are generally safer on a Mac than a Windows PC, Mac users 
still need to take security seriously. Using the tools in this chapter and a bit of 
common sense, you should be able to work with your Mac securely.

W
hen you need a new feature for your Mac, you usually go out and 
ﬁ nd the software that will do the job. Indeed, most of this book is 
about ﬁ nding the right application. But what about making your 
own applications or enhancing the features of your existing applications? 
Normally, creating an app or adding features to an application requires that 
you write your own software.  Programming is not easy; it takes years of training 
and experience to do well. For those of us without the time and patience to learn 
how to program, Apple has created several tools to help us automate our Macs. 
These automation tools let you create a type of mini-program that performs 
specialized tasks and let you connect existing applications to make them work in 
new and better ways. This chapter covers the two primary automation tools on 
the Mac: Automator and AppleScript.
Automator
Automator is installed on all Macs for one purpose: to simplify repetitive 
tasks. Consider it your own personal robot. (Indeed, the Automator icon is a 
robot named Otto.) The idea behind Automator is to allow anyone, without a 
lick of programming experience, to create his or her Automator actions. Creating 
Automator workﬂ ows requires no computer programming whatsoever. With its 
drag-and-drop functionality, Automator lets you quickly create actions and start 
saving time. So let’s create an Automator  action.
Resizing images
Imagine you just returned from your company’s latest retreat and your boss 
walks into your ofﬁ ce and hands you a disc full of pictures that she wants posted 
on the company Web site before the day is over. You open the disk on your Mac 
to discover there are 638 pictures and they are all 3,888 by 2,592 pixels — much 
too large for the Web. So you have one hour to resize 638 images. No problem! 
Automator to the rescue.
The secret is to build a workﬂ ow in Automator to resize those photos. First 
open Automator (found in the Applications folder). Upon launch, Automator 
Mac 
Mac  Automation
Automation
www.ebook777.com

gives you an option window to choose the type of workﬂ ow you are going to 
build (shown in Figure 24-1).
There are several types of Automator  workﬂ ows:
 ◗
Workflow: A workflow is a set of Automator instructions that can be run 
from within Automator and is often the starting point for making new 
automation workflows. You can explore and experiment with available 
actions, as covered later in this chapter. A workflow is also the easiest 
place to build and run one time scripts, that you don’t anticipate needing 
in the future. In order to run a workflow, Automator must be open.
 ◗
Application:  Applications are workflows that do not need Automator 
running to work. When you perfect your workflow, save it as an 
application. (To do this, choose File ➧ Save As and select Application in 
the Automator Save As dialog box.) You can then keep the application in 
a folder (or on your Mac OS X Dock) and run it by dragging files onto the 
application icon. Using the resizing example, you could drag images onto 
the completed Automator resizing application.
 ◗
Service:  Services are a new addition to Automator with Mac OS X 
10.6 Snow Leopard. Services are handy: They install themselves in the 
contextual menu (accessed by Control+clicking or right-clicking a file). 

They accept text, images, or other files and perform specific actions on 
them. (We are going to build a service later in this chapter.)
 ◗
Folder action:  Folder actions are workflows installed in a folder. 
Whenever you drag a file into the folder, the Automator script runs on the 
file. If, for example, you often need to resize photos to a specified size, you 
could create a folder with an folder action that resizes images dropped in it.
 ◗
Print Plug-in:  Print plug-ins are workflows in the Print dialog box. 
They install to the PDF output menu (covered in Chapter 12). The Print 
Plug-in workflow makes a PDF version of your document and lets you 
take further actions, such as filing and e-mailing.
 ◗
iCal alarm: These Automator workflows run when triggered by an event 
in iCal. For example, you could have Automator send a file to your staff 
every day at 7:00 a.m. To make this work, create an iCal appointment 
and, in iCal, select the Run Script option in the event’s alarm menu. 
When the alarm triggers, iCal runs the selected workflow.
 ◗
Image Capture plug-in: Mac OS X includes Image Capture, an 
application to manage images from external devices like cameras and 
iOS devices. When you plug the devices into your Mac, you can use 
Image Capture to move, manage, and delete images on your Mac and 
the attached device. Using Automator you can automate this process by 
creating an Image Capture plug-in.
For the Web-resizing example, choose Workﬂ ow. 
The left pane in the main Automator window, shown in Figure 24-2, holds 
a list of Automator actions. Apple has assembled an exhaustive set of actions for 
a variety of contexts, such as managing contacts, changing ﬁ le names, and using 
iTunes. In addition to the Automator actions supplied by Apple, third-party 
developers have created actions you can install in Automator.  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce, for 
example, automatically installs several Automator actions that let you automate 
actions in the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce applications. 
The right side of the screen is where you build your Automator routines. Using 
Automator reminds me of playing with Lego blocks. The left side of the Automator 
screen is like the bucket of blocks and the right side is like your building mat. 
Creating an Automator workﬂ ow is no more difﬁ cult than ﬁ nding the correct 
blocks on the left side and then stacking them in the correct order on the right side.
Creating an  action
So let’s get back to the images. Create a new Automator project by choosing 
File ➧ New or pressing J+N. Then select Workﬂ ow from the settings sheet.
Before Automator can resize anything, it needs to ﬁ rst ﬁ nd the images. 
Automator actions that deal with ﬁ les are found in the Files & Folders list in 
www.ebook777.com

the left pane. Rather than digging through the lists of potential actions, you can 
search them out, if you know all or part of the action’s name: Click on the search 
window, indicated in Figure 24-2, and type Get Selected Finder Items. 
Automator will display the Get Selected Finder Items action for you. Click and 
drag the action onto the right side of the screen. You’ve just laid your ﬁ rst block.
Once you have the Get Selected Finder Items Action in your workﬂ ow, click 
Description so Automator opens a description of what the action does. In this 
case, it simply takes the selected Finder items and passes them to the next action.
So now that you have selected the items, what next? It’s time to resize. Type 
the word scale in the Automator search bar; the Scale Images action should 
appear in the left pane. Drag it onto your workﬂ ow. The screen should now look 
like that in Figure 24-3. The Scale Images action gives you the option to set the 
desired width of the images. Because these images will be published on the Web, 
set it to 400 pixels.
At this point, the Automator workﬂ ow has selected and resized the images. Just 
so there’s no confusion as to the fact that the images have been resized for the Web 
and are not the original versions, you should rename the resized images; here, add 
the words for Web at the end. To do so, type rename in the Automator search 
bar and drag the Rename Finder Items action to the workﬂ ow. This action gives 

www.ebook777.com

you several options: You can add a date or time, change the case, make ﬁ le names 
sequentially numbered, replace text, name a single item, or add text. In this case, 
let’s add text at the end of the resized image: Select Add Text and type the words 
for Web in the Add ﬁ eld. Finally, make certain the action knows to add the text 
after (as opposed to before) the ﬁ le name by selecting After Name in the Automator 
action. The ﬁ nal Automator workﬂ ow should look like that in Figure 24-4.
Now you’re ﬁ nished. Open the folder containing all the image ﬁ les. Select all 
the images with the mouse (or press J+A) and then switch to Automator. Press 
the Run iconic button in the toolbar and Automator will resize your images, 
lickety-split. When you’re done, you’ll have a folder full of resized, 400-pixel-wide 
images ready for publication to the Web.
Now let’s build an Automator service.
Creating a   service
A lot of Mac workers have more reading materials than they have time: You 
are ﬂ ooded with documents and extended e-mails that require reading. Let’s use 
Automator to take written text and convert it into an audio ﬁ le so you can listen 
to it on your iPod or iPhone during your commute.
This time, rather than make a workﬂ ow, you are going to create a service. 
Services let you to create a custom Automator script that resides in the contextual 

menu (activated when you Control+click or right-click an object). A service is 
always available, even when Automator is not running.
Create a new Automator project by choosing File ➧ New or pressing J+N. 
This time, instead of selecting Workﬂ ow in the settings sheet, select Service. The 
Automator window opens and should look like that in Figure 24-5.
This service is going to work on blocks of selected text, so Automator should 
be instructed that the service receives selected text from any application, as shown 
in Figure 24-5. 
The next step is to convert the selected text into an audio ﬁ le. Automator has 
an action for this called, not surprisingly, Text to Audio File. You can ﬁ nd this 
action using the Automator search bar. Locate the action and drag it onto your 
Automator service. Your screen should now look like that in Figure 24-6.
You have several options when converting text to an audio ﬁ le. First, 
you choose a voice. Mac OS X has several built-in computerized voices; the 
most natural-sounding voice is Alex. Several of the other voices, however, are 
entertaining; I particularly like Bruce and Zarvox. You can select various voices 
and press the Play button to get an example of each. 
Once you’ve chosen a voice, create a name for the ﬁ le. In this case, call it 
text2speech -. Include the hyphen at the end because the service will later 
add a time stamp (to avoid duplicate ﬁ le names). You can save the ﬁ le anywhere 
on your Mac. In the example, I’m putting it on the desktop. Your Automator 
window should now look like that in Figure 24-6.
At this stage, you have selected text, converted it to an audio ﬁ le, and saved it 
to the desktop. Next you need to add a date and time stamp. To do this, use two 
instances of the Rename Finder Items action covered in the previous section’s 
example of an image-resizing workﬂ ow. The ﬁ rst instance adds the date, and the 
second instance adds the time. 
Next, use the Import Audio Files action to convert the audio ﬁ le to the 
standard iTunes format, AAC. Search out the action and drag it onto your service. 
Finally, import the AAC audio ﬁ le into iTunes, using the Import Files into iTunes 
action. You can import the audio ﬁ le into an existing playlist or create a new one. 
(The example creates a new playlist called Text to Speech.) The completed service 
is shown in Figure 24-7. 
The service is completed. Now you just need to save it. Choose File ➧ Save or 
press J+S. Automator prompts you to provide a name for your new service; use 
Text to Speech. 
Now, test it. Open your e-mail application or Web browser and ﬁ nd a large 
block of text. Select the text with your mouse, then Control+click or right-click 
the selected text to open the contextual menu. In that menu, mouse down to the 
Services directory and choose the Text to Speech suboption. 
www.ebook777.com


As soon as you activate the service, Automator goes to work: It takes the 
selected text, converts it to an audio ﬁ le, renames it, converts it to AAC format, and 
brings it into iTunes in a matter of seconds. You can then synchronize that playlist 
to your iPod, iPhone, or iPad and listen to it on your ride home. I spend an hour a 
day commuting and get a lot of my “reading” done while behind the wheel.
If you don’t want to ﬁ ddle with Automator but still want the beneﬁ t of using 
services, there are many services available for download and installation on your 
Mac. The best resource is www.macosxautomation.com/services. 
Automator is amazing. You can, in essence, program your Mac without 
any  programming knowledge. It does, however, have its limits: Automator is 
linear. When creating more sophisticated computer programs, you can instruct 
the program to jump around and make decisions for you. Automator doesn’t 
work that way. It is more like an assembly line: You put a ﬁ le in one end, and 
something else comes out the other.
Automator is also limited by its available actions. Although third-party software 
developers and Apple are always adding actions to Automator, if your workﬂ ow 
needs a step for which there is no action, you’re probably out of luck. There is a way 
to create your own custom actions, but doing so requires programming knowledge 
of AppleScript (covered later) or one of the Unix shell scripting languages (such as 
Bash, Perl, Ruby, and Python), which goes beyond the scope of this book.
AppleScript
So what if you hit the wall of Automator’s limitations? In that case, it is 
time to step up your game and learn  AppleScript. AppleScript is a scripting 
language designed by Apple for Mac OS X. Unlike most  programming languages, 
AppleScript tries to use a natural-language model so commands are easier to 
understand.
You won’t learn AppleScript in an afternoon and a few pages of this book. 
Despite its simplicity, AppleScript is still a computer language, after all, and 
several lengthy books are published on mastering it. Nevertheless, let me give you 
a taste of AppleScript through a few AppleScript projects.
AppleScript Editor
AppleScript Editor, found in the Utilities folder of the Application folder on 
your Mac, is the built-in Mac OS X application for writing and executing scripts. 
Shown in Figure 24-8, the AppleScript editor has two panes. The top pane is 
where you type your AppleScript code. The bottom pane has two subpanes where 
you can display either a description of your AppleScript or an event log showing 
the results of your AppleScript.
www.ebook777.com

Some simple scripts
The idea behind AppleScript is to make it as comprehensible to 
nonprogrammers as possible. As a result, the syntax works largely with natural 
(English) language. For example, programming your computer to talk is normally 
a pretty complicated task. Not so with AppleScript. Type the following in the 
script editor:
say “I can be used for work”
Click the Compile iconic button in the toolbar. Then make sure the volume 
is turned up on your Mac and click the Run iconic button in the toolbar.
Guess what? You just wrote your ﬁ rst AppleScript. Let’s change the computer 
voice now. Type the following in the AppleScript Editor window, as shown in 
Figure 24-9.
say “shall we play a game?” using “Zarvox”
Now compile and run the script.
As you can see, AppleScript is more accessible to nonprogrammers than more 
traditional computing languages. 
As another example, if you want AppleScript to open your startup disk, type 
the following script.
tell application “Finder” to open the startup disk
Here is a more complex example:
set text_entry to “I like to use my Mac at work!”

display dialog “Ready to Script?”
tell application “TextEdit”
   activate
   make new document with properties {text:text_entry}
end tell
Taking the above example, let’s look at each line of AppleScript code to see 
what it does.
set text_entry to “I like to use my Mac at work!”
First, the script sets a variable called text_entry and ﬁ lls it with the words “I 
like to use my Mac at Work!”
display dialog “Ready to Script?”
Next, the script creates a dialog box.
tell application “TextEdit”
The tell command is how AppleScript works with speciﬁ c applications. In 
this instance, AppleScript is telling TextEdit, “I’m about to give you some work.”
   Activate
Activate is the AppleScript command to start the application. TextEdit will 
launch upon this command.
   make new document with properties {text:text_entry}
This is an example of AppleScript’s plain-language scripting. To make a new 
document, the command is make new document. The rest of this command 
adds the text from the text_entry variable to the new document.
www.ebook777.com

Finally, we tell TextEdit we are done working with it: 
end tell
Although these examples are admittedly simple, they do show the utility of 
AppleScript. Many Mac OS X software developers include AppleScript support 
in their software code, meaning that they include AppleScript commands in 
their software that AppleScript can address and thus you can access from an 
AppleScript you write. Apple Mail, for example, has an AppleScript command 
to pull an e-mail address from a mail message. (The command is Extract 
Address From.) This command is useful if you have 700 e-mails and want to 
pull their e-mail addresses and add them to an Address Book contact group. 
AppleScript includes a dictionary that lists all the available commands for 
your installed applications. You can access the dictionary in the AppleScript 
Editor by choosing File ➧ Open Dictionary. Figure 24-10, shows the Extract 
Address From entry in Mail’s AppleScript dictionary.
Once you become proﬁ cient in AppleScript, you can use the dictionary terms 
to string together AppleScript commands on your Mac. Because many software 
developers implement AppleScript commands, you can have applications talk 
to one another. For example, you can have Preview modify a photograph and 
then drop that image into a Microsoft Word document. Experienced scripters can 
perform magic on their Macs with AppleScript. 
You can even save bits of AppleScript code and install them as actions in 
Automator workﬂ ows. For example, to add voice prompts to your Automator 
workﬂ ows, use the Run AppleScript action in Automator, as shown in Figure 24-11. 
This is a useful script because there is no built-in Automator action to speak.
If you want the beneﬁ t of AppleScript but don’t want to be bothered to learn 
how, there are several useful scripts available on the Web that you can download 
and run in AppleScript Editor. Two of my favorite  AppleScript and Automator 
Web sites are www.macosxautomation.com and www.macscripter.net. 
Both sites have a rich assortment of downloadable AppleScripts and Automator 
Workﬂ ows. MacScripter also has an active user community, so you can get advice 
and help with your automation. 
Script Debugger
AppleScript Editor is a great tool to learn AppleScript, and it comes free with 
every new Mac. But if you really enjoy working with AppleScript, upgrade to a 
more advanced AppleScript editing application. The best one is  Script Debugger 
($200; www.latenightsw.com). Script Debugger includes tools not available 
in AppleScript Editor. Script Debugger’s dictionary support, for example, runs 
circles around the standard AppleScript Editor dictionary, providing more 

detailed information about the available commands in each of your applications, 
such as usage examples and syntax.
Script Debugger also lets you run your AppleScript code one step at a time 
so you know exactly what is going right (and wrong) when debugging. Script 
Debugger is a necessary tool for any power scripter.
Using Automator and AppleScript, you’ll be surprised how much more 
efﬁ cient you can be on your Mac. Good luck!

Debunking 
Debunking 
Myths about Macs
Myths about Macs
S
adly, many information technology professionals get this special frown 
on their faces when you show up at work with your Mac. I have a theory 
about this. I once spoke with an IT manager for a big company that had 
an equal number of Macs and PCs. He explained that his IT staff spent four times 
as much time keeping the PCs running as they did the Macs. In other words, 
computers that don’t break aren’t necessarily a good thing if you earn your living 
ﬁ xing computers. This, of course, is not fair to  IT professionals. Many are forward 
thinking and love Macs. Nevertheless, there are some common misconceptions 
you may hear from misguided IT professionals. Here are some of the most 
popular myths and how to debunk them.
Macs aren’t secure
Macs are secure. Mac OS X will not let you install and run new software 
without ﬁ rst entering your system password. Furthermore, because there are so 
few Mac OS X computers (in comparison with Windows), the rotten scoundrels 
who create malicious software largely ignore the Mac. Finally, there are several 
enterprise-friendly antivirus tools for the Mac. Read Chapter 23. Quite often, the 
real source of this myth is that IT workers — who deal with PC issues every day — 
are unsure of the Mac  security issues and how to address them. Their ignorance of 
Mac security issues makes them look worse than they actually are. 
Macs can’t be managed as easily as PCs
This is another myth born of unfamiliarity. Macs have built-in tools to play 
nicely on a network. They ship with  Exchange support (see Chapters 6, 7, and 
20) and they use the same  networking protocols as PCs. Macs can even run 
Windows software using  virtualization (see Chapter 22). If your IT person spends 
some time familiarizing herself with the tools available to manage a Mac on a 
predominantly PC network, there should be no problems.
Macs will slow down the network
This rumor predates Mac OS X. Over the years, Apple has released several 
networking protocols for its computers. Not all of them were efﬁ cient. AppleTalk, 
www.ebook777.com

for example, was notoriously slow. These outdated network conventions are all 
irrelevant now. Apple uses the same networking protocols as Windows and there 
is no difference between the network speed of the two operating systems. See 
Chapter 20.
Macs aren’t standards-compliant
“Standards” is such a nebulous term that this myth doesn’t mean anything. 
What standards are they talking about? The Mac can network with the rest of 
them (Chapter 20). Web browsers on the Mac can open any standards-compliant 
Web site, which is just about everything on the Internet these days (Chapter 4). 
Running a virtual machine or  Boot Camp, Macs can run Windows like a champ 
(Chapter 22). Macs support the standard PC interfaces such as USB,  Ethernet, 
Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth, and, via an adapter, VGA, as well as PC-formatted hard disks, 
CDs, ﬂ ash drives, and DVDs. It’s been more than 10 years since Macs came with 
proprietary interfaces.
Macs won’t work with  ActiveX
This myth is true. For a long time, Microsoft thought it could redeﬁ ne 
the Web experience by including its own speciﬁ c tools in Microsoft Explorer 
unavailable to other Web browsers, called ActiveX. This didn’t work and Microsoft 
has returned to using Web standards with recent versions of Microsoft Internet 
Explorer. Nevertheless, some antiquated Web sites still depend on ActiveX 
controls. Even Microsoft now encourages people to abandon these old sites and 
recode them for the modern standards-compliant Web browsers. If you must run 
these older Web sites, you can always install an old version of Internet Explorer 
using a virtual machine, assuming Microsoft will still support and release these 
older versions.
Macs are not PCs
PC stands for “personal computer.” Macs are PCs. It is just that they run 
Apple’s operating system, Mac OS X. Macs don’t run  Windows, unless you want 
them to. See Chapter 22.
Macs are expensive
This is the so-called “Apple tax.” People often compare an Apple laptop with 
other laptops that are about the same size and declare the Mac overpriced. When 
this happens, they never talk about the components inside the computers. It is 
like comparing a luxury car with an economy car. They both are about the same 
size but in no other way equal, including price. You can buy a PC for $300, but 
good luck getting any work done on it. When you compare a high-end Windows 

PC with a Mac, the features, components, and price are competitive. The difference 
is, Apple doesn’t make junk.
Smart businesses don’t buy the cheapest PCs because, in the long run, 
maintenance costs and down-time far exceed any perceived up front savings. 
Quality PCs with similar components to Macs are largely priced the same. 
This, combined with the lower management costs of Macs (the annual cost of 
managing a Windows PC is estimated to be about $2,000 per year), make the 
Macs cheaper in the long run.
Finally, this argument ignores the Mac’s lower cost of ownership. Macs usually 
last longer, have a higher resale value, and are less likely to break. Macs just work.
Macs don’t run Windows
Macs are better Windows PCs’ than most Windows PCs. See Chapter 22.
Macs don’t work with Exchange Server
Mac OS X Snow Leopard ships with Microsoft  Exchange support. Microsoft’s 
Outlook, part of  Microsoft Ofﬁ ce for Mac, also includes Microsoft Exchange 
support. See Chapters 6 and 20.
There are no work applications for the Mac
Although Mac OS X does not have the quantity of applications available 
to the Windows platform, the quality of Mac applications is amazing. Instruct 
anyone who spouts this myth to buy two copies of this book.
Macs are a fad. It’ll never last
The ﬁ rst Macintosh computer was sold on January 24, 1984. Apple reports 
selling more than 3 million Macs in the ﬁ rst quarter of 2010. Pretty good for fad!
The Mac is a toy, not a real computer
This rumor has a lot to do with the reason why I wrote this book. Somewhere 
along the line, the concept of the Mac as a toy entered the collective conscious. 
As you can see from this book, nothing could be farther from the truth. Your Mac 
can turn you into a productivity ninja if you give it a chance. 
This is the one Mac myth I usually don’t argue with. When an opposing 
lawyer sees my Mac and calls it a toy, I smile back serenely and then proceed to 
win my case with all the great tools covered in this book.
