Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume V

Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Introduction to volume V
Introduction to volume V,
The range of a function, Extrema of a Function in Several Vari-
ables
This is the ﬁfth volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables. Its topic is
dealing with the range of a functions, its global and local extrema.
Let f : A →R be a continuous function, where A ⊆Rm. We show that extrema of f can only exist
at either points in the interior of A, where f is not diﬀerentiable – also called exceptional points – or
at the so-called stationary points, i.e. points in the interior of A, where the gradient is 0 – or at the
points of the boundary of A also lying in A, i.e. in A ∩∂A. This eases the task a lot, though there
may still be problems.
One of the problems is that points of extrema, i.e. where f attains its maximum or minimum, do not
exist in general. However, if A is closed and bounded in Rm, then we prove that we always have both
a global maximum and a global minimum.
As usual the number of practical computations increase factorially with the dimension, so in practice
only the cases of two or three space variables are manageable. Even an innocent looking problem
like ﬁnding extrema for a second order polynomial in m variables over some closed and bounded set
A ⊂Rm may turn out to be a computational mess, if m is “large”. The author has experienced this
once for m = 7, and had to create an alternative solution method than the standard procedures given
in this book.
However, in R2 and R3 the calculations are in general moderate. In some cases MAPLE could help a
lot. On the other hand, the focus in this book has been to emphasize the possible methods, so most
of the examples are fairly simple, and it would seem to be too much to apply MAPLE on them.

The range of a function

The range of a function
16.1
Introduction
We shall in this chapter study the range of a function in n variables. We shall assume, unless stated
otherwise, that the function is continuous. This assumption immediately invites us to apply the main
theorems of continuous functions, which already have been quoted in Section 5.11.
We shall start with
Theorem 16.1 The ﬁrst main theorem of continuous functions. Assume that A ⊆Rn is connected,
and that f : A →Rm is continuous. Then the range f(A) is also connected.
In the special case, when m = 1, the range f(A) ⊆R becomes an interval. Depending on the deﬁnition
of f and A this range can be any type of interval, closed, half-open or open. We cannot derive more
from Theorem 16.1.
If f : A →R is continuous, while A is not connected, then we use that A can be decompose into
connected subsets,
A = A1 ∪· · · ∪Ak,
or
A = A1 ∪· · · ∪Ak ∪· · · ,
where all the Ak are connected sets which are mutually disjoint. Using Theorem 16.1 above, each
subrange f (Aj) is an interval, so in a general analysis we may without loss of generality from the very
beginning restrict ourselves to the case, where the domain A of f is connected.
The real axis R is ordered by the ordinary order relation ≤, and since A is connected, hence f(A) = I
an interval, we can introduce the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 16.1 Let A ⊂Rm be a connected set, and let f : A →R be a continuous function.
1) If there exists a point a ∈A, such that
f(a) ≤f(x)
for all x ∈A,
then the image f(a) of the point a is called the (global) minimum of f on A.
2) If there exists a point b ∈A, such that
f(x) ≤f(b)
for all x ∈A,
then the image f(b) of the point b is called the (global) maximum of f on A.
If f is continuous on the connected set A, and f has both a minimum f(a) and a maximum f(b) on
A, then it follows from the above that the range is the closed interval
f(A) = [f(a), f(b)].
Then we turn to

The range of a function
Theorem 16.2 The second main theorem of continuous functions. Assume that A ⊆Rm is a bounded
and closed set. If f : A →Rk is continuous, then the range f(A) ⊆Rk is also a bounded and closed
set.
Remark. Subsets in Rm, which are both bounded and closed are also called compact sets. The
old-fashioned term is used here, because “compact” is still not recognized everywhere. ♦
It follows from Theorem 16.2 that if f : A →R is continuous, and A is bounded and closed, then the
range f(A) is also bounded and closed, though not necessarily connected, if A is not connected. So
f(A) ⊆I, where I is the smallest bounded and closed interval, which contains f(A). In particular, the
two end points of I must belong to the range f(A), because otherwise we could ﬁnd a smaller interval
containing f(A). This means that f has both a minimum and a maximum, whenever f : A →R is
continuous on the bounded and closed set A into the set of real numbers R.
In the applications we may also be interested in local minima and maxima. A collective word for
minima and maxima is extrema. We shall in the following sections more closely study ﬁrst the global
extrema, and then the local extrema.
Since the reader may feel this topic diﬃcult, some examples in the text have been worked out in all
details, while the more standard treatment of examples is given in Chapter 17, because otherwise the
volume would be overwhelming.

The range of a function
16.2
Global extrema of a continuous function
16.2.1
A necessary condition
When we shall ﬁnd the smallest and largest value of a continuous function f : A →R, the strategy is
to split the domain A of f into four subdomains, and then consider the possibility of extrema in each
of them. In particular, it will turn up, that one of these subsets will never contain extrama. The four
sets are listed below:
1) The set As of stationary points. A point u ∈A◦(the interior of A) is called a stationary point of
f, if f is diﬀerentiable at u, and ▽f(u) = 0.
2) The set Ae of exceptional points. A point u ∈A◦iis called an exceptional point of f, if either f is
not diﬀerentiable at u, or it is too diﬃcult to check if it is diﬀerentiable at u.
3) The set ∂A of boundary points. This is just the ordinary boundary of the set A. It was introduced
in Section 1.5.1.
4) The set Ar of remaining points in A◦. This means that if u ∈Ar, then f is diﬀerentiable at u
and ▽f(u) = 0, so u is neither an exceptional nor a stationary point, and since u ∈A◦, it is not
a boundary point either.
Clearly, A ⊆As ∪Ae ∪∂A ∪Ar. Every point of A lies in one of the four subsets, while there may
be boundary points u ∈∂A, which do not belong to A.
Let us assume the u ∈Ar, so u ∈A◦and f is diﬀerentiable with ▽f(u) = 0. We let e denote the
unit vector in the direction of the gradient og f at u, i.e.
e :=
▽f(u)
 ▽f(u).
Then introduce the function
F(t) := f(u + te),
where u + te ∈A for |t| < δ, and F(0) = f(u).
We get by the chain rule,
F ′(0) = e · ▽f(u) =  ▽f(u) > 0,
so when we take the restriction of f to the line segment {u + te | |t| < δ}, this restriction (= F(t)) is
increasing in a neighbourhood of u. Therefore, on this line segment, f(u) can neither be a minimum
nor a maximum.
In other words, this simple argument shows that the set Ar does not contain any extremum, and we
have proved
Theorem 16.3 A necessary condition for global extrema. Assume that a function f : A →R, where
A ⊆Rm, has a global extremum at a point u ∈A. Then
u ∈As ∪Ae ∪∂A,
i.e. u is either a stationary point, or an exceptional point, or a boundary point.

The range of a function
Theorem 16.3 does not say anything about the existence of global extrema. It only gives some hints
of where to search for possible global extrema.
The set of stationary points As are found by solving the vector equation
▽f(u) = 0,
which we split into a system of m (in general nonlinear) equations in the m unknown coordinates. We
shall discuss this later on.
The set of exceptional points is in principle easy to spot, because it consists of the points, where f
either is not diﬀerentiable, or where it is very diﬃcult to prove whether it is diﬀerentiable or not. In
most of the simple applications, however, the set of exceptional points is either empty, or contains only
a ﬁnite number of points. If e.g. the square root occurs in the deﬁnition of f, then Ae may contain
even curves, so one cannot rule out Ae from the beginning.
Finally, concerning the investigation of the values of f on the boundary, we shall usually reduce the
problem to an m −1-dimensional case, because it is usually possible to eliminate one of the variables
on the boundary. This means that the restriction to ∂A is equivalent to a new problem with a new
continuous function f1 : A1 →R on a closed and bounded set A1 ⊂Rm−1 in a lower dimensional
space, and so we proceed.
In principle, this method should be possible, but . . . . If the dimension m is large - even for mod-
erate m this phenomenon occurs - the number of special cases, which require an inspection, may be
overwhelming. The author was once asked to ﬁnd the extrema of a squared function on a closed and
bounded set in R8. There were no exceptional points, and the possible stationary point was outside
the set A, so “only” the boundary ∂A remained. It turned up that it was consisting of ∼7! special
cases! The problem was solved in the end, but not by using the “standard procedure” described here.

The range of a function
16.2.2
The case of a closed and bounded domain of f
We shall then take a closer look on the problem. To ease matters, we shall assume the f : A →R is
continuous on a closed and bounded domain A ⊂Rm, in which case it follows from the second main
theorem, cf. Theorem 16.2, page 580, that f has both a global maximum and a global minimum on
A. It follows from the analysis in Section 16.2.1 that each of them belongs to one of the following
subsets of R,
Ts = {f(u) ∈R | u ∈A◦is a stationary point, ▽f(u) = 0} ,
Te = {f(u) ∈R | f is not diﬀentiable at u ∈A◦} ,
Tb = {f(u) | u ∈∂A}.
Usually As and Ae only contain a ﬁnitely many points from A◦, if any, so we just insert these points
and compare the sizes of their values.
Also, usually the restriction of the function to the boundary ∂A is in practice reduced to a function in
m −1 variables, so in principle we have a new situation of a continuous function f1 : A1 →R, where
A1 ⊂Rm−1 is closed and bounded. Then the investigation starts from the beginning, where we must
ﬁnd stationary and exceptional points in A1 for this new function f1, and we also get a new boundary
∂A1.
In this way we proceed m −1 times, until we get the restriction written as a continuous function
fm−1 : Am−1 →R, where Am−1 ⊂R is 1-dimensional and closed and bounded, and the problem is
reduced to a high school problem.
Needless to say, that concerning global extrema on a closed and bounded set A ⊂Rm, the investigation
of the boundary is usually the biggest task.
The use of the word “usually” above does not imply that it is always so. One may construct extremum
problems where either the stationary points or the exceptional points require a lot of work.
In order to get some feeling of this theory we shall in the following start with only considering m = 2,
so f : A →R is from now on a continuous function on a closed and bounded plane set A ⊂R2, where
we use the rectangular coordinates (x, y) ∈A.
Let (x, y) ∈A◦be a point, where f is diﬀerentiable, If is a stationary point, then we must have
▽f(x, y) = 0, i.e. in coordinates,
f ′
x(x, y) = 0
and
f ′
y(x, y) = 0.
In order to ﬁnd all stationary points we shall solve this system of (usually nonlinear) two equations in
the two variables x and y. There is no standard method for doing this, and the problem is in general
hard to solve. However, a couple of guidelines may be useful.
1) If one or both of the left hand sides of the equations can be factorized, then we can reduce the
problem considerably. In fact, the left hand side is zero, if and only if at least one of its factors is
zero, so we split the investigation into a number of simpler problems, putting each of the factors
equal to zero and then solving the simpler systems. Due to this potential possibility one should
never multiply the factors on the left hand side, when they occur from the beginning. By doing
this one shall lose some information.
2) Another possibility occurs, when we can eliminate one of the variables, x or y. In this case we obtain
one (usually nonlinear) equation in only one variable. This is solved by some known procedure,
e.g. by a factorization, by guessing a root, by a graphical consideration, or by an application of
the Newton-Raphson iteration formula.

The range of a function
Concerning the investigation of the values of the function f on the boundary ∂A ⊂R2, where A is
closed and bounded, we note that in most of the applications in practice, the boundary ∂A is a closed
piecewise C1-curve, or a union of such piecewise C1-curves. The simplest case occurs of course, when
∂A is a closed curve, given by a parametric description (cf. e.g. Volume IV in this series),
(x, y) = (X(t), Y (t))
for t ∈[a, b],
where X(t) and Y (t) are given functions. In this case the restriction of f to the boundary ∂A is
described by the (new) ordinary function
g(t) := f(X(t), Y (t)),
for t ∈[a, b],
in one variable. This method is also applied, when ∂A is broken up into pieces where we can use a
parametric description, although this piece does not have to be a closed curve in the plane.
It should here be added that the reader should never believe that the methods described above are
the only possibilities of methods in these extremum problems. If we by some other method, e.g. by
inspection, can ﬁnd the range [c, d], there is of course no need at all to go through all the procedures
described above, because then we already have that
min
u∈A f(u) = c
and
max
u∈A f(u) = d.
The exception is of course, when we also want to know where these extrema are attained.
In order to show how the theory above is applied in practice in R2 we proceed with some worked out
examples.
Example 16.1
A Let A be a closed and bounded (i.e. compact) subset of the plane where the boundary ∂A is a closed
curve of the parametric representation
r(t) =

,
t ∈[0, 1].
Find the maximum and minimum in A for the C∞-function
f(x, y) = x3 + y3 −3xy,
(x, t) ∈A.
D Standard procedure:
1) Sketch the domain A and apply the second main theorem for continuous functions, from which
we conclude the existence of a maximum and a minimum.
2) Identify the exceptional points in A◦, if any, and calculate the values f(x, y) in these points.
3) Set up the equations for the stationary points; ﬁnd these – which quite often is a fairly diﬃcult
task, because the system of equations is usually nonlinear. Finally, compute the values f(x, y)
in all stationary points.
4) Examine the function on the boundary, i.e. restrict the function f(x, y) to the boundary and
repeat the investigation above to a set which is of lower dimension. Then ﬁnd the maximum
and minimum on the boundary.

5) Collect all the candidates for a maximum and a minimum found previously in 2)–4). Then the
maximum S and the minimum M are found by a simple numerical comparison.
Remark 16.1 Note that by using this method there is no need to use the complicated (r, s, t)-
method, which will be described later and which should only be applied when we shall ﬁnd local
extrema in the plane. Here we are dealing with global maxima and minima in a set A. ♦
Remark 16.2 Sometimes it is alternatively easy to identify the level curves f(x, y) = c for the
function f. In such a case, sketch a convenient number of the level curves, from which it may be
easy to ﬁnd the largest and the smallest constant c, for which the corresponding level curve has
points in common with the set A. Then these values of c are automatically the maximum S, resp.
the minimum M for f on A.
Note, however, that this alternative method is demanding some experience before one can use it
as a standard method of solution. It has once been used with success by a brilliant student at an
examination. ♦
I The level curves f(x, y) = x3 + y3 −3xy = c do not look to promising, so we stick to the standard
procedure.
1) The domain A has already been sketched.
Since A is closed and bounded, and f(x, y) is
continuous on A, it follows from the second main theorem for continuous functions that the
function f has a maximum and a minimum on the set A.
2) Since f is of class C∞in A◦, there are no exceptional points.
3) The stationary points satisfy the two equations
∂f
∂x
=
3x2 −3y = 0,
i.e.
y = x2,
∂f
∂y
=
3y2 −3x = 0,
i.e.
x = y2.
When we look at the graph we obtain the two solutions:
(0, 0) ∈∂A
and
(1, 1) ∈A◦.

Figure 16.2: The stationary points are the intersections between the curves y = x2 and x = y2.
Alternatively one inserts y = x2 into the second equation
0 = y2 −x = x4 −x = x(x3 −1) = x(x −1)(x2 + x + 1).
Here x2 + x + 1 has only complex roots, hence the only real roots are x = 0 (with y = x2 = 0)
and x = 1 (with y = x2 = 1), corresponding to
(0, 0) ∈∂A
and
(1, 1) ∈A◦.
Since (0, 0) is a boundary point, we see that (1, 1) ∈A◦is the only stationary point for f in A◦.

At the end points of the interval, t = 0 and t = 1, we get
g(0) = g(1) = f(0, 0) = 0.
5) We collect all the candidates:
exceptional points:
None,
[from 2)]
Stationary point:
f(1, 1) = −1,
[from 3)]
Boundary points:
f(0, 0) = 0 and f(2, 2) = 4,
[from 4)].
By a numerical comparison we get
• The minimum is f(1, 1) = −1 (a stationary point),
• The maximum is f(2, 2) = 4 (a boundary point).
6) A typical addition: Since A is connected, and f is continuous, it also follows from the ﬁrst main
theorem for continuous functions, that the range is an interval (i.e. connected), hence
f(A) = [M, S] = [−1, 4].

D. Even if the rewriting of the function
f(x, y) = (x2 + y2)2 + 2x2y2 −4(x3 + y3)
looks reasonably nice it is still not tempting to apply an analysis of the level curves f(x, y) = c, so
we shall again use the standard method as described in the previous example, to which we refer
for the description.
I. 1) The domain A has been sketched already. Since A is closed and bounded, and f(x, y) is contin-
uous on A, it follows from the second main theorem for continuous functions that f(x, y) has
a maximum and a minimum on A.

The range of a function
While we are dealing with theoretical considerations we may aside mention that since A is
obviously connected, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous functions that the
range is connected, i.e. an interval, which necessarily is given by
f(A) = [M, S].
2) Since f(x, y) is of class C∞, there is no exceptional point.
3) The stationary points (if any) satisﬁes the system of equations
0
=
∂f
∂x = 4x3 + 8xy2 −12x2 = 4x(x2 + 2y2 −3x),
0
=
∂f
∂y = 8x2y + 4y3 −12y2 = 4y(2x2 + y2 −3y).
Note that it is extremely important to factorize the expressions as much as possible in order to
solve the system. In fact, when this is done, we can reduce the system to
∂f
∂x = 0 :
x = 0
or
x2 + 2y2 −3x = 0,
∂f
∂y = 0 :
y = 0
or
2x2 + y2 −3y = 0.
These conditions are now paired in 2 · 2 = 4 ways which are handled one by one.
a) When x = 0 and y = 0, we get (0, 0) ∈A◦, i.e. (0, 0) is a stationary point with the value of
the function
f(0, 0) = 0.
b) When x = 0 and 2x2 + y2 −3y = 0, we get
0 + y2 −3y = y(y −3) = 0,
hence y = 0 or y = 3.
Thus, we have two possibilities: (0, 0) ∈A◦, which has already been found previously, and
(0, 3) /∈A, so this point does not participate in the competition. We therefore do not get
further points in this case.
c) When y = 0 and x2 + 2y2 −3x = 0, we get by an interchange of letters (x, y) →(y, x) that
the candidates are (0, 0) ∈A◦[found previously] and (3, 0) /∈A. Hence we get no further
point in this case.
d) It still remains the last possibility
x2 + 2y2 −3x = 0
and
2x2 + y2 −3y = 0.
From the rewriting (cf. e.g. Linear Algebra)

2
and
2x2 +

it is seen that the stationary points are the intersections of the two ellipses. It follows from
the symmetry that the points must lie on the line y = x. By eliminating y we get
0 = x2 + 2y2 −3x = 3x2 −3x = 3x(x −1).
Hence we get either x = 0, corresponding to (0, 0) ∈A◦[found previously] or x = 1
corresponding to (1, 1) ∈A◦, which is a new candidate with the value
f(1, 1) = 1 + 4 + 1 −4 −4 = −2.

function
f(0, 0) = 0
and
f(1, 1) = −2.

4) The boundary. The simplest version is the following alternative to the standard procedure: A
parametric representation of the boundary curve is
(x, y) = r(ϕ) = (2 cos ϕ, 2 sin ϕ),
ϕ ∈[0, 2π],
(possibly ϕ ∈R),
where we note that

If we put g(ϕ) = f(r(ϕ)), where
f(x, y) = x4 + 4x2y2 + y4 −4x3 −4y3,
then we get by the chain rule, that the maximum and the minimum on the boundary should
be searched among the points on the boundary
x2 + y2 = 4,

the maximum is

and that both the minimum and the maximum are lying on the boundary.
6) Finally, we get from 1) that due to the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous functions the range
is the interval
f(A) = [M, S] = [−16, 48].

2) Since the square root is not diﬀerentiable at 0, it follows that (0, 0) is an exceptional point! We

Since (0, 0) is an exceptional point, we must have y = 0 for any stationary point. When we

D. Here it is far too diﬃcult directly to ﬁnd the level curves, so we apply the standard procedure as
described previously.
I. 1) We ﬁrst sketch A. Since f(x, y) is continuous on the closed and bounded triangle A (note in
particular that 1 + 4xy > 0), it follows from the second main theorem for continuous functions
that f(x, y) has both a maximum S and a minimum M on A. Since A is also connected, it
follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous functions that the range is connected, i.e.

f(A) = [M, S].
2) Since f everywhere in A◦is of class C∞, it follows that f(x, y) has no exceptional point.
3) The stationary points, if any, must satisfy the equations

1 + 4xy = 0,
i.e.
8y = 1 + 4xy
and
8x = 3(1 + 4xy).
When 1 + 4xy > 0 is eliminated we get 8x = 3 · 8y, from which x = 3y, which is a condition
that the stationary points necessarily must satisfy.
By insertion of x = 3y we get

16.2.3
The case of a bounded but not closed domain of f
Consider a continuous function f : A →R, where the domain A ⊂Rm is bounded, but not closed.
Then we cannot apply the second main theorem and we cannot conclude that f has extrema on A.
Indeed, it is easy to give examples, when this is not the case.
When we analyze this case, we ﬁrst check if f has a continuous extension f : A →R to the closure A of
A, i.e. f is continuous, and f(u) = f(u) for all u ∈A. In this case we just apply the methods described
previously in Section 16.2.2, because due to the second main theorem, f has both a minimum and a
maximum on A, so we ﬁnd these and then check, if they are also attained at points in A.
We elaborate a little on this. Assume that the continuous extension f : A →R exists, and let the
(global) extrema be
f(u) = f min,
and
f(v) = f max.
Clearly, if u ∈A, then f min is also a global minimum for f, because A is a smaller set than A.

The range of a function
Similarly, if v ∈A, then f max is also a global maximum for f.
Then we turn to the case, when u ∈A \ A. Just note that due to the continuity of f we can to every
ε > 0 ﬁnd a point uε ∈A, such that
f(u) = f min < f (uε) < fmin + ε,
which shows that we inside A can get as close to the value fmin as we want without ever reaching this
value.
Similarly, if v ∈A \ A, where we to every ε > 0 can ﬁnd vε ∈A, such that
f max −ε < f (vε) < f max = f(v),
which shows that we inside A can get as close to the value fmax as we want without ever reaching
this value.
Example 16.5
Let A be the open triangle
A = {(x, y) | 0 < x < 1, −x < y < 4x},
and let the function f(x, y) on A be given by
f(x, y) = 2xy + 3 ln(1 −x),
(x, y) ∈A.
Find the range f(A).

The range of a function
Although the expression looks very complicated, it is actually possible to analyze these level curves.
The reader is referred to section I 2 below which, however, may be considered a bit advanced for
a common use.
We therefore start with the standard procedure in section I 1 with some necessary modiﬁcations.
First we exploit the theoretical main theorems as much as possible. Then we extend f to the parts
of the boundary where it is possible, and we discuss what happens at the boundary points where
such a continuous extension of f is not possible.
We see that both methods have a common theoretical start, which we here call section I.
I. Since f(x, y) is continuous on the connected set A, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for
continuous functions that the range f(A) is connected, i.e. an interval.
Since A is bounded, though not closed, we cannot apply the second main theorem for continu-
ous functions. We shall ﬁrst check whether f(x, y) has a continuous extension to (parts of) the
boundary of A or not.
It follows immediately that f(x, y) can be continuously extended to the lines
y = 4x
and
y = −x,
x ∈[0, 1[,
with the same formal expression of the function, i.e. the extension is given by
f(x, y) = 2xy + 3 ln(1 −x)
for 0 ≤x < 1,
−x ≤y ≤4x.
On the other hand, we cannot extend to the vertical line x = 1, because
lim
x→1−f(x, y) = 2y + 3 lim
x→1−ln(1 −x) = −∞.
However, we see that the lower bound is −∞, so f(A) must be a semi-inﬁnite, i.e. either ] −∞, a[
or ] −∞, a], because the theorems do not assure that the upper bound a actually belongs to f(A).
This question can only be decided by an explicit analysis.
It follows that we shall only search the maximum in
B = {(x, y) | 0 ≤x < 1, −x ≤y ≤4x}.
Since we also have f(x, y) →−∞for x →1−, in B, there exists an ε ∈]0, 1[, such that
f(x, y) < S
for (x, y) ∈B and 1 −ε ≤x < 1.
The maximum S is therefore attained in the closed and bounded and truncated domain
Bε = {(x, y) | 0 ≤x ≤1 −ε, −x ≤y ≤4x},
where we of course assume that S exists and S < +∞.
This follows, however, from the second main theorem for continuous functions, applied on Bε.
Since we only want to ﬁnd the maximum, the standard procedure is hereafter the same as for closed
and bounded domains. The only modiﬁcation is that we shall not go through an investigation of
the boundary on the line x = 1 −ε.

The range of a function
I 1. Standard procedure.
1) We have already sketched a ﬁgure and quoted and applied the second main theorem.
2) Since f(x, y) belongs to the class C∞in A, there is no exceptional point.
3) The stationary points in A, if any, must satisfy the equations
∂f
∂x = 2y −
3
1 −x = 0
and
∂f
∂y = 2x = 0.
It follows from the latter equation that x = 0; but since x > 0 in A, we see that we have no
stationary point in A for the function f.
4) Modiﬁed investigation of the boundary.
a) For y = 4x we get the restriction

is deﬁned in the strip 0 < x < 1 as the graph of a function. If c = 0, then both x = 0 and x = 1
are asymptotes. It follows that
lim
x→1−ϕc(x) = +∞
for all c ∈R,
and that
lim
x→0+ ϕc(x) = +∞
for c > 0,
and
lim
x→0+ ϕc(x) = −∞
for c < 0.
The curves are characterized by f(x, y) being constant c along y = ϕc(x). We have sketched two
level curves on the ﬁgure (where c > 0), from which it is seen that the curves “move upwards”,
when c increases.
Hence we are looking for the biggest c, for which y = ϕc(x) just is contacting the boundary of B
without intersecting B. This is not possible for c < 0, and at the same time we get the line y = −x
excluded. Thus the maximum can only lie on the line y = 4x. Since y = ϕc(x) only touches this
line, the following two conditions must be fulﬁlled:
1) The curves must go through the same point, i.e. y = 4x = ϕc(x), or
4x = −1
2x {−c + 3 ln(1 −x)},
from which
−c + 3 ln(1 −x) = −8x2.
2) The curves must have the same slope at this point, i.e.

0 = 16x2(1 −x) −3x = x{16x −16x2 −3} = −x(4x −1)(4x −3).

If f : A →R does not have a continuous extension to the closure A, then either f is bounded on A,
or unbounded on A. We ﬁrst give an example, when f is bounded on A without having a continuous
extension to all of A.
Example 16.6 A nasty example which usually is not given in any textbook, is given by the following.
It also illustrates that the usual division into cases in most textbooks is not exhaustive.

and we see that f(x, y) has no continuous extension to any point on the boundary.

The range of a function
from which we conclude that f has neither a maximum nor a minimum in the open set A.
However, since f(x, y) is continuous on the connected set A, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem
for continuous functions that f(A) also is connected, i.e. an interval.
According to 1) the function f(x, y) attains values smaller than 1, though we can get as close to 1 as
we wish.
According to 2) the function f(x, y) attains values bigger than −1, though we can get as close to −1
as we wish.
Hence we conclude that the range is given by
f(A) = ] −1, 1[.
♦
Then turn to the case, when f is unbounded on A. Then either we can ﬁnd a sequence un ∈A, such
that f (un) →−∞for n →+∞, or a sequence vn ∈A, such that f (vn) →+∞for n →+∞. In
order to show, what we have in mind, we include the following example.

The range of a function
Example 16.7 Let A denote the open triangle on Figure 16.12, i.e. A is described by the inequalities
0 < x < 1 and −x < y < 4x.
Figure 16.12: The domain A is the open triangle. The function can be continuously extended to the
solid line segments.
Consider the function on A deﬁned by
f(x, y) = 2xy + 3 ln(1 −x)
for (x, y) ∈A.
First note that since A is connected, and f is continuous on A, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem
for continuous functions that the range of f is connected, hence an interval.
Due to the logarithmic term, f(x, y) →−∞, when (x, y) ∈A and x →1−. This shows that f does
not have a global minimum, and that the range has −∞as its left endpoint.
Then f has no exceptional points in A, because f is diﬀerentiable everywhere in the open set A.
If there are stationary points, these must satisfy the equations
∂f
∂x = 2y +
−3
1 −x = 0
and
∂f
∂y = 2x = 0.
It follows immediately that x = 0 and then by insertion that y = 3
2, so the only candidate of a
stationary point is

0, 3
2

. Since this point lies outside A, there are no stationary points either.
Summarizing, there are no exceptional points, no stationary points, and no boundary points in A, so
f cannot have any extremum.
Then a simple estimate shows that
f(x, y) = 2xy + 3 ln(1 −x) ≤2 · 1 · 4 + 3 · 0 = 11,
so f is bounded from above. Therefore, f(A) = ] −∞, c[ for some ﬁnite c. This value c can only be
attained for the continuous extension f to the parts of the boundary (indicated by solid lines), which
is not lying on the vertical line x = 1.

The range of a function
We note for later use that at the vertex f(0, 0) = 0.
Fix 0 < x < 1 and let y ∈[−x, 4x] vary, i.e. we consider the restriction
gx(y) = 2xy + 3 ln(1 −x) ≤8x2 + 3 ln(1 −x)
for x ∈[−x, 4x],
where the equality sign is obtained for y = 4x. This means that the value c is attained at the half
open line segment y = 4x, 0 ≤x < 1. Therefore, we introduce
ϕ(x) := 8x2 + 3 ln(1 −x),
for 0 ≤x < 1.
We get by a diﬀerentiation,
ϕ′(x) = 16x −

The case of an unbounded domain of f
To avoid unnecessary irrelevant complications we shall for simplicity in this section only consider
continuous functions f : Rm →R, deﬁned on all of Rm. The topic is diﬃcult to describe in all details,
so we shall only give a couple of guidelines concerning the question of existence of extrema in this
case, where these guidelines may be useful in the applications.
1. If we can deﬁne a restriction of the function (to e.g. a simple curve, or just a straight line), such that
the values f(u) of this restriction tend to +∞, when u →+∞, then f has no global maximum.
Similarly, if f(u) of this restriction tend to −∞, when u →+∞, then f has no global minimum.
We shall illustrate this by the following example.

Let B denote the set of all stationary points and all exceptional points joined together, and let the
restriction of f to the set B have the global maximum f B
max and the global minimum f B
min.
Usually (in the cases met in practice) B only consists of a ﬁnite number of points, so it is easy by a
numerical comparison to ﬁnd the numbers f B
max and f B
min.
Using the assumption that the domain is Rm it follows that the boundary is the empty set. Then it
is easy to conclude the following
2a If there is a point u ∈Rm, such that f(u) > f B
max, then f has no global maximum.
2b If there is a point u ∈Rm, such that f(u) < f B
min, then f has no global minimum.
Finally, we assume that the limit
lim
u→+∞f(u) = L
exists, where we also allow the inﬁnite values, L = ±∞. Then we get
3a If L < f B
min, then f has no global minimum. Its global maximum is f B
max, and its range is

Example 16.9 Consider the function
f(x, y) = x4 + 4x2y2 + y4 −4x3 −4y3

In the latter case we get by subtraktion,
y2 −x2 + 3y −3x = (y −x)(y + x + 3) = 0,
so either y = x or y = −x −3.
In the former case we get by insertion 3x2 −3x = 0, so either x = 1 or x = 0, and the stationary
points are (0, 0) and (1, 1).

The range of a function
Summing up we have found the stationary points B = {(0, 0), (1, 1), (3, 0), (0, 3)}, and the values in
these points are
f(0, 0, ) = 0,
f(1, 1) = −2,
f(3, 0) = f(0, 3) = −27.
Hence, in the chosen notation,
f B

Local extrema of a continuous function
16.3.1
Local extrema in general
We investigated in the previous section the global range of a given continuous function f : A →R,
where A ⊆Rm. We shall in this section consider the local properties of f, i.e. if f has a local extremum
at a given point x0 ∈A.
We introduce the increment of a function. This is deﬁned as
∆f (= ∆f (x; x0)) = f(x) −f (x0) ,
where x0 ∈A is the point under consideration, and x ∈A is the variation from x0.

The range of a function
Deﬁnition 16.2 Given a continuous function f : A →R, where A ⊆Rm, and a ﬁxed point x0 ∈A.
1) Maximum. If there is a δ > 0, such that for all x ∈A satisfying 0 < x −x0 < δ,
f(x) ≤f (x0) ,
i.e. ∆f ≤0,
we call f (x0) a maximum at x0 ∈A.
2) Proper maximum. If there is a δ > 0, such that for all x ∈A satisfying 0 < x −x0 < δ,
f(x) < f (x0) ,
i.e. ∆f < 0,
we call f (x0) a proper maximum at x0 ∈A.
3) Minimum. If there is a δ > 0, such that for all x ∈A satisfying 0 < x −x0 < δ,
f(x) ≥f (x0) ,
i.e. ∆f ≥0,
we call f (x0) a minimum at x0 ∈A.
4) Proper minimum. If there is a δ > 0, such that for all x ∈A satisfying 0 < x −x0 < δ,
f(x) > f (x0) ,
i.e. ∆f > 0,
we call f (x0) a proper minimum at x0 ∈A.
When one considers a graph of a function, Deﬁnition 16.2 surely makes sense. It also follows imme-
diately from this deﬁnition that we have the following theorem.
Theorem 16.4 Let x0 ∈A be a point in the domain of the continuous function f : A →R. If for
every δ > 0 the increment ∆f has both positive and negative values in any set of the form A ∩B (x0, δ),
where B (x0, δ) denotes the open ball of centre x0 ∈A and radius δ > 0, then f does not have a (local)
extremum at x0.
If we restrict the given function f : A →R to the set A ∩B (x0, δ) for δ > 0 suﬃciently small, it
follows from the results in Section 16.2 that we also have
Theorem 16.5 A necessary condition for local extremum. If the continuous function f : A →R,
where A ⊆Rm, has a local extremum at the point x0 ∈A◦, then x0 is either a stationary point or an
exceptional point.
Note that Theorem 16.5 only gives a necessary, and not a suﬃcient condition.
There may exist
e.g. stationary points (saddle points) which are not extremum points. We shall later return to this
problem.
Example 16.10 In this example we produce some functions in R2, which all have (0, 0) as a stationary
point and value zero.
We supply the investigation with sketches of the graphs and discussions of the sign of the function in
the neighbourhood whenever this is necessary. Concerning the graphs the reader is also referred to
Linear Algebra.

minimum.
3) z = f3(x, y) = x3 + y3 = (x + y)(x2 −xy + y2).
Since x3 + y3 is of odd degree 3, we take e.g. the restriction of f3 to the x-axis,
f3(x, 0) = x3
(is both > and < 0 in any open neighbourhood of x = 0),
so f3 has no extremum at (0, 0).
This can also be seen by analyzing the sign of the function. In fact, x2 −xy + y2 ≥0 for all (x, y),
thus x3 + y3 is everywhere of the same sign as x + y.
4) z = f4(x, y) = x2 −y2 = (x + y)(x −y).
The graph is a hyperbolic paraboloid. There is no extremum at (0, 0).
An analysis of the sign shows that f4(x, y) is 0 on the lines x + y = 0 and x −y = 0, and that
f4(x, y) attains both positive and negative values in any neighbourhood of (0, 0).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The range of a function
Example 16.11
A. Examine whether the function
f(x, y, z) = exp

xy + z2
has a local extremum or not.
D. Here we shall not use the standard procedure but instead we suggest an alternative method. In
fact, since exp is strictly increasing, the functions
ϕ(x, y, z) = xy + z2
and
f(x, y, z) = exp(ϕ(x, y, z))
must have the same stationary points and extrema.
We therefore examine the simpler function ϕ(x, y, z).
I. The equations for the stationary points for ϕ(x, y, z) are
∂ϕ
∂x = y = 0,
∂ϕ
∂y = x = 0,
∂ϕ
∂z = 2z.
Hence it follows immediately that (0, 0, 0) is the only stationary point. An analysis of the sign of
the restriction
ϕ(x, y, 0) = xy
to the plane z = 0 shows that ϕ(x, y, 0) attains both positive and negative values in any neigh-
bourhood of (0, 0, 0), thus (0, 0, 0) is not an extremum for ϕ, and therefore neither for f. ♦
16.3.2
Application of Taylor’s formula
In most cases in the applications we may without loss of generality assume that f : A →R is a
C2-function. If so, then it follows from Taylor’s formula, cf. also Section 9.5, that
∆f = df + 1
2 d2f + ε(h)h2,
with x0 as expansion point and x = x0 + h.
We shall in this section derive the so-called (r, s, t)-method in the 2-dimensional case, i.e. when A ⊆R2.
If x0 is a stationary point of f, i.e. if ▽f (x0) = 0, then clearly df = 0, so at a stationary point the
increment becomes
δf = 1
2 d2f + ε(h)h2,
where ε(h) →0 for h →0. It is usually not very diﬃcult to calculate d2f, so for small h we get
an idea of the variation of the increment ∆f.
Assume that the chosen point x0 = (u, v) ∈A ⊆R2 is a stationary point, and put h := h and
h = (hx, hy) = (h cos ϕ, h sin ϕ).

For every ﬁxed h > 0 we let ω(h) denote the maximum of the continuous function
gh(ϕ) := |ε(h cos ϕ, h sin ϕ)|,
for ϕ ∈[0, 2π].
This maximum exists, because [0, 2π] is a closed and bounded interval. Then we get
|ε(h)| ≤ω(h)
for all ϕ,
and
ω(h) →0 for h →0 + .
We then introduce the following standard notation for C2-functions in R2 at the stationary point
(u, v),
r := f ′′
xx(u, v),
s := f ′′
xy(u, v),
and
t := f ′′
yy(u, v).
Since
cos2 ϕ = 1 + cos 2ϕ

(r + t)2 −4 (rt −s2),
and there exists an angle ψ ∈[0, 2π], such that the vector is written

so writing the coordinates,
r −t = K cos ψ
and
2s = K sin ψ.

The range of a function
where
F(ϕ) = r + t + K cos(2ϕ −ψ),
for ϕ ∈[0, 2π].
Since cosine has the range [−1, 1], and K > 0, we conclude that F has the range
[r + t −K, r + t + K],
where K =

(r + t)2 −4 (rt −s2).
We put for short α := r + t −K and β := r + t + K, so the range of F is [α, β].
1) If α = r + t −K > 0, then we can ﬁnd h0 > 0, such that ω(h) < 1
4 α for h < h0. This implies that
4|ε(h)| < α for h < h0, and hence
∆f ≥1
4 h2{α + 4ε(h)} > 0
for 0 < h < h0,
proving that f has a proper minimum at the stationary point (u, v).
2) If β := r + t + K < 0, we just copy the argument above and conclude that for some h0 > 0,
∆f ≤1
4 h2{β + 4ε(h)} < 0
for 0 < h < h0,
proving that f has a proper maximum at the stationary point (u, v).
3) If α < 0 < β, then ∆f is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of x0, so x0 is not a
point of extremum in this case.
4) Finally, if either α = 0, or β = 0, then there exists a ϕ0 ∈[0, 2π], such that F (ϕ0) = 0, and
the sign of ∆f is then determined by the function ε(h), which in this crude analysis is not under
control. Hence, we cannot by this method alone decide, whether we have a local extremum at x0
or not.
We deﬁned previously,
K =

(r + t)2 −4 (rt −s2),
α = r = r + t −K
and
β = r + t + K.
We shall go through the possibilities above and translate the results to only involving r, s and t.
1) Since α > 0, if and only if r + t > K, this inequality is equivalent to
rt > s2
and
r > 0 and t > 0,
in which case we have a proper minimum.
2) Similarly, β < 0, if and only if r + t < −K, i.e. if and only if
rt > s2
and
r < 0 and t < 0.
3) Then α < 0 < β, if and only id −K < r + t < K, i.e. if and only if
rt < s2.
4) Finally, α = 0, or β = 0, if and only if |r + t|K, i.e. if and only if
rt = s2.

Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume V

The range of a function
Theorem 16.6 above is the traditional way of tackling the question of local extrema for C2-functions
in two variables. It is not one of the author’s favourites, because it is so easy to make errors, when one
applies it. But since it is commonly used, it has for completeness been described here. One common
pitfall is that one forgets to check, if the point (u, v) really is a stationary point. If it is not, then
the ﬁrst order terms become dominating over the second order terms, which actually are lying behind
the (r, s, t)-method. Therefore, Theorem 16.6 can only be applied to points, which we know are also
stationary points.
No matter the author does not like this method, there are of course given some examples below of its
application.
Example 16.12
A. In Example 16.10 it was shown that the function
f(x, y) = x4 + 4x2y2 + y4 −4x3 −4y3,
(x, y) ∈R2,
has the stationary points
(0, 0),
(1, 1),
(3, 0),
and
(0, 3).
Examine whether these points are also extrema.
D. This is an example where the (r, s, t)-method is of no use at the point (0, 0). This illustrates that
the mechanical (r, s, t)-method is not a universal method, which can handle all cases. We shall
therefore here use the alternative method of the approximating polynomials. This is in general far
better than the (r, s, t)-method, although this is not a universal method either.
Remark 16.4 Aside! None of the two methods above can solve the same problem of extrema
for the function
g(x, y) = exp

−
1
x2 + y2

for (x, y) = (0, 0),
supplied by continuity with g(0, 0) = 0.
It can be proved by using diﬀerence quotients that
g ∈C∞(R2) and that
g(n)
xkyn−k(0, 0) :=
∂ng
∂xk∂yn−k (0, 0) = 0
for all n ∈N0 and 0 ≤k ≤n,
so every approximating polynomial of degree at most n is degenerated to the zero polynomial.
Nevertheless it follows immediately that because
g(x, y) > 0 = g(0, 0)
for every (x, y) = (0, 0),
we must have a minimum at (0, 0) for g(x, y). ♦
I. 1) It follows for the point (0, 0) that since the terms of third degree are dominating the terms of
fourth degree, we must have in a neighbourhood of (0, 0) that
f(x, y) ≈P3(x, y) = −4x3 −4y3 = −4(x + y)(x2 −xy + y2).

The range of a function
Since
x2 −xy + y2 =

x −y
2
2
+ 3
4 y2 > 0
for (x, y) = (0, 0),
the polynomial P3(x, y) must have the same sign as −(x + y), i.e. it is negative over the line
y = −x and positive under this line. We therefore conclude that P3(x, y), and hence also f(x, y)
attains both positive and negative values in any neighbourhood of (0, 0), where f(0, 0) = 0.
Hence we cannot have an extremum at (0, 0).
2) For the other candidates the (r, s, t)-method is easier, because it is the essence of the deter-
mination of the approximative polynomial of at most degree two.
One often forgets in the
applications that this is the general idea behind the (r, s, t)-method. Note that we in 1) had to
expand to the third degree, which is the reason why the (r, s, t)-method fails for (0, 0).
Since
r = 12x2 + 8y2 −24x,
s = 16xy,
t = 8x2 + 12y2 −24y,
we derive the following, using the (r, s, t)-method.
a) At (1, 1) we calculate
r = −4,
s = 16,
t = −4
and
rt −s2 = −240,
so according to the (r, s, t)-scheme there is no extremum at (1, 1).
b) At (3, 0) we calculate
r = 36,
s = 0,
t = 72
and
rt −s2 = 2592,
so according to the (r, s, t)-scheme there is a proper minimum at (3, 0).
c) Since the function is symmetric in (x, y), the computations are obtained as in 2) with x and
y interchanged. This changes nothing in the conclusion, so we have a proper minimum at
(0, 3).
d) For completeness we note that we at (0, 0) get r = s = t = 0, so nothing can be concluded
by using the (r, s, t)-method alone.
There is, however, also an alternative method for the other points. This will here be illustrated
at the point (1, 1).
a) First we reset, the problem, i.e. put (x, y) = (1 + h, 1 + k), so (h, k) = (0, 0) corresponds to
the point (x, y) = (1, 1) under examination.
b) Insert this in the expression for f(x, y) and write dots for terms of degree > 2:
f(x, y)
=
(1 + h)4 + 4(1 + h)2(1 + k)2 + (1 + k)4 −4(1 + h)3 −4(1 + k)3

The range of a function
Since P2(h, k) + 2 attains both negative values (for k = 0 and h ̸= 0) and positive values
(for h = 4k) in any neighbourhood of (h, k) = (0, 0), we conclude that (x, y) = (1, 1) is not
an extremum. ♦

The range of a function
Example 16.13
A. Examine whether the function
f(x, y) = 1 −4x2 −4y2 + x2y2,
(x, y) ∈R2.
has any extremum. Find the range f(R2).
D. When we apply the standard procedure we are guided through the usual examination of the
exceptional points (there are none) and of the stationary points. It is, however, here possible to
make a shortcut by noticing that f(x, y) only is a function in u = x2 and v = y2, i.e.
f(x, y) = 1 −4x2 −4y2 + x2y2 = g(u, v) = 1 −4u −4v + uv,
u, v ≥0.
I. The stationary points for f(x, y), if any, must fulﬁl the equations
∂f
∂x = −2x(4 −y2) = 0
and
∂f
∂y = −2y(4 −x2) = 0.
This system is split into
x = 0
or
y = 2
or
y = −2,
and
y = 0
or
x = 2
or
x = −2.
Formally we get 3 · 3 possibilities, but four of them are not possible (e.g. x cannot at the same
time be 0 and 2 or −2). We therefore get ﬁve stationary points,
(0, 0),
(2, 2),
(−2, −2),
(−2, 2),
(2, −2).
We ﬁrst apply the (r, s, t)-method. Here we get
r = 2y2 −8,
s = 4xy,
t = 2x2 −8,
from which
1) At (0, 0) we calculate
r = −8,
s = 0,
t = −8,
and
rt −s2 = 64,
so it follows that we have a proper maximum at (0, 0).
2) Due to the symmetry we get the same calculations at the two points (2, 2) and (−2, −2), namely
r = 0,
s = 16,
t = 0,
and
rt −s2 = −256.
We conclude that there is no extremum at any of the two points (2, 2), (−2, −2).
3) Due to the symmetry we get the same calculations at the two points (2, −2) and (−2, 2), namely
r = 0,
s = −16,
t = 0,
and
rt −s2 = −256.
Again, the conclusion is that there is no extremum at the points (2, −2), (−2, 2),

Then we turn to the alternative methods.
1) In (0, 0) we get
f(x, y) ≈P2(x, y) = 1 −4x2 −4y2.
The graph of z = P2(x, y) is an elliptic paraboloid of revolution. Obviously we have a proper
local maximum at (0, 0).
2) We take a shortcut by considering
g(u, v) = 1 −4u −4v + uv,
u = x2,
v = y2,
instead. First, all four stationary points for f are seen to correspond to the only point (u, v) =
(4, 4). It is therefore suﬃcient to examine g(u, v) in the neighbourhood of (4, 4).

using:
g(u, v) = 1 −4u −4v + uv,
g(4, 4) = −15,

,
hence
P3(u, v) = −15 + 1
2 · (u −4)(v −4) = −15 + (u −4)(v −4).
It follows that P2(u, v) in the neighbourhood of (4, 4) attains values which are both > −15 and
< −15. Thus g(u, v) does not have an extremum at (4, 4). This implies that f(x, y) does not
have an extremum at (±2, ±2) (all four possible combinations of the sign).
3) The function f(x, y) has only one local maximum,
f(0, 0) = 1.
However, this value is not the global maximum. In fact, by rewriting
f(x, y) = 1 −4x2 −4y2 + x2y2 = (x2 −4)(y2 −4) −15,
we see that the restriction to the line y = x gives
f(x, x) =

x2 −4
2 −15 →+∞
for x →±∞.
4) Note also that
f(x, 0) = 1 −4x2 →−∞
for x →±∞.
Thus, since f is continuous on the connected set R2, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for
continuous functions that the range is
f(R2) = R.

Extremum for continuous functions in three or more variables
In this section we show how to treat the extremum problem, when we consider a C2-function f : A →R
ﬁrst in three variables, i.e. A ⊆R3, and then for general Rm, m ≥2.
Assume that x0 ∈A ⊆R3 is a stationary point, i.e. in the coordinates of the gradient,

The range of a function
Neglecting the “error term” ε(h)h2, which tends towards 0 faster than h2, the problem is reduced
to a discussion of the bilinear form
F(h) := h−Mh|,
where as mentioned above the square matrix M is symmetric, Mij = Mji.
It is known from Linear Algebra that a real symmetric (3 × 3)-matrix has three real eigenvalues
λ1, λ2, λ3, counted by multiplicity., and that we can write
F(h) = h−Mh| =
3

i=1
λiw2
i ,
where w1, w2, w3 are some linear combinations of h1, h2, h3, chosen such that w = h, where
w = (w1, w2, w3).
It is well-known from Linear Algebra that the eigenvalues are the roots in the equation
det(M −λI) = 0,
where I is the unit (3 × 3)-matrix.
The structure of the wi’s is not important here. Of importance for the analysis of possible extrema are
only the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, λ3, because we by using known results from Linear Algebra immediately
get the following results.
1) The matrix M is positive deﬁnite, if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive. In this case f has
a proper minimum at the stationary point x0.
2) The matrix M is negative deﬁnite, if and only if all its eigenvalues are negative. In this case f has
a proper maximum at the stationary point x0.
3) The matrix M is indeﬁnite, if and only if there are at least one positive and one negative eigenvalue.
In this case f has no extremum at the stationary point x0,
4) The matrix M is semideﬁnite,, if and only if at least one of the eigenvalues is 0, and the nonzero
eigenvalues have all the same sign. In this case nothing can be concluded based alone on the
present analysis.
The analysis above was performed in R3, but it is trivial to extend it to any Rm, m ≥2. However,
when m ≥4, the computations soon become overwhelming, unless we have chosen very special cases.
Let us check the result for m = 2, already treated in Section 16.3.2. In this case,

The range of a function
where K was introduced in Section 16.3.2.
When we go through the four bullets above, we again derive the (r, s, t)-scheme, so this is only a
special case of this more general theory, in which we applied some matrix calculus.
Example 16.14 Consider the function
f(x, y, z) = x3 + x2 + 2xy −y2 −z2
for (x, y, z) ∈R3,
in three real variables. Since f ∈C∞
R3
, there are no exception points.
Then we turn to the stationary points. First we compute the coordinates of the gradient,
f ′
x(x, y, z) = 3x2 + 2x + 2y,
f ′
y(x, y, z) = 2x −2y,
f ′
z(x, y, z) = −2z,
which we shall need to calculate the derivatives of second order.
The stationary points are the solutions of the system of equations,
3x2 + 2x + 2y = 0,
2x −2y = 0
and
−2z = 0,
thus z = 0 (third equation), and y = x (second equation). Eliminating y in the ﬁrst equation we get
0 = 3x2 + 4x = x(3x + 4),
so x = 0 or x = −4
3.
We conclude that there are two stationary points,
(0, 0, 0)
and

Then we calculate the matrix M consisting of the derivatives of second order,
M =

so the eigenvalues are
λ1 = −2
√
2,
λ2 = −2,
λ3 = +2

2.
Since λ1 and λ3 have opposite signs, we conclude that the matrix is indeﬁnite at (0, 0, 0), hence
(0, 0, 0) has not an extremum.

for (x, y, z, w) ∈R4.

∂f
∂y = 3y2 −3w2,
∂f

−6xz + 6 = 0,
−6yw + 6 = 0,
from which z = ±x and xz = 1, so z = x = ±1, and w = ±y and yw = 1, so y = w = ±1. By taking
all possible combinations of the signs we ﬁnd the following four stationary points,
(1, 1, 1, 1),
(1, −1, 1, −1),
(−1, 1, −1, 1),

MAPLE
It is possible in the examples to use some MAPLE commands. For completeness we mention the
following:
with(VectorCalculus):
Gradient(f(x, y), [x, y])
or
Gradient(f(x, y, z), [x, y, z])
etc., where e.g. f(x, y) is an explicit expression of a function, and [x, y] is a list of coordinates. The
results are given in the form
f ′
x(x, y)ex + f ′
y(x, y)ey,
and similarly.
It is also possible in this way to ﬁnd the gradient in polar/spherical coordinates.
An alternative way in in R3:
with(Physics[Vectors]):
Gradient(f(x, y, z), [x, y, z])
which is the same as above, or, using
Nabla(f(x, y, z), [x, y, z])
instead.
One may also plot the gradient ﬁeld of a given function f. The commands are:
with(plots):
gradplot(f(x, y), x = a..b, y = c..d)
or
gradplot3d(f(x, y, z), x = a..b, y = c..d, z = h..k)
in R2 and R3 resp..
However, most of the examples in this chapter are so simple that we shall only make little use of
MAPLE.

Examples of extremum for two variables
Example 17.1 Find in each of the following cases ﬁrst the stationary points of the given function
f : R2 →R. Then check if f in any of these points has an extremum; whenever this is the case, decide
whether it is a maximum or a minimum.
1) f(x, y) = x2 + 2y2 −2x −2y.
2) f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 2xy.
3) f(x, y) = xy2.
4) f(x, y) = 3x3 + 4y3 + 6xy2 −9x2.
5) f(x, y) = (x2 + y2 −2y)(x2 + y2 −6y)
6) f(x, y) = x4 + y4 −2x2y2.
7) f(x, y) = 3x4 + 4y4 −4x2y2.
8) f(x, y) = (sin x) cos y.
9) f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + exy.
10) f(x, y) = xy + 2 sinh(1 + x2 + y2).
11) f(x, y) = x3y −2x2y + xy3.
A Stationary points; extrema.
D Inspect the expression for a smart rearrangement. Find the stationary points. Check if these are

t = ∂2f
∂y2 = 4,
that r, t > 0 and s2 < rt, so we conclude that we have a minimum.
2) a) Inspection. It is immediately seen that
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 2xy = (x + y)2,
which has a minimum (= 0) on the line y = −x. The points of this line are of course not
proper minima.
b) The stationary points. These are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = 2x + 2y = 2(x + y) = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y + 2x = 2(x + y) = 0,
thus every point on the line y = −x is a stationary point.

Examples of global and local extrema
In this case we cannot conclude anything by the (r, s, t)-method. One should, however, be
able to see that e.g.
df = ∂f
∂x dx + ∂f
∂y dy = 2(x + y)(dx + dy) = d(x + y)2,
so f(x, y) = (x + y)2, and we are back to the ﬁrst variant.
3) It follows from
∂f
∂x = y2 = 0
and
∂f
∂y = 2xy = 0
that the stationary points are the points on the X axis y = 0. In a neighbourhood of any
point (x0, 0), x0 = 0 we see that xy2 has the same sign as x0, and it is 0 on the X axis. This
means that we have a minimum (though not a proper minimum) for every (x0, 0), x0 > 0, and
a maximum (though not a proper maximum) for every (x0, 0), x0 < 0. In the stationary point
(0, 0) we have neither a maximum nor a minimum, because the function in any neighbourhood
of (0, 0) takes on both positive and negative values.
4) When f(x, y) = 3x3 + 4y3 + 6xy2 −9x2, the equations of the stationary points are


∂f
∂x = 9x2 + 6y2 −18x = 0,
∂f
∂y = 12y2 + 12xy = 12y(y + x) = 0.
We get two possibilities from the latter condition:
y = 0
or
y = −x.
a) If we put y = 0 into the ﬁrst equation we get
9x2 −18x = 9x(x −2) = 0,
so we conclude that (0, 0) and (2, 0) are stationary points.
b) If we put y = −x into the ﬁrst equation we get
15x2 −18x = 15x

so we get the stationary points (0, 0) and

Summing up we have three diﬀerent stationary points

These are now considered one by one.
a) The point (0, 0) is not an extremum, because e.g. f(0, y) = 4y3 takes on both positive and
negative values in any neighbourhood of (0, 0).
In the other two cases we apply the (r, s, t)-method. We ﬁrst calculate the general results
r = ∂2f
∂x2 = 18x −18,
s = ∂2f
∂x∂y = 12y,
t = ∂2f
∂y2 = 24y + 12x.

b) At (2, 0) we have r = 18, s = 0 and t = 24, so rt > s2, r > 0, t > 0, corresponding to a

c) At

we have r = 18

signs), and we have no extremum.
Summarizing we see that only (2, 0) is an extremum (a proper minimum).
5) It follows by the rearrangement
f(x, y)
=
(x2 + y2 −2y)(x2 + y2 −6y)
=

x2 + {y −1}2 −1
 
x2 + {y −3}2 −32

x2 + (y −1)2 = 1
and
x2 + (y −3)2 = 32.

The function is positive inside both circles (i.e. inside the smaller circle), and outside both
circles. It is negative at every point inside the larger circle and outside the smaller circle. The
function is continuous and 0 on both circles, so it follows from the main theorem that we must
have a local maximum inside the smaller circle, and a local minimum inside the larger disc
(and outside the smaller disc). Finally, f is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood
of (0, 0), so this point cannot be an extremum.
Remark. It follows from the above that one can apply the main theorem in a qualitative way
to decide where we must have extrema. Such analyses of ﬁgures are very useful. ♦
The stationary points. We shall now start on the tough calculations of the example. It
follows from
f(x, y) = (x2 + y2 −2y)(x2 + y2 −6y)
that
∂f
∂x = 2x(x2 + y2 −6y) + 2x(x2 + y2 −2y) = 4x(x2 + y2 −4y),

.
The two equations of the stationary points are therefore written more conveniently
(17.1)



x(x2 + y2 −4y)
=
0,
(y −2)(x2 + y2 −4y)
=
2y.
It follows from the ﬁrst equation that the stationary points (if any) either lies on the line x = 0
or on the circle x2 + (y −2)2 = 22.
a) If x = 0, then we get from the latter equation (17.1) that
0

(y −2)(y2 −4y) −2y = y{(y −2)(y −4) −2}
=

so either y = 0 or y = 3 ±
√
3. Hence we get three stationary points,
(0, 0),
(0, 3 +
√
3),
(0, 3 −
√
3).
b) If x2 + y2 −4y = 0, then it follows from the latter equation of (17.1) that y = 0, and thus
x = 0, so we ﬁnd again (0, 0).
Summarizing we get the three stationary points
(0, 0),
(0, 3 +
√
3),
(0, 3 −
√
3).
Alternatively the expression gives one the inspiration of using polar coordinates. We get
f(x, y) = (̺2 −2̺ sin ϕ)(̺2 −6̺ sin ϕ) = ̺4 −8̺3 sin ̺ + 12̺2 sin2 ϕ,
hence
∂f
∂̺
=
4̺3 −24̺2 sin ϕ + 24̺ sin2 ϕ = 4̺

̺2 −6̺ sin ϕ + 6 sin2 ϕ

,
∂f
∂ϕ
=
−8̺3 cos ϕ + 24ϕ2 sin ϕ cos ϕ = 8̺2 cos ϕ(−̺ + 3 sin ϕ).
After a reduction the system of equations is written
(17.2)



̺

̺2 −6̺ sin ϕ + 6 sin2 ϕ

= 0,
̺2 cos ϕ(3 sin ϕ −̺) = 0.
From the latter equation we get the three possibilities ̺ = 0, cos ϕ = 0 and 3 sin ϕ = ̺.
a) If ̺ = 0, then both equations are fulﬁlled so (0, 0) is a stationary point corresponding to
̺ = 0, hence to (0, 0) in rectangular coordinates.

b) If cos ϕ = 0 (and ̺ ≥0), then sin ϕ = ±1.
i) When sin ϕ = −1 it follows that
̺2 −6̺ sin ϕ + 6 sin2 ϕ = ̺2 + 6̺ + 6 ≥6
for ̺ ≥0,
so we are only left with the possibility ̺ = 0, which has already been treated above.
ii) When sin ϕ = 1 (and ̺ = y, because y = ̺ sin ϕ), then
̺2 −6̺ sin ϕ + 6 sin2 ϕ = ̺2 −6̺ + 6 = 0
has the two positive solutions ̺ = 3 ±

Examples of global and local extrema
Check of the type of the stationary points, inspection. It follows from the discussion
of the sign in the beginning of the example that (0, 0) is not an extremum, because the function
takes on both positive and negative values in any neighbourhood of (0, 0).
The point (0, 3 −
√
3) must be a local maximum. In fact, we have already by the main theorem
concluded that there exists a local maximum in the smaller disc, and since f ∈C∞, it can only
be attained at a stationary point. Since (0, 3 −
√
3) is the only stationary point in the smaller
disc the claim follows.
It follows analogously by the discussion of the sign that (0, 3 +
√
3) must be a local minimum.
Remark. Note that by the application of the main theorem we obtain a much simpler analysis
than by the traditional standard methods in the following. We have almost done everything!
♦
Investigation of the type of the stationary points, standard procedure.
a) We ﬁrst check (0, 0).
i) First variant, the (r, s, t)-method. This breaks totally down because
r = s = t = 0,
and nothing can be concluded.
ii) Second variant. Approximating polynomials of at most second degree. This cannot
be used either, because
P2(x, y) ≡0,
and nothing can be concluded.
iii) Third variant. A dirty trick. If follows from
4ab = (a + b)2 −(a −b)2,
i.e. ab = 1
4

(a + b)2 −(a −b)2
,
that
a = x2 + y2 −2y
and
b = x2 + y2 −6y,
so
f(x, y) = 1
4

4(x2 + y2 −4y)2 −16y2
= (x2 + y2 −4y)2 −4y2.
If we go towards (0, 0) along the line y = 0, then f(x, 0) > 0, and if we go towards (0, 0)
along the circle x2 + y2 −4y = 0, then f(x, y) < 0, so f takes on both positive and
negative values in any neighbourhood of(0, 0). Therefore we cannot have an extremum
at (0, 0).
Remark. The trick above is one of the very oldest in mathematics. The Egyptians
did not have tables of multiplication, though tables of squared numbers. They used the
trick above to calculate products. ♦
Erroneous variant. One might try to investigate the limit along all lines through (0, 0).
i) If y = 0, then f(x, 0) = x4 > 0 for x = 0.

Examples of global and local extrema
ii) If x = 0, then
f(0, y) = (y2 −2y)(y2 −6y) = y2(2 −y)(6 −y) > 0
for 0 < |y| < 2.
iii) If y = ax, a = 0, then
f(x, ax) = · · · = x2{2a −(1 + a2)x}{6a −(1 + a2)x},
where the product of the latter two factors tends towards 12a2 > 0 for x →0, and
accordingly
f(x, ax) > 0
suﬃciently close to 0.
One might then erroneously conclude that (0, 0) is a minimum, what it is not.
b) Let us return to the points (0, 3 ±
√
3). These are checked by the (r, s, t)-method. First
calculate
r
=
∂2f
∂x2 = 4{x2 + y −4y} + 8x2 = 12x2 + 4y(y −4),
s
=
∂2f
∂x∂y = 4x(2y −4) = 8x(y −2),
t
=
∂2f
∂y2 = 4(x2 + y2 −4y) + 4(y −2)(2y −4) −8 = 4x2 + 12y(y −4).
Since both stationary points satisfy x = 0 we can reduce in the following way
r|x=0
=
4y(y −4),
s|x=0
=
0,
t|x=0
=
12y(y −4) = 3r|x=0,
thus
r|x=0t|x=0 = 3

r|x=0
2 ≥0 = s2
|x=0.
We therefore have extremum when r|x=0 = 0.
i) We have at the point (0, 3 +
√
3) that 3 +
√
3 > 4, so r > 0, and t > 0, so we have a
minimum.
ii) We have at the point (0, 3 −
√
3) that 3 −
√
3 < 4, so r < 0, and t < 0, and we have a
maximum.
6) Here
f(x, y) = x4 + y4 −2x2y2 =

x2 −y22 = (x −y)2(x + y)2,
corresponding to a minimum on the lines y = x and y = −x.
Alternatively,
∂f
∂x
=
4x3 −4xy2 = 4x(x2 −y2),
∂f
∂y
=
4y3 −4x2y = 4y(y2 −x2).
The stationary points are
(0, 0),
(x, x) and (x, −x),
x ∈R,
corresponding to the fact that the stationary points form the set consisting of the two lines
y = x and y = −x. On these we have a minimum, though not a proper minimum.

7) Here
f(x, y) = 3x4 + 4y4 −4x2y2 = (4y4 −4x2y2 + x4)02x4 =

2y2 −x22 + 2x4,
so we have got a minimum for y2 = 1
2 x2 = 0, i.e. at (0, 0).
Alternatively
∂f
∂x
=
12x3 −8xy2 = 4x(3z2 −2y2),
∂f
∂y
=
16y3 −8x2y = 8y(2y2 −x2).
It is almost obvious that (0, 0) is the only stationary point.
8) Here
∂f
∂x = cos x · cos y
and
∂f
∂y = −sin x · sin y.
These expressions are both zero, if and only if
(x, y) =
π
2 + pπ, qπ

,
p, q ∈Z,
hence
(x, y) =

pπ, π
2 + qπ

,
p, q ∈Z.
These are the stationary points.
Since
f
π
2 + pπ, qπ

= (−1)p · (−1)q = (−1)p+q
og
f

pπ, π
2 + qπ

= 0,
and |f(x, y)| ≤1, it follows immediately that we have maxima at
π
2 + pπ, qπ

for p + q even,
and minima at
π
2 + pπ, qπ

for p + q odd.
In the neighbourhood of any point of the form

pπ, π
2 + qπ

the function attains both positive
and negative values, so these points are not extrema.
9) The equations of the stationary points for f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + exy are
∂f
∂x = 2x + yexy = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y + xexy = 0.
These are clearly satisﬁed for (x, y) = (0, 0), so (0, 0) is a stationary point.

Assume that x = 0. Then also y = 0, and thus xy = 0. Accordingly,
2x2 = −xyexy = 2y2,
i.e. x2 = y2 and xy ≤0, so y = −x. If this restriction is put into the ﬁrst equation, we get
0 = 2x −xe−x2 = x

2 −e−x2
,
which has only the solution x = 0.
Remark. This is actually a “false solution”. On the other hand, we have already checked that
(0, 0) is a stationary point. ♦
Hence, (0, 0) is the only stationary point.

b) We get from
∂2f
∂x2 = 2 + y2exy,
r = 2,
∂2f
∂x∂y = exy + xyexy,
s = 1,
∂2f
∂y2 = 2 + x2exy,
t = 2,
that rt > s2, and since r > 0 and t > 0, the stationary point (0, 0) must be a proper
minimum.
10) The equations for the stationary points for f(x, y) = xy + 2 sinh(1 + x2 + y2) are
∂f
∂x
=
y + 4x cosh(1 + x2 + y2) = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
x + 4y cosh(1 + x2 + y2) = 0.
By inspection, (0, 0) is clearly a stationary point. If there were other stationary points they
should fulﬁl xy = 0. Assume that (x, y) = (0, 0) is such a stationary point. Then
y2 = −4xy cosh(1 + x2 + y2) = x2,
so y2 = x2 and xy < 0, thus y = −x. By insertion the condition is reduced to
0 = −x + 4x cosh(1 + 2x2) = x(4 cosh(1 + 2x2) −1).
Now 4 cosh(1 + 2x2) −1 > 0, so x = 0 is the only solution (and strictly speaking we assumed
that x = 0). On the other hand, he have already proved that (0, 0) is a stationary point.
Accordingly, (0, 0) is the only stationary point.
Concerning extremum at (0, 0) we have again several possibilities.
a) It follows from
∂2f
∂x2 = 4 cosh(1 + x2 + y2) + x{· · · },
r = 4 cosh1,
∂2f
∂x∂y = 1 + x{· · · },
s = 1,
∂2f
∂y2 = 4 cosh(1 + x2 + y2) + y{· · · },
t = 4 cosh 1,
that rt > s2 and r > 0 and t > 0, corresponding to a minimum.

The plane is then divided into six subregions, in which the sign of the function is ﬁxed. Every
one of these open subregions has (0, 0) as a boundary point, so if one circles around (0, 0), then
the sign of the function will be positive in every second subregion and negative in the others,
because the sign is negative in the second quadrant and positive in the third quadrant.
The equations of the stationary points are

and
∂f
∂y = x3 −2x2 + 3xy2 = x(x2 −2x + 3y2) = 0.
If we put y = 0, then the ﬁrst equation is fulﬁlled, and the second one is reduced to
0 = x(x2 −2x) = x2(x −2).
Therefore, in this case we get the stationary points (0, 0) and (2, 0).

It follows from the ﬁgure that (0, 0) and (2, 0) both lie on one of the zero curves, so
f(0, 0) = f(2, 0) = 0.
Then we conclude from the discussion of the sign that the function is both positive and negative
in any neighbourhood of the points (0, 0) and (2, 0), so these cannot be extrema.
Since f is of class C∞, and since the two closed half discs are bounded with the value 0 of the
function on the boundaries, it follows from the second main theorem that we have a minimum
somewhere in the interior of the upper half disc and a maximum somewhere in the interior of
the lower half disc. These must necessarily be attained at stationary points. There is exactly
one stationary point in each of these half discs, so we conclude that the local minimum is

Alternatively one may try the (r, s, t)-method. First calculate

∂x2 = 6xy −4y = 2y(3x −2),
s

∂2f
∂x∂y = 3x2 −4x + 3y2,

∂y2 = 6xy.
For (0, 0) we cannot conclude anything, because r = s = t = 0.
For (2, 0) we get r = 0, s = 12 −8 = 4 and t = 0, thus rt < s2, and we have no extremum.

so r < 0, t < 0 and rt > s2, and we have a proper maximum at the point.
Finally, let us consider the point (0, 0). By using polar coordinates we get
f(x, y)
=
̺4 cos3 ϕ sin ϕ −2̺3 cos2 ϕ sin ϕ + ̺4 cos ϕ · sin3 ϕ
=
̺2{−2 cos2 ϕ sin ϕ + ϕ cos ϕ · sin ϕ}.
When ̺ →0+, the ﬁrst term dominates in most cases, and since the ﬁrst term can take on
both positive and negative values, we conclude that (0, 0) is not an extremum.
Example 17.2 Let α be a constant. Check for each value of α if the function
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + αxy + (x −y)4
has an extremum at (0, 0). Whenever this is the case, check also if it is a proper extremum.
A Investigation of extrema.
D First method. Rewrite f(x, y) and give a direct argument.
Second method. Apply the (r, s, t)-method.
I As f(x, y) is a polynomial,f(x, y) is of class C∞. We note that f(0, 0) = 0.
1) First method. This method is similar to (though not identical with) the procedure of ﬁnding
the approximating polynomial of second degree. By rewriting the terms of second degree we
get

Examples of global and local extrema
a) If |α| < 2, then all three terms of (17.3) are bigger than or equal to 0, and when (x, y) =
(0, 0), then at least one of them is bigger than zero. Thus we conclude that (0, 0) is a proper
minimum.
b) If α = 2, then (17.3) reduces to
f(x, y) = (x + y)2 + (x −y)4
[≥0].
If (x, y) = (0, 0), then x + y and x −y cannot both be 0 and we conclude as above that we
have a proper minimum at (0, 0).
c) If α = −2 (the diﬃcult case) we write (17.3) in the form
f(x, y) = (x −y)2 + (x −y)4 = (x −y)2{1 + (x −y)2}
[≥0].
It follows that the minimum 0 is attained on the line y = x, so we conclude that we have a
minimum, but not a proper minimum at (0, 0).
d) If |α| > 2, then 0 > 1 −

and the approximating polynomial of second degree is

for x = 0,
and
P2(x, 0) = x2 > 0
for x = 0,
[in fact also f(x, 0) > 0 for x = 0], we conclude that f(x, y) attains both positive and
negative values in any neighbourhood of (0, 0), and we do not have an extremum.
Summarizing we have
α < −2 :
(0, 0) is not an extremum,
α = −2 :
(0, 0) is a (non-proper) minimum,
α ∈] −2, 2] :
(0, 0) is a proper minimum,
α > 2 :
(0, 0) is not an extremum.
2) Second method, the (r, s, t)-method. First note that the (r, s, t)-method can only/ be applied
if f ∈C2 and if (0, 0) indeed is a stationary point. Therefore, we must ﬁrst show that (0, 0) is
a stationary point.
It follows from
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + αxy + (x −y)4,
f(0, 0) = 0,

that
∂f
∂x = 2x + αy + 4(x −y)3,
∂f
∂x(0, 0) = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y + αx −4(x −y)3,
∂f
∂y (0, 0) = 0,
so (0, 0) is a stationary point.
Furthermore,
∂2f
∂x2 = 2 + 12(x −y)2,
r = ∂2f
∂x2 (0, 0) = 2,
∂2f
∂x∂y = α −12(x −y)2,
s = ∂2f
∂x∂y (0, 0) = α,
∂2f
∂y2 = 2 + 12(x −y)2,
t = ∂2f
∂y2 (0, 0) = 2.
A suﬃcient condition for extremum is that rt > s2, i.e. α < 4, which is fulﬁlled for α ∈]−2, 2[.
Since r, t > 0, the stationary point (0, 0) is a proper minimum, when α ∈] −2, 2[.
If |α| > 2, then rt = 4 < α2 = s2, and we do not have an extremum in this case.
If α2 = 4, i.e. α = ±2, then s2 = rt, and we cannot conclude anything by the (r, s, t)-method.
Note that even if we get this negative result, there is no reason to stop. We have only demon-
strated that one particular method does not work. Let us now investigate each of the cases
α = 2 and α = −2 one by one.
a) If α = 2, then f(x, y) is written
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + 2xy + (x −y)4 = (x + y)2 + (x −y)4 ≥0.
When (x, y) = (0, 0), at least one of the terms (x+y)2 is (x−y)4 positive, and we conclude
that (0, 0) is a proper minimum.
b) Analogously, if α = −2,
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 −2xy + (x −y)4 = (x −y)2 + (x −y)4 = (x −y)2{1 + (x −y)2}.
We conclude that f(x, y) ≥0 and f(x, x) = 0 for every x, i.e. on the line. This shows that
(0, 0) is a non-proper minimum. Summarizing we get
|α| > 2 :
(0, 0) is not an extremum.
|α| < 2 :
(0, 0) is a proper minimum,
α = 2 :
(0, 0) is a proper minimum,
α = −2 :
(0, 0) is a (non-proper) minimum.

Show that the restriction of f to any straight line through (0, 0) has a proper minimum at the point
(0, 0). Then prove that f does not have a minimum at this point.
(Write f(x, y) as a product of two factors and check the sign of f in discs with centrum at the origo).

D Insert x = 0 and y = αx into f(x, y), and prove that there is a minimum at (0, 0) on each of these

Consider possibly f(x, y) as a polynomial in y of degree 2 for every x which will help to factorize
f(x, y). Use this factorization to discuss the sign of f(x, y).
I 1) When x = 0 we get f(0, y) = y2, which clearly has a minimum for y = 0, i.e. at (0, 0).

Figure 17.3: The function is positive inside both parabolas, and outside both parabolas, and negative
between them.
Then we conclude that we have the factorization
f(x, y) = 3x4 −4x2y + y2 = (y −x2)(y −3x2).
When we sketch the zero curves, the plane is divided as shown on the ﬁgure into four regions,
where f(x, y) > 0 inside both parabolas or outside both parabolas, and f(x, y) < 0 between
the two parabolas.
It follows from the ﬁgure that f(x, y) is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of
the point (0, 0), where f(0, 0) = 0.
Remark. When we consider the line on the ﬁgure we see that it will always lie totally in a
“positive” region, when we are close to (0, 0). The trick of the example is that the zero curves
are so “ﬂat” in the neighbourhood of (0, 0) that they cannot be “caught” by any straight line.

Alternatively we see that if we take the restriction to the curve given by the equation
y = 2x2, then
f(x, 2x2) = 3x4 −8x4 + 4x4 = −x4,

which obviously has a (local) maximum for x = 0, i.e. at (0, 0), so (0, 0) cannot be an ex-
tremum. The construction of this alternative solution relies on that we can choose a curve in
the “negative” region between the two zero curves approaching (0, 0).
Example 17.4 Let the function f : R2 →R be given by
f(x, y) = −x2 + 2xy2 −y4 + y5.
Show that the restriction of f to any straight line through (0, 0) has a proper maximum at this point.

D Insert x = 0, y = 0 and y = αx i f(x, y). Then exploit that −x2 + 2xy2 −y4 = −(x −y2)2.

Figure 17.4: The parabola x = y2.
If x = 0, then f(0, y) = −y4 + y5 = −y4(1 −y), which clearly has a maximum for y = 0, i.e.
at(0, 0).
If y = 0, then f(x, 0) = −x2, which clearly has a maximum for x = 0, i.e. at (0, 0).

f(x, αx) = −x2 + 2α2x3 −α4x4 + α5x5 = −x2

When |x| is small, then the latter factor is positive, and it follows that f(x, αx) has a maximum
for x = 0.

Examples of global and local extrema
When we restrict ourselves to the parabola x = y2, y ∈R, then
f(y2, y) = y2
has the same sign as y, so f(x, y) attains both positive and negative values in any neighbourhood
of (0, 0). It follows that (0, 0) is not an extremum.
Example 17.5 Let f : R2 →R be given by
f(x, y) = x2y + xy2 + x2 + xy + 1.
check if f has an extremum at (0, 0).
A Extremum.
D Here we have several possible methods:
1) First variant. The (r, s, t)-method.
2) Second variant. Factorize x2 + xy2 + x2 + xy, and discuss the sign of it.
3) Third variant. Put y = αx into f(x, y) for some choice of α.
I 1) First variant. This time (almost an exception) the (r, s, t)-method is the simplest one, so we
shall start with it. From
∂f
∂x = 2xy + y2 + 2x + y,
∂f
∂y = x2 + 2xy + x,
follows
∂f
∂x(0, 0) = 0
and
∂f
∂y (0, 0) = 0,
so (0, 0) is a stationary point. (Note that this must be checked before we continue with the
(r, s, t)-method).
Then it is quite easy to see that we have at (0, 0)
r = 2,
s = 1
and
t = 0,
so rt = 0 < 1 = s2. We conclude that there is no extremum at (0, 0).
2) Second variant. We get by a factorization,
f(x, y) = x2y + xy2 + x2 + x + 1 = xy(x + y) + x(x + y) + 1.
The value of the function is f(0, 0) = 1, and the “disturbance”
(y + 1)x(x + y)
has the zero curves as shown on the ﬁgure. The sign of the “disturbance” changes whenever one
passes a zero curve, so if one moves around (0, 0), one will always pass through both positive
and negative regions for f(x, y) −f(0, 0). This means that f(x, y) cannot have an extremum
at (0, 0), because f(x, y) attains both values > f(0, 0) and < f(0, 0) in any neighbourhood of
(0, 0).

Figure 17.5: The zero curves are the lines x+y = 0, x = 0 and y = −1. In the subregions the product
(y + 1)x(x + y) is positive and negative every second time.
3) Third variant Along the line y = αx we get
ϕα(x) = f(x, αx) = (α + α2)x3 + (1 + α)x2 + 1 = 1 + (1 + α)x2 + · · · ,
where the dots indicate terms of higher degree which are small in a neighbourhood of (0, 0)
compared to x2.
a) If α > −1, then ϕα(x) ≥1 in a neighbourhood of x = 0.
b) If α < −1, then ϕα(x) ≤1 in a neighbourhood of x = 0.
In both cases we have a strict inequality sign in a dotted neighbourhood, and we conclude that
there is no extremum at (0, 0).

accordingly,

Second variant. If we put x = t + 1, then we shall check what happens in the neighbourhood of
(t, y) = (0, 0). A simple computation gives
f(t + 1, y)

The term of second order
(t + y)(t + 3y) = (x + y −1)(x + 3y −1)
is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of the point (x, y) = (1, 0), and since it
in general dominates the term of third order t(t2 + y2) = (x −1){(x −1)2 + y2}, there is no
extremum at (1, 0).

we get r = 8, s = 0, t = 16 −8 = 8, so rt −s2 = 64 > 0, and

The values of the function at these points are

2) Since f is continuous (it is of class C∞), and the rectangle

Second method. As f ∈C∞, we get by computation,

It follows that (0, 0) is a stationary point. Furthermore,

xx(0, 0) = 2,

f ′′
yy(x, y) = 2 cosh(x + y) −x2exy,
f ′′
yy(0, 0) = 2.
Since rt = 4 > 1 = s2, and r, t > 0, we conclude that we have a local minimum.
Remark. Because
f(x, x) = 2 cosh(2x) −exp(x2) →−∞
for x →+∞,
the minimum above cannot be global.

Examples of global and local extrema
We have e.g.
f(x, 0) = 2 coshx −1 →+∞
for x →+∞,
and since f is continuous on the connected set R2, the range is f(R2) = R.
Example 17.10 Given the function
f(x, y) = xy −y2 −2 ln x,
(x, y) ∈D,
where
D = {(x, y) ∈R2 | x > 0}.
1) Find the approximating polynomial of at most second degree of the function f, where (x0, y0) =
(2, 1) is used as point of expansion.
2) Check if the function f has an extremum at the point (2, 1), and indicate its type if it is an
extremum.

degree that (2, 1) is not an extremum.

As
f ′
x(2, 1) = f ′
y(2, 1) = 0,
we see that (2, 1) is a stationary point.
As rt < 0, there is no extremum at (2, 1).
Example 17.11 Given the function
f(x, y) = 2x3 + 27x2 −60xy + 75y2,
(x, y) ∈R2.
1) Find the stationary points of the function.
2) Check for each of the stationary points if f has an extremum; when this is the case one should
indicate its type.
3) Find the range f(R2) of the function.
A Stationary points; extremum; range.
D Solve the equations of the stationary points. Check the behaviour of the function in a neighbour-
hood of the stationary points. Finally, consider the restriction of f to the X axis.

i.e.
−4x + 10y = 0.
We get by an addition that x2 + 5x = 0, so either x = 0 or x = −5. By insertion into the
latter equation we obtain the points (0, 0) and (−5, −2). These are also satisfying the former
equation, so the stationary points are (0, 0) and (−5, −2).

2) a) The value at (0, 0) is f(0, 0) = 0, and the approximating polynomial of at most second
degree is
P2(x, y)
=
27x2 −60xy + 75y2
=
2x2 + 25x2 −60xy + 36y2 + 39y2
=
2x2 + (5x −6y)2 + 39y2 > 0

hence f(x, y) has a local minimum at (0, 0).
Alternatively,

r = f ′′
xx(0, 0) = 54,

xy(0, 0) = −60,
f ′′
yy(x, y) = 150,
t = f ′′
yy(0, 0) = 150.
We conclude from rt = 54 · 150 > (−60)2 = s2, and r, t > 0, that f(x, y) has a proper
minimum at (0, 0).
b) At (−5, −2) we get
r = 12 · (−5) + 54 = −6,
s = −60,
t = 150.
It follows from rt < 0 < s2 that there is no extremum at (−5, −2).
Alternatively we put (x, y) = (h −5, k −2), from which
f(x, y)
=
2x3 + 27x2 −60xy + 75y2

The approximating polynomial of at most second degree in (h, k) is
P2(h, k) = −3h2 −60hk + 75k2 + 125.
Since this expression attains values both > and < 125 in any neighbourhood of (h, k) =
(0, 0), it follows that (−5, −2) is not an extremum.
3) By taking the restriction of f to the X axis we get
ϕ(x) = f(x, 0) = 2x3 + 27x2 = x2{2x + 27},
x ∈R.
Since already ϕ(R) = R, we conclude that
f(R2) = R.

Figure 17.11: The domain A.
I 1) It follows immediately from x2 + y2 ≤16 = 42 that A lies inside the disc of centrum (0, 0) and
radius 4.
We rearrange 16 −6y ≤x2 + y2 as
25 = x2 + y2 + 6y + 9 = z2 + (y + 3)2.
Then we can see that A lies outside the disc of centrum (0, −3) and radius 5.
The domain is the half moon shaped region on the ﬁgure.
It is closed and bounded and
connected. The boundary clearly consists of two circular arcs which intersect at the points
(−4, 0) and (4, 0).

(x2+y212)2

(x2+y2+12)2
= 0.
Here y = −8 is not possible in A, so we get x = 0 from the ﬁrst equation. When this put into

y = −8 ±

neither of the two candidates (0, −8 ±

stationary point in A.
3) Since f is continuous on A, and A is closed and bounded, it follows from the second main
theorem for continuous functions that the range f(A) is closed and bounded.
Since A is also connected, cf. the ﬁgure, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous
functions, that the range is connected.
Since f(A) ⊂R, it follows from the above that f(A) is a closed interval, i.e.
f(A) = [M, S],
where M denotes the minimum and S denotes the maximum of f in A, because these exist
according to the second main theorem.

Examples of global and local extrema
The maximum and the minimum must be found among the values at
a) the exceptional points (where f is not diﬀerentiable; there are none of them here),
b) the stationary points (none of the either),
c) the points on the boundary.
It follows that both the maximum and the minimum shall be found on the boundary.
Investigation of the boundary. The boundary is naturally split up into
a) x2 + y2 = 16, where y ∈[0, 4], (cf. the ﬁgure),
b) x2 + (y + 3)2 = 25, i.e. x2 = 25 −(y + 3)2, where y ∈[0, 2].
Now, x only occurs in the form x2 in f(x, y). It is therefore natural to eliminate x2 and use y
as a parameter.
a) The restriction of f(x, y) to x2 + y2 = 16, y ∈[0, 4], is given by
g(y) = y + 8
28 ,
y ∈[0+, 4].
Clearly, g(y) is increasing in this interval, so the candidates are
g(0) = f(±4, 0) = 8
28 = 2
7,
g(4) = f(0, 4) = 12
28 = 3
7.
b) The restriction of f(x, y) to x2 + (y + 3)2 = 25, y ∈[0, 2], is
h(y) =
y+8
37+y2−(y+3)2 =
y+8
28−6y,
y ∈[0, 2].
Both the numerator and the denominator are positive in the given interval.
Further-
more, when y increases, then the numerator increases too, while the denominator decreases.
Hence, h(y) is increasing with the values at the end points
h(0) = f(±4, 0) = 2
7,
h(2) = 10
16 = 5
8.
Alternatively,
h′(y) = (28−y2−6y) · 1−(y+8)(−2y−6)
(28−y2−6y)2
= y2+28y+76
(28−y2−6y)2 > 0
for y ∈[0, 2],
hence h(y) is increasing.
By a numerical comparison we get M = 2

Examples of extremum for three variables
Example 17.13 Find in each of the following cases the stationary points of the given function
f : R3 →R.
Then check if f in these points has an extremum; whenever this is the case check if it is a maximum
or a minimum.
1) f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 + xyz.
2) f(x, y, z) = x3 + y3 + z3 + xyz.
3) f(x, y, z) = x4 + y4 + z4 −4xyz.
4) f(x, y, z) = x cos z + y2.
5) f(x, y, z) = exp(xy + yz + zx).
6) f(x, y, z) = y3 + ln(1 + x2 + z2).
A Stationary points; extrema in three variables.
D Compute ∂f
∂x, ∂f
∂y , ∂f
∂z ; then ﬁnd the stationary points; ﬁnally check if there are any extrema.

When we multiply the equations of (17.4) we get a necessary condition of stationary points,
xyz = −1
8(xyz)2,
i.e.
xyz{xyz + 8} = 0.
Then either xyz = 0 or xyz = −8 = (−2)3.
a) If xyz = 0, then one of the factors must be 0. Assume that x = 0. Then it follows from
(17.4) that y = z = 0.
Analogously, if we assume that y = 0 or z = 0.
Summarizing we get in this case that (0, 0, 0) is a stationary point.

b) If xyz = 0, then all three factors are = 0. By insertion of the latter equation into (17.4),
we get
y = −1
2 xz = +1
4 x2y,
hence x2 = 4.
Analogously we get y2 = 4 and z2 = 4, so the candidates shall be found among (±2, ±2, ±2)
with all possible combinations of the signs. By a simple test in (17.4) we see that we in this
case get the stationary points
(2, 2, −2),
(2, −2, 2),
(−2, 2, 2),
(−2, −2, −2).
Summarizing we have the ﬁve stationary points
(0, 0, 0),
(2, 2, −2),
(2, −2, 2),
(−2, 2, 2),
(−2, −2, −2).
i) The point (0, 0, 0) is a proper minimum, because
P2(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2
is positive in any dotted neighbourhood of (0, 0, 0).
Insertion. Note that
∂2f
∂x2 = ∂2f
∂y2 = ∂2f
∂z2 = 2,
∂2f
∂x∂y = z,
∂2f
∂y∂z = x,
∂2f
∂z∂x = y,
so the approximating polynomial P2(x, y, z) from an expansion point (x0, y0, z0) is
P2(x, y, z)
=
f(x0, y0, z0) + (x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 + (x −z0)2
+z0(x−x0)(y−y0)+x0(y−y0)(z−z0)
+y0(z−z0)(x−x0).
When |x0| = |y0| = |z0| = 2 and x0y0z0 = −8, then either one or three of the factors
are negative. ♦
ii) Assume that only one of the factors is negative. Due to the symmetry we can assume
that z0 = −2, hence x0 = y0 = 2. Then
P2(x, y, z)
=
f(x0, y0, z0) + (x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 + (z −z0)2
+2(x −x0)(y −y0) + 2(y −y0)(z −z0)
+ 2(x −x0)(z −z0) −4(x −x0)(y −y0)
=
f(x0, y0, z0) + {(x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 + (z −z0)}2
−4(x −x0)(y −y0).
In the plane z −z0 = −(x −x0) −(y −y0) the term
−4(x −x0)(y −y0)
is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of (x0, y0), so (x0, y0, z0) = (2, 2, −2)
is not an extremum.
It follows from the symmetry that neither (2, −2, 2) nor (−2, 2, 2) are extrema.

iii) If (x0, y0, z0) = (−2, −2, −2), then
P2(x, y, z)
=
f(−2, −2, −2) + (x + 2)2 + (y + 2)2 + (z + 2)2
−2(x + 2)(y + 2) −2(y + 2)(z + 2) −2(z + 2)(x + 2)
=
f(−2, −2, −2) + (x + 2)2 + (y + 2)2 + (z + 2)2
−2(x + 2)(y + 2) + 2(y + 2)(z + 2) −2(z + 2)(x + 2) −4(y + 2)(z + 2)
=
f(−2, −2, −2) + {−(x + 2) + (y + 2) + (z + 2)}2 −4(y + 2)(z + 2).
We see that in the plane x + 2 = (y + 2) + (z + 2) the term −4(y + 2)(z + 2) is both
positive and negative in any neighbourhood of (y, z) = (−2, −2), so (−2, −2, −2) is not
an extremum.
The conclusion is that only (0, 0, 0) is an extremum (a proper minimum).


yz = −3x2 ≤0,

From (17.5) we get the necessary condition
(yz) · (zx) · (xy) = (xyz)2 = −27(xyz)2
for a stationary point. The only possibility is xyz = 0. Since e.g. x = 0 implies that y = z = 0,
and analogously for y = 0 and z = 0, it follows that (0, 0, 0) is the only stationary point.
There is no extremum at(0, 0, 0), because e.g. f(x, 0, 0) = x3 is both positive and negative in
any neighbourhood of x0 = 0.

so
(17.6)


yz = x3,
xz = y3,
xy = z3.
We get the following necessary condition for the stationary points
(yz) · (xz) · (xy) = (xyz)2 = (xyz)3,
i.e. either xyz = 0 or xyz = 1.
a) If xyz = 0, then e.g. x = 0, which immediately implies that y = z = 0. Analogously, if we
assume y = 0 or z = 0. In this case we get the stationary point (0, 0, 0).

b) If xyz = 1, it follows from the ﬁrst equation of (17.6) that
xyz = 1 = x4,
i.e. x = ±1. Analogously we get y = ±1 and z = ±1. Therefore, the stationary points
should be searched among (±1, ±1, ±1) with all possible eight combinations of the signs.
By insertion into (17.6), i.e. testing these points, we ﬁnd the stationary points
(1, 1, 1),
(1, −1, 1),
(−1, 1, −1),
(−1, −1, 1).
Summarizing we ﬁnd that the function has ﬁve stationary points,
(0, 0, 0),
(1, 1, 1),
(1, −1, −1),
(−1, 1, −1),
(−1, −1, 1).
We shall in the following check each of them considering extremum.
a) The point (0, 0, 0) is not an extremum, because −4xyz is the dominating term in a dotted
neighbourhood of (0, 0, 0), and −4xyz is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood
of (0, 0, 0).
Insertion. It follows from
∂2f
∂x2 = 12x2,
∂2f
∂y2 = 12y2,
∂2f
∂z2 = 12z2,
∂2f
∂x∂y = −4z,
∂2f
∂y∂z = −4x,
∂2f
∂x∂z = −4y,
that the approximating polynomial at a stationary point (x0, y0, z0) = (0, 0, 0) [of course
also at (0, 0, 0), but this is not relevant here] is given by
P2(x, y, z)
=
f(x0, y0, z0)+6{x2
0(x−x0)2+y2
0(y−y0)2+z2
0(z−z0)2}
−4z0(x −x0)(y −y0) −4x0(y −y0)(z −z0) −4y0(x −x0)(z −z0).
When |x0| = |y0| = |z0| = 1, this is written
P2(x, y, z)
=
f(x0, y0, z0) + 2{(x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 + (z −z0)2}
+2

[z0(x −x0)]2 −2z0(x −x0)(y −y0) + (y −y0)2

+2

[y0(x −x0)]2 −2y0(x −x0)(z −z0) + (x −x0)2
,
where we have used that. By a rearrangement,
P2(x, y, z) −f(x0, y0, z0)
=

(x −x0)2 + (y −y0)2 + (z −z0)2
+ 2{z0(x −x0) −(y −y0)}2
(17.7)
+2{x0(y −y0) −(z −z0)}2 + 2{y0(x −x0) −(z −z0)}2.
b) In the latter four stationary points the approximating polynomial is given by (17.7). It
follows from this expression that they are all proper minima.
Summarizing we get that
(1, 1, 1),
(1, −1, −1),
(−1, 1, −1),
(−1, −1, 1)
are all proper minima, while (0, 0, 0) is not an extremum.

4) The equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x = cos z = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y = 0,

= 0. Since the restriction
f(x, 0, z) = x cos z
is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of any such point, none of them is an
extremum.
5) If f(x, y, z) = exp(xy + yz + zx), then f(x, y, z) > 0, and the equations of the stationary points
are

∂f
∂y = (z + x)f(x, y, z) = 0,
∂f

i.e.
(17.8)



y + z = 0,
z + x = 0,
x + y = 0.
The system (17.8) has only the solution x = y = z = 0, so (0, 0, 0) is the only stationary point.
By a Taylor expansion,
f(x, y, z)
=
exp(xy + yz + zx)
=
1 + xy + yz + xz + (x2 + y2 + z2)ε(x, y, z),
where ε(x, y, z) →0 for (x, y, z) →(0, 0, 0). Hence
P2(x, y, z) = 1 + xy + yz + zx,
where e.g.
P2(x, y, 0) −1 = xy
attains both positive and negative values in any neighbourhood of (x, y) = (0, 0). Thus there
is no extremum at (0, 0, 0).
6) If f(x, y, z) = y3 + ln(1 + x2 + z2), the equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x =
2x
1 + x2 + z2 = 0,
∂f
∂y = 3y2 = 0,
∂f
∂z =
2z
1 + x2 + z2 = 0.
It follows that (0, 0, 0) is the only stationary point. The restriction f(0, y, 0) = y3 is both
positive and negative in any neighbourhood of y0 = 0, so there is no extremum at (0, 0, 0).

A Stationary points; extrema.
D Find the possible stationary points; check if they are extrema.
I The function can by continuity be extended to its zero set. This is the surface of the tetrahedron on
the ﬁgure, and it is obvious that f(x, y, z) > 0 in the open tetrahedron. The function must have
a maximum in the tetrahedron, according to the second main theorem for continuous functions,
and because f(x, y, z) is of class C∞, this maximum can only be attained at a stationary point in
the interior of the tetrahedron.

∂f
∂z = xy(4a −x −y −2z) = 0.
It follows from the assumptions x > 0, y > 0 and z > 0 that these equations are equivalent to



x = 4a −x −y −z,
y = 4a −x −y −z,
z = 4a −x −y −z,
and it follows immediately that
x = 4a −x −y −z = y = z = a.
Hence, (a, a, a) is the only stationary point in the ﬁrst octant.
It follows from the application of the second main theorem above that we have a maximum at
(a, a, a), and the value of the function is here
f(a, a, a) = a4.
Alternatively we compute
∂2f
∂x2 = −2yz,
∂2f
∂y2 = −2xz,
∂2f
∂z2 = −2xy,

hence

∂y2 (a, a, a) = ∂2f
∂z2 (a, a, a) = −2a2,
∂2f
∂y∂z(a, a, a) = ∂2f
∂x∂z (a, a, a) = ∂2f
∂x∂z (a, a, a) = −a2.
Now f(a, a, a) = a4, so

Example 17.15 Let f : Rk →R be a polynomial of second degree. Prove that f has none or one or
inﬁnitely many stationary points.
Then give for k = 2 examples of all three possibilities.
A Stationary points.

I A general polynomial of second degree in Rk is of the form

The equations of the stationary points are
∂f

i=1
(aim + ami)xi + bm = 0,
m = 1, . . . , k,
i.e. a system of k linear equations in k unknowns. It is known from Linear Algebra that such a
system of equations has none or one or an inﬁnity of solutions, and the claim is proved.
Let k = 2, and denote the variables by (x, y).
If f(x, y) = x2 + y2, we clearly have (0, 0) as the only stationary point.
If f(x, y) = y2, then we clearly have inﬁnitely many stationary points, namely (x, 0) for x ∈R.
Finally, let f(x, y) = (x + y)2 + x −y. Then the equations of the de stationary points are
∂f
∂x = 2(x + y) + 1 = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2(x + y) −1 = 0.
This system of equations clearly has no solution.
A simpler system is
f(x, y) = x2 + y,
where ∂f
∂y = 1 = 0 for every (x, y). The structure is the same as in the example above. The
diﬀerence is that both x2 and y2 occur in the former example, so the polynomial is of second
degree in both x and y. This is not the case in the latter example.

A Maximum and minimum for continuous functions on closed and bounded (i.e. compact) sets.
D Apply the second main theorem. Sketch the domain. Apply that the maximum and the minimum
are either attained at an exception point or in a stationary point of on the boundary.
I All functions are continuous on a closed and bounded set,so by the second main theorem for con-
tinuous functions the function has both a maximum and a minimum on the set.
With 1) as the only exception, all the rest of the functions are of class C∞in the interior of
their respective domains. We shall therefore in all these cases only ﬁnd the stationary points and
examine the boundary.
In 1) the function is continuous everywhere, and not diﬀerentiable at (0, 0), so this is an exceptional
point.

The latter possibility is rejected, because

x2 + 3y2 ≤2 in the given domain. We conclude
that we necessarily have y = 0, whenever we have a stationary point, if any.
When y = 0 is put into the former equation of the stationary points we get
8 x
|x| = 5,
which is never fulﬁlled. We conclude that there is no stationary point in the domain.
c) Examination of the boundary. On the boundary, x2 + 3y2 = 4, hence
y2 = 1

x ∈[−2, 2].
When x ∈[−2, 2] is used as a parameter, we get along the boundary

The maximum in the interval [−2, 2] is obtained for x = −2, corresponding to
f(−2, 0) = 16 + 10 = 26,
and the minimum for x = 2, corresponding to
f(2, 0) = 16 −10 = 6.
d) Numerical comparison. Summarizing the maximum and the minimum are included in
the values
f(−2, 0) = 26,
f(0, 0) = 0,
f(x, 0) = 6.
It follows that
S = f(−2, 0) = 26

M = f(0, 0) = 0
(minimum).

a) Exception points. The function is everywhere of class C∞, so there are no exception
points.
b) Stationary points. The equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x = 2x −3y = 0,
∂f
∂y = −6y −3x = 0,
and it follows that (0, 0) is the only stationary point in the domain.
The value of the
function is here
f(0, 0) = 0.
c) Examination of the boundary. We shall use the following parametric description of
the boundary,
x = cos ϕ,
y = sin ϕ,
ϕ ∈[0, 2π[,
hence by insertion,
g(ϕ)

f(x, y) = x2 −3y2 −3xy = cos2 ϕ −3 sin2 ϕ −3 cos ϕ · sin ϕ

Now cos(2ϕ + ϕ0) goes twice through the interval [−1, 1], when ϕ goes through [0, 2π[, and

d) Numerical comparison.

b) Examination of the boundary.
i) If y = 0, then the restriction
f(x, 0) = −3 ln x,
x ∈[1, 5],
is monotonous with its maximum f(1, 0) = 0 and its minimum f(5, 0) = −3 ln 5.
ii) If x = 1, then the restriction
f(1, y) = y2 −4y,
y ∈[1, 4]
has the maximum f(1, 0) = f(1, 4) = 0 and the minimum f(1, 2) = −4.
iii) If y = 5 −x, then
f(x, 5 −x)
=
x(5 −x) + (5 −x)2 −5(5 −x) −3 ln x

f(1, 0) = f(1, 4) = 0,
f(1, 2) = −4,
f(1, 4) = 0,
f(5, 0) = −3 ln 5.
The maximum is clearly
f(1, 0) = f(1, 4) = 0.
By using a pocket calculator we then get approximately,

It is easy to ﬁnd the three stationary points
(0, 0),
(0, 3 +
√
3)
and
(0, 3 −
√
3),
where (0, 0) is not an extremum, while (0, 3 +
√
3) is a minimum point, and (0, 3 −
√
3) is a
maximum point. The function values are then
f(0, 3 +
√
3) = −36 −24
√
3,
f(0, 3 −

Stationary points. We get by diﬀerentiation
∂f
∂x = 2x(x2 + y2 −6y) + 2x(x2 + y2 −2y) = 4x(x2 + y2 −4y)
and
∂f
∂y
=
(2y −2)(x2 + y2 −6y) + (2y −6)(x2 + y2 −2y)
=
(2y −4)(x2 + y2 −6y) + 2(x2 + y2 −6y)
+(2y −4)(x2 + y2 −2y) −2(x2 + y2 −2y)
=
4(y −2)(x2 + y2 −4y) −8y
=
4

(y −2)(x2 + y2 −4y) −2y

.
The two equations for the stationary points are
(17.9)
 x(x2 + y2 −4y) = 0,
(y −2)(x2 + y2 −4y) = 2y.
It follows from the former equation that the stationary points either lie on the line x = 0 or on
the circle x2 + (y −2)2 = 22
a) If x = 0, it follows from the latter equation that
0 = (y −2)(y2 −4y) −2y = y{(y −2)(y −4) −2} = y{y2 −6y + 6},
which has the two solutions y = 0 and y = 3±
√
3. Thus we get in this case three stationary
points
(0, 0),
(0, 3 +
√
3)
and
(0, 3 −
√
3).

b) If x2 + y2 −4y = 0, it follows from the latter equation of (17.9) that y = 0, and thus x = 0,
so we ﬁnd again (0, 0).
Summarizing we get the three stationary points
(0, 0),
(0, 3 +
√
3)
and
(0, 3 −
√
3).
Remark. Since we are searching the maximum and the minimum (and not the extrema), it is
suﬃcient to calculate the value of the function in these points, and e.g. the (r, s, t)-investigation
is totally superﬂuous (and a waste of time). ♦

and analogously

Examination of the boundary. We have on the boundary x2 + y2 = 36, so
f(x, y)
=
(x2 + y2 −2y)(x2 + y2 −6y)
=
(36 −2y)(36 −6y)
=
12(18 −y)(6 −y),
for y ∈[−6, 6],
where the maximum is
f(0, −6) = 12 · 24 · 12 = 3456,
and the minimum is f(0, 6) = 0.
Numerical comparison. Since f(0, 3 +
√
3) < 0, the maximum and the minimum of the
function in the domain are respectively,
S = f(0, −6) = 3456
and
M = f(0, 3 +
√
3) = −36 −24
√
3.
Alternative solution. The argument of the second main theorem concerning the existence
of the maximum and the minimum is the same as above.
Write the function f in the following way:
f(x, y)
=
(x2 + y2 −2y)(x2 + y2 −6y)
=

x2 + (y −1)2 −1
 
x2 + (y −3)2 −32
,
and discuss the sign of f in the domain, i.e. sketch the zero sets (the circles of respectively
centrum (0, 1) and radius 1, and of centrum (0, 3) and radius 3) inside the domain and ﬁnd the
signs in each of the thus deﬁned subregions.
The function is positive inside the two sets of zero circles and also outside the same two sets
of circles, while it is negative between the two zero circles.

It follows immediately that the minimum must lie between the two sets of zero circles, i.e. in
the set
K((0, 3); 3) \ K((0, 1); 1) = A1,
and also that the minimum point must be a stationary point, because A1 is open. Because
3 −
√
3 < 2 = 1 + 1, we see that (0, 3 +
√
3) is the only stationary point in A >1, so the
mininimum is (originally only a local minimum)
f(0, 3 +
√
3) = −36 −24
√
3.
It follows in the same way that (0, 3 −
√
3) ∈A2 = K((0, 1); 1) must be a local maximum
f(0, 3 −
√
3) = −36 + 24
√
3.
Finally by using polar coordinates in the plane,
f(x, y)
=
(r2 −2r sin ϕ)(r2 −6r sin ϕ)
=
r2(r −2 sin ϕ)(r −6 sin ϕ),
0 ≤r ≤6.
In the remaining region A3 both factors are positive, so
r −2 sin ϕ > 0
og
r −6 sin ϕ > 0.
The product is largest when sin ϕ is smallest, i.e. when ϕ = −π
2 , thus sin ϕ = −1, corresponding
to
f(x, y) = r2(r + 2)(r + 6),
0 ≤r ≤6.
This product is largest when r is largest, i.e. when r = 6 (the boundary), corresponding to
(x, y) = (0, −6), and
f(0, −6) = 3456.
When we compare with the other candidate above we conclude that the maximum in A is
f(0, −6) = 3456.

5) In this case it is diﬃcult to sketch the domain because the hyperbola xy = 32 is very steep in
the neighbourhood of (1, 32), and very ﬂat in the neighbourhood of (32, 1). It is demonstrated
on the ﬁgure what MAPLE does in this case.
The domain is bounded by the hyperbola xy = 32 and the lines x = 1 and y = 1.
a) Stationary points. The stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = y −64
x2 = 0
and

y2 = 0.

From these we get
64
x = xy = 64
y ,
so the stationary points lie on the line y = x. Then by insertion x3 = 64 = 43, and thus
x = y = 4. We conclude from
x = 4 ≥1,
y = 4 ≥1
and
xy = 16 ≤32,
that we have the stationary point (4, 4) in the domain. The value of the function is here
f(4, 4) = 16 + 16 + 16 = 48.
Note that we shall not check if (4, 4) is an extremum.
b) Examination of the boundary.
i) We get along the boundary curve xy = 32, x ∈[1, 32], that y = 32
x , and the correspond-
ing restriction is

for x ∈[1, 32],
where

for x =

corresponding to a minimum. The y-value is y =

32 =

function at the point (

2.
At the end points of xy = 32, x ∈[1, 32], we get the values
f(1, 32) = f(32, 1) = 32 + 64 + 64
32 = 98.
ii) We get along the boundary curve y = 1, x ∈[1, 32], the following restriction
h(x) = f(x, 1) = x + 64
x + 64,
where
h′(x) = 1 −64
x2 = 0
for x = 8,
corresponding to a minimum
f(8, 1) = 8 + 64
8 + 64 = 80.
At the end points we get

and
f(32, 1) = 32 + 2 + 64 = 98.

iii) Due to the symmetry we get along the boundary curve x = 1 that the minimum is
f(1, 8) = 80,
and that the values at the end points are
f(1, 1) = 129
and
f(1, 32) = 98.
iv) Numerical comparison. Summarizing the minimum is one of the values
f(4, 4) = 48,
f(

f(1, 8) = f(8, 1) = 80.

M = f(4, 4) = 48.
Analogously the maximum is one of the numbers
f(1, 1) = 129
and
f(1, 32) = f(32, 1) = 98,
hence the maximum is
S = f(1, 1) = 129.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

a) Stationary points. the stationary points are the solutions of the equations
(17.10)





∂f
∂x = 6x −2y −4xy2 = 0,
∂f
∂y = 6y −2x −4x2y = 0.
When we add the two equations we get the following necessary condition
0
=
4x + 4y −4xy2 −4x2y
=
4{(x + y) −xy(x + y)}
=
4(x + y)(1 −xy),
so either x + y = 0 (not possible in this domain) or xy = 1,
Analogously it follows from (17.10) that
4x2y2 = 6x2 −2xy = 6y2 −2xy,
hence x2 = y2, which together with xy = 1 and x > 0 give x = y = 1. The only possibility
is (1, 1), and by insertion into (17.10) we get that (1, 1) is a stationary point. Furthermore,
we see that (1, 1) belongs to the domain. The value of the function at the point is
f(1, 1) = 3 + 3 −2 −2 = 2.
b) Examination of the boundary. On the boundary curve x2 + y2 = 4 we shall use the
parametric description

Here sin 2ϕ ∈[0, 1] for 2ϕ ∈[0, π], so the maximum of g(ϕ) if obtained for sin 2ϕ = 0, i.e.

Alternatively we see that z = xy runs through the interval [0, 2], when (x, y) runs
through the arc of the quarter circle. This means that
g1(z) = f(x, y) = 3x2 + 3y2 −2xy(1 + xy) = 12 −2z(1 + z),
which is largest in the interval [0, 2], when z = 0, which corresponds to (x, y) = (2, 0) or
(0, 2), and smallest when z = 2, which corresponds to (x, y) = (
√

For x = 0 we get the restriction h(y) = f(0, y) = 3y2 with the minimum f(0, 0) = 0 and
the maximum
f(0, 2) = f(2, 0) = 12,
and where we exploit the symmetry of x and y.

from the latter equation,
e−y(2e−y + sin x) = 0.

8) The domain is the disc of centrum (0, 0) and radius 2.
a) Stationary points. The stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = 4x3 −2x + 2y = 0,
∂f
∂y = 4y3 + 2x −2y = 0,
hence 4x3 = 2x −2y = −4y3, i.e. y = −x.
We get by insertion
0 = 4x3 −4x = 4x(x2 −1),
so we have the possibilities x = 0, 1, −1, corresponding to the candidates
(0, 0),
(1, −1),
and
(−1, 1)
of the stationary points. It follows by insertion (i.e. by testing) that they are actually all
stationary points. The values of the function are here
f(0, 0) = 0
and
f(1, −1) = f(−1, 1) = 1 + 1 −1 −2 −1 = −2.
b) Examination of the boundary. On the boundary x2 + y2 = 4,
f(x, y)
=
x4 + y4 −x2 + 2xy −y2
=
(x2 + y2)2 −2x2y2 −(x2 + y2) + 2xy
=
12 + 2xy(1 −xy).
i) First alternative. We get by the parametric description
x = 2 cosϕ,
y = 2 sin ϕ,
ϕ ∈[0, 2π[,
that
g1(ϕ)
=
f(x, y) = 12 + 2xy(1 −xy)

One is not asked of where the maximum is attained, so here is added that it is the value of
the function at the points given by (17.11).
The minimum is
M = min{−2, 0} = −2.
It is the value of the functions in the points (−1, 1) and (1, −1).

hence
−3x2 = y2 −8y = 9y2 −48y.
This is again reduced to
8y2 −40y = 8y(y −5) = 0.
Now y > 0, thus y = 5 ∈]0, 8[, hence x2 = 16y −3y2 = 80 −75 = 5, or (since x > 0),
x =

5 ∈]0, 4[. When we put (x, y) = (

∂f
∂x = 5(40 −25 −15) = 0,
∂f
∂y =

b) Examination of the boundary. It follows from
f(x, y) = xy(8y −y2 −x2),
that f(0, y) = f(x, 0) = 0.
The restriction on the boundary curve x = 4, y ∈[0, 8], is
g(y) = −4y(16 −8y + y2) = −4y(y −4)2

and f(4, 4) = 0, and at the end points
f(4, 0) = 0,
f(4, 8) = −32 · 16 = −512.
The restriction to the boundary curve y = 8, x ∈[0, 4], is
h(x) = 8x(64 −64 −x2) = −8x3,
which clearly takes its maximum for x = 0 and minimum for x = 4, corresponding to the
maximum f(0, 8) = 0 and the minimum f(4, 8) = −512.

Example 17.17 We shall construct a cage for transportation of poultry from a board of the length 6
dm and the breadth b dm. The board is broken at two places and then a net of steel wire is stretched
over it. Finally, two additional boards are added so that one gets a cage of a cross section of an
equilateral trapeze. We want to break the given board in such a way that the volume of the cage V dm3
becomes as large as possible.
First prove that
V (x, y) = (6 −2x −x cos y)bx sin y.
Then explain why the function V shall only be considered on the set [0, 3] ×

. Finally, ﬁnd the
maximum of the volume and the corresponding set (x, y) of coordinates.
A Maximum.
D Analyze the text. Check the model and ﬁnd the maximum.
By cutting the trapeze (chop oﬀthe two triangles, so one gets a rectangle) we get the height (i.e. the
breadth of the trapeze)
h(x, y) = x · sin(π −y) = x · sin y.
Figure 17.13: The skew lines are each of the length x, and the two obtuse angles are each of the size
y.
Then compute the area,
A(x, y)

(6 −2x)(h(x, y) + 2 · 1

Remark. It follows from the sign of the latter term that the areas of the corners are counted
negatively, when y ∈

It follows from the above that the volume is
V (x, y) = b A(x, y) = {(6x −2x2) sin y −x2 sin y cos y}b.
Since x ≥0 and 6 −2x ≥0, we must have x ∈[0, 3].
We can clearly choose y in the interval [0, π]; but since we shall ﬁnd a maximum, we must have
−x2 sin y cos y ≥0, so y ∈

Example 17.18 Check in each of the following cases if the given function has a maximum or a
minimum or both or none of the kind. If it has a maximum or a minimum give the value of the
function at these points.
1) f(x, y) = (x + y) exp(−x2 −y2) for (x, y) ∈R2.
2) f(x, y) = xy exp(−x2 −y2) for (x, y) ∈R2.
3) f(x, y) = exp(x2 −y2) −x2 −y2 for (x, y) ∈R2.
4) f(x, y) = exp(x2 + y2) −4xy for (x, y) ∈R2.
[cf. Example 17.20]
5) f(x, y) =
1 + x2
x2 + y2 −2y −3 for x2 + y2 < 2y + 3.
6) f(x, y) = x3 + 2y3 for (x, y) ∈R2.
7) f(x, y) = 3xy + ln(1 −x2 −y2) for x2 + y2 < 1.
8) f(x, y) = x2 −2x + y2 + 3y + 5 for x2 + y2 < 5.
9) f(x, y) = x + tanh y for x2 + y2 < 2.
10) f(x, y) = x2y −2x2 + 4y2 for |x| < 2 og |y| < 1.
11) f(x, y) = (7x2 + 4xy) exp(−y2) for |x| < 1.
A Extrema in open domain of C∞-functions.
D Find the stationary points, if any. Check if they are extrema. Check also f(x, y), when (x, y) tends
towards the boundary or towards ∞in the sense x2 + y2 →+∞.
I 1) The domain is R2. It follows from the diﬀerent magnitudes of the terms that
f(x, y) = (x + y) exp(−x2 −y2) →0
for x2 + y2 →+∞.
The stationary points are found by solving the equations
∂f
∂x
=
exp(−x2 −y2) −2x(x + y) exp(−x2 −y2)
=
{1 −2x(x + y)} exp(−x2 −y2) = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
{1 −2y(x + y)} exp(−x2 −y2) = 0,
where we get the latter equation by a symmetric argument.
We conclude from the equations above that
2x(x + y) = 1 = 2y(x + y),
hence x = 0, y = 0, x + y = 0 and y = x, so 4x2 = 1. This implies that the stationary points

2) It follows from the rules of magnitudes that

Remark. Even though it is superﬂuous, we shall nevertheless for the exercise show how the
possible stationary points are found. The corresponding equations are
∂f
∂x
=
2x{exp(x2 −y2) −1} = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
−2y{exp(x2 −y2) + 1} = 0.
It follows from the latter equation that y = 0, which put into the former one gives
2x{exp(x2) −1} = 0.
This equation is only fulﬁlled for x = 0, hence (0, 0) is the only stationary point. The value of
the function is here f(0, 0) = 0, and it is obvious that f(x, y) can be both positive and negative
in any neighbourhood of (0, 0), so there exists no point in which a maximum or a minimum
can be attained. ♦
4) It follows from the rules of magnitudes that
f(x, y) = exp(x2 + y2) −4xy →+∞
for x2 + y2 →+∞,
and the function does not have a maximum.
The possible stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x
=
2x exp(x2 + y2) −4y = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
2y exp(x2 + y2) −4x = 0.
These equations are reduced to
(17.14)
 x exp(x2 + y2) = 2y,
y exp(x2 + y2) = 2x.
We get by adding these equations,
(x + y) exp(x2 + y2) = 2(x + y).
It follows from (17.14) that x and y must either be of the same sign or be 0. Therefore, if
x + y = 0, then (x, y) = (0, 0).
If x + y = 0, we get x2 + y2 = ln 2. It follows in this case from (17.14) that
x2 exp(x2 + y2) = 2xy = y2 exp(x2 + y2),
so x2 = y2, or y = x. The stationary points = (0, 0) are then satisfying
x2 + y2 = 2x2 = ln 2,
i.e.
x = y = ±

Clearly, the function
f(x, y) =

x2 + y2 −2y −3,
x2 + y2 < 2y + 3,
tends towards −∞, when (x, y) tends to the circle x2 +(y −1)2 = 4 from the inside. Therefore,
the minimum does not exist.

and
y −1 = 0,

hence y = 1 and x = 0. The only stationary point is the centre of the circle (0, 1). This
must necessarily be a maximum, because the maximum exists, and it can only be attained at
a stationary point (because the function is of class C∞). Hence the maximum is
S = f(0, 1) = −1
4.
Remark 1. One can also ﬁnd the maximum in the following way without any calculation. Note
that the numerator is positive, and the denominator is negative everywhere in the domain.
Hence, we shall make the numerator as small as possible (for x = 0), and the denominator
numerically as big as possible. The denominator can be written (x −0)2 + (y −1)2 −4, so this
situation occurs for (x, y) = (0, 1). Since the optimum possibility for both the numerator and
the denominator occurs for at least x = 0, we conclude that (0, 1) is a maximum point and
that the maximum is
S = f(0, 1) = −1
4.
♦
Remark 2. Another possible solution is the following: If x is kept ﬁxed, then
f(x, y) = −
1 + x2
4 −x2 −(y −1)2
is largest when y = 1, and (x, 1) belongs to the domain, so the only condition on x is |x| < 2.

Then the task is reduced to ﬁnding the maximum of
f(x, 1) = x2 + 1
x2 −4 = 1 +

for x2 ∈[0, 4[.
This is obtained for x = 0, so the maximum is

6) The function f(x, y) = x3 + 2y3 has neither a maximum nor a minimum in R2, because
f(x, 0) = x3 →
 +∞
for x →+∞,
−∞
for x →−∞.
We mention – though it is not necessary – that (0, 0) is the only stationary point.
7) Clearly, the function
f(x, y) = 3xy + ln(1 −x2 −y2),
x2 + y2 < 1,
tends towards −∞, when (x, y) is approaching the boundary x2 + y2 = 1 of the unit disc (from
the inside). Therefore, the function has no minimum.
Clearly, it has a maximum, because it is continuous on every closed subset of the open unit
disc. We may choose this subset such that f(x, y) = −C on the boundary of the subset, where
C > 0 is any c positive constant. According to the second main theorem, f has a maximum on
the closed subset, and since f(0, 0) = 0 > −C, we cannot have the maximum on the boundary.
Since f is of class C∞, the maximum must be attained at a stationary point.
The stationary points are the solutions of the equations
(17.15)


∂f
∂x = 3y −
2x
1 −x2 −y2 = 0,
∂f
∂y = 3x −
2y
1 −x2 −y2 = 0.
Clearly, (0, 0) is a stationary point. It is almost obvious (due to the variation of 3xy in a
neighbourhood of (0, 0)) that the maximum is not attained at (0, 0).
We shall then ﬁnd the stationary points = (0, 0), which must exist, cf. the discussion above.
According to (17.15), such stationary points must satisfy
3y2 =
2xy
1 −x2 −y2 = 3x2,
thus y2 = x2. It follows from xy > 0 that x and y must have the same sign, so we conclude
that y = x. By eliminating y we get
0 = 3y(1 −x2 −y2) −2x = x{3 −6x2 −2} = x{1 −6x2}.
Since x = 0, we get x = y = ± 1

The function f(x, y) has a continuous extension to the closure of the domain given by x2 +y2 ≤
5. It follows from the above that the maximum exists (the second main theorem) and since
there are no stationary points at hand, it must be attained at a boundary point. Then it follows
from the geometric interpretation above that the maximum is obtained at the intersection of
the line of the equation y = 3
2 x and the boundary given by x2 + y2 = 5 in the third quadrant.
This implies that the function does not have a maximum in the given open domain.

Remark 2. It should be obvious that if one did not use the geometric interpretation above,
then the task would give quite unpleasant computations. It is left to the reader to ﬁnd the
maximum on the boundary by inserting the parametric description
x =

y =

t ∈[0, 2π[.
♦
9) Clearly, the function f(x, y) = x+tanh y, x2+y2 < 2, has no stationary point (e.g. ∂f
∂x = 1 = 0),
and since the function is of class C∞, and the domain is open (i.e. without boundary points)
the function has neither a minimum nor a maximum in the domain.
10) Clearly, the function
f(x, y) = x2y −2x2 + 4y2,
|x| < 2, |y| < 1,
is of class C∞, so a possible maximum or minimum can only be attained at a stationary point.
The stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = 2xy −4x = 2x(y −2x) = 0,
∂f
∂y = x2 + 8y = 0.
It follows from the former equation that either x = 0 or y = 2x.
a) If x = 0, then we get y = 0 from the latter equation and (0, 0) is a stationary point.
b) If y = 2x is put into the latter equation, we get
0 = x2 + 16x = x(x + 16),
so either x = 0 (and y = 0 again as above) or x = −16. The latter is not possible inside
the domain.
The only stationary point is (0, 0). The value of the function is here
f(0, 0) = 0.
We conclude the task in the following way: The two restrictions
f(0, y) = 4y2,
|y| < 1,
and
f(x, 0) = −2x2,
|x| < 2,
attain both positive and negative values at any point close to (0, 0), hence f(0, 0) = 0 is neither
a maximum nor a minimum. Since (0, 0) is the only possibility of extremum, there does not
exist any.
Alternatively (the standard procedure) the function is extended continuously to the bound-
ary, and then we we continue by examining the values on the boundary.

Examples of global and local extrema
Even if we have not examined the remaining two boundary curves, we can ﬁnish the task now,
because (0, 0) is the only stationary point with the value of the function f(0, 0) = 0. The
boundary does not belong to the domain, and by continuous extensions we ﬁnd the values at
specially chosen boundary points
f(−2, −1) = −8 < f(0, 0) = 0 < f(0, 1) = 4.
Accordingly, f has neither a maximum nor a minimum in the open domain. In fact, due to the
continuity we can inside the domain obtain values of the function as close to −8 as well to 4
as we wish.
11) The function
f(x, y) = (7x2 + 4xy) exp(−y2),
|x| < 1,
is of class C∞, and it can be extended by the same deﬁnition to all of R2. This domain is open,
so a possible maximum or minimum can only be attained at a stationary point.
Possible stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = (14x + 4y) exp(−y2) = 0,
∂f
∂y = {4x −2y(7x2 + 4xy)} exp(−y2).
Now exp(−y2) = 0, so these equations are equivalent to
7x = −2y
and
x{2 −7xy −4y2} = 0.
If we only eliminate 7x in the term 7xy of the latter equation, we get
0 = x{2 + 2y2 −4y2} = 2x{1 −y2}.
Combining this with the equation 7x = −2y we get the possibilities
x = 0,
i.e. y = 0,
hence (x, y) = (0, 0),
y = 1,
i.e. x = −2

Examination of the boundary. As mentioned above the function can be extended to the
boundary. As f(−x, y) = f(x, y), it suﬃces to examine the restriction

y ∈R.

Example 17.19 Find in each of the following cases the largest volume of a rectangular box for which
the indicated condition is fulﬁlled.
1) The sum of the 12 edges is given equal to 12a.
2) The area of the surface of the box is given and equal to 6a2.
3) The length of the space diagonal of the box is given and equal to a.
A Maximum.
D Put the box into a rectangular coordinate system with one corner at (0, 0, 0) and where the cor-
responding edges lie along the axes in the positive sense, i.e. the box can be described as the
domain
[0, x] × [0, y] × [0, z].
Find the volume as a function of the edges. Exploit the condition in each sub-question to eliminate
one of the variables. Indicate the domain, in which the remaining edges can vary. Finally, ﬁnd the
maximum.
I When the lengths of the edges are x, y, z ≥0, then the volume is given by
V (x, y, z) = xyz.
1) The condition that the sum of the 12 edges is equal to 12a is written
4(x + y + z) = 12a,
i.e.
x + y + z = 3a.
Remark. For symmetrical reasons we may expect that the solution is given by x = y = z = a.
The remaining part of the task is to prove that this hunch in this case is correct. ♦
First eliminate z,
z = 3a −x −y ≥0,
i.e. x ≥0,
y ≥0,
x + y ≤3a.

By insertion we see that we shall ﬁnd the maximum of the function
f(x, y) = xy(3a −x −y),
x ≥0, y ≥0, x + y ≤3a.
We have f(x, y) > 0 in the interior of the triangle, and on we boundary we have f(x, y) = 0.
Now f(x, y) is of class C∞, so the maximum exists (second main theorem) and it can only be
attained at an interior stationary point.
The equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x
=
3ay −2xy −y2 = y(3a −2x −y) = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
x(3a −x −2y),
where we immediately get the latter expression by the symmetry.
Since x > 0 and y > 0 in the interior of the triangle A we get the reduced equations
2x + y = 3a
and
x + 2y = 3a,
and we ﬁnd (a we guessed) x = y = a. The only stationary point is (a, a) corresponding to
z = 3a −a −a = a, and as mentioned above this corresponds to a maximum,
S = V (a, a, a) = a3.
2) In this case the condition is
2(xy + yz + xz) = 6a2.

Remark. Due to the symmetry we may again expect the solution to be x = y = z = a. This
satisﬁes at least the condition. The remaining part of the task is to prove that also this hunch

Figure 17.19: The inﬁnite domain of the function in Example 17.19.2.
The volume function is given in this domain by
f(x, y) = xy · 3a2 −xy
x + y
= 3a2xy −x2y2
x + y
.
We conclude from
0 ≤f(x, y) ≤
y
x + y · 3a2 · x ≤x · 3a2,
that f(x, y) can be extended by continuity from the ﬁrst quadrant to the positive X and Y
axes supplied by the point (0, 0) by putting the value of the function equal to 0. We have
also the value 0 of the function of the branch of the hyperbola xy = 3a2 which lies in the ﬁrst
quadrant. Finally, f(x, y) →0, when either x →+∞or y →+∞inside the open domain.
Since f(x, y) > 0 is of class C∞in the open domain, it follows from the second main theorem
that f(x, y) has a maximum, which necessarily must be attained at a stationary point in the
interior of the domain.

Since x = 0, y = 0 and x + y = 0 in the interior of the domain, these equations are reduced to
x2 + 2xy = 3a2,
y2 + 2xy = 3a2,
accordingly x2 = y2, or y = x, because both x and y are positive. This implies that 3x2 = 3a2,
so x = y = a, and then ﬁnally,
z = 3a2 −a2
2a

Since (a, a) is the only stationary point, the maximum must be attained here. We ﬁnd as
expected that the maximum is

in the closed quarter disc
A = {(x, y) | x ≥0, y ≥0, x2 + y2 ≤a2}.
Clearly, f(x, y) = 0 on the boundary ∂A of A. We have f(x, y) > 0 in the interior of A. Since
f is of class C∞in the interior of A, and is continuous on A, it follows from the second main
theorem that the maximum (which exists) must be attained at a stationary point in A◦.

a2 −x2 −y2 {a2 −x2 −2y2} = 0,
where the latter equation follows by the symmetry.
We then derive the equations
y = 0
or
2x2 + y2 = a2,
and
x = 0
or
x2 + 2y2 = a2.
Clearly, one of the coordinates must be 0, so
(0, 0),
(a, 0),
(−a, 0),
(0, a),
(0, −a),
are all the possible stationary points. Unfortunately they all lie outside the interior of the
domain, so none of the counts in the following. (Three of them lie on the boundary, because
f(x, y) = 0, and the remaining two points do not lie at all in the closure of A).
Our only possibility is obtained when
2x2 + y2 = a2
and
x2 + 2y2 = a2.
We get by a subtraction, y2 = x2, so x2 = y2 = a2

Alternatively it is also possible only to use rectangular coordinates, and this is actually not

∂x = 2x exp(x2 + y2) −4y = 0,

∂y = 2y exp(x2 + y2) −4x = 0,
i.e.
x exp(x2 + y2) = 2y,
y exp(x2 + y2) = 2x,
so
2y2 = xy exp(x2 + y2) = 2x2,
and hence y = x, because we only consider the open ﬁrst quadrant. Then
x exp(2x2) = 2x,

exp(2x2) = 2,

On the boundary either f(x, 0) = exp(x2), or f(0, y) = exp(y2), with the minimum value f(0, 0) =

D The existence follows from the second main theorem. Then either argue geometrically, or use the

I The function f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2 is continuous on the given closed and bounded domain. It
follows from the second main theorem that f has both a maximum and a minimum.
1) The elegant geometrical solution. The value
f(x, y, z) = x2 + y2 + z2
can be interpreted as the square of the distance from (0, 0, 0) to (x, y, z). This distance is
smallest (= 0) for (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0), and largest (= 1) at the other corners (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0)
and (0, 0, 1) of the tetrahedron which describes A.

2) The standard procedure. It follows immediately that (0, 0, 0) is the only possible stationary
point, but since it lies on the boundary it is a matter of deﬁnition if it should be counted as a
stationary point or not. It will always be treated as a boundary point, when we examine the
boundary.
Examination of the boundary.
a) If z = 0, then f(x, y, 0) = x2 + y2, which on the triangle in the XY plane is smallest at
(0, 0) and largest at (1, 0) and (0, 1).
This is immediately seen, and it can also be obtained by another examination of the bound-
ary in the XY plane on the triangle shown on the ﬁgure.
b) Due to the symmetry the same is true for the surfaces x = 0 and y = 0.
c) If z = 1−x−y, then we get the same parametric domain as the domain above on the ﬁgure
in the XY plane, and the restriction is given by
g(x, y) = f(x, y, 1 −x −y) = x2 + y2 + (1 −x −y)2.

ii) We also get the restriction
ϕ(x) = x2 + (1 −x)2,
x ∈[0, 1],
on the boundary y = 0, and on the boundary x = 0 we get
ψ(y) = y2 + (1 −y)2,
y ∈[0, 1].
Anyone of these will lead to precisely the same investigation as above.
By comparison of these values we conclude that the minimum is
M = f(0, 0, 0) = 0,
and the maximum is
S = f(1, 0, 0) = f(0, 1, 0) = f(0, 0, 1) = 1.
The latter method is rather troublesome compared to the geometric interpretation.
Example 17.22 Prove that the function
f(x, y) = x2 + 2y2 −2x,
(x, y) ∈R2,
has both a maximum and a minimum on the point set
A = {(x, y) | x ≥0, x2 + y2 ≤2},
and ﬁnd these values.
A The second main theorem. Maximum and minimum.
D Apply the second main theorem for continuous functions. Then ﬁnd the maximum and minimum.
I Since f(x, y) is real and continuous on the closed and bounded domain A, it follows from the second
main theorem for continuous functions that f has a maximum and a minimum on A. This proves
the existence. We shall in the following give two methods for the explicit determination of these
expressions.
1) Geometrical consideration. First rewrite f in the following way,

It follows immediately from the ﬁrst rearrangement that the minimum is attained at the point
(1, 0) ∈A of the value of the function
M = f(1, 0) = −1.
From the latter rearrangement follows that
f(x, y) = 2α2 −1

Therefore, the maximum must be attained on the largest of these ellipses (characterized by
α > 0 being largest), which has points in common with A. It follows immediately from the
ﬁgure that these maximum points must be (x, y) = (0, ±
√
2) on the Y axis. Hence the maximum
value is attained at these points,
S = f(0, ±
√
2) = 4.
2) The standard procedure. The function is of class C∞. Therefore we shall only ﬁnd the
stationary points in A◦followed by an examination of the boundary and numerical comparisons.
a) Stationary points. The possible stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = 2(x −1) = 0,
∂f
∂y = 4y = 0.
It follows that (1, 0) is the only stationary point in A◦. The value of the function is here
f(1, 0) = −1.
b) Examination of the boundary.
i) The restriction on the boundary x = 0, y ∈[−

f(0, y) = 2y2,

Examples of global and local extrema
Example 17.23 Given the function
f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + exy,
(x, y) ∈R2.
First show that f does not have a maximum in R2. Then prove the following:
1) The function f has a minimum M on the disc A = K((0, 0); 10).
2) M is smaller than 100.
3) We have the estimate f(x, y) ≥100 in the point set R2 \ A.
Finally, check if f has a minimum in R2.
A Extrema.
D Prove that f(x, y) →+∞for x2 + y2 →+∞. Then prove 1) – 3). Finally, argue for a minimum.
I Clearly,
(17.17) f(x, y) = x2 + y2 + exy > x2 + y2,
thus f(x, y) →+∞for x2 + y2 →+∞. It follows that f(x, y) has no maximum in R2.
1) Since f(x, y) is continuous and A = K((0, 0); 10) is a closed and bounded set, f(x, y) has
according to the second main theorem for continuous functions a minimum value M on A.
2) Clearly, M ≤f(0, 0) = 1 < 100.
3) If (x, y) ∈R2 \ A, then it follows directly from (17.17) that
f(x, y) > 102 = 100.
Now R2 = A ∪(R2 \ A), and f(x, y) > 100 on the entire R2 \ A, while there are points in A, for
which f(x, y) < 100. Therefore, a possible minimum must lie in A, and since it exists according
to 1) and is equal to M, we conclude that f has the minimum M in all of R2.
Additional remark. Since f(x, y) is of class C∞, the minimum M is attained at a stationary
point. The equations of the stationary points are
(17.18)

∂f
∂x = 2x + yexy = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y + xexy = 0,
which has only (0, 0) as a stationary point, so
M = f(0, 0) = 1.
That (0, 0) is the only stationary point follows from the following: Clearly, xy ≤0. We have
according to (17.18),
2x2 = −xyexy = 2y2,
so y = −x. By insertion into the former equation of (17.18) we get
0 = 2x −x exp(−x2) = x(2 −exp(−x2)).
From exp(−x2) < 2 follows that x = 0, and thus y = 0, so (0, 0) is the only stationary point. ♦

Example 17.24 It is well-known that if a C1-function g : R →R has precisely one stationary point
x0, which is a local minimum point x0, then g has a global minimum at x0.

f(x, y) = x2 + y2(1 + x)3,
(x, y) ∈R2,
that no such result exists in general for functions f : R2 →R.
A Another illustration of the diﬀerence between one and several variables.

and that this minimum is not a global minimum.

Figure 17.24: How the surface of the graph might look like for a counterexample.
I When
f(x, y) = x2 + y2(1 + x)3,
we get the following equations of the stationary points,
∂f
∂x = 2x + 3y2(1 + x)2 = 0,
∂f
∂y = 2y(1 + x3) = 0.
The latter equation shows that either y = 0 or x = −1.
If we put y = 0 into the former equation, we get x = 0, so (0, 0) is a stationary point.
If x = −1, we conclude from the former equation that ∂f
∂x = −2 = 0.
This shows that (0, 0) is the only stationary point. The value of the function is here f(0, 0) = 0.
Clearly, the approximating polynomial of at most second degree from (0, 0) is
P2(x, y) = x2 + y2.
This structure shows that (0, 0) is a (local) minimum point.
We then get along the restriction y = 1 that
f(x, 1) = x2 + (x + 1)3 →−∞
for x →−∞,
so f(x, y) does not have a global minimum.

A Ranges.
D Find the possible stationary points; examine the boundary. Apply the main theorems for continu-
ous functions.
I The function is of class C∞in R2. Restricted to the closed disc K((0, 0); 1) we have according to
the second main theorem both a maximum and a minimum, and these are either attained at a
stationary point or on the boundary.
Since the domain is connected, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous functions that
the range is an interval.

Examples of global and local extrema
Example 17.26 When we approximate a function by an approximating polynomial based on Taylor’s
formula, the error is zero at the point of expansion, and it will usually increase with the distance form
the point of expansion. We may get diﬀerent results by using other polynomials for our approximation.
One of the possibilities is to level out the error by demanding that the integral of the square of the
error should be as small as possible. As an illustration we consider the function
f(t) = cos t,
−π
2 ≤t ≤π
2 ,
and a polynomial
Q(t; x, y) = x −ty2,
−π
2 ≤t ≤π
2 .
Find x and y, such that the integral
I(x, y) =

π
2
−pi
2
{f(t) −Q(t; x, y)}2dt
becomes as small as possible. Then compute the error of t = ±π
2 , partly by approximation by the
found polynomial Q, and partly by using the Taylor polynomial of at most second degree P2.
A Minimizing in L2 norm.
D Compute I(x, y) and minimize. Alternatively, compute ∂I
∂x and ∂I
∂y directly. Compare with the
Taylor polynomial.
I Since f(t) = cos t is an even function, it is quite reasonable to approximate by a polynomial Q(t; x, y)
of even degree in t. Since f(t) −Q(t; x, y) is even in t, we get
I(x, y) =

π
2
−π
2
{f(t) −Q(t; x, y)}2dt = 2

π
2
0
{cos t −x + yt2}2dt.
Clearly, I(x, y) ≥0 is continuous, and I(x, y) →+∞for x2 +y2 →+∞, so I(x, y) has a minimum
in R2. Now I(x, y) is of class C∞, so this minimum must be attained at a stationary point.

corresponding to a minimum for I(x, y), given approximatively by
I(x0, y0) ≈0.000 936.
Remark. This approximation is also called the approximation in energy over the given interval.
It is seen that this is extremely good even for a polynomial of degree two (an error of less than
1 per thousand). This is the right concept of convergence in Communication Systems and other
applications in the technical sciences. Unfortunately, most students are at this level still most
familiar with the pointwise convergence, in spite of the fact that this concept in practice often
is very awkward. It will below be demonstrated that the inaccuracy by the various pointwise
approximations are bigger than the approximation in energy. ♦

It follows that the inequality describes a closed ellipsoidal disc of centrum

and of the half
axes a = 3

2.
The domain A is the intersection of the closed ellipsoidal disc and the closed half plane y ≥−1
2 x,
i.e. that part of the ellipsoidal disc which lies above the line.
It follows that A is closed and
bounded.
According to the second main theorem for continuous functions, f has a maximum and a minimum
in A. Since f is of class C∞, these are among the values of the function at either the stationary
points in the interior of A or at the points of the boundary.
First note that the line y = −1
2 x intersects the ellipse in two points given by
0 = x2 + 2y2 −3x = x2 + 2 · x2
4 −3x = 3
2 x2 −3x = 3
2 x(x −2),
hence x = 0 and x = 2, corresponding to the points (0, 0) and (2, −1).
1) Stationary points. The equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x
=
9x2 + 6y2 −18x = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
12xy + 12y2 = 12(x + y)y = 0.
The line x + y = 0 does not intersect the interior of A, so we only get the possibility y = 0. If
we put this into the former equation we get
0 = 9x2 + 0 −18x = 9x(x −2),
hence x = 0 or x = 2, corresponding to the stationary points (0, 0) and (2, 0). Only (2, 0) lies
in A. Then compute the value of the function at this point,
f(2, 0) = 3 · 23 + 0 + 0 −9 · 22 = 24 −36 = −12.
2) Examination of the boundary. The boundary is split into three obvious parts:
a) y = −1
2 x, for 0 ≤x ≤2 and y ≤0,
b) y = −

3x −x2

Examples of global and local extrema
Notice that if (x, y) lies on the (boundary of the) ellipse, then
f(x, y) = 3x3 + 6xy2 + 4y3 −9x2 = 3x{x2 + 2y2 −3x} + 4y3 = 4y3,
which is a trick that will help us a lot in the following.
a) The restriction of f(x, y) to y = −1
2 x, 0 ≤x ≤2, is

At the end points of the interval,
ϕ(0) = f(0, 0) = 0 and ϕ(2) = f(2, −1) = 4 · 8 −9 · 4 = −4.
b) On the ellipsoidal boundary of A we reduce f(x, y) to
f(x, y) = 4y3.
It follows geometrically (consider the ﬁgure) that the maximum on this part of the boundary
is

Figure 17.26: The graph of f(x, y) over K((0, 0); 1).
I Since f(x, y) is continuous (even of class C∞), and K(0; 1) is closed and bounded, it follows from
the second main theorem for continuous functions that f has both a maximum and a minimum in
K(0; 1). These are either attained at a stationary point or at a boundary point.
Since
∂f
∂x = y2
and
∂f
∂y = 2xy
are 0 for y = 0, i.e. on the X axis, the set of stationary points is [−1, 1] × {0}. The value of f(x, y)
is here trivially f(x, 0) = 0.
We use on the boundary the parametric description (x, y) = (cos t, sin t), t ∈[0, 2π], thus the
restriction to the boundary is given by
ϕ(t) = f(cos t, sin t) = cos t · sin2 t,
t ∈[0, 2π],
with the derivative
ϕ′(t) = −sin3 t + 2 sin t · cos3 t = sin t · (2 cos2 t −sin2 t) = sin t(3 cos2 t −1).
This expression is 0 for t = 0, π, or for cos t = ± 1
√
3, corresponding to sin2 t = 2
3. When we put
t = 0, π, we get the value 0 of the function.

Example 17.29 The function f : R2 →R is given by
f(x, y) = (x2 + y2 −1)(x2 + y2 −4).
1) Find the set of stationary points for f.
2) Show that f has a proper extremum at (0, 0), and indicate the type of this extremum.
3) Find the largest value which is attained by f in the disc

the values g(0) and g(4). We conclude from
f(4, 0) = g(4) = (16 −1)(16 −4) = 15 · 12 = 180 > 4 = f(0, 0),
that f(4, 0) = 180 is the maximum value in D.
Finally, the stationary points are necessarily (0, 0) and

Then return to the very beginning, and handle the example according to the original intention.
1) The stationary points are the solutions of the equations

We conclude that the stationary points are

∪{(0, 0)}.
2) It follows from f(x, y) = g(̺) = (1 −̺2)(4 −̺2) that g(̺) is increasing when ̺ →0, hence
(0, 0) is a maximum.

where

Figure 17.31: The domain B.
I 1) The set B is closed and bounded, and f is continuous. It follows from the second main theorem
for continuous functions that f has a maximum and a minimum on B.
2) Clearly, f(x, y) ≥0 on B, and the minimum value M = 0 must be attained on the axes.
Since f(x, y) = C on the hyperbola xy = C, we conclude from considering the set of curves
that the maximum value must be attained on the line y = 1−2x. Then consider the restriction
g(x) = f(x, 1 −2x) = x −2x2,

Remark.
An alternative way is of course to realize that (0, 0) is the only candidate of a
stationary point. Since f is 0 on the axes, only the examination of the boundary line y = 1−2x
remains, and this was done above.

Figure 17.32: Part of the graph of f.
I 1) The stationary points are the solutions of the equations
∂f
∂x = 64xy −60x2y −y3 = y(64x −60x2 −y2) = 0,
∂f
∂y = 32x2 −20x3 −3xy2 = x(32x −20x2 −3y2) = 0.
a) If x = 0, then the latter equation is fulﬁlled, and we obtain y = 0 from the ﬁrst, so (0, 0) is
a stationary point.
b) If y = 0, then the former equation is fulﬁlled, and the latter equation gives either x = 0 or
x = 8

c) If both x = 0 and y = 0, the equations are reduced to
y2 = 64x −60x2
and
3y2 = 32x −20x2.
By elimination of y,
32x −20x2 = 3y2 = 192x −180x2,
from which we get the necessary condition
0 = 160x2 −160x = 160x(x −1).

Figure 17.33: The function f(x, y) changes its sign, whenever one crosses either one of the axes or the

we see that f is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of (0, 0), and we have
no extremum.
Second variant. If we take the restriction of f(x, y) to the line y = x, it follows, that
ϕ(x) = f(x, x) = 32x3 −21x4 = x3 (32 −21x)
is both positive and negative in any neighbourhood of (0, 0), and we cannot have an
extremum.
c) When we check (1, 2), we have many methods at hand. We shall here restrict ourselves to
two. First note that (1, 2) is in fact a stationary point, so it is possible that we have an
extremum at the point.
First variant. Approximating polynomial of at most degree two from (1, 2).

x = x1 + 1

proving that we have a local maximum for (x1, y1) = (0, 0), i.e. for (x, y) = (1, 2).
Second variant. The (r, s, t)-method.
First compute
∂2f
∂x2 = 64y−120xy,
∂2f
∂x∂y = 64x−60x2−3y2,
∂2f
∂y2 = −6xy.
At the point (1, 2),
r = 128 −240 = −112,
s = −8,
t = 12,
hence
r < 0,
t < 0
and
rt > s2.
It follows by the (r, s, t)-method that there is a proper maximum at the point (1, 2).
3) The range is R.
We have e.g.
f(x, x) = 32x3 −21x4 →−∞
for x →+∞,
and
f(x, −x) = −32x3 + 21x4 →+∞
for x →+∞,
and the rest follows from that f(x, y) is continuous.

∂f
∂y = 2(x + y) −2 sin(2x + y) = 0.

Accordingly, x = pπ, p ∈Z, and y = −x. Thus the stationary points are

2) It follows from the ﬁgure that (0, 0) and (π, −π) are the only stationary points in A, and they
both lie on the boundary of A.
Since f(x, y) is continuous on the closed and bounded set A, it follows from the second main
theorem for continuous functions that f(x, y) has both a maximum and a minimum in A.
As proved above, the interior A◦does not contain any stationary point, so the maximum and
the minimum must be attained on the boundary of A.
Examination of the boundary.
a) If y = −x, 0 ≤x ≤π, then the restriction is
f(x, −x) = 2 cosx.
This has its maximum f(0, 0) = 2 and its minimum f(π, −π) = −2.
b) If y = −2x, 0 ≤x ≤π, then the restriction is
f(x, −2x) = x2 + 2 cos0 = x2 + 2.
This has its maximum value f(π, −2π) = π2 + 2 and its minimum value f(0, 0) = 2.

c) If x = π, −2π ≤y ≤−π, then the restriction is
f(π, y) = (π + y)2 + 2 cos(2π + y) = (π + y)2 + 2 cosy
with
f ′
y(π, y) = 2(π + y) −2 sin y = 2{π + y −sin y},
f ′′
yy(π, y) = 2{1 −cos y} ≥0,
so f ′
y(π, y) is increasing in y. From f ′
y(π, −π) = 0 follows that f ′
y(π, y) < 0 for y ∈[−2π, −π[.
Since f(π, −π) = 0+2 cosπ = −2 and f(π, −2π) = π2 +2, these two values are respectively
the minimum and the maximum.
Summarizing,
S = f(π, −2π) = π2 + 2,
M = f(π, −π) = −2.
d) Clearly, f(x, 0) →+∞for x →+∞, and f(x, y) ≥−2, so the range is contained in[−2, +∞[.
Since
f((2n + 1)π, −(2n + 1)π) = −2,
n ∈Z,
and f is continuous on the connected set R2, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem of
continuous functions that the range is connected, so
f(R2) = [−2, +∞[.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

I Since f(x, y) is continuous and A is closed and bounded, it follows from the second main theorem
for continuous functions that f has both a maximum and a minimum in A. Since f is of class
C∞in the interior of the domain, these values are either obtained at a stationary point or at a

It was mentioned above that in particular 0 < x < 1 and 0 < y < 1 for (x, y) ∈D◦, so ∂f
∂x > 0
and ∂f
∂y < 0 everywhere in D◦. The equations of the stationary points are not fulﬁlled in D◦, so
there does not exist any of them.
Clearly, f(x, y) →+∞, when (x, y) tends to any point on that arc of ∂D, which does not belong
to D. The set D is connected and f is continuous, so it follows from the ﬁrst and the second main
theorem for continuous functions that f(D) = [a, +∞[, where the value a is attained at a point of
the boundary which also lies in D, i.e. in ∂D ∩D. Clearly, a is a minimum value.
The restriction of the function to ∂D ∩D is
f(x, y) = 0 +

1 −x2 −(y −1)2 ,
(x −1)2 + y2 = 1, x > 0, y > 0.
This value of the function is smallest, when 1−x2−(y−1)2 is largest. This means that x2+(y−1)2,
which can be interpreted as the square of the distance from (0, 1) to (x, y) on the circular arc must
be as small as possible. A geometric consideration shows that this point lies on both the line

Examples of global and local extrema
Example 17.40 Let
f(x, y) = −2xy2 + 4x2 + y2 −2x,
(x, y) ∈A.
Find the range of the function in the following cases:
1) The domain A is the closed half ellipsoidal disc given by
4x2 + y2 ≤1
and
x ≥0.
2) The domain A is the open half ellipsoidal disc given by
4x2 + y2 < 1
and
x > 0.
3) The domain A is the whole plane.
A Maximum and minimum; range.
D From f ∈C∞follows that there are no exception point. The set A is connected in all three cases
and the function is continuous, so the range is again connected, according to the ﬁrst main theorem
for continuous functions, hence an interval. We can in the three cases apply the following methods:
1) Since A is closed and bounded, we can apply the second main theorem, hence the maximum
and minimum exist and they are attained at either a stationary point or at a boundary point.
2) Here A is bounded and open. The closure was treated in 1), so we can derive the range from
1).
3) In this case A is unbounded. We argue on the term of highest degree.
I The equations of the possible stationary points in the plane are
∂f
∂x
=
−2y2 + 8x −2 = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
−4xy + 2y = 2y(1 −2x) = 0.
From the latter equation we get the possibilities
a) y = 0
and
b) x = 1
2.
Thus:
a) If y = 0, then ∂f
∂x = 0 for x = 1
4, so
1
4, 0

is a stationary point for f.
b) If x = 1
2, then ∂f
∂x = −2y2 + 4 −2 = 0 for y = ±1, so
1
2, 1

and
1

are stationary
points for f.

Examples of global and local extrema
For large x the expression is dominated by −2x3, and as −2x3 →−∞for x →+∞, and
−2x3 →+∞for x →−∞, and as the range is an interval (the ﬁrst main theorem again), we
conclude that
f(A) = R.
Example 17.41 Let
f(x, y) = 3x3 + 4y3 + 6xy2 −9x2,
(x, y) ∈A.
Find the range of the function in the following cases.
1) The domain A is the closed triangle of the vertices (0, 0), (3, 3) and

A is the interior of the point set of 1).
2) The domain A is the whole plane.

D From f ∈C∞
R2
follows that there are no exception points. First ﬁnd the stationary points in
the plane. Since A is connected in all three cases, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem that all
the ranges are intervals.
1) Since A is closed and bounded, and f is continuous, it follows from the second main theorem
that f has both a maximum and a minimum in A. These can only be attained at a stationary
point or at a boundary point.
2) Because A is the interior of the set of 1), we can apply the results from 1).
3) Consider e.g. the restriction of f to the line y = x.
The possible stationary points in the whole plane must satisfy the equations
∂f
∂x
=
9x2 + 6y2 −18x = 0,
∂f
∂y
=
12y2 + 12xy = 12y(y + x) = 0.
It follows from the latter equation that either y = 0 or y = −x. We therefore get the following
possibilities:
1) If y = 0, then either x = 0 or x = 2, and the stationary points in this case are
(0, 0)
and
(2, 0).
2) If y = −x, then

By a numerical comparison we ﬁnd the minimum value at a stationary point

2) When we remove the boundary of 1), we also remove the maximum value from the range.
However, due to the continuity we can in A obtain values as close to 270 as we wish, so the
range becomes
f(A) = [−12, 270[.
3) The restriction to the line y = x is
g(x) = 13x3 −9x2 = x2(13x −9),
x ∈R.

that the domain of f is the union of two closed discs,

This set is closed and bounded, but not connected, so we can only apply the second main theo-
rem. We conclude that f has a maximum and a minimum of both of its connected components.

Example 17.43 Find the range of the function
f(x, y, z) = xy + z2,
x2 + y2 + z2 ≤a2.
A the range of a polynomial in three variables over a closed ball, i.e. a closed and bounded and
connected set.
D According to the second main theorem, f has a maximum value S and a minimum value M on
this set.
Then the ﬁrst main theorem implies that the range is connected, hence the interval
[M, S].
The maximum and the minimum values are either attained at a stationary point or
at a boundary point, because a polynomial does not have exceptional points. Therefore, ﬁnd the
possible stationary points, and the examine the behaviour of the function on the boundary. Finally,
make a numerical comparison.
I The equations of the possible stationary points are
∂f
∂x = y = 0,
∂f
∂y = x = 0,
∂f
∂z = 2z = 0.
Clearly, (0, 0, 0) is the only stationary point, and the value is here f(0, 0, 0) = 0.
We shall use spherical coordinates by the examination of the boundary,



x = a sin θ cos ϕ,
y = a sin θ sin ϕ,
z = a cos θ,
where θ ∈[0, π] and ϕ ∈[0, 2π].

These rearrangements show that f(x, y, z) is largest on the boundary (the sphere), when sin2 θ = 0,
and the corresponding maximum value is
S = a2

Furthermore, f(x, y, z) is smallest on the boundary (the sphere), when sin2 θ = 1 and sin 2ϕ = −1,
which corresponds to the minimum value
M = a2

2) Since A is closed and bounded, and f is continuous on A, it follows from the second main
theorem for continuous functions that f has both a maximum and a minimum on A.
Since f is of class C∞in the interior of A, there are no exception points, so the maximum and
the minimum lie either in the interior stationary points or on the boundary.
Since A is connected, also f(A) is connected, due to the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous
functions, and the range is the interval
f(A) = [M, S],

This is the “stationary point” on the part of the boundary in the (X, Y )-plane.
There is a similar “examination of the boundary” connected with this part of the boundary.

Using the symmetry we get ψ′(x) = 0 for x = 1, which corresponds to the candidate
ψ(1) = ϕ(1, 0) = f(1, 0, 0) = 2.
If instead x = 0, then similarly,
f(0, 1, 0) = 2.
The remaining boundary curve of the surface in the (X, Y )-plane lies on the line x + y = 2,
so the restriction becomes
η(x) = ϕ(x, 2 −x) = √x +
√
2 −x,
x ∈[0, 2],
which is identical with ψ(x) from above. Therefore we get the candidate
η(1) = ϕ(1, 1) = f(1, 1, 0) = 2.
b) It follows by the symmetry that we have analogous results in those parts of the boundary
surface which lie in the planes y = 0 and x = 0, respectively. We see that we have at the
same time examined the boundary curves of the remaining oblique part of the boundary
surface, so we are only missing the investigation of the “interior” of this remaining part of
the boundary surface.
c) The restriction to the “interior” of the oblique boundary surface lying in the plane z =
2 −x −y is given by
Θ(x, y) = f(x, y, 2 −x −y) = √x + √y +

b) By interchanging the letters (x, y) →(y, x) we get on the boundary curve x = 0, y ∈[0, 2]
the same function as above. Hence the candidates are
f(0, 0) = f(0, 2) =

and
f(0, 1) = 2.
c) We get on the boundary curve y = 2 −x, x ∈[0, 2] the restriction
ψ(x) = f(x, 2 −x) = √x +

2 −x = ϕ(x),
cf. above, so the candidates are
f(0, 2) = f(2, 0) =

and

It follows that f is deﬁned and continuous for y ≤2 −x, thus in particular in A. It follows
from the second main theorem for continuous functions that f has both a maximum value S
and a minimum value M on A. Since f is of class C∞in the interior of A, these values are
either attained at an inner stationary point or on the boundary.

I 1) The point set A is the intersection of the closed disc of centrum (0, 0) and radius

closed lower half plain. An intersection of two closed sets is also closed, so A is closed. Since
A is contained in a disc of ﬁnite radius, A is bounded.

Since A is closed and bounded and f is continuous, it follows from the second main theorem
for continuous functions that f has a minimum value M and a maximum value S on A.
Since f is of class C∞in the interior of A, the values S and M can only be attained at an
interior stationary point in A◦or on the boundary ∂A.

Figure 17.53: The zero lines of the function f(x, y) in A. There are the union of the half circle and
the oblique line y = −x. The function is negative to the left of this oblique line, and positive to the
right of it.
When we examine the sign of f we see that f can be both positive and negative. When we
specify S and M, we can exclude the zero curves, i.e. that part of the boundary which lies on
the circular arc, as well as the points of A, which lie on the line y = −x.
In particular, the examination of the boundary is reduced to the segment y = 0, x ∈[−
√
2,
√

on the X-axis, where we also can exclude the end points because the value is here 0. The
restriction of f to this part of the boundary is

of S and M (because we have already excluded the end points and the circular arc),
f(1, 0) = 1
og
f(−1, 0) = −1.

Thus y2 = x2, i.e. either y = x or y = −x. By the analysis of the sign of f, neither of the
stationary points on y = −x can be a maximum or a minimum (the value of the function is
here zero). In the chase of the candidates the investigation is now reduced to the line segment
y = x, x ∈] −1, 0[, (because y ≤0). Then we get by insertion into either of the equations of
(17.19) that
2 = 2x2 + xy + y2 = 4x2,

3) Since A is convex, A is in particular connected. Since f is continuous in A, it follows from the

hence an interval. Now f has according to 2) a minimum and a maximum, so we ﬁnally get

a) By restriction to the line segment y = 3, x ∈[−2, 2],
ϕ(x) = f(x, 3) = 1 −x2 −3 + 6x2 = 5x2 −2,
which clearly is smallest when x = 0, and largest when x = ±2. We get the candidates
f(0, 3) = −2
and
f(±2, 3) = 18.
b) Considering the restriction to the parabolic arc we have two alternatives:
i) By the restriction to y = x2 −1, x ∈[−2, 2], we get
ψ(x) = f(x, x2−1) = 2(1−x2) + 2x2(x2−1) = 2(x2 −1)2,
which is smallest when x2 = 1, and largest when x2 = (±2)2.The candidates are
f(±1, 0) = 1 −1 = 0
and
f(±2, 3) = 18.
ii) Alternatively, x2 = y + 1, y ∈[−1, 3], so
η(y) = −2y + 2(y + 1)y = 2y2,
y ∈[−1, 3],
which is smallest for y = 0, and largest for y = 3, corresponding to
f(±1, 0) = 0
and
f(±2, 3) = 18.
Then by a numerical comparison of the candidates,

we ﬁnally get
S = f(±2, 3) = 18
and
M = f(0, 3) = −2.
c) Since A is connected, and f is continuous, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for con-
tinuous functions, that f(A) ⫅R is connected, hence an interval.
We have shown in 3) that M = −2 and S = 18, so the range is
f(A) = [−2, 18].

Figure 17.56: The closed and bounded domain A.
I It follows from the ﬁgure and the deﬁnition of A that A is connected and closed and bounded. Since
f(x, y) is continuous on the closed and bounded set A, it follows from the second main theorem
for continuous functions that f(x, y) has a maximum and a minimum on A. Since f is of class
C∞, the maximum and minimum values are to be found among the values at the possible inner
stationary points and at the boundary points.
Since A is also connected, and f is continuous, it follows from the ﬁrst main theorem for continuous
functions that the range is connected, hence a closed interval, which must necessarily be
f(A) = [fmin, fmax] .
The equations of the possible stationary points are
∂f
∂x = y −64

∂f
∂y = x −64

thus

Now x, y > 0 in A, so it follows by a division that x
y = 1, i.e. y = x. Then by insertion x3 = 64, so
x = y = 4. Since xy = 16 < 32 and 4 > 1 we conclude that (4, 4) lies in the interior of A. Hence
(4, 4) is a stationary point, and the value of the function is here

The boundary.
1) For y = 1, 1 ≤x ≤32, we get the restriction
ϕ(x) = f(x, 1) = x + 64
x + 64
where
ϕ′(x) = 1 −64
x2 = 0
for x = 8.
We notice the values
f(1, 1) = ϕ(1) = 1 + 64 + 64 = 129,
f(32, 1) = ϕ(32) = 32 + 2 + 64 = 98,
f(8, 1) = ϕ(8) = 8 + 8 + 64 = 80.
2) For x = 1, 1 ≤y ≤32, it follows from the symmetry,
f(1, 1) = 129,
f(1, 32) = 98,
f(1, 8) = 80.
3) If xy = 32, i.e. y = 32

where

Then compare the values of the candidates,

f(1, 1) = 129,
f(8, 1) = f(1, 8) = 80,
f(32, 1) = f(1, 32) = 98,
f(

I 1) The domain A is a closed disc of centrum(0, 0) and radius 2, thus A is closed and bounded and
connected.
Clearly, f is continuous on A and of class C∞in the interior of A. According to the second
main theorem for continuous functions, f has a maximum value S and a minimum value M on
A. These values are either attained at a stationary point or on the boundary, because there
are no exceptional points.
Note also that A is connected, so the range f(A) = [M, S] is connected according to the the
ﬁrst main theorem for continuous functions. This will be used in 4).

Figure 17.59: The set A.
I 1) The set A is closed and bounded, and f is continuous. According to the second main theorem
for continuous functions, f has both a maximum value S and a minimum value M on A.
2) Since f is of class C∞, the values S and M are either attained at an inner stationary point or
at a boundary point.
Stationary points.
The equations of the stationary points are
∂f
∂x = 2y cos x −1 = 0
and
∂f
∂y = 2 sin x = 0.
It follows from the latter equation that x = pπ, p ∈Z, i.e. x = 0, if the point shall also lie in
A. When this is put into the former equation we get 2y −1 = 0, so y = 1

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
18.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
18.2
Powers etc.

Exponential, ﬁxed base:

(extensions for some x, y),

ax , a > 0,
(extensions for some x),
n√a = a1/n, a ≥0,
n ∈N.
Square root:

Remark 18.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 18.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 18.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 18.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 18.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Formulæ
Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 18.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,
sin(u −v) = sin u cos v −cos u sin v,
cos(u + v) = cos u cos v −sin u sin v,
cos(u −v) = cos u cos v + sin u sin v.

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).
Formulæ of halving and doubling the argument:
sinh(2x) = 2 sinh(x) cosh(x),
cosh(2x) = cosh2(x) + sinh2(x) = 2 cosh2(x) −1 = 2 sinh2(x) + 1,

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
