About the Technical 
Reviewer
Göran Lundqvist is a technical consul-
tant working for Symfoni ESM with a focus on 
ServiceNow.
He has a broad ITSM experience within both 
processes and technical areas, and brings over 15 
years of knowledge in these areas. During these 
years he has worked as everything from first 
line support to third line support, team manager, 
process owner, and system administrator.
The last few years he has been in the ServiceNow 
field and is constantly looking for new things to learn about ServiceNow. He 
believes that sharing is the key to the future, which took him down the road to 
becoming a ServiceNow advocate, where he is an active community member 
and blog writer for ServiceNow.

Acknowledgments
First and foremost, thanks are due to Al Jazeera for giving me the opportunity 
to ride the ServiceNow wave in a corporate environment and for allowing me 
to share the insights acquired on the job with you. I had my first interview at 
Al Jazeera with Grant Franklin Totten, with whom I flew to New York a year 
later to launch ServiceNow at Al Jazeera America. Thank you for the trust 
that you have put in me.
Al Jazeera generally adopts a permissive knowledge-sharing policy, but our 
chief information officer Mohamed Abuagla has particularly encouraged us to 
be world-class in what we do and show it.
I could go on acknowledging many more colleagues at Al Jazeera, with Aamer 
Maqsood, Faisal Iqbal, and Imad Musa at the top of the list for facilitating the 
publication of this work.
Outside Al Jazeera, I thank peers in the ServiceNow community, some of 
who are quoted in this book, for openly and generously sharing with me their 
own examples and insights. Of all people, I single out Göran Lundqvist for 
technically reviewing this work.
My family and friends, thank you for enduring my seclusion as I worked on 
this book.
Finally, I thank the editing team at Apress for coming together to make this 
work the polished outcome that you now get, and for bearing with me through 
the creative process of writing. I kept on changing the table of contents, 
merging chapters and creating new ones. Thank you Robert Hutchinson for 
believing in the importance of this book from day one, Rita Fernando, and 
Laura Berendson.
Thank you all.

Introduction
When I joined Al Jazeera in 2012, the IT department was looking to improve 
the way it organized itself internally, and how it was perceived in the eyes of 
colleagues in this international media organization.
Al Jazeera has been at the center of the Arab Spring revolutions and its 
influence was being felt beyond the Middle East. Hillary Clinton called it a 
leader providing more “real news” than its American counterparts who she 
said were losing the “information war.”
Inside Al Jazeera, it was easy to perceive the aura of pride felt in how Al 
Jazeera was challenging local and Western media establishments, and for IT 
this meant that internal stakeholders expected nothing less than world-class 
support and operations.
Analag satellite broadcast technology was extremely sharp and resilient, and as 
the WikiLeaks tweet below suggests, it was perceived as a core element of Al 
Jazeera’s success. But with users’ attention shifting to digital and the advent of 
Broadcast IT, expectations and dependence on IT were chaotically on the rise.
In this context, the IT department embarked on several transformational 
initiatives, one of which was the establishment of a Service Management function 
tasked to improve the processes through which the department handled its 
work, and the introduction of ServiceNow to aid in the transformation. So I 
was hired.
Figure 1.  It’s widely believed that Al Jazeera and its broadcast technology played a central 
role in the diffusion of revolutionary sentiment across the Arab world between 2008 and 2011

Introduction
xvi
What occurred since 2012 and the writing of this book was not only special 
for me and Al Jazeera’s digital transformation. The role that IT systems have 
been playing in our daily lives and in the corporate world has surged and, not 
coincidentally, so has ServiceNow’s share price.
Figure 2.  Share price of ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW) has been steadily increasing since its 
IPO in 2012
This is not to say that all investments in ITSM are rosy; you probably know 
from personal experience that it is not the case. In fact, numerous studies 
report on how commonly ITSM implementation projects fail to deliver on 
expectations, with failure rate estimates as high as 80%.
Despite false starts, ServiceNow achieved very wide adoption at Al Jazeera, 
and has contributed to a noticeable transformation in the way things get 
done here and in the relationship between IT and the wider organization. As 
testimony of this success, management was invited by ServiceNow to tell its 
story at the Knowledge14 ServiceNow conference, and I was named a Star of 
Al Jazeera Media Network in 2014.

Introduction
xvii
In reality, credit for the transformation can only be partially attributed to the 
tool, best practice theories, or policy documents; the real transformation was 
actually in people.
As so many Service Management experts confirm: “To successfully implement 
ITIL is to confront human nature and succeed.” (Denis Matte) This is what 
I want to share with you in this book: How to facilitate change in people’s 
daily routines in an enterprise organization by focusing on visible returns 
on investment first, and staging drastic changes that typically sabotage users’ 
adoption.
Who this book is for
Auspicious of great success for your ServiceNow implementation, this book is 
written for the benefit of application managers, Service Management program 
directors and fellow solution architects responsible for ServiceNow in their 
organization.
If you have already introduced ServiceNow at your organization or for a client 
but you are facing user resistance and not seeing the widespread adoption that 
was expected, you will particularly appreciate the pragmatic advice offered in 
this book.
This book is different from the typical pleas that justify a lack of progress 
with the need for heavy-handed executive support, massive ITIL brainwashing 
schemes, or hiring someone to consult for you.
In this book we acknowledge the people behavior challenge, but draw on 
insights from research in consumer behavior, web usability, and software 
engineering that worked at Al Jazeera. Examples will also be provided from 
other world-class organizations, such as Volkswagen, Berkeley and Harvard 
Universities, and CERN.

Introduction
xviii
Three reasons to read this book
	1.	 Your organization has invested (or is planning to) in 
ServiceNow licenses and implementation expenses. 
With a few bucks more, this book will help you get a 
better return on the investment and avoid falling prey to 
vendors.
	2.	 You believe that the comprehensiveness of requirements, 
management buy-in, or ServiceNow’s Out-Of-Box 
functionality will cause people to abandon their daily 
routines and jump on board en masse. This book may 
spare you disappointment!
	3.	 You espouse the Agile methodology but seem to be 
at odds with the Waterfall arrogance of IT Service 
Management bureaucrats around you. You are not insane! 
This book will equip you with anecdotes to convince 
them or intervene in case they fail.
How this book is structured
The book is divided into three parts:
Part 1. ITSM in the Real World: Guiding principles and implementation strategy
Part 2. Essentials: Specific advice for the implementation phase of your project, 
with emphasis on email processing, on-boarding, and a front-end service portal
Part 3. After Go-live: Advice on managing development after Go-live, and 
dealing with scaling issues.
There are 12 chapters in this book, and at the end of each chapter is a list of 
concise and tweet-ready takeaways.
There also two appendices:
Appendix A: Provides checklists for assessing and monitoring customizations 
Appendix B: Binds together bullet-point requirements from all chapters, for 
ease of reference

ITSM in the real 
world
Start by doing what’s necessary; then do what’s possible; and suddenly you 
are doing the impossible.
—Francis of Assisi
Despite all the hype, many IT service management initiatives are doomed. In 
Part I we look at what lessons can be learned, observe patterns in the success 
stories, and propose a strategy to maximize your chances of success.

Pragmatic or 
Tragic ITSM
Why ITSM initiatives fail and how to succeed
Decades of experience teach us that IT service management programs 
are really people-change initiatives, but that they are frequently mistaken 
for ITSM tool implementations or process documentation projects.
—Troy DuMoulin, Vice President of Research at Pink Elephant1
IT help desk teams have long been mesmerized by the advertised benefits of 
the latest ticketing system, showcased to bring order to the chaotic mess in 
IT departments and to vex relationships with colleagues calling for assistance.
This chapter describes the context in which many IT managers begin their IT 
service management (ITSM) and ServiceNow implementation projects, and 
the by now researched and documented critical mistakes many make in the 
process. Knowing how the problems manifests themselves, we then identify 
guiding principles to avoid those traps as you approach your ITSM initiatives. 
The entire book thereafter illustrates with real examples how those prin-
ciples were applied at different stages of an IT transformation journey.

Even though the traps are common enough to ITSM and Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) projects in general, this book is not about general theories; it 
instead will show how Agile and Lean development methodologies have been 
applied in ServiceNow by real companies in the real world.
In this chapter:
• 
Common traps: How a tools mindset and up-front 
requirements can derail your improvement initiative
• 
Guiding principles: How humble beginnings and real usage 
can turn odds in favor of your long-term improvement 
goals
• 
Secret weapon: How email can affect successful 
ServiceNow penetration in the everyday life of your 
organization
The typical failure story
While it is understandably difficult for management professionals to admit fail-
ure and spread the news, numerous studies report a low success rate in ITSM 
programs in particular, and in enterprise IT programs in general. A report 
by Service Management consultancy Pink Elephant in 2015 suggested that, in 
their experience, more than half of ITSM projects failed. Similar remarks have 
been made by KPMG on ERP projects, where “successful implementation has 
been notoriously low”2.
You have probably witnessed this pattern already, where the department 
ends up abandoning the ITSM tool they invested in, either in favor of another 
supposedly better tool, or just back to the old way of doing things (usually 
email). But it's seldom the tool that was the problem, as competing vendors 
will want you to believe. The true problem of ambitious IT projects is in 
underestimating the challenge of behavioral change management in achieving 
sticky users adoption.
ITSM implementors naively expect users’ adoption to be a by-product of the 
tool implementation, a users’ manual or initial training plans. They assume that 
they can force people to abandon email and do it all in the tool.
This may hold true initially, but all too often the initial excitement for the new 
tool and consultant-drawn ITIL diagrams eventually dies out, usually hand in 
hand with changes in the management office or in “strategic objectives.”

Before we dive into the problem, service management consultant Lee Marshall 
offers a vivid account of how ITSM projects start and fail, through a fictitious 
but so typical story. He draws an analogy with Shakespeare’s Hamlet and iden-
tifies five key acts in the ITSM tragedy. See if you identify with any of them.
Act I: New CIO
Our hero, the Chief Information Officer (CIO), joins an IT organization and, 
seeing that there is a lack of standardized processes and mistrust between 
IT and the business, issues the directive that ITIL will be introduced into the 
organization.
The ITSM program had been successful at the CIO's previous organization, 
where she had been an IT director, so why couldn't it be successful here?
The directive is for all IT staff to receive ITIL Foundations training and ITSM 
consultants will be hired to implement ITIL processes.
Act II: Invasion of ITSM consultants
ITIL training is provided in-house to all IT staff. Like most involuntary training 
involving change, twenty percent of staff will embrace it and get excited about 
the opportunities ITIL provides, ten percent will be openly hostile to change, 
and the majority, seventy percent, will take a wait and see attitude. Certificates 
and pins are handed out, and cute Nerf toys are left behind for people to 
throw at each other.
Next, ITSM consultants descend on the organization to hold process design 
workshops, create Visio diagrams and RACI3 charts and produce ITIL process 
binders.
An expensive ITSM software tool is chosen and installed with the help of spe-
cialists, who can't interpret into the tool the processes designed by the other 
ITSM consultants, so they configure the tool the way they want to!
The ITSM consultants then leave behind their process designs and documen-
tation, and the organization is left to begin following these processes and using 
the tool.
Even though user manuals and training sessions have been offered, manage-
ment didn’t realize what a challenge it was to introduce such a big cultural and 
operational change.
3RACI is an accronym for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed

Chapter 1 | Pragmatic or Tragic ITSM
6
Only about 20 percent of people begin following the processes and 20 per-
cent are openly hostile. The rest are indifferent and just wait for this latest 
management fad to go away so they can go back to working like they always 
have.
Act III: Incident, Problem, Change,…Stop
The organization starts with implementing the Incident Management pro-
cess, adds in some service request components, moves on to working on the 
Problem and a root cause analysis process, and then proceeds to modify their 
existing Change Management process to align with ITIL. Then…stop.
At this point, the wind begins to die out of the sails of the ITSM program. 
Champions become disillusioned as they fail to make a business case to move 
forward with implementing the other ITIL processes. People stop following 
the processes, if they ever did, since the ITSM consultants never considered 
how staff would be held accountable for following the processes.
The cultural change associated with ITIL was not considered sufficiently, so no 
real transformation really happens.
Act 4: Disillusionment
The IT service management program begins to die a slow death. The CIO has 
other priorities now, primarily outsourcing all IT development to India; the 
early ITSM champions have left the company, the ITSM software tool is being 
used for 10 percent of its capability, and duplicate tools are being used and 
purchased across the organization.
Managed Service Providers (MSPs), also known as IT outsourcers, are 
approaching the CIO and business unit customers about Software as a Service 
(SaaS) options for key business processes and Cloud Computing concepts for 
replacing the organization’s costly IT infrastructure.
Act 5: Death
The final act of this tragedy is the death of the ITSM program. The CIO moves 
on to another organization and the few staff left that believed in the program 
move on to other projects.
Management and staff who never bought into the program declare it another 
failed management fad. Ironically, more and more IT systems and functions 
are outsourced to managed service providers who understand what service 
management is about. And all that work and effort (and cost) of the ITSM 
consultants?

The ITIL process binders and documentation sit on shelves and network 
drives until they are finally discarded as part of a clean-up project.
Common traps
What lessons can be learned from the many failed ITSM projects?
Circumstances will naturally vary from case to case but, just like history 
repeats itself time and time again (albeit in different places and eras), so do 
the fundamental factors that cause many ITSM projects to fail.
In fact, in many projects, early signs of failure are typically detected by some 
people close to the project, but the warnings fail to trigger corrective action.
Many factors are attributed to failed ITSM initiatives, but I herewith will focus 
on the most fundamental traps I have observed first-hand in my own experi-
ence and in the accounts of others.
Clearly identifying those traps with examples, I hope you will then be able to 
avoid them as you approach your implementation, and resist stakeholders and 
upper management that propose them. They, of course, will not propose them 
as “potential traps to sabotage our ITSM project,” but they will be framed as 
opportunities to kill two birds with one stone, or as basic requirements.
1. Tools mindset
Employees who interact with the IT help desk normally do so out of necessity, 
and when they do, a certain level of tension builds up. Author Nir Eyal tells it 
bluntly to Forbes magazine: “Hating the IT department is a common sentiment 
in almost every company big enough to have such a group.”4
There can be many reasons to explain the widespread distaste for IT support, 
including inadequate staffing, bureaucracy, high turnover, etc… Fundamentally, 
however, there is also a communication barrier that arises because of the dis-
tinctive skill sets and terminology of technical professionals. Failure to appre-
ciate this cultural issue leads some IT managers to put too much stock in the 
power of new prescriptive policies, processes, and tools supposed to cover up 
for this underlying issue.
As business author Jim Collins puts it: “The purpose of bureaucracy is to com-
pensate for incompetence and lack of discipline—a problem that largely goes 
away if you have the right people.”5

Chapter 1 | Pragmatic or Tragic ITSM
8
The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) service management 
best practices framework was proposed in 1989, and since then IT depart-
ments have been trying to “mature” towards the best-practice ideals theorized 
in the ITIL books. Hand in hand with ITIL’s expansion, vendors of ITIL-based 
tools have also flourished. In its annual report on the state of the global cloud-
based ITSM market, TechNavio research group listed 23 competing vendors of 
ITSM solutions, including ServiceNow, BMC, and CA in a market estimated to 
be worth $10–60 billion.6,7
Yet, in a 2015 study on the failed outcome of so many ITSM initiatives, service 
management consultancy Pink Elephant concludes: “failure of many improve-
ment initiatives can be directly attributed to management’s lack of understand-
ing that, by implementing processes within traditional hierarchal organizations, 
they are in reality re-engineering and changing a large part of the IT business 
culture and accountability structure.”8
Parallel theories and tools to fundamentally the same problems flourished 
in the software industry. In order to mitigate the programmer-stakeholder 
communication issues which jeopardize the successful delivery of software 
projects within budget and timeline, a slew of best practice recommendations 
have been proposed, the most notable of which is the Agile development 
methodology, and best practices such as pair programming and users accep-
tance testing. Software development life cycle (SDLC) tools also emerged to 
help teams put those recommendations into practice.
Tools are a welcome part of the solution to IT problems but just like which 
pencil Stephen King uses to write his bestsellers is not the primary factor 
in his success as an author, the success of your organization should not be 
anchored to the tools you use or on the size of your policy documents.
With this understanding, this book does not discuss “how to implement ITIL 
process X in ServiceNow” but, more fundamentally, how to make of your 
ServiceNow instance an effective customer service and collaboration plat-
form, that in context encourages desirable people behavior, and ensures con-
sistent and trackable communication with customers.

2. Requirements greed
In typical waterfall implementations of ServiceNow, IT managers are requested 
to specify up front their requirements for how ServiceNow should be set 
up for their organization. Development partners will then implement those 
requirements in ServiceNow, after which the organization will go live with 
ServiceNow “Phase 1” and start using it.
Because in such a model IT managers have only this opportunity to specify 
their requirements, they understandably try to squeeze the development 
agreement by brainstorming every futuristic feature they can imagine to be 
built in ServiceNow. Otherwise it would feel as if they had left money on the 
table!
The managers will then say that they embrace a phased approach and have 
only specified basic processes to launch with ServiceNow in Phase 1, while 
other requirements will be specified in later phases. In reality, however, Phase 
1 requirements are too big a change, anyway, and the phased approach only 
serves to give them an opportunity to specify later more requirements than 
they could think of now.
To illustrate, consider these proposed requirements for Al Jazeera’s 
ServiceNow implementation in 2012. At the time, among many all-you-can-
eat requirements, the following two requirements were also proposed:
• 
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) integration, such that 
when somebody calls the service desk, a ticket is auto-
matically logged for the call in ServiceNow
• 
Automatic tickets assignment based on individual’s rota
However, five years on in 2017, neither of those requirements have been 
implemented, while a completely different set of requirements have.
Another requirement for Phase I of the implementation was that users would 
automatically be logged into ServiceNow if they accessed ServiceNow from 
a computer connected to the local enterprise network (Single Sign-On). This 
requirement, which requires a particular integration between ServiceNow 
and Al Jazeera’s login system, was ultimately implemented, but only in 2016.
This does not only occur at Al Jazeeera. A widely-cited study by the Standish 
Group examined the requirements of thousands of IT projects and then 
reviewed which of the required features were used in practice.9 The study 
found that many requirements end up never being implemented as originally 
specified, or are implemented but never used in practice, as shown in figure 1-1.

If those numbers seem excessive to you, you are not alone10,11 but you may 
still relate to the co-founder of BaseCamp, Jason Fried’s, personal description 
of the problem:
“I found project-based consulting frustrating because we would work on 
a site for months and hand it over to the client, who would inevitably 
make changes and drag us through their politics. It was rare that what we 
actually built saw the light of day.”
Steve Jobs also offered his advice on the matter: “You have to pick carefully. 
I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. 
Innovation is saying ‘no’ to 1,000 things.”12
When you tell managers about the risk of wasting too much time on require-
ments that end up not being used in practice, they will defend the require-
ments with examples as to why those are really needed and how they are 
guaranteed to deliver tangible value once implemented. Besides that, they are 
really straightforward to implement in ServiceNow, or the implementation 
partners said they can be done within a few days, etc.

Furthermore, because the most common excuse cited to explain why some-
thing goes wrong with an implementation is “poor or changing requirements,” 
business analysts and managers try to thoroughly specify and sign off the 
requirements, lest they later be accused of causing the whole project to fail.
You can do better, by insisting on like-for-like requirements and small beginnings.
Like-for-like requirements
Rather than debate for months how to collect requirements the right way, 
ServiceNow provides an illustrative case study of how Echo Entertainment in 
Australia collected a different type of requirement: like-for-like requirements, 
so the entire implementation only took three months. More than an imple-
mentation, it was a transfer to ServiceNow. As Eric Lewis from Echo puts it: 
“We used ServiceNow straight out of the box, with just a few configuration 
changes to ensure that the tool and our processes were aligned.”13
Like-for-like requirements capture the essence of how things are currently in 
practice, and build the new tool (ServiceNow) just like that. This way, you are 
minimizing the friction for people moving from the old tools (email, HPSM, or 
another set of systems) to ServiceNow.
Note that I don’t recommend that you copy the limitations and issues of the 
current system and force them into the new system, which doesn’t have them. 
Rather, if your current process is simple, it should not be complicated as part 
of the transfer to the new tool. The story below explains what could go wrong 
when you do.
To illustrate the perils of launching ServiceNow together with new business 
processes, consider the story of my first ServiceNow project at Al Jazeera, 
which did not end up being used as originally intended, despite the political 
will of management and a successful technical implementation.
Al Jazeera is a global news organization with small and big bureau offices 
around the world critical for the gathering of news in those places, especially 
when there are breaking stories. Those bureaus are managed by designated 
bureau managers that have a monthly budget to pay for deployments, local 
journalists, and other office expenses. Their finances, HR, and engineering ser-
vices are handled by regional headquarters, which expect bureau managers 
to regularly submit to them invoices and request approvals for new expenses 
and hires.

studies/cs-echo-201211.pdf

Chapter 1 | Pragmatic or Tragic ITSM
12
At headquarters, the International Operations Department responsible for 
the smooth and efficient operation of bureaus complained that many requests 
were delayed in the process fulfillment, and that for operational continuity 
reasons it was often necessary to bypass the official processes and, for exam-
ple, send money to bureaus urgently. Yet it was difficult for the department to 
track where official requests where getting stuck, and why. Each party in the 
chain also blamed one another for not adhering to the official processes, for 
example by not sending all requested invoices, etc.
In order to better track requests and ensure they came in complete and in 
the right direction, a Service Catalog was built in ServiceNow with forms 
that bureau managers would have to fill in to make their requests. Once the 
details were submitted on the portal, the request would automatically be sent 
for approval from the designated managers, or forwarded to the appropriate 
department for fulfillment.
Training sessions were provided to bureau managers, and management 
demanded that all requests be sent through ServiceNow. They even went as 
far as mandating that the receiving departments of finance and HR should not 
process any request that is not received through ServiceNow.
Yet, as told in the typical failure story above, most bureau managers seldom 
used the portal, and the portal was ultimately abandoned, despite the initial 
will of management and ServiceNow’s supposed superiority to email. Why?
Candid bureau managers explained to me that it was easier and faster for 
them to get their business done over email and, since they were squeezed for 
time, they did not want to spend it on ServiceNow forms that they considered 
primarily useful for visibility to management. They argued that if management 
so dearly wants improved visibility over requests, it should hire a dedicated 
person to fill out all the forms on ServiceNow.
For the few bureau managers that used the forms, they faced another obstacle; 
in designing the forms, I had added mandatory fields that stakeholders in the 
finance departments requested me to add to their forms, but that in reality, it 
turns out, were seldom provided (such as the tracking number over which the 
copies of the original expenses were sent).
Bureau managers trying to submit their budget re-consolidation requests on 
ServiceNow found themselves stuck on a mandatory field they did not have 
information for (and none thought of filling it with na, not available).
In the end, a full-time administrator was dedicated to fill out the forms on 
behalf of bureau managers that were responsible for multiple bureaus at 
once, and this ServiceNow-focused administrator also helped the manage-
ment at headquarters review an extract reports about requests submitted on 
ServiceNow. So, some key requests made it into ServiceNow, but not directly 
by the people intended to use them, and not as frequently.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
13
A like-for-like implementation of ServiceNow in the Al Jazeera case would have 
started without forms to fill. It would have identified the network of bureau 
managers and departments emailing each other to fulfill bureau requests, and 
sought to mirror that on ServiceNow without adding any additional steps or 
complexity.
Bureau managers would still be able to trigger the request process by firing 
out an email from their email client (on a desktop or mobile device), but those 
email conversations would also be mirrored on ServiceNow, as a ticket.
Once they come around to the concept of a unique ticket number for each 
request, and started referring to the ticket and all conversation about it 
on ServiceNow as a central source of truth, then request tickets could be 
upgraded, with approvals, automatic assignments, and forms, etc., based on the 
reception and feedback of real users in real situations.
Quick wins
One key decision in your ServiceNow implementation is how many ITIL 
processes you will implement in ServiceNow. In other words, how many 
different ticket types will your service desk, IT teams, and customers have 
to deal with?
The temptation is always to start with all the basic ITIL processes of incident 
management, problem management, and change management. But going by 
the like-for-like requirements principle, the key question becomes which 
processes are you already using effectively?
If you are using those processes already, moving to ServiceNow should, of 
course, not take you a step back and make you abandon some processes.
But to ease the transition and minimize the impact on live operations, you 
may consider migrating to ServiceNow one process at a time, keeping other 
things unchanged.
This will shorten the implementation time, and will also make sure that 
each process in ServiceNow actually delivers value on its own. Note the 
sharp contrast here with management that claims the benefits of the 
ServiceNow implementation can be realized only after multiple ITIL pro-
cesses are implemented together.
Matthias Dieter Hehn from the Volkswagen Group told me that they have 
implemented in ServiceNow only the Request fulfillment process (further dis-
cussed in Chapter 5) and kept Incident management and other ITIL processes 
in their former tool. The purpose was not to implement ServiceNow per se, it 
was to deliver business value and, in the case of Volkswagen, the current setup 
is seen as the best from a cost-benefit analysis perspective.

Chapter 1 | Pragmatic or Tragic ITSM
14
If, however, your organization does not already keep track of problems sepa-
rately from incidents, launching ServiceNow with Problem management, even 
just as it is out of the box, may not work, because the process won’t just 
implement itself in the minds and practices of your people.
Different types of tickets can confuse your support staff, as to which type 
of ticket to use in which case, and cause duplication. Duplicate tickets—for 
example, an incident ticket and problem ticket about the same thing—can 
fragment information and communication lines between the two tickets or 
lead to lost updates.
At Al Jazeera, when we introduced ServiceNow to the support staff in 2013, 
it was also accompanied with an out-of-box implementation of Problem man-
agement as well. But problem tickets were later abandoned completely, and 
we hid access to them until 2016 when the department felt better prepared 
to handle Problem management properly.
From the University of California Davis, IT service manager Ken Jones 
shared a similar experience. There they launched ServiceNow with Request 
Fulfillment together with Knowledge and Incident management all at once. 
But, within weeks, confusion and complaints kicked in and they had to disable 
Service requests in ServiceNow, abandoned Knowledge, and focused on just 
using plain simple incident tickets both to record incidents and requests (as Al 
Jazeera also did). Eventually, both Al Jazeera and UC Davis14 have implemented 
the Request fulfillment processes, but one step at a time.
Circumstances may be different in your organization, but I would generally 
advise you to start using ServiceNow as soon as possible, and with only 
one process, and iteratively implement new processes and phase out earlier 
systems driven by business value. In the case of Echo Entertainment, they had 
a strong incentive to abandon the earlier tool immediately (i.e. an expiring 
licensing agreement).
3. Management power illusion
When asked, middle management typically shreds off responsibility for the 
initiative failure on either insufficient executive support or lack of ITIL training 
at the bottom. But consider again the typical failure story above; if the initia-
tive was endorsed and in fact mandated from the highest management levels, 
why did it fail nonetheless? Why doesn’t management enforce the adoption of 
the tool and associated processes; couldn’t they threaten employees to fill out 
forms in ServiceNow?

The reality of political power inside organizations is more complex than that.
Some business executives like Jeff Bezos, Donald Trump, and Steve Jobs have 
built a reputation for placing high and seemingly impossible expectations on 
their workforce and deploying methods such as intimidation and summary 
dismissal for those who don’t obey.
But, more commonly, management in most organizations have much less lever-
age on their workforce and cannot force them to do things without risking 
disrupting smooth business operation, especially in the case of unanticipated 
events, or risking their positions from escalations about mismanagement. As 
management consultant Kathy puts it:
“Management of an organization cannot force implementation of a new pro-
cess or technology. Likewise, management cannot force people to change. 
Management can create an environment where people simulate change for 
a period of time. Usually, within a few weeks or months, they revert back to 
their old way of doing things.”
Even Jeff Bezos in the end may succumb to what his workforce presents as 
the reality of operations, sometimes wasting millions of dollars in the process.
At one point, Bezos got excited about integrating a search engine on Amazon’s 
website that would list products from other online retailers that were not 
available on Amazon, in return for a commission. So he purchased Junglee, a 
startup that made this search engine and ordered it be integrated on Amazon’s 
website as “Shop the Web.”
But as Brad Stone reports in his book15 about Bezos, Amazon executives 
hated the fact that now customers would leave Amazon.com to buy from 
other retailers, and so the feature ultimately lasted only a few months on the 
website. As for the reason for this slow death, CEO of Junglee Ram Shiram 
cites “total tissue rejection,” that is, the team didn’t buy into it.
The moral of these stories is that top-down support for an initiative is not suf-
ficient. It has worked much less often than people imagine, as rulers and man-
agement know. That is why they normally refrain from spending what famed 
CEO Jack Welsh calls “political capital” on new initiatives. It is better for you 
not to rely on it.

4. ITIL foundation
Training is no doubt important and useful. When a group of people share a 
common set of beliefs and knowledge, they will be much more motivated 
to row in the same direction than if the conclusions of that knowledge are 
imposed upon them.
Some ITIL enthusiasts in the IT department may imagine the ITSM initia-
tive as an opportunity to lecture their customers and colleagues in other 
departments about ITIL, why they should open an incident, what is the differ-
ence between an incident, request or problem, and how they should be given 
an ultimatum to reply once a ticket is “closed.” But that is not the point of 
Service Management!
ITIL was never meant to be taught to your customers, and ServiceNow should 
not be seen as a virtual wall between IT staff and the customers you are paid 
to support.
When ITIL is approached this way, when people reach for support they are 
now told “please open a ticket,” and when they do, their ticket is rejected, and 
they are told that “this is not an incident, it is a request,” and that it should be 
resubmitted through the portal.
Once they go to this portal to submit their request, they are faced by a maze 
of options and knowledge articles.
Previously accustomed to quicker support than this, dissent may bubble up 
to management. Management may also be dismayed by the new IT system 
because when they requested changes from IT, they have now been told to 
wait for the Change Advisory Board (CAB) to convene next week and assess 
the request.
Irritated by such new impairments in supporting the business, I have been told 
of senior management that turned against the ITSM initiative and mandated 
that things be simplified back.
It is easy to sympathize with them; they are paying the IT department a certain 
budget to support the business, not to impair it with apparently bureaucratic 
processes.
The value of ITIL processes comes from making life recognizably easier for the 
people you support, treating them like valued customers unconcerned with 
which agent is on shift, or which team will be involved in fulfilling their request. 
Tickets should let your support staff easily recall the customer's issue without 
her having to re-explain it or know the service desk agent she reported it to, 
or the date and subject of the email she sent.

As Apple puts it introducing the Apple iPad 3: “We believe technology is at its 
very best when it’s invisible. When you’re conscious only of what you’re doing, 
not the device you’re doing it with.”
The same can be said about your ITSM software; at its very best, your custom-
ers should not be aware of the underlying ticketing system that you are using 
to keep track of their support requests.
In an experience-sharing session, CERN Service Manager Reinoud Martens 
explained how using ServiceNow in non-IT departments showed IT at CERN 
how those departments sought to “hide the fact that there is an automated 
process and tickets behind requests and incidents as much as possible,” mak-
ing the system seem “‘more human’ with special notifications, or service 
dependent ‘signatures.’”16
Customer satisfaction definition
Chances are that your department’s objectives are stated in terms of maxi-
mizing customer satisfaction while also maximizing operational efficiency.
This is exactly what the rest of the business expects from the department. 
As Jeff Rumburg from MetricsNet reports: “[customers] want a resolution to 
their problem or an answer to their question, right then and there! Research across 
many different industries bears this out. Customer satisfaction—for virtually any 
type of customer service—strongly correlates with first contact resolution”17 (see 
Figure 1-2).

To further illustrate this with a real example from the customer service industry, 
note how more and more service providers provide help desk support directly 
on Twitter. Research indeed suggests that: “When an airline responded to a cus-
tomer’s Tweet in less than six minutes, the customer was willing to pay almost 
17 more per month for a phone plan if they receive a reply within four minutes.”
As shown in Figure 1-3, Turkish Airlines, for example, even makes a public 
display of how quickly they respond to inquiries sent to them on Twitter18.

Also, Amazon (@AmazonHelp), Dell (@DellCares), and Ford (@FordService) 
have all been providing support on Twitter for years.
Do not let the ITIL industry shield you from those emerging trends in 
customer-friendly support.
5. Practical friction
With sufficient motivation, goodwill, and training (or indoctrination) people in 
your organization may in principle espouse the ITSM initiative and champion 
use of the proposed tool. Even they however may end up abandoning the tool 
for practical reasons.
One of the key problems in ITSM and ERP implementations is that when they 
are introduced in an organization they are introduced together with new and 
often more rigorous business processes or mandatory fields to fill in forms. 
While those processes may seem ideal in theory, or suitable at design time, in 
practice they may not be operable.
Implementers reason that since introducing the new enterprise application 
will involve development effort and training anyway, they can use the tool 
implementation project as an opportunity to develop and introduce new busi-
ness processes as well - a sort of two in one. While this may be desirable, the 
risks of the project failing are now compounded, since resistance to the new 
processes and to the new application will be intertwined.

Chapter 1 | Pragmatic or Tragic ITSM
20
You should be very wary of stakeholders who try to use ServiceNow as a 
Trojan horse for a new or different process that could not otherwise be put 
in practice. If the process is impractical or not flexible enough ServiceNow 
will be abandoned for no fault in the implementation but because the new 
processes it comes with are incompatible with business reality.
For example, if no formal approval was being collected to get a low-value 
purchase through but now in ServiceNow a management approval needs to 
be collected before the process could move forward, uncommunicated issues 
such as the late availability of the designated approver could prevent the new 
process from being followed in practice and, consequently, affect ServiceNow, 
which tied itself to the new approval process. At the very least, every resent-
ment against the new process will be channeled as resentment of ServiceNow, 
which intertwined itself with the new process. You want to avoid this.
The same could be said of seemingly trivial issues such as the need to authen-
ticate with a password before triggering or approving a process that was 
previously triggered with a simple managerial email.
Staff may circumvent the system simply because of login issues and the urge 
to get things done.
It’s much safer to phase out change decoupling the tool implementation from 
the introduction of new more rigorous processes, until people get practically 
accustomed to ServiceNow in real life operations first.
Email integration
You may think that user engagement is a challenge only for enterprise applica-
tions such as ServiceNow because of the work-related nature of the applica-
tion. But actually user adoption is a key challenge even for social media sites 
and they deploy various strategies to draw in new members to their network 
and then keep them coming back. Interestingly, it turns out that social media 
adoption is driven by email.
In 2010, Facebook acquired a Malaysian startup called Octazen, known for 
importing contacts from many email providers. Why would Facebook be invest-
ing in a company that imports contacts from less popular email providers?
Former growth-team leader at Facebook Chamath Palihapitiya explains that 
at Facebook they calculated that for a new Facebook user to become engaged 
she had to befriend at least seven people on Facebook within ten days of 
creating the account19. So access to your email contacts is a valuable way to 
acquire new members, through the invitation Facebook sends on your behalf.

21
Facebook will also send email notifications to your inbox when a friend of 
yours tags you in a photo or something else happens that may draw you 
back to Facebook. Until you become a habitually engaged user that checks 
Facebook on her own.
Other social media sites employ similar strategies, all trying to pull you from 
your email inbox to their application. Twitter, in addition to personal notifica-
tions about people reacting to your tweets also emails you about topics and 
celebrities that are trending on Twitter.
As of 2012, MediaPost estimates that most social interactions between people 
online were still done via email and according to Tynt.com, a web sharing plug-
in, 80% of links are exchanged via email.20
Today's number may be lower but, as an indication of email's continued popu-
larity even outside the corporate world, note how the New York Times has a 
dedicated page that shows which articles have been most shared via email 
(Figure 1-4).
If email is so important even for social media engagement, imagine how 
entrenched email is in corporate culture.
Despite the plethora of enterprise collaboration tools out there, in most 
organizations email remains the primary medium of written communication 
and the one through which most organizations’ work gets done. For this 
reason, the most successful project management and enterprise collaboration 
tools learned to integrate with email and ServiceNow is no exception to this.

22
Basecamp, for example, a popular web-based project management tool not 
only sends you email notifications about Basecamp activity relevant to you, 
but it also allows you to update projects and even create new tasks directly 
from email.
In ServiceNow, a seamless email integration will let your customers open and 
update ServiceNow tickets for your team via email without even realizing it, 
and by doing so they will unconsciously spur adoption of ServiceNow at your 
organization.
You will be maintaining familiar support and communication over email, but 
with ServiceNow behind the scenes orchestrating the communication’s flow 
(as you define in ServiceNow).
It’s a pragmatic approach and somewhat tool-agnostic, but one that should 
enable you to realize the benefits of ServiceNow as a service management 
workflow engine while leveraging the familiarity and reach of email. Once 
people are accustomed, you can also encourage them to use ServiceNow’s 
interfaces, if they wish (as discussed in chapter ten).
Ease of access
If you spend a day with the IT help desk in most organizations you will be struck 
at how many of the phone calls that they receive are about password resets.
Logins with passwords are also known to hamper purchases and usage of 
online applications and for this reason many online websites now allow you to 
log into their service using your Facebook or Microsoft login instead of creat-
ing another one with them. Google is also planning to introduce an alternative 
for passwords in its Android applications to eliminate the user frustration 
associated with remembering and forgetting passwords.21
Also you should avoid having separate passwords for accounts in ServiceNow; 
and If you synchronize your ServiceNow credentials with your directory 
server, your ServiceNow users can log in directly with their Windows user-
name and password instead of having to manage and remember different 
passwords.
A robust LDAP integration between your ServiceNow instance and your 
directory server can also minimize your day-to-day administrative burden 
(see chapter 3 for details).
Those were some of the fundamental traps that sabotage IT initiatives 
approached with inappropriate expectations.

Innovators’ 
ITSM strategy
How to trace a path of least resistance for 
ServiceNow at your organization
Chapter 1 described common traps to watch out for when approaching your 
ITSM initiative and offered pragmatic principles for avoiding them. In this chap-
ter we go further, and review a five-step general implementation strategy that 
applies the recommended principles.
Understandably, circumstances will vary from organization to organization, 
and so you may introduce ServiceNow at your organization following a 
completely different plan. Nonetheless, the proposed plan discussed in this 
chapter captures the essence of several successful ServiceNow implementa-
tions and bears direct relation to a well-researched strategy recognizable in 
the story of many successful business initiatives in general. As was observed in 
the research of Harvard business school professor Clayton Christensen, best 
known as the author of the classic Innovator’s Dilemma.
Assessing your plan against the implementation strategy proposed in this 
chapter shall help you recognize potential risks in your plan, and identify paths 
of least resistance for your implementation plan to proceed more smoothly. 
After all, one does learn from experience.

Take legendary Benjamin Franklin for example. In his classic auto-biography,1 
he describes how he observed from experience the “impropriety of present-
ing one’s self as the proposer of any useful project that might be supposed to 
raise one’s reputation in the smallest degree above that of one’s neighbors, 
when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project.”
Benjamin then found a way to propose his useful projects without stirring 
much envy from his peers and temporarily sacrificing his vanity. He then recalls 
how “in this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practiced 
it on such occasions, and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recom-
mend it.” The same goes for the general strategy proposed in this chapter; it is 
tried-and-tested and, as we shall see with examples from Al Jazeera and other 
customers, I can heartily recommend it.
In this chapter:
• 
Where to start: How to pick the first users to start your 
ServiceNow revolution and make your quick win. It prob-
ably should not be your main IT help desk.
• 
When and how to expand: How to know if it is time to 
expand ServiceNow to other teams, and how to do it 
under favorable conditions that will let you win in the 
expectations game.
Overview
In his research, Professor Christensen pondered how come so many great 
companies fail epically so many times, while new competitors apparently 
emerging out of the blue consistently manage to out-compete the estab-
lished incumbents despite fewer resources and un-established reputation. 
Management was certainly not “stupid,”2 but Christensen observed flaws in 
the decision-making process of established market leaders that actively dis-
card the initially modest ideas that smaller competitors instead nurture to 
great success.
He observed that disruptors like Netflix’s movies-by-mail business for 
example do not start by competing head-on with incumbent market leaders 
in Blockbuster-like movie rental shops. Netflix instead first went after an 
underserved niche: People looking for unpopular films and willing to wait for 
their delivery over the mail.

27
The same pattern could be observed in Toyota’s inexpensive Corolla cars, 
Sony’s Walkman portable stereo, and Uber’s good-enough alternative to car 
ownership for some people.
Examining real-world case studies such as these Christensen identified that 
they all followed a similar pattern, dubbed the innovator’s solution. In a nut-
shell, and in my own words the tried-and-tested solution observed was to:
	1.	 Start with easy-to-please customers at the outskirts of 
the market;
	2.	 Observe what jobs customers hire the product for and 
improve it for those specific circumstances;
	3.	 Patiently but profitably capture opportunities to climb 
upmarket, satisfying more customers from the bottom 
up;
	4.	 Emerge as an irresistible mainstream offering, while it is 
too late for established competitors to battle you.
In the first two steps management pursues an emerging strategy, not yet  
committing to a plan for market dominance.
Only after going live with profitable small customers and setting up a cost 
structure that is pleased with those low-hanging fruit opportunities a proven 
strategy emerges to dominate the market.
Emphasizing the importance of pursuing this iterative strategy Christensen 
notes: “Research suggests that in over 90 percent of all successful new busi-
nesses, historically, the strategy that the founders had deliberately decided to 
pursue was not the strategy that ultimately led to the business’s success.”3 
Their ability to identify what works and switch gears is what enabled them to 
succeed nonetheless.
Intel Corporation for example, started as a manufacturer of memory chips 
(DRAM) and it took a while for management at Intel to realize that micropro-
cessors instead (at first made for a calculator project) were going to be the 
future of the business.
The five-step strategy outlined above is, of course, not the only way to win 
in a market; One could skip all the way to step three and offer mainstream 
customers arguably superior products. But Christensen’s analysis found that 
this is precisely what large organizations have almost always done before they 
failed.

Put simply, you have thin chances of success competing for mainstream cus-
tomers from the start and a high risk of losing your upfront investments, 
while those that start from the outskirts with modest plans tend to have 
more success in the end. Management can have huge visions in both cases, 
the difference is in the approach only.
In my own research I found remarkable similarity between Christensen’s analysis 
of failed product launches and failed ITSM initiatives: Smart and competent people 
on both sides, the same unexpected yet common failed outcome. Furthermore, 
I could identify Christenen’s solution pattern in the things that worked in our 
ServiceNow implementation at Al Jazeera and verified the same with other 
ServiceNow customers and case studies.
Based on this insight, I propose a ServiceNow implementation strategy that 
could be used as the basis for your patient-but-revolutionary ServiceNow 
implementation, if you manage to convince management of it and resist 
big-bang temptations.
Step 1: Pick your customers
The internal customers to whom you first offer ServiceNow matter a lot as 
they may become active advocates or doom the initiative. By internal customer 
I mean teams that will use ServiceNow to handle their daily operations work.
As Christensen notes, successful innovators avoid the obvious customer for 
their product as those will be invested in another system.
Even though ServiceNow may be arguably better the switch can be slow and 
packed with challenges, and politics. A much better starting point is to find 
either:
	1.	 Internal customers that are not using a software system 
yet but have grown in need for one;
	2.	 Internal customers that have abandoned a software system 
not because it lacks advanced features, but because they 
needed something simpler and easier to use. (Note how 
this is different than offering them something that is more 
functional than their current system.)
Customers like these will eagerly accept ServiceNow for its core functionality 
and will have a low baseline to compare it with (email and spreadsheets, or a 
legacy system they didn’t fully use).

Examples
At Al Jazeera, the central IT help desk was not the first internal customer to 
use ServiceNow. It was the fourth, almost a year after other departments and 
teams had been using it.
At CERN, winner of ServiceNow’s Innovation Award in 2011,4 it was the 
non-IT general services department that has been cited for triggering the 
ServiceNow project, while replacing the Remedy system in the IT department 
did not go live until 2013.5
As said in the earlier chapter, the Volkwsagen group, which made a presenta-
tion of its ServiceNow Services catalog in 2013, has not yet migrated other 
ITIL processes from HPSM to ServiceNow.
The more case studies you consider, the more you will find this a recurring 
pattern with many ServiceNow customers. This helps explain ServiceNow’s 
expansion outside the traditional IT market and into so-called Enterprise 
Service Management.
To further illustrate the challenge faced by introducing ServiceNow head-on 
as a replacement for an existing ticket system that the IT department is used 
to, consider how the widespread adoption of ServiceNow at Al Jazeera first 
unfolded.
At Al Jazeera, even though the central IT help desk openly complained about 
its current ITSM tool replacing their system came with many pre-conditions 
often dependent on improvements in other tools (e.g. ActiveDirectory),  
agreements with other teams and business users, and inflated expectations 
about what ServiceNow should offer from the get-go (e.g. a smart rota  
system that automatically assigned tickets based on workload and skill). There 
was a lot of discussion - and a stalemate.
The IT system and network teams, by contrast, had already started using 
ServiceNow to log and keep track of major changes they planned to make to 
the IT infrastructure. What made it easy for them to start using ServiceNow’s 
Change Management tickets right away and without pre-conditions was that 
they needed to prove that they had planned and obtained approval before 
making potentially risky infrastructure changes, or ones that involve downtime 
of business critical services, and they had no system for that. Engineers and 
team leads found in ServiceNow’s change request tickets an official-enough 
reference to cover their backs.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
31
Outside IT, a non-IT department in the business was interested in centralizing 
their communication channels with international bureaus under one system. 
As told in Chapter 1, it was not easy to launch ServiceNow there either but 
within a few months a nine-forms Requests catalog for shared services was 
eventually rolled out (see Figure 2-2).
Then again, another group in the IT department got interested in ServiceNow. 
Senior management in the IT department was looking for a solution to better 
manage the department’s many contracts and their renewal process ahead of 
the contracts’ end dates.
Acknowledging the need for some system and not having one, management 
was interested in using ServiceNow as a searchable repository of the depart-
ment’s contracts and to trigger scheduled reminders to specific people to 
remind them of the contract renewal process. So it was that limited-scope 
Contracts Management in ServiceNow was rolled up, even before Incident 
Management was.
Then came a new big customer for ServiceNow, from the United States. Al 
Jazeera had acquired Current TV to launch its new Al Jazeera America (AJAM) 
channel and integration works were to be completed before the new channel 
would go live on air. As part of this integration, AJAM management wanted 
better visibility of all support requests received and still-pending action. A 
shared inbox was just not enough for them.
There had been a ticketing system but it was seldom used, while most 
support requests were sent through by email to a team of super-busy techni-
cal heroes who were also working on the channel setup. Offering to integrate 
ServiceNow with email, ServiceNow was again seen as a better alternative to 
the status quo.

department as first Requests user of ServiceNow

Step 2: Set expectations
In picking your initial customers, I recommended that you go after customers 
whose expectations can be met with ServiceNow as it is Out-Of-Box (OOB).
In defining the initial scope for the implementation with them you should also 
make sure that by using ServiceNow they are not outstretching the level of 
complexity that they are already used to handle in their previous system.
Even if ServiceNow can do it OOB, offering all ITIL processes to a team 
that just used email conversation for all their issues, problems, and feature 
requests can be overwhelming. As Gustav Hoyer, former IT director at Sony 
Pictures puts it: “ServiceNow is incredibly agile. You don’t have to worry about 
scalability; you just need to make sure the functionality is rolling out at a rate 
that human beings can absorb.”6
As such, you can use this criteria to determine what should be in-scope and 
out of it for the implementation project:
	1.	 How close is the proposed scope to ServiceNow’s core 
functionality (OOB)?
	2.	 How close is it in terms of complexity to what the cus-
tomer is already familiar with and actively using?
The diagram in Figure 2-3 schematically illustrates how to identify the initial 
scope for a ServiceNow launch, after which an example is given from Al Jazeera 
America’s implementation of ServiceNow.
Initial scope
When ServiceNow was launched to the support teams at Al Jazeera America 
(AJAM) the purpose was to have a single system of record for support staff 
to collaborate on and track issues until their successful resolution, and to 
have an accessible archive for later reference and analysis. So the scope of the 
implementation was limited to:

ebook/downloads/Sony_Pictures_Automate_the_IT_Value_Chain.pdf

Spinning Up ServiceNow
33
Users
The newly-formed technology teams in New York and other support hubs 
across the United States, supporting Al Jazeera’s America’s staff only.
Processes
Teams were to keep following their established processes, the execution of 
which was currently being tracked in email conversations and manually popu-
lated spreadsheets. ServiceNow was expected to facilitate the execution of 
those processes.
Baseline
Prior to ServiceNow staff could easily reach staff over email, in person, or 
over the phone. All support staff had access to a shared mailbox and were able 
to instantly assist the customer.
Using ServiceNow should not involve more labor on any part (end-user or 
supporter) in requesting support or providing it. The added traceability and 
order of tickets in ServiceNow was expected to provide more consistent 
handling of tickets and fewer instances of neglected aging tickets, and reduce 
the impact of “who shouts the loudest.”
Goals
As you can imagine, launching ServiceNow management also envisioned the 
ability to launch Change Management in ServiceNow, a request portal, as well 
as other ITIL processes as part of the launch. Below is only a subset of the 
goals that were stipulated for the launch, but more usefully, it is those that 
were actually achieved:
	1.	 Collaboration: Support staff in America effectively manage 
their individual work queues, as well as distribute work 
amongst teams more effectively than over emails using an 
easy-to-use an collaboration system (ServiceNow).
	2.	 Traceability: Supervisors have visibility over all work being 
handled by the support organization with the ability to 
peek into particular trouble areas (e.g., ageing tickets).
	3.	 Fit for purpose: ServiceNow basic interfaces are custom-
ized to fit what works for AJAM’s support workflows and 
needs.

Chapter 2 | Innovators’ ITSM strategy
34
	4.	 Access control: AJAM support staff accessed ServiceNow 
using their Al Jazeera credentials and could self-manage 
access to ServiceNow without need of external expertise.
	5.	 Automation: Emails sent to the support email address were 
received by ServiceNow and automatically converted into 
tickets, freeing requesters and support staff from having to 
open a ticket for support requests received by email.
	6.	 Callers’ experience: Asking for support and interact-
ing with support staff should remain straightforward, 
and requesters should find the email notifications they 
receive appropriate in content and frequency.
Step 3: Minimal setup
The setup to start managing incidents in ServiceNow at its minimum would 
only involve configuring users’ access to ServiceNow, but would typically also 
include configuring email notifications, assignment groups, and a few custom-
izations like setting categories and locations.
To guide implementors through the setup there is in ServiceNow an ITSM 
Guided Setup that takes them through a 12-step setup (see Figure 2-4) to:
• 
Map your organization’s structures in ServiceNow: users, 
groups, locations, departments, companies, etc.;
• 
Configure connections with your email and authentica-
tion servers;
• 
Define categories, assignment workflows, date formats, 
mandatory fields, Service-Level Agreements, etc.;
• 
Set up a Service Portal, design forms, and management 
dashboards.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
35
For guidance at an architectural level, Part 2 of the book goes over your 
options for managing users’ access (Chapter 3), routing incoming emails 
appropriately (Chapter 4), and sending elegant email notifications (Chapter 5). 
Chapter 6 shows you examples of Service Portals, and Chapter 7 talks about 
how to make reporting useful for all at all levels.
Step 4: Go live quickly
On its website ServiceNow showcases Pacific Aluminum from Brisbane, 
Australia for having completed its implementation project within 30 days, but 
going live within eight days of starting the project.7
At Al Jazeera America a few months passed between project start and actual 
deployment but most of that time was actually spent on other activities, wait-
ing, and supporting existing non-AJAM users on ServiceNow.
Other ServiceNow customers also report taking months in negotiation and 
preparation for the launch.
As the AJAM channel launch on air approached I was flown to New York to 
fast-forward the go-live with ServiceNow. Once on-site, it took ten days to go 
live with a minimal setup.

Chapter 2 | Innovators’ ITSM strategy
36
Most of the time on-site was not even spent on the tool, it was on coordi-
nation, training, and hand-holding after go-live. AJAM officially started using 
ServiceNow before the LDAP integration was complete, as it took a while to 
set it up between Al Jazeera’s servers and ServiceNow’s.
Milestones
The key milestones of the implementation were:
	1.	 User profiles of AJAM staff are all available in ServiceNow.
	2.	 Each of the support staff in AJAM logs into ServiceNow 
with their Windows logins, knows how to see all AJAM 
tickets, and how to collaborate on any ticket (assign or 
update).
	3.	 Support staff has access and knows how to revoke or 
grant same access to new members in the team.
	4.	 Email notifications are sent successfully on behalf of the 
Service Desk to the right people about new and updated 
tickets.
	5.	 Emails sent to the Support email address are successfully 
received in ServiceNow to create new tickets automati-
cally, or update existing ones.
	6.	 Ability to monitor instance and correct functioning, abil-
ity to immediately restore smooth operations with alter-
native solution, and tight control over changes that could 
impact multiple users in ServiceNow.
Numerous other ServiceNow customers who spoke at the ServiceNow 
knowledge conferences or are showcased by ServiceNow were able to go 
live within weeks. This is not a feature of their smartness or resources, or even 
maturity; it is often a reflection of how small their scope was and how few 
customizations they made.
Back to the Sony Pictures example which launched within 60 days, Gustav 
Hoyer said: “We are not going to customize the tool. We are going to use 
ServiceNow as is and assume that has been battle-tested. This is how incident 
works, end of discussion.”

Spinning Up ServiceNow
37
In online journalism, the mantra coined by news media expert Jeff Jarvis is 
“Publish first, edit later” while in the Art of the Start 2.0,8 the former chief 
Apple evangelist promotes the concept of “Don’t worry be crappy” as an invita-
tion to ship products early, even if they are far from perfect, and then based 
on actual feedback, improve it.
In case you wonder if Apple used to do this too, consider how the first iPhone 
did not support 3G Internet browsing while other Nokia phones did at the 
time, for example. The first iPhone was revolutionary in many ways, and 
backward in a few mainstream features.
Also note how the first iPhone only allowed third-party contribution as Safari 
Internet browser extensions. But then it changed course, and instead released 
developer tools and APIs to develop apps, and released the App Store.
The idea from launching early is that when real people use your product in 
real-world situations, you can observe how they use it and not use it, and 
make it better for real. This suits ServiceNow very well, given how flexible it is 
to customize after go-live (see Part 3 for after-go live guidance).
Step 5: Refine and emerge
After going live with ServiceNow at Al Jazeera America, I stayed there to assist 
the teams using ServiceNow, observe what was not practical or caused confu-
sion, and fine-tuned ServiceNow to fit the job better.
It is important to note that at AJAM there was a daily stream of new people 
joining and that had to use ServiceNow, so we could not rely on expecting 
them to remember how to do the right thing. We had to make doing the right 
thing the default thing to do.
Throughout the book and in Chapter 11 you will find details of changes made 
to ServiceNow in the pursuit of eliminating room for error and encouraging 
the desired behavior, as ServiceNow usage grew globally.
How do you know if people are actually using ServiceNow effectively? Reports 
in ServiceNow (Chapter 7) can measure different aspects of ServiceNow 
usage to determine what is not being used effectively, or who it is who is not 
using it. From there you can decide to simplify procedures, change defaults, or 
approach the people in question.

After the successful launch of ServiceNow at AJAM, there was more appetite 
for using ServiceNow by the core teams in Doha, and many of the earlier 
hurdles disappeared. Something like ServiceNow at AJAM was now consid-
ered sufficient, and in fact desirable.
The more teams signed up to use ServiceNow, the more people interacting 
with those teams received neat email notifications sent from ServiceNow 
about their ticket’s status (see Chapter 5). The word spread quickly and more 
teams and managers asked to use ServiceNow in their team.
Then HR teams also got interested in using it to track their requests and col-
laborate on issues with ERP teams.
In the end, ServiceNow had emerged as a mainstream corporate applica-
tion used daily, while the discourse changed from “What are all the things 
ServiceNow should be able to do before it can be beneficial to us” to “Why 
are not we on ServiceNow also?!”
This is what I also hope for your implementation. It takes patience and comes 
with uncertainty as to how exactly things will unfold, but if it works it will be 
worth it.
As you on-board more teams, new issues show up that can jeopardize current 
users or hinder new ones (e.g., confidentiality). Part 3 of this book proposes 
solutions to common issues faced at this stage.
Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
It’s easier to start with customers who desire ServiceNow 
for its core functionality. Seek them first.
• 
Those starting modestly from the outskirt tend to suc-
ceed in the end. They too can have huge visions, the dif-
ference is in the approach only.
• 
Change the discourse from “What are all the things 
ServiceNow should do before it can be beneficial to us” 
to “Why are not we on it also?!”
• 
Big things have small beginnings. Going live quickly is not 
a feature of maturity, it is a reflection of how small the 
scope is.
• 
When real people use your product in real-world situa-
tions, you can observe how they use it and not use it and 
make it better for real.
• 
Push out quickly, follow up, make corrections, push again, 
make corrections, push again, and so forth.

Part 1 made a case for going live with the minimum configuration possible. 
Here is what needs setup, whatever teams or processes you go live with.
Rather than a chore setup, Part II casts the light on opportunities to reduce 
friction for users on both ends of a ServiceNow ticket.
Although more technical than Part I, in Part II we cover basics that being 
aware of as the manager in charge of ServiceNow will help you safeguard it 
from breaches and ensure spam is not sent on your behalf.
ServiceNow comes with a Guided ITSM Setup module to guide your adminis-
trator in the setup. This part of the book is a similar guide, but at a functional 
level to give you an understanding of key aspects of ServiceNow and insight 
to effectively oversee it after go-live, as well.

User access
What you need to know about access in 
ServiceNow
This chapter is the first of five chapters intended to help you as the project 
manager of a ServiceNow implementation prepare for the go-live.
In this chapter you will get an overview of how users profiles will be created 
and updated in ServiceNow, and considerations that will affect user adminis-
tration after go-live.
In this chapter:
	1.	 Types of users: What presence in ServiceNow is needed 
for your end-users;
	2.	 Efficient users administration: How to efficiently grant 
(and revoke) access to new members and teams getting 
on ServiceNow;
	3.	 Access levels: Who has access to what, and how to protect 
users data;
	4.	 Stability Considerations: What if things break;
	5.	 ServiceNow licenses: How access roles affect your 
ServiceNow contractual implications;

Chapter 3 | User access
42
In ServiceNow’s Guided ITSM Setup, one of the first steps is LDAP integra-
tion (Figure 3-1). LDAP is an IT acronym for Lightweight Directory Access 
Protocol which basically lets an application like ServiceNow access users 
profiles in your organization’s directory server, usually Active Directory by 
Microsoft.
For your Servicedesk to effectively log and manage tickets in ServiceNow 
everyone in your organization will need to have a user profile in ServiceNow 
even if they will never log in.
This is because in order to log a ticket for someone in your organization and 
provide them with updates about her ticket over email, there first needs to be 
a selectable user profile for her in ServiceNow (see Figure 3-2).
With the LDAP integration, you automatically sign up everyone into 
ServiceNow and reduce the overhead of user administration in ServiceNow 
by a large degree.
Figure 3-1.  LDAP integration is a step in ServiceNow’s basic ITSM Guided setup.
Figure 3-2.  Every incident in ServiceNow needs to be logged against a user profile already 
in ServiceNow.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
43
Without an LDAP integration, it is still possible to create user profiles 
automatically every time someone from your organization emails support and 
a ticket is opened automatically (see next chapter for tickets via email). So if 
after reading this chapter you decide that LDAP integration is not feasible for 
your circumstances, you still have an option to create user profiles on the fly 
(see Figure 3-3).
With the LDAP integration setup however it will be much simpler to log 
tickets for anyone, and richer user profiles will be imported in ServiceNow 
with details such as the full name, phone number, title, and location (if those 
details are recorded in your LDAP server).
LDAP integration automatically updates ServiceNow every time user profiles 
are updated in your directory server. From a maintenance prospective, this is 
a big plus.
Savvy end users will also be able to log into ServiceNow and preview all of 
their support requests, while all users will have tickets logged against their 
accounts without them needing to know what ServiceNow is and that they 
have an account in it.
LDAP integration
ServiceNow comes with built-in support for the integration with Active 
Directory servers and ServiceNow’s official documentation provides a 
comprehensive walk-through of all the steps involved in a standard integration.

Chapter 3 | User access
44
Nonetheless, the integration is still a fairly complex setup and requires 
collaboration between your Active Directory administrators, network team 
and your ServiceNow administrator.
Appendix C lists detailed technical requirements and prerequisites to import 
and sync user profiles from your organization’s directory servers, and to pro-
vide your support team members with adequate access. Here is a high-level 
overview of the process.
How it works
People in your organization log into the organization’s computers or wireless 
network by using a user account set up for them by IT when they joined the 
organization.
Every employee has a user profile in the organization’s directory servers and 
whenever a user attempts to log into the corporate Wi-Fi their device connects 
to those directory users to verify that the input credentials match those stored 
in the directory servers. If they do, access to the network is granted.
The LDAP integration with ServiceNow enables ServiceNow to check with 
your directory servers whether to let in people into ServiceNow or not. So 
when an employee attempts to log into ServiceNow, ServiceNow connects 
to your directory servers and verifies if the input credentials are correct. If so, 
the user is granted access to ServiceNow.
ServiceNow could also import from your directory servers the user profiles 
of your employees including details such as email address, location, depart-
ment, and full names. It could also import group membership details, to know 
to which user groups the employee belongs.
So besides authentication at the time of login ServiceNow also regularly 
connects to your directory servers and imports new user profiles into 
ServiceNow and updates existing ones.
A good thing about the LDAP integration in ServiceNow is that it is only one 
way, from your directory servers to ServiceNow. That is, ServiceNow will only 
read user profiles from your LDAP servers but will never create or overwrite 
data in there. This guarantees the integrity of users’ data in directory servers.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
45
Unique ID
When setting up the integration you will need to decide how to uniquely 
identify users. That is based on which unique field ServiceNow should use to 
create a new user profile, or update an existing one.
By default, ServiceNow will identify users by their username (samaccount-
name in Active Directory), but if your LDAP servers host users from multiple 
domains (e.g., @aljazeera.com and @subsidiary.org) or if your organization 
later changes the format of usernames, for example from firstname.lastname 
to lastname+ initials, or if you change your primary email domain, then the 
mechanism will fail.
In such scenarios users may be duplicated in ServiceNow while tickets will 
remain associated with the account with the old email address.
If this applies to you, you should be careful not to use the email address or 
username to identify and match user profiles; Instead match profiles based 
on a unique and immutable field ID in your LDAP server (e.g., the objectSID).
End users don’t need to know about this, it’s just something to be set up 
behind the scenes for the integration to work smoothly.
Security
ServiceNow describes the read-only LDAP integration as secure because it 
connects “from a single machine that uses a fixed IP address through a specific 
port on the firewall.”1
But if you would rather use LDAPS (secure LDAP), you can also do that 
by uploading a public certificate to be used by ServiceNow for encrypting 
messages to your directory server.
Alternatively, you can set up a VPN between ServiceNow and your network 
so that traffic between the two ends is secured by the VPN. At Al Jazeera we 
use VPN.
As soon as an account is disabled in Active Directory that user will no lon-
ger be able to log into ServiceNow. This is because every login attempt in 
ServiceNow is verified against Active Directory and if the AD servers reply to 
ServiceNow that the user is disabled the login will not go through.
The disabled user will continue to be sent emails from ServiceNow but 
they will probably not be received because the mailbox will be disabled or 
inaccessible.

Chapter 3 | User access
46
Temporary accounts
When accounts are created at your organization for freelancers or interns, 
they may be created with an expiration date after which the account gets 
automatically disabled.
ServiceNow by default does not check for this expiration date field and thus 
the account will indefinitely remain active in ServiceNow until manually dis-
abled, perhaps also affecting your ServiceNow subscriptions totals (discussed 
below). You can however customize ServiceNow to automatically disable 
accounts based on the expiration date.
Performance
Performance can be an issue for large organizations with thousands of users.
To mitigate the performance impact of scheduled synchronizations between 
directory servers and ServiceNow, ServiceNow recommends that you sched-
ule the sync once daily and outside peak hours.
Syncing only once a day means that updates to user details will not take effect 
until the sync occurs the next day, unless the individual user profile is individu-
ally refreshed from ServiceNow on an on-demand basis.
ServiceNow technical online documentation also lists other optimizations 
recommendations (such as paging) to speed up the synch.
Availability
In the event that your directory server is down, what do you do?
It won’t be possible for your users to log into ServiceNow but it probably 
would also be a bigger problem for the entire organization because they will 
be unable to access other critical systems that also rely on the directory, like 
email.
In any case, ServiceNow lets you specify a redundant LDAP server to check 
with in case the primary LDAP server is inaccessible and your organization 
has more than one LDAP server.
In the event that ServiceNow fails to connect with your directory servers, 
ServiceNow can also send an email notification to the users you specify in a 
group called LDAP Admins group (see Figure 3-4).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
47
You also want to make sure that there is a ServiceNow local administrator 
account that is not an LDAP user so that you may at least log into ServiceNow 
using that account to resolve the LDAP issues (e.g., update LDAP configura-
tion settings in ServiceNow).
Groups sync
In addition to synchronizing user accounts you could also synchronize user 
groups.
Every team at your company will most likely have a user group in Active 
Directory and when new people join the organization they are added to the 
groups with which they need to collaborate with. Instead of recreating and 
maintaining those groups in ServiceNow you could have groups in ServiceNow 
synchronize with those in Active Directory.
There are many benefits for automatically importing groups in ServiceNow:
	1.	 It eliminates the friction that results from having to recreate  
groups in ServiceNow and update them manually in 
ServiceNow.
	2.	 It eliminates the need for managing group memberships 
in ServiceNow; It will be all done in Active Directory and 
automatically reflected in ServiceNow.

	3.	 It makes it a lot easier to collaborate on tickets with 
other group and teams, whether they are on ServiceNow 
already or not (also see Chapter 10).
However, it may be that your directory has many other user groups that are 
meant for internal processes and that most people do not know about and 
do not email. Importing them in ServiceNow can make things a bit messier 
than ideal and it may be worth discussing with your directory administrators 
a solution to filter those groups out from the sync with ServiceNow.
Also, even more than usernames, the names and email IDs of groups tend 
to change more frequently (basically with every new manager). To avoid 
duplicating groups in ServiceNow with old and new names, group profiles in 
Active Directory have a unique immutable ID (objectSID) that you can use to 
unequivocally identify groups for your Active Directory sync with ServiceNow.
Location OUs
How do you determine the location of the user?
Directory servers often provide a field to store the location and address but 
this is seldom accurate, standardized, or even uniformly populated for all users.
However, in many directory servers users tend to be segregated in so called 
Organizational Units and those OUs normally represent a location, or 
department.
For example a user profile may be contained in all of IT, Doha, and AwesomeOrg 
OUs.
Other users will belong to different OUs but all users located in Doha, Qatar 
will also belong to the Doha OU. Users in New York Manhattan will be in the 
NYM OU, and so on. Also no user can belong to two geographic OUs.
So in ServiceNow, you can create locations that match the OUs so that they 
are updated directly from LDAP.
Single Sign-On
Single Sign-On in ServiceNow is one of the steps listed in the ITSM Guided 
Setup with built-in support in ServiceNow.
Single Sign-On basically means that people at your organization will need to 
authenticate only once to use your organization’s networks and applications, 
and that they will do this through one single login screen unified across all 
applications in your organization.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
49
In other words, users wanting to access ServiceNow will not have to log in 
because they have already authenticated with your corporate network.
Or if they have not, ServiceNow will redirect them to authenticate with your 
organization’s login screen, instead of ServiceNow’s. SSO eliminates the need 
to log in with corporate applications, and allows for a more seamless user 
experience.
As with the LDAP integration, configuring ServiceNow with SSO is not a con-
figuration on ServiceNow’s end only but requires support from your system 
and network teams.
At Al Jazeera, we had an implementation of SSO that was incompatible with 
ServiceNow and it took considerable setup (and more than two years) before 
we got one that worked with ServiceNow.
Access levels
The basic LDAP integration will enable users to have an account in ServiceNow 
and be able to log in. But they will not have any privileged access in ServiceNow 
and cannot manage or assign tickets. Those privileged access assignments need 
to be configured in ServiceNow.
As of the Istanbul release of ServiceNow, there are over one hundred out-of-box 
access roles that a ServiceNow administrator could grant (see Figure 3-5).
Each role grants fine-tuned access to particular areas of the application that 
you may not need to know about until you need to, but Table 3-1 below 
describes the key five access roles that you should be aware of.
Managing users, access it is important that you:
	1.	 Regularly verify who has administrator access, as they 
could delete all records on your instance;
Figure 3-5. There are over 100 user roles in ServiceNow.

Chapter 3 | User access
50
	2.	 Insist that access is not assigned directly to individual 
users but is instead granted through membership in 
groups that need the access;
	3.	 Make sure you grant access roles in accordance with 
your licensing agreement;
Associating access privileges with user groups instead of individuals directly 
allows you to ensure consistent access roles for all members of the group. 
It also automatically grants and revokes access based on membership in the 
team.
For example, the user_admin role can be assigned to your Servicedesk group 
in ServiceNow so that each member of the Servicedesk automatically gets it 
so long as they are in the group. This makes access roles much more consis-
tent and manageable and reduces the likelihood for users to have more or less 
access roles than expected.
Basic access levels
Table 3-1 shows the five key access roles in ServiceNow.
Table 3-1.  Five key access roles in ServiceNow
Access Role
Description
No role and snc_internal
A user account with no assigned roles can log into ServiceNow 
and update tickets in which she is involved. She cannot for 
example be assigned tickets, view ticket queues assigned to 
a team, or modify ServiceNow in any way, beyond minimally 
personalizing her own account and tickets view.
Your end users may also have a role called snc_internal, 
introduced with the Geneva release of ServiceNow. This role 
is now assigned to all users meant to have at least the above-
described access to the system.
Users without a role (or with snc_internal) usually don’t count 
towards your subscriptions count - you can have as many as you 
want.
approver_user
Users with this role can approve (or reject) items for which 
their approval has been requested. Otherwise users without 
this role cannot approve requests!
If a user has no other role but this role it will be counted as an 
approver license which is counted separately from the standard 
fulfiller license.
(continued)

Spinning Up ServiceNow
51
The ITIL role is the access level intended for people expected to manage tick-
ets in ServiceNow. Anyone with it can view any ticket in ServiceNow.
There is no such thing as confidentiality in ServiceNow out-of-box (see 
Chapter 9 for alternatives); Anyone with ITIL access can view and participate 
on any ticket in ServiceNow.
The user_admin role instead may be conferred to your Servicedesk team to 
manage users and groups in ServiceNow, while the admin role (capable of 
deleting all records) should be granted very restrictively.
A personal story illustrates how harmful the admin role can be on a produc-
tion environment:
One day, I accidentally deleted my home page in ServiceNow. Normally when 
an itil user deletes his home page it only affects his view in ServiceNow and 
ServiceNow will automatically set for him the default home page for itil users.
But when I did it as an admin, I had accidentally deleted the home page for all 
itil users! And I got called on the issue within five seconds of it occurring. The 
Servicedesk group were no longer able to view their tickets queue.
Fortunately I was able to restore the home page within minutes by copying 
from another non-production instance where the same home page was con-
figured (refer to Chapter 8 for advice on managing your ServiceNow environ-
ments), but you get the point!
Table 3-1.  (continued)
Access Role
Description
itil
This is the basic role granted to those meant to actively use 
ServiceNow, assigning and managing ticket queues. With the ITIL 
role they can view and modify any ticket logged in ServiceNow 
as well as be assigned a ticket. They can also view and run 
reports but they cannot delete tickets or modify ServiceNow 
beyond personalizing their own view of tickets or modifying 
tickets content.
Users with the ITIL role and any other role that grants similar 
access to view lists of records normally count as a fulfiller 
subscription.
user_admin
Confers on its holder the ability to create, modify, or delete 
users, groups, locations, and company records in ServiceNow.
admin
This is the super user role in ServiceNow. A user with the 
administrator role can make changes on the application that are 
immediately visible to everyone.

Chapter 3 | User access
52
Using ServiceNow with the admin role is risky and can wreak havoc for all 
users. An admin user that doesn’t need the role in his day-to-day activity may 
be better off having a separate dedicated admin account to be used on a need 
basis only.
Managing licenses
How licenses are counted may depend on your particular contract with 
ServiceNow, so you need to verify the information provided here against your 
actual contract with ServiceNow.
Service Now does not charge you a license for your callers (those users that 
your Servicedesk supports). Callers can have a user account in ServiceNow 
and log in with it to view their own tickets.
Managers and supervisors who receive approval requests from ServiceNow 
require an approver license, if they are expected to approve (or reject) 
requests on their own.
A full fulfiller subscription is required for every member of your support 
teams such as those in the Servicedesk or in the Network team managing 
ticket queues on ServiceNow. A user assigned a fulfiller license (like itil or 
contract_admin, for example), could also have other roles assigned to them 
(e.g., report_admin) and still count as a single fulfiller license. They can also 
approve (or reject) requests without being counted as an “approver” license.
From a licenses management perspective this means that you need to be care-
ful about:
	1.	 The total number of users accounts in your ServiceNow 
instance;
	2.	 The number of users to whom an access role is granted, 
either individually or through membership in a group;
	3.	 Who from your end users you want to be able to approve 
requests “automatically,” and if those will count as an 
approver license.
“Automatically” is in quotes because even without assigning the approver_user 
role to an end-user, you could still send approval requests from ServiceNow. 
You could then collect the approval from the user by other means and have 
the support agent record the approval manually. To avoid this hassle, you need 
an approver license.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
53
LDAP and licenses
Since there is no license fee for users without a role, having all of your orga-
nization as users in ServiceNow through LDAP will not increase your costs. 
It’s free.
You should however be careful with the user groups to which you assign roles. 
Unless each member of your department needs to log into ServiceNow and 
manage ticket queues, they should not be in a privileged group in ServiceNow. 
Only the people actively managing ticket queues warrant such a licensing 
expense.
If you sync group memberships with ServiceNow, you will have a bit of a prob-
lem here. If access roles are attached to groups and are assigned automatically 
through membership in the group then the access role will be shared with 
both active and inactive members of the group. You have a couple options to 
deal with the situation:
Bucket groups
Create bucket groups in ServiceNow and associate access roles to those 
buckets. Then add and remove members to grant and revoke from them 
access roles (and thus licenses).
For example, you can have a Support-people group that grants its members 
the ITIL role and for example the report_group role. You could also have 
another Support-supervisors group that grants some additional roles. As 
usage of the application evolves, you can create new bucket groups such as 
Automatic-approvers, Vendors, Asset-Custodians, etc.
In this manner you continue to have your official groups managed in LDAP 
but also control which access roles are granted to whom consistently in 
ServiceNow.
Routine scripts
Periodically run scripts that revoke access roles from inactive members 
regardless of what the access roles the group membership conferred to the 
user.
For each user in ServiceNow you can know when it was the last time that 
they logged into ServiceNow. It would be wise to regularly check for privi-
leged users that have not logged in for a while and consider revoking their 
privileged access.

Chapter 3 | User access
54
Prior to the Eureka release you were able to check on the number of licensed 
users in your instance. A Subscription Management application was introduced 
in later editions2 but you may still have to check with your ServiceNow sales 
representative to perform an audit. You can however get an accurate predic-
tion by listing all unique users with a not-empty access role.
To access this list in ServiceNow look up User Roles in the Navigator, filter 
out users with empty roles (or with just the snc_internal role) and then group 
the list by users to get a unique count of the users with a role (Figure 3-6).
Vendors access
Your Servicedesk will undoubtedly be dealing with external vendors for cer-
tain issues. Which ticketing system will you use to track dealings that involve 
external vendors?
Many vendors like ServiceNow will have their own ticketing system and will 
expect you to log a ticket through it. But if you have sufficient leverage over 
your vendors or they themselves don’t use a ticketing system, you may get 
them to collaborate on tickets in your ServiceNow instance. This is what 
Dr. Matthias Egelhaaf from Siemens said they do with their vendors.3
Before giving vendors access to manage tickets in your instance consider if it 
would be enough for them to update tickets via email without actually being 
able to log into the instance with the ITIL role.

Spinning Up ServiceNow

This is because if you give vendors the same access as other teams in your 
organization, they will by default be able to view and update any ticket in 
your instance, which could constitute a significant breach of confidentiality 
of your organization’s day-to-day internal affairs (more on confidentiality in 
Chapter 9).
If it’s enough for them to receive and update tickets in which they are men-
tioned then this is easily achievable in ServiceNow without granting your 
vendors any privileged role to your instance.
At its simplest, all you have to do is add their email address to the ticket watch 
list so that they receive notifications for the ticket and can update it by reply-
ing over email. They could also log in but as users without any role and so 
could only view the tickets in which they have been listed. The level of access 
that you give to your vendors depends on the support expectations that you 
have from them.
When you consult certain vendors about an issue, the responsibility for the 
ticket before your customer remains with the internal team that escalated 
the ticket. In such cases, the ticket should remain assigned to the team, which 
will be responsible to chase the vendor for support or find a solution through 
other means.
In such cases it would be sufficient if the vendor is white-listed to reply to 
updates via email (see Figure 3-7).
In other cases, the vendor is expected to take more responsibility for the esca-
lated ticket and resolve it in a timely manner, directly updating the caller of the 
ticket (who for such issues may be from within the Technology department).
Such is normally the case with external development partners or outsource 
service providers who are almost considered an extension of the internal 
support organization. In those cases it makes sense to have the vendors as a 
support team to which tickets can be assigned.
In this case you need to give them more than end-user access but you should 
also restrict their access from seeing all tickets in your system. This is not sup-
ported by ServiceNow out-of-box and will have to be customized.
Figure 3-7.  Property to list the email domains of your vendors from which you want to 
acccept emails in ServiceNow.

Chapter 3 | User access
56
Alternatively, if you implement access on a need-to-know basis as described in 
Chapter 9 it will restrict access to other team’s tickets and so you could safely 
grant vendors the same access as other fulfiller teams in your organization.
Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
LDAP lets an application like ServiceNow access users 
profiles in your organization’s directory server.
• 
LDAP users tend to be segregated in OUs that normally 
represent a location or department. Use that to set users’ 
locations in ServiceNow.
• 
Don’t use the username to identify and match profiles; 
Match profiles based on an immutable ID in your LDAP 
server (e.g., the objectSID).

Why open tickets automatically from email and 
how to do it without disappointing customers
If you want to drive retention and repeat usage, there isn't a better way 
to do it than email.
—Fred Wilson,1 Co-founder of Union Square Ventures
The quickest way to hook ServiceNow in the everyday workflows of your 
organization is to let ServiceNow receive emails and automatically convert 
them into ServiceNow tickets. This frictionless approach works even if you 
hope to eliminate email one day (Chapter 10).
Recognizing the power of email, every ServiceNow instance comes with an an 
email address built into it. If you send an email to this email address it will auto-
matically open a ticket in ServiceNow. But telling everyone at your organiza-
tion “Please email something4593@service-now.com” (your instance email 
address) would sure be confusing to most people who would not expect that 
to contact their service desk three feet away they should instead contact an 
external email address.

Chapter 4 | Email support

In this chapter:
	1.	 Tickets creation via email: An overview of the different 
options you have to auto-create and assign tickets in 
ServiceNow from email.
	2.	 Email issues: Deal with issues that arise processing email 
replies to tickets, spam, and legal disclaimers.
Email address
Every ServiceNow instance comes out of the box with a built-in email address.
You could also configure ServiceNow to connect to your email servers to use 
your own email address for incoming emails be it directly through the support 
email address communicated to your organization or a new email address 
dedicated to ServiceNow.
But by configuring your own email address in ServiceNow you also introduce 
connectivity issues between your email servers and ServiceNow and the need 
to update your email settings in ServiceNow.
Creation options
You have a couple of options for how to create tickets in ServiceNow with 
varying degrees of automation.
To also auto-assign the created tickets based on the sender’s location or the 
email address that they sent to, refer to the full discussion in Chapter 11.
Option 1: Forward emails
Simply forwarding emails to your ServiceNow email address may be the sim-
plest option but ServiceNow will receive the email as sent from the person 
that forwarded it.
This means the original sender for the ticket will not be recorded as the caller 
of the ticket and will not receive a notification about it until a Servicedesk 
agent modifies the ticket and provides an update.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
59
Option 2: Redirect emails
Unlike forwarding, with mailbox redirection emails are automatically trans-
ferred as-is from one email mailbox to another.
Mailbox redirection can be set by your email administrator and doesn’t require 
sharing of passwords nor any change in ServiceNow. Here is how it works:
	1.	 End-users send support emails to your official support 
email address (e.g. helpdesk@your.org).
	2.	 Your email server receives the emails sent to the help-
desk and redirects them to your ServiceNow’s instance 
email.
	3.	 ServiceNow receives the emails sent from the end users 
as if they were sent directly to ServiceNow and creates 
new tickets on behalf of the senders.
This simple solution strikes through most requirements, letting you leverage 
the benefits of using ServiceNow’s built-in instance email and also not change 
the email address that you have communicated to your end users. You can also:
• 
Configure your mailbox to keep a backup copy of each 
email received before redirecting it to ServiceNow;
• 
Set up filters in your mailbox so that emails that match 
certain conditions are not redirected to ServiceNow.
Also, if you have more than one support email addresses that you would 
like to receive as tickets in ServiceNow (e.g., helpdesk-abc@your.org and  
helpdesk-xyz@your.org) you can set up mailbox redirection on them also so 
that they too automatically redirect all incoming emails to ServiceNow.
At Al Jazeera, the teams in New York, London, and Instanbul had their mail-
boxes automatically redirected to ServiceNow as described above. For the 
Servicedesk team in Doha however we had to devise another setup.
Option 3: Drag and drop emails
Despite the possibility of filtering out emails with specific filters both in your 
email mailbox and in ServiceNow some teams resist the idea of having all their 
emails automatically redirected to ServiceNow.

Chapter 4 | Email support
60
They want to manually pick which emails end up in ServiceNow and which 
to keep in their inbox. Once they decide that a certain email should become 
a ticket in ServiceNow you can have the ticket automatically created in 
ServiceNow by simply moving the email to a folder in their mailbox dedicated 
to ServiceNow. Here is how it works:
	1.	 Create a new email address (e.g., ServiceNow@your.org)  
and on it set up automatic mailbox redirection as 
described in Option 2.
	2.	 Make the mailbox visible with write-only access and add 
it as an additional mailbox for your team.
	3.	 To create a ticket in ServiceNow from a received email 
drag and drop the email into the additional mailbox in 
your email client.
	4.	 Once dropped into the mailbox it will be immediately 
redirected to ServiceNow and a ticket will be created.
Unlike forwarding emails (Option 1) moving emails to the mail folder that 
redirects email to ServiceNow will preserve the email headers and so 
ServiceNow will log the ticket as if it were sent from the caller directly.
Option 4: Manually log tickets in ServiceNow
If none of the above options work for your Servicedesk they are basically left 
to logging tickets on their own in ServiceNow. But then there is the risk that 
tickets are not logged in at all because of the additional manual labor involved 
in logging.
As so many ITSM champions will testify many teams start out excited about 
adopting the best service management practices and using ServiceNow only 
for that initial enthusiasm to fade away with time and people sticking with 
what they are already used to.
Having emails automatically redirected for them can be critical to ensure sus-
tained commitment to using ServiceNow.
Loggging tickets manually about received emails also introduces human error 
where information and attachments in the received email are lost in transla-
tion and are not included in the ticket opened. Tickets may also be logged 
some time later.
At Al Jazeera most teams have their support email addresses automatically 
redirect emails to ServiceNow (Option 2) while the Servicedesk in Doha logs 
tickets manually (Option 4) or uses the drag and drop option (Option 3).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
61
An increasing number of end users now also log tickets through the portal 
(Chapter 6) but it would be an overstatement to say that many do it.
Replies and duplicates
Now that you get emails in ServiceNow there are three common issues that 
you may experience from the start:
	1.	 Uncropped email chains: Email chains are not cut out and 
so each update includes the whole ticket chain. It soon 
grows unbearable.
	2.	 Email replies to internal notifications are shared with 
your end user possibly causing embarrassment.
	3.	 Somehow, seven new tickets are created for the same 
issue resulting in chaos and confusion.
Reply chains
When receiving an email reply ServiceNow attempts to extract the reply 
part leaving out the email trail. But this may not work with your email client 
especially if dealing with international customers and does not work with legal 
disclaimers often appended to corporate emails.
If not dealt with, your ticket message details become easily unreadable and 
practically threaten the adoption of ServiceNow. It just becomes too ugly to 
deal with the ticket both over email and in the ticket itself.
To deal with this, ServiceNow lets you define what text, if found, will be 
cropped in an incoming email reply. You can add your disclaimer in there as 
well as the reply separators used in the emails that you receive. By default, 
ServiceNow looks for the following text strings:
-----Original Message-----
_____
From:
You may have also noticed that in the emails that you receive from the cus-
tomer service of online websites you will often see that they start with some-
thing like:
## In replies all text above this line is added to the ticket ##

Chapter 4 | Email support
62
They do this so that they can always crop email replies to their tickets regard-
less of the email client or language of the customer. You may be in a situation 
where such a solution suits you as well.
At Al Jazeera we have an automatic email signature (Figure  4-1) and legal 
disclaimer appended to every email sent, and in ServiceNow we crop email 
chains from the signature onwards.
Reply duplicates
As tickets started to pour in automatically in ServiceNow from emails sent 
by unassuming colleagues all over the channel at Al Jazeera we soon observed 
an issue: people were receiving duplicate copies of the same ticket. It seemed 
like every new email reply received spawned a new ticket instead of updating 
the first one.
Upon investigation we realized what the issue was: Reply all. Reply-alls to the 
original email that was sent to ServiceNow triggered new tickets. Here is how 
it can happen for you as well:
	1.	 The service desk email address redirects to ServiceNow 
automatically.
	2.	 Carla emails the service desk and her line manager Imad 
with a support request.
	3.	 ServiceNow automatically opens a ticket for Carla’s email 
and emails her a receipt notice.
Figure 4-1.  Email signature and disclaimer automatically appended to outgoing emails from 
Al Jazeera.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
63
	4.	 Imad replies to Carla’s email and to the service desk 
(reply all).
	5.	 ServiceNow receives Imad’s email. Eventhough the email 
is a reply there is no ticket number mentioned in the 
email and so ServiceNow opens a new ticket for Imad.
	6.	 The issue repeats with each reply to the service desk 
email address but doesn’t have a ticket number in the 
email trail.
So unless the email is a reply to a ServiceNow notification the email will be 
processed in ServiceNow as a new Incident ticket generating many confusing 
duplicate tickets and notifications.
From a system perspective it makes sense. How could ServiceNow tell if the 
new email is a reply to an existing ticket or a new ticket if there is no ticket 
number in it?
To deal with the issue you could go in either of these two directions:
	1.	 Ignore email replies that don’t contain a ticket number. 
This way Imad’s message would be received by Carla but 
wouldn’t reflect in ServiceNow and won’t trigger any 
duplicate email.
	2.	 Attempt to match email subject lines with the short 
description of open tickets.
Ignoring the email reply may not be sensible unless you also include a mecha-
nism for the service desk to review those ignored email replies (there may be 
an approval or instruction for the service desk). You could tie this in with the 
Feedback list mentioned later in this chapter.
You could also send an auto-reply to Imad alerting him that because he replied 
to an email without a ticket number the email was ignored and invite him to 
email again in a new email instead if he wants to communicate with the service 
desk. But that’s just too cumbersome and confusing, isn’t it?
At Al Jazeera we went with the second option so that even email replies that 
don’t contain a ticket number will update the most recent open ticket as long 
as the following conditions match:
	1.	 The ticket has the same short description as the subject 
line of the email reply (after trimming reply prefixes and 
trailining spaces).

Chapter 4 | Email support
64
	2.	 The sender of the email or at least one of the people  
to whom the email is also sent is also in the ticket’s watch 
list. In other words, the email and the ticket have at least 
one person in common.
	3.	 If there is more than one ticket matching the above crite-
ria, update the most recently updated open ticket.
This solution only comes into play after ServiceNow's default workflow gives 
up on processing the incoming email as a ticket update. So it doesn’t impact 
the reply’s processing logic. It does however place itself before the logic for 
creating new incidents.
If you also implement this, carefully test the creation of new incidents from 
email and monitor that no reply ends up matching wrong tickets.
This procedure has been in place at Al Jazeera for years and works as expected. 
It doesn't solve the issue entirely, especially when email groups are involved 
and so a common denominator is not found (second condition). But for most 
cases updating the right ticket instead of creating new tickets works. When it 
fails it creates a new ticket, which would have happened anyway.
To be sure that emails are not incorrectly matched with other tickets that 
have the same subject line (e.g., “I need help”), you could also either:
• 
Record the first short description set for a ticket in a 
hidden field so that even if the service desk changes the 
short description of the ticket, the matching will occur 
against the original subject line the ticket was created 
with. We do this at Al Jazeera.
• 
Make a ticket’s short description unchangeable. As it was 
received so it remains.
Missed replies
When a new ticket is received ServiceNow will trigger a notification about 
the new ticket (see Chapter 5) but until the ticket is assigned to someone any 
further update by the caller will not trigger any notification to anyone. The 
customer updates will be silently posted to the ticket with no one alerted.
This may be ideal in theory, assuming teams regularly check their tickets 
queue and process each ticket in it diligently. In practice however it can lead 
to certain ticket updates being missed for some time and growing customer 
dissatisfaction.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
65
This is even more so in the beginning when teams may have officially been on-
boarded to ServiceNow but in reality they still have not entirely shifted their 
workflows. In such cases it is even more likely that unless new email notifica-
tions are received tickets will remain neglected in ServiceNow.
To avoid this situation at least as teams get accustomed to checking and pro-
cessing tickets in ServiceNow you may establish that every new ticket update 
made by a customer is in turn delivered to someone to take care of.
At Al Jazeera, until the ticket is assigned to an individual new customer updates 
are shared with the entire assignment group of the ticket. This is to prompt 
someone from the team to assign the ticket and reply to the customer.
I've also been told of other ServiceNow customers that instead of delivering 
the customer update to the to the entire group they deliver it to the group's 
manager.
Thank you issue
When our central Servicedesk at Al Jazeera shifted to ServiceNow a funny and 
totally unexpected issue got continuously reported and came to be known as 
the “thank you issue”!
As said above if a customer writes an update to a ticket a notification would 
only be delivered to the assignee.
But in many cases the assigneen would have left for the shift and so the 
only way to know about the update would be an angry call from the cus-
tomer wondering why it is taking so long to process her update normally to 
a marked-resolved ticket.
So the following workflow was introduced:
	1.	 Email replies to resolved tickets are shown as feedback in 
a special home page gauge visible to the service desk.
	2.	 The service desk reviews the latest customer message on 
the ticket and based on it either:
• 
Re-opens the ticket and resets the assignment as 
appropriate in the current shift or
• 
Marks the ticket’s feedback as noted to clear it from 
the list.
This feedback list on the ServiceNow home page (Figure 4-2) made sure our 
service desk was on top of all ticket replies to closed tickets from customer, 
regardless of the team the ticket was assigned to.

Chapter 4 | Email support
66
This allowed the service desk to help ensure appropriate action is taken to all 
customer messages.
As a side note, the reason this became known as the Thank you issue was 
because we had set every reply to a closed ticket to automatically re-open the 
ticket and also re-assign it to the service desk, who in turn would assign the 
ticket after checking the availability and load of support teams on shift.
In the beginning the Servicedesk was the only team fully-vested in ServiceNow 
and so to maintain operational fluency additional oversight was needed from 
service desk over the tickets assigned to other teams.
But this soon led to the issue that came to be known as the Thank you issue. 
So many times customers would reply to the closure notification, re-opening 
the ticket with “Thank you”! It would happen like this:
• 
Service desk writes a message and resolves the ticket.
• 
Caller and others in the watch list receive the notification.
• 
Caller replies to the received message with “Thank you.”
• 
The ticket is automatically re-opened with the received 
message.
• 
In order to close the ticket the service desk has to write 
another message.
• 
Prompted by the caller’s thank you, others in the watch 
list also post their thank you reply, again re-opening the 
ticket!
This funny situation kept on happening so often until we introduced the feed-
back list solution described above.
Figure 4-2.  Feedback list on the service desk home page shows resolved tickets to which 
new comments have been added.

Internal replies
ServiceNow by default processes email replies to ticket notifications and 
posts all of them to the user-visible ticket comments. This in turn triggers the 
appropriate notifications for the agents or the end users (depending on who 
wrote the update).
But this processes also applies to email replies to internal notifications such as 
Assigned to me and Assigned to your group.
To avoid internal recipients from replying to those emails with internal replies 
(like “Why did I get this assigned?”) you could include a warning in the email 
notifications clarifying that replies will be sent to the caller directly (not to the 
person that just made the assignment).
Alternatively you may want to enable an internal communication thread for 
each ticket. As such email replies to assignment emails are posted to the  
ticket’s work notes and are not customer-visible. This is discussed in context 
in Chapter 10.
Filter out spam
Once email processing is enabled in ServiceNow external spammers may find 
out and start sending spam emails to your instance which in turn will auto-
create tickets and trigger email notifications.
You can avoid this by whitelisting emails from friendly domains only as well as 
whitelisting individual private email addresses that are explicitly added to the 
watch list by a member of staff. Here is how it would work:
	1.	 In order to process a ticket, HR or the service desk may 
need to communicate with an external private email 
address (e.g., an @gmail.com address). This may be for 
example when interviewing or on-boarding a new can-
didate employee. The email address could also be that of 
an external collaborator that the network team needs to 
consult on a particular ticket.
	2.	 The external email address is added to the ticket’s watch 
list as an email address. This automatically white lists 
incoming emails from this particular email address.
Your ServiceNow administrator can also whitelist entire domains, for exam-
ple those of your vendors and partners (e.g., @ibm.com) through a dedicated 
property in ServiceNow.

Chapter 4 | Email support
68
Whitelisting at both the individual level and the domain level works fine for Al 
Jazeera’s needs and may also for your organization.
But if you need to receive emails from domains and addresses that cannot be 
specified a priori whatsoever, whitelisting won’t work for you. You can alter-
natively rely on SPAM Scoring2 and check your ServiceNow Junk folder often.
Just like SPAM is filtered out by email servers ServiceNow’s SPAM scoring 
plug-in will analyze incoming emails and assess the likelihood of the email 
being spam based on ServiceNow’s experience.
Based on the SPAM score assigned by ServiceNow to the incoming email you 
can decide whether to ignore the email or let it through as a legitimate email.
ServiceNow lets you set the SPAM score that you are willing to tolerate as 
legitimate; Setting a low score means that you will ignore most emails poten-
tially considered as spam and let in only those that don’t look suspicious. This 
means you potentially may miss legitimate emails that were scored as suspi-
cious. By contrast a high tolerance score for SPAM will let in emails that were 
highly suspected of being spam.
In the next chapter we also review how to ensure that you do not send out 
spam.
Tweet-ready take aways
• 
The quickest way to hook ServiceNow in the everyday 
workflows of your organization is to automatically create 
tickets from emails.
• 
Mailbox redirection can be set by your email adminis-
trator and doesn’t require sharing of passwords nor any 
change in ServiceNow.
• 
Emails from customer service often start with something 
like: ## In replies all text above this line is added to the 
ticket ##
• 
A feedback list on the home page helps make sure the 
service desk is on top of all ticket replies to closed tickets 
from customers.

Why robotic email notifications are not how 
you want your customers to perceive you
This chapter is about the email notifications sent from ServiceNow, which for 
many people at your organization and especially those in management posi-
tions is all they get to see of your ITSM and ServiceNow programs.
ServiceNow comes ready out of box (OOB) to receive and to send email 
notifications but even though the OOB notifications sent from ServiceNow 
are now better than they used to be in earlier versions they are still too terse 
and uninformative. At least the notifications sent to your end users should be 
branded and aesthetically pleasing in order to convey a better image of your 
team.
The OOB notifications basically just push the recipient to go to ServiceNow 
to find out more and act on the notification. Technical people may be sympa-
thetic to such style but other recipients not having the patience to go through 
the ticket’s web interface may find it an annoying delay to progress on tickets 
and seek support through other means (e.g., an escalation). They are your 
customers and they know it.

If your ServiceNow instance is accessible only behind a VPN (as it is at 
Al Jazeera for example) it will be even more difficult for users to log into 
ServiceNow from their mobile device. It becomes imperative that your notifi-
cations contain sufficient guidance on what is needed from the recipients and 
that they can provide it without leaving thier inbox.
Taking customer-facing notifications seriously at Al Jazeera, before we went 
live with ServiceNow in Doha each notification was reviewed by our Chief 
Technology Officer. This chapter helps you do the same, offering correspond-
ing examples from Al Jazeera and others so that you can customize to your 
liking the number and content of the notifications sent from your instance to 
your users.
In this chapter I also warn against spam emails. It has happened with us at Al 
Jazeera and it made a headline when it also happened at the UK’s National 
Health Service (NHS) spamming 840,000 employees at once.1
In this chapter:
• 
Customer-facing notifications: How many there are per 
ticket and how they look;
• 
Internal notifications;
Spam: It can happen that the system will spam customers  
and the organization en masse. Understand how and 
prevent this blunder from happening.
Robotic content
Even though people tend not to admit it or downplay it consumer behavior 
studies and even brain scans have confirmed that the packaging of a product 
influences our perception of the product itself.
Coke drunk from a red can tastes sweeter than the same formula Coke in 
a white-colored can, and a strawberry mousse tastes sweeter if served in a 
white container than if served from a black one.2
If you think about it it for a moment this is a remarkable finding with pro-
found implications. As technologists we tend to shun the role of aesthetics 
in our systems as an afterthought. That’s a pity because as Steve Jobs under-
stood “some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig 
deeper, it’s really how it works!”

What this means for digital products and services is that the aesthetic look 
of digital screens that you present yourself with to your customers influ-
ences their perception of your services. The more elegant and professional 
the emails you send, the better the image of your support organization will be 
in the minds of your colleagues.
President Barack Obama has been cited for using this understanding to great 
profit in his 2012 re-election campaign.3 The campaign which raised $690 mil-
lion dollars online mostly from fundraising emails employed a team of 20 writ-
ers and a sophisticated analytics system to measure and improve those emails.
I’m not asking that you go that far for your ServiceNow emails but consider 
these guidelines:
• 
Use copy that is customer-centric and in simple language, 
leaving out IT and ITIL jargon.
• 
Use subject lines that are descriptive and consistent.
• 
Clarify why the recipient is receiving the email notifica-
tion and what action is required from her.
• 
Enable recipients to act upon emails directly via email and 
on the go without having to leave their email inbox.
• 
Brand customer-facing email notifications to portray a 
professional and caring image of your support team.
The wording and layout of ServiceNow’s default notifications sent to cus-
tomers is somewhat robotic (see Figure 5-3) while nowadays end users are 
getting accustomed to much more natural and customer-centric language in 
notifications and error messages, as can be seen in Figures 5-1 and 5-2.

talk-to-you-about-this-brilliant-obama-email-scheme/265725/
Figure 5-1. Auto-responder emails do not have to read robotic. They can tell the recipient 
that you are “on top of it.”

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
72
Note the subject line in Figure 5-3, “Incident INC0010006 has been opened 
on your behalf”. “And when a member of staff updates the ticket the subject 
line will read, “Your Incident INC0010006 has comments added.”
Note how odd such email subjects look in the inbox when compared to normal 
email conversations people engage in. Do they need to be this way?
At the Obama campaign they found that “the subject lines that worked best 
were things you might see in your in-box from other people.”
Just because you now have an ITSM ticketing system your service desk subject 
lines don’t suddenly have to turn robotic.

Customer-facing notifications
Here is a review of the email notification templates sent by ServiceNow to 
the caller of an incident until it’s resolved and after:
	1.	 Incident opened notification: Sent to the caller as a receipt 
as soon as the Incident is logged.
	2.	 Incident commented: Sent when your support agent 
leaves a new update on the Incident ticket.
	3.	 Incident requires action: Sent when your support agent 
marks the Incident as requiring customer action.
	4.	 Incident resolved: Sent when the Incident is marked as 
resolved.
	5.	 Incident closed: Another notification sent 24 hours after 
the Incident is resolved.
All of those notifications to the customer are too many and reflect too much 
the internal life cycle of an Incident.
1. Incident opened receipt
The “incident opened for me” notification as it’s called in ServiceNow is an 
automatic reply sent to the caller of an incident as soon as the incident is 
received (Figure 5-4).
It is like a receipt providing the caller with evidence of her contact, set-
ting expectations and providing details for further reference to the issue 
(Figure 5-5).
Figure 5-4.  Out-of-box incident opened notification

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
74
The branded notification above features:
• 
A personal greeting to the recipient;
• 
Commitment from the Technology service desk to solve 
the issue, and to the best possible standard;
• 
Clarification as to how the customer can update the 
ticket, that nothing yet is currently expected from her, 
and that she will be receiving updates.
As for the subject line the default one in ServiceNow reads:
Incident INC0000011 – opened on your behalf
Looking through your inbox it’s difficult to tell what this INC000011 was 
about. The subject line could be more descriptive and natural than this. For 
example at Al Jazeera it’s like this:
OPENED: VPN is not working – INC0000011
Figure 5-5.  Incident opened notification at Al Jazeera.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
75
“VPN is not working” is the short description of the Incident. Instead of 
OPENED you could also say “RECEIVED” for example. Or you could make 
it really natural and conversational and have this subject line for all ticket 
notifications:
RE: VPN is not working
2. Incident comments updated
When there is a reply on the ticket a new notification is sent to the caller with 
the update. Figure 5-6 is how the incident commented notification looks out 
of the box while Figure 5-7 shows how it has been customized at Al Jazeera.

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
76
Figure 5-7.  Incident updated notification is triggered when a message is added to the 
support conversation with the caller.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
77
For the subject line this is the default subject line:
Your Incident INC0000011 – has comments added
Much more descriptive and natural would be either of:
UPDATED: VPN is not working – INC0000011
RE: VPN is not working
3. Action required
As noted earlier ServiceNow default subject lines do little in attracting the 
recipient’s attention.
When the service desk cannot proceed with the resolution of a ticket because 
it requires further input from the caller, their approval to a suggested solution, 
or their availability in person the service desk can change the state of a ticket 
to On hold, awaiting caller.
To make this clear to the caller it is better to use a subject line that indicates 
the need for action as also done by Amazon.com (see Figure 5-8) for example.
Inside the Action Required email, clarify that you are waiting for further input 
from the customer before you can proceed with the ticket (see Figure 5-9).
Figure 5-8. The subject lines of emails that require customer intervention commonly 
include “Action Required”.

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
78
Just like it is mandatory to leave a comment to the caller when resolving an 
Incident it should be the case also when putting a ticket on hold so that callers 
know what is requested of them exactly.
4. Incident resolved
The incident resolved notification (see Figures 5-10, 5-11 and 5-12) is sent to 
the caller once the incident is resolved. It is also an opportunity to:
• 
Show commitment to full satisfaction of the caller;
• 
Provide guidance on how to re-open the case or provide 
feedback.
Figure 5-9. Action Required email clearly informs the caller that you are no longer working 
on the ticket, waiting for feedback.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
79
Figure 5-10.  Incident resolved notification sent at Al Jazeera.
Figure 5-11. To resolve an Incident one must first type a comment.

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
80
In the Al Jazeera notification of Figure 5-11 you will notice that the notifica-
tion doesn’t distinguish between resolved and closed. This is because we only 
send one email notification once the email is resolved and have disabled the 
incident closed notifications sent automatically 24 hours after the Incident is 
resolved.
The customer does not need to be bothered about the ITIL difference 
between a resolved and a closed incident. This state transition does not need 
to trigger an email notification to anyone since no action is required.
In fact you could even disable the incident resolved notification to make the 
experience with the ticket more like a natural conversation that dies off with 
both parties going quiet as opposed to one explicitly announcing the termi-
nation and giving an ultimatum to respond before the ticket is “permanently 
closed”!
In each Incident updated notification sent you can still clearly indicate the sta-
tus of the ticket (work in progress or resolved).
5. Incident closed
By default 24 hours after an incident has been resolved ServiceNow would 
send the caller another email notification (see Figure 5-13) telling her that the 
Incident is now closed (see Figure 5-14). First it was resolved, now it is closed.

Subject lines
Those were all the customer-facing notifications sent by ServiceNow. Before 
moving on to internal notifications Table 5-1 lists all the customer-facing noti-
fications and proposed subject lines for each.
Figure 5-13.  Incident closed notification sent automatically 24 hours after the Incident 
resolved notification.
Figure 5-14. The first notification is about the incident resolved; the second is sent 
automatically after 24 hours of inactivity to notify that the incident is now also closed. Does 
the customer care to receive this many notifications?

Duplicates
On several occasions ServiceNow could send duplicate or unnecessary emails 
to your customers.
For example when a ticket is resolved your customer could potentially receive 
two separate notifications at the same time (Figure 5-15). One would be noti-
fying her and others in the watch list that a comment has been added to the 
ticket and another that the ticket has been resolved.
A simple and bullet-proof solution in this case would be to disable the incident 
resolved notification altogether so that the incident updated notification is all 
that gets sent.
More sophisticated solutions also exist. Because modifying the notifications 
workflow can be messy and lead either to undesired notifications being sent 
to customers or possibly important notifications never being sent, it is impor-
tant that you test such changes thoroughly as discussed in Chapter 8.
Reply all
Duplicate notifications may also be generated when recipients reply all and 
there are multiple people watching the ticket (a very common scenario, as 
discussed in Chapter 10).
To avoid this reply all duplication ServiceNow can hide recipients in the BCC 
and list who else is subscribed to receive updates to the ticket with a line in 
the body of the notification. It could read like this:
John, Bob, Alice, and IT Dept. are subscribed to receive updates to 
INCXXX.
Figure 5-15.  If another person is listed to a watch list then when the Incident is resolved 
the caller may receive two duplicate notifications with the same message.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
83
At Al Jazeera we do not want customers to directly email the agent working 
on the ticket from the IT side as that would defeat the purpose of the system. 
But we do not have an issue showing their names in the ticket to make the 
conversation with the customer more personal.
We are in fact also considering showing a photo of the assigned-to person 
in the notification and encouraging the caller to provide feedback about the 
support she received from him. We believe this personalization of support 
will make the caller more sympathetic and less critical of the person providing 
support. Research from Twitter bears this out, and for this they rolled out a 
feature to shows the name and face of customer-care agents helping custom-
ers on Twitter.4
Internal notifications
In addition to the customer-facing email notification listed above, ServiceNow 
will also send internal notifications to your support team in the following four 
scenarios:
• 
Incident opened and unassigned: Sent as soon as a new 
ticket is received and it is not already assigned to anyone;
Yet this notification is by default not sent to anybody unless they individually 
subscribe to receive it.
• 
Incident assigned to my group: Sent to the email address 
of the team that the ticket has been assigned to;
• 
Incident assigned to me: Sent to the person to whom the 
incident has been assigned;
• 
Incident commented: Sent to the person the ticket has 
been assigned to as soon as the caller updates the ticket 
with a message. If other people have been subscribed 
to receive ticket updates they also will receive this 
notification.
Unlike with caller notifications those four internal notifications are not too 
many and are all actionable by the recipient (see Table 5-2). I herewith only 
recommend modifications to the content of the notifications and especially to 
the Incident commented notification as it would also end up being received by 
people on your customer’s side.

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
84
At the subject line level, here are the default subject lines for each notification. 
Adapt them as you see fit for your team.
Also note that ServiceNow does not provide notifications for internal con-
versations about the ticket (see Chapter 10 for details).
1. New unassigned incident
Incidents in ServiceNow may be logged without setting an assignment group 
and such is the case for incidents sent over email. So who should be notified 
of new and unassigned Incidents?
There is an Opened and unassigned notification that alerts about new incidents 
received but by default it is not configured to be delivered to anyone. So you 
have four options with respect to this notification:
	1.	 Subscribe some users to receive this notification and then 
assign the ticket to your service desk or another team. 
This option doesn’t require any configuration; Users can 
subscribe to the notification from their profile page.
	2.	 Modify the notification so that it’s always sent to your 
service desk group as well as other subscribers.
	3.	 Set tickets to be automatically assigned to the service 
desk, so that this notification would never be needed (or 
triggered).
	4.	 Do nothing, assuming that service desk members will 
always be monitoring their ServiceNow home page for 
new tickets during hours of operation.

As for the contents of the notification, the default is not too bad and since 
it is an internal notification you may not need to customize it (Figure 5-16).
2. Incident assigned to group
Once a ticket is re-assigned from one group to another, from the service desk 
to the network team for example, the team will receive a notification with the 
same contents as the unassigned email notification above (figure 6-18).
Identify which fields you deem important to list in the email and modify the 
email template accordingly. At Al Jazeera we list the following:
Location: Portacabin 2 - Doha
Priority: P2 - High (10h), SLA due by 13-Jun-16 13:17
Opened by: at 12-Jun-16 13:17

State: Open
Figure 5-16.  Contents of an internal notification sent about a new Incident ticket

Chapter 5 | Elegant Notifications
86
3. Incident assigned to person
This notification serves the same purpose as the Assigned to my group notifica-
tion but is sent to the person to whom the ticket has been assigned.
4. Incident updated
This notification is very important because it will carry the email replies from 
the caller to the ticket.
It’s sent to the assignee but also to other people subscribed to receive updates 
on the ticket. Those would normally be people from the caller-side such as 
the line manager or the entire group interested in the resolution of the ticket.
For such end user audiences the default template may be inappropriate (see 
Figure 5-17).
A simple solution to this problem is to use the exact same content template 
and subject line used in the notification that is sent to the caller. This should 
avoid confusion on any side by keeping things the same on both ends of the 
conversation.

watch list subscribers, if any

Spinning Up ServiceNow
87
Another issue with this notification is that it’s sent to multiple people. The 
problem with this is that when people hit reply all to respond to the notifica-
tion the recipients will receive two email notifications.
Spam notifications
ServiceNow could potentially spam your entire organization at once!
This depends on your organization’s email setup but basically could happen 
any time ServiceNow sends an automated notification.
For example if ServiceNow receives a notification from an all-staff group 
email, the auto-reply Incident opened notification could be automatically deliv-
ered to all staff.
It could also be triggered accidentally (or intentionally) from ServiceNow  
by someone adding group emails to the watch list of the ticket and triggering 
an update.
This is not a theoretical scenario; it happens in practice. The National Health 
Service (NHS) in the UK once sent the estimated total of 200 million unnec-
essary emails to 840,000 employees within four hours.5
Screenshots posted by the BBC of the email sent show that troublesome 
emails were sent from a service desk address.6 On the issue Dr. Andrew 
Hartle from St Mary’s Hospital in London commented on this by saying: “We 
should ban ’reply to all’—it’s the bane of everyone’s life.”
Through a slightly different setup this once happened at Al Jazeera also and 
one night four incident notifications were sent to all of Al Jazeera’s staff!
A notification from HR had been sent to a dynamic group that automatically 
included all emails at Al Jazeera. So ServiceNow also received the notification, 
promptly created an Incident ticket, and sent back the Incident opened notifi-
cation to HR and the dynamic group with all staff. This, in turn led to a circle 
that generated three more ticket updated notifications.
What a disaster it was! Damage done we pulled back those emails from peo-
ple’s mailboxes and revisited our email configuration to prevent this from 
happening again. Don’t wait it for it to happen to you too; ask your email and 
ServiceNow administrators from the outset about the measures in place to 
prevent mass spam from being sent in any case.

In most Microsft Exchange environments, administrators have it set up that 
only a few email addresses at the organization could email certain user groups 
and there is a limit on the total number of emails within the organization that 
could be emailed at once. You should verify this to be the case at your orga-
nization and confirm it will work with the email address your ServiceNow 
instance uses to send out emails. If this is not possible at your organization, 
you may implement a similar mechanism within ServiceNow.
Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
We tend to shun aesthetics in our systems as an after-
thought but in the mind of the user looks and function 
are intrinsically intertwined.
• 
The 2012 Obama campaign found “the subject lines that 
worked best were things you might see in your in-box 
from other people.”
• 
Just because you now have an ITSM ticketing system your 
service desk subject lines don’t suddenly have to turn 
robotic.
• 
Emails with generic subject lines are easily passed over. 
It’s better to indicate in the subject line that “Action is 
Required.”
• 
We should ban “reply to all”—it’s the bane of everyone’s 
life.

Put simply, to an end user, IT either fixes stuff that is broken (Incident man-
agement) or provides new stuff (Request fulfillment). Which one does your 
department do more?
Request fulfillment is undoubtedly integral to the everyday work of any IT 
department. Every day there will be requests for new equipment from head-
sets to new workstations, requests for software installations or other services, 
such as new email groups, FTP folders, or yet other services that also require 
coordination with HR and facilities departments such as the off-boarding of  
terminated employees.
Other departments also handle user requests of their own such as applica-
tions for medical insurance, visitor passes, or cameramen deployments. The 
day-to-day work of many employees in an organization can be seen through 
the lenses of receiving requests from internal or external customers, and going 
through the motions of fulfilling them. Hence, the new buzzword Enterprise 
Service Management.

At the CERN particle physics lab in Switzerland, scientists, staff, and visitors 
can go to an online portal from which they can request IT services or rent a 
bicycle on-site.
Being systematic with your requests fulfillment process allows you to stream-
line and automate the flow of information and responsibility for the tasks 
involved in fulfilling a request in a consistent and trackable sequence, akin to 
a digital assembly line.
Unlike logging incidents however, Request fulfillment does not work by just 
redirecting emails from end users in ServiceNow and voila requests are cre-
ated automatically in ServiceNow. For every request, there is a form to be 
filled, and approval and fulfillment workflows to be defined up-front.
In this chapter:
	1.	 Request components: Overview of what it takes to fulfill a 
request in ServiceNow from both the perspective of the 
requester and of the fulfiller’s teams
	2.	 World-class examples: Examples of front-end portals and 
the process that went into their making
	3.	 Handling approvals: What could go wrong and how to 
avoid management blunders
	4.	 Simplified collaboration: How to eliminate opportunities 
for duplication and confusion inherent in ServiceNow’s 
modular request architecture
Planning the portal
When planning your Request fulfillment portal it is easy to get caught up in 
discussions about first mapping all your business services, integrating with 
Assets management and Procurement, etc.
But unless you already have those processes in place and in a system trying to 
do all those things in tandem with your request portal project in ServiceNow 
could spell disaster, or unnecessarily postpone your go-live.
At Al Jazeera we went live with Incident management and worked to go live 
with Request fulfillment within weeks afterwards, considering it to be the true 
glory. But it did not work that way and seeing how big a challenge it actually 
was to stabilize Incident management in ServiceNow it was decided to focus 
on on-boarding all critical teams in the department first and making sure they 
were accustomed to managing incidents in ServiceNow with the service desk 

Spinning Up ServiceNow
91
as the Single Point of Contact (SPOC) for all IT requests, including ERP’s. Then 
only came Request fulfillment, more than a year later.
Lesson learned, when we finally launched the portal at Al Jazeera we resisted 
the temptation to integrate it with Assets management. In fact as of 2017, the 
two are still not fully integrated even though both processes are managed in 
ServiceNow.
Other ServiceNow customers also shared similar experiences. At the 
University in California for example, IT had launched ServiceNow with 
Request fulfillment, Knowledge, and Incident management all at once but then 
within weeks they had to disable service requests in ServiceNow, citing spam 
and customer dissatisfaction, abandoned Knowledge, and focused on just 
using plain simple Incident tickets both to record incidents and requests2 (as 
we also did at Al Jazeera).
Also at CERN “It was decided to simplify the Request fulfillment process in 
order to achieve easier acceptance by the CERN user community.” 3
If those stories offer any insight as you approach your Request fulfillment 
project, remember that you are not in a marathon to implement ITIL basic 
processes and that a period of adjustment, customization, and improvement 
will normally follow the launch. Once things stabilize, build on.
User journey
In order to understand all the key elements of Request fulfillment in 
ServiceNow here are the steps of a typical request in ServiceNow. After this 
overview each element will be discussed separately.
	1.	 Requester goes to the request portal through which she 
can request stuff.
	2.	 She navigates to the form for the item or service that 
she wants, fills it and submits her request. She could also 
add the item to the shopping cart, request more items, 
and finally check out.
	3.	 A Request record is created in ServiceNow for her 
request and goes through the Request workflow.
	4.	 The request workflow will automatically trigger an 
Approval request to the line manager of the requester 
if her request crosses a certain price threshold.

3Z. Toteva et al., “Service management at CERN with Service-Now,”

Chapter 6 | Request portal
92
	5.	 Once the manager approves the Request, the Requested 
item workflow will be triggered for the Requested 
item (RITM). If more than one item was requested, a 
workflow for each requested item will be triggered at the 
same time.
	6.	 If the RITM requires special approval, an Approval 
request will be triggered for it.
	7.	 Once in the fulfillment phase of the order, the RITM 
workflow will create one or more Catalog tasks to 
procure and deliver the Requested item to the requester.
	8.	 Once all Requested items have been delivered, the 
Request is closed.
As shown above, to request and fulfill a request, your customers, management, 
and your resolver teams will be subjected to multiple ServiceNow interfaces 
and records. To control all this, there is one workflow that defines the flow of 
all Requests (REQ) as well as workflows that define the approval and fulfill-
ment process for each Requested item (RITM).
Each completed Request (REQ) in ServiceNow will have left behind all of the 
following records:
• 
Request record (REQ)
• 
Requested items records (RITMs)
• 
Approval requests for REQ and for RITMs
• 
Catalog tasks
Since things are already complex it is important that you strive to simplify 
things at each step as discussed below.
Front-end examples
The Request catalog is the portal to which you point your end users to make 
their requests. It is where they choose the item they want, fill the form for it, 
and submit their request.
It needs to be easy to navigate so that users can successfully identify the 
service they need, fill the respective form, and submit the request. Otherwise 
even if they intended to follow your process and submit their request via the 
portal, they may not be able to do it.
When reaching out to the service desk it is not always clear to the requester 
if they are reporting an issue about something that should have been but is 
not, or if they are requesting something new. For example, an employee may 

Spinning Up ServiceNow
93
need to make international phone calls but when she finds out that she cannot 
do them from her phone extension, she may report it as an issue. However, 
from a service desk perspective, this may be considered a request and will 
require management approval (and cost center accounting). For this, as shown 
in the examples below, front-end portals often blend the ability to request 
new services with the ability to report new issues.
There is a lot of variety in structure, layout, and content of Request portals 
from organization to organization or even from one business unit to another. 
Within the Volkswagen group, Audi’s portal is different from that of Porsche’s, 
yet different from that of other brands in the group.
Depending on the size of your organization and your users’ expectations, 
your Requests portal may be considered the face of IT (or the entire organiza-
tion), and it may thus need to be customized, or be embedded into an existing 
intranet portal that your users already access. If that is the case, you can build 
your Request fulfillment portal directly in your existing intranet portal and 
just send the requests to ServiceNow for processing.
Al Jazeera’s portal
At Al Jazeera, the service desk portal (see Figures 6-1 and 6-2) is accessible 
from the corporate intranet for staff members to preview the available ser-
vices and request them by filling out the dedicated forms. The portal also 
provides one-click access for reporting issues.
Figure 6-1.  Request portal at Al Jazeera is available in English and Arabic.

CERN Service Portal
The CERN Service Portal (Figure 6-3) offers access to all services offered 
by the research organization, lists the contact details of the service desk,  
and offers a search box as the primary interface. After all, CERN is all about 
finding answers to the secrets of the universe!
Some forms on the portal are Record producers, that is, based on a set of 
questions in the form, either an Incident or a Request will be logged.

Harvard University IT services
The IT services portal at Harvard University (Figure 6-4) combines access to 
information about the offered services together with links to requesting those 
services.
UC Davis portal
Like the portal at Harvard, the UC Davis portal (Figure 6-5) integrates the 
knowledge base with the requests catalog. First and foremost, it is a one-stop 
front-end to all IT services offered, even though many of the listed Services 
do not lead to a fillable ServiceNow form, but instead to a page that pro-
vides information about the service and instructions on how to request it (for 
example emailing software@ucdavis.edu). Other links on the portal can take 
you directly to external service providers such as Office365.

Volkswagen iServe
At the Volkswagen Group, each car brand has its own portal (see examples 
in Figures 6-6 and 6-7). Like at Al Jazeera emphasis is on quick access to the 
request forms of the desired service or item.

97
For internal workflows that involve a limited number of users or approvers, 
or where requesters themselves have work to handle in ServiceNow you may 
not need a glossy request portal and could more simply go with the built-in 
service catalog interface (see Figure 6-8). This will be the quickest to build, 
expand, and maintain.
Integration options
You may as well consider using your own organization’s front-end portal solu-
tion and just integrate it with ServiceNow’s back end.
The portal could be built using ServiceNow’s CMS or Service Portal solutions, 
but note that unlike the option to build the catalog in ServiceNow directly, 
building a front end entails additional work distinct from that on the Catalog 
back end in ServiceNow. So you may as well consider using your own organi-
zation’s front-end portal solution, such as SharePoint or Drupal and integrate 
it with ServiceNow’s back end as some of the examples above have done.

Figure 6-8.  Default Service catalog accessible from within ServiceNow

Chapter 6 | Request portal
98
This has the advantage that the front-end portal will be built and maintained 
by a team already dedicated to building front-end portals at your organiza-
tion, while your ServiceNow developers can focus on the Catalog back end 
in ServiceNow, building workflows. If you go down this route consider these 
integration options:
	1.	 Build and manage the forms in ServiceNow and have 
them embedded (with “iframes”) in the external front-
end portal page.
This is an agile and hybrid solution that lets your 
ServiceNow developers control and update forms from 
ServiceNow without the responsibility for building the 
entire front-end portal. The downside is that forms may 
not be responsive from mobile phones.
	2.	 Build all forms in the external portal (e.g., SharePoint) 
and have it send the submitted requests to ServiceNow 
either via Web Services or email.
Handling approvals
Even though managers in other departments tend to be concessive with grant-
ing approvals (so long as there is no chargeback), approvals also serve as explicit 
acknowledgements of responsibility for the risks that may be associated with 
the request (e.g., granting access to a system or the stealth of an asset).
If your approval logic is straightforward and the lines of reporting available in 
ServiceNow are accurate, then you could rely on ServiceNow to automati-
cally determine who the right approver is for each request and collect the 
approval automatically.
However if you are in a situation where determining who should approve 
a particular request is somewhat complicated because, for example, actual 
reporting lines may differ from those declared in the HR systems, or because 
too many factors would need to be considered (e.g., approval required depends 
also on the seniority of the requester) then automating the approval logic in 
ServiceNow may not work for you. Consider this flexible approach instead:
	1.	 The request form explains the type of approval required 
(e.g., Department manager) and asks the requester to 
name her approver (see Figure 6-9).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
99
	2.	 An approval request is automatically sent to the sug-
gested approver.
	3.	 The service desk verifies if the named approver is the 
right one and if not informs the requester.
	4.	 The request is approved once the service desk veri-
fies that the correct approver has been named, and the 
approval is obtained.
This approach is efficient in that approval requests are sent automatically as 
soon as the request is submitted, on the fair expectation that the requester 
knows who her boss is (department manager, bureau manager or whichever 
approval level is requested).
As such, you eliminate the chance for delays caused by ServiceNow incor-
rectly sending the approval request to the wrong person (e.g., a manager on 
leave and no delegate set in ServiceNow).
The need for the service desk to review the suggested approver may be pro-
tested as a bottleneck. But note how neither the service desk needs to wait 
for the suggested approver to respond, nor does the approver need to wait 
for the service desk verification to approve. The two can happen simultane-
ously (see Figure 6-10).
Figure 6-9.  Field in a catalog form requesting the approver to specify who her Head of 
section is

Chapter 6 | Request portal

Duplicate approvals
ServiceNow may collect multiple approvals possibly from the same manager 
for the same request:
	1.	 If the request crosses a certain expense threshold, then 
an approval request can be sent to obtain approval for 
the budget expenditure (Figure 6-11).
Figure 6-11. Approval Requests in ServiceNow can be comfortably approved or rejected 
directly by email
Figure 6-10.  Flexible approval workflow if you do not have perfect information in 
ServiceNow

Spinning Up ServiceNow
101
	2.	 If the Requested item (RITM), for example access to a 
particular system or shared folder requires approval from 
the line manager of the requester, or the system owner, 
then another approval request will be triggered for the 
Requested item.
To avoid the annoying and inefficient duplication of approval requests, you may 
customize ServiceNow to skip the second approval if it is going to be sent to 
the same person that just approved the request. But then you lose the flex-
ibility of approving single RITMs and rejecting others; it's a trade-off.
Bypass or modify approval
Especially when you first pilot and introduce your portal, your service desk 
may have to fill in request forms on behalf of requesters on the phone, or 
when the request is received by the service desk already with the necessary 
approvals.
On such occasions, even if your service desk logs the request on behalf of the 
requester, ServiceNow would, by default, trigger and wait on the approver to 
approve the request. To avoid this, you can provide the service desk with the 
option to bypass approval and move straight into fulfillment.
This could be done with a checkbox on forms that is visible only to service 
desk analysts which, once checked, would bypass approval and move straight-
away to fulfillment. Alternatively, they could set the Requested by and the 
Approver fields to be the same so that no approval request is sent.
Detailed approval requests
In the email notification that is sent to the requester upon logging a request 
it would be useful to include a copy of the form(s) that were filled in. It makes 
the email much more valuable for reference, in case of disputes or issues, and 
for sharing.
The same goes for approval requests; laying out the entire request directly in 
the email sent to the approver will make it easier to approve and review the 
request (see figure 6-12).

Chapter 6 | Request portal
102
Collaborating on requests
As outlined above, for each request there will be a Request record as well as 
at least one Requested item record. Then there will also be Catalog tasks for 
the fulfillment and delivery of the requests.
Each of those ticket types can be assigned and has comments, work notes, and 
email notifications. When an analyst on the fulfillment side wants to update 
the requester, on which comments fields should she type? How can she put 
the request on hold?
In the cited examples where IT had to backtrack on its request portal, one 
key issue that upset customers with requests was the level of “spam” they 
received from ServiceNow.
To avoid confusion and duplication, I recommend simplifying and consolidating 
the channels of communication for requests as follows:
	1.	 Use Catalog tasks to assign work on Requests.
Request and Requested item records are not actionable 
records; they may be pending approval or may have work 
in progress as tracked in a Catalog Task generated by the 
workflow. The assignable unit of work for a request is the 
Catalog task.
It will be confusing if Requests are assigned; assign only 
Catalog tasks. If there is a need to assign new work about 
a Request, a new Catalog task under the Request can be 
created and assigned.
Figure 6-12.  Filled form is sent in the approval request email

Spinning Up ServiceNow
103
	2.	 Unify on only one user-communication channel 
per request.
Potentially, each Request, Requested item, Approval 
request, and even Catalog task can have its own com-
munication thread and watch list members, and so mes-
sages and replies could easily be fragmented across all 
those tickets. A simpler solution is to maintain that all 
user communication with the requester gets posted to 
the Request’s comments thread and only the Request 
record (REQ) generates the email notifications that are 
sent to the requester.
Anything that gets posted as a reply to an Approval 
request or to a Requested item should be posted as a 
Request comment (see Figure 6-13).
	3.	 Show requesters only one number for their 
Request
Have all customer-facing notifications sent about a request 
carry the REQ number, not the RITM. The notification 
may be triggered based on activity in the Requested item 
(RITM) workflow, but you only show the end user the 
Request number.
	4.	 Task to attend unexpected requester comments
Finally, consider what happens if the requester writes a 
comment on the Request while it is pending approval, and 
there is no Catalog task open for it yet.

Figure 6-13. All communication with the user is consolidated in the Request ticket

Chapter 6 | Request portal
104
Because the Request is not assigned to anyone the update 
will go unnoticed. In such a scenario you could:
1.	 Assign the request to the service desk to handle 
the requester comments. The problem is that once 
the service desk replies what should it do with the 
Request ticket in its queue?
2.	 Open a Catalog task for the service desk to review 
and handle the requester’s inquiry. If new inquiries 
come in for the same request, re-open the same Task.
	5.	 Replies to closed requests
Once a Request is complete email replies to it can be 
handled the same way as email replies to closed incidents, 
showing up in the Feedback list for the service desk (see 
Chapter 4).
Unlike for incidents however, a Request should not be re-
opened. If it is determined that further support is needed, 
or that the support provided was incomplete, either a 
new request should be submitted or a new incident.
Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
Since Request fulfillment is already complex as it is, strive 
to simplify things at each step of the process.
• 
You don't have to build both the front end and the back 
end of your portal in ServiceNow; you can integrate with 
your intranet portal.
• 
Even if your approval logic cannot be automated in 
ServiceNow, you can have a flexible and semi-automatic 
approval process in ServiceNow.
• 
Keep it simple and unify on only one user-communication 
channel per request.
• 
Expect to receive unexpected messages!

How to make the most of your ServiceNow 
data without being cheated
The best way to change long-term behavior is with short-term feedback.
—Seth Godin1
If you are migrating to ServiceNow from another ITSM tool your transition 
plan may include the re-creation in ServiceNow of the most useful reports 
that you relied on in the previous tool to measure performance and 
prioritize resources.
In this chapter I advocate that you seize this opportunity to liberate reports 
from being a management thing only and ensure that individual contributors 
and team leads can make the most out of the data captured in ServiceNow in 
their daily operations.
At the management level, this is also an opportunity to open up and standard-
ize the reports used, ensuring consistent calculation methods are used and 
best practices are shared.
What is particularly exciting about reporting from actual data is that it will 
often uncover the all too wide gap between what people say they do, need, or 
prefer and what their actual behavior indicates.

Chapter 7 | Reporting
106
In previous chapters I talked about the unfortunate fate of many ITSM tools 
and improvement initiatives that end up with eventual abandonment. You can 
track in ServiceNow the breadth and depth of users’ adoption and use this 
insight to take action before it’s too late.
The same metrics can also be used repeatedly each time you introduce a new 
process (and ticket type in ServiceNow) to report on process compliance in 
the early stages of adoption and gear action accordingly.
Reports cannot be trusted blindly however; data can be skewed to show man-
agement what they want without delivering a real improvement. You will see 
examples of how misleading data can be and discuss what you can do about it.
In this chapter:
	1.	 Actionable threshold monitors: Reports are not only for 
management; with live performance indicators on the 
home page of your team they can take action at the right 
time before the data becomes a negative statistic on man-
agement dashboards.
	2.	 ITSM ‘Guinness’ records: Individual contributors may be 
less interested in overall trends but they generally can be 
motivated to catch up and top their proximal peers in 
setting the record for best of their peers.
	3.	 User adoption trends: Understand how wide your users’ 
adoption of ServiceNow really is and how deep.
	4.	 True customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction sur-
veys are bogus; you can however know more about pro-
cess effectiveness from the data.
Actionable threshold monitors
Knowing how many SLAs your team breached last week is good but letting 
your team know how many SLAs are about to breach in the next two hours 
and acting upon that is even better.
People in live operations normally tend to have a low interest in reporting and 
often consider it the domain of management. But in reality they, not manage-
ment, are the ones in front of customers and they have a direct opportunity 
for driving positive results, given appropriate motivation and direction. Putting 
this into practice in ServiceNow you can:
	1.	 Create a filtered report that focuses on a particular 
threshold that you target (e.g., number of SLAs breaching 
within two hours);

Spinning Up ServiceNow
107
	2.	 Synthesize the report into a compact widget and pin it on 
the ServiceNow home page of your team;
	3.	 Keep an eye on the live widget and based on the reading 
on the widget prioritize their next action. You can also put 
this on a headsup display on the wall with auto-refresh so 
more people can see them.
This way, rather than just pick their next action from a queue of undifferenti-
ated tickets, or from the colleague who keeps stopping by the desk asking for 
favors they can take appropriate action based on the reading in the widget. 
The Speedometer below for example is an out-of-box report that indicates 
how many open P1 tickets there are currently. Clicking on the number in the 
report will list those P1 tickets for drilling down into actionable details. The 
widget could be on the service desk home page so that analysts can actively 
follow up with all teams that have P1 open tickets and possibly chip in to keep 
the customer informed while resolvers are intently focused on fixing the issue 
(see Figures 7-1 and 7-2).
Figure 7-1.  Out-of-box speedometer showing number of open P1 tickets
Figure 7-2.  List of filtered tickets shown once you click on the speedometer shown in 
Figure 7-1

Chapter 7 | Reporting
108
Other teams also would benefit from filtered reports on their home page but 
filtered to show only their team’s tickets. For example Figure 7-3 shows how 
many open tickets the team has assigned that have breached SLA, or breaching 
within the next 10 hours. Grouped by assignee it should compel the individual 
contributor to clear his queue quickly.
Alternatively the dial in Figure 7-4 provides a much simpler indication of open 
tickets with SLAs breached or about to breach.
Threshold reports are not limited to P1 fires and SLAs. You can create live 
reports also to keep an eye on other absolute or relative thresholds that you 
do not want to exceed:
• 
Aging tickets: Before you get an escalation about a ticket 
that fell through the cracks and remained neglected for a 
while, you can create a sensor for open tickets that have

not been updated in more than a month (or week), and 
when you see one take action.
• 
Contracts expiring soon (see Figure 7-5): If you manage 
your contracts in ServiceNow, you can keep group con-
tracts by how soon they will be expiring, and take appro-
priate renewal or switch action.
• 
Actual ServiceNow user experience: Are users experienc-
ing slowness in ServiceNow? Poor instance performance 
can become a serious issue as more people depend on 
ServiceNow. You can keep an eye on actual users’ expe-
rience of slowness in ServiceNow as shown below in  
figures 7-6 and 7-7, and further discussed in Appendix B. 
With live widgets such as those the ServiceNow admin-
istrator (or service desk) can gauge if ServiceNow is  
currently much slower than usual (so escalate) or if it’s 
just a singular issue.
• 
ServiceNow fulfillment users count: As discussed in 
Chapter 3, you can pin to your home page a widget that 
tracks the number of active users in ServiceNow.

ITSM records
Still on the topic of useful reporting for those actually on the job, you can har-
ness data not only to guide the team to tame SLA and P1 fires as they emerge; 
you can use reports to motivate individual contributors to act in plausible 
ways out of their own initiative.

experienced and compare if it coincided with long-running system transactions

Studies show that showing people how they compare to their proximal peers 
(such as their neighbors or colleagues at work) on a particular metric or on 
a desired behavior is a powerful way to influence their behavior. Seeing what 
similar others are doing gives people the motivation to do that little bit more 
that will put them in line with their peers.
For example, in a study on 290 households in San Marcos, California, research-
ers informed the households about their energy consumption and offered 
practical tips on how to conserve energy. Some households were also told 
that their energy consumption was higher than that of their neighbors on 
average.2
When researchers went back to check the energy consumption readings for 
the neighborhood they found that the households that were told that they 
were consuming above average had noticeably reduced their energy consump-
tion. Knowing that they were consuming more than their neighbors directly 
influenced their behavior for the better.
Back to ITSM, you can influence individual contributors to log and assign tick-
ets to themselves by showing them that others in the department are doing it.
If you want service desk analysts to handle more tickets by themselves and 
escalate fewer tickets to higher tiers, show them a statistic about how some 
analysts do that successfully more than they do.
In ServiceNow, you can create live reports that compare individual contribu-
tors or teams to each other and make sure those lagging behind in the desired 
metrics are shown the way for catch up. For example, you can regularly com-
municate who in the team (or department) has had:
• 
highest number of tickets assigned;
• 
highest number of tickets closed;
• 
highest participation in tickets;
• 
highest number of change requests;
• 
highest number of tickets resolved on the spot (FCR).
Because numbers could be low in a particular day or week it may be more 
encouraging to compare performance to all-time records in the department, 
or the all-time running total, like in the Guinness World Records.
You may think of such motivational tactics for kids not worthy of management 
attention. They actually work in serious contexts also and lead to the positive 
change that management seeks.

In the California study cited above, all households were told what the average 
energy consumption was in the neighborhood was but the group for which 
significant positive change was tracked they had also added a smiley face (☹) 
subtly indicating that being below their peers average was ☹.
At Al Jazeera, the Service Management team deployed the motivational tactics 
and ServiceNow reports mentioned above. For some time, the engineer log-
ging the most change requests was even prized with chocolates while com-
parison reports between teams were shown regularly in CAB meetings.
In further testimony on how peer reports influence people, some analysts also 
reached out to me privately to understand how they were doing relative to 
their peers.
Metrics from the reports are also taken in consideration in the quarterly and 
yearly review of individuals’ performance.
Measuring user adoption
You are reading this book because your challenge is to get people to use 
ServiceNow. Here are metrics you can use to track progress towards your 
goal.
1. How many people have been assigned tickets?
The number of people with assigned tickets indicates the breadth of adoption 
across your fulfiller teams. You may have assigned ITIL licenses to all your IT 
department, but how many of them actually have had a ticket assigned? You 
may be surprised.
To get a ticket assigned in ServiceNow is to work on ServiceNow. Over time, 
the number of people that had at least one (or ten) tickets assigned in the past 
week has to approach the number of working people in your department. If it 
is not, it means people are not really using it.
Another indicator about the breadth of usage is how many people have logged 
in to ServiceNow. Again, you may be surprised to note how infrequently some 
people log in to ServiceNow.
2. How many tickets per assignee a week
The first metric was to determine the breadth of ServiceNow adoption 
amongst your ServiceNow team and identify those who in reality have not 
got any work done on the tool.
The next natural dimension is to measure the depth of usage: those that have 
got a ticket assigned in ServiceNow, how many tickets they have assigned per 
week?

Spinning Up ServiceNow
113
You can use this metric each time you introduce a new process. For example, 
you first ask how many Incident tickets people have assigned. Once you intro-
duce Change management, then you ask how many Change requests has each 
engineer logged?
For example, you may easily discover that six months since you launched your 
Change management policy, people barely log 1.5 changes a month on average. 
When you see this, you know it’s not working.
How many self-service users?
The strategy preached in Chapter 4 for automatically creating incidents via 
email eliminates the need for callers to use ServiceNow. So for Incident man-
agement, your self-service adoption challenge is sorted from the beginning. 
That’s not the case for Request fulfillment however.
There, end users need to go to the self-service portal and submit their service 
requests from there.
To measure the effectiveness of your Request portal, you can track in 
ServiceNow the number of request tickets that have been logged by the 
requester (requested for = opened by) as in Figure 7-8 below.
Tracking those metrics will be particularly important in the initial ground-
breaking weeks and months of the initiative. If you see that about the same 
number of tickets has been logged this month as in previous months and you 
know that a lot more work is actually going around the organization then you 
know you have a user adoption problem.
Figure 7-8.  Spline trend report showing the number of requests opened in 2016 through Al 
Jazeera’s self-service portal by non-IT staff

Chapter 7 | Reporting
114
In such a case you may decide to intensify training, reconsider a decision 
made about not automatically rerouting all email tickets sent to ServiceNow 
(Chapter 4), reduce the complexity involved in updating tickets in ServiceNow, 
backtrack on the number of processes launched at once, etc.
Once you get through this initial phase you can use the same metrics again, 
but to track compliance to the specific process that you have just introduced 
(e.g., Change management).
Management reports
From reports management want to see that month-to-month, quarter-to-
quarter, or year-to-year things are improving. They want to see that things are 
getting better than they used to be and not staying constant (or worsening). 
This is what trend reports are for.
“The key drivers of future revenue growth are trending positive, and we 
remain confident in Twitter's future.”
—Jack Dorsey, founder and CEO of Twitter
Generally speaking, management is interested in two things: customer satis-
faction going up and costs of operation going down (operational efficiency). 
Of course the two are at odds with each other, but that’s why they invest in 
process automation and training.
Trend reports could also be used to identify time-specific correlations to use 
in rota and maintenance windows planning.
For example do you know which is typically your busiest hour of the day? Is 
December a busier month than April?
Customer satisfaction
Besides the traditional how-satisfied-were-you surveys, you can look at the 
data in ServiceNow to gauge how satisfied or frustrated customers may be 
with your service as have done the California researchers in the study going 
back and checking the actual energy consumption readings
From an Incident management perspective the most important thing for the 
customer is to have her issue solved as quickly as possible (all other things 
being equal, e.g., politeness). Even if you consider Request fulfillment, there too 
the speed by which you deliver their request is a key target.
Based on ITIL recommendations, ServiceNow provides reports on the  
following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure customer satisfaction:

Spinning Up ServiceNow
115
	1.	 Average incident resolution time: Measures how quickly inci-
dents are resolved on average
	2.	 First time resolution rate: Measures how many incidents are 
solved on the spot, for example during the customer’s 
first call
	3.	 Incident resolution within SLA: You told stakeholders that 
you resolve most issues within X hours. Are you keeping 
that promise?
	4.	 Number of repeated incidents: Do you fix issues perma-
nently or do they keep happening again shortly after you 
say they have been fixed.
	5.	 Involvement required: I also propose a more applicable vari-
ant of FTR which measures how much user involvement 
it takes to resolve an incident even if it was not solved on 
the spot. That is how many times on average did the caller 
have to leave a comment to the ticket before the issue is 
solved?
This can be measured in ServiceNow with a custom met-
ric that counts the number of comments the customer 
had to leave per ticket and allows you to identify those 
service desk analysts that keep putting the ticket on hold 
pending user input, instead of obtaining the requested 
details by themselves (which they often can).
Misleading data
In terms of issues customers would much rather have no incidents in the first 
place! So the most important metric would be to track the total number of 
incidents and make sure that on month-to-month there are fewer incidents.
Counting that in ServiceNow is very easy; the problem is that it can be mis-
leading. Are there fewer incidents in ServiceNow because there are fewer 
issues in practice or is it because fewer have been logged in the system?
Jamie Duncalf, IT Operations Manager at TransAlta, exemplifies this thinking 
by saying “we saw an immediate increase in recorded incidents. While this may 
seem counterintuitive, it was exactly what we wanted. It meant that our end 
users were comfortable reporting incidents online rather than doing an end 
run around our processes.”3

whitepapers/cs-transalta.pdf

Chapter 7 | Reporting
116
When I worked with business users, it struck me to note how they all simply 
avoided reporting issues to IT even if it was to the detriment of the business 
or work that they were doing. We would be doing something together and an 
issue would show up with the software we were using; in my mind I instinc-
tively thought of reporting a bug or a feature request but to my surprise they 
didn’t think about it at all.
I wondered if this was just a singular experience, but Gartner and Forrester 
have also observed the same and estimate that 70-80% of problems impacting 
end users are never reported or detected, calling this the “IT visibility gap”.4
You may find the statistic exaggerated but note that studies observing how 
people make decisions on the job have also found that when faced with an 
issue people on the job do not tend to weigh all their available options and 
pick one rationally.
What they do instead is take the first plausible option that comes to mind, the 
one that will do. Nobel Prize winner Herbert A. Simon coined this behavior as 
“satisficing”, a combination of satisfy and suffice.
Back to Service Management: It will generally be too early to assume that all of 
the reportable issues are being logged in ServiceNow and so you will normally 
see the number of incidents—even the number of P1 incidents—going up. You 
can also report on:
1. Percentage of the total
What you can report on to identify if things are improving are percentages. 
For example, how many incidents are resolved within SLA out of the total 
number of incidents logged? If the percentage is going up, and so is the number 
of logged incidents, then things are trending in the right direction.
Apple for apple
Password resets are notoriously quick incidents sorted on the phone. For 
those cases, a First time resolution close to 100% is the norm.
For issues that require physically going to the user to replace hardware for 
example, things will typically take much longer. But reporting on metrics calcu-
lated from the average for data skewed like this will be misleading.
You will get a meaningful report if you examine singular ticket categories sepa-
rately so you are comparing apples for apples.
You may for example categorize password resets separately, take aim at reduc-
ing password reset incidents by introducing a self-service password reset 
solution and then again use reports to measure the impact of the solution.

starts-frictionless-user-experience/

Spinning Up ServiceNow
117
Conflicting interests
Some reports will be based on what close code the analyst used to close the 
ticket (see figure 7-9). This makes your report only as accurate as the people 
logging the ticket.
Measuring repeat incidents for example can be tricky because the issue may 
present itself in a slightly different context each time. But the team logging the 
ticket may not log it as a repeat incident and if asked, argue that the two issues 
may be similar but are technically different.
It is also not in their interest to log repeat incidents. Why didn’t they fix it the 
first time?
The ideal solution to those conflict-of-interest dilemmas is to have another 
party not invested in the matter log the repeat incident. In practice however 
this may not be worthwhile.
So it is important that you watch out for reports that are based on human 
input and take them with a grain of salt, or exclude them completely from 
your reporting suite.
Operational efficiency
If the average time it takes your team to resolve incidents is falling then things 
must be operating more smoothly under the hood.
Often times however, the average may not be falling and you need a more 
detailed analysis to understand why it takes your team so long to resolve 
incidents (or deliver on requests). Enter the domain of operation efficiency 
reports.
Figure 7-9.  ServiceNow’s out-of-box report on repeated incidents is based on the close 
code used by the analyst to close the ticket. So the report will only be as good as the input. 
An alternative that may uncover repeat incidents is to check on the number of incidents 
logged per caller and assigned to the same assignment group. If a caller had many tickets 
assigned to the same group in a short span of time, it may well be a repeat incident.

Chapter 7 | Reporting
118
Factors that delay an incident resolution may be organization-specific but two 
essential ones are covered by ServiceNow Out-of-box reports:
	1.	 Incidents assigned more than once: This report indicates 
how long it takes to identify the team responsible to fix 
the issue. Ideally, an incident should be directly assigned 
to the team responsible for solving it from the beginning. 
Otherwise the longer the ticket stays in limbo, the longer 
the issue will wait before it is worked on and so the lon-
ger it will take to solve.
	2.	 Remotely resolved incidents: Issues that require mobilizing 
on-site support will take longer to resolve than issues 
solved remotely by the service desk.
The auto-assignment configurations discussed in chapters 4 and 11 take aim 
at reducing re-assignments by automatically identifying the correct assignment 
group for an incident. You could track the effectiveness of those automations 
using the above reports.
Furthermore, from those reports you may observe that a large number of 
similar tickets get regularly escalated from the service desk but that given 
adequate tools and access could be solved by the desk directly. For example 
granting access to modify user details in Active Directory or in ServiceNow 
(see Chapter 3).
Standard dynamic reports
If you ask team leaders about their reporting needs, you will definitely come 
to this conclusion: most of their reporting needs are the same.
They all want to know how many SLAs their team has breached, how many 
tickets the team processed, who handled most of the tickets, which tickets 
kept being re-opened from the caller, what tickets are outstanding for a long 
time, etc.
When reports are created based on the requirements from teams, demand 
that instead of creating reports custom-built for teams, only create dynamic 
reports that display different data based on the person logged in to view the 
report (see figure 7-10).
Figure 7-10.  Dynamic filters allow the report to show different data based on who is 
viewing the report

Spinning Up ServiceNow
119
Dynamic reports allow you to ensure the same reports and calculations are 
used by all teams across the department or organization, and that you can 
immediately on-board new teams in ServiceNow without having to create 
duplicate reports for them. You can also share new useful reports requested 
by one team with other teams.
Also, if your department has identified a number of key metrics that it wants 
to improve in dynamic reports will allow teams in the department and even 
individual contributors to measure their progress against the same metrics 
and using the same calculation methods.
If you examine some out-of-box reports you will notice that some include 
javascript:getMyGroups() in a filter that expects a group, for example the 
Assignment group as shown in Figure 7-11.
This string allows the report to be dynamically populated with the groups the 
person logged in to view the report is a member of.
In Chapter 3 we also discussed the concept of setting a primary group for 
each user. Use this string to create dynamic reports that only show the tickets 
of one's primary group:
javascript:gs.getUser().getRecord().getValue('u_primary_group')
Figure 7-11.  Open Incidents by Assignment (My Groups) report shows the tickets assigned to 
the teams the logged-in user viewing the report belongs to

Chapter 7 | Reporting
120
Every ITIL user can create a report in ServiceNow while users with a report-
group role can create and share reports with others.
Report-admins and report-global can also create reports visible to everyone 
such as the set of dynamic reports discussed above.
Report on all tickets
When you create a report in ServiceNow, the first thing that you have to set 
is on which record table you want to run the report. This can be Incident, 
Catalog task, Change request, User, etc.
Most of the time however, people will be interested in running reports on all 
tickets assigned to their team, regardless of whether they were Incidents or 
Catalog tasks. In this case, you will want to run your reports on the Task table 
(see Figure 7-12). This is because in ServiceNow every Incident is automati-
cally a Task, and so are Problem tickets, Catalog tasks, etc.
ServiceNow comes with an Open and Critical Work report that runs on the 
Task table and shows all open tickets that have the priority set as P1. You can 
create similar reports on the Task table.
There is also a Task type field in the Task table that allows you to group by cer-
tain ticket types if you only want to report on Problems and Change Requests.
Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
Liberate reports from being a management thing only and 
ensure contributors can make the most out of the data in 
their daily operations.
• 
Showing people how they compare to their proximal 
peers on a particular metric is a powerful way to influ-
ence their behavior.
Figure 7-12. The Task type field in the Task table allows you to group or filter tickets by type 
(Incident, Change, Problem, etc.)

• 
Instead of how-satisfied-were-you surveys look at the 
data in ServiceNow to gauge how satisfied or frustrated 
customers really were.
• 
To get tickets assigned is to work on ServiceNow. If 
the number of people that had tickets assigned is low, it 
means people are not using it.
• 
The longer the ticket stays in limbo between teams, the 
longer the wait before it is worked on and the longer it 
will take to solve.
• 
If you ask team leaders about their reporting needs, you 
will definitely come to this conclusion: most of their 
reporting needs are the same.

What you will be doing on ServiceNow after

In the end, a strategy is nothing but good intentions unless it's effectively 
implemented.
—Clayton Christensen, Harvard professor and author on innovation1
ServiceNow is promoted as an extremely flexible software platform, and 
it is. Still as in other web applications changes made to it can immediately 
affect all users on the platform. For this how you go about implementing 
changes to your ServiceNow instance can be a deal breaker in the success of 
ServiceNow at your organization and in your reputation managing this enter-
prise application.
In my experience for example spam or irrelevant emails accidentally sent from 
ServiceNow could lead to high-profile escalations and cause a publicity blun-
der for the department and those responsible.

On such an occasion I recall handling the apology to a high-profile TV pre-
senter that emailed complaining about spam emails that she received from 
ServiceNow.
Furthermore, if the resolution of a critical issue is somehow delayed because 
of ServiceNow, confidence in the system will be eroded and people will be 
justified in bypassing it, while questions will be raised about ServiceNow’s fit-
ness for the organization (or your ability to manage it).

Customization vs. configuration
The definition of what is a customization versus what is just a configuration is 
widely debated by ServiceNow practitioners and the industry at large. Let me 
clear my thoughts on it before we move further.
Software platform vendors tend to consider most of their clients’ changes as 
configurations of their mighty out-of-box functionality but when you contact 
their support helpdesk for help with something that you have changed in your 
instance you will often be told that your change is considered custom devel-
opment and thus they cannot help you with it.
So, configurations can be defined as changes in your ServiceNow instance 
that are made using options built into the ServiceNow user interface for 
which you can normally get support from ServiceNow’s HI helpdesk. When 
the change/configuration does not work as expected and it’s reproducible, it 
may be filed as a platform bug in ServiceNow.
Examples of such supported-for-free configurations may include the creation 
of a new Access control rule, a new Workflow using the Workflow engine, 
layout re-arrangement of fields, or the creation of new fields.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
127
A customization is when you modify code, or add new one. Changes to the 
code of inbound email actions, new Client scripts, or Business rules that 
have code in them are all examples of customizations. ServiceNow HI will 
normally shun away from debugging your code. If it involves scripting, it’s a 
customization.
The good new is that with every new release of ServiceNow the list of con-
figurations directly supported by the ServiceNow’s user interface expands. 
Many of the things that required scripting in earlier versions can now be 
achieved with configuration. New releases also introduce new out-of-box fea-
tures which you had to previously develop as customization in your instance.
But also the options for customization and development have increased. In 
fact in 2015 ServiceNow introduced a slew of tools to help developers better 
manage their code, while the Istanbul release introduces automated testing.
Why companies customize
Out-of-box functionality is great; you already paid for it and should use it as 
often as possible. However, most of the time organizations need to customize 
because of their unique circumstances.
In theory, you could force your service desk and organization to run with 
ServiceNow as is, but it’s much easier to mold ServiceNow to run as suits 
your organization and circumstances than to coerce your organization to fit 
into a square hole.
As Randy Mott, chief information officer at General Motors, puts it: “companies 
that win in their industries are the ones that figure out how to get ahead, because 
getting competitive advantage takes innovation, it takes creativity, and you're not 
going to get that from someone who's going to make everyone on the planet even."
When it comes to ServiceNow it may be sold to management on how much 
there is already OOB and how little configuration will be needed to meet 
most of the business needs, while technical folks will be invited to participate 
in hacking hijinks at conferences such as the CreatorCon.
It depends on your interest. Software developers tend to prefer customizing 
the system to perform as they specify. They take pride in their code and are 
sometimes accused of avoiding already existing solutions only because they 
were made by others (this is known as the “not invented here” syndrome).
Business people on the other hand are less interested in new technical  
challenges and tend to prefer ready-made solutions that can be contracted at 
a predictable expense and are guaranteed by reputable vendors. Many of them, 

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
128
acknowledge from experience however that off-the-shelf software alone is 
rarely sufficient to get their business going, and so they need to have some 
expertise in-house.
What are those customizations that we are talking about so much?
Here are three examples of the kind of customizations. You will also find more 
examples of customizations that ServiceNow customers typically make in 
Chapter 11, and even more documented online.
Many organizations like Harvard University, Berkeley, CERN, and Fermilab 
research centers have made some of their ServiceNow internal release notes 
publicly available.2,3,4
1. Workflow automation
All automatic behavior and values settings defined in ServiceNow can be cat-
egorized as workflow automation. The goal of workflow automations is to 
streamline the execution of known processes, guide users throughout it, and 
reduce manual steps and the chances of human error and forgetfulness.
Examples of such automations include automating the assignment of tickets 
based on criteria like the email address the issue was reported to, the location 
of the caller, or the product (Configuration item) the support request is for.  
A more detailed discussion of assignment logic is in Chapter 11.
Approval requests can be automatically sent based on whom the request is 
for and fulfillment tasks can be automatically generated and assigned based 
on a predefined workflow set for the requested item. For example, the termi-
nation of an employee’s services could simultaneously trigger multiple tasks 
for the different teams responsible for the deactivation of the services the 
employee had.
For routine back-end workflows, you can define a workflow of actions and 
approvals that need to be taken in sequence to decommission a server for 
example (Figure 8-1).

2. Convenience and cosmetic customizations
When examined critically, many of the customizations we made at Al Jazeera 
were in theory unnecessary. But in practice our stakeholders found them 
critical for their smooth operations.
For example, prior to ServiceNow the service desk was used to receive 
incoming emails in a shared inbox and as the emails arrived, available agents 
would glance at the email and flag it to indicate that they were on it. Seeing 
the email flagged, other colleagues also looking at the inbox will divert their 
attention to other unclaimed emails (Figure 8-2).
Figure 8-1.  Sequence of automatically created tasks triggered by a workflow
Figure 8-2.  Flags in Outlook

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
130
But when tickets started pouring in ServiceNow, there were no flags for tick-
ets and so the agents found themselves claiming the same tickets in the queue 
and sometimes overwriting each others’ messages and assignments.
An agent would open a ticket while another agent also had the same ticket 
open. Each would assign and make changes to the ticket, but would not know 
of other updates until after she posted her updates to the ticket.
I proposed solutions like having agents quickly assign tickets to themselves 
directly from the list view of tickets, or asking agents to shout the ticket they 
just claimed but none were deemed appropriate (Figure 8-3).
So in the end we introduced a customization that suited our service desk5: As 
soon as you open a ticket, you will be informed if someone else has also been 
on the ticket recently. Also, when you click to save your changes to a ticket 
you will be informed if someone else made new changes in the meantime, and 
you will be given the option to hold your changes.
In ServiceNow’s newest User Interface (UI16) a similar feature has been 
introduced showing you who else is also viewing the ticket at the same time 
as you. So after upgrading to the Helsinki release our stakeholders found the 
new User presence functionality satisfactory, and so we removed our custom-
ization (Figure 8-4).
Figure 8-3.  If you right-click on a ticket in a list, you can quickly assign it to yourself with 
one more click.
5The customization we introduced was based on the Simultaneous Update Alert script 
provided by the official ServiceNow Wiki: http://wiki.servicenow.com/index.
php?title=Simultaneous_Update_Alert

Spinning Up ServiceNow
131
You can bet that many of the things your stakeholders want will not (yet) be 
in ServiceNow in a suitable fashion, and so you will have to implement them 
as customizations.
For another example, we also removed the impact and urgency fields from 
ticket forms, giving ITIL users direct control over the priority and tying each 
priority to an SLA. The priority itself was renamed to include the number of 
SLA hours associated with this priority (Figure 8-5).
We also customized the look and feel of email notifications (discussed in 
Chapter 5) as well as which fields show up in user and ticket preview windows.
3. Access control
Generally speaking ServiceNow may be too permissive for your teams and 
the kind of data dealt with. So you may introduce customizations that control 
who can see what (tickets confidentiality is discussed in Chapter 9).
You may also need to create new special access controls that for example give 
contracts administrators the capability to add new vendors in ServiceNow 
but not the ability to create or delete user accounts.
Figure 8-4. The new presence feature in ServiceNow shows you how many people are 
currently looking at the ticket that you are also viewing
Figure 8-5. When creating a new Incident ITIL users have to manually set the priority. A P2 
priority has a 10-hours SLA

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
132
The examples above illustrated why making ServiceNow work to suit your 
organization will require configuration and sometimes also customizations. 
That said, think twice before allowing the development of new customizations 
especially if there is something similar out of the box.
Many of the configurable options in ServiceNow can have undesired side 
effects resulting, for example, in duplicate email notifications, as discussed in 
Chapters 4 and 5.
Customization process
For building “quality applications” on the ServiceNow platform, ServiceNow 
recommends the following development process:6
	1.	 Define business requirements.
	2.	 Define what information the application needs to track.
	3.	 Build the application.
	4.	 Test the application.
	5.	 Share the application on the ServiceNow Store.
Even if you are not developing a fully-fledged application on ServiceNow, you 
will benefit by adhering to a development process that above all sets the 
expectations for your stakeholders and then delivers on them in a predicable 
fashion.
In essence, your stakeholders need to have clear and consistent answers to 
the following questions about the way customizations and changes are made 
to the instance:
	1.	 How are customization requests reported and 
tracked?
Stakeholders can chat with you about their feature requests or bugs. But then 
what happens with their requests? How can they follow up on them? How do 
they know if and when they will be released?
An Excel spreadsheet or initial requirements document may be fine as a start-
ing point but often there will need to be a discussion between developers, 
analysts, stakeholders, and testers for each new feature before the final out-
come is ready. Where will you track all this?
6https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/helsinki-application-development/
page/build/applications/reference/r_BasicDevelopmentProcess.html

Spinning Up ServiceNow
133
	2.	 Where will customizations be developed?
	3.	 How do you deploy customizations?
Especially for an enterprise platform like ServiceNow on which stakeholders 
rely to perform their work daily, stakeholders will be anxious if you make 
unannounced changes on the instance while they are also using it.
As the manager of the application you want to give them the confidence 
that developments are made on another instance and not on the production 
instance, while deployments to the production instance are controlled by an 
open process that involves stakeholders in testing and notification.
At Al Jazeera developments are made in a non-production instance and are 
packaged together for deployment to the production instance at a time agreed 
upon by the stakeholders.
Stakeholders are also typically given a window of three days to preview and 
test the latest developments in the Test instance so they can report on issues 
they may identify before deployment to the live instance (Figure 8-6).
The objectives of the development process are to:
	1.	 maximize the stability of your ServiceNow produc-

Requirements backlog
Requirements will be coming at you from meetings with stakeholders, emails, 
and your own observations. It’s important that you then store all of them in 
one place that is central and shared with your stakeholders, and that is flexible 
enough to keep track of related conversations and updates.
In the spirit of eating your own dog food, I recommend you track all issues and 
enhancement requests for your ServiceNow instance in your ServiceNow 
instance itself.
This is a common practice in the IT industry and it has been cited from big 
name companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Google, and YouTube. In 1980 the 
president of Apple Computers famously wrote a memo announcing:
“Effective Immediately!! No more typewriters are to be purchased, 
leased etc., etc. … We believe the typewriter is obsolete. Let's prove 
it inside before we try and convince our customers.” 7
By the same token, using your own ServiceNow instance will give you and 
your ServiceNow developers and administrators a direct first-hand experi-
ence of managing tickets in ServiceNow both from a user perspective as well 
as from a resolvers’ perspective. Ideally, your external partners should also 
use ServiceNow, as discussed in Chapter 3.
Prioritization
As with any software development project, prioritization of requirements and 
the management of stakeholders’ expectations can be challenging.
As quoted in earlier chapters Jason Fried, co-founder of Basecamp, illustrates 
this common problem as follows: “I found project-based consulting frustrating 
because we would work on a site for months and hand it over to the client, who 
would inevitably make changes and drag us through their politics. It was rare that 
what we actually built saw the light of day.”8

Spinning Up ServiceNow
135
This is even more so in an internal organization where there is no charge for 
requirements and with ServiceNow, for which it is commonly perceived that 
everything is either already available out-of-box or can be easily accomplished 
through a few clicks.
Dealing With wish lists  Use time constraints to trade-off requirements
Charge and involve stakeholders in development
The software development industry has proposed many prioritization meth-
ods, including MoSCoW.
With MoSCoW, for each requirement with which you agree with the stake-
holder, you also set the priority as either Must have, Should have, Could have, 
or Won’t have.
Because most stakeholders often have too many Must-haves at Al Jazeera we 
instead inform stakeholders of how much effort each requirement is roughly 
expected to take in the upcoming development sprint so they prioritize rela-
tive to other requirements proposed for the sprint. The discussion in the 
backlog review would go like this:
“In two weeks, we could implement Feature X and Feature Y. Feature Z is 
likely to take a week on its own.
“Shall we then go ahead with X and Y for the next release, and also squeeze 
in a fix for J, K, and H?”
Chargeback
At Volkswagen, the director of ServiceNow told me that to prioritize require-
ments, he asks internal customers coming to him with new requirements and 
workflows to implement in ServiceNow to also bring with them the budget 
for the requested development.
Thanks to such an internal chargeback system, internal customers think 
twice before asking for complex new workflows, as well as prioritize within 
themselves which requirements are really going to deliver the most value 
to them.

a-product-business.html

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
136
Once delivered they will already be invested to use it and make it pay off, not 
to look bad in front of their management for budget misuse.
Without a chargeback system, you run the risk of building features and work-
flows that ultimately nobody uses, as Jason Fried said and I occasionally expe-
rienced at Al Jazeera.
If you can implement a form of internal chargeback for ServiceNow custom-
izations, do it. If not, consider investing them as much as possible in the devel-
opment and testing of their own customizations as discussed below.
The University of California, Berkeley website informs that each department 
using ServiceNow is responsible for the licensing fees of its staff and that as 
of 2017, each department will also be expected to contribute to the support 
and maintenance costs of ServiceNow.9
IKEA effect
An alternative to charging departments from their budgets is to put them in 
charge of the development.
Whenever possible, seek to invest requesters’ own labor in achieving their 
requirements, such us letting them make their own changes in ServiceNow. 
This is after all supposed to be why Fred Luddy, ServiceNow founder, started 
ServiceNow in the first place:
“Ordinary people should be able to create meaningful applications for their 
organizations.”10
For complex development involve them in the communication with the devel-
opers and the testing. As studies show, the more involved the stakeholder is in 
a fruitful project, the more they will value the outcome and the more under-
standing they will be of possible delays and limitations.
In a study,11 Michael Norton et al. illustrate how irrationally people tend to 
value a product that they were involved in making, such as self-assembled 
IKEA furniture.

Subjects in the study were found to be willing to pay up to 63% more for 
products they had assembled than for the same item assembled by others. 
Some participants were even found to value their own creations five times as 
much as another group’s valuation for the same product.
That is, those who invested labor in making something, consider it much more 
valuable than if it were done by others.
Development and testing
Poorly designed customizations can lead to unexpected side effects in unex-
pected areas of the application, need rework, and offer an inconsistent user 
experience. In short, your ServiceNow instance can become a mess!
The responsibility for designing good solutions falls on your ServiceNow 
developers, but this often also requires understanding and collaboration from 
the client too.
As the manager of the application, you can set the expectation for both busi-
ness users with requirements (yourself included) and developers for the kind 
of customizations you allow on the platform, and those that you reject (even 
if possible) in favor of simpler solutions coherent with the overall design in 
ServiceNow.
Role of Management  Veto complex requirements
Set standards
A wonderful example of management that understands the simplicity principle 
comes from a 2006 interview with Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs was asked about Microsoft’s new iPod competitor and its com-
munity-building feature. Steve Jobs dismissed it by noting how unnecessarily 
complicated it was:12
“I’ve seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find 
another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three 
times. It takes forever. By the time you’ve gone through all that, the girl’s 
got up and left!”
“You’re much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her 
ear. Then you’re connected with about two feet of headphone cable.”
12https://signalvnoise.com/posts/52-steve-jobs-just-put-it-in-her-ear?69

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
138
The same logic reasoned by Steve Jobs can be applied to ServiceNow 
requirements. For example, a common issue fretted about when introducing 
ServiceNow to your department is which categories and sub-categories there 
should be.
The categories the service desk wants will undoubtedly not be the same cate-
gories the network team wants, and the same is likely to be true for each team 
because each team deals with different issues and has a particular world view.
In this context the please-all requirement may come as:
Show different categories based on which team the ticket is assigned to.
But this is a convoluted solution and requires twisting ServiceNow’s catego-
ries by adding new tables and team-based access constraints. Why go this way?
Rather than forcing a solution on ServiceNow, it would be better to identify a 
solution that works with the ServiceNow default way.
A much simpler solution for example (and one that requires no coding) is to 
add all category options with a designated team prefix for ease of reference.
For example, categories of the service desk can be prefixed with the “SD” 
prefix as in “SD: Access,” while Network team categories with the “NET” 
prefix as in “NET: Connectivity.”
This way all teams have their categories, each team can easily find their cat-
egories and no convoluted ServiceNow configuration and development is 
required. Additionally, you could also use the category field to identify the 
team whose categories you want to preview in the subcategory field only.
You get the idea; encourage creative yet simple solutions to the requirements 
proposed by your stakeholders (Figure 8-7).
Figure 8-7.  Incident subcategory used to list the Network's team categories

Spinning Up ServiceNow
139
Other subcategories would be shown if the Category selected was Service desk 
(Figure 8-8).
Consistent standards
As new feature requests come in and changes are made, your instance behav-
ior can become unpredictable and confusing.
A principle of good application design is to minimize the thinking process your 
users have to go through using your application, making sure things tend to be 
where they expect them across the application. Applied to ServiceNow, here 
are some standards I recommend you adhere to when planning new changes:
1. Minimize the number of buttons on forms
As per good user interaction practice, your screen should have a very limited 
number of call-to-action buttons (ideally, only one).
Figure 8-8.  Incident category drop-down with team-based categories prefixed with a prefix 
for each team for ease of identification and navigation

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
140
For this, rather than add new buttons to your forms, add new options in the 
Context menu accessible by right-clicking the ticket header (Figure 8-10). The 
buttons displayed on the form should be only the most common two or three 
actions you expect users to take on the ticket in its current state (Figure 8-9).
Hold updates the ticket but keeps it on hold (Figure 8-10).
2. Human message with every email
It’s common for users to overlook email notifications received from a website 
or ticketing system, because many of them are computer-generated.
It is better if you set the standard for ServiceNow notifications to be only 
triggered with a message typed in by somebody. Once users notice that, they 
will be more likely to take your emails seriously and you eliminate the risk 
of ServiceNow inadvertently spamming your organization with computer-
generated emails.
To ensure this, you would mandate that closing a ticket or putting it on hold 
would require the person changing the ticket status to also write a human-
readable comment to the caller. Such requirements will trigger them to think 
more carefully about the change.
3. Limit team-specific customizations
As illustrated with categories, it is very likely that every team using ServiceNow 
will delight in giving you custom changes specific to their team.
They will want different notifications to be sent, different names for fields on 
the form, and even a different layout for the same fields.
Figure 8-10. The context menu accessible by right-clicking a ticket header provides 
additional options.
Figure 8-9.  Unhold updates the ticket and resets the state to Work in progress.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
141
As of the Istanbul release, ServiceNow is not built for having a different inci-
dent form for each team; it can be done creating team-specific access roles 
and rules, new tables or new views.
But it can grow messy and become difficult to manage. If you can, it would be 
better to limit team-specific customizations and ensure the layout and behav-
ior of ticket forms shared by multiple teams be consistent for all users.
4. Transparent behavior
What happens If I write a comment? Who will be notified? Will an email be 
sent if I close the ticket without writing a comment? Once I submit a request, 
to whom will the approval request be sent?
13 Here is an illustrative example of the sort of questions and confusion that 
non-transparent behavior raises in the mind of its users. As published by 
Harvard University IT on its website, a user asked:
I have a question about “watcher” notifications in ServiceNow. Someone 
else added me (and a few others) as a watcher to this ticket INC00882705 
and made work note updates four times since May. We only today received 
a notification email that the work notes had been updated-she closed the 
ticket and stated we hadn’t gotten back to her. Can you explain when 
watcher notification emails are and aren’t sent out for a ticket? In this 
case, the person who was updating the work notes thought that we were 
getting notified but in fact we were not and so the ticket went unnoticed.
I’ve asked the user to assign tickets to our queue instead of adding us as 
watchers, but it would be nice to know when watcher notifications will/
won’t be sent out.
Users of your system will be wondering about these questions as they use 
ServiceNow and it is not the feature of a good system if users feel puzzled or 
out of control.
For this, when you make new backed-end customizations remember to also 
to show information messages in context that make obvious the new unex-
pected behavior of the customization (Figure 8-11).
13http://huit.harvard.edu/files/huit/files/feature_report_for_snow_
release_-_101614.pdf

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
142
Also, whenever possible try to make things visible directly in front of the user. 
For example, if approval will be collected from her line manager, make that 
obvious in the request form and copy her in the CC of the approval request 
so that she can chase her manager to approve.
Development instance
ServiceNow is a flexible application and many things in it can be configured 
without coding. But whether coding or not, not all changes are equal.
A change to inbound email actions or the addition of one email notification 
may sabotage your instance processing of incoming support emails, or spam 
them with unexpected email notifications. A few events in which customer 
emails were missed are sufficient to erode trust in the application and lead to 
escalation to senior management.
For this, it’s important to guard your production instance from uncontrolled 
changes to functionality shared by many users. It’s better to make changes 
and test them in a non-production instance first, and then deploy them to the 
production instance in a controlled fashion.
Your license contract with ServiceNow normally provides you with two 
ServiceNow instances: one production instance and one non-production 
instance. The non-production instance is provided to you for development 
and testing.
You should strive to maintain both instances identical in terms of configura-
tion and customizations, with all developments being done in the non-produc-
tion instance first and then transferred to the production instance.
Occasionally, you will also want to clone your production instance onto the 
non-production instance to make sure they are in sync (Figure 8-12).
Figure 8-11. When viewing a ticket that is on hold, an information banner informs that the 
ticket will be automatically closed if not updated within a set number of days.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
143
In ServiceNow changes are tracked and packaged in so-called Update sets 
(Figure 8-13). Developers export Update sets from the development instance 
and import them into the Production instance to apply all the developed 
changes at once.
Figure 8-12.  Release developments from your non-production instance to your production 
instance
Figure 8-13.  Multiple update sets may be associated with the same release
Testing and monitoring
In many software development organizations and at Al Jazeera it is common 
to have more than one non-production instance, with an instance dedicated 
just for testing.
Features that have been developed in the development instance are pushed 
to the test instance to be tested by end users. This allows developers to con-
tinue making developments in the development instances, without affecting 
functionality ready for testing in the test instance.
In Appendix A you will find more details about specific areas of the application 
that may benefit from additional testing and monitoring after deployment.
Release and deployment
Imposing the discipline of developing in a non-production instance first does 
not have to be associated with delayed releases in production. Facebook, 
probably the most heavily used software platform in the world, releases new 
developments to Facebook.com twice a day.

Chapter 8 | Customization Process
144
The keys to frequent and stable releases are:
• 
Release in small chunks. Don’t wait long before you 
release; try to always break down projects and features 
in a series of small, and thus relatively safe, releases.
• 
Involve your stakeholders. Even though your developers 
may be confident of the features developed, you want 
your customers to test and confirm they are indeed as 
they wanted before you release.
This is of paramount importance in managing expectations because it will 
give your stakeholders a sense of control over their working environment in 
ServiceNow, but also in the event that bugs show up they will be much more 
understanding because when they tested they could not detect them.
Please note that user testing here is not meant to be an alternative to devel-
oper testing; you should ask customers to test only once developers are con-
fident from their side that the features work.
Finally, after the release you may want to meet with stakeholders again in 
order to:
	1.	 get their feedback on issues discovered after release;
	2.	 prioritize developments for the next release.
For your convenience, Appendix A also lists checklists to help you assess the 
complexity of your customizations and remind you of steps to take before 
and after release.

• 
If ServiceNow HI support helps troubleshoot and fix 
your SN change, then it's a configuration. Otherwise, it's 
a customization.
• 
It is easier to mold ServiceNow to run as suits your cir-
cumstances than to coerce your organization as suits 
OOB. This is why you customize.
• 
Eat your own dog food and track all issues and enhance-
ment requests for your ServiceNow instance in the 
instance itself.

Confidentiality
How to control access on a need-to-know basis 
without hindering cross-team collaboration
When on-boarding new teams and people to ServiceNow one key issue that 
you will have to confront is that of confidentiality. Who sees what will be a 
key question of every new team bringing their daily work life to ServiceNow.
In ServiceNow every user with the ITIL role can search, view, and modify any 
ticket in the system. First-time users of ServiceNow unaccustomed to such 
openings will find it discomforting.
Before ServiceNow, they were used to controlling the visibility of their com-
munications and issues in mailboxes shared only with their close-knit team. 
Now that their work to-dos, their messages with customers and partners 
(and their spelling mistakes) are open to browsing scrutiny by anyone in the 
organization (with an ITIL role) can be discomforting.
Even if you have the leverage to impose ServiceNow, or if some teams are 
already used to publicly searchable tickets, you need to consider confidential-
ity more seriously as you bring more people and teams on-board. The more 
teams you bring, and the more you expect them to use ServiceNow, the more 
confidentiality will be important. Not acknowledging this may subtly hinder 
the adoption of ServiceNow.
In other cases, there will be articulate reasons as to why expanded access 
to ticket information is not acceptable. The reasons can be that the tickets 
handle confidential user information (such as the personal security number) 
or other technical details that could be leaked to outsiders.

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
146
If you decide that you want to have confidentiality in ServiceNow, how should 
you do it? Do you just make all tickets assigned to HR visible only to HR? 
What about the other teams? And cross-team collaboration? And outsiders?
This chapter provides you with two solutions for your confidentiality 
requirements:
	1.	 Domain separation: Rigidly separates tickets, users, and 
configuration
	2.	 Access Control (ACL) rules: Enables teams to flexibly 
extend or restrict access to their tickets on a ticket-by-
ticket basis
Scope of data protection
So what data exactly are we trying to protect? In ServiceNow, data can be 
essentially be categorized as:
	1.	 tickets data, emails, and attachments;
	2.	 users profile data;
	3.	 other records for assets and equipment.
Arguably only tickets data and attachments are exposed in ServiceNow, 
whereas access to assets, contracts and other types of records in ServiceNow 
are more tightly controlled and require users to be granted specific access 
roles. For this, the focus of the confidentiality model here proposed is to pro-
tect access to tickets data, emails, and attachments.
As for Users data, it too is exposed to everyone with an ITIL role in 
ServiceNow; but the same user information is also available to everyone in 
the organization in the global address book (see Figure 9-1), and so it would 
not be a breach if it is also available in ServiceNow.
Figure 9-1.  Global address book in Outlook can show all user profiles in your organization

Spinning Up ServiceNow
147
You can, however, restrict what user information is available in ServiceNow 
by selecting what data is imported in ServiceNow from your directory server 
and, within ServiceNow, make certain fields only visible to certain groups. For 
example, you could make visible who is checked as a VIP in ServiceNow (see 
Figure 9-2) only to the service desk (see Chapter 3).
Figure 9-2.  How the incident caller field changes for VIP users
Ticket data
For each ticket in ServiceNow, there are several layers of information that you 
may want to protect from access by people unrelated to the ticket:
• 
User-visible communication: Those are the messages of 
the caller and the user-visible replies she got on the ticket. 
They may sometimes contain sensitive details about the 
customer, or of things described in the reported issue.
• 
File attachments: The file attachments made to a ticket 
either by the caller or by people from the resolver team. 
Attachments can include screenshots that reveal sensi-
tive information.
• 
Internal notes: The technical details and internal work 
notes about a ticket typed in by members of the resolver 
team and not shared with the customer because of their 
internal nature
• 
Ticket headers: The high-level details about a ticket that 
don’t reveal the content of the ticket but give an indication 
about its status (see Figure 9-3). Ticket headers can be:
• 
ticket number, caller and location;
• 
status, assignment group, and assigned-to person;
• 
timestamp of the ticket creation, and last update;
• 
short description, category, and priority.

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
148
Protection from ServiceNow
ServiceNow as a company will also have access to all of your data, hosting 
it on its own infrastructure. In fact, there is in ServiceNow a special access 
which ServiceNow HI support can use to log with administrative privilege 
into any instance; this special access is called “maint”.
Going on the cloud, you trust ServiceNow not to eavesdrop on your data.
For this, Al Jazeera is among the ServiceNow customers that are not on 
the ServiceNow cloud, self-hosting their instances. But even self-hosting is 
not enough; so long as the instance is publicly accessible on the Internet, 
ServiceNow could access it also. The instance needs to be accessible only 
through VPN for maximum security.
ServiceNow also makes it possible to encrypt data, but if both the encrypted 
data and the keys to decrypt are with ServiceNow, they could again access 
this data.
ServiceNow’s Edge Encryption also allows you to encrypt some data fields 
and host the keys to decrypt this data in your corporate network so that, 
although the data is hosted by ServiceNow, it would not be able to decrypt it 
without the keys hosted on your infrastructure.
Not all fields can be encrypted, however, and together with several limitations1 
and complexities Edge Encryption may be virtually impractical.

ticket and its status

Domain separation
Domain separation in ServiceNow, also known as multi-tenancy, lets you co-
host many independent ServiceNow environments in the same instance. The 
concept is very similar to virtual servers co-hosted in isolation but in the 
same physical server, and goes beyond data protection.
Such separation is intended for Managed Service Providers (MSP), who could 
then have a completely separate environment for each of their clients, all in 
the same instance (see Figure 9-4).

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
150
Under Domain Separation, the MSP starts with one ServiceNow environ-
ment, with all users in it. This is called the “global domain.” The MSP can then 
create new sub-domains under the global domain, and assign users to each 
sub-domain. This way, the people in the sub-domain will only be able to see 
the tickets and data in their domain and not the ones in other sub-domains 
or in the parent domain. It will also be possible to customize forms and work-
flows in the sub-domain to be different from those in other domains.
Users in a parent domain (typically the support teams of the Service Provider) 
and ServiceNow administrators will have access to all data, in all sub-domains.
It is worthwhile to note that Domain Separation complicates things signifi-
cantly. The official ServiceNow documentation warns: “Before activating domain 
separation, consult your ServiceNow representative to verify that it is suitable for your 
environment. Domain separation adds a level of administration overhead. Although it 
can be disabled, it cannot be removed from an instance.”2
As Mark Stanger, author of the ServiceNow Guru blog puts it: “the challenge 
with domain separation is that it’s a very dramatic shift in how the system needs 
to be handled and generally introduces much more complexity than is necessary.”3
There are simpler but equally powerful alternatives as we shall later see in 
this chapter.
Examples
Domain separation is applicable if the users you have in one domain will have 
no need to collaborate with the users in another domain, whatsoever. They 
will be completely segregated.
But if, for example, your IT servicedesk and your HR teams need to collabo-
rate on on-boarding new members or off-boarding terminated employees, 
keeping each in a separate domain will hinder them from collaborating on the 
same tickets and data. If you domain separate HR and IT, for example, HR will 
need to raise a ticket for IT in the segregated IT domain in ServiceNow.
Such segregation within an organization is not consistent with the general 
corporate orientation of breaking silos, and is generally not the level of col-
laboration that organizations hope to achieve from ServiceNow.

administer/company-and-domain-separation/concept/domain-separation.html
3The challenge with domain separation is that it’s a very dramatic shift in how the system 
needs to be handled and generally introduces much more complexity than is necessary.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
151
For example, ServiceNow quotes Kevin Barnard from GE Capital describ-
ing their ServiceNow implementation as: “By teaming with the business, we’ve 
changed the way that people think about IT. There’s no ‘us and them’—we’re all 
playing on the same side.”4
Domain separation puts everyone on a separate side, providing rigid splits of 
data and users that are normally not suitable for collaborating divisions of the 
same organization, but may be suitable for co-hosting multiple independent 
organizations under the same instance.
Domain separation could be suitable to segregate “legal cases” in the legal 
department, for example. It can be assumed that lawyers and staff in the legal 
department will work in isolation on most of their tickets, need strict separa-
tion and control of the data and can treat other users from within the organi-
zation as external users with limited access (until they sign a Non-disclosure 
agreement)!
But if you can avoid it, do. Even for legal, there many simpler solutions that can 
keep their data completely separate and confidential, without the complexity 
and, as ServiceNow called it, “level of administration overhead.”
At Al Jazeera, for example, we do not use domain separation and have built 
new types of tickets for the legal department, with custom access roles. So 
only users from the legal department can see and work on legal cases in 
ServiceNow.
Other support teams at Al Jazeera use the standard Incident tickets in 
ServiceNow, and a lot more often collaborate and re-assign tickets across 
teams. They are also reassured of the confidentiality of their tickets, which 
they can control from within the ticket, as described below.
Access on a need-to-know basis
Besides the rigid option of Domain separation, you can customize ServiceNow 
to control access to tickets much more tightly, while also maintaining the flex-
ibility needed to collaborate with other teams and users.
Access on a need-to-know basis means that only the people that need the 
access are granted such access by those that already have it, and is regarded as 
one of the tightest security mechanisms, making it difficult to leak information 
and browsing of sensitive data.

studies/cs-ge-capital.pdf

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
152
This need-to-know access model can be implemented in ServiceNow by 
restricting access to tickets to only the people that need to collaborate on 
them and letting them extend it to others as they deem necessary on a ticket-
by-ticket basis. More precisely, there would be three levels of access to a ticket 
(see Figure 9-5):
	1.	 Read-only access to the ticket’s basic headers available to 
all ITIL users
	2.	 Full-access to the ticket granted only to members of the 
ticket’s assignment group or those listed in the work 
notes lists
	3.	 The caller and those listed in the ticket’s watch list can 
download and add file attachments, as well as participate 
in the customer-visible comments.
Ticket headers  
Visible to all ITIL users, caller, and all those 
listed in the watch list and work notes list.
 
File attachments and additional comments
 
Assignment group members, the caller, and 
all those in the watch list and watch notes 
list can view and participate.  
Internal work notes  
Only members of the assignment group 
and those added by them to the work 
notes list have full access to the entire 
ticket. 
Confidential Ticket  
Figure 9-5.  Different sections of the ticket are accessible to different groups of people
Put more simply, people in the assignment group of a ticket have full access 
to the ticket, and they can extend the same access to other people by adding 
them to the work notes list.

Adding people to the ticket’s watchlist enables them to participate in the user 
communication of the ticket without seeing the internal messages.
In this way, confidentiality is tightly but flexibly controlled for every ticket, 
providing maximum flexibility to extend access to all the people that need it 
to collaborate on the ticket.
Variations
When proposing the need-to-know confidentiality model, questions may be 
raised about what access the servicedesk has. They may claim that they need 
to know more about every ticket.
As described above, the servicedesk and every ITIL user can preview all of 
a ticket’s basic details so that they can report on the status of tickets to 
inquiring callers, reach the team to whom the ticket is assigned, or report to 
management.
Because of the specialized nature of tickets assigned to different teams, the 
servicedesk would rarely be able to support enquiring callers about the ticket, 
even if they had full access to the ticket. Otherwise, they would not have 
escalated the ticket to another team in the first place. So it is assumed that 
restricted access to the basic ticket headers is sufficient even for the central 
servicedesk.
At CERN5 they have also proposed an interesting twist to this model by 
allowing service desk and other people that do not have access to view the 
comments on a ticket. They can, however, add a comment to the ticket that 
they themselves will not be able to see after submitting.
This should enable the servicedesk, for example, to leave a message on a 
confidential ticket by another team, without being able to view what else has 
been said on the ticket.
Sister teams
If you examine the actual patterns of collaboration, you will find that cer-
tain teams always collaborate more amongst each other than with any other 
team. Those teams are usually within the same department and share com-
mon resources, for example, network and IT system teams working closely 
together on maintaining the back end IT infrastructure, or various ERP teams 
working together on HR and finance issues.

Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics, 2012

Call these collaborating teams “sister teams” as in sister companies. An exten-
sion to the need-to-know model that enables more collaboration between 
sister teams would grant members of sister teams not only access to all tick-
ets assigned to their team, but also to those assigned to their sister teams 
(Figure 9-6).

Confidential checkbox
So far the need-to-know model assumed confidentiality for all tickets. That is, 
every ticket in ServiceNow is elevated to confidential status and is by default 
only accessible to those that need to collaborate on the ticket. But if this is 
not necessary, you could also make confidentiality optional.
If tickets confidentiality is not so critical in your organization, you may make 
confidentiality optional with a checkbox in each ticket so that only when the 
checkbox is checked does the need-to-know confidential model apply.
When unchecked, the default access model in ServiceNow applies (that is, the 
ticket is public to all ITIL users).

Spinning Up ServiceNow

Confidential scenarios
Below is a walk-through of real-world example tickets that illustrate the 
dynamics of a confidential ticket.
Personal ERP issue
	1.	 Omayma, a member of staff, calls the servicedesk about 
an issue with her ERP details. She is forwarded to discuss 
the matter with the dedicated ERP support team.
	2.	 Dina, dedicated to ERP support, logs an incident for 
Omayma’s issue and assigns the ticket to the ERP HR 
team that specializes in such issues.
At this point, Omayma (the caller) receives a copy of 
her incident by email. Logging in, she can also see the 
user-visible side of the ticket, while the ERP HR team 
has full access of the ticket.
But, also, other sister ERP teams have access to the 
ticket, if it comes their way, while the Servicedesk and 
other ITIL teams can only see basic details about the 
ticket.
	3.	 Saud of the ERP HR team fixes the issue and notifies 
Omayma about the solution of her issue.
	4.	 Omayma receives the notification about her issue but, 
upon checking, she still has the issue and so she calls the 
Servicedesk again. The Servicedesk looks up her ticket 
and forwards her back to the ERP team.
	5.	 This time, Sara from the ERP team receives the call from 
the Servicedesk and, although she is not from the ERP HR 
team, she has access to the ticket since she belongs to an 
ERP team, the sister of ERP HR.
	6.	 Upon reviewing the issue with Omayma on the call and 
reviewing the feedback Saud left on the call, she attempts 
to troubleshoot the issue with Omayma on the phone. Lo 
and behold, they manage to fix the issue now.
	7.	 For future reference, Sara writes a note about the issue 
and solution in the ticket and Saud is notified.
In this scenario, the Servicedesk received the call and forwarded the call to 
the specialist section, which in turn solved the issue.

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
156
For new tickets received via email, the ticket will not be confidential until it 
is assigned to a group. If you want all tickets to be confidential from the start, 
you need to ensure that every new ticket is either automatically assigned to 
a specific team based on certain criteria (refer to Chapter 4 for email-based 
assignment), or that it’s by default assigned to a central Servicedesk team that 
then reroutes the ticket to the appropriate team.
Information security work
Consider a within-IT ticket opened for investigation by the Security team. The 
workflow would be something like this:
	1.	 Barbarossa, from the Internet Security team, identifies a 
potential threat and logs a ticket for it under his name. 
He sets himself as the caller and assigns the ticket to his 
team.
At this point, only his team has details of the ticket, 
while other ITIL users can merely find out that there 
is an open ticket logged for Security.
	2.	 After internal discussion, Security decides to request 
changes to the network firewall and apply a security 
patch to desktop computers.
So Barbarossa opens two new tickets (change requests), 
one for the network team and another for technical 
support citing “security concerns” as the motivation 
for the changes.
	3.	 When opening the tickets for the network team and for 
technical support, Barbarossa made sure to be added to 
the work notes of the ticket, and so gained full access to 
the tickets. He had access over all three tickets opened 
about the issue, while each team had default access only 
to their ticket.
Note how Security is not expected to reassign its tickets to other teams. It 
instead should request action from other teams in new, dedicated tickets, and 
disclose as little as necessary about potential threats or compromises.
Confidential vs. Out-of-box
Out of the Box in ServiceNow, all ITIL users have full access to all tickets. Here 
is how (Table 9-1) the need-to-know access model described above (without 
sister team or service desk twists) differs from the defaults in ServiceNow.

* It is important to note that once a valid ServiceNow user is for example forwarded an email chain 
about the ticket, they will be able to update the ticket by replying to the email even though they 
cannot do the same from the ticket. The same applies for ServiceNow Connect (see Chapter 10). 
With ServiceNow Connect you can do things to the ticket that you couldn’t through the standard web 
interface (e.g., add attachments).

Chapter 9 | Confidentiality
158
When changing your access control rules, it’s important that you also con-
sider how those rules apply, or can be circumvented, via email or ServiceNow 
Connect.
Arguments against confidentiality
As said before, the servicedesk may resent the limitations of confidentiality 
and request special access to all tickets. Other arguments may also be raised 
against confidentiality, such as those listed below.
“It’s unnatural and complicates things”
Access on a need-to-know basis is consistent with what teams are used to 
already. When receiving a user inquiry, teams normally discuss it internally 
with their email group only and don’t expect others to have access to the 
conversation, unless someone already with access shares it.
Further, with the reassurance that the information exchanged is only acces-
sible by the people you see listed in the ticket, people are more likely to 
engage in personalized and detailed conversations. This should lead to better 
outcomes.
“Confidentiality discourages collaboration”
It is very unlikely that a person from the Network team finds on his own 
accord a ticket from the ERP team in ServiceNow, and proposes a solution to 
it. Most collaboration happens between related sister teams and upon invita-
tion from those with access.
“It’s still possible to have a data breach”
Just like a trusted person with access could still leak emails to outsiders, so it 
can be with ServiceNow tickets. But at least ServiceNow will log who shared 
access with whom.
“When reassigning to another team, they can see all previous 
conversations”
When reassigning tickets, once-confidential communication is now shared 
with the new assignment group. In practice, however, it’s rare for a ticket to 
be reassigned to a group with whom the previous information needs to be 
hidden. When this is not desired, a new ticket should be opened with only the 
details necessary to share with the new team.

Tweet-ready takeaways
• 
Domain Separation in ServiceNow complicates things 
significantly and cements silos.
• 
Access on a need-to-know basis means that only the 
people that need the access are granted such access by 
those that already have it.
• 
You can use Access control rules in ServiceNow to 
implement a need-to-know access model to tickets that 
is both tight and flexible.
• 
Security shouldn’t reassign its tickets to other teams. It 
should request action in new dedicated tickets disclosing 
as little as necessary.

How to track internal collaboration in 
ServiceNow and reduce email traffic
From the first day that you introduce a service desk analyst to logging a ticket 
in ServiceNow, you will be asked about how to add entire email groups to 
receive updates on a ticket. In fact at Al Jazeera 47% of all emails received by 
ServiceNow in 2015 had at least another email address copied in other than 
the desk’s.
Email groups are a common artifact of collaboration in corporate environ-
ments with almost every team in the organization having an email group for its 
members. There are normally more email groups than sections in the official 
organizational chart.
When an issue gets reported it is very common for one or more email groups 
to be copied in the CC. How do you want ServiceNow to deal with those 
CC recipients?
This chapter addresses various internal collaboration issues that typically bub-
ble up only once ServiceNow is actively used in the organization. Read outside 
that context, some of the discussed issues and proposed solutions may seem 
unnecessarily complicated.

Chapter 10 | Fluid collaboration
162
We will consider both conventional solutions implemented by many ServiceNow 
customers as well as ServiceNow Connect, a new instant messaging interface 
that posts directly to the ticket and uses push notifications for alerts.
We will not be talking about Visual task boards as those offer a solution for 
collaboration at the queue level, while the collaboration discussed in this 
chapter is at the single ticket level.
In this chapter:
	1.	 Groups in the CC: Copying email groups in the CC is a 
long-held corporate tradition. I tried and failed to undo it.
	2.	 Customer-visible vs. internal: Not all messages about 
a ticket should go to the caller; what about back-end 
collaboration?
	3.	 ServiceNow Connect: ServiceNow’s Slack-like alterna-
tive to email.
	4.	 Tracked emails: Email groups and the CC can work with 
ServiceNow.
Back story
When we launched ServiceNow at Al Jazeera I tried to counter the common 
tendency to copy entire groups in the CC reasoning that we should reduce 
the number of “For Your Information” (FYI) emails and that anyone interested 
could be individually subscribed to follow up on the ticket.
I had a perfect rationale (I felt) but in the end I observed that rather than 
change their workflow by not copying in groups, people would just not open a 
ticket and send their request by email with all the groups they want in the CC.
In other instances those that used ServiceNow tickets kept complaining about 
the limitation of not being able to look up and add groups and it became a 
sore issue with ServiceNow.
I realized that it basically was not up to me to tell if people should copy a 
whole email group or not, so in the end we gave them what they wanted in 
ServiceNow.
Another issue hindering behind-the-curtain collaboration in ServiceNow was 
that ServiceNow by default does not send email notifications for work notes 
added to an incident ticket; it only sends notifications for the communication 
with the caller.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
163
So unless you are using ServiceNow Connect and, if you want to notify 
another colleague about a ticket (asking a question perhaps) you could not 
rely on ServiceNow for it because it would not trigger any notification. Your 
colleague would see the work note only if she for some reason opened the 
ticket and read the work note there.
User vs. internal communication
The resolution of many tickets requires more than just communication with 
the caller. There will be internal approvals, consultations with tier 3 and ven-
dors, reassignments from team to team, or hand-over notes between one shift 
and another. How do you keep track of it all?
ServiceNow incident tickets come built-in with a thread to track messages 
with the customer in a journal field called Additional comments as show in 
Figure 10-1. This comments thread works in a predictable fashion: every com-
ment that is added is recorded in the ticket and a notification is sent to the 
caller of the ticket, the assignee, and other people and emails listed in the 
ticket’s watch list. You do not receive an email notification for comments that 
you add.
Figure 10-1. Watch list and Additional comments are for messages with the customer
Incident tickets also have a parallel thread for tracking work notes. Work 
notes are like comments but can only be viewed by users that have the ITIL 
role (so supposedly internal folks) but ServiceNow does not send out any 
notification for Work notes.
There is also a Work notes list in every Incident ticket but unlike the Watch 
list for comments there is no feature associated with it out of the box. It’s left 
to you to decide what to do with it.
You can also mark the distinction between messages exchanged with the cus-
tomer and internal ones more obviously by putting the related fields for each 
on a separate tab as shown in Figure 10-2.

Chapter 10 | Fluid collaboration
164
Internal attachments
Sometimes internal conversations also involve internal attachments (such as 
detailed error logs) that would be irrelevant to the customer. So it may be 
requested to separate between user-visible attachments and internal ones.
This is however not supported in ServiceNow as there is only one attachments  
table, with attachments visible by default to everyone who has access to the 
ticket. Rather than twist this I recommended users to come up with creative 
workarounds such as:
	1.	 Use descriptive file names so it’s easy for everyone with 
access to the ticket to tell if the file interests them.
	2.	 Create a child ticket for internal use and put the files you 
want there.
	3.	 If the files are confidential, store the file elsewhere and 
provide a link to it in the work notes.
It should also be noted that the issue is limited to Incident tickets. In Service 
catalog requests the customer will have access to the Request and Requested 
item records, while support teams will have Catalog tasks assigned in which 
they can store their attachments separately from end users.
ServiceNow Connect
ServiceNow introduced a new option for collaborating on tickets dubbed 
Connect. ServiceNow Connect provides users with a chat-like interface 
with which they can update the work notes and comments of tickets (see 
Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-2.  Internal and user-facing communication threads can be seperated in a tab each

Spinning Up ServiceNow
165
Unlike the earlier legacy chat module in ServiceNow, Connect posts chat 
messages directly as full-fledged work notes (or customer-visible comments) 
on the ticket. It is exactly the same as if you updated the ticket through the 
regular ticket interface.
Together with a variety of in-app, desktop, and email notifications for ticket 
updates, Connect presents an interesting option for internal collaboration on 
tickets.
When there are new messages, the Connect Sidebar icon displays a balloon 
indicating the number of new messages received on tickets you are follow-
ing. Expanding the Connect Sidebar (see Figure 10-4) you can preview those 
messages and reply through the chat interface or go to the updated record.
Figure 10-3.  ServiceNow Connect offers a chat-like experience for updating tickets

Chapter 10 | Fluid collaboration
166
If a work note is posted on a message while you are away ServiceNow will 
alert you with an email such the one shown in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-4.  ServiceNow Connect sidebar is built into the ServiceNow application header
Figure 10-5.  Email notification sent about messages received while you were not logged in 
to ServiceNow
Since users using a chat interface tend to write multiple shorter messages as 
opposed to one big update, the email notifications sent from Connect lump 
together a few minutes’ worth of updates into one email instead of sending a 
notification for each message.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
167
Connect notifications can also be pushed to users on a desktop computer 
through modern browsers support, and on the ServiceNow mobile app.
With the above features, ServiceNow Connect offers a viable and well-integrated 
option for internal collaboration on tickets and you may seriously consider it to 
reduce your organization’s reliance on email.
Replacing email with ServiceNow Connect
While ServiceNow Connect is well-integrated with tickets and features a 
modern instant messaging interface end users and senior executives at your 
organization may not be interested in participating in such a communication 
channel.
Requiring everyone to log in to ServiceNow and use Connect to catch up on 
ticket updates and update them may not be acceptable.
As a softer start you may use ServiceNow Connect as your primary col-
laboration mechanism internally, bypassing the need to configure the work 
notes list in incident tickets and using Connect ticket conversations instead. 
Once your internal team is comfortable and accustomed to collaboration on 
Connect you may also introduce it for end users, replacing the default email 
notifications with those from Connect.
Connect also lets you control how long to wait before it sends an email noti-
fication for new messages added while the user was offline. You can gradu-
ally increase this time period to reduce the volume of emails triggered from 
ServiceNow.
Addressing Connect limitations
The default configuration of ServiceNow Connect may not be ready for 
enterprise-grade collaboration. Fortunately, most limitations can be address 
as discussed below:
Following a ticket
The ServiceNow Connect interface is still not the default in ServiceNow.
When a user assigns a ticket to himself, he is by default subscribed to receive 
comment updates to the ticket via email. But he will not receive Connect alerts  
because he would first need to click on the Follow button (see Figure 10-6).

Chapter 10 | Fluid collaboration
168
If you are assigning the ticket to someone else as is so often the case, you cannot 
add that someone to receive Connect notifications, you have to follow the ticket 
yourself first. Then you can in Connect choose to add the people you want.
This may change in the future if Connect is adopted as the primary collabora-
tion mechanism in ServiceNow.
Replies to Connect email notifications
Email replies to ServiceNow Connect email notifications create new incidents 
instead of updating the work notes.
You can however change this so that email replies are treated as work note 
updates. If you, set the Connect email notifications with the “INTERNAL:” 
prefix in the subject then email replies that contain it also will update the 
ticket for which the email has been triggered.
Groups and outsiders participation
The Connect interface only allows adding individuals with a user profile in 
ServiceNow; you cannot add external email addresses or entire groups.
Since Connect messages are integrated and posted as work notes you can 
have groups and external people participate in the conversation by adding 
them to the Work notes list or the Groups work notes list.
This way people already with access to Connect can participate via Connect, 
while entire groups and external collaborators can also chip in via internal 
email notifications. Because Connect messages are posted as work note, the 
communication should flow seamlessly amongst all users.
Figure 10-6. To receive a ticket’s update on Connect you need to follow it first

Spinning Up ServiceNow
169
Other options
Even if you are going to use ServiceNow Connect you will still not be able 
to collaborate from ServiceNow with email groups or external vendors and 
email addresses.
For this you can implement the below described solutions either as an alter-
native to Connect altogether, or as complements.
Internal emails
When a ticket is assigned to you, you get an email notification of the assign-
ment. What happens if you reply to this email questioning the assignment? 
Where will the reply go? To the caller of the incident!
You can however set it so that email replies to the assignment notifications 
are posted to the internal work notes instead, or set them to go to the assign-
ment group’s email address to keep things private.
More generally, you can configure an internal notification to be sent to the 
Work notes list subscribers whenever a new work note is posted, just like 
it is for comments and Watch list subscribers. This is a widely implemented 
solution in the ServiceNow community and is often featured in user manuals.1
For this to work smoothly and keep internal email replies from being posted 
to the customer, you need two things:
	1.	 Prefix the subject line of your internal email notifica-
tions with recognizable prefixes such as “ASSIGNED 
TO YOU:” and prefix the email notification triggered to 
notify of new work notes with “INTERNAL:”.
	2.	 Configure ServiceNow to post to the Work notes any 
email reply that contains one of those internal prefixes.
So all email replies that contain “ASSIGNED TO YOU:”, “UNASSIGNED:”, 
“SLA DUE:”, or “INTERNAL:” in the subject line should be posted as a Work 
note. All other email replies can continue to be posted as comments, as is by 
default.
In this way, your internal users and vendors can have their own email threads 
going on and automatically recorded in the work notes, while all other email 
replies that don’t match the internal prefixes above continue to be posted as 
comments.

Copied in the CC
With the feature of automatically creating incidents from incoming emails 
some users expect that those they copy in the CC are added to the ticket’s 
watch list automatically.
I personally resent this feature and as mentioned in Chapter 5 it can exacerbate 
the distribution of spam.2
Service desk stakeholders may however, argue that it speeds up tickets reso-
lution by putting in the loop everyone involved from the beginning and that 
they otherwise would still have to add the people copied in emails but one by 
one manually.
When emailing the service desk with an issue that affects the entire team or a 
particular system, it is common for the caller to copy in the email a few extra 
people. The copied people tend to be:
• 
the caller’s own team, so that they are also aware of the 
issue and don’t report the same issue separately;
• 
the next person on shift, when the reporter of the inci-
dent expects to leave the shift before the resolution;
• 
the caller’s line manager; this may be to leverage the 
political influence of the manager, to get her approval, or 
simply because the manager wants to stay tuned.
Apparently acknowledging this common feature request, ServiceNow’s official 
wiki offers a useful script3 for automatically adding email addresses copied 
into the CC of incoming emails to the watch list.
Groups watchlists
Just like you have watchlists for subscribing individuals to a ticket’s updates 
you can have group watch lists to subscribe entire groups at once.
To be useful however the groups need to be in ServiceNow already and unless 
you are synching user groups with your directory server (see Chapter 3) this 
is unlikely to be the case.
Having a dedicated watch list for groups may also be useful for other reasons, 
as it allows ServiceNow to identify groups as more than just an email address, 
and know the members of the added groups. You could for example use 
group watch lists to control confidential access to tickets (see Chapter 9) at 
a group level.

Over 40 examples of ServiceNow customizations
This book focused on key aspects of ServiceNow as an enterprise collabora-
tion tool considering it a real achievement if you managed for ServiceNow to 
blend in the daily collaboration routines of your organization. For this, Part II 
shed light on smooth and professional-looking communication with end users, 
while in Part III we also looked at internal collaboration behind the curtain 
and data confidentiality.
For your inspiration, this chapter will also give you a brief overview of over 40 
customizations that may be relevant for your organization as well.
The customizations mentioned here are by no means exhaustive of what you 
may actually need in your organization as each is highly dependent on circum-
stances. Some customizations may even add unnecessary complication!
Unlike the recommendations discussed in earlier chapters, do not take any 
of the customizations briefly discussed here as a recommendation that you 
also implement it in your instance. Quite the opposite, only if the dynamics 
of your organization inevitably require you to make changes similar to those 
described here then consider this as a possible tried-and-tested solution.
Most of the screenshots and examples given refer to Incident tickets as Incident 
management is normally the first ITIL process implemented in ServiceNow 
and incidents end up being the most frequently used ticket type. Many of 
the customizations however can also been made to other ticket types such 
as Catalog tasks, Change Requests, and Problem tickets, with the required 
adaptations.

For context, some features discussed in earlier chapters will also be repeated 
here with a brief description and a reference to the chapter in which it was 
fully discussed. Without further ado, let’s get into it!
Search in ServiceNow
You may find the default search behavior in ServiceNow somewhat difficult; 
Here are a few customizations to lift the default limitations on search and 
make search easy again:
1. Contains search by default
One thing you will inevitably notice your ServiceNow administrator do 
when searching for something in ServiceNow is to type a * before the search 
keyword.
This is because ServiceNow will only search for records that start with your 
keywords but if you put a * in front of your search keyword, it will look for all 
records that contain the keyword, be it at the start, middle, or end. You can 
make the default search mode to be contains search so there is no need to 
type * as shown in Figure 11-1.
Figure 11-1.  It is easier to fill forms in ServiceNow with contains search.
2. Personalized global search
The global search box in the top-right corner of every ServiceNow page 
(Figure 11-2) offers the quickest way to look things up in ServiceNow. But it 
shows search results from all the tickets in the instance, which if you are in a 
large organization, can be hundreds of thousands.
Most of the time however, you are looking for a ticket that you opened or for 
a ticket a colleague in your team referred you to, and are not interested in 
tickets logged on the other end of the world. So you will have to dig deeper 
and modify the search query to find what you were looking for.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
175
You could however customize the default search results to be prefiltered for 
tickets assigned or opened by your team (Figure 11-3). That way, by default 
you get what you want most of the time from the first time you search, while 
for less frequent searches you can modify the search filters.
Figure 11-2. The global search box in the top-right corner searches all records in 
ServiceNow.
Figure 11-3. The default filters for global search can be made more local or personalized.
Note, if you have implemented a tickets confidentiality solution (Chapter 9) 
in such a way that other teams cannot even see the presence of confidential 
tickets, then you may not need to add filters because ServiceNow will then by 
default not show you tickets that you do not have access to.
3. Color-coded ticket numbers
The state of a ticket is essentially one of three: Open, on hold, or closed.
To quickly identify the state of a ticket in a list without reading the state 
field, you can color-code the background of the number field with a color to 
denote each state (Figure 11-4).

Chapter 11 | Examples
176
4. Look up callers by staff ID
When receiving a phone call, the Servicedesk can ask callers for their staff 
ID and use it to immediately look them up directly in a new incident record 
(Figure 11-5). Once the caller is identified, the agent can preview recent tickets 
for the caller in ServiceNow or continue logging a new incident ticket.
Figure 11-4.  Green background color for the number field of a closed ticket, and amber for 
a ticket on hold.
Figure 11-5. Asking callers for their staff ID is often much easier than spelling their full name.
Contextual help, dates and usability
Chapter 8 emphasized the importance of usability and convenience changes to 
encourage desirable behavior and increase user satisfaction, but also encourage 
usage of the system in the first place. Here are some usability tips.
5. Info messages with hyperlink
Once a ticket is updated in ServiceNow it can take a few steps to get back 
to it again!
For practical convenience, whenever a ticket is submitted or updated you 
could show an overhead info message confirming the change that just took 
place and providing a hyperlink back to the ticket (Figure 11-6).
A transparent background could mean that the ticket is open (either new or 
work in progress), amber that it is on hold, and green that it has been resolved 
(or closed).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
177
Such conveniences can be very useful for first-time users as well as advanced 
users operating under pressure.
6. International date format
Dates in ServiceNow are used to report on when a ticket was opened, last 
updated, or closed. Dates are also used in the Due date field if you set a dead-
line for a Task or Project.
ServiceNow allows each user to set their date format but as you can imagine 
most users will simply not do it. If you have users across the world, each will 
be used to a date format that is confusing to the other (dd-mm-yyyy in Europe 
and Asia and mm-dd-yyyy in America).
To elegantly circumvent this issue I recommend you set the default date for-
mat to the dd-mmm-yy format which is unequivocal on both sides of the 
Atlantic (Figure 11-7).
Figure 11-6.  Information messages with hyperlinks that can take you back to the ticket or 
that you can use to copy the hyperlink to the ticket.
Figure 11-7. A ServiceNow opened field with the date in the dd-mmm-yy date format.
7. Rounded-up time fields
When scheduling the planned start and end dates of a change, you can go 
granular by the minute or round up to the earliest and latest 5-minutes interval 
as shown in Figure 11-8.
All changes’ scheduled durations will be in multiples of 5 minutes which will 
be easier to remember and will fit more nicely in calendars. This is especially 
so if you display change requests on a shared global calendar.

Chapter 11 | Examples
178
8. Outlook global changes calendar
If you find ServiceNow’s built-in Global changes calendar a bit clunky and 
you have your own Calendaring system (e.g., Outlook) you may create a sub-
scribeable public calendar in Outlook that will show in real-time all scheduled 
Change requests in Outlook as shown in Figure 11-9.
Figure 11-8.  Planned end date is conveniently rounded up so that the change duration is a 
multiple of 5 minutes.
Figure 11-9.  Shared calendar in Outlook showing all changes planned in ServiceNow.
ServiceNow by default sends out calendar invites for Change requests to the 
person to whom the Change is assigned to. You can set it to also send the 
invite to your public calendar so that the changes are immediately visible on 
the shared calendar as well.
9. Read-only open details
By default, ServiceNow automatically sets the fields that capture who opened 
the ticket and the time when it was opened. Those fields are set as read-only 
so that they cannot be changed.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
179
Some teams will argue that they need to log tickets with back dates, for exam-
ple setting the opened date to when exactly the incident was experienced 
instead of when the incident ticket was logged. But if you enable ITIL users to 
set the opened date be ready to find tickets logged with future dates, unless 
you customize that the date cannot be set past the current time.
Also, the Caller field in ServiceNow is by default changeable by both ITIL 
users and the caller itself do you want to keep it this way?
10. Related records header
When setting the caller for a new Incident record, ServiceNow also allows 
the Servicedesk agent to quickly preview recent tickets for the caller to know 
if there is already a ticket for the caller’s issue or if she had the same issue 
recently.
But the way the caller tickets are shown and the urgency on the phone may 
make it somewhat difficult to look through those recent tickets. You can  
customize what is shown as you deem suitable for example see the table 
header in Figure 11-10.
Figure 11-10. Adding the Comments and work notes field to the list view allows you to 
hover over the field and quickly preview the latest messages on the ticket.
Ticket state, priority and SLA
Chapter 5 on sending email notification described different templates for 
emails to send based on the ticket’s state and the action required from the 
recipient, while Chapter 4 outlined how to deal with incoming emails, including 
email replies to ServiceNow notifications.
You may also customize the ServiceNow ticket front end to better control 
ticket state transitions, SLAs, and the setting of a ticket’s priority as follows.

Chapter 11 | Examples
180
11. Buttons to change ticket state
A ticket’s state is by default controlled through a drop-down field which ITIL 
users are expected to set as they update tickets. But there is also a Resolve 
button, which sets the ticket state to Resolved straightaway.
What will often happen however is that when updating a ticket many users 
may neglect setting the ticket state, for example, not changing it to or from 
On hold, although this is important for the calculations of the SLA and for the 
notification sent to the caller (see Chapter 5).
Just like with the Resolve button, you can have a Hold button that when 
clicked will save the ticket in the On hold status (Figure 11-11). If the button 
is clicked without writing a Comment to the caller you may also prompt the 
user to first type an explanation to the caller.
Figure 11-11.  By clicking the Hold button the ticket will be saved in the On hold state.
Figure 11-12.  Unhold updates the ticket and resets the state to Work in progress. Hold 
updates the ticket but keeps it on hold.
Once a ticket is already On hold, to update the ticket you should hide the 
Update button and instead require the user to make an explicit choice of how 
to update the ticket (Figure 11-12):
• 
Unhold: Updates the ticket and resets the ticket state to 
Work in progress. SLA clocks may resume.
• 
Hold: Updates the ticket as still pending caller input.  
A message will be sent to the caller with the update, 
soliciting urgent update.
• 
Resolve: Updates the ticket as resolved.
What if you want to cancel a ticket?
You could select the Cancel state and right-click on the ticket header and click 
on Save. Like Update, Save does not affect the state.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
181
But you could also eliminate the need to fiddle with the state field and 
introduce a Cancel right-click menu item as shown below in Figure 11-13.
Figure 11-13. The context menu accessible by right-clicking a ticket header provides 
additional options to operate on a ticket.
12. Un-hold tickets automatically
When a ticket is put on hold it makes sense for the SLA to also be paused 
while awaiting customer updates.
But as soon as a new comment is received on the ticket via email or through 
the self-service portal the ticket should automatically be put back in the Work 
in progress state and the SLA clock should resume. Otherwise would defeat 
the purpose of the SLA.
13. Close on-hold tickets
It happens that sometimes tickets put On hold are ignored by the caller and 
never receive an update again. For this, you can set up ServiceNow to auto-
matically close tickets on hold that have not received an update in more than 
seven days (or any number of days you deem appropriate).
If you introduce this behavior, remember to make it obvious to the users. 
When viewing a ticket currently on hold, show an information bar message 
informing that the ticket is on hold and after how many more days will it be 
automatically closed (Figure 11-14).
Figure 11-14.  Notice shown when viewing on-hold tickets, informing that the ticket will 
soon be automatically closed if not updated.

Chapter 11 | Examples
182
14. Replies to closed tickets
By default, email replies to a closed ticket do not reopen it and thus don’t 
restart the SLA.
To make sure the replies do not go unnoticed you can list those tickets in 
a special list on the home page of your Servicedesk who will then decide 
whether to re-open the tickets or just note the provided feedback. For details 
about handling email replies to closed ticket notifications, see Chapter 4.
15. Re-opened incidents
What should happen when a ticket is intentionally re-opened by the caller? 
You may set tickets to be automatically re-assigned to the Servicedesk team 
to troubleshoot.
If the ticket was previously assigned to a person in another team chances are 
that she may not be available on shift to pick up the ticket again, and so the 
ticket may unnecessarily go neglected for a while. How you configure the  
re-open workflow depends on the nature of your support organization and 
the urgency of tickets.
16. Priority and SLA setting
By default in ServiceNow users do not set a ticket’s priority directly but 
the priority is computed based on low-medium-high settings of Impact and 
Urgency fields, while the caller can set the Urgency of the ticket.
At Al Jazeera we have tied SLAs to the ticket’s priority and also made it more 
straightforward to set the priority. The default priority of a received incident 
via email or self-service is Medium (P2) with an SLA of 10 hours as shown 
below in Figure 11-15.
ITIL users can freely change the priority of the ticket but to do so they also 
need to write an internal work note in the ticket explaining their reasoning. 
Also, callers are not given information about the ticket priority or urgency.
Figure 11-15. You can make it mandatory for ITIL users to explicitly set the ticket’s priority 
when logging the ticket.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
183
17. SLA reminders gauge
ServiceNow comes pre-configured to send two email notifications for SLAs:
	1.	 One email is sent to the assignee of the ticket to warn 
when the SLA on the ticket is about to breach.
	2.	 If the SLA is breached however, the notification is sent to 
the manager of the assignee.
And if the ticket is not assigned to anyone, no email notification is sent out.
Especially at the beginning, users and management will be excited about those 
notifications and may require the configuration of more SLA alerts (e.g., alert 
when the ticket SLA reaches 50%), send an email notification to the whole 
team, etc.
In addition or alternatively to SLA notifications you can create a home page 
gauge that shows the number of open tickets with active SLAs due to breach 
within 10 hours or already breached.
As shown in Figure 11-16 this will give the team a lot more visibility about 
tickets before they breach and hopefully enable them to re-negotiate priori-
ties and eventually meet more SLAs.
Figure 11-16.  Dial to monitor the number of team tickets with running  
SLAs soon to breach.
Figure 11-17.  Clicking on the SLA gauge you can drill into the tickets.
As with other ServiceNow gauges clicking on the gauge will list for you the 
tickets in question as shown in Figure 11-17 so you can drill in and take action.

Chapter 11 | Examples
184
Alternatively you could show an SLA progress bar as in Figure 11-18.
Figure 11-18.  SLA progress bar
There is also a home page in ServiceNow dedicated to SLA reports (shown 
in Figure 11-19) if you want to get a more detailed view of the SLAs for your 
teams as well as all other SLAs tracked in the instance.
Figure 11-19.  Out-of-box home page dedicated to SLAs.
Assignment, participation and hand-over notes
It’s possible to automate the assignment of tickets in ServiceNow based on 
the caller of the Incident, the location, or the email address that it was sent to.
Here is how it works, together with other customizations meant to encour-
age internal collaboration best practices.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
185
18. Assignment based on email address or location
You can automatically route incoming emails directly to certain assignment 
groups based on the email address that they were sent to.
But if the support request was sent to the generic support email address, you 
could assign the ticket based on the sender’s location.
The workflow to assign an incoming new incident could be the following:
• 
If the incident ticket was auto-created from email then 
assign the ticket to the team registered to be assigned 
tickets sent to the addressed email, if any.
• 
If the location of the user is known or another location 
for the incident has been set then the ticket is automati-
cally assigned to the team registered to be assigned tick-
ets for that location.
• 
If the ticket could not be assigned to any group it should 
be assigned to a specific team you set as a catchall fallback 
option.
For more on setting user locations based on their OU in Active Directory, 
refer to Chapter 3.
19. Assignment based on Configuration item
Since ServiceNow is not just for the Servicedesk many tickets ought to be 
assigned to other teams.
One mechanism to determine to whom the ticket should be assigned is by 
setting the Support group field in Configuration items (CIs).
Based on the selected Configuration item of the ticket the Assignment group 
is automatically populated with the Support group of the selected CI, if any is 
set (see Figure 11-20).
Figure 11-20. The assignment group can be automatically set based on the Configuration 
Item selected.

Chapter 11 | Examples
186
20. Discard unregistered emails
Because it is easy to redirect emails to your ServiceNow instance some teams 
may set up automated redirects to ServiceNow without agreeing on who 
should handle those income tickets and how they should be handled. Many of 
those may even be automated alerts from systems that they manage.
Our ServiceNow instance at Al Jazeera regularly receives tons of internal 
emails such as these.
By default ServiceNow would process any incoming email and since unrelated 
to any existing ticket, open a new ticket for each new email. This will flood the 
Servicedesk who puzzled and frustrated will not know what to do with the 
incoming alerts or who to assign them to.
You can avoid this problem by requiring that ServiceNow only process emails 
sent to recipients it is configured to receive emails from and for which you 
have configured an assignment group.
This way, even when someone redirects alerts to be automatically sent to 
ServiceNow nothing will happen on the tickets side until you explicitly config-
ure ServiceNow to accept those emails and auto- assign them to a particular 
team.
21. Re-assignment pop-up
When tickets are assigned between teams or even team members, teams and 
people on the receiving end of the ticket may be confused as to why the ticket 
has been dumped onto them and may re-assign it back or ignore it for a while.
Especially when tickets are escalated to tier 3 teams, the receiver will want to 
see that the Servicedesk agent assigning a ticket made an effort to trouble-
shoot the issue first and collected some basic details that will help in the 
resolution (steps to reproduce, screenshots, MAC address, etc.).
In order to encourage such hand-over notes when reassigning a ticket, you 
can show a pop-up (Figure 11-21) every time a ticket is set to be reassigned 
and no internal work note has been typed.
At this point the agent will be reminded about the importance of leaving a 
note or two to the receiving colleagues.
Typing a work note does not need to be mandatory as it may sometimes be 
obvious why the ticket is being assigned. The pop-up as a reminder should be 
enough and conducive to good practice.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
187
22. Closing unassigned tickets
It can happen that for one reason or another, many tickets are closed without 
a name set in the Assigned to field.
If you want to report on the number of tickets assigned to each team member, 
you can make the Assigned to field mandatory when closing the ticket or just 
show a pop-up prompting the ITIL user closing the ticket to set the Assigned 
to field, as shown in Figure 11-22.
Figure 11-21.  Pop-up shown when a ticket is re-assigned to another person or team 
without leaving a work note.
Figure 11-22.  Pop-up prompt shown to ITIL users closing a ticket that is  
not assigned to anyone.
23. Track participation
When you first introduce ServiceNow in your organization people will won-
der which metrics will be used to measure teams’ and individuals’ perfor-
mance. Should management report on the number of tickets assigned to 
individuals and teams, the number of tickets closed, opened, or what?
Some teams may also not be used to the concept of assigning ownership for 
the ticket to an individual person and may ask about the ability to count the 
participation of more than one person in a ticket.
In Private tasks created from the Visual task board ServiceNow now offers the 
ability to set additional assignees (Figure 11-23). You may customize and intro-
duce similar behavior to incident tickets or keep it to one primary assignee per 
ticket and instead track participations from others as described below.

Chapter 11 | Examples
188
You may introduce a participation metric that keeps track of the number of 
tickets that an individual participated in. So in addition to the standard report-
ing metrics you can also report on tickets the user was not assigned to but 
collaborated in.
How you define participation depends on your circumstance. At Al Jazeera 
we consider someone to have participated in a ticket if they have left a work 
note or comment in the ticket, encouraging communication and making sure 
the contribution is actually felt and received by those working on the ticket.
Figure 11-23.  In Private tasks ServiceNow introduced the concept of Additional assignees.
24. Assignment group based on Assigned to
ServiceNow allows you to assign tickets directly to a particular person without 
assigning the ticket to a group (Figure 11-24). This may not fit the process by 
which other teams handle their collective workloads and may lead to disputes 
or to some tickets simply going unnoticed for a while.
If this is an issue for you, make setting the Assignment group mandatory once 
the Assigned to is set.
More conveniently, you can have the Assignment group of the ticket be 
automatically populated with the assignee’s primary group (see Primary 
Group feature below, under Users and LDAP settings).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
189
25. Parent assignment groups
If you have a lot of teams in ServiceNow, chances are that you will intro-
duce some hierarchy to nest related groups (Figure 11-25). This will help new 
Servicedesk agents navigate through groups based on some logical grouping 
of teams (e.g., by location, or by function).
The problem with nested groups is that tickets could now be assigned to par-
ent groups, and go unnoticed for a while because all teams are focused on the 
tickets assigned to their team and have enough.
Ideally, they would consider the parent group their team and also pick up tick-
ets from there, but if that is impractical you could have ServiceNow forbid the 
assignment to parent groups. So tickets could only be assigned to child groups 
but not their parents.
Figure 11-24. Tickets in ServiceNow can be assigned to an individual without also assigning 
it to the group that she belongs to.
Figure 11-25.  Related teams can be nested under Container groups for ease of navigation.
Also refer to Chapter 3 for granting consistent access rights through parent 
groups so that access rights automatically cascade to the groups under them.

Chapter 11 | Examples

26. User communication and internal tabs
As discussed in Chapter 11, for every ticket ServiceNow tracks two commu-
nication threads: One for the messages exchanged with the end user, and one 
for those exchanged internally between resolver teams and perhaps vendors.
For compactness ServiceNow has recently combined the two threads and 
text boxes into one single text box and added a checkbox to determine if 
what you type should be posted as a comment or as an internal work note.
If users find this confusing and start mixing up messages by posting internal 
notes to end users, you can split the two threads into two separate tabs as 
shown below in Figure 11-26.
Figure 11-26.  Separating the Comments user communication thread from the internal 
Work notes thread into two distinct tabs.
26. Vendor ticket number
Some issues require consultation with external vendors and partners such as 
with ServiceNow HI.
As in the case with getting support from ServiceNow if you cannot get ven-
dors to use your instance you may still need a way to indicate that the ticket 
in your instance is related to a ticket somewhere else. This is to be used for 
hand-over or future reference.
You could invite people to simply note vendor ticket numbers in the work notes, 
or add a Vendor ticket number field dedicated to storing such information.
For letting some suppliers and partners collaborate on tickets directly in your 
instance, see Chapter 3 for vendors access and Chapter 9 for controlling 
tickets confidentiality.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
191
Users and LDAP settings
Chapter 3 described how to import users into ServiceNow from your directory 
servers, optimize availability, tighten security, and manage access. Here are a 
few more situation-specific customizations that you may also find relevant:
27. Primary group
In the assignment section earlier, I described how you can have the assignment 
group of a ticket automatically populated once the Assigned to field is set 
based on the assignee’s primary group.
For this to work, you need to add a Primary group field to each user profile 
in ServiceNow and have it automatically default to the smallest group the 
person is a member of, or set manually from the user profile.
When collecting approvals, you could take the group manager of the Primary 
group of the user to be the section head.
Finally, some ITIL users may be part of several teams that they work with, or 
supervise, on different days and may require seeing only a team’s particular 
tickets queue on particular days.
You could build custom home pages for them, or have a home page that 
shows your primary group’s tickets. With the latter, they can change their 
primary group and only see the tickets for the group they want.
28. Functional accounts
When we first went live with ServiceNow we had set up the Active Directory 
integration to sync user profiles with the Users OU in Active Directory.
Where all your user profiles reside in your directory depends on your spe-
cific setup but you may need to log tickets for functional accounts such as 
legal@your-company.com. These groups may be in a separate OU from 
your main users.
29. Email required for sync
In a dynamic organization user profiles may be in flux with new freelancers 
joining and leaving, and changing profile details. Your directory may also store 
temporary or phantom accounts used for testing or other purposes.

Chapter 11 | Examples
192
To ensure your users’ details in ServiceNow are as clean as possible I recom-
mend that you only import user profiles that have a registered email address, 
assuming every staff member has an email address. Otherwise if you log a 
ticket for callers that have no email address associated, they are not going to 
receive any email notifications about their ticket.
30. Unique user attributes
To ensure duplicate accounts are not created in ServiceNow or that ticket 
updates are sent to the wrong person, ensure that no two users have the 
same:
Full name (a.k.a. display name)
Email address
User ID
Staff ID
For uniquely identifying users and matching them between your directory 
servers and ServiceNow, it would be better if you rely on an immutable ID 
provided by your directory server for each user profile.
Microsoft’s Active Directory assigns each user a unique identifier called 
ObjectSID (and there is also another globally unique identifier called object-
GUID). Never changing, this field is the best to identify and sync users.
31. Location in tickets
Every ServiceNow ticket has a location field that is by default hidden from the 
incident form.
If your callers report incidents from different locations, or location is an 
important attribute of how you deal and route incidents then show the 
location field in incident forms, as in Figure 11-27.
Locations can be imported from your organization’s directory servers 
together with user or department details. You can also define or add locations 
in ServiceNow.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
193
32. Delete role
In ServiceNow access to delete records is constrained to those with the ITIL-
admin role while to delete Assets you need the SAM access role.
You may however further restrict the deletion of records only allowing admins 
to do so, or those with a new CanDelete access role that you selectively grant 
to certain people only.
33. Access to add vendors
As with access to delete records, in ServiceNow people with the user_admin 
role can add, modify, or delete users or companies’ records.
You may also want to have a new special role that only allows managing com-
panies’ records (used for tracking contracts and assets by vendors) but not 
users. This could then be safely used by your contracts administrators and 
asset custodians.
34. User details in preview window
For every Incident caller ServiceNow provides a convenience preview win-
dow to quickly see more details about the Caller (Figure 11-28).
Imagine the Servicedesk agent listening to the caller on the phone and glanc-
ing over the preview window on the screen and pick what user details you 
imagine she will want see in the preview window (the more fields you put, the 
more likely that she will not see them).
Figure 11-27. The default incident form in ServiceNow does not show a location field. But if 
you add the Location field, ServiceNow will conveniently prepopulate it for you based on the 
caller’s location (if known).

Chapter 11 | Examples
194
The details you set to show in the preview window will be the same shown 
also in Request tickets for the Requester and wherever else user details are 
looked up.
If ServiceNow system administrators (or user_admins) occasionally need to 
see other fields as well such as those related to the LDAP integration then add 
those to the view but with security constraints that make them visible only 
to users with the admin or user_admin role. For more details about access 
roles see Chapter 3.
Request fulfillment
Chapter 6 talked about the end-to-end process of ordering something on 
ServiceNow. Here are some complementary customizations to help your ful-
filler teams fulfill the incoming requests.
35. Request form and communication
When the Servicedesk (or another fulfillment team) is assigned a Catalog task 
they will see whom the request is for and the short description of the Task 
(Figure 11-29).
Figure 11-28. You can choose which user details are shown in the Caller preview window 
of Incident tickets.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
195
In order to view more details about what is requested, one would have to 
abandon the task and navigate to the Requested item (RITM) record. There 
you can see the form as it was submitted. The same goes for viewing the com-
ments exchanged with the requester; You would have to navigate to the RITM 
or the Request (REQ) record.
Alternatively you could make those directly visible in the Catalog task under 
a Request Form tab and a User communication tab as show in Figures 11-30 
and 11-31.
Figure 11-30.  In a Catalog task you can show the entire form submitted in a tab.
Figure 11-31.  Catalog tasks can be configured to show directly the Request’s comments 
rather than have a separate User communication channel of its own. You can have the 
Request’s comments conveniently shown in the User communication tab of the Catalog task.
Figure 11-29.  Catalog task for a Request.

Chapter 11 | Examples
196
36. Request tickets descriptions
When a new incident is received via email the subject line is by default set as 
the Incident’s short description.
In the case of Requests submitted by filling an online form there is not a 
Subject field and thus the Short description is often composed from the name 
of the form submitted. For example, if I submit a request filling the Remote 
Access form the short description of the Request will be:
Remote Access for Gabriele Kahlout
Unless the workflow specifies otherwise the short description of the fulfill-
ment Catalog task generated for the request could also be:
Remote Access – Gabriele Kahlout (REQ0041147)
This is all nice and clear for this request. But sometimes the request does not 
have a dedicated form, for example, for the installation of a special software 
and so the Short descriptions would be set as:
Other software for Gabriele Kahlout
Others – Gabriele Kahlout (REQ0041177)
Sifting through ticket lists (or emails) with generic descriptions such as those 
is not the best.
To get a more descriptive description you can let the person changing the 
Short description of a Task associated with the Request to also change the 
Request’s description at once.
So in the above example the descriptions would be more descriptively 
described as follows:
Upgrade Balsamiq Mockups for Gabriele Kahlout
When you change a TASK, RITM, or REQ’s short description you get a pop-up 
prompt (Figure 11-32) that asks you:
Did you want to rename the REQ and all of its child tickets?

Figure 11-33. You can specify In the Workflow that governs Request fulfillment in your 
instance not to close the Request until all tasks associated with the request have also been 
closed.
You could alternatively remediate the problem of generic descriptions by 
either adding a Request short description field in the forms so that the 
requester could fill it, or by seeking to create a Catalog form for each possibly 
requestable item.
But the more forms you show the user, the more difficult it will be for the 
requester to find the one needed. The same goes for fields in the form; the 
more I have to fill, the more daunting the task.
37. Wait for new ad-hoc Task
Sometimes a request will be more involving to fulfill than defined in the default 
Workflow.
For this you can give fulfillment teams the flexibility to list new ad-hoc Catalog 
tasks under the Request so that the Request is not automatically closed as 
soon as the Tasks generated by the Workflow are complete. The Workflow 
will also wait for all open Tasks associated with the Request.
You may make this more flexible by allowing any ticket (Catalog task or 
Change) to be associated with a Request, so that you do not have to create a 
new Task just to hold the Workflow if a ticket already exists.

of a Catalog Task.

38. Log to-do Tasks
In addition to Incident tickets and full-fledged Requests teams often have 
other Tasks that they could track in ServiceNow.
Visual task boards in ServiceNow allow you to create Private tasks which 
you can also share with other people (so they are not necessarily private). As 
ServiceNow Employee Molly Clark described them1:
“Private tasks are not really private (so maybe not the greatest name!). They can 
still be viewed and reported on like other tasks. They are just intended to be a very 
basic task to capture someone’s other “work” that often doesn’t have a particular 
requester, may not need to be assigned, probably doesn’t need SLAs, etc, etc. This is 
often someone’s general “to do” list.”
Alternatively you can also use the familiar Catalog tasks as stand-alone Tasks 
that behave just like other Catalog tasks but without association to a Request 
or Workflow.
39. Reminder Task for return dates
Many requests are temporary, for example a temporary laptop that is required 
only for a day or a week. For such requests you can have ServiceNow create a 
new reminder Task for the Servicedesk to follow up on the return of the item, 
as shown in Figure 11-34.
Figure 11-34.  On the home page you can show a list of reminders due on the day for the 
team to remember and process.
40. No going back on approved
Once a Catalog request or a Change Request is approved the Workflow of 
the request will move forward. Yet, the approver could still go back and reject 
the Approval request again even though the request is already approved and 
in the fulfillment stage. Leaving such an option open to approvers can be a 
potential source of disputes and confusion.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
199
To avoid it, set approvals as final. Once an Approval request is approved the 
approval cannot be renegaded. The approver can still request to cancel or 
alter the request, but this will trigger the right set of actions and expectations.
Figure 11-35.  Even though a request may be approved and moved into fulfillment approvers 
could potentially go back and renegade their approval. This will trigger an email notification to 
the requester, but the workflow will have already passed the approval stage.
41. Consistent workflows
The Request Workflow applies to all received Requests in ServiceNow 
ensuring consistency for all Requests. However after the Request workflow, 
the Requested item workflow will kick-in and this can be different for each 
requestable item.
But chances are that there will be a lot of similarity between most, if not all of 
your items’ approval and fulfillment Workflows.
As such, strive to re-use the same Workflows as much as possible to ensure a 
consistent user experience with Requests on the portal and so that bug fixes 
and improvements apply for all Requests.
42. Cannot reopen requests
Unlike for incidents if the user replies to a closed Request there will be no 
option to re-open the Request. You can however have a new Incident ticket 
linked to the Request.

Crash course on basic ServiceNow terminology
You have invested the time to read this book about ServiceNow, which I hope 
you found worthwhile.
Yet due to the non-technical nature of the book, you will still be unfamiliar with 
common ServiceNow terms that ServiceNow developers and administrators 
commonly use. Here is a quick explanation of frequently used ServiceNow 
terms, which should make communication with your ServiceNow technical 
colleagues much more fluid.
In this chapter:
• 
Scripting: What are Business rules, Client scripts and UI 
actions in simple terms.
• 
View: How you can show the same record differently, 
depending on who the user is.
• 
Deployment: How data and code are packaged from one 
instance to another.
• 
Reporting: How to control what is shown on users’ home 
pages.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon

Business rules, Client scripts and UI actions
Think of ServiceNow as a database of records (tickets, users, CMDB, etc.) 
with forms and pages to view, insert, and modify those records.
When a record is inserted or modified, Business Rules will run checks to 
ensure that the changes are consistent with how you want records in the 
database to be.
If a modification is found to violate any of your rules, it will be aborted and the 
records in the database will remain unchanged.
On top of aborting inconsistent changes to your database records, Business 
rules can also modify records based on user input, a query, or other related 
records.
For example, when the caller updates a closed ticket (either by replying to the 
closed email notification or through the Self-service form view of the ticket) 
you can have a Business rule that will also set a flag for the Servicedesk’s 
attention. This is how the Noted feedback feature described in Chapter 5 is 
implemented.
Out-of-Box there is also a business rule that runs every time that a ticket is 
reassigned. The Business rule then increments the reassignment count field 
automatically (Figure 12-1).
Figure 12-1.  Out-of-box Business rule that increments the reassignment count field every 
time the assignment group changes.
The good thing about business rules is that they are applied consistently to 
records, regardless of whether the record modification is made through a 
form, list, email, or web service.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
203
The down side is that the behavior of business rules is not transparent to 
users, and may easily overwrite or ignore their changes without them knowing 
it (see Figure 12-2). As discussed in Chapter 8 it is important that you make 
your application’s behavior obvious to its users. So before you allow the 
introduction of a new business rule, check that:
• 
your new Business Rule displays a message that clari-
fies to the user the modification or action taken by the 
Business Rule (as shown in Figure 12-3);
• 
Avoid tampering with out-of-box Business rules as that 
can have undesired consequences and conflicts when you 
upgrade your instance.
Figure 12-2.  Info message shown when opening a Business rule in ServiceNow.
Figure 12-3.  Information message shown by an OOB BR when a ticket is reopened.
To discourage developers from inadvertently making your instance less main-
tainable, require explicit approval and justification before changes to out-of-box 
scripts are made. Otherwise developers should create new ones instead.
Even after you introduce a new Business rule, you may want to make its 
behavior predictable to the user even before she submits the form, and the BR 
applies. A typical example of this is the guidance messages dynamically shown 
as you choose a new password (see Figure 12-4) on a sign-up form.
Figure 12-4. Typical password field in a sign-up form shows immediate feedback to the user 
before she submits the form.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon
204
The server will never accept a weak password but the form uses immediate 
visible client-side indicators to inform the user up front, before she submits 
the form to the server.
The same can be done in ServiceNow with Client scripts (or another configu-
ration) that runs transparently in front of the user.
Client scripts
Client Scripts are like business rules in that they intercept modifications made 
by a user on ServiceNow. The difference is that Client scripts intercept modi-
fications to a form in real time, not to the record once it is submitted to the 
database.
So Client scripts run before business rules directly on the browser form 
opened by the user and based on her actions on the form, can be used to:
• 
Auto-fill fields on the form (Figures 12-5 and 12-6);
• 
Make fields on the form mandatory, locked, or hidden;
• 
Reject the setting of certain values and display an alert.
Figure 12-5. When you set or change the caller of an incident, the location field below is 
automatically updated with the user’s location. This behavior is enabled by the OOB Client 
script “(BP) Set Location to User”.
Figure 12-6. Auto-populating the Assignment group when the Assigned to field is set and 
making the Assignment group mandatory can be achieved with client scripts.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
205
UI actions
A UI action is any button, link, or right-click context menu item in a form that 
allows the user to perform an action on the record.
What is special about UI Actions is that they can specify checks and behavior 
to run in the browser (Figure 12-7) and if all is fine, submit the record to the 
server (Figure 12-8).
Figure 12-7. When clicking on the Resolve UI action, Close code and Close notes are 
visibly made mandatory, preventing submission of the record to the server until they are filled.
Figure 12-8. The Resolve UI action defines in the same script code to run on the client, as 
well as other code to run on the server.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon
206
To summarize, use Client scripts to interactively auto-fill fields in forms and 
Business rules for other settings that should apply to all records regardless of 
how the update is submitted (form, email, script). UI actions are buttons that 
can do things both on the form and on the server before BRs are run. Use 
them to make things easier for the user.
For more details about scripting in ServiceNow, check out ServiceNow’s offi-
cial documentation on scripting.12
Views and Access control rules
With Views in ServiceNow you can customize how a form in ServiceNow 
will look depending on where it is accessed from. If you are familiar with web 
design, this is similar to websites looking different if opened from a mobile 
view versus a desktop or a tablet.
For example, when an end user views an incident ticket she will see the Self-
service view of the ticket (Figure 12-9); whereas when an ITIL user views the 
same ticket from his account he will see the default view for ITIL users. If the 
ticket is opened from a Visual task board the ticket will again look different 
(Figure 12-10).
Figure 12-9.  Incident viewed in self-service view.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
207
Creating views is not a mechanism to control who sees what; It is just a way 
to define the form layout (Figure 12-11) that is shown to different users. Users 
could still change the view or see all fields she has access to see on a ticket, by 
previewing the ticket history (Figure 12-12).
Figure 12-10.  Incident viewed from a Visual task board.
Figure 12-11.  From the Form layout page you can select which fields are shown in each view.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon
208
To control who can see what or modify particular fields in a ticket you need 
to define Access Control Rules (ACLs).
ACL allows you to define which conditions must be met and which access 
role a user should have in order to view or modify a particular field in a form 
(Figure 12-13). Because of ACL rules even if you view ticket in a view that 
should show fields which you don’t have access to you will not be able see 
them.
Figure 12-12.  In the record’s History detail log users can see all the fields that they have 
access to see.
Figure 12-13.  List of ACLs defined for fields in the incident table.
Custom apps, Modules, and Application menus
If you want to create a new type of ticket distinct from existing tickets in 
ServiceNow you can create a new custom application in ServiceNow.
A custom application in ServiceNow (Figure 12-14) allows you to create new 
ticket types and define who can access them (ACL), what Business rules to 
impose on them, email notifications triggered for them, etc.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
209
Applications basically let you leverage all the ServiceNow ecosystem of email 
notifications, access control, forms, and scripts for a new process that you define.
Besides creating your own custom application, you could also browse, acquire, 
and install applications from ServiceNow third parties store.3
Each Application will have an Application menu section which is a section in 
the navigation menu.
You can, however, also create new Application menus that list links to mul-
tiple applications without all of them belonging to the same application. For 
example, the Self-service application menu in Figure 12-15 provides links to 
Incidents, the Knowledge base, and Visual task boards.

Breadcrumbs, dot-walking, and saved filters
A very powerful tool that you have when searching and running reports in 
ServiceNow is dot-walking.
When previewing a list of records, or running a report on a particular table, 
you can select the fields that you want to see for the records in the table. You 
can also select the fields of records in another table as long as that table is 
reference from a field that you selected.
For example, say you want to view a list of all open tickets for callers whose 
accounts are inactive (they left the organization). There is no field called For 
inactive user in the incident ticket, but you could get the same information 
on the fly by dot-walking through the Caller field, as shown in Figures 12-16, 
12-17, and 12-18.
Figure 12-16. To begin dot-walking, first select Show Related Fields from the drop-down menu.

The breadcrumb is the horizontal list of filters applied to the list of records 
that you are viewing. Filters on a list can be saved for future use as shown in 
Figure 12-19.
Figure 12-17.  Select the new option that appears with an arrow (=>) below the reference 
field that you want to dot-walk.

Figure 12-19.  Filters in the breadcrumb can be saved so that you or colleagues can return 
to the same query again.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon
212
Update sets, Import sets, and Inbound actions
An Update set is ServiceNow’s way to package changes for deployment from 
one instance to another.
Just like the Track Changes switch in Microsoft Word, only the changes that 
are made after the update set has been created and set will be tracked in the 
Update set. So developers must first create an update set and set it as their 
current Update set before they start making transferable changes.
When importing an Update set into an instance ServiceNow will compare 
the changes to the existing instance’s code, show differences or conflicts, and 
prompt the administrator to either apply the changes or backtrack.
Importing data
Whereas Update sets were for importing code and configuration from one 
instance to another, Import sets are for importing data.
Data from external sources such as Excel sheets or LDAP servers is first 
imported into a temporary table in ServiceNow, an Import set. With the data 
in it you can apply rules and copy the data to a permanent record table that 
you specify.
The process of matching the data in an Import set with a table in ServiceNow 
is defined in a Transform map.
In a Transform map, you define which fields in the Import set should match 
which fields in your target ServiceNow table.
For example, if your Import set table contains User objects imported from 
your Active Directory, your transform map will map each User object field 
with the corresponding field in the User table (Figure 12-20).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
213
In a transform map you also specify a coalesce field. This tells ServiceNow 
that while it imports the data from the Import set, it should check if there is 
already in the target table a record that has the same value in the coalesce 
field as the one that is about to be imported. If one is found, rather than create 
a new record ServiceNow will update the existing one instead.
A typical coalesce field for a user’s Transform map is the user_name but it 
could also be the email address or the objectSID as discussed in Chapters 3 
and 11.
Inbound email actions
Inbound Email actions are scripts (Figure 12-21) that define how to deal with 
incoming emails. Out of the box, they are configured to create and update 
incident tickets as was described in Chapter 5.
Figure 12-20.  Default Transform map for matching user fields in Active Directory with user 
fields in ServiceNow.

Chapter 12 | ServiceNow jargon
214
Task table, Sys_id and Dictionary overrides
Most of the tickets available in ServiceNow (Incident, Problem, Change 
Request, Catalog Task, etc.) all inherit fields and functionality from a parent 
Task table. This means that every Incident is by definition also a Task.
What this means for you is that if you want to run a report that lists both 
Problem tickets, Incidents, and Requests you can create a report on the Task 
table, as shown in Figure 12-22. It also means that if you want to have a feature, 
field, or common behavior on all your tickets you can define it at the Task 
level.
Figure 12-22.  Reports can be created at the Task table level to report on multiple ticket 
types in the same report.
Figure 12-21.  Script of the inbound email action “Update Incident (BP)”.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
215
You could however override the property of a field inherited from the Task 
table by defining a dictionary override specific to a particular table. For exam-
ple, you could have the Assigned to field labeled as Change owner in Change 
requests.
Every record in ServiceNow is assigned a unique 32-character ID: the sys_id.
It’s like the number field but it is unique across all ServiceNow instances in the 
world. It looks like this: 9c573169c611228700193229fff72400
Home pages and Gauges
A home page in ServiceNow is a landing page that a user can be shown when 
they go to ServiceNow. By default there is a Self-service home page that is shown 
to end users while users with the ITIL role are shown the ITIL home page.
Each user can create and customize her own home page while administrators 
can also create, set, and control the home page of others.
A gauge is basically a widget or list that can be added to the home page. It can 
be created from a query or from a report.

Appendices
Your purpose is to make your audience see what you saw, hear what you 
heard, feel what you felt.
—Dale Carnegie
In this book I tried to organize and present topics typically overlooked by 
decision makers in charge of ServiceNow and the ITSM program at their 
organization.
I suggested that certain key elements in the way that you propose, implement, 
and expand ServiceNow at your organization can minimize the risks of failure 
and low users’ adoption, and demonstrate early returns on the investment 
(ROI) in terms of customer satisfaction and an active user base. I proposed 
that having nurtured those early successes will give the firm foundations that 
you need before pursuing more advanced aspects of your ITSM initiative.
Throughout the book, I have tried to get into as few technical details as pos-
sible to illustrate the point being made; But if you are interested in more 
details, check out the following appendices.

Checklists for before and after deployment
For your convenience, here you will find:
• 
Checklists to assess the risk of new customizations;
• 
Pre- and post-release checklists for new customizations;
• 
Gauges to monitor email sending and receiving activity;
• 
Charts to monitor and pinpoint performance issues.
Risk assessment
To determine the risk associated with a new change to ServiceNow consider 
the following questions:
• 
Is the change documented in ServiceNow’s official online 
documentation (e.g., a property setting, enabling of a plu-
gin, or a Useful script)?
• 
Does the new change modify code used to process 
incoming emails or outgoing notifications?
• 
Does the change involve server-side scripting, such as in a 
business rule or a script include?
A

Appendix A | Checks and Monitors
220
• 
Does the change modify how users are matched between 
your directory server and ServiceNow?
• 
Will the change affect all users or just those of a particu-
lar application (e.g., Asset Management)?
• 
Does the change mass update records at once (e.g., 
through a background script or scheduled job)?
• 
Will the change be deployed using update sets which can 
be rolled back or will it be performed in the instance?
The riskier the change the more careful you will want to be with testing and 
monitoring post-release.
You also want to make sure you have a fallback plan with stakeholders (e.g., 
temporarily stop emails redirected to ServiceNow) in case you end up need-
ing some extra time.
Checks before deployment to Production
Before you commit your changes to the production instance it helps to set 
expectations with your stakeholders. Verify if:
• 
A ticket has been logged in ServiceNow describing the 
new feature or change;
• 
Stakeholders have been informed about the change and 
its potential impact on their use of ServiceNow;
• 
Training and documentation have been provided for how 
the new feature works (if necessary);
• 
The change has been made in a non-production environ-
ment similar to your production instance;
• 
There is testing evidence of the change working as 
expected;
• 
The change is consistent in behavior and usability with 
existing modules of the application;
• 
Possible side effects of the changes have been considered 
and tested (e.g., no duplicate emails are now generated).

Spinning Up ServiceNow
221
Checks after deployment
After you deploy, and depending on what areas of the application were affected, 
you may want to test and monitor that:
• 
The new features work as expected in the live instance;
• 
All emails sent and received from ServiceNow after the 
change have a record attached to them and no error 
message;
• 
The number of emails sent for ticket updates after the 
change is consistent with your expectations;
• 
There are no new errors at the scheduled synchroni-
zation of users between your directory servers and 
ServiceNow;
• 
New tickets have been logged in successfully since the 
change and older ones have been updated with no issues.
Special checks
Depending on which modules you use in ServiceNow, you will normally want 
to inquire and carefully test changes that affect any of the following:
• 
Inbound email actions
• 
Email notifications
• 
LDAP sync settings
• 
Business rules
Inbound email actions
Inbound email actions are perhaps the most critical component of your 
ServiceNow application as it’s responsible for processing incoming emails to 
your instance.
You want to avoid and minimize changes to such a central and impactful mod-
ule in your application by making sure for example that your inbound email 
action scripts contain only code strictly related to the processing of emails 
and that it may be rarely changed.

Appendix A | Checks and Monitors
222
If a change is made to an inbound email action script or a script include ref-
erenced from an inbound email action then you need to test and monitor the 
correct processing of incoming emails after the change is made. In particular, 
you should test that:
	1.	 New incoming emails create new tickets correctly;
	2.	 Replies to existing ticket emails update the correct ticket.
To be even surer and quickly uncover unexpected issues, you can also moni-
tor emails processed since the changes were deployed. Monitor the following 
things in particular:
	1.	 Error logs generated from the email processing scripts;
	2.	 Incoming emails with an ignored status in ServiceNow 
or without an associated target record; That is, it didn’t 
update any ticket (Figure A-1)
Figure A-1.  Monitor incoming email logs for non-empty error messages and emails that 
updated no ticket.
Incoming emails monitor
You can create a gauge to monitor incoming emails that have not yet been 
matched with any ticket (Figure A-2).
Figure A-2.  Create a report that you can pin to the home page to keep track of incoming 
email activity and possible issues.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
223
If the number fluctuates it means that you are receiving emails, they are pro-
cessed and matched with tickets, and the cycle repeats.
If instead the number remains stagnant you may have a problem processing 
emails (or you receive too few emails and they are processed very quickly).
In a busy instance, the number of unprocessed emails may not go down to 
zero as some emails are intentionally received and ignored. Clicking on the 
number you can preview the kind of emails that are unprocessed and confirm 
if there is an issue or not.
Outgoing emails monitor
Because it can happen that emails get stuck in ServiceNow and are not pro-
cessed or that emails remain in the outbox queues but are not sent for hours 
add a gauge indicative of email activity to the home page of your Servicedesk 
(as in Figure A-3 or A-4).
Figure A-3.  Gauge to keep track in real time of the number of emails in send-ready state.

Appendix A | Checks and Monitors
224
The gauges displays how many emails there are in send-ready state. If the 
number keeps fluctuating (going up and down), it means the instance is suc-
cessfully generating new emails to send and sending them.
However if the number remains the same for a while or keeps going up only 
then you have a problem. There may be an issue sending emails through the 
email server (check connectivity with SMTP servers) or with email notifica-
tions not being generated (in case the number is always zero).
When setting the gauges you also want to track emails that are not of an 
unknown email types because that’s likely to be an error state.
Email notifications
Email notifications settings in ServiceNow directly affect what your end users 
will receive or not receive from your instance. Tread carefully when changing, 
adding, or removing email notifications.
If you make changes to email notifications be sure to count and monitor how 
many emails are sent out about the same ticket at the same time. Changes to 
email notifications in ServiceNow can easily result in duplicate notifications 
being sent to the same people.
Your email notifications will also contain links, for example the link to preview 
the ticket in a web browser. Test those links after release as they may be bro-
ken or point to your non-development instance.
Figure A-4.  Counter to keep track in real time of the number of emails in send-ready state.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
225
LDAP sync settings
Changes to your LDAP sync settings may result in the duplicate import of 
users from Active Directory or a failure to import new ones. After making 
changes, it is important to run a synchronization between the two and cross-
check that:
	1.	 The number of imported and updated users is consistent 
with your expectations;
	2.	 There are no new errors in the LDAP logs.
Business rules
Business rules in ServiceNow basically define things that happen to the ticket 
on the server. For example assigning the ticket to a certain group based on 
the location of the caller.
Because the update happens after the user completes his action business rules 
can lead to unexpected behavior contrary to the user’s will. For this reason 
you want to be careful with the introduction or edit of business rules and in 
particular check that:
	1.	 The business rule doesn’t silently overwrite a value the 
user had set on the form. If the value entered by the user 
is not what you want it to be, prevent the ticket from 
being submitted erroneously, or at least let the business 
rule inform the user.
In some cases your business rule makes changes such 
as rounding time fields. In such case, let it also inform 
the user of the change.
	2.	 the business rule doesn’t conflict with other business 
rules that may also run on the same update.
Charts to measure slowness
If your users are complaining about slowness you can use a chart to crystal-
lize who experienced slowness and when as well as compare the slowness to 
other time periods of the day or of the week (Figure A-5).

Appendix A | Checks and Monitors
226
Besides the satisfaction and sense of control that those charts provide you 
with they can also be very useful when reporting performance issues to 
ServiceNow.
In the chart settings you can control the sensitivity of wait time. In the settings 
shown below in Figure A-6 for example, we report on all user transactions in 
which the user had to wait more than 10 seconds. You can change the sensitiv-
ity of wait time as you see fit.
Figure A-5.  Bar chart showing how many times users had to wait every day of the week.
Figure A-6. The Trend chart counts how many times in the day users had to wait more than 
10 seconds at once.

227
The colors staked in the bars of Figure A-5 represent the users that had to 
wait; if you click on each color you will be taken to the user transaction that 
took so long to execute as shown in Figure A-7.
Figure A-7.  From the chart you can drill and see details of the longest-running user transactions.
The above chart in Figure A-5 is good to keep an eye on the application per-
formance and quickly identify if performance seems to have suddenly wors-
ened recently.
When you determine that slowness is indeed being experienced across the 
application you can check a few more charts like those in Figure A-8 to better 
understand the impact of the slowness and if there is any bottleneck.
Figure A-8.  On a troubling day you can preview in which hours slowness was most 
experienced and compare if it coincided with long-running system transactions
The chart above on the left shows users’ wait time hour by hour during the 
day. The chart on the right shows all long-running transactions in ServiceNow 
also hour by hour during the day. Putting them next to each other you could 
identify if there are long-running system transactions that severely influenced 
user transactions wait time as well.

Appendix A | Checks and Monitors
228
Note that there are other charts and monitors mentioned in Chapters 3  
and 11.
Finally on performance, day of the week comparisons of user wait times give 
you a good indication if performance is good on the day relative to other 
days of the week. But to get a better picture of your application performance 
in general you can extend the charts to a longer period of time as shown in 
Figures A-9 and A-10 below and see if things are relatively stable, improving, 
or worsening.
Figure A-10. To compare performance over a longer period of time, create a Trend report 
trending by date.
Figure A-9.  Compare wait times over the past month to get a sense if performance is 
relatively stable, worsening, or improving.

Appendix B | Access Requirements
230
Requirements format
ServiceNow distinguishes between functional requirements (what ServiceNow is 
expected to do) and corresponding technical constraints on how the require-
ment should be implemented.
With this understanding of requirements, here is a list of two-line functional 
requirements. If there is difficulty understanding any of them refer to the 
relevant chapter for additional details and context.
User access
For your Servicedesk to be able to effectively log and manage tickets in 
ServiceNow, everyone in your organization will need to have a user profile in 
ServiceNow even if they will never log in.
Here are proposed requirements for your ServiceNow instance to import 
and sync user profiles from your organization’s directory servers and to pro-
vide your support team members with adequate access.
Prerequisites
ServiceNow comes with built-in support for the integration with Active 
Directory servers and ServiceNow’s official documentation provides a com-
prehensive walk-through of all the steps involved in a standard integration.2 3
Nonetheless, the integration is still a fairly technical set-up and requires col-
laboration between your Active Directory administrators, Network team, and 
your ServiceNow administrator. You may also need ServiceNow’s involve-
ment. Your SN administrator will need support to:
	1.	 Obtain from your Active Directory administrators the 
integration end points of the Active Directory server to 
enter in ServiceNow as shown in Figure B-1:
a.	
The address of the Active Directory server that 
ServiceNow should connect to;
b.	 The credentials of a read-only account in AD that 
can be used to connect external applications like 
ServiceNow;
c.	 The top-level OU name that contains all user profiles 
to be synchronized with ServiceNow;

integrate/ldap/concept/c_LDAPIntegrationSetup.html

Spinning Up ServiceNow
231
	2.	 Get your Network team to enable ServiceNow serv-
ers to connect to the Active Directory servers of your 
organization. For this to happen, the Network team will 
have to whitelist traffic between ServiceNow and the 
Active Directory servers, possibly through a VPN tunnel 
(optional) or through an intermediary MID server.
If a VPN tunnel is to be established between ServiceNow’s servers and your 
organization’s directory server, you will also need to submit a request to 
ServiceNow’s support on SN.HI.

Appendix B | Access Requirements
232
User profiles
	1.	 Create new user profiles in ServiceNow automatically for 
staff at your organization with details such as full name, 
email address, and staff ID number.
	2.	 For each user profile in Active Directory there should be 
only one corresponding profile in ServiceNow.
	3.	 Enable staff to log in to ServiceNow with their Active 
Directory credentials.
	4.	 Update automatically existing user profiles in ServiceNow 
when their details are updated in Active Directory.
	5.	 Enforce that no two users in ServiceNow can have the 
same email address, full name, user ID, or staff ID.
	6.	 Do not import in ServiceNow accounts with an empty 
email address, name, or User ID.
Servicedesk access
	1.	 Servicedesk team members should be able to view and 
update all tickets in ServiceNow.
	2.	 Allow Servicedesk to add or remove members to their 
team in Service Now, or to other teams.
	3.	 Adding or removing people from the Servicedesk group 
in Service Now should automatically grant or revoke 
associated access privileges.
Availability
	1.	 Allow a ServiceNow administrator to log in to ServiceNow 
even when there is a problem with the LDAP integration.
	2.	 Alert the Servicedesk and the ServiceNow administrator 
via email when an issue is detected with LDAP.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
233
Security
	1.	 Accounts disabled or expired in Active Directory should 
not be allowed to log in to ServiceNow, out of security 
concerns.
	2.	 Changing a password in Active Directory should take 
effect in ServiceNow too; That is, no user should be able 
to log in to ServiceNow with the old password and the 
new password should work immediately in ServiceNow.
	3.	 ServiceNow should only inquire Active Directory about 
the user profile fields desired to be in ServiceNow, not all 
available attributes in the Directory server.
	4.	 Back-end communication between ServiceNow and direc-
tory servers should occur only through secure channels, to 
avoid malicious spoofing of passwords or users’ data.
	5.	 Restrict access to sensitive user details such as Staff ID.
Performance
	1.	 Schedule the sync between ServiceNow and the Active 
Directory servers to occur once daily, outside peak 
hours.
	2.	 Leverage performance optimization settings supported 
by ServiceNow and the Active Directory servers, such as 
Paging.
Vendors access
	1.	 Develop a custom Vendor role and modify ServiceNow 
to allow assignment to teams with the vendor role while 
also forbidding them from viewing tickets not assigned to 
them.
OR
	2.	 Give vendors the ITIL role just like other teams but imple-
ment access on a need-to-know basis as recommended 
in Chapter 9. This way, it will be possible to assign tickets 
to them just like other teams but they will only be able 
to view and collaborate on tickets assigned to them or in 
which they are mentioned.

Appendix B | Access Requirements
234
Other
Setting the user location based on LDAP setting depends on the Directory 
structure at the organization; refer to Chapter 11 for how it is at Al Jazeera.
You will also find a discussion about syncing groups and Single Sign-On in 
Chapter 3.
Access to data
Chapter 9 details a model to restrict access to ticket details on a need-to-
know basis. Here is a bullet point summary of the proposed access model:
End-user accesss
	1.	 At any one time, the caller and the people listed in the 
watchlist of the ticket can see and participate in the user-
visible communication as well as download and manage 
file attachments.
	2.	 Those already with access can extend or revoke same 
access by adding or removing people (or entire teams) 
from the watch list.
Full access
	1.	 At any one time, only the team set as the assignment 
group of the ticket, “sister teams,” and the people listed 
in the worknotes list have full access to the ticket.
	2.	 Sister teams are the teams that have the same team as a 
parent (e.g., the Network team and the System team may 
have Infrastructure as a parent).
	3.	 Those already with access can extend or revoke same 
access by adding or removing people (or entire teams) 
from the work notes lists.
	4.	 If a ticket is not assigned to any group, it will not be con-
fidential and all ITIL users will have full access to it until it 
is assigned to a team.

Spinning Up ServiceNow
235
Others access
	1.	 All ITIL users can preview basic ticket information such as 
its status and to whom it is assigned, but cannot alter it.
	2.	 Access restrictions should apply uniformly to everybody, 
including ServiceNow administrators.
	3.	 Impersonating a user should not grant the impersonator 
access to data she otherwise would not be able to view 
without the impersonation.
	4.	 The same access constraints applied to a ticket should 
also apply to the body of emails and the file attachments 
related to the ticket.
For added flexibility, also implement group watchlists so that access can be 
extended to entire teams, rather than only on an individual basis.
So, there are now three levels of access to a ticket:
	1.	 Read-only access to the ticket’s basic headers, available to 
all ITIL users;
	2.	 Full access to the ticket, granted only to members of the 
ticket’s assignment group, sister teams, or those listed in 
the work notes lists;
	3.	 The caller and those listed in the ticket’s watch list can 
download and add file attachments, as well as participate 
in the user communication.
