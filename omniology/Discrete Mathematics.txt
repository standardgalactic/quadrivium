PREFACE
THE EMERGENCE OF MATHEMATICS
Although the emergence of mathematics can be traced back to many regions of the world, there is
an international mathematics that had its roots in Egypt and Babylonia and developed signiﬁcantly
in ancient Greece. The mathematics of Greece was translated into Arabic, as was some mathematics
of India about the same time. This mathematics was later translated into Latin and became the
mathematics of Western Europe and, centuries later, the mathematics of the world.
Although
mathematics developed in other parts of the world, particularly China, Japan and South India, this
Asian mathematics did not have the impact that the international mathematics did.
Mathematical history has not followed the same path as other histories of the human spirit.
Whether one is considering science, medicine or space exploration, nearly every human endeavor has
seen its history marked by advances, corrections and reversals. Mathematics, however, has experi-
enced only advancement. The theorems of yesterday are also theorems today. The accomplishments
of the mathematicians of the past have become the foundation of present-day mathematics. With
every new era in mathematics, a new peak has been created.
During the latter part of the 17th century and into the 18th century, much attention was paid
to the development of calculus. During that period, there was great emphasis on real numbers and
continuous mathematics. By the time the 19th century had arrived and early into the 20th century,
logic and the emphasis placed on valid arguments to establish the truth of mathematical statements
achieved ever-increasing importance.
THE ROAD TO DISCRETE MATHEMATICS
By the middle of the 20th century, another kind of mathematics, quite unlike the continuous
mathematics of calculus, had become prominent: discrete mathematics. Instead of being concerned
with real numbers, this mathematics was more involved with integers and other “similar” collections
of objects, as well as with ﬁnite collections.
Discrete mathematics became primarily the study of the mathematical properties of sets, systems
and structures having a “countable” collection of elements. The growing popularity of and interest
in discrete mathematics was greatly inﬂuenced by its applications to areas such as computer science,
engineering, communication and transportation as well as its emergence as a fascinating area of
mathematics.
Like all mathematics, the validity and understanding of discrete mathematics rely on logic,
sets, functions and methods of proof. More unique to discrete mathematics, however, are topics
involving procedures (algorithms) for solving problems and the number of objects possessing certain
properties of interest – the area of discrete mathematics called enumerative combinatorics. Also,
discrete mathematics is concerned with the study of relations and graph theory, a growing area of
discrete mathematics with a much shorter history.
In the middle of the 20th century, a beginning college student, even those with a strong mathe-
matical background, would likely take courses in college algebra, trigonometry and analytic geometry,
followed then by a sequence in calculus. At the same time, high school seniors were taking courses
in Euclidean geometry, advanced algebra and trigonometry. As time went by, it became common-
place for beginning college students to take courses in precalculus and perhaps calculus, while high
school students were taking courses dealing with functions, statistics and continuous mathematics
(an introduction to calculus).
The passing years saw ﬁrst the introduction of, then advances in and now the bombardment
of technology into college courses and everyday life.
Computer science became a major area of
study, especially computer programming, development of software, data structures and analysis of

x
algorithms. Discrete mathematics is the mathematics underlying computer science. Indeed, this
mathematics has become important for many areas of study and has developed into a major area of
mathematics of its own.
A COURSE IN DISCRETE MATHEMATICS
Developing an appreciation of and learning any area of mathematics requires a comprehension
of the concepts occurring in the area (each of which requires a clear deﬁnition) and a knowledge of
certain valid statements, each of which is either an axiom (whose truth is accepted without proof)
or a theorem (whose truth can be established with the aid of concepts and other statements). This
is best accomplished if we can understand proofs of theorems and are able to write some proofs of
our own. We will be introduced to several methods of proof that can be used to establish the truth
of theorems as well as ways to show that statements are false. These methods are based on logic,
which allow us to use reasoning to show that a given statement is true or false. Although it is not our
intention to go into any of this in great depth, it is our goal to present enough details and examples
so that a sound introduction to proofs can be obtained. Developing a good understanding of proofs
requires a great deal of practice and experience and comprehending how others prove theorems.
These are the subjects of Chapters 1–3.
Chapter 4 is devoted to an important proof technique that can be used to establish the truth of
special kinds of statements: mathematical induction. This proof technique is frequently employed
in computer science. The related topic of recurrence is discussed in Chapter 4 as well.
Chapter 5 deals with concepts that are fundamental to all areas of mathematics: relations and
functions. The important subject of equivalence relations is introduced in this chapter. Functions
that are both one-to-one and onto are especially important and are emphasized in the chapter.
Algorithms are discussed in Chapter 6. The concept of algorithms is well known to and encoun-
tered often in computer science. There are problems in which it is convenient to have a solution
consisting of an eﬃcient step-by-step set of instructions from which a computer program can be
written. The number of steps needed to use some algorithms to solve certain kinds of problems is
analyzed. Particular emphasis is paid to search and sort algorithms.
The numbers encountered most often in discrete mathematics are the integers. Chapter 7 is
devoted to the study of integers, particularly their divisibility properties. Primes and their properties
are discussed, as is the important topic of congruence.
The Division Algorithm and Euclidean
Algorithm are introduced and illustrated in this chapter as well.
Integer representations and a
discussion of the bases 2, 8 and 16 occur here.
Chapters 8–10 deal with the area of discrete mathematics called enumerative combinatorics: the
study of counting. The basic principles of counting are introduced in Chapter 8: multiplication,
addition, pigeonhole, inclusion-exclusion. In Chapter 8, permutations and combinations are also in-
troduced. These two concepts give rise to a wide variety of counting problems. Chapter 9 discusses
the concept of Pascal triangles and the related binomial theorem and presents more advanced count-
ing problems, some through the subject of generating functions. Chapter 10 gives an introduction
to discrete probability. Random variables and expected values are also presented in this chapter.
There are many ways in which a pair of elements can be compared or related. Particularly when
elements belong to the same set, there are numerous occurrences of this idea in mathematics. One of
these relations has the same basic properties of the equality of numbers and is called an equivalence
relation (discussed in Chapter 5). Another relation has the same basic properties of the “less than
or equal to” comparison of two numbers and is called a partial ordering. Partially ordered sets
are discussed in Chapter 11. This gives rise to the structures referred to as lattices and Boolean
algebras, which are also discussed in Chapter 11.
Chapters 12–15 deal with the area of graph theory, a major subject within discrete mathematics.
Chapter 12 introduces the fundamental concepts of graph theory and concepts involving paths and
cycles. This gives rise to the study of Eulerian graphs and Hamiltonian graphs. Chapter 13 is
devoted to the important class of graphs called trees. Minimum spanning trees are discussed and

xi
two algorithms, Kruskal’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm, are presented and illustrated. Depth-ﬁrst
search and breadth-ﬁrst search are also discussed in Chapter 13. One of the most famous problems
in graph theory (in fact, in mathematics) was the Four Color Problem. This problem involves the
concepts of planar graphs and graph colorings, which are the major topics in Chapter 14. Chapter 15
deals with directed graphs, the most studied class being the tournaments. Directed graphs are useful
in the study of ﬁnite-state machines, another concept discussed in Chapter 15.
TO THE STUDENT
• Prerequisites
A background in algebra and precalculus (and recalling the major topics and techniques in
these areas) is an important prerequisite for a course in discrete mathematics. It would also
be helpful if the student had taken a course or two in calculus. It is probably most important,
however, that a student enters a course in discrete mathematics with a desire for learning
and a goal of doing the best that he or she can do. This certainly means attending class
regularly, being an attentive student and doing homework faithfully. Being a successful student
in discrete mathematics takes a certain amount of dedication. Discrete mathematics, unlike
much of calculus and precalculus, may not build on other courses the student has already taken.
For most students, this is an exciting new subject whose topics will be encountered often again
if there are more mathematics, computer science or engineering courses in a student’s future.
• Concepts and Theorems
As with all areas of mathematics, discrete mathematics deals with the understanding of con-
cepts and theorems. The deﬁnitions of all concepts are presented and, if the concept is consid-
ered a major concept, it is prominently displayed. Almost all theorems are proved. Care has
been taken to give clear proofs. Time will not permit your instructor to prove all theorems in
class but, especially if your instructor emphasizes proofs in class, it is a good idea to read the
proofs of any theorems discussed in class.
• Examples
This textbook contains a large number of examples that illustrate the concepts, theorems and
various methods introduced. These include methods for solving certain kinds of problems and
methods for proving the truth of statements. Before attempting any exercises that have been
assigned and as part of a study plan to prepare for a forthcoming quiz or exam, it is useful
to read and understand the examples presented. Prior to reading the examples, it is useful to
review the concepts and their deﬁnitions and theorems that the exercises deal with.
• Exercises
Each chapter contains a large number of exercises. There are exercises at the end of each
section and additional exercises at the end of each chapter. The exercises range from routine
(which are often similar to examples presented in the text that require a basic understanding
of the concepts or theorems presented) to moderately challenging (which will require some
thought on the student’s part) to more challenging and innovative (which require coming up
with ideas for solving the problem).
Some students spend little time, if any, reading a textbook. This is not a good idea. Only when
an exercise is assigned that they don’t know how to do (and no classmate or the instructor is
available for help) do such students search through the book, looking primarily for examples
that are similar to the exercise assigned. It is far better to read the textbook and understand
the examples in the textbook before attempting to do the exercises assigned. The authors
have spent much time and eﬀort to make this textbook clear and informative (and hopefully
interesting as well). It’s good to take advantage of this.

xii
Answers or hints to odd-numbered exercises (both section exercises and chapter exercises) are
given at the end of the textbook.
• Chapter Highlights
At the end of each chapter are Chapter Highlights. This includes a list of the major concepts
introduced in the chapter (arranged alphabetically) with a brief deﬁnition of each concept. Also
included are the major results introduced in the chapter (arranged in the order presented).
When the chapter has been completed, it is probably a good idea to review the concepts and
theorems covered in class to refresh your memory. It is also good to review these again prior
to a quiz or an exam on this material.
TO THE INSTRUCTOR
• Construction of Chapters
Each chapter is divided into sections (and sometimes even further into topics) for the purpose
of making it easier to decide which portions of a chapter to discuss each class period. With few
exceptions, proofs of the theorems are provided. Even if it is decided not to present a proof in
class, proofs can be read by students. Each chapter contains many examples. The instructor
could present some of these in class. If the instructor prefers not to do this, other examples
can be given. Possibly exercises could be presented to serve as examples.
• Concepts and Theorems
Each chapter contains several concepts and theorems central to the chapter. The deﬁnition
of each concept is presented and deﬁnitions of the major concepts are prominently displayed.
Proofs of most theorems are given. Care has been taken to give clear proofs. Many theorems
are preceded by a “Proof Strategy,” which provides a discussion of a plan of what needs to
be proved and how we might be able to do this. Many proofs of theorems are followed by
a “Proof Analysis,” which is a discussion that reﬂects on a proof just given and emphasizes
certain details that might have gone unnoticed. Occasionally, an example is followed by an
“Analysis,” which serves a similar purpose.
• Exercises
Each section is followed by a set of exercises dealing with the material in that section. In
addition, each chapter is followed by a supplemental set of exercises dealing with the material
in that chapter.
There are a number of exercises that range from routine to moderately
challenging so that it can be determined if the students have an understanding of the concepts,
examples and theorems presented in the section or chapter.
In addition, there are more
innovative exercises to challenge students to think for themselves and come up with ideas
of their own.
• Solutions Manual for Instructors
There is a Solutions Manual for Instructors (prepared by the authors) that contains detailed
solutions of all exercises in the textbook (both section exercises and chapter exercises), includ-
ing complete proofs of all exercises requesting a proof (not simply hints) and often explanations
of solutions of exercises having a numerical answer (not simply the answer).

xiii
TEACHING A COURSE FROM THIS TEXTBOOK
There is enough material in this textbook for a 2-semester sequence in discrete mathematics but
considerably more material than one would attempt to teach in a 1-semester course. What portions
of the textbook to be covered depends, to a great degree, on what the instructor’s goals are. If the
instructor wants to emphasize logic and proofs, the ﬁrst four chapters can be covered in some detail.
It is likely that some of Chapter 5 (Relations and Functions) would be covered. In many instances,
algorithms are covered in Computer Science courses. If this is the case, Chapter 6 can be omitted.
How each chapter in this text relies on other chapters is indicated in the diagram (digraph) below.

Chapter 0
What is Discrete Mathematics?
Before attempting to describe what discrete mathematics is or at least some of the topics it includes,
let’s ﬁrst see what it isn’t. It isn’t continuous mathematics, which is studied in calculus. Calculus
deals with the rate at which certain variables change. When a stone is dropped into water, the
circumference of water ripples created by this expands continuously. When a ball is thrown in the
air, its velocity changes continuously. If a clock has hour, minute and second hands, then these
hands (often) revolve continuously.
When you were introduced to the whole numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . (the nonnegative integers) as a
youngster and learned the rules of arithmetic involving them, you were being taught some discrete
mathematics, albeit very elementary. The games and puzzles you learned and enjoyed were probably
part of discrete mathematics as well.
Digital clocks, which are so common these days, can be
considered part of discrete mathematics.
While real numbers such as
√
2, π and e are so important to continuous mathematics, it’s the
nonnegative integers that mainly concern us in discrete mathematics. Functions such as x2, sin x
and ex (where x is a real number) are of great importance to us in continuous mathematics, while
n2 and 2n (where n is a positive integer) are important to us in discrete mathematics. The graphs
of y = x2 and m = n2 are shown in Figure 1.

The exponential function y = ex is encountered often in calculus – perhaps not surprisingly
since e is the base of the natural logarithm. This function also has the interesting property that its

derivative dy
dx = ex as well. So when x = 1, both the y-value and the slope of the tangent line to the
graph of this function are e. While the importance of ex may be clear in calculus, one might wonder
what, if any, useful properties 2n might have in discrete mathematics. Here we are considering the
numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, . . .. Just as every positive integer can be expressed as sums of powers of 10,
the same is true of powers of 2. For example,
432 = 102 + 102 + 102 + 102 + 101 + 101 + 101 + 100 + 100 = 28 + 27 + 25 + 24.
Suppose that a coin is ﬂipped. Then there are two possibilities, namely heads (H) or tails (T). If
the coin is ﬂipped twice, there are 4 = 22 possibilities: HH HT TH TT. If a coin is ﬂipped three
times, there are 8 = 23 possibilities:
HHH HHT HTH HTT THH THT TTH TTT.
One might guess (correctly) that if a coin is ﬂipped n times, then there are 2n possibilities for the
sequence of outcomes.
A concept that is encountered often in both continuous mathematics and discrete mathematics
is that of a set. A set is a collection of objects, called the elements of the set. If a set S consists of
the numbers 1 and 2, then we write this set as S = {1, 2}. A set T is called a subset of S if every
element of T is an element of S. There are 4 = 22 subsets of the set S = {1, 2}, namely
{ }, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}.
So one of the subset of S is { }, called the empty set, and consists of no elements; while one of the
subsets is S itself. There are 8 = 23 subsets of the set {1, 2, 3}, namely
{ }, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}.
Here too one might correctly guess that there are 2n subsets of a set with n elements.
A class of numbers that are encountered often are the primes, integers at least 2 whose only
positive integer divisors are 1 and itself. The number 77 is the product of two diﬀerent primes and
its only positive integer divisors are the 4 = 22 numbers 1, 7, 11, 77. The number 30 is the product
of three diﬀerent primes and the 8 = 23 positive integer divisors that divide it are
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.
It turns out in this case as well that if a number A is the product of n diﬀerent primes, then there
are exactly 2n diﬀerent positive integers that divide A.
Suppose that in a gathering of people, every two people are either friends or strangers. Three
people 1, 2, 3 happen to ﬁnd themselves talking to one another. Then either one of these three
people is friends with the other two or one of these people is strangers with the other two. Although
this simple problem can be looked at in a variety of ways, one of these ways uses an area of discrete
mathematics called graph theory, which we will visit in Chapters 12-15. Suppose that we represent
each of the three people 1, 2 and 3 by a point (called a vertex in graph theory). We then join every
two vertices by a line (called an edge in graph theory). If an edge joins two vertices representing two

3
friends, we color this edge red (R) while if an edge joins two vertices representing two strangers we
color this edge blue (B). There are 8 = 23 diﬀerent ways that the edges of this graph can be colored
(see Figure 2). In every case, at least one of the three people is a friend of the other two or at least
one of the three people is not acquainted with of the other two. If a graph has n edges and each
edge is colored red and blue, then there are 2n diﬀerent ways that the edges of this graph can be
colored.

Figure 2: A graph model
There is a related problem, a version of which appeared in the 1953 Putnam Exam, a competitive
exam that many undergraduates in the United States and Canada take. Suppose this time that we
have a gathering of six people 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 where, again, every two people are either friends or
strangers. Then there is either some person who is friends with two others who are friends of each
other or there is some person who is strangers with two others who are strangers of each other.
Another way to state this fact is: There are three mutual friends or three mutual strangers. Yet
another way to say this is: Every graph with six vertices, every two of which are joined by an edge,
where each edge is colored red or blue, there is either a red triangle or a blue triangle. In this case,
the graph has 15 edges. Since every edge can be colored either red or blue, there are 215 = 32, 768
diﬀerent colorings of this graph. Unlike the situation in Figure 2, where there are only 8 colorings of
the graph, it is not practical to list all colorings of the graph and to check out each one individually
to see that it has the desired property. There is, however, another approach – a more mathematical
approach. Consider any coloring whatsoever of the six edges of the graph and consider any one of
the six vertices, say vertex 1. Since there are ﬁve edges joining 1 to the other ﬁve vertices, three of
these edges must be colored the same, say red (R). Suppose that these red edges join vertex 1 to
the three vertices 2, 3 and 4 (see Figure 3).

CHAPTER 0. WHAT IS DISCRETE MATHEMATICS?
If any two of 2, 3 and 4 are joined by a red edge, a red triangle is produced; while if this does
not occur, then there is a blue triangle with the vertices 2, 3 and 4.
Another modern application of discrete mathematics comes from the phrase:
Information is only a click away.
When some key words are typed into www.google.com, for example, the Google search engine goes
into action and usually several web pages are listed (from a few to many). The web pages that are
listed ﬁrst are, in a certain sense, the most relevant. One of the best known and most inﬂuential
methods (called an algorithm) for determining the relevance of web pages is the algorithm used by
the Google search algorithm, which was developed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, both graduate
students at Stanford University at the time. (As of this writing, Page became CEO of Google in
April 2011.) How relevant a certain web page P is to the key words typed at www.google.com can
be determined by considering the web pages that have a link to P. For example, suppose that we
create a certain web page A and this web page has a link to the web page B. This means that for
the topic that web page A is dealing with, web page B is important. There may in fact be many
pages that have a link to B, implying that it is common to believe that B is important. On the other
hand, if only one web page, say C, has a link to B, then C is saying that B is the authoritative web
page for this topic. In this manner, a “rank” can be assigned to each web page, determined by the
ranks of the pages that have a link to it.
For this purpose, the World Wide Web can be represented by a huge graph (actually a “directed
graph” in this case), where each web page is a vertex and there is a “directed” edge from vertex A
to vertex B if there is a link from page A to page B. As an example, suppose that we have a very
small internet, consisting of only four web pages:
www.A.com www.B.com www.C.com www.D.com
Suppose that these appear as follows.
http://www.A.com

The directed graph is Figure 4 is now transformed into a “weighted” directed graph where each
directed edge is assigned a number (a “weight”). Since vertex A has three outgoing directed edges,
a weight of 1
3 is assigned to each such directed edge to indicate that 1
3 of its importance is passed
on to the other three vertices (web pages). This gives us the weighted directed graph in Figure 5.

A deeper look at this information requires more mathematics, such as the subject of linear
algebra.
While the mathematics that serves as the foundation of physics and engineering is continuous
mathematics and this will always be important, it is discrete mathematics that is the foundation of
computer science. Here we are concerned with digital logic: 1 or 0, true or false, yes or no, heads or
tails, red or blue. While technology has moved from analog only to primarily digital, it has become
increasingly important to understand not only the classical continuous mathematics but the more
modern mathematics of the 21st century: discrete mathematics.


Chapter 1
Logic
While calculus is an area of continuous mathematics, in which the primary numbers of interest are the
real numbers, discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics in which the numbers encountered
most often are the integers. In mathematics, it is not numbers that are most important to us,
however. Every area of mathematics deals with concepts and topics that are relevant to that area.
We are often interested in how these concepts are related to one another. These relationships are
expressed as statements. It is not only important to understand what these statements are saying, it
is essential to know that these statements are true and how to convince ourselves of this. Verifying
that statements are true deals with the topic of proof. There are speciﬁc methods for proving that
mathematical statements are true. In order to have an understanding of the various methods of
proofs, it is necessary to have a knowledge of the concept of sets, which will be discussed in the next
chapter, and a knowledge of logic, which is the subject of this chapter.
It is through logic that we are able to build on what we know. The famous physicist Albert
Einstein once stated that logic can carry us only so far:
Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.
Progress in every area is due to the imagination and creativity of people – often only a few
people. There is certainly no formula as to how ideas occur to people. However, being aware of
what is already known as well as learning to ask probing questions are important initial steps. The
well-known writer J. K. Rowling (author of the Harry Potter novels) considered this topic herself
and wrote:
Sometimes ideas just come to me. Other times I have to sweat and almost bleed to make
ideas come. It’s a mysterious process, but I hope I never ﬁnd out exactly how it works.
1.1
Statements
We are about to embark on a study of discrete mathematics. Throughout our study we will encounter
many statements. It is not only essential that we understand what these statements are saying but
how statements can be used. As expected, it is crucial that these statements are true. While there
are instances when we might simply agree to accept the truth of certain statements, more often than
not such statements must be shown to be true. If it is someone else who has veriﬁed the truth of a
statement, then the method used to do this must be convincing. Sometimes, we may need to verify
the truth of statements ourselves. At the base of all this is an understanding of what is meant by a
statement.
In English grammar, sentences are divided into categories. In a declarative sentence, some-
thing is being declared or asserted; in an interrogative sentence, a question is being asked; in
an imperative sentence, a command is given; while in an exclamatory sentence, an emotional
expression is made.

CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Example 1.1
These four kinds of sentences are illustrated below.
1. Los Angeles is the capital of California. (declarative sentence)
2. Broadway is a street in New York City. (declarative sentence)
3. Which state capital has the largest population? (interrogative sentence)
4. Drive to Main Street and then turn right. (imperative sentence)
5. I can’t believe it! (exclamatory sentence)
6. It was then that he arrived there. (declarative sentence)
♦
We use the symbol ♦to indicate the conclusion of a discussion of an example or of a solution
of a problem. Although Example 1.1 presents four diﬀerent types of sentences, it is the declarative
sentences that will be of greatest interest to us.
Deﬁnition 1.2
A statement is a declarative sentence that is either true or false but not both.
Truth Values
The subject of logic deals with statements, what they say and the reasoning one uses to verify that
they are true or to show that they are false. (As in many parts of mathematics, the terminology that
is used is not always universal. For example, some authors refer to statements as propositions.)
Every statement has a truth value. The truth value of a true statement is true, denoted by T;
while the truth value of a false statement is false, denoted by F.
In Example 1.1, sentence 1 is a false statement and so the truth value of this statement is F. The
capital of California is the city of Sacramento, not Los Angeles. Sentence 2 is a true statement as
Broadway is a major street in New York City and the location of many theatres, and so the truth
value of this statement is T. It should be noted that when the truth value of a statement is being
determined, one may need to consider the context of the sentence. For example, it is conceivable
that the capital could be moved to Los Angeles some day (unlikely) or that the street Broadway in
New York City may be renamed some day (also unlikely).
A sentence that is interrogative, imperative or exclamatory does not have a truth value; thus
none of these kinds of sentences are statements. Therefore, none of the sentences 3–5 are statements.
Although sentence 6 is a declarative sentence, it is not a statement. Sentence 6 refers to a date (then),
a person (he) and a place (there). Without knowing the date referred to, who the person is and
what place is being referred to, we cannot determine whether sentence 6 is true or false and so this
sentence is not a statement. That is, this sentence contains variables (namely, “then,” “he” and
“there”) and without knowing the value of each variable, the sentence is not a statement.
Of course, none of the sentences 1–6 in Example 1.1 has anything to do with mathematics. Let’s
look at some that do.
Example 1.3
Classify the following mathematical sentences as declarative, interrogative, imperative or exclama-
tory. Which declarative sentences are statements and which statements are true?
1. Is it true that −9
3 + 4
2 = −9+4
3+2 ?
2. Multiply the numbers 2/3 and 9/10.
3. 1.414 ̸=
√
2.

1.1. STATEMENTS
9
4.
p
(−3)2 = −3.
5. What a diﬃcult calculus exam!
6. 3x + 1 = 7.
Solution. Sentence 1 is interrogative, sentence 2 is imperative, sentences 3 and 4 are declarative,
sentence 5 is exclamatory and sentence 6 is declarative. Sentences 3 and 4 are statements. State-
ment 3 is true as
√
2 does not equal 1.414. The number 1.414 is only an approximation of
√
2.
Statement 4 is false as
p
(−3)2 =
√
9 = 3. Sentence 6, although declarative, is not a statement. It
is impossible to assign a truth value to it without knowing the value of x. If x = 2, then sentence 6
is a true statement; while for any number x ̸= 2, sentence 6 is a false statement.
♦
Open Sentences
Many sentences encountered in mathematics contain variables. These kinds of sentences bring
up additional questions.
Deﬁnition 1.4 An open sentence is a declarative sentence containing one or more variables and
whose truth or falseness depends on the values of these variables.
Sentence 6 in Example 1.3 is therefore an open sentence, not a statement. In fact, sentence 6 in
Example 1.1 is also an open sentence.
We often denote statements or open sentences by symbols, typically representing statements by
P, Q, R or P1, P2, P3 and so on.
Example 1.5
Consider the two statements
P1 : | −2| = −2.
P2 : (−1)3 = −1.
Statement P1 is false since the absolute value of −2 is 2, not −2. However, statement P2 is true. ♦
An open sentence containing a variable x is typically represented by P(x) or some similar nota-
tion. If x represents an object in a collection S of objects, then S is called the domain of x and
P(x) is referred to as an open sentence over the domain S. The domain S of a variable is often
a collection of numbers of some type. (The collection S is called a set in mathematics, which is the
main subject of Chapter 2.) If an open sentence P contains two variables x and y, where the domain
of x is X and the domain of y is Y , then we typically write P as P(x, y), where then x is an object
of X and y is an object of Y . Of course, an open sentence may contain more than two variables.
Let’s look at some open sentences.
Example 1.6
Consider the open sentence
P(x) : 3x −9 = 0
where the element x represents a real number, that is, the domain of x is the collection of real
numbers. Thus
P(3): 3 · 3 −9 = 0
is a true statement and
P(−3): 3(−3) −9 = 0

10
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
is a false statement.
♦
Example 1.7
Consider the open sentence
Q(a, b): 3a + 5b is even
where a and b are integers, that is, the domain of both a and b is the collection of integers. Therefore,
the two statements
Q(1, −3): 3 · 1 + 5 · (−3) = −12 is even.
Q(6, 2): 3 · 6 + 5 · 2 = 28 is even.
are true; while
Q(5, 4): 3 · 5 + 5 · 4 = 35 is even
is a false statement.
♦
Example 1.8
We encountered the open sentence
It was then that he arrived there.
in Example 1.1. This open sentence could be expressed as
P(then, he, there): It was then that he arrived there.
for example. The truth or falseness of P(then, he, there) depends on the values of the variables
“then,” “he” and “there.” For example, the statement
P(on 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong, on the moon):
It was on 20 July 1969 that Neil Armstrong arrived on the moon.
is true; while the statement
P(on 4 July 1776, Christopher Columbus, in Cleveland):
It was on 4 July 1776 that Christopher Columbus arrived in Cleveland.
is false.
♦
Example 1.9
Each of the following is an open sentence, where n represents a positive integer. For which positive
integers n are the following open sentences true statements?
(a) P1(n) : |n + 1| = 0.
(b) P2(n) : n2 −4 ≤0.
(c) P3(n) : n2 −n −6 = 0.
(d) P4(n) : n + 1
n ≤2.
Solution. Let n be a positive integer.
(a) Observe that |n+1| = 0 only when n+1 = 0 and n+1 = 0 only when n = −1. However, −1 is
not a positive integer and so there is no positive integer n for which P1(n) is a true statement.

1.1. STATEMENTS
11
(b) Since n2 −4 ≤0 can be written as n2 ≤4 and this inequality holds when −2 ≤n ≤2, the
only positive integers n for which n2 −4 ≤0 is true are therefore n = 1 and n = 2. Thus n = 1
and n = 2 are the only positive integers for which P2(n) is a true statement. That is, P2(1)
and P2(2) are true, but P2(n) is false when n is any other positive integer.
(c) Since n2 −n −6 = (n −3)(n + 2), it follows that n2 −n −6 = 0 when (n −3)(n + 2) = 0 and
so n = 3 or n = −2. However, since n is a positive integer, n2 −n −6 = 0 only when n = 3.
Therefore, P3(3) is true but P3(n) is false for every positive integer n diﬀerent from 3.
(d) For n = 1, we have n + 1
n = 1 + 1 = 2. When n ≥2, however, n + 1
n > 2. Therefore, the only
positive integer n for which n + 1
n ≤2 is n = 1. So P4(1) is true but P4(n) is false when n is
an integer with n ≥2.
♦
Example 1.10
For an integer n, consider the open sentence
Q(n): 4n + 2 is even.
Determine all those integers n for which Q(n) is a true statement.
Solution. For every integer n, observe that the integer 4n + 2 is even. Therefore, Q(n) is a true
statement for every integer n.
♦
Open sentences that are true statements for every value of each variable in its domain will be of
special interest to us. We will visit these sentences again soon and often.

1.2
Negation, Conjunction and Disjunction
Much of our interest in numbers comes not only from the numbers themselves but from properties
they possess through performing certain operations on them, such as addition, subtraction and
multiplication. A similar comment can be made about statements. That is, our interest in statements
is greatly inﬂuenced by the ways statements can be combined to produce new statements.
New statements can be obtained from given statements in a variety of ways. Furthermore, the
truth values of these new statements depend on and are deﬁned in terms of the truth values of the
given statements. Some of the most common examples of this are described next.
Truth Tables
A table that gives all possible assignments of truth values for a statement or statements under
consideration is called a truth table. The truth table for a single statement P is shown in Figure 1.1.
This table has two rows, giving the two possible truth values that P can have, namely true (T) or
false (F). If Q is a statement, then here too Q can either be true or false. The table of possible truth
values for Q is also given in Figure 1.1. If we happen to be considering the two statements P and
Q simultaneously, then there are 4 = 22 possible combinations of truth values for P and Q, which
we give in the (standard) order: TT, TF, FT, FF. This is also shown in Figure 1.1. Therefore, this
table has four rows.

CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Example 1.11
Suppose that Janet is a college student who took a programming course last semester. She took a
ﬁnal exam at the end of the semeste. Consider the following two statements:
P: Janet studied for the exam.
Q: Janet received an A on the exam.
For these two statements, the four rows in the third table in Figure 1.1 correspond, respectively, to
(1) Janet studied for the exam and received an A on it.
(2) Janet studied for the exam but didn’t receive an A on it.
(3) Janet didn’t study for the exam but received an A on it.
(4) Janet didn’t study for the exam and didn’t receive an A on it.
♦
If there were a third statement R to consider at the same time as P and Q, then there would be
eight rows in the table that considers all 8 = 23 combinations of truth values for P, Q and R (see
Exercise 1).
Negation
Of course, a new number can (ordinarily) be obtained from a given number simply by taking the
negative of the given number. There is a similar situation for statements.
Deﬁnition 1.12
The negation of a statement P is the statement
not P (or It is not the case that P)
written in symbols as ∼P.
Thus the negation operator ∼produces a new statement from a single given statement.
The truth table for the negation of a statement is shown in Figure 1.2. Therefore, for every
statement P, the truth value of its negation ∼P is opposite to that of P.

Example 1.13
Let’s consider statements 1 and 2 in Example 1.1, which we now denote by Q1 and Q2:
Q1 : Los Angeles is the capital of California.
Q2 : Broadway is a street in New York City.
(1.1)
The negation of Q1 is
∼Q1 : It is not the case that Los Angeles is the capital of California.
It sounds much better, however, if we say

1.2. NEGATION, CONJUNCTION AND DISJUNCTION
15
∼Q1 : Los Angeles is not the capital of California.
The negation of Q2 is
∼Q2 : Broadway is not a street in New York City.
Notice that Q1 is false and ∼Q1 is true, while Q2 is true and ∼Q2 is false. This was anticipated
by the truth table in Figure 1.2.
♦
We can also take the negation of open sentences, although there is no truth value associated with
these since in each case we are only creating a new open sentence.
Example 1.14
For a real number x, the negation of the open sentence P(x) : (x −2)2 > 0 is
∼P(x) : (x −2)2 ≤0.
Although P(x) is not a statement, it is a statement for each speciﬁc real number x. For example,
both P(3) and P(2) are statements. In fact, P(3) is true and P(2) is false. As expected, ∼P(3) is
false and ∼P(2) is true.
♦
Conjunction
New statements can also be created from two given statements in a variety of ways. We now
look at two of the best known ways of doing this.
Deﬁnition 1.15 For two statements P and Q, the conjunction of P and Q is the statement
P and Q
denoted by P ∧Q.
The truth table for P ∧Q is given in Figure 1.3. Therefore, P ∧Q is true only when both P and
Q are true.

For the two statements Q1 and Q2 in (1.1), the conjunction of Q1 and Q2 is the statement
Q1 ∧Q2: Los Angeles is the capital of California and
Broadway is a street in New York City.
According to the truth table in Figure 1.3, the statement Q1 ∧Q2 is false since Q1 is false (even
though Q2 is true).
The following statement Q3 is true:
Q3: Walt Disney World is located in Florida.

Since Q2 and Q3 are both true, the conjunction of Q2 and Q3 is the following true statement:
Q2 ∧Q3 : Broadway is a street in New York City and
Walt Disney World is located in Florida.
♦
Disjunction
A new statement can also be produced from two given statements by combining the given state-
ments with the word “or.”
Deﬁnition 1.17 For two statements P and Q, the disjunction of P and Q is the statement
P or Q
denoted by P ∨Q.
The truth table for P ∨Q is given in Figure 1.4. According to this truth table, P ∨Q is false
only when both P and Q are false. Therefore, P ∨Q is true if at least one of P and Q is true.

Figure 1.4: The truth table for disjunction
The word “or” is used in everyday conversation in two ways. For example, if you tell one of your
friends,
“Before attending my discrete math class tomorrow, I’m stopping at the computer lab
or going to the library.”
and it turns out that you visit both the computer lab and the library, then what you said is true.
What you said was not to be interpreted that if you went to one of these two places, then you were
absolutely not going to the other.
There are instances, however, when the word “or” carries with it a diﬀerent interpretation.
Perhaps you’ve been saving money to buy a new car and you’ve decided to buy a Ford or a Toyota.
There is certainly no intention that you will buy both.
Inclusive and Exclusive Or
Therefore, for two statements P and Q, sometimes P or Q has the intended interpretation that
P and Q may both be true; while at other times P or Q has the intended interpretation that P and
Q cannot both be true. In the ﬁrst instance, P or Q is true if at least one of P and Q is true. This
is referred to as the inclusive or. (In English usage, we often say or write “P and/or Q.”) This is
how the disjunction P ∨Q is to be interpreted. Of course, if it’s impossible for both P and Q to be
true, then this has no eﬀect on the truth value of P ∨Q. On the other hand, should our intended use
of “or” in P or Q be that we only want P or Q to be true if exactly one of P and Q is true, then this
is referred to as the exclusive or (as it excludes P and Q from both being true). It is ordinarily
clear which use of “or” is intended. In mathematics, however, the single word “or” is understood to
mean the “inclusive or.” Indeed, the “exclusive or” is seldom encountered in mathematics.
Deﬁnition 1.18 For two statements P and Q, the exclusive or of P and Q is the statement

P or Q but not both
and is denoted by P ⊕Q.
The truth table for P ⊕Q is given in Figure 1.5. Thus P ⊕Q is true only when exactly one of
P and Q is true.

Figure 1.5: The truth table for exclusive or
As with negation, the conjunction, disjunction and exclusive or of two open sentences can also
be formed. As is probably expected, the result of performing either of these operations produces yet
another open sentence.
Example 1.19
For an integer n, consider the two open sentences
P(n): n3 + 2n is even.
Q(n): n2 −4 < 0.
Then the conjunction, disjunction and exclusive or of P(n) and Q(n) are the open sentences:
P(n) ∧Q(n): n3 + 2n is even and n2 −4 < 0.
P(n) ∨Q(n): n3 + 2n is even or n2 −4 < 0.
P(n) ⊕Q(n): n3 + 2n is even or n2 −4 < 0 but not both.
Now, P(1) ∧Q(1) is false, while P(1) ∨Q(1) is true. On the other hand, both P(3) ∧Q(3) and
P(3)∨Q(3) are false statements. Furthermore, P(0)⊕Q(0) is false, while P(1)⊕Q(1) and P(2)⊕Q(2)
are both true.
♦
Example 1.20
For an integer n, consider the two open sentences
P(n): n3 −n = 0.
Q(n): (3n −2)2 ≥20.
(a) Determine all integers n for which P(n) is a true statement.
(b) Determine all integers n for which Q(n) is a true statement.
(c) Investigate the truth values of P(n)∧Q(n), P(n)∨Q(n) and P(n)⊕Q(n) for various integers n.
Solution.
(a) Since n3 −n = n(n2 −1) = n(n −1)(n + 1), it follows that n3 −n = 0 when n = −1, n = 0
or n = 1. Therefore, P(n) is a true statement when n = −1, n = 0 or n = 1 and is a false
statement for all other integers.
(b) The only integers n for which (3n −2)2 < 20 are n = 0, n = 1 and n = 2. Therefore, Q(n) is
a false statement when n = 0, n = 1 or n = 2 and is a true statement for all other integers n.

18
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
(c) Since P(−1) and Q(−1) are both true, so is P(−1) ∧Q(−1). On the other hand, P(1) is true
and Q(1) is false. Therefore, P(1) ∧Q(1) is false.
We have seen that the only integers n for which Q(n) is false are n = 0, n = 1 and n = 2.
However, P(0) and P(1) are both true. Therefore, P(n) ∨Q(n) is a true statement for n = 0
and n = 1. Since P(2) and Q(2) are both false, P(2) ∨Q(2) is false.
We have observed that P(n) is true for n = 0 and n = 1, while Q(n) is false for these values
of n. Therefore, both P(0) ⊕Q(0) and P(1) ⊕Q(1) are true statements. Since P(n) and
Q(n) are both true for n = −1 and both false for n = 2, it follows that P(−1) ⊕Q(−1) and
P(2) ⊕Q(2) are false statements.
♦
Compound Statements
The operations ∼, ∧, ∨and ⊕are examples of logical connectives. We will see other logical
connectives shortly. A compound statement is a statement constructed from one or more given
statements (called component statements in this context) and one or more logical connectives.
For example, P ∧Q and P ∨Q can be considered as compound statements expressed in terms of the
component statements P and Q.
If R and S are compound statements constructed from one or more logical connectives and from
the two component statements P and Q, say, then once we know the truth value of each of P and
Q, the truth value of each of R and S can be determined. If we should ﬁnd that the truth values
of R and S are the same for each combination of truth values of P and Q, then this is of special
interest to us.
Deﬁnition 1.21
Two compound statements R and S constructed from the same component state-
ments are called logically equivalent if R and S have the same truth value for all combinations
of truth values of their component statements. If R and S are logically equivalent, then we write
R ≡S; while if R and S are not logically equivalent, then we write R ̸≡S.
You might have noticed that P ∧Q and Q ∧P have the same truth value for each combination
of truth values of the two statements P and Q. The same can be said for P ∨Q and Q ∨P. The
observations concerning P ∧Q and Q ∧P as well as P ∨Q and Q ∨P provide us with two laws
of logic, which are veriﬁed by the truth tables shown in Figure 1.6. These two laws are expressed
below.
Theorem 1.22
(Commutative Laws) For every two statements P and Q,
P ∧Q ≡Q ∧P and P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P.

It follows by Theorem 1.22 therefore that if P(n) and Q(n) are open sentences over some domain
S, then for each value of n in S, the truth value of P(n) ∧Q(n) is the same as the truth value of
Q(n) ∧P(n). A similar remark holds for P(n) ∨Q(n) and Q(n) ∨P(n).

1.2. NEGATION, CONJUNCTION AND DISJUNCTION

Example 1.23
According to the commutative law of disjunction, there is no diﬀerence (in terms of logic) between
saying (or writing)
n3 + 2n is even or n2 −4 < 0
and saying (or writing)
n2 −4 < 0 or n3 + 2n is even.
♦
De Morgan’s Laws
There are two extremely useful laws of logic that combine all three of the logical connectives
negation, disjunction and conjunction. These laws, called De Morgan’s Laws, are named for Augus-
tus De Morgan, a famous mathematician of the mid-19th century. We will encounter him again but
for the present, we are most interested in laws of logic associated with him.
Theorem 1.24
(De Morgan’s Laws) For every two statements P and Q,
(a) ∼(P ∨Q) ≡(∼P) ∧(∼Q).
(b) ∼(P ∧Q) ≡(∼P) ∨(∼Q).
These laws can be veriﬁed quite simply by means of truth tables. The ﬁrst of these laws is
established in Figure 1.7. The entries in the columns headed by ∼(P ∨Q) and (∼P) ∧(∼Q) are
in bold to call attention to these columns, which establish the logical equivalence.

For two integers a and b, consider the two sentences
P: a is odd.
Q: b is odd.
(1) State the disjunction P ∨Q of P and Q.
(2) State the negation ∼(P ∨Q) of P ∨Q by using the phrase “it is not the case that.”
(3) Use an appropriate De Morgan’s Law to restate ∼(P ∨Q).
(4) State the conjunction P ∧Q of P and Q.
(5) State the negation ∼(P ∧Q) of P ∧Q by using the phrase “it is not the case that.”
(6) Use an appropriate De Morgan’s Law to restate ∼(P ∧Q).
Solution.
(1) The disjunction of P and Q is
P ∨Q: a is odd or b is odd. (or: Either a or b is odd.)
(2) The negation of P ∨Q is
∼(P ∨Q): It is not the case that a is odd or b is odd.
(3) By De Morgan’s Laws,
∼(P ∨Q) ≡(∼P) ∧(∼Q): a is not odd and b is not odd.
(or: Both a and b are even.)
(4) The conjunction of P and Q is
P ∧Q: a is odd and b is odd. (or: Both a and b are odd.)
(5) The negation of P ∧Q is
∼(P ∧Q): It is not the case that both a and b are odd.
(6) By De Morgan’s Laws,
∼(P ∧Q) ≡(∼P) ∨(∼Q): a is not odd or b is not odd.
(or: Either a or b is even.) ♦
Example 1.27
For a real number x, let P(x) : x2 −8x + 15 = 0.
(a) Use the word “or” to describe those real numbers x for which P(x) is true.
(b) Use De Morgan’s Laws to describe those real numbers x for which P(x) is false.
Solution. Let x be a real number. Observe that x2 −8x + 15 = (x −3)(x −5).

Not surprisingly, for any statement P, the statements P and ∼(∼P) are logically equivalent.
As expected, this can be veriﬁed by means of a truth table (see Figure 1.8). This fact is stated below
as a theorem.

Theorem 1.28

(1) Either he’s not checking his email or he’s not answering his email.
(2) This summer, she is neither buying an iPhone nor an iPad.
Solution.
(1) He checks and answers his email.
(2) The sentence above can also be written as follows: This summer, she is not buying an iPhone
and not buying an iPad. Thus its negation is: This summer, she is either buying an iPhone
or an iPad.
♦
We have seen that truth tables can be used to verify that two compound statements are logically
equivalent. On the other hand, there are instances when we may be able to use some known facts
to verify that two compound statements are logically equivalent.
Example 1.30
Let P and Q be two statements. Use De Morgan’s Laws and Theorem 1.28 to verify that
(1) ∼(P ∨(∼Q)) ≡(∼P) ∧Q.
(2) ∼((∼P) ∧(∼Q)) ≡P ∨Q.
Solution.
(1) By De Morgan’s Law (Theorem 1.24(a)),
∼(P ∨(∼Q)) ≡(∼P) ∧(∼(∼Q))
and by Theorem 1.28,
∼(∼Q) ≡Q.

22
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Therefore,
∼(P ∨(∼Q)) ≡(∼P) ∧(∼(∼Q)) ≡(∼P) ∧Q.
(2) Proceeding as in (1), we have
∼((∼P) ∧(∼Q))
≡
(∼(∼P)) ∨(∼(∼Q))
by De Morgan’s Law (Theorem 1.24(b))
≡
P ∨Q
by Theorem 1.28. ♦
For every two real numbers a and b, the sum a + b and product ab are also real numbers. For
this reason, addition and multiplication are referred to as binary operations on the collection of
real numbers. Both addition and multiplication are commutative. That is,
a + b = b + a and ab = ba
for every two real numbers a and b. Conjunction and disjunction are also binary operations on a
collection of statements. (The “exclusive or” is also a binary operation.) In fact, by Theorem 1.22
conjunction and disjunction are commutative since
P ∧Q ≡Q ∧P and P ∨Q ≡Q ∨P
for every two statements P and Q.
Associative and Distributive Laws
Since addition and multiplication of real numbers are associative, that is,
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c and a(bc) = (ab)c
for all real numbers a, b and c, there is no confusion in writing a+b+c and abc without parentheses.
Furthermore, the distributive law holds, namely
a(b + c) = ab + ac
for all real numbers a, b and c. These properties of addition and multiplication of real numbers
suggest logical equivalences of statements involving conjunction and disjunction.
Theorem 1.31
Let P, Q and R be three statements. Then
(a) (Associative Laws)
P ∨(Q ∨R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∨R and P ∧(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∧Q) ∧R.
(b) (Distributive Laws)
P ∨(Q ∧R) ≡(P ∨Q) ∧(P ∨R) and P ∧(Q ∨R) ≡(P ∧Q) ∨(P ∧R).
So there are two distributive laws in this case. Each of the laws in Theorem 1.31 can be veriﬁed
by truth tables (see Exercise 16). Here too, because of the associative laws, if P, Q and R are
three statements, then P ∧Q ∧R and P ∨Q ∨R can be written without parentheses. In fact,
for any integer k ≥3 and any k statements P1, P2, . . . , Pk, we can write P1 ∧P2 ∧· · · ∧Pk as the
conjunction of the statements and P1 ∨P2 ∨· · · ∨Pk as the disjunction of these k statements.
The statement P1 ∧P2 ∧· · · ∧Pk is true only when all of the statements P1, P2, . . . , Pk are true,
while P1 ∨P2 ∨· · · ∨Pk is true only when at least one of the statements P1, P2, . . . , Pk is true.
Example 1.32
For real numbers x and y, consider the following open sentence

1.2. NEGATION, CONJUNCTION AND DISJUNCTION
23
P(x, y): x2 + (y2 −4)2 = 0.
Since x2 ≥0 and (y2 −4)2 ≥0 for all real numbers x and y, we can only have x2 + (y2 −4)2 = 0
when both x2 = 0 and (y2 −4)2 = 0. The equation x2 = 0 has only one solution, namely x = 0;
while (y2 −4)2 = 0 has two solutions, namely y = 2 and y = −2. Therefore, x2 + (y2 −4)2 = 0 only
when x = 0 and either y = 2 or y = −2. That is, P(x, y) is true only when x = 0 and either y = 2
or y = −2. By the second distributive law in Theorem 1.31, P(x, y) is true only when x = 0 and
y = 2, or when x = 0 and y = −2.

1.3
Implications
The compound statement of greatest interest to us is the implication.
We will see that many
theorems are expressed (or can be expressed) as implications.
Deﬁnition 1.33 For two statements P and Q, the implication P ⇒Q is commonly written as
If P, then Q.
An implication is also sometimes referred to as a conditional. The statement P in the implication
P ⇒Q is the hypothesis of P ⇒Q, while Q is the conclusion of P ⇒Q.
Implications often occur in everyday communication:
(1) If he gets a promotion, then we’ll all go out to dinner.
(2) If we score a touchdown, then we’ll win the game.
(3) If this jacket is on sale, then I’ll buy it.

26
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
(4) If he complains one more time, then I’ll scream.
In (1) above, a condition is given under which we will go out to dinner, namely, if this person gets a
promotion. If statement (1) is true and the individual gets a promotion, then we will all go out to
dinner. This statement would be false if he got a promotion but we didn’t go out to dinner. This is
the only situation that would make statement (1) false. Consequently, if he doesn’t get a promotion,
then whether we go out to dinner or not, statement (1) would be true. Similar discussions can be
made about implications (2)–(4) above.
For two statements P and Q, the truth table for P ⇒Q is deﬁned in Figure 1.9. According to
this truth table, we see that:
(i) if the hypothesis P is false, then P ⇒Q is true regardless of the truth value of Q;
(ii) if the conclusion Q is true, then P ⇒Q is true regardless of the truth value of P;
(iii) P ⇒Q is false only when the hypothesis P is true and the conclusion Q is false.

Figure 1.9: The truth table for implication
For the statements Q1 and Q2 in (1.1), the implication Q1 ⇒Q2 is
Q1 ⇒Q2 : If Los Angeles is the capital of California,
then Broadway is a street in New York City.
Since the statement Q1 is a false statement and Q2 is true, it follows from the third row of the
truth table in Figure 1.9 that Q1 ⇒Q2 is true. Of course, the explanation we just gave for why
Q1 ⇒Q2 is a true statement relies on the truth table for implication. It may seem that this is a
peculiar way to deﬁne when an implication is true and when it is false. However, we might think
of this truth table as describing conditions under which the contract “If P, then Q” holds. What
this says is that if condition P is satisﬁed, then the contract speciﬁes that condition Q must be
satisﬁed as well. Therefore, the only time this contract will be broken is when P is satisﬁed but Q
is not. This is precisely what the truth table for implication speciﬁes. While there is no apparent
connection between the statements Q1 and Q2 in the implication Q1 ⇒Q2 above, there is ordinarily
a connection between statements P and Q whether P ⇒Q is encountered in mathematics or, indeed,
in everyday conversation.

A man hires a neighbor to paint the living room of his house for $300. The neighbor says:
If you pay me an additional $50, then I will also paint your dining room.
(1.2)
We now consider the following two statements:
P: You pay me an additional $50.
Q: I will also paint your dining room.

1.3. IMPLICATIONS
27
Let’s consider the truth or falseness of the implication P ⇒Q in (1.2) for the possible combinations
of truth values of P and Q.
Suppose that P and Q are both true. Then the man pays the neighbor an additional $50 and the
neighbor paints the dining room. Since the neighbor did as he promised, the (verbal) contract has
been fulﬁlled and so P ⇒Q is true, which agrees with the ﬁrst row of the truth table in Figure 1.9.
Second, suppose that P is true and Q is false.
In this case, the man pays the neighbor an
additional $50 but the neighbor does not paint the dining room. The neighbor clearly did not do as
he promised. Thus the contract is broken and P ⇒Q is false. This agrees with the second row of
the truth table for P ⇒Q.
Next, suppose that P is false and Q is true. Here the man does not pay the neighbor an additional
$50, yet the neighbor paints the dining room. Why? Perhaps it was a gesture of friendship. In any
case, the contract is not broken as nothing was promised if the man did not pay the neighbor an
additional $50. This agrees with the third row of the truth table for P ⇒Q.
Finally, suppose that P and Q are both false. In this case, the man does not pay the neighbor
an additional $50 and the neighbor does not paint the dining room. The neighbor undoubtedly did
exactly as the man expected. Here too nothing was promised if no additional money was paid. So
here too the contract was not broken and P ⇒Q is true. This agrees with the fourth row of the
truth table for P ⇒Q.
♦
Let’s now look at the truth and falseness of some speciﬁc implications from mathematics.
Example 1.35
Determine the truth value of each of the following implications.
(a) If 2 + 3 = 5, then 4 + 6 = 10.
(b) If 4 + 6 = 10, then 5 + 7 = 14.
(c) If 5 + 7 = 14, then 6 + 9 = 15.
(d) If 8 + 11 = 21, then 12 + 14 = 28.
Solution.
(a) “If 2 + 3 = 5, then 4 + 6 = 10” reduces to: If T , then T . This is a true implication according
to the ﬁrst row of the truth table in Figure 1.9.
(b) “If 4 + 6 = 10, then 5 + 7 = 14” reduces to: If T , then F. According to the second row of the
truth table in Figure 1.9, this implication is false.
(c) “If 5 + 7 = 14, then 6 + 9 = 15” reduces to: If F, then T . By the third row of the truth table
in Figure 1.9, this implication is true.
(d) “If 8+11 = 21, then 12+14 = 28” reduces to: If F, then F. This implication is true according
to the fourth row of the truth table in Figure 1.9.
We could have also determined the truth of (a), (c) and (d) above more quickly. As we have
mentioned, if P is false, then P ⇒Q is true regardless of the truth value of Q; while if Q is true,
then P ⇒Q is true regardless of the truth value of P. Therefore, the implications in (a), (c) and
(d) are true. Furthermore, as we mentioned, the only situation under which P ⇒Q is false is when
P is true and Q is false. Therefore, (b) is false.
♦
We have mentioned that if P and Q are statements, then P ⇒Q is also a statement and therefore
has a truth value (which, of course, depends on the truth values of P and Q). Since it is possible
to consider the negation of an open sentence as well as the disjunction and conjunction of two open
sentences, it should come as no surprise that we can consider P ⇒Q when P and Q are open
sentences.

28
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Example 1.36
For a real number x, consider the two open sentences
P(x): x −2 = 0.
Q(x): x2 −x −2 = 0.
Investigate, for all real numbers x, the truth or falseness of the implication
P(x) ⇒Q(x): If x −2 = 0, then x2 −x −2 = 0.
Solution. The only real number x for which P(x) is true is x = 2, that is, P(2) is true. Notice
that Q(2) is also true. Since P(2) and Q(2) are both true, it follows that P(2) ⇒Q(2) is a true
statement according to the ﬁrst row of the truth table in Figure 1.9. If we were to select a diﬀerent
real number x, then P(x) would be false. In this case, by the third and fourth rows of the truth
table in Figure 1.9, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true regardless of the truth value of Q(x) for the real number x
under consideration. That is, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true for every real number x.
♦
We will be especially interested in implications P(x) ⇒Q(x) that are true for every object in
the domain of the variable x and will examine this relationship in detail in Chapter 3.
Example 1.37
For a real number x, consider
P(x): x2 −9 = 0.
Q(x): (x −3)2 = 0.
Investigate, for all real numbers x, the truth or falseness of the implication
P(x) ⇒Q(x): If x2 −9 = 0, then (x −3)2 = 0.
Solution. First observe that P(x) is true only when x = 3 or x = −3. However, Q(3) is true, while
Q(−3) is false. Thus P(3) ⇒Q(3) is true and P(−3) ⇒Q(−3) is false. If x is any real number that
is diﬀerent from 3 and −3, then P(x) is false and so P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true. Therefore, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
is true for every real number except for x = −3.
♦
Stating Implications in Words
We have already mentioned that for statements (or open sentences) P and Q, the implication
P ⇒Q can be expressed in words as: If P, then Q. This implication can also be expressed in a
variety of other ways. First, a slight variation of “If P, then Q” is “Q if P.” However, P ⇒Q can
also be expressed as “P implies Q.” Indeed, common ways of expressing P ⇒Q in words are listed
in Figure 1.10.
P ⇒Q
If P, then Q
Q if P
P implies Q
P only if Q
P is suﬃcient for Q
Q is necessary for P
Figure 1.10: Expressing P ⇒Q in words
Perhaps the most surprising entry in Figure 1.10 to express the implication P ⇒Q in words is “P
only if Q.” Nevertheless, this is correct. For example, suppose that the Department of Mathematics
has sign-up sheets for students who plan to take certain mathematics courses next semester. Above
one sheet lying on a table is the following notice:

1.3. IMPLICATIONS
29
You should sign this sheet only if you plan to take discrete mathematics next semester.
What this means is that if you sign your name on the sheet, then you plan to take the course.
Example 1.38
Of course, if I obtained all A’s last semester and took a math course last semester, then I must
have received an A in math as well. Let’s state this implication in the various ways indicated in
Figure 1.10.
If I obtained all A’s, then I received an A in math.
I received an A in math if I obtained all A’s.
Obtaining all A’s implies that I received an A in math.
I obtained all A’s only if I received an A in math.
Obtaining all A’s is suﬃcient for receiving an A in math.
Receiving an A in math is necessary for obtaining all A’s.
In particular, the fourth sentence says that the only way I can obtain an A in all courses is to receive
an A in math.
♦
Let’s look at a mathematical example where an implication is involved and restate this implication
in the manners suggested in Figure 1.10.
Example 1.39
For a real number x, let
P(x): x = 5.
Q(x): x2 = 25.
Express the implication P(x) ⇒Q(x) in words in a variety of ways.
Solution. According to the table in Figure 1.10, this implication can be expressed as follows:
If x = 5, then x2 = 25.
x2 = 25 if x = 5.
x = 5 implies that x2 = 25.
x = 5 only if x2 = 25.
x = 5 is suﬃcient for x2 = 25.
x2 = 25 is necessary for x = 5. ♦
Example 1.40
Express each of the following implications as an “If, then” sentence.
(a) |a| = 2 is suﬃcient for a4 = 16.
(b) My team is going to the Super Bowl if they win their next game.
(c) I do well on an exam only if I studied for it.
(d) Not doing well this semester implies that I took too many courses.
(e) Doing well in math in necessary for me to have a good semester.
Solution.
(a) If |a| = 2, then a4 = 16.
(b) If my team wins their next game, then they’re going to the Super Bowl.

30
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
(c) If I do well on an exam, then I studied for it.
(d) If I don’t do well this semester, then I took too many courses.
(e) If I had a good semester, then I did well in math.
♦
Converse of an Implication
For two given statements P and Q, we can construct not only the implication P ⇒Q but the
implication Q ⇒P as well.
Deﬁnition 1.41
For statements (or open sentences) P and Q, the implication Q ⇒P is called
the converse of P ⇒Q.
Let’s look at the converses of the implications (1) – (4) stated at the beginning of this section.
(1’) If we all go out to dinner, then he gets a promotion.
(2’) If we win the game, then we score a touchdown.
(3’) If I buy this jacket, then it is on sale.
(4’) If I scream, then he will complain one more time.
Example 1.42
Recall once again the two statements Q1 and Q2 in (1.1):
Q1: Los Angeles is the capital of California.
Q2: Broadway is a street in New York City.
We have already noted that the implication
Q1 ⇒Q2 : If Los Angeles is the capital of California,
then Broadway is a street in New York City.
is a true statement. However, according to the truth table in Figure 1.9, its converse
Q2 ⇒Q1 : If Broadway is a street in New York City,
then Los Angeles is the capital of California.
is false because here the hypothesis Q2 is true and the conclusion Q1 is false.
♦
Therefore, the implication Q2 ⇒Q1 above is the converse of Q1 ⇒Q2. In addition, Q1 ⇒Q2 is
the converse of Q2 ⇒Q1. What this shows is that for two statements P and Q, the two implications
P ⇒Q and Q ⇒P need not have the same truth value. If we think about this observation a bit,
we should be able to convince ourselves that if P and Q are two statements for which P ⇒Q and
Q ⇒P have the same truth value, then this truth value must be true (see Exercise 9).
Example 1.43
For a real number x, consider the two open sentences:
P(x): (x −1)(x −2) = 0.
Q(x): (x −2)(x −3) = 0.

1.3. IMPLICATIONS
31
Let’s look at the implication P(x) ⇒Q(x) for x = 1, say. Then P(1) is true, while Q(1) is false.
Hence P(1) ⇒Q(1) is a false statement. Let’s consider the converse of P(x) ⇒Q(x) for x = 3
say. Then Q(3) is true but P(3) is false; so Q(3) ⇒P(3) is false. However, both P(2) ⇒Q(2) and
Q(2) ⇒P(2) are true.
♦
Contrapositive of an Implication
We will have numerous opportunities to consider the converse of an implication. In fact, there
will be many occasions when we will want to consider both an implication and its converse. For
statements (or open sentences) P and Q, there is another implication that is related to P ⇒Q and
in which we will be greatly interested.
Deﬁnition 1.44
For two statements (or open sentences) P and Q, the contrapositive of the
implication P ⇒Q is (∼Q) ⇒(∼P).
Example 1.45
For the two statements Q1 and Q2 in (1.1), the contrapositive of Q1 ⇒Q2 is
(∼Q2) ⇒(∼Q1) : If Broadway is not a street in New York City,
then Los Angeles is not the capital of California. ♦
Just as Q1 ⇒Q2 is a true statement, so too is (∼Q2) ⇒(∼Q1). This is, in fact, what happens
for every true implication P ⇒Q formed from statements P and Q. This is the reason that the
contrapositive of an implication interests us so much.
Theorem 1.46
For every two statements P and Q,
P ⇒Q ≡(∼Q) ⇒(∼P).
That the two implications P ⇒Q and (∼Q) ⇒(∼P) are logically equivalent is veriﬁed in the
truth table shown in Figure 1.11.

Example 1.47
For an integer n, consider the two open sentences
P(n): 3n + 11 is even.
Q(n): n is odd.
Then for a speciﬁc integer n, the implication
P(n) ⇒Q(n): If 3n + 11 is even, then n is odd.

(∼Q(n)) ⇒(∼P(n)): If n is not odd, then 3n + 11 is not even.
(or: If n is even, then 3n + 11 is odd.) are both true or both false.
♦
For statements P and Q, the implication P ⇒Q is also logically equivalent to a statement that
does not involve an implication.
Theorem 1.48
For every two statements P and Q,
P ⇒Q ≡(∼P) ∨Q.
That the statements P ⇒Q and (∼P) ∨Q are logically equivalent is veriﬁed in the truth table
in Figure 1.12.

Example 1.49
For the two statements
P: You don’t love me.
Q: You must leave me.
the implication P ⇒Q is
P ⇒Q: If you don’t love me, then you must leave me.
According to Theorem 1.48, this implication is logically equivalent to
(∼P) ∨Q: Either you love me or you must leave me.
which results in
(∼P) ∨Q: Love me or leave me. ♦
There is now an immediate consequence of Theorem 1.48.
Theorem 1.50
For every two statements P and Q,
∼(P ⇒Q) ≡P ∧(∼Q).
We could verify Theorem 1.50 by means of a truth table, but it can also be veriﬁed using the
information we have:
∼(P ⇒Q)
≡
∼((∼P) ∨Q)
by Theorem 1.48
≡
(∼(∼P)) ∧(∼Q)
by De Morgan’s Law (Theorem 1.24(a))
≡

by Theorem 1.28.
Therefore, ∼(P ⇒Q) ≡P ∧(∼Q).

Biconditionals
There is a concert coming to Henry’s town that he would like to attend but he thinks it’s likely to
be too expensive for his budget. In fact, he’s decided that he will go if it costs him less than $25
and that’s the only way he would go. So
If it costs Henry less than $25 to attend the concert, then he will go.
(1.3)
Also,
If Henry attends the concert, then it cost him less than $25.
(1.4)
In this case then:
Henry will attend the concert if and only if it costs him less than $25.
(1.5)
If and only if
The sentence (1.5) is the conjunction of the implication (1.3) and its converse (1.4). In mathe-
matics such sentences are encountered often. We will discuss these kinds of sentences in this section.
Deﬁnition 1.52
For two statements P and Q, the biconditional of P and Q is the conjunction
of the implication P ⇒Q and its converse Q ⇒P. The biconditional of P and Q is denoted by
P ⇔Q. So P ⇔Q is the statement (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P).
The biconditional P ⇔Q is expressed in words as
P if and only if Q.
or
P is necessary and suﬃcient for Q.

Figure 1.13: The truth table for the biconditional
Because of the way P ⇔Q is deﬁned, we can determine the truth table for this statement
ourselves, as shown in Figure 1.13. Therefore, P ⇔Q is true provided that P and Q have the same
truth value; that is, P ⇔Q is true only when P and Q are both true or are both false. Let’s consider
an example of a biconditional.
Example 1.53
For the statements
P: 32 > 23.
Q: 43 > 34.
the biconditional of these statements is
P ⇔Q: 32 > 23 if and only if 43 > 34.
Since P is true and Q is false, P and Q have diﬀerent truth values and so P ⇔Q is false.
♦
Example 1.54
Consider the following two statements:
P: I will receive an A on the exam.
Q: I study for at least 10 hours.
Then the biconditional of P and Q is
P ⇔Q: I will receive an A on the exam if and only if I study for at least 10 hours.
The statement P ⇔Q is therefore true provided either
(a) I study for at least 10 hours and receive an A on the exam or
(b) I study for less than 10 hours and do not receive an A on the exam.
♦
There is a logical explanation as to why P ⇔Q can be expressed in words as “P if and only
if Q.” Since P ⇔Q is deﬁned as the statement (P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) and the commutative law of
conjunction holds (by Theorem 1.22), it follows that
(P ⇒Q) ∧(Q ⇒P) ≡(Q ⇒P) ∧(P ⇒Q).
Recall that Q ⇒P can be expressed in words as “P if Q” and P ⇒Q can be expressed in words as
“P only if Q.” Therefore, we can express P ⇔Q in words as
P if Q and P only if Q
or as
P if and only if Q.

38
CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Many mathematicians abbreviate “if and only if” as “iﬀ,” which, of course, is not a word. However,
since this abbreviation is so common, we should be aware of it. In a similar way, there is a logical
explanation as to why P ⇔Q can be expressed as “P is necessary and suﬃcient for Q” (see
Exercise 11). We can also consider P ⇔Q when P and Q are open sentences.
Example 1.55
For an integer n, consider the two open sentences
P(n): (n −1)2 = 0.
Q(n): 7n −3 = 0.
The biconditional of these two open sentences is
P(n) ⇔Q(n): (n −1)2 = 0 if and only if 7n −3 = 0.
Investigate the truth or falseness of P(n) ⇔Q(n) for various integers n.
Solution. First, P(n) is true only when n = 1. Since Q(1) is false, P(1) ⇔Q(1) is false. For an
integer n ̸= 1, P(n) is false. However, Q(n) is false for every integer n. Therefore, for n ̸= 1, both
implications P(n) and Q(n) are false and so P(n) ⇔Q(n) is true.

We now look at two examples of biconditionals dealing with triangles.
Example 1.56
A triangle is equilateral if its three sides have the same length; while a triangle is equiangular if its
three angles have the same measure (namely 60o or π/3 radians). The converse of the implication
If a triangle is equilateral, then it is equiangular.
is the implication
If a triangle is equiangular, then it is equilateral.
The conjunction of these two implications gives us the biconditional
A triangle is equilateral if and only if it is equiangular. ♦
Example 1.57
A triangle is a right triangle if one of its angles is a right angle (namely, 90o or π/2 radians). The
well-known Pythagorean theorem can be stated as
If a, b and c are the lengths of the three sides of a right triangle, where a ≤b ≤c, then
a2 + b2 = c2.
Its converse is the implication:
If the lengths of the three sides of a triangle are a, b and c, where a ≤b ≤c and
a2 + b2 = c2, then the triangle is a right triangle.
The conjunction of these two implications is a biconditional:
Let a, b and c be the lengths of the three sides of a triangle T , where a ≤b ≤c. Then T
is a right triangle if and only if a2 + b2 = c2.
♦
Example 1.58
Suppose that P and Q are two statements such that P ⇒Q is true and Q ⇒P is false. Investigate
the truth or falseness of the biconditional P if and only if Q.
Solution. Since the biconditional

1.4. BICONDITIONALS
39
P ⇔Q: P if and only if Q
is the conjunction of P ⇒Q and Q ⇒P, it follows that P ⇔Q is true only when both P ⇒Q and
Q ⇒P are true. Since this is not the case, P ⇔Q is false.

Tautologies and Contradictions
We have now seen the following logical connectives:
∼
negation (not)
∧
conjunction (and)
∨
disjunction (or)
⊕
exclusive or
⇒
implication (implies)
⇔
biconditional (if and only if).
Recall that a compound statement is a statement constructed from one or more given statements
(the component statements) and one or more logical connectives. Ordinarily, a compound state-
ment is true for some combinations of truth values of its component statements and false for other
combinations of truth values of its component statements – but not always.
Deﬁnition 1.59
A compound statement is a tautology if it is true for all possible combinations
of truth values of its component statements.
Deﬁnition 1.60 A compound statement is a contradiction if it is false for all possible combina-
tions of the truth values of its component statements.
Therefore, a compound statement S is a tautology if and only if its negation ∼S is a contra-
diction. The simplest examples of a tautology and a contradiction are constructed from a single
component statement.
For every statement P, the statement P ∨(∼P) is a tautology since certainly (exactly) one of
P and ∼P is true. In fact, because one of P and ∼P is also false, the statement P ∧(∼P) is a
contradiction. These are veriﬁed in the truth table of Figure 1.14, where the entries in the columns
headed by P ∨(∼P) and P ∧(∼P) are in bold to call attention to the resulting tautology and
contradiction, respectively.

Furthermore, for any two logically equivalent compound statements R and S, the biconditional
R ⇔S is a tautology.

The tautology
(P ∧(P ⇒Q)) ⇒Q
considered in Example 1.64 is called modus ponens (mode that aﬃrms the hypothesis) in logic.
We will encounter this tautology in Chapter 3, as well as the tautology
((P ⇒Q) ∧(∼Q)) ⇒(∼P),
which is called modus tollens (mode that denies the conclusion). (See Exercise 5.)

Some Applications of Logic
The Scottish-born author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is best known for his famous ﬁctional detective
Sherlock Holmes who would often use his skillful reasoning and astute observations to solve a criminal
case he was investigating. He would announce how he arrived at his conclusion by uttering “It’s
elementary, my dear Watson.” to his friend and associate Dr. John Watson. While Holmes used
logic to solve diﬃcut cases, our goal is to use logic to solve problems and to understand mathematical
explanations. In this section we present a few examples of problems to see how logic can be used to
ﬁnd solutions.
Example 1.65
Your friend knows the truth value of a certain statement P but you don’t. For every statement
constructed from P, your friend promises always to give the correct truth value or always to give
the incorrect truth value. That is, your friend will always be truthful or will always lie. Show that
you can determine the truth value of P by giving two statements to your friend.
Solution. Notice that it wouldn’t be useful to give the statement P itself to your friend, for,
regardless of how your friend responded, we wouldn’t know if it’s the truth or a lie. First, give your
friend a statement whose truth value is known to you. For example, give your friend the statement
P ∨(∼P). Since this is a tautology and is therefore true, you will learn instantly whether your
friend is always being truthful or is always lying. Once you know this, then give your friend the
statement P.

CHAPTER 1. LOGIC
Example 1.66
Lieutenant Klumbo of the Los Angeles Police Department has spent the day interrogating four
suspects in a murder case: Adams, Benjamin, Carter, Dickens. Each claims that he has an airtight
alibi for the night the murder took place as each says that he was in Las Vegas that night (not in
Los Angeles where the murder took place). At the end of the day, Lieutenant Klumbo has learned
the following:
(1) If Adams went to Las Vegas, so did Benjamin.
(2) Benjamin and Carter did not both go to Las Vegas.
(3) If Carter went to Las Vegas, then Adams stayed in Los Angeles.
(4) Carter and Dickens did not both stay in Los Angeles.
(5) If Adams stayed in Los Angeles, so did Dickens.
(6) If Dickens went to Las Vegas, then Benjamin stayed in Los Angeles.
At the end of the day, Lieutenant Klumbo decides to release one of the four suspects. Which one
and why?
Solution. Lieutenant Klumbo releases Carter.
(i) Suppose ﬁrst that Benjamin went to Las Vegas. Then Carter did not go to Las Vegas. So
Dickens did, implying that Benjamin stayed in Los Angeles and producing a contradiction.
(ii) Suppose next that Adams went to Las Vegas. Then Benjamin went to Las Vegas. By (i), a
contradiction occurs.
(iii) Suppose next that Dickens went to Las Vegas. Then Benjamin stayed in Los Angeles and so
did Adams. However, then Dickens stayed in Los Angeles as well, producing a contradiction.
Therefore, a contradiction is produced for each of Benjamin, Adams and Dickens. That is, each has
been caught in a lie. There is no such problem for Carter, however.

Example 1.67
The defendant in a trial has been accused of a robbery. During the trial, the prosecutor announces:
If the defendant committed the robbery, then he had an accomplice.
Upon hearing this, the defense attorney jumps to his feet and cries out:
That’s a lie!
Determine which of the following is true.
(i) The jury in the trial should ﬁnd the defendant guilty.
(ii) The jury in the trial should ﬁnd the defendant not guilty.
(iii) The jury in the trial does not have enough information to reach a verdict.
Solution. (i) is true. If we let
P: The defendant committed the robbery.
Q: He had an accomplice.

1.6. SOME APPLICATIONS OF LOGIC
45
then the prosecutor states the implication P ⇒Q. The defense attorney therefore proclaims that
the implication P ⇒Q is false. The only way this can occur is if P is true and Q is false. However,
since P is true, the defendant committed the robbery. Furthermore, since Q is false, he committed
the robbery by himself. So the jury should ﬁnd the defendant guilty (and the defendant should ﬁre
the defense attorney).

Example 1.68
You are given two wicks (the wicks only, not as parts of candles), each of which takes one hour to
burn completely and neither of which burns at a constant rate. How can these wicks be used to
determine when 45 minutes has elapsed?
Solution. Light both ends of wick #1 and one end of wick #2 at the same time. When wick #1
is completely burned, 30 minutes have elapsed and at that instant light the other end of wick #2.
When wick #2 is completely burned, 45 minutes have elapsed.

Exercises for Section 1.6
1. You are given three wicks (the wicks only, not as parts of candles), each of which takes 80
minutes to burn completely but none of which burns at a constant rate. How can these wicks
be used to determine when an hour and a half has elapsed?
2. There are three light switches on a wall, each of which operates one of three light bulbs in a
room. This room can only be entered and seen from a doorway that is a few steps from the
location of the light switches. All light switches are in the down position and so all light bulbs
are dark. When one of the light switches is moved to the up position, one of the light bulbs
is lit; however, we don’t know which light switch operates which light bulb since the room
cannot be seen from this location. Show that it is possible to determine the light switch that
operates each light bulb by entering the room exactly once.
3. You are given a balance scale and eight coins, one of which is counterfeit and weighs less than
the other coins. How can the counterfeit coin be determined in two weighings. [Problems of
this nature will also be explored in more detail in Section 13.2, Chapter 13.]
4. After dividing a collection of coins into two groups, it is observed that 75 times the diﬀerence
between the number of coins in each group equals the diﬀerence of the squares of these two
numbers. How many coins are in the collection?
5. At a party, Charlie asks two friends to give him an example of an integer. He notices that the
sum of one of these numbers and the square of the other gives the same result. Are these two
numbers equal?
6. Figure 1.18 shows a 5 × 5 checkerboard whose 25 squares are labeled by 1, 2, . . ., 25. A coin
placed on one of the squares can be moved to any adjacent square in the same row or column
of the ﬁrst square. For example, if a coin is placed on square 6, then the coin can be moved to
square 1, 7 or 11. Determine whether the 25 squares can be listed in some order so that it is
possible to move the coin from each square on the list to the next square on the list and then
move the coin from the last square on the list back to the ﬁrst square on the list.

Chapter 2
Sets
One of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics is that of a set.
The study of sets and
their properties is a subject in itself, namely set theory. The history of set theory is unlike many
mathematical subjects.
The origins of many mathematical areas can often be traced back to a
number of mathematicians whose ideas over a relatively short period of time created the subject.
Set theory, however, is essentially the creation of a single individual: Georg Cantor.
Although
much of his work is beyond the scope of this book, we will nonetheless see some of his best known
discoveries in Chapter 5 (Section 5.5). In this chapter, however, we will be content to introduce the
basic concepts, notation and ideas of elementary set theory.
The importance of set theory is not only due to its usefulness in the foundation of discrete
mathematics but to its usefulness in all of modern mathematics.
2.1
Sets and Subsets
For our purposes, a set is a collection of objects. These objects, although often numbers of some
kind, have no restrictions on what they can be. The objects of a set are called the elements of the
set. We will see many ways to describe sets. Regardless of how a set is described, what is most
important is that its description should make it clear which elements it contains. If a set has just a
few elements, then the set is often described simply by listing its elements between braces, separated
by commas. For example, {x, y, z} is a set consisting of the three elements x, y and z. Normally, we
use a capital (upper case) letter to denote a set, such as A, B, C, S, X, Y or perhaps A1, A2, A3
and so on. We could therefore denote the set above by S = {x, y, z}. Typically, a general element
that belongs to a set is represented by a lower case letter. If a is an element of a set A, then we
write a ∈A. If b is not an element of A, we write b ̸∈A. Therefore, for the set S = {x, y, z}, x ∈S
but w /∈S.
Two sets A and B are equal, written A = B, if they consist of exactly the same elements. That
is, if A = B, then A and B are simply diﬀerent names for the same set. If A and B are not equal,
then we write A ̸= B. If A ̸= B, then at least one of these sets contains an element not belonging
to the other set. For example, if S = {x, y, z} and T = {w, x, y, z}, then S ̸= T since T contains an
element, namely w, that does not belong to S.
If a set is described by listing its elements, then the order in which the elements are listed does
not matter. For example,
S = {x, y, z} = {y, x, z} = {z, y, x}.
The set A = {1, 2, . . ., 100} consists of the ﬁrst one hundred positive integers and B = {2, 4, 6, . . .}
is the set of positive even integers. The three dots “. . .”, called an ellipsis, means “and so on up
to” for the set A and “and so on” for the set B.
53

54
CHAPTER 2. SETS
A set need not contain any elements. The set containing no elements is called the empty set.
(This set is sometimes called the null set or void set as well.) The empty set is denoted by ∅. Thus
∅= { }. A nonempty set therefore contains at least one element. For a ﬁnite set A (a set with a
ﬁnite number of elements), we write |A| to denote the number of elements in A. This is called the
cardinality of A. Therefore, the set S = {x, y, z} that we encountered earlier has cardinality 3 and
so |S| = 3.
Example 2.1
If A is the set of letters in the English alphabet and C is the set of playing cards in a standard deck
of cards, then |A| = 26 and |C| = 52.
♦
Example 2.2
Since the sets {∅} and ∅do not consist of the same elements, {∅} ̸= ∅. (An empty box and a box
containing an empty box are not the same thing.) The set {∅} has one element, namely the empty
set ∅and so |{∅}| = 1. However, ∅has no elements and so |∅| = 0.
♦
Example 2.3
The set A = {1, {1, 3}, ∅, a} has four elements, two of which are sets, namely {1, 3} and ∅. Since A
has four elements, its cardinality |A| equals 4.
♦
Well-Known Sets of Numbers
Some of the best known sets are inﬁnite sets of numbers (those containing an inﬁnite number of
elements) and many of these are denoted by a special symbol. For example, the set {. . ., −2, −1,
0, 1, 2, . . .} of integers is often denoted by Z. This symbol is used because Z is the ﬁrst letter of
the word Zahlen (the German word for numbers). The set of positive integers or natural numbers
is denoted by N. Thus N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}. (While historically 0 was not considered to be a natural
number, that issue became clouded in later years. Nevertheless, we continue to describe the set of
natural numbers by N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}.)
The set of real numbers is denoted by R and the set of positive real numbers is denoted by
R+. Although it is not easy to describe precisely what a real number is (indeed, the deﬁnition of a
real number is quite technical and involved), the real numbers consist of the rational numbers and
irrational numbers.
A rational number is the ratio a/b of two integers a and b, where b ̸= 0. The set of rational
numbers is denoted by Q (for the ﬁrst letter of the word quotient). An irrational number is a real
number that is not rational. Examples of irrational numbers are
√
2,
√
3,
3√
2 and π. The number
e, encountered throughout calculus, is also irrational. In particular,
0 ∈Z but 0 /∈N,
√
2 ∈R but
√
2 /∈Q,
3/2 ∈Q but 3/2 /∈Z.
We now consider another useful and common way to describe the elements that belong to a set.
For a given set S, let P(x) denote some open sentence involving elements x ∈S. Then the set
A = {x ∈S : P(x)}
describes the set of all those elements x ∈S for which P(x) is true. If the set S is clear or understood,
then A may also be written as
A = {x : P(x)}.

2.1. SETS AND SUBSETS
55
In the description of the set A, the colon is considered to mean “such that”, although some use a
vertical line for this purpose. That is,
A = {x ∈S | P(x)} = {x ∈S : P(x)} or A = {x | P(x)} = {x : P(x)}.
Example 2.4
The set
A = {n ∈Z : n2 ≤4}
consists of all those integers n such that n2 ≤4. Since the only integers whose squares are at most
4 are 0, ±1, ±2, it follows that A = {0, ±1, ±2}. Therefore,
A = {n ∈Z : n2 ≤4} = {n ∈Z | n2 ≤4} = {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}.
Also, A = {n ∈Z : |n| ≤2}.
♦
Example 2.5
Write each of the following sets by listing its elements.
A = {x ∈R : x2 −x −6 = 0} and B = {x ∈R : x2 + 1 = 0}.
Solution. The set A represents the set of (real number) solutions of the equation x2 −x −6 = 0.
Since x2 −x −6 = (x −3)(x + 2) = 0, it follows that A = {−2, 3}. Because the equation x2 + 1 = 0
has no real number solutions, B = { } = ∅.
♦
Subsets
Deﬁnition 2.6
A set A is called a subset of a set B, written A ⊆B, if every element of A also
belongs to B.
For example, N ⊆Z, Z ⊆Q and Q ⊆R. In particular, A ⊆A for every set A. If A is not a
subset of B, then we write A ̸⊆B. If A ̸⊆B, then there is some element of A that does not belong
to B. For every set A, the empty set ∅is also a subset of A. Let’s see why this is true. If this
weren’t so, then ∅̸⊆A would mean that there is some element in ∅that is not in A. However, ∅has
no elements. Thus, as we claimed, ∅⊆A for every set A.
Example 2.7
If A = {a, b, c} and B = {a, b, c, d, e}, then A ⊆B. For the sets C = {1, 2} and D = {1, 3}, we have
C ̸⊆D since 2 ∈C but 2 /∈D. Also, D ̸⊆C.
♦
Since two sets A and B are equal if they have precisely the same elements, this means that every
element of A belongs to B and every element of B belongs to A. That is,
A = B if and only if A ⊆B and B ⊆A.
Deﬁnition 2.8
A set A is a proper subset of a set B, written A ⊂B, if A ⊆B but A ̸= B.
Therefore, N ⊂Z, Z ⊂Q and Q ⊂R. If A is a subset of a set B and A is not a proper subset of
B, then necessarily A = B.

56
CHAPTER 2. SETS
Example 2.9
For the sets A = {a, b, c} and C = {a, b, c, d, e}, ﬁnd all sets B such that A ⊂B ⊂C.
Solution. The only sets B for which A ⊂B ⊂C are {a, b, c, d} and {a, b, c, e}.
♦
The use of the symbols ⊆and ⊂should remind you of the symbols ≤and < and the distinction
between them.
Nevertheless, there is some inconsistency among authors in the notation for set
inclusion and proper set inclusion. For example, some write A ⊂B to mean A is a subset of B and
A ⊊B to mean A is a proper subset of B. Again, we write A ⊆B to mean A is a subset of B and
A ⊂B to mean A is a proper subset of B.
Often when there is a discussion concerning sets, the sets involved are all subsets of some speciﬁed
set, called the universal set, which is usually denoted by U. For example, if we are considering
certain sets of integers, the universal set is Z; while if we are considering certain sets of real numbers,
the universal set is R.
Venn Diagrams
It is occasionally convenient to draw a diagram in the plane, called a Venn diagram, to pic-
torially represent a set or sets under consideration. A rectangle is often drawn to represent the
universal set. Within the rectangle, a closed curve (often a circle or ellipse) is drawn for each set
being discussed. The location of regions inside or outside the curves indicates the sets to which an
element may or may not belong. Venn diagrams are illustrated in the next example.
Example 2.10
Suppose that U = {1, 2, . . ., 6} is the universal set. Draw a Venn diagram for each of the following:
(a) the set A = {1, 2, 5, 6}.
(b) the set B = {1, 3, 6}.
(c) the two sets C = {1, 2, 4} and D = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6}.
(d) the two sets E = {1, 2, 3} and F = {3, 5, 6}.
Solution. See Figure 2.1.

(a) In this situation, the two elements 3 and 4 of U do not belong to A.
(b) Here the elements 2, 4 and 5 do not belong to B.
(c) Since every element of C belongs to D, it follows that C ⊆D. In fact, C ̸= D and so C ⊂D.
The element 3 belongs to U but not to D.
(d) The elements 1, 2 and 3 belong to E. Since 1 and 2 do not belong to F, these elements are
written inside E but outside of F. Since 5 and 6 belong to F but not to E, these two elements
are drawn inside F but outside of E. The element 4 belongs to U but to neither E nor F.
Only the element 3 belongs to both E and F.
♦
The standard and most appropriate way to draw a Venn diagram for two general sets A and B
is shown in Figure 2.2 as it allows for the four possibilities:
• some elements may belong to both A and B,
• some elements may belong to A but not to B,
• some elements may belong to B but not to A and
• some elements may belong to neither A nor B.

Figure 2.3: A Venn diagram for the two sets in Example 2.11
From this diagram, we can see that
• 3 and 6 belong to both sets A and B,
• 2, 4 and 9 belong to A but not to B,
• 1, 7 and 8 belong to B but not to A, while
• 5 and 10 belong to neither A nor B.
Therefore, A = {2, 3, 4, 6, 9}, B = {1, 3, 6, 7, 8} and the universal set is U = {1, 2, . . ., 10}.
♦
We mentioned that there are no restrictions on what the elements of a set can be. In fact, we
have seen that an element of a set can itself be a set.

58
CHAPTER 2. SETS
Example 2.12
(a) If A1 = {1} and A2 = {{1}}, then each of A1 and A2 has a single element. So |A1| = |A2| = 1.
The only element of A1 is the number 1, while the only element of A2 is the set A1 = {1},
that is, A2 = {A1}. Notice that A1 ̸= A2. Thus, A1 ∈A2 and A1 ̸⊆A2.
(b) The set B = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}} has two elements and so |B| = 2. One element of B is the set
{1, 2}, which contains 1 and 2, while the other element of B is the set {2, 3} containing 2 and
3. However, none of the numbers 1, 2 and 3 belong to B.
(c) The set C = {1, 2, {1, 2}} has three elements and so |C| = 3. Two of the elements of C are
numbers, namely 1 and 2 and the other element of C is the set {1, 2}. Notice that {1, 2} ⊂C
and {1, 2} ∈C, that is, the set {1, 2} is both a proper subset of C and an element of C.
(d) The set D = {0, ∅} has cardinality 2. One element of D is the integer 0 and the other element
of D is the empty set ∅.
♦
For a set A containing elements that are also sets, it can occasionally be confusing whether a
given element belongs to A or whether a given set is a subset of A. Let’s look at some examples of
this.
Example 2.13
Let A = {{1, {1}}}, B = {1, 2, 3}, C = {1, {∅}}, D = {1, 2, {2}} and E = {∅, {0}, 0}. Which of the
following statements are true?
(a) 1 ∈A.
(b) {∅} ⊆B.
(c) {∅} ⊆C.
(d) {2} ⊆D.
(e) {∅} ∈E.
Solution.
(a) The statement is false. The set A only has one element, namely the set {1, {1}}. Therefore, 1
is not an element of A.
(b) The statement is false. In order for {∅} to be a subset of B, ∅must be an element of B.
However, the only elements of B are 1, 2 and 3.
(c) The statement is false. The set C contains two elements, namely 1 and {∅}. Since ∅is not an
element of C, the set {∅} is not a subset of C. However, {∅} ∈C.
(d) The statement is true. The elements of D are 1, 2 and {2}. Since 2 is an element of D, it
follows that {2} ⊆D. Observe that {2} ∈D as well.
(e) The statement is false. Since the elements of E are ∅, {0} and 0, it follows that {∅} is not an
element of E. However, {∅} ⊆E.
♦

2.1. SETS AND SUBSETS
59
Example 2.14
Give an example of three sets A, B and C such that A ∈B, A ⊂B and B ∈C.
Solution. We start with a simple example for A, say A = {1}. Since we want both A ∈B and
A ⊂B, this suggests choosing B = {A, 1} = {{1}, 1}. Since we are required to have B ∈C, we
choose C = {B} = {{{1}, 1}}.
♦
Power Sets
We have seen several sets for which some or all of their elements are sets. We next consider a
set, all of whose elements are subsets of a given set.
Deﬁnition 2.15
The set of all subsets of a set A is called the power set of A and is denoted by
P(A). Thus
P(A) = {B : B ⊆A}.
Since A ⊆A and ∅⊆A for every set A, it follows that A ∈P(A) and ∅∈P(A). Therefore,
every nonempty set has at least two distinct subsets.
Example 2.16
Determine the power set of each of the sets A = {a, b}, B = {x, y, z}, C = {0, {∅}} and D = ∅.
Solution. The power sets of A, B, C and D are
P(A)
=
{∅, {a}, {b}, A}
P(B)
=
{∅, {x}, {y}, {z}, {x, y}, {x, z}, {y, z}, B}
P(C)
=
{∅, {0}, {{∅}}, C}
P(D)
=
{∅}.
Notice that even though D is empty, its power set P(D) is nonempty.
♦
Observe that in Example 2.16 we have listed the subsets of A, B and C systematically, ﬁrst listing
∅, then the subsets with one element, the subsets with two elements and so on. You may have also
noticed that each of the sets A and C in Example 2.16 has two elements, while both P(A) and P(C)
have 4 = 22 elements. Furthermore, the set B has three elements and P(B) has 8 = 23 elements.
This might very well lead you to suspect that if A has n elements for some nonnegative integer n,
then P(A) has 2n elements. This, in fact, is true and will be veriﬁed later. For the present however,
we state this result for future use.
Theorem 2.17
If A is a set with |A| = n, where n is a nonnegative integer, then
|P(A)| = 2n.
Example 2.18
For A = {x ∈Z : |x| ≤3}, how many elements are in P(A)?
Solution. Since A = {−3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, it follows that |A| = 7. By Theorem 2.17, the number
of elements in P(A) is |P(A)| = 27 = 128.

Set Operations and Their Properties
Much of our interest in sets is because of properties they possess when combined to produce other
sets. You may very well be aware of some of these properties. We begin with two of the most
common ways of combining two given sets to form a new set.
Intersections and Unions
Deﬁnition 2.19
Let A and B be two sets. The intersection A ∩B of A and B is the set of
elements belonging to both A and B. Thus
A ∩B = {x : x ∈A and x ∈B}.
Deﬁnition 2.20
Let A and B be two sets. The union A ∪B of A and B is the set of elements
belonging to at least one of A and B; that is,
A ∪B = {x : x ∈A or x ∈B}.
Therefore, the word “or” in the deﬁnition of the union A ∪B of A and B is the “inclusive or.”
Consequently, an element x belongs to A ∪B if x belongs to both A and B or to exactly one of A
and B. Because an element belongs to A ∪B if it belongs to A ∩B, it follows that
A ∩B ⊆A ∪B.
Venn diagrams for the intersection and union of two general sets A and B are shown in Figure 2.4.
The shading indicates the portion of the diagram that represents the set being considered.

Intersection and union satisfy some familiar-sounding properties.
Theorem 2.22
For every three sets A, B and C,
(a) (Commutative Laws)
A ∩B = B ∩A and A ∪B = B ∪A.
(b) (Associative Laws)
(A ∩B) ∩C = A ∩(B ∩C) and (A ∪B) ∪C = A ∪(B ∪C).
(c) (Distributive Laws)
A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) and A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C).
The properties of intersection and union of sets stated in Theorem 2.22 are probably not surpris-
ing and are even suggested by Venn diagrams; however, none of these diagrams constitutes a proof
of a property. Figure 2.6(a) shows a customary way of drawing a Venn diagram involving three
general sets. See Figure 2.6(b) – (f) for the ﬁrst of the two distributive laws in Theorem 2.22(c).

Figure 2.6: Illustrating a distributive law
The properties of sets stated in Theorem 2.22 can be veriﬁed with the aid of the properties of
logic that were presented in Chapter 1. For example, to establish that A ∩B = B ∩A for every two
sets A and B, we can show that A ∩B and B ∩A consist of exactly the same elements, that is, any
element that belongs to one of A ∩B and B ∩A belongs to the other. Observe that
x ∈A ∩B
≡
x ∈A and x ∈B
(deﬁnition of intersection of A and B)

64
CHAPTER 2. SETS
≡
x ∈B and x ∈A
(commutative law of conjunction)
≡
x ∈B ∩A
(deﬁnition of intersection of B and A).
Strictly speaking, writing A ∪B ∪C for three sets A, B and C is not deﬁned, as union is only
deﬁned for two sets. There are two natural interpretations of A ∪B ∪C, namely (A ∪B) ∪C and
A ∪(B ∪C). However, according to the associative law for union in Theorem 2.22(b), these two sets
are equal. Consequently, there is no confusion in writing A ∪B ∪C without parentheses. The same
is true for A ∩B ∩C. Thus,
A ∩B ∩C
=
{x : x ∈A, x ∈B and x ∈C}
A ∪B ∪C
=
{x : x ∈A, x ∈B or x ∈C}.
More generally, for n ≥2 sets A1, A2, . . . , An, the intersection of these sets is
n
\
i=1
Ai = A1 ∩A2 ∩· · · ∩An = {x : x ∈Ai for every i with 1 ≤i ≤n};
while the union of these sets is
n[
i=1
Ai = A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An = {x : x ∈Ai for some i with 1 ≤i ≤n}.
Example 2.23
For sets A = {1, 3, 4}, B = {3, 4, 6} and C = {2, 3, 5},
A ∩B ∩C = {3} and A ∪B ∪C = {1, 2, . . ., 6}. ♦
Example 2.24
Let A1 = {1, 2}, A2 = {2, 3}, . . ., A10 = {10, 11}. That is, Ai = {i, i + 1} for i = 1, 2, . . . , 10. Then
A1 ∩A2 ∩· · · ∩A10 = ∅and A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪A10 = {1, 2, . . ., 11}.
Note that for 1 ≤i ≤9, Ai ∩Ai+1 = {i + 1}.
♦
Deﬁnition 2.25
Two sets A and B are disjoint if they have no elements in common, that is, if
A ∩B = ∅. A collection of sets is said to be pairwise disjoint if every two distinct sets in the
collection are disjoint.
Example 2.26
The sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 6} are disjoint, the set of even integers and the set of odd
integers are disjoint and the set of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers are disjoint.
The set of nonnegative integers and the set of nonpositive integers are not disjoint, however, since 0
belongs to both sets.
♦
Example 2.27
The sets A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {4, 5} and C = {6, 7, 8} are pairwise disjoint since every two of the sets
A, B and C are disjoint. The sets A1 = {a, b}, A2 = {a, c} and A3 = {b, c} are not pairwise disjoint,
however, since A1 ∩A2 = {a} ̸= ∅, for example. On the other hand, A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 = ∅.
♦

2.2. SET OPERATIONS AND THEIR PROPERTIES

Diﬀerence and Symmetric Diﬀerence
Deﬁnition 2.28
The diﬀerence A −B of two sets A and B is deﬁned as
A −B = {x : x ∈A and x /∈B}.
Some individuals denote the set A −B by A ∖B.
Deﬁnition 2.29
The symmetric diﬀerence A ⊕B of two sets A and B is deﬁned by
A ⊕B = (A −B) ∪(B −A).
Venn diagrams for the diﬀerence and symmetric diﬀerence of two general sets are shown in
Figure 2.7. While A ⊕B = B ⊕A for every two sets A and B, this is not the case for A −B and
B −A. That is, there is no commutative law for set diﬀerence.

Figure 2.7: Venn diagrams for A −B and A ⊕B
Therefore, for an element x ∈A ⊕B, we must have x ∈A −B or x ∈B −A. If x ∈A −B, then
x ∈A but x /∈B; while if x ∈B −A, then x ∈B but x /∈A. In other words, if x ∈A ⊕B, then x
belongs to exactly one of A and B. That is, if x ∈A ⊕B, then x ∈A or x ∈B, where the use of
the word “or” here is the “exclusive or.” In symbols,
x ∈A ⊕B ≡(x ∈A) ⊕(x ∈B),
(2.1)
where the ﬁrst occurrence of ⊕in (2.1) denotes the symmetric diﬀerence of two sets and the second
occurrence of ⊕in (2.1) denotes the “exclusive or” of two statements. The Venn diagram for A ⊕B
in Figure 2.7 also illustrates the fact that
A ⊕B = (A ∪B) −(A ∩B).
Example 2.30
For the sets A = {i ∈Z : 1 ≤i ≤10} and B = {i ∈Z : 5 ≤i ≤15},
A −B
=
{i ∈Z : 1 ≤i ≤4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}

{i ∈Z : 11 ≤i ≤15} = {11, 12, 13, 14, 15}

{1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15}. ♦
For general sets A, B and C, Venn diagrams for the sets (A −B) ∩(A −C) and A −(B ∪C) are
shown in Figure 2.8. From the two Venn diagrams in Figure 2.8, it appears that (A −B) ∩(A −C)
and A −(B ∪C) are equal sets. As we mentioned earlier, even though Venn diagrams may suggest

66
CHAPTER 2. SETS
that two sets are equal, these diagrams do not constitute a mathematical proof of this. Recall that
two sets X and Y are equal if they contain exactly the same elements. We have also observed that
X = Y if and only if X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X.
(2.2)
Although methods of proof will not be discussed until Chapter 3, we can describe now how we would
attempt to verify that two sets X and Y are equal by means of (2.2). In particular, it suﬃces to
show that X ⊆Y and Y ⊆X. To verify that X ⊆Y , we show that each element of X belongs to
Y . This can be accomplished by taking a general element of X, denoted by x say and showing that
x must also belong to Y . To verify that Y ⊆X, we show that a general element y belonging to Y
must also belong to X. From this, it follows that X = Y .

Figure 2.8: Venn diagrams for (A −B) ∩(A −C) and A −(B ∪C)
Example 2.31
Let A, B and C be sets. Show that
(A −B) ∩(A −C) = A −(B ∪C).
Solution. First, we show that (A −B) ∩(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∪C). Let x ∈(A −B) ∩(A −C). Then
x ∈A −B and x ∈A −C. Since x ∈A −B, it follows that x ∈A and x /∈B. Since x ∈A −C,
it follows that x ∈A and x /∈C. Since x /∈B and x /∈C, we have x /∈B ∪C. Thus x ∈A and
x /∈B ∪C and so x ∈A −(B ∪C). Therefore,
(A −B) ∩(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∪C).
(2.3)
Next, we show that A −(B ∪C) ⊆(A −B) ∩(A −C). Let y ∈A −(B ∪C). Hence y ∈A and
y /∈B ∪C. Since y /∈B ∪C, we can conclude that y /∈B and y /∈C. Thus y ∈A−B and y ∈A−C;
so y ∈(A −B) ∩(A −C). Hence
A −(B ∪C) ⊆(A −B) ∩(A −C).
(2.4)
Combining (2.3) and (2.4), we obtain
(A −B) ∩(A −C) = A −(B ∪C),
as desired.
♦
Complement of a Set
Deﬁnition 2.32 For a set A (which is therefore a subset of the universal set U being considered),
the complement A of A is the set of elements (in the universal set) not belonging to A. That is,
A = {x ∈U : x /∈A} = U −A.

2.2. SET OPERATIONS AND THEIR PROPERTIES

The Venn diagram for the complement of a set is shown in Figure 2.9. Therefore,
A ∪A = U

Example 2.33
Let Z be the universal set and let E be the set of even integers. Then the complement E of E is the
set O of odd integers. Furthermore, E ∪E = E ∪O = Z and E ∩E = E ∩O = ∅.
♦
Example 2.34
If U = R, then the complement Q of the set Q of all rational numbers is the set of irrational numbers.
If U = Z, then N = {n ∈Z : n ≤0}.
♦
Two well-known properties of sets involving unions, intersections and complements are named
after the British mathematician Augustus De Morgan, whom we encountered in Chapter 1.
Theorem 2.35
(De Morgan’s Laws) For two sets A and B,
A ∪B = A ∩B
and
A ∩B = A ∪B.
Each law in Theorem 2.35 can be anticipated by considering Venn diagrams. De Morgan’s Laws
for the complement of the union and the intersection of two sets are consequences of De Morgan’s
Laws for the negation of the disjunction and of the conjunction of two statements. In order to see
this, let A and B be two sets that are subsets of some universal set U. Then
x ∈A ∪B
≡
∼(x ∈A ∪B) ≡∼(x ∈A or x ∈B)
≡
∼((x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B)) ≡(x /∈A) ∧(x /∈B)
≡
(x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B) ≡x ∈A ∩B.
That is, A ∪B = A ∩B. Furthermore,
x ∈A ∩B
≡
∼(x ∈A ∩B) ≡∼(x ∈A and x ∈B)
≡
∼((x ∈A) ∧(x ∈B)) ≡(x /∈A) ∨(x /∈B)
≡
(x ∈A) ∨(x ∈B) ≡x ∈A ∪B.
Consequently, A ∩B = A ∪B.
Example 2.36
For the sets C = {1, 2, 4, 5} and D = {1, 3, 5} and the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, it follows that

2.3
Cartesian Products of Sets
We have seen that new sets can be constructed from two given sets A and B in a variety of ways.
There is another set that can be created from A and B but whose elements are of an entirely diﬀerent
nature.
For two elements a and b, we write (a, b) for the ordered pair in which a is the ﬁrst element
(or ﬁrst coordinate) of the pair and b is the second element (second coordinate) of the pair. While
{a, b} = {b, a} for distinct elements a and b, this is not so for ordered pairs. In particular, (a, b) =
(c, d) if and only if a = c and b = d. That is, if a ̸= b, then (a, b) ̸= (b, a). This might remind you
of the points (1, 2) and (2, 1) in the Cartesian plane, which are not same. Mentioning the Cartesian
plane, in fact, leads us to the major concept of this section.
Deﬁnition 2.37
For two sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B of A and B is the set of
all ordered pairs whose ﬁrst coordinate belongs to A and whose second coordinate belongs to B. That
is,
A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈A and b ∈B}.
Example 2.38
For the sets A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y, z}, determine A × B, B × A, A × A and B × B.
Solution. For these sets A and B,
A × B
=
{(1, x), (1, y), (1, z), (2, x), (2, y), (2, z)}
B × A
=
{(x, 1), (x, 2), (y, 1), (y, 2), (z, 1), (z, 2)}
A × A
=
{(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)}
B × B
=
{(x, x), (x, y), (x, z), (y, x), (y, y), (y, z), (z, x), (z, y), (z, z)}. ♦
You might have observed for the sets A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y, z} in Example 2.38 that

2.3. CARTESIAN PRODUCTS OF SETS
71
|A| = 2, |B| = 3 and |A × B| = 6.
Actually, for every two ﬁnite sets A and B,
|A × B| = |A| · |B| = |B| · |A| = |B × A|.
(2.5)
Example 2.38 also shows that A × B ̸= B × A for the sets A = {1, 2} and B = {x, y, z}. Indeed, it
is not unusual for A × B ̸= B × A. (See Exercises 10 and 11.)
Example 2.39
For the sets A = {0, 1} and B = {∅, {1}, 2}, determine A × B.
Solution. For these two sets A and B,
A × B = {(0, ∅), (0, {1}), (0, 2), (1, ∅), (1, {1}), (1, 2)}. ♦
Example 2.40
The Cartesian product
R × R = {(x, y) : x, y ∈R}
is the set of ordered pairs of real numbers. Therefore, R × R is the set of all points in the Cartesian
plane. This set is sometimes denoted by R2 as well.
♦
The Cartesian product of n ≥2 sets A1, A2, . . ., An is denoted by A1 × A2 × · · · × An and is
deﬁned by
A1 × A2 × · · · × An = {(a1, a2, . . . , an) : ai ∈Ai for 1 ≤i ≤n}.
The elements (a1, a2, . . . , an) are referred to as ordered n-tuples, where a1 is the ﬁrst element
(or the ﬁrst coordinate) of the n-tuple, a2 is the second element and so on. So ordered 2-tuples
are ordered pairs. Ordered 3-tuples are also called ordered triples. If Ai = A for 1 ≤i ≤n, then
A1 × A2 × · · · × An is also denoted by An.
Example 2.41
For A = {0, 1}, B = {1, 2} and C = {1, 2, 3}, determine A × B × C.
Solution. The Cartesian product of A, B and C consists of all ordered triples (a, b, c), where a ∈A,
b ∈B and c ∈C. Therefore,
A × B × C
=
{(0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 2, 3),
(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2), (1, 1, 3), (1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 2, 3)}. ♦

2.4
Partitions
There are many instances when it is useful to divide a nonempty set A into nonempty subsets in
such a way that each element of A belongs to exactly one of these subsets. For example, the set P
of Americans who have served as president of the United States can be partitioned into the set P1
of individuals who have been elected to exactly one term as president, the set P2 of individuals who
have been elected to exactly two terms as president, the set P3 of individuals who have been elected
to three or more terms as president and the set P0 of individuals who have been elected to no terms
as president.
The set Z of integers can be divided into the set E of even integers and the set O of odd integers.
Certainly, every integer belongs to exactly one of E and O. The set R of real numbers can be divided
into the three non-overlapping subsets: the set R+ of positive real numbers, the set of negative real
numbers (which we can denote by R−) and the set {0} consisting only of 0. Similarly, R can be
divided into the set Q of rational numbers and the set of irrational numbers. If we were considering
the polynomial x2 −4, where x ∈R, we might wish to divide R into the sets A, B and C, where
A
=
{x ∈R : x2 −4 = 0}
B
=
{x ∈R : x2 −4 < 0}
C
=
{x ∈R : x2 −4 > 0}.

2.4. PARTITIONS
73
As it turns out,
A
=
{−2, 2}
B
=
{x ∈R : −2 < x < 2}
C
=
{x ∈R : x < −2 or x > 2}.
What we have been discussing are various ways that a set might be “partitioned” into subsets.
Deﬁnition 2.42
A partition of a nonempty set A is a collection of nonempty subsets of A such
that every element of A belongs to exactly one of these subsets.
A partition of a nonempty set A is therefore a collection of pairwise disjoint nonempty subsets of
A whose union is A. Thus, if P = {S1, S2, . . . , Sk}, k ≥1, is a partition of a nonempty set A, then
(1) every subset Si is nonempty,
(2) every two diﬀerent subsets Si and Sj are disjoint and
(3) the union of all subsets in P is A.
Example 2.43
For the set A = {1, 2, . . ., 10} and the subsets
S1 = {1, 7, 8}, S2 = {2, 4, 9}, S3 = {3}, S4 = {5, 6, 10}
of A, the set P = {S1, S2, S3, S4} is a partition of A (see Figure 2.10).

Example 2.44
Let A = {1, 2, . . ., 8}. Which of the following collections of subsets of A are partitions of A?
(a)
P1 = {{1, 4, 7, 8}, {3, 5, 6}, {2}}.
(b)
P2 = {{1, 4}, {2, 8}, {3, 5, 7}}.
(c)
P3 = {{1, 2, 4}, {3, 6, 8}, ∅, {5, 7}}.
(d)
P4 = {{1, 7, 8}, {2, 5, 6}, {3, 4, 7}}.
Solution.
Only P1 is a partition of A. The set P2 is not a partition of A since 6 belongs to no
subset in P2. The set P3 is not a partition of A since all subsets in a partition are required to be
nonempty. The set P4 is not a partition of A since 7 belongs to two diﬀerent subsets in P4.

Methods of Proof
In a criminal trial, the goal of the prosecuting attorney is to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that
the defendant is guilty of the crime with which he or she has been charged. If the defendant is found
guilty, then it is still possible that he or she did not commit the crime. To test the safety and eﬃcacy
of a new drug, a pharmaceutical company conducts clinical trials of the drug on individuals with the
purpose of proving that the drug is eﬀective in treating a particular medical condition. If the drug
is approved for use, then it is quite likely that there will be individuals having this condition but for
whom the drug is not eﬀective. While proof does not mean certainty in these situations, proof does
mean certainty in mathematics.
Indeed, one of the major reasons that we discussed logic and sets in the two preceding chapters
was to provide ourselves with a proper background so that we can learn how to read and understand
proofs of theorems and, on occasion, be able to write correct proofs of our own. The goal of this
chapter is to introduce some methods of proof. (Another method will be introduced in Chapter 4.)
In a proof of a theorem, we often employ deﬁnitions, assumptions, axioms (statements accepted
without proof) and other theorems that are known to the readers. A proof ordinarily consists of a
sequence of statements, each following logically from those precede it, and ending with the desired
conclusion. These statements are normally written as English sentences, with enough clarity so that
a person having an appropriate background will understand the proof. The amount of detail in a
proof depends on the anticipated knowledge and background of the audience.
3.1
Quantiﬁed Statements
We have seen that each open sentence involves a variable (or variables) whose values are taken from
a set called the domain of the variable. Furthermore, a statement can be formed from an open
sentence by assigning to each variable in the open sentence a value from its domain. Statements can
also be formed from open sentences by what is called a quantiﬁer. There are two kinds of quantiﬁers:
universal and existential. In this section we will see how to construct statements from open sentences
with the aid of these quantiﬁers. In the following section, we will learn when such statements are
true and be introduced to one method of verifying the truth of some statements constructed in this
manner.
Universal Quantiﬁers
Suppose that R(x) is an open sentence over a domain S. Then for each element a ∈S, R(a) is
a statement. Each of the phrases “for all,” “for every” and “for each” is referred to as a universal
79

CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
quantiﬁer and is denoted by the symbol ∀. The sentence
∀x ∈S, R(x)
(3.1)
is stated in words as:
For every x ∈S, R(x).
This sentence is, in fact, a statement and is called a quantiﬁed statement.
Example 3.1
For the open sentence
R(n): n2 −n is even.
over the domain Z of integers, the sentence
∀n ∈Z, R(n): For every integer n, n2 −n is even.
is therefore a quantiﬁed statement.
♦
The quantiﬁed statement (3.1) is often rephrased as an implication. For example, for an open
sentence R(x) over a domain S, the quantiﬁed statement ∀x ∈S, R(x) can be expressed as:
If x ∈S, then R(x).
Example 3.2
The quantiﬁed statement:
For every integer n, n2 −n is even.
in Example 3.1 can therefore be expressed as
If n is an integer, then n2 −n is even.
♦
Example 3.3
For the open sentence
R(n): 5n + 3 is even.
over the domain S of odd integers, the quantiﬁed statement
∀n ∈S, R(n)
can be expressed as
For every odd integer n, 5n + 3 is even.
or as
If n is an odd integer, then 5n + 3 is even.
♦
If an open sentence R(x) over a domain S is itself an implication, say R(x) is the implication
P(x) ⇒Q(x) for open sentences P(x) and Q(x), then the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
can be expressed in a variety of ways:
• For every x ∈S, if P(x) then Q(x).
• If x ∈S, then P(x) implies Q(x).
• Let x ∈S. If P(x), then Q(x).

3.1. QUANTIFIED STATEMENTS
81
Example 3.4
For the open sentences
P(n): 5n2 −2 is odd.
Q(n): n is odd.
where the domain of the variable n is Z, the quantiﬁed statement
∀n ∈Z, P(n) ⇒Q(n)
can therefore be expressed in words in any of the following ways:
• For every integer n, if 5n2 −2 is odd then n is odd.
• If n is an integer, then 5n2 −2 is odd implies that n is odd.
• Let n be an integer. If 5n2 −2 is odd, then n is odd.
♦
If an open sentence R(x) over a domain S is the biconditional P(x) ⇔Q(x) for open sentences
P(x) and Q(x), then the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇔Q(x)
can be expressed in words in any of the following ways:
• For every x ∈S, P(x) if and only if Q(x).
• Let x ∈S. Then P(x) if and only if Q(x).
• Let x ∈S. Then P(x) is necessary and suﬃcent for Q(x).
Example 3.5
For the open sentences
P(n): n2 is even.
Q(n): n is even.
where the domain of the variable n is Z, the quantiﬁed statement
∀n ∈Z, P(n) ⇔Q(n)
can be expressed in words in any of the following ways:
• For every integer n, n2 is even if and only if n is even.
• Let n be an integer. Then n2 is even if and only if n is even.
• Let n ∈Z. Then n2 is even is a necessary and suﬃcent condition
for n to be even.
♦
Existential Quantiﬁers
There is another way to form a statement from an open sentence by means of quantiﬁcation.
Each of the phrases “there exists,” “there is,” “for some” or “for at least one” is called an existential
quantiﬁer, which is denoted in symbols by ∃. For an open sentence Q(x) over a domain S, the
sentence
∃x ∈S, Q(x)
is a quantiﬁed statement that can be expressed in any of the following ways:
• There exists x ∈S such that Q(x).
• For some x ∈S, Q(x).
• For at least one x ∈S, Q(x).

82
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
Example 3.6
For the open sentence
Q(x): x4 + 2 = 2x2.
over the domain R of real numbers, the quantiﬁed statement
∃x ∈R, Q(x)
can be expressed in any of the following ways:
• There exists x ∈R such that x4 + 2 = 2x2.
• For some real number x, x4 + 2 = 2x2.
• For at least one real number x, x4 + 2 = 2x2.
This statement can also be expressed as:
The equation x4 + 2 = 2x2 has a real number solution.
♦
Negations of Quantiﬁed Statements
Let’s now consider negations of quantiﬁed statements. For an open sentence R(x) over a domain
S, the negation of ∀x ∈S, R(x) is:
∼(∀x ∈S, R(x)): It is not the case that R(x) for every x ∈S.
This says that:
There exists x ∈S such that not R(x).
In symbols:
∼(∀x ∈S, R(x)) ≡∃x ∈S, ∼R(x).
(3.2)
The negation of ∃x ∈S, R(x) is:
∼(∃x ∈S, R(x)): There does not exist x ∈S such that R(x).
This implies that:
For every x ∈S, not R(x).
Therefore,
∼(∃x ∈S, R(x)) ≡∀x ∈S, ∼R(x).
(3.3)
In other words, the negation of a quantiﬁed statement is also a quantiﬁed statement, namely the
one with the opposite quantiﬁer applied to the negation of the original open sentence.
Example 3.7
State the negation of each of the following quantiﬁed statements.
(a) Everyone likes “The Wizard of Oz.”
(b) There is a city whose population exceeds that of Mexico City.
Solution. The negation of the quantiﬁed statement in (a) is
There is someone who does not like “The Wizard of Oz.”
(Notice that the negation of the quantiﬁed statement in (a) is not: No one likes “The Wizard of
Oz.”) The negation of the statement in (b) is

3.1. QUANTIFIED STATEMENTS
83
The population of every city is not more than the population of Mexico City.
This statement could also be expressed as
The population of no city exceeds that of Mexico City.
♦
Example 3.8
State the negation of each of the following quantiﬁed statements.
(a) For every integer n, the integer 2n2 + 5n + 1 is odd.
(b) There exists a real number x such that x2 < 0.
Solution. The negation of the quantiﬁed statement in (a) is
There exists an integer n such that 2n2 + 5n + 1 is not odd.
Of course, the negation of the statement in (a) could also be expressed as
There exists an integer n such that 2n2 + 5n + 1 is even.
The negation of the quantiﬁed statement in (b) is
For every real number x, x2 ≥0.
The negation of the statement in (b) could also be written as
There is no real number x for which x2 < 0.
♦
Example 3.9
State the negation of each of the following quantiﬁed statements.
(a) If n is an even integer, then 3n + 5 is an even integer.
(b) There exists an integer n between
√
5 and e.
Solution. The quantiﬁed statement in (a) can also be expressed as
For every even integer n, 3n + 5 is an even integer.
Consequently, the negation of this statement can be expressed as
There exists an even integer n such that 3n + 5 is not even.
or
There exists an even integer n such that 3n + 5 is odd.
The negation of the quantiﬁed statement in (b) can be written as
There exists no integer between
√
5 and e.
or
No integer is between
√
5 and e.
or
For every integer n, n does not lie between
√
5 and e.

84
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
or
If n is an integer, then n is not between
√
5 and e.
♦
There are occasions when a quantiﬁed statement may contain both types of quantiﬁers. For
example, if R(x, y) is an open sentence with variables x and y such that the domain of x is S and
the domain of y is T , then the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y)
(3.4)
can be expressed as
For every x ∈S, there exists y ∈T such that R(x, y).
On the other hand, the quantiﬁed statement
∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y)
(3.5)
can be expressed as
There exists x ∈S such that for every y ∈T , R(x, y).
The negation of the statement in (3.4) is
∼(∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∃x ∈S, ∼(∃y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, ∼R(x, y),
which can therefore be expressed as
There exists x ∈S such that for every y ∈T , not R(x, y).
The negation of the statement in (3.5) is
∼(∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∀x ∈S, ∼(∀y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, ∼R(x, y),
which can therefore be expressed as
For every x ∈S, there exists y ∈T such that not R(x, y).
Example 3.10
Express the following statements in symbols and express their negations, both in symbols and in
words.
(a) For every real number x, there exists a real number y such that x + y = 0.
(b) There exists an integer a such that for every integer b, ab = 0.
Solution.
(a) In this case, the domain of both x and y is the set R of real numbers. If we let P(x, y) be the
open sentence
P(x, y): x + y = 0.
then the statement in (a) can be expressed as:
∀x ∈R, ∃y ∈R, P(x, y).
(3.6)
The negation of the statement in (3.6) is
∼(∀x ∈R, ∃y ∈R, P(x, y))
≡
∃x ∈R, ∀y ∈R, ∼P(x, y).
Therefore, in words, the negation of the statement in (a) is

3.1. QUANTIFIED STATEMENTS
85
There exists a real number x such that for all real numbers y, x + y ̸= 0.
(b) Here the domain of both a and b is the set Z of integers. Let Q(a, b) be the open sentence
Q(a, b): ab = 0.
The statement in (b) can therefore be expressed as:
∃a ∈Z, ∀b ∈Z, Q(a, b).
(3.7)
The negation, in symbols, of the statement in (3.7) is
∼(∃a ∈Z, ∀b ∈Z, Q(a, b))
≡
∀a ∈Z, ∃b ∈Z, ∼Q(a, b).
In words, the negation of the statement in (b) is:
For every integer a, there exists an integer b such that ab ̸= 0.

3.2
Direct Proof
For an open sentence R(x) over a domain S, we have seen two kinds of quantiﬁed statements that
can be constructed from R(x), namely one by means of the universal quantiﬁer
∀x ∈S, R(x)
(3.8)
and the other by means of the existential quantiﬁer
∃x ∈S, R(x).
(3.9)
Since each of (3.8) and (3.9) is a statement, each has a truth value.
• The statement ∀x ∈S, R(x) is true if R(x) is true for each x ∈S. Therefore, ∀x ∈S, R(x) is
false if R(x) is false for at least one element x ∈S.
• The statement ∃x ∈S, R(x) is true if there exists at least one element x ∈S for which R(x)
is true. Consequently, ∃x ∈S, R(x) is false if R(x) is false for every element x ∈S.
We now illustrate these ideas.
Example 3.11
Let S = {3, 4, 5} and let
R(x) :
x2 + 5x + 4
2
is even.
be an open sentence over the domain S.
(a) State R(x) for each x ∈S and determine its truth value.
(b) State ∀x ∈S, R(x) and determine its truth value.
(c) State ∃x ∈S, R(x) and determine its truth value.
Solution.
(a) The statements R(x) for each x ∈S along with their truth values are
R(3): 14 is even. (a true statement)
R(4): 20 is even. (a true statement)
R(5): 27 is even. (a false statement)

88
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
(b) The quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, R(x): For every x ∈S, x2 + 5x + 4
2
is even.
is false since R(5) is a false statement.
(c) The quantiﬁed statement
∃x ∈S, R(x): There exists x ∈S such that x2 + 5x + 4
2
is even.
is true since R(3) (also R(4)) is a true statement.
♦
But how does one establish that a statement such as (3.8) is true if the domain S contains more
than just a few elements? The answer to this question is that we provide a proof.
Deﬁnition 3.12
A proof of a statement is a presentation of a logical argument that demonstrates
the truth of the statement.
A proof of a statement R ordinarily consists of a sequence of statements, each following logically
from those that precede it and which terminates with the desired conclusion that the statement R
is true. Within the proof we typically make use of one or more of the following:
(1) deﬁnitions of concepts,
(2) axioms or principles that have been agreed upon,
(3) assumptions we may have made,
(4) previous theorems.
The manner in which a proof is written and the number of sentences in a proof can vary widely.
Indeed, a proof is written for an intended audience and the person writing the proof must be aware
of what the audience knows or is expected to know. Even a proof that is written correctly may
not be persuasive to a person reading the proof. In order to have a successfully written proof, a
person reading the proof must have a certain degree of conviction that the argument presented is
convincing. A correct proof may not be convincing because (i) the writer has made some questionable
assumptions about what a reader knows and is likely to recall or (ii) the presentation fails to include
some details that the reader needs. While clear and well-written proofs are always preferred, short
proofs are not necessarily better. We will see many examples of proofs in this and later chapters.
Learning to write proofs of your own is not an easy task. Although there is certainly no particular
approach to accomplish this, there is little doubt that reading and understanding the proofs of others
is a good way to begin. The ﬁrst several proofs that you write on your own will no doubt mimic
those you have seen. Eventually it will become necessary to create your own proofs as you encounter
statements that are diﬀerent from those you have previously seen. As you do this, you may write
proofs that are unclear to others and that contain errors. Although our goal is always to write clear
and correct proofs, you should not be overly concerned with this. After all, the only way to truly
avoid making mistakes in proofs is to not even try writing proofs.
We begin by discussing some techniques that are used to prove quantiﬁed statements of the type
∀x ∈S, R(x)
(3.10)
are true, where R(x) is an open sentence over a domain S. We have mentioned that statements of
the type (3.10) are often expressed as
For every x ∈S, R(x).

3.2. DIRECT PROOF
89
or
If x ∈S, then R(x).
Typically, R(x) is an implication, that is,
R(x): P(x) ⇒Q(x)
for open sentences P(x) and Q(x) over a domain S. Thus, we are discussing how to prove that
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
(3.11)
is true. We have seen that the statement (3.11) can be expressed in a number of ways, including
For every x ∈S, if P(x) then Q(x).
or
Let x ∈S. If P(x), then Q(x).
Probably the most common way to verify that a statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
is true is by means of a proof technique called a direct proof. To show that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
is true, we must show that P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true for every element x ∈S. Ordinarily, it is not
practical to show that P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true for every element x ∈S by considering each element
in S individually. According to the truth table for implication, we know that P(x) ⇒Q(x) is a
true statement for each element x ∈S for which P(x) is false. Thus it remains only to show that
P(x) ⇒Q(x) is a true statement for every element x ∈S for which P(x) is true. Of course, in order
for P(x) ⇒Q(x) to be true when P(x) is true, Q(x) must also be true. In a direct proof, we assume
that P(x) is a true statement for some arbitrary element x ∈S and show that Q(x) must also be
true. Let’s summarize what is done in a direct proof.
To prove that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true by means of a direct proof, we begin by
assuming that P(x) is true for an arbitrary element x ∈S and then we show that Q(x)
is true.
In the case where we are attempting to prove that
∀x ∈S, R(x)
or
If x ∈S, then R(x).
is true by means of a direct proof, we assume that x is an arbitrary element in S and show that
R(x) is a true statement.
A few additional comments are useful when giving a direct proof of the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x). We have mentioned that we assume that P(x) is true for an arbitrary
element x ∈S and that our goal is to show that Q(x) is true for this element x. It is expected that
someplace during the course of the proof we will make use of our assumption that P(x) is true. We
are certainly permitted to make use of other things during the proof. As mentioned above, we can
make use of any axioms and deﬁnitions that have been agreed upon, as well as any theorems that
are known (or should be known) to the reader.
Suppose that we have been successful in giving a direct proof of ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x). What
do we now know that we didn’t know before? First, let’s mention some things that we don’t know.
In particular, we do not know that P(x) is true for an arbitrary element x ∈S. We only assumed
that P(x) is true for an arbitrary element x ∈S in the course of giving the proof. At the end of
the proof, we also do not know that Q(x) is true for an arbitrary element x ∈S. What, in fact, we
know is that for each element x ∈S, the implication
If P(x), then Q(x).

CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
is true – nothing more and nothing less.
Why are we interested in proving a statement such as
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)?
One answer to this question is that this is the only way to be absolutely certain that this statement
is true. Another answer is that it’s a challenge to the mind to be able to prove such a statement.
Yet another answer is that once we have proved that a statement ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true, we
can use this information. We then know that if we should ever encounter a situation where P(a) is
true for some element a ∈S, then Q(a) must be true as well. (What we are essentially using here is
the tautology in Example 1.64 in Section 1.5 called modus ponens.) This may simply be interesting
to know or perhaps it has other consequences, such as having some applications or may be useful in
proving some other statements.
We are about to give examples of true mathematical statements and possible proofs (where we
use a direct proof or some other proof technique that we will introduce later). We will refer to
such examples as results. While some authors call every true mathematical statement a theorem,
others refer to such statements as observations, facts, results, propositions or theorems, according
to their importance. We will reserve the term theorem, however, for a true mathematical statement
that is especially useful, interesting or signiﬁcant. Of course, such an interpretation is necessarily
quite subjective. For us then, results are examples, often presented to illustrate a proof technique.
Therefore, the statement:
Let x ∈R. If x −2 = 0, then x2 −x −2 = 0.
(3.12)
will be a result to us, not a theorem.
Examples of Direct Proof
We ﬁrst illustrate the direct proof technique with examples involving real numbers, beginning
with a direct proof of the statement (3.12). From time to time, when giving a proof of some result or
theorem, we may precede the proof with a discussion of an idea or a plan we may have to construct
a proof or we may follow a proof with a discussion of some ideas that were used in the proof in order
to better understand the proof. We will refer to the ﬁrst type of discussion as a proof strategy
and the second type of discussion as a proof analysis (or simply as an analysis in the case of an
example). We will conclude a proof strategy, a proof analysis or an analysis with the symbol ♦.
Result to Prove: Let x be a real number. If x −2 = 0, then x2 −x −2 = 0.
Proof Strategy. In a direct proof, we begin by assuming that x −2 = 0. Our goal is now to show
that x2 −x −2 is also 0. Observe that x2 −x −2 can be factored as (x −2)(x + 1). Since we know
that x −2 = 0, we now see how a proof can be given.
♦
Result 3.13
Let x be a real number. If x −2 = 0, then x2 −x −2 = 0.
Proof. Assume that x −2 = 0. Then x2 −x −2 = (x −2)(x + 1) = 0 · (x + 1) = 0.
Proof Analysis. The statement of Result 3.13 begins with the sentence “Let x be a real number.”
Again, this is informing us that the domain of the variable x is the set of real numbers. A proof
of Result 3.13 could have also been given by assuming that x −2 = 0 and so x = 2.
Then
x2 −x −2 = 4 −2 −2 = 0.
♦
The symbol
at the end of the proof of Result 3.13 indicates that the proof is complete. This
symbol is commonly used for this purpose. Over the years, many wrote Q.E.D. to indicate the end of
a proof. Some still do. Q.E.D. is an abbreviation for the Latin phrase “quod erat demonstrandum,”
whose English translation is “which was to be demonstrated.”

3.2. DIRECT PROOF
91
A familiar property of real numbers is:
a2 ≥0 for every real number a and a2 > 0 if a ̸= 0.
(3.13)
This is useful in the proof of the following result.
Result to Prove: Let x be a real number. If (x −1)2 ≤0, then 3x −2x2 ≥0.
Proof Strategy.
In a direct proof, we would begin by assuming that (x −1)2 ≤0. However, by
(3.13) we already know that (x −1)2 ≥0. This means that (x −1)2 = 0 and so x = 1. Now that we
know x = 1, we are able to conclude that 3x −2x2 ≥0.
♦
Result 3.14
Let x be a real number. If (x −1)2 ≤0, then 3x −2x2 ≥0.
Proof. Assume that (x−1)2 ≤0. Since (x−1)2 ≥0 as well, it follows that (x−1)2 = 0. Therefore,
x −1 = 0 and so x = 1. Hence 3x −2x2 = 3 · 1 −2 · 12 = 3 −2 = 1 ≥0.
In order to illustrate any proof technique in some detail, we need to deal with areas of mathemat-
ics with which we are all familiar. Probably one such area involves even and odd integers. Although
we have encountered even and odd integers before and probably have a good understanding of these
numbers, in order to be precise we now give the standard deﬁnitions of these two concepts.
Deﬁnition 3.15
An integer n is even if n = 2a for some integer a.
An integer n is odd if
n = 2b + 1 for some integer b.
These deﬁnitions of even and odd integers are consequences of the fact that any even integer has
a remainder of 0 when divided by 2 and an odd integer has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.
Since these are the only two possible remainders when an integer is divided by 2, every integer is
either even or odd. This will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7. For example, 6, 0 and −10
are even since 6 = 2 · 3, 0 = 2 · 0 and −10 = 2 · (−5), where, of course, 3, 0 and −5 are integers. In
addition, 5, 1 and −7 are odd since 5 = 2 · 2 + 1, 1 = 2 · 0 + 1 and −7 = 2 · (−4) + 1, where 2, 0 and
−4 are integers.
Before giving some examples, we make some assumptions, namely:
If a and b are integers, then so too are −a, a + b and ab.
(3.14)
Although we are surely familiar with many properties of even and odd integers, such as the sum of
two even integers is even and the product of two odd integers is odd, we do not allow ourselves to
make any such assumptions about even and odd integers. We are required to prove such properties
of even and odd integers. On the other hand, once we have proved any of these, we can use these
properties. We now give an example of a direct proof of a result dealing with even and odd integers.
Result to Prove: If n is an odd integer, then 5n + 3 is an even integer.
Proof Strategy. As always, we begin a direct proof with an assumption. In this case, we assume
that n is an odd integer. By the deﬁnition of an odd integer, we can write n = 2k + 1 for some
integer k. Our goal is to show that 5n + 3 is an even integer, that is, to show that we can write
5n + 3 as 2ℓfor some integer ℓ. Since n = 2k + 1, this suggests making this substitution for n in
5n + 3.
♦
Result 3.16
If n is an odd integer, then 5n + 3 is an even integer.
Proof. Let n be an odd integer. Therefore, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then
5n + 3 = 5(2k + 1) + 3 = 10k + 5 + 3 = 10k + 8 = 2(5k + 4).
By the properties in (3.14), 5k + 4 is an integer. Therefore, 5n + 3 is an even integer.

92
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
Proof Analysis.
In the proof of Result 3.16, we used the fact that 5k is an integer since 5 and k
are integers. Also, since 5k and 4 are integers, so is 5k + 4. Finally, since 5n + 3 is written as twice
an integer, it follows that 5n + 3 is an even integer.
♦
We now give another direct proof involving even and odd integers.
Result 3.17
If n is an even integer, then n2 + 4n −3 is odd.
Proof. Let n be an even integer. Therefore, n = 2k for some integer k. Then
n2 + 4n −3
=
(2k)2 + 4(2k) −3 = 4k2 + 8k −3
=
4k2 + 8k −4 + 1 = 2(2k2 + 4k −2) + 1.
Again by (3.14), 2k2 + 4k −2 is an integer and so n2 + 4n −3 is odd.
Proof Analysis.
In the proof of Result 3.17, we wanted to show that n2 + 4n −3 is odd. We
were able to show that n2 + 4n −3 could be written as 4k2 + 8k −3 for some integer k. Since
4k2 + 8k −3 = 2(2k2 + 4k −1) −1, it may seem that this shows that n2 + 4n −3 is odd. But it
doesn’t. An integer m was deﬁned to be odd if it can be written as 2b + 1 for some integer b, not as
2b −1. It is essential that we have an understanding of all deﬁnitions.
♦
It is often the case that when a direct proof of
For all x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x).
is to be given, the opening step where P(x) is assumed to be true for an arbitrary element x ∈S
is not included. This step is simply understood and accepted. Let’s illustrate this in the following
example.
Result 3.18
If n is an even integer, then so is 5n3.
Proof. Since n is even, n = 2k for some integer k. Therefore,
5n3 = 5(2k)3 = 5(8k3) = 40k3 = 2(20k3).
Since 20k3 is an integer, 5n3 is even.
We have seen that statements can be constructed from open sentences involving two or more
variables. Let P(x, y) and Q(x, y) be open sentences, where the domain of x is S and the domain of
y is T . There are occasions when a direct proof can be used to show that the statement
For x ∈S and y ∈T , P(x, y) ⇒Q(x, y).
is true. In this case, we assume that P(x, y) is true for an arbitrary element x ∈S and an arbitrary
element y ∈T and we then show that Q(x, y) is true.
Our next example involves rational numbers. Recall that a real number r is rational if r = a/b,
where a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0. We also use the fact:
The product of two real numbers is nonzero if and only if both numbers are nonzero.
The contrapositive of this biconditional is:
The product of two real numbers is 0 if and only if at least one of these two numbers is 0.
Result to Prove: If r and s are rational numbers, then r + s is a rational number.
Proof Strategy.
As usual, we begin by assuming that r and s are rational numbers. This means
that r = a/b and s = c/d, where a, b, c, d ∈Z and b, d ̸= 0. We now only need to add the two
fractions a/b and c/d and show that the sum can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, where
the denominator is nonzero.
♦

3.2. DIRECT PROOF
93
Result 3.19
If r and s are rational numbers, then r + s is a rational number.
Proof. Since r and s are rational numbers, r = a/b and s = c/d, where a, b, c, d ∈Z and b, d ̸= 0.
Therefore
r + s = a
b + c
d = ad + bc
bd
.
Since ad + bc and bd are integers and bd ̸= 0, the number r + s is rational.
Analysis. It is convenient here to analyze the statement of Result 3.19, not the proof. We used
the symbols r and s for convenience in stating the result. Certainly other symbols could have been
used. Indeed, Result 3.19 could have been stated as
The sum of two rational numbers is rational.
If this had been the statement of Result 3.19, then it would probably have been good to begin the
proof by saying: Let r and s be two rational numbers. Then we have convenient symbols to use.
The proof would then continue as written above.

3.3
Proof by Contrapositive
Recall, for two statements or open sentences P and Q, that the contrapositive of the implication
P ⇒Q is the implication (∼Q) ⇒(∼P). Furthermore, by Theorem 1.46, for two statements P
and Q, the implication P ⇒Q and its contrapositive (∼Q) ⇒(∼P) are logically equivalent, that
is,
P ⇒Q
≡
(∼Q) ⇒(∼P).
Consequently, for every two statements P and Q,
P ⇒Q and (∼Q) ⇒(∼P) are either both true or both false.
This provides us with another method to prove that the statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x)
is true. If we can verify that its contrapositive
∀x ∈S, (∼Q(x)) ⇒(∼P(x))
is true using a direct proof, then we will have proved that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true. This
method of proof is called a proof by contrapositive. Let’s summarize what is done in a proof by
contrapositive.

3.3. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITIVE
95
To prove that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true using a proof by contrapositive, we begin by
assuming that Q(x) is false for an arbitrary element x ∈S and then we show that P(x)
is also false.
We now give an example of a proof by contrapositive.
Result 3.20
Let n be an integer. If 7n + 3 is an odd integer, then n is an even integer.
Proof. Assume that n is not an even integer. Then n is an odd integer and so n = 2k + 1 for some
integer k. Therefore,
7n + 3 = 7(2k + 1) + 3 = 14k + 10 = 2(7k + 5).
Since 7k + 5 is an integer, 7n + 3 is even.
Proof Analysis. The contrapositive of the implication
If 7n + 3 is an odd integer, then n is an even integer.
is the implication
If n is not an even integer, then 7n + 3 is not an odd integer.
(3.15)
Since we were giving a proof by contrapositive, we proved the implication (3.15) by a direct proof
and so we began by assuming that n is not an even integer. Thus n is an odd integer and so n can
be expressed as 2k + 1 for some integer k. It only remained then to show that 7n + 3 is not odd. ♦
One question that might have occurred to you as we look back at the proof we gave in Result 3.20
is why we decided to use a proof by contrapositive rather than a direct proof. If we had decided to
use a direct proof, then we would have started the proof by assuming that 7n + 3 is an odd integer.
So 7n + 3 = 2a + 1 for some integer a. We are then required to show that n is an even integer. This
probably suggests solving 7n + 3 = 2a + 1 for n. When we do this, we get n = (2a −2)/7. However,
now what do we do? It’s probably not clear. In fact, if we weren’t already informed that n is an
integer, we wouldn’t know that n is an integer, much less an even integer. On the other hand, if we
use a proof by contrapositive, then we begin by assuming that n is an odd integer. As we saw in
the proof of Result 3.20, the argument goes quite simply after that. Therefore, the decision to use
a proof by contrapositive was based on allowing us to make an initial assumption that leads to a
clear and simple proof.
We consider another example.
Result 3.21
Let n be an integer. If 5n + 2 is an odd integer, then n is an odd integer.
Proof. Assume that n is an even integer. Then n = 2k for some integer k. Hence
5n + 2 = 5(2k) + 2 = 10k + 2 = 2(5k + 1).
Since 5k + 1 is an integer, 5n + 2 is even.
We give one additional example where proof by contrapositive is the appropriate proof technique
to use.
Result 3.22
Let x be a real number. If x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1 ≤0, then x < 0.
Proof. Assume that x ≥0. Then x3 ≥0, 3x2 ≥0 and 2x ≥0. Thus
x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1 ≥0 + 0 + 0 + 1 > 0.

96
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
Proofs of Biconditionals
We next consider the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇔Q(x)
constructed from two open sentences P(x) and Q(x) over a domain S. Recall that the biconditional
P(x) ⇔Q(x) is deﬁned as (P(x) ⇒Q(x)) ∧(Q(x) ⇒P(x)), which is the conjunction of an
implication and its converse. Therefore, we have the following.
To prove that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇔Q(x) is true, we must prove that both ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒
Q(x) is true and ∀x ∈S, Q(x) ⇒P(x) is true.
Result to Prove:
Let n be an integer. Then 3n + 8 is odd if and only if n is odd.
Proof Strategy. To prove this result, we must prove for every integer n that both “3n + 8 is odd
if n is odd” and “3n + 8 is odd only if n is odd” are true. The ﬁrst of these (the “if” part of the “if
and only if”) can also be expressed as:
If n is odd, then 3n + 8 is odd.
It is natural to use a direct proof to prove this implication. The converse of this implication is “3n+8
is odd only if n is odd” (the “only if” part of the “if and only if”), which can also be expressed as
If 3n + 8 is odd, then n is odd.
It would seem reasonable to use a proof by contrapositive to prove this implication.
♦
Result 3.23
Let n be an integer. Then 3n + 8 is odd if and only if n is odd.
Proof. First, we prove that if n is an odd integer, then 3n + 8 is odd. Assume that n is odd. Then
n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. So
3n + 8 = 3(2k + 1) + 8 = 6k + 11 = 2(3k + 5) + 1.
Since 3k + 5 is an integer, 3n + 8 is odd.
Next, we verify the converse, namely, if 3n + 8 is odd, then n is odd. Assume that n is even.
Then n = 2ℓfor some integer ℓ. Therefore,
3n + 8 = 3(2ℓ) + 8 = 6ℓ+ 8 = 2(3ℓ+ 4).
Since 3ℓ+ 4 is an integer, 3n + 8 is even.
Proof Analysis.
In the proof of Result 3.23, we saw that there were two implications to verify.
When we veriﬁed that “if n is an odd integer, then 3n + 8 is odd,” we assumed that n is odd and
so wrote that n = 2k + 1 for some integer k; while when we veriﬁed that “if 3n + 8 is odd, then n
is odd,” we assumed that n is even and wrote that n = 2ℓfor some integer ℓ. Although we chose
to use diﬀerent symbols, namely k and ℓ, for the integers they represent since these integers are
almost certainly diﬀerent, we could have chosen the same symbol, say k, for each as two diﬀerent
implications were being veriﬁed in this proof.
♦
The following example will be helpful to us soon. Consequently, we refer to it as a theorem.
Theorem to Prove: Let n be an integer. Then n2 is even if and only if n is even.
Proof Strategy. Because the statement we wish to prove is a biconditional, we have two implica-
tions to prove, namely “n2 is even if n is even” and “n2 is even only if n is even.” The implication
“n2 is even if n is even” (the “if” part of the “if and only if”) can be written as
If n is even, then n2 is even.

3.3. PROOF BY CONTRAPOSITIVE
97
We will prove this implication with a direct proof. Its converse is the implication “n2 is even only
if n is even” (the “only if” part of the “if and only if”) and can be expressed as:
If n2 is even, then n is even.
We will use a proof by contrapositive to prove this implication.
♦
Theorem 3.24
Let n be an integer. Then n2 is even if and only if n is even.
Proof. Assume that n is even. Then n = 2a, where a is an integer. Therefore,
n2 = (2a)2 = 4a2 = 2(2a2).
Because 2a2 is an integer, n2 is even.
Next, we verify the converse. Assume that n is odd. So n = 2b + 1, where b ∈Z. Then
n2 = (2b + 1)2 = 4b2 + 4b + 1 = 2(2b2 + 2b) + 1.
Since 2b2 + 2b is an integer, n2 is odd.
Since the contrapositive of the implication “if n is even, then n2 is even” is
if n2 is odd, then n is odd.
while the contrapositive of the implication “if n2 is even, then n is even” is
if n is odd, then n2 is odd.
it follows that Theorem 3.24 can also be worded as follows.
Theorem 3.25
Let n be an integer. Then n2 is odd if and only if n is odd.

Result Let n ∈Z. Then 5n + 7 is even only if n is odd.
Next, consider the following:

Assume ﬁrst that n is an odd integer. Then n = 2a+1 for some integer a. Therefore,
5n + 7 = 5(2a + 1) + 7 = 10a + 5 + 7 = 10a + 12 = 2(5a + 6).
Since 5a + 6 is an integer, 5n + 7 is even.
Next, assume that n is an even integer. Then n = 2b for some integer b. Hence
5n + 7 = 5(2b) + 7 = 10b + 7 = 2(5b + 3) + 1.
Since 5b + 3 is an integer, 5n + 7 is odd.
What is wrong with the preceding proof?
3.4
Proof by Cases
Suppose that R(x) is an open sentence over a domain S and, as usual, we wish to prove that the
quantiﬁed statement ∀x ∈S, R(x) is true. If we are using a direct proof, then we would begin with
an arbitrary element x in S and attempt to show that R(x) is true. There are some occasions when
knowing that x ∈S doesn’t seem to provide enough information to show that R(x) is true. In such
instances, it may be useful to consider a collection P of two or more subsets of S such that every
element of S belongs to at least one of these subsets. Typically, P is a partition of S. The proof
is then divided into cases, according to which subset in P the element x belongs. The fact that x
belongs to a speciﬁc subset of S may provide just the additional information about x we need that
allows us to give a proof.
For example, if we are attempting to prove that a statement concerning an integer n is true,
then partitioning Z into the set of even integers and the set of odd integers may be a key step in
obtaining a proof. Also, if we are attempting to prove some statement dealing with the absolute
value |x| of a real number x, then it may be useful to consider the partition of R into the set of
positive real numbers, the set of negative real numbers and {0} or perhaps the partition of R into
{x ∈R : x ≥0} and {x ∈R : x < 0}.
In summary then, if we wish to prove some statement concerning an element x in a set S, then
it might be useful to consider a partition P of S into two or more subsets of S. The proof can then
be divided into cases, according to the particular subset in P to which x belongs. This is called a
proof by cases. We now illustrate this approach.
Result to Prove: If n is an integer, then n2 −n is an even integer.
Proof Strategy. If we begin with an integer n, then there seems to be no way to show that n2 −n
is an even integer. Certainly, n is even or n is odd. If n is even, then we can write n = 2a for some
integer a and showing that n2 −n is even is no longer diﬃcult. Similarly, if n is odd, then we can
write n = 2b + 1 for some integer b and again showing that n2 −n is even is straightforward.
♦

3.4. PROOF BY CASES
99
Result 3.26
If n is an integer, then n2 −n is an even integer.
Proof. Let n be an integer. We consider two cases, according to whether n is even or n is odd.
Case 1. n is even. Then n = 2a for some integer a. Therefore,
n2 −n = (2a)2 −(2a) = 4a2 −2a = 2(2a2 −a).
Since 2a2 −a is an integer, n2 −n is even.
Case 2. n is odd. Then n = 2b + 1 for some integer b. Therefore,
n2 −n
=
(2b + 1)2 −(2b + 1) = (4b2 + 4b + 1) −(2b + 1)
=
4b2 + 2b = 2(2b2 + b).
Since 2b2 + b is an integer, n2 −n is even.
Parity of Integers
Two integers m and n are said to be of the same parity if they are both even or both odd;
otherwise, m and n are of opposite parity. For example, 3 and 7 are of the same parity, as are −2
and 10; while 3 and 8 are of opposite parity. Observe that every two integers are of the same parity
or of opposite parity (but not both). Therefore, the negation of “two integers m and n are of the
same parity” is “two integers m and n are of opposite parity.” We now consider an example dealing
with these ideas.
Result to Prove: Let m and n be two integers. Then 3m + 5n is even if and only if m and n are
of the same parity.
Proof Strategy. There are two implications to prove here. One of these is “if m and n are of the
same parity, then 3m+5n is even.” Either we want to use a direct proof or a proof by contrapositive.
If we were to use a proof by contrapositive, then we would begin the proof by assuming that 3m+5n
is odd. We would then want to show that m and n are of opposite parity. But how would we do
this? Using a direct proof seems to be the appropriate method. We would then begin the proof by
assuming that m and n are of the same parity. Since this means that either m and n are both even
or m and n are both odd, it immediately suggests a proof by cases.
The second implication is “if 3m + 5n is even, then m and n are of the same parity.” Here the
reasonable proof technique is a proof by contrapositive, where we would begin by assuming that m
and n are of opposite parity and divide the proof into the two cases (1) m is even and n is odd and
(2) m is odd and n is even.
♦
Result 3.27
Let m and n be two integers. Then 3m + 5n is even if and only if m and n are of the
same parity.
Proof. First, we show that if m and n are of the same parity, then 3m+5n is even. We use a direct
proof to do this. Assume that m and n are of the same parity. We consider two cases.
Case 1. m and n are even. Therefore, m = 2a and n = 2b for integers a and b. So
3m + 5n = 3(2a) + 5(2b) = 6a + 10b = 2(3a + 5b).
Since 3a + 5b is an integer, 3m + 5n is even.
Case 2. m and n are odd. Then m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b + 1, where a, b ∈Z. Hence
3m + 5n
=
3(2a + 1) + 5(2b + 1) = 6a + 3 + 10b + 5
=
6a + 10b + 8 = 2(3a + 5b + 4).

100
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
Since 3a + 5b + 4 is an integer, 3m + 5n is even.
Next, we verify the converse, that is, if 3m + 5n is even, then m and n are of the same parity.
We establish this using a proof by contrapositive. Assume that m and n are of opposite parity. We
consider two cases.
Case 1. m is even and n is odd. So m = 2a and n = 2b + 1 for integers a and b. Therefore,
3m + 5n = 3(2a) + 5(2b + 1) = 6a + 10b + 5 = 2(3a + 5b + 2) + 1.
Since 3a + 5b + 2 is an integer, 3m + 5n is odd.
Case 2. m is odd and n is even. Thus m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b for integers a and b. Therefore,
3m + 5n = 3(2a + 1) + 5(2b) = 6a + 3 + 10b = 2(3a + 5b + 1) + 1.
Since 3a + 5b + 1 is an integer, 3m + 5n is odd.
Proof Analysis. In the preceding example, we ﬁrst used a direct proof to show that “if m and n
are of the same parity, then 3m + 5n is even” and considered two cases. We then used a proof by
contrapositive to show that “if 3m+5n is even, then m and n are of the same parity” and considered
two cases here as well. The ﬁrst implication we veriﬁed in the proof of Result 3.27 was “if m and n
are of the same parity, then 3m + 5n is even.” In Case 1, when m and n are both even, we wrote
m = 2a and n = 2b for integers a and b. In Case 2, when m and n are both odd, we wrote m = 2a+1
and n = 2b + 1 for integers a and b. Although it was perfectly permissible to use a and b in these
two cases since the two cases are independent of each other, it would be incorrect to write m = 2a
and n = 2a for some integer a in Case 1, say, for this would imply that m = n, which would be
incorrect, since the statement of Result 3.27 did not say that m and n are two equal integers.
♦
Without Loss of Generality
From time to time there are occasions when the proofs of two cases are so similar that including
proofs of both cases is repetitive. When this occurs, we ordinarily choose to prove only one case,
saying that we are doing this without loss of generality (that is, nothing is lost by considering
only one of the cases). We present one additional example to illustrate this idea.
Result 3.28
Let m and n be integers. Then mn is odd if and only if m and n are both odd.
Proof. First, we prove that if m and n are odd, then mn is odd. Let m and n be odd integers.
Then m = 2k + 1 and n = 2ℓ+ 1 for integers k and ℓ. Then
mn
=
(2k + 1)(2ℓ+ 1) = 4kℓ+ 2k + 2ℓ+ 1
=
2(2kℓ+ k + ℓ) + 1.
Since 2kℓ+ k + ℓis an integer, mn is odd.
Next, we verify the converse, namely if mn is odd, then m and n are both odd. We use a proof
by contrapositive. Suppose that m is even or n is even. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that m is even. Then m = 2k for some integer k. Thus
mn = (2k)n = 2(kn).
Since kn is an integer, mn is even.
Proof Analysis. In Result 3.28, when proving that if mn is odd, then m and n are both odd, we
used a proof by contrapositive. We began, therefore, by assuming that it is not the case that m and
n are odd. By De Morgan’s Law (Theorem 1.24), this means that m is even or n is even. Thus,
there are two cases, namely

3.4. PROOF BY CASES
101
Case 1: m is even.
Case 2: n is even.
(If m and n are both even, this situation would be covered by either case.) Since the proofs of these
two cases are very similar, we used the phrase “without loss of generality” (some abbreviate this as
WLOG or WOLOG) to indicate this and chose to prove only one of them. (See also Exercise 12.) ♦
In Example 2.31 of Chapter 2 we veriﬁed the following:
Let A, B and C be sets. Then (A −B) ∩(A −C) = A −(B ∪C).
We would now refer to this example as a result and a solution to the example as a proof of the
result. Verifying equality of sets often involves proofs by cases. We give an example of this.
Result 3.29
Let A, B and C be sets. Then
(A −B) ∪(A −C) = A −(B ∩C).
Proof. First, we show that (A −B) ∪(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∩C). Let x ∈(A −B) ∪(A −C). Then
x ∈A −B or x ∈A −C. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. x ∈A −B. Then x ∈A and x /∈B. Since x /∈B, it follows that x /∈B ∩C. Because x ∈A
and x /∈B ∩C, we have x ∈A −(B ∩C). Hence (A −B) ∪(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∩C).
Case 2. x ∈A −C. Then x ∈A and x /∈C. Because x /∈C, we have x /∈B ∩C. So x ∈A and
x /∈B ∩C. Therefore, x ∈A −(B ∩C). Consequently, (A −B) ∪(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∩C).
Next, we show that A −(B ∩C) ⊆(A −B) ∪(A −C). Let y ∈A −(B ∩C). Hence y ∈A and
y /∈B ∩C. Since y /∈B ∩C, either y /∈B or y /∈C. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. y /∈B. Since y ∈A, we have y ∈A −B. Therefore, y ∈(A −B) ∪(A −C) and so
A −(B ∩C) ⊆(A −B) ∪(A −C).
Case 2. y /∈C. Since y ∈A, it follows that y ∈A −C. Thus y ∈(A −B) ∪(A −C) and so
A −(B ∩C) ⊆(A −B) ∪(A −C).
Therefore, (A −B) ∪(A −C) = A −(B ∩C).
As in the proof of Result 3.28, a proof of Result 3.29 could also be given using “without loss of
generality” (in fact, using it twice). See Exercise 13.

3.5
Counterexamples
For an open sentence R(x) over a domain S, we have seen that the statement ∀x ∈S, R(x) is true
if R(x) is true for every element x ∈S. Recall also that
∼(∀x ∈S, R(x))
≡
∃x ∈S, ∼R(x)
and so that ∀x ∈S, R(x) is false if R(x) is a false statement for at least one element a ∈S. Often,
R(x) is an implication P(x) ⇒Q(x) for open sentences P(x) and Q(x) over S. We have described
two methods (direct proof and proof by contrapositive) that can be used to prove that a statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is true.
To show that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is false, however, we need
only show that there exists some element a ∈S such that P(a) ⇒Q(a) is false. Such an element
a ∈S is called a counterexample for (or of) the statement ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x). Therefore, a
counterexample of ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is an element a ∈S for which P(a) is true and Q(a) is
false. Such an element is said to disprove the statement. We now illustrate this.
Example 3.30
Disprove the following: Let n be an integer. If 4n + 5 is odd, then n is even.

3.5. COUNTEREXAMPLES
103
Solution. The integer n = 1 is a counterexample since 4n + 5 = 4 · 1 + 5 = 9 is odd and n = 1 is
not even.
♦
Analysis. Let’s reﬂect on Example 3.30 and the solution we gave. Since we were asked to disprove
Let n be an integer. If 4n + 5 is odd, then n is even.
we needed to present a counterexample, which, in this case, is an integer n for which “4n+5 is odd”
is true and “n is even” is false. We saw that the integer n = 1 has this property. (Actually, every
odd integer n is a counterexample here.)
♦
Example 3.31
Disprove the following: Let m, n ∈Z. The integer 3m + 7n is even if and only if
m and n are both even.
Solution. The integers m = 1 and n = 1 are not both even (in fact, m = 1 and n = 1 are both odd)
but 3m + 7n = 3 · 1 + 7 · 1 = 10 is even. So m = 1 and n = 1 is a counterexample.
♦
Analysis. The biconditional in Example 3.31 is the conjunction of two implications, namely
Let m, n ∈Z. If 3m + 7n is even, then m and n are both even.
(3.16)
and
Let m, n ∈Z. If m and n are both even, then 3m + 7n is even.
(3.17)
For the statement in Example 3.31 to be false, we need to show that at least one of the state-
ments (3.16) and (3.17) is false. Even though statement (3.17) is true, statement (3.16) is false. A
counterexample that disproves statement (3.16) is what we gave in the solution of Example 3.31. ♦
Example 3.32 Disprove: If x is a real number, then (x2 −2)2 > 0.
Solution. The number x =
√
2 is a counterexample since
(x2 −2)2 =
 (
√
2)2 −2
2 = (2 −2)2 = 0. ♦
The number x = −
√
2 would have also been a counterexample in Example 3.32. The following
example shows the importance of the domain involved in a quantiﬁed statement.
Example 3.33
Consider the two open sentences
P(x): |x| = 1.
Q(x): x3 = 1.
and the statement
∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x): Let x ∈S. If |x| = 1, then x3 = 1.
(3.18)
for two diﬀerent choices for the domain S of x.
First, let S = R+ be the set of positive real numbers. Then the implication is true since x = 1
is the only positive real number such that |x| = 1. Since 13 = 1, we have proved that the statement
(3.18) is true.
Second, let S = R be the set of real numbers. Then the implication is false. Note that there
are two real numbers x for which |x| = 1, namely, x = 1 and x = −1. If x = 1, then x3 = 13 = 1.
However, if x = −1, then x3 = (−1)3 = −1 ̸= 1. Therefore, the implication P(−1) ⇒Q(−1) is false
and x = −1 is a counterexample of the statement (3.18).

3.6. EXISTENCE PROOFS

3.6
Existence Proofs
We have been investigating the truth or falseness of quantiﬁed statements of the type ∀x ∈S, R(x),
where R(x) is an open sentence over a domain S. We now turn to quantiﬁed statements of the type
∃x ∈S, R(x). Recall that a statement ∃x ∈S, R(x) is true if R(x) is true for at least one element
x ∈S. In this case, a proof requires showing only that there is some element a ∈S for which R(a)
is true. This is called an existence proof.
Result 3.34
There exists an integer n such that 2 −n2 > 0.
Proof. Let n = 1. Then 2 −n2 = 2 −12 = 1 > 0.
In the proof of Result 3.34, it was not particularly diﬃcult to notice that n = 1 had the desired
property that 2 −n2 > 0. Had we selected n = −1 or n = 0, this too would have resulted in a
successful proof.
Result 3.35
There exist integers m and n of the same parity such that
(m −1)2 + (n −4)2 ≤1.
Proof. Let m = 2 and n = 4. Then
(m −1)2 + (n −4)2 = (2 −1)2 + (4 −4)2 = 1 + 0 ≤1,
as desired.
A correct proof of Result 3.35 could have also been given by selecting (1) m = 0, n = 4, (2)
m = 1, n = 5 or (3) m = 1, n = 3.
Result 3.36
There exists a real number x such that x2 −8 = 0.
Proof. Let x =
√
8. Then x2 −8 = (
√
8)2 −8 = 8 −8 = 0.
A proof of Result 3.36 consists only of ﬁnding a real number solution of the equation x2 −8 = 0.
This equation has two solutions of course, namely
√
8 and −

8.
For the next result, it is useful to recall that we mentioned that
√
2 is an irrational number.
Although we have never veriﬁed that fact, we will in the next section (in Theorem 3.49).

There exist rational numbers a and b such that ab is irrational.
Proof. If a = 2 and b = 1/2, then ab = 2

To give a proof of Result 3.37, it was useful to recall that for every positive real number a,
the number a

2 is √a. Result 3.37 suggests another question and illustrates an important point.
An existence statement can be veriﬁed, either by giving an appropriate example or by showing an
appropriate example must exist even if a speciﬁc example can’t be found.

♦
Recall that a statement ∃x ∈S, R(x) is false only when R(x) is a false statement for every x ∈S.
Establishing such a fact requires a diﬀerent kind of argument.
Example 3.39
Disprove the following statement:
There exists x ∈R such that x4 + 2 = 2x2.
(3.19)
Before providing a solution for Example 3.39, let’s consider what we are being asked to do. We
are being asked to show that the statement is false. If there did exist a real number x such that
x4 + 2 = 2x2, then such a real number x would be a solution of this equation. However, we are
being asked to show that the statement (3.19) is false, that is, we are being asked to show that the
equation x4 + 2 = 2x2 has no real number solutions. This is logically equivalent to the statement
For every real number x, x4 + 2 ̸= 2x2.
Observing that the equation x4 + 2 = 2x2 can be written as x4 −2x2 + 2 = 0 suggests a method for
solving this problem.
Solution of Example 3.39. Let x ∈R. Since
x4 −2x2 + 2 = (x4 −2x2 + 1) + 1 = (x2 −1)2 + 1 ≥0 + 1 = 1 > 0,
it follows that x4 −2x2 + 2 ̸= 0 and so x4 + 2 ̸= 2x2 for every real number x.
♦
There are instances when we encounter quantiﬁed statements containing both universal and
existential quantiﬁers. For example, suppose that R(x, y) is an open sentence containing variables
x and y, where the domain of x is S and the domain of y is T . Then the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y)
can be expressed as:
For every x ∈S, there exists y ∈T such that R(x, y);
while the quantiﬁed statement
∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y)
can be expressed as:
There exists x ∈S such that for every y ∈T , R(x, y).
We now illustrate both kinds of quantiﬁed statements, along with a proof of each.
Result to Prove:
For every irrational number s, there exists a rational number r such that rs is
irrational.
Proof Strategy. The statement we wish to prove can also be expressed as an implication.
If s is an irrational number, then there exists a rational number r such that rs is irra-
tional.

3.6. EXISTENCE PROOFS
107
If we were to give a direct proof of this statement, then we would begin with an arbitrary irrational
number s. Our goal then is to show that there is some rational number r such that rs is irrational.
The number r = 1 has this property.
♦
Result 3.40 For every irrational number s, there exists a rational number r such that rs is irra-
tional.
Proof. Let s be an irrational number. Consider the rational number r = 1. Thus rs = 1 · s = s is
irrational.
Result to Prove:
There exists a rational number r such that for every irrational number s, the
number rs is rational.
Proof Strategy.
A proof in this case consists of ﬁnding a rational number r having the property
that rs is rational for every irrational number s. Observe that r = 0 has this property.
♦
Result 3.41 There exists a rational number r such that for every irrational number s, the number
rs is rational.
Proof. Let r = 0. Then for each irrational number s, it follows that rs = 0 · s = 0 is rational.
Recall that the negation of ∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y) is
∼(∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, ∼R(x, y).
Therefore, to show that the quantiﬁed statement ∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, R(x, y) is false, we must show that
there exists some x ∈S such that for every y ∈T , R(x, y) is false.
Example 3.42
Disprove the following statement: For every positive integer n, there exists a negative integer m
such that n + m = 1.
Solution. Consider the positive integer n = 1. Then for every negative integer m,
n + m = 1 + m ≤1 + (−1) = 0.
Therefore, n = 1 is a counterexample.
♦
We have seen that the negation of ∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y) is
∼(∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y))
≡
∀x ∈S, ∃y ∈T, ∼R(x, y).
Therefore, to show that the quantiﬁed statement ∃x ∈S, ∀y ∈T, R(x, y) is false, we must show that
for every element x ∈S, there exists an element y ∈T such that R(x, y) is false.
Example 3.43
Disprove the following statement: There exists a positive integer n such that for every negative
integer m, n + m < 0.
Solution. We show that no positive integer has this property. Let n be a positive integer. Then
m = −n is a negative integer and n + m = n + (−n) = 0.

3.7
Proof by Contradiction
Let R be a mathematical statement that we would like to show is true. If R is expressed as ∀x ∈S,
P(x) ⇒Q(x) for open sentences P(x) and Q(x) over a domain S, then we have already described two
methods we might use to verify the truth of R, namely a direct proof and a proof by contrapositive.
We now describe yet a third method. Suppose, by assuming that R is false, we are able to deduce a
statement that contradicts some known fact or some assumption we made in the proof. If we denote
the fact or assumption by P, then what we have deduced is ∼P. Thus we now have produced the
contradiction P ∧(∼P), which we also denote by C. We therefore have the truth of the implication
(∼R) ⇒C. However, since C is false and (∼R) ⇒C is true, it follows (by the truth table for
implication) that ∼R is false and so R is true, which is the desired outcome. This method of proof
is called a proof by contradiction. Let’s summarize what is done in a proof by contradiction.
To verify that a statement R is true using a proof by contradiction, we assume that R is
false and, from this, obtain a contradiction. If R is expressed in terms of an implication,
say R : ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x), then we begin a proof by contradiction by assuming that
R is false, that is, by assuming that ∀x ∈S, P(x) ⇒Q(x) is false. We have seen that
this means there exists some element x ∈S for which P(x) is true and Q(x) is false.
We then attempt to produce a contradiction from this.

3.7. PROOF BY CONTRADICTION
109
We now give some illustrations of proof by contradiction.
Result to Prove: There is no smallest positive real number.
Proof Strategy. Since we are proving this statement by contradiction, we begin by assuming that
the statement is false. Hence we assume that there exists a smallest positive real number. Once
we know a certain object exists, it is often helpful to give this object a name. So suppose that this
smallest positive real number is denoted by r. Our goal now is to contradict some assumption or
fact. This is always the diﬃcult part of the proof. In this case, a contradiction would be produced
if we can ﬁnd a positive real number that is smaller than r. That is a key to this proof.
♦
Result 3.44
There is no smallest positive real number.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a smallest positive real number, say r. Since
0 < r/2 < r, it follows that r/2 is a positive real number that is smaller than r, which is a
contradiction.
Proof Analysis.
In the proof of Result 3.44, we wrote 0 < r/2 < r and assumed that these
inequalities would be clear to the reader. If it was felt that these inequalities needed to be justiﬁed,
then we could write (for the positive real number r) that 0 < r < r + r = 2r and so
0 < r < 2r.
(3.20)
Dividing the inequality in (3.20) by the positive number 2 gives us the desired 0 < r/2 < r.
♦
Another comment about the proof of Result 3.44 may be useful here. Since we were giving a
proof by contradiction, we started by assuming that the statement is false. In the proof, we used
the phrase to the contrary. This is a common signal that is used to indicate that we have assumed
the statement we wish to prove is false and that a proof by contradiction is being given.
Result 3.45
No even integer can be expressed as the sum of an even integer and an odd integer.
Proof. Suppose that the statement is false. Then there exists an even integer n that can be expressed
as the sum of an even integer x and an odd integer y. So x = 2a and y = 2b + 1, where a, b ∈Z.
Therefore,
n = x + y = (2a) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b) + 1.
Since a + b is an integer, n is odd. This contradicts the assumption that n is even.
Proof Analysis.
Once again, a proof by contradiction was used as the proof technique to verify
Result 3.45. As expected, we assumed that the statement is false, that is, we assumed that there is
some even integer that is the sum of an even integer and an odd integer. Notice that in the proof,
each of these integers was represented by a symbol (namely, n, x and y, respectively). This allowed
us to write a simpler and clearer proof.
A diﬀerent “proof” for Result 3.45 might have occurred to you. Suppose that x is an even integer
and y is an odd integer. Then x = 2a and y = 2b + 1 for integers a and b. Therefore,
x + y = (2a) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b) + 1.
Since a + b is an integer, x + y is odd. This is not a proof of Result 3.45, however. What this proves
is that the sum of an even integer and an odd integer is odd. This is not what Result 3.45 says.
What Result 3.45 says is that for any even integer n under consideration, we cannot express n as
the sum of an even integer and an odd integer.
♦
Result 3.46
The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.

110
CHAPTER 3. METHODS OF PROOF
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exist a rational number r and an irrational number s
such that t = r + s is rational. Since r and t are rational, r = a/b and t = c/d, where a, b, c, d ∈Z
and b, d ̸= 0. Therefore,
c
d = t = r + s = a
b + s;
so
s = c
d −a
b = bc −ad
bd
.
Since bc−ad and bd are integers and bd ̸= 0, it follows that s is a rational number, which contradicts
our assumption that s is irrational.
One question that often occurs with any statement we wish to prove is:
How do we know which proof technique to use when attempting to verify the truth of a
statement?
Unfortunately, the answer is: We don’t know, at least we don’t always know. It is often unclear
even for experienced mathematicians to determine which proof technique to use. In fact, sometimes
no technique seems to work. Having just said this, however, there is something that the statements
in Results 3.44 – 3.46 have in common. All are negative-sounding. That may be less obvious in
Result 3.46 but that result deals with irrational numbers, which are real numbers that are not
rational. Proof by contradiction is the common method of proof in such instances.
We now illustrate proof by contradiction with two examples where this would not be the expected
method of proof. These examples are meant only to show that there is not always just one technique
that can be used to verify the truth of a given statement.
Result 3.47
If n is an odd integer, then 3n −11 is even.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists an odd integer n such that 3n −11 is also odd.
Since n is odd, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Therefore,
3n −11 = 3(2k + 1) −11 = 6k −8 = 2(3k −4).
Since 3k −4 is an integer, 3n −11 is even. This, however, contradicts our assumption that 3n −11
is odd.
Result 3.48
Let n be an integer. If 5n + 1 is odd, then n is even.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists an integer n such that 5n + 1 is odd and n is odd.
Since n is odd, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Therefore,
5n + 1 = 5(2k + 1) + 1 = 10k + 5 + 1 = 2(5k + 3).
Since 5k + 3 is an integer, 5n + 1 is even. This, however, contradicts our assumption that 5n + 1 is
odd.
We have mentioned a few times that
√
2 is an irrational number. The proof of this fact is one of
the best known examples of a proof by contradiction. In the proof it is useful to recall Theorem 3.24:
Let n be an integer. Then n2 is even if and only if n is even.
One other comment is useful. A fraction a/b is reduced to lowest terms if a and b contain no common
integer factors greater than 1. For example, 3/2 is reduced to lowest terms while 6/4 is not as 6 and
4 have 2 as a common factor.
Theorem 3.49
The real number
√
2 is irrational.

3.7. PROOF BY CONTRADICTION
111
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that
√
2 is rational. Then
√
2 = a/b, where a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0.
We may further assume that a/b has been reduced to lowest terms. Squaring both sides, we obtain
2 = a2/b2 and so a2 = 2b2. Since b2 is an integer, a2 is even. By Theorem 3.24, a is even as well and
so a = 2c for some integer c. Thus, a2 = (2c)2 = 4c2 = 2b2 and so b2 = 2c2. Since c2 is an integer,
b2 is even. Again, by Theorem 3.24, b is even. Therefore, a and b are both even and so contain 2 as
a common factor, which contradicts our assumption that a/b has been reduced to lowest terms.
Proof Analysis.
The subtle aspect of this proof is noticing that our assumption that a/b has
been reduced to lowest terms has resulted in a contradiction. Perhaps even more subtle is observing
that it might be worthwhile to express a/b in lowest terms.
As we mentioned, when giving a
proof by contradiction, it is often diﬃcult to know where a contradiction will occur and what this
contradiction might be.

Mathematical Induction
For an open sentence R(x) over a domain S, we have now seen three proof techniques that can be
used to verify the truth of the quantiﬁed statement
∀x ∈S, R(x): For all x ∈S, R(x).
These three proof techniques are direct proof, proof by contrapositive and proof by contradiction.
If S = N, then there is another valuable method of proof that may be successful to prove that the
quantiﬁed statement ∀x ∈S, R(x) is true. This method is called mathematical induction or simply
induction and is typically used to prove quantiﬁed statements of the type ∀n ∈N, P(n), where P(n)
then is an open sentence over the domain N.
There have been attempts to prove quantiﬁed statements of the type ∀n ∈N, P(n) by induction-
like arguments that go back many centuries. About a thousand years ago, Abu al-Karaji, who lived
near Baghdad much of his life, attempted to give an argument for generating the rows in the Pascal
triangle (see Chapter 9, Section 9.1). He gave an argument for n = 1 and an argument for n = 2
based on his argument for n = 1 and an argument for n = 3 based on what he did for n = 2. He
continued this a bit further and then stated that this process could be continued indeﬁnitely. Blaise
Pascal himself was not aware of what al-Karaji had done but during the middle of the 17th century
Pascal wrote the following:
Even though this proposition may have an inﬁnite number of cases, I shall give a very
short proof of it assuming two lemmas.
The ﬁrst, which is self evident, is that the
proposition is valid for the second row. The second is that if the proposition is valid
for any row then it must necessarily be valid for the following row. From this it can be
seen that it is necessarily valid for all rows; for it is valid for the second row by the ﬁrst
lemma; then by the second lemma it must be true for the third row and hence for the
fourth row and so on to inﬁnity.
The method of proof that Pascal was attempting to use was induction and, although his argument
lacks precision in that he was essentially trying to talk his way through a proof, he was on the right
track. In this chapter we introduce the powerful method of proof by mathematical induction.
4.1
The Principle of Mathematical Induction
Suppose that P(n) is an open sentence over the domain N of positive integers and we wish to prove
that the quantiﬁed statement
∀n ∈N, P(n)
(4.1)
is true. For the statement (4.1) to be true, P(n) must be a true statement for each positive integer n,
that is, all of the statements P(1), P(2), P(3), . . . must be true. Of course, if we can show that P(n)
115

116
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
is true for an arbitrary positive integer n, then we have veriﬁed (4.1) by means of a direct proof. On
the other hand, if we can produce a contradiction by assuming that there exists a positive integer n
such that P(n) is false, then we have veriﬁed (4.1) using a proof by contradiction. However, there
are occasions when neither of these techniques may be successful. Certainly, it is not practical to
verify the truth of the statements P(1), P(2), P(3), . . . one by one. Fortunately, there is another
method of proof that allows us to establish the truth of (4.1) by verifying that P(n) is true when
n = 1 and establishing the truth of a certain implication. This method is a consequence of the
following principle.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction The statement
∀n ∈N, P(n) : For every positive integer n, P(n).
is true if
(1) P(1) is true and
(2) the statement ∀k ∈N, P(k) ⇒P(k + 1) is true.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction therefore states that all of the statements P(1), P(2),
P(3), . . . are true if we can show that P(1) is true and prove the following:
Let k ∈N. If P(k), then P(k + 1).
(4.2)
A proof of the statement ∀n ∈N, P(n) using the Principle of Mathematical Induction is called
an induction proof, a proof by mathematical induction or simply a proof by induction.
Step (1) is often called the base or basis step (or the anchor) of the induction proof, while step (2)
is often called the inductive step of the induction proof. In (4.2), P(k) is often referred to as the
inductive hypothesis or induction hypothesis. Although a proof of (4.2) could be given by any
method, a direct proof is often used. In such a case, we assume that P(k) is a true statement for
an arbitrary positive integer k. Our goal then is to show that under this assumption, P(k + 1) is a
true statement.
Suppose that we have veriﬁed the truth of statements (1) and (2). Then, of course, we know
that P(1) is a true statement by (1) and that
If P(1), then P(2).
is true by (2). Since P(1) is true, it follows that P(2) is true. By the inductive step again,
If P(2), then P(3).
is true. Since P(2) is true, it follows that P(3) is true. By similar reasoning, P(4) is true, P(5)
is true and so on. Consequently, it is not surprising that verifying (1) and (2) in the Principle of
Mathematical Induction establishes the truth of all of the statements P(1), P(2), P(3), . . .. However,
simply saying the informal phrase “and so on” does not constitute a formal proof.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction is often accepted as a fundamental property of the
positive integers and is therefore taken as an axiom. Thus, we accept its truth without proof. Let’s
see how the Principle of Mathematical Induction works in practice.

Also, if k −1, k, k + 1 and k + 2 are positive integers, then P(k −1), P(k), P(k + 1) and P(k + 2)

By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the statement (4.3) can be shown to be true for every
positive integer n if
(1) the truth of the statement P(1) can be established and
(2) the truth of the statement:
Let k ∈N. If P(k), then P(k + 1).
can be established.
Consequently, we can prove that the statement (4.3) is true if we can (1) show that

and (2) verify the following implication for an arbitrary k ∈N:

Let’s now see how a proof of (4.3) can be given using the Principle of Mathematical Induction. ♦
When giving a proof by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it is customary for the writer
of the proof to inform the reader that a proof will be given using the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, which is typically expressed by saying that mathematical induction (or, more simply,
induction) is being used or employed.

CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
Proof.
We proceed by induction. First we verify that the statement is true for n = 1. Here we
need only observe that
1
1 · 2 =
1
1 + 1 to establish the base step. Next, we verify the inductive step.
Assume that
1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 + · · · +
1
k(k + 1) =
k
k + 1,
where k is a positive integer. We show that
1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 + · · · +
1
(k + 1)(k + 2) = k + 1
k + 2.
Observe that
1

2 · 3 + · · · +
1
(k + 1)(k + 2) =
 1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 + · · · +
1
k(k + 1)

+
1
(k + 1)(k + 2).
From our assumption of the inductive hypothesis above that
1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 + · · · +
1
k(k + 1) =
k
k + 1,
we have
1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 + · · · +
1
k(k + 1) +
1
(k + 1)(k + 2)
=
k
k + 1 +
1
(k + 1)(k + 2)
=
k(k + 2) + 1
(k + 1)(k + 2) =
k2 + 2k + 1
(k + 1)(k + 2)
=
(k + 1)2
(k + 1)(k + 2) = k + 1
k + 2.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it then follows that
1
1 · 2 +
1
2 · 3 +
1
3 · 4 + · · · +
1
n(n + 1) =
n
n + 1
for every positive integer n.
As we mentioned in Result 4.1, the Principle of Mathematical Induction is used to show that
there is a formula for the sum of the numbers
1
1 · 2,
1
2 · 3, . . . ,
1
n(n + 1),
where n is a positive integer. Actually, there are many such formulas that give the sum of numbers of
a certain type and these formulas are often veriﬁed by using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
We now consider additional examples of this type. Suppose that we are interested in obtaining a
formula for the sum of the ﬁrst n positive integers, where n ∈N. For 1 ≤n ≤5, observe that
1
=
1
1 + 2
=
3
1 + 2 + 3
=
6
1 + 2 + 3 + 4
=
10
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
=
15.
This may or may not suggest a formula for the sum 1 + 2 + · · · + n. However, if we write
A = 1 + 2 + · · · + n

4.1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
119
and then write the terms of this sum in reverse order, we also have
A = n + (n −1) + (n −2) + · · · + 1.
Adding these two expressions for A, namely
A =
1
+
2
+
3
+
· · ·
+
(n −2)

(n −1)
+
n
A =
n
+
(n −1)
+
(n −2)
+
· · ·
+
3
+
2
+
1
we obtain
2A = (n + 1) + (n + 1) + · · · + (n + 1).
Since there are n terms in this sum, each equal to n + 1, we have
2A = n(n + 1) and so A = n(n + 1)/2,
that is,
1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
.
(4.4)
Therefore, we have obtained and veriﬁed a formula for the sum of the ﬁrst n positive integers. The
story goes that when the brilliant mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was a student in elementary
school, the children in his class were given the tedious task of adding the ﬁrst 100 positive integers.
Supposedly, Gauss quickly noticed that 1 + 2 + · · · + 100 equals the 50 sums 1 + 100, 2 + 99, . . .,
50+51, each of which is 101 and so 1+2+· · ·+100 = 50(101) = 5050, thereby verifying the formula
(4.4) for n = 100.
We give an alternative proof of (4.4), this time using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
Result 4.2 For every positive integer n,
1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
.
Proof. We use induction. Since 1 = 1(1+1)
2
, the formula holds for n = 1. Assume that
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k = k(k + 1)
2
for a positive integer k. We show that
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)
2
.
Observe that
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1)
=
(1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k) + (k + 1)
=
k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1) = k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)
2
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it follows that
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
for every positive integer n.
Proof Analysis.
A remark about the proof of Result 4.2 may be useful. Within the proof, we
assumed that 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + k = k(k + 1)/2 for a positive integer k and we wanted to show that

120
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. In general, to show that two expressions are equal,
we often begin with one of these expressions and show that it is equal to the other expression. The
expression we begin with is ordinarily chosen to be the one that seems easier to simplify.
♦
A common attempted (but incorrect) proof of Result 4.2 might contain something like the fol-
lowing:
1 + 2 + · · · + (k + 1)
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
(4.5)
(1 + 2 + · · · + k) + (k + 1)
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
k(k + 1)
2
+ (k + 1)
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1)
2
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
=
(k + 1)(k + 2)
2
.
(4.6)
There are several diﬃculties with this so-called “proof.” Actually, it starts in (4.5) with what we
want to show. We can’t write this as we don’t know that these two quantities are equal. The
way this “proof” is written, there is one equality after another, each supposedly following from the
equality immediately preceding it. However, we started with two quantities that we didn’t know
were equal (even though we wrote that they were equal) and from this we eventually deduced the
equality in (4.6). However, the equality in (4.6) is totally obvious. No explanation is required. To
make a correct proof from this, however, what can be done is to start with the leftmost expression
in (4.5) and proceed down the expressions on the left of each equality to ﬁnally obtain the desired
result.
The formula presented in Result 4.2 occurs surprisingly often and sometimes in unexpected
places. We give one such example of this now.
Example 4.3
Suppose that we have 10 rolls of coins, numbered from 1 to 10. Each roll consists of 10 coins and
all 100 coins look identical, but they are not. In 9 of the 10 rolls, each coin in the roll weighs 10
grams but in the other roll of (counterfeit) coins, each coin weighs 11 grams. We have a scale on
which coins can be weighed. How can we determine which roll contains the counterfeit coins if we
are only allowed to use the scale and we are only permitted one weighing of coins?
Solution. Of course, if a roll of standard coins is weighed, then its weight will be 100 grams; while
if the roll of counterfeit coins is weighed, then it will weigh 110 grams and we will know that these
are the counterfeit coins. However, there is only one chance out of 10 that we will select the roll of
counterfeit coins to weigh. On the other hand, if we select one coin from roll #1, two coins from
roll #2 and so on, up to all 10 coins from roll #10 and weigh this collection of coins, then we are
weighing
1 + 2 + · · · + 10 = 10 · 11
2
= 55
coins (by the formula presented in Result 4.2). Not all of these coins weigh 10 grams, so the weight
of these 55 coins is more than 55 · 10 = 550 grams. If roll #k (1 ≤k ≤10) is the one containing the
counterfeit coins, then the weight of these 55 coins will be 550 + k grams. Therefore, the weight of
these 55 coins minus 550 is the number of the roll containing the counterfeit coins.
♦
What Result 4.2 gives us, of course, is a formula for the sum of the ﬁrst n positive integers. We
now consider the sum of the ﬁrst n odd positive integers. Observe that

4.1. THE PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
121
1
=
1
1 + 3
=
4
1 + 3 + 5
=
9
1 + 3 + 5 + 7
=
16.
Based on these examples, it would be reasonable to guess that the sum of the ﬁrst n odd positive
integers is n2. This would be a good guess.
Result 4.4 For every positive integer n,
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2n −1) = n2.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since 2 · 1 −1 = 12, the formula holds for n = 1. Assume that
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k −1) = k2
for a positive integer k. We show that 1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)2. Observe that
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k + 1)
=
[1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2k −1)] + (2k + 1)
=
k2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)2.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the formula holds for every positive integer n.
There are other formulas for sums of integers that are similar to those we have seen. The next
two formulas involve the sum of the squares and the sum of the cubes of the ﬁrst n positive integers.
The proofs too are similar to those we have seen and so are not presented here, but are left instead
as exercises (see Exercises 7 and 8).
Result 4.5 For every positive integer n,
12 + 22 + · · · + n2 = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)
6
.
Result 4.6 For every positive integer n,
13 + 23 + 33 + · · · + n3 = n2(n + 1)2
4
.
We now present and verify a formula for the sum of powers of 2.
Result 4.7 For every positive integer n,
1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2n = 2n+1 −1.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since 1 + 2 = 22 −1, the formula holds for n = 1. Assume that
1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k = 2k+1 −1
for a positive integer k. We show that 1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k+1 = 2k+2 −1. Observe that
1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k+1
=
(1 + 2 + 22 + · · · + 2k) + 2k+1
=
(2k+1 −1) + 2k+1 = 2 · 2k+1 −1
=
2k+2 −1,
as desired. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the formula holds for every positive inte-
ger n.

122
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
When giving a proof using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it is essential that we
establish both the base step and the inductive step, despite the fact that in the examples we have
seen, verifying the base step may seem quite trivial and may appear to add little to the proof. For
example, consider the expression 3n2−n+3, where n ∈N. Suppose that we believed that 3n2−n+3
is even for every positive integer n and that we attempt to give an induction proof of this, beginning
with the inductive step. First, we assume that 3k2 −k +3 is even for a positive integer k. Therefore,
3k2 −k + 3 = 2ℓ, where ℓ∈Z. We then show that 3(k + 1)2 −(k + 1) + 3 is even as well. Observe
that
3(k + 1)2 −(k + 1) + 3
=
3(k2 + 2k + 1) −k −1 + 3
=
3k2 + 6k + 3 −k + 2
=
(3k2 −k + 3) + 6k + 2 = 2ℓ+ 2(3k + 1)
=
2(ℓ+ 3k + 1).
Since ℓ+ 3k + 1 is an integer, 3(k + 1)2 −(k + 1) + 3 is even and the inductive step has been veriﬁed.
However, it is not true that 3n2−n+3 is even for every positive integer n. When n = 1, for example,
3n2 −n + 3 = 3 · 12 −1 + 3 = 5,
which, of course, is odd. In fact, 3n2 −n + 3 is never even. The reason that our “induction proof”
failed is that the base case was never established.

Additional Examples of Induction Proofs
In the preceding section, all of the results concerned establishing formulas for sums of numbers.
This is only a small sample of the kinds of statements that can be veriﬁed with the aid of the
Principle of Mathematical Induction. In this section we look at other types of examples. Before
doing this, however, we mention that there are several variations and generalizations of the Principle
of Mathematical Induction. We have seen that the Principle of Mathematical Induction can be used
to prove that statements of the form
∀n ∈N, P(n)
are true. There are numerous occasions when N is not the appropriate domain. Indeed, if the domain
of the variable n in an open sentence P(n) is the set
S = {i ∈Z : i ≥m} = {m, m + 1, m + 2, . . .}

124
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
for some ﬁxed integer m, then there is a more general principle that corresponds to this. Because
this principle is so similar in statement to the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it is ordinarily
referred to by the same name.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction For a ﬁxed integer m, let
S = {i ∈Z : i ≥m}.
Then the statement
∀n ∈S, P(n) : For every integer n ≥m, P(n).
is true if
(1) P(m) is true and
(2) the statement ∀k ∈S, P(k) ⇒P(k + 1) is true.
When m = 1, this principle is exactly the Principle of Mathematical Induction that we stated
in Section 4.1. To use the Principle of Mathematical Induction stated above, we need to show that
the hypothesis of this principle is satisﬁed. This means that we must show that the basis step (1)
and the inductive step (2) are satisﬁed.
For a positive integer n, the integer n! (n factorial) is deﬁned by
n! = n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1
and for every positive integer n,
(n + 1)! = (n + 1)n!.
(4.7)
One would certainly think that n! = n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1 is greater than 2 · 2 · 2 · · · 2 (n factors
2) if n is large enough, that is, n! > 2n. The table below compares the values of n! and 2n for several
positive integers n.

Observe that 2n > n! when 1 ≤n ≤3. However, n! > 2n for n = 4 and n = 5. There is good
reason therefore to believe that n! > 2n for every integer n ≥4. This is indeed the case, which we
prove by the Principle of Mathematical Induction (where m = 4 here).
Result to Prove: For every integer n ≥4, n! > 2n.
Proof Strategy. In order to give an induction proof of this result, we must ﬁrst show that n! > 2n
when n = 4. However, 4! = 24 and 24 = 16 while 24 > 16; so the desired inequality is obvious.
Next, we need to verify the inductive step. That is, we need to prove that if k! > 2k, where k is
some integer with k ≥4, then (k + 1)! > 2k+1. So we begin by assuming that k! > 2k. Typically,
to establish that some inequality holds, we start with one side and work towards the other. In this
case, this means that we would start with (k + 1)! and show that it is greater than 2k+1 (recall that
k ≥4) or start with 2k+1 and show that it is less than (k + 1)!. If we begin with (k + 1)! and use
(4.7), then we have (k + 1)! = (k + 1)k!. Furthermore, from our assumption, we know that k! > 2k.
Multiplying this inequality by (the positive integer) k + 1, we have
(k + 1)k! > (k + 1) · 2k.

4.2. ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES OF INDUCTION PROOFS
125
We need to recall that our goal is to show that (k + 1)! > 2k+1. By (4.7), (k + 1)! = (k + 1)k!. If
we can show that (k + 1) · 2k > 2k+1, then we will have what we want. Since k ≥4, it follows that
k + 1 ≥5. But 5 > 2 and so
(k + 1) · 2k ≥5 · 2k > 2 · 2k = 2k+1.
It only remains to put these pieces together and write a careful proof.
♦
Result 4.8
For every integer n ≥4, n! > 2n.
Proof. We use induction. Since 4! = 24 > 16 = 24, the inequality holds for n = 4. Suppose that
k! > 2k for an integer k ≥4. We show that (k + 1)! > 2k+1. Observe that
(k + 1)! = (k + 1)k! > (k + 1) · 2k ≥(4 + 1)2k = 5 · 2k > 2 · 2k = 2k+1.
Therefore, (k + 1)! > 2k+1. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, n! > 2n for every integer
n ≥4.
Next we compare values of 2n and n for some positive integers n. Consider the following table.
n
2n
1
2
2
4

8
After comparing n and 2n for only 1 ≤n ≤3 and observing that 2n > n for these values of n, it
seems as if 2n > n for every positive integer n. We attempt to prove this. If we use the Principle of
Mathematical Induction, then m would have the value 1, which means that this is also an application
of the Principle of Mathematical Induction as stated in Section 4.1.
Result 4.9
For every positive integer n, 2n > n.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since 21 > 1, the inequality holds for n = 1. Assume that 2k > k
for a positive integer k. We show that 2k+1 > k + 1. Observe that
2k+1 = 2 · 2k > 2k = k + k ≥k + 1.
Therefore, 2k+1 > k + 1. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, 2n > n for every positive
integer n.
We now consider some applications of the Principle of Mathematical Induction of an entirely
diﬀerent nature. There are often known properties of two objects of a certain type that hold for
more than two objects of this type. In such instances, a proof by induction is a common proof
technique. We now give two examples of this.
We previously mentioned the following fundamental property of real numbers:
If a and b are real numbers such that ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0.
(4.8)
This property also holds for products of more than two real numbers.
Result 4.10
If a1, a2, . . . , an are n ≥2 real numbers such that a1a2 · · · an = 0, then ai = 0 for
some integer i (1 ≤i ≤n).
Proof. We use induction.
By the well-known property of real numbers described in (4.8), the
statement is true for n = 2. That is, if a and b are two real numbers such that ab = 0, then a = 0
or b = 0. Assume that:
If a1, a2, . . . , ak are any k ≥2 real numbers whose product is 0, then ai = 0 for some
integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k.

126
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
We wish to show the statement is true in the case of k + 1 numbers, that is:
If b1, b2, . . . , bk+1 are k + 1 real numbers such that b1b2 · · · bk+1 = 0, then bi = 0 for some
integer i (1 ≤i ≤k + 1).
Let b1, b2, . . . , bk+1 be k + 1 real numbers such that b1b2 · · · bk+1 = 0. We show that bi = 0 for some
integer i (1 ≤i ≤k + 1). Let b = b1b2 · · · bk. Then
b1b2 · · · bk+1 = (b1b2 · · · bk)bk+1 = bbk+1 = 0.
Therefore, by (4.8) either b = 0 or bk+1 = 0. If bk+1 = 0, then we have the desired conclusion. On
the other hand, if b = b1b2 · · · bk = 0, then, since b is the product of k real numbers, it follows by the
inductive hypothesis that bi = 0 for some integer i (1 ≤i ≤k). In any case, bi = 0 for some integer
i (1 ≤i ≤k + 1). By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the result is true.
Proof Analysis.
A few comments about Result 4.10 and its proof are in order. First, in the
statement of Result 4.10 the symbols a1, a2, . . . , an are only used to help us state the result. In fact,
this result could have been stated as follows:
Whenever the product of n ≥2 real numbers is 0, at least one of these numbers is 0.
Consequently, when verifying the basis step (n = 2), the two numbers involved need not be called
a1 and a2. Indeed, it seemed more natural to denote these two numbers more simply by a and b.
In the inductive step, where we assumed that the statement is true for an integer k ≥2 and then
showed that the statement is true for the integer k + 1, it was not necessary and would probably
have been misleading to use a1, a2, . . . , ak and then a1, a2, . . . , ak+1, for this might have incorrectly
suggested that the k numbers must form a subset of the k + 1 numbers.
♦
One of De Morgan’s laws for sets states the following:
If A and B are any two sets, then A ∪B = A ∩B.
(4.9)
We now show that there is a more general property which is a consequence of (4.9).
Result 4.11 For any n ≥2 sets A1, A2, . . . , An,
A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪An = A1 ∩A2 ∩· · · ∩An.
Proof. We proceed by induction. By De Morgan’s law, if A and B are any two sets, then
A ∪B = A ∩B.
Hence the statement is true for n = 2. Assume, for any k sets A1, A2, . . . , Ak, where k ≥2, that
A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Ak = A1 ∩A2 ∩· · · ∩Ak.
Now let B1, B2, . . . , Bk+1 be any k + 1 sets. We show that
B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bk+1 = B1 ∩B2 ∩· · · ∩Bk+1.
Let B = B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bk. Observe that
B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bk+1
=
(B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bk) ∪Bk+1 = B ∪Bk+1
=
B ∩Bk+1 = (B1 ∪B2 ∪· · · ∪Bk) ∩Bk+1
=
 B1 ∩B2 ∩· · · ∩Bk

∩Bk+1
=
B1 ∩B2 ∩· · · ∩Bk+1.
The result then follows by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
We now use induction to verify a theorem (Theorem 2.17) that we encountered in Chapter 2,
Section 2.1.

4.2. ADDITIONAL EXAMPLES OF INDUCTION PROOFS
127
Theorem 4.12
Let n be a nonnegative integer. If A is a set with |A| = n, then the cardinality of
its power set is |P(A)| = 2n.
Proof.
We use induction. The power set of the empty set ∅is P(∅) = {∅}. Since
|P(∅)| = 1 = 20,
the statement is true for n = 0. Assume the following:
For a nonnegative integer k, the power set of every set with k elements has 2k elements.
Let A be a set with k + 1 elements, say
A = {a1, a2, . . . , ak+1}.
We show that |P(A)| = 2k+1. Now each subset of A either contains ak+1 or it doesn’t. We determine
the number of subsets of each type.
First, we determine the number of subsets of A not containing ak+1. Let
B = {a1, a2, . . ., ak}
be the subset of A obtained by removing ak+1 from A. The subsets of A not containing ak+1 are
precisely the subsets of B. Since |B| = k, it follows by the inductive hypothesis that there are 2k
such subsets.
Next, we determine the number of subsets of A that contain ak+1. Every subset of A containing
ak+1 can be expressed as C ∪{ak+1}, where C ⊆B. Thus, the number of subsets of A containing
ak+1 is the number of subsets C of B. Since there are 2k subsets of B, there are 2k sets C ∪{ak+1},
where C ⊆B.
Hence the total number of subsets of A is
2k + 2k = 2 · 2k = 2k+1.
The result then follows by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

Use induction to prove that for every integer n ≥3, the sum of the interior angles of every
n-gon is (n −2) · 180o.
4.3
Sequences
Many induction problems that occur in discrete mathematics involve the concept of sequences. You
may very well have seen sequences in calculus, which are encountered during the study of inﬁnite
series. For our purposes, a sequence is a listing of elements of some set. A sequence can be inﬁnite
or ﬁnite but we are more interested in inﬁnite sequences here. Typically, the elements of a sequence
belong to the set Z or R. An inﬁnite sequence is often denoted by a1, a2, a3, . . . or {an}. The element
a1 is then called the ﬁrst term of the sequence, a2 the second term and so on. The nth term of the
sequence is therefore an.
Example 4.13
Consider the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . or {an}, where
an = (−1)n
n
for n ∈N.
This sequence can also be expressed as
−1, 1
2, −1
3 , 1
4, . . ., or as
n
(−1)n
n
o
.
Thus −1 is the ﬁrst term of the sequence and 1
2 is the second term. The nth term is therefore (−1)n
n
. ♦
While the numbers −1, 1
2, −1
3 , 1
4 are certainly the ﬁrst four terms of the sequence
n
(−1)n
n
o
, this
is not the only sequence having these numbers as its ﬁrst four terms. We consider another example.
Example 4.14
Determine the ﬁrst three terms of the sequence {an}, where
an = n3 −6n2 + 12n −6 for n ∈N.
Solution. The ﬁrst three terms of this sequence are a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3.
♦
If we had asked for a sequence {an} whose ﬁrst three terms are 1, 2, 3, we almost certainly would
not have expected an = n3 −6n2 + 12n −6 as a response. The obvious answer would have been
an = n. Example 4.14 serves to illustrate that there is no single answer to such a question, but there
may be an obvious and expected answer. Notice that if an = n3 −6n2 + 12n −6, then a4 = 10.
Since
an = n3 −6n2 + 12n −6 = (n −1)(n −2)(n −3) + n,
it is not surprising that an = n for n = 1, 2, 3. Indeed, if we had deﬁned

4.3. SEQUENCES
129
an = (n −1)(n −2)(n −3)(n −4) + n
for n ∈N, then an = n for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, while a5 = 29.
We now consider a few common sequences.
Example 4.15
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . is a sequence whose nth term is n.
(b) 1, 4, 9, 16, . . . is a sequence whose nth term is n2.
(c) 1, 8, 27, 64, . . . is a sequence whose nth term is n3.
The sequences (a)-(c) are all polynomial sequences of the form {nk} for a ﬁxed positive integer k.
(d) 2, 4, 8, 16, . . . is a sequence whose nth term is 2n.
A geometric sequence is a sequence in which the ratio of every two consecutive terms an
and an+1 is some constant r, that is, an+1/an = r for each n ∈N. Hence the sequence in (e)
is geometric with r = 2.
(e) 4, 7, 10, 13, . . . is a sequence whose nth term is 3n + 1.
An arithmetic (pronounced ar-ith-MET-ic) sequence is a sequence in which the diﬀerence
of every two consecutive terms an and an+1 is some constant k, that is, an+1 −an = k for each
n ∈N. Hence the sequence in (f) is an arithmetic sequence with k = 3.
♦
Example 4.16
Consider the sequence a0, a1, a2, . . ., where
a0 = −1
3, a1 = 2
5, a2 = −4
7 and a3 = 8
9.
Determine the nth term of a sequence {an} whose ﬁrst four terms are those given above.
Solution. Because of the alternating sign, the expression for an contains either (−1)n or (−1)n+1.
A quick check tells us that (−1)n+1 is the correct choice. Since the numerators are 1, 2, 4, 8, · · ·, we
see that the numerator is 2n. Since the denominators are 3, 5, 7, 9, . . ., the terms are increasing by 2
and so an contains 2n + k in the denominator for some constant k. We see that k = 3 is the correct
choice and so
an = (−1)n+1
2n
2n + 3.
♦
Binary Strings
The sequences described above are all inﬁnite sequences as each such sequence contains an inﬁnite
number of terms. We now consider some ﬁnite sequences. A ﬁnite sequence is also referred to as a
string. The number of terms in a string is its length. Thus a string of length n can be expressed
as a1, a2, . . . , an or (a1, a2, . . . , an) or a1a2 . . . an, where ai belongs to some set S (1 ≤i ≤n).
A bit (or binary digit) is a 0 or 1. When each term of a string is a bit, S = {0, 1} and the
string is called a binary string or a bit string. An n-bit string is a string of length n where each
term is 0 or 1. Hence (0, 0, 1, 0, 1) is a 5-bit string. This string can also be expressed more simply
as 0, 0, 1, 0, 1 or as 00101.
The following is an application of bit strings.

130
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
Example 4.17
There are 24 = 16 subsets of a set S with 4 elements. These subsets can be represented as binary
strings of length 4. First, select an ordering of the elements of S such as S = {a1, a2, a3, a4}. Each
subset A of S can be represented as a 4-bit string whose ith term is 1 if ai ∈A and whose ith term is
0 if ai /∈A. For the subset A = {a2, a4}, for example, the ﬁrst term of the 4-bit string that represents
A is 0 because a1 /∈A. For this subset A of S, the 2nd term of the 4-bit string representing A is 1
because a2 ∈A. Continuing in this manner, we see that A = {a2, a4} can be represented by 0101.
Therefore, the set S itself is represented by 1111 and the empty set ∅is represented by 0000. The
table below gives the representations of all subsets of S.

Binary representations of the subsets of {a1, a2, a3, a4} in Example 4.17
All of the sequences that we have encountered thus far were explicitly deﬁned by a closed-form
expression. That is, the general term of the sequence can be determined simply by evaluating a
given expression for an appropriate integer. For example, the ﬁnite sequence a1, a2, . . . , a10 where
an = (n2 −1)3 + 3n for n = 1, 2, . . . , 10
and the inﬁnite sequence {bn} where
bn =
 n−10
3

for n ∈N
are explicitly deﬁned.
Recursively Deﬁned Sequences
Some sequences are deﬁned in an entirely diﬀerent way. A sequence is said to be recursively
deﬁned if one or more initial terms of the sequence are speciﬁed, while later terms in the sequence
are deﬁned according to the values of terms preceding them. More speciﬁcally, we have the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4.18
A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . of real numbers is said to be recursively deﬁned if:
(1) For some ﬁxed positive integer t, the terms a1, a2, . . . , at are given.
(2) For each integer n > t, an is deﬁned in terms of one or more of a1, a2, . . . , an−1.
Here, a1, a2, . . . , at are called the initial values of {an}; while the relation that deﬁnes an in terms
of a1, a2, . . . , an−1 for n > t is called the recurrence relation for {an}.
The ﬁrst term of a sequence {an} or {bn} need not have subscript 1. For example, a0, a1, a2, . . . is
an inﬁnite sequence as is b3, b4, b5, . . .. We now look at two examples of recursively deﬁned sequences.
Example 4.19
A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by

131
a1 = 1 and an =
n
n−1an−1 for n ≥2.
Determine a2, a3, a4 and a5.
Solution. By deﬁnition a1 = 1. By the recurrence relation,
a2 = 2
1a1 = 2 · 1 = 2, a3 = 3
2a2 = 3
2 · 2 = 3,
a4 = 4
3a3 = 4
3 · 3 = 4 and a5 = 5
4a4 = 5
4 · 4 = 5.
Based on these values, we might be led to believe that an = n for every positive integer n. This, in
fact, is true.
♦
Result 4.20 A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1 and an =

n−1an−1 for n ≥2.
Then an = n for every positive integer n.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since a1 = 1, the formula holds for n = 1. Assume that ak = k
for a positive integer k. We show that ak+1 = k + 1. Since k + 1 ≥2, it follows that
ak+1 = k + 1

ak = k + 1

By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, an = n for every n ∈N.
In the following example, there are two initial values.

a1 = 2, a2 = 3 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 for n ≥3.
Determine a1, a2, a3, a4 and a5.
Solution. First, the initial values a1 = 2 and a2 = 3 are given. By the recurrence relation,
a3 = 2a2 −a1 = 2 · 3 −2 = 4,
a4 = 2a3 −a2 = 2 · 4 −3 = 5 and
a5 = 2a4 −a3 = 2 · 5 −4 = 6.
Based on these values, we might be led to believe that an = n + 1 for every n ∈N. This will be
veriﬁed in the next section.
♦
Let’s look at some familiar sequences that can also be deﬁned recursively.
Example 4.22
For a ﬁxed positive real number a and a nonnegative integer n, the nth power of a is ordinarily
deﬁned by
an =

1
if n = 0
a · a · · · a (n factors a)
if n ∈N.
The deﬁnition of an, where n ∈{0} ∪N, can be expressed as a sequence p0, p1, p2, . . . deﬁned by
pn =

1
if n = 0
a · a · · · a (n factors a)
if n ∈N.

132
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
That is, pn = an. This deﬁnition, though common, may seem a bit awkward when n ∈N. The
number an can also be deﬁned recursively by
pn =

1
if n = 0
a · pn−1
if n ∈N.
Therefore, once an−1 has been deﬁned, an is then deﬁned as the product of a and an−1 when n ≥1.
In particular, p0 = 1, p1 = a · p0 = a · 1 = a, p2 = a · p1 = a · a = a2 and p3 = a · p2 = a · a2 = a3. ♦
Example 4.23
For a positive integer n, we have deﬁned n! (n factorial) by
n! = n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1.
Thus 1! = 1, 2! = 2 · 1 = 2, 3! = 3 · 2 · 1 = 6 and 4! = 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 24. For n = 0, n! is deﬁned as
n! = 0! = 1. Therefore, for a nonnegative integer n, the number n factorial n! is deﬁned by
n! =

1
if n = 0
n(n −1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1
if n ∈N.
The deﬁnition of n!, where n ∈{0} ∪N, can also be expressed as a sequence f0, f1, f2, . . . deﬁned by
fn =

1
if n = 0
n(n −1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1
if n ∈N.
Although this is the most common way to deﬁne n!, here too the deﬁnition of n! when n ∈N may
seem somewhat awkward. There is also a way to deﬁne n! recursively. For a nonnegative integer n,
fn =

1
if n = 0
nfn−1
if n ∈N.
In this case, fn = n!, where n! = n · (n −1)! when n ∈N. Thus f0 = 1, f1 = 1 · f0 = 1 · 1 = 1,
f2 = 2 · f1 = 2 · 1 = 2 and f3 = 3 · f2 = 3 · 2 = 6.
♦
Fibonacci Numbers
The best known and most studied recursively deﬁned sequence is one that results from certain
positive integers called the Fibonacci numbers.
Example 4.24
The Fibonacci sequence F1, F2, F3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
Fn =

1
if n = 1, 2
Fn−2 + Fn−1
if n ≥3.
The numbers F1, F2, F3, . . . are referred to as Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1
are the initial values here and since the recurrence relation is Fn = Fn−2 +Fn−1 for n ≥3, it follows
that
F3
=
F1 + F2 = 1 + 1 = 2
F4
=
F2 + F3 = 1 + 2 = 3
F5
=
F3 + F4 = 2 + 3 = 5.
Consequently, the ﬁrst few Fibonacci numbers are
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89.
♦
Fibonacci numbers occur often and sometimes unexpectedly.

4.3. SEQUENCES
133
Example 4.25
For a positive integer n, let sn be the number of n-bit strings having no two consecutive 0s.
(a) Determine s1, s2 and s3.
(b) Give a recursive deﬁnition of sn for n ≥1.
(c) Use (b) to determine si for 1 ≤i ≤6.
Solution.
(a) Certainly, the two 1-bit strings 0 and 1 do not have two consecutive 0s and so s1 = 2. The
2-bit string 00 is the only one of the four 2-bit strings with two consecutive 0s. Thus s2 = 3.
The eight 3-bit strings are
000
001
010
011
100
101
110
111.
Since 5 of these do not have two consecutive 0s, it follows that s3 = 5.
(b) We have noted in (a) that s1 = 2 and s2 = 3. For n ≥3, an n-bit string with no two consecutive
0s either (1) has 1 as the last bit and so the ﬁrst n −1 bits give an (n −1)-bit string having
no two consecutive 0s or (2) has 10 as the last two bits and so the ﬁrst n −2 bits give an
(n −2)-bit string having no two consecutive 0s. Consequently, for n ≥3, sn = sn−1 + sn−2
and so the recursive deﬁnition of sn for n ≥1 is:
s1 = 2, s2 = 3 and sn = sn−1 + sn−2 for n ≥3.
(c) This gives us s1 = 2, s2 = 3, s3 = s2 + s1 = 3 + 2 = 5, s4 = s3 + s2 = 5 + 3 = 8,
s5 = s4 + s3 = 8 + 5 = 13, s6 = s5 + s4 = 13 + 8 = 21, all of which, of course, are Fibonacci
numbers.
♦
There are several relationships involving products of Fibonacci numbers. We present one of these
next. Another is given in Exercise 23.
Example 4.26
For every integer n ≥2,
Fn−1Fn+1 = F 2
n + (−1)n.
Proof. We proceed by induction. When n = 2, we have
F1F3 = 1 · 2 = 12 + 1 = F 2
2 + (−1)2.
Thus the formula holds for n = 2. Assume for an arbitrary integer k ≥2 that
Fk−1Fk+1 = F 2
k + (−1)k.
Thus
F 2
k = Fk−1Fk+1 −(−1)k.
(4.10)
We show that
FkFk+2 = F 2
k+1 + (−1)k+1.
Using (4.10) and the recursion relation for the Fibonacci numbers, we obtain
FkFk+2
=
Fk(Fk + Fk+1) = F 2
k + FkFk+1
=
[Fk−1Fk+1 −(−1)k] + FkFk+1
=
Fk−1Fk+1 + FkFk+1 + (−1)k+1
=
(Fk−1 + Fk)Fk+1 + (−1)k+1
=
Fk+1Fk+1 + (−1)k+1 = F 2
k+1 + (−1)k+1.

134
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
Thus, FkFk+2 = F 2
k+1 + (−1)k+1. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
Fn−1Fn+1 = F 2
n + (−1)n
for every integer n ≥2.
The origin of Fibonacci numbers is rather curious. One of the great European mathematicians
of the middle ages was Leonardo da Pisa, born in 1175 in Pisa, Italy, known for its famous Leaning
Tower. Leonardo called himself Fibonacci. The name Fibonacci is a shortening of “ﬁlius Bonacci”,
which means “son of Bonaccio”. His father’s name was Guglielmo Bonaccio. (Bonacci is the plural
of Bonaccio.) Fibonacci traveled a great deal in his early years about the Mediterranean coast and
returned to Pisa in 1200. With the knowledge he had acquired during his travels, he wrote the book
Liber Abaci, in which he introduced the decimal number system to the Latin-speaking world. In
Chapter 12 of his book, he stated the following problem:
How Many Pairs of Rabbits Are Created by One Pair in One Year?
A certain man had one pair of rabbits together in a certain enclosed place and one wishes
to know how many are created from the pair in one year when it is the nature of them
in a single month to bear a single pair and in the second month those born to bear also.
Solution. First, it may be necessary to clarify some aspects of Fibonacci’s Rabbit Problem. It is
assumed that at the beginning of the year (the beginning of Month #1), there is a pair of rabbits
(one male and one female). At the beginning of Month #2, the two rabbits have developed into
adult rabbits and can bear other rabbits. At the beginning of Month #3, another pair of rabbits
(one male and one female) are born. Therefore, at the beginning of Month #3, there are two pairs
of rabbits (one adult pair and one juvenile pair). At the beginning of Month #4, the adult rabbits
bear another pair of rabbits (a new juvenile pair) and the previous juvenile pair becomes an adult
pair. Thus, at the beginning of Month #4, there are two adult pairs of rabbits and one juvenile
pair, or three pairs in all.
Assuming that the rabbits do not die during the year, the number rn of pairs of rabbits at the
beginning of Month #n (3 ≤n ≤13) is the number rn−1 of pairs of rabbits there are at the beginning
of Month #(n −1) plus the number of pairs of rabbits born at the beginning of Month #n. The
number of pairs of rabbits born at that time equals the number of pairs of adult rabbits there are
at the beginning of Month #(n −1). This is the number rn−2 of pairs of rabbits at the beginning
of Month #(n −2). Therefore,
rn = rn−2 + rn−1.
This information is given in the table below.

The numbers r1, r2, . . . , r13 are therefore 1, 1, 2, . . ., 233, which are Fibonacci numbers and so the
number of rabbits at the end of the year is 233 pairs.
♦
Although Fibonacci is understood to be neither the originator of this problem nor the numbers
that bear his name, he was the one to make these numbers known. It was the French mathematician
Edouard Lucas who gave the name Fibonacci numbers to this sequence of numbers. Indeed, there
is a closely related sequence of numbers named after Lucas – the Lucas numbers:
2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, . . ..
Fibonacci died in the 1240s. There is a statue honoring him at the Leaning Tower of Pisa.
If a sequence is deﬁned recursively, then both an initial value (or values) must be speciﬁed and
a recurrence relation must be deﬁned. If either of these two is changed, then a diﬀerent sequence is
produced. We illustrate this remark with the Fibonacci numbers.

4.3. SEQUENCES
135
Example 4.27
A sequence L1, L2, L3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
L1 = 2, L2 = 1 and Ln = Ln−2 + Ln−1 for n ≥3.
Determine L3, L4 and L5.
Solution. This recursively deﬁned sequence has the same recurrence relation as the Fibonacci
numbers but the ﬁrst initial value is diﬀerent. By the recurrence relation,
L3
=
L1 + L2 = 2 + 1 = 3
L4
=
L2 + L3 = 1 + 3 = 4
L5
=
L3 + L4 = 3 + 4 = 7.
The numbers L1, L2, L3, . . . are in fact the Lucas numbers we referred to earlier.
♦
We have previously mentioned in Chapter 2 (Theorem 2.17 in Section 2.1) that the number
of subsets of an n-element set is 2n. The number of subsets of an n-element set can be deﬁned
recursively.
Example 4.28
For a nonnegative integer n, let sn be the number of subsets of an n-element set.
(a) What are s0, s1 and s2?
(b) Give a recursive deﬁnition of sn for n ≥0.
Solution.
(a) Since the only 0-element set is ∅and the only subset of ∅is ∅, it follows that s0 = 1. The
subsets of a 1-element set {a} are ∅and {a}, so s1 = 2. Also, the subsets of a 2-element set
{x, y} are ∅, {x}, {y} and {x, y} and so s2 = 4. Therefore, s0 = 1, s1 = 2 and s2 = 4.
(b) First, s0 = 1. Suppose that sn−1 (n −1 ≥0) is the number of subsets of an (n −1)-element
set. Let A be an n-element set, say A = {a1, a2, . . . , an}. Every subset of A either contains an
or it does not. A subset of A that does not contain an is a subset of B = {a1, a2, . . ., an−1}.
There are sn−1 subsets of B. A subset of A that contains an can be expressed as C ∪{an},
where C ⊆B. Since there are sn−1 choices for C, there are sn−1 subsets of A containing an.
Hence there are sn−1 + sn−1 = 2sn−1 subsets of A. Therefore, s0 = 1 and sn = 2sn−1 for
n ≥1.
♦
In all of the examples of recurrence relations that we have seen, we computed the ﬁrst few terms
of the sequence being considered. In many instances, it would probably be useful if there were
an explicit formula for the nth term of the sequence. The question of ﬁnding such a formula and
verifying the correctness of the formula is important and will be discussed further in Chapter 9.

The Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction
We have already mentioned that there are several variations of the Principle of Mathematical Induc-
tion. Perhaps the best known and most useful of these is called the Strong Principle of Mathematical
Induction. This principle is also known by several other names, including the Strong Form of Math-
ematical Induction, the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction and the Alternate Form of
Mathematical Induction.

138
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
The Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction The statement
∀n ∈N, P(n) : For every positive integer n, P(n).
is true if
(1) P(1) is true and
(2) the statement ∀k ∈N, P(1) ∧P(2) ∧· · · ∧P(k) ⇒P(k + 1) is true.
The Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction then states that all of the statements P(1),
P(2), P(3), . . . are true if it can be shown that (1) P(1) is true and (2) the statement
Let k ∈N. If P(i) for each i ∈N with 1 ≤i ≤k, then P(k + 1).
is true. As before, (1) is called the base or basis step of this induction and (2) is the inductive
step. If a direct proof is used to verify the inductive step, we then assume for an arbitrary positive
integer k that P(i) is a true statement for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k (which is called the
induction or inductive hypothesis) and show that P(k + 1) is a true statement. Assuming that
P(i) is a true statement for 1 ≤i ≤k means then that we are assuming the following k statements are
true: P(1), P(2), . . . , P(k). The diﬀerence between using the Principle of Mathematical Induction
and using the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that ∀n ∈N, P(n) is true lies
in their respective inductive steps. When using a direct proof to prove the inductive step in the
Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction, we are permitted to assume that all of the statements
P(1), P(2), . . ., P(k) are true (rather than only assuming that P(k) is true, as in the Principle
of Mathematical Induction). In each situation, we need to show that P(k + 1) is true. That is,
when attempting to show that P(k + 1) is true in the inductive step in the Strong Principle of
Mathematical Induction, we are allowed to assume more (which may be just what is needed).
We asked earlier whether the nth term of a recursively deﬁned sequence may also be expressed in
a closed form (that is, by a formula). When there is a proposed formula, the anticipated formula can
often be veriﬁed either by the Principle of Mathematical Induction (examples of which are shown
in Section 4.3) or perhaps by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. We ﬁrst consider
another example where the Principle of Mathematical Induction is used.
Result 4.29
If {an} is a sequence deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 3 and an = 2an−1 + 1 for n ≥2,
then an = 2n+1 −1 for every positive integer n.
Proof. We use the Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since a1 = 21+1 −1 = 3, the formula holds
for n = 1. Assume that ak = 2k+1 −1 for a positive integer k. We show that
ak+1 = 2(k+1)+1 −1 = 2k+2 −1.
Observe that
ak+1 = 2ak + 1 = 2(2k+1 −1) + 1 = 2k+2 −1.
It then follows by the Principle of Mathematical Induction that an = 2n+1 −1 for every positive
integer n.
In the previous result, there was only one initial value. In Example 4.21 (in Section 4.3), we
encountered a recursively deﬁned sequence in which there are two initial values. We now visit this
example again.
Result 4.30 A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 2, a2 = 3 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 for n ≥3.

4.4. THE STRONG PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
139
Then an = n + 1 for every positive integer n.
Proof. We proceed by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since a1 = 2 = 1 + 1, the
formula holds for n = 1. Assume, for a positive integer k, that ai = i + 1 for every integer i with
1 ≤i ≤k. We show that ak+1 = k+2. First, observe that when k = 1, ak+1 = a1+1 = a2 = 3 = 1+2
and so the formula holds. Hence we may assume that k ≥2. Since k + 1 ≥3, it follows by the
recurrence relation that
ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 = 2(k + 1) −[(k −1) + 1] = 2k −2 −k = k + 2.
It therefore follows by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction that an = n + 1 for each
positive integer n.
Proof Analysis.
In the proof of Result 4.30, we wanted to show that ak+1 = k + 2. In the proof
we used the fact that we know that an = 2an−1 −an−2. However, we only know this when n ≥3.
So we could only write that ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 when k + 1 ≥3, that is when k ≥2. The situation
when k = 1 had to be handled separately.
We now consider two additional examples where the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction
is an appropriate technique.
Example 4.31
A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1, a2 = 4 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 + 2 for n ≥3.
(a) Determine a3, a4 and a5.
(b) Conjecture a formula for an for each positive integer n.
Solution.
(a)
By the recurrence relation,
a3
=
2a2 −a1 + 2 = 2 · 4 −1 + 2 = 9
a4
=
2a3 −a2 + 2 = 2 · 9 −4 + 2 = 16
a5
=
2a4 −a3 + 2 = 2 · 16 −9 + 2 = 25.
(b) Based on the initial values a1 and a2 and the values a3, a4 and a5 determined in (a), a
reasonable conjecture would be that an = n2 for each positive integer n.
♦
We now show that the conjecture made in Example 4.31 is, in fact, correct.
Result to Prove: A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1, a2 = 4 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 + 2 for n ≥3.
Then an = n2 for each positive integer n.
Proof Strategy. We attempt to prove this result by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induc-
tion. Because a1 = 1 = 12, the formula holds for n = 1. This is the basis step. We now verify
the inductive step. Thus we assume that ai = i2 for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k, where k is an
arbitrary positive integer and then show that ak+1 = (k + 1)2.
From the way in which the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned, we can write ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 + 2
provided that k + 1 ≥3, that is, provided that k ≥2. However, it is possible that k = 1. If k = 1,
then k + 1 = 2 and ak+1 = a2 = 4 = 22. Thus ak+1 = (k + 1)2 when k = 1. On the other hand,
if k ≥2, then k + 1 ≥3 and, as we just mentioned, ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 + 2. From the inductive

140
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
hypothesis, ai = i2 for each integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k (where now k ≥2). In particular, ak = k2 and
ak−1 = (k −1)2. Thus
ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 + 2 = 2k2 −(k −1)2 + 2 = (k + 1)2.
This is what we wanted to show.
♦
We are now prepared to give a more concise proof of this result.
Result 4.32 A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1, a2 = 4 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 + 2 for n ≥3.
Then an = n2 for each positive integer n.
Proof. We employ the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since a1 = 1 = 12, the formula
holds for n = 1. Assume that ai = i2 for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k, where k is an arbitrary
positive integer. We show that ak+1 = (k + 1)2. When k = 1, we have ak+1 = a2 = 4 = 22 and so
ak+1 = (k + 1)2 for k = 1. Hence we may assume that k ≥2 and so k + 1 ≥3. Observe that
ak+1
=
2ak −ak−1 + 2 = 2k2 −(k −1)2 + 2
=
2k2 −(k2 −2k + 1) + 2 = k2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)2.
Therefore, ak+1 = (k + 1)2 for every positive integer k. By the Strong Principle of Mathematical
Induction, an = n2 for each positive integer n.
Proof Analysis. Let’s take another look at the proof we just gave of Result 4.32. In the conclusion
of the inductive step, we were required to show that ak+1 = (k + 1)2 where k ≥1. Recall that we
ﬁrst veriﬁed that ak+1 = (k + 1)2 when k = 1. As in the proofs just preceding this, the reason for
this was because we could only write ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 + 2 when k + 1 ≥3 (from the recurrence
relation on the deﬁnition of the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . .). We then showed that ak+1 = (k +1)2 where
k ≥2. We could have actually divided the proof into two cases at that time (namely, Case 1 : k = 1
and Case 2 : k ≥2) but because the case k = 1 could be handled so quickly, we decided not to give
a proof by cases.
Another logical question that could be asked about the proof of Result 4.31 is why the Strong
Principle of Mathematical Induction was used rather than the standard Principle of Mathematical
Induction. This is actually quite easy to answer. Suppose that we had attempted to give a proof
of Result 4.32 using the Principle of Mathematical Induction. In that case, we would need to verify
the inductive step by assuming that ak = k2 for a positive integer k and show that ak+1 = (k + 1)2.
Notice that we don’t know that ak−1 = (k −1)2. For k ≥2, however, ak+1 = 2ak −ak−1 + 2.
Although we can write ak = k2, we have no simpliﬁed expression for ak−1 and we are unable to give
a proof.
♦
In Example 4.31, we were asked to conjecture (guess) a formula for an. Although in this case,
it doesn’t appear too diﬃcult to make the right guess, it is still possible that we may have guessed
incorrectly or that we can’t come up with a good guess. In Section 9.5 we will visit a topic that will
allow us to determine a formula (or closed form) for an in many instances when the sequence {an}
is deﬁned recursively.
Result 4.33 A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1, a2 = 3 and an = 3an−1 −2an−2 −2 for n ≥3.
Then an = 2n −1 for every positive integer n.
Proof. We use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since a1 = 1 = 2·1−1, the formula
holds for n = 1. Assume that ai = 2i −1 for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k, where k is an arbitrary
positive integer. We show that

4.4. THE STRONG PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
141
ak+1 = 2(k + 1) −1 = 2k + 1.
When k = 1, we have ak+1 = a2 = 2 · 1 + 1 = 3 and so ak+1 = 2k + 1 when k = 1. When k ≥2, we
have k + 1 ≥3 and so
ak+1
=
3ak −2ak−1 −2 = 3(2k −1) −2(2k −3) −2
=
6k −3 −4k + 6 −2 = 2k + 1.
Thus, ak+1 = 2k+1 for every positive integer k. By the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction,
an = 2n −1 for every positive integer n.
We now consider a recursively deﬁned sequence in which there are three initial values.
Result 4.34 A sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is deﬁned recursively by
a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 4 and an = an−1 + an−2 + 2an−3 for n ≥4.
Then an = 2n−1 for each positive integer n.
Proof. We use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since a1 = 1 = 21−1, the formula
holds for n = 1. Assume that ai = 2i−1 for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k, where k is a positive
integer. We show that ak+1 = 2(k+1)−1 = 2k. When k = 1 and k = 2, we have ak+1 = a2 = 21 = 2
and ak+1 = a3 = 22 = 4, respectively. Therefore, ak+1 = 2k when k = 1 and k = 2. When k ≥3,
ak+1
=
ak + ak−1 + 2ak−2 = 2k−1 + 2k−2 + 2 · 2k−3
=
2k−1 + 2k−2 + 2k−2 = 2k−1 + 2 · 2k−2
=
2k−1 + 2k−1 = 2 · 2k−1 = 2k.
Therefore, ak+1 = 2k for every positive integer k. It then follows by the Strong Principle of Mathe-
matical Induction that an = 2n−1 for each positive integer n.
There is also a more general form of the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Again,
because of the minor diﬀerences in their statements, we refer to this as well as the Strong Principle
of Mathematical Induction.
The Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction For a ﬁxed integer m, let
S = {i ∈Z : i ≥m}.
Then the statement
∀n ∈S, P(n) : For every integer n ≥m, P(n).
is true if
(1) P(m) is true and
(2) the statement ∀k ∈S, P(m) ∧P(m + 1) ∧· · · ∧P(k) ⇒P(k + 1) is true.
We return to the Fibonacci numbers again to establish a relationship that can be veriﬁed with
the aid of the the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction (with m = 2).
Result 4.35
For every integer n ≥2, Fn ≤2Fn−1.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since F2 = 1 ≤2 · 1 = 2F1, the inequality holds for n = 2.
Assume, for an arbitrary integer k ≥2, that Fi ≤2Fi−1 for every integer i with 2 ≤i ≤k. We show
that Fk+1 ≤2Fk. When k = 2, we have F3 = 2 ≤2 · 1 = 2F2. Thus Fk+1 ≤2Fk when k = 2. Hence
we may assume that k ≥3. In this case,
Fk+1 = Fk−1 + Fk ≤2Fk−2 + 2Fk−1 = 2(Fk−2 + Fk−1) = 2Fk

142
CHAPTER 4. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
and so Fk+1 ≤2Fk.
Thus, by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction, Fn ≤2Fn−1 for every integer n ≥2.
With the assistance of Result 4.35, an upper bound for Fibonacci numbers can be established
using the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
Corollary 4.36
For every positive integer n, Fn ≤2n.
Proof. We proceed by induction. Since F1 = 1 ≤21, the inequality holds for n = 1. Assume that
Fk ≤2k for an arbitrary positive integer k. We show that Fk+1 ≤2k+1. By Result 4.35,
Fk+1 ≤2Fk ≤2 · 2k = 2k+1.
Thus Fk+1 ≤2k+1. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, Fn ≤2n for every positive inte-
ger n.

“Proof.”
We use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction.
Since 2 · 0 = 0, the
statement is true for n = 0. Assume, for an arbitrary nonnegative integer k, that 2i = 0 for
every integer i with 0 ≤i ≤k. We show that 2(k + 1) = 0. Let i and j be integers such that
0 ≤i ≤k and 0 ≤j ≤k and i + j = k + 1. By the induction hypothesis, 2i = 0 and 2j = 0.
Thus 2(k + 1) = 2(i + j) = 2i + 2j = 0 + 0 = 0.
By the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction, 2n = 0 for every nonnegative integer n.

Chapter 5
Relations and Functions
There will be a number of instances when we will be dealing with two sets A and B (possibly A = B)
where typically some of the elements of A have a connection with some of the elements of B in some
manner. Depending on the requirements of such a connection, we obtain two concepts encountered
often in mathematics: relations and functions.
5.1
Relations
In mathematics an object in one set can be related to an object in another set in variety of ways.
For example, an integer a can be related to an integer b if a + b is even or if a and b have the same
remainder when divided by 3. A straight line ℓcan be related to the real number m if m is the slope
of ℓ. Recall that the Cartesian product A × B of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs
(a, b), where a ∈A and b ∈B. That is,
A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈A, b ∈B}.
For example, if A = {0, 1} and B = {1, 2, 3}, then
A × B = {(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)}.
This brings us to the concept of a relation in mathematics.
Deﬁnition 5.1
A relation R from a set A to a set B is a subset of A × B. In addition, R is
said to be a relation on A × B. If (a, b) ∈R, then a is said to be related to b; while if (a, b) /∈R,
then a is not related to b. If (a, b) ∈R, we also write a R b; while if (a, b) /∈R, we write a ̸R b.
Let’s look at a few examples of relations.
Example 5.2 Let A = {
√
2, e, 3, π} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4}. An element a ∈A is said to be related to
an element b ∈B if |a −b| < 1. Which elements of A are related to which elements of B?
Solution. First, recall that
√
2 ≈1.414, e ≈2.718 and π ≈3.14. Denote this relation by R. That
is, for a ∈A and b ∈B, it follows that a R b if |a −b| < 1. In this case,
√
2 R 1,
√
2 R 2, e R 2, e R 3, 3 R 3, π R 3 and π R 4.
Observe that if a and b are both integers, then a R b can only occur if a = b. The elements of A
related to the elements of B can also be described by writing
R = {(
√
2, 1), (
√
2, 2), (e, 2), (e, 3), (3, 3), (π, 3), (π, 4)}. ♦

CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Example 5.3
For the sets A = {0, 1} and B = {1, 2, 3}, suppose that
R = {(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2)}
is a relation from A to B. Therefore, 0 R 2, 0 R 3 and 1 R 2. Since 0 is not related to 1 and 1 is
not related to 3, we can also indicate this by writing 0 ̸R 1 and 1 ̸R 3.
♦
Example 5.4
Let N be the set of natural numbers (positive integers) and let N−denote the set of negative integers.
A relation R from N to N−is deﬁned by a R b if a + b ∈N. Give examples of some pairs of elements
that are related by R and some that are not.
Solution. First, 5 R (−2) since 5 + (−2) = 3 ∈N. Also, 5 R (−4) since 5 + (−4) = 1 ∈N. On
the other hand, because 2 + (−2) = 0 /∈N and 3 + (−5) = −2 /∈N, it follows that 2 ̸ R (−2) and
3 ̸R (−5).
♦
If A and B are ﬁnite sets and R is a relation from A to B, then R can be represented by a
diagram.
Example 5.5
For the sets A = {x, y, z} and B = {0, 1, 2, 3},
R = {(x, 1), (x, 2), (y, 1), (z, 0), (z, 3)}
is a relation from A to B. The relation R can also be described by the diagram in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1: Representation of the relation in Example 5.5
One type of a relation that we will encounter often is deﬁned from some set to the same set.
Deﬁnition 5.6
A relation R on a set S is a relation from S to S. That is, R is a relation on a
set S if R is a subset of S × S.
We have seen that if a set A has n elements, then there are 2n subsets of A. Thus if a set S has
three elements, for example, then S × S has 9 elements and there are 29 = 512 diﬀerent subsets of
S × S and so there are 512 possible relations on S.
Example 5.7
Listed below are ﬁve (of the 512 possible) relations on the set S = {x, y, z}.
R1 = {(x, y), (x, z), (z, z)}
R2 = {(x, x), (x, y), (y, z)}

5.1. RELATIONS

R3 = {(x, x), (y, y), (z, z)}
R4 = ∅(the empty relation)
R5 = S × S = {(x, x), (x, y), (x, z), (y, x), (y, y), (y, z), (z, x), (z, y), (z, z)}.
♦
There are several properties that a relation deﬁned on a set can have that will be of particular
interest to us. We now consider three of the best known properties.
Deﬁnition 5.8
Let R be a relation deﬁned on a nonempty set S. Then R is
(1) reﬂexive if a R a for all a ∈S; that is, if a ∈S, then (a, a) ∈R;
(2) symmetric if whenever a R b, then b R a for all a, b ∈S; that is, if (a, b) ∈R, then (b, a) ∈R;
(3) transitive if whenever a R b and b R c, then a R c for all a, b, c ∈S; that is, if (a, b) ∈R
and (b, c) ∈R, then (a, c) ∈R.
In the deﬁnition of a transitive relation, it is not necessary that a, b and c be distinct.
In
particular, if c = a, then the deﬁnition says if (a, b) ∈R and (b, a) ∈R, then (a, a) must be in R.
Furthermore, if R is a transitive relation and (a, b) ∈R and (b, a) ∈R, then (b, a) ∈R and (a, b) ∈R
and so the ordered pair (b, b) must be in R as well.
A relation R deﬁned on a set S is therefore
(1′) not reﬂexive if (x, x) /∈R for some x ∈S;
(2′) not symmetric if (x, y) ∈R but (y, x) /∈R for some pair x, y of distinct elements of S;
(3′) not transitive if (x, y) ∈R and (y, z) ∈R but (x, z) /∈R for some x, y, z ∈S.
Before we see some examples of relations that have some, none or all of the properties (1)–(3),
there is one additional fact that is useful for us to recall. For a false statement P and any statement
Q, the implication P ⇒Q is true. Consequently, if we have the empty relation R deﬁned on a
nonempty set S, then R is symmetric since for all a, b ∈S the statement “(a, b) ∈R” is false. Thus,
the implication “if (a, b) ∈R, then (b, a) ∈R” is true for all a, b ∈S. By the same reasoning, if R is
the empty relation on S, then R is transitive. Indeed, if for all a, b, c ∈S the statement “(a, b) ∈R
and (b, c) ∈R” is false, then R is transitive as the implication “if (a, b) ∈R and (b, c) ∈R, then
(a, c) ∈R” is true for all a, b, c ∈S. However, the empty relation on a nonempty set S is not reﬂexive
since (a, a) /∈R for all a ∈S.
Example 5.9
Of the ﬁve relations in Example 5.7 only R3 and R5 are reﬂexive. All of the relations R3, R4 and R5
are symmetric. The relation R1 is not symmetric since, for example, (x, y) ∈R1 but (y, x) /∈R1. All
of the relations R1, R3, R4 and R5 are transitive. Since (x, y) ∈R2 and (y, z) ∈R2 but (x, z) /∈R2,
the relation R2 is not transitive. Let’s see why the relation R1 is transitive. In order for R1 to be
transitive, the statement
If (a, b) ∈R1 and (b, c) ∈R1, then (a, c) ∈R1.
(5.1)
must be true for all a, b, c ∈S. We consider all choices of a, b, c ∈S for which (a, b) ∈R1 and
(b, c) ∈R1. There are three ordered pairs (a, b) ∈R1, namely, (x, y), (x, z) and (z, z). Suppose ﬁrst
that we consider (a, b) = (x, y). Then b = y. However then, there is no ordered pair (b, c) ∈R1. If
(a, b) = (x, z), then b = z. The only ordered pair (b, c) ∈R1 where b = z is (b, c) = (z, z) ∈R1. That
is, (x, z) ∈R1 and (z, z) ∈R1 (so a = x and b = c = z). Since (a, c) = (x, z) ∈R1, the implication
in (5.1) is true when (a, b) = (x, z) and (b, c) = (z, z). The only other ordered pair (a, b) ∈R1 is
(a, b) = (z, z). In this case, the only ordered pair (b, c) ∈R1 is (b, c) = (z, z); so a = b = c = z. But

150
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
then (a, c) = (z, z) ∈R1, so (5.1) is true when (a, b) = (z, z) and (b, c) = (z, z). Consequently, the
implication in (5.1) is true for all a, b, c ∈S and so R1 is transitive.
♦
We now consider a number of other relations deﬁned on a set and determine which of the
properties reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive they may possess.
Example 5.10
Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. The relation
R = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (4, 1)}
is deﬁned on the set S. Which of the properties reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive does R possess?
Solution. The relation R is not reﬂexive since (4, 4) /∈R. The relation R is not symmetric since
(3, 1) ∈R but (1, 3) /∈R. Furthermore, the relation R is not transitive since, for example, (1, 2) ∈R
and (2, 3) ∈R but (1, 3) /∈R. Also, (4, 1) ∈R and (1, 4) ∈R but (4, 4) /∈R.
♦
Example 5.11
A relation R is deﬁned on the set N of positive integers by a R b if a < b. Which of the properties
reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive does R possess?
Solution. Since a < a is not true for any positive integer a, it follows that a ̸ R a for every a ∈N
and the relation R is not reﬂexive. Suppose that a and b are positive integers such that a R b.
Then a < b. Certainly, b < a is not true; so b ̸ R a and R is not symmetric. On the other hand, if
a, b, c ∈N such that a R b and b R c, then a < b and b < c. Thus a < c and so a R c. Therefore, R
is transitive.
♦
Example 5.12
A relation R is deﬁned on the set Z of integers by a R b if ab ≥0. Which of the properties reﬂexive,
symmetric and transitive does R possess?
Solution. Let a ∈Z. Since a · a = a2 ≥0, it follows that a R a for all a ∈Z and so R is reﬂexive.
Suppose that a, b ∈Z such that a R b. Then ab ≥0. Since ba = ab, it follows that ba ≥0 and so
b R a. Therefore, R is symmetric.
Since 2 · 0 ≥0 and 0 · (−3) ≥0, it follows that 2 R 0 and 0 R (−3). However 2 ̸ R (−3) since
2 · (−3) = −6 < 0. Therefore, R is not transitive.
♦
Next, we look at an example of a relation having a geometric ﬂavor.
Example 5.13
A relation R is deﬁned on the set R of real numbers by x R y if 2x + y ≥0. (That is, x R y if (x, y)
is a point in the Euclidean plane that lies on or to the right of the line y = −2x. See Figure 5.2.)
(a) Give an example of two real numbers a and b such that a R b and two real numbers c and d
such that c ̸R d.
(b) Is R reﬂexive?
(c) Is R symmetric?
(d) Is R transitive?

Figure 5.2: The line y = −2x in the Euclidean plane
Solution.
(a) Since 2 · 3 + 1 = 7 ≥0, it follows that 3 R 1. Also, since 2 · (−3) + (−1) = −7 < 0, it follows
that (−3) ̸R (−1).
(b) Since 2(−1) + (−1) = −3 < 0, it follows that (−1) ̸R (−1) and so R is not reﬂexive.
(c) Since 2·3+(−6) = 0, it follows that 3 R (−6). However, 2(−6)+3 = −9 < 0 and so (−6) ̸R 3.
Therefore, R is not symmetric.
(d) Since 2(−1) + 2 ≥0, it follows that (−1) R 2. Also, since 2 · 2 + (−4) ≥0, it follows that
2 R (−4). However, (−1) ̸ R (−4) because 2(−1) + (−4) = −6 < 0. Therefore, R is not
transitive.

5.2
Equivalence Relations
Probably the best known relation on the set of integers is the equals relation, that is, the relation
R deﬁned on Z by a R b if a = b. Certainly (1) a = a for every a ∈Z, (2) if a = b, then b = a for all
a, b ∈Z and (3) if a = b and b = c, then a = c for all a, b, c ∈Z. In other words, the equals relation
is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive. Many of the relations that we encounter in mathematics and
computer science mimic the equals relation in that they are also reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive.
Relations possessing all three of these properties are called equivalence relations.
Deﬁnition 5.14
A relation R on a nonempty set is an equivalence relation if R is reﬂexive,
symmetric and transitive.
Consequently, the equals relation deﬁned on the set of integers (or on any nonempty subset of real
numbers) is an equivalence relation. We now consider some other examples of equivalence relations.

5.2. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS
153
Example 5.15
A relation R is deﬁned on the set L of straight lines in the Euclidean plane by ℓ1 R ℓ2 if two lines
ℓ1 and ℓ2 coincide or are parallel. (See Figure 5.4.) Explain why R is an equivalence relation.

Figure 5.4: The equivalence relation R in Example 5.15
Solution. Certainly every line coincides with itself. Thus ℓR ℓfor every line ℓand R is therefore
reﬂexive. Suppose that ℓ1 R ℓ2 for lines ℓ1 and ℓ2. Then ℓ1 and ℓ2 coincide or ℓ1 and ℓ2 are parallel.
Hence ℓ2 and ℓ1 coincide or ℓ2 and ℓ1 are parallel. Thus ℓ2 R ℓ1 and R is symmetric.
If ℓ1 R ℓ2 and ℓ2 R ℓ3 for lines ℓ1, ℓ2 and ℓ3, then (1) ℓ1 and ℓ2 coincide or ℓ1 and ℓ2 are parallel
and (2) ℓ2 and ℓ3 coincide or ℓ2 and ℓ3 are parallel. Thus ℓ1 and ℓ3 coincide or ℓ1 and ℓ3 are parallel.
Hence ℓ1 R ℓ3 and R is transitive. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation on L.
♦
Example 5.16
A relation R is deﬁned on N × N by (a, b) R (c, d) if ad = bc. Show that R is an
equivalence relation.
Proof. Let (a, b) ∈N × N. Since ab = ba, it follows that (a, b) R (a, b) and so R is reﬂexive. Let
(a, b), (c, d) ∈N × N such that (a, b) R (c, d). Then ad = bc. Thus cb = da, which implies that
(c, d) R (a, b) and so R is symmetric.
Let (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N × N such that (a, b) R (c, d) and (c, d) R (e, f). Hence ad = bc and
cf = de. We show that (a, b) R (e, f). Since ad = bc and cf = de, it follows that a = bc/d and
f = de/c. Hence
af =
bc
d
 de
c

= bcde
dc
= be,
which implies that (a, b) R (e, f) and so R is transitive. Therefore, R is an equivalence relation. ♦
Proof Analysis. The transitive property in Example 5.16 could also be veriﬁed by observing that
adf = (ad)f = (bc)f = b(cf) = b(de) = bde.
Thus adf = bde. Dividing by d, we obtain af = be.
♦
If we think of the ordered pair (a, b) in Example 5.16 as representing the positive rational number
a
b , then two fractions a
b and c
d are related if ad = bc, that is, if a
b = c
d. Hence a
b and c
d are related if
and only if these numbers are equal. Not surprisingly then, this relation is an equivalence relation.
Equivalence Classes
If R is an equivalence relation that is deﬁned on a set A, then with each element of A, there is
an associated subset of A that will be of special interest to us.
Deﬁnition 5.17
Let R be an equivalence relation on a set A. For a ∈A, the equivalence class
[a] is deﬁned by
[a] = {x ∈A : x R a}.

154
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Hence, for an equivalence relation R on a set A and an element a ∈A, the equivalence class [a] is
the set of all elements of A that are related to a by R. So we can think of [a] as the set consisting of
all of the relatives of a. Since every equivalence relation is reﬂexive, a R a and so a ∈[a]. Therefore,
[a] ̸= ∅for every element a ∈A. Let’s look at some examples of equivalence classes.
Example 5.18
Let S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The relation
R
=
{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6), (1, 4),
(2, 3), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3)}
on S is an equivalence relation. Therefore, with each element of S, there is an associated equivalence
class. Since (1, 1), (4, 1) ∈R but (2, 1), (3, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1) /∈R, it follows that [1] = {1, 4}. In this
case, the equivalence classes are
[1] = {1, 4}, [2] = {2, 3, 6}, [3] = {2, 3, 6},
[4] = {1, 4}, [5] = {5} and [6] = {2, 3, 6}.
Notice here that [1] = [4] and [2] = [3] = [6].
♦
Example 5.19
In Example 5.15, a relation R is deﬁned on the set L of straight lines in the Euclidean plane by
ℓ1 R ℓ2 if ℓ1 and ℓ2 coincide or ℓ1 and ℓ2 are parallel, which was shown to be an equivalence relation.
For a straight line ℓ, the equivalence class [ℓ] consists of ℓand all straight lines parallel to ℓ. For
example, if ℓis the straight line with equation y = 2x + 1, then [ℓ] consists of all lines with slope 2;
while if ℓ′ is the straight line with equation x = 3, then [ℓ′] consists of all vertical lines.
♦
Example 5.20
In Example 5.16, a relation R is deﬁned on the Cartesian product N × N such that (a, b) R (c, d)
if ad = bc. Since R is an equivalence relation, there is an equivalence class associated with each
element of N × N. For example,
[(1, 2)]
=
{(x, y) ∈N × N : (x, y) R (1, 2)}
=
{(x, y) ∈N × N : 2x = y}
=
{(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), . . .}.
For positive integers a, b, c and d, we have noted that
ad = bc if and only if a
b = c
d.
Again, if we think of the ordered pair (a, b) as representing the positive rational number a
b , then the
equivalence class [(a, b)] is the set of all ordered pairs (c, d) such that a
b = c
d.
♦
Result to Prove: A relation R is deﬁned on Z by a R b if a + b is even. Then R is an equivalence
relation.
Proof Strategy.
For the reﬂexive property, we are required to show that if a ∈Z, then a R a.
Since a R a if a + a is even, we need to show that if a ∈Z, then a + a = 2a is even. This is obvious.
For the symmetric property, we must show that if a R b, where a, b ∈Z, then b R a. Suppose that
a R b. Then a + b is even. However, b + a = a + b. Thus b + a is even and so b R a.
For the transitive property, we are required to show that if a R b and b R c, where a, b, c ∈Z,
then a R c. Now a R c if a + c is even. If we use a direct proof, then we begin by assuming that
a R b and b R c, with the goal to show that a + c is even. Because a R b and b R c, it follows
that both a + b and b + c are even. One way to work a + c into the discussion is to add a + b and
b + c. Since a + b and b + c are even, a + b = 2x and b + c = 2y for some integers x and y. Adding
these, we get (a + b) + (b + c) = 2x + 2y and so a + c = 2x + 2y −2b. The remainder of the proof is
straightforward.
♦

5.2. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS
155
Example 5.21 A relation R is deﬁned on Z by a R b if a + b is even.
(a) Show that R is an equivalence relation.
(b) Describe the equivalence classes [0], [1], [−3] and [4].
Solution.
(a) Proof. Let a ∈Z. Then a + a = 2a is an even integer and so a R a. Thus R is reﬂexive.
Assume next that a R b, where a, b ∈Z. Then a + b is even. Since b + a = a + b, it follows
that b + a is even. Therefore, b R a and R is symmetric.
Finally, assume that a R b and b R c, where a, b, c ∈Z. Hence a + b and b + c are both even
and so a + b = 2x and b + c = 2y for some integers x and y. Adding these two equations, we
obtain
(a + b) + (b + c) = 2x + 2y,
which implies that
a + c = 2x + 2y −2b = 2(x + y −b).
Since x + y −b is an integer, a + c is even. Therefore, a R c and R is transitive.
(b) The equivalence classes are
[0]
=
{x ∈Z : x R 0} = {x ∈Z : x + 0 is even}
=
{x ∈Z : x is even} = {. . . , −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}
[1]
=
{x ∈Z : x R 1} = {x ∈Z : x + 1 is even}
=
{x ∈Z : x is odd} = {. . . , −5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . .}
[−3]
=
{x ∈Z : x R (−3)} = {x ∈Z : x −3 is even}
=
{x ∈Z : x is odd} = {. . . , −5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . .}
[4]
=
{x ∈Z : x R 4} = {x ∈Z : x + 4 is even}
=
{x ∈Z : x is even} = {. . . , −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}.
Consequently, in this case [0] = [4] and [1] = [−3].
♦
If the equivalence classes determined in the preceding examples are examined, then it might be
observed that in each example every two equivalence classes are either equal or disjoint. It turns
out that this is true in general. In order to establish this fact, we begin by presenting a necessary
and suﬃcient condition for two equivalence classes to be equal.
Before we verify the next theorem, however, let’s recall that two sets C and D can be shown to
be equal if we can establish that both C ⊆D and D ⊆C. Recall also that to verify that C ⊆D,
for example, we can select an arbitrary element x ∈C and show that x ∈D as well.
Theorem 5.22
Let R be an equivalence relation on a nonempty set A and let a and b be elements
of A. Then
[a] = [b] if and only if a R b.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that a R b. We verify that [a] = [b]. To establish that the sets [a] and [b] are
equal, we show that [a] ⊆[b] and [b] ⊆[a], beginning with the ﬁrst of these. Let x ∈[a]. Then
x R a. Since a R b, it follows by the transitive property that x R b. Thus x ∈[b] and so [a] ⊆[b].
Next, we show that [b] ⊆[a]. Let y ∈[b]. Then y R b. Since a R b and R is symmetric, it follows
that b R a. Because y R b and b R a, it follows by the transitive property that y R a. Therefore
y ∈[a] and so [b] ⊆[a]. Therefore, [a] = [b].
To establish the converse, we begin by assuming that [a] = [b]. We show that a R b. Since
[a] = [b] and a ∈[a], it follows that a ∈[b]. Hence a R b.

CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Recall that a partition P of a nonempty set A is a collection of nonempty subsets of A such
that every element of A belongs to exactly one of these subsets.
We now show that the set of
distinct equivalence classes of a nonempty set resulting from an equivalence relation on the set
always produces a partition of the set.
Theorem 5.23
Let R be an equivalence relation deﬁned on a nonempty set A. If P is the set of
all distinct equivalence classes of A resulting from R, then P is a partition of A.
Proof. We already observed that each equivalence class is nonempty and every element of A belongs
to at least one equivalence class. It remains only to show that every element of A belongs to exactly
one equivalence class in P. Assume, to the contrary, that x belongs to two distinct equivalence
classes in P, say [a] and [b]. Since x ∈[a] and x ∈[b], it follows that x R a and x R b. Because R is
symmetric, a R x. Thus a R x and x R b. Since R is transitive, a R b. By Theorem 5.22, it follows
that [a] = [b], which is a contradiction. Thus, as claimed, P is a partition of A.
As a consequence of Theorem 5.23, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 5.24
Let R be an equivalence relation deﬁned on a nonempty set A. If [a] and [b] are
equivalence classes of A resulting from R, then either [a] = [b] or [a] ∩[b] = ∅.
From what we saw in Theorem 5.22, we can expand on Corollary 5.24 a bit more. In particular,
if a R b, then [a] = [b]; while if a ̸R b, then [a] ∩[b] = ∅. Also, if [a] ∩[b] ̸= ∅, then [a] = [b].
We now consider two additional examples of equivalence relations and the equivalence classes
resulting from them.
Result to Prove: A relation R is deﬁned on Z by a R b if 3a−7b is even. Then R is an equivalence
relation.
Proof Strategy.
The ﬁrst step is to show that R is reﬂexive. In order to do this, we must show
that every integer is related to itself. So let x ∈Z. According to the deﬁnition of R, x R x if 3x−7x
is even. However, 3x −7x = −4x = 2(−2x) is even.
To show that R is symmetric, we need to show that whenever x R y, we also have y R x. Assume
that x R y. Then 3x −7y is even. We need to show that 3y −7x is even. Since 3x −7y is even,
3x−7y = 2k for some integer k. There are several ways to proceed. One way is to begin with 3y−7x
and write this as 3y −3x −4x. Since 3x = 7y + 2k, we can make this substitution in 3y −3x −4x.
Simplifying the algebra gives us the desired result.
To show that R is transitive, we are required to show that if x R y and y R z, then x R z.
Assume that x R y and y R z. So 3x −7y and 3y −7z are even. Our goal is to show that 3x −7z
is even. Since 3x −7y and 3y −7z are even, 3x −7y = 2k and 3y −7z = 2ℓfor some integers k and
ℓ. Notice that if we add these two equations, the expression 3x −7z appears in the sum.
♦
Example 5.25
A relation R is deﬁned on Z by a R b if 3a −7b is even.
(a) Prove that R is an equivalence relation.
(b) Describe the distinct equivalence classes resulting from R and show that the set of all distinct
equivalence classes produces a partition of Z.
Solution.
(a) Proof. Let x ∈Z. Since 3x −7x = −4x = 2(−2x) and −2x is an integer, 3x −7x is even.
Thus x R x and R is reﬂexive.
Next, we show that R is symmetric. Let x R y, where x, y ∈Z. Thus 3x −7y is even and
so 3x −7y = 2k for some integer k. Therefore, 3x = 7y + 2k. Observe that
3y −7x
=
3y −3x −4x = 3y −(7y + 2k) −4x
=
−4y −2k −4x = 2(−2y −k −2x).

5.2. EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS
157
Since −2y −k −2x is an integer, 3y −7x is even. So y R x and R is symmetric.
Finally, we show that R is transitive. Assume that x R y and y R z, where x, y, z ∈Z. Then
3x −7y and 3y −7z are even. So 3x −7y = 2k and 3y −7z = 2ℓ, where k, ℓ∈Z. Adding these
two equations, we obtain
(3x −7y) + (3y −7z) = 3x −4y −7z = 2k + 2ℓ
and so
3x −7z = 2k + 2ℓ+ 4y = 2(k + ℓ+ 2y).
Since k + ℓ+ 2y is an integer, 3x −7z is even. Therefore, x R z and R is transitive.
(b) We begin with the element 0 of Z. The equivalence class [0] is
[0]
=
{x ∈Z : x R 0} = {x ∈Z : 3x is even}
=
{x ∈Z : x is even} = {. . . , −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, . . .}.
Thus, [0] is the set of all even integers. To ﬁnd another equivalence class, we consider an
integer not in [0], say 1. Then
[1]
=
{x ∈Z : x R 1} = {x ∈Z : 3x −7 · 1 is even}
=
{x ∈Z : 3x is odd} = {x ∈Z : x is odd}
=
{. . . , −5, −3, −1, 1, 3, 5, . . .}.
Observe that {[0], [1]} is a partition of Z, which implies that these are the only two distinct
equivalence classes in this case.

5.3. FUNCTIONS

5.3
Functions
In a relation from a set A to a set B, an element of A may be related to all, some or no elements of
B. The situation when each element of A is related to exactly one element of B is of great interest
and importance. These types of relations have a familiar name and will be discussed in this section.
Deﬁnition 5.26
Let A and B be two nonempty sets. A function f from A to B is a relation
from A to B that associates with each element of A a unique element of B. A function f from A to
B is denoted by f : A →B.
A function f : A →B can therefore also be described as a subset of A × B such that for every
element a of A there is exactly one ordered pair in f in which a is the ﬁrst coordinate. Hence if g
is a subset of A × B in which either
(i) some element a′ of A is not the ﬁrst coordinate of any ordered pair in g or
(ii) some element a′′ of A is the ﬁrst coordinate of more than one ordered pair in g,
then g is not a function from A to B.
Example 5.27
For the two sets A = {a1, a2, a3, a4} and B = {b1, b2, b3}, let f be the function from A to B that
assigns
• to a1 the element b2,
• to a2 the element b3,
• to a3 the element b3,
• to a4 the element b2.
Therefore, f consists of the ordered pairs (a1, b2), (a2, b3), (a3, b3) and (a4, b2), that is,
f = {(a1, b2), (a2, b3), (a3, b3), (a4, b2)}.
♦
There is some common terminology and notation related to functions that we should be aware
of. Suppose that f : A →B. If b ∈B is the unique element assigned to a ∈A by f, then we write
b = f(a) and say that “b is f of a” and that b is the image of a (under f). For the function f in
Example 5.27, f(a1) = b2 and so b2 is the image of a1.
Deﬁnition 5.28
If f : A →B is a function from a set A to a set B, then A is called the domain
of f and B is the codomain of f. The range f(A) is the set of images of the elements of A,
namely,
f(A) = {f(a) : a ∈A}.
For the function f in Example 5.27, the domain of f is therefore A = {a1, a2, a3, a4} and the
codomain of f is B = {b1, b2, b3}. The range of f is f(A) = {b2, b3}.
More generally, we have the following concept.
Deﬁnition 5.29
For a function f from a set A to a set B and a subset X of A, the image of X
under f is the set
f(X) = {f(x) : x ∈X}.
For every subset X of A, f(X) ⊆B.
If X = A, then f(X) = f(A) is the range of f.
If
X = {a2, a3} in Example 5.27, then f(X) = {b3}; while if Y = {a3, a4}, then f(Y ) = {b2, b3}.
Representations of Functions
It is often convenient to visualize a function by means of a diagram. Suppose that f is a function
from A to B. Then Figure 5.5 provides a pictorial representation of such a function. If f(a) = b,
then this is represented by drawing an arrow from the element a ∈A to its image b ∈B.

For the sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {a, b, c, d, e}, the diagram in Figure 5.6 describes a function
f : A →B. The domain of f is A, the codomain of f is B and the range of f is f(A) = {a, b, d}.
The function f can also be expressed as
f = {(1, b), (2, a), (3, b), (4, d)}
and also by writing
f(1) = b, f(2) = a, f(3) = b, f(4) = d.
Observe that neither c nor e is the image of any element of A. Also, if A′ = {1, 2, 3}, then f(A′) =
{a, b}.

Figure 5.6: The function f : A →B in Example 5.30
For the sets A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {a, b, c, d, e} above, if
g = {(1, c), (2, e), (3, a)} and h = {(1, a), (2, b), (3, c), (3, e), (4, b)},
then neither g nor h is a function from A to B. The reason that g is not a function from A to B is
because the element 4 in A has no image in B; while h is not a function from A to B because the
element 3 in A has more than one image in B, namely, c and e are both images of 3. On the other
hand, if we were to let A′ = {1, 2, 3}, then g is a function from the set A′ to B.
♦
Example 5.31
For each real number x, let f(x) denote any real number y such that (x, y) lies on the circle x2+y2 =
25. Is f a function from the set R of real numbers to R?
Solution. No, f fails to be a function from R to R for two reasons. First, consider x = 6. There
is no real number y such that x2 + y2 = 36 + y2 = 25. This says that f is not deﬁned for x = 6;
that is, f associates no real number with 6 and so there is no number f(6). Next, consider x = 3.
There are two real numbers y for which x2 + y2 = 9 + y2 = 25, namely y = 4 and y = −4. That
is, f(3) = 4 and f(3) = −4 both satisfy the requirement. Therefore, f associates two distinct real

5.3. FUNCTIONS
161
numbers with 3. In fact, only for x = 5 and x = −5 is there a unique real number y (namely y = 0)
such that x2 + y2 = 25.
♦
In general, for two nonempty sets A and B, there are many functions from A to B. Two functions
f : A →B and g : A →B are said to be equal if f(a) = g(a) for every element a ∈A.
Example 5.32
Let A = {a, b} and B = {0, 1}. Determine all functions from A to B.
Solution. The functions from A to B are
f1 = {(a, 0), (b, 0)},
f2 = {(a, 0), (b, 1)},
f3 = {(a, 1), (b, 0)},
f4 = {(a, 1), (b, 1)}.
Therefore, there are four such functions.
♦
In Chapter 8 we will describe how to determine the number of diﬀerent functions from one ﬁnite
set to another ﬁnite set.
For two nonempty sets A and B of real numbers and a function f : A →B, the graph of f is
the set of points (x, y) in the Cartesian plane for which x ∈A, y ∈B and y = f(x).
Example 5.33
For each real number x, let f(x) be the real number x2 −4x + 1. Then f can be considered as a
function both of whose domain and codomain is the set R of real numbers that associates with each
real number x the unique real number f(x) = x2 −4x + 1. This is a function that you might very
well have encountered in calculus or precalculus. In fact, the graph of this function is a parabola,
which is shown in Figure 5.7. For each point (x, y) on this graph, y = f(x). In particular, (4, 1) is
a point on the graph because 1 = f(4) = 42 −4 · 4 + 1. The range of f is {y ∈R : y ≥−3}.

Figure 5.7: The graph of the function y = f(x) = x2 −4x + 1 in Example 5.33
Analysis. We noted that the range of f is {y ∈R :
y ≥−3}. From the graph of y = f(x) =
x2 −4x + 1 in Figure 5.7, it certainly appears that this is the range (the set of images or y-values).
However, since this relies on the accuracy of the graph and our interpretation of the graph, it is
not clear if our answer for the range is correct. Even a graphing calculator cannot help us to give
a precise answer here. If we were to look at this function in another way, however, we can see that
our answer for the range is accurate. Observe, by completing the square, that we can write
f(x) = x2 −4x + 1 = (x2 −4x + 4) −3 = (x −2)2 −3.
Since (x −2)2 ≥0, it follows that (x −2)2 −3 ≥0 −3 = −3 and so f(x) ≥−3. (See Exercise 14.) ♦
Although the functions that one considers in calculus, such as that in Example 5.33, appear to
be given by some sort of formula, this is not necessary. In fact, as we have seen, if f : A →B, then
A and B need not even be sets of numbers. This is illustrated again in the next example.

CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Example 5.34
Let A = {a, b, c, d} and B = {u, v, w, x, y, z}. If f assigns to both a and c the element w, assigns to b
the element v, and assigns to d the element y, then f is a function from A to B for which f(a) = w,
f(b) = v, f(c) = w and f(d) = y. Therefore, the function f can be also expressed as a set of four
ordered pairs, namely
f = {(a, w), (b, v), (c, w), (d, y)}.
This function can also be described by the diagram in Figure 5.8(a) and the graph in Figure 5.8(b),
which in this case is a set of four points. Furthermore, the domain of f is A, the codomain of f is
B and the range of f is f(A) = {v, w, y}.

Common Functions
The examples we’ve seen so far show that functions can be deﬁned or described in a variety of
ways. We now consider some of the most common types of functions.
Example 5.35
For a nonempty set A, the function f : A →A deﬁned by f(a) = a for every a ∈A is called the
identity function on A. That is, the identity function on A assigns to each element of A that same
element. For A = {1, 2, 3}, for example, the identity function on A is f = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}. The
graphs of both this function and the identity function on the set R of real numbers are shown in
Figures 5.9(a) and 5.9(b), respectively.

Example 5.36

f(x) = |x| =

is the absolute value function, which assigns to each real number x its absolute value |x|. Ac-
cording to the deﬁnition then, the absolute value function assigns to each nonnegative real number
the number itself; while it assigns to each negative real number the negative of that number. So
the image of every real number under the absolute value function is a nonnegative real number. For

♦
There are occasions when we are interested in integers that are near some given real number,
namely those obtained by rounding up or rounding down the real number to the nearest integer. For
a real number r, the ceiling ⌈r⌉of r is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to r; while
the ﬂoor ⌊r⌋of r is the greatest integer less than or equal to r. Therefore, ⌈6.4⌉= 7 and ⌊6.4⌋= 6.
Also, ⌈4⌉= ⌊4⌋= 4, ⌈−2⌉= ⌊−2⌋= −2, ⌈−3.5⌉= −3 and ⌊−3.5⌋= −4. Both the ceiling and the
ﬂoor produce a function.
Example 5.37
The function f : R →Z deﬁned by f(x) = ⌈x⌉is the ceiling function and the function g : R →Z

Example 5.38
If 100 CD ROMs are to be given to the 15 students in a computer science class so that the distribution
among the students is as equal as possible, then each student must receive either ⌈100/15⌉= 7 CD
ROMs or ⌊100/15⌋= 6 CD ROMs. (In fact, 10 students must receive 7 CD ROMs with the other 5
students receiving 6 CD ROMs.)

Two other common types of functions that are encountered in discrete mathematics are exponen-
tial and logarithmic functions. Let a ∈R+ such that a ̸= 1, where, recall, R+ is the set of positive
real numbers. If b ∈R and ab = c, then this equality can also be expressed by writing loga c = b.
That is,
loga c = b if and only if ab = c.
Necessarily, c ∈R+. In each case, a is called the base. In calculus, the most common number to
use as a base is the number e (an irrational number whose approximate value is 2.718), while 2 is a
common base in computer science. Therefore,
y = loge x if and only if x = ey,
where loge x is often written as ln x. Also,
y = log2 x if and only if x = 2y.
Example 5.39
(a) The function f : R →R+ deﬁned by f(x) = 2x is an exponential function. For example,
f(−3) = 2−3 =
1
23 = 1
8, f(0) = 20 = 1 and f(2) = 22 = 4.
(b) The function g : R+ →R deﬁned by g(x) = log2 x is a logarithmic function. For example,
g

  1

Composition of Functions
Just as there are many ways of combining two numbers to produce a new number, many ways
of combining two statements to produce a new statement and many ways of combining two sets to
produce a new set, there are also many ways of combining two functions to produce a new function.
We consider one of the best known ways of doing this – provided the domains and the codomains
of the two given functions satisfy certain conditions.
Deﬁnition 5.41
Let A, B and C be sets and suppose that f : A →B and g : B →C are two
functions. The composition g ◦f of f and g is the function from A to C deﬁned by
(g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)) for a ∈A.
(5.2)
Therefore, in the deﬁnition above of the composition g ◦f of two functions f and g, the domain
of g is the codomain of f. The domain then of the composition g ◦f is the domain of f, while the
codomain of g ◦f is the codomain of g. To determine the image of an element a ∈A by the function
g ◦f, the deﬁnition in (5.2) tells us to ﬁrst determine the image f(a) ∈B of a under f and then
determine the image g(f(a)) ∈C of f(a) under g. This is the element (g ◦f)(a). Notice that in the
composition g ◦f we ﬁrst deal with f and then with g. A diagram illustrating the composition of
two such functions f and g is shown in Figure 5.13.

Figure 5.13: The composition g ◦f of functions f and g
We now consider two examples of composition of functions.
Example 5.42
Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {a, b, c, d} and C = {x, y, z} and let f : A →B and g : B →C be functions,
where
f = {(1, c), (2, b), (3, a)} and g = {(a, y), (b, x), (c, x), (d, z)}.
Then
(g ◦f)(1) = g(f(1)) = g(c) = x.

166
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Similarly, (g ◦f)(2) = x and (g ◦f)(3) = y. Therefore,
g ◦f = {(1, x), (2, x), (3, y)}.
♦
Strictly speaking, when dealing with the composition g ◦f of two functions f and g, it is not
necessary that the domain of g be the same as the codomain of f. All that is required is that the
range of f be a subset of the domain of g. Thus, for the functions f and g in Example 5.42, we
could let
A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {a, b, c, d}, B′ = {a, b, c}, and C = {x, y, z},
and let f : A →B and g : B′ →C be functions, where
f = {(1, c), (2, b), (3, a)} and g = {(a, y), (b, x), (c, x)}.
Then
g ◦f = {(1, x), (2, x), (3, y)},
as we obtained in Example 5.42.
The Chain Rule from diﬀerential calculus also involves composition of functions. This concerns
determining the derivative (g◦f)′ of the composition g◦f of two functions f and g whenever we know
the derivatives f ′ and g′ of f and g, respectively. Although we are not concerned with derivatives
here, let us consider an example of composition that might have occurred in calculus.
Example 5.43
Let f : R →R and g : R →R, where f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x2. Determine (f ◦g)(x) and (g ◦f)(x)
for x ∈R.
Solution. First notice that because the domain and codomain are the same set (namely the set R
of real numbers), both f ◦g and g ◦f are deﬁned in this case. For x ∈R,
(f ◦g)(x)
=
f(g(x)) = f(x2) = sin(x2) and
(g ◦f)(x)
=
g(f(x)) = g(sin x) = (sin x)2 = sin2 x. ♦
Example 5.43 illustrates the fact that even when f ◦g and g ◦f are both deﬁned, they need not
be equal.
Example 5.44
Let X = {s1, s2, . . . , s7} denote a set of 7 students taking an advanced computer science class, let
Y = {A, B, C, D, F} be the set of possible grades that a student in the class could earn and let
Z = {0, 1, 2, . . ., 7}. The function f : X →Y assigns to each student the grade the student earns in
the class and g : Y →Z assigns to each grade the number of students receiving this grade. Suppose
that
f
=
{(s1, B), (s2, B), (s3, C), (s4, A), (s5, C), (s6, B), (s7, A)}
g
=
{(A, 2), (B, 3), (C, 2), (D, 0), (F, 0)}.
The composition g ◦f : X →Z is therefore deﬁned. For example,
(g ◦f)(s1) = g(f(s1)) = g(B) = 3,
which means that s1 is one of three students who received the same grade, namely B, in the computer
science class. In general,
g ◦f = {(s1, 3), (s2, 3), (s3, 2), (s4, 2), (s5, 2), (s6, 3), (s7, 2)}.

CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
5.4
Bijective Functions
There are functions from a set A to a set B that often have one or both of the following properties:
(1) each element of B is the image of at most one element of A;
(2) each element of B is the image of at least one element of A.
These properties are encountered so often that familiarity with them is needed. We begin with
functions that satisfy property (1).
One-to-one Functions
Deﬁnition 5.45
For two nonempty sets A and B, a function f : A →B is said to be one-to-one
if every two distinct elements of A have distinct images in B, that is, if a, b ∈A and a ̸= b, then
f(a) ̸= f(b).
A one-to-one function is also referred to as an injective function or an injection. We consider
two functions, only one of which is one-to-one.
Example 5.46
Let A = {a, b, c} and B = {w, x, y, z}. Consider the functions f : A →B and g : A →B deﬁned by
f = {(a, x), (b, z), (c, w)} and g = {(a, w), (b, y), (c, w)}.
These functions are also described by the diagrams in Figure 5.16. For the function f, distinct
elements of A have distinct images in B. Therefore, f is one-to-one. On the other hand, g(a) =
g(c) = w and so a and c do not have distinct images in B. Therefore, g is not one-to-one.

Figure 5.16: A one-to-one function and a function that is not one-to-one
Example 5.47
Let A be a nonempty set and let f : A →A be the function deﬁned by f(a) = a for every element
a ∈A. Thus f is the identify function on A. This function f is one-to-one for if x and y are any
two distinct elements of A, then their images f(x) = x and f(y) = y are also distinct.
♦
For two nonempty ﬁnite sets A and B, suppose that f : A →B is a one-to-one function. Then
diﬀerent elements of A must have diﬀerent images in B. Therefore, if A has n elements, then the
elements of A have n images in B.
Consequently, the set B must contain at least n elements.
Therefore, we have the following.
If f : A →B is one-to-one, then we must have |B| ≥|A|.
(5.3)
The contrapositive of the implication in (5.3) can therefore be stated as follows.

If |B| < |A|, then there is no one-to-one function from A to B.
In other words, if the codomain of a function has fewer elements than its domain, then the function
is not one-to-one. In particular, if A is a ﬁnite nonempty set and B is a nonempty proper subset of
A, then there is no one-to-one function f : A →B. Perhaps surprisingly, for an inﬁnite set A it is
possible to have one-to-one functions from A to a proper subset of A.
Example 5.48
Let A be the set of integers (that is, A = Z) and let B be the set of even integers. Therefore, B is
an inﬁnite proper subset of A. The function f : A →B deﬁned by f(n) = 2n for every integer n is
one-to-one for if a, b ∈Z and a ̸= b, then f(a) = 2a ̸= 2b = f(b).
♦
Although verifying that the function in Example 5.48 is one-to-one is rather straightforward, it
may be diﬃcult to show that other kinds of functions are one-to-one. For the purpose of showing
a function is one-to-one, it is often helpful to consider the deﬁnition of a one-to-one function from
another perspective.
First, let us restate the deﬁnition of a one-to-one function. A function f : A →B is one-to-one
if whenever a, b ∈A and a ̸= b, then f(a) ̸= f(b). The contrapositive of this implication is the
following.
A function f : A →B is one-to-one if whenever a, b ∈A and f(a) = f(b), then a = b.
Let’s see how this version of the deﬁnition of one-to-one function can be used.
Result 5.49 Let f : R →R be a function deﬁned by f(x) = 5x−3 for x ∈R. Then f is one-to-one.
Proof. We begin with the assumption that f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈R and attempt to show that
a = b. Let f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈R. Then 5a −3 = 5b −3. Adding 3 to both sides and then
dividing by 5, we obtain a = b. Thus f is one-to-one.
A function f : A →B is therefore not one-to-one if there are distinct elements a and b of A such
that f(a) = f(b). Indeed, this is the way to show that a function f is not one-to-one, namely, by
giving an example of two distinct elements a and b of A for which f(a) = f(b).
Example 5.50
Show that the following functions are not one-to-one.
(a) f : R →R is deﬁned by f(x) = x2 + 1 for x ∈R.
(b) g : Z →Z is deﬁned by f(n) = ⌈n/2⌉for n ∈Z.
(c) h : R →R is deﬁned by h(x) = x2 −3x + 1 for x ∈R.
Solution.
(a) The function f is not one-to-one since f(1) = f(−1) = 2 for example.
(b) The function g is not one-to-one since g(1) = g(2) = 1 for example.
(c) The function h is not one-to-one because h(0) = h(3) = 1 for example.
♦
Analysis. It probably wasn’t too diﬃcult to ﬁnd counterexamples in Example 5.50(a) and Exam-
ple 5.50(b). In the case of Example 5.50(c), if we write
h(x) = x2 −3x + 1 = x(x −3) + 1,

172
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
we see that x(x −3) = 0 has x = 0 or x = 3 as solutions and so h(0) = h(3) = 1.
♦
Onto Functions
While a function from a set A to a set B is one-to-one if every element of B is the image of at
most one element of A, we now consider those functions having the property that every element of
B is the image of at least one element of A.
Deﬁnition 5.51
Let A and B be two nonempty sets. A function f : A →B is called onto if every
element of B is the image of some element of A.
In other words, f : A →B is onto if for every element b ∈B, there is some element a ∈A whose
image is b, that is, f(a) = b. Equivalently, f is onto provided the range of f is f(A) = B. A function
that is onto is also called a surjective function or a surjection. We now consider two functions,
one of which is onto and the other is not.
Example 5.52
Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {a, b, c, d}. The functions f : A →B and g : A →B deﬁned by
f = {(1, b), (2, d), (3, d), (4, a), (5, c)} and g = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, c), (4, c), (5, d)}.
Diagrams for these functions are also shown in Figure 5.17. For the function f, every element of B
is the image of some element of A. Thus f is onto. In the case of the function g, the element b is
not the image of any element of A. Consequently, g is not onto.

Figure 5.17: The functions f and g in Example 5.52
According to the deﬁnition, a function f : A →B is onto if every element in B is an image of
some element of A. If A has n elements, then at most n elements of B can be images of A. Thus if
f is onto, then B can contain at most n elements. Therefore, we have the following:
If f : A →B is onto, then |B| ≤|A|.
(5.4)
Consequently, we have the following, which is the contrapositive of the implication (5.4):
If |A| < |B|, then there is no onto function from A to B.
We now consider a more complex example of an onto function.
Result to Prove: The function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 4x −9 for x ∈R is onto.
Proof Strategy:
In order to show that f is onto, it is necessary to show that every real number
is the image of some real number. Certainly, −1 and 7 are images since f(2) = −1 and f(4) = 7.
However, every real number must be shown to be an image, not just −1 and 7. Before showing that
f is onto, let us show that one additional real number, say π, is the image of some real number. We
need to exhibit a real number x such that f(x) = π. Since f(x) = 4x −9, we must have 4x −9 = π
for some real number x. Solving for x, we see that we must have x = π+9
4 . It remains to show that
f
  π+9


is indeed π. Thus

5.4. BIJECTIVE FUNCTIONS

f

−9 = π,
as desired. This observation leads us to a proof that f is onto.
♦
Result 5.53
The function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 4x −9 for x ∈R is onto.
Proof. Since we need to show that every real number is the image of some real number, we begin
with an arbitrary real number, say r. We show that there is a real number x such that f(x) = r.
Since r is a real number, so is (r + 9)/4. Observe that
f
  r+9
4

= 4
  r+9
4

−9 = r.
Thus r is the image of r+9
4
and so f is onto.
Proof Analysis.
The crucial step in the solution of Example 5.53 was to consider f
  r+9
4

. But
where did r+9
4
come from? We started with an arbitrary real number r, which we wanted to show is
the image of some real number x. For this to occur, f(x) must equal r. However, since f(x) = 4x−9,
we must have 4x −9 = r. Solving for x, we obtain x = r+9
4
and that is why we decided to consider
f
  r+9
4

. The algebra used to obtain the number r+9
4
is not part of the justiﬁcation that f is onto,
however.
♦
Example 5.54
Determine whether the function f : R →R deﬁned by
f(x) = x2 −2x + 5
for x ∈R is onto.
Solution. Observe that
x2 −2x + 5 = (x2 −2x + 1) + 4 = (x −1)2 + 4.
Since (x −1)2 ≥0, it follows that f(x) = (x −1)2 + 4 ≥4. Therefore, no real number less than 4
can be an image and so f is not onto.
♦
Analysis.
We could draw the graph of the function deﬁned by y = f(x) = x2 −2x + 5, as in
Figure 5.18, where it now certainly appears that every value of y (every image) is at least 4.

Figure 5.18: The graph of the function f in Example 5.54
While drawing the graph of the function does not constitute a solution, it may very well suggest
a solution. Now select a number less than 4, say 3. If f is onto, then there is a real number x such
that f(x) = 3 and so x2 −2x + 5 = 3 or x2 −2x + 2 = 0. Solving for x by the quadratic formula,
we obtain
x = 2 ± √4 −8
2
= 1 ±
√
−1.
Since neither 1 + √−1 nor 1 −√−1 is a real number, it follows that 3 is not an image of any real
number and so f is not onto. This is an alternative explanation as to why f is not onto.
♦

CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Example 5.55
Determine whether the function f : Z →Z deﬁned by f(n) = 3n for n ∈Z is one-to-one and onto.
Solution. First we show that f is one-to-one. Let f(a) = f(b) for integers a and b. Then 3a = 3b.
Dividing by 3, we obtain a = b and so f is one-to-one.
The function f is not onto however, for suppose it were. Then there would exist an integer n
such that f(n) = 1 and so 3n = 1. But this says that n = 1/3, which, of course, is not an integer. ♦
Analysis. Another explanation as to why the function f in Example 5.55 is not onto is to observe
that all images must be multiples of 3. Since not all integers are multiples of 3, the function f is
not onto.
♦
Example 5.56
Suppose that in a computer science class with 25 students, the instructor gives a 20-point quiz
periodically. Therefore, there are 21 possible scores on each quiz, namely, 0, 1, 2, . . ., 20. Let A be
the set of the 25 students in class and let B = {0, 1, 2, . . ., 20}. Then with each student a ∈A there
is associated an integer b ∈B, namely b is the score that a received on the quiz. This describes a
function f : A →B, where b = f(a) if b is the score of a on the quiz. When the graded quiz is
returned to the class, a student might ask: Did anyone get a perfect score on the quiz? If the answer
is “no,” then the function f is not onto. If the answer is “yes,” then the function f still might not
be onto. In fact, it is hoped that this function is not onto, as no one would want any student to
receive a score of 0 on the quiz. Since |A| > |B|, that is, since there are more students than there
are possible scores, it is impossible for this function to be one-to-one. So there must be at least two
students who received the same quiz score.
♦
Bijective Functions
If f is a function from a set A to a set B that is both one-to-one and onto, then every element
of B is the image of at most one element of A and the image of at least one element of A. That is,
if f is both one-to-one and onto, then every element of B is the image of exactly one element of A.
Functions that are both injective and surjective are especially important in mathematics.
Deﬁnition 5.57
A function that is one-to-one and onto is called a bijective function, a bijec-
tion or a one-to-one correspondence.
Let’s see an example of this.
Example 5.58
For A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {w, x, y, z}, the function f : A →B deﬁned by
f ={(1, y), (2, w), (3, z), (4, x)}
is bijective. Two diagrams of this function are shown in Figure 5.19.
♦
Suppose that A and B are ﬁnite nonempty sets. We stated that a function f : A →B is called
bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto. Since f is one-to-one implies that |A| ≤|B| and f is
onto implies that |A| ≥|B|, it follows that |A| = |B|. A bijective function f : A →B pairs oﬀ
the elements of A and B. For the function f in Example 5.58, this property is displayed more
prominently in the second diagram in Figure 5.19.
Result 5.59
The function f : R+ →R+ deﬁned by f(x) = √x for x ∈R+ is bijective.

Figure 5.19: The function f in Example 5.58
Proof. First, we show that f is one-to-one. Let f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈R+. Then √a =
√
b.
Squaring both sides, we obtain a = b. Therefore, f is one-to-one. Next, we show that f is onto. Let
r be a positive real number. Then r2 is a positive real number and f(r2) =
√
r2 = r; so f is onto.
Thus f is bijective.
Proof Analysis. Let’s look at how the function f in Result 5.59 was shown to be onto. We began
by selecting an arbitrary element in the codomain R+ of positive real numbers. This element was
denoted by r. In order to show that f is onto, we needed to ﬁnd an element x in the domain of f
such that f(x) = r. Since the domain is also the set R+, we are seeking a positive real number x
such that f(x) = r. However, since f(x) = √x, it follows that √x = r and so x = r2. This is why
we decided to consider f(r2).
♦
The function f in Result 5.59 might suggest the consideration of other functions.
Example 5.60
Determine whether the function g : R+ →R deﬁned by g(x) = √x for all x ∈R+ is bijective.
Solution.
Although this function g is one-to-one (the same argument used in the proof of Re-
sult 5.59 to show that f is one-to-one can be used here), g is not onto. Since √x > 0 for every
x ∈R+, no real number y ≤0 can be the image of any positive real number and so g is not onto. ♦
Hence by changing the codomain of the function in Result 5.59, we arrived at a function with a
diﬀerent property. Suppose we now change √x to
3√x.
Example 5.61
Determine whether the function h : R+ →R deﬁned by h(x) =
3√x for all x ∈R+ is bijective.
Solution.
In this case as well,
3√x > 0 for every x ∈R+. Thus no real number y ≤0 can be the
image of any positive real number and so h is not onto. Therefore, h is not bijective. This function
is one-to-one, however.
♦
Now we change the domain of the function in Example 5.61.
Example 5.62
Determine whether the function φ : R →R deﬁned by φ(x) =
3√x for all x ∈R is bijective.
Solution. In this case, we see that φ is indeed bijective.
Proof. First, we show that φ is one-to-one. Let φ(a) = φ(b), where a, b ∈R. Then
3√a =
3√
b.
Cubing both sides, we obtain a = b. Therefore, φ is one-to-one. Next, we show that φ is onto. Let
r ∈R. Then r3 ∈R and φ(r3) =
3√
r3 = r. So φ is onto. Therefore, φ is bijective.
For a nonempty set A, a bijective function f from A to A is called a permutation on (or of) A.
Thus, the function f in Result 5.59 is a permutation on R+, while the function φ in Example 5.62
is a permutation on R.

176
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Example 5.63
Give an example of a permutation on the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
Solution.
Since g = {(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3)} is a bijective function from S to S, it follows that
g is a permutation on S.
♦
Actually, the identity function on every nonempty set A is a permutation on A. Therefore, for
the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4} in Example 5.63,
f = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)}
is also a permutation of S. There are many other permutations of the set S. The number of such
permutations will be discussed in Chapter 9.
Compositions of Bijective Functions
If f and g are two functions for which the composition g ◦f is deﬁned, then g ◦f is one-to-one
whenever f and g are one-to-one. Furthermore, g ◦f is onto whenever f and g are onto. These two
facts are especially important in the study of composition of functions.
Theorem 5.64
Let A, B and C be nonempty sets and let f : A →B and g : B →C be two
functions.
(a)
If f and g are one-to-one, then so is g ◦f.
(b)
If f and g are onto, then so is g ◦f.
Proof. Let f : A →B and g : B →C be one-to-one functions. Suppose that
(g ◦f)(a1) = (g ◦f)(a2),
where a1, a2 ∈A. By deﬁnition,
g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)).
Since g is one-to-one, it follows that f(a1) = f(a2). Moreover, since f is one-to-one, it follows that
a1 = a2. Therefore, g ◦f is one-to-one.
Next suppose that f : A →B and g : B →C are onto. Let c ∈C. We show that there is some
element in A whose image under g ◦f is c. Since g is onto, there exists b ∈B such that g(b) = c.
On the other hand, since f is onto, it follows that there exists a ∈A such that f(a) = b. Therefore,
(g ◦f)(a) = g(f(a)) = g(b) = c.
This implies that the image of a under the function g ◦f is c. Therefore, g ◦f is onto.
Proof Analysis. Looking once more at the proof of Theorem 5.64 and how it was shown that g ◦f
is one-to-one, we see that we started, as expected, with the assumption that (g ◦f)(a1) = (g ◦f)(a2)
for elements a1 and a2 in A. From this, it follows that g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)). The elements f(a1) and
f(a2) belong to B. Since g is one-to-one, whenever g(b1) = g(b2) for b1, b2 ∈B, we have b1 = b2.
Applying this to g(f(a1)) = g(f(a2)) gives us f(a1) = f(a2).
♦
A result that is a consequence of some theorem is referred to as a corollary of the theorem. Since
bijective functions are both one-to-one and onto, we have an immediate corollary of Theorem 5.64.
Corollary 5.65
Let A, B and C be nonempty sets and let f : A →B and g : B →C be two
functions. If f and g are bijective, then so is g ◦f.

5.4. BIJECTIVE FUNCTIONS
177
Inverse Functions
For nonempty sets A and B, we have seen that a bijective function f : A →B pairs oﬀthe
elements of A with the elements of B. For example, for
A = {a, b, c, d, e} and B = {v, w, x, y, z},
the function f : A →B given by
f = {(a, x), (b, v), (c, w), (d, z), (e, y)}
is bijective. The diagram in Figure 5.20(a) shows this function. The elements of B are rearranged in
Figure 5.20(b) to illustrate the bijective character of f more clearly. The inverse function (or the
inverse) f −1 of f is obtained from f by replacing each ordered pair (r, s) of f by (s, r). A diagram
of f −1 can therefore be obtained by reversing the directions of the arrows in Figure 5.20(b). This is
shown in Figure 5.20(c). The function f −1 : B →A is bijective as well. In fact,
f −1 = {(x, a), (v, b), (w, c), (z, d), (y, e)}.

Figure 5.20: The inverse of a bijective function
Suppose that f : A →B is a function that is not bijective. We show that replacing each ordered
pair (r, s) of f by (s, r) does not produce a function from B to A, for suppose that it did, resulting
in a function g : B →A. Since f is not bijective, either f is not one-to-one or f is not onto. If f is
not one-to-one, then A contains distinct elements a1 and a2 such that f(a1) = f(a2) = b for some
b ∈B. However then (b, a1) and (b, a2) are both ordered pairs in g, implying that b has two distinct
images. (See Figure 5.21(a).) This is impossible since g is a function. On the other hand, if f is not
onto, then there is some element c ∈B that is not the image of any element in A. This implies that
there is no element a ∈A such that (a, c) is in f and therefore no element a ∈A such that (c, a) is
in g. Thus c has no image in A. (See Figure 5.21(b)). This is impossible since g is a function from
B to A. These observations are summarized in the theorem below.
Theorem 5.66
Let A and B be nonempty sets. A function f : A →B has an inverse function
f −1 : B →A if and only if f is bijective. Moreover, if f is bijective, then so is f −1.

Figure 5.21: Functions that are not bijective
If we let
A
=
{Abraham, Stephen, Charlene, Debra, Lawrence}
B
=
{calculator, certiﬁcate, cell phone, painting, iPod},
then the distribution of gifts describes a function f : A →B, namely
f = {(Abraham, calculator), (Stephen, certiﬁcate),
(Charlene, cell phone), (Debra, painting), (Lawrence, iPod)}.
Since f is bijective, the inverse f −1 : B →A exists, namely
f −1 = {(calculator, Abraham), (certiﬁcate, Stephen),
(cell phone, Charlene), (painting, Debra), (iPod, Lawrence)}.
While the function f tells us that Stephen received a gift certiﬁcate, for example, the function f −1
tells us that the gift certiﬁcate was awarded to Stephen.
♦
Let’s consider another example of a bijective function.
Example 5.68
Show that the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 3x+2 for x ∈R is bijective. Determine f −1(x)
for x ∈R.
Solution. Let f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈R. Then 3a + 2 = 3b + 2. Subtracting 2 from both sides
and dividing by 3 give us a = b. Therefore, f is one-to-one. Next, let r be a real number. Then r−2
3
is a real number. Furthermore,
f
  r−2

+ 2 = r,
and so f is onto. Hence f is bijective.
Since f is a bijective function, f has an inverse function f −1. Let x ∈R and suppose that the
image of x under f is y. Since f(x) = y, it follows that y = 3x + 2. Therefore, in f −1 the image of
y is x. See Figure 5.22. Because x = y−2
3 , it follows that the image of y in f −1 is y−2
3 . Therefore,
in f −1, the image of a real number a is a−2
3
and in fact, the image of a real number x is x−2
3 . Since
the image of x is f −1(x), it follows that f −1(x) = x−2
3 .
♦
Analysis.
The solution of Example 5.68 suggests how to determine f −1(x) more quickly in this
case. For the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = 3x + 2, which is bijective, we write y = 3x + 2.
Solving for x, we obtain x = (y −2)/3. Interchanging x and y, we obtain y = (x −2)/3 and so
f −1(x) = (x −2)/3.

Example 5.69
The function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) = x7 −4 for x ∈R is known to be bijective. Determine
f −1(x) for x ∈R.
Solution. Let y = x7−4. Solving for x, we ﬁrst obtain x7 = y+4 and so x =
7√y + 4. Interchanging
x and y, we obtain y =
7√x + 4 and therefore f −1(x) =
7√x + 4.
♦
Even knowing that a function f : R →R is bijective does not necessarily mean that an expression
for f −1(x) can be determined however. For example, the function f : R →R deﬁned by f(x) =
x7 + 2x3 + 3x −4 is also bijective, but an algebraic expression for f −1(x) cannot be found.
Suppose that f is a bijective function from a set A to a set B and f(a) = b, where a ∈A and
b ∈B. Since f is bijective, f has an inverse function f −1 from B to A which is also bijective.
Furthermore, f −1(b) = a. Since f : A →B and f −1 : B →A, the composition f −1 ◦f : A →A
exists and
(f −1 ◦f)(a) = f −1(f(a)) = f −1(b) = a.
That is, f −1 ◦f is the identity function on A. (See Figure 5.23.) Also, f −1 : B →A and f : A →B,
so the composition f ◦f −1 : B →B exists and
(f ◦f −1)(b) = f(f −1(b)) = f(a) = b.
Therefore, f ◦f −1 is the identity function on B. These observations are summarized below.

37. Give an example of a ﬁnite set S and a bijection f : S →S such that all of the elements

5.5
Cardinalities of Sets
With the aid of functions, we can take a new and expanded look at what is meant by the number
of elements in a set (especially an inﬁnite set). We deﬁned the cardinality of a ﬁnite set A as the
number of elements in A and denoted this number by |A|. So if C = {c} and D = {w, x, y, z}, then
|C| = 1 and |D| = 4. Furthermore, |∅| = 0. Of course, two ﬁnite sets A and B have the same
cardinality if they have the same number of elements. For example, if A = {a, b, c}, then any set B
having the same cardinality as A must have three elements. Historically, the cardinality of inﬁnite
sets was a diﬃcult idea to understand. Prior to 1874 all inﬁnite sets were considered to be of the
same size. However, in 1874 Georg Cantor wrote a famous article in which he explained why there
are diﬀerent kinds of inﬁnity. Before describing why this is the case, let us return to ﬁnite sets.
Sets Having the Same Cardinality
The sets A = {a, b, c} and B = {x, y, z} both have three elements and so |A| = |B|. We can
construct a bijective function from A to B, say
f = {(a, x), (b, y), (c, z)}.
That is, f pairs oﬀa and x, b and y and c and z. Indeed, for any two ﬁnite nonempty sets A and
B, |A| = |B| if and only if the elements of A and B can be paired oﬀ, that is, |A| = |B| if and only
if there exists a bijective function from A to B. Indeed, for ﬁnite nonempty sets A and B, we could
have deﬁned A and B to have the same cardinality if there exists a bijective function from A to B.
This suggests a deﬁnition for A and B to have the same cardinality whether A and B are ﬁnite sets
or not.
Deﬁnition 5.71
Two nonempty sets A and B (ﬁnite or inﬁnite) are deﬁned to have the same
cardinality, written |A| = |B|, if there exists a bijective function from A to B.

184
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
While there is nothing new about this deﬁnition if A and B are ﬁnite, for inﬁnite sets A and B,
we now have, for the ﬁrst time, a deﬁnition for |A| = |B|. Before considering some consequences of
this deﬁnition for inﬁnite sets, we make a few observations. Suppose that A and B are inﬁnite sets
having the same cardinality. Then there exists a bijective function f from A to B. By Theorem 5.66,
f has an inverse function f −1 from B to A, which is also bijective. Therefore, to determine whether
two inﬁnite sets A and B have the same cardinality, we need to establish the existence of a bijective
function either from A to B or from B to A. Also, suppose that A, B and C are inﬁnite sets such
that |A| = |B| and |B| = |C|. Certainly, if these sets are ﬁnite, then we can immediately conclude
that |A| = |C|. Because |A| = |B| and |B| = |C|, there exist bijective functions f : A →B and
g : B →C. By Corollary 5.65, the composition g ◦f : A →C is also bijective and so, by deﬁnition,
|A| = |C|. So if |A| = |B| and |B| = |C|, then we can conclude that |A| = |C| whether the sets
involved are ﬁnite or inﬁnite.
Denumerable Sets
We now consider an important class of inﬁnite sets.
Deﬁnition 5.72
A set A is called denumerable if |A| = |N|.
Consequently, a set A is denumerable if it has the same number of elements as the set of positive
integers. That is, A is denumerable if there exists a bijective functions from A to N (or a bijective
function from N to A). For example, the set N itself is denumerable since the identity function
f : N →N deﬁned by f(n) = n for each n ∈N is bijective. The following example of a denumerable
set may be unexpected, however.
Result 5.73
The set of positive even integers is denumerable.
Solution. It suﬃces to show that there exists a bijective function from N to the set A of positive
even integers. Consider the function f : N →A deﬁned by f(n) = 2n for n ∈N. First, we show
that f is one-to-one. Assume that f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈N. Then 2a = 2b and so a = b. Thus f
is one-to-one. Next, we show that f is onto. Let m ∈A. Then m = 2k for some positive integer k.
Since f(k) = 2k = m, the function f is onto. Because f is bijective, the set of positive even integers
is denumerable.
♦
The previous example illustrates a rather curious fact, namely, it is possible for a set and a proper
subset to have the same cardinality. This cannot occur with ﬁnite sets, however.
We now provide another example of a denumerable set.

for each n ∈N is bijective.
Proof. First we show that f is one-to-one. Assume that f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈N. Observe that
1 is the only positive integer whose image under f is 0. Hence if f(a) = f(b) = 0, then a = b = 1.
Thus, we may assume that f(a) = f(b) ̸= 0. We consider two cases.
Case 1. f(a) = f(b) > 0. Then a and b are both even, say a = 2x and b = 2y, where x, y ∈N. Thus
f(a) = x and f(b) = y. Since f(a) = f(b), it follows that x = y and so a = 2x = 2y = b.

Case 2. f(a) = f(b) < 0. Then a and b are both odd, say a = 2x + 1 and b = 2y + 1, where
x, y ∈N.
Thus f(a) = −x and f(b) = −y.
Since f(a) = f(b), it follows that x = y and so
a = 2x + 1 = 2y + 1 = b.
Hence f is one-to-one. Next, we show that f is onto. Let n ∈Z. If n ∈N, then f(2n) = n. If n ≤0,
then f(−2n + 1) = n. Thus f is onto.
As a consequence of this result, we have the following.
Corollary 5.75
The set of integers is denumerable.
We now know that |N| = |Z|, that is, the set of positive integers and the set of integers have the
same number of elements. Although this is probably counter-intuitive, when dealing with cardinal-
ities it is essential to rely on the deﬁnition, not on our intuition.
Denote the set of positive rational numbers by Q+. There are certainly many positive rational
numbers that are not positive integers, so we probably wouldn’t expect that |Q+| = |N| but this is
exactly what happens.
Theorem 5.76
The set of positive rational numbers is denumerable.
Proof. Certainly, every positive rational number can be expressed as the ratio a/b of two positive
integers a and b. In fact, this can be done in many ways. For example,
2
3 = 4
6 = 6
9 = 8
12 = · · · .
Figure 5.26 shows a table whose rows and columns are both labeled by 1, 2, 3, . . .. In the entry whose
column is labeled by a and whose row is labeled by b, we place the rational number a/b.

Figure 5.27: Illustrating a bijective function f : N →Q+
The ﬁrst diagonal contains only one number (namely 1 = 1/1), the second diagonal contains two
numbers (ﬁrst 1/2 and then 2 = 2/1) and so on. We now construct a bijective function f from N to
Q+. In particular, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1/2 and f(3) = 2. In general, for n ∈N, f(n) is the nth number
encountered in this manner that has not been previously encountered. For example, f(4) = 1/3 but
f(5) is not 2/2 = 1 since f(1) has already been deﬁned to be 1. The next number after 2/2 = 1 is
3/1 = 3. Since the number 3 has not yet been encountered, we deﬁne f(5) = 3. The images of the
ﬁrst 11 positive integers are therefore:

From the manner in which this function f is deﬁned, f is bijective and so |N| = |Q+|. Therefore,
Q+ is denumerable.
Not only is the set of positive rational numbers denumerable, the set of all rational numbers is
denumerable.
Theorem 5.77
The set Q of rational numbers is denumerable.
Proof. According to Theorem 5.76, Q+ is denumerable and so there is a bijective function f : N →
Q+. If qn denotes the image of n under f, then Q+ = {q1, q2, q3, . . .} and so Q = {0, q1, −q1, q2, −q2, . . .}.
In fact, this says that the function g : N →Q whose images of N shown below

is bijective. Therefore, |N| = |Q| and so Q is denumerable.
At this time, it is useful to make an observation. First, if a set A is denumerable, then it is
inﬁnite and there is a bijective function f : N →A. Thus, every element of A appears exactly once
in the sequence: f(1), f(2), f(3), . . .. If we denote f(n) by an for each positive integer n, then we
are saying that the elements of A can be listed as a1, a2, a3, . . .. Indeed, if we have a set B whose
elements can be listed as b1, b2, b3, . . ., then the function g : N →B deﬁned by g(n) = bn is bijective,
|N| = |B| and B is denumerable. In summary:
A set A is denumerable if and only if it is possible to list the elements of A as a1, a2, a3, . . .,
that is, there is an inﬁnite sequence {an} in which every element of A appears exactly
once.
Another useful result concerning denumerable sets is the following, which we state without proof.
Theorem 5.78
Every inﬁnite subset of a denumerable set is denumerable.

5.5. CARDINALITIES OF SETS
187
Since we know that the set Z of integers and the set Q of rational numbers are denumerable, it
follows by Theorem 5.78 that all of the following sets are denumerable.
(1) the set of even integers,
(2) the set of odd integers,
(3) the set S = {n ≥m : n ∈Z} for a ﬁxed integer m,
(4) the set T = { a
b : a and b are odd integers},
(5) the set U = {
1
2m3n : m, n ∈Z}.
By Example 5.77, we are saying that N and Q have the same number of elements. Since every
inﬁnite set that we have seen is denumerable, it might appear that every two inﬁnite sets have the
same cardinality and that when it comes to sets, there is only one kind of “inﬁnity.” We have already
stated that this is not the case, however. We next show that the closed interval
[0, 1] = {x ∈R : 0 ≤x ≤1}
of real numbers is not denumerable. Before doing this however, we need to describe some character-
istics of real numbers with which you may already be familiar. Of course, we know that every real
number is either rational or irrational. Furthermore, every real number has a decimal expansion.
It is known that irrational numbers have non-repeating decimal expansions. For example, we have
seen that
√
2 is irrational. The decimal expansion of
√
2 begins with 1.42421 · · ·. This expansion
is inﬁnite and there is never a place in the decimal expansion that is periodic (repeats itself) from
some point on. On the other hand, the decimal expansion of a rational number always repeats itself
from some point on. For example,
6
55 = 0.1090909 · · ·
and the “09” continues to repeat; while
1
7 = 0.142857142857142857 · · ·
where “142857” continues to repeat.
Some rational numbers have two decimal expansions. For example,
1
5 = 0.2
(or 1
5 = 0.2000 · · ·) and 1
5 = 0.1999 · · ·.
Also,
3
4 = 0.75000 · · · and 3
4 = 0.74999 · · ·.
Those rational numbers that have two decimal expansions have one decimal expansion where there
is a last nonzero digit d followed only by 0s. The other decimal expansion of such a number is
obtained by replacing d by d −1 and followed only by 9s. In fact, every rational number that is
reduced to lowest terms and such that the only primes that divide its denominator are 2 or 5 has
two decimal expansions; otherwise, it has only one decimal expansion. The number 1/3 = 0.333 · · ·
and the numbers 6/55 and 1/7 therefore have only one decimal expansion; while 1/40 and 3/125
have two decimal expansions.
We are now prepared to show that the closed interval [0, 1] of real numbers is not denumerable.
The nature of the statement suggests that we should use a proof by contradiction.
Theorem 5.79
The closed interval [0, 1] of real numbers is not denumerable.

188
CHAPTER 5. RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that [0, 1] is denumerable. Then there exists a bijective function
f : N →[0, 1]. For each n ∈N, let f(n) = an ∈[0, 1]. Furthermore, for each r ∈[0, 1], there exists
exactly one m ∈N such that f(m) = am = r.
For n ∈N, suppose that the decimal expansion of an is 0.an1an2an3 · · ·, where if an is a rational
number with two decimal expansions, then we select that decimal expansion containing all 9s from
some point on. Hence
f(1)
=
a1 = 0.a11a12a13 · · ·
f(2)
=
a2 = 0.a21a22a23 · · ·
f(3)
=
a3 = 0.a31a32a33 · · ·
and so on. Consider the number b ∈[0, 1] such that
b = 0.b1b2b3 · · ·,
where
bn =
 2
if ann = 1
1
if ann ̸= 1.
For example, if a1 = 0.111 · · ·, a2 = 0.02999 · · ·, a3 = 0.141414 · · · and a4 = .135167781 · · ·, then the
ﬁrst four digits in the decimal expansion of b are 2, 1, 2, 2, that is, b = 0.2122 · · ·. Since there are no
0s and no 9s in the decimal expansion of b, it follows that 0.b1b2b3 · · · is not the alternative decimal
expansion of any rational number. Because the ﬁrst digit in the decimal expansions of b and a1 are
diﬀerent, b ̸= a1. Since the second digit in the decimal expansions of b and a2 are diﬀerent, b ̸= a2.
In general, b ̸= an for all n ∈N. Consequently, there is no positive integer m such that f(m) = b
and so f is not onto. Thus f is not bijective, producing a contradiction.
As a consequence of Theorem 5.79, N and [0, 1] have diﬀerent cardinalities and so there are at
least two diﬀerent sizes of inﬁnite sets.
Countable and Uncountable Sets
Deﬁnition 5.80 A set that is either ﬁnite or denumerable is called countable. A denumerable set
is also called countably inﬁnite. A set that is not countable is called uncountable.
Therefore, {1, 2, 3}, N, Z and Q are countable sets, while [0, 1] is uncountable. The following
result is a consequence of Theorem 5.78.
Theorem 5.81
Every set that contains an uncountable subset is itself uncountable.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a countable set A that contains an uncountable
subset B. Since B is uncountable, B is inﬁnite. Furthermore, since B ⊆A, the set A is inﬁnite.
Because A is inﬁnite and countable, A is denumerable. Thus B is an inﬁnite subset of a denumerable
set. By Theorem 5.78, B is denumerable. This, however, produces a contradiction.
Since the closed interval [0, 1] is uncountable, we have the following consequence of Theorem 5.81.
Corollary 5.82
The set R of real numbers is uncountable.
You may very well have encountered complex numbers in your study of mathematics. A complex
number is a number that can be expressed as a + bi for some real numbers a and b and where
i = √−1. The set of complex numbers is often denoted by C. Since the number b can be 0 in the
deﬁnition of a complex number, every real number is complex and so R ⊆C. Since R is uncountable,
we have the following.
Corollary 5.83
The set C of complex numbers is uncountable.

5.5. CARDINALITIES OF SETS
189
There are many other results involving cardinalities of sets. One example is the following.
Theorem 5.84
If A and B are disjoint denumerable sets, then A ∪B is denumerable.
Proof. Since A and B are denumerable, the sets A and B can be expressed as
A = {a1, a2, a3, . . .} and B = {b1, b2, b3, . . .}.

is bijective. Therefore, A ∪B is denumerable.
An interesting consequence of the preceding theorem is the following.
Theorem 5.85
The set of irrational numbers is uncountable.
Proof. Denote the set of irrational numbers by I. Assume, to the contrary, that I is denumerable.
Since Q and I are disjoint denumerable sets, Q∪I is denumerable by Theorem 5.84. Since Q∪I = R,
it follows that R is denumerable. This, however, contradicts Corollary 5.82.
♦
We have mentioned what it means for two sets A and B to have the same cardinality. We now
introduce the idea of inequalities with cardinal numbers. For two nonempty sets A and B, we say
that |A| ≤|B| if there exists a one-to-one function f : A →B. (Of course, if there exists a one-to-one
function f from A to B that is also onto, then |A| = |B|.) We say that |A| < |B| if |A| ≤|B| and
|A| ̸= |B|, that is, |A| < |B| if there exists a one-to-one function f from A to B but no bijective
function from A to B. Trivially, if A = {a, b, c} and B = {w, x, y, z}, then |A| < |B|. Also |Z| < |R|.
The following theorem shows that for every set A, there exists a set B such that |A| < |B|. In
particular, we can always take B = P(A). The proof of this theorem is somewhat subtle, however.
Theorem 5.86
Every set has a smaller cardinality than its power set, that is,
|A| < |P(A)|
for every set A.
Proof. First, if A = ∅, then P(A) = {∅}. Thus |A| = 0 < 1 = |P(A)|. Hence we may assume that
A ̸= ∅. Consider the function f : A →P(A) deﬁned by
f(a) = {a} for each a ∈A.
We show that f is one-to-one. Assume that f(a) = f(b). Then {a} = {b}. This, however, implies
that a = b and so f is one-to-one. Thus |A| ≤|P(A)|.
To show that |A| < |P(A)|, it remains to prove that there is no bijective function from A to
P(A). We use a proof by contradiction to verify this. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a
bijective function g : A →P(A). For each x ∈A, let g(x) = Ax. Thus Ax ⊆A for each x ∈A.
Moreover, for each x ∈A, there are two possibilities, namely either x ∈Ax or x /∈Ax.
We now deﬁne a subset B of A as follows:
B = {x ∈A : x /∈Ax}.
Since B ⊆A and g : A →P(A) is a bijective function, there exists an element y ∈A such that
g(y) = B. Since g(y) = Ay, this means that B = Ay. Consider the element y. If y ∈B, then
y /∈Ay = B, which is, of course, impossible. Thus y /∈B = Ay. However, by the deﬁnition of B, it
follows that y ∈B, which again is a contradiction.
The preceding theorem then has the following corollary.

There is no set of largest cardinality.

Chapter 6
Algorithms and Complexity
At this point a number of the fundamental concepts that occur throughout discrete mathematics
have been discussed and proof techniques have been introduced to establish the truth of certain
mathematical statements.
Having laid the foundation of discrete mathematics, we now proceed
more deeply into the subject with our emphasis changing to problem-solving. With each problem
that we encounter, various questions can arise, often including one or more of the following:
(i)
Does the problem have a solution?
(ii)
If the problem does have a solution, how many solutions are there?
(iii)
Among all of the solutions of the problem, is there a best (or optimal) solution?
(iv)
Is there a procedure that can be used to ﬁnd a solution to the problem?
Although all of these questions are important, our primary interest in this chapter will be with
question (iv).
6.1
What is an Algorithm?
Suppose that we are given a list of four real numbers. Then it shouldn’t be particularly diﬃcult to:
(1) ﬁnd the largest number on the list,
(2) add the numbers on the list,
(3) determine whether a speciﬁc number is on the list,
(4) determine whether some number appears twice on the list.
But what if the list contains a thousand or perhaps a million numbers? None of the problems (1) –
(4) seems nearly as easy to solve now. Certainly none of these problems can be solved by observation
for such a large list. Indeed, these problems seem better suited to computer-aided solutions. This
suggests writing a computer program in each case that will solve the problem. Before writing such
a program, however, what is needed is a plan – a detailed strategy for solving the problem.
Deﬁnition 6.1
An algorithm is a procedure for solving a problem that consists of input, output
and a ﬁnite sequence of steps that converts the input to the output.
What we want to do therefore is to write algorithms that will solve the problems mentioned
above for lists containing a great many numbers. In the process of doing this, we also want to learn
techniques for writing algorithms that solve other problems as well. The word “algorithm” comes
from the word “algorizm” which emanated from the name of the 9th century Persian mathematician
Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizm. Although the original use of the word “algo-
rithm” dealt with performing arithmetic on the integers, the meaning of this word has expanded to
include procedures for solving a wide variety of problems.
197

198
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Examples of algorithms occurred long before the 9th century, however. In the next chapter, we
will see an algorithm due to the famous geometer Euclid (325 BC–265 BC) for ﬁnding the greatest
common divisor of two positive integers. It is believed that the ﬁrst person to develop a computer
algorithm was Augusta Ada Byron (1815–1852), the Countess of Lovelace and daughter of the
illustrious poet Lord Byron. Tutored in mathematics by Augustus De Morgan, she suggested to
Charles Babbage (1792–1871) a plan for how a computing machine might calculate certain numbers
(called Bernoulli numbers). In her honor, a programming language developed by the United States
Department of Defense was named “Ada” in the 1970s.
There are several ways to describe an algorithm. One way is simply to write the steps of the
algorithm in sentences using English and, for many purposes, this is a useful method. Another
method is to describe the steps using some computer language.
A disadvantage of doing this,
however, is that the algorithm would probably be diﬃcult to understand if the individual reading
this was not familiar with this language. Another common way to specify an algorithm is by means
of what is called pseudocode, an artiﬁcial language that resembles (but still provides the precision
of) the code (programs) of some familiar computer languages. This method is preferred by many
computer scientists and mathematicians and, much of the time, this is the method we will use.
However an algorithm is written, it is important that it is understandable and that it accomplishes
what is intended.
To illustrate how an algorithm might be written using pseudocode, we present an algorithm that
solves problem (1), that is, an algorithm that describes a method for ﬁnding the largest number in
a list a, b, c, d of four numbers. We denote the largest of these four numbers by max(a, b, c, d). So
max(9, 14, 7, 17) = 17 and max(11, 16, 16, 13) = 16.
Algorithm 6.2
Find the Maximum Number in a List of Four Numbers.
This algorithm ﬁnds the largest of four numbers a, b, c, d.
Input: Four numbers a, b, c, d.
Output: x = max(a, b, c, d)
1. x := a [x is assigned the value a]
2. if b > x then x := b [if b > x, then x is assigned the value b]
3. if c > x then x := c [if c > x, then x is assigned the value c]
4. if d > x then x := d [if d > x, then x is assigned the value d]
5. output x
Anything written within brackets [ ] is a comment. It is informational only; it is not a step to
be performed. We will provide comments about many of the steps in the ﬁrst few algorithms that
we present.
We now make a few comments about Algorithm 6.2. The input for this algorithm is four numbers
a, b, c, d. As we indicated, our goal is to ﬁnd the largest of these numbers, which we denote by
x = max(a, b, c, d). Step 1 tells us to assign x the value of a. First, as suggested above, the symbol
:= represents assignment. That is, x := a means that x is initially assigned the value a. According
to Step 2, if b > x (that is, if b > a), then we replace x by b. On the other hand, if it is not true
that b > x, then the conclusion of this step is not executed and we proceed to Step 3 and so on.
Let’s see how this algorithm works in practice.
Example 6.3
Use Algorithm 6.2 to ﬁnd the largest of the four numbers 3, 5, 2, 7.
Solution. In this case, a = 3, b = 5, c = 2, d = 7. Thus x is assigned the value 3 in Step 1. That
is, after Step 1 is performed, x = 3. In Step 2, we see whether b > x, that is, whether 5 > 3. It
is. So x is now assigned the number 5. In Step 3, we check whether c > x, that is, whether 2 > 5.
It is not. Consequently, we move on to Step 4. In this step, we determine whether d > x, that is,
whether 7 > 5. Since this is true, x is assigned 7. Hence after Step 4, x = 7. Step 5 outputs the
value of x, namely 7, which is the maximum of the four numbers.
♦

6.1. WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

What Algorithm 6.2 does in Example 6.3 is illustrated by proceeding downward through the
table below.
x

a = 3

b = 5

c = 2

x = 7
When we write an algorithm using pseudocode, the standard arithmetic operators +, −, ∗or
juxtaposition (for multiplication) and / (for division) are used, as well as the comparative logical
operators =, ̸=, <, ≤, > and ≥. (Observe that = is the equals operator, while := denotes assign-
ment.) It is often useful to introduce loops into algorithms. Two common examples of loops are the
for loop and the conditional while loop.
For integers a and b with a ≤b, a for loop has the following appearance, according to whether
there is a single step or two or more steps to perform within the loop.
for i = a to b do
for i = a to b do
this step
begin
these steps
end
When a for loop is ﬁrst encountered, i is assigned the integer a and the step on the next line is
executed. If there is more than one step to be executed, then these steps are written between begin
and end and all such steps are executed in the order listed. Once the step or steps are executed,
the value of i is increased by 1 to a + 1 and the step or steps are executed again. The value of i is
then increased by 1 again, this time to a + 2 and, once again, the step or steps are executed. This
continues as long as i ≤b. When i reaches the value b, the step or steps are executed for the last
time. When i > b, the loop terminates and the algorithm proceeds to the step that immediately
follows the for loop.
For a statement P, a while loop has the following appearance, according to whether there is a
single step to perform within the loop or two or more steps.
while P do
while P do
this step
begin
these steps
end
If a while loop is encountered in an algorithm and there is a single step on the next line, then
this step is executed provided the statement P is true. If P is true and there is more than one step
to execute, then the steps written between begin and end are executed in the order listed. If P is
true and after the step or steps within the while loop have been executed, we return to the while
loop and check once again to determine whether P is a true or false statement. If P is true, then we
proceed as above. On the other hand, if the while loop is encountered and the statement P is false,
then the algorithm proceeds immediately to the next step in the algorithm that follows the while
loop. Ordinarily, there is more than one step within a while loop and the statement P is adjusted
at some stage.
Indeed, what is accomplished in a for loop can also be accomplished in the following while loop,
where a and b are integers with a ≤b.
i := a
while i ≤b do
begin
these steps
i := i + 1
end

200
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
We now use a for loop to write a more general algorithm that ﬁnds the largest number in a
potentially long list of numbers.
Algorithm 6.4
Find the Maximum Number in a List of Numbers.
This algorithm ﬁnds the largest number in a list s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: x = max(s)
1. x := a1 [x is assigned the ﬁrst number in the sequence and is the temporary
maximum]
2. for i := 2 to n do [i is sequentially assigned the integers from 2 to n]
3.
if ai > x then x := ai [if ai > x, then a value larger than x has been found
and x is replaced by ai]
4. output x
What Algorithm 6.4 Does
1. Sets the temporary maximum equal to the ﬁrst number on the list.
2. Compares the next number on the list with the temporary maximum and, if this number is
larger, sets the temporary maximum equal to this number.
3. Repeats the previous step if there are more numbers remaining on the list.
4. Stops when the list has been exhausted and outputs the temporary maximum, which is the
maximum number on the list.
We now ﬁnd the largest number in a list of four numbers using the more general Algorithm 6.4.
Example 6.5
Illustrate Algorithm 6.4 for the sequence s : 8, 11, 11, 9.
Solution. In this case, a1 = 8, a2 = 11, a3 = 11, a4 = 9. The numbers in the sequence s are input,
as is the length n = 4 of this sequence. In Step 1, x is assigned the number 8. Step 2 is a for loop
and i is initially assigned the value 2. Because a2 = 11 > 8 = x, the value 11 is assigned to x in
Step 3. We return to the for loop in Step 2 and i is increased to 3. Because a3 = 11 > 11 is not true,
the conclusion of Step 3 is not executed. We return to Step 2, where i is increased to 4 = n. Since
a4 = 9 > 11 = x is not true and i = n, we proceed to Step 4, which outputs x. Because x = 11, this
is the maximum of the numbers in the sequence s.

We now consider a general algorithm for solving problem (2); that is, rather than adding four
numbers, the algorithm will ﬁnd the sum of the numbers in any ﬁnite list of numbers.
Algorithm 6.6
Determine the Sum of the Numbers in a Sequence.
This algorithm ﬁnds the sum of the numbers in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.

6.1. WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

Output: x =

1. x := 0 [x is assigned the value 0, which is the temporary sum]
2. for i := 1 to n do [i is assigned the integers from 1 to n]
3.
x := x + ai [ai is added to the current value of x to provide the new value
of the temporary sum x]
4. output x
What Algorithm 6.6 Does
1. Sets the temporary sum equal to 0.
2. Adds the ﬁrst (or next) number in the sequence to the temporary sum and this new sum
becomes the temporary sum.
3. Repeats the previous step if there are more numbers remaining on the list.
4. Stops when the list has been exhausted and outputs the temporary sum, which is the sum of
all numbers on the list.
We now use this algorithm to add four numbers.
Example 6.7
Illustrate Algorithm 6.6 for the sequence s : 3, 7, 8, 4.
Solution. In this case, n = 4 and a1 = 3, a2 = 7, a3 = 8, a4 = 4. In Step 1, x is assigned the
value 0. Step 2 is a for loop in which i is initially assigned the value 1. In Step 3, x is assigned the
number 0 + a1 = 0 + 3 = 3. We now return to Step 2, where i is increased to 2. In Step 3, x is now
replaced by 3 + a2 = 3 + 7 = 10. Once again, we return to Step 2, where i is increased to 3. Now x
is assigned the number 10 + a3 = 10 + 8 = 18 in Step 3. We return to Step 2, where i is increased
to 4 = n. In Step 3, x is assigned the number 18 + a4 = 18 + 4 = 22. Since the for loop is complete,
we proceed to Step 4 and x = 22 (the sum of the four numbers in s) is output.

We now present a method for solving a problem that is more general than problem (3), that is,
an algorithm to determine whether some speciﬁc number appears on a given ﬁnite list of numbers.
A while loop is introduced in the following algorithm.
Algorithm 6.8
Determine Whether a Speciﬁed Number Appears in a Sequence.
This algorithm determines whether a speciﬁed number k is one of the numbers in a list s : a1, a2, . . . , an
of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n, a number k and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: k “is in the sequence” or k “is not in the sequence” as appropriate.

whether ai = k]
4.

end
5. if i = n + 1 then output k “is not in the sequence”
What Algorithm 6.8 Does
1. Sets an index i equal to 1.
2. Compares the index i to the size n of the sequence and, provided i ≤n, determines whether
the ﬁrst (or next) number in the sequence is the number of interest (and, if so, outputs this
information and increases the index to 1 plus the size); otherwise, it increases the index by 1.
Setting i = n + 1 results in an exit from the while loop.
3. Repeats the previous step provided the index does not exceed the size of the sequence.
4. Outputs the information that the number of interest is not in the sequence if the index equals
1 plus the size.
Let’s see what Algorithm 6.8 does when k = 10 and s : 8, 14, 10, 9.
Example 6.9
Illustrate Algorithm 6.8 for k = 10 and s : 8, 14, 10, 9.
Solution. Here k = 10, n = 4 and a1 = 8, a2 = 14, a3 = 10, a4 = 9. In Step 1, i is assigned the
value 1. Step 2 is a while loop. Since 1 = i ≤n = 4, the two steps (Steps 3 and 4) between begin
and end are performed. Since a1 ̸= 10, the conclusion of Step 3 is not executed. In Step 4, i is
increased to 2. Because 2 ≤4, Steps 3 and 4 are performed again. Since a2 ̸= 10, we move on to
Step 4, where i becomes 3. Because 3 ≤4, Steps 3 and 4 are performed once again. Now a3 = 10
and so 10 is in the sequence is the output. Also, i is assigned the number 5. In Step 4, i is increased
to 6. Since 6 ≤4 is not true, we leave the while loop and proceed to Step 5. Because i ̸= 5, the
algorithm ends and we are left with the output: 10 is in the sequence.

under consideration.

Illustrate Algorithm 6.8 for k = 10 and s : 8, 14, 9.
Solution. In this case, k = 10, n = 3 and a1 = 8, a2 = 14, a3 = 9. In Step 1, i is assigned the
number 1. Step 2 is a while loop. Since 1 = i ≤n = 3, we perform Steps 3 and 4. Since a1 ̸= 10,
the conclusion of Step 3 is not executed. In Step 4, i is increased to 2. Because 2 ≤3, we perform
Steps 3 and 4. Since a2 ̸= 10, we move on to Step 4, where i becomes 3. Because 3 ≤3, we again
perform Steps 3 and 4. Since a3 ̸= 10, we move on to Step 4, where i is increased to 4. Since 4 ≤3

We now turn to the ﬁnal problem (4) in our original list of problems. In this problem, we are
asked whether some number appears two or more times in a given sequence of numbers.
Let’s
suppose that we not only want to know whether a number appears twice in a sequence but which
number has this property if this should occur. In the algorithm described below, a “nested while
loop” appears. Just as the two innermost parentheses are paired oﬀin (· · · (· · ·) · · ·), so too are the
innermost begin and end paired oﬀwhen two ends follow two begins.
Algorithm 6.11
Determine Whether Some Number Appears Twice in a Sequence.
This algorithm determines whether a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers contains two equal
terms.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: ai “appears twice in the sequence” or “no term appears twice in the sequence” as
appropriate.
1. i := 0

i := n + 1 and j := n
7.
j := j + 1
end
end
8.
if i = n then output “no term appears twice in the sequence”
We now apply this algorithm for a particular sequence.
Example 6.12
Illustrate Algorithm 6.11 for the sequence s : 11, 9, 13, 9.
Solution. For this sequence, n = 4 and a1 = 11, a2 = 9, a3 = 13, a4 = 9. In Step 1, i is assigned the
value 0. Since 0 = i ≤n −1 = 3, all of Steps 3 – 5 are performed. By Steps 3 and 4, we have i = 1
and j = 2. Step 5 is a while loop that lies within the while loop at Step 2. Because 2 = j ≤n = 4,
we perform Steps 6 and 7 within the while loop at Step 5. Because a1 ̸= a2, the conclusion of Step 6
is not performed. By Step 7, j is increased to 3. The while loop at Step 5 is still in progress. Since
3 = j ≤n = 4, Steps 6 and 7 are performed. Because a1 ̸= a3, the conclusion of Step 6 is not
performed and we move to Step 7 where j is increased to 4. The while loop at Step 5 is still in
progress. Because 4 = j ≤n = 4, Steps 6 and 7 are performed. Because a1 ̸= a4, we move to Step 7
where j is increased to 5. Because 5 = j ≤n = 4 is not true, the while loop at Step 5 is completed.

204
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Returning to the while loop at Step 2, we have 1 = i ≤n−1 = 3 and so Steps 3 – 5 are performed.
In Steps 3 and 4, i becomes 2 and j is assigned the value 3. We next encounter the while loop at
Step 5. Because 3 = j ≤n = 4, Steps 6 and 7 are performed. Since a2 ̸= a3, we move to Step 7,
where j is increased to 4. The while loop at Step 5 is still in progress. Because 4 = j ≤n = 4,
Steps 6 and 7 are performed. Since a2 = a4, the following is output: 9 appears twice in the sequence
and i is assigned the value n + 1 = 5 and j is assigned n = 4. In Step 7, j is increased to 5. Because
5 = j ≤n = 4 is not true, the while loop at Step 5 is completed. Returning to the while loop at
Step 2, we ﬁnd that 5 = i ≤n−1 = 3 is not true and the conclusions in Steps 3–5 are not performed.
Now the while loop at Step 2 is complete and we move to Step 8. Because 5 = i = n = 4 is false,
the conclusion of Step 8 is not performed and the algorithm is completed.

Growth of Functions
Ordinarily, there are several algorithms that give a solution to a particular problem. Given two
algorithms that provide a solution to the same problem, it is natural to ask whether one of these
algorithms might be preferred over the other. In order to study this question, we describe a common
method of comparing the growth of two functions f and g deﬁned on the set N of positive integers
and whose values are positive real numbers, that is, whose codomain is the set R+.

206
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Big-O of a Function
Deﬁnition 6.13 A function f : N →R+ is big-O (or big-oh) of a function g : N →R+, written
f = O(g) or f(n) = O(g(n)), if there exist a positive constant C and positive integer k such that
f(n) ≤Cg(n) for every integer n ≥k.
(6.1)
Suppose that the graphs of two functions y = f(x) and y = g(x) are given in Figure 6.1(a),
where f : R+ →R+ and g : R+ →R+. If there exist some positive constant C and positive integer
k such that f(x) ≤Cg(x) for every real number x ≥k (see Figure 6.1(b)), then f(n) ≤Cg(n) for
every integer n ≥k and f(n) = O(g(n)).

Figure 6.1: The graphs of functions f, g and Cg
If f(n) = O(g(n)), then for large values of n,
f grows no faster than a constant times g.
Observe that if f(n) ≤Cg(n) for all n ≥k, then f(n) ≤C′g(n) for all n ≥k′ for each constant
C′ ≥C and each integer k′ ≥k. Therefore, the constants C and k in (6.1) are not unique. In fact, if
C is chosen large enough, then f(n) ≤Cg(n) for every positive integers n (that is, k can be chosen
to be 1). (See Exercise 1.)
Example 6.14
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions deﬁned by f(n) = 2n2 and g(n) = n3 for all
n ∈N. Show that f = O(g).
Solution. Since n2 ≤n3 whenever n ≥1, it follows that 2n2 ≤2n3 for n ≥1. Therefore, for every
integer n ≥1, 2n2 ≤2(n3). Hence f = O(g), where C = 2 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition.
♦
Example 6.15
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions deﬁned by f(n) = 3n2 + 6 and g(n) = n3 + n for
all n ∈N. Show that f = O(g).
Solution. Certainly n2 ≤n3 for n ≥1 and so 3n2 ≤3n3 for n ≥1. Also, 6 ≤3n for n ≥2.
Therefore, for every integer n ≥2,
3n2 + 6 ≤3(n3 + n).
Hence f = O(g), where C = 3 and k = 2 in the deﬁnition.
♦
For two functions f : N →R+ and g : N →R+, the function f is not big-O of g and we write
f ̸= O(g) or f(n) ̸= O(g(n)) if there exist no positive constant C and positive integer k for which

6.2. GROWTH OF FUNCTIONS
207
f(n) ≤Cg(n) for every integer n ≥k.
While f = O(g) for the functions f and g deﬁned in Examples 6.14 and 6.15, g ̸= O(f). We verify
this for Example 6.15, while this is left as an exercise for Example 6.14 (see Exercise 2).
Example 6.16
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions deﬁned by f(n) = 3n2 + 6 and g(n) = n3 + n for
all n ∈N. Show that g ̸= O(f).
Solution. We use a proof by contradiction. Assume, to the contrary, that g = O(f). Then there
exist a positive constant C and a positive integer k such that
n3 + n ≤C(3n2 + 6) for n ≥k.
(6.2)
Dividing both sides of the inequality in (6.2) by n3, we have
1 + 1
n2 ≤3C
n + 6C
n3 for n ≥k.
(6.3)
Let n be an integer that is greater than all of k, 6C and 2, that is, n > max(k, 6C, 2). Then
1
n < 1
6C
and
1
n < 1
2.
So
3C
n = 3C · 1
n < 3C · 1
6C = 1
2
and
6C
n3 = 6C
n2 · 1
n < 6C
n2 · 1
6C = 1
n2 < 1
4.
Thus the right side of (6.3) is
3C
n + 6C
n3 < 1
2 + 1
4 = 3
4;
while the left side of (6.3) is 1 +
1
n2 > 1, which is a contradiction.
♦
In Examples 6.15 and 6.16, f is a polynomial function of degree 2 and g is a polynomial function
of degree 3 and we showed that f = O(g) but g ̸= O(f). In fact, the following holds:
If f and g are two polynomial functions where the degree of g is greater than that of f,
then f = O(g) but g ̸= O(f).
We consider another example to illustrate this fact.
Example 6.17
Let the functions f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be deﬁned by
f(n) = n and g(n) = n2 for all n ∈N.
Then f = O(g) but g ̸= O(f).
Solution. Observe that f = O(g) since n ≤n2 for every positive integer n (and so we may take
C = 1 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition). On the other hand g ̸= O(f), for suppose, to the contrary, that
g = O(f). Then there exist a positive constant C and a positive integer k such that
n2 ≤Cn for all n ≥k.

208
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Dividing the inequality n2 ≤Cn by n, we have that n ≤C for all n ≥k. However, n ≤C is not
satisﬁed if we choose n to be an integer that is both greater than C and greater than k. Hence
n = O(n2) but n2 ̸= O(n).
♦
We saw in Chapter 5 that
(1) 2n ≥n for all n ≥1,
(2) 2n ≥n2 for all n ≥4 and
(3) n! ≥2n for all n ≥4.
Consequently,
n = O(2n), n2 = O(2n), and 2n = O(n!).
However,
2n ̸= O(n), 2n ̸= O(n2), and n! ̸= O(2n).
Several familiar functions are listed below in increasing order. That is, each function is big-O of
every function listed to its right, while no function is big-O of a function listed to its left. We write
log n for log2 n.

n log n

The graphs of the functions f1(x) = 1, f2(x) = log x, f3(x) = x, f4(x) = x log x, f5(x) = x2 and
f6(x) = 2x are given in the Figure 6.2. Notice that the scales on the two axes are diﬀerent. Observe
that x2 > 2x when 2 < x < 4. For the one integer value 3 in this range, 32 > 23. However, 2x ≥x2
when x ≥4. Thus 2n ≥n2 for every integer n ≥4. Taking C = 1 and k = 4 in the deﬁnition, we
see that n2 = O(2n).

Big-Theta of a Function
If f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ are two functions for which f = O(g), then we know that
f(n) ≤Cg(n) for some positive constant C and suﬃciently large positive integers n (that is, Cg(n)

6.2. GROWTH OF FUNCTIONS
209
is an upper bound for f(n) for suﬃciently large positive integers n). Therefore, we know that f
grows no faster than a constant times g for suﬃciently large n, but this provides us with no clear
indication on how to compare the growth of f and g. We now describe a concept that deals with
this.
Deﬁnition 6.18
A function f : N →R+ is big-theta of a function g : N →R+, written
f = Θ(g) or f(n) = Θ(g(n)), if there exist positive constants C1 and C2 and a positive integer k
such that
C1g(n) ≤f(n) ≤C2g(n) for every integer n ≥k.
When f = Θ(g), we say that
f and g grow at the same rate.
Example 6.19
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions deﬁned by f(n) = 2n2 + 6 and g(n) = 3n2 + 3n
for all n ∈N. Show that f = Θ(g).
Solution. Observe that for each integer n ≥3,
2n2 + 6 ≤2n2 + 2n = 2
3(3n2 + 3n).
Furthermore, for each integer n ≥1,
2n2 + 6 = n2 + n2 + 6 ≥n2 + n + 6 ≥n2 + n = 1
3(3n2 + 3n).
Therefore, for each integer n ≥3,
1
3(3n2 + 3n) ≤2n2 + 6 ≤2
3(3n2 + 3n),
or
1
3g(n) ≤f(n) ≤2
3g(n).
Thus f = Θ(g), where C1 = 1
3, C2 = 2
3 and k = 3 in the deﬁnition.
♦
According to Example 6.19 then, 2n2 + 6 = Θ(3n2 + 3n). In fact, the following holds:
If f and g are two polynomial functions of the same degree, then f = Θ(g).
There is a close connection between the big-O and big-theta concepts.
Theorem 6.20
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions. Then f = Θ(g) if and only if
f = O(g) and g = O(f).
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that f = Θ(g). Then there exist positive constants C1 and C2 and a positive
integer k such that
C1g(n) ≤f(n) ≤C2g(n) for every integer n ≥k.
In particular, f(n) ≤C2g(n) for every integer n ≥k. So f = O(g). Since C1g(n) ≤f(n) for every
integer n ≥k and C1 > 0, it follows that g(n) ≤

1
C1

f(n) for every integer n ≥k. Hence g = O(f).
Next, we verify the converse. Assume that f = O(g) and g = O(f). Since f = O(g), there exists
a positive constant C′ and a positive integer k′ such that
f(n) ≤C′g(n) for every integer n ≥k′.

210
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Because g = O(f), there exists positive constant C′′ and a positive integer k′′ such that
g(n) ≤C′′f(n) for every integer n ≥k′′.
Thus,
f(n) ≥
  1
C′′

g(n) for every integer n ≥k′′.
Let k = max(k′, k′′). Thus for every integer n ≥k,
  1
C′′

g(n) ≤f(n) ≤C′g(n)
and so f = Θ(g).
Let’s consider an illustration of the previous theorem.
Example 6.21
Let the functions f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be deﬁned by
f(n) = n2 + 3n + 2
2
and g(n) = n2
for all n ∈N. Verify that f = Θ(g).
Solution. Since
n2 + 3n + 2
2
≤n2 + 3n2 + 2n2
2
= 3n2
for every positive integer n, it follows that f = O(g). On the other hand,
n2 ≤n2 + 3n + 2 = 2
n2 + 3n + 2
2

for all n ∈N. It follows that g = O(f).
Since f = O(g) and g = O(f), it then follows by Theorem 6.20 that f = Θ(g).
♦
The following is a fundamental property of the big-theta concept and can be considered as a
consequence of Theorem 6.20 (see Exercise 13).
Theorem 6.22
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions. If f = Θ(g), then g = Θ(f).
There is also a connection between the big-theta concept and limits.
Theorem 6.23
Let f : N →R+ and g : N →R+ be two functions. If lim
n→∞
f(n)
g(n) = c for some
positive real number c, then f = Θ(g).
The converse of Theorem 6.23 is not true. For example, consider the functions f : N →R+ and
g : N →R+ deﬁned by f(n) = n(2 + sin n) and g(n) = n. Since −1 ≤sin n ≤1 for every positive
integer n, it follows that n ≤n(2 + sin n) ≤3n, that is,
1 · g(n) ≤f(n) ≤3g(n)
for every positive integer n. Hence f = Θ(g). However, it turns out that
lim
n→∞
f(n)
g(n) = lim
n→∞
n(2 + sin n)
n
= lim
n→∞(2 + sin n)
does not exist.
Although we’ve only been concerned with functions having domain N and codomain R+ as these
are the functions that we will encounter later in the chapter, it is possible to deﬁne and study the
growth of functions having diﬀerent domains and codomains.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
6.3
Analysis of Algorithms
If we have a relatively complex computational problem to solve, then we have seen that a logical
ﬁrst step is to write an algorithm. This gives us a detailed step by step plan for solving the problem.
It is always a good idea to try out this procedure on a small data set to convince ourselves that
the algorithm is doing as we planned. The next step is to use the algorithm as a roadmap to guide
us in writing a computer program. After doing this, it would probably be wise to run the program
with some data sets for which the answer is known. Of course, one would expect that the larger the
size of the data, the longer it would take to run the program. But what if we run the program and
ﬁnd that it is taking an inordinately long time to obtain a solution? Then this is unacceptable and
all of our eﬀort seems to have been wasted. It would certainly have been useful to know this could
happen before we went to the trouble of writing the computer program and running it with data.
Complexity of an Algorithm
As we noted earlier, there are often many algorithms for solving a particular problem. Quite
possibly, some of these algorithms are better than others.
But what do we mean by this?
It
is simply too complicated and too time-consuming (and too expensive) to compare every pair of
computer programs by running them with the same data set.
Furthermore, we might reach a
diﬀerent conclusion if we change the data. Rather than consider two diﬀerent programs that have
been written to solve a particular problem, it makes more sense to study instead what led to the
programs, namely, their respective algorithms. The idea then is to have a method for comparing two
algorithms. By an analysis of an algorithm, we normally refer to a process for obtaining estimates
of the time and space needed to execute the algorithm. The complexity of an algorithm is the
amount of space and time needed to execute the algorithm. The space complexity of an algorithm
concerns a study of computer memory and the data structures employed, which is not a subject of
this book.
The time complexity of an algorithm concerns a study of the time required to solve the problem
using the algorithm as a function of the size of the input. Good estimates of the time needed to
execute a program are often extraordinarily diﬃcult to obtain, for these depend on such things as
the computer being used, how the data is represented, what software is being used and how the
program is being translated into machine language. Satisfactory estimates can usually be obtained,
however, by considering the time complexity of the underlying algorithm. To determine a measure
of the speed of an algorithm, we count the number of certain kinds of operations performed by the
algorithm. This ordinarily provides a reasonable estimate of the speed of the algorithm and gives us
a mechanism for comparing two algorithms. If the major operations of an algorithm are comparative
operations, then the time complexity of an algorithm is the number of comparisons made when the
algorithm is used to solve a problem. On the other hand, if the major operations are arithmetic
(addition, multiplication and so on), then the time complexity of an algorithm is the number of
these operations.
We now determine the time complexity of some algorithms, beginning with Algorithm 6.4, where
the maximum number in a sequence of n numbers is found.
Example 6.24
Determine the time complexity of Algorithm 6.4.
Algorithm 6.4:
Find the largest number in a list s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: x = max(s)

6.3. ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
213
1. x := a1 [x is assigned the ﬁrst number in the sequence]
2. for i := 2 to n do [i is sequentially assigned the integers from 2 to n]
3.
if ai > x then x := ai [if ai > x, then a value larger than x has been
found and x is replaced by ai]
4. output x
Solution. A comparison occurs in Step 3 for each of the n −1 values of i (i = 2, 3, . . ., n). Thus
there are n −1 comparisons and the time complexity of Algorithm 6.4 is n −1.
♦
It is ordinarily the case that we are not concerned with the exact number of comparisons or
arithmetic operations when computing the time complexity of an algorithm. For instance, in Exam-
ple 6.24, we are not counting any arithmetic operations or assignments done within the algorithm.
That is, the number of comparisons is only meant to give us an estimate or an idea of how much
time it would take to use this algorithm on a data set of size n. To be sure, the time required to
solve a problem using a particular algorithm does not depend only on the number of operations used
in the algorithm. It depends also on the computer and software being used. However running a
program that implements an algorithm to solve the problem on a diﬀerent (faster) computer or with
diﬀerent (improved) software typically results in a time improvement that is a constant multiple
of the earlier time used and depends little on n. This suggests the advantage of using the big-O
notation to discuss time complexity. Hence what we wish to do is to express the time complexity as
O(f(n)) or, better yet, Θ(f(n)) for some (preferably common) function f : N →R+.
If the time complexity of an algorithm can be expressed as Θ(f(n)) for some polynomial f(n),
then we say that the algorithm has polynomial time complexity. Consequently, the time com-
plexity of such an algorithm can be expressed as Θ(np) for a nonnegative integer p. If p = 0, that
is, if the time complexity is O(1), then there are only a ﬁnite number of operations being counted
in the algorithm and so the algorithm has constant time complexity. An algorithm with time
complexity Θ(n) has linear time complexity and one with time complexity Θ(n2) has quadratic
time complexity. So Algorithm 6.4 has linear time complexity as n −1 = Θ(n).
Suppose that two algorithms A and B have time complexities O(f(n)) and O(g(n)), respectively.
If f(n) = O(g(n)) but g(n) ̸= O(f(n)), then Algorithm A is said to be more eﬃcient than
Algorithm B. If f(n) = Θ(g(n)), then f and g are considered to have the same degree of eﬃciency.
Next, we determine the time complexity of Algorithm 6.6, where the sum of the numbers in a
sequence of size n is computed.
Example 6.25
Determine the time complexity of Algorithm 6.6.
Algorithm 6.6:
Find the sum of the numbers in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: x =
n
X
i=1
ai.
1. x := a1 [x is assigned the value a1]
2. for i := 2 to n do [i is assigned the integers from 2 to n]
3.
x := x + ai [ai is added to the current value of x to provide the new value of x]
4. output x
Solution. This is not an algorithm that involves comparisons. Since addition is the key operation,
we interpret the time complexity in this case as the number of additions. There is an addition
for each value of i (i = 2, 3, . . . , n). Thus there are n −1 additions and the time complexity of
Algorithm 6.6 is n −1 = Θ(n).
♦
Analyzing Algorithm 6.8, which determines whether some number k appears in a sequence of n
numbers, introduces something we have not yet seen.

214
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Algorithm 6.8: Determine whether a speciﬁed number k is one of the numbers in a list s : a1, a2,
. . ., an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n, a number k and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: k “is in the sequence” or k “is not in the sequence” as appropriate.
1. i := 1 [i is assigned the number 1]
2. while i ≤n do [provided i ≤n, Steps 3 and 4 are performed]
begin
3.
if ai = k then output k “is in the sequence” and i := n + 1 [it is determined
whether ai = k]
4.
i := i + 1 [i is increased by 1]
end
5. if i = n + 1 then output k “is not in the sequence”
In Step 1, i is assigned the value 1. In Step 2, a comparison is made since 1 is compared with n.
In Step 3, another comparison is made as it is determined whether a1 = k. Suppose, in fact, that
a1 = k. Then i is assigned the value n+1. In Step 4, i is assigned the value n+2. In Step 2, n+2 is
compared with n. Since n + 2 ≤n is not true, we leave the while loop and move on to Step 5 where
i = n + 2 is compared with n + 1. This is the ﬁnal step of Algorithm 6.8. A total of 4 comparisons
have been made. What we have just described is the minimum number of comparisons that can be
made when Algorithm 6.8 is executed. The number of comparisons made when Algorithm 6.8 is
used can vary widely depending on where in the sequence the number k appears or, in fact, whether
k appears in the sequence at all.
The maximum number of comparisons that can occur when a problem is solved using an algorithm
is called the worst case time complexity of the algorithm.
Example 6.26
Determine the worst case time complexity of Algorithm 6.8.
Solution. The maximum number of comparisons in Algorithm 6.8 occurs when k is the last term
of the sequence or when k does not appear in the sequence. Suppose that one of these situations
occurs. In Step 2, i and n are compared for i = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. This is a total of n + 1 comparisons.
In Step 3, ai and k are compared for i = 1, 2, . . ., n. This is a total of n comparisons. Whether
an = k or not, i is compared with n + 1 in Step 5. Hence the total number of comparisons is
(n + 1) + n + 1 = 2n + 2 = Θ(n), which is the worst case time complexity of Algorithm 6.8.
♦
Without additional information, it is impossible to know how likely it is that a given number k
might appear in a sequence of n distinct numbers. However, if we know beforehand that k appears
somewhere in the sequence, then it is equally likely that k is any one of the n numbers. The average
number of comparisons needed to determine where k appears in the sequence if k is any one of the
n terms is called the average case time complexity of this algorithm. This gives a user of the
algorithm a better estimate of how many comparisons are likely to be needed if the algorithm is
used (and if the number k is in the sequence). Of course, the worst case complexity tells a user that
the number of comparisons will never be greater than a certain number (2n + 2 for Algorithm 6.8).
We next determine the average case time complexity of Algorithm 6.8. For this purpose, it will be
useful for us to recall the formula:
1 + 2 + · · · + n = n(n + 1)
2
(6.4)
for every positive integer n, which we ﬁrst encountered in Chapter 4.
Example 6.27
Determine the average case time complexity of Algorithm 6.8.

6.3. ANALYSIS OF ALGORITHMS
215
Solution. Suppose that at = k where 1 ≤t ≤n. In Step 2, i and n are compared for i = 1, 2, . . ., t
and in Step 3, ai and k are compared for i = 1, 2, . . ., t. In Step 3, when at = k, i is changed from t
to n + 1. In Step 4, i is increased to n + 2. In Step 2, n + 2 and n are compared and the while loop
is exited. In Step 5, n + 2 and n + 1 are compared and the algorithm ends. Hence the total number
of comparisons made when at = k is t + t + 1 + 1 = 2t + 2. Since t can be any one of 1, 2, . . ., n, the
average number of comparisons made by Algorithm 6.8 is
Pn
t=1(2t + 2)
n
=
4 + 6 + 8 + · · · + (2n + 2)
n
=
2[2 + 3 + 4 + · · · + (n + 1)]
n
.
By the formula in (6.4),
1 + 2 + · · · + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)
2
and so
2 + 3 + 4 + · · · + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)
2
−1.
Therefore,
4 + 6 + 8 + · · · + (2n + 2)

i
n
= (n + 1)(n + 2) −2

Thus the average number of comparisons made when Algorithm 6.8 is used (knowing that k appears
in the sequence) is n + 3 = Θ(n), which is the average case time complexity of Algorithm 6.8.

For a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n ≥2 numbers, we now consider an algorithm that computes
the sum

1≤i<j≤3
aiaj = a1a2 + a1a3 + a2a3.

This algorithm ﬁnds the sum of the products of every two numbers in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an

Let’s see what Algorithm 6.28 does for a sequence of length 3.

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Example 6.29
Illustrate Algorithm 6.28 for the sequence s : a1, a2, a3.
Solution. In Step 1, x is assigned the value 0. Step 2 is a for loop. We proceed through this loop.
In Step 3, t is assigned the value 0. Step 4 is a for loop within the for loop at Step 2 with initial
value j = 2. Steps 5 and 6 are performed. In Step 5, r is assigned a1a2 and in Step 6, t is assigned
0 + a1a2 = a1a2. We return to the for loop at Step 4 and j is increased to 3 = n. We proceed
through the for loop at Step 4 again. In Step 5, r is assigned the value a1a3. In Step 6, t is assigned
a1a2+a1a3. Since j = 3 = n, the for loop at Step 4 has been executed and so we return to the for loop
at Step 2 and so Step 7 is performed, where x is assigned the value 0 + a1a2 + a1a3 = a1a2 + a1a3.
We now return to the for loop at Step 2 with i = 2 = n −1. In Step 3, t is assigned 0. Since
j = 3 = n, we proceed through the for loop at Step 4. By Step 5, r is assigned a2a3 and by Step 6,
t is assigned 0 + a2a3 = a2a3. This completes the execution of the for loop at Step 4. In Step 7, x is
assigned the number a1a2 + a1a3 + a2a3. Then we proceed to Step 8, where x = a1a2 + a1a3 + a2a3
is output.

The main reason for presenting Algorithm 6.28 is so we can discuss its time complexity.
Example 6.30
Determine the time complexity of Algorithm 6.28.
Solution. For each of the n −i values of j (j = i + 1, i + 2, . . . , n), there is one multiplication in
Step 5 and one addition in Step 6. Since there are n −i values of j for each i (i = 1, 2, . . ., n −1),
there are 2(n−i) arithmetic operations for each such integer i. Thus the total number of arithmetic
operations within the for loop at Step 4 is

There is an addition in Step 7 for each i (i = 1, 2, . . . , n −1) within the for loop at Step 2. Thus the

CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
6.4
Searching and Sorting
In Algorithm 6.8, a procedure is described for determining whether a number k appears in a sequence
s : a1, a2, . . . , an. What this algorithm does is to proceed through the list term by term, beginning
with a1 and then a2 and so on until either k is found somewhere in the list or it is discovered that
k is not in the list. Because of the way this algorithm proceeds through the list searching for k,
Algorithm 6.8 is called a linear search algorithm. We saw in Example 6.26 that the worst case time
complexity of Algorithm 6.8 is Θ(n), that is, the worst case time complexity of the Linear Search
Algorithm is linear. This algorithm is repeated below for future reference.
Algorithm 6.31
(Linear Search Algorithm)
This algorithm determines whether a speciﬁed
number k appears in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Input: A positive integer n, a number k and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: k “is in the sequence” or k “is not in the sequence” as appropriate.
1. i := 1
2. while i ≤n do
begin
3.
if ai = k then output k “is in the sequence” and i := n + 1
4.
i := i + 1
end
5. if i = n + 1 then output k “is not in the sequence”
The Binary Search Algorithm
If the sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers is increasing (that is, a1 < a2 < · · · < an),
then, in the worst case, considerably fewer comparisons are needed to determine whether a given
number k appears in the sequence. A sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers is nondecreasing
if a1 ≤a2 ≤· · · ≤an. For example, if we were to search for the word traverse in a dictionary,
we would surely not start at the beginning of the dictionary and proceed word by word (or even
page by page) until locating the word. The search algorithm we are about to describe is the binary
search algorithm. The idea here is to divide the sequence into halves (approximately), selecting a
middle number in the sequence, say ap. There are then three possibilities, namely, ap = k, ap > k,
or ap < k.
(1) If ap = k, then we know that k appears in the sequence and where k appears in the sequence
and the search is complete.
(2) If ap > k, then k can only appear in the subsequence a1, a2, . . . , ap−1 of s. Thus we repeat
this procedure with the subsequence a1, a2, . . . , ap−1.
(3) If ap < k, then k can only appear in the subsequence ap+1, a2, . . . , an of s. Thus we repeat
this procedure with the subsequence ap+1, a2, . . . , an.
In the likely event that the middle number ap is not the number k, the number k (if it appears in
the sequence at all) must now appear in a sequence whose length is approximately half of that of
the original sequence. We then search for k in the smaller sequence in the same way, namely, by
dividing the smaller sequence into two halves and so on.
Algorithm 6.32
(Binary Search Algorithm) This algorithm determines whether a speciﬁed
number k is one of the numbers in an increasing sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n distinct numbers.
Input: A positive integer n, a number k and an increasing sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n
numbers.

6.4. SEARCHING AND SORTING

Output: k “is in position” p or k “is not in the sequence” as appropriate.
1. a := 1 [a represents the ﬁrst position of the sublist being considered – initially a = 1]
2. b := n [b represents the last position of the sublist being considered – initially b = n]
3. while a ≤b do
begin
4.
p := ⌊(a + b)/2⌋
5.
if ap = k then output k “is in position” p and a := b + 2
6.
if ap > k then b := p −1
7.
if ap < k then a := p + 1
8.
if a = b + 1 then output k “is not in the sequence”
end
Let’s see what the Binary Search Algorithm does in practice.
Example 6.33
Use the Binary Search Algorithm to determine whether the number 20 appears in the sequence
s : 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22.
Solution. In this case, k = 20, n = 10 and a1 = 3, a2 = 7, . . ., a10 = 22. By Steps 1 and 2, a and
b are assigned the numbers 1 and 10, respectively. Step 3 is a while loop. Since 1 = a ≤b = 10,
Steps 4 – 8 within the while loop are executed. In Step 4, p is assigned the number ⌊(1 + 10)/2⌋= 5.
Since a5 ̸= k, the conclusions of Step 5 are not performed. Since a5 = 12 > 20 is false, we move
immediately to Step 6. Because a5 = 12 < 20 = k, it follows that a is assigned the number 6.
(We will now consider the subsequence a6, a7, . . . , a10.) Since 6 = a ̸= b + 1 = 11, the conclusion
of Step 8 is not performed. Since 6 = a ≤b = 10, we continue through the while loop at Step 3
again. In Step 4, p is assigned the value ⌊(6 + 10)/2⌋= 8. In Steps 5 – 7, only 18 = a8 < k = 20 is
true and a is assigned the value 8 + 1 = 9. (We will now consider the subsequence a9, a10.) Since
9 = a ≤b = 10, we proceed through the while loop at Step 3 again. In Step 4, p is assigned the
value ⌊(9 + 10)/2⌋= 9. In Step 5, a9 = 20 = k is true, so 20 appears at position 9 is output and a
is assigned the value 10 + 2 = 12. None of the conclusions in Steps 6 – 8 are performed. Because
a ≤b is false, the steps within the while loop at Step 3 are not performed and the algorithm ends.
What the Binary Search Algorithm does to the sequence s is shown in Figure 6.4.

Figure 6.4: Applying the Binary Search Algorithm to Example 6.33
Applying the Binary Search Algorithm to our example in which we were searching for the word
traverse in the dictionary, we would begin by opening the dictionary to the middle page (or there-
abouts) and probably see that we were on a page where the words begin with L, say. We know
that traverse comes after this, so we look for the middle page in the second half of the dictionary

220
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
(possibly arriving at a page whose words begin with R). This procedure is continued until traverse
is found. If we don’t ﬁnd it, then the natural conclusion is that we don’t have a correct spelling of
it. Of course, in this dictionary example, our experience would tell us to open to a page that is later
in the dictionary. For a sequence of numbers, we wouldn’t know this, however, without additional
information. We consider another example.
Example 6.34
Use the Binary Search Algorithm to determine whether the number 10 appears in the sequence
s : 3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22.
Solution. In this case, k = 10, n = 10 and a1 = 3, a2 = 7, . . ., a10 = 22. By Steps 1 and 2, a and b
are assigned the numbers 1 and 10, respectively. Step 3 is a while loop. Since 1 = a ≤b = 10, Steps 4
– 8 are executed. In Step 4, p is assigned the number ⌊(1 + 10)/2⌋= 5. Among the Steps 5 – 7, only
a5 > k is true and so b is assigned the number 5 −1 = 4. (We will now consider the subsequence
a1, a2, a3, a4.) Since 1 = a ≤b = 4, we proceed through the while loop at Step 3 again. In Step 4, p
is assigned the value ⌊(1 + 4)/2⌋= 2. Among Steps 5 – 7, only a2 < k = 10 is true and a is assigned
the value 3. (We will now consider the subsequence a3, a4.) Since 3 = a ≤b = 4 is true, we proceed
through the while loop at Step 3 once again. At Step 4, p is assigned the value ⌊(3 + 4)/2⌋= 3. Of
the Steps 5 – 8, only a3 < k is true and a is assigned the value 3 + 1 = 4. (The subsequence under
consideration now consists of the single term a4.) Because 4 = a ≤b = 4, we proceed through the
while loop at Step 3 yet again. In Step 4, p is assigned the value ⌊(4 + 4)/2⌋= 4. Of Steps 5 – 7,
only a4 > k is true and b is assigned 4 −1 = 3. In Step 8, a = b + 1 and 10 is not in the sequence is
output. Because a ≤b is false, the steps within the while loop at Step 3 are not executed and the
algorithm ends. What the Binary Search Algorithm does to the sequence s is shown in Figure 6.5. ♦

Figure 6.5: Applying the Binary Search Algorithm to Example 6.34
Although it may appear that the number of comparisions made in the previous examples is not
an improvement over the Linear Search Algorithm (and this is true), the number of comparisions is
a major improvement if n is large.
Example 6.35
Determine the worst case time complexity of the Binary Search Algorithm.

6.4. SEARCHING AND SORTING
221
Solution. In the worst case, the number k does not appears in the sequence. Suppose ﬁrst that
the number n of terms in the sequence s is a power of 2, say n = 2j for some positive integer j.
Initially, then a = 1 and b = n = 2j. After the initial comparison is made in Step 3 (namely that
1 ≤n), a comparison is made in each of the Steps 5 – 8. Thus 5 comparisons have been made.
When we return to the while loop at Step 3, a subsequence with 2j−1 terms is being considered and
5 comparisons are made again. After j +1 passes through the while loop at Step 3, a = b+1. There
is only one additional comparison in Step 3, where a ≤b is false. Hence the number of comparisons
in the algorithm is 5(j +1)+1 = 5j +6. Since j = log n, the worst case time complexity is O(log n).
If n is not a power of 2, then n < 2j < 2n for some positive integer j and then the number of
comparisons in the algorithm is no more than
5j + 6 < 5 log(2n) + 6 = 5 log n + 5 log 2 + 6,
that is, the worst case time complexity of the Binary Search Algorithm in any case is O(log n). ♦
As we already observed, log n < n for every positive integer n and so using the Binary Search
Algorithm is more eﬃcient than using the the Linear Search Algorithm. Of course, to use the Binary
Search Algorithm we need to have numbers in the sequence s listed in increasing order (although
decreasing order is perfectly acceptable as well). Even though this is not an unusual occurrence,
there is no guarantee that the sequence under consideration has this desired property. Therefore, it
may be useful to arrange or sort the numbers in the sequence so that an increasing (or nondecreasing)
sequence results. There are many sorting algorithms. We describe three of them.
The Bubble Sort Algorithm
The ﬁrst sorting algorithm we present is called the Bubble Sort Algorithm, so named because
when this algorithm is applied to a list of numbers, given in a column, the largest numbers succes-
sively ﬂow to the bottom. When using this algorithm, it is useful at times to interchange the values
of two variables. For example, if a and b are two variables, then their values can be interchanged
by performing the following steps, where a new variable t (for temporary) is introduced for this
purpose:
t
:=
a
a
:=
b
b
:=
t
In the ﬁrst step above, t takes on the value of a so that this value is not lost in the second step,
where a takes on the value of b. The result of these three steps is referred to as the swap of a and
b, which we denote by swap(a, b).
Algorithm 6.36
(Bubble Sort Algorithm) This algorithm sorts the terms in a sequence s :
a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers so that the terms of s are reordered from smallest to largest.
Input: A positive integer n and a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.
Output: A nondecreasing sequence whose terms are those of s.
1. for j := 1 to n −1 do
2.
for i := 1 to n −j do
3.
if ai > ai+1 then swap(ai, ai+1).
4. output s
Let’s see how the Bubble Sort Algorithm works with a speciﬁc example.

222
CHAPTER 6. ALGORITHMS AND COMPLEXITY
Example 6.37
Apply the Bubble Sort Algorithm to the sequence s : 17, 8, 11, 5.
Solution. In this sequence, n = 4 and a1 = 17, a2 = 8, a3 = 11, a4 = 5. In Step 1 of Algorithm 6.36,
j is initially assigned the value 1. While j = 1, the variable i takes on the values 1, 2, 3. When i = 1,
a1 and a2 (17 and 8) are swapped; when i = 2, the current a2 and a3 (17 and 11) are swapped; and
when i = 3, the current a3 and a4 (17 and 5) are swapped. At this time, a4 is the maximum term of
s, namely 17. Then j is increased to 2 at Step 1. While j = 2, the variable i takes on the values 1
and 2. When i = 1, the current a1 and a2 (8 and 11) are not swapped; and when i = 2, the current
a2 and a3 (11 and 5) are swapped. Then j is increased to 3. Since i = 1, the current terms a1 and
a2 (8 and 5) are swapped. This completes the reordering. What the algorithm does to the sequence
s is shown in Figure 6.6.

The Insertion Sort Algorithm
Although the Bubble Sort Algorithm provides a relatively simple method for sorting the numbers
in a list, this may not be the ﬁrst algorithm one would think of if there was a sequence to sort. For
example, suppose that you had taken ten quizzes in a certain course and wanted to sort them from
lowest to highest (or highest to lowest). How might you do this? A procedure that a number of
people might use is the Insertion Sort Algorithm. Before formally stating this algorithm, we give an
example to illustrate it.
Example 6.39
Use the Insertion Sort Algorithm to sort the list s : 5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3 from smallest to largest.
Solution. We start with the second number 2 and determine whether it should precede or follow
5. Since 2 < 5, the integer 2 should precede 5. So 2 is inserted before 5. Next we look at 4 and
where it should be placed in the sequence that precedes it. Since 2 < 4 < 5, the integer 4 is inserted
between 2 and 5. We then continue in this manner. Figure 6.7 illustrates how the list changes as
we proceed through the Insertion Sort Algorithm.

Figure 6.7: Sorting a list by the Insertion Sort Algorithm
Before giving a formal statement of the Insertion Sort Algorithm, it is useful to introduce the
insertion command, which we denote by insert(aj →ai) for 1 ≤i < j ≤n and which moves the
current term aj to where the current term ai is located, with all the terms ai, ai+1, . . . , aj−1 moving
to the right one place. The terms are then relabeled, as shown in Figure 6.8.

The insertion insert(aj →ai) can be accomplished with the following steps:

for k := 1 to j −i do
aj−k+1 := aj−k
ai := t
We now state the Insertion Sort Algorithm.

s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers so that the terms are reordered from smallest to largest.

Output: A nondecreasing sequence whose terms are the terms of s.

Example 6.41
Determine the worst case time complexity of the Insertion Sort Algorithm.
Solution. For each value of i (i = 1, 2, . . . , j −1), there is a possible comparison in Step 3. Hence
there may be as many as j −1 comparisons.
Since j has the values 2, 3, . . ., n, the number of
comparisons can be as many as

The Merge Sort Algorithm
A more eﬃcient algorithm for sorting the numbers in a list is the Merge Sort Algorithm – so
named because in the process of using this algorithm, pairs of sorted lists are merged into larger
sorted lists until the ﬁnal desired sorted list has been obtained. In order to illustrate how this is
done, suppose that we wish to merge two sorted lists s1 : 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and s2 : 1, 3, 7 into a single
sorted list. This can be accomplished by comparing the ﬁrst terms of the two lists. The smaller of
these two numbers is removed from the relevant list and becomes the ﬁrst term of the desired list.
Figure 6.10 describes this in its entirety.

Figure 6.10: Merging two sorted lists
This procedure gives rise to the following theorem.
Theorem 6.43
Suppose that s1 : a1, a2, . . . , am and s2 : b1, b2, . . . , bn are two sorted lists with m
and n numbers. Then these two lists can be merged into a single sorted list using at most m + n −1
steps.
With the aid of Theorem 6.43, we can now describe the Merge Sort Algorithm. Let s be a
list of n numbers. Then 2k−1 < n ≤2k for some positive integer k. For simplicity, assume ﬁrst that
n = 2k. This list is divided into two lists, each of size 2k−1. Then each of these lists is further divided
into two lists, each of size 2k−2. We continue this until arriving at 2k lists, with one element each.
Proceeding in reverse order now, the two elements that occur in each of the 2k−1 pairs are compared
and listed in nondecreasing order. In each case, 21 −1 = 1 comparison is needed to accomplish this.
The total number of comparisons needed to do this is 2k−1(21 −1). The two pairs of two elements
that occur in each of 2k−2 sets of 22 elements are now merged into a sorted list. By Theorem 6.43,
each such merge requires at most 22 −1 = 3 comparisons. The total number of comparisons needed

6.4. SEARCHING AND SORTING
225
to do this is at most 2k−2(22 −1). Thus the total number of comparisons needed to produce a sorted
list of size n is at most
2k−1(21 −1) + 2k−2(22 −1) + · · · + 21(2k−1 −1)
=

=
k2k −(2k −1)
=
n log n −n + 1.
(See Result 5.7 in Section 5.1.) Therefore, the time complexity of the Merge Sort Algorithm is
O(n log n). If n is not a power of 2, then n < 2k < 2n for some positive integer k. Thus k <
log n + log 2 and the number of comparisons needed to sort a list of size n using the Merge Sort
Algorithm is at most
k2k −2k + 1
<
(log n + log 2)2n −n + 1
=
2n log n + (2 log 2 −1)n + 1
=
Θ(n log n).
Hence in any case, the time complexity of the Merge Sort Algorithm is O(n log n).
Example 6.44
Use the Merge Sort Algorithm to arrange the sequence s : 6, 7, 1, 4, 8, 2, 5, 3 in nondecreasing order.
Solution. The sequence s of length 8 is divided into two subsequences of length 4, namely 6, 7, 1, 4
and 8, 2, 5, 3. Each of those sequences is then divided into two subsequences of length 2. In particular,
6, 7, 1, 4 is divided into 6, 7 and 1, 4; while 8, 2, 5, 3 is divided into 8, 2 and 5, 3. Each of the four
sequences of length 2 is then divided into two subsequences of length 1. All of this is described in
the table shown in Figure 6.11.

The process is then reversed.
The ﬁrst two sequences of length 1 are merged into a sorted
sequence of length 2. This is then done with the third and fouth sequences of length 1, the ﬁfth

sequences of length 2 as shown in Figure 6.12.

Chapter 7
Integers
The branch of mathematics that is concerned with properties of the integers has traditionally been
called number theory. Since integers play such an important role in discrete mathematics, it is
essential to have an understanding of the fundamentals of number theory. This is the goal of the
current chapter.
Although number theory was a favorite topic among the ancient Greeks, it was the book Dis-
quitiones Arithmeticae in 1801 by Carl Friedrich Gauss that is considered by many as the beginning
of modern number theory. Indeed, Gauss wrote:
Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of Mathematics.
The German mathematician Leopold Kronecker (1823–1891) wrote:
God invented the integers; all else is the work of man.
Thus the importance of integers in mathematics was recognized centuries ago.
Despite the great interest in number theory by famous mathematicians, this area includes many
results and problems that can be understood by amateur mathematicians and non-mathematicians
alike. One topic of continuing interest in number theory has been prime numbers, their properties
and their distribution among the integers.
Although number theory has long been considered a rather obscure and abstract area of math-
ematics, its practical importance has only grown in recent decades because of its connections with
certain aspects of computer science. One of these connections deals with the intriguing area of
cryptography, which we will visit in this chapter.
7.1
Divisibility Properties
We have mentioned that an integer n is even if n = 2k for some integer k, that is, n is even if n can
be expressed as the product of 2 and some other integer. Integers that can or cannot be expressed
as a product of integers in certain ways are important to our study.
For integers a and b with a ̸= 0, we say that a divides b if b = ac for some integer c. If a divides
b, then we indicate this by writing a | b. Therefore, an integer n is even if and only if 2 | n. If a | b,
then a is called a factor or a divisor of b and b is called a multiple of a. Therefore, if n is even,
then 2 is a divisor of n and n is a multiple of 2. If a does not divide b, then we write a ∤b. For
any two given integers a and b, a | b is a statement. For example, 12 | 52 is a false statement; while
12 | 72 is a true statement. The statement 12 | 72 has no numerical value, although 72/12 = 6 of
course. There is a major diﬀerence between the meaning of a vertical line and a slanted line.

CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
Example 7.1
Determine which of the following statements are true:
(a) 3 | 12,
(b) −7 | 14,
(c) 5 | 0,
(d) 8 | 20,
(e) 0 | 0.
Solution. Since 12 = 3 · 4, it follows that 3 | 12. Also, −7 | 14 and 5 | 0 as 14 = (−7)(−2) and
0 = 5 · 0. However, 8 ∤20 since there is no integer c such that 20 = 8c. Writing 0 | 0 has no meaning
since a ̸= 0 in the deﬁnition of a | b. In summary, (a)–(c) are true; while (d) and (e) are false, but
for diﬀerent reasons.
♦
There are several useful divisibility properties of integers. We now state and prove some of the
most fundamental of these. Before doing this, however, there is an important fact that should be
emphasized. If a and b are integers with a ̸= 0 and we wish to show that a | b, then what we are
required to show is that b can be written in a certain manner. In particular, we need to show that
there is some integer c such that b = ac. The proofs of these kinds of results are generally direct
proofs.
Theorem to Prove: Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c).
Proof Strategy. In a direct proof of this theorem, we begin by assuming that a | b and a | c.
This means that there are integers r and s such that b = ar and c = as. Since we want to show
that a | (b + c), we are required to show that b + c can be expressed as the product of a and some
integer. This suggests considering the integer b + c. Substituting the expressions ar and as for b
and c, respectively, leads us to a proof.
♦
Theorem 7.2
Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | b and a | c, then a | (b + c).
Proof. Assume that a | b and a | c. Hence b = ar and c = as for some integers r and s. Therefore,
b + c = ar + as = a(r + s).
Since r + s is an integer, a | (b + c).
A similar proof can be given of the next theorem.
Theorem 7.3
Let a and b be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | b, then a | bx for every integer x.
Proof. Assume that a | b. Then b = ar for some integer r. Then
bx = (ar)x = a(rx).
Since rx is an integer, a | bx.
We now look at an even more general result.
Theorem 7.4
Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | b and a | c, then a | (bx + cy) for every
two integers x and y.
Proof. Assume that a | b and a | c. Then b = ar and c = as for some integers r and s. Then
bx + cy = (ar)x + (as)y = a(rx) + a(sy) = a(rx + sy).
Since rx + sy is an integer, a | (bx + cy).
Note that if y = 0 in Theorem 7.4, then we obtain Theorem 7.3; while if we let x = 1 and y = 1
in Theorem 7.4, then we obtain Theorem 7.2. For this reason, Theorem 7.4 is a more general result,
and Theorems 7.2 and 7.3 are both corollaries of Theorem 7.4. The next theorem gives another
divisibility property of integers.
Theorem 7.5
Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.

7.1. DIVISIBILITY PROPERTIES
233
Proof. Assume that a | b and b | c. Then b = ar and c = bs for some integers r and s. Therefore,
c = bs = (ar)s = a(rs).
Since rs is an integer, a | c.
We now turn to some examples involving divisors of integers and see how mathematical induction
can be applied to verify certain divisibility properties. Recall that
(a + b)3 = a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3.
Result to Prove: For every nonnegative integer n,
3 |

Proof Strategy. Since we have decided to prove this result by induction and the statement deals
with nonnegative integers n, our ﬁrst step (the basis step) is to show (or simply observe) that
3 | (03 −0). To verify the inductive step, we assume that 3 |

integer ℓ. Our goal is to show that we can express (k + 1)3 −(k + 1) as the product of 3 and an
integer.
♦
Result 7.6 For every nonnegative integer n,

Proof. We proceed by induction. Since 3 | (03 −0), the statement is true for n = 0. Assume that
3 |
 k3 −k

, where k is a nonnegative integer. Then k3 −k = 3ℓfor some integer ℓ. We show that
3 divides (k + 1)3 −(k + 1). Observe that
(k + 1)3 −(k + 1)
=
k3 + 3k2 + 3k + 1 −k −1 = (k3 −k) + 3k2 + 3k
=
3ℓ+ 3k2 + 3k = 3(ℓ+ k2 + k).
Since ℓ+k2+k is an integer, 3 divides (k+1)3−(k+1). By the Principle of Mathematical Induction,

. Observe that
5k+1 −1 = 5 · 5k −1 = 5(4ℓ+ 1) −1 = 20ℓ+ 4 = 4(5ℓ+ 1).
Since 5ℓ+ 1 is an integer, 4 |

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
One of the most important properties of primes lies in the following famous theorem. After
developing some properties of primes, we will present a proof of this theorem in Section 7.6.
Theorem 7.9
(The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
Every integer n ≥2 is either
prime or can be expressed as a product of (not necessarily distinct) primes, that is,
n = p1p2 · · · pk,
where p1, p2, . . . , pk are primes. This factorization is unique except possibly for the order in which
the primes appear.
Let’s look at some illustrations of Theorem 7.9.
Example 7.10
Express the following integers as products of primes.
(a) 30.
(b) 12.
(c) 100.
(d) 54.
(e) 605.
(f) 216.
Solution.
(a) 30 = 2 · 3 · 5.
(b) 12 = 2 · 2 · 3 = 22 · 3.
(c) 100 = 2 · 2 · 5 · 5 = 22 · 52.
(d) 54 = 2 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 2 · 33.
(e) 605 = 5 · 11 · 11 = 5 · 112.
(f) 216 = 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 3 · 3 = 23 · 33.
♦
There are some instances when one can tell rather quickly whether a certain prime p divides an
integer n. This is probably the case with the integers in Example 7.10. As we have noted, 2 divides
n if and only if n is even. Of course, it is easy to determine whether an integer n is even: the last
digit of n must be even. Actually, 4 = 22 divides n if and only if 4 divides the number formed from
the last two digits of n and so on. For example, 4 | 3212 because 4 | 12, but 8 ∤3212 since 8 ∤212.
The prime 3 divides an integer n if and only if 3 divides the sum of the digits of n. For example,
3 | 5241 since 3 | (5 + 2 + 4 + 1). The same is true of 9 = 32, that is, 9 divides n if and only if 9
divides the sum of the digits of n. Since 9 ∤(5 + 2 + 4 + 1), it follows that 9 ∤5241. On the other
hand, 9 | 747. This property does not hold for 27 = 33, however; for example, certainly 27 | 27 but
27 ∤(2 + 7).

236
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
It is easy to determine whether the prime 5 divides an integer n, as all we need to do is to check
whether the last digit of n is 5 or 0. While there is no simple way to determine whether 7 divides
an integer n, there is a method for determining whether 11 divides an integer n. If we were to add
alternating digits of n, getting a say and then add the remaining digits, obtaining b, then 11 | n if
and only if 11 | (a −b). For example, suppose that n = 8, 241, 739. Then a = 8 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 28 and
b = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6. Since 11 | (28 −6), it follows that 11 | 8, 241, 739.
Example 7.11
Express n = 33, 660 as a product of primes.
Solution. There are several ways one might proceed to write 33, 660 as a product of primes but
using some of the facts mentioned above, we ﬁnd that 33, 660 = 22 · 32 · 5 · 11 · 17.

Deﬁnition 7.12

composite).

If n is a composite number, it then follows that there is an integer a with 1 < a < n such that
a | n. Therefore, there exists an integer b such that n = ab. Necessarily, 1 < b < n as well. This is
summarized in the next result.
Theorem 7.13
An integer n ≥2 is composite if and only if there exist integers a and b with
1 < a < n and 1 < b < n such that n = ab.
There is an interesting consequence of this theorem.
Corollary to Prove:
If n is a composite number, then n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n.
Proof Strategy.
If we use a direct proof, then we begin with a composite number n. Our goal is
to show that n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n. Because n is a composite number, it follows
from Theorem 7.13 that n can be expressed as the product ab of integers such that 1 < a < n and
1 < b < n. By Theorem 7.9 each of a and b can be expressed as a product of primes and so there is
a prime that divides a and a prime that divides b. Certainly, one of a and b is less than or equal to
the other, say a ≤b. Also, let p be a prime that divides a. Then
n = ab ≥a · a = a2 and so √n ≥a.
Since p | a, it follows that p | n and that p ≤a ≤√n. This gives us what we want.
♦
Corollary 7.14
If n is a composite number, then n has a prime factor p such that p ≤√n.
Proof. Let n be a composite number. By Theorem 7.13, there are integers a and b with 1 < a < n
and 1 < b < n such that n = ab. Suppose that a ≤b. Then a · a = a2 ≤ab = n and so a ≤√n.
Since a ≥2, it follows by Theorem 7.9 that there is a prime p such that p | a and so p ≤a ≤√n.
By Theorem 7.3, p | ab and so p | n.
Corollary 7.14 can be useful to determine whether a given integer is a prime.
Example 7.15
Show that 103 is a prime.
Solution. If 103 is not a prime, then 103 is composite and by Corollary 7.14 has a prime factor that
is not greater than
√
103. Since 10 <
√
103 < 11, we need only determine whether any prime less

7.2. PRIMES
237
than 11 is a factor of 103. However, since none of 2, 3, 5, 7 is a factor of 103, it follows that 103 is
a prime.
♦
There Are Inﬁnitely Many Primes
It probably comes as no surprise that there are inﬁnitely many primes.
Theorem to Prove: There are inﬁnitely many primes.
Proof Strategy. Since “inﬁnite” means “not ﬁnite,” it is natural to attempt a proof of this theorem
by contradiction. So we assume that there are not inﬁnitely many primes. This means that there is
only a ﬁnite number of primes, say p1, p2, . . . , pk for some positive integer k. Our goal is to produce a
contradiction. We need to contradict some deﬁnition, some assumption or some theorem. According
to Theorem 7.9, if we have any integer a ≥2, then some prime must divide a. However, from our
assumption, the only primes are p1, p2, . . . , pk. So at least one of these primes must divide a. If we
can construct an integer n ≥2 such that none of p1, p2, . . . , pk divides n, then a contradiction has
been produced. One idea is to consider n = p1p2 · · · pk + 1.
♦
Theorem 7.16
There are inﬁnitely many primes.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there are ﬁnitely many primes, say p1, p2, . . . , pk. Let
n = p1p2 · · · pk + 1.
Since n is greater than each prime, n must be composite. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arith-
metic, at least one of the primes p1, p2, . . . , pk must divide n, say pj | n. Thus n = pjr for some
integer r. Hence
pjr = n = p1p2 · · · pk + 1 = p1p2 · · · pj−1pjpj+1 · · · pk + 1.
Therefore,
1 = pj(r −p1p2 · · · pj−1pj+1 · · · pk).
Since r −p1p2 · · · pj−1pj+1 · · · pk is an integer, pj | 1. However, pj ≥2 and this is impossible.
Actually it’s been known for a long time (a very long time) that there are inﬁnitely many primes.
Over 2300 years ago, the famous mathematician Euclid, well known for his contributions to geometry,
proved that there are inﬁnitely many primes. Primes have fascinated people, mathematicians and
non-mathematicians alike, for centuries. Many have not been satisﬁed to know only that there are
inﬁnitely many primes, however.
For a given positive integer n, how many primes are there less than n? If n is relatively small,
then it is not too diﬃcult to answer this question. But as anyone would probably guess, this question
becomes increasingly diﬃcult to answer the larger that n becomes. It is common to let π(n) denote
the number of primes that are less than n.
So π(2) = 0, π(3) = 1, π(5) = 2, π(10) = 4 and
π(100) = 25. In fact, Figure 7.1 gives the value of π(n) for a few positive integers n.

CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
Looking at the values of π(n) for the positive integers n in Figure 7.1 certainly makes one think
that there is no formula for π(n) in terms of n – at least no simple formula, at least no familiar
formula. But could it be that π(n) is “close” to something familiar? This is a subject that intrigued
many famous mathematicians and led to a theorem known as the Prime Number Theorem.
Theorem 7.17
(The Prime Number Theorem) The number π(n) is approximately equal to
n/ ln n. More precisely,
limn→∞
π(n)
n/ ln n = 1.
In 1798 the famous French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre made the ﬁrst conjecture
(guess) of this theorem. Carl Friedrich Gauss also was thinking along the right lines in the mid-
1800s. The Russian mathematician Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev made the ﬁrst progress towards
a proof. The ﬁrst proof occurred however in 1896 when Jaques Salomon Hadamard and Charles
de la Vall´ee Poussin independently proved the theorem. Their proofs used the calculus of complex
numbers. The ﬁrst proof to avoid this approach was given in 1949 independently by Atle Selberg
and Paul Erd˝os.
Since there are inﬁnitely many primes, there is surely no largest prime. But what is an example
of a “large” prime? A more interesting question probably is: What is the largest known prime?
This is a question whose answer changes often. The number 243,112,609 −1 was shown to be prime in
September 2008 by a team at UCLA. Writing out this number requires nearly 13 million digits. Since
this was the ﬁrst prime discovered with at least 10 million digits, this team was awarded $100,000
by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. (There is a prize of $150,000 for the ﬁrst prime with 100
million digits and a prize of $250,000 for the ﬁrst prime with one billion digits.)
Unsolved Problems Involving Primes
There is a host of unanswered questions concerning prime numbers. We mention just a few of
these.
(1) Two positive integers p and p+2 are called twin primes if they are both primes. For example,
the following are twin primes:
{3, 5}, {5, 7}, {11, 13}, {17, 19}, {29, 31}.
In addition,
p = 16, 869, 987, 339, 975 · 2171,960 −1 and p + 2 = 16, 869, 987, 339, 975· 2171,960 + 1
are twin primes.
The Twin Primes Conjecture There are inﬁnitely many twin primes.
(2) Observe that 4 = 2+2, 6 = 3+3, 8 = 3+5, 10 = 3+7 = 5+5, 12 = 5+7 and 14 = 3+11 = 7+7.
The following conjecture appeared in a letter written to Leonhard Euler by Christian Goldbach
in 1742.
Goldbach’s Conjecture Every even integer that is 4 or more can be expressed as the sum
of two primes.
(3) Observe that the following Fibonacci numbers are primes: 2, 3, 5, 13. Are there inﬁnitely
many prime Fibonacci numbers?
(4) For every integer n with 1 ≤n ≤40, the polynomial n2 −n+41 produces a prime. For n = 41,
however, n2 −n + 41 = 412 −41 + 41 = 412, which, of course, is composite. It is known,
though, that no polynomial expression with integer coeﬃcients produces only primes.

7.2. PRIMES
239
In 2008, Eric Rowland discovered a recursively deﬁned sequence, every value of which is
either 1 or a prime. Deﬁne the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . by a1 = 7 and an = an−1 +gcd(n, an−1).
The ﬁrst 13 terms of this sequence are
7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 33, 36, 37.
Now deﬁne the sequence p1, p2, p3, . . . by
pn = an+1 −an for n ≥1.
The ﬁrst 12 terms of this sequence are
1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 11, 3, 1.
Therefore, the sequence p1, p2, p3, . . . can repeat a prime. Does every odd prime appear in this
sequence?

7.3
The Division Algorithm
Although the word divides has been introduced as a technical term, we are far more familiar with the
phrase divided by. For example, when 16 is divided by 5, we obtain a quotient of 3 and a remainder
of 1. This is described in a theorem called the Division Algorithm.
Theorem 7.18
(The Division Algorithm) For every two integers m and n > 0, there exist
unique integers q and r such that
m = nq + r, where 0 ≤r < n.
The integer q in Theorem 7.18 represents the quotient obtained when m is divided by n and r
represents the remainder, which is one of the n integers 0, 1, . . ., n−1. Hence if m = 16 and n = 5,
then q = 3 and r = 1 and 16 = 5 · 3 + 1. When m is not positive, however, the resulting quotient
and remainder may not be what one initially expects.
Example 7.19
For each of the following pairs m, n of integers, ﬁnd the quotient q and remainder r when m is
divided by n. Then write m = nq + r.
(a) m = 58, n = 7. (b) m = 0, n = 7. (c) m = −58, n = 7. (d) m = 21, n = 7.
Solution.
(a) q = 8, r = 2, 58 = 7 · 8 + 2.
(b) q = 0, r = 0, 0 = 7 · 0 + 0.
(c) q = −9, r = 5, −58 = 7 · (−9) + 5.
(d) q = 3, r = 0, 21 = 7 · 3 + 0.
♦
In Examples 7.19(b) and 7.19(d), the remainder r = 0. In particular, 0 = 7 · 0 and 21 = 7 · 3 and
so 7 | 0 and 7 | 21. That is, for two integers m and n with n > 0, writing m = nq + 0 is the same
as saying that n | m. Therefore, we have the following:
If m = nq + r and 1 ≤r ≤n −1, then n ∤m.
In general, the quotient q, obtained when m is divided by n, is ⌊m/n⌋while the remainder r is
m −n⌊m/n⌋; that is:

7.3. THE DIVISION ALGORITHM
241
If m = nq + r, where 0 ≤r < n, then
q =
jm

k
and
r = m −n
jm

.
Example 7.20
For each of the following pairs m, n of integers, determine ⌊m/n⌋and m −n⌊m/n⌋.
(a) m = 18, n = 7. (b) m = 0, n = 7. (c) m = −18, n = 7.
Solution.
(a) ⌊m/n⌋= ⌊18/7⌋= 2 and m −n⌊m/n⌋= 18 −7 · 2 = 4.
(b) ⌊m/n⌋= ⌊0/7⌋= 0 and m −n⌊m/n⌋= 0 −7 · 0 = 0.
(c) ⌊m/n⌋= ⌊−18/7⌋= −3 and m −n⌊m/n⌋= −18 −7 · (−3) = 3.
♦
Of course, what is being computed for integers m and n ≥1 in Example 7.20 are the quotient
q = ⌊m/n⌋and remainder r = m −n⌊m/n⌋when m is divided by n. Some calculators contain
built-in integer functions that provide us with q and r for given integers m and n > 0. At times,
these are indicated by div and mod, respectively. That is, if m = nq + r, where 0 ≤r < n, then
m div n = q
and
m mod n = r.
The integer function mod is especially useful.
Example 7.21
Determine m div n and m mod n for each of the following pairs m, n of integers.
(a) m = 75, n = 13. (b) m = 84, n = 14. (c) m = −37, n = 5.
Solution.
(a) 75 div 13 = 5 and 75 mod 13 = 10.
(b) 84 div 14 = 6 and 84 mod 14 = 0.
(c) −37 div 5 = −8 and −37 mod 5 = 3.
♦
If we take n = 2, then Theorem 7.18 tells us that every integer m can be written as 2q + r for
some integers q and r, where 0 ≤r ≤1, that is, either m = 2q (and m is even) or m = 2q + 1 (and
m is odd). For n = 3, we see that every integer m can be written as 3q, 3q + 1 or 3q + 2 for some
integer q.
Just as certain theorems concerning an integer n can be conveniently proved by dividing the
proof into two cases, namely n is even or n is odd, a proof by cases may be appropriate according
to the remainder obtained when n is divided by some integer. We consider such an example.
Theorem to Prove: Let n be an integer. Then 3 | n2 if and only if 3 | n.
Proof Strategy.
Because the statement is a bicondictional, there are two implications to verify,
namely
(1) 3 | n2 if 3 | n (or if 3 | n, then 3 | n2) and
(2) 3 | n2 only if 3 | n (or if 3 | n2, then 3 | n).

242
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
The ﬁrst of these is straighforward and can be proved with a direct proof. It therefore remains to
prove that 3 | n2 only if 3 | n. This implication can also be expressed as: if 3 | n2, then 3 | n. It
is natural to give a proof by contrapositive of this implication, namely, to show that if 3 ∤n, then
3 ∤n2.
Thus we assume that 3 ∤n. Our goal is to show that 3 ∤n2. By the Division Algorithm, we
can write n = 3q + r, where 0 ≤r ≤2. Because 3 ∤n, it follows that r ̸= 0. Hence n = 3q + 1 or
n = 3q + 2. This suggests a proof by cases.
If n = 3q + 1, then
n2 = (3q + 1)2 = 9q2 + 6q + 1 = 3(3q2 + 2q) + 1.
Since 3q2 + 2q is an integer, 3q2 + 2q is the quotient and 1 is the remainder when n2 is divided by
3. So 3 ∤n2. The situation is similar when n = 3q + 2.
♦
Theorem 7.22
Let n be an integer. Then 3 | n2 if and only if 3 | n.
Proof. First, we prove that if 3 | n, then 3 | n2. Assume that 3 | n. Then n = 3k for some integer
k and so
n2 = (3k)2 = 9k2 = 3(3k2).
Since 3k2 is an integer, 3 | n2.
We now prove that if 3 | n2, then 3 | n. Assume that 3 ∤n. Then n has a remainder of 1 or 2
when divided by 3. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. n = 3q + 1 for some integer q. Therefore,
n2 = (3q + 1)2 = 9q2 + 6q + 1 = 3(3q2 + 2q) + 1.
Since 3q2 + 2q is an integer, n2 has a remainder 1 when divided by 3 and so 3 ∤n2.
Case 2. n = 3q + 2 for some integer q. Therefore,
n2 = (3q + 2)2 = 9q2 + 12q + 4 = 3(3q2 + 4q + 1) + 1.
Since 3q2 + 4q + 1 is an integer, n2 has a remainder 1 when divided by 3 and so 3 ∤n2.

Congruence
We have often expressed an interest in two integers a and b that are of the same parity. Recall that
this means that a and b are both even or both odd. If a and b are both even, then both have a
remainder of 0 when divided by 2; while if a and b are both odd, then both have a remainder of 1
when divided by 2. More generality, for an integer n ≥2, we will often be interested in integers that
have the same remainder when divided by n. This is the topic of the current section. We begin with
a deﬁnition that leads us to this discussion.

244
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
Deﬁnition 7.23
For integers a, b and n ≥2, the integer a is congruent to b modulo n if
n | (a −b).
To indicate that a is congruent to b modulo n, we write a ≡b (mod n). If a is not congruent
to b modulo n, then we write a ̸≡b (mod n). We have now seen that the notation “mod” has two
meanings in mathematics. When mod is expressed in bold such as in m mod n, it indicates the
remainder when m is divided by n. We now see some examples of integers a, b and n ≥2, where
a ≡b (mod n) or a ̸≡b (mod n).
Example 7.24
(a) 24 ≡14 (mod 5) since 5 | (24 −14).
(b) −7 ≡9 (mod 8) since 8 | ((−7) −9).
(c) 12 ≡12 (mod 9) since 9 | (12 −12).
(d) 34 ̸≡16 (mod 12) since 12 ∤(34 −16).
♦
The following theorem provides a convenient way to determine whether an integer a is congruent
to b modulo n.
Theorem 7.25 Let a, b and n ≥2 be integers. Then a ≡b (mod n) if and only if a = b + kn for
some integer k.
Proof. First, we prove that if a ≡b (mod n), then a = b + kn for some integer k. Assume that
a ≡b (mod n). Hence n | (a −b). Thus there exists an integer k such that a −b = nk and so
a = b + kn.
We now turn to the converse and prove that if a = b+kn for some integer k, then a ≡b (mod n).
Assume that a = b + kn for some integer k. Then a −b = kn. Since k is an integer, n | (a −b) and
so a ≡b (mod n).
The next theorem gives us yet another useful way to determine whether an integer a is congruent
to b modulo n.
Theorem 7.26
Let a, b and n ≥2 be integers. Then a ≡b (mod n) if and only if a and b have
the same remainder when divided by n.
Proof. First, we prove that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by n, then a ≡
b (mod n). Assume that both a and b have the remainder r when divided by n. Then a = nq1 + r
and b = nq2 + r for integers q1 and q2. Therefore,
a −b = (nq1 + r) −(nq2 + r) = n(q1 −q2).
Since q1 −q2 is an integer, n | (a −b) and so a ≡b (mod n).
Next, we show that if a ≡b (mod n), then a and b have the same remainder when divided by n.
Assume that a ≡b (mod n). Then a = b + kn for some integer k by Theorem 7.25. Suppose that
a = nq1 + r1 and b = nq2 + r2 for integers q1, r1, q2, r2, where 0 ≤r1 ≤n −1 and 0 ≤r2 ≤n −1.
We may assume that r1 ≥r2. Then
kn = a −b = (nq1 + r1) −(nq2 + r2) = n(q1 −q2) + (r1 −r2).
Therefore,
r1 −r2 = kn −n(q1 −q2) = n(k −q1 + q2).
Since k −q1 + q2 is an integer, it follows that n | (r1 −r2). However,
0 ≤r1 −r2 ≤n −1.

7.4. CONGRUENCE
245
Because n | (r1 −r2), we must have r1 −r2 = 0 and so r1 = r2.
Another way to state Theorem 7.26 is as follows:
Corollary 7.27
Let a, b and n ≥2 be integers. Then a ≡b (mod n) if and only if
a mod n = b mod n.
Example 7.28
For each of the following pairs a, b of integers and an integer n ≥2, compute a mod n and b mod n
and use this to determine whether a ≡b (mod n).
(a) a = 17, b = −11, n = 7. (b) a = 30, b = 10, n = 15.
Solution.
(a) Since a mod n = 17 mod 7 = 3 and b mod n = −11 mod 7 = 3, it follows by Corollary 7.27
that 17 ≡−11 (mod 7).
(b) Since a mod n = 30 mod 15 = 0 and b mod n = 10 mod 15 = 10, it follows by Corollary 7.27
that 30 ̸≡10 (mod 15).

Introduction to Cryptography
A modern day use of integers and congruences occurs in the area of cryptography.
The word
cryptography comes from the two Greek words Kryptos (meaning “hidden”) and graphein (meaning
“to write”). (Perhaps you recall that the imaginary element kryptonite, against which Superman is
defenseless.) Formally, cryptography is the study of sending and receiving secret messages. The
related term cryptology is the study of systems, called cryptosystems, for secure communications.
Cryptography is also used to express the act of writing in codes and cryptology is the science of
analyzing and deciphering codes.
In a cryptosystem, the sender of a message (written in plaintext) ﬁrst transforms the message
(into ciphertext) before transmitting it so that only individuals authorized to do so will be able to
reconstruct the original message. Encryption is the process of transforming the original message
into a disguised message, while decryption is the process of transforming the disguised message (in
ciphertext) back to the original message (in plaintext).
The goal is to have a secure cryptosystem so that even if unauthorized individuals read a disguised
message, they are unable to discover the decryption technique that will allow them to obtain the
original message. Cryptosystems are essential for certain organizations such as governments, the
military and internet-based businesses. In particular, if a business transaction were to take place
over the internet during which a credit card number is sent, then it is critical that this information
can be read only by those for whom it is intended. The same concern exists if ﬁnancial or other
private information were to be transmitted over the internet.
Cryptography is used when an individual wants to send a secret message to someone else, where
there is a possibility that some third individual might intervene and read the message. It has been
used by generals to send orders to their armies. Perhaps the best known example of this was the
Enigma machine, an encryption machine invented and used during World War II to send military
messages. Several books and motion pictures have dealt with this subject.

7.5. INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY
247
In one of the oldest and simplest cryptosystems, the sender and receiver possess a “key” that
provides a substitute character for each character that could be contained in any message to be
transmitted. Such a key is called a private key. A simple example of a cryptosystem deals with
identifying each letter of the English alphabet by an integer from 0 to 25 as shown in Figure 7.2.

Figure 7.2: An example of a cryptosystem
Julius Caesar was known to have used this method to send secret messages to his generals. What
he did was to replace each letter in a message, corresponding to the integer x, say, where 0 ≤x ≤25,
by the letter corresponding to the integer f(x), where
f(x) = (x + 3) mod 26.
That is, each integer was replaced by rotating the letter 3 units to the right. For example, the
message
SEE YOU IN ROME.
would be transformed to
VHH BRX LQ URPH.
Of course, the intended individual receiving the message would have to transform (decrypt) the
message back to its original plaintext in which a letter in the disguised message corresponding to an
integer x is then replaced by the letter corresponding to
f −1(x) = (x −3) mod 26.
In the Caesar shift decryption technique, each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter
obtained by rotating the letter a ﬁxed number of positions. So a rotation of 3 units to the right is the
actual Caesar shift used by Julius Caesar himself. In the Caesar shift employed by Caesar, it is very
diﬃcult to ﬁnd English words in plaintext that are transformed into English words in ciphertext.
Thus it would be clear quite quickly that a secret message had been sent by this method. The
Caesar shift obtained by rotating the letter one unit to the left could be described mathematically
by the function
g(x) = (x −1) mod 26.
In this case,
IBM would be transformed into HAL.
(This might remind you of the motion picture 2001: A Space Odyssey.)
While Caesar’s use of this scheme appears to be the ﬁrst recorded use, other substitution codes
have been known to be used earlier. It is not known how successful Caesar’s scheme was, as this
code does not appear diﬃcult to break.
Sending and decoding secret messages has been popular among youngsters for decades. So-called
“secret decoder” toys have been enclosed in boxes of breakfast cereals and snack foods as far back
as the 1930s. The best known decoders were badges given to children by manufacturers of Ovaltine
(a chocolatey drink whose name is an anagram for “Vital One”), which sponsored the Little Orphan
Annie radio show and the Captain Midnight radio and television shows. Decoder badges appeared
in a scene from the popular holiday movie A Christmas Story.

248
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
The methods we described for encrypting messages are based on congruences. Words (strings of
characters) are transformed into numbers. The numbers are then transformed into other numbers
which are then transformed back into strings of characters. These methods are examples of what
we call private key cryptosystems. Knowledge of the encryption key allows one to ﬁnd the (inverse)
decryption key rather easily. For example, when a Caesar shift is used with encryption key k, an
integer x representing a letter is sent to the letter represented by the integer
y = (x + k) mod 26.
Decryption is then accomplished by a shift of −k, that is,
x = (y −k) mod 26.
Example 7.29
A secret message in ciphertext of a plaintext message using the Caesar shift deﬁned by f(x) =
(x −6) mod 26 is
KOCT
NIXUS.
What is the original message in plaintext?
Solution. In this case, decryption is deﬁned according to
f −1(x) = (x + 6) mod 26.

Therefore, the original message in plaintex is
YES, ANN.
(Curiously, ANN is transformed into ANN in this case.)
♦
When a private key cryptosystem is used, two individuals who wish to communicate in secret
have the same private key. This key can both encrypt and decrypt messages. In the mid-1970s the
idea of a public key cryptosystem was introduced. In this case, there are two keys – a public
encryption key and private decryption key.
While any one with an encryption key can send a
disguised message to some person, having such a key should not help you to decrypt a disguised
message that has been sent to this person.
The decryption keys are kept private and only the
intended recipient knows how to decrypt the message.
In 1976 Richard Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman (all researchers at MIT during the
time) introduced a public key cryptosystem, which has since become known as the RSA System
(for the initials of the three inventors), based on the idea that it is very easy for computers to
determine the product of two very large primes but very diﬃcult, even for a computer, to factor an
integer that is the product of two very large primes.

Greatest Common Divisors
We now turn our attention from one integer dividing another to one integer dividing two others.
Deﬁnition 7.31
Let a, b and d be integers, where a and b are not both 0 and d ̸= 0. The integer d
is a common divisor of a and b if d | a and d | b.
Example 7.32
The common divisors of 8 and 20 are −4, −2, −1, 1, 2 and 4.
♦
The concept that has attracted the most attention in this connection is the greatest common
divisor.
Deﬁnition 7.33 For integers a and b not both 0, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the
greatest positive integer that is a common divisor of a and b. This number is denoted by gcd(a, b).
By Example 7.32, gcd(8, 20) = 4. If two integers a and b are not very large, then ﬁnding gcd(a, b)
can be accomplished by observation.
Example 7.34
Determine by observation the greatest common divisor of each of the following pairs a, b of integers.
(a) a = 15, b = 25. (b) a = 30, b = 42. (c) a = 15, b = 17.
(d) a = −14, b = −18. (e) a = 0, b = 6. (f) a = 16, b = 80.
Solution.
(a) gcd(15, 25) = 5. (b) gcd(30, 42) = 6. (c) gcd(15, 17) = 1.
(d) gcd(−14, −18) = 2. (e) gcd(0, 6) = 6. (f) gcd(16, 80) = 16.
♦
Example 7.34 illustrates a number of facts concerning the greatest common divisor of two integers.
First, the value of gcd(a, b) is not aﬀected by the sign of a or b, that is, gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|).
Consequently, we may assume that a and b are both nonnegative. Second, if one of a and b is 0, say
b = 0, then a > 0 and gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, 0) = a. Hence when determining gcd(a, b), we may assume
that a and b are both positive, where 0 < a ≤b say. Also, if a | b, then gcd(a, b) = a. We summarize
these facts about the greatest common divisor of two integers a and b:
(1) gcd(a, b) = gcd(|a|, |b|),
(2) gcd(a, 0) = |a| and
(3) if a, b ̸= 0 and a | b, then gcd(a, b) = |a|.

7.6. GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS
251
The Euclidean Algorithm
As we mentioned, what makes gcd(a, b) easy to compute for the various pairs a, b of integers in
Example 7.34 is that the numbers are relatively small. But what if they are not small? There are a
couple of ways to proceed in this case. One of these methods makes use of a technique credited to
Euclid. Before describing this method, we ﬁrst present a useful theorem that involves the Division
Algorithm.
Theorem to Prove:
Let a and b be two positive integers. If b = aq + r for some integers q and r,
then
gcd(a, b) = gcd(r, a).
Proof Strategy.
What this theorem states is that the greatest common divisor of a pair a, b of
positive integers is the greatest common divisor of another pair r, a of integers if b can be expressed
as aq + r for some integer q. Since we are interested in showing gcd(a, b) and gcd(r, a) are equal,
this suggests introducing separate symbols for these two numbers, say
d = gcd(a, b) and e = gcd(r, a),
and then showing that d = e.
Since d = gcd(a, b), we know that d | a and d | b; while since
e = gcd(r, a), we know that e | r and e | a. Because b = aq + r, we can write r = b −aq. Since d | a
and d | b, it is not diﬃcult to show that d | r. So now we know that d | r and d | a, that is, d is a
common divisor of r and a. However, e is the greatest common divisor of r and a, which says that
d ≤e. Starting with e = gcd(r, a) and showing that e | b as well will allow us to show that e ≤d,
giving us the desired result.
♦
Theorem 7.35
Let a and b be two positive integers. If b = aq + r for some integers q and r, then
gcd(a, b) = gcd(r, a).
Proof. Suppose that gcd(a, b) = d and gcd(r, a) = e. We show that d = e. Since d = gcd(a, b), it
follows that d | a and d | b. So a = ds and b = dt for integers s and t. Therefore,
r = b −aq = dt −(ds)q = d(t −sq).
Since t −sq is an integer, d | r. Thus d | r and d | a. Because e is the largest integer that is a
common divisor of r and a, it follows that d ≤e.
Also, because e = gcd(r, a) is a common divisor of r and a, it follows that e | r and e | a and so
r = ex and a = ey for integers x and y. Hence
b = aq + r = (ey)q + ex = e(yq + x).
Since yq + x is an integer, e | b. So e | a and e | b. However, because d is the greatest common
divisor of a and b, it follows that e ≤d.
Since d ≤e and e ≤d, we conclude that d = e, that is, gcd(a, b) = gcd(r, a).
Let’s see how Theorem 7.35 can be used to determine gcd(a, b) for two positive integers a and b.
We may assume that a < b. Although Theorem 7.35 does not require that q and r be the quotient
and the remainder, respectively, when b is divided by a, it does say that if this is the case, then
gcd(a, b) = gcd(r, a), where 0 ≤r < a < b.
If r = 0, then a | b and gcd(a, b) = gcd(0, a) = a. Suppose then that r ̸= 0. In this case, we apply
Theorem 7.35 again, where this time a is divided by r, obtaining the remainder r1. Then
gcd(r, a) = gcd(r1, r), where 0 ≤r1 < r < a < b.

252
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
Continuing in this manner, we eventually arrive at the last nonzero remainder rk and so
gcd(a, b) = gcd(r, a) = gcd(r1, r) = gcd(r2, r1) = · · · = gcd(rk, rk−1) = gcd(0, rk) = rk.
That is, the greatest common divisor of a and b is the last nonzero remainder obtained when the
sequence of divisions described above are performed. This method for determining gcd(a, b) is called
the Euclidean Algorithm. Let’s see how this works with a speciﬁc example.
Example 7.36
Use the Euclidean Algorithm to determine gcd(384, 477).
Solution. For given integers m and n > 0, we have seen that the remainder r, obtained when m is
divided by n, is m mod n. Since
477 mod 384
=
93
384 mod 93
=
12
93 mod 12
=
9
12 mod 9
=
3
9 mod 3
=
0,
it follows that gcd(477, 384) = 3.
♦
Actually, many calculators have an integer-valued function that determines gcd(a, b) directly, but
Theorem 7.35 and the resulting Euclidean Algorithm give us an explanation as to why this method
works.
We mentioned that there is more than one way to determine the greatest common divisor of two
positive integers a and b. We have seen that one of these involves using the Euclidean Algorithm.
We now describe a second method. We have seen by Theorem 7.9 that every integer n ≥2 can be
uniquely expressed as a product of primes. Suppose that we express each of a and b as a product of
primes, say in terms of the same primes. If some prime p appears as a factor in only one of a and
b, then we include p0 = 1 in the factorization of the other. For example, for a = 45 and b = 84, we
write a = 20 · 32 · 51 · 70 and b = 22 · 31 · 50 · 71. In general, if
a = pa1

(7.1)
where p1, p2, · · · pk are distinct primes and a1, a2, . . . , ak, b1, b2, . . . , bk are nonnegative integer expo-
nents, then
gcd(a, b) = pmin(a1, b1)

(7.2)
Therefore, in the case of a = 45 = 20 · 32 · 51 · 70 and b = 84 = 22 · 31 · 50 · 71,
gcd(a, b) = 2min(2, 0)3min(1, 2)5min(0, 1)7min(1, 0) = 20 · 31 · 50 · 70 = 3.
Example 7.37
Express each of the following pairs a, b of positive integers as a product of the same primes and use
this to determine gcd(a, b).
(a) a = 200, b = 2750. (b) a = 147, b = 2100.
(c) a = 143, b = 338. (d) a = 2320, b = 12, 100.
Solution.
(a) For a = 200 = 23 · 52 · 110 and b = 2750 = 21 · 53 · 111,
gcd(a, b) = 21 · 52 · 110 = 50.

(c) For a = 143 = 20 · 111 · 131 and b = 338 = 21 · 110 · 132,

(d) For a = 2320 = 24 · 51 · 110 · 291 and b = 12, 100 = 22 · 52 · 112 · 290,
gcd(a, b) = 22 · 51 = 20.
♦
Least Common Multiples
While it is often of interest to know the greatest common divisor of two positive integers a and
b, there are times when we are also interested in those integers that are divisible by both a and b.
Deﬁnition 7.38
For two positive integers a and b, an integer n is a common multiple of a and
b if n is a multiple of a and b. The smallest positive integer that is a common multiple of a and b
is the least common multiple of a and b. This number is denoted by lcm(a, b).
While ab is always a common multiple of two positive integers a and b, the least common multiple
of a and b is often smaller than ab.
Example 7.39
For each of the following pairs a, b of positive integers, determine by observation the least common
multiple of a and b.
(a) a = 6, b = 9. (b) a = 8, b = 12. (c) a = 10, b = 10.
(d) a = 5, b = 7. (e) a = 15, b = 30.
Solution.
(a) lcm(6, 9) = 18. (b) lcm(8, 12) = 24. (c) lcm(10, 10) = 10.
(d) lcm(5, 7) = 35. (e) lcm(15, 30) = 30.
♦
Example 7.39 illustrates the following facts about the least common multiple of two integers a
and b with 1 ≤a ≤b:
(1) b ≤lcm(a, b) ≤ab and
(2) if a | b, then lcm(a, b) = b.
Again, if a and b are expressed in (7.1) as a product of powers of the same distinct primes, that is,
a = pa1

♦
The following theorem is a consequence of equations (7.2) and (7.3), which gives a relationship
between the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of two integers (see Exercise 8).
Theorem 7.41
For every two positive integers a and b,
ab = gcd(a, b) lcm(a, b).
From what we have seen, if a and b are integers with 1 ≤a ≤b, then
1 ≤gcd(a, b) ≤a ≤b ≤lcm(a, b) ≤ab.
Example 7.42
For a = 12 and b = 54, we have gcd(a, b) = 6 and, by Theorem 7.41,
lcm(a, b) =
ab
gcd(a, b) = (12)(54)
6
= 108. ♦
Relatively Prime Integers
For integers a and b with 1 ≤a ≤b, we saw that gcd(a, b) = a if and only if a | b. However,
gcd(a, b) = 1 provided there is no integer greater than 1 that is a common divisor of a and b. If
gcd(a, b) = 1, then this means that there is no prime that divides both a and b.
Deﬁnition 7.43
Two integers a and b, not both 0, are relatively prime if gcd(a, b) = 1.
For example, 5 and 7 are relatively prime. If two integers a and b are relatively prime, then
neither a nor b need be prime, however. For example, gcd(4, 9) = 1. Also, every two consecutive
positive integers are relatively prime. For example, gcd(20, 21) = 1. We now verify the statement
that every two consecutive positive integers are relatively prime.
Result to Prove: Every two consecutive positive integers are relatively prime.
Proof Strategy. First, it seems as if it would be helpful to represent the two consecutive positive
integers by symbols. Let’s denote these integers by n and n + 1. Our goal then becomes to show
that
gcd(n, n + 1) = 1.
There appear to be two options to show that gcd(n, n + 1) = 1. One of these is to use the
Euclidean Algorithm. So we could begin by dividing n + 1 by n. Actually, if n = 1, then n + 1 = 2
and it is obvious that gcd(n, n + 1) = gcd(1, 2) = 1. On the other hand, if n ≥2, then when
n + 1 is divided by n the quotient is 1 and the remainder is 1, that is, n + 1 = n · 1 + 1 and so
gcd(n, n + 1) = gcd(1, n) = 1.
Another strategy to show that gcd(n, n + 1) = 1 is to introduce a symbol, namely d, to represent
gcd(n, n + 1), say d = gcd(n, n + 1). Our goal is then to show that d = 1. Since d = gcd(n, n + 1),
it follows that d is a common divisor of n and n + 1. Hence there are integers r and s such that
n = dr and n + 1 = ds. This probably suggests writing n + 1 in two ways, namely n + 1 = ds and
n + 1 = dr + 1. Thus ds = dr + 1 and so ds −dr = 1. Therefore, d(s −r) = 1. Since s −r is an
integer, d | 1, which implies that d ≤1. However, d is a positive integer, which gives us the desired
result. We use the second approach in the proof we give of this result.

Result 7.44
Every two consecutive positive integers are relatively prime.
Proof. Let n and n + 1 be consecutive positive integers and let d = gcd(n, n + 1).
Therefore,
d | n and d | (n + 1). Hence there exist integers r and s such that n = dr and n + 1 = ds. Thus
ds = n + 1 = dr + 1 and so
1 = ds −dr = d(s −r).
Since s −r is an integer, d | 1, which implies that d ≤1. Since d ≥1, it follows that d = 1 =
gcd(n, n + 1).
Linear Combinations of Integers
When dealing with certain kinds of objects in mathematics, including integers, it is often useful
to know, as we are about to see, if these objects can be expressed as “linear combinations” of other
objects.
Deﬁnition 7.45
Let a and b be two integers. An integer of the form ax + by, where x and y are
integers, is a linear combination of a and b.
Example 7.46
The following integers are linear combinations of a = 12 and b = 20:
32
=
12 · 1 + 20 · 1
8
=
12 · (−1) + 20 · 1
−8
=
12 · 1 + 20 · (−1)
−32
=
12 · (−1) + 20 · (−1)
0
=
12 · (−5) + 20 · 3
16
=
12 · (−2) + 20 · 2
4
=
12 · (−3) + 20 · 2. ♦
You might notice that gcd(12, 20) = 4. Also, 4 is a linear combination of 12 and 20. Of course,
many other integers are linear combinations of 12 and 20 as well. Suppose that the positive integer
n is a linear combination of 12 and 20. Then n = 12x + 20y for some integers x and y. However,
n = 12x + 20y = 4(3x + 5y).
Since 3x + 5y is an integer, 4 | n and so n ≥4.
This implies
that 4 is the smallest possible positive integer that is a linear combination of 12 and 20.
This
observation illustrates the following theorem. The proof of this theorem makes use of the Well-
Ordering Principle (see Exercise 28 in Supplementary Exercises for Chapter 4) which states that
every nonempty subset of N has a smallest element.
Theorem 7.47
Let a and b be integers that are not both 0. Then gcd(a, b) is the smallest positive
integer that is a linear combination of a and b.
Proof. First let S denote the set of all positive integers that are linear combinations of a and b,
that is,
S = {n ∈N : n = ax + by, x, y ∈Z}.
If we let x = a and y = b, then we obtain a2 + b2. Since a2 + b2 > 0, it follows that a2 + b2 ∈S and
so S ̸= ∅. By the Well-Ordering Principle, S has a least element, which we denote by d. Therefore,
there exist integers x0 and y0 such that d = ax0 + by0. We now show that d = gcd(a, b).
Dividing a by d, we obtain (by the Division Algorithm) a quotient q and a remainder r, where
0 ≤r < d. Thus

256
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
a = dq + r.
Hence
r = a −dq = a −(ax0 + by0)q = a(1 −qx0) + b(−qy0).
Therefore, r is a linear combination of a and b. If r > 0, then necessarily r ∈S. However, since
r < d and d is the smallest element in S, this produces a contradiction. Hence r = 0, implying that
d | a. By a similar argument, it follows that d | b and so d is a common divisor of a and b.
It remains to show that d is, in fact, the greatest common divisor of a and b. Let e be a common
divisor of a and b. By Theorem 7.4, e divides every linear combination of a and b. In particular,
e | d. Thus e ≤d and therefore d = gcd(a, b).
Example 7.48
For each of the following pairs a, b of positive integers, express d = gcd(a, b) as a linear combination
of a and b.
(a) a = 10, b = 14. (b) a = 8, b = 24. (c) a = 20, b = 25.
(d) a = 12, b = 12. (e) a = 18, b = 30. (f) a = 25, b = 27.
Solution.
(a) gcd(10, 14) = 2 = 10 · 3 + 14 · (−2).
(b) gcd(8, 24) = 8 = 8 · 1 + 24 · 0.
(c) gcd(20, 25) = 5 = 20 · (−1) + 25 · 1.
(d) gcd(12, 12) = 12 = 12 · 1 + 12 · 0.
(e) gcd(18, 30) = 6 = 18 · (−3) + 30 · 2.
(f) gcd(25, 27) = 1 = 25 · 13 + 27 · (−12).
♦
Analysis. Although it may not be too diﬃcult to ﬁnd integers x and y so that gcd(a, b) = ax+by for
the pairs a, b of integers given in Example 7.48(a)–(e), such may not be the case for Example 7.48(f).
Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we show how a pair x, y of integers can be found so that
gcd(25, 27) = 1 = 25x + 27y.
As a ﬁrst step in the Euclidean Algorithm, we use the Division Algorithm and divide 27 by 25,
obtaining
27 = 25 · 1 + 2.
(7.4)
Next, we divide a = 25 by r1 = 2, obtaining
25 = 2 · 12 + 1.
(7.5)
Since we have obtained a remainder of r2 = 1, this is clearly the last nonzero remainder and so
gcd(25, 27) = 1. Solving the equation (7.5) for gcd(25, 27) = 1, we obtain
1 = 25 −2 · 12
(7.6)
and solving for the remainder 2 in (7.4), we have
2 = 27 −25 · 1.
(7.7)
Substituting the expression for 2 in (7.7) into expression (7.6) gives us
1
=
25 −2 · 12 = 25 −(27 −25 · 1) · 12
=
25 · 1 + 27 · (−12) + 25 · 12 = 25 · 13 + 27 · (−12).
This algebra can be expressed more concisely as indicated below:

7.6. GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS
257
27 = 25 · 1 + 2
2 = 27 −25 · 1
25 = 2 · 12 + 1
1 = 25 −2 · 12.
Thus
1 = 25 −2 · 12 = 25 −(27 −25 · 1) · 12 = 25 · 13 + 27 · (−12). ♦
If d = gcd(a, b) and d = ax + by for integers x and y, then x and y are not unique. Indeed, d can
also be expressed as the linear combination
d = a(x −b) + b(y + a).
Thus in Example 7.48(f), we can also write
1
=
25 · 13 + 27 · (−12) = 25 · (13 −27) + 27 · (−12 + 25)
=
25 · (−14) + 27 · 13.
We now state two consequences of Theorem 7.47. We saw in Example 7.48(e) that gcd(18, 30) =
6. Actually, 3 is also a common divisor of 18 and 30, as is 2. Of course, 3 < 6 and 2 < 6 since 6 is
the greatest common divisor of 18 and 30. However, both 3 | 6 and 2 | 6. This always occurs.
Corollary 7.49
Let a and b be integers that are not both 0 and let d = gcd(a, b). If n is an integer
that is a common divisor of a and b, then n | d.
Proof. By Theorem 7.47, there are integers x and y such that d = ax + by. Since n | a and n | b,
there are integers s and t such that a = ns and b = nt. Thus
d = ax + by = (ns)x + (nt)y = n(sx + ty).
Since sx + ty is an integer, n | d.
We saw in Example 7.48(f) that 1 is a linear combination of 25 and 27. Actually, 2 is a linear
combination of 25 and 27 as well since 2 = 25 · (−1) + 27 · 1. Of course, just because we’re able to
express 2 as a linear combination of 25 and 27 does not mean that 2 is the greatest common divisor
of 25 and 27. Indeed, it is not. However, if we are able to express 1 as a linear combination of two
integers a and b, then gcd(a, b) must be 1 since 1 is the smallest positive integer. The following
result is then a consequence of Theorem 7.47.
Corollary 7.50
Two integers a and b are relatively prime if and only if 1 is a linear combination
of a and b; that is, gcd(a, b) = 1 if and only if ax + by = 1 for some integers x and y.
Example 7.51
Use Corollary 7.50 to show that the following pairs of integers are relatively prime:
(a) every two consecutive integers.
(b) every two odd integers that diﬀer by 2.
Solution.
(a) Let n and n + 1 be two consecutive integers. Since
1 = n · (−1) + (n + 1) · 1,
it follows by Corollary 7.50 that gcd(n, n + 1) = 1.

258
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
(b) Let n and n+2 be two odd integers. Since n is odd, n = 2k+1 for some integer k. Consequently,
n + 2 = 2k + 3. Since
1 = (2k + 1)(k + 1) + (2k + 3)(−k),
it follows by Corollary 7.50 that gcd(n, n + 2) = 1.
♦
If a, b and c are integers such that a | bc, then there is no reason to believe that a | b or a | c.
For example, let a = 6, b = 4 and c = 3. Then 6 | 4 · 3 but 6 ∤4 and 6 ∤3. On the other hand, if a
and b are relatively prime, then we can make a diﬀerent conclusion.
Theorem to Prove: Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a | c.
Proof Strategy.
If we attempt a direct proof of this theorem, then we would begin by assuming
a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1. Our goal is show that a | c, that is, to show we can express c as the product
of a and some other integer. Let’s see what information is available to us. Because a | bc, we can
write bc = aq for some integer q. Because a and b are relatively prime, it follows by Corollary 7.50
that 1 can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, that is, there are integers x and y such
that 1 = ax + by. The question is how to put these two pieces of information together to show that
a | c. Observe that if we were to multiply both sides of the equation 1 = ax + by by c, we would
obtain c = acx + bcy. However, bc = aq. This observation leads to a proof.
♦
Theorem 7.52
Let a, b and c be integers with a ̸= 0. If a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a | c.
Proof. Assume that a | bc. Then bc = aq for some integer q. Since a and b are relatively prime, it
follows by Corollary 7.50 that there exist integers x and y such that 1 = ax + by. Thus
c = c · 1 = c(ax + by) = a(cx) + (bc)y = a(cx) + (aq)y = a(cx + qy).
Since cx + qy is an integer, a | c.
Theorem 7.52 is of special interest when the integer a is a prime. The following is a consequence
of Theorem 7.52.
Corollary 7.53
Let b and c be integers and let p be a prime. If p | bc, then either p | b or p | c.
Proof. If p divides b, then the corollary is proved. Suppose then that p does not divide b. Since
the only positive integer divisors of p are 1 and p, it follows that gcd(p, b) = 1. It then follows by
Theorem 7.52 that p | c.
Corollary 7.53 can be extended to the case when a prime p divides a product of any ﬁnite number
of integers.
Theorem to Prove: Let a1, a2, . . . , an be n ≥2 integers and let p be a prime. If
p | a1 a2 · · · an,
then p | ai for some integer i with 1 ≤i ≤n.
Proof Strategy:
If n = 2 in the statement of the theorem, then what the theorem says is that if
p | a1 a2, then p | a1 or p | a2. But this an immediate consequence of Corollary 7.53. More generally,
what we wish to show is the following:
If p is a prime and a1, a2, . . . , an are any n ≥2 integers such that p | a1a2 · · · an, then p
divides at least one of the integers a1, a2, . . . , an.
From the way this statement is worded, it appears that a natural proof technique to try is induction.
The fact that this statement is known to be true when n = 2 veriﬁes the basis step of the induction.
To verify the inductive step, we assume that whenever a prime divides the product of k ≥2 integers,
then this prime divides at least one of these k integers. We are then required to show that if some

7.6. GREATEST COMMON DIVISORS
259
prime divides a product of k +1 integers, then this prime divides at least one of these k +1 integers.
Let’s return to what we just said.
Assume that if some prime divides the product of k ≥2 integers, then this prime must divide at
least one of these k integers. Now let p be a prime and let a1, a2, . . . , ak+1 be k+1 integers such that
p | a1a2 · · · ak+1. We show that p divides at least one of the integers a1, a2, . . . , ak+1. If we write
b = a1a2 · · · ak, then the fact that p | a1a2 · · · ak+1 can be expressed as p | bak+1. However then, the
prime p divides the product of the two integers b and ak+1. By Corollary 7.53, p | b or p | ak+1.
Should it occur that p | ak+1, then this conclusion gives us a proof of the inductive step. On the
other hand, if p | b, then p | a1a2 · · · ak. Since, however, p divides the product of k integers in this
case, it follows from the induction hypothesis that p must divide one of the integers a1, a2, . . . , ak
and the inductive step has been veriﬁed in this case as well. We then have a proof of the theorem. ♦
Theorem 7.54
Let a1, a2, . . . , an be n ≥2 integers and let p be a prime. If
p | a1 a2 · · · an,
then p | ai for some integer i with 1 ≤i ≤n.
Proof. We proceed by induction. By Corollary 7.53, the statement is true when n = 2. Thus the
basis step of the induction is veriﬁed. Assume that
if a prime p divides the product of k integers, where k ≥2, then p divides at least one of
these k integers.
Now let a1, a2, . . . , ak+1 be k + 1 integers such that p | a1a2 · · · ak+1. We show that p | ai for some
integer i (1 ≤i ≤k + 1). Let
b = a1a2 · · · ak.
So p | bak+1. By Corollary 7.53, either p | b or p | ak+1. If p | ak+1, then the proof is complete.
Otherwise, p | b, that is,
p | a1a2 · · · ak.
However, by the induction hypothesis, p | ai for some integer i (1 ≤i ≤k). In any case, p | ai for
some integer i (1 ≤i ≤k + 1).
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the theorem is true.
We are now in a position to present a proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (Theo-
rem 7.9), whose statement is repeated below. Although the proof is not easy, it is good if we make
an eﬀort to understand it.
The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
Every integer n ≥2 is either prime or can be
expressed as a product of (not necessarily distinct) primes, that is,
n = p1p2 · · · pk,
where p1, p2, . . . , pk are primes. This factorization is unique except possibly for the order in which
the primes appear.
Proof.
To show the existence of such a factorization, we employ the Strong Principle of Mathe-
matical Induction. Since 2 is prime, the statement is true for n = 2.
For an arbitrary integer k ≥2, assume that every integer i, where 2 ≤i ≤k, is either prime or
can be expressed as a product of primes. We show that k + 1 is either prime or can be expressed as
a product of primes. Of course, if k + 1 is prime, then there is nothing further to prove. We may
assume, then, that k + 1 is composite. Then there exist integers a and b such that
k + 1 = ab, where 2 ≤a ≤k and 2 ≤b ≤k.

260
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, each of a and b is prime or can be expressed as a product
of primes. In any case, k + 1 = ab is a product of primes. By the Strong Principle of Mathematical
Induction, every integer n ≥2 is either prime or can be expressed as a product of primes.
To prove that such a factorization is unique, we proceed by contradiction.
Assume, to the
contrary, that there is an integer n ≥2 that can be expressed as a product of primes in more than
one way, say as
n = p1p2 · · · ps and n = q1q2 · · · qt,
where in each factorization, the primes are arranged in nondecreasing order, that is,
p1 ≤p2 ≤· · · ≤ps and q1 ≤q2 ≤· · · ≤qt.
Since the factorizations are diﬀerent, there must be a smallest positive integer r such that
pr ̸= qr.
In other words, if r ≥2, then pi = qi for every i with 1 ≤i ≤r −1. After canceling, we have
prpr+1 · · · ps = qrqr+1 · · · qt.
(7.8)
Consider the integer pr.
Either s = r and the left side of (7.8) is exactly pr or s > r and
pr+1pr+2 · · · ps is an integer that is the product of s −r primes. In either case,
pr | qrqr+1 · · · qt.
By Theorem 7.54, pr | qj for some integer j with r ≤j ≤t. Because qj is prime, pr = qj. Since
qr ≤qj, it follows that qr ≤pr. By considering the integer qr (instead of pr), we can use the same
argument to show that pr ≤qr. Therefore, pr = qr. But this contradicts the fact that pr ̸= qr.
Hence, as claimed, every integer n ≥2 has a unique factorization.

were working with decimal expansions of real numbers that are not integers, then each digit in
the expansion represents a coeﬃcient of 10k for some (not necessarily nonnegative) integer k. For
example,
23.506 = 2 · 101 + 3 · 100 + 5 · 10−1 + 0 · 10−2 + 6 · 10−3.
However, we will continue to restrict our discussion to integers. The representation of integers that
we’ve just discussed is the decimal or base 10 representation of an integer. Representating integers
is not restricted to base 10, however.
Theorem 7.55
Let b ≥2 be an integer. Then every positive integer n has a unique representation
in base b as
n = akbk + ak−1bk−1 + · · · + a1b1 + a0b0,
where k is a nonnegative integer, a0, a1, . . . , ak are nonnegative integers less than b and ak ̸= 0.
Proof. First, we divide n by b, obtaining (by the Division Algorithm) a quotient q1 and a remainder
a0, where 0 ≤a0 < b. Then
n = bq1 + a0 = q1b + a0.
Dividing q1 by b, we obtain
q1 = bq2 + a1 = q2b + a1,
where 0 ≤a1 < b. Hence
n
=
q1b + a0 = (q2b + a1)b + a0
=
q2b2 + a1b + a0
=
q2b2 + a1b1 + a0b0.
Continuing in this manner, we arrive at the desired result.
The representation of n in base b given in Theorem 7.55 is called the base b expansion of n
and is denoted by
n = (akak−1 · · · a1a0)b.
There are occasions when it is convenient to work with bases diﬀerent than 10, especially when
dealing with computers. In such instances, base 2 (binary), base 8 (octal) and base 16 (hexadec-
imal) are common and useful. When b = 2, the binary digits (bits) are 0 and 1; when b = 8, the
octal digits are 0, 1, . . ., 7; and when b = 16, the hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, . . ., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F,
where the letters A, B, . . . , F represent the numbers 10, 11, . . ., 15 (expressed decimally), respec-
tively. Figure 7.3 gives the binary, octal and hexadecimal representations of each integer n with
0 ≤n ≤15.
We begin by converting an integer expressed in base 2 to its decimal representation.

The next example concerns base 8 and base 16.
Example 7.57

below.
(a) (53)8. (b) (172)8. (c) (1077)8. (d) (10)16. (e) (2A1)16. (f) (BDF)16.
Solution.
(a) (53)8 = 5 · 81 + 3 · 80 = 40 + 3 = 43.
(b) (172)8 = 1 · 82 + 7 · 81 + 2 · 80 = 64 + 56 + 2 = 122.
(c) (1077)8 = 1 · 83 + 0 · 82 + 7 · 81 + 7 · 80 = 512 + 56 + 7 = 575.
(d) (10)16 = 1 · 161 + 0 · 160 = 16.
(e) (2A1)16 = 2 · 162 + 10 · 161 + 1 · 160 = 512 + 160 + 1 = 673.
(f) (BDF)16 = 11 · 162 + 13 · 161 + 15 · 160 = 2816 + 208 + 15 = 3039.
♦
There is now a natural question: How can an integer represented in base 10 be converted to an
expansion in base b, where b ̸= 10? The following example suggests a general technique.
Example 7.58
What is the octal expansion of the number (3947)10?
Solution. Dividing 3947 by 8, we obtain a quotient of 493 and a remainder of 3. Therefore,
3947 = 493 · 8 + 3.
Dividing 493 by 8, we obtain a quotient of 61 and a remainder of 5. Thus
493 = 61 · 8 + 5.
Hence
3947
=
493 · 8 + 3 = (61 · 8 + 5) · 8 + 3
=
61 · 82 + 5 · 8 + 3.
Dividing 61 by 8, we obtain

264
CHAPTER 7. INTEGERS
61 = 7 · 8 + 5.
Thus
3947
=
61 · 82 + 5 · 8 + 3
=
(7 · 8 + 5) · 82 + 5 · 8 + 3
=
7 · 83 + 5 · 82 + 5 · 8 + 3 · 80.
Therefore, (3947)10 = (7553)8.
In summary, we have found that
3947 div 8 = 493 and 3947 mod 8 = 3
493 div 8 = 61 and 493 mod 8 = 5
61 div 8 = 7 and 61 mod 8 = 5
7 div 8 = 0 and 7 mod 8 = 7.
Thus (3947)10 = (7553)8.
♦
We now consider such examples in base 2 and base 16.
Example 7.59
What is the binary expansion of the number (43)10?
Solution. Since
43 div 2 = 21 and 43 mod 2 = 1
21 div 2 = 10 and 21 mod 2 = 1
10 div 2 = 5 and 10 mod 2 = 0
5 div 2 = 2 and 5 mod 2 = 1
2 div 2 = 1 and 2 mod 2 = 0
1 div 2 = 0 and 1 mod 2 = 1,
it follows that (43)10 = (101011)2.
♦
Example 7.60
What is the hexadecimal expansion of the number (3162)10?
Solution. Since
3162 div 16 = 197 and 3162 mod 16 = 10
197 div 16 = 12 and 197 mod 16 = 5
12 div 16 = 0 and 12 mod 16 = 12,
it follows that (3162)10 = (C5A)16.
♦
Converting the expansions of positive integers among the bases 2, 8 and 16 is, in general, a much
easier process. The table shown in Figure 7.3 will be useful for the next three examples.
Example 7.61
Determine the octal and hexadecimal expansions of the number (111001101)2.
Solution. The number (111001101)2 represents
1 · 28 + 1 · 27 + 1 · 26 + 0 · 25 + 0 · 24 + 1 · 23 + 1 · 22 + 0 · 21 + 1 · 20
=
(1 · 28 + 1 · 27 + 1 · 26) + (0 · 25 + 0 · 24 + 1 · 23) + (1 · 22 + 0 · 21 + 1 · 20)
=
(4 · 26 + 2 · 26 + 1 · 26) + (0 · 23 + 0 · 23 + 1 · 23) + (4 · 20 + 0 · 20 + 1 · 20)
=
7 · 26 + 1 · 23 + 5 · 20 = 7 · (23)2 + 1 · (23)1 + 5 · (23)0
=
7 · 82 + 1 · 81 + 5 · 80

7.7. INTEGER REPRESENTATIONS
265
and so (111001101)2 = (715)8.
In short, what this tells us to do is to place the bits in the expansion (111001101)2 into groups
of three, namely, 111, 001, 101. Since (111)2 = (7)8, (001)2 = (1)8 and (101)2 = (5)8, we have the
result that (111001101)2 = (715)8.
To convert (111001101)2 to a hexadecimal expansion, we place the bits this time into groups of
four, namely, 1, 1100, 1101. Since (1)2 = (1)16, (1100)2 = (C)16 and (1101)2 = (D)16, it follows
that (111001101)2 = (1CD)16.
♦
Example 7.62
Express the octal expansion (233)8 as an integer in hexadecimal expansion.
Solution. Since (233)8 denotes 2 · 82 + 3 · 81 + 3 · 80 and in base 2, the coeﬃcient 2 is expressed as
10 and the coeﬃcient 3 is expressed as 011, we can express (233)8 in base 2 as
10
011
011.
Regrouping the 1s and 0s in groups of four bits, we have
1001
1011.
However, (1001)2 = (9)16 and (1011)2 = (B)16. Thus (233)8 = (10011011)2 = (9B)16.
♦
Example 7.63
Express the hexadecimal expansion (6D)16 as an integer in octal expansion.
Solution. Since (6D)16 denotes 6 · 161 + D · 160 and in base 2, the coeﬃcient 6 is expressed as 110,
while in base 2 the coeﬃcient D is expressed as 1101, we can express (6D)16 in base 2 as
1101101.
Regrouping the 1s and 0s in groups of three bits, we have
1
101
101.
However, (1)2 = (1)8 and (101)2 = (5)8 and so (6D)16 = (1101101)2 = (155)8.

Introduction to Counting
Discrete mathematics consists of many areas of mathematics. One of these areas is combinatorics.
Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of conﬁgurations or ar-
rangements of objects. Combinatorics evidently came into prominence during 1915-1916 only after
the publication of the classic two-volume treatise Combinatory Analysis by Percy Alexander MacMa-
hon. Quite possibly combinatorics did not become a respected branch of mathematics until the 1960s
when the eminent combinatorialist Gian-Carlo Rota wrote a series of ten papers on “Foundations
of Combinatorics.” He was a professor at MIT during most of his career and, with Frank Harary,
founded the Journal of Combinatorial Theory.
Another mathematician who played a major role in the development and popularization of com-
binatorics was Paul Erd˝os. Erd˝os was a Hungarian mathematician who traveled constantly, visiting
mathematicians in many parts of the world to do research in combinatorics, number theory, set
theory and probability theory (a subject we’ll visit in Chapter 10). He was one of the most proliﬁc
mathematicians of all time, having authored or co-authored more than 1500 research articles. A
humorous concept associated with Erd¨os is the Erd˝os number. Only Paul Erd˝os has Erd˝os num-
ber 0, while any person who co-authored a paper with Erd˝os has Erd˝os number 1. An individual
who does not have Erd˝os number 1 but who has co-authored a paper with someone who has Erd˝os
number 1 has Erd˝os number 2 and so on. Over 500 individuals have Erd˝os number 1, while over
6500 people have Erd˝os number 2.
As we mentioned, combinatorics deals with conﬁgurations or arrangements of objects. Many of
the questions in this area concern one or more of the following topics:
(1)
Existence: Is such a conﬁguration or arrangement possible?
(2)
Enumeration: How many such conﬁgurations are there?
(3)
Optimization: Is some arrangement of a certain type more desirable in some way?
In this chapter and the next, we will be particularly concerned with questions in combinatorics of the
type (2). This area of combinatorics is generally called enumerative combinatorics – the subject
of counting. In this chapter, some of the fundamental principles of counting will be introduced.
These will allow us to answer many types of questions concerning enumeration.
8.1
The Multiplication and Addition Principles
There are a number of instances when a certain procedure consists of a sequence of two tasks in
which the second task is performed only after the ﬁrst task has been performed. We say that the
procedure itself is performed when the two tasks are performed. If we know the number of ways in
which each of the two tasks can be performed, then the multiplication principle tells us the number
of ways that the procedure can be performed.

CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
The Multiplication Principle
The Multiplication Principle A procedure consists of a sequence of two tasks. To perform this
procedure, one performs the ﬁrst task followed by performing the second task. If there are n1 ways to
perform the ﬁrst task and n2 ways to perform the second task after the ﬁrst task has been performed,
then there are n1n2 ways to perform the procedure.
Let’s look at two examples where the Multiplication Principle can be applied.
Example 8.1
An employee of a software company in Washington, DC has been asked to attend a 2-day meeting
in Atlanta followed by a 2-day meeting in Orlando. When checking airline web sites, he learns that
there are four diﬀerent ﬂights from Washington to Atlanta that are convenient for him (namely
at 1:30, 3:00, 4:00 and 5:30 pm) and three diﬀerent ﬂights from Atlanta to Orlando that meet his
requirements (at 7 am, 8 am and 10 am). How many diﬀerent satisfactory ﬂight schedules from
Washington to Orlando through Atlanta are there for him?
Solution. Since there are four satisfactory ﬂights from Washington to Atlanta and three acceptable
ﬂights from Atlanta to Orlando, it follows by the Multiplication Principle that the number of ﬂight
schedules for him from Washington to Orlando through Atlanta is 4 · 3 = 12.
♦
Example 8.2
At a certain university, a student is required to take a 2-course sequence during her senior year. The
ﬁrst course can be any of the three courses CS 410, CS 420 or CS 430. To complete a sequence,
the student has two choices after taking any of these three courses; namely, she can take CS 411 or
CS 412 after taking CS 410, she can take CS 421 or CS 422 after taking CS 420 or she can take
CS 431 or CS 432 after taking CS 430. How many choices does she have for a required 2-course
sequence?
Solution. Since there are three possible courses for the ﬁrst course in a 2-course sequence and once
the ﬁrst course has been taken, there are two possible courses for the second course in the sequence, it
follows by the Multiplication Principle that the total number of possibilities for a 2-course sequence
is 3 · 2 = 6.
♦
The six possible 2-course sequences discussed in Example 8.2 can be described by means of a
diagram, called a tree diagram. The tree diagram for Example 8.2 is shown in Figure 8.1. Each
sequence can be obtained by starting at the top of the diagram and proceeding downward through the
diagram, resulting in the six ordered pairs (2-course sequences), where we omit “CS” for simplicity:
(410, 411), (410, 412), (420, 421), (420, 422), (430, 431), (430, 432).

The Multiplication Principle, as stated, tells us how to compute the number of ways of performing
a procedure that consists of performing two tasks in succession. Procedures need not be limited to

8.1. THE MULTIPLICATION AND ADDITION PRINCIPLES
273
two tasks, however, for suppose that a certain procedure A consists of performing three tasks, say
T1, T2, T3 in that order. That is, performing procedure A requires us to ﬁrst perform task T1, then
perform T2 and ﬁnally T3. Let us assume that there are n1 ways to perform T1, n2 ways to perform
T2 after T1 has been performed and n3 ways to perform T3 after T2 has been performed (so there
are ni ways to perform Ti for i = 1, 2, 3). In how many ways can procedure A be performed?
What we can do in this case is to think of linking the two tasks T2 and T3 together as a procedure,
say procedure B. In other words, to perform procedure A, we perform task T1 followed by performing
procedure B. We can think of procedure B as a task itself, albeit a somewhat more complex task.
By the Multiplication Principle then, the number of ways to perform procedure A is the number of
ways of performing task T1 (which we know is n1) times the number of ways of performing procedure
B. However, performing procedure B requires us to perform task T2 and then task T3. So, by the
Multiplication Principle, the number of ways of performing procedure B is n2n3 and so the total
number of ways of performing procedure A is n1(n2n3) = n1n2n3.
This suggests the following more general principle. In fact, the discussion just given for deter-
mining the number of procedures consisting of three tasks indicates how this general principle can
be proved (by mathematical induction).
The (General) Multiplication Principle Performing a certain procedure consists of performing
a sequence of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm. If there are ni ways of performing Ti after any preceding
tasks have been performed for i = 1, 2, . . ., m, then the total number of ways of performing the
procedure is n1n2 · · · nm.
Let’s now consider several examples of this more general principle. Whether we use the Multi-
plication Principle (in which two tasks are involved) or the General Multiplication Principle, we will
henceforth refer to either simply as the Multiplication Principle.
Example 8.3
Several years ago an automobile license plate number in a certain state consisted of two letters
followed by four digits. How many diﬀerent license plates were available under that scheme?
Solution. We can think of a license plate looking like the following:
The ﬁrst two slots are to be ﬁlled in by letters and the last four by digits. Since there are 26 letters
and 10 digits, it follows by the Multiplication Principle that there are
26 · 26 · 10 · 10 · 10 · 10 = 262 · 104 = 6, 760, 000
diﬀerent license plates.
♦
Example 8.4
In a certain computer science course, there is a weekly quiz. The quiz for today consists of ten
true-false questions. How many diﬀerent sequences of answers are possible for this quiz?
Solution. Each of the ten questions can be answered in one of two ways (true or false); so the
number of diﬀerent sequences of responses for this quiz is
2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 210 = 1024. ♦
The preceding example can be interpreted in a diﬀerent way.
Recall that a bit is a 0 or a
1 and a bit string of length n (or an n-bit string) is a sequence of n bits. Since each bit has two
possible values, the number of diﬀerent bit strings of length n is 2n. In Example 8.4, we can consider

274
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
sequences of responses to the 10-question true-false quiz as 10-bit sequences (where 0 corresponds
to false, say, and 1 corresponds to true) and so the number of diﬀerent sequences of responses is 210.
Counting the number of diﬀerent 10-bit strings is a special case of a more general problem. Let
A = {1, 2, . . ., 10}, where the integer i (1 ≤i ≤10) corresponds to question i on the quiz and let
B = {0, 1}. Suppose that we were to count the number of diﬀerent functions f : A →B. Each such
function f has the appearance
f = {(1,
), (2,
), . . . , (10,
)},
where each blank is to be ﬁlled in with 0 or 1. Thus, the number of functions from A to B is 210,
which, of course, is the number of diﬀerent 10-bit strings. This suggests a more general result.
Theorem 8.5 If A and B are two ﬁnite nonempty sets with |A| = m and |B| = n, then the number
of diﬀerent functions from A to B is |B||A| = nm.
Proof. Let A ={a1, a2, . . ., am}. Any function f : A →B has the appearance
f = {(a1,
), (a2,
), . . . , (am,
)},
where each blank (the image of an element of A) is to be ﬁlled in with an element of the codomain
B. Since there are n choices for each image, it then follows by the Multiplication Principle that the
number of such functions is the product of m factors n, that is, n · n · · · · · n = nm.
Example 8.6
Determine the number of possible responses to a 20-question multiple choice exam, with ﬁve allowable
choices for each question (assuming that every question is answered with exactly one of these ﬁve
choices).
Solution. When such a multiple choice exam is taken, this produces a function. In particular, each
response to a 20-question multiple choice exam, with ﬁve choices (say a, b, c, d, e ) for each question,
can be thought of as a function f : A →B, where A = {1, 2, · · · , 20} and B = {a, b, c, d, e}. It then
follows by Theorem 8.5 that there are 520 possible responses to such a multiple choice exam.
♦
We now present a result that corresponds to Theorem 8.5 for one-to-one functions. We saw in
Chapter 5 that in order for a function f : A →B to be one-to-one, we must have |A| ≤|B|. Hence
if |A| > |B|, then there are no one-to-one functions from A to B. Recall for a positive integer n that
n factorial is n! = n(n −1) · · · 3 · 2 · 1.
Theorem 8.7
If A and B are two sets with |A| = m and |B| = n, where m ≤n, then the number
of diﬀerent one-to-one functions from A to B is
n!
(n −m)!.
Proof. Let’s ﬁrst consider the special case where m = n so that A = {a1, a2, . . . , an}. A one-to-one
function f : A →B can be expressed as
f = {(a1,
), (a2,
), . . . , (an,
)}.
Since B has n elements, there are n possible images for a1. Once an image for a1 has been determined,
this element of B cannot be the image of any other element of A since f is one-to-one. Hence there
are n −1 possible images for a2. Similarly, there are n −2 possible images for a3, etc., until arriving
at only one possible image for an. Consequently, the total number of one-to-one functions from A
to B is
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1 = n!.
If m < n, then each one-to-one function f : A →B can be expressed as
f = {(a1,
), (a2,
), . . . , (am,
)},

8.1. THE MULTIPLICATION AND ADDITION PRINCIPLES
275
Proceeding as above, we see that the number of one-to-one functions from A to B is
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −m + 1).
(8.1)
Multiplying the number in (8.1) by (n −m)!/(n −m)!, we see that the answer to this question can
be expressed more simply as
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −m + 1) · (n −m)!
(n −m)! =
n!
(n −m)!.
Using the standard convention that 0! = 1, we see that the number of one-to-one functions from A
to B is given by
n!
(n −m)!.
Example 8.8
Determine the number of the one-to-one functions from A to B, where |A| = 4 and |B| = 7.
Solution. From Theorem 8.7, we see that the number of one-to-one functions from A to B is
7!
(7 −4)! = 7!
3! = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 = 840. ♦
Suppose that a certain procedure consists of a sequence of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm. For
1 ≤i ≤m, let Ai be the set of all possible ways of performing the task Ti, where |Ai| = ni. By
the Multiplication Principle, the number of ways of performing the procedure is n1n2 · · · nm. Each
element of the Cartesian product A1 × A2 × · · · × Am is one way to perform this procedure and
A1 × A2 × · · · × Am is the set of all possible ways to perform this procedure. Hence the number of
ways to perform the procedure is
|A1 × A2 × · · · × Am| = n1n2 · · · nm.
Therefore, we have the following.
For m ≥2 sets A1, A2, . . . , Am,
|A1 × A2 × · · · × Am| = |A1| · |A2| · · · · · |Am|.
In particular, for every two sets A and B,
|A × B| = |A| · |B|,
as we saw in Section 2.3.
The Addition Principle
We now turn to a second principle. There are instances when performing a certain procedure
consists of performing one of two tasks that cannot be performed at the same time. In this case, we
say that the procedure is performed if either task is performed. The Addition Principle informs us
of the number of ways that such a procedure can be performed.
The Addition Principle
A procedure consists of two tasks that cannot be performed simulta-
neously. To perform this procedure, either of the two tasks is performed. If the ﬁrst task can be
performed in n1 ways and the second can be performed in n2 ways, then the number of ways of
performing this procedure is n1 + n2.

276
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
Example 8.9
A student majoring in computer science needs only one additional approved course to complete a
minor in either mathematics or physics. If there are three approved courses to complete a minor in
mathematics and ﬁve approved courses to complete a minor in physics where no single course will
complete both minors, then how many choices does the student have to complete a minor?
Solution. By the Addition Principle, the total number of ways to complete a minor in either
mathematics or physics is 3 + 5 = 8.
♦
As with the Multiplication Principle, there is a more general Addition Principle when there are
more than two tasks involved. Here too, we will use the term Addition Principle, regardless of the
number of tasks involved.
The (General) Addition Principle Performing a certain procedure consists of performing one
of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm, no two of which can be performed at the same time. If the task Ti
can be performed in ni ways for 1 ≤i ≤m, then the number of ways of performing this procedure is
n1 + n2 + · · · + nm.
Example 8.10
After a student graduates from college, he wants to work on a Master’s degree in computer science.
He is considering two universities in South Carolina, three universities in Georgia and ﬁve universities
in Florida. By the Addition Principle, the total number of choices he has for his graduate studies is
2 + 3 + 5 = 10.
♦
Suppose that a certain procedure consists of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm, no two of which can be
performed at the same time. For 1 ≤i ≤m, let Ai be the set of all possible ways of performing the
task Ti, where |Ai| = ni. Thus {A1, A2, . . . , Am} is a collection of pairwise disjoint ﬁnite sets. By
the Addition Principle, the number of ways of performing the procedure is n1 + n2 + · · · + nm. Each
element of the union A1 ∪A2 ∪. . .∪Am is one way to perform this procedure and A1 ∪A2 ∪. . .∪Am
is the set of all possible ways to perform the procedure. Hence the number of ways to perform the
procedure is
|A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am| = n1 + n2 + · · · + nm.
This argument provides us with the following.
If A1, A2, · · · , Am are m ≥2 pairwise disjoint sets, then
|A1 ∪A2 ∪· · · ∪Am| = |A1| + |A2| + · · · + |Am|.
In the following example, both the Multiplication and Addition Principles are employed.
Example 8.11
A recent graduate has obtained a position with a communications company and needs to spend the
ﬁrst six months in training, which can be done in the Western United States or Eastern United
States. She can spend the ﬁrst three months in Seattle or Portland and the next three months in
Sacramento, San Jose or San Francisco; or she can spend the ﬁrst three months in New York City,
Boston or Newark and the next three months in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, New Haven or Buﬀalo.
What is the number of choices this individual has for her training schedule?
Solution. By the Multiplication Principle, she has 2 · 3 = 6 choices for a training schedule if she
decides to spend her training period in Western United States, while, again by the Multiplication
Principle, she has 3·4 = 12 choices for a training schedule if she decides to spend her training period

8.1. THE MULTIPLICATION AND ADDITION PRINCIPLES
277
in Eastern United States. By the Addition Principle, the total number of possible training schedules
for her is 6 + 12 = 18.
♦
Let’s now consider several examples involving the Multiplication and/or Addition Principles,
beginning with two examples concerning bit sequences.
Example 8.12
How many 10-bit sequences begin with 001 and end with 11?
Solution. Such a sequence has the following appearance:
0 0 1
1 1
There are ﬁve terms of the sequence to be determined and each term is either 0 or 1. Since there
are two choices for each of the ﬁve terms to be determined, it follows by the Multiplication Principle
that the total number of sequences with the desired property is 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 25 = 32.
♦
Example 8.13
How many 8-bit sequences begin with 11011 or 0100?
Solution. We are considering 8-bit sequences of the type
1 1 0 1 1
or
0 1 0 0
By the Multiplication Principle, the number of 8-bit sequences that begin with 11011 is 2 · 2 · 2 =
23 = 8 and the number of 8-bit sequences that begin with 0100 is 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 24 = 16. Since an
8-bit sequence cannot begin with both 11011 and 0100, it follows by the Addition Principle that the
number of 8-bit sequences with the desired property is 8 + 16 = 24.
♦
We will see some variations of the question asked in Example 8.13 in the next section.
Example 8.14
In a school election, three students are to be elected to the student council for the next year. One of
the students to be elected must be a freshman, one a sophomore and one a junior. Voting consists
of listing three names:
1.
2.
3.
The ﬁrst name listed must be a freshman, the second a sophomore and the third a junior.
(a) In how many diﬀerent ways can a ballot be marked if there are 8 candidates for the freshman
position, 3 for the sophomore position and 4 for the junior position?
(b) After the election, the president of the student council can choose any one of those not elected
to the student council as an at-large member of the council. In how many ways can this be
done?
Solution.
(a) By the Multiplication Principle, the total number of possible outcomes for a ballot is 8·3·4 = 96.
(b) After the election there are 7 freshmen, 2 sophomores and 3 juniors who were not elected to
the student council. By the Addition Principle, the number of choices for the at-large member
is 7 + 2 + 3 = 12.

CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
8.2
The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
According to the Addition Principle, if performing a procedure consists of performing one of two
tasks, where the ﬁrst task can be performed in n1 ways and the second task can be performed in
n2 ways but the two tasks cannot be performed at the same time, then the number of ways of
performing the procedure is n1 + n2. But what if it’s possible that the two tasks can be performed
at the same time? For example, suppose, on a United States geography exam, a student is asked
to list a city that is either a State capital or is one of the 50 largest cities, according to the most
recent United States census. A correct answer therefore consists either of listing a State capital or
listing one of the 50 largest cities. This should be an easy question to answer, but here’s a more
challenging question: How many correct answers are there to this question? Since there are 50 State
capitals and obviously 50 largest cities, it may appear that there are 50 + 50 = 100 correct answers
to this question. But this is not so. For example, Phoenix is not only the capital of Arizona, it is
also one of the 50 largest cities in the United States. Consequently, the number of correct answers
to the question above is less than 100.
Observe that if A and B are two disjoint ﬁnite sets, then |A ∪B| = |A| + |B|. But what does
|A ∪B| equal if A and B are not disjoint? Figure 8.2 suggests the answer to this question. Suppose
that there are a elements in A that are not in B, there are b elements in B that are not in A and x
elements that belong to both A and B. Therefore, |A| = a + x, |B| = b + x, |A ∪B| = a + b + x and
|A ∩B| = x. Since a + b + x = (a + x) + (b + x) −x, it follows that
|A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∩B|.
Therefore, to determine the number of elements in A∪B, we count the number of elements belonging
to A, count the number of elements belonging to B, count the number of elements belonging to both
A and B and subtract the third number from the sum of the ﬁrst two.

The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion A procedure consists of two tasks. To perform the proce-
dure, one performs either of the two tasks. If the ﬁrst task can be performed in n1 ways, the second
task can be performed in n2 ways and the two tasks can be simultaneously performed in n12 ways,
then the total number of ways of performing the procedure is
n1 + n2 −n12.
The Addition Principle is therefore a special case of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, as
n12 = 0 in that case. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion can also be stated in terms of ﬁnite sets
(as we indicated above).
The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (for two sets) For every two ﬁnite sets A and B,
|A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∩B|.
In particular, if A and B are disjoint, then |A ∪B| = |A| + |B|.
The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion is often attributed to the French mathematician Abraham
de Moivre. Although famous for a number of accomplishments in mathematics, he was one of the

8.2. THE PRINCIPLE OF INCLUSION-EXCLUSION
281
ﬁrst to use complex numbers in trigonometry. In fact, for the imaginary number i = √−1, de
Moivre’s formula states that
(cos x + i sin x)n = cos(nx) + i sin(nx)
for every real number x and every integer n. A set-theoretic version of the Principle of Inclusion-
Exclusion appeared in a 1718 textbook of de Moivre. The principle was used in 1713 by Pierre
R´emond de Montmort to solve a problem he formulated in 1708. The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion
was known to have been used by Nicholas (also occasionally spelled Nicolaus) Bernoulli, a member
of a large and distinguished family of Swiss mathematicians. The development of the principle is
due in large degree to James Joseph Sylvester; however, many mathematicians were not aware of
the principle until 1867 when it appeared in a book written by William Allen Whitworth.
We now consider some applications of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.
Example 8.15
How many 8-bit sequences begin with 110 or end with 1100?
Solution. We are considering 8-bit sequences of one of the types
1 1 0
or
1 1 0 0
By the Multiplication Principle, the number of 8-bit sequences that begin with 110 is 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 =
25 = 32 and the number of 8-bit sequences that end with 1100 is 2 · 2 · 2 · 2 = 24 = 16. Observe
that an 8-bit sequence could begin with 110 and end with 1100. Such a sequence has the following
appearance:
1 1 0
1 1 0 0
Therefore, the number of 8-bit sequences that begin with 110 and end with 1100 is 2. It then follows
by the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion that the number of 8-bit sequences with the desired property
is 32 + 16 −2 = 46.
♦
Example 8.16
In a discrete mathematics course there are 17 students majoring in computer science, 11 students
majoring in mathematics and 5 students majoring in both. How many students major in computer
science or mathematics?
Solution. Let C be the set of all students majoring in computer science and let M be the set of all
students majoring in mathematics. Then |C| = 17, |M| = 11 and |C ∩M| = 5. What we seek is
|C ∪M|. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,
|C ∪M| = |C| + |M| −|C ∩M| = 17 + 11 −5 = 23.
So there are 23 students majoring in computer science or mathematics.
♦
In the case of three pairwise disjoint sets A, B and C, the Addition Principle states that |A∪B ∪
C| = |A|+|B|+|C|. However, what if A, B and C are not pairwise disjoint? Figure 8.3 gives a Venn
diagram for three arbitrary sets A, B and C, where a denotes the number of elements belonging to
A but to neither B nor C (that is, there are a elements in A −(B ∪C)), r denotes the number of
elements in both A and B but not C and so on.
Therefore, |A ∪B ∪C| = a + b + c + r + s + t + x. Since
|A| = a + r + s + x, |B| = b + r + t + x and |C| = c + s + t + x,

Figure 8.3: A Venn diagram for sets A, B and C
it follows that
|A| + |B| + |C| = a + b + c + 2r + 2s + 2t + 3x ̸= |A ∪B ∪C|
if any of the integers r, s, t and x is not 0. Since |A∩B| = r +x, |A∩C| = s+x and |B ∩C| = t+x,
it follows that
|A| + |B| + |C| −|A ∩B| −|A ∩C| −|B ∩C| = a + b + c + r + s + t.
Because |A ∩B ∩C| = x, it follows that
|A| + |B| + |C| −|A ∩B| −|A ∩C| −|B ∩C| + |A ∩B ∩C| = a + b + c + r + s + t + x = |A ∪B ∪C|.
The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (for three sets) For every three ﬁnite sets A, B and C,
|A ∪B ∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| −|A ∩B| −|A ∩C| −|B ∩C| + |A ∩B ∩C|.
Example 8.17
The director of a dormitory cafeteria interviews 60 students to determine their likes and dislikes
among certain foods. Here is what she learned:
31 students like beef.
32 students like chicken.
31 students like ﬁsh.
15 students like beef and chicken.
12 students like beef and ﬁsh.
19 students like chicken and ﬁsh.
8 students like all three.
How many like none of these?
Solution. Let B be the set of students who like beef, C the set of students who like chicken and F
the set of students who like ﬁsh. By the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion,
|B ∪C ∪F|
=
|B| + |C| + |F| −|B ∩C| −|B ∩F| −|C ∩F| + |B ∩C ∩F|
=
31 + 32 + 31 −15 −12 −19 + 8 = 56.
Since 56 of the 60 students like at least one of beef, chicken and ﬁsh, there are 60 −56 = 4 students
who like none of these.
♦
The next example describes a problem where the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion does not appear
to work directly and which perhaps requires some thought.

8.2. THE PRINCIPLE OF INCLUSION-EXCLUSION
283
Example 8.18
A number of travelers are surveyed as to which of the three popular vacation cities Las Vegas, New
York City and Orlando they would like to visit. Here are their responses:
26 travelers want to visit Las Vegas.
31 travelers want to visit New York City.
36 travelers want to visit Orlando.
12 travelers want to visit Las Vegas and New York City.
11 travelers want to visit Las Vegas and Orlando.
13 travelers want to visit New York City and Orlando.
5 travelers want to visit all three.
How many of these travelers want to visit at least two of Las Vegas, New York City and Orlando?
Solution. With the information given, it would be a simple application of the Principle of Inclusion-
Exclusion to determine the number of travelers who want to visit at least one of Las Vegas (L), New
York City (N) and Orlando (R). But this is not the question. What we can do, however, is look at
the Venn diagram that represents this situation.

Figure 8.4: A Venn diagram for Example 8.18
Since 5 want to visit all three cities, there are 5 elements in the centermost region of the Venn
diagram. We now work in reverse order from the information given. Since 13 want to visit New York
City and Orlando but 5 want to visit all three cities, 13 −5 = 8 want to visit New York City and
Orlando but not Las Vegas. We place 8 in the corresponding region. Continuing in this manner, we
can ﬁll in the number of elements in other regions. (In fact, we could ﬁnd the numbers of elements
in all eight regions of the Venn diagram if this were useful.) In any case, the answer to the question
is 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26. We might also notice that the answer to this question is
|L ∩N| + |L ∩R| + |N ∩R| −2|L ∩N ∩R| = 12 + 11 + 13 −2 · 5 = 26. ♦
Perhaps the connection between the cardinality of the union of a ﬁnite number of ﬁnite sets and
the sum of the cardinalities of these sets is becoming clear. For example, in the case of four sets A,
B, C and D, the cardinality |A∪B ∪C ∪D| equals the sum of the cardinalities of the four sets minus
the sum of the cardinalities of the intersections of all pairs of the sets, plus the sum of cardinalities
of the intersections of all triples of the sets minus the cardinality of the intersection of all four sets –
thus the name: inclusion/exclusion (that is, we add, subtract, add, subtract and so on). In general,
we have the following.

CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
8.3
The Pigeonhole Principle
It is probably only common sense that if in a particular Olympic Games some athlete won four
Olympic medals (gold, silver or bronze), then at least two of these medals must be of the same kind.
In any collection of ﬁve integers, at least three are even or at least three are odd. In any set
of 12 integers, at least 6 of these 12 integers are even or at least 6 are odd. In fact, in any set
of 12 integers, at least 6 of these integers are even or at least 7 of these integers are odd. (If at
least 6 of these integers are not even, then at most 5 are even, implying that at least 7 are odd.)
These observations can be said more mathematically. In any ﬁnite set of integers, at least half of
the integers are even or at least half are odd. Recall, for a real number x, that the ceiling ⌈x⌉of x
is the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. Therefore, the observation we made above can be
stated as follows: For any set of n ≥1 integers, at least ⌈n/2⌉of these integers are even or at least
⌈n/2⌉are odd.
Let’s look at another example that is similar to those we have considered.
Example 8.19
A student has been collecting stamps for a number of years from England, France and Germany.
Regardless of how many stamps she has, at least one-third are from the same country. That is, if
she has n stamps, then at least ⌈n/3⌉stamps are from England, at least ⌈n/3⌉stamps are from
France or at least ⌈n/3⌉stamps are from Germany.
♦
All of these examples are special cases of what is commonly called the Pigeonhole Principle, one
version of which is stated next.
The Pigeonhole Principle If a set S with n elements is divided into k pairwise disjoint subsets
S1, S2, . . ., Sk, then at least one of these subsets has at least ⌈n/k⌉elements.
Before we give a proof of this principle, we note that 0 ≤⌈x⌉−x < 1 and so
x ≤⌈x⌉< x + 1
(8.2)
for every real number x. (See Exercise 22 in Section 4.4.)
Proof of the Pigeonhole Principle. Assume, to the contrary, that none of the sets S1, S2, . . .,
Sk has at least ⌈n/k⌉elements. Since ⌈n/k⌉is an integer, every one of the sets S1, S2, . . ., Sk has at
most ⌈n/k⌉−1 elements. By (8.2), ⌈n/k⌉−1 < n/k, that is, each of the sets S1, S2, . . ., Sk has less
than n/k elements. Since S1, S2, . . ., Sk are pairwise disjoint and S = S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sk, it follows
that
n = |S| = |S1 ∪S2 ∪· · · ∪Sk| = |S1| + |S2| + · · · + |Sk| < k(n/k) = n,
and so n < n. This is clearly impossible.
In its simplest form, the Pigeonhole Principle states that if n pigeons are placed into m pigeon-
holes, where m < n, then at least one pigeonhole must contain at least two pigeons. Many decades
ago, long before personal computers existed, some desks were built with small compartments, also
called pigeonholes, which were used for ﬁling papers, receipts, bills and the like.
Example 8.20
The desk shown in Figure 8.5 has 8 pigeonholes. By the Pigeonhole Principle, if 100 papers were
to be ﬁled in these pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain at least ⌈100/8⌉= 13
papers.
♦
The ﬁrst statement of this principle is believed to have been made in 1834 by Lejeune Dirichlet
under the name Schubfachprinzip (drawer principle). Indeed, many mathematicians referred to this
principle as Dirichlet’s principle.

Example 8.21
A teacher of a discrete mathematics course has 28 students.
(a) The teacher must assign each student one of the letter grades A, B, C, D, F. What is the
largest number of students who must be assigned the same grade?
(b) It is known that the ages of the students in class range from 16 to 43. What is the maximum
number of students in the class who must be the same age?
(c) In order to qualify for this discrete mathematics class, each student must have passed one of
three prerequisite courses. What is the maximum number of students in the class who must
have passed the same prerequisite course?
Solution.
(a) By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least ⌈28/5⌉= 6 students must be assigned the same grade.
Since there is no guarantee that 7 or more students will receive the same grade, it follows that
6 is the maximum.
(b) There are 28 integers in the range 16, 17, . . ., 43 (namely 43 −16 + 1 = 28). Therefore, the
maximum number of students who must be the same age is ⌈28/28⌉= 1. (Note: Of course,
this can only occur if there is exactly one student of each of the ages 16, 17, . . ., 43 – probably
not too likely.)
(c) The maximum number of students who must have passed the same prerequisite course is
⌈28/3⌉= 10. (Note: Again, the key word here is must. That is, there must be 10 students
who passed the same prerequisite course, but it is not necessary that there are 11 students
who passed the same prerequisite course.)
♦
One question related to the Pigeonhole Principle is the following: For given positive integers r
and k, what is the minimum cardinality N of a set S such that if S is divided into k subsets, then at
least one of these subsets has at least r elements? According to the Pigeonhole Principle, ⌈N/k⌉= r.
Since ⌈x⌉< x + 1 for every real number x, it follows that
r =
N
k

< N
k + 1
and so N
k > r−1 or N > k(r−1). Since N and k(r−1) are integers, this implies that N ≥k(r−1)+1.
Since N is the minimum integer with this property, N = k(r−1)+1. Therefore, we have the following:

288
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
Let r and k be positive integers. If N is the minimum cardinality of a set S such that
however S is divided into k subsets, at least one of these subsets must contain at least r
elements, then
N = k(r −1) + 1.

Example 8.22
(a) How many people are needed to be sure that at least two of them have a birthday during the
same month?
(b) How many people are needed to be sure that at least three of them have a birthday during
the same month?
Solution.
(a) Let N be the minimum number of people needed to guarantee that at least two of them have a
birthday during the same month. Since there are 12 months, it follows that ⌈N/12⌉= 2. The
smallest such integer N is 13 and so N = 13. Notice also that N = 1 · 12 + 1 = 13 by (8.3).
(b) Let N be the minimum number of people needed to guarantee that at least three of them have
a birthday during the same month. Thus ⌈N/12⌉= 3. The smallest such integer N is 25 and
so N = 25. Notice also that N = 2 · 12 + 1 = 25 by (8.3).
♦
A problem related to those given in Example 8.22 will be discussed in Section 10.2. We now
consider a more general example.
Example 8.23
An archaeologist collects ancient coins. He keeps a number of gold, silver and bronze coins in a desk
drawer in his oﬃce. In fact, this drawer contains 15 gold coins, 20 silver coins and 12 bronze coins.
He randomly takes 20 coins from the drawer to show his colleague. Show that he must have selected
at least 8 gold coins, at least 9 silver coins or at least 5 bronze coins.
Solution. If the archaeologist did not select at least 8 gold coins, at least 9 silver coins or at least
5 bronze coins, then he would have selected at most 7 gold coins, at most 8 silver coins and at
most 4 bronze coins. But this would mean that he selected at most 7 + 8 + 4 = 19 coins, which is
impossible.
♦
Example 8.23 illustrates a more general version of the Pigeonhole Principle.
The (General) Pigeonhole Principle
A set S with n elements is partitioned into k pairwise
disjoint subsets S1, S2, . . ., Sk, where |Si| ≥ni for a positive integer ni for i = 1, 2, . . ., k. Then
each subset of S with at least
1 +
k
X
i=1
(ni −1)
elements contains at least ni elements of Si for some integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k.
Proof. We use a proof by contradiction. Suppose that there is some subset A of S such that
|A| ≥1 +
k
X
i=1
(ni −1)
but A does not contain at least ni elements of Si for any i with 1 ≤i ≤k. Necessarily then, the set
A contains at most ni −1 elements of Si for every integer i. Then
|A| ≤
k
X
i=1
(ni −1) ≤|A| −1,

8.3. THE PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE
289
which is a contradiction.
In the (General) Pigeonhole Principle, if N is the minimum cardinality of a subset A of the set
S such that A contains at least ni elements of Si for some integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k, then
N = 1 +
k
X
i=1
(ni −1).

At a certain university, discrete mathematics is often taught as a large lecture class. Let’s suppose
that, on the average, 10% of the students receive A’s, 25% receive B’s, 40% receive C’s, 20% receive
D’s and 5% receive E’s. How many students would have to be in the class to be certain that the
professor assigns either 10 A’s, 25 B’s, 40 C’s, 20 D’s or 5 E’s?
Solution. According to the (General) Pigeonhole Principle, there would have to be at least
1 + (10 −1) + (25 −1) + (40 −1) + (20 −1) + (5 −1) = 96
students in the class.

Example 8.25
How many people are needed to be present at a party to be sure that at least 3 of them have a
birthday during June, at least 3 have a birthday during July, at least 3 have a birthday during
August or at least 4 of them have a birthday during the same month for one of the other months?
Solution. By the (General) Pigeonhole Principle, the smallest number of people needed to be present
at the party is 1 + 2 · 3 + 3 · 9 = 34.
♦
The Pigeonhole Principle can also be used to solve other types of problems.
Example 8.26
For a positive integer n, let S = {1, 2, . . ., 2n}.
(a) Show that S contains a subset S′ with |S′| = n such that for every two distinct elements a
and b in S′, a ∤b and b ∤a.
(b) Show that for each subset A of S, where |A| = n + 1, there exist distinct elements a, b ∈A
such that a | b.
Solution.
(a) Let S′ = {n+1, n+2, . . ., 2n}. Then |S′| = n. Let a and b be two distinct elements of S′, where,
say, n + 1 ≤a < b ≤2n. Then b ∤a. Observe that a ≥n + 1 and so b ≤2n < 2(n + 1) ≤2a.
Since b < 2a, it follows that a ∤b as well.
(b) Proof.
Let A ⊆S with |A| = n + 1. For each x ∈A, we write x = x′ · 2k, where x′ is an odd
integer (with x′ ∈S) and k is a nonnegative integer. Hence x′ is the largest odd integer divisor
of x. Since there are exactly n odd integers in S (namely 1, 3, . . . , 2n −1) and |A| = n + 1,
it follows by the Pigeonhole Principle that there are two distinct integers a and b in A (with
a < b say) having the same largest odd integer divisor c. Thus
a = c · 2i and b = c · 2j,
where 0 ≤i < j and so

290
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
b = c · 2j = 2j−i(c · 2i) = 2j−ia.
Since 2j−i is an integer, it follows that a | b.
We give one additional application of the Pigeonhole Principle.
Example 8.27
A graduate student serves as a mathematics tutor during a semester. Each day, including Saturday
and Sunday, she has set aside some 1-hour periods for tutoring. She charges $10 per hour. During
the last 20 days of the semester, she tutored a total of 28 hours and at least one hour each day.
Show that there was a certain period of consecutive days when she earned exactly $100.
Solution. Let d1 be the number of hours she tutored on the ﬁrst day of the 20 days, d2 the number
of hours she tutored on the ﬁrst two days and more generally, for 1 ≤i ≤20, let di denotes the
number of hours she tutored during the ﬁrst i days. Since she tutored at least one hour per day,
1 ≤d1 < d2 < · · · < d20 = 28,
that is, the 20 numbers d1, d2, . . . , d20 are distinct. Notice also that
d1 + 10 < d2 + 10 < . . . < d20 + 10 = 38.
That is, the 20 numbers d1 +10, d2 +10, . . ., d20 +10 are also distinct. Since the 40 positive integers
d1, d2, . . . , d20, d1 + 10, d2 + 10, . . . , d20 + 10
are all at most 38, it follows by the Pigeonhole Principle that at least two of these 40 numbers are
equal. Since no two of the integers d1, d2, . . . , d20 are equal and no two of the integers d1 + 10, d2 +
10, . . . , d20 + 10 are equal, some integer dj must equal some integer dk + 10, where 1 ≤k < j ≤20.
That is, dj = dk + 10 and so dj −dk = 10. This says that during the j −k days following day k, she
tutored for exactly 10 hours and therefore earned exactly $100.

8.4
Permutations and Combinations
In the previous three sections, we introduced four counting principles, namely the Multiplication
Principle, the Addition Principle, the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and the Pigeonhole Principle.
These were used to answer several questions concerning the enumeration of objects possessing some
speciﬁed properties. We now see how these principles can be used to solve more varied counting
problems. Most of these problems deal with two fundamental concepts in discrete mathematics:
permutations and combinations.
Many of the counting problems that we will encounter deal with the number of certain types
of subsets of a given set S or the number of ways to order some or all of the elements of S. For
example, suppose that there is a faculty position available in a department in a university and that
20 people apply for this position. The “Search Committee” for this position is required to select
eight of the 20 applicants for what is called their “short list,” from which a person will be selected
for the position. In how many ways can eight of the 20 applicants be selected? The Dean then
informs the Committee that they are permitted to invite ﬁve of these eight applicants for on-campus
interviews. In how many ways can this be done? After the ﬁve on-campus interviews take place, the
Dean then asks the Department to submit its preferred ranked list of three of these ﬁve applicants.
One way for the Committee to determine the preferred ranking by the Department is to list all
possible orderings of three of the ﬁve applicants and have each Department member vote for which
of these he or she prefers. In how many ways can three of these ﬁve applicants be ordered? In order
to describe how to answer questions such as these (see Exercise 23), we begin with a fundamental
concept.
Permutations
Deﬁnition 8.28
A permutation of a nonempty set S is an arrangement or ordered list of the
elements of S.
When dealing with a permutation of a set S, we sometimes refer to this as well as a permuta-
tion of the elements of S. The ﬁrst appearance in print of the word permutation with its current
mathematical meaning is due to Jacques Bernoulli, a member of a famous mathematical family.

8.4. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS
293
Example 8.29
Consider the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4}. One permutation of S is 2, 1, 3, 4 (or 2134). That is, when
expressing permutations, at times we separate the elements in a permutation by commas while at
other times it may be more convenient not to do this. In fact, all of the permutations of the set S
are listed below:
1234
2134
3124
4123
1243
2143
3142
4132
1324
2314
3214
4213
1342
2341
3241
4231
1423
2413
3412
4312
1432
2431
3421
4321
Therefore, there are 24 permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4 (if you agree that we haven’t missed
or duplicated any permutation). We now explain why there are 24 permutations without actually
listing them all. It is important that we learn how to compute the number of permutations of a set
without having to list them since it is clearly not practical to list all permutations of a set having a
large number of elements. To make an ordered list of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, we need to ﬁll in four
positions, say
with distinct elements of {1, 2, 3, 4}. Let’s see how many ways there are of doing this. There are
four possible numbers for the ﬁrst position. Once we’ve decided on the number for the ﬁrst position,
we have three choices remaining for the number in the second position. Continuing this, we see that
there are two possible numbers for the third position and only one number for the last position.
Therefore, by the Multiplication Principle, the number of permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4 is
4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 4! = 24. A tree diagram illustrating how the permutations of S = {1, 2, 3, 4} can be
obtained is shown in Figure 8.6.

permutations of the set {1, 2, 3, 4}
More generally, for each positive integer n, the number of permutations of the integers 1, 2, . . ., n
(or of any n objects) is given by
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · 3 · 2 · 1 = n! (n factorial).
Example 8.30
The number of permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 is 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 5! = 120.
♦
You might recall that we have encountered the term “permutation” earlier in another context in
Section 4.2 and may wonder why we are using the same term to mean something else. Let us ﬁrst
remind ourselves where we saw and how we used this term before. For a (nonempty) set A, a function
f from A to A that is bijective (that is, f is both one-to-one and onto) is called a permutation of
A. Suppose that A = {1, 2, 3, 4}. An example of a permutation of A is the function

294
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
g = {(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)}.
In particular, for this function the image of 1 is 3, the image of 2 is 2, the image of 3 is 4 and the
image of 4 is 1. Consequently, we know how the function (permutation) g is deﬁned once we know
the images of the elements of A, that is, once we know that
g(1) = 3, g(2) = 2, g(3) = 4 and g(4) = 1.
The function g is therefore completely determined by the sequence 3, 2, 4, 1 of images of 1, 2, 3, 4,
respectively. That is, both interpretations of permutation have the same meaning.
As we saw in our opening discussion concerning ordering three applicants of the ﬁve applicants
interviewed, there are occasions when we are not interested in ordered lists of all elements of a set
S but only in ordered lists of a certain number of elements of S.
Example 8.31
Suppose that we wish to know the number of ordered lists of two elements of the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4}.
There are 12 such ordered lists, namely
12
21
31
41
13
23
32
42
14
24
34
43
In this example, we were asked only for the number of such lists, not to display these lists.
This number can be determined by another application of the Multiplication Principle. We are
looking at sequences
of two distinct numbers, chosen from 1, 2, 3, 4. For the ﬁrst number in
the sequence, there are four possibilities. Once this choice has been made, there are three possible
numbers for the second number in the sequence. Hence the total number of sequences of two elements
from a 4-element set is 4 · 3 = 12.
♦
More generally, if we are seeking the number of ordered lists of r elements of an n-element set
(where then 1 ≤r ≤n), we are considering sequences of r elements:
. . .
position 1
position 2
position 3
· · ·
position r −1
position r
There are n choices for the element in the ﬁrst position of the sequence. Once this element has been
chosen, there are n −1 possibilities for the element in the second position and n −2 possibilities for
the element in the third position. Continuing in this manner, we see that the number of possibilities
for an element in position r −1 is n −(r −2) = n −r + 2 and ﬁnally, the number of possibilities
for an element to be placed in position r is n −(r −1) = n −r + 1. Again, by the Multiplication
Principle, the total number of sequences of length r whose elements are chosen from an n-element
set is
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −r + 2)(n −r + 1).
(8.4)
This number can be expressed more simply and probably be remembered more easily by multiplying
the expression in (8.4) by (n −r)!/(n −r)!, that is,
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −r + 2)(n −r + 1)
=
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −r + 2)(n −r + 1)(n −r)!
(n −r)!
=
n!
(n −r)!.
You may recognize this number, which is the number of ordered lists of r elements of an n-element
set, as appearing in Theorem 8.7 and giving the number of diﬀerent one-to-one functions from an
r-element set to an n-element set.

8.4. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS
295
Deﬁnition 8.32
An ordered list of r elements of an n-element set S is called an r-permutation
of the elements of S. The number of r-permutations of an n-element set is denoted by P(n, r).
Let’s summarize what we’ve just discovered.
Theorem 8.33
The number of r-permutations of an n-element set (where 1 ≤r ≤n) is
P(n, r) = n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (n −r + 2)(n −r + 1) =
n!
(n −r)!.
For the case when r = n, we are interested in the n-permutations or more simply the permuta-
tions, of an n-element set. The number of these permutations is
P(n, n) =
n!
(n −n)! = n!
0! .
Since 0! is deﬁned as 1, we have P(n, n) = n!, which is the desired answer. Consequently,
P(n, n) = n!
0! = n!.
Example 8.34
How many diﬀerent arrangements of the ﬁve vowels a, e, i, o, u are there?
Solution. Since we are seeking the number of permutations of a 5-element set, this number is given
as P(5, 5) = 5! = 120.
♦
Example 8.35
Let S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}.
(a) Give two examples of permutations of S.
(b) How many permutations of S are there?
(c) Give two examples of 4-permutations of S.
(d) How many 4-permutations of S are there?
Solution.
(a) Two permutations of S are a b c d e f g and g f e d c b a.
(b) P(7, 7) = 7! = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1 = 5040.
(c) Two 4-permutations of S are a b c d and g e c a.
(d) P(7, 4) =
7!
(7 −4)! = 7!
3! = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1
3 · 2 · 1
= 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 = 42 · 20 = 840.
♦
Example 8.36
Seven students, namely 4 men and 3 women, are to present their solutions to seven diﬀerent problems
in class.
(a) In how many diﬀerent orderings can this be done?
(b) In how many orderings can these presentations be made if the presentations are to alternate
between men and women?

296
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
(c) In how many orderings can these presentations be made if the women are to present their
problems consecutively and the men are to present their problems consecutively?
Solution.
(a) P(7, 7) = 7! = 5040.
(b) Necessarily, the ﬁrst and the last presentations must be made by men and appear as:
man, woman, man, woman, man, woman, man.
By the Multiplication Principle, the number of diﬀerent orderings is 4 · 3 · 3 · 2 · 2 · 1 · 1 = 144.
(c) If the 4 men present their solutions ﬁrst, then, according to the Multiplication Principle, the
number of orderings is (4!)(3!) = 144. If the 3 women present their solutions ﬁrst, then, again
by the Multiplication Principle, the number of orderings is (3!)(4!) = 144. By the Addition
Principle, the total number of orderings satisfying the conditions is 144 + 144 = 288.
♦
Example 8.37
Seven graduating seniors majoring in computer science have applied for three positions with a well-
known software company. One position is a permanent position with the company, one is a 2-year
position and the other is a visiting research position. Assuming that three of the seven applicants
are hired for these positions, how many outcomes are possible?
Solution. We can think of ﬁlling in the three slots
permanent
2-year
visiting
There are 7 choices for the ﬁrst slot (position), 6 choices for the second position once the ﬁrst position
has been ﬁlled and then 5 choices for the third position once the ﬁrst two positions have been ﬁlled.
By the Multiplication Principle, the number of possible outcomes is 7 · 6 · 5 = 210. Notice also that
the answer to this question is the number of 3-permutations of the set of 7 applicants. This number
is therefore
P(7, 3) =
7!
(7 −3)! = 7!
4! = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4!
4!
= 7 · 6 · 5 = 210.
Consequently, these two methods give the same answer (as they should).
♦
Combinations
Whenever we talk about permutations or r-permutations of a set S, we are concerned with
sequences, arrangements or ordered lists of r elements of S. That is, order is important – the order
in which the elements are written matters. These are not the only kinds of questions in which we
are interested, however.
Example 8.38
How many subsets of the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} contain exactly two elements?
Solution. The 2-element subsets of A are
{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}
and so the answer to this question is 6.
♦

8.4. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS
297
Example 8.39
How many 3-element subsets of the set B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are there?
Solution. Since the 3-element subsets of B are
{1, 2, 3},
{1, 2, 4},
{1, 2, 5},
{1, 3, 4},
{1, 3, 5},
{1, 4, 5},
{2, 3, 4},
{2, 3, 5},
{2, 4, 5},
{3, 4, 5},
the answer to this question is 10.
♦
While order is important for questions pertaining to permutations order is not relevant for the
questions asked in Examples 8.38 and 8.39, as the order in which elements are written in subsets does
not matter. Furthermore, the questions in Examples 8.38 and 8.39 asked for the number of subsets
of a certain type. We were not asked to list all these subsets. Yet, this is the way we answered these
questions. Since this will not always be practical and it is far too easy to make errors listing subsets,
we need another approach to answer these questions.
For a set S with n elements, we denote the number of subsets of S with exactly r elements, where
0 ≤r ≤n, by C(n, r). From Examples 8.38 and 8.39, we see that C(4, 2) = 6 and C(5, 3) = 10.
Deﬁnition 8.40
Let S be an n-element set. An r-element subset of S, where 0 ≤r ≤n, is called
an r-combination of S. Therefore, the number of r-combinations of an n-element set is C(n, r).
An r-combination is also referred to as an unordered list of r-elements or as an r-selection.
The ﬁrst known use of the word combination with the meaning we just described evidently
occurred in a letter dated July 29, 1654 written by Blaise Pascal to another famous French mathe-
matician, Pierre de Fermat.
Let S = {a1, a2, . . . , an} be an n-element set and let T be one of the C(n, r) r-element subsets
(r-combinations) of S, where 1 ≤r ≤n. One possible choice for T is {a1, a2, . . . , ar}. The number of
ways to order the r elements of T is r!. Consequently, the number of ways of ordering all r-element
subsets of S is r!C(n, r); however, this is the number of r-permutations of S, which we know is
P(n, r). Therefore,
r!C(n, r) = P(n, r) =
n!
(n −r)!.
Solving for C(n, r), we have
C(n, r) =
n!
r!(n −r)!.
Notice that when r = 0 or r = n, we have
C(n, 0) =
n!
0! n! = 1
and
C(n, n) =
n!
n! 0! = 1.
Since there is only one 0-element subset (namely the empty set) and only one n-element subset
(namely the set S), this expression gives the expected answer when r = 0 and when r = n as well.
In mathematics, a common symbol for the number of r-element subsets of an n-element set is
 n
r

, which is read as “n choose r” to indicate that we are choosing or selecting r-element subsets of
an n-element set. Consequently, C(n, r) and
 n
r

represent the same number. Since both symbols are
commonly used, we should be familiar with both and will use them interchangeably. Let’s summarize
what we’ve just discovered.
Theorem 8.41
For integers r and n with 0 ≤r ≤n, the number of r-element subsets of an
n-element set (also called r-combinations or r-selections of an n-element set) is
C(n, r) =
n
r

=
n!
r!(n −r)!.

These two numbers agree, of course, with our answers to the questions in Examples 8.38 and 8.39.
Example 8.42
Determine the number of 4-element subsets of the set A = {1, 2, . . ., 7} and the number of 6-element
subsets of the set B = {1, 2, . . ., 8}.
Solution. The number of 4-element subsets of A is

Example 8.43
A certain committee is required to meet 3 days during each February (not on weekends however).
If the coming February does not occur during a leap year, how many diﬀerent choices for meeting
days are there?
Solution. Since the coming February does not occur during a leap year, there are exactly 4 weeks
during the month, each week containing ﬁve weekdays. Therefore, there are exactly 20 weekdays.
The total number of choices for meeting days (3-combinations) is

Example 8.44
A student is trying to remember a classmate’s 7-digit telephone number. He recalls that the ﬁrst
digit is 7 and then there are three 1s and three 3s in some order. How many telephone calls would
he have to make to be certain that he ﬁnally calls his friend’s telephone number?
Solution. Since he knows the ﬁrst digit is 7, only the remaining six digits are in doubt. He knows
that three of these six digits are 1 and the remaining three digits are 3. Once he has determined the
locations of the 1s in the 7-digit telephone number, he knows the exact number. Since there are 6
possible locations for the three 1s, the maximum number of phone calls he would have to make is
C(6, 3) =

3! 3! = 6 · 5 · 4 · 3!

Actually, equation (8.5) is not surprising, as we now see. We know that

is the number of all subsets of a 4-element set. However,
this number is 24 = 16 since, as we have seen in Sections 2.1 and 5.2, the number of subsets of an
n-element set is 2n. Therefore, more generally, we have the following.
Theorem 8.45

As we have seen, for each integer n ≥0, the number
 n
0

= 1 since there is only one 0-element
subset (the empty subset) of any set. Also,
 n
n

= 1 since there is only one n-element subset of an
n-element set, namely the set itself. Suppose that S is a set with n ≥1 elements. The 1-element
subsets of S are the sets {x}, where x ∈S. Since there are n such subsets,
 n
1

= n. Furthermore,
  n
n−1

also equals n for when we consider the subsets of S containing exactly n−1 elements, then we
are leaving out exactly one element from the set S. Since there are
 n
1

= n choices for the element
of S to leave out when constructing an (n −1)-element subset of S, it follows that
  n
n−1

= n. More
generally, we have the following result. We give two proofs of this result, the ﬁrst of which is a
“combinatorial” proof and the second an algebraic proof.
Theorem 8.46
For every two integers r and n with 0 ≤r ≤n,
C(n, r) = C(n, n −r)
or
n
r

=

n
n −r

.
Proof #1. Observe that C(n, r) is the number of r-element subsets of an n-element set S. However,
for each choice of r elements of S belonging to a subset, there are n −r elements of S not belonging
to the subset. Therefore, C(n, r) = C(n, n −r).
Proof #2. The number of subsets with n −r elements in an n-element set is
C(n, n −r)
=
n!
(n −r)![n −(n −r)]! =
n!
(n −r)!r!
=
n!
r!(n −r)! = C(n, r),
as desired.

How many subsets of S = {1, 2, . . ., 8} contain three or more elements?

which is 56 + 70 + 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 219.
There is, however, a somewhat simpler way to answer this question. The total number of subsets
of S is 28 = 256. The number of subsets of S with 0, 1 and 2 elements is

Applications of Permutations and Combinations
In order to gain a better understanding of how permutations and combinations can be used to solve
certain counting problems, we consider a variety of examples.
Example 8.49
A committee of 5 is to consist of 3 faculty members and 2 students. The 3 faculty members are to be
chosen from 6 eligible faculty members and the 2 students are to be chosen from 5 eligible students.
How many diﬀerent committees are possible?
Solution. Constructing such a committee can be considered as performing a procedure that consists
of the task of choosing 3 faculty members for the committee followed by the task of choosing 2
students for the committee. Since the number of ways of choosing 3 faculty members from the 6
eligible faculty members is C(6, 3) =
6!
3! 3! = 20 and the number of ways of choosing 2 students
from the 5 eligible students is C(5, 2) = 5·4
2 = 10, it follows by the Multiplication Principle that the
number of ways of selecting the entire committee is 20 · 10 = 200.
♦
Example 8.50
A total of 6 seniors and 5 juniors have been nominated for a 6-person committee, which is to consist
of 3 seniors and 3 juniors. One senior will be chosen as president, one as vice-president, and one as
secretary. The three juniors will not have any special title. How many such committees are possible?
Solution. There are 6 ways to select a senior to be president. Once this person has been chosen, there
are 5 choices for the senior who will be vice-president. After these two selections have been made,
there are 4 possible choices for the senior who will be secretary. By the Multiplication Principle,
the total number of ways of selecting 3 seniors to serve in these positions for the committee is
6 · 5 · 4 = 120. This number is also P(6, 3). Moreover, there are C(5, 3) = C(5, 2) = 5·4
2 = 10 ways
of selecting 3 juniors for the committee. Again, by the Multiplication Principle, the total number of
ways of selecting such a 6-person committee is 120 · 10 = 1200.
♦
Example 8.51
A total of 6 freshmen, 5 sophomores and 4 juniors have volunteered to serve on a 4-person committee.
How many such committees are possible if

8.5. APPLICATIONS OF PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS
303
(a) any student may serve on the committee?
(b) at least one freshman, at least one sophomore and at least one junior must serve on the
committee?
(c) at least one freshman must serve on the committee?
Solution.
(a) Since any of the 15 students may serve on the committee, the number of possible 4-person
committees is
15
4

=
15!
4! 11! = 15 · 14 · 13 · 12
4 · 3 · 2
= 1365.
(b) In this case, the make-up of the committee must be one of the following types:
(1) two freshmen, one sophomore and one junior.
(2) one freshman, two sophomores and one junior.
(3) one freshman, one sophomore and two juniors.
The number of 4-person committees
of type (1) is
 6
2
 5
1
 4


= 15 · 5 · 4 = 300,
of type (2) is

of type (3) is
 6
1
 5
1
 4
2

= 6 · 5 · 6 = 180.
Thus the total number of such committees is 300 + 240 + 180 = 720.
(c) In this case, we could compute the number of committees containing (1) exactly one freshman,
(2) exactly two freshmen, (3) exactly three freshmen or (4) exactly four freshmen.
These
numbers are, respectively,
 6
1
 9
3

= 6 · 84 = 504,

1

= 20 · 9 = 180 and
 6
4
 9
0

= 15 · 1 = 15.
Thus the total number of such committees is 504 + 540 + 180 + 15 = 1239.
There is, however, another way to compute this number. The number of committees with
no freshmen is
9
4

=
9!
4! 5! = 126.
Therefore, the number of committees with at least one freshman is
15
4

−
9
4

= 1365 −126 = 1239.
♦
Before looking at another example, a remark concerning the solution of question (b) in Exam-
ple 8.51 might be useful. When determining the number of 4-person committees with at least one
freshman, at least one sophomore and at least one junior, you may have thought of selecting one
freshman, one sophomore, one junior and one from the remaining 12 students, giving the answer
6
1
5
1
4
1
12


= 6 · 5 · 4 · 12 = 1440.
(8.7)
This, of course, is not the same answer we obtained in our solution of (b); in fact, it is twice the
number we obtained. The number in (8.7) does not give the correct answer to (b). In order to see why
this is so, suppose that the 6 freshmen who volunteered for the committee are F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6,
the 5 sophomores are S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and the 4 juniors are J1, J2, J3, J4. One of the committees we

304
CHAPTER 8. INTRODUCTION TO COUNTING
should be counting in the solution of (b) is {F1, F2, S1, J1}. This is counted in the solution of (b) we
gave. However, in the “solution” described in the number in (8.7), one of the six freshmen is selected,
say F1, one sophomore is selected, say S1, and one junior is selected, say J1. Then one student is
selected who has not already been selected, say F2. So the committee {F1, S1, J1, F2} is counted
in (8.7). However, when one of the 6 freshmen is selected, we may have chosen F2 instead, then
selected one sophomore, namely S1 and selected one junior, namely J1. Then a student is selected
who has not already be chosen. One possibility is F1. This counts the committee {F2, S1, J1, F1}
for a second time. Indeed, every committee is counted twice in (8.7). The lesson here is that care
must be taken in solving problems of this kind.
After studying Example 8.51, let’s now look at a related example.
Example 8.52
A total of 5 seniors, 4 juniors and 3 sophomores have been nominated to serve on a 3-person
committee. How many diﬀerent committees are possible if
(a) there is no restriction on membership?
(b) the committee must consist of one senior, one junior and one sophomore?
(c) at least one senior must be on the committee?
Solution.
(a) Since there is no restriction on who can serve on the 3-person committee, the number of
possible 3-person committees is
 12
3

=
12!
3! 9! = 12·11·10
6
= 220.
(b) There are 5 choices for the senior who would serve on the committee, 4 choices for the junior
and 3 choices for the sophomore. By the Multiplication Principle, the number of possible
3-person committees is 5 · 4 · 3 = 60. This can also be expressed as
 5
1
 4
1
 3
1

= 5 · 4 · 3 = 60.
(c) To answer this question, we could compute the number of possible 3-person committees con-
taining exactly one senior, the number of possible 3-person committees containing exactly two
seniors and the number of possible 3-person committees consisting entirely of seniors and then
add these three numbers. An alternative, however, is to compute the number of possible 3-
person committees containing no seniors. This number is
 7
3

=
7!
3! 4! = 35. By (a) the number
of possible 3-person committees with no restriction is
 12
3

= 220. Hence the number of possible
3-person committees with at least one senior is
 12

= 220 −35 = 185.
♦
Example 8.53
A total of 3 freshmen, 5 sophomores, 3 juniors and 4 seniors are eligible for a $3000 scholarship, a
$2000 scholarship and a $1000 scholarship.
(a) How many distributions of scholarships are there if none go to a freshman?
(b) How many distributions of scholarships are there if at least two must go to seniors?
(c) How many distributions of scholarships are there if no two students from the same class can
receive a scholarship?
Solution.
(a) There are 12 students who are not freshmen.
So there are 12 choices for the recipient of
the $3000 scholarship. Once the recipient of this scholarship has been determined, there are
11 choices for the recipient of the $2000 scholarship and then 10 choices for the recipient of
the $1000 scholarship. By the Multiplication Principle, the number of distributions of these
scholarships is 12 · 11 · 10 = 1320. This number is also P(12, 3) = 1320.

(b) If at least two scholarships must go to seniors, then either all three scholarships go to seniors or
exactly two scholarships go to seniors. If all three scholarships go to seniors, then the number
of distributions of scholarships is P(4, 3) = 4 · 3 · 2 = 24. Next, suppose that exactly two schol-
arships go to seniors. If seniors are awarded the $3000 and $2000 scholarships (equivalently,
one of the 11 non-seniors is awarded the $1000 scholarship), then the number of distributions
of scholarships is 4·3·11 = 132. Since there are 3 possible scholarships that can be distributed
to a non-senior, the number of distributions of scholarships that could be awarded to exactly
two seniors is 3 · 132 = 396. By the Addition Principle, the total number of distributions of
scholarships such that at least two go to seniors is 24 + 396 = 420.
(c) There are four possibilities according to which class has no student receiving a scholarship.
First, suppose that no senior receives a scholarship. If a freshmen receives the $3000 scholar-
ship, a sophomore receives the $2000 scholarship and a junior receives the $1000 scholarship,
then the number of possibilities is 3 · 5 · 3 = 45. Since there are 3! = 6 ways of arranging (per-
muting) these three classes, the number of distributions of scholarships that no senior receives
is 6 · 45 = 270. Similarly, the number of distributions of scholarships that no junior receives is
6 · (3 · 5 · 4) = 360; the number of distributions of scholarships when only a sophomore receives
no scholarship is 6 · (3 · 3 · 4) = 216; and the number of distributions of scholarships when only
a freshmen receives no scholarship is 6 · (5 · 3 · 4) = 360. By the Addition Principle, the total
number of distributions of scholarships in this case is 270 + 360 + 216 + 360 = 1206.

Example 8.54
From a group of 5 men and 7 women in a company, 4 are to be chosen as branch managers in 4
diﬀerent cities. How many diﬀerent appointments can be made if
(a) every person is eligible?
(b) only the women are eligible?
(c) two men and two women are to be appointed?
(d) at least three women are to be appointed?
Solution.
(a) Since every person is eligible and the cities are diﬀerent, the number of diﬀerent appointments
is P(12, 4) = 12 · 11 · 10 · 9 = 11, 880.
(b) Since only the women are eligible, the number of diﬀerent appointments is P(7, 4) = 7·6·5·4 =
840.
(c) Suppose that we denote the cities by A, B, C and D. First, suppose that men are chosen as
branch managers in A and B and women are chosen as branch managers in C and D. Then
the number of diﬀerent appointments is P(5, 2) · P(7, 2) = 5 · 4 · 7 · 6 = 840. Since there are
C(4, 2) =
 4
2

= 6 pairs of cities where men (or women) can be branch managers, the total
number of diﬀerent appointments is 6 · 840 = 5040 (by the Multiplication Principle).
(d) If at least three women are to be appointed as branch managers, then either all branch managers
are women or exactly three branch managers will be women. If all four branch managers are
women, then the number of appointments is P(7, 4) = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4 = 840 as we saw in (b).
Suppose that exactly three women are branch managers of the four cities. If three women
are branch managers in A, B and C (equivalently, a man is the branch manager only in D),
then the number of appointments is P(7, 3) · P(5, 1) = 7 · 6 · 5 · 5 = 1050. Since there are
C(4, 1) = 4 possibilities for the city in which the man is the branch manager, the number of
appointments is 4·(1050) = 4200. By the Addition Principle, the total number of appointments
is 840 + 4200 = 5040.

Key Results
• The Multiplication Principle: A procedure consists of a sequence of two tasks. To perform
this procedure, one performs the ﬁrst task followed by performing the second task. If there
are n1 ways to perform the ﬁrst task and n2 ways to perform the second task after the ﬁrst
task has been performed, then there are n1n2 ways to perform the procedure.
• The (General) Multiplication Principle: Performing a certain procedure consists of per-
forming a sequence of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm. If there are ni ways of performing Ti after
any preceding tasks have been performed for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, then the total number of ways of
performing the procedure is n1n2 · · · nm.
• The Addition Principle: A procedure consists of two tasks that cannot be performed
simultaneously. To perform this procedure, either of the two tasks is performed. If the ﬁrst
task can be performed in n1 ways and the second can be performed in n2 ways, then the
number of ways of performing this procedure is n1 + n2.
• The (General) Addition Principle: Performing a certain procedure consists of performing
one of m ≥2 tasks T1, T2, . . ., Tm, no two of which can be performed at the same time. If the
task Ti can be performed in ni ways for 1 ≤i ≤m, then the number of ways of performing
this procedure is n1 + n2 + · · · + nm.
• The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion: A procedure consists of two tasks. To perform the
procedure, one performs either of the two tasks. If the ﬁrst task can be performed in n1 ways,
the second task can be performed in n2 ways and the two tasks can be simultaneously performed
in n12 ways, then the total number of ways of performing the procedure is n1 + n2 −n12.
• The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (for two sets): For every two ﬁnite sets A and B,
|A ∪B| = |A| + |B| −|A ∩B|.
In particular, if A and B are disjoint, then |A ∪B| = |A| + |B|.
• The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (for three sets): For every three ﬁnite sets A, B
and C,
|A ∪B ∪C| = |A| + |B| + |C| −|A ∩B| −|A ∩C| −|B ∩C| + |A ∩B ∩C|.
• The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (for n ≥2 sets): Let A1, A2, . . . , An be n ≥2 ﬁnite
sets, then

• The Pigeonhole Principle: If a set S with n elements is divided into k pairwise disjoint
subsets S1, S2, . . ., Sk, then at least one of these subsets contains at least ⌈n/k⌉elements.
• Let r and k be positive integers. If N is the minimum cardinality of a set S such that however
S is divided into k subsets, at least one of these subsets must contain at least r elements, then
N = k(r −1) + 1.
• The (General) Pigeonhole Principle: A set S with n elements is divided into k pairwise
disjoint subsets S1, S2, . . ., Sk, where |Si| ≥ni for a positive integer ni for i = 1, 2, . . ., k.
Then each subset of S with at least 1 + Pk
i=1(ni −1) elements contains at least ni elements
of Si for some integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k

Chapter 9
Advanced Counting Methods
In Chapter 8 we introduced four counting principles, namely the Multiplication Principle, the Addi-
tion Principle, the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion and the Pigeonhole Principle. These were used
to answer several questions concerning the enumeration of objects possessing some speciﬁed prop-
erties. In Chapter 8, we also introduced the concepts of permutations and combinations, which are
fundamental in solving certain kinds of counting problems. In this chapter, we consider even more
varied counting problems.
9.1
The Pascal Triangle and the Binomial Theorem
Considering that he lived for only 39 years, it is quite remarkable how much the French mathe-
matician and physicist Blaise Pascal accomplished. He was fascinated with geometry during his
early teens and discovered several geometric facts on his own. Pascal’s father was employed as a
tax collector. In order to help his father, Pascal spent the 3-year period 1642-1645 attempting to
invent a digital calculator, which he succeeded in doing. This device, called the Pascaline, became
the ﬁrst digital calculator. He is quite possibly the second person to invent a mechanical calculator.
The German mathematician and astronomer Wilhelm Schickard had invented one in 1623. In 1968
a programming language (PASCAL) was named for him.
The Pascal Triangle
What most people in mathematics probably think of when they hear the name “Pascal” is the
Pascal triangle. The Pascal triangle is a certain triangular array of positive integers. One way to
construct this triangle is to begin with an inﬁnite row of 1s. Under this row are the positive integers
in their natural order 1, 2, 3, . . .. The next few rows are shown in Figure 9.1. There are patterns to
each row. It may not be so easy to see what these patterns are, but we’ll describe them now.
Once a certain number of rows of positive integers have been listed in the Pascal triangle, each
number in the next row is obtained from the row immediately above it by adding those numbers
directly above and to the left of it. Rotating Figure 9.1 clockwise 45o and adjusting the entries
appropriately produces the Pascal triangle, as it is usually shown (in Figure 9.2).
Although the triangular array of integers given in Figure 9.2 is named for Pascal, he was cer-

Figure 9.3: The Pascal triangle revisited
The numbers in the Pascal triangle have many interesting and unexpected properties. We have
already mentioned in Theorem 8.46 that for every two integers r and n with 0 ≤r ≤n,
n
r

=

n
n −r

.
One interpretation of this is that each row of the Pascal triangle is symmetric about the middle num-
ber or middle two numbers in the row (see Figure 9.4). So once we know the left half (approximately)
of a row in the Pascal triangle, we can easily complete the entire row.
If we look at any integer that is not 1 in the Pascal triangle in Figure 9.2, we see that it is the
sum of the two numbers directly above and on either side of it. For example, the 3rd number in row

we see that this says

. In general, we have the following.
Theorem 9.1
For integers r and n with 1 ≤r ≤n −1,
n
r

=
n −1


+
n −1

.
Proof. Let S be an n-element set, say S = {a1, a2, . . . , an}. The number of r-element subsets of S
is therefore
 n
r

. Of course, some of these subsets contain the element an, while the others do not.
Let’s determine the number of r-element subsets of S that contain an. Since one of the r elements
is an, the remaining r −1 elements are to be chosen from the set {a1, a2, . . . , an−1} and the number
of such subsets of S is
 n−1
r−1

.
Next we determine the number of r-element subsets of S that do not contain an. Then the r
elements must be selected from the set {a1, a2, . . . , an−1} and the number of such subsets of S is
 n−1
r

.
By the Addition Principle, the number of r-element subsets of S is

The Hockey Stick Theorem
From the way that the numbers in Figure 9.1 were described, we see that the 4th number
in the 5th row, namely 35, is the sum of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th numbers in row 4, that is,
35 = 1 + 4 + 10 + 20 (see Figure 9.5). Interpreting this in the Pascal triangle shown in Figure 9.3,
we see that

See Figure 9.5. This suggests another property of the Pascal triangle, which is sometimes called the
Hockey Stick Theorem because the locations of these numbers in the Pascal triangle resemble
the shape of a hockey stick.

Figure 9.5: Illustrating the Hockey Stick Theorem in the Pascal triangle
Since each string contains r+1 1s, the location of the last 1 in the sequence is either position r+1 or
a position to the right of position r+1. If the ﬁnal 1 is in position r+1, then the remaining r 1s must
appear in positions 1 through r and the number of ways of selecting r possible positions for these r
1s is
 r
r

. If the ﬁnal 1 is in position r +2, then the remaining r 1s must occur in positions 1 through
r + 1 and the number of ways of selecting r of these r + 1 positions for the remaining r 1s is
 r+1
r

.
We continue this until we arrive at the ﬁnal possibility, where the last 1 occurs in position n + 1.
Then the remaining r 1s must be in positions 1 through n and the number of ways of selecting r of
these n positions for the remaining r 1s is

9.1. THE PASCAL TRIANGLE AND THE BINOMIAL THEOREM
317
The Binomial Theorem
The rows in the Pascal triangle may seem familiar for another reason. Observe that
(x + y)0 = 1
(x + y)1 = 1x + 1y
(x + y)2 = 1x2 + 2xy + 1y2
(x + y)3 = 1x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + 1y3
(x + y)4 = 1x4 + 4x3y + 6x2y2 + 4xy3 + 1y4.
That is, the coeﬃcients of the terms in the nth power (n ≥0) of the binomial x + y are precisely
the numbers in row n of the Pascal triangle. This is a well-known theorem in discrete mathematics.
We are surely familiar with the expansion (x + y)2 = x2 + 2xy + y2, which occurs in many forms
in mathematics, such as
(a −b)2
=
(a + (−b))2 = a2 + 2a(−b) + (−b)2 = a2 −2ab + b2
(3x + 5)2
=
(3x)2 + 2(3x)(5) + 52 = 9x2 + 30x + 25
(x2 + 1)2
=
= (x2)2 + 2(x2) · 1 + 12 = x4 + 2x2 + 1.
An interesting application of this fact concerns squaring positive integers whose last digit is 5,
such as (35)2 or (75)2. Suppose that n is a positive integer whose last digit is 5. Then the decimal
representation of n is
n =
a
z
}|
{
. . .
5
.
So if n = 35, then a = 3; while if n = 125, then a = 12. Hence n = 10a + 5; that is, 35 = 3 · 10 + 5
and 125 = 12 · 10 + 5. So
n2
=
(10a + 5)2 = (10a)2 + 2 · (10a) · 5 + 52
=
100a2 + 100a + 25 = 100(a2 + a) + 25 = 100a(a + 1) + 25.
Therefore, the decimal representation of n2 is
n2 =
a(a+1)
z
}|
{
. . .
2
5
.
Example 9.3
To square 35, we therefore multiply 3 and 3 + 1 (obtaining 12) and follow it by 25, that is, (35)2 =
1225. Also, (125)2 is 12 · 13 = 156 followed by 25 or (125)2 = 15, 625.
♦
To see why (x + y)3 = 1x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + 1y3, ﬁrst recall that (x + y)3 represents the product
of x + y (3 times), that is, (x + y)3 = (x + y)(x + y)(x + y). If we multiply these binomials without
collecting like terms, then we obtain
(x + y)3
=
(x + y)(x + y)(x + y) = (x + y)(xx + xy + yx + yy)
=
xxx + xxy + xyx + xyy + yxx + yxy + yyx + yyy
=
x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3.
So, for example, where does the term 3x2y come from? It is obtained by adding the terms: xxy +
xyx + yxx. To obtain one of these terms in the expansion of (x + y)3, we need to select the term x
from two of the three binomials x + y and select the term y from one of the three binomials x + y
and then multiply them to obtain a term x2y in the expansion of (x + y)3. The number of ways of
selecting the term y, say, is
 3
1

= 3 and so the coeﬃcient of x2y in (x + y)3 is
 3
1

= 3.
Similarly, each term in the expansion (x+y)4 = (x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y) is obtained by selecting
either x or y in each binomial and then multiplying them. If we select y twice (and necessarily x
twice), then the number of ways of doing this is
 4
2

= 6. Hence the coeﬃcient of x2y2 in (x + y)4 is
 4
2

= 6. In general, we have the famous Binomial Theorem.

, where
r, n ∈Z and 0 ≤r ≤n, are often referred to as binomial coeﬃcients.
Mathematicians have been aware of the Binomial Theorem, at least for small values of n, for
centuries. The great geometer Euclid knew that (a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 by considering areas of
squares and rectangles (see Figure 9.6).

Although it seems as if it would have been relatively easy for Euclid and others to consider
(a + b)n for n ≥3, generalizing results was not a common way to think among the ancient Greeks.
On the other hand, Diophantus, the father of Algebra to some, is believed to have been familiar with
the expansion of (a + b)n. Certainly, the Indian mathematician Aryabhata was aware of this. The
Binomial Theorem stated in its standard form is due to Pascal. It appeared in a paper published
in 1665 (after Pascal’s death). There is a more general form of the Binomial Theorem, due to Sir
Isaac Newton, which we will encounter in Section 9.3.

9.1. THE PASCAL TRIANGLE AND THE BINOMIAL THEOREM
319
If we consider each of these rows as a single integer, then what we have is
(11)0
=
1
(11)1
=
11
(11)2
=
121
(11)3
=
1331
(11)4
=
14641.
Actually, none of this is surprising. Consider (x + y)4, for example. By the Binomial Theorem,
(x + y)4 = 1x4 + 4x3y + 6x2y2 + 4xy3 + 1y4.
Letting x = 10 and y = 1, we obtain
(11)4 = (10 + 1)4 = 1 · 104 + 4 · 103 + 6 · 102 + 4 · 10 + 1 = (14641)10.
For n ≥5, we must make some adjustments to this line of reasoning, however.
Again, by the
Binomial Theorem,
(x + y)5 = x5 + 5x4y + 10x3y2 + 10x2y3 + 5xy4 + y5.
Letting x = 10 and y = 1, we have
(11)5
=
(10 + 1)5 = 1 · 105 + 5 · 104 + 10 · 103 + 10 · 102 + 5 · 10 + 1
=
1 · 105 + 5 · 104 + 1 · 104 + 1 · 103 + 5 · 10 + 1
=
1 · 105 + 6 · 104 + 1 · 103 + 5 · 10 + 1 = (161051)10.
Therefore, the number 161051 can be obtained from the 5th row
1
5
10
10
5
1
of the Pascal triangle by ﬁrst writing down the rightmost 1, then 5 to its immediate left, and then
0 (of the number 10). The digit 1 of 10 added to 10 on its left, resulting in 11. We write down 1
and add the leftmost 1 of 11 to 5 obtaining 6 and the ﬁnally write down the ﬁnal 1. These steps are
summarized below.

Thus (11)5 = 161, 051.
Even though the beginning (and ending) coeﬃcient in the expansion of (x + y)n is 1, the second
(and the second from the last) coeﬃcient is n and we need only compute approximately half of the
coeﬃcients, it can still be a bit tedious to compute the binomial coeﬃcients
 n
r

for 2 ≤r ≤n/2.
There is a shortcut for writing out the expansion of (x+y)n, however (assuming that n is not terribly
large).
Since the coeﬃcient of xn−ryr in the expansion of (x + y)n is
 n
r

, one of the terms in this
expansion is
 n
r

xn−ryr. The term that follows
 n
r

xn−ryr in the expansion is
  n
r+1

xn−r−1yr+1.
Observe what we obtain if we were to multiply
 n
r

by n −r and divide it by r + 1.

Theorem 9.6
For integers r and n with 0 ≤r < n,

n −r
r + 1 =

(r + 1)!(n −r −1)! =


,
producing the desired result.
Let’s see what this says in an example.
Example 9.7
Suppose that we wish to expand (x + y)7. Of course, we know that the expansion begins with
x7 + 7x6y.
To obtain the coeﬃcient in the next term (that is, the coeﬃcient of x5y2), we can
multiply 7 by 6 and divide by 2.
Said in other words, to ﬁnd the term following 7x6y in the
expansion of (x + y)7, Theorem 9.6 tells us to multiply the coeﬃcient 7 by 6 (the exponent of x)
and divide by 2 (because we’re in the 2nd term). This gives us 21 and so we have
(x + y)7 = x7 + 7x6y + 21x5y2 + · · ·.
The term immediately following 21x5y2 is therefore
  21·5
3

x4y3 = 35x4y3.
This can be done in our head. Because of the symmetry of the coeﬃcients in any binomial expansion,
(x + y)7 = x7 + 7x6y + 21x5y2 + 35x4y3 + 35x3y4 + 21x2y5 + 7xy6 + y7.
Therefore, the entire expansion of (x + y)7 can be written in a matter of seconds.

Recall that the Fibonacci numbers F1, F2, F3, . . . are deﬁned recursively in Section 4.6 by
F1 = 1, F2 = 1 and Fn = Fn−2 + Fn−1 for n ≥3.
Thus F3 = 2, F4 = 3, F5 = 5 and F6 = 8. The pattern indicated in (9.2) can be stated as follows.

9.1. THE PASCAL TRIANGLE AND THE BINOMIAL THEOREM

Weighted Averages
The identities that we’ve described with connections to the Pascal triangle and the Binomial
Theorem are referred to as combinatorical identities and applications of these can occur when we
least expect them. We now describe an example of this.
Example 9.9
Suppose that during a 15-week semester, the instructor of a Discrete Mathematics course gives a
quiz every week, each quiz valued at 100 points. Two students, Allyson and Brian, have the following
quiz scores.

When the quiz averages are computed at the end of the semester, Brian’s average is 83.1 while
Allyson’s is 82.6. Brian receives a grade of B+ according to the instructor’s grading scale and Allyson
receives a grade of B.
If we were to look at Allyson’s and Brian’s quiz scores more closely, we see that Brian’s scores
have been decreasing overall, while Allyson’s scores have been improving. Despite the fact that their
averages are close, Brian receives a higher grade from the instructor. Are these grades appropriate?
The problem we’re facing is that all quizzes are being treated equally, regardless of when during the
semester that they are taken. One might think that a student’s quiz score should count more if the
quiz is taken later in the semester.
For example, suppose that a student’s quiz scores are s1, s2, . . . , s15, that is, the student’s score
on the quiz given during Week i is si. On the quiz given during the ﬁrst week, the student’s score
is therefore s1 and so the student’s quiz average after Week 1 is also s1. Let us denote the student’s
quiz average after the ﬁrst week by s1, that is, s1 = s1. Now the student takes a quiz during the
2nd week and receives a score of s2. Since this quiz is more recent, we decide that this score should
count more and we decide to give that score double the “weight” of the score on the ﬁrst quiz. So
the student’s quiz score average after Week 2, namely s2, is obtained by counting s1 = s1 once and
s2 twice. It is as if the student has taken three quizzes. The weighted quiz average after Week 2 is
therefore
s2 = s1 + 2s2
3
= s1 + 2s2
3
.
Now the student takes a quiz during Week 3 and receives a score of s3. Prior to taking that quiz,
the student’s 2-week quiz average was s2. However, because the quiz taken in Week 3 was taken
more recently, we again decide to count that double. So the student’s 3-week average is computed
by counting s2 twice (because it’s the average over a 2-week period) and s3 twice (because it’s a
most recent quiz score), that is,
s3
=
2s2 + 2s3
4
=
2s1+4s2
3
+ 2s3
4
=
2s1 + 4s2 + 6s3
12
= s1 + 2s2 + 3s3
6
.
This is the same, therefore, as counting s1 once, s2 twice and s3 three times. Continuing in this
manner, we arrive at
s4
=
3s3 + 2s4
5
= s1 + 2s2 + 3s3 + 4s4
10
=
s1 + 2s2 + 3s3 + 4s4

which is a consequence of (9.1). When Allyson’s weighted quiz average is computed, the result is
88.1 and now she receives an A−. When Brian’s weighted quiz average is computed, the result is
77.0 and Brian receives a C+.
♦
The preceding example is one of many where it might seem more logical to compute a weighted
average of a collection of numbers rather than compute the standard average. This is especially the
case when the numbers to be averaged have occurred over a period of time and the more recent
numbers should be given more emphasis (weight) than the earlier numbers.
In Example 9.9, we assigned weights of 1, 2, . . . , 15 to sets of 15 numbers to compute a weighted
average and used this instead of the standard average (where the weights 1, 1, . . ., 1 are used). Since
we are using the binomial coeﬃcients

Permutations and Combinations with Repetition
In the permutations and combinations that we have seen thus far, the elements involved have been
distinct. This, in fact, is the standard understanding for permutations and combinations. There are
occasions, however, when this restriction is not appropriate. For example, if we wish to know how
many 7-digit telephone numbers there are with the same area code, then we certainly must allow
digits to be repeated. Indeed, this number can be computed by an application of the Multiplication
Principle. Since there are 10 choices for each of the 7 digits, the number of diﬀerent telephone
numbers with the same area code is 107 = 10, 000, 000. This illustrates a more general result.
Theorem 9.10
The number of r-permutations with repetition of an n-element set is nr.
Permutations with Repetition
Next we turn to permutations with repetition where there are some additional restrictions.
Example 9.11
How many diﬀerent permutations are there of the letters of the word PEPPER?
Solution. We have to be a bit careful here. Despite the fact that this is a 6-letter word, the answer
to this question is not 6! = 720. For example, the permutation that interchanges the 3rd and 4th
letters does not produce a new permutation. So the number of diﬀerent permutations of the letters
of the word PEPPER is surely less than 720. Suppose that the number of distinct permutations of
the letters of PEPPER is N. One of these permutations is PPPEER. We can make the 3 Ps distinct
by replacing them by P1, P2 and P3. From the permutation PPPEER, we obtain 3! = 6 diﬀerent
permutations, namely

9.2. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS WITH REPETITION
325
P1P2P3EER
P2P1P3EER
P3P1P2EER
P1P3P2EER
P2P3P1EER
P3P2P1EER.
Therefore, with the 3 letters P distinguishable, we now have 3!N permutations.
Consider the
permutation P1P2P3EER. We can make the 2 Es distinguishable by replacing one by E1 and the
other by E2. For the permutation P1P2P3EER, we obtain 2! = 2 diﬀerent permutations, namely
P1P2P3E1E2R and P1P2P3E2E1R. If we make all 3 Ps, both Es and R distinguishable, we arrive
at the 6! permutations of the 6 distinct elements. Thus 3! 2! 1! N = 6! and so
N =
6!
3! 2! 1! = 60.
♦
Example 9.11 is a special case of a more general result.
Theorem 9.12 Suppose that there are n objects, exactly k of which are distinguishable. If there are
n1 objects of type 1, n2 objects of type 2 and so on, up to nk objects of type k, where n1+n2+· · ·+nk =
n, then the number of diﬀerent permutations of these n objects is
n!
n1! n2! · · · nk!.
Proof. Of the n positions, there are
  n
n1

possible locations for the n1 objects of type 1. Once the
location for these n1 objects has been determined, there are n−n1 positions remaining for the other
objects. There are
 n−n1

possible locations for the n2 objects of type 2 and

♦
The type of argument we’ve been using to compute the number of distinct permutations with
repetition can also be used to solve problems which may not appear to ﬁt into this category.
Example 9.16
Jennie, who is about to be married, has purchased 13 diﬀerent gifts for the 4 girls in her wedding
party. Jennie has decided to give 4 gifts to her maid of honor and 3 gifts each to her other three
friends. In how many ways can this be done?
Solution. Suppose that Ann (A) is the maid of honor and Jennie’s other three friends are Betty
(B), Connie (C) and Debbie (D). The number of ways of giving 4 of the 13 gifts to Ann is

4! 3! 3! 3! = 1, 201, 200.
There is another way to look at this problem. Suppose that we consider 13 slots, numbered 1
through 13, corresponding to the 13 gifts:
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

13
If we were to write AAAABBBCCCDDD, this would correspond to Ann receiving gifts 1 – 4, Betty
receiving gifts 5 – 7, Connie receiving gifts 8 – 10 and Debbie receiving gifts 11 – 13. Therefore, the
number of ways of distributing the 13 gifts equals the number of distinct permutations of the letters
of AAAABBBCCCDDD. This number is
13!
4! 3! 3! 3! = 1, 201, 200. ♦
Combinations with Repetition
We now turn from problems involving permutations with repetition to problems involving combi-
nations with repetition. We have already seen that the number of r-element subsets of an n-element
set is
C(n, r) =
n
r

=
n!
r! (n −r)!.
Of course, in this case, we were assuming that the n elements in the set are distinct. Let’s consider
an example where the elements in a set are not distinct.
Example 9.17
A young boy has a large collection of red (R), blue (B) and green (G) marbles that he keeps in a
bowl. How many diﬀerent outcomes are possible if he randomly selects 3 marbles from the bowl?
Solution. The possibilities are
RRR, BBB, GGG, RRB, RRG, BBR, BBG, GGR, GGB, RBG,

9.2. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS WITH REPETITION
327
where the order in which the colors are listed is immaterial. Hence there are 10 diﬀerent outcomes. ♦
The solution we gave in Example 9.17 consisted of listing the diﬀerent possibilities. Since there
weren’t many diﬀerent colors of the marbles (only 3) and the boy wasn’t selecting many marbles
(only 3), listing the possibilities was practical and not diﬃcult. However, this would not have been
the case if the number of marbles the boy selected was large and the number of colors of the marbles
was large. Therefore, let’s consider another solution to the problem in Example 9.17, one that does
not depend on the small number of marbles selected and the small number of colors involved.
We can think of each marble in Example 9.17 as belonging to one of 3 categories depending on
whether its color is red, blue or green. Therefore, there is a division of the marbles as follows:
Red
|
Blue
|
Green
We have already seen that there are 10 diﬀerent outcomes if 3 marbles are selected. We repeat these
10 outcomes and show how these can be represented in the division of marbles listed above by the
diagram shown below.

Observe that for each of the 10 outcomes, the corresponding diagram consists of 5 symbols (3 ◦s
for the 3 marbles to be selected and 2 |s for the 2 separators needed to divide the marbles into 3
colors). The order in which these 5 symbols appear tell us how many marbles of a certain color are
being selected. Therefore, we may think of 5 positions (or slots)
1
2
3
4
5
where in each slot, either the symbol ◦or the symbol | is to be placed (a total of 3 ◦s and 2
|s in each case). The number of ways of selecting 3 of the 5 positions to place the symbol ◦is
C(5, 3) =

Example 9.18
A lady enters Ben’s Bagels for the purpose of purchasing 4 bagels. The restaurant currently has 5
kinds of bagels: plain, cherry, blueberry, crunchy and coconut. How many diﬀerent assortments are

8
where 4 of these 8 positions correspond to the 4 bagels being purchased and the other 4 positions

s + t −1
where s terms in the sequence correspond to the s elements selected and the remaining t −1 terms
correspond to the t −1 separating lines (which separate the t diﬀerent kinds of elements). Then the
number of selections is the number of ways of choosing s of the s + t −1 terms in the sequence for
the elements selected. This number is
 s+t−1
s

.
There is another interpretation of Theorem 9.19. When descussing a set S, with n elements say,
we always assume that the n elements of S are distinct, that is, no two elements of S are the same.
There are circumstances, however, when we consider collections of elements, some of which may
be the same. A multiset is a collection of elements in which repetition of elements is permitted.
Hence, considered as multisets, {a, a, b} and {a, b, b} are distinct 3-element multisets. In fact, the
distinct 3-element multisets, every element of which is R, B or G, are:
{R, R, R}, {B, B, B}, {G, G, G}, {R, R, B}, {R, R, G},
{B, B, R}, {B, B, G}, {G, G, R}, {G, G, B}, {R, B, G}.
This, of course, corresponds to the solution given to Example 9.17. In fact, Theorem 9.19 can be
restated in terms of multisets.
Theorem 9.20
The number of s-element multisets whose elements belong to a t-element set is
s + t −1
s

.
We now return to our preceding discussion.
Example 9.21
A college student keeps his spending money in a drawer in no particular order. He has many $1, $5,
$10 and $20 bills there. After just getting up one morning (and still half asleep), he takes 5 bills
from the drawer. How many diﬀerent assortments of bills could he have taken?
Solution. The student has made a selection of s = 5 bills and there are t = 4 kinds of bills, so the
number of diﬀerent assortments is
s + t −1

Once again this problem could be looked at as dividing the money in the drawer into 4 denominations
by 3 separating lines:
$1

Since there are s = 5 bills to be selected and t −1 = 3 separating lines, the number of possible
outcomes is, as above,

Example 9.22
Four students are ﬁnalists in a contest in which ten questions are asked of the four students. Only
the ﬁrst student to answer a particular question correctly receives credit for that question. We are
interested in the number of questions answered by each student. Assuming that every question is
answered correctly by some student, how many outcomes are possible?
Solution. Suppose that we denote the four students by S1, S2, S3, S4. For 1 ≤i ≤4, let ai be
the number of questions answered correctly by Si. Then we can think of dividing the 10 answered
questions among these four students as
a1

Three friends attend a young boy’s birthday party. The mother has arranged 10 games where a
prize is awarded for winning a game. The prizes are identical. If each of the 4 children receives at
least one prize, how many distributions of prizes are possible?
Solution. Since every child will receive at least one prize, the only question concerns the distributions
of the remaining 6 prizes among these 4 children. Since there are s = 6 remaining prizes and t−1 = 3
separating lines, the number of distributions of prizes is
s + t −1

Example 9.24
A music program is to consist of 22 musical selections, namely 15 piano numbers and 7 violin
numbers. How many programs are possible if no two violin selections are consecutive?
Solution. Necessarily, there is at least one piano selection between every two violin selections, so
13 of the 22 selections must appear in the program as
V P V P V P V P V P V P V,
(9.3)
where each of the remaining 15−6 = 9 piano selections must be inserted somewhere in the sequence
(9.3), including the possibility of inserting it at the beginning or at the end of the sequence. The
only question is where in the schedule the remaining 9 piano selections will occur. Hence there are
8 possible locations for these 9 piano selections where each separating line corresponds to one of the
7 violin selections.

Example 9.25
How many 3-digit numbers are there, the sum of whose digits is 9?
Solution. Any 3-digit number n can be expressed as n2n1n0, where n2, n1 and n0 are the digits of
n. By assumption, n2 + n1 + n0 = 9. Since n is a 3-digit number, n2 ≥1. The number n can be

Generating Functions
In this section, we consider the topic of generating functions, a concept that has a variety of applica-
tions, including (1) solving certain kinds of counting problems and (2) determining the general terms
of some recursively-deﬁned sequences of real numbers. Before introducing this concept, we consider
a few counting problems. We begin with two examples, each of a type that we have encountered
earlier.
Example 9.26
Suppose that we were to select two balls from a bowl consisting of one red ball (R), one blue ball
(B), one green ball (G) and one yellow ball (Y). Then there are
 4


= 6 possible outcomes, namely:
RB

♦
Example 9.27
Suppose that we were to select two balls from a bowl consisting of two red balls, two blue balls, two
green balls and two yellow balls. Since we are selecting s = 2 objects of which there are at least two
each of the t = 4 diﬀerent kinds, it follows by Theorem 9.12 that the number of possible outcomes is
s + t −1

There are other ways to consider these two problems. Let’s look at Example 9.26 again. We
know by the Binomial Theorem that
(1 + x)4

1 + 4x + 6x2 + 4x3 + x4.

9.3. GENERATING FUNCTIONS
333
Of course, (1 + x)4 is the product of four polynomials 1 + x, that is,
(1 + x)4 = (1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x).
To obtain a term in the product
(1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x)(1 + x),
we select either 1 or x in each of the four polynomials 1 + x and multiply them. In particular,
to obtain the term x2, we select x from two of the four polynomials 1 + x and select 1 from the
remaining two polynomials 1 + x. Since there are
 4
2

= 6 ways to select x from two of the four
polynomials, the coeﬃcient of x2 is 6. Of course, we may write 1 + x as x0 + x1 and think of each
of the four polynomials 1 + x as representing one of the four balls (red, blue, green, yellow). That
is, we are looking at these four polynomials representing the four colors:
(1 + x)
(1 + x)
(1 + x)
(1 + x).
(9.4)
red
blue
green
yellow
Thus selecting two balls from a bowl of four balls (one of each of the four colors) is the same as
selecting x in two of the four polynomials 1 + x and selecting 1 in the remaining two polynomials
1 + x in the product (9.4). For example, selecting x = x1 in the ﬁrst polynomial means that we are
selecting a red ball (1 red ball); while selecting 1 = x0 in the ﬁrst polynomial means that we are
selecting 0 red balls. Consequently, if one of the two balls selected is blue and the other is green,
then this is equivalent to selecting 1 in the ﬁrst and fourth polynomials 1 + x in the product (9.4)
and selecting x in the second and third polynomials 1 + x and then multiplying these (to obtain the
term x2).
We now turn to Example 9.27 and see how this problem can be looked at from a similar point
of view. If we were to expand
 1 + x + x24, we would obtain
 1 + x + x24
=
 1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2
=
1 + 4x + 10x2 + 16x3 + 19x4 + 16x5 + 10x6 + 4x7 + x8.
To obtain the term x2 in this product,
(i) we could select x from two of the four polynomials 1 + x + x2 and select 1 from the other two
polynomials or
(ii) we could select x2 from one of the four polynomials 1 + x + x2 and select 1 from the other
three polynomials.
Since there are
 4
2

= 6 ways to perform (i) and
 4
1

= 4 ways to perform (ii), the total number of
ways to perform (i) or (ii) is 6 + 4 = 10 by the Addition Principle. Therefore, the coeﬃcient of x2
in
 1 + x + x24 is 10. Each polynomial can be considered as representing balls of a certain color to
be selected. That is, we have
 1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2
.
(9.5)
red
blue
green
yellow
Selecting two balls from a bowl of eight balls (two of each of the four colors) is the same as
(1) selecting x in two of the four polynomials 1 + x + x2 and 1 in the remaining two polynomials
1 + x + x2 in the product (9.5) or
(2) selecting x2 from one of the four polynomials 1+x+x2 and 1 in the remaining three polynomials
1 + x + x2.

334
CHAPTER 9. ADVANCED COUNTING METHODS
For example, selecting 1 = x0 in the ﬁrst, third and fourth polynomials 1 + x + x2 and x2 in the
second polynomial 1 + x + x2 means that we are selecting 0 red, 0 green and 0 yellow balls and 2
blue balls.
We also see that one of the other terms in the expansion of
 1 + x + x24 is 16x5. This tells us
that there are 16 diﬀerent outcomes if we select 5 balls from a bowl of eight balls (two of each of the
four colors). For example, we could select x from three of the four polynomials 1 + x + x2 and x2
from the remaining polynomial. There are
 4
1

= 4 ways to do this. Also, we could select 1 from one
of the four polynomials, x from one of the other three polynomials and x2 from the remaining two
polynomials. There are
4!
1! 1! 2! = 12 ways to do this and so the coeﬃcient of x5 in
 1 + x + x24 is
4 + 12 = 16, again by the Addition Principle.
The discussion above suggests a variety of additional problems.
Example 9.28
A bowl consists of 30 balls, namely 10 balls of each of the colors red, blue and green. In how many
diﬀerent ways can 10 balls be selected from the bowl such that (1) at least one and at most 7 balls
are red, (2) at least 2 and at most 4 balls are blue and (3) at most 3 balls are green?
Solution. Let r, b and g denote the number of red, blue and green balls selected, respectively. Then
r + b + g = 10, where 1 ≤r ≤7, 2 ≤b ≤4 and g ≤3. Since b ≤4 and g ≤3, it follows that
r = 10 −b −g ≥10 −4 −3 = 3. The selections with these restrictions are indicated below.

Consequently, the number of diﬀerent ways of selecting 10 balls from the bowl (subject to the stated
conditions) is 11.
There is another way to interpret the answer to our question. The number of red balls we can
select is one of the exponents of x in the polynomial x + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7, the number of
blue balls is an exponent of x in x2 + x3 + x4, while the number of green balls is an exponent of x
in 1 + x + x2 + x3. Consider the product of these three polynomials:
(x + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7)(x2 + x3 + x4)(1 + x + x2 + x3).
(9.6)
red
blue
green
When these polynomials are multiplied, a term xr is chosen from the ﬁrst polynomial (where 1 ≤
r ≤7), a term xb is chosen from the second polynomial (where 2 ≤b ≤4) and a term xg is chosen
from the third polynomial (where 0 ≤g ≤3). For example, three of these choices are r = 3, b = 4
and g = 3, which produces the term x3x4x3 = x3+4+3 = x10. Consequently, the answer to our
question is the coeﬃcient of x10 in the product (9.6), which, evidently, is 11.
♦
Example 9.29
A bowl consists of 30 balls, namely 10 balls of each of the colors red, blue and green. In how many
diﬀerent ways can 10 balls be selected from the bowl such that (1) at least 3 balls selected are red,
(2) an even number of blue balls is selected and (3) an odd number of green balls is selected?

9.3. GENERATING FUNCTIONS
335
Solution. Again, let r, b and g denote the number of red, blue and green balls selected, respectively.
Then r + b + g = 10, where r ≥3, b is even and g is odd. Since r + b + g is even, b is even and g
is odd, it follows that r must be odd. The solutions with these restrictions are listed in the table
below.

The number of diﬀerent ways of selecting 10 balls, subject to the given conditions, is therefore 10.
The answer to this question is also equal to the coeﬃcient of x10 in the product
(x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + x10)(1 + x2 + x4 + x6 + x8 + x10)(x + x3 + x5 + x7 + x9)
red

of the three polynomials. Since certain terms in these polynomials cannot be used to produce a term
x10, we could consider the simpler product
(x3 + x5 + x7 + x9)(1 + x2 + x4 + x6)(x + x3 + x5 + x7).
From what we have seen, the coeﬃcient of x10 in this product is 10.
♦
Example 9.30
A bowl consists of 30 balls, namely 10 balls of each of the colors red, blue and green. In how many
diﬀerent ways can 10 balls be selected from the bowl such that at least 2 but at most 5 balls of each
color are selected?
Solution. Once again, let r, b and g denote the number of red, blue and green balls selected,
respectively. Then r + b + g = 10, where 2 ≤r ≤5, 2 ≤b ≤5 and 2 ≤g ≤5. The solutions with
these restrictions are listed below.

(x2 + x3 + x4 + x5)3

CHAPTER 9. ADVANCED COUNTING METHODS
Example 9.31
A man walks into Doug’s Donuts to buy either 5 or 6 donuts (he hasn’t decided which) and learns
that there are only 2 chocolate donuts and 3 powdered donuts left but there is a large number of
glazed donuts (Doug’s specialty). How many diﬀerent selections does the man have if he buys 5 or
6 donuts?
Solution. These questions can be answered by determining the coeﬃcients of x5 and x6 in the
product
 1 + x + x2  1 + x + x2 + x3  1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·


=
1 + 3x + 6x2 + 9x3 + 11x4 + 10x5 + 12x6 + 12x7 + 12x8 + · · ·
Consequently, there are 10 diﬀerent ways to select 5 donuts and 12 diﬀerent ways to select 6 donuts. ♦
We have seen therefore that to count the number of ways to select objects from a collection, where
some of the objects may be the same and subject to some conditions, we can consider the product
of certain polynomials or power series and compute an appropriate coeﬃcient or coeﬃcients. This
leads us to the main concept of this chapter: generating functions. Before giving a formal deﬁnition
of this concept, however, let’s revisit the Binomial Theorem.
The Extended Binomial Theorem
According to the Binomial Theorem, for each nonnegative integer n,
(1 + x)n =
n
X
r=0
n
r

xr,
where the binomial coeﬃcient
 n
r

= 1 when r = 0 and
n
r

=
n!
r!(n −r)! = n(n −1) · · · (n −r + 1)
r!
(9.7)
when 0 < r ≤n. More generally, for a real number α and a nonnegative integer r, the extended
binomial coeﬃcient
 α
r

is deﬁned to be 1 if r = 0; otherwise,
α
r

= α(α −1) · · · (α −r + 1)
r!
.
(9.8)
Of course, if α and r are integers with 0 < r ≤α, then the deﬁnition of
 α
r

in (9.8) agrees with
that in (9.7). Moreover, if α is a nonnegative integer and r is an integer with r > α, then one of the
terms in the product α(α −1) · · · (α −r + 1) is 0 and so
 α
r

= 0.
The Binomial Theorem was extended by Sir Isaac Newton around 1676 to obtain an expression
for (1 + x)α as an inﬁnite series for any real number α, sometimes referred to as a binomial series.
Theorem 9.32
(The Extended Binomial Theorem) Let α ∈R. If x ∈R with |x| < 1, then
(1 + x)α =

(9.9)

9.3. GENERATING FUNCTIONS

The condition that |x| < 1 tells us from calculus that if −1 < x < 1, then the inﬁnite series in
(9.9) converges and therefore has a numerical value, which in fact equals (1 + x)α.

(9.11)
The formula in (9.11) might seem familiar to you from the study of inﬁnite series in calculus since
the geometic series 1 −x + x2 −x3 + · · · is known to converge to 1/(1 + x) when |x| < 1.
Generating Functions
We now consider sequences whose domain is N ∪{0}, that is, {ak} denotes the sequence a0, a1,
a2, . . .. With each sequence, there is associated a power series in a most natural way, which has
applications to counting and to recursively-deﬁned sequences.
Deﬁnition 9.33
Let a0, a1, a2, . . . be a sequence of real numbers. The generating function of
this sequence {ak} is deﬁned as the inﬁnite series
f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · =
∞
X
k=0
akxk.
The variable k in {ak} and in P∞
k=0 akxk is not crucial to the meaning of the sequence or inﬁnite
series. Other variables could be used just as well. For example, {an} also represents the sequence
a0, a1, a2, . . .; while
∞
X
n=0
anxn = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · .
The generating function of a sequence is what is called a formal power series. That is, unlike the
situation in calculus, where we are often concerned with knowing those real numbers x for which
a power series converges, our interest in generating functions is as a means of keeping track of the

338
CHAPTER 9. ADVANCED COUNTING METHODS
terms of the sequence; that is, the coeﬃcient of xk in a generating function acts as a “place holder”
for the term ak in the sequence a0, a1, a2, . . ..
If {ak} is a ﬁnite sequence, then there is some nonnegative integer n such that ak = 0 for all
k > n. Therefore, the generating function in this case is
f(x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn =
n
X
k=0
akxk,
which is a polynomial (of degree n if an ̸= 0).
Example 9.34
The generating function of the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . is the inﬁnite series
f(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x2 + 7x3 + · · · =
∞
X
k=0
(2k + 1)xk.
Example 9.35
The generating function of the ﬁnite sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 is the polynomial
f(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x2 + 7x3 + 9x4.
♦
Before seeing applications of generating functions to counting problems and later to recursively-
deﬁned sequences of real numbers, we ﬁrst look at some speciﬁc generating functions.
Example 9.36
The generating function of the sequence 1, −1, 1, −1, · · · is the inﬁnite series
f(x) = 1 −x + x2 −x3 + · · · =
∞
X
k=0
(−1)kxk.
We have already seen in (9.11) that f(x) =
1
1 + x.
♦
Example 9.37
The generating function of the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, . . . is the inﬁnite series
f(x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · =
∞
X
k=0
xk.
Since we saw in (9.11) that
1
1 + x = 1 −x + x2 −x3 + · · · ,
it follows that
1
1 −x
=
1
1 + (−x) = 1 −(−x) + (−x)2 −(−x)3 + · · ·
=
1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·
and so
f(x) = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · =
1
1 −x
(9.12)
is the generating function of the sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, . . ..

(9.13)
and so f(x) =

(1 −x)2 is the generating function of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ..
Multiplying the expression in (9.13) by x, we obtain
g(x) =

Thus g(x) =

(1 −x)2 is the generating function of the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, . . ..
♦
The problem in Example 9.39 can be solved in another and simpler way if we recall some diﬀer-
entiation rules from calculus. We have already noted that
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + · · · .

CHAPTER 9. ADVANCED COUNTING METHODS
Since
1
1 −x = (1 −x)−1,
it follows by diﬀerentiating the equal expressions (1 −x)−1 and 1 + x + x2 + · · · that
−(1 −x)−2(−1) = (1 −x)−2 =
1
(1 −x)2 = 1 + 2x + 3x2 + 4x3 + · · ·

Generating Functions and Counting
Now we see how generating functions can be used to solve certain kinds of counting problems.
Example 9.42
A bowl contains a large number of marbles. Each marble is one of 8 colors. A total of r marbles
(r ≥0) is selected from the bowl. Use generating functions to determine the number of diﬀerent
outcomes. What is this number when r = 5?
Solution. With each of the 8 colors, there is associated a power series, namely,
1 + x + x2 + · · ·.
Determining the answer to this question is the same as computing the coeﬃcient of xr in the product
(1 + x + x2 + · · ·)(1 + x + x2 + · · ·) · · · (1 + x + x2 + · · ·) = (1 + x + x2 + · · ·)8
of eight power series. Since
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · ,
as we saw in (9.12), it follows that
(1 + x + x2 + · · ·)8

which is a consequence of (9.14). Thus the number of diﬀerent outcomes is

number of diﬀerent ways to select 5 marbles from the bowl is
 r+7

♦
Example 9.43
In a certain room at a casino, there is a card game in which bets are made with chips. There are
three diﬀerent kinds of chips, one valued at $3, one at $5 and one at $7. Determine the generating
function of the sequence {ak}, where ak is the number of diﬀerent ways that chips can be selected
that have a total value of $k for k ≥0.
Solution. The $3 chips can be represented by the power series 1 + x3 + x6 + x9 + · · ·, the $5 chips
by 1 + x5 + x10 + x15 + · · · and the $7 chips by 1 + x7 + x14 + x21 + · · ·. Hence the answer to the
question is the coeﬃcient of xk in the product

  1 + x5 + x10 + x15 + · · ·
  1 + x7 + x14 + x21 + · · ·

=
1 + x3 + x5 + x6 + x7 + x8 + x9 + 2x10 + x11 + 2x12 + 2x13 + 2x14 + 3x15 + · · · .
For example, the term 3x15 is obtained by

342
CHAPTER 9. ADVANCED COUNTING METHODS
(1) multiplying x15, 1, 1 in the three power series,
(2) multiplying 1, x15, 1,
(3) multiplying x3, x5, x7
and then adding the results in (1)-(3). The product x15 · 1 · 1 = x5(3) · x0 · x0 corresponds to $15
worth of chips obtained from ﬁve $3 chips.
Since
1
1 −x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · · ,
it follows that for m ∈N,
1
1 −xm = 1 + xm + x2m + x3m + · · · .

Recursively-Deﬁned Sequences Revisited
In Section 4.3, we considered several examples of recursively-deﬁned sequences of real numbers.
In these examples, based on knowing the ﬁrst few terms of a sequence, we attempted to conjecture
the general term of the sequence and then prove that our guess was correct, often with the aid of the
Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. In many cases, however, it may not be clear what the
general term appears to be. We will now see that generating functions can often be useful in ﬁnding
the general term of a recursively-deﬁned sequence, thereby taking the guesswork out of the problem.
Before illustrating this application of generating functions with several examples, we emphasize once
again that it is the coeﬃcients of the various powers of x that provide the answers to questions. It
is not the case that values are assigned to x.
Example 9.44
A sequence {an} is deﬁned recursively by
a0 = 3, a1 = −2 and an = 2an−1 −an−2 for n ≥2.
Find a generating function for {an} and use this to determine an for n ≥0.
Solution. Let f(x) be the generating function of the sequence {an}. Thus
f(x)

a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · =

Hence
f(x) = a0 + (a1 −2a0)x + 2xf(x) −x2f(x)
and so
(1 −2x + x2)f(x) = (1 −x)2f(x) = a0 + (a1 −2a0)x = 3 −8x.
Solving for f(x), we obtain
f(x) = 3 −8x
(1 −x)2 .
By (9.13),
1
(1 −x)2 = 1 + 2x + 3x2 + · · · + (n + 1)xn + · · · ,
and so
f(x) = (3 −8x)

1 + 2x + 3x2 + · · · + (n + 1)xn + · · ·

Hence the coeﬃcient of xn in f(x) is
3(n + 1) −8n = 3 −5n.
Therefore, an = 3 −5n for n ≥0.

Generating Functions and Partial Fractions
For our ﬁnal example, we employ the topic of partial fractions. In college algebra, we often
encounter rational expressions (ratios of polynomials) that we wish to add. For example, to compute
3
2x + 1 +
5
x −3,
we obtain a common denominator, namely (2x + 1)(x −3) and then add. In this case, we have
3
2x + 1 +
5
x −3
=
3(x −3)
(2x + 1)(x −3) +
5(2x + 1)
(x −3)(2x + 1) = 3(x −3) + 5(2x + 1)
(2x + 1)(x −3)
=
3x −9 + 10x + 5
(2x + 1)(x −3) =
13x −4
2x2 −5x −3.
However, there are occasions when it is useful to reverse this process. That is, beginning with
13x −4
2x2 −5x −3,
(9.15)
we wish to express (9.15) as the sum of two simpler fractions. The procedure one uses is called the
method of partial fractions. (If you have had experience with integration in calculus, you might
recall an integration technique called integration by partial fractions, where this algebraic method
is used.)
We will describe only a simpliﬁed version of the method of partial fractions. For example, suppose
that
f(x) =
p(x)
p1(x)p2(x),

9.3. GENERATING FUNCTIONS
345
where p1(x) and p2(x) are two ﬁrst degree (linear) polynomials and p(x) is a polynomial of degree
0 (a constant) or of degree 1. In this case, it is possible to write
f(x) =
p(x)
p1(x)p2(x) =
A
p1(x) +
B
p2(x),
(9.16)
where A and B are constants. The next step is to determine the values of A and B. One way to do
this is to ﬁrst multiply (9.16) by p1(x)p2(x), producing
p(x) = Ap2(x) + Bp1(x)
(9.17)
and then select two speciﬁc values x1 and x2 of x such that p1(x1) = 0 and p2(x2) = 0. We then
substitute these values for x in (9.17) and solve for A and B. For example, let’s suppose that
f(x) =
x
1 −5x + 6x2 .
Our ﬁrst step is to factor 1 −5x + 6x2. In this case,
1 −5x + 6x2 = (1 −2x)(1 −3x).
We then have
x
1 −5x + 6x2 =
x
(1 −2x)(1 −3x) =
A
1 −2x +
B
1 −3x.
Thus
x = A(1 −3x) + B(1 −2x).
Letting x = 1
2, we have 1
2 = −1
2A and so A = −1. Letting x = 1
3, we have 1
3 = 1
3B and so B = 1.
Therefore,
x
1 −5x + 6x2 =
x
(1 −2x)(1 −3x) =
−1
1 −2x +
1
1 −3x.
(9.18)
We now see how partial fractions play a role in the following example.
Example 9.46

a0 = 0, a1 = 1 and an = 5an−1 −6an−2 for n ≥2.

Thus
f(x) = a0 + (a1 −5a0)x + 5xf(x) −6x2f(x)
and so
(1 −5x + 6x2)f(x) = a0 + (a1 −5a0)x = x.
Solving for f(x), we obtain
f(x) =
x
1 −5x + 6x2 .

Chapter 10
Discrete Probability
Although ideas from probability occurred thousands of years ago, probability as a mathematical
theory came into existence only during the middle of the 17th century. The Frenchman Chevalier de
M´er´e was known to gamble often. From his own experiences, he had observed that if a single die was
rolled four times, then it was more likely than not that 6 would occur at least once. Consequently,
he would bet with others that this would happen. Having grown tired of this game, de M´er´e decided
to try a new game. He bet with others that if a pair of dice was rolled 24 times, a total of 12 (6
on each die) would occur at least once. He soon learned, however, that he was not winning as often
with the second game as he did with the ﬁrst game, so de M´er´e then asked his friend Blaise Pascal
(after whom the Pascal triangle is named) why this was happening. Pascal determined that de M´er´e
should expect to win the ﬁrst game 51.8% of the time and the second game only 49.1% of the time.
The story goes that de M´er´e’s problem initiated correspondence between Pascal and another
famous French mathematician, Pierre de Fermat.
It is believed that this correspondence went
beyond de M´er´e’s problem to other problems dealing with probability. Pascal and Fermat are often
credited with founding probability theory. Since then, probability has become not only an important
subject in mathematics and statistics courses but a topic that intersects many aspects of society,
including genetics, medicine, industrial quality control and insurance.
In this chapter, we will be introduced to discrete probability, the probability of discrete mathe-
matics.
10.1
The Probability of an Event
The communication between Pascal and Fermat led them to deﬁne the probability of winning certain
kinds of games.
Speciﬁcally, if a game has n equally likely outcomes, m of which are winning
outcomes, then the probability of winning the game was deﬁned to be m/n. While this deﬁnition
requires the outcomes of a game to be equally likely, this is not always the case. Indeed, it’s not
always clear when the outcomes of a game are equally likely.
Pascal and Fermat also deﬁned probability when a game is repeated a large number of times
under the same conditions. In 1933 the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov developed the
ﬁrst rigorous approach to probability. We now consider some of the fundamental concepts associated
with probability.
Suppose that a certain procedure has a number of possible outcomes. Each implementation of
the procedure is referred to as an experiment. More formally, we have the following.
Deﬁnition 10.1
An experiment is a procedure that results in one of a number of possible out-
comes. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space for the exper-
iment. Each subset of a sample space is called an event.
351

352
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
The sample space of an experiment is usually denoted by S and an event by E. Thus E ⊆S. If
S is a sample space and s ∈S, then s is an outcome. If some outcome in an event occurs when an
experiment is performed, then the event is said to occur.
Let’s look at a number of examples of sample spaces.
Example 10.2
Flipping a coin once is an experiment. If we’re interested in whether heads or tails occurs, then the
two outcomes of this experiment are heads (H) and tails (T). The sample space here is therefore
S = {H, T } so that the possible events in this case are ∅, {H}, {T } and {H, T }.
♦
Example 10.3
A coin is ﬂipped n times and we’re interested in the possible sequences of heads and tails that can
occur. What is the number of outcomes in the sample space S of this experiment? For n = 3, what
is S?
Solution. Since there are two possible results with each ﬂip of a coin, it follows by the Multiplication
Principle that |S| = 2n. If n = 3, then
S ={HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}
and so |S| = 23 = 8. Therefore, there are 28 = 256 possible events in this case, including ∅, {HHH},
{HT H, T T H} and S.
♦
Example 10.4
Selecting one ball at random from a bowl containing three red balls, two blue balls and one green
ball is an experiment that yields one of three possible outcomes, namely a red ball (R), a blue ball
(B) or a green ball (G). In this case, the sample space is S = {R, B, G}.
♦
Example 10.5
You probably know that a die is a cube where each of its six faces has a number of spots, ranging
from 1 to 6 (see Figure 10.1). When a die is tossed, rolled or thrown (on a ﬂat surface), we typically
consider the number of spots on the upper face as the outcome of this experiment. Therefore, the
experiment of rolling a single die has six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The sample space here
is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Figure 10.1: A die
Many games concerning dice (the plural of die), however, involve a pair of dice rather than a
single die. When we toss a pair of dice, obtaining (a, b), where a is the number obtained for the

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT
353
ﬁrst die and b is the number resulting from the second die, then we are typically interested in the
number a + b, the sum of the numbers of the two dice. Since there are 6 possible numbers for the
ﬁrst die and 6 for the second die, the number of possible ordered pairs (a, b) from tossing two dice
is 6 · 6 = 36 by the Multiplication Principle. However, there are only 11 distinct sums, namely,
2, 3, . . . , 12. These sums are shown in Figure 10.2.

Figure 10.2: The sum of the values of two dice
It may seem that the sample space in this case should consist of the 11 outcomes 2, 3, . . ., 12
rather than the 36 outcomes mentioned above, but the choice of the sample space depends on which
questions interest us. Suppose that we are only interested in the sum of the numbers of two dice
when the dice are rolled. Then the appropriate sample space may very well be
S1 = {2, 3, . . ., 12}.
On the other hand, if we are interested in whether the number obtained on at least one of the two
dice is 3, then this event E can be described more clearly by writing
E = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)}.
An appropriate sample space in this case would most likely be
S2 = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . ., (6, 5), (6, 6)},
which consists of all 36 possible ordered pairs (a, b) from tossing two dice. Moreover, if the question
that interests us is how many times we need to roll a pair of dice before we obtain 7 (the sum of the
numbers on the two dice), then the sample space in this case is most likely S3 = N.
Although sample spaces can be any kinds of sets, we will only consider discrete sample spaces,
that is, sets containing countably many elements. Hence a sample space can be a ﬁnite nonempty
set or a denumerable (countably inﬁnite) set. For the most part, we will only be concerned with
ﬁnite sample spaces. We now consider two experiments to describe appropriate sample spaces in
each case.
Example 10.6
Suppose that a casino sells a die, where instead of having a face with a single spot, the logo of the
casino is on that face and the remaining ﬁve faces have spots as with a standard die. If such a die is
rolled and what interests us is whether the logo occurs, then one outcome is the logo and the other
outcome is no logo, that is, the sample space here is S = {logo, no logo}.
♦

354
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
Example 10.7
Suppose that a die is white and that each spot on a face is colored either red or blue. If a face
has an even number of spots, then there is an equal number of red and blue spots. On the other
hand, if a face has an odd number of spots, then there is one more red spot than blue spot. If we
are interested only in the number of spots, then the sample space is the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. If,
instead, we are interested in the number of blue spots when the die is tossed, then one face of the
die has 3 blue spots, two faces have 2 blue spots, two faces have 1 blue spot and the remaining face
has no blue spots. The sample space in this case would be S′ = {0, 1, 2, 3}.
♦
We are now prepared to present the main concept of this chapter.
Deﬁnition 10.8
For a set S, a function p : S →[0, 1] is a probability function if
X
s∈S
p(s) = 1.
For an element s ∈S, the number p(s) is the probability of s.
In the deﬁnition above of a probability function, the sample spaces S that we encounter will
typically be ﬁnite and this is our primary interest; however, the set S can be denumerable (see
Section 5.5) and so, in general, S can be a countable set. In any case,
0 ≤p(s) ≤1
for each element s ∈S and the sum of the probabilities of the elements of S is 1.
Deﬁnition 10.9
The probability p(E) of an event E in a sample space S is the sum of the
probabilities of the outcomes in that event, that is,
p(E) =
X
s∈E
p(s).
Consequently,
0 ≤p(E) ≤1
for every event E. In particular,
p(∅) = 0 and p(S) = 1.
If S is the sample space of an experiment, then the way that the probability p(s) of an outcome
s ∈S is deﬁned can vary widely. It usually depends, however, on our experience of what we think
a reasonable deﬁnition should be. We now look at two experiments we visited earlier and describe
reasonable ways of deﬁning the probability of an outcome in the resulting sample space.
Example 10.10
In Example 10.4, we considered selecting one ball at random from a bowl containing three red balls,
two blue balls and one green ball and stated that the sample space is S = {R, B, G}. In this case,
it is reasonable to assume that selecting any one of the six balls is equally likely. It makes sense,
therefore, to deﬁne a probability function p on S by
p(R) = 3
6 = 1
2, p(B) = 2
6 = 1
3 and p(G) = 1

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT
355
Example 10.11
In Example 10.6, we considered a die that contains the logo of a casino on one face of the die and
no logo on the other ﬁve faces. The sample space in this case is S = {logo, no logo}. Here too, it is
reasonable to assume that obtaining the logo or any of the other faces is equally likely. Since one of
the six faces has the logo and ﬁve of the six faces have no logo, it is logical to deﬁne a probability
function p on S by
p(logo) = 1
6 and p(no logo) = 5
6.
♦
In general then, if a sample space S is ﬁnite, say |S| = n ≥1 and each outcome in S is equally
likely to occur, then it is logical to deﬁne
p(s) = 1
|S| = 1
n
for each outcome s ∈S. In this case, p is called a uniform probability function. If a (ﬁnite)
sample space S is assigned a uniform probability function and E is an event in S, then in this case,
p(E) = |E|
|S| .
This is the deﬁnition of probability given by Pascal and Fermat.
Example 10.12
A coin is ﬂipped twice. If heads and tails are equally likely to occur, then what is the probability
that heads and tails occur once each (in either order)?
Solution. The sample space in this case is
S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}.
The event that heads and tails occur once each is E = {HT, TH}. Since the probability is uniform
in this case, the probability of E is
p(E) = |E|
|S| = 2
4 = 1
2.
♦
Example 10.13
A die is tossed once and each of the six possible outcomes is equally likely to occur. What is the
probability that the number obtained is odd?
Solution. The sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and the event of obtaining an odd number on
this toss of the die is E = {1, 3, 5}. Since this probability function is also uniform, the probability
of E is
p(E) = |E|
|S| = 3
6 = 1
2.
♦
Since an event in a sample space S is a subset of S, the union and intersection of events in S
are also events in S. There are some basic observations concerning probabilities of events that are
subsets of the same ﬁnite sample space. All of these are consequences of facts involving cardinalities
of sets. Two events E and F in a sample space S are mutually exclusive if the sets E and F are
disjoint, that is, if E and F cannot occur simultaneously. In particular, if E and F are mutually
exclusive events, then
p(E ∪F) = |E ∪F|
|S|
= |E| + |F|
|S|
= |E|
|S| + |F|
|S| = p(E) + p(F).

356
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
If E and F are events that are not necessarily mutually exclusive, then it follows from the Principle
of Inclusion-Exclusion (see Section 8.3) that
p(E ∪F)
=
|E ∪F|
|S|
= |E| + |F| −|E ∩F|
|S|
=
|E|
|S| + |F|
|S| −|E ∩F|
|S|
= p(E) + p(F) −p(E ∩F).
Similarly, n ≥2 events E1, E2, . . . , En are mutually exclusive if E1, E2, . . . , En are pairwise dis-
joint. More generally then, if E1, E2, . . . , En are mutually exclusive events, then
p(E1 ∪E2 ∪· · · ∪En) = p(E1) + p(E2) + · · · + p(En).
For an event E in a sample space S, the complementary event E of E consists of those
outcomes in S not belonging to E, that is, E = S −E. Therefore,
p(E)
=
|E|
|S| = |S −E|
|S|
= |S| −|E|
|S|
= |S|
|S| −|E|
|S| = 1 −p(E).
The observations above are summarized in the theorem below.
Theorem 10.14
Let E and F be two events in a sample space.
(a) Then
p(E ∪F) = p(E) + p(F) −p(E ∩F).
(b) If E and F are mutually exclusive, then
p(E ∪F) = p(E) + p(F).
(c) If E is the complementary event of E, then
p(E) = 1 −p(E).
We now turn to some probability questions involving tossing a pair of dice. There is every reason
to believe that each ordered pair (a, b) is equally likely to occur when a pair of dice is tossed, where
again, a is the number obtained on the ﬁrst die and b is the number obtained on the second die.
Since there are 36 ordered pairs and the probability function is uniform here,
p((1, 1)) = p((1, 2)) = · · · = p((6, 5)) = p((6, 6)) = 1
36.
Example 10.15
A pair of dice is tossed.
(a) What is the probability of obtaining a sum of 7?
(b) What is the probability of obtaining a sum of 7 or a sum of 10?
(c) What is the probability of obtaining 3 on at least one of the two dice?
(d) What is the probability of obtaining a sum that is diﬀerent from 7?
Solution.
(a) The sample space S1 = {2, 3, . . ., 12} seems like a good choice here and we wish to determine
p(7). This will not be a uniform probability function in this case as surely p(7) ̸= p(2), for
example. Looking at the table in Figure 10.2, we see that 7 occurs in 6 of the 36 entries in the
table, each of which is equally likely to occur. Thus p(7) = 6/36 = 1/6.

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT
357
(b) Looking at Figure 10.2, we see that 10 occurs in 3 of the 36 entries in the table.
Since
obtaining a sum of 7 and obtaining a sum of 10 are mutually exclusive events, it follows by
Theorem 10.14(b) that
p({7, 10}) = p(7) + p(10) = 1
6 + 3
36 = 1
6 + 1
12 = 1
4.
(c) As we saw earlier, the sample space
S2 = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . ., (6, 5), (6, 6)}
seems more appropriate here, where each of the 36 outcomes (ordered pairs) is equally likely
to occur. The event that interests us is
E = {(3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (1, 3), (2, 3), (4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3)}.
Since |E| = 11 and the probability function here is uniform,
p(E) = |E|
|S| = 11
36.
We may look at the event E a bit diﬀerently. Let E1 be the event that 3 is the number obtained
on the ﬁrst die and E2 the event that 3 is the number obtained on the second die. Then the
event under consideration is E = E1 ∪E2. By Theorem 10.14(a),
p(E) = p(E1) + p(E2) −p(E1 ∩E2).
Since |E1| = |E2| = 6 and E1 ∩E2 = {(3, 3)}, it follows that p(E1) = p(E2) = 1/6 and
p(E1 ∩E2) = 1/36. Therefore,
p(E) = 1
6 + 1
6 −1
36 = 11
36.
(d) Since the event E of not obtaining a sum of 7 is the complementary event of the event E of
obtaining a sum of 7, it follows by (a) and Theorem 10.14(c) that
p(E) = 1 −p(E) = 1 −1
6 = 5
6.
♦
Example 10.16
Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers on the dice is
(a) even?
(b) divisible by 3?
(c) divisible by 4?
Solution. Here too we choose the sample space to be
S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . ., (6, 5), (6, 6)}.
(a) According to Figure 10.2, there are 18 outcomes that produce an even sum. Therefore, the
probability that the sum is even is 18/36 = 1/2.
(b) There are 12 outcomes that produce a sum that is divisible by 3. So the probability in this
case is 12/36 = 1/3.

358
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
(c) There are 9 outcomes that produce a sum that is divisible by 4. Hence the probability that
the sum is divisible by 4 is 9/36 = 1/4.
♦
Example 10.17
Two dice are tossed.
(a) What is the probability that the numbers on the two dice are consecutive integers?
(b) What is the probability that the number on neither die is even?
Solution.
(a) The event in this case is
E = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 3), (5, 4), (6, 5)}.
Since |E| = 10, it follows that p(E) = |E|/|S| = 10/36 = 5/18.
(b) If the number on neither die is even, then the numbers on both dice must be odd. That is,
we are looking at outcomes (a, b), where a and b are both odd. Since there are 3 possibilities
for a (namely, 1, 3, 5) and 3 possibilities for b, the number of outcomes is 3 · 3 = 9 by the
Multiplication Principle. The probability that the number on neither die is even is therefore
9/36 = 1/4.
♦
We now consider some examples that do not involve dice.
Example 10.18
A large bowl contains 15 balls that are identical except for their colors: 6 are colored red, 5 are
colored blue and 4 are colored green.
(a) What is the probability that two balls selected at random from the bowl have the same color?
(b) What is the probability that two balls selected at random from the bowl are colored the same
if the ﬁrst ball is returned to the bowl before the second ball is selected?
Solution.
(a) There are
 15
2

= 15·14
2
= 105 ways to select two balls from the bowl and so the sample space S
in this case has 105 elements. Let E be the event that two balls selected at random from the
bowl have the same color. There are
 6
2

= 6·5
2 = 15 ways to select two red balls,
 5
2

= 5·4
2 = 10
ways to select two blue balls and
 4
2

= 4·3
2 = 6 ways to select two green balls. It follows by the
Addition Principle that the number of ways to select two balls of the same color is therefore
|E| = 15 + 10 + 6 = 31. Hence the probability of selecting two balls of the same color is
p(E) = |E|/|S| = 31/105 ≈0.295.
(b) Since there are 15 · 15 = 225 ways to select two balls from the bowl in this manner, the sample
space has 225 elements. There are 6 · 6 = 36 ways to select two red balls, 5 · 5 = 25 ways to
select two blue balls and 4 · 4 = 16 ways to select two green balls. Hence the number of ways
to select two balls of the same color is 36 + 25 + 16 = 77. So the probability of selecting two
balls of the same color in this case is 77/225 ≈0.342. Therefore, it is a bit more likely to select
two balls of the same color if the ﬁrst ball is returned to the bowl before the second ball is
selected.

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT

A standard deck of playing cards consists of 52 cards. These 52 cards are divided into 4 types
of 13 cards each. The types are referred to as suits, called hearts (♥), diamonds (♦), clubs (♣)
and spades (♠). In each suit, there is one card of each of the following kinds: two, three, four, ﬁve,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, jack (J), queen (Q), king (K), ace (A). In the table below, each row
corresponds to one of the four suits and each column corresponds to one of the 13 kinds. Hence one
of the cards is the three of diamonds and another is the jack of clubs.

There are many games that use such a deck of cards. One of the best known games is poker,
where each player in the game is dealt (supplied with) ﬁve of the 52 cards, called a hand. This game
has achieved increased popularity in recent years as poker competitions have become the subject of
television programs such as the World Series of Poker. In the example to follow, it is useful to know
that the number of diﬀerent poker hands is
52
5

=
52!
5! 47! = 2, 598, 960.
Example 10.19
What is the probability of being dealt a poker hand that consists of the three of hearts, the ﬁve of
clubs, the six of spades, the ten of clubs and the queen of diamonds?
Solution. Since this hand consists of ﬁve speciﬁc cards, there is only one such hand and the prob-
ability of being dealt this hand is
1
 52
5
 =
1
2, 598, 960 ≈0.000000385.
It is highly unlikely therefore that a poker player has been dealt this particular hand and perhaps
even more unlikely that the player would remember (or want to remember) being dealt this hand
even if it did occur. On the other hand, it is just as likely to be dealt this hand as any other hand. ♦
A hand that consists of ﬁve cards of the same suit is called a ﬂush.
Example 10.20
What is the probability of being dealt a ﬂush?
Solution. The number of ways of being dealt a ﬂush where the cards are of a particular suit is
 13
5

= 1287.
Since there are four diﬀerent suits, the number of ways of being dealt a ﬂush is
4 · 1287 = 5148. Therefore, the probability of being dealt a ﬂush is 5148/2, 598, 960 ≈0.00198.
♦
By a pair in poker, we mean two cards of the same kind such as two twos, two eights, two queens
and so on. A hand has two pairs if it has a pair of one kind, a second pair of another kind and
one card of a third kind. For example, a hand consisting of two ﬁves, two kings and an ace has two
pairs. By three of a kind in poker is meant a hand consisting of three cards of the same kind,
where the other two cards are of diﬀerent kinds. For example, a hand consisting of three ﬁves, a ten
and a queen is three of a kind. Also, four of a kind is a hand in which four cards are of the same
kind while the ﬁfth card is obviously of a diﬀerent kind.

360
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
Example 10.21
What is the probability of being dealt a hand of two pairs in poker?
Solution. Since there are 13 diﬀerent kinds, there are
 13
2

= 78 diﬀerent choices for the kinds of
the two pairs. Since there are 4 cards of each kind, there are
 4
2

= 6 possibilities for the two cards
of the same kind in each pair. There are 52 −2 · 4 = 44 possibilities for the card of the third kind.
Hence the number of hands consisting of two pairs is 78 · 6 · 6 · 44 = 123, 552 by the Multiplication
Principle and the probability of being dealt such a hand is 123, 552/2, 598, 960 ≈0.048.
♦
Probably one of the best known games of chance involves playing the lottery. Actually, it is
inappropriate to say the lottery as there are many lotteries. The example below deals with one of
them.
Example 10.22
In a certain lottery, called a power ball lottery, 5 balls are selected at random from a collection of
53 white balls numbered 1 to 53 and one ball (called the power ball) is selected at random from a
collection of 42 red balls numbered 1 to 42. To win the grand prize in this lottery, a lottery ticket
must be purchased that lists the numbers of all 5 white balls (in any order) as well as the number
of the power ball. What is the probability of winning the grand prize in this power ball lottery?
Solution. There are
 53
5

ways to select 5 white balls from the collection of 53 white balls and 42
ways to select a red ball from the collection of 42 red balls. Thus the number of diﬀerent lottery
tickets is
 53
5

·42 = 120, 526, 770. Therefore, the probability of winning the grand prize in this power
ball lottery is 1/120, 526, 770 ≈0.0000000083.
♦
Example 10.23
A total of 20 students participate in a drawing in which one name is chosen at random. There are 6
seniors (2 men and 4 women), 5 juniors (3 men and 2 women) and 9 freshmen (5 men and 4 women).
What is the probability that the name that is drawn belongs to
(a) a woman?
(b) a freshman?
(c) a woman who is a freshman?
(d) either a woman or a freshman?
(e) either a junior or a freshman?
Solution. The sample space S has 20 names and so |S| = 20. Let W be the event that the name
selected belongs to a woman, let J be the event that the selected name belongs to a junior, and let
F be the event that the selected name belongs to a freshman.
(a) Since |W| = 4 + 2 + 4 = 10, it follows that p(W) = |W|/|S| = 10/20 = 1/2.
(b) Since |F| = 9, it follows that p(F) = |F|/|S| = 9/20.
(c) Observe that |W ∩F| = 4. Thus the probability that the name that is drawn belongs to a
woman who is a freshman is
p(W ∩F) = |W ∩F|
|S|
= 4
20 = 1
5.

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT
361
(d) By Theorem 10.14(a), the probability that the selected name belongs to either a woman or a
freshman is
p(W ∪F) = p(W) + p(F) −p(W ∩F) = 1
2 + 9
20 −1

4.
Also, observe that |W ∪F| = 15 and so
p(W ∪F) = |W ∪F|
|S|
= 15
20 = 3
4.
(e) Observe that J and F are mutually exclusive. Since p(J) = |J|/|S| = 5/20 and p(F) = 9/20
by (b), it follows by Theorem 10.14(b) that the probability that the selected name belongs to
either a junior or a freshman is
p(J ∪F) = p(J) + p(F) = 5
20 + 9
20 = 14
20 = 7
10.
On the other hand, observe that |J ∪F| = 14 and so p(J ∪F) = 14/20 = 7/10.
♦
There are situations when we may want to perform an experiment over and over again, or
perhaps perform two experiments, one after the other. The following theorem is a consequence of
the Multiplication Principle (described in Chapter 8).
Theorem 10.24 Let S1, S2, . . . , Sn be n ≥2 sample spaces with probability functions p1, p2, . . . , pn,
respectively and let S = S1 × S2 × · · · × Sn. For (s1, s2, . . . , sn) ∈S, deﬁne
p((s1, s2, . . . , sn)) = p(s1) · p(s2) · · · · · p(sn).
Then p is a probability function on S. In particular, if an event E of S consists of an event E1 in
S1, followed by an event E2 in S2 and so on, then
p(E) = p(E1) · p(E2) · · · · · p(En).
We now consider three examples that illustrate this theorem.
Example 10.25
In baseball, a player attempts to get a “hit” each time he is “at bat.” Suppose that a certain baseball
player has a “batting average” of .300. This means that he gets a hit (H) 30% of the time and does
not get a hit (N) 70% of the time. Suppose that in a certain game, this player is at bat 5 times,
that is, he has 5 opportunities to get a hit.
(a) What is the probability that he will get exactly two hits in the game?
(b) What is the probability that he will get at least one hit in the game?
Solution.
(a) The probability that the baseball player gets hits in his ﬁrst two times at bat and does not get
a hit in his last three times at bat (HHNNN) is
(0.3)(0.3)(0.7)(0.7)(0.7) = 0.03087.
Since there are
 5
2

= 10 ways of getting two hits in his ﬁve times at bat, the probability of
getting exactly two hits in ﬁve times at bat is 10(0.03087) = 0.3087.
(b) The probability that the baseball player gets no hits in his ﬁve times at bat (NNNNN) is
(0.7)5 = 0.16807. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one hit in the game is 1 −
0.16807 = 0.83193.

Recall from calculus that if a and r are real numbers such that −1 < r < 1, then
a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · =

1 −r .
(10.1)
This is the sum of the terms in a convergent geometric series. It is likely that you encountered this
in a calculus course in which the subject of inﬁnite series was studied (and perhaps likely that you
don’t remember this).
We return to an example involving the tossing of dice.
Example 10.26
A pair of dice is tossed until a sum of 7 is obtained for the two dice.
(a) What is the probability that 7 is obtained on the ﬁrst toss of the dice?
(b) What is the probability that 7 is obtained for the ﬁrst time on the second toss of the dice?
(c) What is the probability that 7 is obtained for the ﬁrst time on the third toss of the dice?
(d) What is the probability that 7 is obtained for the ﬁrst time on some toss of the dice?
(e) Use (d) to determine the probability of never getting a 7 on successive tosses of the dice.
Solution. Here we can let the sample space S = N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, where k is the outcome that
successive tosses of a pair of dice results in the sum of 7 for the ﬁrst time on the kth toss. So the
sample space here is countably inﬁnite. For i ∈N, let Ei = {i} be the event that 7 occurs for the
ﬁrst time on the ith toss.
(a) We have seen in Example 10.15(a) that the probability of getting a 7 on the toss of two dice
is 1/6. So p(E1) = 1/6.
(b) In this case, the ﬁrst toss of the dice results in a number other than 7, while the second toss
results in 7. The probability of this occurring is p(E2) = 5
6 · 1
6 =

(d) Since p(Ei) =

E = E1 ∪E2 ∪E3 ∪· · · .

Thus the probability of never getting a 7 on successive tosses of the dice, according to (d) and
Theorem 10.14(c), is p(E) = 1 −p(E) = 1 −1 = 0.

10.1. THE PROBABILITY OF AN EVENT

Example 10.27
A coin is ﬂipped four times.
(a) What is the probability that heads occurs every time?
(b) What is the probability that heads occurs exactly twice?
(c) What is the probability that heads occurs at least once?
Solution. The sample space in this case consists of 24 = 16 outcomes (see Example 10.3). The
probability of getting heads (H) is 1/2 and the probability of getting tails (T) is also 1/2.

(c) If we let E be the event that heads occurs at least once, then E is the event that heads
never occurs on any of the four ﬂips of the coins. Necessarily then, E is the event that tails
occurs each time. Thus TTTT is the only one of the 16 outcomes in E, that is, E ={TTTT}.
Therefore, p(E) = 1/16 and so p(E) = 1 −1/16 = 15/16.

Conditional Probability and Independent Events
During the ﬁrst week of a semester, the 200 students taking Calculus II at a certain university are
required to pass two of three quizzes that cover material which the students are expected to know
from Calculus I. A student who doesn’t pass two of these quizzes is required either to drop the course
or to spend ten hours in the tutor lab. A student who passes the ﬁrst two quizzes is excused from
taking the third quiz.
The ﬁrst two quizzes are then given. A total of 120 students pass the ﬁrst quiz and 90 students
pass both quizzes. The probability that a student is excused from taking the third quiz is therefore
90
200 = 0.45. But what is the probability that a student is excused from taking the third quiz given
that the student passed the ﬁrst quiz?
In order for a student to be excused from taking the third quiz given that the student passed the
ﬁrst quiz, the student (1) must be one of those 120 students who passed the ﬁrst quiz and (2) among

366
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
these 120 students, he or she must be one of the 90 students who also passed the second quiz. The
probability that this occurs is
90
120 = 0.75.
Conditional Probability
The probability that we have just described is called conditional probability. This is the proba-
bility that an event occurs given that some other event has already occurred. This is the main topic
of the current section. Before giving a formal deﬁnition of conditional probability, we present one
additional example.
Example 10.28
We have seen that the probability of rolling a 7 with a pair of dice is 1/6 ≈0.167. Suppose that a
woman is watching a man roll a pair of dice. It is important that the man rolls a 7 in the game he
is playing. Because the woman is not wearing her glasses, she is unable to see the outcome of the
throw except that she can tell there is more than one spot on each die. With this information, is it
more or less likely that the man rolled a 7?
Solution. Since 1 does not occur on either die, there are now only ﬁve possibilities for each die and
thus 5 · 5 = 25 possibilities for the pair of dice. That is, the sample space in this case now consists
of 25 ordered pairs (rather than 36 ordered pairs), namely all those ordered pairs (a, b) for which
a ̸= 1 and b ̸= 1. The only ways to roll a 7 without a 1 on either die are the following: (2, 5), (3,
4), (4, 3), (5, 2). Hence the probability that the man has rolled a 7 is now 4/25 = 0.16 and it is less
likely that he rolled a 7.
♦
What we have just observed is that the probability of an event E occurring may be diﬀerent in
a more restricted sample space F. This is referred to as the conditional probability of E given F.
We write p(E | F) for the conditional probability of the event E given that event F has already
occurred. Consequently, from what we have seen, if E is the event of rolling a 7 on a pair of dice
and F is the event of not rolling a 1 on either of the two dice, then p(E | F) = 0.16.
More generally, suppose that E and F are events in a sample space S and F ̸= ∅. If we wish to
compute p(E | F), then we are only concerned with the outcomes in E that belong to F. That is,
we are interested in the probability of the event E ∩F in the new sample space F. Therefore,
p(E | F) = |E ∩F|
|F|
.
This can also be written as
p(E | F) = |E ∩F|/|S|
|F|/|S|
= p(E ∩F)
p(F)
.
We then have the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 10.29 Let E and F be events in a sample space with p(F) > 0. Then the conditional
probability of the event E given that event F has occurred is
p(E | F) = p(E ∩F)
p(F)
.
We now look at some examples of conditional probability.

10.2. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY AND INDEPENDENT EVENTS
367
Example 10.30
When a coin is ﬂipped 4 times, the sample space S consists of 16 outcomes, namely,
S
=
{HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTHT, HTTH, HTTT,
THHH, THHT, THTH, THTT, TTHH, TTHT, TTTH, TTTT}.
The probability of getting an equal number of heads and tails when a coin is ﬂipped 4 times is
6/16 = 3/8. Suppose that a coin is ﬂipped 4 times but we don’t get the same result on the ﬁrst
and last ﬂips. Does this information aﬀect the probability of getting an equal number of heads and
tails?
Solution. If F is the event that a diﬀerent result is obtained on the ﬁrst and last ﬂips of a coin,
then
F = {HHHT, HHTT, HTHT, HTTT, THHH, THTH, TTHH, TTTH}.
If we let E be the event that there is an equal number of heads and tails, then
E = {HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH}.
Thus E ∩F = {HHTT, HTHT, THTH, TTHH} and so
p(E | F) = |E ∩F|
|F|
= 4
8 = 1
2.
Thus under the condition that the results of the ﬁrst and last ﬂips are diﬀerent on four ﬂips of a
coin, we now see that it is more likely that there will be an equal number of heads and tails.
♦
We now look at a problem concerning conditional probability that results when colored balls are
selected from a bowl.
Example 10.31
A bowl contains two red balls and three blue balls. Four balls are selected from the bowl, one at a
time and when a ball is selected, it is returned to the bowl before the next ball is selected.
(a) What is the probability that two of the four balls selected are red and the other two are blue?
(b) What is the probability that two of the four balls selected are red and the other two are blue
given that the ﬁrst two balls selected are of diﬀerent colors?
Solution. Let E be the event that two of the four balls selected are red and the remaining two balls
are blue.
(a) Since there are 5 choices for each ball selected, the number of possible outcomes is 5·5·5·5 = 625
and the sample space S has 625 elements. One way of selecting two red balls and two blue
balls is to select them in the order RRBB. There are two ways to select each red ball and three
ways to select each blue ball, so the number of ways to select two red balls and two blue balls
in this order is 2 · 2 · 3 · 3 = 36. However, the number of orders in which two red balls can be
selected is
 4
2

= 6. By the Multiplication Principle, the number of ways to select two red balls
and two blue balls is 6 · 36 = 216 and so |E| = 216. Therefore, the probability of selecting two
red balls and two blue balls is
p(E) = |E|
|S| = 216
625 ≈0.346.

368
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
(b) Let F be the set of outcomes in which the ﬁrst two balls selected have diﬀerent colors. The
number of ways of selecting 4 balls where the ﬁrst ball is red and the second ball is blue is
2 ·3 ·5 ·5 = 150. There are also 150 ways of selecting 4 balls where the ﬁrst ball is blue and the
second ball is red. Therefore, there are 300 ways of selecting 4 balls where the ﬁrst two balls
selected are of diﬀerent colors and so |F| = 300. Since there are 12 ways of selecting the ﬁrst
two balls if they are of diﬀerent colors and 12 ways of selecting the last two balls if they are of
diﬀerent colors, there are 12 · 12 = 144 ways to select two red balls and two blue balls where
the ﬁrst two balls selected are of diﬀerent colors. Hence |E ∩F| = 144 and the conditional
probability of E given F is
p(E | F) = |E ∩F|
|F|
= 144
300 = 0.48.
Consequently, it is more likely that two of the four balls selected are red and two are blue
given that the ﬁrst two balls selected are of diﬀerent colors.
♦
Example 10.32
When a coin is ﬂipped four times, we have seen in Example 10.27(b) that the probability that heads
comes up exactly twice is 6/16 = 3/8. What is the probability that heads comes up exactly twice
given that heads comes up on the ﬁrst ﬂip?
Solution. Let E be the event that heads comes up exactly twice when a coin is ﬂipped four times.
Therefore,
E = {HHTT, HTHT, HTTH, THHT, THTH, TTHH}.
Let F be the event that heads comes up on the ﬁrst ﬂip. Then
F = {HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTHT, HTTH, HTTT}.
Thus,
E ∩F = {HHTT, HTHT, HTTH}.
Hence the probability of E given F is
p(E | F) = |E ∩F|
|F|
= 3
8.
Therefore, p(E | F) = p(E) by Example 10.27(b).
♦
Independent Events
In the preceding example, we saw that the probability that heads comes up exactly twice when a
coin is ﬂipped four times is the same as the probability that heads comes up exactly twice given that
the ﬁrst ﬂip of the coin is heads. In other words, to have heads occur exactly twice is not aﬀected
by the knowledge that the ﬁrst ﬂip of the coin is heads. (See Exercise 1.) This leads us to the next
concept.
Deﬁnition 10.33
Two events E and F in the same sample space are independent if
p(E ∩F) = p(E) · p(F).

10.2. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY AND INDEPENDENT EVENTS
369
If E and F are independent events in the same sample space, then
p(E | F) = p(E ∩F)
p(F)
= p(E) · p(F)
p(F)
= p(E)
and
p(F | E) = p(F ∩E)
p(E)
= p(F) · p(E)
p(E)
= p(F).
That is, the probability of either event E or F occurring does not depend on the knowledge that
the other event has already occurred. We now consider three examples in which we are asked to
determine whether two given events are independent.
Example 10.34
Two dice are rolled. Let E be the event that (the sum) 7 is rolled on the two dice and let F be the
event that the ﬁrst die is 1. Are E and F independent events?
Solution. Here E ∩F is the event that 1 is rolled on the ﬁrst die and that 7 is the outcome of the
two dice. Thus E ∩F consists of the single outcome in which 1 occurs on the ﬁrst die and 6 occurs
on the second die. So p(E ∩F) = 1/36. Since p(E) = p(F) = 1/6, it follows that
p(E ∩F) = 1
36 = 1
6 · 1
6 = p(E)p(F)
and so E and F are independent.
♦
Example 10.35
A coin is ﬂipped 6 times. Let E be the event that heads and tails come up an equal number of
times. Let F be the event that heads and tails come up once each during the ﬁrst two ﬂips of the
coin. Are E and F independent events?
Solution. The sample space S in this case has 26 = 64 elements. One of the outcomes in E is
HHHTTT. Since there are
 6
3

= 20 possible locations for the three heads, |E| = 20. Since there
are two possibilities for the ﬁrst two ﬂips for each outcome in F and 24 = 16 possibilities for the
remaining four ﬂips, |F| = 2 · 16 = 32. Since there are two possibilities for the ﬁrst two ﬂips in
E ∩F and
 4
2

= 6 possible outcomes for the two heads occurring during the last four ﬂips of the
coin, |E ∩F| = 2 · 6 = 12. Therefore,
p(E ∩F) = |E ∩F|
|S|
= 12
64 = 3
16
and
p(E)p(F) = |E|
|S| · |F|
|S| = 20
64 · 32
64 = 5
32.
Since
p(E ∩F) ̸= p(E)p(F),
it follows that E and F are not independent.
♦
Example 10.36
If a coin is ﬂipped three times, then it is unlikely that heads comes up all three times or that tails
comes up all three times. Let E be the event that when a coin is ﬂipped three times, we don’t get
all heads or all tails. Let F be the event that when a coin is ﬂipped three times, heads comes up at
most once. Are E and F independent events?

370
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
Solution. Observe that
E = {HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH} and F = {HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}.
Since the sample space S has 23 = 8 elements,
p(E) = |E|
|S| = 6
8 = 3
4 and p(F) = |F|
|S| = 4
8 = 1
2.
Now E ∩F = {HTT, THT, TTH} and so
p(E ∩F) = |E ∩F|
|S|
= 3
8.
Since
p(E ∩F) = 3
8 = 3
4 · 1
2 = p(E)p(F),
it follows that E and F are independent events.
♦
We now use the fact that two events are independent to answer a few questions.
Example 10.37
Determine the probability that two ﬂips of a coin result in two heads.
Solution. Since the outcome on the second ﬂip of a coin is not inﬂuenced by the ﬁrst ﬂip of the
coin, it follows that the probability of getting heads both times is the product of probabilities of
getting heads on the ﬁrst ﬂip and getting heads on the second ﬂip, which is 1
2 · 1
2 = 1
4.
♦
Example 10.38
Determine the probability that heads occurs for the second time on the 4th ﬂip of a coin.
Solution. Let E be the event that heads comes up on the 4th ﬂip of a coin and let F be the event
that heads comes up exactly once during the ﬁrst three ﬂips of the coin. Then we wish to determine
p(E ∩F). Certainly, whether heads comes up on the 4th ﬂip of a coin is not aﬀected by what
happens during the ﬁrst three ﬂips of the coin, that is, E and F are independent events and so
p(E ∩F) = p(E)p(F). Now p(E) = 1/2. Since there are exactly three outcomes of the eight that
result in heads coming up exactly one, it follows that p(F) = 3/8. Therefore,
p(E ∩F) = p(E)p(F) = 1
2 · 3
8 = 3

♦
Example 10.39
It’s Friday and the TV weather forecaster states that there is a 50% chance of rain on Saturday and
a 50% chance of rain on Sunday. If we were to assume that having rain on Saturday and having rain
on Sunday are independent events, then what is the probability of having no rain over the weekend?
Solution. Observing that the probability of having no rain on Saturday is 1/2 and no rain on
Sunday is 1/2, we see that the probability of having no rain over the weekend is 1

Example 10.40
Three jars, denoted by J1, J2 and J3, contain three balls each, which are identical except for their
colors. The jar J1 contains a red ball (R), a blue ball (B) and a green ball (G); the jar J2 contains
two red balls and a blue ball; and the jar J3 contains three red balls. The jars are not labeled and
the balls cannot be seen from the outside. A jar is selected at random and a ball is selected at
random from that jar. If the jar J2 was selected and the blue ball, say, was selected from J2, then
this outcome is denoted by (J2, B). What is the probability that J1 was the jar selected given that
a red ball was selected from a jar?
Solution. Let E be the event that jar J1 was selected and let F be the event that a red ball was
selected from a jar. Hence we seek the conditional probability p(E | F), which equals p(E∩F)/p(F).
Thus E∩F = {(J1, R)} and F = {(J1, R), (J2, R), (J3, R)}. To help us determine p(E∩F) and p(F),
we make use of the tree diagram shown in Figure 10.3. Therefore, p(E∩F) = p({(J1, R)}) = 1

Figure 10.3: A tree diagram for Example 10.40
By the Pigeonhole Principle, if there are 13 people in a room, then there must be (at least)
two people whose birthdays occur during the same month. On the other hand, if there are only
12 people in the room, then there is a possibility that these 12 people have their birthdays during
diﬀerent months and therefore no two of them have birthdays during the same month. It seems
likely, though, that some of the 12 people would have their birthdays during the same month. That
is, it would seem that the probability that some two people in a group of 12 having their birthdays
during the same month is greater than 0.5. This brings up a question. What is the smallest number
of people for which it is more likely than not that two people have their birthdays during the same
month? We are assuming here of course that there are no connections among any of these people
that might inﬂuence when their birthday months are (such as three of the people being triplets).
That is, we are assuming that the birthday months of the people are independent.
Example 10.41
What is the minimum number of people needed for which it is more likely than not that two of them
have birthdays during the same month?

372
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
Solution. The minimum number is 5. First, let the ﬁve people be denoted by A0, A1, A2, A3, A4.
We compute the probability that no two of these individuals have their birthdays during the same
month. It doesn’t matter when the birthday of A0 is. The probability that the birthday of A1 is
during a month diﬀerent from that of A0 is 11/12. The probability that A2 has his/her birthday
during a month diﬀerent from both A0 and A1 is 10/12. Hence the probability that all ﬁve people
have their birthdays during diﬀerent months is
11
12 · 10
12 · 9
12 · 8
12 =
7920
20, 736 ≈0.382.
Thus the probability that some pair of people have their birthdays during the same month is approx-
imately 1 −0.382 = 0.618. Since the probability that some pair of people in a group of 4 have their
birthdays during diﬀerent months is approximately 0.427, the minimum number of people is 5.

10.3. RANDOM VARIABLES AND EXPECTED VALUES

10.3
Random Variables and Expected Values
A computer science professor routinely gives a 20-point quiz each week in every class she teaches.
During the current semester, she is teaching a graduate class with four students and an undergraduate
class with 40 students. During the most recent quiz in the graduate class, the quiz scores were 14,
15, 17 and 18. What is the average quiz score? This question can be answered quite easily. The
average quiz score is 16, although, of course, not even one student had a quiz score of 16. During
the most recent quiz in the undergraduate class, it turned out that every student also received one
of the quiz scores 14, 15, 17 and 18. What is the average quiz score for the undergraduate class?
This question is impossible to answer from the information that was given. We need to know how
many of the 40 students received each of the scores 14, 15, 17, 18 or to put in another way, we
need to know the probability of a student getting each of the scores 14, 15, 17, 18. Having this
information will enable us to compute a “weighted average” or “expected value” for a quiz score
(see Exercise 10). This is one of the major concepts of this section. To prepare ourselves to study
this idea, we consider ways that a number can be associated with each outcome in the sample space
of an experiment. This is a function from the sample space to some set of numbers and brings up
the concept of a random variable, which is the second major topic of this section.
Random Variables
Deﬁnition 10.42
Let S be a sample space on which is deﬁned a probability function. A random
variable on S is a function X from S to the set R of real numbers. The range X(S) of X is the
set of functional values of X.
The choice of the term “random variable” for this concept, although standard, is not a particularly
good choice since a random variable is neither random nor a variable. Let’s consider some examples
of random variables.
Example 10.43
A bowl contains two red balls and three blue balls. Three balls are selected at random from the
bowl. For each outcome t of this experiment, let X(t) denote the number of red balls selected in
the outcome t. Then X is a random variable on the sample space of this experiment. Since each
outcome contains at most two red balls, the range of X is {0, 1, 2}.
♦
Example 10.44
A coin is ﬂipped three times, resulting in the sample space
S ={HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}.
One random variable X deﬁned on the sample space of this experiment is
X(TTT) = 0,
X(HHH) = X(HHT) = X(HTH) = X(HTT) = 1,
X(THH) = X(THT) = 2,
X(TTH) = 3.
We can also present this information in the following table:
t
HHH
HHT
HTH
HTT
THH
THT
TTH
TTT
X(t)
1
1
1
1
2
2
3
0
That is, for an element t in the sample space S, X(t) = 0 if t = T T T ; otherwise X(t) = k
(1 ≤k ≤3) if heads occurs for the ﬁrst time on the kth ﬂip.
The range of X in this case is
{0, 1, 2, 3}.
♦
For a sample space S of an experiment and a random variable X deﬁned on S, the set of outcomes
in S having a given value (image) is an event of special interest.

376
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
Deﬁnition 10.45
Let X : S →R be a random variable deﬁned on the sample space S of some
experiment. For each r ∈R, the set
{s ∈S : X(s) = r}
is therefore an event, which we denote by X = r. We write p(X = r) for the probability of the event
in which each outcome has the value r.
Example 10.46
For the experiment of rolling a pair of dice, suppose that the sample space is
S = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), . . ., (6, 5), (6, 6)}.
Deﬁne a random variable X on S by
X((a, b)) = max{a, b}
for each outcome (a, b) ∈S. For 1 ≤n ≤6, let En denote the event
En = {s ∈S : X(s) = n}.
Determine the probability p(E5) of E5.
Solution. The event E5 consists of those ordered pairs (a, b) ∈S where the maximum of a and b is
5. Therefore,
E5 = {(1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 5), (4, 5), (5, 5), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 3), (5, 4)}.
Since |E5| = 9 and |S| = 36, it follows that
p(E5) = |E5|
|S| = 9
36 = 1
4.
Thus p(X = 5) = 1/4.
♦
We saw in Example 10.46 that |E5| = 9.
Indeed, for 1 ≤n ≤6, |En| = 2n −1.
Because
{E1, E2, . . . , E6} is a partition of S, it follows that
|E1| + |E2| + |E3| + |E4| + |E5| + |E6| = |S|
and so
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2n −1) = n2
for n = 6. This illustrates a formula we saw (and proved) in Result 4.4 in Section 4.1.
Deﬁnition 10.47
For a random variable X on a sample space S, the set of pairs
(r, p(X = r))
for each r ∈X(S) is called the distribution of X on S. The distribution of a random variable X
is typically expressed by writing p(X = r) for each r ∈X(S).
Therefore, for a random variable X on a sample space S,
X
r∈X(S)
p(X = r) = 1.
(10.2)

10.3. RANDOM VARIABLES AND EXPECTED VALUES
377
Example 10.48
Determine the distribution of the random variable given in Example 10.43.
Solution. In Example 10.43, three balls are selected at random from a bowl containing two red
balls and three blue balls. Since there are
 5
3

= 10 ways to choose three balls from the bowl, the
sample space S consists of 10 elements. For each outcome t of this experiment, X(t) is the number
of red balls selected in the outcome t. Since each outcome contains at most 2 red balls, we saw in
Example 10.43 that the range of X is X(S) = {0, 1, 2}. The distribution of the random variable X
is
p(X = 0)
=

10 = 0.3.
Thus p(X = 0) + p(X = 1) + p(X = 2) = 1, as anticipated in (10.2).
♦
In Example 10.48 the distribution of the random variable X can also be presented in the following
table.

p(X = r)

Expected Value
Our primary interest in random variables lies with the associated concept of expected value.
Deﬁnition 10.49
The expected value E(X) of a random variable X on a sample space S is the
sum over all elements s of S of the product of the probability of s and the value X(s), that is,
E(X) =
X
s∈S
p(s)X(s).
(10.3)
In particular, if S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn}, then
E(X) =
n
X
i=1
p(si)X(si).
Therefore, the expected value of a random variable X on a sample space S can be considered as
a “weighted average” of the values X(s) for s ∈S. When the sample space S of an experiment is
relatively small, we can compute the expected value of a random variable directly from the deﬁnition
in (10.3). On the other hand, when S consists of a large number of outcomes, it is convenient to
compute the expected value of a random variable by grouping all outcomes in S assigned the same
value by the random variable. This suggests expressing the expected value of a random variable X
on a sample space S in terms of the distribution of the random variable X on S.
Theorem 10.50
For a random variable X on a sample space S, the expected value of X on S is
E(X) =
X
r∈X(S)
p(X = r) · r.

378
CHAPTER 10. DISCRETE PROBABILITY
For the random variable X described in Example 10.48, the expected value is
E(X) =
X
r∈X(S)
p(X = r) · r = (0.1) · 0 + (0.6) · 1 + (0.3) · 2 = 1.2.
In this case, the outcome we might expect to get is not the expected value. Next we consider
two problems where the opposite is true.
Example 10.51
A fair coin is ﬂipped four times. How many heads would one expect to get?
Solution. Let S be the sample space of the 24 = 16 outcomes and let X be the random variable
that assigns to each outcome the number of heads that occurs. Since there is 1 outcome with no
heads, 4 outcomes with one head, 6 outcomes with two heads, 4 outcomes with three heads and 1
outcome with four heads, it follows that
p(X = 0) =
1
16,
p(X = 1) =
4

p(X = 2) =
6

p(X = 3) =

p(X = 4) =

16 + 4 · 1
16 = 32
16 = 2,
as expected.
♦
Example 10.52
Two fair dice are tossed. What is the expected sum of the numbers of the two dice?
Solution. Let S be the sample space consisting of the 36 outcomes (see Figure 10.2) and let X
be the random variable that assigns to each outcome the sum of the values of the two dice. The
distribution of the random variable X is given in the following table:

♦
In terms of gambling, expected values give us an idea of the likelihood of our winning games of
chance. We consider two games for the purpose of determining the wisdom of participating in them.

10.3. RANDOM VARIABLES AND EXPECTED VALUES
379
Example 10.53
At a carnival it costs $10 to play a game, where three balls are selected from a bowl consisting of
three red balls, three blue balls and three green balls. If all three balls selected have the same color,
then you win $63, while if all balls selected have diﬀerent colors, you win $21. If you were to play
this game 10 times, how much would you expect to win or lose?
Solution. First, there are
 9
3

= 84 diﬀerent outcomes and so the sample space has 84 elements.
Deﬁne a random variable X on the sample space by assigning 63 to an outcome in which all three
balls selected have the same color, 21 to an outcome in which all balls selected have diﬀerent colors
and 0 to all other outcomes. Only one of these outcomes consists of three red balls (or three blue
balls or three green balls).
Therefore, p(X = 63) = 3/84 = 1/28.
Since there are three balls
of each color, there are 3 · 3 · 3 = 27 outcomes where all the balls have diﬀerent colors. Hence
p(X = 21) = 27/84 = 9/28. Hence p(X = 0) = 1 −1/28 −9/28 = 18/28 = 9/14. The distribution
of the random variable X is given in the following table:
r
63
21
0
p(X = r)
1
28
9
28
9
14
By Theorem 10.50, the expected value of X is
E(X) = 63 · 1
28 + 21 · 9
28 + 0 · 9
14 = 252
28 = 9.
Consequently, each time the game is played, you would expect to get $9. However, you pay $10
to play the game, so you would expect to lose $1. If the game is played 10 times, then you would
expect to lose $10.
♦
In Example 10.53, a game is described at a carnival. Although you would expect to lose money
by playing it, you would not expect to lose much. Let’s look at another game that might take place
at a carnival.
Example 10.54
It costs $10 to play a game that consists of selecting a total of three balls from three bowls, where
one ball is selected from each bowl. Each bowl contains three balls, one of each of the colors red,
blue and green. If all three balls selected have the same color, then you win $63; while if all balls
selected have diﬀerent colors, you win $21. If you were to play this game 10 times, how much would
you expect to win or lose?
Solution. There are 3 · 3 · 3 = 27 diﬀerent outcomes and, consequently, the sample space consists
of 27 elements. Deﬁne a random variable X on the sample space by assigning 63 to an outcome
in which the three balls selected have the same color, 21 to an outcome in which the three balls
selected have diﬀerent colors and 0 to all other outcomes. Since there are 3 outcomes where the
three balls have the same color and 6 outcomes where the three balls have diﬀerent colors, there
are 18 outcomes that are of neither type. The distribution of the random variable X is given in the
following table:
r
63
21
0
p(X = r)
1
9
2
9

By Theorem 10.50, the expected value of X is
E(X) = 63 · 1
9 + 21 · 2
9 + 0 · 2
3 ≈11.67.
Therefore, each time you play the game, you would expect to win about $1.67. If the game is played
10 times, then you would expect to win about $16.67. (For this reason, you probably won’t see this
game played at a carnival.)

Chapter 11
Partially Ordered Sets and
Boolean Algebras
In Chapter 7 we introduced the concept of a relation and discussed the most studied type of relation:
an equivalence relation. In this chapter, we introduce a class of relations called partial orders. This
brings us to the concept of partially ordered sets, which then leads us to a study of the discrete
structures of lattices and Boolean algebras.
11.1
Partially Ordered Sets
For a relation to be an equivalence relation, it must possess the reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive
properties. Recall that a relation R on a set S is symmetric if whenever a R b for a, b ∈S, it must
also be the case that b R a. Therefore, for relations R with this property, it can never occur that
exactly one of a R b and b R a is true for distinct elements a and b in S. There are relations R on a
set S for which a R b and b R a can occur simultaneously for a, b ∈S only when a = b. When this
property replaces the symmetric property in an equivalence relation, we have the major concept of
this chapter: a partial order relation.
Deﬁnition 11.1
A relation R on a set S is antisymmetric if for all a, b ∈S,
whenever a R b and b R a, then a = b.
We now consider two examples of relations on the set {x, y, z} for the purpose of determining
whether these relations are antisymmetric.
Example 11.2
Let S = {x, y, z}. Consider the relation
R = {(x, x), (x, y), (y, z), (z, z)}
deﬁned on S. The only pairs a, b of elements of S such that both a R b and b R a are those for
which (1) a = x and b = x or (2) a = z and b = z. In each case, a = b and so R is antisymmetric. ♦
Example 11.3
Let S = {x, y, z}. Then
R = {(x, x), (x, y), (y, x), (y, z)}
387

388
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
is a relation deﬁned on S. The only pairs a, b of elements of S such that both a R b and b R a are
those for which (1) a = x and b = x or (2) a = x and b = y (or a = y and b = x). In (2), however,
a ̸= b and so R is not antisymmetric.
♦
We have just seen that the relation R described in Example 11.3 is not antisymmetric. In that
example, y R z but z ̸R y. Thus R is not symmetric either. Therefore, not symmetric does not
mean antisymmetric. Indeed, the relation
R′ = {(x, x), (y, y)}
on the set S = {x, y, z} is both symmetric and antisymmetric, while the relation
R′′ = {(x, y), (y, x), (y, z), (z, y)}
on S is symmetric but not antisymmetric. Thus a relation on a set may
• be both symmetric and antisymmetric,
• be neither symmetric nor antisymmetric or
• possess exactly one of these two properties.
In this section, we will be especially interested in relations having all three of the properties reﬂexive,
antisymmetric and transitive.
Deﬁnition 11.4
A relation R on a nonempty set S is called a partial order relation or simply
a partial order on S if R is reﬂexive, antisymmetric and transitive.
That is, a partial order R on a nonempty set S has the following properties:
(1) reﬂexive:
a R a for all a ∈S;
(2) antisymmetric:
if a R b and b R a, then a = b for all a, b ∈S;
(3) transitive:
if a R b and b R c, then a R c for all a, b, c ∈S.
Deﬁnition 11.5 A nonempty set S together with a partial order R on S is called a partially
ordered set or, more simply, a poset. Such a partially ordered set is commonly denoted by (S, R).
The term poset, as an abbreviation for partially ordered set, was coined by Garrett Birkhoﬀin
his 1948 book Lattice Theory. (We’ll be introduced to the term lattice in Section 11.2.) We now
consider one of the best known partially ordered sets.
Example 11.6
The relation “less than or equal to” on the set Z of integers is a partial order. That is (Z, ≤) is
a poset. In particular, if a and b are two integers such that a ≤b and b ≤a, then a = b, which
implies that ≤is antisymmetric. In fact, (S, ≤) is a poset for every nonempty set S of integers or
real numbers.
♦
Just as the properties possessed by the equals relation = on the set Z can be considered the
inspiration for equivalence relation, the properties possessed by “less than or equal to” relation ≤
on Z can be considered the inspiration for the partial order relation. For this reason, the similar and
suggestive symbol ⪯is commonly used to represent a general partial order. Hence (S, ⪯) typically
represents a partially ordered set. In fact, it is common to refer to the symbol ⪯by less than or
equal to. Thus if a and b are elements of S and a ⪯b, then we say that a is less than or equal
to b or b is greater than or equal to a. If a ⪯b but a ̸= b, then we write a ≺b and say that a is
less than b or b is greater than a.

11.1. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS
389
Example 11.7
The divisibility relation | on the set N of positive integers is a partial order. Since a | a for every
positive integer a, the relation | is reﬂexive. Furthermore, if a | b and b | a for positive integers a
and b, then a = b. Thus the relation | is antisymmetric. In addition, if a | b and b | c for positive
integers a, b and c, then a | c. Hence the relation | is transitive. Thus (N, | ) is a partially ordered
set.
♦
Hasse Diagrams
Finite partially ordered sets can often be visualized with the aid of a diagram called a Hasse
diagram. Such diagrams are named for Helmut Hasse, an important German mathematician of the
20th century. Speciﬁcally, a Hasse diagram of a poset (S, ⪯) consists of a collection of points in
the plane (called vertices), one vertex for each element of S, such that
(1) if a ≺b, then the vertex b is placed higher than a in the diagram and
(2) if a ≺b and there is no element c ∈S such that a ≺c ≺b, then a line is drawn joining a and b.
Therefore, if a, b and c are elements of a poset (S, ⪯) such that a ≺c ≺b, then a, b and c are placed
successively higher in a Hasse diagram of (S, ⪯) and there is no line joining a and b. Nevertheless,
a ⪯b (in fact, a ≺b) is inferred by the transitivity of the partial order ⪯.
Example 11.8
For S = {2, 3, 6, 12, 18}, Hasse diagrams are drawn in Figure 11.1 both for (S, ≤) and (S, | ).

Example 11.9
Let X be a set and S a collection of subsets of X, that is, S ⊆P(X). Then (S, ⊆) is a partially
ordered set. To see this, ﬁrst observe that A ⊆A for every subset A of X in S. Thus ⊆is reﬂexive.
If A and B are elements of S such that A ⊆B and B ⊆A, then A = B. Hence ⊆is antisymmetric.
Finally, for elements A, B and C of S such that A ⊆B and B ⊆C, it follows that A ⊆C. Therefore,
⊆is transitive. In particular, for the power set P(X) itself, it follows that (P(X), ⊆) is a poset. ♦
Example 11.10
Let X = {a, b, c} and let S = P(X). By Example 11.9, (S ⊆) is a poset. In this case,
S = P(X) = {∅, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, X}.
A Hasse diagram of (S, ⊆) is shown in Figure 11.2.
♦
Despite the great similarity of the partially ordered sets (Z, ≤), (N, | ) and (P(X), ⊆) for a set
X, there are also some important diﬀerences.

Deﬁnition 11.11
Two elements a and b in a partially ordered set (S, ⪯) are called comparable
if either a ⪯b or b ⪯a. If neither a ⪯b nor b ⪯a, then a and b are incomparable.
Example 11.12
In the partially ordered set (Z, ≤) every two integers a and b are comparable, that is, a ≤b or b ≤a.
This is not the case for the partially ordered set (N, | ), however. For example, neither 2 | 3 nor
3 | 2; that is, 2 and 3 are incomparable in (N, | ). If X = {1, 2}, then {1}, {2} ∈P(X). However,
{1} ̸⊆{2} and {2} ̸⊆{1} and so {1} and {2} are incomparable elements in the poset (P(X), ⊆). ♦
If (S, ⪯) is a partially ordered set, then the adjective “ordered” in “partially ordered” is meant
to suggest that the elements of S are ordered in some way. If a, b ∈S and a ≺b, then one can
think of a as preceding b in some manner. On the other hand, the adverb “partially” in “partially
ordered” is meant to suggest that not all pairs of elements of S may be ordered (related), that is,
some pairs of elements of S may be incomparable.
Partially ordered sets occur naturally in many common situations. We often encounter projects
that need to be performed. If a project is suﬃciently complex, it may be useful, if not necessary,
to divide the project into a number of smaller steps or activities. Ordinarily, these activities are
interrelated where a certain activity in the project cannot be started until other activities have been
completed. We consider two examples of this.
Example 11.13
Suppose that constructing a house consists of performing the following activities. (Each of these
activities could very well be considered a project itself and then divided into smaller activities.)
Clear Land (C)
Build Foundation (F)
Build Upper Structure (U)
Put on Roof (R)
Do Electrical Work (E)
Do Plumbing Work (P)
Place Siding on House (S)
Complete Interior Work on House (I)
Do Landscaping (L)
Let A = {C, F, U, R, E, P, S, I, L}. Then (A, ⪯) is a poset, where for X, Y ∈A, we have X ≺Y if
activity X must be completed before activity Y can be started. A possible Hasse diagram of (A, ⪯)
is shown in Figure 11.3. This Hasse diagram provides a pictorial blueprint for this project.

Totally Ordered Sets
Notice that in the poset (S, ⪯) of Example 11.14 (involving converting the lower level of a house
into a recreation room) every two elements (activities) of S are comparable. This is an example of
a special kind of poset.
Deﬁnition 11.15
A partially ordered set (S, ⪯) in which every two elements of S are comparable
is called a totally ordered set (or linearly ordered set) and the partial order ⪯is called a total
order (or linear order) on S.
Therefore, the poset (S, ⪯) of Example 11.14 is totally ordered; while the poset (A, ⪯) of Exam-
ple 11.13 is not totally ordered. Since the poset (S, ⪯) of Example 11.14 is totally ordered, there is a
unique order for the steps to be performed when preparing the lower level of a house for a recreation
room.

392
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
Deﬁnition 11.16
Every totally ordered subset of a poset (S, ⪯) is called a chain in S.
Therefore, the poset (S, ⪯) of Example 11.14 is itself a chain, while {C, F, U, E, I} is a chain in
the poset (A, ⪯) of Example 11.13 since C ≺F ≺U ≺E ≺I.
Example 11.17
The poset (Z, ≤) in Example 11.12 is a totally ordered set, while the poset (N, | ) is not totally
ordered. The elements of the subset S = {1, 2, 22, 23, . . .} produce a chain in (N, | ). Furthermore, if
X = {1, 2}, then (P(X), ⊆) is not a totally ordered set either. On the other hand, ∅⊂{1} ⊂{1, 2}
is a chain in (P(X), ⊆).
♦
A well-known partial order that is obtained from two or more partial orders is the lexicographic
order. Let (A, ⪯A) and (B, ⪯B) be two partially ordered sets. Therefore, ⪯A and ⪯B denote partial
orders on A and B, respectively. The lexicographic order ⪯is deﬁned on the Cartesian product
A × B of A and B by
(a, b) ⪯(c, d)
if
(1) a ≺A c or (2) a = c and b ⪯B d.
(11.1)
The lexicographic order is a partial order on A × B.
Example 11.18
For A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 3, 6}, both (A, | ) and (B, | ) are partially ordered sets. Thus (A×B, ⪯)
is a partially ordered set for the lexicographic order ⪯on A × B. In particular, (1, 3) ⪯(2, 3) since
1 | 2 and (2, 3) ⪯(2, 6) since 2 = 2 and 3 | 6, while (2, 3) and (3, 6) are incomparable elements of
A × B.
♦
If (A, ⪯A) and (B, ⪯B) are two totally ordered sets, then even more can be said about (A×B, ⪯).
Theorem 11.19
Let (A, ⪯A) and (B, ⪯B) be totally ordered sets. Then the lexicographic order ⪯
deﬁned on A × B in (11.1) is a total order.
Proof. Let (a, b) and (c, d) be two elements of A × B.
We show that either (a, b) ⪯(c, d) or
(c, d) ⪯(a, b). Since ⪯A is a total order on A, either a = c, a ≺A c or c ≺A a. If a ≺A c, then
(a, b) ⪯(c, d). If c ≺A a, then (c, d) ⪯(a, b). Hence we may assume that a = c. If b ⪯B d, then
(a, b) ⪯(c, d); otherwise, d ≺B b and (c, d) ⪯(a, b).
A lexicographic order can also be deﬁned on the Cartesian product of more than two sets. Let
(A1, ⪯1), (A2, ⪯2), . . ., (An, ⪯n) be n ≥2 partially ordered sets. The lexicographic order ⪯is
deﬁned on A1 × A2 × · · · × An by
(a1, a2, . . . , an) ⪯(b1, b2, . . . , bn)
if
(1) a1 ≺1 b1 or (2) ai = bi for all i with 1 ≤i ≤k
(11.2)
for some k ≤n and ak+1 ≺k+1 bk+1 if k < n.
If (A1, ⪯1), (A2, ⪯2), . . ., (An, ⪯n) are totally ordered sets, the lexicographic order ⪯deﬁned on
A1 × A2 × · · · × An as in (11.2) is also a total order (see Exercsie 29). The best known example of
this concerns ordering English words in a dictionary.
Let A denote the set consisting of the 26 letters of the English alphabet, that is, A ={α1, α2,
. . ., α26}, where αi indicates the ith letter of the alphabet. In other words, α1 = a, α2 = b, . . .,
α26 = z. We deﬁne αi ≤αj if i ≤j. Then (A, ≤) is a totally ordered set. The Cartesian product of

11.1. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS
393
n ≥1 sets A is denoted by An. Then (An, ⪯) is a totally ordered set, where ⪯is the lexicographic
order on An. In this context, it is customary to write a1a2 · · · an rather than (a1, a2, . . . , an) for an
element of An, which we refer to as a word of length n. Let W denote the set of all words (of any
length), that is,
W = {w ∈An : n ∈N}.
Let a1a2 · · · am be a word of length m, let b1b2 · · · bn be a word of length n and let r denote the
minimum of m and n, that is, r = min(m, n). We deﬁne the relation R on W by
a1a2 · · · am R b1b2 · · · bn
if
(1) a1a2 · · · ar ≺b1b2 · · · br in (Ar, ⪯) or
(2) a1a2 · · · am = b1b2 · · · bm and m ≤n.
This total lexicographic order is also called the dictionary order on the poset (W, R). The words
below would therefore occur in a dictionary in the order indicated:
cane cat catch map mat matter mop move movers moving.
Maximal and Minimal Elements
An element M in a poset (S, ⪯) is called a maximal element of S if M is not less than any
other element of S; that is, M is a maximal element of S if there is no element a ∈S such that
M ≺a. Similarly, an element m in S is a minimal element of S if there is no element of S that
is less than m; that is, m is a minimal element of S if there is no element a ∈S such that a ≺m.
Example 11.20
The element 18 in the poset (S, ≤) of Figure 11.1 is the only maximal element, while 2 is the only
minimal element.
In the poset (S, | ) of Figure 11.1, the integers 12 and 18 are both maximal
elements and 2 and 3 are both minimal elements. In the poset (P(X), ⊆) of Figure 11.2, X is the
only maximal element and ∅is the only minimal element.
♦
Every ﬁnite nonempty poset has both a minimal and a maximal element. We prove the ﬁrst of
these facts. The proof of the second of these is left as an exercise (see Exercise 21).
Theorem 11.21
Every ﬁnite nonempty poset has a minimal element.
Proof. Let (S, ⪯) be a ﬁnite nonempty poset. Among the chains in S, let
x1 ≺x2 ≺· · · ≺xk
be one containing a maximum number of elements. There can be no element x0 ∈S such that
x0 ≺x1, for otherwise, x0 ≺x1 ≺x2 ≺· · · ≺xk would be a chain with more than k elements.
Hence x1 is a minimal element of S.
While Theorem 11.21 guarantees that every ﬁnite poset (S, ⪯) has at least one minimal element,
it does not provide us with a method for ﬁnding such an element. Of course, if we are given a Hasse
diagram of (S, ⪯), then it is quite easy to locate a minimal element as any element at the lowest
level in the diagram is a minimal element. On the other hand, if (S, ⪯) is presented as a pair of sets,
namely the set S and the set ⪯of ordered pairs, then there is a variety of methods that can be used
to locate a minimal element in (S, ⪯). As an illustration, we present one such algorithm. Although
it is a minor point, we can assume that only the ordered pairs (a, b) of ⪯for which a ̸= b are given.

Algorithm 11.22
Find a minimal element in a ﬁnite poset.
This algorithm ﬁnds a minimal element in a ﬁnite poset (S, ⪯), where s : a1, a2, . . . , an is a list of
the n elements of S and s′ : e1, e2, . . . , em is a list of the m elements (a, b) of ⪯for which a ̸= b.
Input: Two positive integers n and m, a list s : a1, a2, . . . , an of the n elements of S and a
list s′ : e1, e2, . . . , em of the m elements (a, b) of ⪯for which a ̸= b.
Output: A minimal element x of (S, ⪯).
1. x := a1 [x is initially assigned the element a1]
2. for i := 2 to n do [i is assigned the integers from 2 to n]
3.
for j := 1 to m do [j is assigned the integers from 1 to m]
4.
if ej = (ai, x) then x := ai and j := m + 1. [If ej is the ordered pair (ai, x),
then x is reassigned the element ai and j is assigned the value m + 1.]
5. output x
That a minimal element of (S, ⪯) is indeed produced by Algorithm 11.22 is veriﬁed next.
Theorem 11.23
Algorithm 11.22 produces a minimal element in a ﬁnite poset (S, ⪯).
Proof. We use the notation introduced in Algorithm 11.22.
Suppose that the element x = ar
(1 ≤r ≤n) is output by the algorithm. If r = 1, then no element of S distinct from a1 is less than
a1 and so a1 is certainly a minimal element of (S, ⪯). Hence we may assume that r ̸= 1. Suppose
that the distinct elements of S that are assigned to x as we proceed through Algorithm 11.22 are,
in order, a1, at, . . . , as, ar. Therefore, 1 < t < · · · < s < r and
C : ar ≺as ≺· · · ≺at ≺a1
is a chain. By the transitive property, ar is less than every element that follows ar in the chain C.
We claim that ar is a minimal element of (S, ⪯). Assume, to the contrary, that ak ≺ar for some
ak ∈S. By Algorithm 11.22, we cannot have k > r. Thus k < r. Since ak ≺ar and ar ≺a1, it
follows by the transitive property that ak ≺a1. If ak is in the chain C, then ar ≺ak. This, however,
is impossible since ⪯is antisymmetric. Thus ak is not in the chain C. Therefore, there are positive
integers p and q such that p < k < q, where ap and aq are in C and aq ≺ap. Since ak ≺ar and
ar ≺ap, it follows that ak ≺ap. Since k < q, it follows by Algorithm 11.22 that aq cannot be the
element of S that immediately precedes ap in the chain C. This is a contradiction.
We now give an illustration of Algorithm 11.22.
Example 11.24
Illustrate Algorithm 11.22 for the poset (S, ⪯) whose Hasse diagram is shown in Figure 11.5.
Solution. Suppose that the elements of S listed in the expected order s : a1, a2, a3, a4, a5. Further-
more, suppose that the ordered pairs (a, b) of ⪯for which a ̸= b are listed in the sequence
s′: (a3, a1), (a2, a1), (a4, a1), (a4, a2), (a4, a3), (a5, a1), (a5, a2).
In this case, n = 5, m = 7 and s and s′ are input. In Step 1, x is initialized as a1. In the for loop at
Step 2, i is initially assigned the value 2. In the for loop at Step 3, j is initially assigned the value
1. In Step 4, it is ﬁrst determined whether e1 is (a2, a1). It is not. The value of j is increased to 2.
It is then determined whether e2 is (a2, a1). It is. By Step 4, x is reassigned the element a2 and j
is assigned the value m + 1 = 8. This completes Step 3 and so i is increased to 3. In the for loop at
Step 3, j runs through the values from 1 to m = 7. In Step 4, it is determined whether any ordered

pair ej is (a3, a2). This does not occur. So Step 3 has been completed, i is increased to 4 and we
return to the for loop at Step 3. Starting with j = 1, it is determined whether ej is (a4, a2). This
occurs when j = 4. So the conclusion of Step 4 is performed, reassigning x to a4 and assigning j
the value m + 1 = 8. This completes the for loop at Step 3. The integer i is then increased to 5 in
the for loop at Step 3. In Step 4, it is determined whether any ej is (a5, a4). This does not occur
and completes the for loop at Step 3 and, in turn, the for loop at Step 2. We therefore move on to
Step 5, where x = a4 is output as a minimal elememt in (S, ⪯).
♦
Topological Sorting
A recipe for preparing a food dish also gives rise to a partially ordered set.
Example 11.25
One of the recipes for making fresh cherry pie involves performing a number of steps:
D:
Prepare pie dough
L:
Line pie pan with pie dough
C:
Wash, drain and pit 4 cups of fresh cherries
M:
Mix cherries with 3 tablespoons of tapioca and 1 1
2 cups of sugar
S:
Let fruit mixture stand for 15 minutes
P:
Preheat oven to 450o
F:
Pour fruit mixture into pie shell
B:
Bake pie for 10 minutes at 450o and another 30 minutes at 350o
or until golden brown.
Some of these steps can only be performed after other steps have been completed. A partial
order on the set A of all steps is deﬁned by step X ≺step Y if step Y can be performed only after
step X has been completed. This produces a poset (A, ⪯), a Hasse diagram of which is shown in
Figure 11.6.

CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
If a cook has decided to follow the recipe in Example 11.25 to make fresh cherry pie, then a
natural question to ask is: In what order should steps be taken to make the pie (since the cook
cannot do more than one step at a time)? One possible order is
D L C M S P F B.
This is an acceptable order since
D ≺L ≺C ≺M ≺S ≺P ≺F ≺B.
This total order then provides us with an order in which all steps in the recipe can be performed
such that when any step is ready to be performed, all predecessors of this step have already been
performed. That is, the steps in this recipe for making a fresh cherry pie can be listed in a cookbook
in the order given above. This gives rise to a new concept.
Deﬁnition 11.26 Let (S, R) be a poset. A total order ⪯on S is said to be compatible with the
partial order R if a ⪯b whenever a R b for all a, b ∈S. That is, a total order ⪯on S is compatible
with R if the set ⪯of ordered pairs contains R. In this case, ⪯is a topological sorting of (S, R).
This concept is illustrated with a simple example.
Example 11.27
Let S = {x, y, z}. A Hasse diagram of a poset (S, R) is shown in Figure 11.7. A Hasse diagram of a
totally ordered set (S, ⪯) is also shown in Figure 11.7. Observe that (y, x) and (z, x) are elements
of R, that is, y R x and z R x. Since y ⪯x and z ⪯x, it follows that ⪯is a topological sorting of
(S, R). The fact that z ⪯y and that y and z are incomparable in (S, R) is irrelevant. If we think of
the elements of S in the poset (S, R) as three tasks that are to be performed and that x cannot be
performed until y and z are ﬁrst performed, then the topological sorting of (S, ⪯) of (S, R) tells us
that we could perform the three tasks of S in the order z, y, x.

Figure 11.7: A topological sorting of the poset in Example 11.27
We now present an algorithm that describes a method of constructing a topological sorting of
any ﬁnite poset. Recall (from Chapter 6) that in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an, where 1 ≤i < j ≤n,
the insertion command insert(aj →ai) places the term aj into the position where ai is located,
while the elements ai, ai+1, . . . , aj−1 are moved one position to the right and then the terms of s are
relabeled, denoting the resulting sequence by a1, a2, . . . , an again. This is reviewed Figure 11.8.

This algorithm ﬁnds a topological sorting of a ﬁnite poset (S, ⪯) of cardinality n whose elements are
listed in a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an.

If Algorithm 11.28 employs Algorithm 11.22 to ﬁnd a minimal element in (S, ⪯) and in the
subsequent posets produced in Step 4 of Algorithm 11.28, then we also need to input a list s′ :
e1, e2, . . . , em of all m elements (a, b) of the partial order relation ⪯for which a ̸= b as well as the
positive integer m. We illustrate Algorithm 11.28 by ﬁnding a topological sorting of a ﬁnite poset.
Example 11.29
Construct a topological sorting of the poset (S, ⪯), a Hasse diagram of which is given in Figure 11.9

Figure 11.9: A Hasse diagram for the poset in Example 11.29
Solution. In the for loop at Step 1 in Algorithm 11.28, i is initially assigned the value 1.
In
Step 2, Algorithm 11.22 is applied to ﬁnd a minimal element, namely z. In Step 3, the sequence s is
reordered, so now s : z, u, v, w, x, y, the set S is redeﬁned as S = {u, v, w, x, y} and j is reassigned the
value n + 1 = 7 in Step 4. This completes Step 2 for i = 1 and i is increased to 2. Algorithm 11.22
is applied again to the new set S, arriving at x. The sequence s is reordered once again and now
s : z, x, u, v, w, y. The value of j is changed to n + 1 = 7, completing Step 2 for i = 2. Continuing
in this manner, we eventually arrive at a ﬁnal ordering s : z, x, w, u, y, v, which is then a topological
sorting of (S, ⪯).
♦
Since the poset (S, ⪯) in Example 11.29 is suﬃciently simple and we have a Hasse diagram for it
in Figure 11.9, we can construct a topological sorting without applying Algorithm 11.22. First, we
choose a minimal element of (S, ⪯), namely z, which is the only minimal element of (S, ⪯). There
are two minimal elements in (S −{z}, ⪯), namely x and y. Either can be chosen next, say we choose
x. In the set S −{z, x}, there are two minimal elements, namely y and w. We choose w, say. In
the set S −{z, x, w}, y and u are the minimal elements. We choose u. Since y is the only minimal

398
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
element in S −{z, x, w, u}, we choose y and v is the only element remaining. This produces the
topological sorting
z ≺x ≺w ≺u ≺y ≺v.
This procedure is shown in Figure 11.10.

A certain program at a university requires a student to take the following mathematics and statistics
courses (depending on the mathematics courses the student took in high school):
PC:
Precalculus
C1:
Calculus I
C2:
Calculus II
PB:
Probability
S:

In order to take some of these courses, it is required that a student has successfully completed other
courses (in other words, some courses have required prerequisites). A partial order R is deﬁned on
the set A of these courses by X R Y if course X is a prerequisite for course Y . This produces a
poset (A, R), a Hasse diagram of which is shown in Figure 11.11.

When a course is taken, the student can be assured that he or she has taken all prerequisite courses.
Consequently, (A, ⪯) is a totally ordered set.

Greatest and Least Elements
An element M in a poset (S, ⪯) is a greatest element of S if a ⪯M for every a ∈S; while an
element m of S is a least element of S if m ⪯a for all a ∈S. Therefore, if M is a greatest element
of a poset, then M is greater than any other element in the poset; while if m is a least element of a
poset, then m is less than any other element in the poset.
Example 11.31
In the poset (S, ≤) in Figure 11.1, the integer 18 is the greatest element of S and 2 is the least
element. The poset (S, | ) in Figure 11.1 has neither a greatest nor a least element. In the poset
(P(X), ⊆) of Figure 11.2, the element X is the greatest element and ∅is the least element.
♦
Certainly every greatest element in a poset is a maximal element and every least element in
a poset is a minimal element. Neither converse is true however. While a poset can have several
maximal elements or minimal elements, this is not the case for greatest elements or least elements.
Theorem 11.32
Every nonempty poset contains at most one greatest element and at most one
least element.
Proof. Let (S, ⪯) be a poset. We show only that S has at most one greatest element. A proof
showing that S has at most one least element is similar and is left as an exercise (see Exercise 34).
The theorem is certainly true if S contains no greatest element. So we can assume that S contains
a greatest element. We show that such an element is unique. Suppose that M1 and M2 are both
greatest elements in S. Since M1 is a greatest element, it follows that M2 ⪯M1. On the other
hand, M2 is also a greatest element, so M1 ⪯M2. However, ⪯is antisymmetric, which implies that
M1 = M2. Consequently, S has only one greatest element.
Let (S, ⪯) be a poset. For a nonempty subset A of S, there may exist some element u ∈S such
that a ⪯u for all a ∈A. If this happens, then u is called an upper bound for A. If there is some
element ℓ∈S such that ℓ⪯a for all a ∈A, then ℓis a lower bound for A. If S itself has an upper
bound, then this upper bound is the greatest element of S. If S has a lower bound, then this lower
bound is the least element of S.
Example 11.33
In the poset (P(X), ⊆) of Figure 11.2, where X = {a, b, c}, let A1 = {∅, {a}, {b}}. Then both {a, b}
and X are upper bounds for A1, while ∅is the only lower bound for A1. In the poset (S, ≤) of
Figure 11.1, let A2 = {2, 6}. Then 6, 12 and 18 are all upper bounds of A2 and 2 is the only lower
bound for A2. On the other hand, in the poset (S, | ) of Figure 11.1, let A3 = {2, 3}. The elements
6, 12 and 18 are all upper bounds of A3, while there is no lower bound for A3.

11.2
Lattices
One of the best known discrete structures is the lattice.
Not only can lattices be described as
partially ordered sets having certain additional requirements, they are also algebraic structures
possessing certain properties.
Let (S, ⪯) be a poset and let A be a nonempty subset of S. An element x ∈S is a least upper
bound of A if x is an upper bound of A and x ⪯u for every upper bound u of A. An element y ∈S
is a greatest lower bound of A if y is a lower bound of A and ℓ⪯y for every lower bound ℓof
A. If a set A has a least upper bound, then this element is necessarily unique. The same is true of
greatest lower bounds. (See Exercise 1.) For this reason, we speak of the least upper bound of A
and the greatest lower bound of A. The least upper bound and the greatest lower bound of a subset
A in a poset (S, ⪯), should they exist, are denoted by lub(A) and glb(A), respectively. If the set A
consists of two elements of S, say A = {a, b}, then lub(A) is denoted by a ∨b and glb(A) is denoted
by a ∧b. The element a ∨b, if it exists, is called the join of a and b; while a ∧b, if it exists, is called
the meet of a and b.
Example 11.34
Figure 11.16 shows a Hasse diagram of a poset (S, ⪯), where S = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g}. This poset has a
as its greatest element and g as its least element. Let A = {b, c, d}. Then a is the only upper bound
of A and so necessarily a is the least upper bound of A. All elements e, f and g are lower bounds of
A. However, A has no greatest lower bound. Also, b ∨d = a, while b ∧d doesn’t exist. Furthermore,
e ∨f doesn’t exist, while e ∧f = g.
♦
Deﬁnition 11.35
A lattice is a poset in which every two elements have both a least upper bound
and a greatest lower bound.
The poset (S, ⪯) described in Figure 11.16 is not a lattice. As we saw in Example 11.34, the
elements b and d, for example, do not have a greatest lower bound. We now consider some examples
of posets that are lattices.

Figure 11.16: A Hasse diagram for the poset in Example 11.34
Example 11.36
Every totally ordered poset (S, ⪯) is necessarily a lattice. In particular, if a and b are two distinct
elements of S, then either a ≺b or b ≺a. If a ≺b, then a ∨b = b and a ∧b = a. As a consequence
of this, the poset (N, ≤) is a lattice. In this case, for positive integers a and b, a ∨b is the larger of
a and b and a ∧b is the smaller of a and b.
♦
Example 11.37
The poset (N, | ) is a lattice. For positive integers a and b, the join a ∨b of a and b is the least
common multiple of a and b, while the meet a ∧b of a and b is the greatest common divisor of a
and b.
♦
Example 11.38
For a nonempty set X, the poset (P(X), ⊆) is a lattice. For subsets A and B of X, A ∨B = A ∪B
and A ∧B = A ∩B.
♦
If (L, ⪯) is a lattice and a, b ∈L, then both a ∨b and a ∧b are unique elements of L. This says
that ∨and ∧associate with each element of the Cartesian product L×L a unique element of L. For
this reason, ∨and ∧are binary operations on the set L. The most common binary operations
are addition + and multiplication · on the set Z of integers or on the set R of real numbers. For a
set X, both union ∪and intersection ∩are binary operations on P(X). The binary operations ∨
and ∧are illustrated for the three lattices described above.
Example 11.39
For the lattice (N, ≤),
6 ∨15 = 15 and 6 ∧15 = 6.
For the lattice (N, | ),
6 ∨15 = 30 and 6 ∧15 = 3.
For the lattice (P(X), ⊆), where X = {2, 3, 5},
{2, 3} ∨{3, 5} = {2, 3, 5} and {2, 3} ∧{3, 5} = {3}. ♦
There are some familiar properties that many common binary operations satisfy. For example,
addition and multiplication of integers are commutative, namely
a + b = b + a and ab = ba for a, b ∈Z,

11.2. LATTICES
405
and are associative, namely
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (ab)c = a(bc) for a, b, c ∈Z.
For 2 × 2 matrices, addition is commutative but multiplication is not; for example,

While the union and intersection of sets are both commutative and associative, there are two added
properties, namely, for any two sets A and B,
A ∩(A ∪B) = A and A ∪(A ∩B) = A.
These are the absorption properties. Sets also satisfy the idempotent properties, namely for every
set A,
A ∪A = A and A ∩A = A.
Neither addition or multiplication of real numbers nor addition or multiplication of 2 × 2 matrices
satisfy the absorption properties and idempotent properties. However, every lattice satisﬁes all four
properties mentioned above.
Theorem 11.40
Let (L, ⪯) be a lattice. Then the following hold.
• Commutative Laws
a ∨b = b ∨a and a ∧b = b ∧a for all a, b ∈L.
• Associative Laws
(a ∨b) ∨c = a ∨(b ∨c) and (a ∧b) ∧c = a ∧(b ∧c) for all a, b, c ∈L.
• Absorption Laws
a ∧(a ∨b) = a and a ∨(a ∧b) = a for all a, b ∈L.
• Idempotent Laws
a ∨a = a and a ∧a = a for each a ∈L.
Proof.
The element a∨b is the least upper bound of the set {a, b}. Since {a, b} = {b, a}, it follows
that a ∨b is also the least upper bound of {b, a}, which is b ∨a. That is, a ∨b = b ∨a. Similarly,
a ∧b = b ∧a.
Since (a ∨b) ∨c is the least upper bound of a ∨b and c, it follows that a ∨b ⪯(a ∨b) ∨c and
c ⪯(a∨b)∨c. Furthermore, a ⪯a∨b and b ⪯a∨b. Since the relation ⪯is transitive, a ⪯(a∨b)∨c
and b ⪯(a ∨b) ∨c. Thus (a ∨b) ∨c is an upper bound for b and c. Therefore,
b ∨c ≤(a ∨b) ∨c.
Now, (a ∨b) ∨c is an upper bound for a and b ∨c, so
a ∨(b ∨c) ⪯(a ∨b) ∨c.
Similarly, (a ∨b) ∨c ⪯a ∨(b ∨c). Since ⪯is antisymmetric, (a ∨b) ∨c = a ∨(b ∨c). A similar
argument shows that (a ∧b) ∧c = a ∧(b ∧c).
Since a ∨b is the least upper bound of a and b, it follows that a ⪯a ∨b and b ⪯a ∨b. Since
⪯is reﬂexive, a ⪯a. Thus a is a lower bound of both a and a ∨b. Therefore, a ⪯a ∧(a ∨b).
Because a ∧(a ∨b) is a lower bound of both a and a ∨b, it follows that a ∧(a ∨b) ⪯a. Since ⪯is
antisymmetric, a ∧(a ∨b) = a. A similar argument shows that a ∨(a ∧b) = a.

406
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
Since a ∨a is the least upper bound of a and a, it follows that a ⪯a ∨a. On the other hand,
since a is an upper bound for both a and a, it follows that a ∨a ⪯a. Thus a ∨a = a. Similarly,
a ∧a = a.
In mathematics, an algebraic structure typically consists of a nonempty set on which is deﬁned
one or more binary operations. A lattice can also be deﬁned independent of partial orders as an
algebraic structure with two binary operations. The common symbols for these operations are ∨
and ∧but these are not the join and meet as we do not even have a partial order in this case.
Deﬁnition 11.41
A lattice is a nonempty set L on which are deﬁned two binary operations ∨
and ∧satisfying the following three properties:
• Commutative Laws
a ∨b = b ∨a and a ∧b = b ∧a for all a, b ∈L.
• Associative Laws
(a ∨b) ∨c = a ∨(b ∨c) and (a ∧b) ∧c = a ∧(b ∧c) for all a, b, c ∈L.
• Absorption Laws
a ∧(a ∨b) = a and a ∨(a ∧b) = a for all a ∈L.
It was the research of and 1940 book Lattice Theory by the American mathematician Garrett
Birkhoﬀthat turned lattice theory into a major branch of modern algebra.
We saw in Theorem 11.40 that a lattice, deﬁned in terms of posets, satisﬁes a fourth property,
namely the idempotent laws. Actually, any algebraic structure on which are deﬁned two binary
operations satisfying the commutative laws, associative laws and absorption laws must also satisfy
the idempotent laws as well.
Theorem 11.42
A lattice L deﬁned as an algebraic structure in Deﬁnition 11.41 satisﬁes the
idempotent laws.
Proof.
Let a ∈L. We show that a ∨a = a and a ∧a = a. By the absorption laws,
a ∧(a ∨b) = a and a ∨(a ∧b) = a
for every a ∈L. Therefore, a ∧(a ∨a) = a and a ∨(a ∧a) = a and so
a ∨a
=
a ∨(a ∧(a ∨a)) = a
a ∧a
=
a ∧(a ∨(a ∧a)) = a,
and so the idempotent laws hold.
Bounded Lattices
Thus, when a lattice is deﬁned in terms of posets, as in Deﬁnition 11.35, we have a nonempty set
L and a partial order ⪯deﬁned on L such that every two elements of L have a least upper bound
and a greatest lower bound. The least upper bound of a and b is denoted by a ∨b and the greatest
lower bound of a and b is denoted by a ∧b, thereby giving rise to two binary operations ∨and ∧
satisfying several properties.
However, when a lattice is deﬁned as an algebraic structure in Deﬁnition 11.41, we have a
nonempty set L on which are deﬁned two binary operations ∨and ∧satisfying the commutative
laws, associative laws and absorption laws. For a, b ∈L, suppose that we deﬁne a relation ⪯on L
by
a ⪯b if a ∨b = b (or a ∧b = a).

11.2. LATTICES
407
Then ⪯is a partial order and the poset (L, ⪯) is a lattice. Hence lattices can be looked at from two
points of view. There are other properties of interest that a lattice may possess.
Deﬁnition 11.43 A lattice (L, ⪯) is bounded if L has both a greatest element and a least element.
Example 11.44
For a ﬁxed integer n ≥2, the lattice (S, ≤) of all positive integers less than or equal to n is bounded.
In fact, the greatest element in S is n and the least element in S is 1.
♦
Example 11.45
For a ﬁxed integer n ≥2, the lattice (S, | ) of all positive integer divisors of n is bounded. The
greatest element in S is n and the least element is 1.
♦
Example 11.46
For a nonempty set X with S = P(X), the lattice (S, ⊆) is bounded. The greatest element in this
lattice is X and the least element is ∅.
♦
In a general bounded lattice (L, ⪯), it is customary to denote the greatest element by 1 (typically
called the unity) and the least element by 0 (called the zero). Thus for every element a ∈L, we
have 0 ⪯a and a ⪯1. In fact,
0 ∧a = 0 and 1 ∨a = 1
for all a ∈L, while
0 ∨a = 1 ∧a = a.
Two common properties satisﬁed by set unions and intersections are the distributive properties,
namely for sets A, B and C,
A ∩(B ∪C) = (A ∩B) ∪(A ∩C) and A ∪(B ∩C) = (A ∪B) ∩(A ∪C).
Some lattices possess a related property.
Distributive Lattices
Deﬁnition 11.47
A lattice (L, ⪯) is distributive if the following hold.
• Distributive Laws
(D1) a ∧(b ∨c) = (a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c) for all a, b, c ∈L,
(D2) a ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∨b) ∧(a ∨c) for all a, b, c ∈L.
Strictly speaking, a lattice need only satisfy one of the two properties stated in Deﬁnition 11.47
to be distributive.
Theorem 11.48 A lattice (L, ⪯) satisﬁes property (D1) if and only if (L, ⪯) satisﬁes property (D2).
Proof.
Suppose ﬁrst that (L, ⪯) satisﬁes (D1). For a, b, c ∈L,
(a ∨b) ∧(a ∨c)
=
((a ∨b) ∧a) ∨((a ∨b) ∧c)
(distributive law (D1))
=
(a ∧(a ∨b)) ∨((a ∨b) ∧c)
(commutative law)
=
a ∨((a ∨b) ∧c)
(absorption law)
=
a ∨(c ∧(a ∨b))
(commutative law)
=
a ∨((c ∧a) ∨(c ∧b))
(distributive law (D1))
=
(a ∨(c ∧a)) ∨(c ∧b)
(associative law)
=
a ∨(c ∧b)
(absorption law)
=
a ∨(b ∧c)
(commutative law).

408
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
Thus (L, ⪯) satisﬁes distributive law (D2).
For the converse, assume that (L, ⪯) satisﬁes distributive law (D2). Then for all a, b, c ∈L,
(a ∧b) ∨(a ∧c)
=
((a ∧b) ∨a) ∧((a ∧b) ∨c)
(distributive law (D2))
=
(a ∨(a ∧b)) ∧((a ∧b) ∨c)
(commutative law)
=
a ∧((a ∧b) ∨c)
(absorption law)
=
a ∧(c ∨(a ∧b))
(commutative law)
=
a ∧((c ∨a) ∧(c ∨b))
(distributive law (D2))
=
(a ∧(c ∨a)) ∧(c ∨b)
(associative law)
=
a ∧(c ∨b)
(absorption law)
=
a ∧(b ∨c)
(commutative law).
Thus (L, ⪯) satisﬁes distributive law (D1).
For a nonempty set X with S = P(X), the lattice (S, ⊆) of subsets of X is therefore distributive.
The lattice (S, | ) of all positive integer divisors of an integer n ≥2 is also distributive.
Example 11.49
The lattice (L, ⪯) whose Hasse diagram is shown in Figure 11.17 is not distributive.

Solution.
First observe that
b ∧(c ∨d) = b ∧e = b.
Since
(b ∧c) ∨(b ∧d) = a ∨a = a,
it follows that b ∧(c ∨d) ̸= (b ∧c) ∨(b ∧d) and so (L, ⪯) is not distributive.
♦
Complemented Lattices
There are occasions in a bounded lattice when for a given element a of the lattice, there may be
another element b such that the least upper bound and the greatest lower bound of {a, b} are the
unity and zero element, respectively.
Deﬁnition 11.50
Let (L, ⪯) be a bounded lattice with unity 1 and zero element 0. For a ∈L, an
element a ∈L is called a complement of a if both
a ∨a = 1 and a ∧a = 0.
The lattice (L, ⪯) is complemented if every element of L has a complement.
There is an example of a complemented lattice that we have encountered earlier and often.

11.2. LATTICES
409
Example 11.51
For a nonempty set X, the lattice (P(X), ⊆) is bounded and distributive. Show that (P(X), ⊆) is
also complemented.
Solution.
We have seen that the unity in this lattice is X and the zero element is ∅. Let A ∈S.
Consider the set complement A = X −A. Then A ∨A = A ∪A = X and A ∧A = A ∩A = ∅. Hence
A is a complement of A in the lattice (P(X), ⊆).
♦
Another lattice we have seen concerns the positive integer divisors of an integer n ≥2.
Example 11.52
Let S denote the set of all positive integer divisors of 12. Thus S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}. Then (S, | ) is
a bounded distributive lattice. Is S complemented?
Solution.
In this lattice, the unity is 12 and the zero element is 1. Furthermore, for a, b ∈S,
a ∨b = lcm(a, b) and a ∧b = gcd(a, b).
First, let a = 4.
Since 4 ∨3 = lcm(3, 4) = 12 and
4 ∧3 = gcd(3, 4) = 1, it follows that a = 3 is a complement of 4. Next, let a = 6. The only elements
b for which a ∨b = 12 are 4 and 12. However, 6 ∧4 = 2 and 6 ∧12 = 6. Therefore, the integer a = 6
does not have a complement in this lattice. Consequently, (S, ⪯) is not complemented.
♦
Example 11.53

Solution.
Observe that a ∨b = 1 and a ∧b = 0. Thus b is a complement of a. In fact, a ∨c = 1
and a ∧c = 0; that is, c is also a complement of a. Therefore, the element a in this lattice has two
complements.
♦
The element a (and the elements b and c as well) in the lattice discussed in Example 11.53 has
two complements and this lattice is not distributive. Such a situation cannot occur in a bounded
distributive lattice.
Theorem 11.54 Let (L, ⪯) be a bounded distributive lattice. If an element of L has a complement,
then it is unique.
Proof.
Suppose that there is an element a ∈L that has two complements, say b and c. Then
a ∨b = a ∨c = 1 and a ∧b = a ∧c = 0.
Therefore,
b
=
b ∨0 = b ∨(a ∧c) = (b ∨a) ∧(b ∨c)
=
1 ∧(b ∨c) = (a ∨c) ∧(b ∨c)
=
(c ∨a) ∧(c ∨b) = c ∨(a ∧b) = c ∨0 = c

and so b = c.
Since every element in a bounded distributive lattice that has a complement has only one com-
plement, we denote this unique complement of a by a.

Boolean Algebras
It is often the case in mathematics that while studying certain structures of interest, it is observed
that these structures have some properties in common. This suggests introducing a new concept,
deﬁned as a structure possessing these properties. If it can be proved that each such newly deﬁned
structure possesses other properties, then the original structures being studied must satisfy these
additional properties as well. That is, we can learn information about all of the given structures by
studying properties possessed by this more general structure. This brings us to the main subject of
this section.
In the preceding section, we saw that some lattices are bounded and therefore contain a unity 1
and zero element 0. Furthermore, some bounded lattices are distributive and some are complemented
(each element has a complement). Bounded lattices with both of these properties are of special
interest.
Deﬁnition 11.55
A Boolean algebra is a bounded lattice that is both distributive and comple-
mented.
It is common to require 0 and 1 to be distinct elements in a Boolean algebra and for this reason
we assume that every Boolean algebra contains at least two elements.
One might very well wonder why such lattices are referred to as a type of algebra. After all,
the term algebra probably suggests algebraic expressions constructed by adding and multiplying
variables. The properties possessed by a Boolean algebra are reminiscent of logical equivalences
we’ve seen involving the disjunction, conjunction and negations of statements as well as properties
involving the union, intersection and complements of subsets of a given set.
This gives rise to
an alternative interpretation of a Boolean algebra, namely one whose deﬁnition is independent of
lattices. When deﬁned in this new manner, it is common practice to use + (addition) as one binary
operation, rather than ∨or ∪and to use · (multiplication) as the other binary operation, rather
than ∧or ∩. From this point of view, we are now dealing with an algebraic structure.
Deﬁnition 11.56
A Boolean algebra is a set S with two or more elements on which are deﬁned
two binary operations called addition + and multiplication · (and so a + b and a · b = ab are unique
elements of S for a, b ∈S) satisfying the following properties:
• Commutative Laws
a + b = b + a and a · b = b · a for all a, b ∈S.
• Associative Laws
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) and (a · b) · c = a · (b · c) for all a, b, c ∈S.

11.3. BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
413
• Distributive Laws
a · (b + c) = (a · b) + (a · c) and a + (b · c) = (a + b) · (a + c) for all a, b, c ∈S.
• Existence of Zero and Unity
There exist distinct elements 0, 1 ∈S such that a + 0 = a and a · 1 = a for each a ∈S.
• Existence of Complements
For every a ∈S, there exists a ∈S such that a + a = 1 and a · a = 0.
On occasion, a Boolean algebra deﬁned in this way is denoted by (S, +, ·). If the two binary
operations are understood, then this Boolean algebra may be denoted simply by S. It should be
emphasized that although the two binary operations mentioned in Deﬁnition 11.56 of a Boolean al-
gebra are denoted by + and · and are called addition and multiplication, these are not the addition
and multiplication with which we are familiar when dealing with integers and real numbers. Fur-
thermore, the elements 0 and 1 of S are not integers in general. Each is an element of S possessing
a very special property.
From what we saw in the preceding section, it therefore follows that the power set S of a ﬁnite
nonempty set X, where addition and multiplication are deﬁned on S by
A + B = A ∪B and A · B = A ∩B
for A, B ∈S, is a Boolean algebra. In this case, the unity 1 in the deﬁnition of a Boolean algebra
is the set X and the zero element 0 is the empty set ∅.
Example 11.57
The set S of positive integer divisors of 30, where addition and multiplication are deﬁned on S by
a + b = lcm(a, b) and a · b = gcd(a, b)
for a, b ∈S, is a Boolean algebra. Thus S = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}. In this case, the unity 1 is the
integer 30 and the zero element 0 is the integer 1. Furthermore, the complement of the elements of
S are 1 = 30, 2 = 15, 3 = 10, 5 = 6, 6 = 5, 10 = 3, 15 = 2 and 30 = 1.
♦
All Boolean algebras satisfy a number of other familiar properties, including the following.
If (S, +, ·) is a Boolean algebra, then
• Absorption Laws
a · (a + b) = a and a + (a · b) = a for all a, b ∈S.
• Idempotent Laws
a + a = a and a · a = a for every a ∈S.
• Domination Laws
a + 1 = 1 and a · 0 = 0 for every a ∈S.
We now verify that every Boolean algebra satisﬁes these three laws. In the proof of the ﬁrst two
of these laws, the distributive laws play a key role.
Proposition 11.58
Every Boolean algebra satisﬁes the absorption laws.

414
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
Proof.
Let a and b be elements in a Boolean algebra. Then
a · (a + b)
=
(a + 0) · (a + b)
(property of zero)
=
a + (0 · b)
(distributive law)
=
a + (b · 0)
(commutative law)
=
a + 0
(domination law)
=
a
(property of zero)
and
a + (a · b)
=
(a · 1) + (a · b)
(property of unity)
=
a · (1 + b)
(distributive law)
=
a · (b + 1)
(commutative law)
=
a · 1
(domination law)
=
a
(property of unity).
Therefore, the absorption laws hold.
Proposition 11.59
Every Boolean algebra satisﬁes the idempotent laws.
Proof.
Let a be an element in a Boolean algebra. Then
a + a
=
(a + a) · 1
(property of unity)
=
(a + a) · (a + a)
(property of complement)
=
a + (a · a)
(distributive law)
=
a + 0
(property of complement)
=
a
(property of zero)
and
a · a
=
(a · a) + 0
(property of zero)
=
(a · a) + (a · a)
(property of complement)
=
a · (a + a)
(distributive law)
=
a · 1
(property of complement)
=
a
(property of unity).
Therefore, the idempotent laws hold.
Proposition 11.60
Every Boolean algebra satisﬁes the domination laws.
Proof.
Let a be an element in a Boolean algebra. Then
a + 1
=
a + (a + a)
(property of complement)
=
(a + a) + a
(associative law)
=
a + a
(idempotent law)
=
1
(property of complement)
and
a · 0
=
a · (a · a)
(property of complement)
=
(a · a) · a
(associative law)
=
a · a
(idempotent law)
=
0
(property of complement).

11.3. BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
415
Therefore, the domination laws hold.
Since the complement of an element in a distributive lattice is unique, the following result should
not be surprising.
Theorem 11.61
In a Boolean algebra, every element has a unique complement.
Proof.
Let S be a Boolean algebra and let a ∈S. Then there is an element a ∈S such that
a+a = 1 and a·a = 0. Suppose that b is an element of S with the properties a+b = 1 and a·b = 0.
We show that b = a. Observe that
b
=
b + 0
(property of zero)
=
b + (a · a)
(property of complement)
=
(b + a) · (b + a)
(distributive law)
=
(a + b) · (a + b)
(commutative law, twice)
=
1 · (a + b)
(property of element b)
=
(a + a) · (a + b)
(property of complement)
=
(a + a) · (a + b)
(commutative law)
=
a + (a · b)
(distributive law)
=
a + 0
(property of element b)
=
a
(property of zero).
Therefore, the complement of a is unique.
Corollary 11.62
Let S be a Boolean algebra. For every element a in S, a = a.
Proof.
Let a ∈S. Therefore, a represents the complement of the element a ∈S. By deﬁnition,
a + a = a + a = 1 and a · a = a · a = 0. By Theorem 11.61, a is the (unique) complement of a and
so a = a.
All Boolean algebras also satisfy De Morgan’s Laws.
Theorem 11.63
Every Boolean algebra S satisﬁes De Morgan’s Laws, namely
a + b = a · b and a · b = a + b for all a, b ∈S.
Proof.
We prove only the ﬁrst of these two laws. The second law can be proved in a similar
manner (see Exercise 1). Let a, b ∈S. To see that a + b = a · b, we show that a· b is the complement
of a + b. Hence we must verify that (a + b) + (a · b) = 1 and (a + b) · (a · b) = 0. First, observe that
(a + b) + (a · b)
=
((a + b) + a) · ((a + b) + b)
(distributive law)
=
((b + a) + a) · ((a + b) + b)
(commutative law)
=
(b + (a + a)) · (a + (b + b))
(associative law)
=
(b + 1) · (a + 1)
(property of complement)
=
1 · 1
(domination law)
=
1
(property of unity).
Next,
(a + b) · (a · b)
=
(a · b) · (a + b)
(commutative law)
=
((a · b) · a) + ((a · b) · b)
(distributive law)
=
((b · a) · a) + ((a · b) · b)
(commutative law)

416
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
=
(b · (a · a)) + (a · (b · b))
(associative law)
=
(b · (a · a)) + (a · (b · b))
(commutative law)
=
(b · 0) + (a · 0)
(property of complement)
=
0 + 0
(domination law)
=
0
(property of zero).
Therefore, a + b = a · b.
The Duality Principle
You may have observed that many of the results concerning Boolean algebras occur in pairs.
Furthermore, if the proofs of the two results in each pair are studied carefully, then one might also
observe that these two proofs are closely related. Indeed, often the statement of one result in such
a pair can be obtained from the other by interchanging + and · and interchanging 0 and 1. From
this, it follows that for each property of a Boolean algebra, there is a dual property. In fact, this
principle is referred to as the duality principle.
The Duality Principle for Boolean Algebras For each theorem concerning a Boolean algebra
S, there is a dual theorem concerning S obtained by interchanging + and · and by interchanging 0
and 1.
For example, each of De Morgan’s two laws in Theorem 11.63 can be obtained from the other by
the duality principle. The following examples also illustrate the duality principle.
Theorem 11.64
Let S be a Boolean algebra and let a, b ∈S. Then
a · b + a · b = a.
Proof.
Observe that a · b + a · b = a · (b + b) = a · 1 = a.
We have an immediate corollary of Theorem 11.64 by the duality principle.
Corollary 11.65
Let S be a Boolean algebra and let a, b ∈S. Then
(a + b) · (a + b) = a.
Theorem 11.66
For elements a and b in a Boolean algebra, a · b = a if and only if a · b = 0.
Proof.
Assume ﬁrst that a · b = a. Then
a · b = (a · b) · b = a · (b · b) = a · 0 = 0.
For the converse, assume that a · b = 0. Then
a · b = a · b + 0 = a · b + a · b = a · (b + b) = a · 1 = a,
giving the desired result.
Again, we have a corollary of Theorem 11.66 by the duality principle.
Corollary 11.67
For elements a and b in a Boolean algebra, a + b = a if and only if a + b = 1.
The best known and most useful Boolean algebra is also the simplest, consisting only of two
elements. Before describing this Boolean algebra, recall that when we encountered the operations of
disjunction, conjunction and negation of statements P and Q in Chapter 1, we obtained the truth
tables shown in Figure 11.22.

for these binary operations.

This gives rise to a Boolean algebra, namely one with two elements 1 and 0, where 1 denotes T
and 0 denotes F.

Let B = {0, 1}, where addition, multiplication and complementation are deﬁned as shown below.

Then B is a Boolean algebra. If we were to interpret 0 and 1 as integers, then we see that addition,
multiplication and complementation can also be deﬁned by
a + b
=
max(a, b) for a, b ∈B
a · b
=
min(a, b) for a, b ∈B
a
=
1 −a for a ∈B.
From the symmetry of the addition and multiplication tables above, it is clear that the commu-
tative laws hold. Since both (a + b) + c and a + (b + c) equal max(a, b, c), while both (a · b) · c and
a · (b · c) equal min(a, b, c), the associative laws hold. The distributive laws are more troublesome
to verify. Each of these properties requires eight cases to give a complete proof. For example, for
a = 1, b = 0 and c = 1,
a · (b + c) = 1 · (0 + 1) = 1 · 1 = 1 and a · b + a · c = 1 · 0 + 1 · 1 = 0 + 1 = 1;
while
a + (b · c) = 1 + 0 · 1 = 1 + 0 = 1 and (a + b) · (a + c) = (1 + 0) · (1 + 1) = 1 · 1 = 1.
The remaining two properties of this Boolean algebra follow immediately.
♦
Electronic switches (which can either be in the on position or oﬀposition) and optical switches
(which can either be lit or unlit) can be studied with the aid of the Boolean algebra B described in
Example 11.68. Because of the importance of the Boolean algebra B, the remainder of this section is
devoted exclusively to this Boolean algebra. Addition in B will be referred to as Boolean addition
and multiplication in B as Boolean multiplication.
In the following example, the two Boolean operations and complementation in B are used to
simplify two expressions.

418
CHAPTER 11. PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
Example 11.69
In the Boolean algebra B, compute and simplify the expressions (1 + 0) + (0 · 1) and 0 · (1 + 0).
Solution.
Observe that
(1 + 0) + (0 · 1) = 1 + 0 = 1 + 1 = 1
and
0 · (1 + 0) = 0 · 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 + 0 = 1. ♦
Boolean Functions
A variable x is called a Boolean variable if it takes on values from B, that is, x can either have
the value 1 or the value 0. By a Boolean function of degree n we mean a function f : Bn →B,
where Bn is the Cartesian product of n sets B, that is, Bn = B × B × · · · × B. A Boolean function
can be represented by a Boolean expression, constructed from Boolean variables and Boolean
operations.
Example 11.70
For Boolean variables x, y and z, the function f deﬁned by f(x, y, z) = x·y+z is a Boolean function.
(The product x · y of x and y can also be expressed by xy.) Since f : B3 →B, the function f has
degree 3. The values of this function are displayed in the table below.

The function f described in Example 11.71 can be expressed in several other equivalent ways.
For example, by one of the commutative laws,

11.3. BOOLEAN ALGEBRAS
419
f(x, y, z) = (x + y) · z = z · (x + y).
By a distributive law,
f(x, y, z) = z · (x + y) = z · x + z · y.
By one of De Morgan’s Laws,
f(x, y, z) = (x + y) · z = (x · y) · z.
We now consider the reverse question of being given the values of a function f, of degree 3 say
and this time asking for some Boolean expression that represents the function.
Example 11.72
The values of a Boolean function f of degree 3 are given in the table below.
Find a Boolean
expression that represents the function f.

Solution.
First observe that f(x, y, z) = 1 when x = y = z = 1. Notice that the product xyz
has the value 1 only when x = y = z = 1. Also, f(1, 0, 1) = 1. The product xyz has the value 1
only when x = z = 1 and y = 0. Similarly, the fact that f(1, 0, 0) = f(0, 1, 0) = 1 gives rise to the
products xy z and x yz. Hence if f is deﬁned by f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + x y z + x y z, then the
values of this function are exactly those given in the table.
♦
The function f in Example 11.72 given by
f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + x y z + xyz
is called the sum-of-products expansion or disjunctive normal form of the Boolean function
f. From this example, we see that every Boolean function has a sum-of-products expansion.
Example 11.73
Find the sum-of-products expansion of the Boolean function f of degree 3 deﬁned by
f(x, y, z) = (x + y)z.
Solution.
There is more than one way to solve this problem. First, observe that
f(x, y, z)
=
(x + y)z = xz + yz
=
x · 1 · z + 1 · yz
=
x(y + y)z + (x + x)yz
=
xyz + xyz + xyz + x y z
=
xyz + xyz + x y z,
where the last expression is obtained from the preceding expression since xyz + xyz = xyz by an
idempotent law.
Another way to solve this problem is to ﬁrst construct a table of functional values from the
Boolean expression that represents this function. This table is given below.

From this table, we obtain f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + x y z, which, of course, agrees with our earlier
answer.

There is another common form of a Boolean expression that represents a Boolean function. We
illustrate this in the following example.
Example 11.74
The values of a Boolean function f of degree 3 are given in the table below. Find two Boolean
expressions that represent f.

Solution.
First we can consider the sum-of-products expansion of f, which can be obtained by
looking at all triples (x, y, z) for which f(x, y, z) = 1. This gives us
f(x, y, z) = xyz + xyz + x y z + xyz + x y z.
A second expression can be constructed from those triples (x, y, z) for which f(x, y, z) = 0. One of
these triples is (1, 1, 1). Thus x + y + z = 0 only when x = y = z = 1. Furthermore, x + y + z = 0
only when x = 0 and y = z = 1, while x + y + z = 0 only when x = y = z = 0. Therefore,
(x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z) = 1
for all triples (x, y, z) of 0s and 1s, except for (1, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1) and (0, 0, 0). Hence
f(x, y, z) = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)
is another Boolean expression for f.
The second Boolean expression
f(x, y, z) = (x + y + z)(x + y + z)(x + y + z)
for the function f in Example 11.74 is called the product-of-sums expansion or conjunctive
normal form of the Boolean function f.

Combinatorial Circuits
Boolean algebra is named for George Boole, a British mathematician and philosopher of the
19th century. The Boolean algebra B forms the basis of modern computer arithmetic and Boole
is regarded as one of the founders of computer science. Although Boole never regarded logic as a
branch of mathematics, he described a close connection between the symbols of algebra and those
that appear in logic. He considered formal logic as mathematics restricted to two symbols, namely
0 and 1.
Boole’s work was extended and reﬁned by other mathematicians, including Augustus
De Morgan. Except for mathematicians who worked with logic, Boole’s work was rather obscure
for a long time as his work was thought to have no practical use. In 1930s, some 70 years after
Boole’s death, Claude Shannon was introduced to Boole’s work in a philosophy class he took at the
University of Michigan. In his master’s thesis at MIT, Shannon showed how Boolean algebra could
be used to optimize the design of systems of electromechanical relays that were used in telephone
routing switches. He proved that circuits with relays could solve Boolean algebra problems.
The Boolean algebra B is used to model the circuitry of electronic devices. Each input and each
output can be thought of as an element of the set {0, 1}. Most computer processors are constructed
from a few simple circuits that have been designed in a way to make it easy for a designer to connect
the outputs of one circuit to the inputs of another circuit. In this manner, complex circuits can be
constructed from simple components.
Deﬁnition 11.75
A combinatorial circuit converts a combination of inputs, each 0 or 1, into
a uniquely deﬁned output, which is also either 0 or 1.
Every combinatorial circuit can be designed using the rules of Boolean algebra.
The basic
elements of such circuits are called gates, each type of which implements a Boolean operation. An
OR gate converts two inputs x and y into the output x + y. An OR gate is drawn as shown in
Figure 11.23(a). An AND gate converts two inputs x and y into the output x · y = xy. An AND
gate is drawn as shown in Figure 11.23(b). An inverter or NOT gate converts an input x into the
output x. A NOT gate is drawn as shown in Figure 11.23(c).

Figure 11.23: OR, AND and NOT gates
When combinations of circuits are formed, some gates may share inputs. There are two methods
of showing this. One method uses branchings, which indicate all gates using a particular input.
The other method indicates this input separately for each gate. This is illustrated in the circuit
shown in Figure 11.24(a) that produces the output xy + xy for the two inputs x and y. The circuit
in Figure 11.24(b) uses a branching.
Example 11.76
Find a combinatorial circuit that produces the output xyz + xyz + x y z.

Solution.
Although there is a circuit with nine gates that produces the desired output, we can
simplify the expression to obtain a simpler circuit with an equivalent output. Observe that
xyz + xyz + x y z
=
xy(z + z) + x y z
=
xy · 1 + x y z = xy · (1 + z) + x y z
=
(xy + xyz) + x y z
=
xy + x(y + y)z = xy + x · 1 · z
=
xy + xz = x(y + z).
The circuit with three gates shown in Figure 11.25 produces an output that is equivalent to
xyz + xyz + x y z.

lowest squares. This is called position 1 and is denoted by P1 (see Figure 11.33). A legal move
on the board consists of moving one of the coins to the next higher square. This results in
nine possible positions for the coins on the squares.

x ∈S. Prove that f is bijective if and only if (S, ⪯) is a totally ordered set.

Three homes are under construction and each home must be provided with connections to each
of three utilities, namely, water, electricity and natural gas. Each utility provider needs a direct
line from the utility terminal to each house without passing through another provider’s terminal or
another house along the way. Furthermore, all three utility providers need to bury their lines at
exactly the same depth underground without any lines crossing. Can this be done?
A total of eleven chemicals need to be shipped to a chemistry department at a university. Certain
pairs of chemicals can react with each other and so should not be placed in the same container when
shipped. Suppose that the chemicals are denoted by c1, c2, . . . , c11 and c1 cannot be shipped in the
same container with any of c2, c5, c7 or c10. The chemicals that cannot be shipped in the same
container are listed below:
c1 : c2, c5, c7, c10
c2 : c3, c6, c8 (as well as c1)
c3 : c4, c7, c9
c4 : c5, c8, c10
c5 : c6, c9
c11 : c6, c7, c8, c9, c10.
What is the smallest number of containers that can be shipped safely to the university?
These three questions and many others can be answered with the aid of a discrete structure
called a graph, which serves as a useful mathematical model in a variety of situations. In this ﬁrst of
four chapters dealing with graphs, we introduce many of the fundamental concepts of graph theory
and the basic notation used in this subject, as well as concepts related to paths and cycles in graphs.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
12.1
Fundamental Concepts of Graph Theory
A graph G consists of a ﬁnite nonempty set V of objects called vertices (the singular is vertex)
and a set E of 2-element subsets of V . Each element of E is called an edge. (Vertices are sometimes
referred to as nodes or points, while edges are sometimes called links or lines.) The set V is
called the vertex set of G, while E is the edge set of G. The fact that a graph G has vertex set
V and edge set E is indicated by writing G = (V, E). The vertex set and edge set of G are often
denoted by V (G) and E(G), respectively. It is common and convenient to denote an edge {x, y}
of a graph by xy or yx. If xy ∈E, then x and y are called adjacent vertices; otherwise, x and
y are nonadjacent vertices. If x and y are adjacent vertices, then the edge xy is said to join x
and y. Any vertex adjacent to a vertex x is called a neighbor of x and the set of neighbors of x is
the neighborhood of x, denoted by N(x). The edge xy is said to be incident to (or with) x and
y. If xy and yz are distinct edges of G, then xy and yz are adjacent edges. Thus wx and yz are
nonadjacent edges if and only if {w, x} ∩{y, z} = ∅.
The two sets V = {v1, v2, v3, v4, v5} and E = {v1v2, v2v3, v2v4, v3v4} deﬁne a graph G. In G, no
edge is incident to v5. It is common to represent a graph by a diagram, which is also referred to as
the graph itself. In the diagram, each vertex is represented by a point or a small circle and an edge
is represented by drawing a line or curve joining the corresponding points. A diagram of this graph
G is shown in Figure 12.2. Graphs can often be drawn in many ways. Sometimes diﬀerent drawings
of the same graph might suggest that we have two diﬀerent graphs but such is not the case.

We now consider some situations that can be modeled by graphs.
Example 12.1
A representative of a company ﬁnds it convenient to travel to eight cities, denoted by c1, c2, . . . , c8.
Her favorite airline has direct routes between various pairs of these cities. In particular, there are
direct routes from c1 to c3, c4, c7 and back again, which we denote by c1 : c3, c4, c7. The complete
set of direct routes is given below:
c1 : c3, c4, c7
c2 : c4, c8
c3 : c6, c8 (as well as c1)
c4 : c5, c7
c5 : c6, c7
Model this situation by a graph.
Solution. We construct a graph G whose vertex set consists of these eight cities. Two vertices
(cities) of G are adjacent if there is a direct ﬂight between these two cities. This graph G is shown
in Figure 12.3.

Example 12.2
Five graduating seniors (Avery, Benton, Casey, Donna and Edwin) have learned of six positions
available at an appliance company, a bank, a chemical company, a defense company, an electronics
company and a ﬁnancial institution. The students decide to apply for these positions as listed below.
Avery: bank, defense, ﬁnancial;
Benton: appliance, electronics;
Casey: bank, ﬁnancial;

jobs. Two vertices of G are adjacent if one vertex is a student and the other is a position for which
this student has applied. This graph G is shown in Figure 12.4.

this situation by a graph.
Solution. We construct a graph G with vertex set V such that two vertices are adjacent if one
divides the other. The graph G is shown in Figure 12.5.

The number of vertices in a graph G is referred to as the order of G, while the number of edges
is the size of G. Therefore, the order of the graph G of Figure 12.2 is 5 and its size is 4. We
commonly use n and m to denote the order and size, respectively, of a graph, that is, n = |V (G)|
and m = |E(G)|. If G is a graph of order n and size m, then n ≥1 and 0 ≤m ≤

. If n = 1, then
G contains exactly one vertex and is called a trivial graph. A nontrivial graph then has at least
two vertices. If G has no edges, then G is called an empty graph. A nonempty graph therefore
has at least one edge.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Although graphs can be described in terms of sets (the deﬁnition) or in terms of diagrams, there
are other ways in which graphs can be represented. One of these is by means of an adjacency list,
which associates with each vertex a list of its adjacent vertices. In an adjacency list of a graph G
each vertex v of G is listed in a column and every vertex of G adjacent to v is listed in a row to the
right of v. This is illustrated in Figure 12.6 for the graph G of Figure 12.2.

Graphs and Matrices
Another common way to represent a graph is by means of a matrix. Before describing this rep-
resentation, we present (or perhaps review) some fundamental facts concerning matrices, beginning
with the deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 12.4 A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers.
A matrix A having m rows and n columns is an m × n matrix. The numbers m and n are
referred to as the size of A. If m = n, then A is a square matrix. Typically, the element in row i,
column j of A is called the (i, j)-entry of A and is denoted by aij. The matrix A itself is then
written as A = [aij]. For example,
A =
 1
0
7
8
4
0

is a 2 × 3 matrix.
If every entry of a matrix is 0 or 1, then the matrix is called a zero-one matrix. For example,
A =


0
1
1
1
0
0
1
0
0

is a zero-one matrix.
Two matrices A and B can be added or multiplied depending on their sizes. In order for A and
B to be added, they must have the same size, that is, the same number of rows and columns.
Deﬁnition 12.5
Let A = [aij] and B = [bij] be two m × n matrices. The sum A + B of A and
B is the m × n matrix
A + B = [aij + bij].

A row matrix has a single row and a column matrix has a single column.
Deﬁnition 12.6 Let A be a row matrix and B a column matrix, each with n entries. Hence A is
a 1 × n matrix and B is an n × 1 matrix. The inner product or dot product A · B of A and B
is obtained by adding the products of the corresponding elements of A and B. That is, if

then

The product AB of two matrices A and B is deﬁned if the number of columns of A equals the
number of rows of B.
Deﬁnition 12.7 Let A be an m×n matrix and B an n×p matrix, where A = [aij] with 1 ≤i ≤m
and 1 ≤j ≤n, and B = [bjk], with 1 ≤j ≤n and 1 ≤k ≤p. Then the product C = AB of A
and B is the m × p matrix, where C = [cik] with 1 ≤i ≤m and 1 ≤k ≤p such that
cik = ai1b1k + ai2b2k + · · · + ainbnk =
n
X
j=1
aijbjk.
That is, to calculate the (i, k)-entry cik of C, we compute the inner product of row i of A (which
has n columns) and column k of B (which has n rows).

Determine the inner product of row 1 of the matrix A below and column 2 of the matrix B and
then compute the product C = AB.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
We can now describe a matrix representation of a graph. Suppose that G is a graph of order n,
where V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. The adjacency matrix of G is the n×n zero-one matrix A = [aij],
where

Figure 12.7: A graph and its adjacency matrix
There are several observations that can be made about the adjacency matrix A of a graph G of
order n. First, all entries along the main diagonal of A are 0 since no vertex of G is adjacent to
itself. Second, A is a symmetric matrix, that is, row i of A is identical to column i of A for every
integer i with 1 ≤i ≤n. Also, if we were to add the entries in row i (or in column i), then we obtain
the number of vertices adjacent to vi, which leads us to an important concept in graph theory.
The Degree of a Vertex
The number of neighbors of a vertex x in a graph G is the degree of x and is denoted by degG(x)
or simply deg(x) or deg x if the graph G is clear. Thus the degree of a vertex x is also the number
of edges incident with x, the number of vertices adjacent to x and |N(x)|. For the graph G of
Figure 12.2,
deg v1 = 1, deg v2 = 3, deg v3 = deg v4 = 2, deg v5 = 0.
A vertex of degree 0 is called an isolated vertex and a vertex of degree 1 is an end-vertex, a
leaf or a pendant vertex. In the graph G of Figure 12.2, v5 is an isolated vertex and v1 is an
end-vertex. The maximum degree of a graph G is the maximum of the degrees of the vertices of
G and is denoted by ∆(G), while the minimum degree of G is denoted by δ(G). Thus
0 ≤δ(G) ≤deg v ≤∆(G) ≤n −1
for every vertex v in a graph G of order n. For the graph G of order 5 in Figure 12.2, ∆(G) = 3 and
δ(G) = 0.
The sum of the degrees of the vertices of the graph G of Figure 12.2 is 8, which is twice the
size of G. In fact, the sum of the degrees of the vertices of every graph is twice its size. This fact
is often called the First Theorem of Graph Theory. This is actually an appropriate name for this
observation as it was noticed by the famous Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who used it in
1736 to prove the ﬁrst major theorem of graph theory (which we will visit in Section 12.3) despite
the fact that graphs did not appear in Euler’s work and hadn’t even been invented yet.
Theorem 12.10 (The First Theorem of Graph Theory) If G is a graph of order n and size
m with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}, then
n
X
i=1
deg vi = 2m.

12.1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF GRAPH THEORY
437
Proof. When the degrees of the vertices of G are summed, each edge of G is counted twice, once
for each of its two incident vertices.
Example 12.11 A graph G of size 29 has three vertices of each of the degrees 3, 5 and 6. The
remaining vertices of G have degree 4. What is the order of G?
Solution. Suppose that G has x vertices of degree 4. By Theorem 12.10, the sum of the degrees of
the vertices of G is 3 · 3 + 3 · 5 + 3 · 6 + 4x = 2 · 29 and so x = 4. Thus the order of G is therefore
9 + x = 13.
♦
A vertex in a graph is even if its degree is even and is odd if its degree is odd. The graph G of
Figure 12.2 has three even vertices, namely v3, v4 and v5 and the two odd vertices v1 and v2. Every
graph has an even number of odd vertices, another consequence of an observation by Euler in 1736.
Corollary 12.12
Every graph contains an even number of odd vertices.
Proof. Let G be a graph of size m. Since the sum of the degrees of the vertices of G is even, namely
2m, and the sum of the degrees of the even vertices of G is even, it follows that the sum of the
degrees of the odd vertices of G is even. Therefore, G has an even number of odd vertices.
A graph G is regular if every vertex of G has the same degree and is r-regular if this degree
is r. A 3-regular graph is also referred to as a cubic graph. Figure 12.8 shows r-regular graphs of
order 5 for r = 0, 2, 4. By Corollary 12.12, there is no 1-regular graph or 3-regular graph of order 5.

A graph H is a subgraph of a graph G if V (H) ⊆V (G) and E(H) ⊆E(G). If H is a subgraph
of a graph G and H ̸= G, then H is a proper subgraph of G. A subgraph H of a graph G is an
induced subgraph of G if whenever two vertices of H are adjacent in G, they are also adjacent
in H. A subgraph H of a graph G is a spanning subgraph of G if V (H) = V (G). Figure 12.9
shows a graph G and three subgraphs G1, G2, and G3 of G. While G3 is an induced subgraph of
G, neither G1 nor G2 are induced subgraphs of G. The subgraph G1 is a spanning subgraph of G
but neither G2 nor G3 are spanning subgraphs of G.

The complement of a graph G is that graph G with V (G) = V (G) such that two distinct
vertices u and v of G are adjacent in G if and only if u and v are not adjacent in G. Thus if G is
a graph of order n and size m, then the order of G is n and the size of G is

A graph G of order n is a path if the vertices of G can be labeled so that V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}
and E(G) = {vivi+1 : 1 ≤i < n}. A graph G of order n ≥3 is a cycle if the vertices of G can be
labeled so that V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and E(G) = {vivi+1 : 1 ≤i < n} ∪{v1vn}. A path of of
order n is denoted by Pn and a cycle of order n by Cn. The cycle C3 is also called a triangle. The
length of a path or cycle is the number of edges it contains. Hence the length of Pn is n −1 and
the length of Cn is n. Figure 12.12 shows several small paths and cycles. The three regular graphs
of order 5 in Figure 12.8 are then K5, C5 and K5.

Isomorphic Graphs
There is only one graph of order 1, two of order 2, four of order 3 and eleven of order 4. These
are all shown in Figure 12.13. By this is meant that there are eleven diﬀerent graphs of order 4. This
brings up the question as to what it means for two graphs to be diﬀerent or, for that matter, what
it means for two graphs to be the same. Two graphs G and H are considered to be the same graph
if they have the same structure. The technical term for this is isomorphic. In particular, whether
two graphs are the same or diﬀerent does not depend on how (or whether) the graphs are labeled or
how they may be drawn. Informally, two graphs G and H are the same (isomorphic) if either can
be drawn so that it looks like the other. Formally, we have the following.
Deﬁnition 12.13
A graph G is isomorphic to a graph H (written G ∼= H) if there exists a
bijective function φ : V (G) →V (H) such that two vertices u and v are adjacent in G if and only if

12.1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF GRAPH THEORY
439
φ(u) and φ(v) are adjacent in H. The graphs G and H are then called isomorphic graphs and
the function φ an isomorphism.

Figure 12.14: Isomorphic graphs
If G and H are isomorphic graphs, then there exists an isomorphism φ : V (G) →V (H). Since φ
is one-to-one and onto, |V (G)| = |V (H)|, that is, G and H have the same order. Furthermore, since
uv is an edge of G if and only if φ(u)φ(v) an edge of H, it follows that G and H have the same size.
These two facts as well as one other are summarized next.
Theorem 12.15
If G and H are isomorphic graphs, then
(a) G and H have the same order,
(b) G and H have the same size and
(c) the degrees of the vertices of G are the same as the degrees of the vertices of H.
Proof. The truth of (a) and (b) have already been noted. To verify (c), let φ : V (G) →V (H) be an
isomorphism and let v be a vertex of G such that degG v = k, where N(v) = {v1, v2, . . . , vk}. Let
{u1, u2, . . . , uℓ} be the set of vertices of G distinct from v that are not adjacent to v. Then φ(v) is ad-
jacent to all of φ(v1), φ(v2), . . . , φ(vk) and to none of φ(u1), φ(u2), . . . , φ(uℓ). Thus degH φ(v) = k.
The proof of Theorem 12.15(c) also shows that if G and H are isomorphic graphs and φ : V (G) →
V (H) is an isomorphism, then degG v = degH φ(v) for every vertex v of G.

440
CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Theorem 12.15 therefore states that every two isomorphic graphs must have the same order and
same size and that the degrees of the vertices of one graph are the same as the degrees of the vertices
of the other graph. Consequently, any two graphs having diﬀerent orders, diﬀerent sizes or whose
vertices have diﬀerent degrees are not isomorphic. The converse of the statement above is not true
however; that is, if two graphs have the same order, the same size and whose vertices have the same
degrees, then the graphs need not be isomorphic.
Example 12.16
The two graphs G and H in Figure 12.15 have order 6 and size 9 and the degree of every vertex of
each graph is 3; yet these two graphs are not isomorphic. Let’s see why. Assume, to the contrary, that
G and H are isomorphic. Then there is an isomorphism φ : V (G) →V (H). Since the three vertices
u1, v1, w1 are mutually adjacent in G, the vertices φ(u1), φ(v1), φ(w1) are mutually adjacent in H.
However, H does not contain three mutually adjacent vertices, which contradicts the assumption
that φ is an isomorphism. Thus G and H are not isomorphic. In other words, the graph G of
Figure 12.15 contains a triangle, while the graph H of Figure 12.15 does not.

Figure 12.15: Two non-isomorphic graphs
A graph G can be used to represent a network of highways connecting cities in a certain region,
where the vertices of G are the cities and an edge joins two vertices if there is a highway joining
the two cities that does not pass through an intermediate city. If two cities are joined by more than
one highway, then a graph does not accurately capture the structure of this network. A structure
consisting of a nonempty set of vertices in which two distinct vertices are permitted to be joined by
more than one edge is a multigraph. If two vertices are joined by two or more edges, then these
edges are called parallel edges (or multiple edges). An edge that joins a vertex to itself is a
loop. A structure that allows both parallel edges and loops (including multiple loops) is often called
a pseudograph. Two multigraphs and a pseudograph are shown in Figure 12.16. (Some authors
permit two vertices to be joined by more than one edge in a graph and use simple graph to refer
to graphs in which two vertices are joined by at most one edge. In our case, however, a graph does
not allow two vertices to be joined by two or more edges and does not allow loops.)

Connected Graphs
Suppose that from a vertex u in a graph G, we proceed to a neighbor v of u, then to a neighbor of v
and so on, until we ﬁnally conclude this procedure at some vertex w of G. (It may occur that some
vertices are encountered more than once and in fact that w = u.) What we have just described is a
walk from u to w in G.
Walks, Trails and Paths
Deﬁnition 12.17
A walk in a graph G is a sequence u0, u1, . . . , uk of vertices of G such that ui
and ui+1 are adjacent for 0 ≤i ≤k −1. We denote this sequence by
W = (u0, u1, . . . , uk).
(12.1)
Then W is a u0 −uk walk, where u0 is the initial vertex of W and uk is the terminal vertex
of W.
Since the walk W in (12.1) encounters k edges (counting multiplicities), namely, u0u1, u1u2, . . .,
uk−1uk, the walk W is said to have length k. The walk W is also said to contain these edges.
Therefore, a walk of length k contains at most k distinct edges. A walk of length 0 is a trivial walk
and contains no edges.
In the graph G of Figure 12.22, (x, z, w, v, w, y) is an x −y walk of length 5. In this walk, both
the vertex w and edge vw are encountered twice. This is perfectly acceptable. Indeed, a vertex of
G can appear in a walk any (ﬁnite) number of times and an edge can be encountered any (ﬁnite)

number of times. Each time an edge is encountered in a walk, however, it contributes 1 to the length
of the walk.
The following are also walks in the graph G of Figure 12.22:
W1 = (u, y, w, z), W2 = (z, x, z, x, z), W3 = (x), W4 = (w, v, u, w, z, y).
(12.2)
The walk W1 is a u −z walk of length 3, W2 is a z −z walk of length 4, W3 is the trivial x −x walk
of length 0 and W4 is a w −y walk of length 5.
Deﬁnition 12.18
A trail is a walk in which no edge is encountered more than once.
For example,
T = (v, w, y, z, w, u)
(12.3)
is a v −u trail of length 5 in the graph G of Figure 12.22. Observe that w occurs twice in the trail
T . Indeed, a vertex may occur more than once in a trail even though no edge can be encountered
more than once.
Deﬁnition 12.19
A path is a walk in which no vertex is repeated.
Therefore, the trail T in (12.3) is not a path. On the other hand,
P = (x, z, w, v, u)
(12.4)
is an x −u path of length 4 in the graph G of Figure 12.22. While every path is a trail and every
trail is a walk, the respective converses are not true.
A walk whose initial and terminal vertices are distinct is called an open walk. A closed walk
is a walk whose initial and terminal vertices are the same. The walks W1 and W4 in (12.2) are open,
while W2 and W3 are closed.
Deﬁnition 12.20
A circuit is a closed trail of length 3 or more.
For example, in the graph G of Figure 12.22,
C = (u, w, y, z, w, v, u)
(12.5)
is a circuit of length 6 (whose initial and terminal vertex is u). As this circuit C illustrates, a vertex
in a circuit may be repeated (in addition to the initial and terminal vertex).
Deﬁnition 12.21
A cycle is a circuit in which no vertex is repeated except that the initial vertex
is the terminal vertex. A cycle of length k is called a k-cycle and a 3-cycle is also referred to as a
triangle.
Hence the circuit C in (12.5) is not a cycle. The circuit
C∗= (w, u, v, w, y, z, w)

446
CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
in the graph G of Figure 12.22 is also not a cycle. On the other hand,
C′ = (u, v, w, z, y, u)
(12.6)
is a 5-cycle in the graph G of Figure 12.22. The cycle
C′′ = (w, y, z, w)
is a triangle in this graph. A cycle of even length is called an even cycle, while a cycle of odd
length is called an odd cycle. Triangles are therefore odd cycles.
The terms “path” and “cycle” therefore have two interpretations in a graph. They not only refer
to types of graphs and subgraphs, they also refer to types of routes that can be used to proceed
about in a graph.
Recall that the adjacency matrix of a graph G of order n with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is the
n × n zero-one matrix A = [aij] for which
aij
=
 1
if vivj ∈E(G)
0
otherwise.
Whenever aij = 1, this means that G contains the edge vivj and therefore a vi −vj path of length
1 and, of course, a vi −vj walk of length 1 as well. Not only can the adjacency matrix of G be
used to identify whether G contains a vi −vj walk of length 1, it can be used to determine whether
G contains a vi −vj walk of length k for every positive integer k and, in fact, the number of such
walks. Before stating a theorem that provides us with this information, we need to know when two
u −v walks in a graph G are considered the same.
Two u −v walks W = (u = u0, u1, . . . , uk = v) and W ′ = (u = v0, v1, . . . , vℓ= v) in a graph are
equal if k = ℓand ui = vi for all i with 0 ≤i ≤k.
Theorem 12.22 Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and adjacency matrix A.
For each positive integer k, the number of diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k in G is the (i, j)-entry
in the matrix Ak.
Proof. Let a(k)
ij
denote the (i, j)-entry in the matrix Ak for a positive integer k. Since A1 = A, it
follows that a(1)
ij
= aij. We proceed by induction. For vertices vi and vj of G, there can be only
one vi −vj walk of length 1 or no vi −vj walks of length 1 and this occurs if aij = 1 or aij = 0,
respectively. Therefore, the (i, j)-entry of the matrix A is the number of vi −vj walks of length 1
in G. Thus the basis step of the induction is established.
We now verify the inductive step. Assume, for a positive integer k, that a(k)
ij
is the number of
diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k in G. We show that the (i, j)-entry a(k+1)
ij
in Ak+1 gives the
number of diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k +1 in G. First, observe that every vi −vj walk of length
k + 1 in G is obtained from a vi −vt walk of length k for some vertex vt in G that is adjacent to vj.
Since Ak+1 = Ak · A, it follows that the (i, j)-entry a(k+1)
ij
in Ak+1 can be obtained by taking
the inner product of row i of Ak and column j of A. That is,
a(k+1)
ij
= a(k)
i1 a1j + a(k)
i2 a2j + . . . + a(k)
in anj =
n
X
t=1
a(k)
it atj.
(12.7)
By the induction hypothesis, a(k)
it
is the number of diﬀerent vi −vt walks of length k in G. If atj = 1,
then vt is adjacent to vj and so there are a(k)
it
diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k + 1 in G whose
next-to-last vertex is vt. On the other hand, if atj = 0, then vt is not adjacent to vj and there are
no vi −vj walks of length k + 1 in G whose next-to-last vertex is vt. In any case, a(k)
it · atj gives the
number of diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k + 1 in G whose next-to-last vertex is vt. Consequently,
the total number of diﬀerent vi −vj walks of length k + 1 in G is the sum in (12.7), which is a(k+1)
ij
.

12.2. CONNECTED GRAPHS
447
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, a(k)
ij is the number of diﬀerent vi−vj walks of length
k in G for every positive integer k.
Before giving an example to illustrate Theorem 12.22, let’s make some observations. Let G be a
graph of order n with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and Ak =
h
a(k)
ij
i
, where A is the adjacency matrix
of G. By Theorem 12.22, a(2)
ii
gives the number of diﬀerent vi −vi walks of length 2 in G. Since a
vi −vi walk of length 2 is (vi, vt, vi) for some vertex vt adjacent to vi, it follows that a(2)
ii
= deg vi
for every vertex vi of G. For i ̸= j, a(2)
ij
is the number of diﬀerent vi −vj paths of length 2 in G.
Again, by Theorem 12.22, a(3)
ii
gives the number of diﬀerent vi −vi walks of length 3 in G. Since a
vi −vi walk of length 3 is (vi, vs, vt, vi) for adjacent vertices vs and vt, each of which is adjacent to
vi, it follows that vi must belong to a triangle. Not only is (vi, vs, vt, vi) a vi −vi walk of length 3,
so too is (vi, vt, vs, vi) a (diﬀerent) vi −vi walk of length 3 in G. Therefore, a(3)
ii
is twice the number
of triangles in G that contain vi.
Example 12.23
For the graph G of Figure 12.23, use Theorem 12.22 to determine the number of diﬀerent vi −vj
walks of length 2 and 3 for some pairs i, j of integers with 1 ≤i, j ≤4.

22 = 2, the vertex v2 belongs
to one triangle in G. Because a(3)
23 = 4, there are four v2 −v3 walks of length 3 in G, namely:
(1) (v2, v1, v2, v3), (2) (v2, v3, v1, v3), (3) (v2, v3, v2, v3), (4) (v2, v3, v4, v3). ♦
One of the most important properties that a graph can possess is that of being connected.
Loosely speaking, a graph is connected if it consists of one piece. This highly informal description
of a connected graph may provide us with a mental picture of what a connected graph is but is of
little use when it is necessary to verify that a graph is connected.
Deﬁnition 12.24
A graph G is connected if for every two vertices u and v, G contains a u −v
path. If G contains a u −v path, then we say that u and v are connected in G. That is, G is a
connected graph if every two vertices of G are connected.

448
CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
If a graph H contains two vertices u and v for which there is no u −v path in H, then H is not
connected. In this case, we say that H is disconnected.
Example 12.25
In Figure 12.24 the graph G1 is connected, while G2 is disconnected. In G2, there is no v1 −v4 path,
for example; so v1 and v4 are not connected in G2.

The following theorem tells us that to determine whether a graph G is connected, we need only
show that G contains a u −v walk for every pair u, v of vertices of G.
Theorem 12.26 If a graph G contains a u −v walk for vertices u and v in G, then G also contains
a u −v path.
Proof. This is certainly true if u = v, so we assume that u ̸= v. Among all u −v walks in G, let W
be one of smallest length. We claim that W is a u −v path. Suppose that it is not true. Then some
vertex of G must be repeated in W. Let W = (u = u0, u1, . . . , uk = v) and suppose that ui = uj,
where 0 ≤i < j ≤k. Then
W ′ = (u = u0, u1, . . . , ui−1, ui = uj, uj+1, . . . , uk = v)
is also a u −v walk in G but one whose length is less than that of W. This is impossible.
Deﬁnition 12.27
A subgraph G′ of a graph G is a component of G if G′ is connected but G′ is
not a proper subgraph of any connected subgraph of G.
Again, loosely speaking, the components of a graph G are the connected pieces of G. A graph
has only one component if and only if it is connected. The graph G1 of Figure 12.24 has only one
component, namely G1 itself. The graph G2 of Figure 12.24 is disconnected and has two components,
namely a triangle and a path of length 2. The number of components of a graph G is denoted by
k(G). So, for the graphs G1 and G2 of Figure 12.24, k(G1) = 1 and k(G2) = 2.
Example 12.28
The graph F of Figure 12.25 has four components, namely, F1, F2, F3 and F4 and so k(F) = 4. ♦
An important observation to make about the components of a disconnected graph is the following.
If u and v are two vertices that belong to diﬀerent components of a graph G, then u and
v are not adjacent in G.
Distance in Graphs
In order for a graph G to be connected, we have seen that G must contain a u −v path for every
pair u, v of vertices of G. However, it is often the case that a connected graph G may contain several
u −v paths for two vertices u and v of G. For example, all of the following are t −y paths in the
graph H of Figure 12.26:

Deﬁnition 12.29
Let u and v be two vertices in a connected graph G. The distance d(u, v) from
u to v is the length of a shortest u −v path in G.
Therefore, d(t, y) = 3 for the vertices t and y in the graph H of Figure 12.26. By Theorem 12.22,
if G is a connected graph of order n with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and adjacency matrix A, then the
distance d(vi, vj) from vi to vj (i ̸= j) is the smallest positive integer k for which the (i, j)-entry of
the matrix Ak is nonzero.
Bipartite Graphs
The connected graph G in Figure 12.27 has the property that its vertex set can be partitioned into
two subsets U = {u1, u2, u3} and W = {w1, w2, w3, w4} in such a way that every path connecting
two vertices of U (or two vertices of W) has even length and every path connecting a vertex of U
and a vertex of W has odd length. In particular, the distance between two vertices of U (or of W) is
even and the distance between a vertex of U and a vertex of W is odd. Graphs with these properties
are of special interest.

A graph G is a bipartite graph if it is possible to partition its vertex set into
two subsets U and W, called partite sets, so that every edge of G joins a vertex of U and a vertex
of W.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Both the path P5 and the cycle C6 are bipartite, as shown in Figure 12.28. Since there is no
partition of the vertex set of C3 that satisﬁes the requirement of the deﬁnition above, C3 is not
bipartite. The graphs K4 and C5 are also not bipartite (see Exercises 23 and 24).

Figure 12.28: Bipartite graphs
The fact that none of C3, C5 and K4 is bipartite but each contains odd cycles is no coincidence.
Theorem 12.31
A nontrivial graph G is bipartite if and only if G does not contain an odd cycle.
Proof. First, assume that G is a bipartite graph and that C = (u1, u2, . . . , uk, u1) is a cycle in G.
Then there is a partition of the vertex set of G into two subsets U and W such that every edge of G
joins a vertex of U and a vertex of W. We may assume that u1 ∈U. Then u2 ∈W, u3 ∈U and so
on. Since u1 ∈U and u1uk ∈E(G), it follows that uk ∈W and that k is even. Thus C is an even
cycle.
To prove the converse, let G be a nontrivial graph having no odd cycles. We show that G is
bipartite. Since a graph is bipartite if and only if each of its components is bipartite, we may assume
that G is connected. Let u be any vertex of G, let U consist of all vertices of G whose distance from
u is even and let W consist of all vertices whose distance from u is odd. Thus {U, W} is a partition
of V (G). Since d(u, u) = 0, it follows that u ∈U. We claim that every edge of G joins a vertex of
U and a vertex of W.
Assume, to the contrary, that there exist two adjacent vertices in U or two adjacent vertices in
W. Since these two situations are similar, we will assume that there are vertices v and w in W such
that vw ∈E(G). Since d(u, v) and d(u, w) are both odd, d(u, v) = 2s + 1 and d(u, w) = 2t + 1
for nonnegative integers s and t. Let P ′ = (u = v0, v1, . . . , v2s+1 = v) be a u −v path of length
d(u, v) and let P ′′ = (u = w0, w1, . . . , w2t+1 = w) be a u −w path of length d(u, w) in G. Certainly,
P ′ and P ′′ have their initial vertex u in common but they may have other vertices in common as
well. Among the vertices P ′ and P ′′ have in common, let x be the last vertex. Perhaps x = u. In
any case, x = vi for some integer i ≥0. Thus d(u, vi) = i. Since x is on P ′′ and wi is the only
vertex of P ′′ whose distance from u is i, it follows that x = wi. So x = vi = wi. However then,
C = (vi, vi+1, . . . , v2s+1, w2t+1, w2t, . . . , wi = vi) is a cycle of length
[(2s + 1) −i] + [(2t + 1) −i] + 1 = 2s + 2t −2i + 3 = 2(s + t −i + 1) + 1
and so C is an odd cycle, which is a contradiction.
The proof of Theorem 12.31 above shows that if G is a connected bipartite graph with partite
sets U and W, then every x −y path in G where x, y ∈U or x, y ∈W is even and every x −y path
in G where x ∈U and y ∈W (or x ∈W and y ∈U) is odd, as we noted earlier.
A graph G is called a complete bipartite graph if it is possible to partition V (G) into two
subsets U and W, again called partite sets, such that two vertices of G are adjacent if and only if
they belong to diﬀerent partite sets. If |U| = s and |W| = t, then this graph is denoted by Ks,t or
Kt,s. If either s = 1 or t = 1, then this graph is called a star. The vertex in the star K1,t (t ≥2)
having degree t is called the center of the star. Some examples of complete bipartite graphs are

shown in Figure 12.28. The graphs K1,2 and K1,3 are therefore stars (where u is the center in each
case). Observe that K1,2 = P3 and K2,2 = C4.
Bipartite graphs belong to a more general class of graphs. A graph G is a k-partite graph if
V (G) can be partitioned into k subsets V1, V2, . . . , Vk (once again called partite sets) such that
uv is an edge of G if u and v belong to diﬀerent partite sets. If, in addition, every two vertices in
diﬀerent partite sets are joined by an edge, then G is a complete k-partite graph. If |Vi| = ni
for 1 ≤i ≤k, then we denote this complete k-partite graph by Kn1,n2,...,nk. The complete k-partite
graphs are also referred to as complete multipartite graphs. If ni = 1 for every i (1 ≤i ≤k),
then Kn1,n2,...,nk is the complete graph Kk. Complete 2-partite graphs are thus complete bipartite
graphs. Several complete multipartite graphs are shown in Figure 12.30.

Theorem 12.32
If G is a disconnected graph, then G is connected.
Proof. Let G be a disconnected graph. Then G contains two or more components. To verify that
G is connected, we show that for every two vertices u and v of G, there is a u −v path in G. We
now consider two cases, according to whether u and v belong to diﬀerent components of G or to the
same component of G.
Case 1. u and v belong to diﬀerent components of G. Then u and v are not adjacent in G and
so u and v are adjacent in G. Then (u, v) is a u −v path of length 1 in G.
Case 2. u and v belong to the same component of G. Let w be a vertex of G that belongs to a
component diﬀerent from the one containing u and v. Therefore, w is not adjacent to either u or v

452
CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
in G, which implies that w is adjacent to both u and v in G. Consequently, (u, w, v) is a u −v path
of length 2 in G.
In either case, G contains a u −v path and so G is connected.
The complete graph Kn of order n is certainly connected. In fact, if u and v are any two vertices
of Kn, then u and v are adjacent and so (u, v) is a path of length 1. Since each vertex of Kn has
degree n −1, we can conclude that if the degrees of the vertices of a graph G are large enough in
terms of its order, then G must be connected. But how large is “large enough”? Figure 12.32 shows
two disconnected graphs F and H. The order of F is 6 and the degree of every vertex of F is 2;
while the order of H is 7 and the degree of every vertex of H is 2 or 3. Therefore, for graphs of
order 6 or 7, knowing that the degree of every vertex is 2 or more is not suﬃcient to guarantee that
the graphs must be connected. If we knew that the degrees of their vertices were just a bit larger,
however, then we could reach a diﬀerent conclusion.

Theorem 12.33
If G is a graph of order n such that
deg v ≥n −1
2
for every vertex v of G, then G is connected.
Proof. Let G be a graph of order n such that deg v ≥(n −1)/2 for every vertex v of G. To verify
that G is connected, we show that there is a path between every two vertices of G. Let x and y be
two vertices of G. We show that G contains an x−y path. Of course, if x is adjacent to y, then xy is
an edge of G and G contains the x −y path (x, y). So we can assume that x and y are not adjacent.
Since deg x ≥(n −1)/2 and deg y ≥(n −1)/2, each of x and y has at least (n −1)/2 neighbors.
Furthermore, neither x nor y is a neighbor of the other. If there is no vertex of G that is a neighbor
of both x and y, then N(x) ∪{x} and N(y) ∪{y} are disjoint sets, each of which has cardinality at
least (n + 1)/2. This implies that the order of G is at least n + 1; however, this is impossible since
G has only n vertices. Therefore, there must be a vertex z that is a neighbor of both x and y. This
says that (x, z, y) is an x −y path in G. Hence x and y are connected and so G is connected.
There is a special kind of edge and vertex in a graph whose deletion from the graph results in an
increased number of components. For an edge e of G, the subgraph G−e is the spanning subgraph of
G whose edge set consists of all edges of G except e. For a vertex v of a nontrivial graph G = (V, E),
the subgraph G −v has vertex set V −{v} and consists of all edges of G except those incident with
v. While G −e is not an induced subgraph of G, the subgraph G −v is necessarily an induced
subgraph of G; in fact, G −v = G[V −{v}]. For a nonempty subset X of E and a nonempty subset
U of V , the graphs G −X and G −U are similarly deﬁned.
Deﬁnition 12.34
An edge e in a graph G is called a bridge of G if G −e has more components
than G. A vertex v in a nontrivial graph G is a cut-vertex of G if G −v has more components
than G.
In particular, for a connected graph G, an edge e of G is a bridge of G if G −e is disconnected;
while a vertex v of G is a cut-vertex of G if G −v is disconnected.

Example 12.35
The vertex r in the graph G of Figure 12.33 is a cut-vertex of G, as are the vertices t and u in G.
The graph G has three bridges, namely pr, qr and tu. The graph G −r has three components and
the graph G −tu has two components, as shown in Figure 12.33.

Figure 12.33: Bridges and cut-vertices in a connected graph in Example 12.35
In fact, if e = uv is a bridge in a connected graph G, then G −e always has exactly two
components, one component containing u and the other containing v. The following two theorems
provide characterizations of bridges and cut-vertices in a graph. (See Exercises 32 and 35.)
Theorem 12.36
An edge e of a graph G is a bridge of G if and only if e lies on no cycle of G.
Theorem 12.37
A vertex v of a connected graph G is a cut-vertex of G if and only if there exist
vertices u and w distinct from v such that v lies on every u −w path of G.

edges, no two of which are encountered the same number of times in W.
2. Show that if a graph G contains a u −v path and a v −w path, then G contains a u −w path.

Eulerian Graphs
While it is unclear just how and when many areas of mathematics began, such is not the case with
graph theory. It is generally accepted that graph theory was born in 1736. The story starts before
then, however, in the city of K¨onigsberg, which was located in Prussia during that period and is
now the city of Kaliningrad in Russia. K¨onigsberg (see Figure 12.41) was divided into four land
regions (denoted by A, B, C and D) by the River Pregel. There were seven bridges that crossed the
river at various locations allowing people to walk between the land regions. Evidently, the citizens
of K¨onigsberg would often take strolls about the city. A question arose that intrigued many people
in K¨onigsberg: Is it possible to take a stroll about K¨onigsberg and cross each of its seven bridges
exactly once? This problem became known as the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem. It is perhaps
surprising that this question was not answered more quickly but eventually this problem came to
the attention of the the great Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who solved the problem in a
very mathematical manner.

Leonhard Euler (1707–1783), considered by many as the outstanding mathematician of the 18th
century, was known to have an amazing memory. His list of publications (nearly 900 in all) is still
exceeded by very few mathematicians. It is especially remarkable that many of his accomplishments
occurred during the last few years of his life, while he was totally blind.
Let’s see how Euler solved the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem.
If there was a stroll through
K¨onigsberg that crossed each bridge exactly once, then such a stroll could be represented by a
sequence
x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8
(12.8)
where each term of the sequence is one of the letters A, B, C and D, indicating the land region to
which the stroll had progressed. Since there are seven bridges, (12.8) is a sequence of eight letters.
Let’s consider land region B for example. Each occurrence of B in the sequence (12.8) indicates
that land region B had been entered or exited at that point of the stroll. Since each occurrence of
B accounts for at most two bridges (one to enter B and one to exit B) and there are three bridges
that enter (and exit) B, the symbol B must occur twice in the sequence. Similarly, C and D must
occur twice each as well. By the same reasoning, A must occur three times. Therefore, A, B, C
and D must occur 9 times in the sequence, which is impossible. This says that no stroll through
K¨onigsberg that crosses each bridge exactly once is possible.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
The K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem can be described as a problem involving graphs (actually multi-
graphs). Let G be the multigraph whose vertices are A, B, C and D and where two vertices are
joined by a number of edges equal to the number of bridges joining the corresponding land regions.
The multigraph so constructed is shown in Figure 12.42.

Figure 12.42: The K¨onigsberg multigraph
The K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem can now be stated as a graph theory problem: Does the multi-
graph G of Figure 12.42 have a trail containing every edge of G? Of course, we know from Euler’s
work that the answer to this question is no. However, this question suggested a considerably more
general problem to Euler. Euler’s 1736 paper, in which he solved the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem,
was written in Latin. In an English translation of this paper, Euler wrote:
. . . I have formulated the general problem: whatever be the arrangement and division of
the river into branches and however many bridges there be, can one ﬁnd out whether or
not it is possible to cross each bridge exactly once?
For the purpose of presenting this more general problem, we introduce some new terminology.
Deﬁnition 12.38 Let G be a connected graph or connected multigraph. An open trail that contains
every edge of G is called an Eulerian trail, while a circuit that contains every edge of G is an
Eulerian circuit. A graph or multigraph containing an Eulerian circuit is itself called Eulerian.
Example 12.39
The graph G1 of Figure 12.43 is an Eulerian graph since it contains Eulerian circuits. One Eulerian
circuit in G1 is
C = (s1, t1, v1, x1, y1, z1, x1, w1, u1, v1, w1, t1, u1, s1).
The multigraph G2 of Figure 12.43 contains Eulerian trails. Since G2 contains parallel edges, it
is useful (indeed essential) to label some of the edges so that an Eulerian trail can be accurately
described. One Eulerian trail in G2 is
T = (w2, y2, e3, z2, e4, y2, e5, z2, x2, e1, w2, e2, x2). ♦

Figure 12.43: An Eulerian graph and a multigraph with an Eulerian trail
With the aid of this terminology, we know that the multigraph of Figure 12.42 contains neither
an Eulerian circuit nor an Eulerian trail. Of course, Euler did not use this terminology. But the
K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem led Euler to ask (in current terminology):

12.3. EULERIAN GRAPHS
459
Which connected graphs and multigraphs contain an Eulerian circuit or an Eulerian
trail?
The degree of a vertex v in a multigraph G is the number of edges in G incident with v. Thus
the degree of the vertex A in the K¨onigsberg multigraph in Figure 12.42 is 5, while all other vertices
have degree 3. Perhaps you have noticed that all four vertices of the K¨onigsberg multigraph of
Figure 12.42 have odd degree. Is this information relevant for determining which connected graphs
or multigraphs contain neither an Eulerian circuit nor an Eulerian trail? It turns out that this
information is not only relevant, it is critical. We begin with an important observation.
Theorem 12.40
If G is an Eulerian graph, then every vertex of G is even.
Proof. Let G be an Eulerian graph. Then G contains an Eulerian circuit C = (x0, x1, . . . , xm = x0).
If v is a vertex of G that is not the initial vertex of C (and therefore not the terminal vertex of C
either), then each time v is encountered on C, it is both entered and exited and therefore contributes
2 to the degree of v. Consequently, v is even. If v is the initial (and terminal) vertex of C, then
C contributes 1 to the degree of v both as the initial vertex and the terminal vertex of C and
contributes 2 to the degree of v for all other occurrences of v on C. Thus v is even here as well.
Perhaps surprisingly, the converse of Theorem 12.40 is true as well.
Theorem 12.41
Let G be a nontrivial connected graph. If every vertex of G is even, then G is
Eulerian.
Proof. Let G be a nontrivial connected graph in which every vertex of G is even. We show by
means of an algorithm that G contains an Eulerian circuit.
Let u be a vertex of G. We begin a trail T with initial vertex u. Follow u by any vertex u1
adjacent to u. Next, select any vertex u2 adjacent to u1 such that u1u2 does not already appear on
T . We continue this procedure until arriving at a vertex v, where every edge incident with v already
belongs to T . Since v is even, it follows that v = u, that is, T is a u−u circuit, which we now denote
by C. If C contains every edge of G, then C is an Eulerian circuit and the proof is complete.
Suppose that C is not an Eulerian circuit of G. Then there are edges of G that do not belong
to C. Since G is connected, there is some vertex v1 on C that is incident with edges not on C. If
we delete the edges of C from G, then every vertex of the resulting graph G1 is even. In particular,
every vertex in the component G′
1 in G1 containing v1 is even. As before, there is a circuit C′ in G′
1
with initial vertex v1. By inserting C′ at v1 in C, we obtain a circuit C′′ of greater length than that
of C. If C′′ contains all edges of G1, then C′′ is an Eulerian circuit of G; otherwise, C′′ contains a
vertex v2 that is incident with edges not on C′′. We then continue this process as before until an
Eulerian circuit of G is produced.
The proof that Euler gave of Theorem 12.41 was incomplete and it wasn’t until 1871 when the
ﬁrst satisfactory proof of this theorem (due to Carl Hierholzer) was published. Theorems 12.40 and
12.41 provide us with the following theorem of Euler.
Theorem 12.42
Let G be a nontrivial connected graph. Then G is Eulerian if and only if every
vertex of G is even.
With the aid of Theorem 12.42, the following theorem can be established, telling us which
connected graphs have Eulerian trails. (See Exercise 3.)
Theorem 12.43
Let G be a connected graph. Then G has an Eulerian trail if and only if G has
exactly two odd vertices. Furthermore, any Eulerian trail of G begins at one of the odd vertices and
ends at the other.
There are theorems for multigraphs whose statements and proofs are similar to Theorems 12.42
and 12.43.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Theorem 12.44
Let G be a connected multigraph with one or more edges. Then
(1) G is Eulerian if and only if every vertex of G is even and
(2) G has an Eulerian trail if and only if G has exactly two odd vertices.
Example 12.45
Figure 12.44 shows a downtown district of a town with nine street intersections, denoted by I1, I2,
. . ., I9. Is it possible for a mail carrier to deliver mail along the streets of this district and drive
along each street exactly once?

vertices I3 and I7, such a mail delivery is possible if the mail route starts at either I3 or I7 and ends
at the other.

There is a related question whose answer may be clear. Suppose that G is a nontrivial graph (or
multigraph). If the vertices of G have been drawn on a piece of paper, then under what circumstances
can the edges of G be drawn in one continuous motion? The answer: G must have an Eulerian circuit
or an Eulerian trail.
Example 12.46
Determine which graphs in Figure 12.46 contain an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian trail or neither.
Solution. Since G1 and G6 are connected graphs containing only even vertices, it follows by Theo-
rem 12.42 that they are Eulerian and therefore contain Eulerian circuits. Since G2, G3, G5 and G8
are connected graphs containing exactly two odd vertices, they contain Eulerian trails (beginning
at one odd vertex and ending at the other). Since G4 and G7 contain more than two odd vertices,
neither graph contains an Eulerian circuit or an Eulerian trail. Since G9 is disconnected, G9 contains
neither an Eulerian circuit nor an Eulerian trail even though every vertex of G9 is even.

Figure 12.46: Graphs in Example 12.46
There are several operations on graphs that allow us to construct a new graph from two given
graphs and permit us to give examples of graphs having some speciﬁed properties.
Deﬁnition 12.47 The union G ∪H of two graphs G and H with disjoint vertex sets is that graph
whose vertex set is V (G) ∪V (H) and whose edge set is E(G) ∪E(H).
The union G ∪H of two graphs G and H is always a disconnected graph; in fact, the number of
components of G ∪H is k(G ∪H) = k(G) + k(H).
Deﬁnition 12.48 The join G + H of two graphs G and H with disjoint vertex sets is that graph
constructed from G and H by adding all edges joining the vertices of G and the vertices of H.
The join of two two graphs, connected or not, is always a connected graph. Several examples of
the joins of two graphs are shown in Figure 12.47. For an integer n ≥3, the wheel Wn is the graph
Cn +K1. Thus the graph C5 +K1 of Figure 12.47 is the wheel W5. For positive integers s and t, the
graph Ks + Kt is (isomorphic to) the complete bipartite graph Ks,t. Therefore, the graph K2 + K3
of Figure 12.47 is K2,3.

Figure 12.47: Joins of graphs
Example 12.49 Let F and H be two connected non-Eulerian regular graphs and let G = (F ∪H)+
K1, that is, G is obtained from F and H by adding a new vertex v and joining v to each vertex in
F and H. Prove that G is Eulerian.
Proof. Suppose that F is an r1-regular graph of order n1 and H is an r2-regular graph of order n2.
Then r1 and r2 are both odd and so n1 and n2 are both even. In the graph G, degG x = r1 + 1 if
x ∈V (F), degG x = r2 + 1 if x ∈V (H) and degG v = n1 + n2. Thus each vertex of G is even. Since
G is connected, G is Eulerian.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Deﬁnition 12.50
The Cartesian product G × H of two graphs G and H (sometimes written as
G □H) is that graph having vertex set V (G × H) = V (G) × V (H), that is, every vertex of G × H
is an ordered pair (u, v), where u ∈V (G) and v ∈V (H), such that two distinct vertices (u, v) and
(x, y) are adjacent in G × H if
either (1) u = x and vy ∈E(H) or (2) v = y and ux ∈E(G).
An important class of graphs deﬁned in terms of Cartesian products are the n-cubes (or hy-
percubes). The 1-cube Q1 is deﬁned as K2. The 2-cube Q2 is the graph K2 × K2 = C4. The
graph C4 × K2 is the 3-cube Q3. The n-cubes can then be deﬁned recursively by Qn = Qn−1 × K2
for n ≥2. The n-cubes can also be described somewhat diﬀerently. For a positive integer n, the
n-cube Qn is that graph whose vertex set is the set of n-bit strings and such that two vertices are
adjacent if their n-bit strings diﬀer in exactly one coordinate. Using this deﬁnition, the n-cubes for
n = 1, 2, 3 are shown in Figure 12.48. Thus Qn is an n-regular graph of order 2n.

Example 12.51
Find a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the Cartesian product G × H of two
nontrivial connected graphs G and H to be Eulerian.
Solution. We can think of G × H as being constructed by replacing each vertex v of G by a copy
Hv of H. Let x be a vertex of G×H. Then x belongs to Hv for some vertex v of G. The vertex x is
adjacent to its neighbors in Hv as well as to one vertex in Hu for every neighbor u of v in G. Thus
degG×H x = degHv x + degG v.
Hence degG×H x is even if and only if degHv x and degG v are both even or both odd (that is, they
are of the same parity).
If degHv x is even, then degG v is even for every vertex v of G; while if degHv x is odd, then
degG v is odd for every vertex v of G. Therefore, G × H is Eulerian if and only if both G and H are
Eulerian or every vertex of G and H is odd.

Exercises for Section 12.3
1. In the argument that Euler gave to solve the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem (see Figure 12.41),
he indicated that any stroll could be represented as a sequence such as x1, x3, x3, x4, x5, x6,
x7, x8 (see (12.8)), where each term is one of A, B, C, D, indicating the land region to which
the stroll had progressed. Observe, for example, that at least one of B, C and D, say B, is
neither x1 nor x8. Thus each occurrence of B in the sequence must be xi where 2 ≤i ≤7.

For more than a century following Euler’s solution of the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem, there was
only minor progress in the development of the new ﬁeld of graph theory. However, in the 1850s
three events occurred that would have a major inﬂuence on graph theory. We will discuss one of
these now and the remaining two in the next two chapters.
Born in Dublin, Ireland in 1805, William Rowan Hamilton was a child prodigy with a gift for
languages and mathematics. Although he had mastered many languages before he was a teenager, his
main interests would become mathematics and physics. Today Hamilton is recognized as a leading
mathematician and physicist of the 19th century. It was Hamilton’s work in physics, however, that
led to him being knighted in 1835 and thus becoming Sir William Rowan Hamilton.
While Hamilton developed a great deal of mathematics, one of his ﬁnal major ideas led to a
subject he referred to as icosian calculus. In August 1856, Hamilton attended a meeting of the
British Association and stayed at the home of his friend John Graves, who had an extensive library.
It was during this time that Graves posed some puzzles to Hamilton. Whether it was Graves or
the books Hamilton was reading at Graves’ home, Hamilton began thinking about a connection
between his new icosian calculus and traveling along the edges of a dodecahedron, visiting every
vertex exactly once and returning to the starting point. A dodecahedron is a geometric solid with
20 vertices, 30 edges and 12 faces (see Figure 12.52). As it turned out, Hamilton’s icosian calculus
could be illustrated by a game with a game board containing the “graph of the dodecahedron” and
holes at the vertices where numbered pegs could be placed to help keep track of a cycle that traveled
about every vertex of the dodecahedron.

Graves put Hamilton in contact with John Jacques, a London toymaker, to whom Hamilton sold
the rights for this game. Two versions of the game were manufactured, one for the parlor, played on
a ﬂat board and another for the “traveler,” played on an actual dodecahedron. Hamilton called his
game the Icosian Game (see Figure 12.53). The 20 vertices of the dodecahedron were labeled with
the 20 consonants of the English alphabet.

The idea was thus to construct a round trip where each of the 20 cities is visited on the trip
exactly once. Hamilton was also involved in marketing the game. Hamilton even wrote the preface
to the instruction pamphlet, which began as follows:
In this new Game (invented by
Sir WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON, LL.D., & c., of Dublin,
and by him named Icosian from a Greek word signifying ‘twenty’) a player is to place
the whole or part of a set of twenty numbered pieces or men upon the points or in the
holes of a board, represented by the diagram above drawn, in such a manner as always to
proceed along the lines of the ﬁgure and also to fulﬁll certain other conditions, which may
in various ways be assigned by another player. Ingenuity and skill may thus be exercised
in proposing as well as in resolving problems of the game. For example, the ﬁrst of the
two players may place the ﬁrst ﬁve pieces in any ﬁve consecutive holes and then require
the second player to place the remaining ﬁfteen men consecutively in such a manner that
the succession may be cyclical, that is, so that No. 20 may be adjacent to No. 1; and it
is always possible to answer any question of this kind.

12.4. HAMILTONIAN GRAPHS

This game eventually led to a new concept in graph theory.
Deﬁnition 12.52
A cycle in a graph G that contains every vertex of G is called a Hamiltonian
cycle of G and a graph containing a Hamiltonian cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph.
Example 12.53
The graph of the dodecahedron is Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian cycle of this graph is shown (with
solid edges) in Figure 12.54. This also provides a solution to the puzzle A Voyage Round the World. ♦

A simple but useful observation concerning Hamiltonian graphs is the following:
Let H be a spanning subgraph of a graph G. If H is Hamiltonian, then so is G.
Example 12.54
The cycle Cn (n ≥3) is a Hamiltonian graph. In fact, Cn is itself a Hamiltonian cycle. Consequently,
for n ≥3, the complete graph Kn is Hamiltonian.

Example 12.55
All of the graphs in Figure 12.55 are Hamiltonian (with a Hamiltonian cycle indicated with solid
edges in each graph).

Figure 12.55: Hamiltonian graphs
Unlike the situation for Eulerian graphs, where there is a theorem (Theorem 12.42) that provides
us with necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a graph G to be Eulerian (G is nontrivial, connected
and every vertex is even), there is no such theorem for Hamiltonian graphs. That is, there is no
known useful conditions that a graph G must satisfy to guarantee that G is Hamiltonian and such
that if G does not satisfy these conditions then G is not Hamiltonian. In fact, the situation is
even worse than this. Many mathematicians believe that no such conditions will ever be found. So
we are faced with a rather unpleasant situation. It seems that to show a graph G is Hamiltonian,
we must ﬁnd a Hamiltonian cycle in G.
And to show that G is not Hamiltonian – then what
must we do? Surely, being unable to ﬁnd a Hamiltonian cycle in G does not mean that G is not

468
CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Hamiltonian. After all, maybe G has a Hamiltonian cycle but we simply can’t ﬁnd one. Fortunately,
the situation is not quite as bleak as this. Only connected graphs can be Hamiltonian. That is, if
G is a disconnected graph, then G is deﬁnitely not Hamiltonian. Furthermore, if G is connected
but G contains a cut-vertex, then G cannot be Hamiltonian. There is, in fact, a property that all
Hamiltonian graphs must possess. (Recall that k(H) denotes the number of components in a graph
H.)
Theorem 12.56
If G is a Hamiltonian graph, then
k(G −S) ≤|S|
for every nonempty proper subset S of V (G).
Proof. Let G be a Hamiltonian graph and let S be a nonempty proper subset of V (G). Of course,
if G −S is connected, then k(G −S) = 1 and k(G −S) ≤|S|. So we may assume that G −S
is disconnected.
Let G1, G2, . . . , Gk, where k = k(G −S) ≥2, be the components of G −S.
Necessarily, no vertex of Gi is adjacent to a vertex of Gj (i ̸= j). Since G is Hamiltonian, G contains
a Hamiltonian cycle C. We may assume that the initial (and terminal) vertex of C is v, where v
belongs to G1. For 1 ≤i ≤k, let vi be the last vertex of C that belongs to Gi and let xi be the
vertex that immediately follows vi on C. Thus xi ∈S. Therefore, |S| ≥k = k(G −S).
Theorem 12.56 is a necessary condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian, that is, every Hamiltonian
graph satisﬁes this condition. Since necessary conditions are most useful in their contrapositive
formulation, we also state a theorem that is equivalent to Theorem 12.56 and which provides a
suﬃcient condition for a graph to be non-Hamiltonian.
Theorem 12.57
If there exists a nonempty proper subset S of the vertex set of a graph G such
that
k(G −S) > |S|,
then G is not Hamiltonian.
For example, this says, as we noted earlier, that no graph with a cut-vertex is Hamiltonian.
Example 12.58
The graph G = K2,3 of Figure 12.56 is not Hamiltonian. Letting S = {u, v}, we see that k(G−S) =
3 > 2 = |S|. By Theorem 12.57 then, G is not Hamiltonian.

There are also some suﬃcient conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian. That is, if a graph G
satisﬁes one of these conditions, then G must be Hamiltonian. However, these conditions are strictly
suﬃcient, that is, a graph G can be Hamiltonian without satisfying any of these. We look at one of
the simplest and yet most useful of these conditions.
As we noted earlier, for n ≥3, the complete graph Kn is Hamiltonian. Consequently, if every
vertex of a graph G of order n ≥3 has degree n −1, then G is Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian graph
of order n ≥3 must be connected. By Theorem 12.33, if every vertex of a graph G of order n ≥3
has degree at least (n −1)/2, then G must be connected. However, G need not be Hamiltonian. For

Figure 12.57: A non-Hamiltonian graph G of order n with δ(G) = (n −1)/2
example, every vertex of the graph G of order n = 7 in Figure 12.57 has degree at least (n−1)/2 = 3
but G is not Hamiltonian.
This leads us to ask if every vertex in a graph G of order n ≥3 has degree at least n/2, whether
G must be Hamiltonian. This, in fact, turns out to be true and is an observation that was ﬁrst made
by the Danish mathematician Gabriel Andrew Dirac (the stepson of Paul Dirac, who was awarded
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1933).
Theorem 12.59
If G be a graph of order n ≥3 such that
deg v ≥n
2
for each vertex v of G, then G is Hamiltonian.
Proof.
Suppose that the theorem is false. Then there must exist some integer n ≥3 and some
graph G of order n such that deg v ≥n/2 for each vertex v of G but yet G is not Hamiltonian.
Among all such graphs G, let H be one with a maximum number of edges. Surely, H ̸= Kn since
Kn is Hamiltonian. Therefore, H contains some pairs of nonadjacent vertices. Let u and w be
two nonadjacent vertices in H. Because H is a graph of largest size with this property that is not
Hamiltonian, H +uw must be Hamiltonian and therefore contains Hamiltonian cycles. In fact, every
Hamiltonian cycle of H + uw must contain the edge uw.
Let C be a Hamiltonian cycle of H + uw. If we remove the edge uw from C, then we obtain a
u −w path
P = (u = u1, u2, . . . , un = w)
that contains every vertex of H. Observe that if P contains a vertex ui (2 ≤i ≤n) such that uui
and ui−1w are both edges of H (of course, this is impossible for i = 2 and i = n), then
C′ = (u = u1, ui, ui+1, . . . , un = w, ui−1, ui−2, . . . , u1 = u)
is a Hamiltonian cycle in H, which cannot occur (see Figure 12.58). What this says is that for every
vertex ui adjacent to u, the vertex ui−1 cannot be adjacent to w. Since the degree of w is at most
n −1 in any case, it follows that
deg w ≤n −1 −deg u ≤n −1 −n
2 = n
2 −1.
This, however, is impossible since deg w ≥n/2.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Solution. The graph G + H has order n = 12 + 20 = 32. Every vertex of G has degree 3 + 20 = 23
in G + H, while every vertex of H has degree 4 + 12 = 16 in G + H. Since every vertex of G + H
has degree at least n/2, it follows by Theorem 12.59 that G + H is Hamiltonian.

Weighted Graphs
We have already mentioned that a network of highways connecting cities can be modeled by a
graph (or perhaps a multigraph). Graphs can also be used to represent a collection of airline routes
connecting pairs of the cities. What may interest us in both situations, however, is not the distance
between the cities in the resulting graphs but, instead, the minimum driving distance or the minimum
driving time or perhaps the minimum cost of ﬂights between cities. What this says is that the edges
in each such graph cannot be interpreted the same. In particular, with each edge in such a graph,
there is associated a number (perhaps a distance or cost) called the weight of the edge.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Example 12.61
A weighted graph is a graph G in which every edge e of G is assigned a real
number weight (usually a positive number), which is denoted by w(e) and called the weight of the
edge e.
Figure 12.61 shows two weighted graphs G and H.

Figure 12.61: Two weighted graphs
Recall that the distance d(u, v) between two vertices u and v in a connected graph G is the
length of a shortest u −v path in G. For example, in the graph G of Figure 12.62, d(u, v) = 6. The
manner in which G is drawn suggests that G might model a street system in which u and v are
street intersections. Considering distance in this manner, we see that the shortest drive between u
and v involves traveling 6 blocks. Indeed, there are many routes from u to v that involve driving 6
blocks. Equivalently, there are many u −v paths of length 6 in the graph G.

Figure 12.62: Distance between two vertices
In a particular situation, the problem that we have just described is probably too simplistic.
Suppose that the blocks shown in Figure 12.62 are in a major metropolitan city. One would not
expect all blocks to be equal. Typically, some blocks are longer than others and, depending on
the time of day we are driving, the amount of time it takes to travel the length of a particular
block can vary. If vertex u indicates the location of an emergency medical service and v indicates an
intersection where a person is in need of help, then it is essential that a medical unit dispatched from
u travel along a route to v that is likely to take the least amount of time. Indeed, it is conceivable
that the route from u to v that takes the least time involves driving more than 6 blocks. In order
to solve this problem and others like it, we consider distance in weighted graphs.
Deﬁnition 12.62
Let u and v be two vertices in a weighted graph G. The length of a u −v path
P in G is the sum of the weights of the edges of P. Then the distance d(u, v) between u and v is
the minimum length of a u −v path in G.
Let’s consider an example of this.
Example 12.63
A connected weighted graph G is shown in Figure 12.63. The graph G contains a number of u −v
paths. The u −v path of minimum length, however, is
P = (u, r, s, p, q, t, w, y, v).

12.5. WEIGHTED GRAPHS

Since the length of this path is 120, it follows that d(u, v) = 120.

Dijkstra’s Algorithm
The best known algorithm for determining the distance between a speciﬁc vertex r in a connected
weighted graph G and the other vertices of G is one due to Edsger Wybe Dijkstra (1930–2002), a
pioneer in the science and industry of computing. He believed that mathematical logic is and must
be the basis for the construction of sensible computer science programs. He was well known for his
love of writing, both professionally and through correspondence with his many friends. Despite his
computer background, he greatly preferred writing longhand to using e-mail.
Dijkstra’s algorithm is one of the most important algorithms in all of discrete mathematics. Be-
fore formally stating this algorithm, let us illustrate how this algorithm works for a particular vertex
in a particular weighted graph, namely for the vertex r in the weighted graph G of Figure 12.64.
Example 12.64
Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to ﬁnd the distances from the vertex r to the other vertices in the connected
weighted graph G of Figure 12.64.

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Solution. We begin by assigning a label L(v) to each vertex v of G. The vertex r is assigned the
label L(r) = 0, while L(v) = ∞is assigned to all vertices v distinct from r. (Rather than letting
L(v) = ∞, we could let L(v) = k(n −1), for example, where k is the largest weight of any edge in
G and n is the order of G.) Since we know that d(r, r) = 0, we initially deﬁne a set S by letting
S = {r}, which denotes the set of vertices to which the distance from r is now known. As we proceed
through Dijkstra’s algorithm, each vertex v distinct from r will eventually be assigned an ordered
pair (a, b), possibly more than once, where a is the current value of L(v) and b is a vertex adjacent
to v that lies on a current r −v path under consideration.
We begin with the vertices adjacent to r.
Since s is adjacent to r and w(rs) = 18, we let
L(s) = 18 and assign s the ordered pair (18, r). This indicates that the length of the path (r, s)
is 18. Similarly, t is assigned the ordered pair (14, r) and u is is assigned the ordered pair (17, r).
Presently, the labels of the remaining vertices are not changed. Since 14 is the smallest number
among the numbers 18, 14, 17, we claim that d(r, t) = 14. The path (r, t) is a shortest r −t path,
for otherwise any other r −t path would have to begin with either rs or ru, each of which has
weight exceeding 14. The ﬁnal ordered pair assigned to t is then (14, r). We now update S so that
S = {r, t}. Thus, we have now found shortest paths from r to the vertices of S and the lengths of
these paths.
Next, we look at the vertices adjacent to t that do not belong to S. Since q is adjacent to
t and w(qt) = 16, we let L(q) = w(qt) + L(t) = 16 + 14 = 30. This indicates that there is an
r −q path of length 30, namely (r, t, q).
Similarly, L(y) = w(yt) + L(t) = 39 + 14 = 53 and
L(z) = w(zt) + L(t) = 22 + 14 = 36. However, w(tu) = 5 and w(tu) + L(t) = 5 + 14 = 19. This says
that there is an r −u path of length 19, namely (r, t, u). Since L(u) = 17 < 19, we are already aware
of an r −u path of smaller length, namely (r, u). Consequently, we do not change the value of L(u)
and so we still have L(u) = 17. Since 17 is the minimum of 18, 17, 30, 53, 36, it follows that there is
no r −u path whose length is less than 17 and so d(r, u) = 17. Thus u is assigned the ordered pair
(17, r). What this says is that (r, u) is a shortest r −u path in G. We then add u to S and so S is
now {r, t, u}. Continuing in this manner, we obtain the table in Figure 12.65 below which gives the
distances from r to the other vertices of G and provides the information that gives a shortest path.

For example, the last entry in the column headed by x is (43, q). This says that d(r, x) = 43 and
that in some shortest r −x path, the vertex adjacent to x is q. However, in some shortest r −q
path, the vertex adjacent to q is s. A shortest r −s path is (r, s). Thus a shortest r −x path is
(r, s, q, x).

CHAPTER 12. INTRODUCTION TO GRAPHS
Solution. Initially, v1 is assigned the label L(v1) = 0 and all other vertices of G are assigned the
label ∞. The set S is initially deﬁned to be {v1} and u is deﬁned to be v1. Step 5 is a while loop
which is executed as long as V (G) −S ̸= ∅. There is a for loop at Step 6. For each vertex vi /∈S
(2 ≤i ≤n) that is adjacent to u, the new label w(uvi)+L(u) will be assigned to vi if this is less than
its previous label and each such vertex is assigned an ordered pair P(vi) = (L(vi), u). (Certainly,
this is the case whenever L(vi) = ∞is the current label.)
After completing the while loop at Step 7 and necessarily Step 8 as well, we have
L(v2) = 6, L(v5) = 18, L(v6) = 16, L(v7) = 11 and L(v9) = 12.
Since u = v1, we now have
P(v2) = (6, v1), P(v5) = (18, v1), P(v6) = (16, v1), P(v7) = (11, v1), P(v9) = (12, v1).
The minimum value a of the labels of the vertices not in S is then computed in Step 9, where it
is determined that a = 6. Proceeding through the for loop in Step 10, we see that the ﬁrst vertex
attaining the value a = 6 is v2, which is added to S (that is, S = {v1, v2} now) and becomes the
vertex u in Step 12. In the same step, the number a is then reduced to a −1 = 5 (which means that
only one vertex will have the initial value a = 6).
Since V (G)−S ̸= ∅, the while loop at Step 5 is repeated. We run through the for loop at Step 6,
each time considering those vertices vi ∈V (G) −S that are adjacent to u = v2. There are two
such vertices, namely v3 and v5. Since w(uv3) + L(u) = 10, which is less than ∞, it follows that
L(v3) is redeﬁned as 10 and P(v3) = (10, v2). However, since w(uv5) + L(u) = 20 > 18, it follows
that L(v5) remains at 18 and P(v5) remains at (18, v1). The minimum value a of the labels of the
vertices not in S is computed in Step 9 and we ﬁnd that a = 10. We run through the for loop in
Step 10 and see that the ﬁrst (actually only) vertex whose label is 10 is v3. In Step 12, the vertex
v3 is now added to S and so currently S = {v1, v2, v3}. Also, in Step 12, u is changed to v3 and a is
changed to a −1 = 10 −1 = 9. No vertex in V (G) −S has the label 9, which completes all steps in
the while loop at Step 5 and since V (G) −S ̸= ∅, we repeat it beginning with Step 6. The table in
Figure 12.67 gives all labels L(vi) and ordered pairs P(vi) for 2 ≤i ≤n. When we reach S = V (G),
we now turn to the for loop in Step 13 and all ordered pairs P(vi) for 2 ≤i ≤n are output.
Below the table, the distances d(v1, vi) are given for 2 ≤i ≤9 as well as the shortest v1 −vi
path determined by the entries in the table.

The Traveling Salesman Problem
There is another problem concerning connected weighted graphs, which, although similar to that
of ﬁnding distances between pairs of vertices, is extraordinarily more diﬃcult.
The Traveling Salesman Problem: A salesman wishes to make a round trip that visits a certain
number of cities. He knows the distance between all pairs (or at least many pairs) of cities or perhaps
knows instead the cost of traveling between certain pairs of cities. If he is to visit each city exactly
once, then what is the minimum distance (or minimum cost) of such a round trip?
This problem can be modeled quite naturally by a weighted graph G whose vertex set is the
set of cities and where two vertices u and v are joined by an edge having weight r if the distance
between u and v (or the cost of traveling between u and v) is known and this distance (cost) is r.
To solve this Traveling Salesman Problem, we need to determine the weight of a Hamiltonian cycle
in G of minimum weight. Certainly, G must contain a Hamiltonian cycle for this problem to have a
solution. However, if G is complete (that is, if we know the distance or the cost of traveling between
every pair of cities), then there are many Hamiltonian cycles in G if its order n is large. Since every
city must lie on every Hamiltonian cycle of G, we can think of a Hamiltonian cycle starting (and
ending) with a city c. Then the remaining n −1 cities can follow c on the cycle in any of (n −1)!
orders. Indeed, if we have one of the (n −1)! orderings of the n −1 cities, then we need to add the
distances (costs) between consecutive cities in the sequence as well as the distances between c and
the ﬁrst city in the sequence and the last city in the sequence and c. We then need to compute the
minimum of these (n−1)! numbers. Actually, we need only ﬁnd the minimum of (n−1)!/2 numbers
since we would get the same sum if a sequence was traversed in reverse order.
Solving the problem in this manner has factorial time complexity and is certainly not eﬃcient.
On the other hand, there is no known eﬃcient algorithm to solve the general problem.

Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for the complete weighted graph G in Figure 12.68.

11 + 10 + 13 + 6 + 12 = 52
s8 = (c1, c3, c2, c5, c4, c1)
11 + 10 + 14 + 6 + 9 = 50
s9 = (c1, c3, c4, c2, c5, c1)
11 + 8 + 13 + 14 + 12 = 58
s10 = (c1, c3, c5, c2, c4, c1)
11 + 4 + 14 + 13 + 9 = 51
s11 = (c1, c4, c2, c3, c5, c1)
9 + 13 + 10 + 4 + 12 = 48
s12 = (c1, c4, c3, c2, c5, c1)
9 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 12 = 53
We see therefore that the minimum weight of a Hamiltonian cycle is 36. To obtain this weight,
the vertices of G should be visited in the order listed in the sequence s2, that is, c1, c2, c3, c5,
c4, c1.
♦
The importance of the Traveling Salesman Problem is due to a number of related but useful
applications, including, but deﬁnitely not restricted to, the following:
(1) Each morning a school bus leaves school to pick up students at a number of bus stops. It
would be useful to know a route that would use the least time (to get the students to school
quickly and to minimize the cost of gasoline for the bus).
(2) Late afternoon each day, a van leaves a restaurant to deliver “meals on wheels” to customers
who prefer to have meals delivered to them.
(3) Each day a mail truck leaves the post oﬃce to pick up mail that has been left in mailboxes.
Indeed, there are numerous applications that have nothing to do with “traveling” but involve per-
forming activities in some cyclic sequence that is least costly or most time eﬃcient.
The Traveling Salesman Problem belongs to a class of problems called combinatorial optimization
problems, where some quantity is being minimized or maximized. A number of these problems,
including the Traveling Salesman Problem, are known to be NP-complete problems. At present, no
eﬃcient algorithm has even been found that solves any of these problems. However, if an eﬃcient
algorithm is ever found to solve any one of them, then an eﬃcient algorithm must exist to solve every
one of them. Despite this, there have been instances when a Traveling Salesman Problem has been
solved for a large number of cities. For example, in 1998 David Applegate, Robert Bixby, Vasek
Chv´atal and William Cook solved a Traveling Salesman Problem for the 13,509 largest cities in the
United States (those whose population exceeded 500 at that time). They also solved a Traveling
Salesman Problem for 15,113 German cities in 2001 and for 24,978 Swedish cities in 2004. The
ultimate goal is to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem for every registered city or town in the
world plus a few research bases in Antartica (1,904,711 locations in all). Applegate, Bixby, Chv´atal
and Cook wrote a 2007 book titled The Traveling Salesman Problem: A Computational Study, in
which they describe the history of the Traveling Salesman Problem as well as the method they used
to solve a range of large-scale problems.

7. A businessman in New York City learns that he will need to visit four branch oﬃces (in Miami,
Houston, Minneapolis and Los Angeles) of his company for one week each next year. When
he checks into the costs of constructing trips between these cities, he learns that it is less
expensive to purchase a round trip ticket between any two cities than to purchase a one-way
ticket in either direction. The costs of theses trips are given below
NYC-MIA: 232
MIA-MIN: 279
NYC-HOU: 333
MIA-LOS: 322
NYC-MIN: 325

(These were the actual prices at one time.)
(a) In what order should he visit the cities and then return to New York City to minimize
the cost?
(b) Later, it’s determined that it will not be necessary for him to visit Minneapolis. How will
this aﬀect this trip and the cost?

with the 3 possible round trips in (b)?

of the colors red, blue and green such that for each color, there exists at least one vertex of G
assigned that color.

Ask and answer such a
question.
31. It is known that if G is a graph of order n ≥2, then it is impossible for all of the degrees of
G to be distinct. However, it is possible for a connected graph Gn of order n ≥3 to contain
two distinct vertices u and v such that deg u = deg v and such that the degree of every other
vertex is diﬀerent from that of all other n −1 vertices. (In fact, there is only one such graph
Gn for n ≥3.)

Trees
The graphs known as trees constitute one of the simplest yet most important classes of graphs. Trees
appeared implicitly in the 1847 work of the German physicist Gustav Kirchhoﬀ(1824–1887) in his
study of currents in electrical networks, while Arthur Cayley (1821–1895) used trees in 1857 to count
certain types of chemical compounds. Trees are important to the understanding of the structure of
graphs and are used to systematically visit the vertices of a graph. Trees are also widely used in
computer science as a means to organize and utilize data. This entire chapter will be devoted to a
study of this single class of graphs.
13.1
Fundamental Properties of Trees
In a region of an underdeveloped country are eight settlements, denoted by s1, s2, . . ., s8 (see
Figure 13.1). In addition to rebuilding the settlements, several friendly countries have oﬀered to
construct paved roads between certain pairs of settlements so that it is possible to travel by way of
paved roads between any two of the eight settlements. Because of the eﬀort and expense needed to
construct these roads, the plan is to build as few roads as possible to accomplish the stated goal.
One way to do this is shown in Figure 13.1.

Figure 13.1: Connecting eight settlements by paved roads
Interpreting the settlements as vertices, we wish to construct a connected graph of order 8 that
has as few edges as possible. Necessarily, this graph G can have no cycles, for if G has a cycle C,
then for each edge e of C, the graph G−e is connected but has fewer edges than G. Thus any graph
with the desired properties is connected and contains no cycles. This is the class of graphs in which
we are interested.
Deﬁnition 13.1
A tree is a connected graph having no cycles.

Thus the graph constructed in Figure 13.1 is a tree. It is easy to give examples of trees. All
three graphs in Figure 13.2 are trees.

As expected, there are relatively few diﬀerent (non-isomorphic) trees of small orders. There is
only one tree of each of the orders 1, 2 and 3, there are two trees of order 4 and three trees of order
5. All eight of these trees are shown in Figure 13.3.

Figure 13.3: Trees of order 5 or less
Sometimes we are interested in graphs without cycles and not in whether they are connected.
Deﬁnition 13.2
A graph containing no cycles is called a forest.
Consequently, a connected forest is a tree. While every tree is a forest, the converse is not true.
The graph F of Figure 13.4 is a forest with six components. Each component of the forest F is
therefore a tree.

Every graph contains subgraphs that are trees. In most instances, a graph contains many sub-
graphs that are trees. If the given graph is connected, then the subgraphs that are trees in which
we will be most interested are spanning trees.
Deﬁnition 13.3
A spanning tree T of a connected graph G is a spanning subgraph of G that is
a tree, that is, V (T ) = V (G).
If G is itself a tree, then G has only one spanning tree, namely itself.
Example 13.4
For the connected graph G of Figure 13.5, all of the trees T1, T2, T3, T4 are spanning trees of G. ♦
We now look at some properties possessed by all nontrivial trees. Since every tree is connected,
no nontrivial tree can contain an isolated vertex. However, every nontrivial tree must contain some

end-vertices. Especially when working with trees, it is common to refer to a vertex of degree 1 as
a leaf. We now show that every tree with at least two vertices contains at least two leaves. In the
proof, it is once again useful to consider a longest path.
Theorem 13.5
Every nontrivial tree contains at least two leaves.
Proof. Let P = (v1, v2, . . . , vk), k ≥2, be a longest path in a tree T . We claim that deg v1 =
deg vk = 1. Since v1 is adjacent to v2, certainly deg v1 ≥1. The vertex v1 cannot be adjacent
to a vertex v0 that is not on P, for otherwise, (v0, v1, v2, . . . , vk) is a path whose length is greater
than that of P. Also, v1 cannot be adjacent to a vertex vt on P with 3 ≤t ≤k; for otherwise,
(v1, v2, . . . , vt, v1) is a cycle in T , which is impossible since T has no cycles.
Thus, as claimed,
deg v1 = 1. By a similar argument, deg vk = 1.
Let T be a nontrivial tree. By Theorem 13.5, T contains two or more leaves. Let v be one of
them. Then T −v is also a tree (see Exercise 8). This simple observation has useful consequences in
certain induction proofs involving trees, which is illustrated in the proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 13.6
Every tree of order n has size n −1.
Proof. The proof is by induction on the order n. Suppose ﬁrst that n = 1. There is only one tree
of order 1, namely the trivial tree K1. Since the size of K1 is 0 = 1 −1, the result is true for n = 1.
This veriﬁes the basis step. We next verify the inductive step. Assume that every tree of order k,
where k ≥1, has k −1 edges and let T be a tree of order k + 1. Since T is nontrivial, T contains a
leaf v. Then T −v is a tree of order k. By the induction hypothesis, T −v has k −1 edges. Since
T −v has one less edge than T , it follows that T has k = (k + 1) −1 edges, as desired.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, every tree of order n has size n −1.
By Theorem 13.6, if T is a tree of order n and size m, then m = n −1. Another way to state
this is:
If T is a connected graph of order n and size m containing no cycles, then m = n −1.
In fact, if G is a graph of order n and size n −1 containing no cycles, then G must be a tree.
Theorem 13.7
Every graph of order n and size n −1 containing no cycles is a tree.
Proof. Let G be a graph of order n and size m containing no cycles such that m = n −1. We
show that G is a tree. Since G has no cycles, it remains only to show that G is connected. Let the
components of G be G1, G2, . . . , Gk, where k ≥1. Our goal is to show that k = 1. Suppose that Gi
has order ni and size mi (1 ≤i ≤k). Thus
m =
k

mi
and
n =

Since each component Gi is a tree, it follows by Theorem 13.6 that mi = ni −1 for each integer i
(1 ≤i ≤k). Therefore,

−k = n −k.
This says that k = 1 and so G is connected. Therefore, G is a tree.
From the proof of Theorem 13.7, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 13.8
If F is a forest of order n and size m having k components, then
m = n −k.
Furthermore, if G is a connected graph of order n and size m for which m = n −1, then G too
is a tree.
Theorem 13.9
Every connected graph of order n and size n −1 is a tree.
Proof. Let G be a connected graph of order n and size m = n −1. We show that G is a tree. Since
G is connected, it remains only to show that G contains no cycles. Assume, to the contrary, that
G contains cycles. If e1 is an edge of G that lies on a cycle of G, then G1 = G −e1 is connected.
If G1 contains no cycles, then G1 is a tree. Otherwise, G1 contains cycles. In such a case, let e2
be an edge of G1 that lies on a cycle of G1. Then G2 = G1 −e2 is connected. We continue this
until the edges e1, e2 . . . , ek (k ≥1) are removed, arriving at a connected graph Gk containing no
cycles. Then Gk is a tree of order n and size m −k ≤m −1 = n −2. This, however, contradicts
Theorem 13.6.
The following result is a consequence of Theorems 13.7 and 13.9 and the deﬁnition of a tree.
Theorem 13.10 If G is a graph of order n and size m satisfying any two of the following three
properties, then G is a tree:
(1) G is connected,
(2) G has no cycles,
(3) m = n −1.
There is also another property that only trees possess.
Theorem 13.11 A graph G is a tree if and only if G has a unique u−v path for every two vertices
u and v in G.
Proof. Let G be a tree and let u and v be two vertices of G. Since G is connected, G contains a
u −v path. If G contains two u −v paths, then G contains a cycle, which is impossible since G is a
tree. Thus G contains a unique u −v path.
For the converse, suppose that G is a graph containing a unique u−v path for every two vertices
u and v of G. We claim that G is a tree. Certainly G is connected. Assume, to the contrary, that G
contains a cycle C. Let x and y be two vertices on C. Then C and therefore G contains two x −y
paths, which is a contradiction. So, as claimed, G is a tree.
Degrees of the Vertices of a Tree
We have mentioned that every nontrivial tree contains at least two leaves. A tree may contain
exactly two leaves or exactly three leaves, as the trees T1 and T2 of Figure 13.6 show. The tree T1
has exactly two leaves and no vertices of degree 3, while the tree T2 has exactly three leaves and one
vertex of degree 3. Each of the trees T3 and T4 of Figure 13.6 contains exactly four leaves. While
the tree T3 has two vertices of degree 3 and no vertices of degree more than 3, the tree T4 has no

Figure 13.6: Some trees with a small number of leaves
vertices of degree 3 but does contain one vertex of degree 4. There is a formula for the number of
leaves in a tree T in terms of the number of vertices of degree 3 or more that T contains.
Let T be a tree of order n ≥2 and size m having maximum degree ∆(T ) = k. Suppose that T
has ni vertices of degree i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. The number n1 is therefore the number of leaves in T .
Then

and
k

ini
=
1 · n1 + 2n2 + · · · + knk = 2m = 2(n −1) = 2n −2.
Since the second sum adds the degrees of vertices of T , the result is twice the number of edges of T .
With the aid of these two sums, we can now develop a formula for the number of leaves in a tree.
Theorem 13.12 Let T be a tree of order n ≥2 with maximum degree k having ni vertices of degree
i for i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Then the number of leaves in T is
n1 = 2 + n3 + 2n4 + 3n5 + · · · + (k −2)nk.
Proof. Since
k

−2,
it follows that
n1 + 2n2 + 3n3 + · · · + knk = 2n1 + 2n2 + 2n3 + · · · + 2nk −2
and so
n1 = 2 + n3 + 2n4 + 3n5 + · · · + (k −2)nk,
as desired.
According to Theorem 13.12, if a tree T has exactly one vertex of degree 3 but no vertex of
higher degree, then T has 2 + 1 = 3 leaves. If T has exactly two vertices of degree 3 but none of any
higher degree, then T has 2 + 1 · 2 = 4 leaves. If T has exactly one vertex of degree 4 but no other
vertex of degree 3 or more, then T has 2 + 2 · 1 = 4 leaves.
Example 13.13
A certain tree T has ﬁve vertices of degree 2, six vertices of degree 3, two vertices of degree 4, four
vertices of degree 5 and no vertices of degree 6 or more. How many leaves does T possess?
Solution. According to Theorem 13.12, the number of vertices of degree 2 has no eﬀect on the
number of leaves. However, the remaining information tells us that the number of leaves in T is
n1 = 2 + n3 + 2n4 + 3n5 = 2 + 6 + 2 · 2 + 3 · 4 = 24.

Figure 13.7: A tree with ﬁve vertices of degree 2, six vertices of degree 3,
two vertices of degree 4 and four vertices of degree 5
One such tree is given in Figure 13.7.
♦
The solution of Example 13.13 shows that if G is any tree containing exactly ﬁve vertices of
degree 2, six vertices of degree 3, two vertices of degree 4, four vertices of degree 5 and no vertices
of degree 6 or more, then G must have 24 leaves. However, suppose, instead of computing n, we
simply draw a tree satisfying the conditions of the tree T speciﬁed in Example 13.13 (such as the
tree in Figure 13.7) and then count the number of leaves of the tree we just drew. Of course, we
would get 24. However, this is not a satisfactory solution of the problem, for how do we know that
the number of leaves in the tree T described in Example 13.13 is the same as the number of leaves
in the tree we drew? Certainly, these trees need not to be isomorphic. We don’t know that these
trees have the same number of leaves until we’ve shown it.

Rooted and Spanning Trees
Many of the applications of trees concern the designation of a particular vertex r in a tree T and
the distance from r to each vertex of T .
Deﬁnition 13.14
A tree T is called a rooted tree if T contains a designated vertex r (called the
root of T ). The tree T is then said to be rooted at r.
The tree T0 in Figure 13.8(a) is a rooted tree as it is rooted at the vertex r. It is common to draw
a rooted tree with the root at the top (and placed at what is referred to as level 0). The neighbors
of r are placed at the same level below r (at level 1). Any vertex at distance 2 from r is placed one
level below that (at level 2). Continuing in this manner, we say that a vertex s of T is at level i
the distance from r to s is i. Drawing a rooted tree in this manner is illustrated with the tree T0 of
Figure 13.8(a), which is drawn again in Figure 13.8(b).

Figure 13.8: A rooted tree
The height of a rooted tree T with root r is the largest integer h for which there is a vertex v of
T at level h. The height h of a tree T rooted at r is then the maximum distance from r to another
vertex of T . The rooted tree T0 of Figure 13.8 has height 4.
Rooted trees can be used to represent a variety of situations. One of these describes the hierar-
chical administrative structure that exists within a college or university.
Example 13.15
A possible portion of the administrative structure in a certain university is shown in Figure 13.9. In
this case, the root is the president of the university.
♦
Another common application of a rooted tree is its use as a family tree to show the descendants
of some individual. Inspired by familiar terms in family trees, this terminology is often applied to
all rooted trees. Let T be a tree rooted at the vertex r and let v be a vertex of T . Any vertex in T
adjacent to v but belonging to the level one step below that of v is called a child of v. Any vertex
w (̸= v) for which the r −w path in T contains v is called a descendant of v. Any vertex u (̸= v)
for which the r −v path in T contains u is called an ancestor of v. The ancestor of v belonging to
the level one step above v is the parent of v.

Figure 13.10: A rooted tree: a family tree in Example 13.16
Another familiar application of rooted trees concerns searching for a particular name in a list
of names arranged alphabetically or perhaps searching for a particular number in a list of numbers
given in increasing order. Actually, one approach to accomplish this is to use the Binary Search
Algorithm (Algorithm 6.32). This gives rise to a rooted tree, called a binary search tree. A binary
tree is a rooted tree in which every vertex has at most two children and in which each child is
assigned a special designation, namely as a left child or a right child. If v is a vertex of a binary
tree T with left child u and right child w, then the subtree of T induced by u and its descendants is
the left subtree of v, while the subtree of T induced by w and its descendants is the right subtree
of v. The rooted tree shown in Figure 13.11 is a binary tree rooted at r. The vertex u is the left
child of r, while w is the right child of r. The vertex z is the left child of t but t has no right child.
No leaves have any children. The right subtree T ′ of r (rooted at w) is also shown in Figure 13.11.
Binary Search Trees
For a list of names arranged alphabetically, a binary search tree T is a binary tree whose vertex
set is the set of names on the list such that for every vertex v of T the vertices in the left subtree of
v precede v alphabetically and those vertices in the right subtree of v follow v alphabetically. When

using the Binary Search Algorithm to search for a name, a speciﬁc binary search tree is constructed.
Namely, we select a name on the list that is in the middle of the list (or the ﬁrst of two middle
names alphabetically if there is no unique middle name). The left child of the root is the middle
name of the sublist of names preceding the root alphabetically and the right child of the root is the
middle name of the sublist of names following the root alphabetically. Continuing in this manner
produces the binary search tree T that corresponds to the Binary Search Algorithm.
Example 13.17
Construct the binary search tree resulting from the following list of 15 names (arranged alphabeti-
cally):
Aaron, Abel, Allen, Benson, Bloom, Boston, Carter, Curry,
Daniels, Fletcher, Harper, Lumens, Parsons, Thomas, Waters.
Indicate in this binary search tree, how the name Harper is found using a binary search.
Solution. The binary search tree constructed from the given list of 15 names is shown in Fig-
ure 13.12. Searching for the name Harper results in the path (Curry, Lumens, Fletcher, Harper). ♦

Decision Trees
We have seen illustrations of how rooted trees can be used to model a number of situations and,
in the case of binary trees, can be used to conduct a search for a word in a alphabetized list of
words (or for a number in a list of numbers arranged in increasing order). We now describe another
problem, solutions of which can be found through a sequence of comparisons. Finding the solutions
can be considered as an application of rooted trees, where each vertex of the tree corresponds to a

13.2. ROOTED AND SPANNING TREES
501
decision that directs us to a subtree and eventually leads to a possible solution of the problem at a
leaf of the tree. For this reason, such rooted trees are often called decision trees.
Suppose that we have a collection of n ≥2 coins, exactly one of which is counterfeit and weighs
(slightly) less than each of the n −1 authentic coins. We have at our disposal a balance scale (see
Figure 13.13). By placing coins on each of the two scale pans A and B, one can determine if the pans
are balanced and so the coins on the two pans weigh the same, or if the pans are unbalanced and
whether it is the coins on A or the coins on B that are heavier (or lighter). The problem of interest
to us is to determine a sequence of weighings that results in an identiﬁcation of the counterfeit coin.
Moreover, we desire to accomplish this with a minimum number of weighings. We consider this
question for n = 4.

Figure 13.13: A balance scale
Example 13.18
Suppose that we have a collection of four coins numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, exactly one of which is counterfeit
and weighs less than each of the three authentic coins. What is the minimum number k of weighings
needed to be certain that we have identiﬁed the counterfeit coin? Describe how this problem can be
solved by a sequence of k weighings.
Solution. It is probably obvious that there is no way to guarantee in a single weighing that we can
discover the counterfeit coin. It is possible to be lucky, of course, where we place coin 1, say, on
scale pan A and coin 2 on scale pan B. We indicate this by writing {1}, {2}. If the contents of scale
pan A (namely coin 1) is lighter than the contents of scale pan B (which can be easily observed since
A is higher than B), then coin 1 is the counterfeit coin. Of course, if the scale pans balance, then
we know that neither coin 1 nor coin 2 is counterfeit. To determine which of coin 3 and coin 4 is
counterfeit, another weighing is required.
There is more than one way to proceed to solve this problem. Two possible approaches are
described by means of the two decision trees in Figure 13.14. In the decision tree in Figure 13.14(b),
for example, coins 1 and 2 are placed on scale pan A, while coins 3 and 4 are placed on scale pan B.
There is no possibility that these pans will balance. If the contents of scale pan A (namely coins 1
and 2) is lighter, then the counterfeit coin is on pan A. In this case, we conduct a second weighing,
placing coin 1 on pan A and coin 2 on pan B. Whichever scale has the lighter contents identiﬁes the
the counterfeit coin. Otherwise, the contents of scale pan B is lighter and we proceed in a similar
fashion to determine whether it is coin 3 or coin 4 that is counterfeit.
♦
One question that might occur to you is the following. If, somehow, we knew that exactly one
of four coins is counterfeit, then it would probably not be surprising to learn that the weight of this
counterfeit coin is diﬀerent from each of the three authentic coins. However, how likely is it that
we would know beforehand how the weight of the counterfeit coin compares with the other three?
Perhaps it is heavier. Perhaps it has a diﬀerent weight than the three authentic coins but we don’t
know if the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier.

Suppose that we have a collection of four coins numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, exactly one of which is counterfeit

of weighings needed to be certain that have identiﬁed the counterfeit coin?
Solution. In Example 13.18, where we knew that the counterfeit coin is lighter than each of the three
authentic coins, we saw that the minimum number of weighings needed to identify the counterfeit
coin is 2. In the current situation, we have less information, however. Consequently, the number of
weighings needed to solve this problem must be at least 2. But what is this minimum? The decision
tree in Figure 13.15 shows us how we might proceed.

Figure 13.15: Identifying a counterfeit coin whose weight
is diﬀerent from three other coins in Example 13.19
According to the decision tree in Figure 13.15, we begin by placing coin 1 on scale pan A and
coin 2 on scale pan B. Either the scale pans balance or they don’t. If pan A and pan B do not

13.2. ROOTED AND SPANNING TREES
503
balance, then we know that either coin 1 or coin 2 is counterfeit and that both coin 3 and coin 4 are
authentic. Next, we place coin 1 on scale pan A and (the authentic) coin 3 on scale pan B. If the
pans do not balance, then coin 1 is counterfeit; while if they balance, then coin 2 is counterfeit. On
the other hand, if pan A and pan B initially balance, then we have learned that coin 1 and coin 2
are authentic. We again place coin 1 on scale pan A and coin 3 on scale pan B. If the pans do not
balance, then coin 3 is counterfeit; while if the pans balance, then coin 4 is counterfeit.
Therefore, even without knowing whether the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier than the au-
thentic coins, still only two weighings are required to discover which of the four coins is counterfeit. ♦
We now consider a larger number of coins, where we again assume that it is known that the
counterfeit coin is lighter than each of the authentic coins.
Example 13.20
Suppose that we have a collection of nine coins numbered 1, 2, . . ., 9, exactly one of which is
counterfeit and weighs less than each of the eight authentic coins. What is the minimum number of
weighings needed to be certain that we have identiﬁed the counterfeit coin? Describe a procedure
for locating the counterfeit coin using this minimum number of weighings.
Solution. Perhaps surprisingly, the minimum number of weighings needed to solve this problem is 2
in this case as well. How the counterfeit coin can be discovered in two weighings is shown in the
decision tree in Figure 13.16.

Notice that whenever we reach a leaf in a decision tree, we have reached a conclusion. In the
decision tree in Figure 13.16, for example, there are nine leaves, each corresponding to the one of
nine coins that turned out to be counterfeit. More generally, if we are seeking a counterfeit coin
among n coins, then any decision tree used to identify which of the n coins is the fake coin must
have at least n leaves. (Perhaps there is more than one sequence of comparisons that would show
that a certain coin is counterfeit.)
A famous problem in this connection is the following.
The 12 Coins Problem: You are given 12 coins, one of which is counterfeit and weighs more or
less than the 11 authentic coins. Show that in three weighings it can be determined which of the 12
coins is counterfeit and whether the counterfeit coin is heavier or lighter than each authentic coin.
(See Exercise 10.)
Constructing Spanning Trees
We have already mentioned that every connected graph contains a spanning tree, perhaps several
spanning trees. Let G be a connected graph of order n and size m. A spanning tree T of G can

504
CHAPTER 13. TREES
be constructed in a number of ways. Let’s look at one such way. If G itself is a tree, then G is a
spanning tree of itself. If G is not a tree, then G contains a cycle C. If e is an edge of C, then the
graph G −e is connected. If G −e contains no cycles, then G −e is a spanning tree of G. If G −e
contains a cycle C′ and e′ is an edge of C′, then we consider G −{e, e′} and proceed as above, until
we arrive at a spanning tree T of G. Since T is a spanning tree of G, it follows that T has order n
and size n −1. Consequently, it is necessary to remove m −(n −1) = m −n + 1 edges from G to
produce T , although, as we have mentioned, each deleted edge must belong to a cycle in the graph
currently being considered.
Let’s look at another way to construct a spanning tree T of a connected graph G of order n.
Suppose that V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. Of course, V (T ) = V (G). It remains to determine the edge
set of T . Select any two edges e1 and e2 of G. These are the ﬁrst two edges of E(T ). Now select
an edge e3 of G not already selected and which does not produce a cycle with the edges already in
E(T ) and place this edge in E(T ). Continuing in this manner produces a spanning tree of G.
We now illustrate these methods of constructing a spanning tree in a connected graph.
Example 13.21
Find a spanning tree in the connected graph G of Figure 13.17 by
(a) deleting appropriate edges from G and
(b) beginning with V (G) and adding appropriate edges.

property. We delete uw, producing G1 (see Figure 13.18(b)). Then we delete an edge of G1
belonging to the unique cycle of G1, say we delete the edge uy. This produces the spanning
tree T1 of G shown in Figure 13.18(c).

Figure 13.19: Constructing a spanning tree by adding edges in Example 13.21(b)
Since no disconnected graph can contain a spanning connected subgraph, we have the following
observation.
Theorem 13.22
A graph G contains a spanning tree if and only if G is connected.
In 1847 Gustav Kirchhoﬀshowed that the problem of ﬁnding a spanning tree in a connected
graph G is related to the problem of resistance between the nodes of an electrical circuit.
Depth-First Search Trees
We now look at two well-known spanning trees of a connected graph G that are rooted trees. The
ﬁrst of these is called a depth-ﬁrst search tree formed by conducting what is called a depth-ﬁrst
search in G. In a depth-ﬁrst search, we begin at some vertex v (the root of the depth-ﬁrst search
tree). The idea is to systematically visit all vertices of G by proceeding deeply into G with a path
P having v as its initial vertex. If P should contain all vertices of G, then P is a spanning tree
and is a depth-ﬁrst search tree. If P does not contain all vertices of G, then we backtrack along P
until we reach a vertex v′ that is adjacent to a vertex not on P and construct a new path P ′ with
initial vertex v′ that proceeds as deeply into G as possible. When P ′ terminates and if the tree T ′
constructed thus far contains all vertices of G, then this is a depth-ﬁrst search tree. Otherwise, we
backtrack along P ′ and possibly along P as well until a new vertex v′′ in T ′ is found that is adjacent
to a vertex not on T ′ and then proceed as before.
Before formally stating an algorithm for conducting a depth-ﬁrst search in a connected graph
G, we give an example.
In order to indicate how a depth-ﬁrst search tree can be constructed
systematically, we assume that G is a connected graph with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and that the
adjacency lists of these vertices are given, whose subscripts are in increasing order. The resulting
depth-ﬁrst search tree T of G is rooted at v1.

Figure 13.20: The graph G in Example 13.23
Solution. To construct a depth-ﬁrst search tree T in this case, we begin at v1. Since v3 is the ﬁrst
vertex on the adjacency list of v1, we start with the path (v1, v3). The ﬁrst vertex on the adjacency
list of v3 not already used is v2; so now we have the path (v1, v3, v2). Continuing in this manner
gives us the path
P = (v1, v3, v2, v8, v7, v12, v5).
The two vertices on the adjacency list of v5 (namely v3 and v12) already appear on P, however.
Hence we backtrack along P to v12. Since the three vertices on the adjacency list of v12 are on P,
we backtrack along P again to v7. The two vertices on the adjacency list of v7 are already on P. We
backtrack along P one step further, this time placing us at v8. However, there is a vertex (namely
v10) on the adjacency list of v8 that does not belong to P.
Hence we now start a new path P ′ with (v8, v10). Since the ﬁrst vertex v4 on the adjacency list
of v10 has not been used, we extend P ′ so that it begins with (v8, v10, v4). The ﬁrst vertex on the
adjacency list of v4 that has not been used is v6 and so P ′ is extended again to obtain
P ′ = (v8, v10, v4, v6).
The two vertices on the adjacency list of v6 have been used. Thus P ′ terminates and the tree T ′ is
produced. Since T ′ is not a spanning tree of G, we backtrack along P ′ to v4. The ﬁrst vertex on
the adjacency list of v4 that has not been used is v9 and so a new path P ′′ is begun with (v4, v9).
Since v11 is the ﬁnal vertex of G and is on the adjacency list of v9, the depth-ﬁrst search tree T is
completed by adding v11 to P ′′ and obtaining
P ′′ = (v4, v9, v11).
(See Figure 13.21).

CHAPTER 13. TREES
Breadth-First Search Trees
Another common spanning tree of a connected graph G with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . ., vn} that is
also a rooted tree is a breadth-ﬁrst search tree. As in a depth-ﬁrst search, we systematically
visit all vertices here as well, but the vertices are visited in a completely diﬀerent manner. We begin
with a vertex v (the root of this tree) but rather than start with a path having initial vertex v, we
start with the star T1 having center v and containing all vertices adjacent to v. If T1 should contain
all vertices of G, then T1 is a breadth-ﬁrst search tree of G. If T1 does not contain all vertices of G,
then we go to the neighbor of v having the smallest subscript, say v′. If there are any neighbors of
v′ not in T1, then we add a new star to T1 at v′ containing the remaining neighbors of v′. We then
move to the neighbor v′′ of v having the second smallest subscript. We continue this until either the
tree constructed is a spanning tree of G or until we have run through all neighbors of v, in which
case we start over again with the neighbors of v′ and then the neighbors of v′′ and so on. The
resulting spanning tree is the breadth-ﬁrst search tree of G. Thus, rather than conducting a search
that proceeds deeply into G, as with a depth-ﬁrst search, a breadth-ﬁrst search of G conducts
a broad search of G. While a depth-ﬁrst search is more vertical in nature, a breadth-ﬁrst search is
more horizontal.
Before presenting a formal algorithm for conducting a breadth-ﬁrst search in a connected graph,
we illustrate this method with the graph G of Figure 13.21, also shown in Figure 13.22.

Figure 13.22: Constructing a breadth-ﬁrst search tree T
for the graph G in Example 13.25
Example 13.25
Construct a breadth-ﬁrst search tree T rooted at v1 for the graph G of Figure 13.22. The adjacency
lists of these vertices of G are given below:
v1 : v3, v4, v8, v9, v11
v2 : v3, v8, v12
v3 : v1, v2, v5, v11
v4 : v1, v6, v9, v10
v5 : v3, v12
v6 : v4, v10
v7 : v8, v12
v8 : v1, v2, v7, v10
v9 : v1, v4, v11
v10 : v4, v6, v8
v11 : v1, v3, v9
v12 : v2, v5, v7.
Solution. To construct a breadth-ﬁrst search tree T in this case, we begin at v1 and select the star
T1 having all edges incident with v1. The neighbor of v1 in T1 with the smallest subscript is v3.

13.2. ROOTED AND SPANNING TREES
509
There are two vertices adjacent to v3 (namely v2 and v5) not in T1, so the vertices v2 and v5 and
the edges v3v2 and v3v5 are added to the breadth-ﬁrst search tree being constructed. We move to
v4. There are two vertices adjacent to v4 (namely v6 and v10) that do not belong to the tree already
constructed, so the vertices v6 and v10 and the edges v4v6 and v4v10 are added to form a new tree.
(Since the tree is not a spanning tree of G, we continue.) There is one vertex adjacent to v8 (namely
v7) that is not in this tree, so v7 and v7v8 are added to this tree. There are no such neighbors of v9
and v11. Therefore, we now consider the vertex in level 2 with the smallest subscript and which is
adjacent to v3. This is v2. The vertex v2 is adjacent to the vertex v12, which is not in the current
tree; so the vertex v12 and the edge v2v12 are added to this tree. Since all vertices of G have now
been encountered, this is a breadth-ﬁrst search tree T of G (see Figure 13.22).

For each labeling of the vertices of a connected graph G of order n by v1, v2, . . . , vn, there is
a unique depth-ﬁrst search tree and a unique breadth-ﬁrst search tree when using the Depth-First
Search Algorithm and Breadth-First Search Algorithm, respectively. Since the vertices of G can
ordinarily be labeled in many ways, there are often many possible depth-ﬁrst search trees and many
possible breadth-ﬁrst search trees of G.

The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem
In the example discussed in Figure 13.1, there are eight settlements s1, s2, . . . , s8. We mentioned
that paved roads are to be constructed between some pairs of these settlements so that it is possible

512
CHAPTER 13. TREES
to travel between any two of these settlements on paved roads and that Figure 13.1 shows one way
to do this. Since the idea is to construct paved roads as cheaply as possible, we noted that the
resulting graph must be a tree. In an actual situation, however, we would know (or at least have
an estimate of) the cost of constructing a paved road between each pair of settlements. If we were
to construct paved roads between every pair of settlements, the possible road system might look
something like that shown in Figure 13.26.

One possible way to choose the paved roads to construct is to begin with the least expensive,
which would be the road between s7 and s8, costing $200,000. The next least expensive is the one
between s3 and s4 (which would cost $210,000). The next least expensive road would be the road
between s5 and s7 costing $235,000. The next least expensive road would cost $240,000. There are
two such roads, one between s2 and s5 and the other between s5 and s8. Since the road between s5
and s8 creates a cycle, we do not choose this one. We do select the road between s2 and s5, however.
The next least expensive road is between s4 and s6, which is estimated to cost $245,000. Since
no cycle is created, we choose this road. Proceeding in this manner, we conclude by selecting the
roads between s1 and s2 and between s2 and s3, which cost $255,000 and $265,000, respectively (see
Figure 13.27). Thus the total estimated cost of constructing all these roads would be $1,650,000. Of
course, the crucial question here is the following: Is there some way of selecting roads to construct
that would be less expensive? The answer is no. In fact, the method we used to choose the roads
to pave cannot be improved upon.
The problem we have been describing is actually a special case of a well-known problem. Let G
be a connected weighted graph. So each edge of G has a weight (or cost), which is a positive real
number. The weight of an edge e of G is denoted by w(e). The weight w(H) of a subgraph H of
G is the sum of the weights of the edges of H, that is,
w(H) =
X
e∈E(H)
w(e).
Deﬁnition 13.27
A minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph G is a spanning
tree of G whose weight is minimum among all spanning trees of G.

The major problem in this context is the following.
The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem Find a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted
graph.
In a paper written by Ronald L. Graham and Pavol Hell in 1985, they concluded that the
Minimum Spanning Tree Problem appears to have its origin in 1926 when Otakar Bor ˙uvka was
considering the rural electriﬁcation of Southern Moravia in the Czech Republic. There have been
a number of algorithmic solutions of this problem. We present two of the best known of these, the
ﬁrst of which is an algorithm due to Joseph Kruskal.
Kruskal’s Algorithm
Joseph Bernard Kruskal (1928-2010) was from a family of ﬁve children, three boys and two girls.
All boys became mathematicians. Kruskal received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1954.
Throughout his life he has been an active researcher, with a great deal of his work in mathematics
and linguistics. He spent much of his life working at Bell Laboratories. However, it was only two
years after completing his doctoral degree that the paper was published containing the algorithm
that bears his name.
Before we formally state Kruskal’s algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree T in a
connected weighted graph G, let’s see how this algorithm works. We start by selecting any edge of
G of smallest weight for the ﬁrst edge e1 of T and then select any remaining edge of G with smallest
weight for the second edge e2 of T . For the third edge e3 of T , we choose any remaining edge of G
with smallest weight that does not produce a cycle with the previously selected edges. We continue
in this manner until a spanning tree is produced. Therefore, the manner in which the roads were
chosen to be paved in the example above uses Kruskal’s algorithm. Let’s consider another example.
Example 13.28
Figure 13.28 shows how a minimum spanning tree of a connected weighted graph G is constructed
using Kruskal’s algorithm. We begin by selecting the edges having weights 2 and 3. When selecting
an edge with weight 4, only one can be selected since selecting both would produce a cycle. It
doesn’t matter, however, which edge of weight 4 is chosen. When choosing an edge having weight
5, only one edge of the two edges having weight 5 is possible, namely wx. This edge is chosen and
a minimum spanning tree has been constructed. The weight of a minimum spanning tree of G is
therefore 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14.
♦
We now present a formal statement of Kruskal’s algorithm.

Algorithm 13.29 (Kruskal’s Algorithm) This algorithm determines a minimum spanning tree
in a connected weighted graph G of order n and size m.
Input: A positive integer n, a positive integer m and a connected weighted graph G expressed
by its edge set E(G) = {e1, e2, . . ., em}, where w(ei) ≤w(ei+1) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m −1.

We illustrate Kruskal’s algorithm one additional time by ﬁnding a minimum spanning tree in the
connected weighted graph G in Figure 13.29.
Example 13.30
Use Kruskal’s algorithm to ﬁnd a minimum spanning tree in the connected weighted graph G shown
in Figure 13.29.
Solution. Since 7 is the smallest weight of an edge of G, we select the edge tu as our ﬁrst edge in the
minimum spanning tree T being constructed. The next three edges having smallest weights are xy,
uv and wz having weights 8, 10 and 12, respectively. Since no cycle is created from any of these four
edges, the three edges xy, uv and wz are added to T . The next smallest weight of an edge is 14 and
there are two such edges, namely tv and yz. Since adding tv to T would produce a cycle, this edge
is not selected; however, yz is added to T . The next smallest weight of an edge is 16. Two edges

Figure 13.29: Constructing a minimum spanning tree

have this weight, namely ux and tw. Either one of these would complete a minimum spanning tree,
so ux is selected arbitrarily. The resulting minimum spanning tree is also shown in Figure 13.29,
where (k), 1 ≤k ≤6, placed near an edge indicates that this is the kth edge chosen by Kruskal’s
algorithm. The weight of a minimum spanning tree of G is therefore 7+8+10+12+14+16 = 67. ♦
We now verify that a spanning tree constructed by Kruskal’s algorithm is, in fact, a minimum
spanning tree.
Theorem 13.31 Kruskal’s algorithm produces a minimum spanning tree in every connected weighted
graph.
Proof. Suppose that the theorem is false. Then there exists a connected weighted graph G of order
n ≥2 such that a spanning tree T produced by Kruskal’s algorithm is not a minimum spanning tree
of G. Let E(T ) = {e1, e2, . . ., en−1}, where the edges of T have been selected in the order listed.
Hence
w(e1) ≤w(e2) ≤· · · ≤w(en−1).
The weight of T is therefore
w(T ) =
n−1
X
i=1
w(ei).
Since T is not a minimum spanning tree of G, there is a spanning tree of G whose weight is less
than that of T . Among all minimum spanning trees of G, let T ′ be one having the greatest number
of edges in common with T . Certainly, T contains one or more edges that do not belong to T ′. Let
k be the smallest integer (1 ≤k ≤n −1) such that ek is an edge of T that does not belong to T ′
and deﬁne G′ = T ′ + ek. Therefore, G′ has exactly one cycle C. Since T has no cycles, C contains
an edge e not belonging to T . Therefore,
T ′′ = G′ −e = (T ′ + ek) −e
is a spanning tree of G whose weight is
w(T ′′) = w(T ′) + w(ek) −w(e).
Because T ′ is a minimum spanning tree of G, w(T ′) ≤w(T ′′) and so w(e) ≤w(ek). If k = 1,
then w(e) = w(e1) since e1 has the smallest weight among all edges of G. For k ≥2, by Kruskal’s
algorithm, ek is an edge of minimum weight such that the subgraph induced by {e1, e2, . . . , ek−1} ∪

516
CHAPTER 13. TREES
{ek} has no cycles. Since the subgraph induced by {e1, e2, . . . , ek−1} ∪{e} is a subgraph of T ′, this
subgraph has no cycles. By Kruskal’s algorithm, it follows that w(ek) ≤w(e) and so w(ek) = w(e).
This implies that w(T ′′) = w(T ′) and so T ′′ is a minimum spanning tree of G. However, T ′′ has one
more edge in common with T than T ′ does. This is a contradiction.
Prim’s Algorithm
The second algorithm we present is named for Robert Clay Prim (born in 1921). Prim received
his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1949. He served as vice president of research at the Sandia
Corporation. The paper containing the algorithm that bears his name was published in 1957, only
one year after Kruskal’s algorithm was published. This algorithm was originally discovered by the
Czech mathematician Vojtˇech Jarnik in 1930. Nevertheless, it is known as Prim’s algorithm.
Prim’s algorithm for constructing a minimum spanning tree T in a connected weighted graph G
begins with selecting a vertex r of G and an edge of smallest weight incident with r as the ﬁrst edge
e1 of T . For the second edge e2 of T , we select any remaining edge of G of smallest weight incident
with exactly one vertex already in T and add this edge to T .
The resulting graph is therefore
connected and contains no cycles, that is, the resulting graph is a tree. We continue this procedure
until a spanning tree is produced. Before presenting a formal statement of Prim’s algorithm for
constructing a spanning tree in a connected weighted graph, let’s illustrate how this method works.
Example 13.32
Figure 13.30 shows how a minimum spanning tree T of the connected weighted graph G is constructed
using Prim’s algorithm. Note that the graph G is the same graph shown in Figure 13.28. We choose
to begin with the vertex v of G to construct a minimum spanning tree T of G.

We now present a formal statement of Prim’s algorithm. In this case, however, we do not include
a proof that Prim’s algorithm accomplishes what it promises.

Algorithm 13.33
(Prim’s
Algorithm) This algorithm determines a minimum spanning tree
in a connected weighted graph G of order n and size m.
Input: A positive integer n, a positive integer m, a connected weighted graph G expressed
by its edge set E(G) = {e1, e2, . . ., em}, where w(ei) ≤w(ei+1) for i = 1, 2, . . ., m −1 and a
vertex r of G.
Output: The edge set E′ of a minimum spanning tree of G rooted at the vertex r.
1.
E′ := {e}, where e is an edge of minimum weight incident with r.
[E′ represents the edge set of the tree being considered.]
i := 1 [i counts the number of edges in the tree being considered.]
2.
while i < n −1 do
begin
3.
for j := 1 to m do [ej is the edge of G being considered.]
4.
while ej /∈E′ and the subgraph induced by E′ ∪{ej} is connected
and contains no cycles do

E′ := E′ ∪{ej}
i := i + 1
j := m + 1
end
end
5.
output E′
If all weights of the edges of a connected graph G are the same, say 1, then every spanning tree of
G is a minimum spanning tree. Indeed, a depth-ﬁrst search tree of G with root r and a breadth-ﬁrst
search tree of G with root r can both be considered as special cases of spanning trees of G with root
r constructed from Prim’s algorithm.
Prim’s algorithm is illustrated again by ﬁnding a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted
graph.

Use Prim’s algorithm to ﬁnd a minimum spanning tree in the connected weighted graph G shown
in Figure 13.29, which is then redrawn in Figure 13.31.

CHAPTER 13. TREES
Solution. We begin with a vertex of G, say v. Since 10 is the smallest weight of an edge of G that
is incident with v, we select the edge uv as our ﬁrst edge in the minimum spanning tree T being
constructed. Among the remaining edges incident with u or v, the edge ut has the smallest weight,
namely 7 and so we add ut to T as the second edge of T . The remaining edges that are incident
with a vertex in T are tv, tw and ux. Although tv has the smallest weight, namely 14 (each of tw
and ux has weight 16), this edge is not selected since adding tv to T would produce a cycle, namely
the cycle (u, v, t, u). On the other hand, we can add either tw or ux to T , say we add ux to T as
the third edge of T . Continuing in this manner, the next three edges we select for T are xy, yz and
zw and this completes a minimum spanning tree T . The resulting minimum spanning tree is also
shown in Figure 13.31. The order in which the six edges of T are selected is indicated by (1), (2),
. . ., (6).

Chapter 14
Planar Graphs and Graph
Colorings
In the 1850s a young British mathematician would ask a simple-sounding and curious question which,
for well over a century, would have the unexpected consequences of providing a major stimulus for
the development of and interest in graph theory: Can the regions of every map be colored with four
or fewer colors so that every two regions sharing some common boundary are colored diﬀerently?
This Four Color Problem combines two areas of graph theory, namely, planar graphs and graph
colorings. These two areas along with the Four Color Problem are discussed in this chapter.
14.1
Planar Graphs
In the introduction of Chapter 12, the question was asked as to whether utility lines from each of
the three utilities water, electricity and natural gas can be connected to three houses without any
two of the nine lines crossing each other. This problem is known as the Three Houses and Three
Utilities Problem.
As one looks at the Three Houses and Three Utilities Problem, perhaps it becomes clear that
this problem concerns the graph K3,3, where the three vertices of one partite set of K3,3 are the
three houses and the three vertices of the other partite set are the three utilities. Determining a
solution of the Three Houses and Three Utilities Problem is the same as determining whether the
graph K3,3 can be drawn in the plane without any of its edges crossing. If one attempts to draw
K3,3 in the plane so that none of its edges cross, then it is quite likely that diﬃculties arise (see
Figure 14.1). It is probably not clear how to draw K3,3 in the plane in this manner and also not
clear how to convince oneself that any drawing of K3,3 in the plane requires some edges to cross.

CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
Another graph that seems to present the same kind of diﬃculty is K5 (see Figure 14.2). That
is, neither (1) drawing K5 in the plane without any of its edges crossing nor (2) showing that K5
cannot be drawn in the plane without any of its edges crossing appears to be an easy task.

Figure 14.2: Drawing K5 in the plane
As one would probably expect, there are many graphs in addition to K5 and K3,3 for which it
appears to be very diﬃcult to determine whether they can be drawn in the plane without any of its
edges crossing. Of course, if we spend enough time trying (unsuccessfully) to draw a graph in the
plane without any of its edges crossing, then it becomes increasingly likely to conclude that it can’t
be done. There is, however, no mathematical basis for such a conclusion.
The Three Houses and Three Utilities Problem suggests the consideration of a certain class of
graphs. A graph is a plane graph if it is drawn in the plane so that no two of its edges cross.
Therefore, the graphs G1 and G3 of Figure 14.3 are plane graphs, while the graph G2 is not a plane
graph.
Deﬁnition 14.1
A graph G is a planar graph if G can be drawn in the plane so that no two of
its edges cross.
Certainly, the plane graphs G1 and G3 of Figure 14.3 are planar graphs as well, but the graph
G2 is also a planar graph since G2 can be drawn as the plane graph G3 (except for the labeling of
the vertices). Consequently, G2 and G3 are isomorphic graphs. A graph that is not planar is called,
not surprisingly, a nonplanar graph. None of the graphs in Figure 14.3 are nonplanar but we will
see examples of nonplanar graphs shortly.

Figure 14.3: Plane and planar graphs
There is a more modern application of planar graphs. Since wire crossing in circuit layouts
on silicon chips cause problems, we are interested in those circuits that can be modeled by planar
graphs.
Suppose that G is a connected plane graph. Then, of course, G is drawn in the plane without any
of its edges crossing. If we interpret a vertex as a point in the plane and an edge as a line segment
or curve and remove the vertices and edges of G from the plane, then certain connected pieces of
the plane are produced, called the regions of G. The vertices and edges of G that are incident with
a region R of G form a subgraph of G called the boundary of R. There is always one unbounded
region, called the exterior region of G. If G is a tree (which is a planar graph), then there is only

14.1. PLANAR GRAPHS
527
one region. However, if G contains a cycle, then G has at least two regions, as there is at least one
region interior to C and at least one region exterior to C. Some observations are useful here.
• An edge lies on the boundaries of two regions if and only if the edge lies on a cycle.
• A bridge lies on the boundary of a single region.
• The boundary of a region is a cycle unless one or more edges of the boundary are bridges.
Example 14.2
The connected plane graph G of Figure 14.4 has four regions denoted by R1, R2, R3 and R4, where
R4 is the exterior region of G. The boundaries of these four regions are shown in Figure 14.4 as
well. The plane graph G of Figure 14.4 has n = 11 vertices, m = 13 edges and r = 4 regions.

Figure 14.4: The boundaries of the regions of the plane graph in Example 14.2
If the numbers n, m and r are looked at for the graph of Figure 14.4 as well as a few other
connected plane graphs, then it might be noticed that n −m + r = 2 in every case. This is not a
coincidence. In fact, this identity goes back to Euler (the same Euler after whom Eulerian graphs
are named).
Euler corresponded with many mathematicians. One of these individuals was Christian Gold-
bach, perhaps best known for his conjecture that every even integer greater than 2 can be written
as the sum of two primes. In a letter from Euler to Goldbach dated November 14, 1750, Euler de-
scribed an observation he made among the number of vertices, the number of edges and the number
of faces of a polyhedron. This eventually became known as the Euler Polyhedron Formula or Euler
Polyhedron Identity.
Theorem 14.3
(The Euler Polyhedron Identity) If a polyhedron has V vertices, E edges and
F faces, then
V −E + F = 2.

528
CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
Although the Euler Polyhedron Identity ﬁrst appeared in print in 1752, the ﬁrst generally ac-
cepted proof of this result was obtained by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1794.
For every polyhedron, there is associated a plane graph, where the faces of the polyhedron
become the regions in the corresponding plane graph. For example, for the two polyhedra cube and
dodecahedron, V −E + F = 8 −12 + 6 = 2 and V −E + F = 20 −30 + 12 = 2, respectively, while
in the graphs of these two polyhedra, n −m + r = 8 −12 + 6 = 2 and n −m + r = 20 −30 + 12 = 2
(see Figure 14.5).

Figure 14.5: The Euler Polyhedron Identity for the cube and dodecahedron
The Euler Identity
The Euler Polyhedron Identity then not only applies to all graphs that are graphs of polyhedra
but to all connected plane graphs.
Theorem 14.4
(The Euler Identity) If G is a connected plane graph with n vertices, m edges
and r regions, then
n −m + r = 2.
Proof. We proceed by induction on m. For m = 0, there is only one connected plane graph, namely
K1. Since K1 has order n = 1, size m = 0 and r = 1 region, it follows that
n −m + r = 1 −0 + 1 = 2,
and the Euler Identity holds for m = 0.
Assume that the Euler Identity holds for all connected plane graphs of size m−1, where m−1 ≥0.
We show that the Euler Identity holds for all connected plane graphs of size m. Let G be a connected
plane graph of order n, size m and having r regions. If G is a tree, then there is only one region and
so r = 1. Since m = n −1, it follows that
n −m + r = n −(n −1) + 1 = 2.
We may assume then that G is not a tree. Then G contains a cycle C. Let e be an edge of C.
Then G −e is also a connected plane graph of order n, size m −1 and having r −1 regions. By the

14.1. PLANAR GRAPHS
529
induction hypothesis,
n −(m −1) + (r −1) = 2
and so n −m + r = 2.
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, it follows that if G is a connected plane graph with
n vertices, m edges and having r regions, then n −m + r = 2.
There is a class of planar graphs that will be of special interest to us. A graph G is called
maximal planar if G is planar but the addition of any edge joining two nonadjacent vertices of
G produces a nonplanar graph. If G is a maximal planar graph of order n ≥3, then, of course,
G can be drawn as a plane graph. The boundary of each region of G is a triangle, for otherwise,
an edge could be added to G to produce another planar graph, which is impossible. We state this
observation as follows.
Theorem 14.5
Let G be a plane graph of order 3 or more. Then G is maximal planar if and only
if the boundary of every region of G is a triangle.
The graph G1 of Figure 14.6 is maximal planar because it can be drawn as a plane graph such
that the boundary of every region is a triangle. The graphs G2 and G3 are also maximal planar
graphs, while G4 and G5 are planar graphs that are not maximal planar. Every maximal planar
graph of order n ≥3 has a speciﬁc size.

Figure 14.6: Maximal planar graphs and other planar graphs
Theorem 14.6
If G is a maximal planar graph of order n ≥3 and size m, then
m = 3n −6.
Proof. Draw G as a plane graph, resulting in r regions. By the Euler Identity, n −m + r = 2.
Since the boundary of every region of G is a triangle, G contains no bridges and every edge of G lies
on the boundaries of two regions. Hence if we count the number of edges on the boundary of each
region and sum these numbers over all regions of G, then we obtain 3r. Since this sum counts each
edge of G twice, 3r = 2m. Because m = n + r −2, it follows that
3m = 3n + 3r −6 = 3n + 2m −6

CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
and so m = 3n −6.
This theorem has an immediate corollary.
Corollary 14.7
If G is a planar graph of order n ≥3 and size m, then
m ≤3n −6.
Proof. If G is a maximal planar graph, then m = 3n −6 by Theorem 14.6. If G is not maximal
planar, then one or more edges can be added to G to produce a maximal planar graph of order n
and size m′, where m′ > m. Hence m < m′ = 3n −6.
There is a consequence of Corollary 14.7 that concerns the degrees of the vertices of a planar
graph.
Corollary 14.8 Every planar graph has a vertex of degree 5 or less.
Proof. Let G be a planar graph of order n and size m. If n ≤6, then every vertex of G has degree
5 or less; so we may assume that n ≥7. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a planar graph
G of order n ≥7 such that every vertex of G has degree 6 or more. Then
X
v∈V (G)
deg v ≥6n.
Since G is planar, m ≤3n −6 by Corollary 14.7. It then follows by the First Theorem of Graph
Theory that
6n ≤
X
v∈V (G)
deg v = 2m ≤2(3n −6) = 6n −12,
which is impossible.
Nonplanar Graphs
According to Corollary 14.7, if G is a planar graph of order n ≥3 and size m, then m ≤3n −6.
Since this is a necessary condition for a graph to be planar, it is most useful when stated in its
contrapositive form.
Corollary 14.9
If G is a graph of order n ≥3 and size m such that
m > 3n −6,
then G is nonplanar.
We are now in a position to prove that the complete graph K5 of order 5 is nonplanar.
Corollary 14.10
The complete graph K5 is nonplanar.
Proof. The graph K5 has order n = 5 and size m = 10. Since m = 10 > 3n −6 = 9, it follows by
Corollary 14.9 that K5 is nonplanar.
Example 14.11
Determine which of the graphs G1, G2 and G3 of Figure 14.7 are planar.

Solution. The graph G1 of Figure 14.7 is planar as it can be drawn as the plane graph G′ in
Figure 14.8. The graph G2 is nonplanar, however, as it has order n = 7 and size m = 16, where
m > 3n −6. Since G3 = K5, it follows by Corollary 14.10 that G3 is nonplanar.

Figure 14.8: A planar graph in Example 14.11
Example 14.12
The vertices of a certain graph G have degrees 2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7. Determine whether G is planar.
Solution. The graph G has n = 8 vertices. By the First Theorem of Graph Theory, the size of G is
m = 1
2
X
v∈V (G)
deg v = 1
2(2 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 7) = 19.
Since 19 = m > 3n −6 = 3 · 8 −6 = 18, it follows by Corollary 14.7 that G is nonplanar.
♦
Since we have shown an interest in whether K3,3 is planar, this suggests attempting to apply
Corollary 14.9 to K3,3. The order of K3,3 is n = 6 and its size is m = 9. However, m = 9 < 12 =
3n −6. Thus we cannot apply Corollary 14.9 and so no conclusion can be reached. That is, we still
do not know whether K3,3 is planar. On the other hand, if the proof of Theorem 14.6 is examined
more carefully, then an idea may be suggested.
Theorem 14.13
The graph K3,3 is nonplanar.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that K3,3 is planar. Therefore, K3,3 can be drawn as a plane graph,
resulting in r regions, say. By the Euler Identity, n−m+r = 2 and so 6−9+r = 2. Therefore, there
are r = 5 regions. Since K3,3 has no bridges, the boundary of every region of K3,3 is a cycle and
every edge lies on the boundaries of two regions. Counting the number of edges on the boundary of
each region and suming these numbers over all regions, we obtain the number N. Because K3,3 is
bipartite, it contains no odd cycles and so the boundary of every region contains at least four edges.
Hence
2m = 18 = N ≥4r = 4 · 5 = 20,
and so m ≥10, which produces a contradiction.

532
CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
As a consequence of Theorem 14.13, we now have a solution of the Three Houses and Three
Utilities Problem. It is not possible to connect the three houses to the three utilities without any of
the utility lines crossing.
We also have a great deal of additional information as to which graphs are planar. It should be
clear that if a graph G contains a nonplanar subgraph, then G too is nonplanar. Therefore, if a
graph G contains K5 or K3,3 as a subgraph, then G is nonplanar. Of course, we also know that if
G is a graph of order n and size m such that m > 3n −6, then G is nonplanar. Consider the graph
H of Figure 14.9, however. The graph H of Figure 14.9 has order n = 12 and size m = 15. Since
3n −6 = 30, it follows that m is (much) less than 3n −6. We have seen that when this occurs, no
conclusion can be drawn. The graph H surely does not contain K5 as a subgraph since K5 has ﬁve
vertices of degree 4 and H has no vertices of degree 4 or more. However, H does have six vertices
of degree 3; so perhaps H contains a subgraph isomorphic to K3,3. Since K3,3 contains exactly six
vertices of degree 3, each of the two partite sets of K3,3 must consist of three of these six vertices.
However, K3,3 is a 3-regular graph and since each vertex of degree 3 in H is adjacent only to one
other vertex of degree 3, it is impossible for H to contain K3,3 as a subgraph. We claim, however,
that despite all of this, the graph H of Figure 14.9 is nonplanar. Therefore, it must be possible for a
graph of order n ≥3 and size m to be nonplanar without having m > 3n−6 and without containing
either K5 or K3,3 as a subgraph. Before seeing why H is nonplanar, we consider another idea.

Figure 14.9: A nonplanar graph
A graph G′ is called a subdivision of a graph G if either G′ = G or G′ can be obtained from G
by inserting vertices of degree 2 into one or more edges of G, that is, by subdividing edges of G.
All of the graphs G, G1, G2 and G3 of Figure 14.10 are then subdivisions of the graph G. In fact,
G3 is also a subdivision of G1. The reason that subdivision is important in this subject is because
of the following observation.

Theorem 14.14 Let G′ be a subdivision of a graph G. Then G′ is planar if and only if G is planar.

Kuratowski’s Theorem
Because K5 and K3,3 are nonplanar, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 14.15
If G is a graph containing a subdivision of K5 or K3,3 as a subgraph, then G is
nonplanar.
Observe that the graph H of Figure 14.9 is a subdivision of K3,3 and is therefore nonplanar. The
graph H of Figure 14.9 is redrawn in Figure 14.11 so that it is clear that it is a subdivision of K3,3.

Figure 14.11: A subdivision of K3,3
Although Theorem 14.15 may not seem like a particularly remarkable result, what is remarkable
is that its converse is also true. This important theorem is known as Kuratowski’s theorem.
Kazimierz Kuratowski (1896–1980), well known for his research in the mathematical area of
topology, was one of the major contributors to mathematics in Poland during the 20th century, not
only because of his research but because he was so inﬂuential in mathematics education in his native
Poland following World War II.
Theorem 14.16
(Kuratowski’s
Theorem) A graph G is planar if and only if G contains no
subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3.

Determine whether the graph F ′ of Figure 14.12 is planar.

Figure 14.12: A nonplanar graph and a subdivision of K5
Solution. Since F ′ contains the graph F as a subgraph and F is a subdivision of K5, it follows by
Kuratowski’s theorem that F ′ is nonplanar.
♦
Let’s summarize then how we can determine whether a given graph is planar or nonplanar. To
show that G is planar, we basically have two methods.
• If we can draw G in the plane without any of its edges crossing, then of course G is planar.

534
CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
• If G contains less than ﬁve vertices of degree 4 or more and less than six vertices of degree 3
or more, then it is impossible for G to contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3
and so, by Kuratowski’s theorem, G is planar.
To show that G is nonplanar, we basically have two methods.
• One method is to identify a subgraph of G that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3.
• The other method is to show that the size m of G exceeds 3n −6, where n ≥3 is the order
of G.
This latter method is the preferred method since it is easy to compute m and 3n −6 and is so often
diﬃcult to locate a subgraph of G that is a subdivision of K5 or K3,3. Of course, the problem with
comparing m and 3n −6 is that it may be that m ≤3n −6, in which case we have learned nothing.

Coloring Graphs
In 1852 a young British mathematician by the name of Francis Guthrie noticed that he could color
the counties in a map of England with four colors in such a way that no two counties with a common
boundary were assigned the same color. This led Guthrie to wonder whether the regions of any map
could be colored with four or fewer colors so that adjacent regions (regions sharing a common
boundary) are colored diﬀerently. Figure 14.17 shows two maps whose regions can be colored with
four or fewer colors, where the colors are the positive integers 1, 2, 3, 4. Observe that in Map 2,

the regions R1 and R3 are colored the same. This is acceptable as these two regions share only a
common point, not a common boundary.

Figure 14.17: Coloring the regions of two maps
Francis Guthrie believed that he may have even proved that every map could be colored with
four or fewer colors but he was not satisﬁed with his argument. Francis mentioned this problem to
his younger brother Frederick, who at the time was a student of the famous mathematician Augustus
De Morgan (after whom De Morgan’s Laws are named). Frederick then mentioned this problem to
De Morgan on October 23, 1852. De Morgan was intrigued by this problem and wrote about it that
very same day to William Rowan Hamilton (after whom Hamiltonian graphs are named).
A student of mine asked me to day to give him a reason for a fact which I did not
know was a fact – and do not yet. He says that if a ﬁgure be anyhow divided and the
compartments diﬀerently coloured so that ﬁgures with any portion of common boundary
line are diﬀerently coloured – four colours may be wanted but not more – the following
is his case in which four are wanted.

Query cannot a necessity for ﬁve or more be invented.
(And, yes, De Morgan wrote to day not today.) On October 26, 1852 Hamilton gave a prompt, but
probably unexpected reply to De Morgan’s letter:
I am not likely to attempt your “quaternion” of colours very soon.
Although Hamilton did not appear to show interest in this problem, De Morgan talked about the
problem often and to many mathematicians. This problem eventually became known as the Four
Color Problem.
There is a natural connection between the Four Color Problem and graphs. With every map
M, there is associated a connected graph G, called the dual graph of M, where the vertices of
G are the regions of M and two vertices of G are adjacent if the corresponding regions share a
common boundary. Every dual graph is in fact a connected planar graph. The graphs G1 and G2
in Figure 14.18 are the dual graphs of Map 1 and Map 2 of Figure 14.17, where each vertex (region)
is labeled by the color of the vertex.

Figure 14.18: The dual graphs of Map 1 and Map 2 of Figure 14.37
Not only is the dual graph of every map a connected planar graph, each connected planar graph
is the dual graph of some map. Thus the Four Color Problem, originally stated for maps, can be
stated in terms of graphs.
The Four Color Problem Can the vertices of every planar graph be colored with four or fewer
colors so that every two adjacent vertices are colored diﬀerently?
The Chromatic Number of a Graph
We will return to the Four Color Problem soon, after introducing some terminology on coloring
graphs in general.
Deﬁnition 14.18
A coloring of a graph G is an assignment of colors to the vertices of G, one
color to each vertex of G, such that adjacent vertices of G are colored diﬀerently. A k-coloring is
a coloring that uses k colors. A graph G is k-colorable if G can be colored with k or fewer colors.
Since there are other kinds of “colorings” of graphs, the coloring described in Deﬁnition 14.18 is
often called a proper coloring of a graph. We will assume here, however, that every coloring of
(the vertices of) a graph is a proper coloring. We can think of the colors here as being red, blue,
green and so on or as positive integers 1, 2, 3, . . . or, indeed, as the elements of any set.
Example 14.19
Using positive integers as colors, several colorings of a graph H are shown in Figure 14.19. If we
look at the three colorings of the graph H given in Figure 14.19, we see that the ﬁrst coloring is a
4-coloring, the second coloring is a 3-coloring and the third coloring is a 2-coloring. Of course, we
could assign a diﬀerent color to each of the six vertices of H and so there are colorings of H that are
6-colorings. It is also easy to ﬁnd a 5-coloring of H. However, the question of greatest interest here
is the following: What is the smallest number of colors in a coloring of H? Actually, this question is
quite easy to answer for the graph H of Figure 14.19. We already know that there exists a coloring
(namely the third coloring) that uses two colors. Since H contains edges, we certainly need at least
two colors. Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of H is 2.
♦
Deﬁnition 14.20
The smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of a graph G is called
the chromatic number of G and is denoted by χ(G).
Therefore, χ(H) = 2 for the graph H of Figure 14.19. (The symbol χ is the Greek letter chi.)
The procedure we used to show that the graph H of Figure 14.19 has chromatic number 2 is typical
of the method we employ to show that any graph has a speciﬁc chromatic number. In particular, to
show that a graph G has chromatic number k, say, we must do two things:
(1) Show that the vertices of G can be colored with k colors, say 1, 2, . . . , k (such that adjacent
vertices are colored diﬀerently).

Figure 14.19: Colorings of the graph H in Example 14.19
(2) Show that every coloring of G requires at least k colors.
Actually, (1) establishes the inequality χ(G) ≤k, while (2) establishes the inequality χ(G) ≥k.
Combining these two inequalities gives us the desired result that χ(G) = k.
Showing that the vertices of G can be colored with k colors probably seems much easier than
showing that we must use at least k colors to color the vertices of G. Although this is often true,
there are some observations that will be helpful to us, beginning with a simple one.
Let G be a graph. Then χ(G) ≥2 if and only if G contains at least one edge.
An immediate consequence of this fact is the following.
Corollary 14.21 A graph G has chromatic number 1 if and only if G = Kn for some positive
integer n.
The graphs with chromatic number 2 are also easy to describe.
Theorem 14.22
Let G be a nonempty graph. Then χ(G) = 2 if and only if G is bipartite.
Proof. First, let G be a nonempty bipartite graph with partite sets U and W. Since G is nonempty,
χ(G) ≥2. Assign the color 1 to every vertex of U and the color 2 to every vertex of W. Since every
edge of G joins a vertex of U and a vertex of W, adjacent vertices of G are colored diﬀerently, as
required. Therefore, χ(G) = 2.
For the converse, let G be a graph with chromatic number 2. Hence the vertices of G can be
colored with two colors, say 1 and 2, such that adjacent vertices of G are colored diﬀerently. Let V1
be the set of vertices colored 1 and V2 the set of vertices colored 2. Since every edge of G joins a
vertex of V1 and a vertex of V2, it follows that G is a bipartite graph with partite sets V1 and V2.
Because a graph G is bipartite if and only if G has no odd cycles (Theorem 12.31), there is an
immediate corollary.
Corollary 14.23
Let G be a graph. Then χ(G) ≥3 if and only if G contains an odd cycle.
By Corollary 14.23, we can show that the chromatic number of a graph is at least 3 if it contains
an odd cycle. Indeed, the chromatic number of each cycle can be determined.
Example 14.24
For every integer n ≥3,
χ(Cn)
=

2
if n is even
3
if n is odd.
Solution. If n is even, then Cn is a bipartite graph and so χ(Cn) = 2 by Theorem 14.22. If n is
odd, then χ(Cn) ≥3 by Corollary 14.23. To show that χ(Cn) ≤3, let Cn = (v1, v2, . . . , vn, v1). If

540
CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
we assign color 1 to the vertex vi for each odd integer i with 1 ≤i ≤n −2, color 2 to the vertex
vi for each even integer i (2 ≤i ≤n −1), and color 3 to the remaining vertex vn, then we have a
3-coloring of Cn, implying that χ(Cn) ≤3. Therefore, χ(Cn) = 3 if n is odd.
♦
Another well-known class of graphs whose chromatic numbers are easy to determine are the
complete graphs.
Theorem 14.25
Let n be a positive integer. A graph G of order n has chromatic number n if and
only if G = Kn.
Proof. If we assign the colors 1, 2, . . ., n to the vertices of Kn, one color to each vertex, then we
have an n-coloring of Kn. Thus χ(Kn) ≤n. On the other hand, because every two vertices of Kn
are adjacent, every two vertices of Kn must be colored diﬀerently and so χ(Kn) ≥n. Therefore,
χ(Kn) = n.
For the converse, let G be a graph of order n that is not complete.
Then G contains two
nonadjacent vertices u and v. Assigning the color 1 to u and v and distinct colors from {2, 3, . . ., n−1}
to the remaining n −2 vertices of G produces an (n −1)-coloring of G. Thus χ(G) ̸= n.
We next present a simple but useful observation.
Theorem 14.26
If H is a subgraph of a graph G, then
χ(H) ≤χ(G).
Proof. Suppose that χ(G) = k. Then there exists a coloring of the vertices of G with the colors 1,
2, . . ., k. Since this also provides a proper coloring of H with some or all of the colors 1, 2, . . ., k,
it follows that
χ(H) ≤k = χ(G),
as desired.
By Theorem 14.26, it follows that if a graph G contains K5 as a subgraph, for example, then
χ(G) ≥χ(K5) = 5. Of course, to show that χ(G) = 5, if this is what we believe, then we are
required to ﬁnd a 5-coloring of G. We now consider an example of this.
Example 14.27
Determine the chromatic number of the graph F of Figure 14.20.

Solution. Since the subgraph induced by the set {u2, v2, w2, x2, y2} of vertices of F is K5, it follows
by Theorem 14.26 that χ(F) ≥5.
However, there is a 5-coloring of F in Figure 14.20 and so
χ(F) ≤5. Therefore, χ(F) = 5.
♦

14.2. COLORING GRAPHS
541
We mention one other useful fact in coloring graphs. Suppose that G is a graph containing a
subgraph H whose chromatic number is known to us, say χ(H) = k. If G contains a vertex v /∈V (H)
that is adjacent to every vertex of H, then any color assigned to v must be diﬀerent from the colors
assigned to H and so χ(G) ≥k + 1.

Determine the chromatic number of the graph G of Figure 14.21.

Figure 14.21: The graph G in Example 14.28
Solution. Since G contains an odd cycle (namely the 7-cycle C = (t, u, v, w, x, y, z, t) as well as
many triangles), it follows by Corollary 14.23 that χ(G) ≥3. Since the vertex s is adjacent to every
vertex of C, it follows that χ(G) ≥4. Because the vertices of G can be colored with four colors
(namely, 1, 2, 3, 4 in Figure 14.21), χ(G) ≤4. Therefore, χ(G) = 4.

Figure 14.22: The graph H in Example 14.29
Solution. Since the graph H of Figure 14.22 contains an odd cycle (in fact, both triangles and
5-cycles), it follows that χ(H) ≥3. It might be quite easy to make a mistake at this point. We
could start with the 5-cycle and observe that this requires three colors. We might color vertex u
with color 1, vertex v with color 2, vertex w with color 3, vertex x with color 1 and vertex y with
color 2. However, the vertex z is now adjacent to vertices colored 1, 2, 3 and a diﬀerent color is
required for z, namely color 4. Actually, all this does is establish the inequality χ(H) ≤4. In fact,
the vertices of H can be colored with three colors (as shown in Figure 14.22). Therefore, χ(H) ≤3
and so χ(H) = 3.

CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
Applications of Colorings
Let us return to a question that we posed in the introduction of Chapter 12.
Example 14.30
Eleven chemicals are to be shipped to a chemistry department at a university. Two chemicals that
can react with each other should not be placed in the same container during the shipment. The
chemicals that cannot be shipped in the same container are listed below:
c1 : c2, c5, c7, c10
c2 : c3, c6, c8 (as well as c1)
c3 : c4, c7, c9
c4 : c5, c8, c10
c5 : c6, c9
c11 : c6, c7, c8, c9, c10.
So, for example, c1 cannot be shipped in the same container with any of c2, c5, c7, c10 and c2 cannot
be shipped in the same container with any of c3, c6, c8 (as well as with c1 of course). What is the
smallest number of containers that can be shipped safely to the university?
Solution. This situation can be modeled by a graph G with V (G) = {c1, c2, . . . , c11}, where two
vertices ci and cj (i ̸= j) are adjacent if they cannot be shipped in the same container. This graph
is shown in Figure 14.23(a). The minimum number of containers that can be shipped safely to
the university is χ(G). Since G has an odd cycle, χ(G) ≥3. Since there is a 4-coloring of G (in
Figure 14.23(b)), χ(G) ≤4. So either χ(G) = 3 or χ(G) = 4.

Figure 14.23: The graph G in Example 14.30
We show in fact that χ(G) = 4. Assume, to the contrary, that χ(G) = 3. Then there is a
3-coloring of G using the colors 1, 2, 3, say. Since C = (c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c1) is a 5-cycle, three colors
are required to color the vertices of C. Because of the symmetry of the graph G, we may assume
that the color 1 is used to color one of the vertices of C, say vertex c1, and the colors 2 and 3 are
used twice each. (See Figure 14.23(c).) Since c6 is adjacent to vertices colored 2 and 3, it must be
colored 1. Similarly, c7 is colored 2 and c10 is colored 3. However then, c11 is adjacent to vertices

14.2. COLORING GRAPHS
543
colored 1, 2 and 3, which makes it impossible to color c11 with any of these colors. Since no 3-coloring
of G exists, χ(G) = 4.
♦
Observe that we were able to conclude that χ(G) = 4 for the graph G of Figure 14.23(a) and
yet G does not contain K4 as a subgraph. Hence there exists a graph G with χ(G) = 4 that does
not contain K4 as a subgraph. Moreover, this graph G does not even contain K3 as a subgraph. In
fact, for each integer k ≥3, there exists a graph Gk with χ(Gk) = k such that Gk does not contain
K3 as a subgraph. The graph G of Figure 14.23(a) illustrates this fact for k = 4.
Another application of coloring involves questions of scheduling.
Example 14.31
The following eight individuals from eight branch oﬃces of a software company are present at the
main oﬃce of the company to discuss a number of issues:
Allen (a), Brenda (b), Carlos (c), Dennis (d),
Edith (e), Fay (f), George (g) Harriet (h).
It is the responsibility of Idina, from the main oﬃce, to schedule 90-minute meetings of six 3-person
committees during one of the days and then meet with all eight people after the six meetings have
been taken place. The six committees are
C1 ={a, c, d},
C2 ={a, e, f},
C3 ={a, b, h},
C4 ={e, f, g},
C5 ={c, e, g},
C6 ={b, f, g}.
Of course, if the six committee meetings are scheduled one after another, then this will take 9 hours
and it will be a long day, to everyone’s displeasure. But perhaps these meetings could be scheduled
in less than six time periods. For example, committees C1 and C4 could be scheduled to meet at
the same time since none of the eight individuals are members of both committees. On the other
hand, committees C1 and C2 must meet during diﬀerent time periods since Allen is a member of
both committees. There is now a natural question: What is the minimum number of time periods
for all six committees to meet?
Solution. This situation can be modeled by a graph G whose vertices are the six committees C1,
C2, . . ., C6. Two vertices Ci and Cj (i ̸= j) of G are adjacent if there is an individual who is a
member of both of these committees. The graph G is shown in Figure 14.24. The minimum number
of time periods for these six committee meetings is χ(G).

Figure 14.24: The graph G in Example 14.31
Observe that the subgraph H of G induced by {C2, C4, C5, C6} is a complete graph of order 4
and so G contains K4 as a subgraph. Since 4 = χ(H) ≤χ(G), it follows that χ(G) ≥4. On the
other hand, the vertices of G can be colored with four colors 1, 2, 3, 4 as shown in Figure 14.24.
Therefore, χ(G) = 4.
Since χ(G) = 4, the six meetings can be scheduled in four 90-minute time periods (but no fewer)
and within six hours all meetings can be held:

A graph G is constructed with vertex set V (G) = {L1, L2, . . . , L6}, where Li is adjacent
to Lj (i ̸= j) if cars in lanes Li and Lj cannot proceed safely through the intersection at the same

χ(G) ≥3. Since there is a 3-coloring of G (see Figure 14.26), it follows that χ(G) = 3. For example,
since L1, L5 and L6 are colored the same, cars in those three lanes may proceed safely through the
intersection at the same time.

Upper Bounds for the Chromatic Number
There is no formula that gives the chromatic number of each graph and ﬁnding the chromatic
number of a graph can be quite challenging. Although we may not be able to determine the chromatic

14.2. COLORING GRAPHS
545
number of a graph G, it can be shown that χ(G) can never be much larger than its maximum
degree ∆(G).
Theorem 14.33
For every graph G,
χ(G) ≤1 + ∆(G).
Proof. Suppose that the theorem is false. Then there exists some graph G of order n, say, for which
χ(G) > 1 + ∆(G). Let ∆(G) = ∆. Let p be the maximum number of vertices of G that can be
colored with 1 + ∆colors so that adjacent vertices are colored diﬀerently. Let H be the subgraph
of G induced by p such vertices and let a coloring of H with 1 + ∆colors be given. By assumption,
p < n. Let v be one of the vertices of G that does not belong to H. Since v is adjacent to at most
∆vertices of G, it follows that v is adjacent to at most ∆vertices of H. Thus there are at most
∆vertices adjacent to v that have been assigned a color. Hence at least one of the 1 + ∆colors is
available for v. Assigning such a color to v produces a contradiction.
For the complete graph Kn, we know that χ(Kn) = n and ∆(Kn) = n −1. So
χ(Kn) = 1 + ∆(Kn).
Also, for an odd integer n ≥3, we know that χ(Cn) = 3 and ∆(Cn) = 2. Therefore,
χ(Cn) = 1 + ∆(Cn).
Therefore, there are graphs G, namely Cn, where n ≥3 is odd, and Kn, where n ≥1, for which
χ(G) = 1 + ∆(G).
Rowland Leonard Brooks showed, however, that these are the only two classes of connected graphs
for which this is true.
Theorem 14.34 (Brooks’ Theorem) If G is a connected graph that is neither a complete graph
nor an odd cycle, then
χ(G) ≤∆(G).
The Five Color Theorem and Four Color Theorem
Let us now return to the Four Color Problem, which asks whether every planar graph is 4-
colorable. Because the chromatic number of a graph G is the largest chromatic number among the
components of G, we can restrict ourselves to connected planar graphs only. Since K4 is a planar
graph and χ(K4) = 4, there are certainly some planar graphs that require four colors. But the Four
Color Problem suggests that no planar graph requires ﬁve colors.
A major event in the history of the Four Color Problem occurred in 1879, when the British
barrister (lawyer) Alfred Bray Kempe wrote a paper which contained a “proof” that every planar
graph is 4-colorable. For the period 1879-1890, the Four Color Problem was considered to be solved.
However, in 1890 the British mathematician Percy John Heawood discovered an error in Kempe’s
argument which neither he nor Kempe could correct. Despite the fact that Kempe’s proof was
incorrect, his technique was ingenious and Heawood used Kempe’s technique to prove the following
theorem.
Theorem 14.35
(The Five Color Theorem) Every planar graph is 5-colorable.
Proof. We proceed by induction on the order of planar graphs. If G is a planar graph of order 5 or
less, then certainly χ(G) ≤5. This veriﬁes the basis step of induction. We now turn to the inductive
step. Assume that the chromatic number of every planar graph of order k, where k ≥5, is at most

546
CHAPTER 14. PLANAR GRAPHS AND GRAPH COLORINGS
5. We show that the chromatic number of every planar graph of order k + 1 is at most 5. Let G be
a planar graph of order k + 1. By Corollary 14.8, G contains a vertex v with deg v ≤5. Since G −v
is a planar graph of order k, it follows by the induction hypothesis that χ(G −v) ≤5. Hence there
exists a 5-coloring of G −v. Let a 5-coloring of G −v be given, using the colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. If the
neighbors of v in G are colored with four or fewer colors, then at least one of the colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
is available for v. Assigning this color to v produces a 5-coloring of G and so χ(G) ≤5.
Hence we may assume that deg v = 5 and that all ﬁve colors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are used to color the
ﬁve vertices adjacent to v. Draw G as a plane graph. We may assume that the vertices adjacent to
v are v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 located in clockwise order about v. Furthermore, we may assume that vi is
colored i for 1 ≤i ≤5. (See Figure 14.27.)

Figure 14.27: The neighbors of v in the planar graph G
Consider two vertices adjacent to v that do not appear consecutively as we proceed about v, say
v1 and v3. Now there may or may not be a v1 −v3 path in G −v all of whose vertices are colored 1
or 3. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. There is no v1 −v3 path in G −v, all of whose vertices are colored 1 or 3. Let H be
the subgraph of G −v induced by those vertices colored 1 or 3. Since H contains no v1 −v3 path,
v1 and v3 belong to diﬀerent components of H. (See Figure 14.28.) Suppose that v1 belongs to the
component H1 of H. Interchanging the colors of the vertices in H1 produces a new 5-coloring of
G −v in which v1 is colored 3. The color of v3 is not aﬀected, however, and is still colored 3 in this
new 5-coloring of G −v. Since no vertex adjacent to v is colored 1, the vertex v may now be colored
1, which produces a 5-coloring of G and so χ(G) ≤5.

Case 2. There is a v1 −v3 path in G −v, all of whose vertices are colored 1 or 3. Once again, let
H be the subgraph of G −v induced by those vertices colored 1 or 3. Then v1 and v3 belong to the
same component H1 of H. (See Figure 14.29.) Therefore, interchanging the colors of the vertices
in H1 has no beneﬁt as the neighbors of v are still colored with ﬁve colors. However, since G is a
plane graph, there is no v2 −v4 path in G −v, all of whose vertices are colored 2 or 4. Let F be
the subgraph of G −v induced by those vertices colored 2 or 4. Then v2 and v4 belong to diﬀerent
components of F. Let F2 be the component of F containing v2. If we interchange the colors of

14.2. COLORING GRAPHS
547
the vertices in F2, then no vertex adjacent to v is colored 2. By assigning v the color 2, we have a
5-coloring of G and so χ(G) ≤5.

Figure 14.29: The situation in Case 2 in the proof of Theorem 14.35
By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the chromatic number of every planar graph is at
most 5.
By the end of the 19th century, it was known that every planar graph is 5-colorable but no one
knew of a single example of a planar graph that required ﬁve colors. Many mathematicians worked
on the Four Color Problem until 1976 when Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken of the University of
Illinois announced that they had constructed a proof of the theorem. This proof, however, involved
a large number of cases and required substantial use of computers to verify the details in each case.
Consequently and ﬁnally, the Four Color Problem had been solved.
The Four Color Theorem
Every planar graph is 4-colorable.
Despite the fact that the Four Color Problem had been solved, many mathematicians were
dissatisﬁed with the proof because of the large number of cases and its heavy reliance on computers.
Twenty years later, in 1996, a considerably improved proof of the Four Color Theorem was given
by Neil Robertson, Daniel Sanders, Paul Seymour and Robin Thomas. Even this proof, however,
required extensive use of computers. To this day, no proof of the Four Color Theorem has been
given that has not made signiﬁcant use of computers.

17. During this coming summer, the Department of Mathematical Sciences at a university plans to
oﬀer courses in the following subjects: discrete mathematics (dm), vector calculus (vc), linear
algebra (la), data structures (ds), algorithms (al), statistics (st). The following information is
known about ﬁve students who plan to take courses this summer:
Alvin plans to take discrete mathematics, vector calculus and linear algebra.
Beverly plans to take discrete mathematics, data structures and linear algebra.
Clark plans to take discrete mathematics, algorithms and data structures.
Donna plans to take vector calculus and statistics.
Edward plans to take statistics and algorithms.
The only time periods when courses are taught in the summer are 8:00-9:45, 10:15-12:00, 1:30-
3:15. Can all six courses be oﬀered during these time periods so that two courses are not
taught at the same time if some student plans to take both courses?

the edges of G incident with v and arranged cyclically about v. Suppose that the vertex ui (of
degree 2) is inserted into the edge ei (1 ≤i ≤k) and the edges u1u2, u2u3, . . . , uk−1uk, uku1

Chapter 15
Directed Graphs
One of the most common applications of graphs is their use in modeling some locations in a city,
some pairs of which are connected by streets. We have also noted that graphs do not accurately
capture the structure of a street system in which some locations are connected by two or more
streets. In this situation, a multigraph can be used. Should some or all of the streets be one-way
streets, however, then neither a graph nor a multigraph accurately reﬂects this street system. In
this case, the structure we need is a directed graph, most commonly called a digraph. This concept
is introduced in this chapter together with the best known class of digraphs, called tournaments.
Digraphs can also be used to model a class of structures known as ﬁnite-state machines.
15.1
Fundamental Concepts of Digraph Theory
Suppose that V = {2, 4, 8, 12} is a set of vertices and that each vertex is represented in the plane by
a point or small circle and that a directed line segment or curve is drawn from vertex i to vertex j
(i ̸= j) if i | j. This structure is shown in Figure 15.1 and is called a digraph D.

Figure 15.1: A digraph
We now give a formal deﬁnition of a digraph.
Deﬁnition 15.1
A digraph (or directed graph) D is a ﬁnite nonempty set V (D) (of vertices)
and a set E(D) of ordered pairs of distinct vertices of D, each ordered pair of which is referred to
as a directed edge or an arc.
A directed edge (u, v) is represented in a diagram of a digraph by drawing a directed line segment
or directed curve from u to v. For a directed edge e = (u, v) in a digraph D, the vertex u is called
the initial vertex of e and v is the terminal vertex of e. Unlike uv and vu, which represent the
same edge in a graph, the directed edges (u, v) and (v, u) in a digraph are not the same. If u and
v are two vertices in a digraph D, then D may contain one, neither or both of the directed edges
(u, v) and (v, u). If, in the deﬁnition of digraph, for each pair u, v of distinct vertices, at most one
of (u, v) and (v, u) is a directed edge, then the resulting digraph is called an oriented graph. An
oriented graph D can therefore be obtained by assigning a direction to each edge of some graph G.
In this case, the oriented graph D is called an orientation of G. Figure 15.2 shows two digraphs

CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
D1, D2 and a graph G. The digraph D1 is not an oriented graph (since both (v, w) and (w, v) are
arcs of D1), while D2 is an oriented graph. Indeed, D2 is an orientation of the graph G.

Figure 15.2: Two digraphs and a graph
Example 15.2
Soccer teams from the countries of Brazil, China, Germany and Spain play one another. Brazil
defeats China and Spain, while Germany defeats Brazil and Spain.
Also, Spain defeats China,
which in turn defeats Germany. Model this situation by a digraph.
Solution. Let D be a digraph whose vertices are the four countries. We then draw a directed edge
from a country to each country that it defeats. The digraph D is shown in Figure 15.3. Actually,
this digraph is an oriented graph.

Figure 15.3: The digraph in Example 15.2
Two vertices u and v in a digraph D are adjacent if D contains at least one of the directed
edges (u, v) and (v, u). More speciﬁcally, if (u, v) is a directed edge of D, then we say that u is
adjacent to v and v is adjacent from u. The number of vertices to which a vertex v is adjacent
is the outdegree of v and is denoted by od v or od(v). The number of vertices from which v is
adjacent is the indegree of v and is denoted by id v or id(v). (See Figure 15.4.)

Figure 15.4: The outdegree and indegree of a vertex
As with graphs, the number of vertices in a digraph D is called the order of D and the number of
directed edges in D is the size of D. When the outdegrees of the vertices of a digraph are summed,
each directed edge is counted exactly once. The same is true when the indegrees are added. This
observation leads us to the digraph counterpart of Theorem 12.10.
Theorem 15.3 (The First Theorem of Digraph Theory) If D is a digraph of size m, then
X
v∈V (D)
od v =
X
v∈V (D)
id v = m.
The digraph D of Figure 15.5 has order n = 4 and size m = 5. Furthermore,

15.1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF DIGRAPH THEORY
561
od u = 1, id u = 3; od v = 1, id v = 0;
od w = 2, id w = 1; od x = id x = 1.
As is guaranteed by Theorem 15.3, the sum of the outdegrees of the vertices of D equals the sum of
the indegrees of the vertices of D equals 5.

Figure 15.6: The adjacency matrix of a digraph
Corresponding to the concepts of walk, trail, path, circuit and cycle in graphs are expected
counterparts in digraphs. The two that will be most useful to us are directed paths and directed
cycles.
Let D = (V, E) be a digraph.
A directed u −v path in D is a sequence P = (u =
u0, u1, . . . , uk = v) of distinct vertices of D such that (ui, ui+1) ∈E for 0 ≤i ≤k −1.
The
directed path P has length k. A directed cycle in D is a sequence C = (v0, v1, . . . , vℓ, v0), where
ℓ≥2, the vertices v0, v1, . . . , vℓare distinct and (vi, vi+1) ∈E for 0 ≤i ≤ℓ−1 and (vℓ, v0) ∈E.
For the digraph D of Figure 15.7, P = (v, u, w, y, x) is a directed v −x path of length 4, while
C = (u, w, y, v, u) is a directed cycle of length 4 and C′ = (u, w, u) is a directed cycle of length 2.

CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
Connected Digraphs
The underlying graph of a digraph D is obtained by removing all directions from the arcs of
D and replacing any resulting pair of parallel edges by a single edge. That is, the underlying graph
of the digraph D is obtained by replacing each arc (u, v) or pair (u, v), (v, u) of arcs by the edge uv.
The graph G of Figure 15.8 is therefore the underlying graph of the digraph D of that ﬁgure. A
digraph D is connected if its underlying graph is connected. Thus the digraph D in Figure 15.8
is connected. A digraph D is strongly connected or simply strong if D contains both a directed
u −v path and a directed v −u path for every pair u, v of distinct vertices of D. While the digraph
D1 of Figure 15.8 is strong, the digraph D2 is not strong as there is no directed u −x path in D
for example. In fact, there is no directed path from any vertex in {u, v, w} to any vertex in {x, y, z}
in D2.

Figure 15.8: Connected digraphs
Distance is deﬁned in digraphs as well as in graphs. If u and v are vertices in a digraph D for
which there is a directed u −v path, then the directed distance ⃗d(u, v) from u to v is the length
of a shortest u −v path in D. In order for ⃗d(u, v) to be deﬁned for every pair u, v of vertices of
D, the digraph D must be strong. For example, for the two vertices u and v in the strong digraph
D1 of Figure 15.8, ⃗d(u, v) = 1 and ⃗d(v, u) = 5; while in the digraph D2 of Figure 15.8 the directed
distance ⃗d(s, t) is not deﬁned if s ∈{u, v, w} and t ∈{x, y, z}.
In connection with the concept of a strong digraph is the following related problem. A small
university town ordinarily has light traﬃc but the university has a very popular football team, which
results in heavy traﬃc on football Saturdays. To ease the traﬃc on those days, the town council
has decided to convert all streets from two-way streets to one-way streets. Of course, it is essential
that after the conversion of the streets to one-way streets it is possible to drive (legally) from any
intersection in the town to every other intersection in town. The question here is not only whether
this can be done in this town but under what conditions this can be done in any town. This is
equivalent to determining which graphs have a strong orientation.
This question was ﬁrst addressed in 1939 by Herbert Robbins (1915–2001). Robbins was not
only a well-known statistician but a co-author (with Richard Courant) of the popular mathematics
book What is Mathematics?
It is probably clear that in order for a graph G to have a strong orientation, G must be connected
and contain no bridges. Robbins showed, however, that these conditions are all that are needed,
that is, these conditions are suﬃcient as well as necessary for G to have a strong orientation.
Before presenting Robbins’ theorem, we ﬁrst make some observations. Let G be a nontrivial
connected graph having no bridges.
By Theorem 12.36, every edge of G lies on a cycle of G.
Therefore, G contains cycles. Let

15.1. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF DIGRAPH THEORY
563
C = (v1, v2, . . . , vr, v1)
be a cycle of G. Suppose that we direct the edges of C cyclically, obtaining the directed edges
(v1, v2), (v2, v3), . . ., (vr−1, vr), (vr, v)
and direct any other edge joining two vertices of C arbitrarily. Then the subgraph H with V (H) =
V (C) has a strong orientation. In particular, if C is a Hamiltonian cycle of G, then G itself has a
strong orientation.
Theorem 15.5
A nontrivial graph G has a strong orientation if and only if G is connected and
contains no bridges.
Proof. We have already mentioned that if G has a strong orientation, then G is connected and
contains no bridges. It remains therefore only to verify the converse.
Suppose that G is a nontrivial connected graph of order n containing no bridges. Since G contains
no bridges, G contains cycles and by our earlier observation, G contains subgraphs having a strong
orientation. Let H be a subgraph of maximum order k in G having a strong orientation. If k = n,
then G itself has a strong orientation. Hence we may assume that k < n. Since G is connected,
there is a vertex v of G not belonging to H that is adjacent to a vertex u of H. Since e = uv is not
a bridge, e lies on a cycle
C′ = (u = v1, v = v2, . . . , vr, v1).
Direct the edges of C′ cyclically about C′ that have not already been directed. Then the subgraph
F with
V (F) = V (H) ∪V (C′) and E(F) = E(H) ∪E(C′)
has a strong orientation. Since the order of F is greater than k, this is a contradiction.
Example 15.6
Since the graph G of Figure 15.9(a) is connected and contains no bridges, it follows by Theorem 15.5
that G has a strong orientation. We now construct a strong orientation of G. Following the proof
of Theorem 15.5, we begin with a cycle in G, say
C = (v1, v2, . . . , v10, v1).
Directing the edges of C cyclically about C and directing the edges v1v8 and v2v9 arbitrarily, we
obtain a strong orientation of a subgraph H of G shown in Figure 15.9(b). Since H is a proper
subgraph of G, the process continues. We seek an edge joining a vertex of H and a vertex not
belonging to H. One such edge is v3u1 and a cycle containing this edge is
C′ = (v3, u1, u2, u3, u4, u5, u7, u6, v4, v3).
Direct the edges of C′ cyclically about C′, except for the edge v4v3, which has already been directed
as (v3, v4). We also direct the edges u1u4 and u2u5 arbitrarily. This results in a strong orientation
D of G (shown in Figure 15.9(c)).

Figure 15.9: A graph with a strong orientation
As with graphs, it is important to know when two digraphs are the same. Two digraphs D1
and D2 are isomorphic if there exists a one-to-one correspondence φ : V (D1) →V (D2) such that
(u1, v1) ∈E(D1) if and only if (φ(u1), φ(v1)) ∈E(D2). As with isomorphic graphs, two isomorphic
digraphs have the same order and same size. Furthermore, the outdegrees (and indegrees) of the
vertices of two isomorphic digraphs are the same.
For example, Figure 15.10 shows the two orientations of the 3-cycle C3 and the four orientations
of C4. Of these orientations, only D′ and D1 are strong. Observe that the digraphs D2 and D3
of Figure 15.10 have order 4 and size 4. Also, D2 and D3 have two vertices having indegree 1
and outdegree 1, one vertex with indegree 0 and outdegree 2 and one vertex with indegree 2 and
outdegree 0. Despite having the same order, same size and the same indegrees and outdegrees of
their vertices, the digraphs D2 and D3 are not isomorphic. For example, D2 contains a directed
path of length 3 while D3 does not.

strong subdigraph of D of largest order?
15.2
Tournaments
There are sporting events involving a number of teams or individuals which require every two teams
or individuals to compete against each other exactly once. This is referred to as a round robin
tournament. Men’s soccer has been part of the Summer Olympic Games since 1900. Teams from
16 countries participate, divided into four pools of four teams each. In each pool, a round robin
tournament takes place, in which the top two teams in each pool advance to play for Olympic medals.
This also occurs during the World Cup for soccer supremacy when 32 countries participate, divided
into eight pools of four teams each.
Round robin tournaments can be modeled by a class of digraphs, which are also called tourna-
ments. The vertex set of the tournament (digraph) is the set of teams and there is a directed edge
from vertex s to vertex t if team s defeats team t in the round robin tournament. In this case no
ties are permitted. The formal deﬁnition of a tournament is stated next.
Deﬁnition 15.7
A tournament is an oriented complete graph.
Consequently, a tournament is a digraph D with the property that if u and v are any two
vertices of D, then exactly one of (u, v) and (v, u) is a directed edge of D. The following theorem is
a consequence of the First Theorem of Digraph Theory (see Theorem 15.3).

The digraphs D1 and D2 of Figure 15.14 are tournaments. The digraph D3 is not a tournament
since neither (v3, w3) nor (w3, v3) is a directed edge of D3; while the digraph D4 is not a tournament
either since both (u4, w4) and (w4, u4) are directed edges.

Example 15.10
Suppose that four teams t1, t2, t2, t4 are participating in a round robin tournament, where t1 has
defeated the other three teams and t2 has defeated t3 which has defeated t4 which has defeated t2.
Then this situation can be modeled by the tournament T of Figure 15.15.

Figure 15.15: A model of the round robin tournament in Example 15.10
Observe that the number of games that a team ti (1 ≤i ≤4) wins is its outdegree. Since t1 has
won all three games it has played, od t1 = 3.
♦
Transitive Tournaments
While it is clear that t1 is the best team (among the four teams in Example 15.10), it is impossible
to tell which is the next best team as each of the three remaining teams has won exactly one game.
One might argue that t2 is better than t3 since t2 defeated t3. However, by the the same argument,
t3 is better than t4 and t4 is better than t2. In fact, as we shall see, the only situation in which there
is a clear ranking of all teams is when no two teams have won the same number of games. This
brings us to a special class of tournaments.
A tournament T is called a transitive tournament if whenever (u, v) and (v, w) are arcs of T ,
then (u, w) is an arc of T as well (see Figure 15.16).

Theorem 15.11
A tournament T is transitive if and only if no two vertices of T have the same
outdegree.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that T is a tournament of order n in which no two vertices of T have the same
outdegree. Since 0 ≤od v ≤n −1 for every vertex v of T , it follows that there is exactly one vertex
of outdegree k for every integer k with 0 ≤k ≤n −1. We may assume that V (T ) = {v1, v2, . . .,
vn}, where od vi = n −i for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Since od v1 = n −1, it follows that v1 is adjacent to vi
for i = 2, 3, . . . , n. Since od v2 = n −2 and v2 is adjacent from v1, it follows that v2 is adjacent to
vi for i = 3, 4, . . ., n. Continuing in this manner, we see that each vertex vt (1 ≤t ≤n) is adjacent
only to those vertices vi with t < i ≤n. We now show that T is transitive. Suppose that u, v and
w are vertices of T such that (u, v) and (v, w) are arcs of T . Then u = vi, v = vj and w = vk for
some integers i, j, k with 1 ≤i < j < k ≤n. However, since i < k, it follows that (vi, vk) is an arc
of T and so (u, w) is an arc of T . Thus T is transitive.
We now verify the converse. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a transitive tournament
T containing two vertices u and v with the same outdegree, say od u = od v = k. Since T is a
tournament, either (u, v) or (v, u) is an arc of T , say (u, v) is an arc of T . Since od v = k, there is
a set S of k vertices to which v is adjacent. Let w ∈S. So (v, w) is an arc of T . However, (u, v)
is an arc of T and T is transitive; so (u, w) is an arc of T . Therefore, u is also adjacent to every
vertex of S (see Figure 15.18). Since (u, v) is an arc of T , it follows that od u ≥k + 1, which is a
contradiction.

CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
By the proof of Theorem 15.11, a transitive tournament T with vertex set V (T ) = {v1, v2, . . .,
vn} can be constructed by placing the vertices of T in order in a column with v1 on the top and vn
on the bottom so that all arcs are directed downward. Perhaps it is now clear that there is only one
transitive tournament of each order.
Example 15.12
A transitive tournament T of order 6 is shown in Figure 15.19. If the vertices v1, v2, . . ., v6 represent
teams, then v1 is the best team as it has defeated all other teams, v2 is the next best team as it
has defeated all other teams except v1 and so on. In other words, there is a clear ranking of all six
teams.

Figure 15.19: The transitive tournament of order 6 in Example 15.12
Recall that a digraph D is strong if for every two vertices u and v, there is both a directed u −v
path and a directed v −u path in D. Necessarily, no transitive tournament is strong.
Example 15.13
There are two non-isomorphic tournaments D1 and D2 of order 3. These are shown in Figure 15.20.
The tournament D1 is transitive and D2 is strong. There are four non-isomorphic tournaments of
order 4, namely T1, T2, T3 and T4 of Figure 15.20. While T1 is transitive and T2 is strong, T3 and T4
are neither. There are 12 non-isomorphic tournaments of order 5 and over 154 billion non-isomorphic
tournaments of order 12.
♦
We now make some observations about the tournaments in Figure 15.20. The transitive tourna-
ments D1 and T1 contain no directed cycles. The strong tournament D2 has a directed 3-cycle, while
the strong tournament T2 has a directed 3-cycle and a directed 4-cycle. Each of the tournaments
T3 and T4 has a directed 3-cycle but no directed 4-cycle. As the observations above suggest, only
transitive tournaments have no directed cycles.
Theorem 15.14
A tournament T is transitive if and only if T has no directed cycles.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that T is a tournament that contains no directed cycles. We show that T is
transitive. Let (u, v) and (v, w) be two arcs of T . Since T contains no directed cycles, T cannot
contain the arc (w, u). Thus (u, w) is an arc of T and so T is transitive.
We use a proof by contradiction to verify the converse: If T is a transitive tournament, then T has
no directed cycles. Suppose that this statement is false. Then there exists a transitive tournament
T that contains a directed cycle C, say
C = (v1, v2, . . . , vk, v1)

Figure 15.20: The tournaments of order 3 and 4 in Example 15.13
(See Figure 15.21(a)). Since v1 is adjacent to v2 and adjacent from vk, there is a vertex vi (1 ≤i ≤
k −1) such that v1 is adjacent to vi but adjacent from vi+1 (see Figure 15.21(b)). Hence T contains
the directed 3-cycle (v1, vi, vi+1, v1). However, (v1, vi) and (vi, vi+1) are arcs of T but (v1, vi+1) is
not an arc of T . This contradicts the assumption that T is transitive.

Figure 15.21: A step in the proof of Theorem 15.14
As we have seen, if T is a transitive tournament of order n, then there is a unique vertex u of T
having outdegree n −1, which is certainly the maximum outdegree of any vertex of T . Therefore,
u is adjacent to all other vertices of T and so ⃗d(u, v) ≤1 for every vertex v of T . This is a special
case of the following result.
Theorem 15.15
Let u be a vertex of maximum outdegree in a tournament T . For every vertex v
of T , ⃗d(u, v) ≤2.

572
CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
Proof. Suppose that od(u) = k and that u1, u2, . . . , uk are the k vertices of T that are adjacent from
u. Then ⃗d(u, ui) = 1 for 1 ≤i ≤k. Let v be a vertex of T such that (v, u) is a directed edge of T .
Since od(v) ≤od(u), the vertex v cannot be adjacent to all of the vertices u1, u2, . . . , uk. Therefore,
(uj, v) is a directed edge of T for some j with 1 ≤j ≤k. Thus P = (u, uj, v) is a directed u −v
path of length 2 and so ⃗d(u, v) = 2.
Suppose that we have a collection of teams involved in a round robin tournament and the results
of the matches in this round robin tournament are modeled by a tournament T . Then the outdegree
of a vertex in T is the number of matches won by this team. Let A be a team that has won the
greatest number of matches. According to Theorem 15.15, if B is any other team, then either A
defeated B or A defeated a team that defeated B.
Hamiltonian Tournaments
Deﬁnition 15.16
A Hamiltonian path in a digraph D is a directed path that contains every
vertex of D, while a Hamiltonian cycle in D is a directed cycle that contains every vertex of D.
A digraph D is Hamiltonian if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
While it is easy to give an example of a tournament containing a Hamiltonian path, it is impossible
to give an example of a tournament that does not contain a Hamiltonian path.
Theorem 15.17
Every tournament contains a Hamiltonian path.
Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a tournament T , of order n say, that contains no
Hamiltonian path. Let P = (v1, v2, . . . , vk) be a directed path of greatest length in T . Necessarily,
k < n. Hence there exists a vertex v of T that does not lie on P. Since T is a tournament, there
is an arc between v and each vertex vi (1 ≤i ≤k) of P. Since P is a longest path in T , the arcs
(v, v1) and (vk, v) do not belong to T , for otherwise, a longer path exists. Therefore, both (v1, v)
and (v, vk) are arcs of T . (see Figure 15.22(a)).

We have already observed that the strong tournaments of orders 3 and 4 are Hamiltonian. This
is true of every strong tournament. Although it is not diﬃcult to show that every Hamiltonian
tournament is strong (see Exercise 13), it is a bit challenging to verify the converse. For this reason,
we omit the proof of the following result.
Theorem 15.18
A nontrivial tournament T is Hamiltonian if and only if T is strong.

Finite-State Machines
There is an ever-increasing number of input-output devices. For example,
(1) pushing a sequence of numerical buttons followed by another button (talk) on your cell phone
allows you to contact a person at another phone number;
(2) typing in information at a web site and clicking on ‘order complete’ allows us to order some
merchandise over the internet or to make a reservation for a ﬂight to some location;
(3) placing coins in a vending machine permits us to lift the handle to an enclosure and remove a
newspaper.
Indeed, a computer is an input-output device. Here, some sort of information is input, which is
processed, resulting in an output of some type.
The computer must be able to remember past
information as it works its way through the input. Devices such as these can be modeled by an
abstract structure called a ﬁnite-state machine or a sequential circuit.
As the term suggests, a
ﬁnite-state machine has a ﬁnite number of internal states and at each state, the machine has certain
information to remember. Before proceeding further with this concept, we give a simple example of
a ﬁnite-state machine – one involving a vending machine.

15.3. FINITE-STATE MACHINES

Example 15.19
A motel has a laundry room where guests can wash and dry their clothes. There is a vending machine
that dispenses small bottles of laundry detergent and small bottles of fabric softener, each bottle
costing 75¢. The machine accepts quarters and half-dollars only and returns the change if more than
75¢ is deposited. After returning to the motel at the end of the day, Kevin decides to wash a load
of T -shirts. He has no laundry detergent and so decides to use the vending machine to purchase
a bottle of laundry detergent. Kevin inserts three quarters into the vending machine. A button
labeled LD (laundry detergent) is then pushed. What happens when Kevin purchases the laundry
detergent from the vending machine is shown in the table below at various times t0, t1, t2, t3, t4,
where t0 < t1 < t2 < t3 < t4 and t0 is the starting time of this procedure.

The state s0 is the initial state, where the machine is prepared for a guest to insert a quarter
or half-dollar or push the LD or FS (fabric softener) button. At time t0, Kevin deposits a quarter
and nothing is output. Shortly afterwards then (at time t1), the machine is at state s1. At state s1,
the machine remembers that 25¢ has already been deposited. Another quarter is then deposited.
Again nothing is dispensed. At this point (at time t2), the machine is at state s2. At state s2, the
machine remembers that 50¢ has already been deposited. Another quarter is deposited. Again there
is no output. Now (at time t3), the machine is at state s3, where the machine remembers that 75¢
has already been deposited and that this is the correct amount needed to dispense either of the two
products. The LD button is then pushed and a bottle of detergent is released. Soon afterwards, at
time t4, the machine is reset to state s0. When the next guest chooses to use this vending machine,
the machine is at time t0 and state s0 and the process repeats itself.
As we mentioned, there are two buttons that can be pushed and the machine will dispense a
bottle of detergent or a bottle of fabric softener provided suﬃcient money has been deposited but
does nothing otherwise. That is, if less than 75¢ has been deposited and either button is pushed,
then there is no output and the machine remains at its current state. On the other hand, if 75¢
has been deposited, then the machine releases a bottle of detergent or softener (depending on which
button is pushed) and the machine is returned to the state s0 (nothing deposited). If
$1 has been
deposited (either two half-dollars or two quarters followed by a half-dollar), then the machine returns
25¢ in change immediately. Thus 75¢ has been deposited. The actions of this vending machine can
be modeled by a ﬁnite-state machine. This ﬁnite-state machine can be represented in two ways.
One way is by a digraph or diagram (see Figure 15.23), called the state digraph of the ﬁnite-state
machine. Here LD represents the laundry detergent button, FS the fabric softener button and N
indicates no output. For example, there is an arc from state s0 to state s1 labeled 25, N. This means
that if we deposit 25¢ at state s0, then the state changes to s1 but no output is produced. There is
an arc from state s3 to state s0 labeled FS, softener. This means that if we were to push the fabric
softener button at state s3, then we receive a bottle of fabric softener and the machine returns to
state s0. The directed loop at s3 labeled 50, 50 indicates that if we deposit 50¢ at state s3, then 50¢
is returned and the machine remains at state s3.
♦
We now look at ﬁnite-state machines in general. Among the features of a ﬁnite-state machine
are the following:
(1) The machine can be in only one of ﬁnitely many states at any time. These are the internal
states of the machine.
(2) The machine can accept as input only a ﬁnite number of input values, the entire collection
of which is called the input set or input alphabet (denoted by I). Only these input values are
recognized by the machine at each internal state.

(3) An output and next state are determined by each state-input pair. The set of all possible
outputs is ﬁnite and is denoted by O. The set O is called the output set of the machine.
(4) We assume that the machine operates in a deterministic manner, where the output is deter-
mined by a sequence of input values and the initial state of the machine.
More formally, a ﬁnite-state machine consists of
(1) a ﬁnite set S of internal states,
(2) a ﬁnite input set I,
(3) a ﬁnite output set O,
(4) a next-state (or transition) function f : S × I →S,
(5) an output function g : S × I →O.
Consequently, if the machine is in a certain state s at a particular time and i ∈I is input, then g(s, i)
is output and there is a transition of the machine to the internal state f(s, i). When the ﬁnite-state
machine receives its ﬁrst input, we assume that the machine is in a speciﬁed starting state, often
denoted by s0.
The states and functions described above can be represented by a diagram called a state dia-
gram. Since the diagram is actually a digraph (possibly with parallel arcs and directed loops), it is
also called the state digraph or transition digraph of the ﬁnite-state machine. The vertex set
of this digraph is then the set S. If f(si, a) = sj and g(si, a) = b, then this is represented in the
digraph by drawing a directed edge (arc) labeled a, b from vertex si to vertex sj (see Figure 15.24).
If there is more than one arc from si to sj, then these arcs can be replaced by a single arc with
multiple labels.

Since the sets S, I and O are ﬁnite, the next-state function f and output function g can also
be described by means of a table, commonly called the state table or transition table of the

15.3. FINITE-STATE MACHINES
577
machine. For example, the ﬁnite-state machine modeling the vending machine in Example 15.19 can
be represented by its state table, which gives the values of the transition function f and the output
function g for all state-input pairs. In this case, there are four possible input values, namely (1)
deposit 25¢, (2) deposit 50¢, (3) push the laundry detergent button (LD) and (4) push the fabric
softener button (FS). The state table for the ﬁnite-state machine in Example 15.19 is given below.

Solution.
The state digraph for this machine is given in Figure 15.25. For example, since f(s0, 0) =
s1 and g(s0, 0) = 0, there is an arc labeled 0, 0 from s0 to s1. Because f(s4, 1) = s0 and g(s4, 1) = 0,
there is an arc labeled 1, 0 from s4 to s0. Also, f(s2, 0) = s2 and g(s2, 0) = 1 and so there is a
directed loop at s2 labeled 0, 1.

Since there is an arc from s0 to s1 labeled 0, 0 and an arc from s0 to s3 labeled 1, 1,
it follows that f(s0, 0) = s1, f(s0, 1) = s3, g(s0, 0) = 0 and g(s0, 1) = 1. Continuing in this fashion,
we obtain the state table shown below for this ﬁnite-state machine.

When dealing with ﬁnite-state machines, we are often interested in sequences of inputs. Such a
sequence is referred to as an input string. An input string takes us from the starting state through
a sequence of states, as determined by the transition function. Each input string also produces an
output string. For the vending machine in Example 15.19, any of the following input strings places
us at state s3, where we can obtain a bottle of detergent or a bottle of fabric softener by pushing
an appropriate button:
(i) 50, 25; (ii) 25, 50; (iii) 25, 25, 25; (iv) 50, 50; (v) 25, 25, 50.
In a ﬁnite-state machine, it is often the case that we wish to arrive at some state or states with an
appropriate input string. Each such state is called an accepting state. We now consider an input
string for the ﬁnite-state machine described in Example 15.21.
Example 15.22
For the ﬁnite-state machine in Figure 15.26 with starting state s0, ﬁnd the output string and sequence
of states obtained from the input string 1001101.
Solution.
From the state digraph of this ﬁnite-state machine in Figure 15.26 (or from its state table
in Example 15.21), we see that f(s0, 1) = s3 and g(s0, 1) = 1; f(s3, 0) = s0 and g(s3, 0) = 1; and
f(s0, 0) = s1 and g(s0, 0) = 0. Continuing in this way, we obtain the successive states and outputs
as shown in the table below. Thus the output string is 1100111 and the resulting sequence of states
is s0, s3, s0, s1, s0, s3, s0, s3. This produces the directed s0 −s3 walk (s0, s3, s0, s1, s0, s3, s0, s3) in the
state digraph.

We now describe a ﬁnite-state machine that computes the sum of two positive integers expressed
in base 2. Such a ﬁnite-state machine is commonly called a binary adder.

15.3. FINITE-STATE MACHINES
579
Example 15.23
Let a and b be two integers expressed in base 2, say a = a5a4a3a2a1a0 = 011011 and b =
b5b4b3b2b1b0 = 001110, where for 0 ≤i ≤5, ai and bi represent the coeﬃcient of 2i in a and b,
respectively. Therefore, a = (011011)2 = 27 and b = (001110)2 = 14.
The initial bit 0 in the expansion of a and the initial two 0s in the expansion of b are present
to have an equal number of bits in a and b and to aid us in computing the sum. Hence we wish to
compute a + b = c = (c5c4c3c2c1c0)2.
Let’s see how this addition is carried out, bit by bit, from right to left.

In the ﬁrst addition, 1 + 0 = 1. In the second addition, we add 1 + 1, which is 2 (in decimal) and
10 (in binary). So we write down the 0 and carry 1 to the next column, getting 1 + 0 + 1, which
again is 10 in binary. Completing this sum, we obtain c = (101001)2 = 41. In the ﬁrst addition,
when computing a + b for any two integers a and b expressed in base 2, we add the two bits a0 and
b0, write down 0 if we are adding 0 + 0 or 1 + 1 or write down 1 if we are adding 1 + 0 or 0 + 1.
If a0 = b0 = 1, then we carry 1 over to the second addition; otherwise we can assume that we are
carrying 0 over to the next addition. If we are adding ai + bi (i ≥1), then we proceed in the same
manner except we also need to add to ai + bi the bit carried over from the preceding addition.
We now decribe how such an addition can be done by a ﬁnite-state machine M. The set S of
internel states of M is S = {s0, s1}, where s0 is the state in which 0 is carried over to the next
addition and s1 is the state in which 1 is carried over to the next addition. That is, for i = 0, 1, si
is the state in which i is carried over to the next addition. The only possible additions of bits are
0 + 0, 0 + 1, 1 + 0 and 1 + 1. We indicate this by letting I = {00, 01, 10, 11}. When two (or three)
bits are added, we either write down 0 or 1. This is indicated by letting O = {0, 1}. In each case,
either 0 or 1 is carried over to the next addition. This is indicated by a transition to a new state.
The state table of this ﬁnite-state machine is shown below.

From this table, we see that f(s1, 10) = s1 and g(s1, 10) = 0. What this says is that the machine
is at the state s1 and that 10 has been input. Since the machine is at state s1, the bit 1 has been
carried over from the preceding addition. The input 10 tells us that are now adding 1 + 0. However,
since 1 has been carried over, we are actually adding 1 + 1 + 0, which is 2 in decimal or 10 in binary.
Therefore, 0 is written down (which is the output) and 1 is carried over to the next addition, placing
us in state s1. The state digraph for this ﬁnite-state machine is shown in Figure 15.27.

Since computing a and b deals with adding a0 + b0, a1 + b1, . . ., a5 + b5, in this order, we are
dealing with the input string
10, 11, 01, 11, 10, 00.

CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
This produces the sequence
s0, s0, s1, s1, s1, s1, s0
of states and the output string
1 0 0 1 0 1.
Since these are the coeﬁcients c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 of 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, respectively, of the sum c of
a and b, it follows that c = (101001)2 = 41.
♦
Finite-State Automata
There are also ﬁnite-state machines that produce no output. These are called ﬁnite-state au-
tomata. The singular of automata is automaton. More formally, a ﬁnite-state automaton con-
sists of
(1) a ﬁnite set S of states,
(2) a ﬁnite set I of input values,
(3) a transition function f that associates a next state with each state-input pair.
For example, a ﬁnite-state automaton might model the road network of a town (see Figure 15.28).
Suppose that the states are the entrances to various street intersections and the input values are
turn left and drive one block (ℓ), turn right and drive one block (r) and go straight ahead for one
block (s). Whichever state one is in, applying one of the input values will lead us to a new state. An
input string, such as rssℓssℓ(turn right and drive one block, go straight for two blocks, turn left
and drive one block, go straight for two blocks, turn left and drive one block) provides directions
on how to drive from a given state (location in this case) to another state (our destination). This is
illustrated in the diagram shown in Figure 15.28.

Here too, there are two common methods used to describe a ﬁnite-state automaton. One of
these uses a table called a state table, while the second uses a digraph (or diagram ) called a state
digraph.
Example 15.24
The state digraph of a ﬁnite-state automaton A is shown in Figure 15.29. Thus the states of A are
s0, s1, s2, s3 and the input values of A are 1, 2, 3.
(a) For the transition function f, determine f(s2, i) for i = 1, 2, 3.
(b) Determine the state table for A.

Solution.
(a) Since there is an arc labeled 1 from s2 to s3, an arc labeled 2 from s2 to s1 and a directed loop
labeled 3 at s2, it follows that f(s2, 1) = s3, f(s2, 2) = s1 and f(s2, 3) = s2.
(b) First, consider the starting state s0. Since there is an arc labeled i from s0 to si for 1 ≤i ≤3,
it follows that f(s0, i) = si. Next, consider the arcs incident with state s1. There is an arc
labeled 1 from s1 to s2, an arc labeled 2 from s1 to s3 and a directed loop labeled 3 at s1.
Thus f(s1, 1) = s2, f(s1, 2) = s3 and f(s1, 3) = s1. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain the
state table for A given below.

The state digraph for this machine is given in Figure 15.30. For example, consider the
arcs incident with state s0. Since f(s0, a) = s2, f(s0, b) = s1 and f(s0, c) = s3, there is an arc
labeled a from s0 to s2, an arc labeled b from s0 to s1 and an arc labeled c from s0 to s3. On the
other hand, f(s1, a) = s0 and f(s2, c) = s0. Thus there is an arc labeled a from s1 to s0 and an arc
labeled c from s2 to s0.

In the following example, there is a clear initial state and a unique accepting state.

A man has a 6-ounce bottle of medicine. He is directed to take 3 ounces of the medicine in the
morning and the remaining 3 ounces at bedtime; however, the bottle has no markings on it. The

man does possess two empty bottles – one with a capacity of 5 ounces and the other with a capacity
of 1 ounce, but neither of these has markings either. It is possible to obtain two bottles containing
3 ounces of medicine each by a sequence of pourings. Draw the state digraph of the resulting ﬁnite-
state automaton. Find a sequence of pourings that will result in two bottles that each contains 3

distinct integers a and b with 1 ≤a, b ≤3, the label ab on an arc indicates that the contents of
bottle a is poured into bottle b, either until bottle b is ﬁlled or until bottle a is empty. If at a
certain state, bottle a is empty or bottle b is ﬁlled, then no arc leaving that state will be labeled ab.
Each vertex (state) is labeled as (x1, x2, x3) if bottle i contains xi ounces of medicine for i = 1, 2, 3.
Thus x1 + x2 + x3 = 6. The initial state is the vertex labeled (6, 0, 0). The accepting state is the
vertex labeled (3, 3, 0). The state digraph of this ﬁnite-state automaton is shown in Figure 15.31.
One sequence of pourings that results in two bottles containing 3 ounces of medicine is 12, 23, 31,
23, 31.

The Road Coloring Problem
There is a curious problem concerning ﬁnite-state automata called the Road Coloring Problem.
Suppose that a certain ﬁnite-state automaton has n states and the input set consists of d input
values. Then, for each state s, applying one of the d input values to s leads us to a new state s′.
Thus the resulting state digraph has order n and every vertex has outdegree d.
If the vertices of a digraph D have the same outdegree, then D is said to be out-regular or to
have uniform outdegree. Recall that a digraph D is strong (or strongly connected) if for every
two vertices u and v of D, there are both a directed u −v path and a directed v −u path. A digraph
D is periodic if there is a partition {V1, V2, . . . , Vk}, k ≥2, of the vertex set V (D) of D such that
for every arc (u, v) of D, it follows that u ∈Vi and v ∈Vi+1 for some i with 1 ≤i ≤k, where
Vk+1 = V1. A digraph D is aperiodic if it is not periodic. A digraph D is aperiodic if and only if
the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its directed cycles is 1.
Suppose, for example, that we have a ﬁnite-state automaton A with 8 states, where, this time,
we denote the states by s1, s2, . . . , s8. In this instance, we have two input values, which we denote
by r and b. The state digraph D of A is shown in Figure 15.32. Since A has two input values,
every vertex of D has outdegree 2, that is, D is out-regular (or has uniform outdegree). Since D has
directed cycles of length 3 and 4, it follows that D is aperiodic.

Figure 15.32: The state digraph for a ﬁnite-state automaton:
A strong aperiodic digraph with uniform outdegree
Suppose that we were to consider the input string
brrbrrbrr
(15.1)
and we apply this with s5, say, chosen as the initial state. If f denotes the transition function, then
f(s5, b) = s6. That is, the input value b changes the state s5 to s6; so we are now at the state s6.
Since f(s6, r) = s1, the state s6 changes to s1. Because f(s1, r) = s2, f(s2, b) = s7 and so on, we
arrive at the following directed walk:
(s5, s6, s1, s2, s7, s3, s8, s7, s3, s8).
That is, the input string (15.1) results in a directed s5 −s8 walk. Next, suppose that we apply the
same input string with the initial state s4, say. This results in the directed walk
(s4, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s8, s7, s3, s8).
In this case, the ﬁnal state is s8 once again. In fact, if we were to apply the same input string with
any state chosen as the initial state, the ﬁnal state would always be s8.
Let us now explain what the input values r and b are meant to designate. These represent colors,
namely red and blue, while the states s1, s2, . . . , s8 represent locations. The arcs represent one-way

584
CHAPTER 15. DIRECTED GRAPHS
roads. An arc labeled r is a red road and an arc labeled b is a blue road. Hence if we were to start
at the location s5 and take the blue road, this would lead us to s6. If we then take the red road
(from s6), then we would be led to the location s1. Taking the red road out of s1 moves us to s2
and so on. Indeed, the string (15.1) can be interpreted as driving directions. Following the driving
directions (15.1), we can drive to s8, regardless of where we begin out trip. Therefore, if we wanted
directions on how to drive to s8, the input string (15.1) serves as driving directions – and it is not
necessary to know where we are currently located.
Suppose, however, that we were to consider the new input string
bbrbbrbbr
(15.2)
and apply this, once again using s5 as the initial state. In this case, we obtain the directed walk
(s5, s6, s2, s3, s4, s1, s2, s7, s6, s1).
Hence a directed s5 −s1 walk is obtained in this case. If we apply the input string (15.2) with the
initial state s6, say, we obtain the directed walk
(s6, s2, s7, s3, s4, s1, s2, s7, s6, s1).
So in this case as well, s1 is the ﬁnal state of this directed walk. In fact, if we were to apply the
input string (15.2) with any initial state, the ﬁnal state is always s1.
Perhaps surprisingly, if we were to select any state s in V (D), then there is always an input
string (driving directions) such that applying this string to any initial state results in a directed
walk having the ﬁnal state s. Hence the digraph D of Figure 15.32 has a rather unusual property.
As we are about to see, this digraph is not so unusual after all.
Suppose that D is a strong aperiodic digraph with uniform outdegree d. A coloring of the arcs
of D is called a proper coloring if no two arcs leaving the same vertex of D are colored the
same. A proper coloring of D with d colors is a synchronized coloring if for every vertex v of D
there exists a string sv of these colors such that applying this string to each vertex u of D results
in a directed u −v walk. Such a string sv is called a synchronized sequence for v. Thus the
string (15.1) is a synchronized sequence for s8, while the string (15.2) is a synchronized sequence for
s1. In 1970 Benjamin Weiss and Roy Adler conjectured that every strong aperiodic digraph with
uniform outdegree has a synchronized coloring. During the 37 years that followed this conjecture,
the problem became known as the Road Coloring Problem. This problem was solved in 2008 by
Avraham Trahtman.
The Road Coloring Theorem
Every strong aperiodic digraph with uniform outdegree r has a
synchronized coloring with r colors.
Exercises for Section 15.3
1. Construct the state table and state digraph of a ﬁnite-state machine that models a vending
machine in which two cherry cough drops or two lemon cough drops can be purchased for 15¢.
The vending machine accepts nickels and dimes only. If more than 15¢ has been deposited, any
amount over 15¢ is immediately returned. Once 15¢ has been deposited, one of two buttons
(C for cherry and L for lemon) can be pushed to purchase cherry cough drops or lemon cough
drops.
2. Construct the state digraph of a ﬁnite-state machine that models a vending machine in which
a chocolate mint or chocolate cookie can be purchased for 20¢. The vending machine accepts
nickels, dimes and quarters only. Whenever more than 20¢ has been deposited, the amount
over 20¢ is immediately returned. Once 20¢ has been deposited, the customer can push one of
two buttons (M for mint and C for cookie) to purchase either the mint or the cookie. There is
a third button RD, which when pushed returns any money currently deposited.

or you have never had as an instructor. (g) The set A ∪B consists of those members of the
department with whom you have never had a conversation and you have never had as an

13. (a) See Figure 4. (b) First we show that A −B ⊆A ∩B. Let x ∈A −B. Then x ∈A and
x /∈B. Since x /∈B, it follows that x ∈B. Therefore, x ∈A and x ∈B; so x ∈A ∩B. Hence
A −B ⊆A ∩B. Next we show that A ∩B ⊆A −B. Let y ∈A ∩B. Then y ∈A and y ∈B.
Since y ∈B, we have that y /∈B. Now because y ∈A and y /∈B, we conclude that y ∈A−B.
Thus, A ∩B ⊆A −B. Therefore, A −B = A ∩B.

3. Proof. Let x be a real number such that (x−1)2 = 0. Thus x−1 = 0 and so x = 1. Therefore,
x3 −1 = 13 −1 = 0.
5. Proof. Assume that (x −2)4 ≤0. Since (x −2)4 ≥0, it follows that (x −2)4 = 0 and so
x −2 = 0. Hence x = 2. Therefore, 9 −x2 = 9 −22 = 5 ≥0.
7. Proof. Let n be an even integer. So n = 2k for some integer k. Then 7n −2 = 7(2k) −2 =
14k −2 = 2(7k −1). Since 7k −1 is an integer, 7n −2 is even.
9. Proof. Let n be an odd integer. Therefore, n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then

=
28k2 + 28k + 7 −4k −2 + 15 = 28k2 + 24k + 20 = 2(14k2 + 12k + 10).
Since 14k2 + 12k + 10 is an integer, 7n2 −2n + 15 is even.

13. Proof. Let r and s be rational numbers. Then r = a/b and s = c/d, where a, b, c, d ∈Z and
b, d ̸= 0. Therefore 5r + 7s = 5a
b + 7c
d = 5ad+7bc
bd
. Since 5ad + 7bc and bd are integers and
bd ̸= 0, the number 5r + 7s is rational.
15. Proof. Let r and s be rational numbers. Then r = a/b and s = c/d, where a, b, c, d ∈Z and
b, d ̸= 0. Therefore rs = a
b · c
d = ac
bd. Since ac and bd are integers and bd ̸= 0, the number rs is

P ∨Q is true.

(b) Yes by (a). (c) No. (d) No.
Section 3.3
1. Proof. Assume that n is an odd integer. Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. So 5n + 7 =
5(2k + 1) + 7 = 10k + 12 = 2(5k + 6). Since 5k + 6 is an integer, 5n + 7 is even.
3. Proof. Assume that n is an even integer in S = {1, 2, 3}. Then n = 2. Thus 3n+4 = 3·2+4 =
10 is even.
5. Proof. First, we prove that if n is an even integer, then n3 is even. Assume that n is even. Then
n = 2k for some integer k. So n3 = (2k)3 = 8k3 = 2(4k3). Since 4k3 is an integer, n3 is even.
Next, we verify the converse, namely if n3 is even, then n is even. Let n be an odd integer. Then
n = 2ℓ+1 for some integer ℓ. Thus n3 = (2ℓ+1)3 = 8ℓ3 +12ℓ2 +6ℓ+1 = 2(4ℓ3 +6ℓ2 +3ℓ)+1.
Since 4ℓ3 + 6ℓ2 + 3ℓis an integer, n3 is odd.
7. Proof. First, we prove that if 2n2−n−1 = 0, then 3n2−n−2 = 0. Suppose that 2n2−n−1 = 0.
Since 2n2 −n −1 = (2n + 1)(n −1) = 0 and n is an integer, n = 1 and so 3n2 −n −2 =
3·12 −1−2 = 0. Next, we verify the converse; that is, if 3n2 −n−2 = 0, then 2n2 −n−1 = 0.
Suppose that 3n2 −n −2 = 0. Since 3n2 −n −2 = (3n + 2)(n −1) = 0 and n is an integer, it
follows that n = 1 and so 2n2 −n −1 = 2 · 12 −1 −1 = 0.
9. Proof. Assume that x ≥0. Then x3 + 5x + 1 ≥03 + 5 · 0 + 1 = 1 > 0.
11. Proof. Assume that x < 1 and y < 1. Since x and y are integers, it follows that x ≤0 and
y ≤0. Thus 2x + 3y ≤2 · 0 + 3 · 0 = 0 < 1.
13. Proof. Suppose that a ≤2, b ≤1 and c ≤0. Thus c = 0 and a + 2b + 3c = a + 2b ≤2 + 2 · 1 =
4 < 5.
Section 3.4
1. Proof. Let n be an integer. We consider two cases.
Case 1. n is even. Then n = 2a for some integer a. Therefore, n2−3n+5 = (2a)2−3(2a)+5 =
4a2 −6a + 5 = 2(2a2 −3a + 2) + 1. Since 2a2 −3a + 2 is an integer, n2 −3n + 5 is odd.
Case 2. n is odd. Then n = 2b + 1 for some integer b. Therefore,
n2 −3n + 5
=
(2b + 1)2 −3(2b + 1) + 5 = (4b2 + 4b + 1) −6b −3 + 5
=
4b2 −2b + 3 = 2(2b2 −b + 1) + 1.
Since 2b2 −b + 1 is an integer, n2 −3n + 5 is odd.

5. (a) Proof. Assume that m and n are of the same parity. We consider two cases.
Case 1. m and n are even. Therefore, m = 2a and n = 2b for integers a and b. So m + n =
(2a) + (2b) = 2(a + b). Since a + b is an integer, m + n is even.
Case 2. m and n are odd. Therefore, m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b + 1 for integers a and b. So
m + n = (2a + 1) + (2b + 1) = 2(a + b + 1). Since a + b + 1 is an integer, m + n is even.
For the converse, assume that m and n are of opposite parity, say m is even and n is odd.
Then m = 2x and n = 2y + 1 for integers x and y. Thus m + n = 2x + (2y + 1) = 2(x + y) + 1.
Since x + y is an integer, m + n is odd.
(b) Proof. First, observe that there are six pairs of integers of S, namely, {a, b}, {a, c}, {a, d},
{b, c}, {b, d} and {c, d}. Thus m + n = 6, which is even. By (a), m and n are of the same
parity.
7. We ﬁrst show that if m and n are of opposite parity, then 7m + 3n is odd. We consider two
cases.
Case 1. m is odd and n is even. Therefore, m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b for integers a and b. So
7m+3n = 7(2a+1)+3(2b) = 14a+7 +6b = 2(7a+3b+3)+1. Since 7a+3b+3 is an integer,
7m + 3n is odd.
Case 2. m is even and n is odd. (The proof is similar to Case 1.)
Next, we show that if 7m + 3n is odd, then m and n are of opposite parity. We use a proof by
contrapositive. Assume that m and n are of the same parity. We consider two cases.
Case 1. m and n are even. Case 2. m and n are odd.
9. First, we show that if m and n are odd, then mn2 is odd. Let m and n be odd integers. Thus
m = 2a + 1 and n = 2b + 1 for integers a and b. Therefore,
mn2
=
(2a + 1)(2b + 1)2 = (2a + 1)(4b2 + 4b + 1)
=
8ab2 + 8ab + 2a + 4b2 + 4b + 1 = 2(4ab2 + 4ab + a + 2b2 + 2b) + 1.
Since 4ab2 + 4ab + a + 2b2 + 2b is an integer, mn2 is odd. Next, we verify the converse, that
is, if mn2 is odd, then m and n are odd. Assume that m or n is even. We consider two cases.
Case 1. m is even and Case 2. n is even
11. (a) Proof. Assume that |2n −1| ≤5. Then −5 ≤2n −1 ≤5. Therefore, −4 ≤2n ≤6.
Dividing by 2, we have −2 ≤n ≤3.
(b) Proof. Assume that n > 3 or n < −2. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. n > 3. Then |2n −1| = 2n −1 > 5.
Case 2. n < −2. Then |2n −1| = −(2n −1) = −2n + 1 > 5.
13. Proof. First, we show that (A −B) ∪(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∩C). Let x ∈(A −B) ∪(A −C).
Then x ∈A −B or x ∈A −C. Assume, without loss of generality, that x ∈A −B. Then
x ∈A and x /∈B. Since x /∈B, it follows that x /∈B ∩C. Because x ∈A and x /∈B ∩C, we
have x ∈A −(B ∩C). Hence (A −B) ∪(A −C) ⊆A −(B ∩C).
Next, we show that A −(B ∩C) ⊆(A −B) ∪(A −C). Let y ∈A −(B ∩C). Hence y ∈A
and y /∈B ∩C. Since y /∈B ∩C, either y /∈B or y /∈C. Assume, without loss of generality,
that y /∈B. Since y ∈A, we have y ∈A −B. Therefore, y ∈(A −B) ∪(A −C) and so
A −(B ∩C) ⊆(A −B) ∪(A −C).

15. Proof. First we show that (A−B)∪(B −A) ⊆(A∪B)−(A∩B). Let x ∈(A−B)∪(B −A).
Then x ∈A −B or x ∈B −A. Assume, without loss of generality, that x ∈A −B. So x ∈A
and x /∈B. Thus x ∈A ∪B and x /∈A ∩B. Consequently, x ∈(A ∪B) −(A ∩B). Therefore,
(A −B) ∪(B −A) ⊆(A ∪B) −(A ∩B).
Next we show that (A ∪B) −(A ∩B) ⊆(A −B) ∪(B −A). Let x ∈(A ∪B) −(A ∩B).
Then x ∈A ∪B and x /∈A ∩B. Since x ∈A ∪B, it follows that x ∈A or x ∈B. Without loss
of generality, let x ∈A. Since x /∈A ∩B, it follows that x /∈B. Therefore, x ∈A −B and so
x ∈(A −B) ∪(B −A). Hence (A ∪B) −(A ∩B) ⊆(A −B) ∪(B −A).

2a + 2b = 2(a + b). Since a + b is an integer, 101 is even, which is a contradiction.

5. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exist a rational number a and an irrational number
b such that a −b is rational. Since a and a −b are rational, a = p/q and a −b = x/y, where
p, q, x, y ∈Z and q, y ̸= 0. Therefore, x
y = a −b = p
q −b; so b = p
q −x
y = py−xq
qy
. Since py −xq
and qy are integers and qy ̸= 0, it follows that b is a rational number. This is a contradiction.
7. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a smallest positive irrational number r. Let
s = r/2. Then 0 < s < r. We claim that s is irrational. Suppose that s is rational. Then
s = a/b, where a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0. Hence r = 2s = 2a/b and so r is rational, which is
impossible. Thus, as claimed, s is irrational. This is a contradiction.
9. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that 3n + 14 is and n is also odd. Then n = 2k + 1 for some
integer k. Therefore, 3n + 14 = 3(2k + 1) + 14 = 6k + 17 = 2(3k + 8) + 1. Since 3k + 8 is an
integer, 3n + 14 is odd. This contradicts our assumption that 3n + 14 is even.
11. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that
√
3 is rational. Hence
√
3 = x/y, where x, y ∈Z and
y ̸= 0.
Furthermore, we may assume that x/y has been reduced to lowest terms.
Since
√
3 = x/y, it follows that 3 = x2/y2 and so x2 = 3y2. Since y2 is an integer, x = 3z for some
integer z. Hence (3z)2 = 3y2 and so 9z2 = 3y2. Thus y2 = 3z2. Since z2 is an integer, y = 3w
for some integer w. Since x = 3z and y = 3w for integers z and w, it follows that x/y is not
in lowest terms. This is a contradiction.
13. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that
√
6 is rational. Then
√
6 = a/b for nonzero integers a
and b. We can further assume that a/b has been reduced to lowest terms. Thus 6 = a2/b2; so
a2 = 6b2 = 2(3b2). Because 3b2 is an integer, a2 is even. Thus a is even. So a = 2c, where
c ∈Z. Thus (2c)2 = 6b2 and so 4c2 = 6b2. Therefore, 3b2 = 2c2. Because c2 is an integer,
3b2 is even. Thus either 3 is even or b2 is even. Since 3 is not even, b2 is even and so b is
even. However, since a and b are both even, each has 2 as a divisor, which contradicts our
assumption that a/b has been reduced to lowest terms.
15. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that two of
√
a + b, √a + c and
√
b + c are equal, say

a + b =
√a + c. Squaring both sides, we get a + b = a + c and so b = c, which is a contradiction.

3. First, we show that if m is odd and n is even, then mn+m is odd. Assume that m is odd and n
is even. Then m = 2a+1 and n = 2b for integers a and b. So mn+m = (2a+1)(2b)+(2a+1) =
4ab + 2b + 2a + 1 = 2(2ab + b + a) + 1. Since 2ab + b + a is an integer, mn + m is odd.
Next, we verify the converse, that is, if mn + m is odd, then m is odd and n is even. Assume
that it is not the case that m is odd and n is even. Then either m is even or n is odd. Therefore,
either m is even or m and n are both odd. We consider these two cases.
Case 1. m is even. Case 2. m and n are both odd.
5. Proof. Assume that (x2 −1)2 = 0. Thus x2 −1 = 0. Then x4 −x2 = x2(x2 −1) = x2 ·0 = 0.
7. Proof. Let r and s be rational numbers, where s ̸= 0. Then r = a/b and s = c/d, where
a, b, c, d ∈Z and b, c, d ̸= 0. Then r
s = a/b
c/d = ad
bc . Since ad and bc are integers and bc ̸= 0, it
follows that r/s is rational.
9. Proof. Assume ﬁrst that n is odd. Then n = 2a + 1 for some integer a and so 5n + 1 =
5(2a + 1) + 1 = 10a + 5 + 1 = 10a + 6 = 2(5a + 3). Since 5a + 3 is an integer, 5n + 1 is
even. For the converse, assume that n is even. Then n = 2b for some integer b. Therefore,

11. (a) The integers a = 1 and b = 2 form a counterexample.
(b) The integer x = −1 is a counterexample.
13. (a) Proof. Assume that n is an even integer. Then n = 2k for some integer k. Then 5n −7 =
5(2k) −7 = 10k −7 = 10k −8 + 1 = 2(5k −4) + 1. Since 5k −4 is an integer, 5n −7 is odd.
(b) Proof. Assume that 5n −7 is an even integer. Then 5n −7 = 2k for some integer k. Thus
n = (5n −7) + (−4n + 7) = 2k −4n + 7 = 2(k −2n + 3) + 1. Since k −2n + 3 is an integer, n
is odd.
(c) Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists an even integer n such that 5n −7 is
even. Since n is even, n = 2k for some integer k. Then 5n −7 = 5(2k) −7 = 10k −7 =
10k −8 +1 = 2(5k −4)+1. Since 5k −4 is an integer, 5n−7 is odd, which is a contradiction.
15. (a) Proof. Assume that n is odd.
Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k and so 7 −n =
7 −(2k + 1) = 6 −2k = 2(3 −k). Since 3 −k is an integer, 7 −n is even. For the converse,
assume that 7−n is even and so 7−n = 2ℓfor some integer ℓ. Thus n = 7−2ℓ= 2(3−2ℓ)+1.
Since 3 −2ℓis an integer, n is odd.
(b) Proof. Assume that n is odd. Then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k and so n = 6 −2k =
2(3 −k). Since 3 −k is an integer, 7 −n is even. For the converse, we show that if 7 −n
is even, then n is odd. Assume that n is even. Thus n = 2k for some integer k. Hence
7 −n = 7 −2k = 2(3 −k) + 1. Since 3 −k is an integer, 7 −n is odd.
(c) Proof. We ﬁrst show that if n is odd, then 7 −n is even. Assume that 7 −n is odd. Then
7 −n = 2k + 1 for some integer k and so n = 6 −2k = 2(3 −k). Since 3 −k is an integer, n is
even. For the converse, we show that if 7 −n is even, then n is odd. Assume that n is even.
Thus n = 2k for some integer k. Hence 7 −n = 7 −2k = 2(3 −k)+1. Since 3−k is an integer,
7 −n is odd.
17. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that 10 can be expressed as the sum of an odd integer x and
two even integers y and z. Then x = 2a + 1, y = 2b and z = 2c for integers a, b and c. Thus
10 = x + y + z = (2a + 1) + 2b + 2c = 2(a + b + c) + 1. Since a + b + c is an integer, 10 is odd,
which is a contradiction.
19. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a positive integer x such that x < x2 < 2x.
Dividing by x, we obtain 1 < x < 2, which is impossible.
21. Proof. Assume that mn = 1. Then m ̸= 0 and n ̸= 0. Hence either m > 0 or m < 0. We
consider these two cases.
Case 1. m > 0. Since m is an integer and mn > 0, it follows that m ≥1 and n ≥1. If m > 1
or n > 1, then mn > 1, which would produce a contradiction. So m = n = 1.
Case 2. m < 0. Since m is an integer and mn > 0, it follows that m ≤−1 and n ≤−1. If either
m < −1 and n < −1, then mn > 1, which would produce a contradiction. So m = n = −1.
23. (a) Proof. First, observe that if a = 0 or b = 0, then the result holds. Thus we may assume
that a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0. We consider three cases.
Case 1. a > 0 and b > 0. Then ab > 0. So |ab| = ab = |a||b|.
Case 2. a < 0 and b < 0. Then ab > 0. So |ab| = ab = (−a)(−b) = |a||b|.
Case 3. Exactly one of a and b is positive and the other is negative, say a > 0 and b < 0.
Then ab < 0. So |ab| = −(ab) = a(−b) = |a||b|.
(b) Since |a + b| = |a| + |b| if either a or b is 0, we may assume that a and b are nonzero. We
proceed by cases.
Case 1. a > 0 and b > 0. Then a + b > 0 and |a + b| = a + b = |a| + |b|.

Case 2. a < 0 and b < 0. Since a + b < 0, it follows that |a + b| = −(a + b) = (−a) + (−b) =
|a| + |b|.
Case 3. Exactly one of a and b is positive and the other is negative, say a > 0 and b < 0. We
consider two subcases. Subcase 3.1. a + b ≥0. Subcase 3.2. a + b < 0.
25. Assume that a is an odd integer and b is an even integer. Then a = 2x + 1 and b = 2y for
some integers x and y. Show that 3a + 5b −4 is odd.
27. Proof. Let a, b ∈R. Assume, without loss of generality, that a ≤b. Let m = min(a, b) and
M = max(a, b). Then m = a and M = b. Let r, s ∈R such that r ≤m and s ≥M. Then
r ≤m = a ≤b and s ≥M = b ≥a.
29. Proof. Assume, without loss of generality, that a ≤b. Thus min(a, b) = a and max(a, b) = b.
Since a ≤b, it follows that 2a = a + a ≤a + b ≤b + b = 2b and so 2a ≤a + b ≤2b. Dividing
by 2, we obtain min(a, b) = a ≤a+b

≤b = max(a, b).

2k > k, where k is a nonnegative integer. We show that 2k+1 > k + 1. When k = 0, we have
2k+1 = 2 > 1 = k+1. We therefore assume that k ≥1. Then 2k+1 = 2·2k > 2k = k+k ≥k+1.

11. Proof. We proceed by induction. We know that x2 is even if and only if x is even by Theo-
rem 3.23. Thus the statement is true for n = 2. Assume that xk is even if and only if x is even
for an arbitrary integer k ≥2. Therefore, xk is odd if and only if x is odd. We show that xk+1
is even if and only if x is even. We ﬁrst show that if x is even, then xk+1 is even. Since x is even,
x = 2a for some integer a. Thus xk+1 = x · xk = (2a) · xk = 2(a · xk). Since a · xk is an integer,
xk+1 is even. For the converse, we show that if xk+1 is even, then x is even using a proof by con-
trapositive. Assume that x is odd. Then xk is odd by the inductive hypothesis. Let x = 2s+1
and xk = 2t+1, where s, t ∈Z. Then xk+1 = (2s+1)(2t+1) = 4st+2s+2t+1 = 2(2st+s+t)+1.
Since 2st + s + t is an integer, xk+1 is odd.

Since the sum of the interior angles of each triangle is

of every k-gon is (k −2) · 180o for an arbitrary integer k ≥3. We show that the sum of the
interior angles of every (k + 1)-gon is (k −1) · 180o. Let Pk+1 be a (k + 1)-gon whose k + 1
vertices are v1, v2, . . ., vk+1 and whose edges are v1v2, v2v3, . . ., vkvk+1, vk+1v1. Now let Pk

and let P3 be the 3-gon whose vertices are vk, vk+1, v1 and whose edges are vkvk+1, vk+1v1,
v1vk. Observe that the sum of the interior angles of Pk+1 is the sum of interior angles of Pk
and the interior angles of P3. By the induction hypothesis, the sum of the interior angles of
Pk is (k −2) · 180o and the sum of the interior angles of P3 is 180o. Therefore, the sum of the
interior angles of Pk+1 is (k−2)·180o+180o = (k−1)·180o. By the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, the sum of the interior angles of every n-gon is (n −2) · 180o.

11. The primary error is not being careful when attempting to give a proof. The second line of
the proof should read: Assume, for an arbitrary nonnegative integer k, that 2i = 0 for every
integer i with 0 ≤i ≤k. Suppose that k = 0. Then we must show that 2(k + 1) = 0 where
k = 0. The next sentence states: Let i and j be integers such that 0 ≤i ≤k and 0 ≤j ≤k
and i + j = k + 1. When k = 0 (which is a possible value of k), the only nonnegative integers
i and j for which i + j = k + 1 = 1 are i = 0 and j = 1 (or i = 1 and j = 0). However, there
is no integer j satisfying 0 ≤j ≤k when j = 1 and k = 0. So no such integers i and j exist.
Hence we cannot show that 2(k + 1) = 0 for an arbitrary nonnegative integer k (because it’s
not true).

27. For 1 ≤n ≤210, let P(n): There exists a subset of S, the sum of whose elements is n. We
prove that P(n) is true for every integer n with 1 ≤n ≤210 by applying the Principle of
Finite Induction. Since the sum of the element(s) of the subset {1} is 1, the basis step is
established. Assume, for an integer k with 1 ≤k < 210, that there exists a subset T of S, the
sum of whose elements is k. We show that there is a subset of S, the sum of whose elements
is k + 1. If 1 /∈T , then T ∪{1} has the desired property. Hence we may assume that 1 ∈T .
Since k < 210, it follows that T ⊂S. Thus there exists a smallest integer m ≥2 such that

11. (a) reﬂexive, transitive. (b) symmetric (c) reﬂexive, transitive. (d) symmetric.
Section 5.2
1. (a) Proof. Let (a, b) ∈N × N. Since a + b = b + a, it follows that (a, b) R (a, b). Thus R is
reﬂexive. Next, assume that (a, b) R (c, d), where (a, b), (c, d) ∈N × N. Then a + d = b + c and
so c + b = d + a. Thus (c, d) R (a, b) and R is symmetric. Finally, assume that (a, b) R (c, d)
and (c, d) R (e, f), where (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈N × N. Thus a + d = b + c and c + f = d + e.
Adding these two equations, we obtain (a + d) + (c + f) = (b + c) + (d + e). Thus a + f = b + e
and so (a, b) R (e, f). Therefore, R is transitive.
(b) [(3, 1)] = {(3, 1), (4, 2), (5, 3), . . .}. [(5, 5)] = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), . . .}.
[(4, 7)] = {(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6), . . .}.
3. {(a, a), (a, d), (b, b), (b, f), (c, c), (c, e), (d, a), (d, d), (e, c), (e, e), (f, b), (f, f)}.
5. R = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5),(2, 2), (3, 1), (3,3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 5),
(5, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 5), (6, 6)}.
7. (a) R is an equivalence relation. Let a ∈Z.
Then a −a = 0 and so a R a. Thus R is
reﬂexive. Assume that a R b, where a, b ∈Z. Then a + b = 0 or a −b = 0. If a + b = 0, then
b + a = a + b = 0; while if a −b = 0, then b −a = −(a −b) = 0. Thus b + a = 0 or b −a = 0.
Therefore, b R a and R is symmetric. We now assume that a R b and b R c, where a, b, c ∈Z.
Hence (1) a + b = 0 or a −b = 0 and (2) b + c = 0 or b −c = 0. Next show that a + c = 0 or
a −c = 0. (b) For each a ∈Z, [a] = {a, −a}.
9. (a) Let a ∈Z. Then 11a−5a = 6a = 2(3a) is an even integer and so a R a. Thus R is reﬂexive.
Assume that a R b, where a, b ∈Z. Then 11a −5b is even. Thus 11a −5b = 2k for some
integer k. Observe that 11b −5a = (11a −5b) −16a + 16b = 2k −16a + 16b = 2(k −8a + 8b).
Since k −8a + 8b ∈Z, it follows that 11b −5a is even. Therefore, b R a and R is symmetric.
Finally, assume that a R b and b R c, where a, b, c ∈Z. Show that a R c and R is transitive.
(b) [0] = {x ∈Z : x is even} and [1] = {x ∈Z : x is odd}.
11. No (R is not reﬂexive).
13. Yes.
15. (a) Proof. Let x ∈S. Since P is a partition of S, it follows that x ∈Si for some integer i with
1 ≤i ≤k. Thus, x R x and R is reﬂexive. Assume that x R y, where x, y ∈S. Then x, y ∈Si
for some i with 1 ≤i ≤k. Thus y, x ∈Si for some i with 1 ≤i ≤k. Therefore, y R x and
R is symmetric. Finally, we show that R is transitive. Assume that x R y and y R z, where
x, y, z ∈S. Thus there exist integers i, j with 1 ≤i, j ≤k such that x, y ∈Si and y, z ∈Sj.
Since y ∈Si and y ∈Sj, it follows that i = j because P is a partition of S. Thus x, z ∈Si for
some i with 1 ≤i ≤k. Hence x R z and R is transitive.
(b) The distinct equivalence classes are S1, S2, . . . , Sk.
17. The statement is true.

5. Proof. We ﬁrst show that f(A1 ∪A2) ⊆f(A1) ∪f(A2). Let b ∈f(A1 ∪A2). Then there
exists a ∈A1 ∪A2 such that f(a) = b. Since a ∈A1 ∪A2, it follows that a ∈A1 or a ∈A2,
say the former. Thus b = f(a) ∈f(A1). Since f(A1) is a subset of f(A1) ∪f(A2), we have
b ∈f(A1) ∪f(A2) and so f(A1 ∪A2) ⊆f(A1) ∪f(A2). Next, we show that f(A1) ∪f(A2) ⊆

f(A1 ∪A2). Let b ∈f(A1) ∪f(A2). Then b ∈f(A1) or b ∈f(A2), say the former. Thus
there exists a ∈A1 such that f(a) = b. Since a ∈A1, it follows that a ∈A1 ∪A2 and so
b = f(a) ∈f(A1 ∪A2). Hence f(A1) ∪f(A2) ⊆f(A1 ∪A2).
7. Proof. Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {a, b} and let a function f : A →B be deﬁned by f =
{(1, a), (2, b), (3, a)}.
Let A1 = {1, 2} and A2 = {2, 3}.
Since A1 ∩A2 = {2}, it follows
that f(A1 ∩A2) = f({2}) = {b}.
On the other hand, f(A1) = f({1, 2}) = {a, b} and
f(A2) = f({2, 3}) = {a, b}; so f(A1)∩f(A2) = {a, b}. Therefore, f(A1∩A2) ̸= f(A1)∩f(A2).

23. Proof. First assume that x ∈Z. Then ⌈x⌉+ ⌊x⌋= x + x = 2x. Next, assume that 2x ∈Z but
x /∈Z. Then x = n + 1
2 for some n ∈Z and so 2x = 2n + 1. Hence ⌈x⌉+ ⌊x⌋= (n + 1) + n =
2n + 1 = 2x. For the converse, suppose that x /∈Z and 2x /∈Z. Then n < x < n + 1 for some
integer n but x ̸= n + 1
2. Thus ⌈x⌉+ ⌊x⌋= (n + 1) + n = 2n + 1 ̸= 2x.
25. (a) - (c) No.
27. Proof. First, suppose that e is an even integer. Then e = 2d for some integer d. Assume that
f(d) = k. Then f(e) = f(2d) = f(d + d) = f(d) + f(d) = 2f(d) = 2k, which is even. Assume
that c is an odd integer such that f(c) is even. Then c = 2x + 1 for some integer x. Then
f(c) = f(2x + 1) = f(2x) + f(1). Hence f(1) = f(c) −f(2x). Since f(c) and f(2x) are even,
so is f(1), say f(1) = 2ℓ. Now let y be an odd integer. Then y = 2w + 1 for some integer w.
Hence f(y) = f(2w) + f(1) = 2f(w) + 2ℓ= 2(f(w) + ℓ). Since f(w) + ℓis an integer, f(y) is

(b) The function f is onto. (c) The function f is onto. (d) The function f is not onto.

(c) f = {(a, q), (b, r), (c, s), (d, t)}. (d) f = {(a, q), (b, q), (c, q), (d, q)}.
9. Since |A| < |B|, there exists no function from A to B that is onto.
11. (a) The function f is not onto. (b) The function f is one-to-one.
Proof. Assume that f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈Z. Then 2a = 2b. Thus a = b.
13. (a) The function f is one-to-one. Proof. Let a, b ∈Z such that f(a) = f(b). Then 5a + 1 =
5b + 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides and dividing by 5, we obtain a = b.
(b) The function f is not onto since, for example, there is no integer n such that f(n) = 0.
15. The function f is one-to-one and onto. Proof. First, we show that f is one-to-one. Assume
that f(a) = f(b), where a, b ∈R −{0}. Then

2b and so 2a = 2b. Hence a = b. Next we

2r) = r, it
follows that f is onto.
17. Proof. Suppose that there exists no positive integer n such that f(n) < n and that f is not
the identity function on N. Since f is not the identity function on N, there are integers n such
that f(n) > n. Let m be the smallest positive integer such that f(m) > m. Since there is a
positive integer a with f(a) = 1, it follows that m > 1. Therefore, f(k) = k for every integer k
with 1 ≤k < m. Since there is an integer ℓsuch that f(ℓ) = m, it follows that ℓ> m. Hence
f(ℓ) < ℓ, a contradiction.
19. (a)-(d) not one-to-one. (e) one-to-one.
21. (a) The statement is true. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that f is not one-to-one. Then
there exist a1, a2 ∈A such that a1 ̸= a2 and f(a1) = f(a2). Let A1 = {a1} and A2 = {a2}.
Then A1 ̸= A2. On the other hand, since f(a1) = f(a2), it follows that f(A1) = {f(a1)} =
{f(a2)} = f(A2). This implies that A1 = A2, which is a contradiction.
(b) The statement is true. Proof. Let b ∈B and let B1 = {b} ⊆B. By assumption, there
exists a subset A1 of A such that f(A1) = B1 = {b}. Let a ∈A1. Then f(a) = b and so f is
onto.
23. (a) Let A = {a, b}, B = {1, 2, 3}, C = {x, y}, f = {(a, 1), (b, 2)} and g = {(1, x), (2, y), (3, y)}.
(b) Let A = {a, b}, B = {1, 2, 3}, C = {x, y, z}, f = {(a, 1), (b, 2)} and g = {(1, x), (2, y), (3, z)}.
(c) Let A = {a, b, c}, B = {1, 2}, C = {x, y}, f = {(a, 1), (b, 2), (c, 2)} and g = {(1, x), (2, y)}.
25. Proof. Assume that f is not injective. Then there exist distinct integers a and b such that
f(a) = f(b), say f(a) = f(b) = c. Then (f ◦f)(a) = f(f(a)) = f(c), while (f ◦f)(b) =
f(f(b)) = f(c). Thus f ◦f is not injective.

31. The function f is bijective. Proof. First, we show that f is one-to-one. Assume that f(a) =
f(b), where a, b ∈R. Then 5a −7 = 5b −7. Adding 7 to both sides and dividing by 5, we
obtain a = b. Next we show that f is onto. Let r ∈R. Then (r + 7)/5 ∈R. Therefore,

3. Proof. Let A = {a1, a2, a3, . . .} and B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn}, where n ∈N. Then the function
f : N →A ∪B deﬁned f(i) = bi for 1 ≤i ≤n and f(i) = ai−n for i ≥n + 1 is bijective and
so A ∪B = {b1, b2, . . . , bn, a1, a2, . . .} is denumerable.

S by R = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)}. Then the equivalence classes resulting
from R are A1, A2, A3, A4.
(b) Let B1 = {1, 2}, B2 = {3, 4} and B3 = {5}. Deﬁne an equivalence relation R′ on S by
R′ = {(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)}. Then the equivalence classes
resulting from R′ are B1, B2, B3.
11. First assume that R is an equivalence relation on A. Thus R is reﬂexive. It remains only to
show that R is circular. Assume that x R y and y R z, where x, y, z ∈A. Since R is transitive,
x R z. Since R is symmetric, z R x. Thus R is circular. It remains to verify the converse.
13. (a) Let a ∈N. Then a2 + a2 = 2(a2) is an even integer and so a R a. Thus R is reﬂexive. It

15. Let R = R1 ∩R2.
First, we show that R is reﬂexive. Let a ∈S.
Since R1 and R2 are
equivalence relations on S, it follows that (a, a) ∈R1 and (a, a) ∈R2. Thus (a, a) ∈R and so
R is reﬂexive. It remains to show that R is symmetric and transitive.

25. (a) Proof. We ﬁrst show that f −1(B1)∪f −1(B2) ⊆f −1(B1∪B2). Let a ∈f −1(B1)∪f −1(B2).
Then a ∈f −1(B1) or a ∈f −1(B2), say the former. Thus f(a) ∈B1. Since B1 ⊆B1 ∪B2, it
follows that f(a) ∈B1∪B2 and so a ∈f −1(B1∪B2). Thus f −1(B1)∪f −1(B2) ⊆f −1(B1∪B2).
Next, we show that f −1(B1 ∪B2) ⊆f −1(B1) ∪f −1(B2).
Let a ∈f −1(B1 ∪B2).
Then
f(a) ∈B1 ∪B2 and so f(a) ∈B1 or f(a) ∈B2, say the former.
Hence a ∈f −1(B1).
Since f −1(B1) ⊆f −1(B1) ∪f −1(B2), we have a ∈f −1(B1) ∪f −1(B2), which implies that
f −1(B1 ∪B2) ⊆f −1(B1) ∪f −1(B2).
(b) Proof. We ﬁrst show that f −1(B1 ∩B2) ⊆f −1(B1) ∩f −1(B2). Let a ∈f −1(B1 ∩B2).
Then f(a) ∈B1 ∩B2 and so f(a) ∈B1 and f(a) ∈B2. Hence a ∈f −1(B1) and a ∈f −1(B2).
Thus a ∈f −1(B1) ∩f −1(B2), implying that f −1(B1 ∩B2) ⊆f −1(B1) ∩f −1(B2). Next, we
show that f −1(B1)∩f −1(B2) ⊆f −1(B1 ∩B2). Let a ∈f −1(B1)∩f −1(B2). Then a ∈f −1(B1)
and a ∈f −1(B2). Hence f(a) ∈B1 and f(a) ∈B2, implying that f(a) ∈B1 ∩B2 and so
a ∈f −1(B1 ∩B2). Thus f −1(B1) ∩f −1(B2) ⊆f −1(B1 ∩B2).
27. (a) bijective. (b)-(d) not bijective.
29. (a) f(x) = x3 −x. (b) f(x) = 2x.
31. Proof. Assume that f(c) = f(d), where c, d ∈R. Then ac + b = ad + b. Subtracting b from
both sides and dividing by a, we have c = d and so f is one-to-one. To show that f is onto,
let r ∈R. Then (r −b)/a ∈R. Since f

a−5 = b+1
b−5 and so (a + 1)(b −5) =
(a −5)(b + 1). Simplifying, we obtain ab + b −5a −5 = ab + a −5b −5. Therefore 6a = 6b and
so a = b. Thus f is one-to-one. It remains to show that f is onto.
35. Proof. We proceed by induction. The derivative of f(x) = ln x is f ′(x) = f (1)(x) = 1/x. For

Input: Three numbers a, b, c.
Output: x = min(a, b, c).
1. x := a [x is assigned the value a]
2. if b < x then x := b [if b < x, then x is assigned the value b]
3. if c < x then x := c [if c < x, then x is assigned the value c]
4. output x
(b) In this case a = 8, b = 6, c = 4. In Step 1, x is assigned the value 8. Since 6 < 8, x is
assigned the value 6 in Step 2. Since 4 < 6, x is assigned the value 4 in Step 3. Step 4 then
outputs x, namely 4.
(c) In this case, a = 7, b = 5, c = 5. In Step 1, x is assigned the value 7. Since 5 < 7, x is
assigned the value 5 in Step 2. In Step 3, we check whether c < x, that is, whether 5 < 5.
Since this is not true, we move on to Step 4, where x = 5 is output.
5. (a) Algorithm: Find the Next-to-Largest Number in a List s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n ≥2 Distinct

2. for i := 2 to n do [i is assigned the integers from 2 to n]

[if ai > y but ai ̸= x, then a value larger than y, but not

8. output y [the next-to-largest number in s is output]
(b) In this case, a1 = 7, a2 = 10, a3 = 12, a4 = 15. The numbers in this sequence s are input,
as is the length n = 4 of the sequence. In Step 1, x is assigned the value 7. Step 2 is a for loop
and i is initially assigned the value 2. Because a2 = 10 > 7 = x, the value 10 is assigned to
x in Step 3. We repeat Step 3 for i = 3. Because a3 = 12 > 10, x is assigned the value 12 in
Step 3. We repeat Step 3 for i = 4. Since a4 = 15 > 12, x is assigned the value 15 in Step 3.
Since i = n = 4, we move on to Step 4, where y is given the initial value a1 = 7. In Step 5,
since y ̸= x, the conclusion of Step 5 is not executed. Step 6 is a for loop where i is initially
assigned the value 1. Because y = a1 = 7, the conclusion of Step 7 is not executed when i = 1.
Step 7 is repeated for i = 2. Since a2 = 10 and 7 = y < 10 < x = 15, y is assigned the value
10 in Step 7. Step 7 is repeated for i = 3. Since a3 = 12 and 10 = y < 12 < x = 15, y is
assigned the value 12 in Step 7. Since x = a4, Step 7 is not executed when i = 4 = n. Thus
y = 12, which is output in Step 8.

the conclusion of Step 3 is not executed. In Step 4, i is increased to 2. Because i = 2 ≤4,
Steps 3 and 4 are performed again. Since a2 ̸= 11, we proceed to Step 4, where i is increased
to 3. Because i = 3 ≤4, Steps 3 and 4 are executed again. Since a3 ̸= 11, we proceed to
Step 4, where i is increased to 4. Because i = 4 ≤4, Steps 3 and 4 are executed once again.
Now a4 = 11 and so 11 is in the sequence is output. Also, i is assigned the valued n + 1 = 5.
In Step 4, i is increased to 6. Since 6 ≤4 is not true, the while loop is exited and we proceed

Input: A positive integer n, a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n distinct numbers and a number k.

15. The integer n = 3 is input as is the sequence s : 1, 2, 3. So a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 3. In Step 1,
i is initialized to 0. Since 0 ≤2 in Step 2, Steps 3–5 are performed. In Step 3, i is increased
to 1 and j is deﬁned to be 2 in Step 4. Since 2 = j ≤n = 3 in Step 5, Steps 6 and 7 are
performed. Since a1 ̸= a2, the conclusion of Step 6 is not executed. In Step 7, j is increased
to 3. We return to Step 5. Since 3 = j ≤n = 3 in Step 5, Steps 6 and 7 are performed. Since
a1 ̸= a3, the conclusion of Step 6 is not executed. In Step 7, j is increased to 4. We return to
Step 5. Since 4 = j ≤n = 3 is false, this completes Step 5 and we return to Step 2. Continue

where C = 3 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition. Next, we show that g = O(f). Since n ≤2n + 1 for

11. First, we show that f = O(g). Since n2+4n+1 ≤n2+4n2+1 = 5n2+1 ≤5n2+20 = 5(n2+4)
for n ≥1, we have f = O(g), where C = 5 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition. Next, we show that

a8 = 23, a9 = 24. By Steps 1 and 2, a = 1 and b = 9. Since 1 = a ≤b = 9, Steps 4–8 are
executed. By Step 4, p = 5. Among Steps 5–7, only a5 < k is true and so only the conclusion

(b) For this sequence, n = 4 and a1 = 6, a2 = 7, a3 = 5, a4 = 7. By Step 1, i is assigned
the value 0. Since 0 = i ≤n −1 = 3 in Step 2, Steps 3–5 are executed. In Steps 3 and 4,
we have i = 1 and j = 2. Since 2 = j ≤n = 4 in Step 5, Steps 6 and 7 are executed. Since
6 = a1 ̸= a2 = 7 in Step 6, the conclusion of Step 6 is not executed. In Step 7, j is increased to
3. Since 3 = j ≤n = 4 in Step 5, Steps 6 and 7 are executed. Since 6 = a1 ̸= a3 = 5, we move
on to Step 7 and j is increased to 4. Since 4 = j ≤n = 4 in Step 5, we execute Steps 6 and 7.
Since 6 = a1 ̸= a4 = 7, we move on to Step 7 and j is increased to 5. However, 5 = j ≤n = 4
is false; so we have completed Step 5. We now return to Step 2. Now continue.

5. Since 2n ≥n for every positive integer n, it follows that log n ≤n for every positive integer n.
Multiplying by n, we have that n log n ≤n2 for every positive integer n. Hence n log n = O(n2),
where C = k = 1 in the deﬁnition.
7. For each positive integer n, observe that f(n) = 2n3+n
n+2
≤2n3+4n2
n+2
= 2n2(n+2)
n+2
= 2n2. Thus
f = O(n2), where C = 2 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition.
9. Observe, for every positive integer n, that f(n) = n2 + 3n + 1 ≤n3 + 3n3 + n3 = 5n3 = 5g(n).
Thus f = O(g), where C = 5 and k = 1 in the deﬁnition. Next, we show that g ̸= O(f).
Assume, to the contrary, that g = O(f). Then there exist a positive constant C and a positive
integer k such that n3 ≤C(n2 + 3n + 1) for every integer n ≥k. Dividing by n3, we have

n < (5C) 1
5C = 1 which is impossible. Since g ̸= O(f), it follows that g ̸= Θ(f)
11. Since 2n ≤3n for every positive integer n, it follows that f(n) = O(g(n)). Now we show
that f(n) ̸= Θ(g(n)). Assume, to the contrary, that there exist a positive constant C and a
positive integer k such that g(n) ≤Cf(n) for every integer n ≥k. Thus 3n ≤C · 2n and so

2n = (1.5)n ≤C. Since

2)n < (1.5)n ≤C. Taking logarithms
of both sides, we have n/2 ≤log C and so n ≤2 log C. Let n be an integer greater than
max(k, 2 log C). Then n > 2 log C. This is a contradiction.
13. There are several possible solutions. Suppose ﬁrst that we use the Bubble Sort Algorithm, say,
to sort the sequence. The time complexity of this algorithm is Θ(n2). Hence we may assume
that s is a nondecreasing sequence. Thus the minimum value of |ai −aj| among all pairs ai,
aj of distinct terms of s occurs when j = i + 1 for some integer i. An algorithm that does the
following can be written.
Algorithm: This algorithm determines the minimum value of |ai −ai+1| where 1 ≤i ≤n −1
for a sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers listed in nondecreasing order.
Input: A positive integer n and a nonincreasing sequence s : a1, a2, . . . , an of n numbers.

(d) 8 | −8, c = −1. (e) 14 | 0, c = 0. (f) 0 ∤14 (not deﬁned).
3. Proof. Assume that a | b. Then b = ax for some integer x. Thus −b = −(ax) = a(−x) and
b = (−a)(−x). Since −x is an integer, a | (−b) and (−a) | b.
5. Proof. First, assume that ac | bc. Then bc = (ac)x = c(ax) for some integer x. Since c ̸= 0,
we can divide by c, obtaining b = ax. So a | b. For the converse, assume that a | b. Then
b = ax for some integer x. Multiplying by c, we have bc = (ax)c = (ac)x. Since x is an integer,
ac | bc.
7. a = 1 and b = −1 is a counterexample.
9. Proof. Assume that a | b or a | c, say a | b.
Then b = ax for some integer x.

show that 3 divides 4(k+1)3 +5(k+1). Observe that 4(k+1)3 +5(k+1) = 3(ℓ+4k2 +4k+3).

23k = 7ℓ+ 1. Next show that 7 divides 23(k+1) −1. Observe that 23(k+1) −1 = 7(8ℓ+ 1).
15. If n < 0, then n = −k for some positive integer k. Then apply Result 7.6 and Exercise 3.

133 | 133, the statement is true for n = 1. Assume that 133 | (11k+1 + 122k−1) for a positive
integer k. Then 11k+1 + 122k−1 = 133x for some integer x and so 122k−1 = 133x −11k+1.
Next show that 133 | (11k+2 + 122k+1). Observe that 11k+2 + 122k+1 = 133(144x −11k−1).

5. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a ﬁnite number of primes greater than 1, 000, 000.
Since there is certainly a ﬁnite number of primes less than 1, 000, 000, it follows that there is

9. First, ab may be prime, such as 31. However, no other integer in the list can be prime. If
abab · · ·ab contains 2k digits, where k ≥2, then abab · · · ab = ab (1010 · · ·01).
11. Proof. If n = 1, then n3 +1 = 2 is a prime. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a prime
p = n3 + 1 for some integer n ≥2. Then p = (n + 1)(n2 −n + 1). Therefore, either n + 1 = 1
or n2 −n + 1 = 1. If n + 1 = 1, then n = 0, which is impossible; while if n2 −n + 1 = 1, then
n2 −n = 0, implying that n = 1 or n = 0, both of which are impossible.
13. Proof. Assume that Goldbach’s conjecture is true. Then every even integer that is 4 or greater
can be expressed as the sum of two primes. Let n ≥3 be an integer. We show that n can be
expressed as the sum of three integers, each of which is either 1 or a prime. Since 3 = 1 +1 +1
and 4 = 1 +1 +2, the conjecture is true if n = 3 and n = 4. Hence we may assume that n ≥5.
We consider two cases.

Case 2. n is even. Then n −2 is even and n −2 ≥4. Thus n −2 can be expressed as the sum

11. Let a, b, c, d and e be ﬁve consecutive integers. Hence we may assume that a = n, b = n + 1,
c = n + 2, d = n + 3 and e = n + 4 for some integer n. Thus n = 5q, n = 5q + 1, n = 5q + 2,
n = 5q + 3 or n = 5q + 4 for some integer q. Consider these ﬁve cases.
13. (a) Let n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + p be p consecutive integers. Then n = pq + r for some integers q

one of the integers n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + p is n + (p −r). Now continue.

For the converse, assume that a and b are of opposite parity and show that 4 ∤(a2 −b2).
Consider two cases. Case 1. a is odd and b is even. Case 2. a is even and b is odd.
17. Assume that 3 ∤a and 3 ∤b. Then one of the following four situations occurs: (1) a = 3s + 1

and b = 3t + 2, where s, t ∈Z. We consider these four cases.
Case 1. a = 3s + 1 and b = 3t + 1. Then

(3s + 1)2 −(3t + 1)2 = (9s2 + 6s + 1) −(9t2 + 6t + 1)

9s2 + 6s −9t2 −6t = 3(3s2 + 2s −3t2 −2t).
Since 3s2 + 2s −3t2 −2t is an integer, 3 | (a2 −b2).
[The proofs of the other cases are similar.]
19. Let p be a prime diﬀerent from 2 and 5. Dividing p by 10, we obtain p = 10k + r for some
integers k and r, where 0 ≤r ≤9. If r = 0, then 10 | p, which is impossible. If r = 2, then
p = 10k + 2 = 2(5k + 1). Since 5k + 1 is an integer, 2 | p, again an impossibility since p ̸= 2. If
r = 4, then p = 10k + 4 = 2(5k + 2). Since 5k + 1 is an integer, 2 | p, which is a contradiction.
Now continue.

Since 3k + 1 is an integer, 2 | p. Since p ≥5, we have a contradiction. Now continue.

5. First, we prove that if a ≡b (mod n), then b = a + ℓn for some integer ℓ. Assume that
a ≡b (mod n). By Theorem 7.25, a = b + kn for some integer k. Then b = a −kn. Thus
b = a + ℓn, where ℓ= −k. Now verify the converse: If b = a + ℓn for some integer ℓ, then
a ≡b (mod n).
7. Proof. Since m | n, it follows that n = mx for some integer x. Assume that a ≡b (mod n).
Thus n | (a −b) and so a −b = ny for some integer y. Hence a −b = ny = (mx)y = m(xy).
Since xy is an integer, m | (a −b) and so a ≡b (mod m).
9. Proof. Assume that a ≡b (mod n) and c ≡d (mod n). By Theorem 7.25, a = b + nx and
c = d + ny for some integers x and y. Hence a −c = (b −d) + (nx −ny) = (b −d) + n(x −y).
Since x −y is an integer, a −c ≡b −d (mod n) by Theorem 7.25.
11. Proof. We proceed by induction. By Exercise 10, the statement is true for r = 2. Assume
that if a ≡b (mod n), then ak ≡bk (mod n) for an integer k ≥2. Again, it then follows
by Exercise 10 that ak+1 ≡bk+1 (mod n). By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, if
a ≡b (mod n), then ar ≡br (mod n) for every integer r ≥2.
13. Proof. Assume that a ≡0 (mod 5) and b ≡2 (mod 5). Then a = 5x and b = 5y + 2 for
integers x and y. Observe that a2 + b2 = 5(5x2 + 5y2 + 2y) + 4. Since 5x2 + 5y2 + 2y is an
integer, a2 + b2 ≡4 (mod 5).
15. Assume that one of a and b is congruent to 0 modulo 3 and that the other is not congruent to
0 modulo 3. We show that a2 + 2b2 ̸≡0 (mod 3). We consider two cases.
Case 1. a ≡0 (mod 3) and b ̸≡0 (mod 3). Since a ≡0 (mod 3), it follows that a = 3p for
some integer p. Since b ̸≡0 (mod 3), either b = 3q + 1 or b = 3q + 2 for some integer q. There
are two subcases.

b = 3q + 1. Then a2 + 2b2 = (3p)2 + 2(3q + 1)2 = 9p2 + 2(9q2 + 6q + 1) =

Subcase 1.2.
b = 3q + 2. (The proof is similar to that of Subcase 1.1.)

5. Proof. Let a and b be integers, not both 0, and let d = gcd(a, b). Assume ﬁrst that n is a linear
combination of a and b. Then n = ax + by for some integers x and y. Since d | a and d | b, it
follows that a = ds and b = dt for some integers s and t. Thus n = ax + by = (ds)x + (dt)y =
d(sx + ty). Since sx + ty is an integer, d | n. For the converse, assume that d | n. Then n = dk
for some integer k. Since d = gcd(a, b), it follows that d is a linear combination of a and b and
so d = ax + by for some integers x and y. Therefore, n = dk = (ax + by)k = a(xk) + b(yk).
Since xk and yk are integers, n is a linear combination of a and b.
7. Proof. Let k be a positive integer and d = gcd(a, b). Since d = gcd(a, b), it follows that
d = ax+by for some integers x and y. Thus kd = k(ax+by) = (ka)x+(kb)y. Since kd is a linear
combination of ka and kb and gcd(ka, kb) is the smallest integer that is a linear combination of
ka and kb, it follows that gcd(ka, kb) ≤k gcd(a, b). On the other hand, gcd(ka, kb) is a linear
combination of ka and kb and so gcd(ka, kb) = (ka)s + (kb)t for some integers s and t. Since
d | a and d | b, it follows that kd | ka and kd | kb. Thus ka = (kd)x and kb = (kd)y for some
integers x and y. Therefore, gcd(ka, kb) = (ka)s + (kb)t = (kdx)s + (kdy)t = (kd)(xs + yt).
Since xs+yt is an integer, kd | gcd(ka, kb), implying that k gcd(a, b) ≤gcd(ka, kb). Therefore,
k gcd(a, b) = gcd(ka, kb).

15. Proof. Assume that gcd(an, bn) = 1, where a, b, n ∈N with n ≥2. Then there exist integers
x and y such that anx + bny = 1. Thus a(an−1x) + b(bn−1y) = 1. Since an−1x, bn−1y ∈Z, it

19. Let a and b be integers that are not multiples of 3 but diﬀer by 3. Then a = 3q + r for
some integers q and r, where r ∈{1, 2}. We may assume, without loss of generality, that
b = a + 3 = 3q + 3 + r. Consider the cases where r = 1 and r = 2.
21. Proof. Since a | c and b | c, there exist integers x and y such that c = ax and c = by.
Furthermore, since a and b are relatively prime, there exist integers s and t such that 1 =
as + bt. Multiplying by c and substituting, we obtain c = c · 1 = c(as + bt) = c(as) + c(bt) =
(by)(as) + (ax)(bt) = ab(sy + xt). Since sy + xt is an integer, ab | c.
23. Proof. Since a and b are relatively prime, there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = 1.
Then a(x + y) + (b −a)y = ax + ay + by −ay = ax + by = 1. Since 1 is a linear combination
of a and b −a, it follows that a and b −a are relatively prime.
25. We use the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since gcd(a1, a2) = gcd(1, 2) = 1,
the statement is true for n = 1.
Assume for a positive integer k, that gcd(ai, ai+1) = 1
for every integer i with 1 ≤i ≤k.
We show that gcd(ak+1, ak+2) = 1.
When k = 1,
gcd(ak+1, ak+2) = gcd(a2, a3) = gcd(2, 3) = 1. Since gcd(ak+1, ak+2) = 1 for k = 1, we can
assume that k ≥2. We consider two cases, according to whether k + 1 is even or k + 1 is odd.

Case 1.
k + 1 is odd.
Then k + 1 = 2ℓ+ 1 for some positive integer ℓ.
Then ak+1 =
a2ℓ+1 = aℓ+aℓ+1, while ak+2 = a2ℓ+2 = aℓ+1. By the induction hypothesis, gcd(aℓ, aℓ+1) = 1.
Hence there exist integers x and y such that aℓx + aℓ+1y = 1. Since ak+1x + ak+2(y −x) =
(aℓ+ aℓ+1)x + aℓ+1(y −x) = aℓx + aℓ+1x + aℓ+1y −aℓ+1x = aℓx + aℓ+1y = 1, it follows that
gcd(ak+1, ak+2) = 1.
Case 2. k + 1 is even. (The proof is similar to case 1).

3. Proof. Assume that a | (b + c + d) and that a divides any two of b, c and d, say a | b and a | c.
Thus b + c + d = ax, b = ay and c = az, where x, y, z ∈Z. Then ax = b + c + d = ay + az + d.
Therefore, d = ax −ay −az = a(x −y −z). Since x −y −z is an integer, a | d.
5. Proof. We proceed by induction. The statement is true for n = 1. Assume that if a | b, then
ak | bk for a positive integer k. We show that if a | b, then ak+1 | bk+1. Assume that a | b.
By the induction hypothesis, ak | bk. Thus bk = akx for some integer x. Since a | b, it follows
that b = ay for some integer y. Then bk+1 = b · bk = (ay)(akx) = ak+1xy. Since xy is an
integer, ak+1 | bk+1. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, if a | b, then an | bn for
every positive integer n.

17. Let d = gcd(a, b) and d′ = gcd(a, b+ak). Since d | a and d | b, it can be shown that d | (b+ak).
This implies that d | d′ and so d ≤d′. For the converse, since d′ | a and d′ | (b + ak), it can
be shown that d′ | b. Then d′ | d, implying that d′ ≤d.
19. a = 23 and b = 26.
21. (a) Proof. We ﬁrst assume that gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1. Then as + bt = 1 and ax + cy = 1
for some integers s, t, x, y. Thus
1
=
(as + bt)(ax + cy) = a2sx + acsy + abtx + bcty = a(asx + csy + btx) + bc(ty).
Since asx + csy + btx and ty are integers, gcd(a, bc) = 1.
For the converse, assume that
gcd(a, bc) = 1. Then ak+(bc)ℓ= 1 for some integers k, ℓ. Thus ak+b(cℓ) = 1 and ak+c(bℓ) = 1.
Since k, cℓand bℓare integers, gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1.
(b) Proof. Since a and b are relatively prime, gcd(a, b) = 1. By (a), gcd(a, b2) = 1 (letting
c = b). Since gcd(a, b2) = gcd(b2, a), it follows that gcd(b2, a) = 1. Again by (a), gcd(b2, a2) =
1 (letting c = a) and so a2 and b2 are relatively prime.

25. We proceed by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. First, consider n = 1. Since
a1 ≡2 (mod 3), it follows that a1 ̸≡0 (mod 3). Since 1 ̸≡0 (mod 4), we conclude that
an ≡0 (mod 3) if and only if n ≡0 (mod 4) is true for n = 1. Assume for a positive integer
k that ai ≡0 (mod 3) if and only if i ≡0 (mod 4) for all integers i with 1 ≤i ≤k. We show
that ak+1 ≡0 (mod 3) if and only if k + 1 ≡0 (mod 4). Since a2 ≡2 (mod 3) and from the
recurrence relation a3 ≡1 (mod 3) and a4 ≡0 (mod 3), it follows that ak+1 ≡0 (mod 3) if
and only if k + 1 ≡0 (mod 4) when 1 ≤k ≤3. Hence we may assume that k ≥4. We now
consider four cases, depending on whether k + 1 is congruent to 0, 1, 2 or 3 modulo 4.
Case 1.
k + 1 ≡0 (mod 4).
Since k −3 ∈N and k −3 ≡0 (mod 4), it follows that
ak−3 ≡0 (mod 3). Since k −2 ̸≡0 (mod 4), it follows that ak−2 ̸≡0 (mod 3). Therefore,
either ak−2 ≡1 (mod 3) or ak−2 ≡2 (mod 3). By the recurrence relation, we either have
(1) ak−2 ≡1 (mod 3), ak−1 ≡1 (mod 3), and ak ≡2 (mod 3) or (2) ak−2 ≡2 (mod 3),
ak−1 ≡2 (mod 3), and ak ≡1 (mod 3). If either (1) or (2) occurs, then ak+1 ≡0 (mod 3),
as desired.
(The proofs of other cases are similar.)
27. Proof. Assume that k is not a prime. Then there exist integers a and b such that 2 ≤a ≤k−1,
2 ≤b ≤k −1 and k = ab. Thus 2k −1 = 2ab −1 = (2a)b −1 = (2a −1)(2(b−1)a + 2(b−2)a +
· · · + 2a + 1). Since 2a −1 > 1 and 2(b−1)a + 2(b−2)a + · · · + 2a + 1 > 1, it follows that 2k −1
is not a prime.
29. We proceed by the Strong Principle of Mathematical Induction. Since F1 = 1, the statement
is true for n = 1. Assume for a positive integer k that 2 | Fi if and only if 3 | i for all integers
i with 1 ≤i ≤k. We show that 2 | Fk+1 if and only if 3 | (k + 1). Since F2 = 1, it follows
that 2 | Fk+1 if and only if 3 | (k + 1) when k = 1. Hence we may assume that k ≥2. Now
consider the three cases, according to whether k + 1 = 3q, k + 1 = 3q + 1 or k + 1 = 3q + 2 for
some integer q.

37. Proof. Since b = a(−1) + (−c), it follows by Theorem 7.35 that gcd(a, b) = gcd(−c, a) =
gcd(c, a) = gcd(a, c). Similarly, gcd(b, c) = gcd(a, b).

Even if he could purchase one lottery ticket per second, he could only purchase 604,800 tickets in
a week, which would take him too much time. Furthermore, even if he could make arrangements
to purchase all tickets in the appropriate amount of time, he would have to locate the winning
ticket among the 120,526,770 tickets he bought. Even worse, it is quite possible that there are
other winning tickets, in which case the grand prize would be shared and he has lost more
than $45,000,000.

Therefore, p(E ∩F) = p(E) −p(E) · p(F) = p(E)(1 −p(F)) = p(E) · p(F) and so E and F are

17. Proof. Let (S, R) be a poset. Let a ∈S. Since a R a, it follows that a R−1 a. Hence R−1 is
reﬂexive. Assume that a R−1 b and b R−1 a, where a, b ∈S. Then b R a and a R b. Because R
is antisymmetric, b = a. Thus R−1 is antisymmetric. Next assume that a R−1 b and b R−1 c,
where a, b, c ∈S. Then b R a and c R b. Since R is transitive, c R a. Thus a R−1 c and so
R−1 is transitive. Therefore, (S, R−1) is a poset.

21. Proof. Let (S, ⪯) be a ﬁnite nonempty poset. Among the chains in S, let x1 ≺x2 ≺· · · ≺xk
be one containing a maximum number of elements. There can be no element x ∈S such that
xk ≺x, for otherwise, x1 ≺x2 ≺· · · ≺xk ≺x is a chain with more than k elements. Hence
xk is a maximal element.
23. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a ﬁnite poset (S ⪯) containing a unique
minimal element m such that m is not a least element. Since m is not a least element, there
exists an element a ∈S such that m ̸≺a. Since m is a minimal element, it is impossible for
a ≺m. Thus a and m are incomparable. If there is no element a′ such that a′ ≺a, then a is a
minimal element of (S, ⪯), contradicting our assumption that m is the only minimal element
of (S, ⪯). Hence there must be some element a′ such that a′ ≺a. Since S is ﬁnite, there is
a chain a1 ≺a2 ≺· · · ≺ak = a with a maximum number of elements. However, then a1 is a
minimal element. Because a1 ≺a and a and m are incomparable, a1 ̸= m, which contradicts
the assumption that m is the unique minimal element of (S, ⪯).
25. (a) See Figure 9. (b) 6, 10, 14, 15, 21 and 35 are maximal elements, while 2, 3, 5 and 7 are
minimal elements. (c) There is no greatest or least element.

This algorithm ﬁnds a maximal element in a ﬁnite poset (S, ⪯), where s : a1, a2, . . . , an is a

a ̸= b.
Input: Two positive integers n and m, a list s : a1, a2, . . . , an of the n elements of S and
a list s′ : e1, e2, . . . , em of the m elements (a, b) of ⪯for which a ̸= b.

29. Proof. We proceed by induction.
If n = 2, then the result follows from Theorem 11.19.
Assume that the result is true for k ≥2 totally ordered sets and let (A1, ⪯1), (A2, ⪯2), . . .,
(Ak+1, ⪯k+1) be k + 1 totally ordered sets. We show that the lexicographic order ⪯deﬁned
on A1 × A2 × Ak+1 is a total order. By the induction hypothesis, the lexicographic order ⪯
deﬁned on A = A1 × A2 × · · · Ak is a total order and so (A, ⪯) is a totally ordered set. Since
A1 × A2 × · · · Ak+1 = A × Ak+1, it follows by Theorem 11.19 that (A × Ak+1, ⪯) is a totally
ordered set.

2s −1 distinct primes. Let a = 1, bi = pi for 1 ≤i ≤2r, c = b1b2 · · · b2r and dj = p2r+jc for
1 ≤j ≤2s −2r −1. Let S = {a, b1, b2, . . . , b2r, d1, d2, . . . , d2s−2r−1}. Then (S, |) is a poset
with |S| = 2s. The set I = {b1, b2, . . . , b2r} is the set of intermediate elements of S. Then
|I|
|S| = 2r
2s = r
s = q.
Section 11.2
1. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there exists a poset (S, ⪯) containing a nonempty subset
A having two distinct least upper bounds u1 and u2. Since u1 is a least upper bound, u1 ⪯u2.
Also, since u2 is a least upper bound, u2 ⪯u1. Since ⪯is antisymmetric, u1 = u2, contradicting
the assumption that u1 and u2 are distinct.
3. No, a2 and a3, for example, do not have a unique least upper bound.
5. (a) Proof. Let d = a∨c and e = b∨c. Then b ⪯e and c ⪯e. Since a ⪯b, it follows that a ⪯e.
Thus e is an upper bound of {a, c}. Because d = a ∨c, we have d ⪯e, that is, a ∨c ⪯b ∨c.
(b) Proof. Let d = a ∧c and e = b ∧c. Thus d ⪯a and d ⪯c. Since a ⪯b, it follows that
d ⪯b. Thus d is a lower bound of {b, c}. Since e = b ∧c, we have d ⪯e and so a ∧c ⪯b ∧c.
7. Proof. First, assume that c ⪯a and c ⪯b. Hence c is a lower bound of {a, b} and so c ⪯a∧b.
For the converse, assume that c ⪯a ∧b. Let d = a ∧b. Then d ⪯a and d ⪯b. Since c ⪯d, it
follows that c ⪯a and c ⪯b.
9. (a) Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that a ∨b = b. Since a ∨b is the least upper bound of a and b, it
follows that a ⪯a ∨b = b. Thus a ⪯b. For the converse, suppose that a ⪯b. Thus b is an
upper bound of a and b. Since a∨b is the least upper bound of a and b, it follows that a∨b ⪯b.
Since a ∨b is an upper bound of a and b, we have b ⪯a ∨b. Because ⪯is antisymmetric,
a ∨b = b.
(b) is similar to (a). (c) Proof. By (b), a ∧b = a if and only if a ⪯b. By (a), a ⪯b if and
only if a ∨b = a. Consequently, a ∧b = a if and only if a ∨b = a.
11. (a) 6, 6. (b) 30, 30. (c) Parts (a) and (b) illustrates that (S, |) is a distributive lattice, where
S, say, is the set of positive integer divisors of 300.
13. The lattice (S, ≤) is complemented if n = 2; while (S, ≤) is not complemented for n ≥3.
15. Proof. Observe that b ∧(a ∨b) = (b ∧a) ∨(b ∧b) = (b ∧a) ∨b = b and that
b ∧(a ∨b)
=
b ∧(a ∨c) = (b ∧a) ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∧b) ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∧c) ∨(b ∧c)
=
(c ∧a) ∨(c ∧b) = c ∧(a ∨b) = c ∧(a ∨c) = (c ∧a) ∨(c ∧c) = (c ∧a) ∨c = c.
Thus b = c.

17. (a) Proof. Let (L, ⪯) be a distributive lattice and let a, b, c ∈L, where a ⪯c. We show
that a ∨(b ∧c) = (a ∨b) ∧c. First, observe that since a ⪯c, we have c ∧a = a.
Now
(a ∨b) ∧c = c ∧(a ∨b) = (c ∧a) ∨(c ∧b) = a ∨(b ∧c).
(b) First observe that b ⪯d. Now b ∨(e ∧d) = b ∨a = b, while (b ∨e) ∧d = f ∧d = d. Thus
the lattice is not modular.
19. Proof. Suppose that there is an element a ∈L that has two complements, say b and c. Then
a ∨b = a ∨c = 1 and a ∧b = a ∧c = 0. Therefore,
b
=
b ∧1 = b ∧(a ∨c) = (b ∧a) ∨(b ∧c) = 0 ∨(b ∧c) = b ∧c = c ∧b = 0 ∨(c ∧b)
=
(c ∧a) ∨(c ∧b) = c ∧(a ∨b) = c ∧1 = c
and so b = c.
21. If a ∈S such that a and n/a are relatively prime, then a = n/a.
Section 11.3
1. Proof. Let a, b ∈S. To see that a · b = a + b, we show that a + b is the complement of a · b.
Hence we must verify that a · b + (a + b) = 1 and (a · b) · (a + b) = 0. Observe by a distributive
law that
a · b + (a + b)
=
(a + b) + (a · b) = ((a + b) + a) · ((a + b) + b) = (a + (a + b)) · ((a + b) + b)
=
((a + a) + b) · (a + (b + b)) = (1 + b) · (a + 1) = 1 · 1 = 1.
(a · b) · (a + b)
=
((a · b) · a) + ((a · b) · b) = (a · (a · b)) + (a · (b · b))
=
((a · a) · b) + (a · 0) = (0 · b) + 0 = 0 + 0 = 0.
Therefore, a · b = a + b.

3. a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 and d = 6.
5. (a) Proof. Let (a, b) ∈S × S. Since a ≤a and b ≤b, it follows that (a, b) R (a, b) and so R is
reﬂexive. Next, assume that (a, b) R (c, d) and (c, d) R (a, b), where (a, b), (c, d) ∈S ×S. Since
(a, b) R (c, d), we have a ≤c and b ≤d. Furthermore, since (c, d) R (a, b), it follows that c ≤a
and d ≤b. Thus a = c and b = d and so (a, b) = (c, d). Therefore, R is antisymmetric. Finally,
assume that (a, b) R (c, d) and (c, d) R (e, f), where (a, b), (c, d), (e, f) ∈S × S. Therefore,
a ≤c, b ≤d, c ≤e and d ≤f. Thus a ≤e and b ≤f. This implies that (a, b) R (e, f) and so
R is transitive.

7. (a) The maximal elements are h and i and the minimal elements are a, b and c.
(b) The set A1 does not have a least upper bound or a greatest lower bound.
(c) The set A2 does not have a least upper bound or a greatest lower bound.
9. (a) is true. Since R is symmetric, it suﬃces to show that R is reﬂexive and transitive. Let
a ∈S. Since one of the ordered pairs (a, a) and (a, a) belongs to R, it follows that (a, a) ∈R
and R is reﬂexive. Next show that R is transitive.
11. Proof. Let (S, ⪯) be a totally ordered set of cardinality n ≥2. Hence we may assume that
S = {a1, a2, . . . , an}, where a1 ≺a2 ≺· · · ≺an. For 1 ≤i ≤n, let Sai = {ai, ai+1, . . . , an}
and so |Sai| = n −i + 1. Thus f(ai) = n −i + 1 and so f is bijective. For the converse, assume
that f is a bijective function. Hence for each integer i with 1 ≤i ≤n, there exists xi ∈S such
that f(xi) = i. Since f(xn) = n, it follows that xn ⪯xi for all i with 1 ≤i ≤n. Since ⪯is
antisymmetric, it follows that xn−1 ̸⪯xn. Furthermore, since f(xn−1) = n −1, it follows that
xn−1 ⪯xi for all i with 1 ≤i ≤n −1. Thus xn ≺xn−1 ≺· · · ≺x1 and so (S, ⪯) is a totally
ordered set.

13. The statement is false. The number of 1’s in row i is the degree of vi. The total number of 1’s
in the adjacency matrix is the sum of the degrees of the vertices of the graph, which is twice
the size of the graph.

19. For k = 3, let G be the graph with V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , v6} and E(G) ={v1v2, v1v5, v1v6, v2v3,
v2v5, v3v4, v4v5}.
21. Proof. Suppose that G contains a vertices of degree 2k, b vertices of degree 2k + 1 and c
vertices of degree 2k + 2. Assume, to the contrary, that a ≤2k, b ≤2k + 1 and c ≤2k. Thus
a + b + c ≤2k + (2k + 1) + 2k = 6k + 1. Since G has 6k + 1 vertices, a = 2k, b = 2k + 1 and
c = 2k. However then, G contains an odd number b of odd vertices, which is impossible.
23. (a) P4. (b) C5. (c) If G ∼= G, then G and G have the same size m. Thus 2m =

so m = 15/2. This is impossible.
25. The statement is false. There is no 5-regular graph of order 2n + 1.
27. No.
29. The statement is false.
31. Since degG v = degG v = r and degG v + degG v = n −1, it follows that 2r = n −1 and so
n = 2r + 1 is odd.

g(t1) = t2.
37. (a) The statement is true. Proof. Suppose that A1 = A2. Then A1 and A2 are both n × n
matrices for some positive integer n. Hence the orders of G1 and G2 are n. Let u1, u2, . . . , un
be a labeling of the vertices of G1 that gives the adjacency matrix A1 and let v1, v2, . . . , vn be
a labeling of the vertices of G2 that gives the adjacency matrix A2. Deﬁne f : V (G1) →V (G2)
by f(ui) = vi for 1 ≤i ≤n. Since A1 = A2, two vertices ui and uj are adjacent in G1 if and
only if vi and vj are adjacent in G2. Hence G1 ∼= G2.
(b) The statement is false. Let G2 and G3 be the paths P3 where V (G2) = {u1, u2, u3} and
V (G3) = {v1, v3, v2} such that u2 and v3 have degree 2.

7. (a) Proof. Suppose that P = (u = v0, v1, v2, v3, v4 = v) is a u −v path of length 4 in G. If
uv ∈E(G), then P together with the edge uv forms a 5-cycle in G, which is impossible since
G is bipartite and contains no odd cycle. Therefore, uv /∈E(G).
(b) If u and v are two vertices in a connected bipartite graph G such that there is a u −v path
of length 2k in G for some integer k, then uv /∈E(G).
9. To compute A2, observe that deg v1 = deg v4 = 2 and deg v2 = deg v3 = 3. For i ̸= j, the
(i, j)-entry of A2 is the number of diﬀerent vi−vj paths of length 2. Thus A2 =

13. Consider the graph consisting of the two components C3 and C4.
15. Suppose that the order of G1 is at most 3, the order of G2 is at most 3 and the order of G3 is
at most 5. Then the order of G is at most 3 + 3 + 5 = 11, which is impossible.
17. Let x, y ∈V (G). If one of x and y is v, say x = v, then x is adjacent to y and so (x, y) is a
path. If neither x nor y is v, then v is adjacent to x and y and so (x, v, y) is an x −y path.
19. Yes.
21. (a) ug(G1) = ug(G2) = K6 and ug(G3) = G3. (b) G = K2,3. (c) G = C5. (d) Yes.
23. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that Kn, n ≥3, is bipartite. Then there is partition of the
vertex set of Kn into two subsets U and W such that no two vertices of U are adjacent and no
two vertices of W are adjacent. By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of U and W contains
at least two vertices, say U contains at least two vertices. Since every two vertices of U are
adjacent, this is a contradiction.
25. The size of Cn is n(n −3)/2.
27. Proof. If G is not bipartite, then we have the desired result. Thus, we may assume that G
is bipartite. Let V1 and V2 be the two partite sets of G. Since the order of G is at least 5, at
least one of V1 and V2 contains 3 or more vertices, say |V1| = k ≥3. Since the subgraph of G
induced by V1 is the complete graph Kk and k ≥3, it follows that G contains a triangle. By
Theorem 12.31, G is not bipartite.
29. (a) Note that if G −X is 2-regular, then G −Y is 1-regular, where Y = E(G) −X. (b) No.
31. If v is a cut-vertex of G, then G −v is disconnected. Show that G −v = G −v is connected.
33. Proof. Since e = uv is an edge, G contains the u −v path P = (u, v). We show that P is
the only u −v path in G. Assume, to the contrary, that G contains another u −v path P ′.
Observe that P ′ ̸= P and so the path P ′ contains at least three vertices. Since u and v are the
end-vertices of P ′ and P ′ is a path, it follows that u, v /∈V (P ′)−{u, v} and so e /∈E(P ′). Thus
P ′ together with e = uv form a cycle containing e. Since e is a bridge in G, a contradiction to
Theorem 12.36 is produced.
35. Proof. If v is a cut-vertex in a connected graph G, then, of course, G −v contains two or
more components. If u and w are vertices in distinct components of G −v, then u and w are
not connected in G −v. On the other hand, u and w are necessarily connected in G. Thus
v lies on every u −w path in G. For the converse, suppose that there are two vertices u and
w distinct from v such that v lies on every u −w path in G. Then there is no u −w path in
G −v. Thus u and w are not connected in G −v and so G −v is disconnected. Therefore, v
is a cut-vertex of G.
37. (a) Suppose that G contains distinct vertices u and v such that G−u and G−v are connected.
To show that G itself is connected, show that every two vertices of G are connected. Let x
and y be two vertices of G. Consider the two cases.
Case 1. {x, y} ̸= {u, v}, say u /∈{x, y}. Case 2. {x, y} = {u, v}, say x = u and y = v.
For the converse, let u and v be two vertices of G such that d(u, v) = diam(G). Show, by
contradiction, that G −u and G −v are both connected.
(b) The statement is false. Consider G = P5.

1. (a)-(b) No. (c) This provides a somewhat diﬀerent solution of the K¨onigsberg Bridge Problem.
3. Proof. Assume ﬁrst that G contains an Eulerian trail T . Thus T is a u −v trail for some
distinct vertices u and v. We now construct a new connected graph H from G by adding a
new vertex x of degree 2 and joining it to u and v. Then C = (T, x, u) is an Eulerian circuit in
H. Thus, every vertex of H is even and so only u and v have odd degrees in G = H −x. For
the converse, we proceed in a similar manner. Let G be a connected graph containing exactly
two vertices u and v of odd degree. We show that G contains an Eulerian trail T , where T
is either a u −v trail or a v −u trail. Add a new vertex x of degree 2 to G and join it to u
and v, calling the resulting graph H. Therefore, H is a connected graph all of whose vertices
are even. Thus H is an Eulerian graph containing an Eulerian circuit C. Since it is irrelevant
which vertex of C is the initial (and terminal) vertex, we assume that C is an x −x circuit.
Since x is incident only with the edges ux and vx, one of these is the ﬁrst edge of C and the
other is the ﬁnal edge of C. Deleting x from C results in an Eulerian trail T of G that begins
either at u or v and ends at the other.

vertex of G1 in G has degree r1 +n2 +n3, which is even, (2) every vertex of G2 in G has degree
r2 + n1 + n3, which is even and (3) every vertex of G3 in G has degree r3 + n1 + n2, which is

11. If s = t, then Ks,t is an s-regular graph of order n = 2s. Since s = n

rem 12.59 that Ks,t is Hamiltonian. For the converse, assume that s ̸= t, say s < t, and apply
Theorem 12.57.
13. Proof.
Since G is Hamiltonian, G contains a Hamiltonian cycle Cn = (v1, v2, . . . , vn, v1).
Assume, to the contrary, that G ̸= Cn, then there is an edge e = vivj where |i −j| ≥2 and
G −e is still Hamiltonian. This is a contradiction.
15. The statement is false. Consider G = Cn for n ≥5.
Section 12.5

sets of G. Necessarily, u and v belong to the same partite set of G and so every u −v path

11. The order is 10 and the size is 34.
13. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a graph G of order 2k + 1 such that k vertices
of G have degree k and the remaining k + 1 vertices have degree k + 1. Observe that for any
integer k, either k or k + 1 is odd. In each case, G has an odd number of odd vertices, which
is impossible.

25. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is a graph G of order n that contains a double odd
vertex u and a mixed vertex v. Then degG u + degG u = n −1. Since degG u + degG u is even,
it follows that n is odd. On the other hand, degG v + degG v = n −1. Since degG v + degG v
is odd, it follows that n is even, which is impossible.

for every vertex v of G. Assume,
to the contrary, that G contains at least three components. Then G contains a component G1
of order at most n/3. Let v ∈V (G1). Then deg v ≤(n/3) −1 = (n −3)/3, contradicting the
fact that that δ(G) ≥(n −2)/3.

31 (a) See Figure 24. (b) Let Gn be the graph of order n. Necessarily, G must contain a vertex
of each of the degrees 1, 2, . . . , n −1 and one other vertex having one of these degrees. There
can be only one vertex of degree n −1, for otherwise, there are no vertices of degree 1. Hence
Gn has exactly one isolated vertex. In fact, the degrees of Gn are 0, 1, 2, . . ., n−2. If we delete
the isolated vertex from Gn, then we obtain the graph Hn of order n −1 containing a vertex
of each of the degrees 1, 2, . . ., n −2 and one vertex of one of these degrees. This is Gn−1.

33. (a) Proof. Let P be a longest path in G. Suppose that P is a u −v path. Since P is a longest
path in G, every vertex adjacent to u must lie on P. Hence P contains at least δ + 1 vertices
and so its length is at least δ.
(b) Proof. Let P be a longest path in G, say P = (u = v1, v2, . . . , vk = v). Let j be the largest
integer such uvj ∈E(G). Then j ≥δ. The u −vj subpath P ′ of P together with the edge uvj
produces a cycle of length at least δ + 1.
35. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that u is a cut-vertex of G. Then G −u has two or more
components. Let G1 and G2 be two components of G−u such that v ∈V (G1). Let w ∈V (G2).
Then every v −w path in G contains u. This implies that every v −w path is longer than P,
which is a contradiction.

43. Suppose that G1, G2, . . . , Gℓare the components of G −u, where ℓ≥2. We may assume
that v ∈V (G1). Let w ∈V (G2). Since every v −w path in G contains u, it follows that
d(v, w) > d(u, v) = k.
45. The graph G is Eulerian.
47. (a) Proof. Since deg v ≥1, it follows that deg u −deg v ≤n −2. Thus deg u −deg v = n −2,
which implies that deg u = n −1 and deg v = 1. Since deg u is odd, n = deg u + 1 is even.
(b) Let G be the graph obtained from K5 by adding a new vertex v and joining v to a vertex
u of K5.
49. (a) Proof. Let G be an Eulerian graph. For each vertex v in G, deg v = 2k for some integer
k. If k = 2ℓis even, then deg v = 4ℓand deg v ≡0 (mod 4); while if k = 2ℓ+ 1 is odd, then
deg v = 4ℓ+ 2 and deg v ≡2 (mod 4).

17. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that there is such a tree T . Let x be the number of vertices of
degree 1 in T . Then there are 100−x vertices of degree 5. By Theorem 13.12, x = 2+3(100−x).
Solving for x, we obtain x = 75.5, which is impossible.
19. (a) Let ∆(T ) = k ≥3 and let ni be the number of vertices of degree i in T , where 2 ≤i ≤k.
Since ∆(T ) = k, it follows that nk ≥1. Therefore, by Theorem 13.12, n1 = 2 + n3 + 2n4 +
· · · + (k −2)nk ≥2 + (k −2)nk ≥2 + nk ≥3.
(b) If T has exactly two end-vertices, then ∆(T ) ≤2 by (a) and so T is a path.
21. Proof. It is clear that if G = Pn = (u = v1, v2, . . . , vn = v), then d(u, v) = n −1.
For
the converse, suppose that G contains two vertices u and v with d(u, v) = n −1.
Then
G contains a u −v path Q of length n −1, say Q = (u = u1, u2, . . . , un = v). Since the
order of G is n, it follows that V (Q) = V (G). Assume, to the contrary, that G ̸= Q. Then
there is e ∈E(G) −E(Q), say e = uiuj where 1 ≤i < j and j −i ≥2. However then,
Q′ = (u = u1, u2, . . . , ui, uj, . . . , un = v) is a u −v path of length at most n −2. This implies
that d(u, v) ≤n −2, which is a contradiction.

9. Suppose that the maximum weight of an edge of G is k. Construct a new weighted graph G′

spanning tree of G′ is a maximum spanning tree of G.
11. 60 for G1 and 512 for G2.
13. Proof. Let T be a minimum spanning tree of G. First, assume that T is the unique minimum
spanning tree of G. Assume, to the contrary, that there exist edges e and f of G such that (1)
e ∈E(G) −E(T ), (2) f is on the cycle of T + e and (3) w(f) ≥w(e). Then T ′ = T + e −f
is a spanning tree of G with w(T ′) = w(T ) + w(e) −w(f) ≤w(T ), which implies that either
T ′ is another minimum spanning tree of G or T is not a minimum spanning tree of G, a
contradiction. For the converse, assume that the weight of each edge e ∈E(G)−E(T ) exceeds
the weight of every edge on the cycle of T + e. Then by Kruskal’s algorithm, T be a minimum
spanning tree of G. We claim that T is unique, for otherwise, let T ′ ̸= T be another minimum
spanning tree of G. So w(T ′) = w(T ). Let e′ ∈E(T ′) −E(T ) and let C′ be the cycle in
T + e′. By our assumption, w(e′) > w(f ′) for every edge f ′ in C′. Thus let f ′ ∈E(C) and so
w(T ′) = w(T ) + w(e′) −w(f ′) > w(T ) = w(T ′), which is a contradiction.

13. Can ﬁve houses be connected to two utilities without any of the utility lines crossing? The
answer is yes as K2,5 is planar.
15. K1,t (t ≥1) and K2,t (t ≥2).
17. (a) True. (b) Kk.
19. Only G1 and G4 are planar. Each of G2 and G3 contains a subdivision of K3,3.
21. (a) Proof. Let R1, R2, . . . , Rr be the r regions of G. So if mi is the number of edges on the
boundary of Ri (1 ≤i ≤r), then mi ≥5. Let M = Pr
i=1 mi ≥5r. The number M counts an
edge once if the edge is a bridge and counts it twice if the edge is not a bridge. So M ≤2m.
Therefore, 5r ≤M ≤2m and so 5r ≤2m. Applying the Euler Identity 2 = n −m + r to G,
we have 10 = 5n −5m + 5r ≤5n −5m + 2m = 5n −3m. Solving for m, we get m ≤5
3(n −2).
(b) The smallest cycle in the Petersen graph is a 5-cycle.
(c) The statement is true. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that G has no vertex of degree
2 or less and so δ(G) ≥3. Then 2m ≥3n or m ≥3
2n. On the other hand, m ≤5
3(n −2)
by (a). Therefore, 3
2n ≤m ≤5
3(n −2) and 3
2n ≤5
3(n −2), which implies that n ≥20, a
contradiction.

1. χ(G) = 3. Examples of k-colorings of G for 3 ≤k ≤7 are shown in Figures 34(a)-(e).
3. (a) See Figure 35. (b) χ(G) = 3.
(c) This tells us that the smallest number of colors needed to color the regions of M is 3.
5. This is not a proof. The fact that a planar graph G does not contain K5 as a subgraph and
χ(K5) = 5 does not mean that χ(G) ≤4.
7. False. Consider G = K5.

Figure 35: The graph G in Exercise 3(a)
15. (a) We employ ﬁnite induction (see Exercise 27 in Supplementary Exercises for Chapter 4).
We show, by this algorithm, that every vertex of a graph G of order n can be colored with
one of the colors 1, 2, . . ., 1 + ∆, where ∆= ∆(G). The vertex v1 is colored 1; so the basis
step is true. We now verify the inductive step. Assume, for an integer k with 1 ≤k < n, that
each of the vertices v1, v2, . . . , vk can be assigned one of the colors 1, 2, . . . , 1 + ∆such that
adjacent vertices are colored diﬀerently. Consider the vertex vk+1. Since deg vk+1 ≤∆, the
vertex vk+1 is adjacent to at most ∆vertices. Even if all of these vertices have been assigned
distinct colors, there is at least one color among 1, 2, . . ., 1 +∆that has not been used to color
the vertices adjacent to vk+1. Select the smallest unused color and assign this color to vk+1.
Hence all of the vertices v1, v2, . . . , vk+1 are colored with 1, 2, . . . , 1 + ∆in such a way that
adjacent vertices are colored diﬀerently. This veriﬁes the inductive step. By the Principle of
Finite Induction, all of the vertices of G can be colored with 1, 2, . . ., 1 + ∆so that adjacent
vertices are colored diﬀerently. Therefore, χ(G) ≤1 + ∆(G).
(b) χ(G) = 4. This algorithm produces a 4-coloring c of G deﬁned by c(v1) = 1, c(v2) = 1,
c(v3) = 2, c(v4) = 3, c(v5) = 2, c(v6) = 4. (c) No.
17. Yes. This situation can be modeled by a graph whose chromatic number equals to the minimum
number of time periods needed.
19. 4.
21. The statement is true. Proof. Let c be a k-coloring of G and let Vi be the set of vertices
colored i for 1 ≤i ≤k.
Assume, to the contrary, that there are i, j ∈{1, 2, . . . , k} such
that no two adjacent vertices of G are colored i and j, say i = k −1 and j = k. Then the
(k −1)-coloring c′ of G deﬁned by c′(v) = c(v) if v ∈Vi and 1 ≤i ≤k −1 and c′(v) = k −1 if
v ∈Vk is a proper (k −1)-coloring of G, which is impossible.
23. Since G is a subgraph of G×K2, it follows that χ(G) ≤χ(G×K2). To show that χ(G×K2) ≤
χ(G), suppose that χ(G) = k and let c be a k-coloring of G, using the colors 1, 2, . . . , k. The
graph G×K2 is constructed from two copies G and G′ of G, where uu′ is an edge of G×K2 if u′
corresponds to u in G. Let u′ be colored i+1 if u is colored i (1 ≤i ≤k −1) and color u′ with
the color 1 if u is colored k. This produces a k-coloring of G × K2 and so χ(G × K2) ≤χ(G).
Therefore, χ(G × K2) = χ(G).

1. (a) True. (b) False.
3. (a) False. (b) True.
5. (c).
7. Proof. Let G be a maximal planar graph of order n ≥4 and size m. Then m = 3n −6.
Assume, to the contrary, that δ(G) ≤2. Let v ∈V (G) with deg v = δ(G). Then G −v has
order n−1 and size m′ ≥m−2. Furthermore, G−v is planar. Thus m−2 ≤m′ ≤3(n−1)−6.
Therefore, m ≤3n −7, a contradiction.
9. False.
11. 3.
13. (a) Let G be a nonempty graph and let H be a graph obtained from G by subdividing a
single edge xy of G. Suppose that xy is replaced by two edges xz and zy in H. Suppose that
χ(G) = k and let there be a k-coloring of G with the colors 1, 2, . . ., k. By assigning z the color
k + 1, a (k + 1)-coloring of H is obtained, which implies that χ(H) ≤k + 1. Next, suppose
that χ(H) = k and let c be a k-coloring of H with the colors 1, 2, . . ., k. If the edges xz and zy
are replaced by xy and x is assigned the color k + 1, then a (k + 1)-coloring of G is produced,
which implies that χ(G) ≤k + 1. Therefore, |χ(G) −χ(H)| ≤1.
(b) (i) Let G = P2 and H = P3. (ii) Let G = C3 and H = C4. (iii) Let G = C4 and H = C5.
15. 3.

19. (a) Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that G contains K3,3 as a subgraph. Let v be the vertex
of G that is not a vertex of K3,3. Then G −v contains K3,3 as a subgraph and so G −v is
nonplanar, which is a contradiction.
(b) Let G be a subdivision of K5 or a subdivision of K3,3 of order 7.
21. Yes.
23. Nonplanar.
25. Proof. Assume, to the contrary, that χ(G) = 3. Then each vertex that is colored 3 is adjacent
only to vertices colored 1 or is adjacent only to vertices colored 2. Let V1 be the set of vertices
colored 3 and are adjacent only to vertices colored 1 and let V2 be the set of vertices colored 3
and are adjacent only to vertices colored 2. Now change the color of each vertex of V1 to 2 and
change the color of each vertex of V2 to 1. The resulting coloring is a 2-coloring, contradicting
our assumption that χ(G) = 3.
27. χ(H) = k.
Chapter 15. Directed Graphs
Section 15.1
1. V (D) = {P, Q, R} and E(D) = {(P, R), (Q, P), (Q, R), (R, P)}.
3. (a) V (D) = {M1, M2, M3, M4} and E(D) = {(M1, M3), (M2, M4)}.
5. Proof.
Let a be the number of vertices having indegree 0 and let b be the number of vertices
having outdegree 0. Then there are a vertices having outdegree 2 and n−a−b vertices having
outdegree 1. By the First Theorem of Digraph Theory, P
v∈V (D) od v = a·2+(n−a−b)·1+b·0 =
n + a −b = n. This implies that a = b and so a + b = 2a is even.
7. (a) Suppose that D is a digraph such that od v = 0 or id v = 0 for some vertex v of D. Let
u be a vertex in V (D) −{v}. If od v = 0, then there is no v −u directed path in D; while if
id v = 0, then there is no u −v directed path in D. In either case, D is not strong.
(b) The converse of (a) is false.
9. There are 4 orientations.
11. There are 10 orientations.

13. If (u = v0, v1, v2, . . . , vr = v) is a u −v path in D, then (v = vr, vr−1, . . ., v1, v0 = u) is a
v −u path in ⃗D.
15. (a) Proof. First, let D be an Eulerian digraph. Then D contains an Eulerian circuit C. Let v
be a vertex of C. Assume ﬁrst that v is not the initial vertex of C (and so v is not the terminal
vertex either). Whenever v is encountered on C, an arc is used to enter v and another is used
to exit v. This contributes 1 to both the indegree and outdegree of v. If v is encountered k
times on C, then od v = id v = k. If v is the initial vertex of C, then an arc is used to exit v.
The ﬁnal arc of C enters v. Any other occurrences of v on C contribute 1 to both the indegree
and outdegree of v and so od v = id v in this case as well.
For the converse, let D be a nontrivial connected digraph for which od v = id v for every vertex
v of D. For a vertex u of D, let T be a trail of maximum length with initial vertex u. Suppose
that T is a u −v trail. Assume ﬁrst that u ̸= v and that v is encountered k times on T ,
where k ≥1. Then T contains k arcs directed towards v and k −1 arcs directed away from
v. However, since od v = id v, there is an arc directed away from v that does not belong to
T . This means, however, that T can be extended to a longer trail with initial vertex u. Since
this is impossible, u = v and T is a circuit C in D. Consequently, C is a circuit of maximum
length in D containing u.
We claim that C contains all of the arcs of D and that C is therefore an Eulerian circuit.
Assume, to the contrary, that C does not contain all of the arcs of D. Since D is connected,
there is a vertex w on C that is incident with arcs not on C. Let D′ = D −E(C) be the
spanning subdigraph of D whose arcs are those not belonging to C. Since odD v = idD v and
odC v = idC v for every vertex v on C, it follows that odD′ v = idD′ v for every vertex of D′.
Let T ′ be a trail of maximum length in D′ with initial vertex w. As before, T ′ is a circuit
C′ in D′′. If we attach C′ to C at w, then we produce a circuit C′′ in D containing u and
containing more arcs than C, which is impossible. Hence C is an Eulerian circuit.
(b) Proof. Let m be the size of D. By the First Theorem of Digraph Theory, Pn
i=1 od vi =
Pn
i=1 id vi = m. Thus Pn
i=1(od vi −id vi) = 0. Since od vi ≥id vi for 1 ≤i ≤n, it follows that
od vi −id vi ≥0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Thus od vi −id vi = 0 or od vi = id vi for 1 ≤i ≤n, implying
that D is Eulerian.
(c) Proof. If Pn
i=1 | od vi−id vi| = 0, then | od vi−id vi| = 0 for 1 ≤i ≤n. Thus od vi−id vi = 0
or od vi = id vi for 1 ≤i ≤n. Therefore, D is Eulerian by (a).
17. (a) Proof. The result is true if G contains no bridges. Thus we may assume that G contains
at least one bridge. We consider two cases.
Case 1. G contains exactly one bridge, say e = uv. Then G−e has exactly two components G1
and G2, each of which has a strong orientation. Let Di be a strong orientation of Gi (i = 1, 2).
Then the orientation D of G obtained from D1 and D2 by adding the arc (u, v) has the desired
property.
Case 2.
G contains exactly two bridges, say e = uv and f = xy.
We may assume that
d(v, x) = min{d(z, z′), z ∈{u, v}, z′ ∈{x, y}}. Then G −e −f has exactly three components
G1, G2 and G3, each of which has a strong orientation. Let Di be a strong orientation of Gi
(i = 1, 2, 3). Furthermore, v and x belong to the same component. Suppose that u ∈V (G1),
v, x ∈V (G2) and y ∈V (G3). Then the orientation D of G obtained from D1, D2 and D3 by
adding the arcs (u, v) and (x, y) has the desired property.
(b) For example, no orientation of G = K1,3 has the desired property.
19. Proof. Let P be a longest path in D, say P is a u −v path in D. Since od v > 0 and P is a
longest path, it follows that v is adjacent to a vertex of P, producing a cycle.

5. Let D be the transitive orientation of Kn. Then D contains no cycles but D has a Hamiltonian
path P, say P is a u −v path. Then (u, v) ∈E(D). Then replacing (u, v) by (v, u) results in
a strong digraph.
7. (a) 1. (b) Let T be a tournament of order 3 or more and let u and v be two vertices of T such
that od u = 0 and id v = 0. Let w be any other vertex of T . Thus (w, u) and (v, w) are arcs
in T . Hence od w ≥1 and id w ≥1. (c) None.
9. Suppose that T contains the Hamiltonian cycle C = (v1, v2, . . . , vn, v1). So od v1 ≥od v2 ≥
· · · ≥od vn ≥od v1. This implies that all vertices of T have the same outdegree x. Since
nx =
 n
2

, it follows that x = (n −1)/2 and so n is odd.
11. If (u, v) ∈E(T ), then (v, u) /∈E(T ). Thus ⃗d(u, v) = 1 and ⃗d(v, u) ̸= 1.
13. Proof. Suppose that a tournament T contains a Hamiltonian cycle C = (v1, v2, . . ., vn, v1).
We show that T is strong. Let u and v be any two distinct vertices of T . Then u = vi and
v = vj, where 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤n. We may assume that i < j. Then P = (u = vi, vi+1, . . . , vj = v)
and P ′ = (v = vj, vj+1, . . . , vn, v1, v2, . . . , vi = u) are u−v and v−u paths and so T is strong.
15. (a) In D1, (v1, v2, v3). In D2, (v1, v2, v3). In T1, (v1, v2, v3, v4). In T2, (v2, v1, v3, v4). In T3,
(v1, v2, v3, v4). In T4, (v1, v3, v4, v2). (b) In D2, (v1, v2, v3, v1). In T4, (v1, v3, v4, v2, v1).
17. Proof. Recall that Pn
i=1 od vi = Pn
i=1 id vi; so Pn
i=1(od vi −id vi) = 0. Now

(od vi −id vi) =

(od vi −id vi) + (od vn −id vn) ≥(n −1) + od vn −id vn.
Therefore, id vn −od vn ≥n −1, which implies that id vn = n −1 and od vn = 0. Since
od vn = 0, it follows that T is not strong.
19. Proof. Observe that the indegree of a vertex in T is at most 2r. Let u, v ∈V (T ). We may
assume, without loss of generality, that (u, v) ∈E(T ). It remains to show that T contains
a directed v −u path. Let A be the set of vertices from which u is adjacent and let B the
set of vertices to which v is adjacent. Then 2r −1 ≤|A| ≤2r and 2r −1 ≤|B| ≤2r. If
A ∩B ̸= ∅, then there is w ∈A ∩B and so (v, w, u) is a directed v −u path in T . Hence we
may assume that A ∩B = ∅and so |A| = |B| = 2r −1. If there is an x ∈B and y ∈A ∪{u}
such that (x, y) ∈E(T ), then either (v, x, y, u) or (v, x, y = u) is a directed v −u path in T ;
for otherwise, every vertex in A ∪{u, v} is adjacent to every vertex in B. Thus, each vertex in
B has indegree at least 2r + 1, which is a contradiction.
21. Proof. Let C = (v1, v2, . . . , vn−1, v1) be a cycle of order n −1 in T and let v ∈V (C′) such
that v /∈V (C). Since v ∈V (C′), it follows that od v > 0 and id v > 0. Thus v is adjacent to
some vertex of C and is adjacent from another vertex of C. Assume, without loss of generality,
that (v1, v) ∈E(T ). Since od v > 0, there exists a vertex vi ∈V (C) (i ≥2) such that (v, vi) ∈
E(T ). Thus there exists j with 1 ≤j ≤n −2 such that (vj, v), (v, vj+1) ∈E(T ). Therefore,
(v1, v2, . . . , vj, v, vj+1, . . . , vn−1, v1) is an Hamiltonian cycle of T and so T is Hamiltonian.

Figure 39: The state digraph for the ﬁnite-state machine in Exercise 13
15. (a) Since the digraph D is strong, aperiodic (it has directed cycles of lengths 2 and 3) and
has uniform outdegree, it follows by the Road Coloring Theorem that D has a synchronized
coloring. (b) Suppose that the the coloring of D is synchronized. Then there is a synchronized
sequence s for u. Applying this sequence to u results in a directed u −u walk. Because of
the symmetry of this coloring, when s is applied to v, a directed v −v walk is produced,
contradicting the assumption that s is a synchronized sequence for u. (c) (i). (d) Yes.
17. (a) Since the digraph D is a strong, aperiodic digraph and has uniform outdegree, it follows
by the Road Coloring Theorem that D has a synchronized coloring. (b) (i) is not. (c) Yes.
19. The sequence s′ constructed by following s by s is a synchronized sequence for v.

ANSWERS AND HINTS TO ODD-NUMBERED EXERCISES
Supplementary Exercises for Chapter 15
1. (b).
3. Proof. Suppose that the order of D is n. The vertices of D can be labeled as v1, v2, . . . , vn
so that r(vi) = i for 1 ≤i ≤n. Necessarily, D contains no directed cycle, for otherwise, if
u and v belong to a cycle, then r(u) = r(v), which is impossible. We show that D contains
the Hamiltonian path (vn, vn−1, . . . , v2, v1). Suppose that it does not. First, we claim that
(vn, vn−1) ∈E(D). Suppose that this is not the case. Since r(vn) = n, there is a directed
vn −vn−1 path P in D such that P has an internal vertex x. Since x can reach every vertex
that vn−1 can reach, r(x) ≥r(vn−1), which is impossible. Thus, as claimed, vn is adjacent
to vn−1 in D.
Let k be the largest positive integer such that (vk, vk−1) /∈E(D).
Then
k ≤n −1. Since D contains no directed cycle, D contains no directed path from vk to any
of the vertices vn, vn−1, . . . , vk+1. Thus vk cannot reach any of vn, vn−1, . . . , vk+1 and must
reach all of v1, v2, . . . , vk−1. Hence D contains a vk −vk−1 path with an internal vertex vj such
that (vk, vj) is a directed edge and 1 ≤j ≤k −2. Since D contains a directed vj −vk−1 path
and r(vk−1) = k −1, it follows r(vj) ≥k −1, which is a contradiction. Thus D contains the
Hamiltonian path (vn, vn−1, . . . , v2, v1).
5. The statement is false.
7. Yes.
9. Proof. Let A be the set of vertices of T to which v is adjacent. Then |A| = od v. We claim
that there is x ∈A such that (x, u) ∈E(T ) and so (u, v, x, u) is a triangle. If (u, w) ∈E(T )
for all w ∈E(T ), then od u ≥|A| + 1 = od v + 1 > od v, which is impossible.
11. T1 is transitive, T2 is neither.
13. The statement is false.
15. (a) is true.
17. k = 2. Observe that od vi = n −1 −id vi for i = 1, 2, . . ., n −1.
19. Suppose that u and v do not lie on a common cycle.
Show that if (u, v) ∈E(T ), then
od u > od v.
21. T is transitive.
23. (a) (i) u1. (ii) v1. (iii) u2. (iv) v2. (v) u3. (vi) v3. (b) The sequence brbr is a synchronized
sequence for u4. The sequence rbrb is a synchronized sequence for v4.
