Preface
The word radio means techniques that are used in transmitting and receiving
information or power in the atmosphere or free space, or in transmission
lines utilizing electromagnetic waves—so-called radio waves—but also the
equipment needed therein.
This book provides the reader with the basics in radio engineering,
the techniques needed to generate, control, detect, and use radio waves. The
text approaches the relevant problems both from the electromagnetic theory
based on Maxwell’s equations and from the circuit theory based on Kirchoff
and Ohm’s laws. Brief introductions to the electromagnetic theory as well
as to the circuit theory are provided. Besides passive transmission lines and
components, active RF circuits are also addressed. The treatment of the
fundamentals of antennas and radio wave propagation in this book leads
the reader to radio systems with noise and modulation considerations. Finally,
a broad range of applications are described in addition to various wireless
communication applications: radionavigation, radar, radiometry, remote
sensing, radio astronomy, RF sensors, power and medical applications, and
electronic warfare. The book ends with a short review of biological effects
and safety standards. While numerous books specializing in various topics
of radio engineering are available, this book gives a well-balanced, general
overview of the whole topic. To the authors’ knowledge, there are no similar
books available.
This book got its origin from course lectures on the same topic at the
Helsinki University of Technology. When we found that the Finnish text
of our book (which was first published in 1992) written for our students
xv

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
became very popular in the well-known Finnish wireless industry, we decided
to write a similar book in English in order to provide an overview of
this important technology to engineers, managers, sales representatives, and
administrators globally.
In order to take full advantage from the contents of this book, one
needs a solid background in physics and mathematics. The text can be used
also without this background to obtain a general understanding of radio
engineering, especially in Chapters 1, 12, and 13, and partly in Chapters 9,
10, and 11.

Introduction to Radio Waves and
Radio Engineering
Electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum with the speed of light,
c = 299,792,458 m/s or about 3 × 108 m/s. The electric and magnetic fields
of a plane wave oscillate in phase and are perpendicular to each other and
to the direction of propagation. The frequency of oscillation is f, and the
wavelength is l = c/f. Electromagnetic waves also may be considered to
behave like particles of zero rest mass. The radiation consists of quanta,
photons that have an energy of W = hf where h = 6.6256 × 10−34 Js is
Planck’s constant.
There are many sources of electromagnetic radiation. Accelerating
charges produce electromagnetic radiation, as when charges decelerating in
an electric field produce bremsstrahlung and charges orbiting in a magnetic
field produce synchrotron radiation. The random thermal motion of charged
particles in matter produces thermal radiation. Atoms and molecules emit
spectral line radiation as their energy level changes. The radiation generated
by oscillators and emitted by antennas is based on high-frequency alternating
currents.
1.1 Radio Waves as a Part of the Electromagnetic
Spectrum
Electromagnetic waves cover a wide range of frequencies or wavelengths, as
shown in Figure 1.1. The classification is based mainly on the sources of

radiation. Boundaries of the ranges are not sharp, since different sources
may produce waves in overlapping ranges of frequencies. The wavelengths
of radio waves range from thousands of kilometers down to 0.1 mm. The
frequency range is from a few hertz up to 3 THz. The waves having shorter
wavelengths or higher frequencies than radio waves are classified as infrared,
visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. Infrared waves are produced
by molecules and hot bodies, light and ultraviolet waves by atoms and
molecules, and x-rays by the inner electrons in atoms. Commercial x-ray
tubes emit bremsstrahlung. Gamma rays originate in the nuclei of atoms
and overlap the upper part of the x-ray spectrum.

Introduction to Radio Waves and Radio Engineering
The spectrum of radio waves is divided into ranges having a width of
one decade, as indicated in Table 1.1 and Figure 1.1. Waves below 300
MHz are often called radio frequency (RF) waves. Ultrahigh frequency (UHF)
and superhigh frequency (SHF) waves (300 MHz to 30 GHz) are called
microwaves. Often the boundary between RF waves and microwaves is set
to 1 GHz. The microwave range is further subdivided into bands according
to waveguide bands, as shown in Table 1.2. Extremely high frequency (EHF)
range is called the millimeter-wave range and the frequency range from
300 GHz to 3,000 GHz the submillimeter-wave range.
The interaction of electromagnetic waves with matter depends on the
energy of photons. In general, shorter waves corresponding to energetic
photons interact more strongly than longer waves. The photons of radio
waves have low energies; for example, at 1,000 GHz the energy is only
4 × 10−3 eV (1 eV = 1.6 × 10−19 Ws = 1.6 × 10−19 J). The energy needed
to ionize molecules in biological tissue is at least 12 eV. Thus, ultraviolet

and radiation having even shorter wavelengths can ionize and dissociate
molecules of biological tissues. Radio waves can only heat these materials.
For example, water molecules are polar, and an electric field turns them
back and forth, thus warming the food in a microwave oven.
Human beings gather a lot of information through electromagnetic
waves. The retina of our eyes is sensitive to visible light, that is, wavelengths
from 380 nm to 780 nm. The human skin can sense infrared or thermal
radiation. Other parts of the spectrum cannot be sensed directly; they require
their own specialized techniques to make the information carried by electro-
magnetic waves detectable. This book deals with the basic physics of radio
waves and the techniques, which are needed to generate, transmit, and detect
radio waves.
1.2 What Is Radio Engineering?
Radio engineering covers activities that use the possibilities offered by radio
waves to serve the various goals of people. Some of these useful activities
are:
• Broadcasting;
• Fixed communication (e.g., fixed radio links);
• Mobile communication;
• Radionavigation;
• Radiolocation (e.g., many radar applications);
• Amateur radio;
• Radio astronomy.
Radio engineering also covers the techniques needed to produce, pro-
cess, investigate, measure, and use radio waves that make these services
possible.
Electrical circuits and devices, in which the finite propagation speed
of electric fields has to be taken into account or whose dimensions are of
the same order as a wavelength, often are considered to belong to the field
of radio engineering.
1.3 Allocation of Radio Frequencies
Radio waves have many applications and many users. However, the radio-
frequency spectrum is a limited natural resource. Harmful interference

5
Introduction to Radio Waves and Radio Engineering
between users would take place if everybody sent signals at will. Therefore,
the use of radio frequencies for different applications has been coordinated
internationally.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) was reorganized in
1993. The ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R) comprises the former
Comite´ Consultatif International des Radiocommunications (CCIR) and
International Frequency Registration Board (IFRB), and is responsible for
all of the ITU’s work in the field of radiocommunication. The mission of
ITU-R is to ensure rational, equitable, efficient, and economical use of the
radio-frequency spectrum by all radiocommunication services, and to carry
out studies and adopt recommendations on radiocommunication matters.
Technical matters are drafted in ITU-R study groups and confirmed in
World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) every second or third year.
The use of the radio-frequency spectrum is regulated in the Radio Regulations
[1], which are updated according to the decisions made by WRCs.
In most applications, the use of radio frequencies cannot cause interfer-
ence worldwide. For example, microwaves cannot propagate far beyond the
horizon. For the allocation of frequencies, the world has been divided into
three regions, as shown in Figure 1.2. For example, Region 1 includes Europe,
Russia, Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia.
The radio-frequency spectrum is allocated for about 40 radio services
in the Radio Regulations. Table 1.3 is an extract of the table of frequency
allocation [1] and shows the use of frequency band 10 to 10.7 GHz for
Figure 1.2 Division of world in three regions for frequency allocation. (After: [1].)

primary and secondary services (regional limitations and secondary services
are shown in parentheses).
In addition to the frequency allocation, all radio and other electrical
equipment must comply with the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
requirements and standards to assure interference-free operation [2]. Stan-
dards set limits to the emission of equipment and give requirements for their
immunity against interference.
1.4 History of Radio Engineering from Maxwell to the
Present
The Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879)
predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves. He combined Gauss’ law
for electric and magnetic fields, Ampe`re’s law for magnetic fields, and the
Faraday-Henry law of electromagnetic induction, and added displacement

7
Introduction to Radio Waves and Radio Engineering
current to Ampe`re’s law. He formulated a set of equations, which he published
in 1864. These equations showed the interrelation of electric and magnetic
fields. Maxwell proposed that visible light is formed of electromagnetic
vibrations and that electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths propagating
with the speed of light were possible.
The German physicist Heinrich Hertz (1857–1894) was the first to
prove experimentally the existence of radio waves, thus verifying Maxwell’s
equations [3]. In 1888, he released the results of his first experiments. The
transmitter was an end-loaded dipole antenna with a spark gap. A current
oscillating back and forth was produced as the charged antenna was discharged
across the spark gap. The receiver consisted of a loop antenna and a spark
gap. With this apparatus operating at about 50 MHz, Hertz was able to
show that there are radio waves. Later he showed the reflection, diffraction,
and polarization of radio waves, and he measured the wavelength from an
interference pattern of radio waves.
The first person to use radio waves for communication was the Italian
inventor Guglielmo Marconi (1874–1937). He made experiments in 1895
and submitted his patent application ‘‘Improvements in transmitting electri-
cal impulses and signals and in apparatus therefor’’ in England in 1896. In
1901, Marconi, using his wireless telegraph, succeeded in sending the letter
S in Morse code from Poldhu in Cornwall across the Atlantic to St. Johns
in Newfoundland. Because the distance was over 3,000 km, this experiment
demonstrated that radio waves could be sent beyond the horizon, contrary
to the common belief of that time. The Russian physicist Alexander Popov
(1859–1906) made experiments nearly simultaneously with Marconi. He
demonstrated his apparatus in 1896 to a scientific audience in St. Petersburg.
Hertz used a spark gap between antenna terminals as a receiver. In
1891, the French physicist Edouard Branly (1846–1940) published a better
detector, a coherer. It was based on the properties of small metal particles
between two electrodes in an evacuated glass tube. Both Marconi and Popov
used coherers in their early experiments. The invention of vacuum tubes
was a great step forward toward better transmitters and receivers. In 1904, the
British physicist John Ambrose Fleming (1849–1945) invented the rectifying
vacuum tube, the diode. In 1906 the American inventor Lee De Forest
(1873–1961) added a third electrode, called a grid, and thereby invented
the triode. The grid controlled the current and made amplification possible.
The efficiency of the electron tubes was greatly improved by using concentric
cylinders as electrodes. One of the first inventors was the Finnish engineer
Eric Tigerstedt (1886–1925), who filed his patent application for such a
triode in 1914.

8
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
De Forest and the American engineer and inventor Edwin Armstrong
(1890–1954) independently discovered regenerative feedback in 1912. This
phenomenon was used to produce a continuous carrier wave, which could
be modulated by a voice signal. Armstrong invented also the superheterodyne
receiver. These techniques made broadcasting possible. AM stations began
broadcasting in 1919 and 1920. Regular TV transmissions started in Ger-
many in 1935. Armstrong’s third great broadcasting invention was FM radio,
but FM broadcasting was accepted not until after World War II.
Communication was not the only application of radio waves. Karl
Jansky (1905–1950), while studying radio noise at Bell Labs in 1932, detected
a steady hiss from our own galaxy, the Milky Way. This was the beginning
of radio astronomy. The invention of microwave tubes, of klystron in 1939,
and of magnetron in 1940 was essential for the development of microwave
radar during World War II. The principle of radar had been introduced
much earlier by the German engineer Christian Hu¨lsmeyer (1881–1957),
who made experiments in 1903. Due to the lack of financing, the idea was
abandoned until 1922, when Marconi proposed using radar for detecting
ships in fog.
The Radiation Laboratory, which was established at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during World War II, had a great impact on the
development of radio engineering. Many leading American physicists were
gathered there to develop radar, radionavigation, microwave components,
microwave theory, electronics, and education in the field, and gave written
27 books on the research conducted there.
The rectifying properties of semiconductors were noted in the late
nineteenth century. However, the development of semiconductor devices
was slow because vacuum tubes could do all the necessary operations, such
as amplification and detection. A serious study of semiconductors began in
the 1940s. The high-frequency capabilities of the point-contact semiconduc-
tor diode had already been observed. The invention of the transistor by
Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley started a new era in electronics. Their point-
contact transistor worked for the first time in 1947. The principle of the
bipolar junction transistor was proposed the next year.
The subsequent development of semiconductor devices is a prerequisite
for the radio engineering of today. The continuous development of compo-
nents and integrated circuits has made it possible to pack more complex
functions to an ever-smaller space, which in turn has made possible many
modern systems, such as mobile communication, satellite communication,
and satellite navigation systems.

Fundamentals of Electromagnetic
Fields
In this chapter, we outline the fundamentals of electromagnetic theory that
we will need in the analysis of waveguides, antennas, and other devices. Here
we use the following electric and magnetic quantities:
E, electric field strength [V/m];
D, electric flux density [C/m2 = As/m2];
H, magnetic field strength [A/m];
B, magnetic flux density [Wb/m2 = Vs/m2];
J, electric current density [A/m2];
Js, electric surface current density [A/m];
r, electric charge density [C/m3 = As/m3].
2.1 Maxwell’s Equations
Maxwell’s equations relate the fields (E and H) and their sources (r and J)
to each other. The electric field strength E and the magnetic flux density B
may be considered the basic quantities, because they allow calculation of a
force F, applied to a charge, q, moving at a velocity, v, in an electromagnetic
field; this is obtained using Lorentz’s force law:
F = q(E + v × B)
(2.1)

The electric flux density D and the magnetic field strength H take
into account the presence of materials. The electric and magnetic properties
of media bind the field strengths and flux densities; the constitutive relations
are
D = eE
(2.2)
B = mH
(2.3)
where e is the permittivity [F/m = As/Vm] and m is the permeability [H/
m = Vs/Am] of the medium.

(2.7)
As also mentioned in the above equations, a lot of the knowledge of electro-
magnetic theory was already developed before Maxwell by Gauss, Faraday,
Ampe`re, and others. Maxwell’s contribution was to put the existing knowl-
edge together and to add the hypothetical displacement current, which then
led to Hertz and Marconi’s discoveries and to modern radio engineering.
How did Maxwell discover the displacement current? We may speculate
and simplify this process of invention as follows (see [1], Chapter 18):
Maxwell studied the known laws and expressed them as differential equations
for each vector component, because the nabla notation (curl and divergence
of a vector quantity) was not yet known. Nevertheless, we use the nabla
notation here. He found that while Gauss’ and Faraday’s laws are true in
general, there is a problem in Ampe`re’s law:
= × H = J
(2.8)
If one takes the divergence of this equation, the left-hand side is zero, because
the divergence of a curl is always zero. However, if the divergence of J is
zero, then the total flux of current through any closed surface is zero. Maxwell

correctly understood the law of charge conservation: The flux of current
through a closed surface must be equal to the change of charge inside the
surface (in the volume), that is,
= ? J = −∂r
∂t
(2.9)
In order to avoid the controversy, Maxwell added the displacement current
term, ∂D/∂t, to the right-hand side of Ampe`re’s law in a general case and
got
= × H = J + ∂D
∂t
(2.10)
With this addition the principle of charge conservation holds, because by
using Gauss’ law we obtain
= ? = × H = = ? J + ∂
∂t = ? D = = ? J + ∂r
∂t = 0
The differential equations, (2.4) through (2.7), describe the fields locally
or at a given point. In other words, they allow us to obtain the change of
field versus space or time. Maxwell’s equations in integral form describe how
the field integrals over a closed surface S (rS ) or along a closed loop G (rG )
depend on the sources and changes of the fields versus time. Maxwell’s
equations in integral form are:

where d S is an element vector perpendicular to surface S having a magnitude
equal to the surface element area, d l is a length element parallel to the loop,
and dV is a volume element. The volume, V, is enclosed by the closed surface
S. Equations (2.11) and (2.12) are obtained by applying Gauss’ theorem,
according to which for any vector quantity A it holds

Maxwell’s equations would be symmetric in relation to electric and
magnetic quantities if magnetic charge density rM [Wb/m3 = Vs/m3] and
magnetic current density M [V/m2] were also introduced into them. How-
ever, there is no experimental evidence of their existence.
2.1.1
Maxwell’s Equations in Case of Harmonic Time Dependence
Time harmonic fields, that is, fields having a sinusoidal time dependence at
angular frequency of v = 2pf, may be presented as
A(x, y, z, t) = Re[A(x, y, z)e jvt]
(2.17)
At a given point (x, y, z), the field may be thought to be a vector rotating
on the complex plane and having a constant amplitude, the real part of which
is the field value at a given instant. Most phenomena in radio engineering are
time harmonic or can be thought to be superpositions of several time harmon-
ics. Therefore, in this book we will confine ourselves to the time harmonic
cases. Assuming the e jvt time dependence, the time derivatives can be replaced
by multiplications by jv. For such sinusoidal fields and sources, Maxwell’s
equations in differential form are

where s is the conductivity [S/m = A/Vm] of the medium.
2.1.2
Interpretations of Maxwell’s Equations
Maxwell’s equations may be presented in words as follows:
I
The electric flux (surface integral of the electric flux) through a
closed surface is equal to the total charge within the volume confined
by the surface.
II
The magnetic flux (surface integral of the magnetic flux) through
any closed surface is zero.
III The line integral of the electric field along a closed contour is equal
to the negative time derivative of the magnetic flux through the
closed contour.
IV The line integral of the magnetic field along a closed contour is
equal to the sum of the total current through the closed contour
and the time derivative of the electric flux.
Figure 2.1 illustrates Maxwell’s equations in integral form. These quali-
tative interpretations are as follows:

16
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Figure 2.1 Maxwell’s equations (in integral form).
I
The distribution of the electric charge determines the electric field.
II
The magnetic flux lines are closed; in other words, there are no
magnetic charges.
III A changing magnetic flux creates an electric field.
IV Both a moving charge (current) and a changing electric flux create
a magnetic field.
The creation of an electromagnetic field is easy to understand qualita-
tively with the aid of Maxwell’s equations. Let us consider a current loop
with a changing current. The changing current creates a changing magnetic
field (IV); the changing magnetic field creates a changing electric field (III);
the changing electric field creates a changing magnetic field (IV); and so
on. Figure 2.2 illustrates the creation of a propagating wave.
Maxwell’s equations form the basis of radio engineering and, in fact,
of the whole of electrical engineering. These equations cannot be derived
from other laws; they are based on empirical research. Their validity comes
from their capability to predict the electromagnetic phenomena correctly.
Many books deal with fundamentals of the electromagnetic fields, such as
those listed in [1–8].

2.2 Fields in Media
In the above equations, the permittivity e and permeability m represent the
properties of the medium. A medium is homogeneous if its properties are
constant, independent of location. An isotropic medium has the same proper-
ties in all directions. The properties of a linear medium are independent on
field strength.
In a vacuum, e = e0 ≈8.8542 × 10−12 F/m and m = m0 = 4p × 10−7
H/m. In other homogeneous media, e = er e0 and m = mr m0, where the
dielectric constant er , that is, the relative permittivity, and the relative
permeability, mr , depend on the structure of the material. For air we can
take er = mr = 1 for most applications. In general, in a lossy medium, er
or mr are complex, and in an anisotropic medium er or mr are tensors.
Let us consider a dielectric that has no freely moving charges. The
electric field, however, causes polarization of the material, that is, the electric
dipole moments tend to align along the field. The field induces a dipole
moment into the atoms by disturbing the movement of electrons. The so-
called polar molecules, such as the water molecule, have a stationary dipole
moment, because the charge is distributed unevenly in the molecule.
Electric polarization may be illustrated with a plate capacitor, the plates
of which have an area of A and charges of +Q and −Q. If the fringing field
lines are negligible, the electric flux density is D = Q/A. If there is vacuum
(or air) between the plates, the electric field strength is E0 = D/e0; see

18
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Figure 2.3(a). When a dielectric material is introduced between the plates,
the dipole moments align along the field lines; see Figure 2.3(b). The flux
density does not change if Q does not change, because the charge density
in the dielectric is zero. However, the field strength decreases, because the field
caused by the dipole moments cancels part of the original field. Therefore, the
electric flux density may be written as
D = e0E + Pe
(2.27)
where Pe is a dipole moment per unit volume due to polarization. If a
constant voltage is applied between the plates, the electric field strength stays
constant, and the electric flux density and the charge of the plates increase
when dielectric material is introduced between the plates. In a linear medium,
the electric polarization depends linearly on the field strength
Pe = e0 xe E
(2.28)
where xe is the electric susceptibility, which may be complex. Now
D = e0(1 + xe )E = eE
(2.29)
where
e = e0(1 + xe ) = e0er = e0(er′ −jer″ )
(2.30)
is the complex permittivity. The imaginary part is due to loss in the medium;
damping of the vibrating dipole moments causes heat, because the polar
molecules cannot follow the changing electric flux due to friction.
The loss in a medium may also be due to conductivity of the material.
In this case there are free charges in the material that are moved by the
Figure 2.3 Plate capacitor, which has as its insulator (a) vacuum, and (b) dielectric
material that has electric dipole moments.

electric field. When the conduction current density J = sE is introduced
in Maxwell’s IV equation, one obtains
= × H = [s + jve0(er′ −jer″)]E = jve0Ser′ −jer″ −j
s
ve0DE
(2.31)
which shows that damping due to polarization and damping due to conduc-
tion are indistinguishable without a measurement at several frequencies.
Often s/(ve0) is included in er″. Loss of a medium is often characterized
by the loss tangent
tan d = er″ + s/(ve0)
er′
(2.32)
which allows us to write (2.31) in form
= × H = jve0er′(1 −j tan d)E
(2.33)
In case of magnetic materials, the situation is analogous: The magnetic
field aligns magnetic dipole moments, that is, polarizes the material magneti-
cally. The permeability can be divided into a real part mr′ and an imaginary
part mr″; the latter causes magnetic loss.
The same medium may be considered as a dielectric at a very high
frequency but a conductor at a low frequency. One may argue that a material
is a dielectric if s/(ver′e0) < 1/100 and a conductor if s/(ver′e0) > 100.
Table 2.1 shows conductivity, the real part of the dielectric constant, and
the frequency at which the conduction current is equal to the displacement
current for some media common in nature.

2.3 Boundary Conditions
In electronics and radio engineering we often have electromagnetic problems
where the properties of the medium change abruptly. We have to know the
behavior of fields at such interfaces, that is, we have to know the boundary
conditions. They can be deduced from Maxwell’s equations in integral form.
Let us consider a general interface between the two media presented
in Figure 2.4. Medium 1 is characterized by e1 and m1, and medium 2 by
e2 and m2. In the following, fields normal to the surface (of the interface)
are denoted with subscript n and fields tangential to the surface with
subscript t.
Let us consider a closed contour with dimensions Dl and h as shown
in Figure 2.4. If h approaches 0, we obtain from Maxwell’s III equation,
(2.24):
R
G
E ? d l = E1t Dl −E2t Dl = −jvE
S
B ? d S
which approaches zero because as the area Dlh vanishes, the magnetic flux
through the contour must also vanish. Therefore E1t = E2t, or
n × (E1 −E2) = 0
(2.34)
Next we utilize Maxwell’s IV equation, (2.25)
Figure 2.4 Boundary between two media.

21
Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Fields
R
G
H ? d l = H1t Dl −H2t Dl =E
S
(J + jvD) ? d S
which approaches a value of Js Dl as h approaches zero, because when the
area Dlh vanishes the electric flux through the contour must vanish, but a
current remains due to the surface current density Js at the interface. Now
we obtain
n × (H1 −H2) = Js
(2.35)
Next we consider a ‘‘pillbox,’’ a cylinder also shown in Figure 2.4. Its
dimensions are height h and end surface area DS. Utilizing Maxwell’s I
equation, (2.22), in the case where h approaches 0, we obtain
R
S
D ? d S = D2n DS −D1n DS =E
V
rdV = rs DS
where rs is the surface charge density at the interface. Now we obtain the
following boundary condition:
n ? (D1 −D2) = n ? (e1E1 −e2E2) = rs
(2.36)
Similarly we can derive the following result for the magnetic flux density B
(Maxwell’s II equation):
n ? (B1 −B2) = n ? (m1H1 −m2H2) = 0
(2.37)
In case of an interface between two media, we obtain the following
boundary conditions:
n × (E1 −E2) = 0
(2.38)
n × (H1 −H2) = 0
(2.39)
n ? (D1 −D2) = 0
(2.40)
n ? (B1 −B2) = 0
(2.41)
These equations state that the tangential components of E and H as well
as the normal components of D and B are equal on both sides of the interface,
that is, they are continuous across the interface.

22
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
In radio engineering we often consider a case where we have an interface
with a good conductor. Fields penetrate only a short distance into a good
conductor such as metal and not at all into a perfect conductor (s = ∞).
We often approximate a good conductor with a perfect conductor, which
is lossless. The boundary conditions at the interface of a dielectric and a
perfect conductor are:
n × E = 0
(2.42)
n × H = Js
(2.43)
n ? D = rs
(2.44)
n ? B = 0
(2.45)
Such a boundary is also called an electric wall. Dual to the electric wall is
the magnetic wall, where the tangential component of H vanishes.
2.4 Helmholtz Equation and Its Plane Wave Solution
In a source-free (r = 0, J = 0), linear, and isotropic medium, Maxwell’s
equations are simplified into the following forms:
= ? E = 0
(2.46)
= ? H = 0
(2.47)
= × E = −jvmH
(2.48)
= × H = jveE
(2.49)
When the = × operator is applied on both sides of (2.48), we obtain
in a homogeneous medium
= × = × E = −jvm= × H
(2.50)
which leads, after utilizing vector identity
= × = × A = =(= ? A) −=2A
(2.51)
and (2.46), to
=2E = −v2meE = −k2E
(2.52)

Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Fields
This equation is called the Helmholtz equation, which is a special case of
the wave equation
=2E −me ∂2E
∂t2 = 0
(2.53)
The constant k = v√me is called the wave number [1/m].
Let us first consider propagation of a wave in a lossless medium, where
er and mr are real. Then k is also real. Let us assume that the electric field
has only the x component, that the field is uniform in the x and y directions,
and that the wave propagates in the z direction. The Helmholtz equation
reduces to
∂2Ex
∂z2 + k2Ex = 0
(2.54)
The solution of this equation is
Ex (z) = E +e −jkz + E −e jkz
(2.55)
where E + and E −are arbitrary amplitudes of waves propagating into the
+z and −z directions, respectively. The exact values of E + and E −are
determined by the sources and the boundary conditions. In the time domain,
(2.55) can be rewritten as
Ex (z, t) = E + cos (vt −kz) + E −cos (vt + kz)
(2.56)
where E + and E −are now real constants.
The magnetic field of a plane wave can be solved from (2.49). The
result is
Hy = 1
h (E +e −jkz −E −e jkz)
(2.57)
that is, the magnetic field has a component that is perpendicular to the
electric field and to the direction of propagation. The ratio of the electric
and magnetic fields is called the wave impedance, and it is h = √m/e. In
vacuum h0 = √m0/e0 ≈120pV ≈377V. Figure 2.5 illustrates a plane

themselves periodically in the z direction; the wavelength is
l = 2p
k =

v√me =

(2.58)
The propagation velocity of the wave is
v = f l =

(2.59)
In a vacuum, the propagation velocity is the speed of light:
v = c =
1
√m0e0
≈2.998 × 108 m/s
(2.60)
In a lossy medium having conductivity s, Maxwell’s III and IV equa-
tions (the curl equations) are
= × E = −jvmH
(2.61)
= × H = sE + jveE
(2.62)
Now the Helmholtz equation gets the following form:
=2E + v2meS1 −j s
veDE = 0
(2.63)

Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Fields
Compared to (2.52), here jk is replaced by a complex propagation constant,
g = a + jb = jv√me√
1 −j s
ve
(2.64)
where a is the attenuation constant and b is the phase constant. In the case
of a plane wave propagating into the z direction, we have
∂2Ex
∂z2 −g2Ex = 0
(2.65)
leading to
Ex (z) = E +e −gz + E −e gz
(2.66)
In the time domain
Ex (z, t) = E +e −az cos (vt −bz) + E −e az cos (vt + bz)
(2.67)
In the case of a good conductor, that is, when s >> ve, we obtain
the propagation constant as
g = a + jb ≈jv√me√

(2.68)
When a plane wave meets a surface of a lossy medium in the perpendicu-
lar direction and penetrates into it, its field is damped into 1/e part over a
distance called the skin depth:
ds = 1
a =√
2
vms
(2.69)
Example 2.1
Find the attenuation of a 4 mm-thick copper layer at 10 GHz.
Solution
At a frequency of 10 GHz the skin depth in pure copper (s = 5.8 × 107
S/m, m = m0) is only 6.6 × 10−7 m. Therefore, at this frequency a uniform

26
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
electromagnetic shield made of pure copper of thickness of 4 mm (= 6 skin
depths) provides an attenuation of about −20 log (1/e)6 ≈6 × 8.68 dB ≈
50 dB.
In a general case, each field component can be solved from the general
Helmholtz equation:
∂2Ei
∂x2 + ∂2Ei
∂y2 + ∂2Ei
∂z2 −g2Ei = 0, i = x, y, z
(2.70)
The solution is found by using the separation of variables. By assuming that
Ei = f (x)g( y)h(z),
f ″
f
+ g″
g + h″
h −g2 = 0
(2.71)
where the double prime denotes the second derivative. The first three terms
of this equation are each a function of one independent variable. As the
sum of these terms is constant (g2), each term must also be constant.
Therefore, (2.71) can be divided into three independent equations of form
f ″/f −gx
2 = 0, which have solutions as shown previously.
2.5 Polarization of a Plane Wave
Electromagnetic fields are vector quantities, which have a direction in space.
The polarization of a plane wave refers to this orientation of the electric
field vector, which may be a fixed orientation (a linear polarization) or may
change with time (a circular or elliptical polarization).
The electric field of a plane wave can be presented as a sum of two
orthogonal components
E = (E1ux + E2uy)e −jkz
(2.72)
where ux and uy are the unit vectors in the x and y direction, respectively.
In a general case this represents an elliptically polarized wave. The polarization
ellipse shown in Figure 2.6(a) is characterized by the axial ratio Emax /Emin ,
tilt angle t, and direction of rotation. The direction of rotation, as seen in

27
Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Fields
Figure 2.6 Polarization of a plane wave: (a) elliptic; (b) linear; (c) clockwise circular; and
(d) counterclockwise circular.
the direction of propagation and observed in a plane perpendicular to the
direction of propagation, is either clockwise (right-handed) or counterclock-
wise (left-handed).
Special cases of an elliptic polarization are the linear polarization, Figure
2.6(b), and circular polarization, Figure 2.6(c, d). If E1 ≠0 and E2 = 0, we
have a wave polarized linearly in the x direction. If both E1 and E2 are
nonzero but real and the components are in the same phase, we have a
linearly polarized wave, the polarization direction of which is in angle
t = arctan (E2 /E1)
(2.73)
In the case of circular polarization, the components have equal ampli-
tudes and a 90° phase difference, that is, E1 = ±jE2 = E0 (E0 real), and the
electric field is
E = E0(ux −juy)e −jkz
(2.74)
or
E = E0(ux + juy)e −jkz
(2.75)

28
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The former represents a clockwise, circularly polarized wave, and the latter a
counterclockwise, circularly polarized wave. In the time domain the circularly
polarized wave can be presented as (clockwise)
E(z, t) = E0[ux cos (vt −kz) + uy cos (vt −kz −p/2)]
(2.76)
and (counterclockwise)
E(z, t) = E0[ux cos (vt −kz) −uy cos (vt −kz −p/2)]
(2.77)
At z = 0, (2.76) and (2.77) are reduced to
E(t) = E0[ux cos vt ± uy cos (vt −p/2)]
(2.78)
2.6 Reflection and Transmission at a Dielectric Interface
Let us consider a plane wave that is incident at a planar interface of two
lossless media, as illustrated in Figure 2.7. The wave comes from medium
1, which is characterized by e1 and m1, to medium 2 with e2 and m2. The
planar interface is at z = 0. The angle of incidence is u1 and the propagation
vector k1 is in the xz-plane. Part E1′ from the incident field is reflected at
an angle u1′ and part E2 is transmitted through the interface and leaves at
an angle of u2.
Figure 2.7 Reflection and transmission of a plane wave in case of an oblique incidence
at an interface of two lossless media: (a) parallel polarization, and (b) perpendic-
ular polarization.

29
Fundamentals of Electromagnetic Fields
According to the boundary conditions, the tangential components of
the electric and magnetic field are equal on both sides of the interface in
each point of plane z = 0. This is possible only if the phase of the incident,
reflected, and transmitted waves change equally in the x direction, in other
words, the phase velocities in the x direction are the same, or
v1
sin u1
=
v1
sin u1′ =
v2
sin u2
(2.79)
where v1 and v2 (vi = v/ki ) are the wave velocities in medium 1 and 2,
respectively. From (2.79) it follows
u1′ = u1
(2.80)
which means the angle of incidence and angle of reflection are equal, and
the angle of propagation of the transmitted wave is obtained from

(2.81)
Let us assume in the following that m1 = m2 = m0, which is valid in
most cases of interest in practice. Then (2.81), which is called Snell’s law,
can be rewritten as

where n1 = √er1 and n2 = √er2 are the refraction indices of the materials.
The reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the polarization
of the incident wave. Important special cases are the so-called parallel and
perpendicular polarizations; see Figure 2.7. The parallel polarization means
that the electric field vector is in the same plane with k1 and the normal n
of the plane, that is, the field vector is in the xz-plane. The perpendicular
polarization means that the electric field vector is perpendicular to the plane
described previously, that is, it is parallel to the y-axis. The polarization of
an arbitrary incident plane wave can be thought to be a superposition of
the parallel and perpendicular polarizations.
In the case of the parallel polarization, the condition of continuity of
the tangential electric field is

(2.84)
The magnetic field has only a component in the y direction. The continuity
of the tangential magnetic field leads to
(E1 −E1′ )√e1 = E2√e2
(2.85)
From (2.84) and (2.85) we can solve for the parallel polarization the

When the angle of incidence is 90°, that is, when the incident wave
approaches perpendicularly to the surface, it holds for r and t that
1 + r = t
(2.88)
In case of the perpendicular polarization, the boundary conditions lead
to
E1 + E1′ = E2
(2.89)
(E1 −E1′ )√e1 cos u1 = E2√e2 cos u2
(2.90)

Transmission Lines and Waveguides
Transmission lines and waveguides carry signals and power between different
devices and within them. We can form many kinds of components, such
as directional couplers and filters, by connecting sections of transmission
lines or waveguides (see Chapters 6 and 7). Usually, lines consisting of two
or more conductors are called transmission lines, and lines or wave-guiding
structures having a single metal tube or no conductors at all are called
waveguides. However, the use of these terms is not always consistent, and
often in analysis a transmission line model is used for a waveguide (see
Section 3.10).
Several types of transmission lines and waveguides have been developed
for various applications. They are characterized by their attenuation, band-
width, dispersion, purity of wave mode, power-handling capability, physical
size, and applicability for integration. Dispersion means the frequency depen-
dence of wave propagation.
Figure 3.1 shows some types of transmission lines and waveguides,
which are briefly described later. The electrical properties of the lines in
Figure 3.1(a–d, f) are explained more detailed later in this chapter; see
also [1–6]. A comparison of the lines in Figure 3.1(a, d, f) is given in
Table 3.1.
A rectangular metal waveguide is a hollow metal pipe having a rectangu-
lar cross section. It has low losses and a high power-handling capability.
Due to its closed structure, the fields are well isolated from the outside
world. A large physical size and difficulty in integrating its components
within the waveguide are the main disadvantages. The usable bandwidth for

the pure fundamental mode TE10 is less than 1 octave. Rectangular metal
waveguides are used for various applications from below 1 GHz up to
1,000 GHz and even higher frequencies.

37
Transmission Lines and Waveguides
The properties of a circular metal waveguide are generally the same as
those of the rectangular metal waveguide. However, the usable bandwidth
for single-mode operation is even narrower, only about 25%. In an oversized
circular metal waveguide, a very low-loss TE01 mode can propagate if the
excitation of other modes can be prevented. (Later in this book we use the
terms ‘‘rectangular waveguide’’ and ‘‘circular waveguide’’ omitting the word
‘‘metal,’’ as is often the practice in the literature.)
A circular dielectric waveguide is made of a dielectric low-loss material.
Bends and other discontinuities in the line radiate easily. For example, an
optical fiber is a dielectric waveguide.
A coaxial line consists of an outer and an inner conductor with circular
cross sections. The space between the conductors is filled with a low-loss
insulating material, such as air or Teflon. The coaxial line has a broad, single-
mode bandwidth from 0 Hz to an upper limit, which depends on the
dimensions of the conductors and may be as high as 60 GHz.
A parallel-wire line consists of two parallel conductors. It cannot be
used at higher frequencies than in the VHF range because it has a high
radiation loss at higher frequencies.
A microstrip line is made on an insulating substrate. The metal layer
on the opposite side of the strip operates as a ground plane. The advantages
of the microstrip line are a broad bandwidth, small size, and a good applicabil-
ity for integration and mass production. The disadvantages are fairly high
losses, radiation due to the open structure, and low power capability. Micro-
strip lines are used up to 100 GHz and even higher frequencies.
A coplanar waveguide has ground-plane conductors on both sides of
a metal strip. All conductors are on the same side of the substrate. Both
series and parallel components can easily be integrated with this line. Coplanar
waveguides are used, for example, in monolithic integrated circuits operating
at millimeter wavelengths.
A fin line is composed of a substrate in the E-plane of a rectangular
(metal) waveguide. The field concentrates in a slot on the metallization of
the substrate. The fin line has a low radiation loss, and components can be
integrated quite easily with this line. Fin lines are used up to 200 GHz.
A suspended stripline has a substrate in the H-plane of a rectangular
waveguide. There is a metal strip on the substrate.
A quasioptical waveguide is made of focusing lenses or mirrors, which
maintain the energy in a beam in free space. Quasioptical waveguides are
used from about 100 GHz up to infrared waves. Other lines become lossy
and difficult to fabricate at such high frequencies.

3.1 Basic Equations for Transmission Lines and
Waveguides
The Helmholtz equation (2.52) is valid in the sourceless medium of a
transmission line or a waveguide. Let us assume that a wave is propagating
in a uniform line along the z direction. Now, the Helmholtz equation is
separable so that a solution having a form of f (z)g(x, y) can be found. The
z-dependence of the field has a form of e −gz. Thus, the electric field may
be written as
E = E(x, y, z) = g(x, y)e −gz
(3.1)
where g(x, y) is the field distribution in the transverse plane. By setting this
to the Helmholtz equation, we get
=2E = =2
xy E + ∂2E
∂z2 = =2
xy E + g2E = −v2meE
(3.2)
where =2
xy includes the partial derivatives of =2 with respect to x and y.
Because similar equations can be derived for the magnetic field, the partial
differential equations applicable for all uniform lines are
=2
xy E = −(g2 + v2me)E
(3.3)
=2
xy H = −(g2 + v2me)H
(3.4)
At first, the longitudinal or z-component of the electric or magnetic
field is solved using the boundary conditions set by the structure of the line.
When Ez or Hz is known, the x- and y-components of the fields may be
solved from Maxwell’s III and IV equations. Equation = × E = −jvmH
may be divided into three parts:
∂Ez /∂y + gEy = −jvmHx
−gEx −∂Ez /∂x = −jvmHy
∂Ey /∂x −∂Ex /∂y = −jvmHz
Correspondingly, = × H = jveE is divided into three parts:

39
Transmission Lines and Waveguides
∂Hz /∂y + gHy = jveEx
−gHx −∂Hz /∂x = jveEy
∂Hy /∂x −∂Hx /∂y = jveEz
From these, the transverse components Ex , Ey , Hx , and Hy are solved
as functions of the longitudinal components Ez and Hz :
Ex =

∂x + jvm ∂Hz

(3.7)
Hy =

In a cylindrical coordinate system, the solution of the Helmholtz
equation has the form of f (z)g(r, f). As above, the transverse r- and
f-components are calculated from the longitudinal components:

In a given waveguide at a given frequency, several field configurations

modes. Every mode has its own propagation characteristics: velocity, attenua-
tion, and cutoff frequency. Because different modes propagate at different
velocities, signals may be distorted due to the multimode propagation. Using
the waveguide at low enough frequencies, so that only one mode—the
dominant or fundamental mode—can propagate along the waveguide, pre-
vents this multimode distortion.
3.2 Transverse Electromagnetic Wave Modes
In lossless and, with a good approximation, in low-loss two-conductor trans-
mission lines, as in coaxial lines, fields can propagate as transverse electromag-
netic (TEM) waves. TEM waves have no longitudinal field components.
TEM waves may propagate at all frequencies, so the TEM mode has no
cutoff frequency.
When Ez = 0 and Hz = 0, it follows from (3.5) through (3.8) that
the x- and y-components of the fields are also zero, unless
g2 + v2me = 0
(3.13)
Therefore, the propagation constant of a TEM wave is
g = ±jv√me = ±j 2p
l = ±jb
(3.14)
The velocity vp is independent of frequency, assuming that the material
parameters e and m are independent of frequency:
vp = v
b =
1
√me
(3.15)
Thus, there is no dispersion, and the TEM wave in a transmission line
propagates at the same velocity as a wave in free space having the same e
and m as the insulator of the transmission line. The wave equations for a
TEM wave are
=2
xy E = 0
(3.16)
=2
xy H = 0

The fields of a wave propagating along the z direction satisfy the
equation

(3.18)
where h = √m /e is the wave impedance.
Laplace’s equations, (3.16) and (3.17), are valid also for static fields.
In electrostatics, the electric field may be presented as the gradient of the
scalar transverse potential:
E(x, y) = −=xy F(x, y)
(3.19)
Because = × =f = 0, the transverse curl of the electric field must vanish in
order for (3.19) to be valid. Here this is the case, because
=xy × E = −jvmHz uz = 0
(3.20)
where uz is a unit vector pointing in the direction of the positive z-axis.
Gauss’ law in a sourceless space states that = ? D = e=xy ? E = 0. From
this and (3.19) it follows that F(x, y) is also a solution of Laplace’s equation,
or

3.3 Transverse Electric and Transverse Magnetic Wave
Modes
A wave mode may have also longitudinal field components in addition to
the transverse components. Transverse electric (TE) modes have Ez = 0 but
a nonzero longitudinal magnetic field Hz . Transverse magnetic (TM) modes
have Hz = 0 and a nonzero Ez .
From (3.4) it follows for a TE mode
=2
xy Hz = −(g2 + v2me)Hz = −k2
c Hz
(3.24)
Correspondingly, for a TM mode
=2
xy Ez = −(g2 + v2me)Ez = −k2
c Ez
(3.25)
The coefficient kc is solved from (3.24) or (3.25) using the boundary condi-
tions set by the waveguide. For a given waveguide, an infinite number of
kc values can usually be found. Each kc corresponds to a propagating wave
mode. We can prove that in the case of a waveguide such as a rectangular
or circular waveguide, in which a conductor surrounds an insulator, kc is
always a positive real number.
The propagation constant is
g = √k2
c −v2me
(3.26)
If the insulating material is lossless, v2me is real. The frequency at which
v2me = kc
2 is called the cutoff frequency:
fc =
kc
2p√me
(3.27)
The corresponding cutoff wavelength is
lc = 2p
kc
(3.28)
At frequencies below the cutoff frequency, f < fc , no wave can propagate.

At frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency, f > fc , waves can

which is larger than the speed v of a plane wave in the same material as the
insulator of the line. The propagation velocity of energy or the group velocity
vg = v√1 −( fc /f )2
(3.33)
is smaller than the speed of the plane wave in this material. Thus, the
propagation velocity of TE and TM waves depends on frequency, and
waveguides carrying these modes are dispersive.
3.4 Rectangular Waveguide
Both TE and TM wave modes may propagate in the rectangular waveguide
shown in Figure 3.4. The longitudinal electric field of a TE mode is zero,
Ez = 0, while for a TM mode the longitudinal magnetic field is zero,
Hz = 0.

From the boundary conditions for the fields in a metal waveguide it
follows that the transverse magnetic field cannot have a normal component
at the boundary, that is, n ? H = 0. It follows from (3.7) and (3.8) that
∂Hz /∂x = 0, when x = 0 or a, and ∂Hz /∂y = 0, when y = 0 or b.
Also, the tangential component of the electric field must vanish at the
boundary or n × E = 0: Ex (x, 0) = 0, Ex (x, b) = 0, Ey (0, y) = 0,
Ey (a, y) = 0.
It results from these boundary conditions that k1a = np and k2b =

In most applications, we use the fundamental mode TE10 having the
lowest cutoff frequency:
fcTE10 =

(3.44)
In the case of an air-filled waveguide, we obtain fcTE10 = c/(2a). The cutoff
wavelength is lc = 2a. If the waveguide width a is twice the height b, a =
2b, the TE20 and TE01 wave modes have a cutoff frequency of 2fcTE10.
The fields of the TE10 wave mode are solved from the Helmholtz
equation and boundary conditions as follows:

For example, at a frequency of 1.5fc , the wave impedance of an air-filled

characteristic for each wave mode.
The characteristic impedance Z0 of a transmission line is the ratio of
voltage and current in an infinitely long line or in a line terminated with a

matched load having a wave propagating only in one direction. However,
we cannot uniquely define the voltage and current of a waveguide as we can
do for a two-conductor transmission line. Therefore, we may have many
definitions for the characteristic impedance of a waveguide using any two
of the following three quantities: power, voltage, current. The characteristic
impedance can be calculated from the power propagating in the waveguide,
Pp given in (3.53), and the voltage U, which is obtained by integrating the
electric field in the middle of the waveguide from the upper wall to the
lower wall, as
Z0TE10 = U 2

Note that the characteristic impedance of the TE10 wave mode depends
on the height b, whereas the wave impedance of (3.50) does not. The
characteristic impedance in (3.51) has been found to be the best definition
in practice when problems concerning impedance matching to various loads
are being solved.

The finite conductivity of the metal, sm , causes loss in the walls of

as

(3.54)
where Pl is the power loss per unit length.

The power loss of conductors is calculated from the surface current
density Js = n × H (n is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface) by
integrating | Js |2Rs /2 over the surface of the conductor. Although in the
preceding analysis the fields of the waveguide are derived assuming the
conductors to be ideal, this method is accurate enough if the losses are low.
The surface resistance of a conductor is Rs = √vm0/(2sm ). The attenuation
constant of conductor loss for the TE10 wave mode is obtained as

Close to the cutoff frequency, the attenuation is high, approaching infinite.
If the dielectric material filling the waveguide has loss, the attenuation
constant of dielectric loss is for all wave modes
ad = p

tan d
√1 −( fc /f )2
(3.56)
The total attenuation constant is a = ac + ad .
The recommended frequency range for waveguides operating at the
TE10 wave mode is about from 1.2 to 1.9 times the cutoff frequency fcTE10.
The increase of attenuation sets the lower limit, whereas the excitation of
higher-order modes sets the higher limit. Hence, we need a large number
of waveguides to cover the whole microwave and millimeter-wave range.
Standard waveguides that cover the 10 GHz to 100 GHz range are listed
in Table 3.2. In most cases a = 2b. Figure 3.6 shows the theoretical attenuation
of some standard waveguides made of copper. In practice, the attenuation
is higher due to the surface roughness.
Example 3.1
Find the maximum power that can be fed to a WR-90 waveguide at 10 GHz.
The maximum electric field that air can withstand without breakdown—the
dielectric strength of air—is about 3 kV/mm.
Solution
The dimensions of the waveguide are a = 22.86 mm and b = 10.16 mm.
From (3.50), the wave impedance of the TE10 wave mode at 10 GHz
(l = 30 mm) is ZTE10 = 500V. By setting E0 = 3 kV/mm into (3.53), we
find the maximum power to be 1.05 MW. Because the attenuation is about

0.1 dB/cm, the power absorbed into the walls of the waveguide is about
240 W/cm at the maximum power. If the load reflects some of the power,
the maximum field strength is due to the standing wave higher than in the
matched case. Then, the maximum power is lower than that calculated
above.

The wave impedance of TM modes is

(3.62)
From boundary conditions it follows that the equations for the cutoff
wavelength and cutoff frequency are the same as those for the TE wave
modes. Now, both indices n and m have to be nonzero. The TM wave
mode having the lowest cutoff frequency is TM11. Although TM11 and
TE11 wave modes have equal cutoff frequencies, their field distributions are
different. Figure 3.7 shows transverse field distributions of some TE and
TM wave modes.

3.5 Circular Waveguide
The analysis of a circular waveguide shown in Figure 3.8 is best carried out
using the cylindrical coordinate system. The principle of analysis is similar
to that of the rectangular waveguide.
The solutions of the longitudinal magnetic fields of the TE wave modes
are
Hz = AJn (kc r) cos (nf)
(3.63)
where Jn is the Bessel function of the order n. From the boundary condition
Hr (r = a) = 0, it follows that ∂Hr /∂r(r = a) = 0, and further that Jn′(kc a)
= 0, in which the apostrophe stands for derivative. From this we get

The subscript n denotes the number of periods in the field distribution
along the f angle. The subscript m gives the number of axial field minima
in the radial direction. Figure 3.9 shows the transverse field distributions of
some wave modes. Table 3.3 gives the cutoff wavelengths of the wave modes
having the lowest cutoff frequencies.
The relative bandwidth of the circular waveguide operating at the
fundamental mode TE11 is smaller than that of the rectangular waveguide
operating at the TE10 mode, as shown in Figure 3.10. Therefore, many
standard waveguide sizes are needed to cover a broad frequency range.
The conductor losses of the circular waveguide are calculated from the
surface currents and surface resistance the same way as in the case of the
rectangular waveguide. A special feature of the TE01 wave mode is that its
attenuation decreases monotonously as the frequency increases. The attenua-
tion constant of the TE01 wave mode is

can propagate in such an oversized waveguide. A low attenuation is achieved
only if the excitation of unwanted modes is prevented.
Example 3.2
Calculate the conductor losses at 60 GHz for the TE01 wave mode in a
circular waveguide made of copper. The radius of the waveguide is (a) 3.5
mm, and (b) 20 mm.
Solution
The surface resistance is
Rs = √pfm0/s
= √p × 60 × 109 × 4p × 10−7/58 × 106 V/m
= 0.064 V/m.
The cutoff frequency of the TE01 wave mode is fc = c /lc = c /(1.64a). (a)
When a = 3.5 mm, fc = 52.3 GHz. From (3.69) we solve the attenuation
constant acTE01 = 0.0753 1/m. The attenuation of a waveguide having a
length l is in decibels 20 log e al, from which we obtain an attenuation of
0.65 dB/m. (b) When a = 20 mm, fc = 9.15 GHz and acTE01 = 1.14 ×
10−3 1/m. The attenuation is now only 0.010 dB/m or 1.0 dB/100m.

3.6 Optical Fiber
TE and TM wave modes may propagate, not only in hollow metal waveguides,
but also in dielectric waveguides. An optical fiber is actually a dielectric
waveguide with a circular cross section, in which total internal reflection
confines light in the fiber. Optical fibers are used in many kinds of communi-
cation networks, usually at wavelengths of 0.8 to 1.6 mm at infrared. The
optical carrier is modulated with data rates up to several gigabits per second.
Optical fibers are made of quartz, glass, or plastic. An optical fiber
consists of a core and a cladding. The index of refraction n = √er of the
core is larger than that of the cladding. The refractive index of the cladding
is adjusted to a proper value by doping quartz with metal oxides as TiO2,
Al2O3, GeO2, or P2O3. Optical fibers can be divided into three types, as
shown in Figure 3.11:
1. Single-mode fiber: core radius 1–16 mm, cladding radius 50–100
mm.
2. Multimode fiber with a step in the index of refraction: core radius
25–60 mm, cladding radius 50–150 mm.
3. Multimode fiber with a continuous change in the index of refraction:
core radius 10–35 mm, cladding radius 50–80 mm.
Figure 3.11 Structures of optical fibers: (a) a single-mode fiber; (b) a multimode fiber with
a step in the refractive index; (c) a multimode fiber with a continuous change
in the refractive index.

57
Transmission Lines and Waveguides
An optical cable is usually made of several optical fibers. Steel wires
and textile fibers as nylon give strength to the cable and support the fibers.
Copper wires carry current for the repeater amplifiers if needed.
The solutions of the longitudinal field components in the core are
Ez = AJn (kr) cos (nf)
(3.70)
Hz = BJn (kr) sin (nf)
(3.71)
The solutions in the cladding are
Ez = CHn (xr) cos (nf)
(3.72)
Hz = DHn (xr) sin (nf)
(3.73)
In these equations, Jn (kr) is the Bessel function of the first kind of order
n; Hn (xr ) is the Hankel function of the first kind of order n; k is the
transverse propagation constant in the core; and x is the transverse propaga-
tion constant in the cladding. Other field components are solved from these
longitudinal fields, as in the case of metal waveguides, except now the
boundary conditions are different, that is, the tangential components of E
and H are continuous at the boundary of two dielectric materials.
From the expressions of longitudinal fields we can see that only cylindri-
cally symmetric (n = 0) wave modes are either TE or TM wave modes.
Other wave modes are hybrid modes, denoted as EH or HE wave modes,
for which both electric and magnetic fields have nonzero longitudinal
components.
In a multimode fiber the number of propagating wave modes may be
very large. The number of modes is approximately [7]
N = 16

(n2
1 −n2
2)a2
(3.74)
where l0 is the wavelength in free vacuum, n1 and n2 are the refractive
indices of core and cladding, respectively, and a is the radius of the core.
Example 3.3
Find the number of wave modes at a wavelength of 1.55 mm in a quartz
fiber having a core radius of 40 mm. The refractive index of the cladding
is 1% lower than that of the core.

58
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Solution
The dielectric constant of quartz is er = 3.8. Hence n1 = √3.8 = 1.95 and
n2 = 0.99 × 1.95 = 1.93. From (3.74) we obtain the number of wave modes,
N = 800.
The loss mechanisms of an optical fiber are:
• Dielectric absorption loss;
• Scattering loss due to the imperfections of the fiber;
• Radiation loss due to the bending of the fiber.
Properties making the optical fiber an excellent transmission medium
for many applications are
• Small size and weight;
• Low attenuation—only 0.2 dB/km at 1.55 mm—allowing cables
hundreds of kilometers long without any repeater amplifiers;
• Immunity to interference and difficulty of interception;
• Reliability;
• Broad bandwidth;
• Low price compared to copper cable.
3.7 Coaxial Line
A coaxial line consists of two concentric conductors with circular cross
sections and insulating material between them, as shown in Figure 3.12.
Figure 3.12 Cross section of a coaxial line.

59
Transmission Lines and Waveguides
The inner radius of the outer conductor is ro and the radius of the inner
conductor is ri ; the relative permittivity of the insulator is er . The fields
are confined to the space between the conductors.
The fields of the TEM wave mode of the coaxial line can be derived
from Laplace’s equation (3.21) using the scalar potential F(r, f). In the
cylindrical coordinate system, Laplace’s equation is written as
1
r
∂
∂rSr ∂F(r, f)
∂r D + 1
r2
∂2F(r, f)
∂f2
= 0
(3.75)
Applying the boundary conditions F(ro , f) = 0 and F(ri , f) = V, the
potential is solved to be
F(r, f) = V ln (ro /r)
ln (ro /ri )
(3.76)
The electric field is the negative gradient of the potential:
E(r, f) = −=F(r, f) = ur
V
ln (ro /ri )

(3.77)
where ur is the unit vector in the radial direction. This is also the electric

h uz × E(r, f) = uf
V
hr ln (ro /ri ) = uf
I
2pr
(3.78)
where h = √m/e is the wave impedance, I is the current in the inner
conductor, and uf is the unit vector perpendicular to the radial direction.
A current I flows also in the outer conductor but to the opposite direction.
The characteristic impedance of the coaxial line is
Z0 = V
I = h
2p ln (ro /ri )
(3.79)
The 50-V characteristic impedance has become a standard value. Most
measurement instruments and thus also most devices have 50-V input and
output connectors.
The attenuation constant due to conductor loss is

(3.80)
For an air-filled coaxial line with a given outer conductor dimension, the
minimum of the attenuation constant is obtained when the characteristic
impedance is Z0 = 77V. The attenuation constant due to dielectric loss is
ad = p
l tan d
(3.81)
Also TE and TM wave modes may propagate in a coaxial line, if the
operating frequency is larger than the cutoff frequency of these wave modes.
To avoid losses and unanticipated phenomena due to these modes, the
operating frequency should be chosen to be low enough. An approximate
rule is that the circumference corresponding to the average radius should be
smaller than the operating wavelength:
l > p(ro + ri )
(3.82)
Consequently, the coaxial lines used at high frequencies should be thin
enough to make sure that only the TEM wave mode may propagate.
Example 3.4
Show that the attenuation constant of an air-filled coaxial line having a fixed
diameter is at minimum when the characteristic impedance is Z0 = 77V.
Solution
According to (3.79) and (3.80) the attenuation constant is proportional to
the quantity
1
roS1 + ro

ln (ro /ri )
Now ro is constant. Let us denote ro /ri = x and derivate with respect of x:

ln x −(1 + x)(1/x)
ln2 x
By setting this derivative equal to zero, we obtain

ln x = 1
x + 1
The solution of this equation is x = ro /ri = 3.591. By substituting this in
(3.79), we obtain Z0 = 76.7V.
3.8 Microstrip Line
A microstrip line consists of a metal strip on one side and a ground plane
on the other side of a substrate, as shown in Figure 3.13. The substrate is
made of a low-loss dielectric material such as polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon),
aluminum oxide (alumina), or quartz.
A pure TEM wave mode can propagate in a microstrip line only if all
fields are in the same medium. Then the solution for the field can be derived
from Laplace’s equation. In a case where the nonstatic fields are in two
different media, the field has also longitudinal components. At low frequen-
cies, or more precisely when l >> h, the fields are nearly the same as those
in a static case, and we call them quasi-TEM. However, the analytical solution
Figure 3.13 The cross section of a microstrip line and the characteristic impedance Z0
as a function of the ratio of strip width to substrate height w/h for different
substrate materials.

62
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
of the quasi-TEM wave mode is complicated and therefore a practical design
of microstrip lines is based on graphs or approximate equations.
The phase constant of a quasi-TEM wave can be expressed as
b = 2p
l = v√me0ereff
(3.83)
where ereff is the effective relative permittivity. This is obtained by measuring
or calculating the capacitance of the line per unit length Ceff and the capaci-
tance of an air-filled but otherwise similar line per unit length C0:
ereff =
Ceff
C0
(3.84)
The designer often knows the required characteristic impedance Z0
and the required length of the line in wavelengths l/l. Then the width of
the strip w and the physical length l have to be determined. Z0 and ereff
depend mainly on the width of the strip w and on the height h and the
relative permittivity er of the substrate. The velocity of the wave and the
wavelength depend on ereff , as given by (3.83). Sometimes the problem is
inverse: The characteristic impedance has to be calculated from the dimen-
sions and permittivity. Approximate design of a microstrip line can be carried
out by using Figure 3.13 or the following equations [8]. These equations
are valid when 0.05 ≤w/h ≤20 and er ≤16.

In the preceding equations, it has been assumed that the thickness t
of the strip is very small. In practice, the capacitance of the line per unit
length will be slightly larger due to the finite thickness t compared to the
case t = 0. This will lower the characteristic impedance. Due to the extra
capacitance, the width of the strip seems to increase by
Dwe = t
p (1 + ln D )
(3.93)
where D = 2h/t, when w/h ≥1/(2p), and D = 4pw/t, when w/h ≤1/(2p).
Equation (3.93) is valid for t < h and t < w/2. Equations (3.86), (3.88),
(3.89), and (3.91) can be used for a strip having a finite thickness by replacing
w by we = w + Dwe .

64
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The sources of losses in a microstrip line are:
• Conductor loss in the strip and ground plane;
• Dielectric and conduction losses in the substrate;
• Radiation loss;
• Surface wave loss.
Assuming a constant current distribution over the strip width, the
attenuation constant due to metal loss is
ac =
Rs
Z0w
(3.94)
The accuracy of this equation is best for a wide strip. In practice, the value
of the surface resistance Rs is larger than the theoretical one. For example,
the surface roughness of the substrate increases Rs . The thickness of the

tion constant due to dielectric loss is

l0
(3.95)
where l0 is the wavelength in free vacuum.
Discontinuities of the microstrip line produce radiation to free space.
For a given line, radiation loss increases rapidly as the frequency increases.
To avoid leakage and interference, microstrip circuits are usually shielded
within a metal case. In microstrip antennas, leaking radiation is harnessed
into use.
Surface waves are waves that are trapped by total reflection within the
substrate. They may produce unwanted radiation from the edges of the
substrate and spurious coupling between circuit elements.
Example 3.5
Find the width of the strip for a 50-V microstrip line. The substrate has a
thickness of h = 0.254 mm and a relative permittivity of er = 9.7. The

65
Transmission Lines and Waveguides
thickness of the strip is t = 5 mm. Find the wavelength in the line at a
frequency of 10 GHz.
Solution
From Figure 3.13 we see that w/h is about 1. Equation (3.90) gives A =
2.124. From (3.89) we solve w/h = 0.985 or w = 0.250 mm. To account
for the effect of the strip thickness, we calculate D = 2h/t = 101.6 and solve
from (3.93) to get Dwe = 0.009 mm. Therefore, the strip width should be
0.250 mm −0.009 mm = 0.241 mm. A 5 mm thick and 0.241 mm
wide strip corresponds to a 0.250 mm wide strip with t = 0. From (3.85)
we obtain ereff = 6.548. The wavelength at f = 10 GHz is l =
c /X f √ereff C = 11.72 mm. (In practice, microstrip lines are dispersive and
ereff increases as the frequency increases. Therefore, l is slightly shorter.)
3.9 Wave and Signal Velocities
In a vacuum, radio waves propagate at the speed of light, c = 299,792,458
m/s. In a medium with parameters er and mr the velocity of propagation is
v =
1
√me =
1
√mr er
c
(3.96)
The phase velocity
vp = v
b
(3.97)
is that velocity with which the constant-phase points of a wave propagate.
In case of a plane wave or a TEM wave propagating in a transmission line,
the phase velocity is equal to the velocity of propagation in free space filled
with the same medium, vp = v. Generally, the phase velocity of a wave
propagating in a waveguide may be smaller or larger than v.
If the phase velocity and attenuation of a propagating wave do not
depend on frequency, the waveform of a broadband signal does not distort
as it propagates. However, if the phase velocity is frequency-dependent, the
waveform will distort. This phenomenon is called dispersion (see Section
3.3).
The group velocity, vg , is that velocity with which the energy of a
narrow-band signal (or signal experiencing no significant dispersion) propa-

gates. The group velocity of a plane wave or a TEM wave is equal to the
velocity of propagation in free space filled with the same medium. For other
wave modes, the group velocity is smaller than v. The group velocity can
never exceed the speed of light. The group velocity is given by [2, 5]

3.10 Transmission Line Model
A transmission line exhibits properties of capacitance, inductance, resistance,
and conductance: The electric field between the conductors contains electric
energy in the same way as a capacitor; the magnetic field produced by the
currents contains magnetic energy as an inductor; the conductors have losses
as a resistor; the leakage currents in the insulator produce losses as a resistor or
a conductor. These properties cannot be separated because they are distributed
along the line. Figure 3.14 shows the transmission line model, a short section
of a transmission line with a length Dz having a series inductance L, a
parallel capacitance C, a series resistance R, and a parallel conductance G,
all being values per unit length.
In the transmission line model, voltages and currents are used instead
of electric and magnetic fields to represent the propagating wave. This
model best suits transmission lines carrying TEM wave modes. However,
the transmission line model may also be applied for other transmission lines
and waveguides by defining the voltage and current properly and by restricting
the analysis for such a narrow band that dispersion may be neglected.
The voltage and current on a transmission line depend on the position
and time, V (z, t) and I(z, t). We can derive for voltage and current the
so-called telegrapher equations:

Impedance Matching
In Chapter 3 we considered homogeneous transmission lines and waveguides
in which a wave propagates only in the z direction. In a homogeneous line
the characteristic impedance is independent of z, and accordingly the ratio
of the electric and magnetic field as well as the ratio of the voltage and
current (in a TEM line) is constant.
If there is a discontinuity in the line disturbing the fields, the impedance
changes and a reflection occurs. The discontinuity may be a change in the
line dimensions or a terminating load, the impedance of which is different
from that of the line. This mismatch of impedances may cause serious
problems. Elimination of the reflection—that is, matching the load to the
line—is a frequent and important task in radio engineering.
In this chapter we first consider the fundamental concepts needed in
impedance matching: the reflection coefficient, input impedance, standing
wave, and the Smith chart. Then we consider different methods of impedance
matching, such as matching with lumped elements, with tuning stubs, with
quarter-wave transformers, and with a resistive circuit.
4.1 Reflection from a Mismatched Load
In the following analysis we will use the transmission line model and use
voltages and currents. In principle we could, of course, use electric and
magnetic fields, but the advantage of using voltages and currents is that the
characteristic impedance of a line is always (by definition) the ratio of the
69

voltage and current, but not always directly the ratio of the electric and
magnetic field [see (3.51)]. In impedance matching it is the characteristic
impedance of the line that matters, not the wave impedance.
Let us consider a situation shown in Figure 4.1 in which the line is
terminated at z = 0 with a load. The characteristic impedance of the line is
Z0 and the impedance of the load is ZL . Let us assume that there is a
voltage wave propagating toward the load, V +e −gz, and the corresponding
current wave is I +e −gz (Z0 = V +/I + ). Then at the input of the load, normally
one part of the propagating wave power is reflected while the other part is
absorbed to the load. The reflected voltage wave is V −e +gz, and the corre-
sponding reflected current wave is I −e +gz (Z0 = V −/I −). V +, I +, V −, and
I −are complex amplitudes. At z = 0 the voltages of the line and those of
the load must be equal, and the same applies of course to the currents:
V + + V −= VL
(4.1)
I + −I −= IL
(4.2)
Note that the directions of positive I + and I −are defined to be opposites.
As ZL = VL /IL , we can present (4.2) as
V +
Z0
−V −
Z0
= VL
ZL
(4.3)
The voltage reflection coefficient of the load is defined as
Figure 4.1 A line terminated with a load.

rL = V −

(4.4)
If we eliminate V −from (4.1) and (4.3), and then solve for rL , we obtain
rL = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
= zL −1
zL + 1
(4.5)
where zL = ZL /Z0 is the normalized load impedance (do not confuse the
normalized impedances with the z coordinate). The voltage transmission
coefficient is
tL = VL
V + = 1 + rL =
2ZL
ZL + Z0
(4.6)
If the load impedance and the characteristic impedance of the line are
equal, there will be no reflected wave but all power will be absorbed into
the load. In such a case the load is matched to the line.
If the load is mismatched or ZL ≠Z0, there will be a wave propagating
in both directions, that is, the voltage and current as a function of z are
V (z) = V +e −gz + V −e +gz
(4.7)
I(z) = I +e −gz −I −e +gz = V +
Z0
e −gz −V −

(4.8)
Let us assume that the length of the line is l. In the following we
consider the load impedance seen through this line. At z = −l the voltage
reflection coefficient is
r(−l ) = V −e −gl
V +e +gl = rL e −2gl
(4.9)
Now the input impedance at z = −l is
Z(−l ) = V (−l )
I(−l ) = Z0
V +e +gl + V −e −gl
V +e +gl −V −e −gl = Z0
1 + rL e −2gl
1 −rL e −2gl = Z0
1 + r(−l )
1 −r(−l )

When substituting (4.5) into (4.10) and taking into account that e x = sinh x
+ cosh x, we obtain
Z(−l ) = Z0
ZL + Z0 tanh gl
Z0 + ZL tanh gl
(4.11)
In practice we use low-loss lines, which means that the attenuation (or
damping) constant is small, often negligible, and then we can assume that
g = jb. In such a case the input impedance is
Z(−l ) = Z0
ZL + jZ0 tan bl
Z0 + jZL tan bl
(4.12)
In a lossless case the line voltage as a function of z is
V (z) = V +e −jbz(1 + rL e 2jbz)
(4.13)
The voltage (or the field strength) repeats itself periodically at every half-
wavelength, so there is a standing wave in the line, as shown in Figure 4.2.
At the maximum, the voltages of the forward and reflected waves are in
the
same
phase,
and
therefore
the
total
amplitude
is
Vmax
=
|V +| + |V −|. At the minimum, the voltages are in an opposite phase, and
therefore the total amplitude Vmin is the difference |V +| −|V −|. On the
other hand, the current has a minimum where the voltage has a maximum,
and vice versa. The voltage standing wave ratio is defined as
VSWR = Vmax

|V +| + |V −|

Impedance Matching
VSWR is equal to 1 when the load is matched, and 1 < VSWR ≤∞
when the load is mismatched. The input impedance of the line is Z0 ×
VSWR at the maximum and Z0 /VSWR at the minimum, that is, it is real
in both cases.
There are many problems caused by the load mismatch:
• Part of the power is not absorbed by the load. Power is proportional
to the square of the voltage (or field strength); therefore the power
reflection coefficient is | rL|2. If the forward propagating power is
P, then the reflected power is | rL|2 × P and the power absorbed
by the load is X1 −| rL|2C × P. The power loss due to reflection
or the reflection loss Lrefl is (in decibels)
Lrefl = 10 log
1
1 −| rL|2
(4.15)
The return loss Lretn describes how much smaller the reflected power
is compared to the incident power P, and is defined (in decibels)
as
Lretn = 10 log
1
| rL|2
(4.16)
• Due to reflection, the field strength may be doubled at the standing
wave maximum, and therefore danger of electrical breakdown
increases in high-power applications such as radar.
• The standing wave increases the conductor loss in the line. The loss
is proportional to the square of the current. At the current maximum
the loss increase is higher than the decrease at the current minimum
compared to a matched case.
• A mismatch at the input of a sensitive receiver deteriorates the signal-
to-noise ratio of the receiver.
• If the line is long, the input impedance fluctuates rapidly versus
frequency. This is a disadvantage for active devices such as amplifiers
because their performance depends on the feeding impedance. For
example, the gain of an amplifier may change greatly if its input
load impedance (feed impedance) changes.
• In digital radio systems the reflected pulses may cause symbol errors.

74
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
• In an antenna array a mismatched element causes deterioration of
the overall antenna performance due to phase and amplitude errors.
A standing wave in a line can be measured and displayed using a slotted
line, which is usually made of a rectangular metal waveguide or a coaxial
line. In the case of a rectangular waveguide, there is a narrow slot in the
middle of the wide wall, as shown in Figure 4.3; this slot does not disturb
the fields of the waveguide because the surface currents of the TE10 mode
do not cross the centerline of the wide wall. In the slot there is a movable
probe, into which a voltage proportional to the electric field is induced. This
voltage is then measured with a square-law diode detector and displayed
with a proper device. By moving the probe, the maximum and minimum
are found and their ratio gives the VSWR. The impedance at the standing
wave minimum is Z0 /VSWR. Then the impedance at any position z can
be calculated using (4.12). In practice, nowadays the impedance is measured
using a network analyzer. For more information concerning measurement
techniques, see [1].
4.2 Smith Chart
The Smith chart is a useful tool for displaying impedances measured versus
frequency or for solving a matching problem in a circuit design. The Smith
chart clearly shows the connection between the reflection coefficient and
Figure 4.3 A slotted line made of a rectangular waveguide.

75

impedance, and also displays readily how the input impedance changes when
moving along the line.
If the load is passive, the absolute value of the voltage reflection coeffi-
cient is never more than 1. Then any complex reflection coefficient of a
passive load can be presented in the polar form within a unity circle. All
possible normalized impedances of passive loads can be presented within
this unity circle. This is the great idea of the Smith chart, presented by
P. Smith in 1939 [2].
The normalized input impedance at z = −l can be presented as
z(−l ) = Z(−l )
Z0
= r + jx
(4.17)
The corresponding voltage reflection coefficient is
r(−l ) = rL e −2jbl = u + jv
(4.18)
According to (4.10) we have
z(−l ) = 1 + rL e −2jbl
1 −rL e −2jbl
(4.19)
and after substituting (4.17) and (4.18) into this we obtain
r + jx = 1 + (u + jv)
1 −(u + jv)
(4.20)
We can form the two following equations by separating (4.20) into
real and imaginary parts:
r = 1 −(u2 + v2)
(1 −u)2 + v2
(4.21)
x =
2v
(1 −u)2 + v2
(4.22)

These can be solved for two equations of circles as

Graphically presented, these equations form the Smith chart shown in Figure
4.4.

Impedance Matching
At the center of the Smith chart the normalized impedance is z = 1;
that is, the load is matched to the line (r = 0). At the top of the Smith
chart there is a point representing a short circuit, z = 0 or r = −1, and at
the bottom there is a point representing an open circuit, z = ∞or r = 1.
Points elsewhere on the unity circle perimeter represent pure imaginary
impedances X| r| = 1C. All pure real impedances are on the vertical diameter,
and from that to the left there are the capacitive impedances and to the
right the inductive impedances.
Figure 4.5 shows how an impedance is related to the corresponding
voltage reflection coefficient. Point A represents a normalized load imped-
ance, zL = 0.5 + j0.5. The magnitude of the reflection coefficient is the
distance of point A from the center of the chart, point O, or | r| = 0.45
(remember that the radius of the chart is 1). The phase of the reflection
coefficient is the angle between the directions from point O to the point z
= ∞and to point A measured counterclockwise, in this case ∠r = 117°.
When moving along a lossless line, the absolute value of the reflection
coefficient is constant and the phase changes 360° per one half-wavelength.
Therefore the impedance locus following this move is along a circle, the
Figure 4.5 Using the Smith chart: The relation between an impedance and the correspond-
ing voltage reflection coefficient, movement along a lossless transmission line
(A →B), and the relation between an impedance (point A) and the correspond-
ing admittance (point A′).

radius of which is equal to the absolute value of the load reflection coefficient.
If the movement is toward the load, the direction on the Smith chart is
counterclockwise. If the movement is away from the load, that is, toward
the generator, the direction is clockwise. The impedance of the load,
zL = 0.5 + j0.5, seen through a line of 0.1lg long, is obtained by moving
from point A clockwise 360°/5 = 72° to point B, where the impedance is
zB = 1.42 + j1.11.
One of the great features of the Smith chart is that the admittance
yL corresponding to the impedance zL is obtained as the mirror image A′
of point A. When zL = 0.5 + j0.5, we can read from the Smith chart that
yL = 1.0 −j1.0. This can be easily checked using the definition of admittance
y(−l ) =
1
z(−l ) =
Z0
Zin (−l ) = g + jb
(4.25)
4.3 Matching Methods
The purpose of matching is to eliminate the wave reflected from a load.
From the matching point of view, a load may be not only a circuit or device
into which the power is absorbed from the line, but also a generator feeding
the line. This is why we have to consider cautiously the directions ‘‘toward
generator—clockwise’’ and ‘‘toward load—counterclockwise’’ on the Smith
chart. In most cases we measure the reflection coefficient of the ‘‘load’’ first.
In the measurement we use an auxiliary generator, and accordingly we can
always use the direction ‘‘clockwise—toward generator’’ when designing a
matching circuit. Figure 4.6 illustrates this in the case of an amplifier with
both an input and output matching circuit in order to maximize gain. When
designing the input matching circuit, we measure first the transistor reflection
coefficient, rin , from the input side, but when designing the output matching
circuit we measure the reflection coefficient, rout , from the output side.
Figure 4.6 A transistor amplifier with both input and output matching, illustrating the
direction of measurement of the reflection coefficients.

79
Impedance Matching
Note that impedance tuners are needed in place of matching circuits to
optimize the transistor performance before and during measurement. In the
case of a bilateral transistor, rin depends on the output load impedance and
rout depends on the input load impedance. Therefore, some iteration is
needed to find the reflection coefficients providing the maximum gain. After
these measurements, in both cases, we use the Smith chart in a clockwise
manner when designing the matching circuits.
Usually the load is matched to the line with a matching circuit in front
of the load. The matching circuit contains reactive elements such as inductors
(coils), capacitors, transformers, tuning stubs, or special elements such as a
tuning screw or an iris in a metal waveguide. The reactive elements represent
discontinuities that cause reflections, which cancel the reflection from the
load, so that ideally all power is absorbed into the load although there are
multiple reflections between the load and the matching circuit (see Section
4.3.3). In case of a quarter-wave transformer these discontinuities are the
abrupt changes in the characteristic impedance of the line. In some cases
the load is matched resistively, but then the reflected wave is absorbed into
the matching circuit and therefore lost.
Furthermore, in some cases the load impedance can be tuned actively.
For example, the impedance of a diode detector depends on the diode bias
current. By introducing a proper bias current, the matching of the detector
can be optimized.
In Section 4.3 we assume that the load impedance will be matched to
the real impedance of the line feeding the load. Generally, matching is
realized between circuits having complex impedances—for example, between
a source with an output impedance ZS and a load with an input impedance
Zin . Then conjugate matching
Zin = ZS*
(4.26)
results in maximum power transfer to the load for a fixed source impedance.
In fact, in the following we realize the same because the matching circuit
transforms the real line impedance to the complex conjugate of the load
impedance.
4.3.1
Matching with Lumped Reactive Elements
In the megahertz range, a coil may perform as an ideal inductance and a
capacitor as an ideal capacitance. In the microwave region, coils and capacitors
may still be useful elements for realizing reactive matching circuits, but care

80
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
must be taken with the size of these elements. The size of the lumped element
must be much smaller than a wavelength. In hybrid integrated circuits, chip
capacitors or interdigital gap capacitors and wire coils are successfully used
at least to several gigahertz, and in monolithic integrated circuits metal–
insulator–metal (MIM) capacitors as well as loop and spiral inductors are
used successfully at millimeter wavelengths. However, parasitic elements of
such capacitors and inductors must also be taken into account in the circuit
design, meaning that a careful modeling of these elements is necessary. Figure
4.7 illustrates some lumped elements used in integrated circuits.
Matching with a lumped reactive element is realized by placing a single
element at a proper distance from the load in series or in parallel as shown
in Figure 4.8. It is possible to move from any load impedance zL toward
the generator such a distance l1 < lg /2, so that the load is seen as an
impedance 1 + jx0. If we add at this point a series reactance of −x0, the

digital gap capacitor; (c) metal–insulator–metal capacitor; (d) loop inductor;
and (e) spiral inductor (with an airbridge).

81
Impedance Matching
input impedance is 1 + jx0 −jx0 = 1, and the load is matched to the line;
see Figure 4.8(a). On the other hand, from any load admittance it is possible
to move toward the generator a distance l2 < lg /2, so that the load admittance
is seen as 1 + jb0. By adding in this point a shunt susceptance −b0, we get
a match, as in Figure 4.8(b).
Example 4.1
Match a load impedance of ZL = RL + jXL = (150 + j100)V to Z0 = 50V
at 100 MHz according to Figure 4.8.
Solution
Let us first place the normalized load impedance zL = ZL /Z0 = 3 + j2 on
the Smith chart in Figure 4.9; we are at point A. If we then move along a
circle (radius OA) clockwise on the Smith chart (corresponding to moving
along a lossless 50-V line away from the load), we first come to the unity
circle after 0.096lg at point B, where the impedance is 1 −j1.62. By adding
a series inductance with a normalized reactance of x = +1.62 (L = xZ0/v
= 128 nH) in this point, we match the load. Another possibility is to move
further away (a distance of 0.206lg from load) to point B′, which is on
the mirror image circle of circle r = 1. The corresponding admittance at
point C′ is 1 + j1.62. By adding a shunt inductance with susceptance of
b = −1.62 (L = −Z0/(vb) = 49 nH) at this point we also match the load.
A further possibility is to move to point B″ (distance from load 0.346lg )
and add a shunt capacitance with susceptance of b = +1.62 (C = b/(vZ0)
Figure 4.9 Matching the load impedance of ZL = RL + jXL = (150 + j100)V to Z0 = 50V
using a single lumped reactive element.

82
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
= 52 pF). However, the widest matching bandwidth is obtained when the
reactive (susceptive) element is placed as close to the load as possible.
Another possibility in realizing a reactive match is to use an LC (or
LL or CC ) circuit in front of the load, as shown in Figure 4.10. The series
or shunt element next to the load now replaces the line section needed above,
and the matching circuit is more compact.
If zL = rL + jxL is inside the 1 + jx circle, there are two distinct
possibilities to match the load with two reactive elements: first either a
capacitor or an inductor in parallel to the load and then in series an inductor
or a capacitor, respectively, toward the line. If zL = rL + jxL is inside the
mirror image circle of the 1 + jx circle, there are again two distinct possibilities:
first either an inductor or a capacitor in series with the load and then a
Figure 4.10 Matching with two reactive elements: Depending on the value of the load
impedance zL = rL + jxL , the Smith chart is divided into four regions, each
of which leads to different possibilities in matching with two reactive elements.

shunting capacitor or inductor, respectively, toward the line. If the load
impedance is outside of both of the regions, in the vertically or horizontally
shaded area of the Smith chart in Figure 4.10, there are more matching
possibilities. If the load impedance zL = rL + jxL is in the vertically shaded
area, that is, if zL is capacitive, there are four distinct possibilities to construct
the matching circuit with two reactive elements, but we must start with an
inductor next to the load. This inductor may be either in series or in parallel;
the other component (respectively in parallel or in series) may be an inductor
or a capacitor. Similarly, when zL is in the horizontally shaded region—
when the load impedance is inductive—there are again four different possibili-
ties, but now we must start with a capacitor next to the load. Again, this
capacitor may be either in series or in parallel; the other component (respec-
tively in parallel or in series) may be an inductor or a capacitor. Let us study
these in more detail through some examples, which also serve the reader for
getting more confidence in using the Smith chart.
Example 4.2
Match a load impedance of ZL = RL + jXL = (20 −j30)V to Z0 = 50V
at 100 MHz starting with a series inductor next to the load.
Solution
Let us first mark the normalized impedance zL = ZL /Z0 = 0.4 −j0.6 on
the Smith chart as shown in Figure 4.11; we are at point A. If we add at
this point a series reactance of x = 1.09, we get to the mirror image circle
of the circle r = 1 to point B, where the impedance is 0.4 + j0.49. The
Figure 4.11 Matching of a load ZL = RL + jXL = (20 −j30)V to Z0 = 50V using lumped
reactive elements.

84
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
corresponding admittance is 1.0 −j1.22 (point C), so that by adding a parallel
susceptance of b = 1.22, we match the load. The inductance corresponding
to the normalized series reactance x is L = xZ0/v, and the capacitance
corresponding to the normalized parallel susceptance is C = b/(vZ0). The
component values at 100 MHz are L = 87 nH and C = 39 pF. Another
possibility is first to add a small series reactance of x = 0.11 to get to point
B′ where the impedance is 0.4 −j0.49. Then the corresponding admittance
is 1.0 + j1.22 (point C′). After adding a parallel susceptance of b = −1.22,
we also have obtained a match. Now both of the reactive components are
inductances; the series component is L1 = Z0x/v = 8.8 nH and the parallel
component is L2 = −Z0/(bv) = 65 nH. (Note: This load impedance can
also be matched starting with a shunt inductance next to the load; in order
to realize this, start from the load admittance.)
Example 4.3
Match a load impedance of ZL = RL + jXL = (150 + j100)V to Z0 = 50V
at 100 MHz with two reactive elements.
Solution
Let us first mark the normalized impedance zL = ZL /Z0 = 3 + j2 on the
Smith chart as shown in Figure 4.12; we are at point A. We first transform
to the corresponding admittance, yL = 0.23 −j0.15. From there we move
along circle g = 0.23 to the mirror image circle of g = 1 either to point B′
or point B″. Moving to B′ corresponds to adding a shunt susceptance of
b = −0.26 (i.e., L1 = −Z0/(bv) = 306 nH), and moving to B″ corresponds
Figure 4.12 Matching of a load ZL = RL + jXL = (150 + j100)V to Z0 = 50V using lumped
reactive elements.

85
Impedance Matching
to adding a shunt susceptance of b = 0.56 (i.e., C1 = b/(vZ0) = 18 pF).
Then we transform back to the impedance and get to either point C′ or
C″, respectively. In order to get to the center of the Smith chart, we now
have to add a series component. In the case of point C′ we add a series
capacitor with a reactance of x = −1.8 (C2 = −1/(Z0xv) = 18 pF), and in
the case of point C″ we add a series inductor with a reactance of 1.8
(L2 = xZ0/v = 143 nH).
Example 4.4
Match a load impedance of ZL = RL + jXL = (15 −j15)V to Z0 = 50V
at 100 MHz with two lumped reactive elements.
Solution
Let us first mark the normalized impedance zL = ZL /Z0 = 0.3 −j0.3 on
the Smith chart as shown in Figure 4.13; we are at point A. If we now add
a series reactance of x = 0.758, we move along the circle r = 0.3 and get to
the mirror image circle of the circle r = 1 to point B, where the impedance
is 0.3 + j0.458. The corresponding admittance is 1.0 −j1.528 (point C),
so that by adding a parallel susceptance of b = 1.528 we match the load.
The inductance corresponding to the normalized series reactance x is L1 =
xZ0/v = 60 nH, and the capacitance corresponding to the normalized
parallel susceptance is C1 = b/(vZ0) = 49 pF at 100 MHz. Another possi-
bility is to add first a series reactance of x = −0.158 to get to point B′
where the impedance is 0.3 −j0.458. Then the corresponding admittance
Figure 4.13 Matching of a load ZL = RL + jXL = (15 −j15)V to Z0 = 50V using lumped
reactive elements.

86
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
is 1.0 + j1.528 (point C′). After adding a parallel susceptance of −1.528,
we have obtained a match. Now the component values are for the series
capacitance C2 = −1/(Z0xv) = 201 pF and for the parallel inductance
L2 = −Z0/(bv) = 52 nH.
4.3.2
Matching with Tuning Stubs (with Short Sections of Line)
In the microwave region, the inductors and capacitors do not represent ideal
inductances and capacitances but often behave as resonant circuits. At such
high frequencies the desired reactance may often be more easily realizable
by using a tuning stub, which is a short section of a line terminated with
either a short circuit or an open circuit. As we can easily calculate using
(4.12), a short-circuited tuning stub is inductive when its length is from
0 to lg /4 and capacitive when its length is from lg /4 to lg /2. An open-
circuited tuning stub is capacitive when its length is from 0 to lg /4 and
inductive when its length is from lg /4 to lg /2. Depending on the line type
used, there may be only one choice: In a metal waveguide only a short-
circuited stub is possible because an open end acts as an antenna. On the
other hand, in microstrip circuits a short circuit is difficult to realize and
therefore open-circuited stubs are used.
Matching with one tuning stub is realized according to Figure 4.8. In
theory, we can use either a series stub or a parallel stub. In practice the
choice is more limited. For example, in a microstrip circuit only a parallel
stub is possible.
If the characteristic impedance of the tuning stub is the same as that
of the line to which the load is to be matched, the length of a short-circuited
stub is obtained from the following [see also (4.12)]
j tan bl = −jx0 =
1
−jb0
(4.27)
Accordingly, the length of an open-circuited stub is obtained from
1
j tan bl = −jx0 =
1
−jb0
(4.28)
The characteristic impedance of the stub may also differ from that of
the line; then the proper length is calculated using (4.12). Since the impedance

of a stub is periodic with a period of lg /2, the stub length can also be
l + nlg /2, but a short stub is preferred because it provides a wider matching
bandwidth.
Example 4.5
Match the normalized admittance of yL = 0.3 + j0.3 to a 50-V line using
a short-circuited tuning stub.
Solution
Figures 4.14 and 4.15 show how this problem is solved on the Smith chart.
First we place the normalized admittance on the Smith chart, point A. Then
we move along a circle (along a 50-V line) a distance of 0.123lg and come
to the unity circle g = 1 to point B, where the admittance is 1 + j1.4. If
we now add at this point a parallel susceptance of −1.4, we obtain a match.
Another possibility is to move along the 50-V line to point B′, where the
admittance is 1 −j1.4, and add at this point a parallel susceptance of +j1.4
in order to get a match. The required length of the parallel stub is either
obtained from (4.27) or by using the Smith chart. Figure 4.15 shows how
the length of a short-circuited stub with a normalized admittance of −j1.4
is obtained. We start from y = ∞and move along the outer circle of the

length l = 0.099lg can be read from the Smith chart. Accordingly,

l = 0.401lg , as also shown in Figure 4.15. The obtained matching circuits
are presented in Figure 4.16.

Impedance Matching
The above matching with a single tuning stub is simple but requires
placing the stub in a new position when the frequency is changed, even if
the stub length is adjustable. The tuning stubs can be placed in a fixed
position when two or three stubs are used [3]. The remaining task is to find
correct lengths of the stubs. Two tuning stubs allow matching of almost all
possible load impedances. In practice, a limiting factor is the attenuation in
the line; it limits the range of the obtainable stub susceptances. A wide
matching bandwidth also requires that the distance between the stubs be
close to either 0 or lg /2. In practice the tuning stubs are placed at a distance
of lg /8 or 3lg /8 from each other. For measurement setups, tuners are
available with three adjustable stubs. Such a tuner can match any load
impedance to the line.
4.3.3
Quarter-Wave Transformer
Let us consider the situation presented in Figure 4.17. A real load impedance
RL must be matched into a line with a characteristic impedance of Z0.
Matching is realized by using a line section of length lg /4 and characteristic
impedance Zt . Because tan (blg /4) = ∞, we obtain from (4.12) that the
impedance loading the original line is
R ′L = Z 2
t
RL
(4.29)
If we choose Zt = √Z0RL , the load is matched to the line. The quarter-
wavelength-long line section acts as a transformer, with a number-of-turns
ratio equal to √Z0/RL . If the load impedance is not real, we use a line
section with a proper length and characteristic impedance between the load
and the transformer so that the load impedance seen through this section
is real.
Figure 4.17 Quarter-wave transformer.

90
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Example 4.6
Match a load impedance of ZL = (20 + j40)V to a line with Z0 = 50V
using a quarter-wave transformer.
Solution
Figure 4.18 shows, on the Smith chart, how the problem is solved. First we
need to make the load impedance real: We place a line section having a
characteristic impedance of Z0 between the load and the transformer. The
load impedance normalized to Z0 is zL = 0.4 + j0.8. We need a line section
of 0.135lg to make the load impedance real. When we move from zL =
0.4 + j0.8 toward the generator a distance of 0.135lg , we come to a real
impedance (normalized) of r = 4.27, that is, R = rZ0 = 214V. According
to (4.29) the required transformer impedance is √Z0R = √rZ0 = 103V.
Then we normalize the impedance R to Zt and obtain R/Zt = √r . We move
on the Smith chart to √r = 2.07, and then move a distance of lg /4 toward
the generator and get impedance 1/√r . When we normalize this back to
Z0, we get an impedance of Zt /X√rZ0C = 1; in other words, the load is
matched.
Let us now consider what actually happens in the quarter-wave trans-
former of Figure 4.17 to the wave approaching the load. The wave is reflected

transformer, presented on the Smith chart.

and transmitted multiple times at the two boundaries, as shown in Figure
4.19. Let us first define the reflection and transmission coefficients as follows:
r = total reflection coefficient of the incident wave on the l/4 trans-
former
r1 = reflection coefficient of a wave incident on a load Zt from a Z0
line
r2 = reflection coefficient of a wave incident on a load Z0 from a Zt
line
r3 = reflection coefficient of a wave incident on a load RL from a Zt
line
t1 = transmission coefficient of a wave from a Z0 line into a Zt line
t2 = transmission coefficient of a wave from a Zt line into a Z0 line.
According to (4.5) and (4.6), these coefficients can be expressed as
r1 = (Zt −Z0)/(Zt + Z0)
r2 = (Z0 −Zt )/(Z0 + Zt ) = −r1
r3 = (RL −Zt )/(RL + Zt )
t1 = 2Zt /(Zt + Z0)
t2 = 2Z0/(Zt + Z0)
The total reflection coefficient is obtained as an infinite series of individual
reflections and, taking into account that there is a phase shift of e −2ju for
each round-trip in the transformer, can be expressed as
Figure 4.19 Multiple-reflection analysis of the l/4 transformer.

= r1 + t1t2 r3e −2ju
1 −r2 r3e −2ju
(4.30)
The last result is obtained using the sum rule of an infinite geometric
series, since | r2| < 1 and | r3| < 1. If we furthermore take into account that
r2 = −r1, and t1 = 1 + r1 and t2 = 1 −r1, we get
r = r1 + r3e −2ju
1 + r1 r3e −2ju
(4.31)
From this we see, because the transformer characteristic impedance
is Zt = √Z0RL and therefore r1 = r3, and at the center frequency
e −2ju = −1, that the total reflected wave fully disappears at the center fre-
quency. If the discontinuities between the impedances Z0 and Zt as well as
between Zt and RL are small, then | r1r3| << 1, and we can approximate
r ≈r1 + r3e −2ju.
The problem with the quarter-wave transformer is its narrow matching
bandwidth. The transformer offers a match only at the frequency where the
transformer length is exactly lg /4 (or lg /4 + nlg /2). The bandwidth, over
which the reflection coefficient is small, is narrow. Sometimes this is sufficient,
but in many applications we need a wider bandwidth.
A wider bandwidth can be obtained by using several consecutive trans-
former sections, the characteristic impedances of which change with small
steps between RL and Z0. Depending on how the impedance steps are chosen,
different frequency responses of the reflection coefficient are obtained. A
binomial transformer provides a maximally flat response. A Chebyshev trans-
former provides a frequency response where the reflection coefficient fluctu-
ates between certain limits over the matching bandwidth. Figure 4.20 shows
the frequency response of a single l/4 transformer, a two-section binomial
transformer, and a three-section Chebyshev transformer. The design proce-
dures of the binomial and Chebyshev transformers can be found in many
books [3, 4].
Often a l/4 transformer is used to match two lines with different
characteristic impedances. Figure 4.21(a) shows how a low- and high-imped-

ance coaxial line are matched to each other using a three-section l/4 trans-
former. Different impedances are realized by changing the inner conductor
diameter. Abrupt changes in line dimensions cause not only reflections but
also reactive fields and reactive energy storages. In an equivalent circuit these
can be modeled using shunt susceptances. In an accurate analysis and design
these reactive components must be taken into account.
Instead of using a multisection transformer, we can use a tapered section
at least lg /2 long, as shown in Figure 4.21(b). The tapering may be linear or
follow other mathematical functions leading to different frequency responses.
4.3.4
Resistive Matching
Matching of a load can be improved simply by introducing an attenuator
in front of the load, as shown in Figure 4.22. This may be a useful solution,
for example, in a measurement application when a wide measurement band-
width is required but the power loss is not a problem.
Let us assume that the load reflection coefficient is rL and the insertion
loss of an attenuator matched to the line is L [see (5.32)]. If the incident
power to the attenuator is P, power after the attenuator is P/L. From this
power, a part X1 −| rL|2C × P/L is absorbed to the load and a part
| rL|2 × P/L is reflected. The reflected power is further attenuated in the
attenuator to a value of | rL|2 × P/L2. When compared to a situation without
an attenuator, the power reflection coefficient decreases from a value of
| rL|2 to a value of | rL|2/L2. The drawback of this method is that the
power absorbed to the load is at maximum P/L. The attenuator is realized
in integrated circuits using resistors shown in Figure 4.23. Two applications
of resistive matching are illustrated in Figure 4.24.
A better solution than the attenuator is an isolator (see Section 6.2.3)
placed in front of the load. An ideal isolator is lossless in the forward direction
but absorbs the backward reflected wave fully. The reflected power is also
lost in this case but more power is available to the load, although in practice

an isolator also has some attenuation in the forward direction. Furthermore,
it does not fully block the backward reflected wave and its ports are not
fully matched to the line.

Microwave Circuit Theory
Microwave circuits are composed of many parts and blocks, such as transmis-
sion lines, filters, and amplifiers. It was shown in Chapter 3 how the field
distributions within the waveguides could be solved using Maxwell’s equa-
tions and boundary conditions. In principle, whole circuits could be analyzed
this way. However, this is very cumbersome, and often the knowledge of
the field distributions is of no use.
Usually one wants to know how the wave is transmitted through the
circuit or reflected from it. Therefore, the circuit can be considered to be a
‘‘black box’’ that has one or more ports. It is sufficient to know the transfer
functions between the ports; it is not necessary to know what happens inside
the circuit. Thus, the operation of the circuit can be described with only a
few parameters. The transfer function of a system comprising of cascaded
circuits can be obtained using these parameters. In the circuit theory, Z-
and Y-parameters are commonly used. However, the scattering or
S-parameters are best suited for describing the operation of a microwave
circuit.
5.1 Impedance and Admittance Matrices
The voltages and currents of a low-frequency circuit can be defined uniquely.
In case of a high-frequency circuit this is not necessarily true. Voltages and
currents can be defined uniquely only for a transmission line that carries a
pure TEM mode. For example, the voltage and current of a rectangular
97

98
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
waveguide can be defined in several ways. In such a line, the electric and
magnetic fields and the power propagating in the waveguide are more funda-
mental quantities than the voltage and current. However, it would be useful
if the operation of a high-frequency circuit could be described in terms of
voltages, currents, and impedances because then the methods of the circuit
theory could be used.
Figure 5.1 shows a circuit having n ports. There is a short homogeneous
transmission line at each port. The reference plane (within this line) of each
port has to be defined clearly because the parameters of the circuit depend
on the positions of the reference planes. Let us assume that only the funda-
mental TEM mode is propagating into and out of the ports. The discontinu-
ities of the circuit generate higher-order TE and TM modes, which usually
are not able to propagate. The reference planes have to be far enough from
these discontinuities so that the fields of the nonpropagating modes are well
attenuated. For each port i, an entering voltage wave Vi
+ and current wave

The impedance matrix [1] is an inverse matrix [2] of the admittance
matrix, [Z ] = [Y ]−1. The elements of the matrices, Zij and Yij , are called
Z- and Y-parameters. For a reciprocal circuit, the matrices are symmetric:
Zij = Zji and Yij = Yji .
A two-port is the most common of the n-port circuits. Many different
equivalent circuits can be used to realize the equations of a two-port [3, 4].

Figure 5.2 shows an equivalent circuit for a reciprocal two-port. The three
Z-parameters for this T-circuit, Z11, Z22, and Z12, are calculated or

input impedance measured at port 1 is

By measuring the input impedances corresponding to three different load
impedances, a set of three equations is obtained. The Z-parameters may
then be solved from these equations.
The properties of a circuit composed of two-ports connected in series
can be calculated from the transmission matrices [T ] of the two-ports. A

It should be noted that the positive output current I2 is now defined
to flow out of the two-port so that I2 will be the input current to the
following two-port. The transmission matrix of a circuit consisting of several
two-ports in a series is obtained by multiplying the transmission matrices
of the two-ports in the same order.

Microwave Circuit Theory
Generally, the measurement of Z- and Y-parameters is difficult at
microwave frequencies because the measurement of the total voltages and
currents at the ports is difficult, and in the case of waveguides carrying TE
or TM modes it is impossible. Furthermore, in the case of some active
circuits, the load impedances needed in the measurement may cause instability
in the circuit.
5.2 Scattering Matrices
The scattering or S-parameters [1, 5, 6] are defined using the voltage waves
entering the ports, Vi

the voltage wave leaving port i may be written as

or [V −] = [S ][V +]. The power flowing into port i is |Vi
+|2/(2Z0), and
the power flowing out of port i is |Vi
−|2/(2Z0).
Usually, all the ports of a microwave circuit have similar connectors,
such as 50-V coaxial connectors or waveguide flanges, and the characteristic
impedances of the ports have the same value. However, in a general case,
the characteristic impedances Z0i may have different values. For example,
the ports of a coaxial-to-waveguide adapter have different characteristic
impedances. Then, the voltage waves should be normalized as

If all the ports are terminated with matched loads, the reflection coeffi-
cient for port i is ri = Sii = bi /ai , and the transducer power gain from port
j to port i is Gij = |Sij |2 = |bi /aj |2.
The scattering matrix of a reciprocal circuit is symmetrical: Sij = Sji .
In other words, the transposed matrix is the same as the matrix itself:
[S ]T = [S ]. A reciprocal circuit operates the same way, regardless of the
direction of the power flow. Most passive circuits are reciprocal; circuits that
include ferrite components are the exceptions.
If the circuit has no loss, the sum of the powers flowing into the ports
equals the sum of the powers flowing out of the ports:

rows. If the voltage waves ak and al are chosen to be nonzero and other
waves entering the circuit are zero, it can be proven that
∑

Sik S *il = 0
(5.18)
For any two columns, the scattering parameters of a lossless circuit
fulfill this equation. A similar equation applies for any two rows. The scatter-
ing matrix of a lossless circuit is unitary; that is, the transposed scattering
matrix is equal to the inverse of the complex conjugate of the scattering
matrix.
Scattering matrices of some simple circuits:
• A lossless transmission line having a length of l and a characteristic
impedance of Z0, as shown in Figure 5.3. Z0 is also the characteristic
impedance of both ports. When one of the ports is terminated with
a matched load, the reflection coefficient of the other port is zero.
Thus, S11 = S22 = 0. If the voltage wave entering port 1 is a1 = 1,
the voltage wave leaving port 2 is b2 = e −jbl, and S21 = b2 /a1 =
e −jbl. Due to the symmetry, S12 = S21.
• A joint of two transmission lines, as shown in Figure 5.4. The character-
istic impedances of the transmission lines and ports are Z01 and
Z02. The reference planes of the ports are located at a distance of

nlg /2 from the junction. If a1 = 1 and a2 = 0, then b1 = r =
(Z02 −Z01)/(Z01 + Z02) = S11. The voltage transmission coefficient
is t = 1 + r. The normalized voltage wave b2 is obtained from t
by
using
(5.11)
and
(5.12):
b2
=
(1 + r)√Z01 /Z02 =
2√Z01 Z02 /(Z01 + Z02) = S21. Correspondingly, if a1 = 0 and a2
= 1, S22 = r and b1 = (1 −r)√Z02 /Z01 = 2√Z01 Z02 /
(Z01 + Z02) = S12, which may also be recognized directly due to
the reciprocity.
• A load having an impedance of ZL is a one-port circuit. Its scattering
matrix has only one scattering parameter: S11 = rL = (ZL −Z0)/
(ZL + Z0), the voltage reflection coefficient of the load terminating
a transmission line.
The measurement of scattering parameters is much easier than the
measurement of the Z- or Y-parameters. For example, S11 is obtained by
measuring the voltage reflection coefficient r1 = b1/a1 at port 1, as all
the other ports are terminated with their characteristic impedance Z0i and
therefore a2 . . . an = 0. It is also an advantage that changing the position
of a reference plane only changes the phases of the scattering parameters.
For example, if the reference plane of port 1 of a two-port is moved outward
an electrical distance of bl = u, S11 changes to e −2juS11, S12 to e −juS12,
and S21 to e −juS21, while S22 remains unchanged.
The transmission matrix [T ] relates the input waves to output waves.

5.3 Signal Flow Graph, Transfer Function, and Gain
A signal flow graph [7–9] is a graphical representation of the scattering
matrix. It illustrates the equations governing the operation of a circuit. The

equations for such transfer functions as gain and reflection coefficient can
be derived with the aid of signal flow graphs. Even the analysis of a circuit,
which has more than one internal reflection leading to an infinite number
of reflected waves, may be kept clear using a signal flow graph.
In a flow graph, there are two nodal points for each port. The values
of the voltage waves, ai and bi , are assigned to these nodes. The nodes are
connected with branches whose gains correspond to the scattering parameters.
Signal may flow between two nodes along a branch only to that direction
given by the arrow, that is, from node a to node b. Figure 5.5 shows the
signal flow graphs for a two-port and three-port.
A given transfer function can be solved from a signal flow graph by
using the simplification rules explained here and shown in Figure 5.6 [7]:
• Two branches in a series, Figure 5.6(a), with no other branches
connected to the common node, can be replaced with one branch
whose gain is the product of the gains of the two branches:

• A node can be duplicated by duplicating the branch(es) feeding the
node, Figure 5.6(d), or by duplicating the branch leaving the node,
Figure 5.6(e).
The following examples illustrate how flow graphs can be simplified
and transfer functions solved.
Example 5.1
Derive the input reflection coefficient rin for a two-port when the output
port (port 2) is terminated with a load impedance ZL . The characteristic
impedance of both ports is Z0.
Solution
The voltage reflection coefficient for the load is rL = (ZL −Z0)/(ZL + Z0).
This is also the gain of the branch connected to the output port in the flow
graph of Figure 5.7(a). The node a2 is then duplicated by duplicating the
branch rL [Figure 5.7(b)]. The gain of the self-loop is S22 rL according to
the rule of branches in series. Then the self-loop is eliminated [Figure 5.7(c)].

(b) duplication of a node; (c) elimination of a self-loop; and (d) combination

108

The rule of branches in series is used again [Figure 5.7(d)]. The input
reflection coefficient is obtained by applying the rule of branches in parallel:
rin = S11 + S21S12 rL
1 −S22 rL
(5.24)
Example 5.2
A lossless transmission line is connected between a generator and load. The
length of the line is l = nlg (n is integer) and its characteristic impedance
is Z0, Figure 5.8(a). The load impedance is ZL . The output impedance of
the generator is ZS . What is the load voltage VL , if the generator voltage
is VS ?
Solution
It is not necessary to normalize the voltages because both ports of the line
(two-port) have the same characteristic impedance. The branches representing
S11 and S22 are not drawn in Figure 5.8(b) because their gain is zero. Now
S21 = S12 = e −jbl = 1. The node having a voltage of VS /2 represents the
generator because this voltage corresponds to available power of VS
2/(8ZS )
of the generator. The voltage transmission coefficient from the generator to
the line is 1 −rS . A branch having a gain of 1 + rL is added for the
calculation of the load voltage VL . By duplicating the node V2
−, using the
rule of branches in series, and eliminating the self-loop, the flow graph of
Figure 5.8(c) is obtained. From this we get
Figure 5.8 Solving the load voltage using flow graphs: (a) a terminated nlg transmission
line fed from a generator; (b) its flow-graph presentation; (c) elimination of a

equivalent to the circuit in (a).

Because the reflection coefficients are rS = (ZS −Z0)/(ZS + Z0) and rL =
(ZL −Z0)/(ZL + Z0), the load voltage is VL = ZLVS /(ZS + ZL ), which
may be seen also from Figure 5.8(d) by using voltage division.
5.3.1
Mason’s Rule
Instead of the flow graph simplification, transfer functions can also be found
by using Mason’s rule [10]. According to Mason’s rule, the ratio of a
dependent variable (voltage of a node) to an independent variable produced
by a source (voltage of the feed node) is
T =
P1F1 −∑L(1)1 + ∑L(2)1 −. . .G
+ P2F1 −∑L(1)2 + ∑L(2)2 −. . .G + P3[1 −. . . ]
1 −∑L(1) + ∑L(2) −∑L(3) + . . .
(5.25)
where
P1, P2, . . . are the gains of the forward paths between the input and
output nodes;
SL(1), SL(2), . . . are the sums of the loop gains of the first order,
second order, and so on;
SL(1)1, SL(2)1, . . . are the sums of the loop gains of the first order,
second order, and so on, for such loops, which do not touch path 1;
SL(1)2, SL(2)2, . . . are the sums of the loop gains of the first order,
second order, and so on, for such loops, which do not touch path 2.
A path is a continuous succession of branches having arrows pointing
to the same direction. It is either a forward path connecting the input node
to the output node, or a loop, which originates and terminates on the same
node. A path passes each node in the loop only once. The path gain is the
product of all the gains in the path. The loop gain is the product of the
gains in the loop. The loop gain of the first order means the gain of an
individual loop; the loop gain of the second order means the product of the

110
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
gains of two nontouching loops, and so on. Nontouching loops are separate
loops that do not touch each other at any node.
Example 5.3
A generator and a load are connected to a two-port, as in Figure 5.9. Find
the transducer power gain, that is, the ratio of the power coupled to the
load, PL , to the available power of the generator, PS,a . The characteristic
impedance is Z0.
Solution
In the flow graph, aS and aL are normalized voltages corresponding to the
available power of the generator and the power coupled to the load, respec-
tively. There is only one path from the input node aS to the output node
aL . Its gain is
P1 = (1 −rS )√ZS /Z0S21(1 + rL )√Z0 /ZL
There are three loops, and the sum of their gains is
∑L(1) = S11 rS + S22 rL + S21 rL S12 rS
The loops S11 rS and S22 rL are nontouching; thus,
Figure 5.9 Two-port connected between a generator and a load.

111
Microwave Circuit Theory
∑L(2) = S11 rS S22 rL
All loops touch path P1 and therefore
∑L(1)1 = ∑L(2)1 = . . . = 0
Using (5.25), the voltage of the output node is
aL =
(1 −rS )S21(1 + rL )√ZS /ZL
1 −S11 rS −S22 rL −S21 rL S12 rS + S11 rS S22 rL
× aS
5.3.2
Gain of a Two-Port
The final expression of the above solution gives us a good basis to present
different definitions of the gain of a two-port. The transducer power gain
(Gt ) can be presented in several ways:
Gt = PL
PS,a
= |aL |2
|aS |2 =
|S21|2X1 −| rS |2CX1 −| rL |2C
|(1 −S11 rS )(1 −S22 rL ) −S12S21 rS rL |2
= |S21|2X1 −| rS |2CX1 −| rL |2C
|1 −rS rin |2|1 −S22 rL |2
(5.26)
= |S21|2X1 −| rS |2CX1 −| rL |2C
|1 −S11 rS |2|1 −rout rL |2
where rout is the reflection coefficient of the output port 2.
The power gain (Gp ) of a two-port is defined as the ratio of the power
coupled to the load, PL , to the power coupled to the two-port, Pin . Using
the flow graph we obtain
Gp = PL
Pin
=
|aL |2
|a1|2X1 −| rin |2C
=
|S21|2X1 −| rL |2C
|1 −S22 rL |2X1 −| rin |2C
(5.27)
The available power gain (Ga ) is defined as the ratio of the available
output power of the two-port, Pout,a , to the available power of the generator,
PS,a :

112
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Ga = Pout,a
PS,a
= PL ( rL = r *out )
PS,a
=
|S21|2X1 −| rS |2C
|1 −S11 rS |2X1 −| rout |2C
(5.28)
The maximum available power gain (Ga,max ) is the available power
gain in that case when the input port is conjugate-matched to the generator:
Ga,max = PL ( rL = r *out )
Pin ( rS = r *in )
(5.29)
How Ga,max can be expressed using the scattering parameters of a two-port
is presented in Chapter 8, (8.28). In a unilateral case (S12 = 0), the maximum
available power gain is
Ga,max =
|S21|2
X1 −|S11|2CX1 −|S22|2C
(5.30)
The insertion gain (Gi ) is the ratio of the power coupled to the load
from the two-port, PL , to the power coupled to the load directly from the
generator, Pd (no two-port between):
Gi = PL
Pd
=
|S21|2|1 −rS rL |2
|1 −rS rin |2|1 −S22 rL |2
(5.31)
If both the generator and load are matched to the characteristic impedance
Z0, rS = rL = 0 and Gi = |S12|2. The inverse of Gi is called the insertion
loss:
Li = 1
Gi
= Pd
PL
(5.32)
The insertion gain and insertion loss are parameters, which can be measured
directly. Other gains of a two-port may be calculated from measured scattering
parameters and impedances ZS and ZL .

Passive Transmission Line and
Waveguide Devices
Transmitters and receivers are composed of many kinds of passive and active
devices. Some important passive devices based on sections of transmission
lines or waveguides are covered in this chapter. Frequency-selective passive
devices, resonators and filters, are the topic of Chapter 7. Standardized
symbols for various passive devices are shown in Figure 6.1. Most passive
devices are reciprocal; only isolators and circulators, which are based on
ferrites, are nonreciprocal.
Components or devices used in radio equipment at various frequency
ranges can be divided into three groups, according to their size in wavelengths:
1. Lumped components, such as capacitors and coils, are usable up
to UHF and even higher frequencies. Their size is small compared
to a wavelength. As the frequency increases, lumped elements
become lossy and their parasitic reactances and radiation loss
increase. For example, a capacitor may become a resonant circuit
as a result of the parasitic inductances of the connecting wires.
2. Distributed components are made of sections of transmission lines
or waveguides. Their size is comparable to a wavelength, and the
phase differences between the parts of a component are significant.
Distributed components are used at microwave and millimeter-wave
ranges. However, waveguide components eventually become lossy
and difficult to fabricate as the frequency increases.

3. Quasioptical components handle waves propagating in a beam in
free space. The dimensions of quasioptical components are larger
than a wavelength. They are used in millimeter-wave and submilli-
meter-wave systems.
6.1 Power Dividers and Directional Couplers
Power dividers and directional couplers are components that split the input
signal into two or more output ports. They may also be used as power
combiners. Power dividers usually are three-port devices. Directional couplers
have four ports and can separate waves propagating into opposite directions
on the line. Directional couplers are used in impedance measurement and

117

for taking a sample of a signal. Hybrids are 3-dB directional couplers with
either a 90° or 180° phase difference between their output signals. Hybrids
are needed in many mixers, modulators, and demodulators.
6.1.1
Power Dividers
The T-junctions shown in Figure 6.2 are simple power dividers. However,
all the ports of a lossless three-port circuit cannot be matched. We can prove
this by considering the properties of the scattering matrices. A passive,
reciprocal, and matched three-port would have a scattering matrix, as
[S ] =3

(6.1)
As we stated in Chapter 5, the scattering matrix of a lossless circuit is
unitary, from which it follows that
|S12|2 + |S13|2 = 1
(6.2)
|S12|2 + |S23|2 = 1
(6.3)
|S13|2 + |S23|2 = 1

S *23S12 = 0
(6.6)
S *12S13 = 0
(6.7)

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
According to (6.5) through (6.7) at least two of the parameters S12, S13,
and S23 are zero. However, this is in contradiction with at least one of (6.2)
through (6.4). Thus, such a circuit cannot exist.
Let us consider the matching problem of a lossless T-junction with an
equivalent circuit shown in Figure 6.3(a). The parallel susceptance B repre-
sents the reactive fields produced by the discontinuity of the junction. The
characteristic impedances of the ports are Z1, Z2, and Z3. Let us assume
that B = 0. We then choose Z2 = Z3 = 2Z1 and assume that the ports are
terminated with load impedances equal to their characteristic impedances.
Now port 1 is matched: The input impedance is Z1 and the power fed to
port 1 is split evenly to the loads of ports 2 and 3. However, ports 2 and
3 are not matched because their input impedance is 2Z1/3 (Z1 and 2Z1 in
parallel) instead of 2Z1.
All ports of a three-port divider can be matched by using resistive
elements. Figure 6.3(b) shows a matched power divider containing lumped
resistors. One half of the power coupled to the input port is absorbed in
these resistors.
The isolation of the output ports of these power dividers is poor since
a part of the power reflected from a mismatched output load is coupled to
the other output port. The Wilkinson power divider shown in Figure 6.4
avoids this disadvantage. All the ports are matched to a characteristic imped-
ance Z0 if the quarter-wave-long sections have a characteristic impedance
of √2Z0, and the output ports 2 and 3 are connected with a lumped resistor
having a resistance 2Z0. This circuit is also lossless if the ports are terminated
with a matched load, that is, with an impedance of Z0.
For all the power dividers discussed so far, the ratio of output powers
equals 1. However, this ratio can be chosen freely by modifying the parameters
of the circuits.

power divider.

6.1.2
Coupling and Directivity of a Directional Coupler
Let us consider the directional coupler shown in Figure 6.5 and assume that
it is ideal. If a wave is fed from a signal source into port 1, it will couple
to ports 2 and 4 but not at all to port 3. Similarly, if port 2 is the input
port, ports 1 and 3 are output ports and port 4 is an isolated port. An ideal
directional coupler is also lossless, and all of its ports can be matched. If all
the ports are terminated with a matched load, the input reflection coefficients
are zero. In practice, these properties can be achieved only approximately.
Let us assume that the power coupled into the input port 1 is P1 and
the powers coupled from ports 2, 3, and 4 to the matched terminations are
P2, P3, and P4, respectively. The coupling C and directivity D in decibels
are defined as
C = 10 log P1
P4
(6.8)
D = 10 log P4
P3
(6.9)
Usually, most of the input power couples to the termination of the
main line at port 2. The coupling describes the power coupled from the
main line to the side line and is designed to a value that depends on the
Figure 6.5 Directional coupler.

120
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
application, typically 3 dB to 30 dB. The directivity describes the leakage
to the isolated port and should be as large as possible; a good directivity
may be 30 dB to 40 dB. The isolation between the input port and the
isolated port is C + D in decibels.
A directional coupler with a good directivity can discriminate between
the waves propagating in opposite directions on a line. However, mismatches
of the output loads may worsen the effective directivity. Let us consider the
situation illustrated in Figure 6.6. A signal source is connected at port 1,
an unknown load with a reflection coefficient of rL is connected at port 2,
and matched power meters are connected to ports 3 and 4. In an ideal case
the power meter readings are
P3 = | rL|2S1 −
1
10C /10D
1
10C /10 P1 and P4 =
1
10C /10 P1
from which the magnitude of the reflection coefficient can be solved. If the
directional coupler has a finite directivity, and the signal source and power
meters are mismatched, several waves will disturb the measurement and
cause errors. An accurate analysis is complicated since there will be multiple
reflections between the mismatches. The analysis may be carried out using
a flow graph. Approximate error limits may be calculated by taking only
the first reflections into account. When summing up the waves propagated
to the power meters via different paths, both the amplitudes and phases of
the waves must be taken into consideration. Summing up the powers of
individual waves is not correct.
6.1.3
Scattering Matrix of a Directional Coupler
Let us next derive the scattering matrix of an ideal directional coupler.
Because ports 1 and 3 as well ports 2 and 4 are isolated from each other,
Figure 6.6 Measuring the magnitude of the reflection coefficient with a directional coupler.

121
Passive Transmission Line and Waveguide Devices
S13 = S24 = 0. Let us assume that ports 1 and 2 are matched, or S11 = S22

(6.10)
The scattering matrix of a lossless circuit is unitary. From rows 1 and
4 we get S14S *44 = 0 and from rows 2 and 3 S23S *33 = 0. Because S14 and
S23 are nonzero, parameters S33 and S44 must be zero, and ports 3 and 4
must be matched. From rows 1 and 3 and from rows 2 and 4 we get the
following equations, respectively,
S12S *23 + S14S *34 = 0
(6.11)
S12S *14 + S23S *34 = 0
(6.12)
Because, for example |S12S *23| = |S12||S23|, (6.11) and (6.12) can be written
as
|S12||S23| = |S14||S34|
(6.13)
|S12||S14| = |S23||S34|
(6.14)
By dividing the left side and right side of (6.13) with the corresponding
sides of (6.14), we get |S23|/|S14| = |S14|/|S23|, which means that
|S14| = |S23|. Hence the coupling between ports 1 and 4 is equal to that
between ports 2 and 3. Now, from (6.13) it follows that |S12| = |S34|.
The reference planes of ports 1 and 3 can be chosen so that S12 and
S34 are real and positive numbers equal to a, and the reference plane of
port 4 so that S14 is an imaginary number jb (b is real and positive). From
(6.11) it follows that also S23 = jb. Due to the conservation of energy
|S12|2 + |S14|2 = 1 or a2 + b2 = 1. Thus, the scattering matrix of an ideal
directional coupler can be written as

The special cases of a directional coupler having a 3-dB coupling are
called hybrids. The hybrid couplers can be classified into two categories,
depending on whether the phase difference of the output waves is 90° or
180°. The scattering matrix of a 90° hybrid is

Ports 1 and 4 of a 180° hybrid are called the S ports, whereas ports
2 and 3 are called the D ports. When a wave enters a S port, the output
waves have equal powers and are in the same phase. If a D port is the input
port, the output waves are in an opposite phase.
6.1.4
Waveguide Directional Couplers
We may make a directional coupler by placing side by side two rectangular
metal waveguides having coupling holes in the common wall [1]. Figure 6.7
shows a simple directional coupler having two holes d = lg /4 apart in the
broad wall of the waveguides. Let us assume that the coupling factor of a
single hole is Bf in the forward direction and Bb in the backward direction.
TEAMFLY

123
Passive Transmission Line and Waveguide Devices
Figure 6.7 Two-hole waveguide directional coupler.
For example, if a wave is applied to port 1 and its field is equal to 1 in the
lower waveguide at a hole, in the upper waveguide the fields of the waves
propagating toward ports 3 and 4 are Bb and Bf , respectively. If the coupling
factors are small, the fields in the lower waveguide at both holes have nearly
equal amplitudes. The two paths from port 1 to port 4 have equal lengths,
and the fields strengthen each other at port 4. If the coupling holes are
identical, the coupling is in decibels
C = −20 logX2|Bf |C
(6.18)
On the other hand, the paths from port 1 to port 3 have a difference of
lg /2 in their lengths. The waves coupled through the holes to port 3 have
opposite phases and cancel each other. Hence the directivity D is infinite.
The separation of the holes in the directional coupler of Figure 6.7 is
lg /4 only at a single frequency. As the frequency deviates from this frequency,
the directivity decreases. The frequency response of the directivity is
D = 20 log
2|Bf |
|Bb ||1 + e −j2bd |
= 20 log |Bf |
|Bb |
+ 20 log

|cos bd |
(6.19)
The directivity can be interpreted as the sum of the directivity of a
single hole and the directivity of the array of holes. A good directivity over
a broad band can be achieved by using several coupling holes separated by
lg /4 at the center frequency. As before, the coupling and directivity of a
multihole coupler can be calculated by summing the fields at ports 3 and
4. By choosing the sizes of the holes properly, different frequency responses,
such as the Butterworth or Chebyshev response, can be realized for the
directivity [2].
The waveguide junction shown in Figure 6.8 is called the magic
T-junction. It operates as a 180° hybrid. A wave applied to port 1 (S) is

124
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

divided into ports 2 and 4 equally and in the same phase, due to symmetry.
The electric field distribution has an even symmetry with respect to the
middle line of port 3, whereas the field of the TE10 mode has an odd
symmetry. Therefore, a wave cannot couple from port 1 to port 3. Also, a
wave applied to port 3 (D) is divided into ports 2 and 4 with equal amplitude,
but now the output waves have an opposite phase.
6.1.5
Microstrip Directional Couplers
Let us consider two parallel microstrip lines that are placed so close to each
other that the fields of the lines couple to each other. Then a wave propagating
in one line can excite a wave in the other line. The fields of a coupled line
can be presented as a superposition of an even mode and an odd mode,
shown in Figure 6.9. In case of the even mode the currents of the lines are
equal and in the same direction; in case of the odd mode they are equal but
in the opposite directions. A coupled line may be represented with an
even-mode characteristic impedance Z0e and an odd-mode characteristic
impedance Z0o , which are characteristic impedances of one of the strip
Figure 6.9 Fields of (a) the even mode and (b) the odd mode in a coupled microstrip line.

125

conductors relative to the ground when the coupled line is operated in the
even mode or odd mode, respectively. The graph in Figure 6.10 gives these
impedances when the relative permittivity of the substrate is 10.
The microstrip lines shown in Figure 6.11(a) are coupled to each other
over a length of l. Let us assume that a signal source is at port 1 and other
ports are terminated with loads having an impedance of Z0. It can be proven
that all the ports are matched if

When l = lg /4 the coupling to port 4 reaches its maximum value and
no signal is coupled to port 3. Thus, this device operates as a directional
coupler. (Note that the coupled port is on the same end as the input port,
unlike in Figures 6.6 and 6.7.) The characteristic impedances of the coupled
line depend on Z0 and on the voltage coupling coefficient K = |V4 /V1| as
Z0e = Z0√

Z0o = Z0√

(6.22)
Equations (6.20) through (6.22) are valid if the even-mode and odd-
mode waves propagate at the same speed. In a coupled microstrip line, this
is not exactly true, and the directivity is worse than in an ideal case. The
structure of Figure 6.11(a) is best suited for realizing a weak coupling (large
C ). The lines would be impractically close to each other to achieve a strong
coupling. The single-element coupler has a bandwidth that may be too
narrow for some applications. A broadband directional coupler is obtained
by connecting quarter-wave sections with appropriate couplings, as in Figure
6.11(b).
The directional coupler shown in Figure 6.12 is called the Lange coupler
and is suitable for realizing strong couplings as 3 dB to 6 dB. It is made of
several coupled lines bonded together with thin wires.
The ring coupler illustrated in Figure 6.13(a) is a 180° hybrid. Its
scattering matrix is obtained by multiplying the matrix of (6.17) by −j, if

the reference planes are at the T-junctions. The characteristic impedances
of the ports are Z0 and that of the 3lg /2-long ring is √2Z0. A wave applied
to port 1 (S) does not couple to port 3 because the two paths have a
difference in length of lg −lg /2 = lg /2, but it couples to ports 2 and 4
in the same phase. A wave applied to port 2 (D) couples to ports 1 and 3
in an opposite phase.
The branch-line coupler shown in Figure 6.13(b) is a 90° hybrid. The
lg /4-long branches have characteristic impedances of Z0 and Z0/√2. For
example, a wave applied to port 1 couples to ports 2 and 4 with a phase
difference of 90°, and port 3 is isolated from port 1. Both ring and branch-
line couplers can be modified so that the ratio of output powers differs
from 1.
Example 6.1
Design a 50-V microstrip directional coupler operating at 1 GHz with a
coupling of C = 15 dB. The properties of the substrate are: er = 10, h =
0.254 mm, t = 5 mm. Use the structure presented in Figure 6.11(a).
Solution
The voltage-coupling coefficient corresponding to a 15-dB coupling is
K = √1/101.5 = 0.1778. From (6.12) and (6.13) we get Z0e = 59.8V and
Z0o = 41.8V. We use the graph of Figure 6.10 for er = 10, and read w/h
= 0.9 and s/h = 0.9. Thus, both the width of strips forming the coupled
line and their separation is 0.23 mm. According to (3.85), the effective
relative permittivity is ereff = 6.69. The length of the coupled line section
is l/4 = c/X4f √ereff C = 29.0 mm. The strip width of 50-V lines is
0.234 mm.

6.2 Ferrite Devices
Ferrites are ceramic materials that possess a high resistivity and that behave
nonreciprocally when embedded in a magnetic field. Ferrite devices such as
isolators, circulators, attenuators, phase shifters, modulators, and switches
are based on these properties [3].
6.2.1
Properties of Ferrite Materials
Ferrites are oxides of ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, to which another
oxide has been added as an impurity. According to their molecular structure,
ferrites are divided into garnets (3M2O3 ? 5Fe2O3), spinels (MO ? Fe2O3),
and hexaferrites. In garnets M is a lantanid like yttrium, gadolinium, or
samarium. In spinels M is mangan, manganese, iron, zinc, nickel, or cad-
mium. The impurities increase the resistivity of the ferrite to as much
as 1014 times higher than the resistivity of metals. Typically, the relative
permittivity er is 10 to 20, whereas the relative permeability mr may be up
to VHF band 1,000 or even more.
In ferromagnetic materials, strong interactions between atomic mag-
netic moments force them to line up parallel to each other. Ferromagnetic
materials are able to retain magnetization when the magnetizing field is
removed.
Atoms behave as magnetic dipoles because of the spin of their electrons.
The orbital movement of the electrons about the nucleus also causes a small
magnetic moment, but its effect is less important for the magnetic properties
of materials. We can imagine that an electron is rotating about its axis
producing a magnetic dipole moment
|m| =
eh
4pme
= 9.27 × 10−24 Am2
(6.23)
where e is the magnitude of the electron charge, h is Planck’s constant, and
me is the mass of an electron. The spin angular momentum of an electron
is
|P| = h
4p
(6.24)
The vectors m and P point to opposite directions. The ratio of their magni-
tudes, the gyromagnetic ratio, is

Passive Transmission Line and Waveguide Devices
g = |
m
P | = e
me
= 17.6 MHz/gauss
(6.25)
A static magnetic field having a flux density B0 = B0uz exerts on an
electron a torque of (m = −gP):
T = m × B0 = −gP × B0
(6.26)
Because of this torque, the electrons and their magnetic dipoles precess as
gyroscopes. The angle of precession, f, is shown in Figure 6.14. The rate
of change of the angular momentum equals the torque, or d P/dt = T. Thus
the equation of motion for a magnetic dipole is
d m
dt = −gm × B0
(6.27)
From this we can solve the angular frequency of precession (called the Larmor
frequency):
v0 = gB0
(6.28)
Let us assume that both a static magnetic field with a flux density of
B0 and a field of a high-frequency wave propagating into the z direction
interact with an electron. The wave is circularly polarized in the xy-plane
Figure 6.14 An electron precessing in magnetic field.

130
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
and has a flux density of B1 (<< B0). For a left-handed wave, B1 = B1
−=
B1(ux + juy). Now the total magnetic field is tilted by an angle of u =
arctan (B1/B0) with respect to the z-axis and precesses with the angular
frequency of the wave, v. The torque due to the field produces precession
of electrons in the counterclockwise direction in synchronism with the propa-
gating wave, and therefore f < u. From the equation of motion we solve
the component of the magnetic dipole moment m −that rotates in synchro-
nism with the left-handed circularly polarized wave
m −= gm0B1
v0 + v
(6.29)
where m0 = m cos f. Correspondingly, for a right-handed wave B1 = B1
+
= B1(ux −juy), both fields produce precession in the clockwise direction,
and therefore f > u, and
m + = gm0B1
v0 −v
(6.30)
In ferromagnetic materials, the magnetic dipole moments are aligned
parallel in regions called magnetic domains, even when no external field is
present. When an external field is applied, the domains tend to orient parallel
to the field. The magnetization of the material, or the magnetic dipole
moment per unit volume, is M = Nm, where N is the effective number of
electrons per unit volume. When the external field increases, nearly all
magnetic moments are aligned parallel to the field and a saturation magnetiza-
tion MS is finally reached. Then the whole ferrite body behaves like a large
magnetic dipole. The magnetic flux density in a saturated ferrite is
B = m0(H0 + MS)
(6.31)
As for a single electron, an equation of motion can be derived for
magnetization. Equations analogous to (6.29) and (6.30) are obtained for
circularly polarized waves by replacing m0 with Nm0. From these it follows
that the effective permeabilities for right-handed and left-handed circularly
polarized waves are
m+ = m0m+
r = m0S1 + gm0MS
v0 −vD
(6.32)

131

m−= m0m−

(6.34)
Thus the phase constant of a right-handed wave, b + = v√em+, and that
of a left-handed wave, b −= v√em−, are different.
6.2.2
Faraday Rotation
Let us consider a situation in which a plane wave propagates in ferrite in
the z direction. A uniform, static magnetic field pointing to the z direction
is applied over the ferrite. The wave is linearly polarized and the electric
field is directed along the x-axis at z = 0. A linearly polarized wave can be
divided into two orthogonal circularly polarized waves, as
E = uxE0 = (ux + juy) E0
2 + (ux −juy) E0
2
(6.35)
The phase constants of these two components are b −and b +. At
z = l the electric field is
E = (ux + juy) E0
2 e −jb −l + (ux −juy) E0
2 e −jb +l
(6.36)
This can be written as
E = E0e −j(b −+ b +)l/2 {ux cos [(b + −b −)l/2] −uy sin [(b + −b −)l/2]}
(6.37)
The phase shift of the resultant wave is (b −+ b +)l /2 and the tilt angle
with respect to the x-axis is

132
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
u = arctan (Ey /Ex ) = −(b + −b −) l
2
(6.38)
Hence the tilt angle of the polarization vector changes as the wave
propagates in a ferrite. This phenomenon is called the Faraday rotation. A
typical change is 100° per centimeter at 10 GHz.
If the direction of propagation is reversed, the tilt angle rotates in the
same direction with respect to the coordinate system. Therefore, as the wave
propagates back from z = l to z = 0, the tilt angle does not return back
from u to 0° but its value becomes 2u. Consequently, the Faraday rotation
is a nonreciprocal phenomenon.
Figure 6.15 shows how the phase and attenuation constants typically
behave in a ferrite. When v0 > v, b + > b −, and when v0 < v, b + < b −.
Thus, the direction of the Faraday rotation depends on whether the signal
frequency is smaller or larger than the resonance frequency. Close to the
resonance, the attenuation constant a+ is large. Well below the resonance
frequency, the attenuation constant is small, but then the difference between
b + and b −is small and the tilt angle rotates slowly.
Example 6.2
A linearly polarized wave at a frequency of f = 3 GHz propagates in a ferrite
into the direction of a static magnetic field with a flux density B0 = 0.14
Wb/m2. The ferrite has a saturation magnetization of m0MS = 0.2 Wb/m2
and a relative permittivity of er = 10. Find the length of such a ferrite body
that rotates the tilt angle by 90° as a wave passes through it.
Solution
Using (6.25) and (6.28) we find the resonance frequency v0 = gB0 = 24.64
× 109 1/s. Note that 1 Wb/m2 = 1 T = 104 gauss. The angular frequency

of the wave is v = 2pf = 18.85 × 109 1/s. From (6.32) and (6.33) we
get the effective permeabilities for right-handed and left-handed circularly
polarized waves as m+ = 7.08m0 and m−= 1.81m0, respectively. Correspond-
ingly,
the
phase
constants
are
b + = √er m+
r v/c = 8.41 v/c
and
b −= √er m−
r v/c = 4.25 v/c. Because b + > b −, the angle u is negative
and the tilt angle rotates counterclockwise as the wave propagates. By setting
u = −p/2 in (6.38) we solve l = p(b + −b −) = 12 mm. Also, lengths
producing a rotation of u = −p/2 −np (n is a positive integer) give a tilt
angle of −90° for the output wave. If the wave would propagate to the
direction opposite to the field, the tilt angle would rotate clockwise, as seen
to the direction of propagation, but in the same direction with respect to
the coordinate system as before.
6.2.3
Isolators
An ideal isolator passes signals in the forward direction without loss but
totally absorbs signals propagating in the reverse direction. In practice, the
insertion loss may be below 0.5 dB in the forward direction and more than
20 dB in the reverse direction for a good isolator. Isolators are used for
matching and for stabilizing oscillators against frequency changes due to
varying load impedance.
The operation of an isolator may be based on a ferromagnetic resonance,
on shifting of field pattern, or on the Faraday rotation. Figure 6.16 shows
a waveguide isolator. There is a ferrite rod in a circular waveguide in a static
magnetic field. Because of the Faraday rotation, the polarization of a wave
propagating in the forward direction turns 45° clockwise in the ferrite. This
wave does not attenuate significantly in the resistive cards at the input and
output, because the electric field is now perpendicular to both cards. The
polarization of a reverse wave turns 45° counterclockwise, as seen, to the
Figure 6.16 Waveguide isolator based on the Faraday rotation.

134
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
direction of propagation. The electric field is now parallel to the resistive
card at the output (output for reverse direction) and the wave is absorbed.
6.2.4
Circulators
An ideal circulator is an n-port device, which passes a signal applied in port
1 to port 2, a signal applied in port 2 to port 3, and finally a signal applied
in port n to port 1. Usually, a circulator has three ports.
A three-port circulator can be used as an isolator by terminating one
of the ports with a matched load. Circulators are used to separate the input
and output ports of such devices that are based on reflection (e.g., reflection
amplifier). Circulators are also used in radars to couple the transmitted power
to the antenna and the echo signals from the antenna to the receiver.
A circulator may be based on the Faraday rotation or on a direction-
dependent phase shift. The Y-junction circulator is the most common type.
A cylindrical ferrite is placed in the middle of a symmetric junction, as
shown in Figure 6.17. A static magnetic field is along the axis of the cylinder.
The operation of this circulator may be explained by two degenerate resonance
modes whose resonance frequencies differ due to the magnetic field [4, 5].
The operation range is between these two resonance frequencies.
6.3 Other Passive Components and Devices
In addition to the reciprocal power dividers and directional couplers and
nonreciprocal ferrite devices, many other passive devices and components
Figure 6.17 Y-junction circulator.

135
Passive Transmission Line and Waveguide Devices
are needed in radio engineering. Terminations, attenuators, phase shifters,
connectors, and adapters are briefly discussed here.
6.3.1
Terminations
Terminations are single-port components that are used for terminating trans-
mission lines, waveguides, and ports of different devices. Matched loads (in
an ideal case r = 0), shorts or short circuits (r = −1), and open ends or
open circuits (r = +1) are terminations that are commonly used in measure-
ments and in the calibration of measurement equipment.
A matched load absorbs all the power that is incident on it. Therefore,
the impedance of a matched load equals the characteristic impedance of the
line it terminates. A matched load can be realized by inserting a wedge, card,
or pyramid made of lossy material in the waveguide, as shown in Figure
6.18(a). The length of the load should be at least one wavelength. A matched
load is often adjustable; that is, the position of the absorber can be adjusted.
Then, in measurements requiring a good accuracy, we may eliminate the
effect of reflection from a nonideal matched load by performing the measure-
ments with several positions of the load. A good matched load may have a
VSWR less than 1.01. In a microstrip line, a matched load can be realized
by terminating the line with a thin-film resistor followed by a shorting pin,
as illustrated in Figure 6.18(b).
An ideal short circuit reflects the incident power totally. As a matched
load, a short also may be fixed or adjustable. With an adjustable short we
can realize a desired reactance: The impedance in a lossless line at a distance
of l from the short is
Z = jZ0 tan bl
(6.39)
A metal block tightly fit in a coaxial line or waveguide serves as a
simple short. However, in such a short the contact between the line and
metal block is erratic if the short is moved. Figure 6.19 shows a structure
Figure 6.18 Matched loads: (a) in waveguide; and (b) in microstrip line.

136
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

that is better suited for an adjustable short. It is made of high- and low-
impedance quarter-wave sections that operate as impedance inverters. If the
characteristic impedances of the low-impedance and high-impedance sections
are Z1 and Z2, respectively, the input impedance is
Zs =S
Z1
Z2D
2
Zs′
(6.40)
where Zs′ is the impedance indicated in Figure 6.19. Thus Zs is much lower
than Zs′, which already has a low value. The disadvantage of this short is
its narrow bandwidth, about 10%; the length of the sections is a quarter
wavelength only at a single frequency.
Often an open-ended line does not correspond well to an ideal open
circuit. The fringing fields of an open end of a coaxial line may be modeled
as a small capacitor or as an extension of the line. An open-ended waveguide
radiates effectively and operates as an antenna; thus, it does not resemble
an open circuit at all. An open-ended microstrip line is quite a good open
circuit; it only needs to be slightly shortened to compensate for the length
extension due to a fringing field.
6.3.2
Attenuators
An ideal attenuator passes a given part of the incident power, absorbs the
rest, and has matched ports. Lowering a power level, improving impedance
matching, and measuring power ratios are applications of attenuators. The
value of attenuation may be fixed or adjustable.

137
Passive Transmission Line and Waveguide Devices
Figure 6.20(a) shows two fixed coaxial attenuators made of series-
connected and parallel-connected resistors in a T and p configuration. In
a microstrip circuit, T and p attenuators can be realized with the same
principle using thin-film resistors. Figure 6.20(b) shows a simple microstrip
line attenuator. The waveguide attenuator shown in Figure 6.20(c) has a
resistive card in the middle of the broad wall along the direction of the E
field. The card is tapered to ensure good matching.
Figure 6.21 shows a continuously adjustable waveguide attenuator. It
has a rotating, circular waveguide section between a rectangular input and
output waveguide. All three sections contain thin resistive cards. The input
signal passes the first card with a negligible attenuation because the electric
field of the TE10 wave mode is perpendicular to the card. Then the wave
enters through a transition to the circular waveguide. The attenuation is
adjusted by rotating the circular waveguide section and the resistive card
within it. The field of the TE11 wave mode can be divided into two compo-
Figure 6.20 Fixed attenuators: (a) coaxial attenuators, T- and p-type; (b) microstrip attenu-
ator; and (c) waveguide attenuator.

138
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
nents, one perpendicular to the card and the other parallel to it. The latter
component is absorbed by the card; the former component enters the output
waveguide in which again its component parallel to the resistive card is
absorbed. We can show that the attenuation in decibels is [1]
L = −40 log (sin u ) dB
(6.41)
where u is the angle between the electric field at the input and the plane of
the resistive card in the circular section.
6.3.3
Phase Shifters
An ideal phase shifter is lossless and matched; it only shifts the phase of the
output wave, or in other words, changes the phase difference between the
output and input waves. Phase shifters are needed, for example, in phased
antenna arrays.
An adjustable waveguide phase shifter can be realized by replacing the
resistive card of the attenuator in Figure 6.20(c) with a dielectric card whose
depth in the waveguide is adjustable. A structure resembling the attenuator
in Figure 6.21 also operates as a phase shifter when the resistive cards are
replaced with dielectric cards having proper lengths [1]. Electrically controlled
phase shifters are much faster than mechanical phase shifters. They are often
based on semiconductor devices such as p-i-n diodes or field effect transistors
(FETs).
6.3.4
Connectors and Adapters
Connectors are needed to join different lines, devices, and circuit blocks
together. An ideal connector is matched and lossless. Practical connectors
cause small discontinuities. Therefore, unnecessary use of connectors should
be avoided. The quality of connectors gets more and more important as the
frequency gets higher.
Figure 6.22 shows some common coaxial connectors used at RF and
microwave frequencies. An APC-7 connector is a precision connector that
is used in measurements requiring good accuracy and repeatability. It is a
sexless connector whose inner diameter of its outer conductor is 7 mm. SMA
and N connectors are good enough for most cases. These connectors can
be either male or female type. BNC connectors work best at frequencies
below 1 GHz; at higher frequencies they may radiate. Waveguide components
have flanges at their ports. Alignment pins on the flanges ensure accurate
connection.

Adapters are needed to connect components having connectors of
different types or of the same sex. Figure 6.23(a) shows a transition from a
coaxial line to a microstrip line. Coaxial and waveguide components can be
connected using the adapter illustrated in Figure 6.23(b).

Resonators and Filters
Transmission line and waveguide devices, discussed in Chapter 6, would
ideally operate over a broad bandwidth. However, the useful bandwidth may
be limited, for example, by the frequency dependence of the line sections
that have proper electrical lengths only at the design frequency. Resonators
and filters are intentionally frequency-selective devices.
7.1 Resonators
Resonators are used for stabilizing the frequency of oscillators, as building
blocks of filters, as sensors in material measurements, and so on.
There are a large number of different resonator structures. Lumped
components, coils and capacitors, are usable in realizing resonators at radio
frequencies. Resonators based on the piezoelectric effect in a quartz crystal
operate up to the VHF range. In micromechanical resonators made using
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, electrical signals are cou-
pled with the mechanical vibrations of a resonating beam [1]. Micromachined
beam resonators may soon become usable at the UHF range. An open-
circuited or short-circuited line, a closed metal cavity, a cylindrical pill made
of a ceramic material, and a sphere made of ferrite (yttrium iron garnet,
YIG) are examples of resonators operating at microwave frequencies. Open
quasioptical resonators become usable in the millimeter-wave range and at
higher frequencies.

7.1.1
Resonance Phenomenon
A resonator is a structure having a natural frequency of oscillation. A circuit
consisting of a coil and a capacitor, shown in Figure 7.1, forms a simple
electromagnetic resonator. At first the switch is open and the capacitor is
charged to a voltage V. The electric field of the capacitor contains an energy
of We = CV 2/2, where C is the capacitance of the capacitor. After the switch
is closed, a current starts to flow through the coil. When the capacitor has
completely discharged, the current I is at maximum and the whole energy
of the circuit is in the magnetic field of the coil. This energy is Wm = LI 2/2,
where L is the inductance of the coil. Then the current will again charge
the capacitor, but now the polarity of the voltage is reversed. At resonance,
the average energy in the electric field CV 2/4 is equal to the average energy
in the magnetic field LI 2/4. The resonance frequency of the circuit is
fr =
1
2p√LC
(7.1)
If energy is applied to the circuit from an external source at the resonance
frequency and in the correct phase, the energy contained in the circuit will
increase. However, due to losses in the circuit, the energy does not increase
indefinitely. The losses are modeled with a conductance G in a parallel
resonant circuit and with a resistance R in a series resonant circuit, as shown
in Figure 7.2. Also, resonators made of transmission lines and waveguides
can be modeled with equivalent circuits containing lumped elements.
7.1.2
Quality Factor
The quality factor of a resonator is defined as
Q = vrW
Pl

where vr = 2pfr is the angular resonance frequency, W is the energy stored
in the resonator, and Pl is the power loss in the resonator.
When the energy source of the resonator is closed off, the stored energy
decreases from its original value W0 exponentially as W (t) = W0e −jdt. The
damping factor d = vr /(2Q) describes how fast the energy in the resonator
decreases. Conversely, when the energy source is switched on, the energy
increases from zero to its final value W0 as W (t) = W0(1 −e −jdt). The
larger the quality factor, the longer the time required to charge or discharge
the resonator.
Let us consider the parallel resonant circuit in Figure 7.2(a). The
analysis of a series resonant circuit is a dual case: We replace G with R,
interchange C and L, replace admittance quantities with impedance quanti-
ties, and replace current sources with voltage sources. Because the power
loss of the parallel resonant circuit is Pl = GV 2/2, the quality factor is
Q = vrW
Pl

G
=

Gvr L
(7.3)
The input admittance of the resonator is
Yin = G + jvC +
1
jvL
(7.4)
At the resonance frequency, the input admittance is real: Yin = G. At
frequencies close to the resonance, the input impedance is approximately
Yin ≈G + jDv2C = GS1 + j2Q Dv
vrD = G + jB
(7.5)

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
where Dv = v −vrX|Dv| << vrC, Hence on the Smith chart the input
impedance moves on a constant-conductance circle as the frequency changes.
Close to the resonance frequency, the susceptance B is directly proportional
to the frequency deviation Df = Dv/(2p) from the resonance frequency fr .
Let us assume that an ac current source is connected to the parallel
resonant circuit above. At resonance B = 0, and current flows through the
conductance G. The power loss in the resonator is now at its maximum.
The more the frequency deviates from fr , the larger the magnitude of the
susceptance and the smaller the current through the conductance. As Dv =
±Dv3dB = ±vr /(2Q), the real and imaginary parts of the input impedance
are equal, the magnitude of the admittance is √2G, and the phase of the
admittance is ±p/4. Then the power loss in the resonator is half of that at
the resonance frequency. Thus the quality factor may also be defined with
the half-power frequencies illustrated in Figure 7.3 as
Q =
vr
2Dv3dB
=

2Df3dB
(7.6)
In other words, the quality factor of a resonator is a measure of its
selectivity. The higher the quality factor, the narrower the frequency response
of a resonator.

A resonator may have one, two, or more couplings to the external circuit.
Figure 7.4 shows the normalized equivalent circuits of resonators having one

and two couplings. A generator (current source) having a normalized output
admittance of 1 is connected to port 1. The load admittance at port 2 of
the resonator having two couplings is gL .
Let us consider at first the resonator with one coupling. The normalized
input impedance is
yin = g + jb
(7.7)
The total conductance of the circuit is 1 + g, whereas that of the resonator
alone is g. Therefore, the resonance curve such as that in Figure 7.3 has a
peak that is broader by a factor of (1 + g)/g when the external coupling is
taken into account.
The power loss in the circuit is divided into two parts, for each of
which we can define a quality factor. The unloaded quality factor Q0 is
related to the loss in the resonator. Absorption in the metal walls and in
the dielectric medium and radiation into free space are the sources of this
loss. Q0 can be obtained from those frequencies fr ± Df0 at which g = b:

146
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Q0 =
fr
2Df0
(7.8)
The external quality factor Qe is a measure of losses in the external
circuit. From those frequencies fr ± Dfe at which 1 = b, we get
Qe =
fr
2Dfe
(7.9)
The loaded quality factor QL describes the losses of the whole circuit.
From frequencies fr ± DfL at which 1 + g = b, we get
QL =
fr
2DfL
(7.10)
Because the power loss is inversely proportional to the corresponding
quality factor, we can combine different loss components as
1
QL
= 1
Q0
+ 1
Qe
(7.11)
or in other words, the total loss equals the sum of the loss in the resonator
and the loss in the external circuit.
Figure 7.5 illustrates how the quality factors can be obtained from the
input admittance yin ( f ) presented on the Smith chart. From the intersection
points of yin ( f ) with the lines b = g, b = 1, and b = 1 + g, we get the
frequency deviations Df0, Dfe , and DfL , from which we calculate Q0, Qe ,
and QL using (7.8) through (7.10).
If Qe > Q0 (1 < g), the resonator loss at the resonance is larger
than the loss in the external circuit; the resonator is undercoupled. For an
overcoupled resonator, Qe < Q0 (1 > g), and the resonator loss at the
resonance is smaller than the external loss. The coupling is called critical
when Qe = Q0; then the resonator is matched to the generator at resonance.
For a resonator having two couplings we can define two external quality
factors: Qe1 for port 1 and Qe2 for port 2. The elements of the equivalent
circuits can also be represented using the quality factors as g = Qe1 /Q0,
gL = Qe1 /Qe2, and b = gQ02Df /fr = Qe12Df /fr . The transducer power
loss of the resonator is

Transmission Line Section as a Resonator
Let us consider a section of a short-circuited transmission line with a length
l, shown in Figure 7.6. Its series resistance, series inductance, and parallel
capacitance per unit length are R ′, L′, and C ′, respectively. For an air-filled
line the parallel conductance may be neglected. The input impedance of the
line is
Zin = Z0 tanh ( jbl + al ) = Z0
tanh al + j tan bl
1 + j tan bl tanh al
(7.13)
We assume that the total loss is small so that tanh al ≈al. Close to the
frequency fr , at which l = lg /2, tan bl = tan (p + pDf /fr ) = tan (pDf /fr ) ≈
pDf /fr . Now (7.13) simplifies to

Figure 7.6 Short-circuited lg /2-long transmission line and its equivalent circuit.
Zin ≈Z0(al + jpDf /fr )
(7.14)
The resistance is constant and the reactance is directly proportional
to the frequency deviation; thus a short-circuited lg /2-long transmission
line
resembles
a

circuit.
Because
Z0 = √L′/C ′,
a = (R ′/2)√C ′/L′, and bl = vr l√L′C ′ = p, then
Zin ≈R ′l/2 + jL′lDf
(7.15)
On the other hand, close to the resonance frequency, the input impedance
of a series resonant circuit made of lumped elements is
Zin ≈R + j2LDf
(7.16)
By comparing (7.15) and (7.16), we see the relationship between the
distributed quantities and the lumped elements of the equivalent circuit:
R = R ′l/2, L = L′l/2, and C = 1/(vr
2 L) = 1/(vr
2 Z0
2C ′l/2).
The reactance of a short-circuited 50-V line and that of a corresponding
LC series resonant circuit are compared in Figure 7.7. We see that close to
the resonance frequency these two circuits have nearly similar properties.
The quality factor of the transmission-line resonator is
Q = vr L
R
= vr L′
R ′

(7.17)
As before, we can show that an open-circuited lg /4-long line corre-
sponds to a series resonant circuit, whereas a short-circuited lg /4-long line
and an open-circuited lg /2-long line correspond to a parallel resonant circuit.

7.1.5
Cavity Resonators
Metal cavities can be used as resonators at microwave frequencies. A cavity
resonator has a closed structure, except for the couplings to the external
circuit, and thus has no radiative loss. The quality factor of a cavity resonator
may by high—several thousands or even more.
Often a cavity resonator is made of a section of a waveguide or a coaxial
line short-circuited at both ends. At resonance a standing wave is formed
in the cavity as the wave bounces back and forth between the ends. Thus
the length of the cavity is half of a wavelength or a multiple of that at the
resonance frequency. A given cavity has an infinite number of resonance
frequencies, unlike a resonator made of lumped elements.
Figure 7.8 shows three ways to couple a field into a cavity or from it:
a loop, a probe, and a hole. A prerequisite for an efficient coupling is that
Figure 7.8 Couplings to a cavity: (a) loop; (b) probe; and (c) hole.

150
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
the fields of the resonance mode have some common components with the
fields of the coupling element. Therefore, a loop at the maximum of the
magnetic field perpendicular to the field or a probe at the maximum of
the electric field along the field works as a good coupling element. In order
for the hole coupling to be successful, the fields of the waveguide and cavity
should have some common components at the coupling hole. Different
resonance modes that may be excited at a given frequency can often be
discriminated by choosing the proper position for the coupling element.
The coupling coefficient bci = Q0/Qei at port i is used to describe the
strength of the coupling.
Close to the resonance, a cavity resonator may be modeled with a
parallel resonant or series resonant RLC circuit. A parallel resonant circuit
may be transformed into a series resonant circuit and vice versa by changing
the position of the reference plane at which the resonator input is assumed
to be. Often it is more practical to treat a cavity resonator with its quality
factors.
Let us consider the air-filled rectangular cavity shown in Figure 7.9
[2]. We can regard it as a section of a rectangular waveguide having short
circuits at planes z = 0 and z = d. The phase constant of the TEnm and
TMnm wave modes is

This equation is valid for both the TEnm and TMnm wave modes. Resonance
modes having the same resonance frequency but a different field distribution
are called degenerate modes.
Let us study in more detail the resonance mode TE101, that is, a
resonance that is excited in a cavity that is half-wave long at the fundamental
wave mode TE10. This is the mode having the lowest resonance frequency
if b < a < d. We find the field distribution by summing up waves propagating
into the +z and −z directions:

The loss can be calculated if the surface current Js and the surface
resistance Rs are known on all walls of the cavity. The surface current, or
current per unit width, is
Js = n × H
(7.29)
where n is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface. Equations (7.25)
through (7.27) are valid in case of ideal, lossless conductors but they can
be applied with good accuracy in case of low-loss conductors. The power
loss is obtained by integrating over all the surfaces of the cavity:

Example 7.1
A cubical cavity resonator made of copper has a side length of 20 mm. Find
the resonance frequency of the fundamental mode and the quality factor.
Solution
The fundamental mode is TE101. When a = b = d = 20 mm, n = l = 1,
and m = 0, we get, from (7.21), the resonance frequency as f101 = 10.6
GHz. The conductivity of copper is s = 5.8 × 107 S/m. At the resonance
frequency the surface resistance is Rs = √vm0/(2s) = 0.027V. From (7.31)
or (7.32) we solve Q = 10,400. In practice Q is lower because Rs is higher
due to surface roughness and because couplings have some loss.
In principle, the quality factor of other resonance modes may be calcu-
lated the same way as the quality factor of the TE101 mode. Note that the
name of a resonance mode also depends on the choice of the coordinate
system. For example, the TE101 mode is called the TM110 mode if the y-axis
is chosen to be ‘‘the direction of propagation.’’ At a given frequency, the
higher the order of the resonance mode, the larger the cavity needed. As
the size of the cavity increases, the ratio of the volume to the surface area
increases, leading to a higher quality factor. In the case of a large cavity,
however, the resonance frequencies of different modes are close to each other,
and it is difficult to excite only a particular mode.
A cylindrical cavity is a section of a circular waveguide. The lowest
order resonance mode is TE111. At this mode the height of the cylinder is
lg /2 at the fundamental mode TE11. The resonance mode TE011 of a
cylindrical cavity is exceptionally important. This mode has a high quality
factor and no axial surface currents, which facilitates the realization of an
adjustable cavity because the moving short does not need to make a good
contact with the cylinder walls.
7.1.6
Dielectric Resonators
It is not possible to make high-quality resonators with microstrip techniques
because microstrip lines are rather lossy and radiate easily. However, dielectric
resonators [4] can easily be used in connection with microstrip circuits.
Dielectric resonators are usually small, cylindrical pills made of ceramic
materials such as Ba2Ti9O20, BaTi4O9, or (Zr-Sn)TiO4. Such materials
have a good temperature stability, low loss, and high dielectric constant,
typically er = 10 to 100. Because of the large dielectric constant, the size of

154
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
a dielectric resonator is much smaller than the size of a cavity resonator
operating at the same frequency. Electric and magnetic fields concentrate
within the resonator, but part of the field is outside the cylinder and this
part may be employed in coupling. The radiation loss is low and the quality
factor is mainly determined by the loss in the dielectric material. The unloaded
quality factor Q0 is typically 4,000 to 10,000 at 10 GHz. A given resonator
can operate at several resonance modes, of which the TE01d mode is the
most used.
Dielectric resonators are used in filters and transistor oscillators at
frequencies from 1 to 50 GHz. If the frequency of an oscillator is stabilized
with a dielectric resonator, it is called a dielectric resonator oscillator (DRO).
Figure 7.10 shows how a DRO is coupled to a microstrip line. The magnetic
fields of the line and the resonator have common components. The resonator
is simply placed on the substrate, and the strength of the coupling can be
adjusted by changing the distance of the resonator from the strip. To reduce
radiation loss, the structure is enclosed within a metal case.
7.2 Filters
A resonator with two couplings passes through signals having frequencies
near the resonance frequency; in other words, it acts as a bandpass filter. A
hollow metal waveguide acts as a highpass filter, because it has a cutoff
frequency that depends on the dimensions.
In general a filter is a two-port, which prevents propagation of undesired
signals while desired signals pass it. In an ideal case, there is no insertion loss
in the passband, but the attenuation in the stopband is infinite. Depending on
the appearance of these bands, the filter is said to be a bandpass, bandstop,
lowpass, or highpass filter. An ideal filter has a linear phase response, which
allows a signal containing several frequency components to pass through
Figure 7.10 Dielectric resonator coupled to a microstrip line.

155
Resonators and Filters
without distortion. Filters are used also for multiplexing (combining signals
at different frequencies) and demultiplexing (separating signals at different
frequencies). Also, reactive impedance matching circuits, tuning circuits in
oscillators and amplifiers, delay lines, and slow-wave structures act as filters.
In the design of filters, two basic methods are used: the image parameter
method and insertion loss method [3, 5, 6]. In the image parameter method,
simple filter sections are cascaded to provide the desired passband-stopband
characteristics. However, the required frequency response for the whole
frequency range cannot be exactly synthesized. An iterative design process
is used to improve the frequency response. On the contrary, the insertion
loss method allows the synthesis of an exact response. We study the insertion
loss method in more detail in the following section.
A filter design using the insertion loss method gives as a result a
circuit consisting of lumped elements. At microwave frequencies, distributed
elements are used instead of lumped ones as already discussed in Chapter
4. To realize distributed elements corresponding to the desired lumped
elements, we use transmission line sections and aid the design with Richards’
transformation, the Kuroda identities, as well as the impedance and admit-
tance inverters.
7.2.1
Insertion Loss Method
In the insertion loss method, the filter design and synthesis is started by
choosing the desired frequency response. This is followed by calculation of
the normalized (in terms of frequency and impedance) component values
for a lowpass filter prototype. These normalized component values can also
be obtained from tables presented in the literature [6]. Then the normalized
filter is converted to the desired frequency band and impedance level.
The insertion loss of a filter containing only reactive elements is obtained
from its reflection coefficient as
L =
1
1 −| r(v)|2
(7.34)
The power reflection coefficient | r(v)|2 of all realizable linear, passive
circuits can be expressed as a polynomial of v2, that is, it is an even function
of v. It follows from this fact that the insertion loss of (7.34) can always
be written as [3, 7]

156
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
L = 1 + P(v2)
Q2(v)
(7.35)
where P is a polynomial of v2 and Q is a polynomial of v.
The most frequently used filter responses are the maximally flat and
Chebyshev responses. In the following we study these filter responses in
more detail.
Maximally Flat Response
The maximally flat response is also called the
binomial or Butterworth response. It provides the flattest possible passband
for a given order of the filter, that is, in practice for a given number of
reactive elements. The insertion loss for the lowpass filter prototype is
L = 1 + k2S
v
vcD
2N
(7.36)
where N is the order of the filter and vc is its cutoff (angular) frequency.
Note that here Q2(v) = 1. The passband is from 0 to vc , and at vc the
insertion loss is L = 1 + k2. Most often the band edge is chosen to be the
3-dB point, and then k = 1. At frequencies well above the cutoff frequency
(v >> vc ) the insertion loss is L ≈k2(v/vc )2N and, thus, it increases 20N
dB per decade.
Chebyshev Response
The Chebyshev response is often also called the equal-
ripple response. The insertion loss is
L = 1 + k2T 2
NS
v
vcD
(7.37)
where TN is the Nth order Chebyshev polynomial, which can also be written
as

(7.38)
when 0 ≤v/vc ≤1, and
TNS
v
vcD = coshFN arcoshS
v
vcDG
(7.39)

157
Resonators and Filters
when v/vc ≥1. In the passband, L varies between values 1 and 1 + k2. At
v = 0 the insertion loss is L = 1 if N is odd, and L = 1 + k2, if N is even.
When v >> vc , L ≈k2(2v/vc )2N/4, which is to say, the insertion loss
increases 20N dB per decade, as is also the case with a maximally flat response.
The insertion loss is, however, 22N/4 times larger than that of a maximally
flat response of the same order. In Figure 7.11 these responses are compared
to each other.
Other important filter responses are the elliptic amplitude response
and the linear phase response. The insertion loss of the maximally flat
and Chebyshev responses increases monotonically in the stopband. In some
applications a given minimum stopband insertion loss is adequate but a
sharper cutoff response is desired. In such a case an elliptic filter is a good
choice [8]. In some other applications (e.g., in multiplexers) a phase response
as linear as possible is desired. Then a linear phase filter is the correct choice.
However, a good phase response and a sharp cutoff response are incompatible
requirements, so in designing a filter for a good phase response one must
compromise with the amplitude response.
A normalized lowpass filter consists of shunt (parallel) capacitors and
series inductors gk . The generator source impedance is g0 = 1V or the source
admittance is g0 = 1S, depending on whether the filter prototype starts with
a shunt capacitor or with a series inductor, respectively, and the cutoff
Figure 7.11 Maximally flat and Chebyshev (equal-ripple) responses of a lowpass filter
(N = 3, k = 1).

158
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
frequency is vc = 1. The order N of the filter is the number of reactive
elements in the filter. As already discussed, the first element may be a shunt
element, as in Figure 7.12(a), or a series element, as in Figure 7.12(b). The
response in both cases is the same. The element gN +1 is the load resis-
tance if gN is a shunt capacitor, and the load conductance if gN is a series
inductor.
With the equivalent circuits presented in Figure 7.12, it is possible to
calculate the component values that provide a given response. For the maxi-
mally flat response the prototype component values are g0 = 1, gN +1 = 1,
and
gk = 2 sinF
(2k −1)p
2N G
(7.40)
where k = 1 . . . N. For the Chebyshev response, calculation of the component
values is more difficult, so we omit it here. Tables 7.1 through 7.3 represent
element values for maximally flat and Chebyshev (equal ripple) lowpass filter
prototypes.
After the lowpass filter prototype design is completed, the circuit
designed is converted to the correct frequency and correct impedance level.

series element.

and an LC parallel circuit corresponds to a shunt capacitor of the lowpass

shunt capacitor of the lowpass prototype. In the equations for Figure 7.13,
v0 = √v1v2, D = (v2 −v1)/v0, and v1 and v2 are the limits of the

Resonators and Filters
The insertion-loss frequency response of a lowpass filter provides a
frequency response of a highpass filter, when in (7.36) and (7.37) v/vc is
replaced with vc /v. The frequency response of a bandpass filter is obtained
by replacing v/vc with the term (v/v0 −v0/v)/D, and that of a bandstop
filter by replacing v/vc with the term D/(v/v0 −v0/v).
7.2.2
Design of Microwave Filters
At microwave frequencies we have two major problems in realizing the
synthesized filters. First, good lumped elements do not exist; instead we
must use distributed elements. The frequency behavior of the distributed
elements is more complicated than that of the lumped ideal ones, which
makes the filter synthesis difficult. However, design of a narrow-band filter
is easy, because over a narrow bandwidth many distributed elements may
be modeled by ideal inductors and capacitors. Second, the filter elements
should be physically close to each other (in wavelength scale), which is often
impossible in practice. Therefore, transmission line sections must be used
to separate the filter elements.
Richards’ transformation is used to transform the lumped elements
into sections of transmission lines. Richards’ transformation [9]
V = tan bl = tan (vl/vp )
(7.44)
maps the v plane to the V plane. By replacing v with V, we can write the
reactance of an inductor and the susceptance of a capacitor, respectively, as
jXL = jVL = jL tan bl
(7.45)
jBC = jVC = jC tan bl
(7.46)
This means that an inductor can be replaced with a short-circuited
stub having an electrical length of bl and a characteristic impedance of L.
Accordingly, a capacitor can be replaced with an open-circuited stub having
an electrical length of bl and a characteristic impedance of 1/C. The cutoff
frequency of the transformed filter is the same as that of the prototype
(vc = 1), if V = 1 = tan bl, or l = lg /8. At frequencies where v differs a
lot from vc , the response of the transformed filter differs considerably from
the response of the prototype. The response is periodic, repeating every 4vc .
With the aid of the Kuroda identities [5, 10, 11] we can separate the
transmission line stubs physically from each other, transform the series stubs

162
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
into parallel stubs (or vice versa), and also transform characteristic impedances
to a more easily realizable level. Figure 7.14 shows the four Kuroda identities,
where an inductance represents a short-circuited stub, a capacitance represents
an open-circuited stub, and a box represents a transmission line with a
characteristic impedance marked in the box. All stubs are of the same length—
for example, lg /8 at the angular frequency of vc —and n2 = 1 + Z2 /Z1.
Example 7.2
Design a lowpass microstrip filter with the following characteristics: cutoff
frequency of 3 GHz, Chebyshev response with N = 3, ripple of 0.5 dB, and
filter impedance of 50V.
Solution
The element values for the prototype filter are g0 = G0 = 1, g1 = L1 =
1.5963, g2 = C2 = 1.0967, g3 = L3 = 1.5963, and g4 = GL = 1; see Table
7.2 and Figure 7.15(a). Using Richards’ transformation, we can transform
the inductances into series stubs and the capacitance into a parallel stub, as
shown in Figure 7.15(b). The length of all stubs is lg /8 at 3 GHz. Because

the series stubs cannot be realized with microstrip lines, we transform them
into parallel stubs using a Kuroda identity. In order to be able to do that, we
first add a transmission line section with a length of lg /8 and a characteristic
impedance of Z0 = 1 into both ends of the filter. These sections do not
affect the filter response because the generator and load are matched to these

164
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
lines. The second Kuroda identity of Figure 7.14, with Z1 = 1.5963,
Z2 = 1, n2 = 1 + Z2/Z1 = 1.6264, n2Z1 = 2.596, and 1/(n2Z2) = 0.615,
is then used for both ends of the filter. The result is shown in Figure 7.15(c).
Finally, the impedances are scaled by multiplying by 50V, and the line
lengths are calculated to be lg /8 at 3 GHz. The stub characteristic impedances
are 50n2Z2 = 81.3V, 50/C2 = 45.6V, and 81.3V, and the transmission
line sections between the stubs have a characteristic impedance of 50n2Z1
= 129.8V. In order to find the exact line lengths and widths we should
know the characteristics of the substrate and use (3.85) through (3.93).
However, a schematic layout is presented in Figure 7.15(d), and its calculated
frequency response is presented in Figure 7.15(e). When this response is
compared with that of a filter made of lumped elements, we observe that
in the passband the responses are nearly equal, but above the cutoff frequency
the insertion loss of the microstrip filter increases more quickly and the
response has another passband at 12 GHz.
As in the preceding example, in most filters we want to use only parallel
(or series) elements. In the microwave region we often prefer parallel stubs.
In addition to the Kuroda identities, this transformation can also be done
using impedance or admittance inverters. The impedance inverters are also
called the K-inverters and the admittance inverters the J-inverters. For exam-
ple, an ideal quarter-wave transformer is both a K- and a J-inverter. It
transforms a load impedance ZL into an impedance Zin = K2/ZL or a load
admittance YL into an admittance Yin = J 2/YL . Here K is the characteristic
impedance and J the characteristic admittance of the transformer. A quarter-
wave transformer, however, behaves approximately as an ideal inverter only
over a narrow bandwidth, and therefore this method is suitable only for
narrow-band filters. Figure 7.16 shows how a bandpass filter is transformed
into a filter circuit consisting only of either series or parallel resonators. The
characteristic impedance values of the impedance and admittance inverters
are presented in Table 7.4.
RaG , RaL , Lak , and Cak can be chosen freely, as long as the resonance
frequency of the resonant circuits is the same as the filter center frequency
or v0 = 1/√Lak Cak and the impedance values of the inverters are calculated
according to Table 7.4. We may also choose a value 1 for RaG and RaL , as
well as for the inverters, and then calculate values for Lak and Cak starting
from one end of the filter. The LC parallel or series resonant circuits can
be realized, for example, with open- and short-circuited transmission line
stubs with a length of lg /4 or its multiple (see also Section 7.1.4). The
characteristic impedance of a short-circuited stub with a length of lg /4 must

impedance of 50V.

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Solution
Now f1 = 950 MHz, f2 = 1,050 MHz, and f0 = 998.7 MHz. From Table
7.1 we can read the element values for the lowpass filter prototype: g0 =
RG = 1, g1 = C1 = 1, g2 = L2 = 2, g3 = C3 = 1, g4 = RL = 1. Let us
transform the lowpass prototype into a bandpass filter using the equations
presented in Figure 7.13: C1′ = C1/Dv0 = C1/(v2 −v1) = 1.592 × 10−9
= C3′, L2′ = L2/(v2 −v1) = 3.183 × 10−9. L1′, C2′, and L3′ are obtained
from condition Lk′Ck′ = 1/v0
2. L2′ and C2′ form a series resonant circuit in
series. Let us transform this into a shunt element using a J-inverter. We can
choose RaG = 1 and J = 1. From Table 7.4 we obtain Ca1 = C1′, Ca2 = L2′,
Ca3 = C3′, and RaL = 1. The parallel resonant circuits can be realized with
short-circuited
stubs
with
a
length
of
lg /4.
From
equation
zk = (p/4)√Lak /Cak = p/(4v0Cak ) we obtain the normalized characteristic
impedances of the lines: z1 = z3 = 0.079 and z2 = 0.039. The characteristic
impedances of the short-circuited parallel stubs are Z1 = Z3 = 4.0V and
Z2 = 2.0V. Between these stubs there are inverters with a 50-V characteristic
impedance and a lg /4 length. The short-circuited stubs may also be 3lg /4
long and then the characteristic impedances are three times these values.
However, they are still extremely hard to realize and the response differs
even more from the response obtained with a filter formed with lumped
elements.
7.2.3
Practical Microwave Filters
A large number of different possible structures can be used to realize a
synthesized filter. In the following we briefly describe some commonly used
filter structures. Other filters and their design rules are presented in the
literature [6].
A simple lowpass filter can be realized by coupling short transmission
line sections in series, with alternating low and high characteristic impedances.
A short (electrical length bl < p/4) line with a high characteristic impedance
Z0 corresponds approximately to a series reactance of
X ≈Z0 bl
(7.47)
Accordingly, a short line with a low characteristic impedance corresponds
to a parallel susceptance of
B ≈bl/Z0
(7.48)

167
Resonators and Filters
From the element values of the prototype filter we can calculate the
required electrical lengths of the lines. The ratio of the high and low imped-
ance should be as high as possible. The longer the line sections, the further
from the ideal the response will be. Usually there are also passbands at
higher frequencies. Figure 7.17 shows a microstrip layout of such a stepped-
impedance filter with six line sections. One must also remember that an
abrupt change in the microstrip line width causes a fringing capacitance,
which must be taken into account in determining the lengths of the sections.
The bandpass and bandstop filters consist of series and parallel resonant
circuits. In the microwave region the resonators can be realized in various
ways, and then filters can be constructed from them in a number of ways.
Figure 7.18(a) shows a bandpass filter consisting of open-circuited lg /2 long
microstrip lines that are side-coupled over a length of lg /4 to each other
[12]. This structure is suitable for filters with a passband width less than
20%. Figure 7.18(b) shows a microstrip bandpass filter consisting of end-
coupled lg /2 resonators. The small gap between the line ends corresponds
to a series capacitance. This capacitance is necessarily rather small due to
Figure 7.17 Microstrip layout of a stepped-impedance lowpass filter.
Figure 7.18 Microstrip layouts of bandpass filters: (a) side-coupled line resonators; and
(b) capacitive-gap coupled (end-coupled) line resonators.

168
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
limitations in fabricating small gaps using microstrip techniques, and there-
fore the resulting bandwidth is rather small.
A comb-line filter consists of resonators with a length less than lg /4,
which are grounded in one end and capacitively loaded in the other end.
Figure 7.19(a) shows a comb-line filter consisting of rectangular or circular
metal posts in a rectangular metal box. By adding a metal plate to the end
of each capacitively loaded resonator, the end capacitance can be increased.
A fine-tuning of the resonance frequency may be done with tuning screws.
An interdigital filter also consists of lg /4-long resonators, which are
grounded in one end and open in the other end, as shown in Figure 7.19(b).
This structure is suitable for a broad bandpass filter. The comb-line and
interdigital filters can also be manufactured using microstrip medium.
Figure 7.20 shows a bandpass filter made in a metal waveguide from
iris-coupled resonators. The resonator cavities are lg /2 long and separated
by thin metal walls, each containing a rectangular or circular inductive iris.
The resonance frequency of each individual resonator can be tuned with a
tuning screw through the broad waveguide wall in the middle of the resonator.
A waveguide-cavity filter, a comb-line filter, or an interdigital filter
can be made much smaller if the metal housing is filled with a ceramic of
Figure 7.19 (a) Comb-line filter; and (b) interdigital filter.
Figure 7.20 Bandpass filter made from waveguide cavities coupled through inductive
irises.

Resonators and Filters
high permittivity (er = 10 to 100). Such a ceramic interdigital filter at
5 GHz with a 100 MHz passband may have dimensions of 10 × 4 ×
3 mm3, and its insertion loss is typically 1 dB. Ceramic filters are used also
in mobile phones as duplex filters, with dimensions like 10 × 5 × 2 mm3,
but in this application such dimensions are considered large, and the tendency
is to move to using surface acoustic wave (SAW) or bulk acoustic wave (BAW)
filters [13, 14].
A SAW filter is based on an acoustic wave propagating on the surface
of a piezoelectric medium. The SAW filters are bandpass filters of a small size.
The electric signal is transformed into an acoustic wave with an interdigital
transducer and vice versa, as shown in Figure 7.21. The SAW filters are
usable to frequencies over 2 GHz. A 2-GHz SAW filter chip has an area of
1 × 1 mm2, but with the package it requires a somewhat larger area. Insertion
loss is typically 2 dB to 3 dB. A BAW filter is even smaller and provides
somewhat higher frequency selectivity because of higher Q compared to
SAW.
Although the basic filter theory has been around for a long time, there
are continuing advances in the synthesis methods. In particular, there are
continuous technological advances in SAW and BAW filters, in MEMS
tuning of micromechanical microwave filters, and in the more conventional
filter structures where high-temperature superconductors are now successfully
utilized.

Circuits Based on Semiconductor
Devices
In Section 1.4 we discussed early development of the radio. At first both
the transmitter and receiver were based on a spark gap. Then came a coherer
as a detector, and an electron tube was invented in 1904. Nowadays semicon-
ductor devices have replaced electron tubes in most applications.
8.1 From Electron Tubes to Semiconductor Devices
Electron tubes came into wide use in radio engineering in the 1910s. They
were used as oscillators, modulators, amplifiers, mixers, and detectors. A
suitable electron tube was developed for different applications: diode, triode,
tetrode, pentode, hexode, heptode, and octode. The names of the different
electron tubes are based on the number of electrodes: a diode has only a
cathode and an anode; a triode has in addition one grid, which can be used
to control the current from the anode to the cathode by a small applied
voltage the same way as is done today in the field-effect transistor (see Section
8.2.2); a tetrode has two grids; and so on. Although the transistor was
invented in 1948 and a semiconductor diode earlier, electron tubes are still
in use. They are used as transmitter tubes in LF, MF, HF, and VHF radio
broadcasting stations, and in some military electronics because of their high
tolerance for strong electromagnetic pulses.
Currently, in most radio applications we use semiconductor devices
for signal generation, amplification, detection, and so on. The advantages
171

of the semiconductor devices over the electron tubes are their small size,
low weight, low supply voltage, and long lifetime.
Circuits based on semiconductor devices may be either active or passive.
A circuit is said to be active if it generates RF power from dc power (oscillator)
or it amplifies an RF signal (amplifier). In a broader sense, we can consider
some other circuits as active: A mixer, frequency multiplier, detector, modula-
tor, and demodulator are all active because they convert power from one
frequency to another. However, not all circuits containing semiconductor
devices, that is, diodes and transistors, are active. They are also used to realize
switches, attenuators, phase shifters, and loads needed in impedance matching
(e.g., active matching in MMICs). Figure 8.1 presents standardized drawing
symbols of some circuits based on semiconductor components.
8.2 Important Semiconductor Devices
Semiconductor technology has advanced rapidly during the last decades.
Several types of diodes and transistors are available for RF and microwave
applications. The fastest transistors are usable at frequencies over 200 GHz
and the fastest diodes at frequencies over 3 THz. The structures and operation
principles of the most important diodes and transistors are treated in this
section. A more detailed analysis of their physics can be found in the literature
[1–3].
8.2.1
Diodes
The simplest semiconductor diode is the p-n diode shown in Figure 8.2(a).
It is based on the interface of p- and n-type semiconductors. The semiconduc-
tor is most often silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), or gallium arsenide (GaAs).

diode; and (e) I–V characteristic of a tunnel diode.
In a p-n junction, current is carried by minority carriers, that is, by holes
injected into the n-side and by electrons injected into the p-side. In the
forward direction the current increases exponentially as the applied voltage
increases as shown in Figure 8.2(d). In the reverse direction only a small
saturation current flows. Because of the large diffusion capacitance due to
the minority carriers, the use of the p-n diode is limited to low frequencies,
a few hundred MHz at maximum. The p-n diode is used in rectifiers and
detectors.
A reverse-biased p-n diode is used as a varactor, that is, as a voltage-
dependent capacitor. It is used as an electrically controlled tuning element, but
also in modulators, switches, frequency multipliers, and parametric amplifiers.
When an intrinsic (undoped) semiconductor layer is added in between
the p- and n-regions, a p-i-n diode, shown in Figure 8.2(b), is formed. The
intrinsic semiconductor layer decreases considerably the junction capacitance,
and therefore the p-i-n diode is well suited to many microwave circuits. It
is used in rectifiers, modulators, attenuators, switches, phase shifters, and
limiters.
A tunnel diode is a p-n junction with both sides very heavily doped,
as shown in Figure 8.2(c). The depletion region becomes very narrow and
therefore allows a remarkable tunneling current at a low forward bias. Its
I–V curve has a negative differential resistance region, as shown in Figure
8.2(e). The tunnel diode is well suited to oscillators and detectors.
In a forward-biased p-i-n diode, carriers are accumulated in the i-region
and therefore the diffusion capacitance is high. However, this accumulated

174
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
charge is suddenly released when the bias is reversed: A short reverse current
pulse is generated. This extremely nonlinear behavior is utilized in the step-
recovery diode, which is used in frequency multipliers and comb generators
for producing frequencies of high harmonic number [4].
The most important diode suitable for microwave detectors, mixers,
and frequency multipliers is the Schottky diode. It is an interface between
an n-type semiconductor (Si or GaAs) and a metal (Au, Pt, or Ti). Minority
carriers (holes) play a negligible role, and therefore a Schottky diode is very
fast, that is, it can switch from a conducting state to a nonconducting state
very quickly. GaAs-Schottky diodes are used up to 3 THz.
A Schottky diode can be contacted and packaged in many ways. In
Figure 8.3(a) an unpackaged, whisker-contacted Schottky diode is shown.
There are many small anodes on the surface of the GaAs chip; one of them
is contacted to the embedding circuit with a sharp wire, a whisker. The
planar Schottky diode shown in Figure 8.3(d) can be used as a flip-chip
component on a microstrip circuit, it can be encapsulated as a beam-lead
diode, or it can be integrated monolithically.
Figure 8.3(b) shows an equivalent circuit of a Schottky diode. It consists
of a voltage-dependent junction resistance Rj , a voltage-dependent junction

and (d) planar diode.

capacitance Cj , and a series resistance Rs . When the Schottky diode is
connected to a circuit, it always has a series inductance as well and may
have an extra fringing capacitance which both decrease its performance.
The I–V characteristic shown in Figure 8.3(c) is exponential as
I (Vj ) = Is (e aVj −1)
(8.1)
a =

hkT = 1

(8.2)
where Is is the saturation current, q is the magnitude of the electron charge,
h is the ideality factor, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the absolute
temperature. The ideality factor of a good diode at room temperature is
slightly above unity. The junction differential resistance is obtained from
the I–V characteristic as
Rj =S
dI
dVjD

=
1
a(I + Is ) ≈V0
I
(8.3)
The junction capacitance is also voltage dependent and behaves as
Cj (Vj ) =
Cj0
(1 −Vj /fi )g
(8.4)
where Cj0 is the junction capacitance at zero voltage, fi is the contact
potential, and g is a constant depending on the doping profile of the epitaxial
layer. For a GaAs–Pt junction fi is about 1 V. If the doping profile is
abrupt, we have g = 0.5.
When a Schottky diode is used as a detector or mixer, its figure of
merit is the cutoff frequency:
fc =
1
2pRs Cj
(8.5)
The series resistance Rs is mainly due to the low mobility of electrons
in the undepleted epitaxial layer; it is also called the spreading resistance.
At the cutoff frequency, one half of the voltage applied over the diode is
over the series resistance. The cutoff frequency should be much higher than

176
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
the operating frequency ( fc ≥10f ). A Schottky varactor has basically the
same structure and equivalent circuit as the mixer diode; its behavior is based
on the voltage-dependent capacitance, and it is used in frequency multipliers.
In oscillators a device with negative resistance is needed. Besides the
tunnel diode, a Gunn diode and an impact ionization avalanche transit time
(IMPATT) diode have a negative resistance region in their I–V characteristics.
The Gunn diode, named for its inventor but also called a transferred
electron device (TED), is not a rectifying diode but rather a piece of n-type
bulk semiconductor. Its negative resistance is based on the properties of the
energy band structure of the III–V semiconductors, such as GaAs or indium
phosphide (InP). In these semiconductors, electrons with sufficiently high
energy transfer from the main valley of the conduction band to a satellite
valley, where their effective mass is higher and their mobility lower than in
the main valley. Therefore, above a given electric field E = ET the average
drift velocity of electrons decreases while E increases; in other words, the
differential resistance of the semiconductor is negative. Figure 8.4 illustrates
the energy band structure and current density versus electric field in n-type
GaAs.
Figure 8.5(a) presents different structures of the IMPATT diode. When
a sufficiently high reverse voltage is applied over the diode, an avalanche
breakdown (electron-hole pairs are rapidly and increasingly created) occurs
in the p-n interface, where the electric field is highest. For example, in a
p+-n-n+ structure the holes go directly to the p+-region but the electrons
drift through the n-region (so-called drift region) to the n+-contact. When
an alternating voltage is applied over the diode in addition to the dc bias,
the phase of the generated electron pulse is 90° behind the voltage phase.
With a proper thickness of the n-layer, an additional phase shift of 90°
occurs, due to the drift time. Then the current and voltage of the diode are

GaAs.

in opposite phase, that is, its resistance is negative. An IMPATT diode must
be encapsulated so that the heat generated in the diode is effectively transferred
away.
8.2.2
Transistors
The most common transistor in RF applications up to a few gigahertz is
the bipolar transistor. In a bipolar transistor both electrons and holes act as
current carriers. A bipolar transistor is usually made of silicon. Figure 8.6
shows an n-p-n type bipolar transistor. Between the emitter (E) and collector
(C) there is a thin base (B) layer. In RF applications the transistor is usually
in common-emitter connection, that is, the emitter is grounded. Proper bias
voltages are applied to the base-emitter and collector-base junctions; then a
small change in the base current, DIB , causes a large change in the collector
current, DIC . The small-signal gain is
Figure 8.6 Bipolar transistor.

(8.6)
Parasitic capacitances and resistances and the drift times of carriers
limit the highest usable frequency of the bipolar transistor.
A heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is a faster version of the
bipolar transistor. Here heterojunction means an interface of two different
semiconductors; for example, the emitter is of Si and the base of SiGe, or
the emitter is of AlGaAs and the base of GaAs. Because of the heterojunction,
the base can be doped very heavily, and therefore the base resistance is small
and the transistor is operational at high frequencies.
Metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and metal-
semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) are field-effect transistors for
RF and microwave applications. MOSFETs fabricated using complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, commonly used for digital
microcircuits, are applicable for analog RF circuits up to several gigahertz.
GaAs MESFETs are useful up to millimeter wavelengths. Figure 8.7
shows a cross section of a MESFET and its small-signal equivalent circuit.
There is a thin n-type layer on an undoped substrate. This layer forms the
transistor channel, where electrons act as carriers. On the surface of the
channel layer there are two ohmic contacts, the source (S) and the drain
(D), and between them a short gate (G) contact, which forms with the
semiconductor a reverse-biased Schottky junction. As in the Schottky diode,
there is a depletion layer in the channel under the gate; the width of the
depletion layer depends on the gate voltage. Therefore, the gate voltage VGS
can be used to control the current between the source and drain, IDS . The
ratio of the changes in IDS and VGS with a constant VDS is called the
transconductance

A high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) or heterojunction field-effect
transistor (HFET) is a MESFET based on a heterojunction. In the HEMT
shown in Figure 8.8 an interface between n-type AlGaAs and undoped GaAs
forms the heterojunction. At the interface, on the side of GaAs, a very thin
potential well is formed, due to the mismatch of energy bands. The potential
well is so thin that the electrons attracted by the lower potential form a two-
dimensional electron gas in the well. Because the electrons drift in the
undoped semiconductor, they are not experiencing collisions with impurity
ions and therefore their mobility is higher than in a doped semiconductor.
Thus, a HEMT is faster than a conventional MESFET. HEMTs made using
InP technology are operational up to 200 GHz.

8.3 Oscillators
An oscillator is a circuit that transfers dc power to RF power [5–8]. The
generated RF signal may be sinusoidal or distorted because of containing
harmonic components. Important characteristics of an oscillator are its fre-
quency and tuning range, output power, frequency stability, and spectral
purity.
An oscillator may be modeled either as a feedback circuit providing a
nonzero output voltage for zero-input voltage or as a one-port circuit having
negative resistance. In this text we use the latter concept. An active element
having a negative resistance may be a diode or a potentially unstable transistor
(more about the stability of a transistor in Section 8.4). Figure 8.9 shows a
simplified equivalent circuit of an oscillator: A passive load impedance ZL
is connected to the input impedance Zin of an active component. The
impedance of the active element depends on both current and frequency,
that is,
Zin (I, f ) = Rin (I, f ) + jXin (I, f )
(8.10)
The load impedance depends on frequency:
ZL ( f ) = RL ( f ) + jXL ( f )
(8.11)
Before an oscillation starts, the circuit must be in an unstable state,
that is, Rin + RL < 0. Because RL is always positive, Rin must be negative.
Then any disturbance or noise may cause oscillation at some frequency f.
When the current increases due to oscillation, Rin must change to less
Figure 8.9 A simplified equivalent circuit of an oscillator.

181
Circuits Based on Semiconductor Devices
negative. A properly designed oscillator settles down in a stable operation.
Then, according to Kirchoff’s law (Zin + ZL )I = 0, or
Rin (I0, f0) + RL ( f0) = 0
(8.12)
Xin (I0, f0) + XL ( f0) = 0
(8.13)
The final, stable oscillation frequency f0 is usually different from the
original frequency. In a stable condition, any disturbances of current or
voltage are damped, and after a disturbance the oscillator rapidly returns
into its stable state.
The load is a circuit with a high quality factor Q; it is for example an
LC circuit, quartz crystal, cavity, YIG, or dielectric resonator. Then XL
changes fast as a function of frequency, and the reactance equation, (8.13),
determines the oscillation frequency. In practice, RL is nearly independent
of frequency. The higher the Q, the more stable the oscillation state. The
oscillation may also be stabilized by using injection locking or phase locking.
In the injection locking, a weak signal from an accurate frequency standard
is fed into the oscillator. In the phase locking, the output frequency is
compared to an accurate signal derived from a frequency standard (see Section
11.1). The frequency standard is usually a crystal-controlled oscillator, the
frequency of which may be further stabilized by controlling the temperature
of the quartz crystal.
Suitable diodes having a potential negative resistance for an oscillator
are Gunn, IMPATT, and tunnel diodes. Only a proper bias voltage is needed
to produce a negative resistance. A transistor oscillator may be based on a
bipolar transistor in the common-emitter connection, or on an FET in the
common-gate connection. Other configurations are also possible. A negative
resistance is realized by connecting to the input port of the transistor a load,
which makes the transistor unstable. Then the reflection coefficient seen
toward the transistor in the output port is greater than unity; that is, the
real part of the impedance is negative. The instability may be increased with
feedback.
Bipolar transistors are used in oscillators up to about 20 GHz. HBT
operates at higher frequencies, up to 50 GHz. These both have 10 dB to
15 dB lower phase noise, that is, a cleaner spectrum near the oscillation
frequency, than an FET oscillator has. MESFET is suitable for oscillators
up to 100 GHz and HEMT to 200 GHz. The Gunn oscillator operates in
the fundamental mode to about 100 GHz, and in harmonic mode up to
200 GHz. IMPATT oscillators are used even at 300 GHz. The spectrum

182
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
of an IMPATT oscillator is rather noisy. The amplitude noise is especially
strong; that is, the spectrum is noisy even far away from the oscillation
frequency. Output powers available from semiconductor oscillators are pre-
sented in Figure 8.10. Tube oscillators provide much higher powers; for
example, a klystron at 1 GHz or a gyrotron at 100 GHz may produce over
1 MW.
There are several alternative ways to tune the oscillation frequency.
According to (8.13), the frequency f0 depends on the reactance of both the
active element and the load. Therefore the frequency can be tuned either
mechanically or electrically. The resonance frequency of a cavity is tuned
by changing its length, for example, by moving a short circuit in the end
of the cavity. A Gunn oscillator may be tuned mechanically over an octave,
and an IMPATT oscillator over ±10%. The resonance frequency of a dielec-
tric resonator is tunable mechanically about ±2% by changing the distance
of a metal plate or a screw above the resonator pill. With bias tuning the
Gunn oscillator frequency changes about ±1%, and that of an IMPATT
oscillator over ±5%. As mentioned before, a varactor is a voltage-dependent
capacitor. With a varactor in the embedding circuit, a transistor oscillator
may be tuned electrically about an octave. The varactor tuning is also often
Figure 8.10 Output powers available from semiconductor oscillators.

183

used in oscillators stabilized with a DRO, but then the tuning range is small.
A varactor tuning (Schottky varactor) is used up to 50 GHz. Such a voltage-
tuned oscillator is often called a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).
Figure 8.11 shows a 5.43-GHz transistor oscillator on a microstrip. A
bipolar transistor is in the common-collector connection. The base impedance
is made to be in an unstable region. The frequency is determined by a DRO
and may be tuned electrically about ±1 MHz by changing the dc bias of a
varactor.
Signal generators, especially sweepers, often utilize transistor oscillators,
the frequency of which is tuned using a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) resonator.
The YIG material is ferrite. In a static magnetic field the YIG resonator has
a resonance at microwave frequencies. The YIG resonators are spherical,
having a diameter of 0.2 mm to 2 mm. The resonator is coupled to the
embedding network with a current loop around the sphere, as shown in
Figure 8.12. The unloaded Q is about 10,000. The resonance frequency
depends linearly on the magnetic field strength, which in turn depends
linearly on the dc current of the magnet coil. The frequency tuning range
can be 2–3 octaves, making it very useful for sweep generators. The YIG
resonators are used up to 50 GHz.
The electric frequency tuning of an oscillator is also utilized in phase
locking, frequency modulation, and demodulation. Frequency modulation
(FM) (see Section 11.3) may be realized by modulating the control voltage
of a VCO. Demodulation of an FM signal can be made by phase locking
the frequency of a VCO to the received signal. The VCO control voltage
is then the demodulated FM signal.

and voltage tuned with a varactor.

8.4 Amplifiers
Amplifiers based on semiconductor devices are of either transmission (trans-
conductance) or reflection type. In transconductance type amplifiers, bipolar
and field-effect transistors are used as active elements. Silicon bipolar transis-
tors are applicable up to 10 GHz, HBTs to 50 GHz, GaAs-MESFETs to
100 GHz, and HEMTs to 200 GHz. Transistor amplifiers are used as low-
noise preamplifiers (LNAs) in receivers, as power amplifiers (PAs) in transmit-
ters, and as intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers in both receivers and
transmitters.
8.4.1
Design of Small-Signal and Low-Noise Amplifiers
In the following we study the design of a narrowband, small-signal amplifier
(for more details, see [7–10]). The design of matching circuits may be based
on the equivalent circuit of the transistor or its scattering parameters. We
use the S-parameters as the starting point. Figure 8.13 presents a two-port
Figure 8.13 A two-port as an amplifier.

185
Circuits Based on Semiconductor Devices
(a transistor), the S-parameters of which are determined in reference to the
reference impedance Z0 (characteristic impedance of the transmission line).
The small-signal S-parameters of a transistor depend on frequency and
operating point, that is, on bias voltages and currents. The manufacturer
usually reports typical values of the S-parameters (in reference to 50V) versus
frequency in a few operating points. The load impedance of the two-port
is ZL , and the impedance of the feeding generator is ZS . The reflection
coefficients of the terminations in the input and output are
rS = ZS −Z0
ZS + Z0
(8.14)
rL = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
(8.15)
The input reflection coefficient seen toward the two-port can be pre-
sented using the normalized voltage waves as
rin = b1
a1
(8.16)
Accordingly, in the output we have
rL = a2
b2
(8.17)
We can solve rin using a signal flow graph, as we did in Section 5.3;
see (5.24):
rin = S11 + S21S12 rL
1 −rL S22
= S11 −rL D
1 −rL S22
(8.18)
where
D = S11S22 −S12S21
(8.19)
The output reflection coefficient seen toward the two-port is
rout = S22 −rS D
1 −rS S11
(8.20)

186
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
A transistor amplifier provides the maximum available power gain
Ga,max when both ports are conjugately matched. This condition can be
written as
rin = rS* and rout = rL*
(8.21)
By substituting these into (8.18) and (8.20) we obtain generator and load
reflection coefficients (in reference to 50V) rSM and rLM , respectively, that
both the input and output are simultaneously matched:
rSM =
B1 7 √B 2
1 −4|C1|2
2C1
(8.22)
rLM =
B2 7 √B 2
2 −4|C2|2
2C2
(8.23)
where
B1 = 1 + |S11|2 −|S22|2 −|D|2
(8.24)
B2 = 1 −|S11|2 + |S22|2 −|D|2
(8.25)
C1 = S11 −DS *22
(8.26)
C2 = S22 −DS *11
(8.27)
If B1 > 0 and |B1/2C1| > 1, one must select the negative sign in
front of the square root in (8.22) in order to have | rSM | < 1, that is, to
be able to realize the input matching circuit using passive elements. Accord-
ingly, for the output, if B2 > 0 and |B2/2C2| > 1, one must select the
negative sign in (8.23). For a unilateral transistor (S12 = 0), rSM = S11* and
rLM = S22*.
The maximum available power gain can be presented in the following
form:
Ga,max = |S21|
|S12|XK −√K 2 −1C
(8.28)

187
Circuits Based on Semiconductor Devices
where
K =
1 −|S11|2 −|S22|2 + |D|2
2|S12S21|
(8.29)
The use of (8.28) requires that K ≥1; otherwise Ga,max becomes complex.
Generally, the matching circuit provides the maximum available power
gain only at the design frequency. When the frequency moves away from
the design frequency, gain decreases rapidly. The bandwidth can be made
wider if we are satisfied with a gain lower than Ga,max . In that case a small
mismatch is purposely designed in both the input and output. Design is
aided by using constant gain circles drawn on the Smith chart.
A transistor amplifier is not necessarily stable. Oscillation is possible
if the real part of the input or output impedance is negative. This means
that | rin | > 1 or | rout | > 1. If | rin | < 1 and | rout | < 1 with all generator
and load impedance values, the amplifier is unconditionally stable. In other
cases the amplifier is potentially unstable. From conditions | rin | = 1 or
| rout | = 1 we can calculate boundaries for the stable regions of input and
output impedances. On the Smith chart these boundaries are circles, as
shown in Figure 8.14. The output impedance stability circle is defined by
the center point cL and radius rL as
Figure 8.14 Output stability circles on the Smith chart. Shaded areas are stable when
|S11| < 1. The center point of the Smith chart is (a) outside the stability circle,
and (b) inside the circle.

188
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
cL = (S22 −DS11* )*
|S22|2 −|D|2
(8.30)
rL = |
S12S21
|S22|2 −|D|2|
(8.31)
Either the inside or outside of the stability circle presents the stable
region. If |S11| < 1, the center point of the Smith chart is in the stable
region. If, however, |S11| > 1, the Smith chart center point is in the un-
stable region. The center point cS and radius rS of the input stability circle
are obtained by replacing S22 with S11 and vice versa in (8.30) and (8.31).
It can be proven that the necessary and sufficient conditions for the uncondi-
tional stability are K > 1 and |D| < 1. It may be worth checking that rS
and rL are in the stable region not only at the operating frequency but also
at other frequencies.
In addition to gain and stability, a third important characteristic of an
LNA is its noise factor F (for more detail see Section 11.2). A transistor has
four noise parameters: minimum noise factor Fmin , magnitude and phase
of optimum input reflection coefficient ropt (F = Fmin , when rS = ropt ),
and equivalent noise resistance Rn [11]. The noise factor can be presented
as a function of the generator admittance YS = 1/ZS as
F = Fmin + Rn
GS |YS −Yopt|2
(8.32)
where GS is the real part of YS and Yopt is the admittance corresponding to
ropt . The load impedance ZL affects the gain but not the noise factor. In
general, it is not possible to obtain the minimum noise factor and maximum
gain simultaneously, but one must make a compromise. This can be helped
by using constant noise circles calculated from (8.32) on the Smith chart,
together with constant gain circles as shown Figure 8.15.
In addition to the design of matching circuits according to proper rS
and rL , the completion of the design work requires also design of circuits
for bias voltages. Figure 8.16 shows an example of a practical realization: a
22-GHz HEMT amplifier. The low-impedance microstrip line sections in
the input and output provide rS for the minimum noise factor and rL for
the conjugate match of output (in order to optimize gain). Bias voltages to
the gate and drain are supplied through high-impedance lines. At a distance
of l/4 from the feed point there is a radial stub short circuit in each of

these lines. These are needed in order to have the bias circuits seen as open
circuits from the transistor. The function of the thin-film resistors is to
prevent low-frequency oscillations. The interdigital capacitors in input and
output prevent dc from flowing out, but are only negligible series reactances
at RF.
Example 8.1
Design a transistor amplifier at 4 GHz for maximum available gain. The
scattering parameters in the desired operation point VDS = 3 V and IDS =
10 mA are S11 = 0.70∠−115°, S21 = 2.50∠70°, S12 = 0.04∠55°, and
S22 = 0.65∠−40°.
Solution
First we must check the stability of the transistor. From (8.19) we obtain
D = 0.544∠−150°, and from (8.29) K = 1.917. Therefore, the transistor is
unconditionally stable at 4 GHz. We do not need to calculate the stability
circles; they are totally outside the Smith chart. Next we calculate the reflec-
tion coefficients, providing a conjugate match in the input and output.
From (8.24) through (8.27) we calculate B1 = 0.772, B2 = 0.637, C1 =
0.349∠−120°, and C2 = 0.273∠−47°. From (8.22) and (8.23) we obtain
reflection coefficients rSM = 0.636∠120° and rLM = 0.566∠47°. Equation
(8.28) gives Ga,max = 17.6 = 12.5 dB. Because both ports are conjugate
matched, it holds that Ga,max = Gt = Gp = Ga , which may be verified using
(5.26) through (5.28). The matching circuits can be realized, for example,
according to Figure 8.17 using open-circuited parallel stubs. All transmission

lines are 50-V microstrip lines. In this realization we have not taken into
account the fringing components of the microstrip T-junctions and open
ends [12]. Another often used matching method in transistor amplifiers is
an alternating high-low-impedance line. A manual design of amplifiers and
other circuits becomes excessively laborious if all parasitic effects are taken
into account and the circuit has to operate over a broad band. Then use of
a computer-aided design (CAD) package significantly facilitates the design.
8.4.2
Effect of Nonlinearities and Design of Power Amplifiers
In the previous study we assumed that the transistor characteristics did not
depend on the signal level, that is, the transistor operates in linear, small-signal
conditions. However, as the input power level increases, the nonlinearities of
the transistor cause gain compression and generation of spurious frequency
components.
As the input power level increases, the gain of an amplifier is constant
at small signal levels but finally starts to decrease. Often the bias voltages
limit the maximum output voltage. This saturation or gain compression is
characterized by the 1-dB compression point, which is the output power at
which the gain has decreased by 1 dB from its small-signal value.
Because of the compression, the output waveform is distorted. This
distortion produces harmonics nf of a single input signal at frequency f and
intermodulation products mf1 + nf2 (m, n = ±1, ±2, . . . ) of a two-tone
input signal. The order of intermodulation products is defined to be
|m| + |n|. Especially important are the third-order intermodulation products
at frequencies 2f1 −f2 and 2f2 −f1 because they are close to frequencies
f1 and f2, if f1 ≈f2. At low input signal levels, the power of third-order
intermodulation products increases by 3 dB as the power of input signals
having equal magnitudes increases by 1 dB. If there were no compression,
the output powers of the desired signals at f1 and f2 and the third-order
products would be equal at an output power level called the third-order
intercept point, IP3.
The dynamic range of an amplifier is that operating power range over
which the amplifier has desirable characteristics. Noise usually sets the lower
limit of dynamic range. The upper limit of the linear dynamic range may
be defined as the 1-dB compression point. The spurious-free dynamic range
is limited by the power level, which produces unacceptable intermodulation
products.
In the design of a power amplifier, the theory presented here for getting
proper rS and rL is valid only if the scattering parameters are measured in

192
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
large-signal conditions, that is, at a power level corresponding to the real
operation. A power amplifier is designed so that both input and output is
conjugate matched, because this provides the maximum gain. Power amplifi-
ers are divided into different classes. A class-A amplifier operates linearly.
The bias voltages and signal amplitude are chosen so that output current
flows during the full signal period, as shown in Figure 8.18. In a class-B
amplifier the output current flows only during one-half of the period, and
in a class-C amplifier less than one-half of the period. These amplifiers
operate very nonlinearly but they transform dc power more effectively into
RF power than a class-A amplifier. A good efficiency is obtained also with
class-D, class-E, and class-F amplifiers in which the transistors operate as
switches.
In comparing different power amplifiers, an often used figure-of-merit
is the power-added efficiency
PAE = PL −Pin
Pdc
(8.33)
where PL is the RF power coupled to the load, Pin is the RF power coupled
to the amplifier, and Pdc is the dc power absorbed by the amplifier. When
a very high power level is needed, several amplifiers may be combined parallel
using a power combiner (see Section 6.1).
8.4.3
Reflection Amplifiers
The reflection-type amplifier is based on the negative resistance of, for
example, a Gunn or IMPATT diode. The power gain of a reflection-type
amplifier is

where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and Zd
is the diode impedance. If for example Z0 = 50V and Zd = −25V, gain is
G = (75/25)2 = 9 = 9.5 dB. The input and output signals can be separated
by using a circulator according to Figure 8.19.
8.5 Frequency Converters (Mixers) and Frequency
Multipliers
The output signal from a linear circuit has shape similar to that of the input
signal; however, its amplitude may be higher (amplifier) or lower (attenuator).
In a nonlinear circuit the signal is distorted, and the output signal (voltage
Vo ) is a nonlinear function of the input signal (voltage Vi ) and can be
presented as a power series
Vo = f (Vi ) = AVi + BVi
2 + CVi
3 + . . .
(8.35)
Figure 8.20 illustrates the difference between a linear and nonlinear
transfer function. If, in the case of a nonlinear transfer function, the input
signal is weak and causes only a small perturbation in the vicinity of the
operating point, the circuit can be considered linear for the signal; that is,
dVo = A′dVi , where A′ is the slope of the curve f (Vi) in the operating

point. We call this situation the small-signal condition. In a large-signal
condition, several terms of (8.35) must be taken into account.
Let us assume that Vi = V1 cos v1t + V2 cos v2t. Then the term
AVi contains signal components at frequencies f1 and f2, term BVi
2 contains
components at frequencies 0 (dc), 2f1, 2f2, and f1 ± f2, and term CVi
3
contains components at frequencies f1, f2, 3f1, 3f2, 2f1 ± f2, and 2f2 ± f1
(a frequency may be also negative). We note that when a sinusoidal signal
at frequency f1 is fed to a nonlinear circuit, the output contains harmonics
at frequencies mf1, and when two sinusoidal signals at frequencies f1 and
f2 are fed to a nonlinear circuit, the output contains components at frequen-
cies mf1 + nf2 (m and n are integers). These nonlinear characteristics make
possible the operation of a frequency converter, or a mixer and a frequency
multiplier. Note that a mixer may also be based on a time-dependent linear
circuit. In a circuit meant to be linear, such as a low-noise amplifier, the
distortion due to nonlinearity produces unwanted frequency components.
8.5.1
Mixers
A mixer is a circuit that converts the frequency of a signal up or down so
that the information contained in the signal is preserved. Upconverters are
used in modulators and transmitters, downconverters in heterodyne receivers
and demodulators. In Figure 8.21, a signal at frequency fs and a local oscillator
signal at fLO are fed to a downconverter; then at the output we have a signal
at a low intermediate frequency fIF = | fs −fLO |. Processing of the signal
at fIF is much easier than that of the original signal at fs . The conversion
loss Lc is defined as
Lc = Ps,av
PIF
=
Available power at fs
Power coupled to load at fIF
(8.36)

195

Figure 8.21 Mixer as a downconverter.
As in case of an amplifier, a mixer is linear for a low-power signal (Ps
< PLO /100) but at higher powers the output signal will be distorted. Thus
we can define a 1-dB compression point and a third-order intercept point
for a mixer, too.
The nonlinear element may be a diode or a transistor, most often a
Schottky diode, bipolar transistor, or FET. Diode mixers are passive; transis-
tor mixers may operate in an active mode and have some conversion gain.
Transistor mixers suit well in integrated circuits. Operation of a diode mixer
is based on the exponential I–V characteristic, but frequency conversion
takes place also in the nonlinear capacitance. In a bipolar transistor the
emitter-base junction forms a diode. Therefore, in a common-emitter connec-
tion the collector current depends exponentially on the base voltage. In an
FET the drain current IDS is a nonlinear function of the gate voltage VGS .
Especially a dual-gate FET (DGFET) is well suited as a mixer, because the
RF signal can be fed to one gate and the local oscillator signal to another
gate.
In case of a diode mixer, frequency conversion can be analyzed as
follows; for equations see [13, 14]. Using the embedding impedances loading
the diode at frequencies mfLO we calculate the waveforms of the conductance
Gj (t) = 1/Rj (t) and capacitance Cj (t) caused by the local oscillator signal
and a possible dc bias. The better the diode corresponds to an ideal switch
operating at fLO , the more effective frequency conversion is. The signal ( fs )
power is usually very small compared to the LO signal ( fLO ) power; then
from the signal’s point of view the mixer is a linear, time-dependent circuit.
The operation of a mixer depends on conditions not only at the signal
and IF frequency, but also at the sidebands mfLO ± fIF because power may
convert from any sideband to another. Especially important is the image
sideband fi = 2fLO −fs . Frequencies mfLO ± nfIF (n ≥2) are important
only if the signal power level is of the same order as that of the LO. Using

196
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
the Fourier series of Gj (t) and Cj (t) we can then calculate a frequency
conversion matrix. With this and the load impedances we obtain conversion
efficiencies between any two sidebands. Figure 8.22 illustrates the conversion
from a frequency fs to different sidebands.
In designing a mixer, it is important to find the correct load impedances
at different sidebands. The conversion loss is at minimum when there is a
conjugate match between the nonlinear element and the embedding network
at signal and intermediate frequencies, and the other sidebands are terminated
with proper, purely reactive loads. The noise optimum requires slightly
different conditions the same way as in case of an amplifier. In practice,
mixer design today is carried out with a CAD package employing a harmonic
balance [13, 14] simulator.
Depending on which sidebands are selected as the signal bands, we
have different mixers. A single-sideband (SSB) mixer converts the signal only
from one sideband, either from the upper sideband fLO + fIF or from the
lower sideband fLO −fIF , to the intermediate frequency band. A double-
sideband (DSB) mixer converts both sidebands to the IF band. Two DSB
mixers can be combined to form an SSB mixer, which is then called an
image-rejection mixer: The outputs of the individual mixers are combined
in phase in case of the desired sideband while the outputs cancel each other
in case of the image sideband. A harmonic mixer converts the sidebands of
an LO harmonic mfLO ± fIF (m ≥2) to the IF band.
There are a number of different mixer structures or architectures [14].
Figure 8.23 presents the principle of a single-ended, a balanced, and a double-
balanced diode mixer, as well as of a double-balanced transistor mixer. For
simplicity, the matching and bias circuits are omitted in Figure 8.23. At
millimeter wavelengths the mixers are often single-ended waveguide mixers,
where the signal and LO are fed to the diode along the same waveguide
after combining them in a directional coupler. At RF and microwave frequen-
cies most often balanced and double-balanced mixers are used, and signal
and LO power are fed to the nonlinear elements using 3-dB hybrids (described

in Section 6.1). At low radio frequencies tapped transformers are used. The
balanced and double-balanced mixers have many advantages over the single-
ended mixer: There is a good isolation between the signal and LO ports,
the AM noise of the LO is rejected, certain spurious signals are rejected,
and the compression and intercept points are higher. In a double-balanced
mixer there is a good isolation also between the IF and other ports. A
disadvantage of balanced and double-balanced mixers is their higher LO
power requirement. The Gilbert cell mixer shown in Figure 8.23(d) is a
double-balanced transistor mixer, which is widely used in integrated circuits.
8.5.2
Frequency Multipliers
In a frequency multiplier, harmonic signals at frequencies nf are generated,
and using a filter one of them is selected as the output signal. This way we

198
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
can realize frequency doublers (x2), triplers (x3), quadruplers (x4), quintuplers
(x5), and so on [15, 16]. A frequency multiplier helps in generating signals
at high frequencies where it is otherwise difficult or impossible. Also a signal
generated by a multiplier may have a more accurate frequency than a signal
produced directly with an oscillator.
The nonlinear element may be either a diode (either resistive or capaci-
tive diode, i.e., a varistor or a varactor, respectively) or a transistor. The
multiplication efficiency h is defined as
h =
Power coupled to load at nf
Available power from source at f
(8.37)
In order to optimize the frequency multiplication efficiency, the nonlin-
ear element must be conjugate matched to the embedding network at the
input and output frequencies and terminated with proper, pure reactive
loads at other harmonic frequencies. Especially important are the proper
reactive terminations at the idler frequencies (intermediate harmonics
between the fundamental and output frequency) in higher-order multipliers.
The efficiency h of a multiplier based on a nonlinear reactive element is at
maximum unity at any multiplication factor n, if both the nonlinear element
and the embedding network are lossless (Manley–Rowe equations; see [17]).
In practice the efficiency decreases rapidly versus an increasing multiplication
factor. A positive, monotonically voltage-dependent nonlinear resistance can
produce a multiplication efficiency of 1/n2 at maximum. The efficiency of
a transistor multiplier may be greater than unity.
8.6 Detectors
Detecting a signal requires transforming it into a useful or observable form.
In a diode detector an RF signal is transformed into a voltage proportional
to the signal power. Operation of a detector is based on the nonlinearity of
a diode, such as a Schottky or p-n diode. When a sinusoidal voltage is applied
over the diode, the current contains, besides a component at the signal
frequency, harmonic components and a dc component that is proportional
to the signal power. Diode detectors are used for power measurement,
automatic level control, AM demodulation, and so on.
Let us consider a Schottky diode, where the series resistance Rs and
the junction capacitance Cj are assumed negligible. When a bias voltage VB

199
Circuits Based on Semiconductor Devices
and a small sinusoidal signal Vs cos vt are applied over the junction resistance
(see Figure 8.24), the diode current can be presented as a series:
I(VB + Vs cos vt) = IB + a2(Is + IB ) Vs
2
4 + a(Is + IB )Vs cos vt
(8.38)
+ a2(Is + IB ) Vs
2
4 cos 2vt + . . .
Further terms are negligible if aVs << 1 [see a in (8.2)] or at room temperature
Vs << 25 mV. IB is the direct current caused by the bias voltage, I(VB ).
The second term is the dc component proportional to the signal power; that
is, it is the useful component. According to (8.38), the junction can be
considered as a voltage source with a voltage
Vo = aVs

(8.39)
and with an internal resistance Rj . The diode is said to follow the square
law, because the useful signal is directly proportional to the RF power, that
is, to the square of the signal voltage (Vo ~ Vs
2). The voltage sensitivity is
the ratio of the detector output voltage Vo and the applied signal power Ps
in an impedance-matched case, as in
Figure 8.24 Current in a diode with an exponential I–V characteristic, when a dc bias
and a sinusoidal signal are applied to the diode.

If the parasitic elements Rs and Cj of the diode as well as the load

where VL is the voltage over the load. Rs and Cj reduce the voltage sensi-
tivity, which also decreases as the frequency or temperature are increased (a
is proportional to temperature).
Figure 8.25 shows how a diode detector is connected into a circuit.
In order to get all signal power absorbed into the diode, it must be matched
to the transmission line, usually to 50V. Without a bias voltage, the junction
resistance Rj may be very high and difficult to match. Furthermore, (8.41)
shows that in order to maximize the voltage sensitivity, it should be
RL >> Rj . Therefore, such a diode needs a small bias current in order to
provide a proper Rj . Matching the diode over a wide frequency band is
difficult. However, in practice we want a flat frequency response and, there-
fore, we must satisfy on lower voltage sensitivity than that given by (8.41).
A lowpass filter is used in the output to prevent the RF and harmonic
components from coupling to the load. A coil and a capacitor are needed
to guarantee that both dc and RF currents can flow through the diode.
Figure 8.26 shows a typical power response of a diode detector. When
the power level increases to a level over −20 dBm (dBm = decibels over

1 mW), the response no longer follows the square law. Finally, the output
voltage will saturate. On the other hand, at very low power levels noise is
the limiting factor.
8.7 Monolithic Microwave Circuits
Circuits consisting of microstrip lines, lumped passive elements (resistors,
inductors, and capacitors), and semiconductor diodes and transistors may
be integrated (connected without connectors) and be made very small. If
components are soldered or bonded on a microstrip circuit, we call it a
hybrid circuit. If a circuit is integrated directly on the surface of a semiconduc-
tor substrate, it is called a monolithic integrated circuit.
Up to about 2 GHz the monolithic circuits are made on Si; at higher
frequencies the substrate is usually GaAs and these circuits are called mono-
lithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). The advantages of the MMICs
are their extremely small size, suitability to mass production, good repeatabil-
ity, and high reliability. For example, a whole microwave amplifier can easily
be fabricated on a GaAs chip with an area of 1 mm2 and a thickness of 100
mm. Design and fabrication of a single MMIC becomes very expensive, but
in mass production its price becomes reasonable. Microwave applications

202
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
gaining from mass production of integrated circuits include mobile phones,
satellite TV receivers, GPS receivers, and WLAN terminals.
From diodes the Schottky diode and from transistors both MESFET
and HEMT are easily suited to GaAs-MMICs. The transmission lines are
either microstrip lines or coplanar waveguides. Resistors are either ion-planted
directly in GaAs or are thin metal films in the transmission lines. Inductors
(coils) may be narrow microstrip lines in the form of a loop or a spiral;
capacitors have either an interdigital or metal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure
(see Figure 4.7). Grounding is realized by a metallized via in the substrate.
Figure 8.27 presents a GaAs-MMIC with typical elements. Digital microwave
circuits have been made using MMIC technology up to tens of gigahertz,
analog circuits up to 200 GHz. Integrated optoelectronic circuits are made
using similar technology. In designing MMICs, commercially available soft-
ware packages are used for both electrical and layout design.

Antennas
Antennas transmit and receive radio waves. They operate as matching devices
from a transmission line to the free space and vice versa. An ideal antenna
radiates all the power incident from the transmission line feeding the antenna.
It radiates to (or receives from) desired directions; in other words, an antenna
has a certain radiation pattern.
Antennas are needed in nearly all applications of radio engineering.
The congestion of the radio spectrum due to the increasing number of users
and applications sets increasingly strict requirements for antennas. A large
number of antenna structures have been developed for different frequencies
and applications. Antennas can be categorized, for example, into current
element antennas, traveling-wave antennas, aperture antennas, and antenna
arrays.
In this chapter, the fundamental concepts of antennas, the calculation
of radiation pattern and other antenna quantities, different types of antennas,
and the link between two antennas are treated. Antennas are the subject of
many books [1–8].
9.1 Fundamental Concepts of Antennas
Antennas are reciprocal devices. That means that the properties of an antenna
are similar both in the transmitting mode and in the receiving mode. For
example, if a transmitting antenna radiates to certain directions, it can also
receive from those directions—the same radiation pattern applies for both
205

206
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
cases. The reciprocity does not apply if nonreciprocal components such as
ferrite devices or amplifiers are integrated into the antenna. Also, a link
between two antennas is reciprocal: The total loss is the same in both
directions. However, magnetized plasma, such as in the ionosphere, between
the antennas may cause Faraday rotation, making the link nonreciprocal.
The space surrounding an antenna can be divided into three regions
according to the properties of the radiated field. Because the field changes
smoothly, the boundaries between the regions are more or less arbitrary.
The reactive near-field region is closest to the antenna. In this region, the
reactive field component is larger than the radiating one. For a short current
element, the reactive and radiating components are equal at a distance of
l/(2p) from the element. For other current distributions this distance is
shorter. As the distance increases, the reactive field decreases as 1/r2 or 1/r3
and becomes negligible compared to the radiating field. In the radiating
near-field region or Fresnel region, the shape of the normalized radiation
pattern depends on the distance. As the distance of the observation point
changes, the difference in distances to different parts of the antenna changes
essentially compared to the wavelength. In the far-field region or Fraunhofer
region, the normalized radiation pattern is practically independent of the
distance and the field decreases as 1/r. The boundary between the near-field
and far-field regions is usually chosen to be at the distance of
r = 2D2
l
(9.1)
where D is the largest dimension of the antenna perpendicular to the direction
of observation. At the boundary, the edges of a planar antenna are l/16
farther away from the observation point P than the center of the antenna,
as illustrated in Figure 9.1. This difference in distance corresponds to a phase
Figure 9.1 At the boundary of near-field and far-field regions.

207
Antennas
difference of 22.5°. Because antennas are usually operated at large distances,
the far-field pattern is of interest. It should be noted that at lower frequencies
in case of small antennas, the outer limit of the reactive near-field region,
l/(2p), is larger than the distance obtained from (9.1).
The coordinate system used for antenna analysis or measurements
should be defined clearly. In analysis, the complexity of equations depends
on the system. Figure 9.2 shows the spherical coordinate system that is often
used. The elevation angle u increases along a great circle from 0° to 180°.
The azimuth angle f is obtained from the projection of the directional
vector in the xy-plane, and it is between 0° and 360°.
An antenna can be described by several properties, which are related
to the field radiated by the antenna, for example, directional pattern, gain,
and polarization. Due to the reciprocity, these properties also describe the
ability of the antenna to receive waves coming from different directions
and having different polarizations. The importance of different radiation
properties depends on the application. As a circuit element an antenna also
has an impedance, efficiency, and bandwidth. Often mechanical properties
such as the size, weight, and wind load are also very important.
Figure 9.2 Spherical coordinate system used for antenna analysis and measurements.

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
An isotropic antenna that radiates at an equal strength to all directions
is a good reference antenna but is not realizable in practice. A real antenna
has a certain radiation pattern, which describes the field distribution as the
antenna radiates. Often the radiation pattern means the same as the directional
pattern. The directional pattern describes the power density P(u, f) in watts
per square meter or the electric field intensity E(u, f) in volts per meter
as a function of direction. Usually, the directional pattern is normalized
so that the maximum value of the power density or electric field is 1 (or
0 dB). The normalized field En (u, f) is equal to the square root of the
normalized power density Pn (u, f).
Often the antenna radiates mainly to one direction only. Then one
main beam or the main lobe and possibly a number of lower maxima,
sidelobes, can be distinguished, as in Figure 9.3(a). The directions of the
lobes and nulls, the width of the main lobe, the levels of the sidelobes, and
Figure 9.3 Different representations of the directional pattern: (a) rectangular; (b) polar;
(c) three-dimensional; and (d) constant-value contours.

209
Antennas
the depths of nulls can be obtained from the directional pattern. The half-
power beamwidth, u3dB or f3dB, is often used as the measure of the main
lobe width.
Figure 9.3 shows different representations of directional patterns. The
rectangular representation is suitable for directive antennas having a narrow
main beam. The polar representation is natural for an antenna radiating
over a wide range of angles. Both rectangular and polar plots are two-
dimensional cuts of the three-dimensional pattern. The directional patterns
are often u-cuts or f-cuts. For a u-cut, for example, the angle u is constant
and the angle f is variable. The most important cuts are the cuts in the
principal planes. The principal planes are orthogonal planes that intersect
at the maximum of the main lobe, that is, at the boresight. For example,
for a linearly polarized antenna, the principal planes are the E-plane and
H-plane, which are the planes parallel to the electric field vector and magnetic
field vector, respectively. The whole pattern can be represented as a three-
dimensional or contour plot. The scale of different plots may be a linear
power, a linear field, or a logarithmic (decibel) scale.
The number of different shapes of directional patterns is countless. A
pencil beam antenna has a narrow and symmetrical main lobe. Such highly
directional antennas are used, for example, in point-to-point radio links,
satellite communication, and radio astronomy. The directional pattern of a
terrestrial broadcasting antenna should be constant in the azimuth plane and
shaped in the vertical plane to give a field strength that is constant over the
service area. The directional pattern of an antenna in a satellite should follow
the shape of the geographic service area.
The directivity D of an antenna is obtained by integrating the normalized
power pattern Pn (u, f) over the whole solid angle 4p:
D =
4p
EE
4p
Pn (u, f) d V
(9.2)
where d V is an element of the solid angle. Because Pn (u, f) = P(u, f)/
Pmax , the directivity is the maximum power density divided by the average
power density.
Example 9.1
The beam of an antenna is rotationally symmetric. Within the 1°-wide
beam, the pattern level is Pn = 1, and outside the beam the pattern level is

210
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Pn = 0. (In practice, this kind of a beam is not realizable.) What is the
directivity of this antenna?
Solution
Because the beamwidth is small, the section of the sphere corresponding to
the beam can be approximated with a circular, planar surface. The beamwidth
is 1° = p/180 = 0.01745 radians. The solid angle of the beam is VA =
ee4p Pn (u, f) d V = p × 0.017452/4 = 2.392 × 10−4 steradians (square
radians). The directivity is D = 4p/VA = 52,500, which in decibels is
10 log (52,500) = 47.2 dB.
The gain G of an antenna is the ratio of the maximum radiation
intensity produced by the antenna to the radiation intensity that would be
obtained if the power accepted by the antenna were radiated equally in all
directions. For an antenna having no loss, the gain is equal to the directivity.
In practical antennas there are some conductor and dielectric losses. All the
power coupled to the antenna is not radiated and the gain is smaller than
the directivity:
G = hr D
(9.3)
where hr is the radiation efficiency. If the power coupled to the antenna
is P, the power radiated is hr P, and the power lost in the antenna is
(1 −hr )P. Losses due to impedance and polarization mismatches are not
taken into account in the definition of gain. The directivity and gain can
also be given as functions of direction: D(u, f) = Pn (u, f) ? D, G(u, f)
= Pn (u, f) ? G.
The effective area Aef is a useful quantity for a receiving antenna. An
ideal antenna with an area of Aef receives from a plane wave, having a power
density of S, the same power, Aef S, as the real antenna. As shown in Section
9.6, the effective area is directly related to the gain as
Aef (u, f) = l2
4p G(u, f)
(9.4)
Thus, the effective area of an isotropic antenna is l2/(4p). For an antenna
having a radiating aperture, the aperture efficiency is defined as

211
Antennas
hap =
Aef
Aphys
(9.5)
where Aphys is the physical area of the aperture.
The phase pattern c(u, f) is the phase difference of the constant phase
front radiated by the antenna and the spherical phase front of an ideal
antenna. The position of the reference point where the spherical wave is
assumed to emanate must be given. The phase center of an antenna is the
reference point that minimizes the phase difference over the main beam.
For example, the phase center of the feed antenna and the focal point of
the reflector that is illuminated by the feed should coincide.
The polarization of an antenna describes how the orientation of the
electric field radiated by the antenna behaves as a function of time. We can
imagine that the tip of the electric field vector makes an ellipse during one
cycle on a plane that is perpendicular to the direction of propagation (Figure
9.4). The polarization ellipse is defined by its axial ratio Emax /Emin , its tilt
angle t, and its sense of rotation. The special cases of the elliptical polarization
are the linear polarization and the circular polarization. The polarization of
an antenna is also a function of angle (u, f).
The field radiated by the antenna can be divided into two orthogonal
components: the copolar and cross-polar field. Often the copolar component
is used for the intended operation and the cross-polar component represents
an unwanted radiation or an interference. Linear polarizations that are per-
pendicular to each other, as for example the vertical and horizontal polariza-
tions, are orthogonal. The right-handed and left-handed circular polarization
are orthogonal to each other as well.
Figure 9.4 Polarization ellipse.

212
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Generally, the polarization of an incoming wave and the polarization
of the antenna are different, which causes a polarization mismatch. If the
polarizations are the same, there will be no mismatch and the polarization
efficiency is hp = 1. In the case of orthogonal polarizations, no energy couples
to the antenna and hp = 0. If the wave is circularly polarized and the antenna
is linearly polarized, one-half of the power incident on the effective area
couples to the antenna, that is, hp = 1⁄2.
The quantities Pn (u, f), En (u, f), D(u, f), G(u, f), Aef (u, f),
and c(u, f) can be given for both copolar and cross-polar fields. An ideal
antenna has no cross polarization. The cross-polar field of a practical antenna
depends on the angle (u, f) and is often at minimum in the direction of
the main beam. An antenna should have a low level of cross-polarization,
for example in such applications where two channels are transmitted at the
same frequency using two orthogonal polarizations.
All the power couples from the transmission line to the antenna and
vice versa, if the impedance Z of the antenna is equal to the characteristic
impedance of the transmission line (note that the characteristic impedance
of a transmission line is real). A part of the power reflects back from an
impedance mismatch. The impedance Z = R + jX has a resistive part and
a reactive part. The resistive part, R = Rr + Rl , is divided into the radiation
resistance Rr and the loss resistance Rl . The power ‘‘absorbed’’ in the radiation
resistance is radiated and the power absorbed in the loss resistance is trans-
formed into heat in the antenna. The impedance of an antenna depends on
its surroundings. The reflections coming from nearby objects, such as the
head of a mobile phone user, alter the impedance. Due to the mutual
couplings of elements in an antenna array, the impedance of an element
embedded in the array differs from that of the element alone in free space.
The bandwidth of an antenna can be defined to be the frequency
band in which the impedance match, gain, beamwidth, sidelobe level, cross-
polarization level, or some other quantity is within the accepted limits.
The parameters of an antenna may also be adjustable. In case of an
adaptive antenna, its impedance, radiation pattern, or some other characteris-
tic can adapt according to the electromagnetic environment.
9.2 Calculation of Radiation from Antennas
The fields radiated by an antenna can be calculated using auxiliary quantities
called the magnetic vector potential A and the electric vector potential F.

In principle, the radiated fields can be calculated for all antennas using these
equations. They are well suited for wire antennas that have a known current
distribution.
An aperture antenna, such as a horn antenna, has an aperture or a
surface from which the radiation seems to emanate. It may be difficult to
find out the current distribution. Then it may be easier to calculate the
radiated fields from the aperture fields Ea and Ha. The aperture fields are
replaced with surface currents that would produce the aperture fields. The
magnetic field is replaced with a surface current having a density of
Js = n × Ha
(9.10)
where n is a unit vector normal to the surface of the aperture. The vector
potential A corresponding to Js is then calculated. The radiated field compo-
nents are obtained from (9.8) and (9.9). The electric field of the aperture
is replaced with a magnetic surface current having a density of

Because of the capacitive loadings, currents could flow even at the ends of
the dipole making a nearly constant current distribution possible. As explained
in Chapter 2, a fluctuating current produces electromagnetic waves: The
current produces a changing magnetic field, the changing magnetic field
produces a changing electric field, the changing electric field produces a
changing magnetic field, and so on.

where h is the wave impedance in free space.

Other components are negligible. The electric and magnetic fields are in

wave.
The power radiated by the current element is calculated by integrating
the Poynting vector S = (1/2) Re (E × H*) over a sphere surrounding the
element. If the radius of the sphere, r, is much larger than dz, S is perpendicu-
lar to the surface of the sphere and the outflowing power per unit area is

9.4 Dipole and Monopole Antennas
Wire antennas are popular at frequencies below 1 GHz. The dipole antenna
is the most often used wire antenna. It is a straight wire, which is usually
split in the middle so that it can be fed by a transmission line.
It can be thought that a dipole shown in Figure 9.7 consists of current
elements in a line. The far field is calculated by summing the fields produced
by the current elements, that is, by integrating (9.20):
Eu = jvm
4p E
l /2
−l /2
I(z)e −jkR(z)
R(z)
sin u(z) dz
(9.24)
where l is the length of the dipole. It can be assumed that the current
distribution I(z) is sinusoidal and at the ends of the wire the current is zero.
This assumption applies well for a thin wire. The current distribution can
be considered to be a standing wave pattern, which is produced as the current
wave reflects from the end of the wire. The current distribution is
I(z) =H
I0 sin [k(l /2 −z)],
for z > 0
I0 sin [k(l /2 + z)],
for z < 0
(9.25)
where I0 is the maximum current. Far away from the antenna at a point
P(r, u, f) it applies u(z) ≈u and 1/R(z) ≈1/r, so these terms can be

assumed to be constant in (9.24). However, small changes in R(z) as a
function of z have to be taken into account in the phase term e −jkR(z). The
distance from P to the element is
R(z) = √r2 + z2 −2rz cos u ≈r −z cos u
(9.26)
From (9.24), the field radiated by the dipole is

If the dipole is short compared to a wavelength, the current distribution
is approximately triangular. Its radiation resistance is a quarter of that of
the Hertz dipole having the same length:
Rr ≈20p2S
l
lD

V
(9.28)
This is valid up to about a length of l = l/4.
The half-wave dipole is the most important of dipole antennas. When
l = l/2, it follows from (9.27) that
Eu = jhI0
2pr e −jkr
cosS

2 cos uD

(9.29)
The maximum of the field is in the plane perpendicular to the wire and
the nulls are along the direction of the wire. The half-power beamwidth is
u3dB = 78°. The directivity is D = 1.64 (2.15 dB), which is also the gain
G for a lossless half-wave dipole. The directional patterns of the half-wave
dipole and the Hertz dipole (u3dB = 90°, D = 1.5) are compared in Figure
9.8. The radiation resistance of the half-wave dipole is Rr = 73.1V in a
lossless case. The input impedance also includes some inductive reactance.
The impedance could be made purely resistive by reducing the length of
the wire by a few percent; this will reduce the radiation resistance too. In
practice, the properties of the half-wave dipole also depend on the thickness
of the wire.

219
Antennas
Figure 9.8 Normalized directional patterns of the half-wave and Hertz dipole.
Figure 9.9 shows a folded dipole. Both of the half-wave-long wires
have a similar current distribution. Therefore, the folded dipole produces a
field twice of that of the half-wave dipole for a given feed current. Thus,
the radiated power is four times that of the half-wave dipole and the radiation
resistance is about 300V. A parallel-wire line having a characteristic imped-
ance of 300V is suitable for feeding a folded dipole antenna.
If a dipole antenna has a length of a few half-wavelengths, its directional
pattern has several lobes. Figure 9.10 shows the current distribution and
directional pattern of a 3l/2-long dipole. As the length l further increases,
Figure 9.9 Folded dipole antenna.
Figure 9.10 A 3l/2-long dipole antenna: current distribution and directional pattern.

220
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
the number of lobes increases. The envelope of the lobes forms a cylinder
around the z-axis. The feed point of a dipole antenna is usually in the middle
but can be at some other point. The directional pattern and impedance
depend on the position of the feed point.
Example 9.2
Let us consider two dipole antennas having lengths of 0.1l and 0.5l. Both
have a feed current of 1A. What are the radiated powers?
Solution
From (9.28), the radiation resistance is Rr = 1.97V as l = 0.1l. The radiated
power P = 1⁄2Rr I 2 = 1.0W. For the half-wave dipole, Rr = 73.1V and
P = 36.5W. Thus, a short dipole is ineffective and its small resistance is
difficult to match to a transmission line.
The monopole antenna is a straight wire above a ground plane as
shown in Figure 9.11(a). In the analysis, the image principle can be applied.
The conducting plane can be removed if an image of the current distribution
is placed on the other side of the plane, as in Figure 9.11(b). This way the
tangential electric field vanishes at the plane where the conducting plane
was.
The monopole antenna and the dipole antenna formed according to
the image principle have similar fields in the half-space above the ground
plane. For a given feed current, the power radiated by the monopole is half
of that of the corresponding dipole because the monopole produces no fields
below the ground plane. Therefore, the radiation resistance of a quarter-
wave monopole is 36.5V, which is half of that of a half-wave dipole. The
gain of the monopole is twice of that of the dipole.
In practice, the ground plane of a monopole antenna is finite and has
a finite conductivity. Therefore, the main lobe is tilted upward and there

Antennas
may be a null along the direction of the surface. At low frequencies, a flat
ground acts as a ground plane. The conductivity may be improved by
introducing metal wires into the ground.
Monopole antennas operating at VLF and LF ranges are short compared
to a wavelength and have a low radiation resistance. Their efficiency can be
improved by adding a horizontal wire at the top, as shown in Figure 9.12.
Due to the top loading, the current in the vertical part is increased. The
fields produced by the vertical part and its image add constructively. However,
the fields from the horizontal part and its image cancel each other, because
their currents flow to opposite directions and their distance is small compared
to a wavelength.
Dipole and monopole antennas are omnidirectional in the plane per-
pendicular to the wire and thus have a low directivity. Figure 9.13 shows a
Yagi (or Yagi-Uda) antenna, which is an antenna commonly used for TV
reception. It consists of an array of parallel dipoles, which together form a
directional antenna. Only one element, the driven element, is fed from the
transmission line. There is a reflector behind the driven element and directors
in front of it. Currents are induced to these parasitic elements. The fields

Figure 9.13 Yagi antenna.

222
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
produced by the driven and parasitic elements add in phase in the forward
direction and cancel in the reverse direction.
The driven element of a Yagi antenna is in a resonance, that is, the
input impedance is resistive, when the length of the element is 0.45 to 0.48
wavelength. The driven element is often a folded dipole. The reflector is
0.15 to 0.30 wavelength behind the driven element and it is about 5%
longer than the driven element. The directors are about 5% shorter than
the driven element and their spacings are 0.15 to 0.30 wavelength. Often
the directors have equal lengths and equal spacings, although the optimization
of dimensions would give a slightly higher directivity. A larger number of
director elements means a higher directivity. Usually there are three to twelve
directors. The directivity of a seven-element Yagi is typically 12 dB. The
narrow bandwidth is a drawback of the Yagi antenna. In a cold climate snow
and ice covering the elements may easily spoil the directional pattern.
A log-periodic antenna is a broadband antenna whose properties repeat
at frequencies having a constant ratio of t. The structure is periodic so that
if all the dimensions are multiplied or divided by t, the original structure,
excluding the outermost elements, is obtained. Figure 9.14 shows a log-
periodic dipole antenna. The antenna is fed from the high-frequency end,
and the feed line goes through all elements, so that the phase is reversed
from an element to the next one. Only the element being in resonance
radiates effectively. The element behind it acts as a reflector and the element
in front of it acts as a director. Thus, the active part of the antenna depends
on the frequency. The directivity is typically 8 dB.
9.5 Other Wire Antennas
A loop antenna is a circular or rectangular wire, which may consist of several
turns. If the loop is small compared to a wavelength, the current is nearly

constant along the loop. The maximum of the directional pattern is in the
plane of the loop and the nulls are perpendicular to that plane as in Figure
9.15(a). The pattern is like the pattern of a small dipole having the electric
and magnetic fields interchanged. Therefore, a small loop can be considered
to be a magnetic dipole. The radiation resistance is
Rr = 320p4S
NA
l2D

V
(9.30)
where A is the area of the loop and N is the number of turns.
The current of a larger loop is not constant. Then the directional
pattern differs from that of a small loop. If the length of the circumference
is one wavelength, the maximum of the directional pattern is perpendicular
to the plane of the loop and the null is in the plane of the loop. Figure
9.15(b) shows a quad antenna, which is made of such loops. Like the Yagi
antenna, the quad antenna has a driven element, a reflector, and one or
more directors. Quad antennas operating at different frequency ranges can
be placed inside each other because the coupling of such loops is small.
A helix antenna, shown in Figure 9.16, is a helical wire having either
the left-handed or right-handed sense. If the length of the circumference L
is less than l/2, the helix antenna radiates in the normal mode; that is, the
maximum of the directional pattern is perpendicular to the axis of the helix.
This kind of a helix antenna operates as a shortened monopole, except the
field is elliptically polarized. If L is from 0.75l to 1.25l, the helix antenna
operates in the axial mode; that is, the main beam is along the axis of the
helix and the field is circularly polarized.
Long-wire and rhombic antennas are traveling-wave antennas, which
are used at HF range. The current has constant amplitude but the phase
changes linearly along the wire (in a dipole antenna, the amplitude of the
current changes but the phase is constant).

Figure 9.16 Helix antenna fed from a coaxial cable through a conducting plane.
The long-wire antenna is usually a horizontal wire, which is terminated
with a matched load, as shown in Figure 9.17. The conical directional pattern
is
En (a) =
sin a
1 −cos a sin [pL(1 −cos a)/l]
(9.31)
where a is the angle from the direction of the wire and L is the length of
the wire. The longer the wire, the smaller the angle am is between the
directions of the main lobe and the wire. For an antenna having a length
of several wavelengths, the main lobe direction is am ≈√l/L. A V-antenna
is made of two long-wire antennas placed in an angle of 2am to each other.
It has a better directional pattern than a single long-wire antenna because
the main lobes of the two wires reinforce each other.
A rhombic antenna is made of four horizontal long-wire antennas (or
two V-antennas), as shown in Figure 9.18. It is fed from a parallel-wire line
and is terminated with a matched load. The fields produced by the long-

wire antennas are all in phase in the forward direction. In practice, the main
lobe tilts slightly upward, due to the ground.
9.6 Radiation from Apertures
Figure 9.19 shows a surface element d S at the origin in the xy-plane. The
electric field Ex and magnetic field Hy = Ex /h are constant over the element.

These vector potentials are then expressed in the spherical coordinate
system. For example, the components of the magnetic vector potential are
Ar = sin u cos fAx , Au = cos u cos fAx , and Af = −sin fAx . As the curl
of the vector potential is expressed in the spherical coordinate system, it can
be noted, that far away from the element the radial component is negligible.
Then the curl simplifies to

Figure 9.20 shows a rectangular radiating aperture, which is in the
xy-plane and whose center is at the origin. The width of the aperture is a
in the x-direction and b in the y-direction. The electric field Ex has a constant
amplitude and phase over the whole aperture. The magnetic field is Hy =
Ex /h. Thus, the aperture is like a part of a plane wave.
Far away from the aperture the field is obtained by integrating the
field of the surface element, (9.35) and (9.36), over the aperture. Because
the aperture field is constant, the integration simplifies to an integration of
the phase term e −jkR, where the distance from the surface element to the
point of observation P varies. Far from the aperture
R ≈r −r′ cos w
(9.38)
where r′ is the distance of the surface element from the origin and w is the
angle between the vectors r and r′. The variable term r′ cos w can be written
as

In the E- or xz-plane (f = 0°), the electric field has only the
Eu -component, and in the H- or yz-plane (f = 90°), only the
Ef -component.
If the aperture is large (a and b >> l), the field is significant at small
u angles only. Then cos u ≈1 and sin u ≈u, and the normalized directional

Assuming a lossless aperture (D = G ) and comparing (9.48) to (9.4), we
can see that the physical and effective areas are equal, that is, ab = Aeff .
The radiation pattern of an aperture antenna having an arbitrary shape,
amplitude distribution, and phase distribution is calculated using the same
principle as above: The fields produced by the surface elements are summed
at the point of observation.
If a rectangular aperture has a field distribution of a form f (x)g( y),
the normalized patterns in the xz- and yz-planes are those of the line sources

230

(one-dimensional apertures) having aperture distributions of f (x) and g( y),
respectively. The normalized pattern is the product of the normalized patterns
in the xz- and yz-planes.
Table 9.1 shows properties of line sources having different amplitude
distributions. The constant amplitude distribution gives the narrowest beam
but the highest level of sidelobes. If the amplitude of the field decreases
toward the edge of the aperture, the beamwidth increases, the gain decreases,
and the sidelobe level decreases.
Earlier it was assumed that the phase of the aperture was constant. In
practice, a quadratic phase distribution is usual. Then constant phase fronts
are nearly spherical in the aperture. Figure 9.22 shows directional patterns
for line sources having a constant amplitude but quadratic phase distribution.
As the parameter D (phase difference between the center and edge in wave-
lengths) increases, gain decreases, sidelobes increase, and nulls get filled.
The properties of circular apertures are listed in Table 9.2 for different
amplitude distributions (the phase is constant). If the aperture has a constant
amplitude, the normalized directional pattern is

9.7 Horn Antennas
An open waveguide end operates as a simple antenna. It has a broad, unsym-
metrical beam and a rather large impedance mismatch. A much better
antenna, a horn antenna, is obtained by widening the waveguide end, as
shown in Figure 9.23.
H-plane, E-plane, and pyramidal horns are fed from a rectangular
waveguide. An H-plane horn is widened along the broad side of the wave-
guide, an E-plane horn along the narrow side. A pyramidal horn is broadened
in both directions. The distribution of the aperture field follows the field
distribution of the fundamental waveguide mode, TE10. Because the ampli-
tude in the E-plane is constant, the sidelobes are higher in this plane than
in the H-plane, which has a cosine amplitude distribution tapering to zero
at the edges. However, the phase in the aperture is not constant; rather it
is quadratic. The H- and E-plane horns have cylindrical phase fronts, which
seem to emanate from the apex. The apex is in the intersection of the slanting
side planes. The phase difference between the center and edge of the aperture
is in wavelengths
D = (1 −cos u0) L
l
(9.50)

where u0 is half of the opening angle and L is the distance from the apex
to the aperture.
Figure 9.24 gives the directivities DE and DH for E- and H-plane
horns. Because of the aperture phase error D, it is impractical to make a
horn, which has a very high directivity. For a fixed length L, the directivity
increases as the aperture size increases until it collapses due to the phase
error. The directivity of a pyramidal horn is obtained from the directivities
of the corresponding E- and H-plane horns:
D ≈pDE DH l2
32ab
(9.51)
where a is the width and b is the height of the input waveguide. Usually,
the losses of horn antennas are small, and the gain and directivity are
approximately equal.
A conical horn like that shown in Figure 9.23(d) is obtained by widening
a circular waveguide. Although the structure is symmetrical, the fields of the
fundamental mode TE11 are not. Therefore, the E- and H-plane directional
patterns are different.
Figure 9.25 shows horn antennas, which produce more symmetrical
beams than pyramidal and conical horns. The rectangular waveguide feeding
the diagonal horn, shown in Figure 9.25(a), transforms first to a circular
waveguide and then to a square waveguide, which is at a 45° angle to the
feeding waveguide. The field of the aperture is a combination of the fields
of TE10 and TE01 modes. The beam of a diagonal horn is fairly symmetrical,

E-plane = b1, aperture size in H-plane = a1.

but the level of cross polarization is high in the 45° and 135° planes between
the E- and H-planes.
A Potter horn or a dual-mode horn, shown in Figure 9.25(b), is a
conical horn, which has a step in the feeding circular waveguide. The funda-
mental mode TE11 and the TM11 mode excited at the step together produce
an aperture field having parallel field lines, if the modes have proper ampli-
tudes and a proper phase difference in the aperture. The Potter horn has a
symmetrical pattern, low sidelobe level, and low cross-polarization level.
However, it has a narrow bandwidth because the phasing of modes depends
on the frequency.
A corrugated horn, shown in Figure 9.25(c), is a conical horn having
a corrugated inner wall. The number of grooves should be at least two per
wavelength. The depth of grooves is about l/4. Near the throat the depth
changes gradually to l/2 to ensure a good impedance match between the
input waveguide and the flaring section. The mode propagating in the horn
is HE11, a hybrid of TE11 and TM11 modes. A corrugated horn has many
good properties: a symmetrical pattern, low sidelobe level, low cross-polariza-
tion level, and broad operating bandwidth.
9.8 Reflector Antennas
Reflector antennas are used as high-gain, narrow-beam antennas in fixed
radio links, satellite communication, radars, and radio astronomy.

235
Antennas
A parabolic reflector antenna is the most common of reflector antennas.
Figure 9.26(a) shows a parabolic antenna fed from the primary focus. The
equation of the surface is
r =
2F
1 + cos u
(9.52)
where F is the focal length. The rays coming from the focal point are
converted parallel by the reflector or vice versa. A more physical interpretation
is that the fields radiated by the feed antenna induce surface currents, which
in turn produce the aperture fields. The feed antenna is often a horn antenna.
The phase center of the feed antenna should coincide with the focal point
to obtain maximum gain.
The Cassegrainian antenna shown in Figure 9.26(b) is fed from the
secondary focus behind the reflector. The subreflector is a hyperbolic reflector.
This configuration has several advantages compared to the primary focus-
fed antenna: Transmitters and receivers can be placed behind the reflector;
transmission lines between the feed and the radio equipment are short;
positioning of the feed antenna is less critical; the phase and amplitude
distribution of the aperture field can be adjusted with a shaped subreflector;
and the feed pattern over the edge of the subreflector is directed toward a cold
sky in satellite reception, which leads to a lower antenna noise temperature. A
more complicated structure and often a larger blockage of the aperture are
the disadvantages of the Cassegrainian antenna.
Figure 9.26 Parabolic reflector antennas: (a) a primary focus fed antenna; and (b) a
Cassegrainian antenna.

236
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The theoretical directional patterns of circular apertures are only rough
approximations of real patterns. Aperture field distribution depends on the
radiation pattern of the feed antenna and on the ratio of the focal length
and diameter of the reflector, F/D. A constant aperture field gives the highest
gain but also the highest sidelobe level. A high edge illumination leads also
to a high feed radiation over the edge of the reflector. Tapering the aperture
illumination toward the edge leads to a lower aperture efficiency and gain
but improves the pattern by lowering the sidelobes. Typically, the field at
the edge is 10 dB to 12 dB lower than that at the center, and the aperture
efficiency is about 0.6.
Many factors have an effect on the pattern of a reflector antenna:
amplitude and phase pattern of the feed; positioning of the feed; aperture
blockage due to the struts, feed, and subreflector; multiple reflections between
the feed and reflector; and errors in the shape of the reflector and subreflector.
Small random errors in the surface of the reflector reduce the gain and move
energy from the main beam to the sidelobes. If the rms value of the surface
errors is e, the aperture efficiency is
hap = h0 exp [−(4pe/l)2]
(9.53)
where h0 is the aperture efficiency for an ideal surface. The surface error e
should not exceed l/16.
The struts and the feed or the subreflector block a part of the aperture,
which reduces hap and changes the level of sidelobes. They also scatter and
diffract energy over a large solid angle. Also the edge of the reflector diffracts,
which often produces a back lobe opposite to the main lobe.
The aperture blockage can be avoided by using offset geometry. Figure
9.27 shows offset-fed reflector antennas. The single-offset antenna has a
simpler structure but the offset geometry inherently produces cross polariza-
tion. The dual-offset antenna has two distinct advantages compared to the
single-offset antenna: The cross-polar field can be compensated and the
aperture field distribution can be adjusted by shaping the reflectors. Dual-
offset reflectors may have excellent sidelobe properties.
9.9 Other Antennas
In addition to the antennas discussed already, there are a large number of
other antenna types. Some of them are briefly described here.

Microstrip antennas are small, light, and suitable for integration and
mass-production [6, 7]. Figure 9.28(a) shows the basic microstrip antenna:
a rectangular, half-wave-long patch. It is made on a substrate having a ground
plane on the other side. The patch is fed with a microstrip line from the
edge and it radiates from both open-ended edges. The linearly polarized
main beam is perpendicular to the surface. Because the antenna radiates
effectively only at the resonance frequency, it has a narrow bandwidth. Fairly
high loss is another disadvantage of microstrip antennas.
Figure 9.28 (a) Microstrip antenna; (b) slot antenna; (c) bow-tie antenna; (d) dielectric
rod antenna; and (e) lens antenna.

238
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
There are many variations on the basic microstrip antenna: different
shapes of the patch, ways to feed the patch, and possibilities to combine
elements to an array. A circularly polarized wave can be produced with a
square patch, which is fed from the adjacent sides so that the phase difference
of the feeds is 90°. A patch can also be fed with a coaxial cable through the
substrate, in which case the input impedance depends on the position of
the feed point. Feeding through a slot in the ground plane allows the radiating
patches to be separated from the feed lines and other circuits. The directivity
of a single element is low. A higher directivity is obtained by combining a
large number of elements (see Section 9.10).
A slot antenna is a radiating slot in a metal plane, as shown in Figure
9.28(b). It is dual with a dipole antenna; that is, the radiation pattern is
that of a dipole except that the electric and magnetic fields are interchanged.
A slot antenna can be fed from a parallel-wire line, coaxial line, microstrip
line, or waveguide. A waveguide having an array of slots is a common
antenna. A slot in a waveguide wall radiates if it disturbs surface currents;
a narrow slot, which is along the current flow, does not radiate.
The bow-tie antenna shown in Figure 9.28(c) is an example of a
broadband antenna. The feed point is in the center of two planar conductors.
The input impedance and directional pattern may be frequency-independent
over a frequency range of one decade or more. In an ideal case, the bow-
tie antenna has no dimensions, which can be expressed in wavelengths; the
opening angle of the conductors is the only dimension. In practice, the
structure of the feed point and the finite length of the conductors set limits
for the frequency range. Often bow-tie antennas are placed on a dielectric
substrate. Then the main lobe is on the dielectric side. Other frequency-
independent shapes used in broadband antennas are spirals and cones.
Antennas made of dielectric materials have some mechanical and electri-
cal advantages [8]. Figure 9.28(d) shows a dielectric rod antenna, which is
placed at the open end of a circular waveguide. This kind of an antenna
works well as a feed antenna.
Like a parabolic reflector, a lens antenna operates as a phase modifier,
which changes a spherical phase front to a planar one. The paths of the rays
from the focal point of the lens to a plane in front of the lens have equal
electrical lengths. Lenses are usually made of low-loss dielectric materials.
The phase velocity of the wave is c/√er in the dielectric material. Figure
9.28(e) shows a simple plano-convex lens. The reflections in the air-dielectric
interfaces can be eliminated with quarter-wave matching layers. Lenses are
often used to correct the phase error at the aperture of a horn antenna.

9.10 Antenna Arrays
An antenna array is an entity consisting of two or more element antennas.
Antenna arrays may have many good properties, which cannot be achieved
with a single element, such as high gain, narrow beam, shaped beam, scanning
beam, or adaptive beam.
Figure 9.29 shows an array that consists of two elements having a
separation of d. Let us assume that the far-field patterns of the antennas are
E1(f) and E2(f) and that the phase difference of the feed currents is d
(in this case the lengths of the feed lines are different). The total field
produced by the array is
E(f) = E1(f)e −j(kd cos f +d ) + E2(f)
(9.54)
The path length difference of d cos f in free space produces the phase
difference of kd cos f. The fields of the elements are in the same phase in
directions fmax that meet the condition of
kd cos fmax + d = n2p
(9.55)
where n is an integer. The fields have opposite phases in directions fmin
which meet the condition of
kd cos fmin + d = n2p + p
(9.56)
Figure 9.29 An array of two elements.

240
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
If the elements of Figure 9.29 are similar, E1(f) = E2(f), and they
are fed in phase, d = 0, (9.54) can be written as
E(f) = E1(f)(1 + e −jkd cos f )
(9.57)
The array pattern is the product of the element pattern and the array factor.
If the element pattern maximum and the array factor maximum coincide
in the same direction, the maximum field is twice that produced by a single
element, E = 2E1(fmax ). However, even if the power density is now four
times that produced by a single element, the gain of the array is only twice
the gain of an element. The power density produced by an element would
be doubled if all the input power of the array were fed to that element alone.
The normalized pattern may look like that shown in Figure 9.30. The
envelope follows the element pattern, and at minima the fields of the elements
cancel each other out. As the separation d increases, the number of maxima
and minima in the pattern increases.
Many kinds of directional patterns can be realized by changing the
distance (or frequency) and phase difference of the elements. Figure 9.31
shows some patterns when the elements radiate isotropically in the f-plane
(for example dipoles which are perpendicular to the f-plane).
Also, the pattern of an array consisting of more than two elements can
be expressed as the product of the element pattern and the array factor. The
array factor depends on the positions, amplitudes, and phases of the elements.
The array may be linear, planar, or conformal (shaped according to the
surface). The elements of a linear array are on a line. Figure 9.32 shows a
Figure 9.30 Pattern of a two-element array (solid line) equals the element pattern
multiplied by the array factor.

planar array, which consists of 16 microstrip antenna elements fed in phase
and with equal amplitudes. This array is like the rectangular aperture antenna
treated in Section 9.6. Many kinds of different patterns can be realized by
choosing proper amplitudes and phases for the elements. Besides microstrip
elements, an array may consist of many other types of elements such as
dipoles, slots, or horns [9].
If there are electronically controlled phase shifters in the feed network
of an array, the direction of the beam can be changed rapidly without rotating
the antenna. This kind of electronic scanning is much faster than mechanical
scanning. A phased array combined with digital signal processing may operate
as an adaptive antenna. The pattern of an adaptive antenna changes according
to the electromagnetic environment; for example, the beam of a base-station
antenna may follow a moving user and a null may be formed in the direction
of an interfering signal. An adaptive antenna may also partly correct the
deterioration of its pattern, if one or more of its elements breaks down.
Adaptive antennas are also called ‘‘smart’’ antennas.
9.11 Matching of Antennas
In principle, an antenna may be matched as any load impedance. However,
some wire antennas, such as dipole and loop antennas, need a special attention
if they are fed from an unsymmetrical line. For example, if a dipole antenna
is connected directly to a coaxial line, currents will flow on the outer surface
of the outer conductor. Then the outer conductor will radiate and the
directional pattern will be distorted.
The radiation of the outer conductor can be prevented with a balun,
a balanced-to-unbalanced transformer. The balun of Figure 9.33(a) has a
short-circuited quarter-wave line outside the outer conductor. Thus, the
impedance between A and B is large. Now, a symmetric load as a dipole
antenna can be connected between A and C so that the outer conductor
does not radiate. The balun of Figure 9.33(b) transforms the characteristic
impedance of the coaxial line, Z0, to an impedance of 4Z0 between A and
B. In the balun of Figure 9.33(c) the coaxial line changes gradually to a
parallel-wire line.
9.12 Link Between Two Antennas
Let us assume that a signal is transmitted from one antenna to another. The
antennas are in free space and their separation r is large compared to the

distances obtained from (9.1). The main beams of the antennas are pointing
toward each other and their polarizations are matched.
If the power accepted by the transmitting antenna, Pt , were transmitted
isotropically, the power density at a distance of r would be
Sisot =
Pt
4pr2
(9.58)
The maximum power density produced by the transmitting antenna
having a gain of Gt is
S = Gt Pt
4pr2
(9.59)
The corresponding electric field amplitude produced by the antenna is
E = √2hS
(9.60)

244
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The power available from the receiving antenna is its effective area Ar
times the power density of the incoming wave:
Pr = Ar S
(9.61)
Using (9.4) and (9.59), this can be written as the Friis free-space equation:
Pr = Gt GrS
l
4prD
2
Pt
(9.62)
where Gr is the gain of the receiving antenna.
In practice, many factors may reduce the power received, such as errors
in the pointing of the antennas, polarization mismatch, loss due to the
atmosphere, and fading due to multipath propagation. Losses due to imped-
ance mismatches also have to be taken into account; generally, the power
accepted by the transmitting antenna is smaller than the available power of
the transmitter, and the power accepted by the receiver is smaller than the
available power from the receiving antenna.
Example 9.3
What is the loss Pt /Pr at 12 GHz from a geostationary satellite at a distance
of 40,000 km? Both the transmitting and receiving antennas have a diameter
of D = 1m and an aperture efficiency of hap = 0.6.
Solution
The antennas have an effective area of Aeff = hap pD 2/4 = 0.47 m2 and a
gain of G = 4pAeff /l2 = 9 500. The loss Pt /Pr = (4pr/Gl)2 = 4.5 × 1012,
in decibels 10 log (4.5 × 1012) dB = 126.5 dB. Here, the attenuation of the
atmosphere is not taken into account. During a clear weather, the atmospheric
attenuation is about 0.3 dB at 12 GHz.
Example 9.4
How accurately the receiving antenna of the preceding example has to be
pointed to the satellite, if the allowed maximum pointing loss is 0.5 dB?
The satellite transmits two orthogonal, linearly polarized signals. How accu-
rately must the tilt angle of the linearly polarized receiving antenna be
adjusted if (a) the maximum loss due to polarization mismatch is 0.5 dB,
and if (b) the maximum power coupled between the orthogonal channels
is −30 dB?

245
Antennas
Solution
The beamwidth of the receiving antenna is u3dB ≈1.2l/D = 0.03 rad =
1.7°. The pattern level depends approximately quadratically on the angle
near the main beam maximum. Thus, the maximum allowed pointing error
is (0.5/3)1/2 × 1.7°/2 = 0.35°. The antenna receives only the component of
the incoming wave that has the same polarization as the antenna. (a) From
20 log (cos Dt) = −0.5 we solve that an error of Dt = 19.3° in the tilt angle
reduces the received power by 0.5 dB. (b) From 20 log (sin Dt) = −30 we
solve that Dt = 1.8° gives a cross-polar discrimination of 30 dB. Thus, to
avoid interference between the orthogonal channels, the error in the tilt
angle should not be too large.

Propagation of Radio Waves
In the previous chapter we studied a radio link between two antennas.
Equation (9.62) applies for the link between two antennas when the wave
propagates unhindered and without atmospheric attenuation; only the
decrease of power density as 1/r2 is taken into account. In practice, many
factors, such as troposphere, ionosphere, terrain, and buildings, affect propa-
gation of the radio waves. From a system point of view, the concept of the
radio propagation channel or just the radio channel covers the radio wave
propagation phenomena between a transmitting and receiving antenna. This
channel may be considered as a system element that transforms input signals
into output signals. It is analogous to a time-variant linear filter.
10.1 Environment and Propagation Mechanisms
The troposphere is the lowest part of the atmosphere, where all weather
phenomena occur. It extends on the poles to about 9 km and on the equator
to about 17 km. The troposphere is inhomogeneous and constantly changing.
Temperature, pressure, humidity, and precipitation affect the propagation
of radio waves. In the troposphere the radio waves attenuate, scatter, refract,
and reflect; the amplitude and phase of the received signal may fluctuate
randomly due to multipath propagation; the polarization of the wave may
change; noise originating from the atmosphere is added to the signal.
The ionosphere extends from about 60 km to 1,000 km. It contains
plasma, which is gas ionized by the solar ultraviolet and particle radiation.
247

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The free electrons of the ionosphere form a mirror, which reflects the radio
waves at frequencies below about 10 MHz. The upper frequency limit of
reflection depends on time of day and season, and on solar activity.
Also terrain and man-made objects diffract, scatter, and reflect radio
waves. At low frequencies the attenuation of the ground waves (waves propa-
gating close to the Earth’s surface) depends on the electrical properties of
the ground.
Radio waves can propagate from one point to another in many ways.
The most important mechanisms of propagation used in radio systems are,
in order of decreasing frequency, the following:
1. Propagation along a line-of-sight (LOS) path. This resembles the
propagation in free space. Because of refraction, the radio horizon
is farther away than the geometrical horizon. In UHF, SHF, and
EHF bands most radio systems require an LOS path. From the
millimeter-wave band to infrared, the radio link hops are short
because of attenuation due to precipitation and gas molecules. In
VHF and UHF bands multipath propagation is common: The
LOS path may be complemented or interfered by diffraction and
reflection from buildings and ground as well as by propagation
through vegetation and building walls.
2. Scattering from inhomogeneities of the atmosphere. The applicable
frequency range is from 300 MHz to 10 GHz.
3. Propagation via the ionosphere. A radio wave may reflect from the
ionosphere at frequencies below 30 MHz. A wave may also reflect
multiple times between the ionosphere and ground, and thus propa-
gate round the globe.
4. Ground-wave propagation. The attenuation of the ground wave
increases rapidly versus frequency; this phenomenon is important
at frequencies below 10 MHz.
Figure 10.1 illustrates different propagation mechanisms. In a given
radio link, the waves may propagate through several different mechanisms.
In long hops, a ground wave is dominating up to 150 kHz, and the iono-
spheric wave in the frequency range of 1.5 MHz to 30 MHz, depending
on the state of the ionosphere. At frequencies from 150 kHz to 1,500 kHz
both mechanisms are equally important. As it does in VHF and UHF bands,
the wave propagates through several paths, but now the reason is diffraction
and reflection from buildings and ground. Due to the interference of waves

nisms described in text).
propagating via different routes, the power level of the received signal may
alternate considerably over time and location (fast fading).
Propagation beyond the radio horizon is also possible due to tropo-
spheric reflections at frequencies from 30 MHz to 1,000 MHz, and due to
ducting at frequencies above 1 GHz. These propagation mechanisms are,
however, so unreliable, that one cannot build a continuous radio path based
on them. On the contrary, they cause interference to other radio links in
the same frequency band.
In general, the available power received cannot be accurately predicted.
The signal power level may alternate several tens of decibels in a given radio
path. In order to reach a high reliability in a radio system, one must know
the statistical distribution of the link attenuation and design the antenna
sizes and power of transmission accordingly.
10.2 Tropospheric Attenuation
At frequencies above a few gigahertz, the attenuation due to atmospheric
absorption and scattering must be taken into account. This attenuation can
be divided into two parts: attenuation due to clear air and attenuation due
to precipitation (raindrops, hail, and snow flakes) and fog. Attenuation of
the clear air is mainly due to resonance states of oxygen (O2) and water
vapor (H2O) molecules. An energy quantum corresponding to the resonance

250
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
frequency may change the rotational energy state of a gas molecule. When
the molecule absorbs an energy quantum, the molecule is excited to a higher
energy state. When it returns back to equilibrium—that is, drops back to
the ground state—it radiates the energy difference, but not necessarily at
the same frequency because returning to equilibrium may happen in smaller
energy steps. Under pressure the molecular emission lines have a wide spec-
trum. Therefore the energy quantum is lost from the propagating wave, and
for the same reason the atmosphere is always noisy at all frequencies.
The lowest resonance frequencies of oxygen are 60 GHz and 119 GHz,
and those of water vapor are 22, 183, and 325 GHz. The amount of oxygen
is always nearly constant, but that of water vapor is highly variable versus
time and location. The attenuation constant due to water vapor is directly
proportional to the absolute amount of water vapor, which is a function of
temperature and humidity. Figure 10.2 presents the clear air attenuation
versus frequency. Between the resonance frequencies there are so-called spec-
tral windows centered at frequencies 35, 95, 140, and 220 GHz. At resonance
frequencies the attenuation may be tens of decibels per kilometer. These
frequencies are, however, suitable for intersatellite links, for short terrestrial
links, and for WLANs.
Figure 10.3 presents attenuation due to rain and fog. Attenuation of
rain is mainly due to scattering: The electric field of the radio wave polarizes

the water molecules of the raindrop, and then the raindrop acts like a small
electric dipole radiating over a large solid angle. A heavy rain makes long
radio hops impossible at frequencies above 10 GHz. In a moderate rain
(5 mm/hr) attenuation is 0.08 dB/km at 10 GHz and 3 dB/km at 100 GHz.
In a pouring rain (150 mm/hr) these values are about tenfold, but on the
other hand the time percentage of such strong rains is small. In a heavy rain
the drops are large and their shape is ellipsoidal. Then a horizontally polarized
wave attenuates more than a vertically polarized wave. This phenomenon,
depending on the wind speed, also causes depolarization of the wave, if the
electric field is not along either axis of the raindrop. Depolarization results
in unwanted coupling between orthogonally polarized channels and an extra
loss in reception because the receiving antenna can accept only that polariza-
tion for which it is designed. The attenuation constant due to fog and clouds
is nearly directly proportional to the amount of water.
Both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of ice are clearly
smaller than those of water. Therefore, attenuation due to dry snow is low.
Wet snow causes more attenuation, and its attenuation is directly proportional
to the amount of water.
Turbulence in the troposphere may cause also scintillation, that is,
random changes in amplitude and phase of the wave as it propagates via
different routes due to turbulence (refractive index may vary strongly over
short distances). Atmospheric propagation phenomena were the subject of

252

many studies at Helsinki University of Technology in the 1990s; some
examples of the results are presented in [1–4].
10.3 Bending (Refraction) of Radio Waves in Troposphere
The refraction index n = √er of the troposphere fluctuates over time and
location. In normal conditions the refraction index decreases monotonically
versus altitude, because the air density decreases. Because a phenomenon of
this kind is a weak function of altitude, it causes slow bending of the
ray. Fast changes in the refraction index cause scattering and reflections.
Turbulence, where temperature or humidity differs strongly from those of
the surroundings, gives rise to scattering. Reflections are caused by horizontal
boundaries in the atmosphere due to weather phenomena.
Because n is always close to unity, we often use the so-called refractivity
N, which is the difference of the refraction index value from unity in parts
per million:
N = (n −1) × 106
(10.1)
The refractivity for air is obtained from equations
N = 77.6
T Sp + 4,810 e
TD
(10.2)
e = 6.11R exp [19.7(T −273)/T ]
(10.3)
where T is the absolute temperature, p is the barometric pressure (unit mb
= hPa), e is the partial pressure of water vapor (mb), and R is the relative
humidity. The error of (10.2) is less than 0.5%, if f < 30 GHz, p =
200–1,100 mb, T = 240–310K, and e < 30 mb. If there is no resonance
frequency of oxygen or water vapor molecules in the vicinity, this equation
is useful up to 1,000 GHz.
According to an ITU-R specification, the average refractivity of the
atmosphere versus altitude follows equation
N(h) = NA e −bA h
(10.4)
where NA = 315 and bA = 0.136 km−1. These values are calculated using
the standard-atmosphere model: p = 1,013 mb, its change −12 mb/100m

upward, T = 15°C, its change −0.55°C/100m upward, R = 60%. A more
accurate model may be obtained by using maps published by ITU-R.
Let us now consider a wave that propagates in the troposphere in a
direction that makes an angle f with the horizontal plane, as shown in
Figure 10.4. Because the refraction index changes with altitude, the angle
f changes while the wave propagates. According to Snell’s law,
n cos f = constant
(10.5)
By derivating this equation with altitude h, we get

as n ≈1, and for terrestrial radio paths in general f ≈0°, that is, cos f ≈1.

i.e., the rate of change of direction with distance) of the ray is

ds ≈dn
dh = −10−6NA bA = −43 × 10−6 km−1
(10.9)
that is, the ray bends downward.
Also the Earth’s surface bends downward, and its curvature is −1/R,
where the Earth’s radius is R = 6,370 km. Therefore the curvature of the
ray in reference to the Earth’s surface is
dn
dh + 1
R = 1
KR
(10.10)
When analyzing radio paths in the troposphere, we can imagine that the
ray is straight, if we use an effective Earth radius KR (see Figure 10.5). In
the average atmosphere KR = 8,760 km or K = 1.375. Often we use a value
of K = 4/3.
Temporarily the distribution of the refraction index versus altitude
may differ considerably from that of the average atmosphere. If dn/dh =
−157 × 10−6 km−1, the ray bends as fast as the Earth’s surface (K = ∞). If
dn/dh < −157 × 10−6 km−1, the ray bends toward the Earth’s surface
(K < 0). The wave may propagate long distances with successive reflections,
as illustrated in Figure 10.6. Propagation with this mechanism is called
ducting. Ducting may happen in the so-called inversion layer, where tempera-
ture increases rapidly as altitude increases. Such an inversion layer may range
in height from a few meters to about 100m and may appear near the ground
or at a high altitude.

tion above the surface of an extended globe.

10.4 LOS Path
In an LOS path the receiving antenna is above the radio horizon of the
transmitting station. Links between two satellites and between an earth
station and a satellite are LOS paths, and a path between two terrestrial
stations may be such. In the two latter cases the tropospheric effects discussed
previously must be taken into account.
According to the ray theory, it is enough that just a ray can propagate
unhindered from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. In reality
a radio wave requires much more space in order to propagate without extra
loss. The free space must be the size of the so-called first Fresnel ellipsoid,
shown in Figure 10.7. It is characterized by
r1 + r2 −r0 = l/2

where r1 and r2 are distances of a point on the ellipsoid from the transmitting
and receiving points, and r0 is their direct distance. The radius of the first
Fresnel ellipsoid is

We observe that the radius of the ellipsoid in a given path is the smaller
the higher the frequency; that is, the ray theory holds better at higher
frequencies.
Figure 10.8 shows the extra attenuation due to a knife-edge obstacle
in the first Fresnel ellipsoid. According to the ray theory, an obstacle hindering
the ray causes an infinite attenuation, and an obstacle just below the ray
does not have any effect on the attenuation. However, the result shown in
Figure 10.8 is reality and is better explained by Huygens’ principle: Every
point of the wavefront above the obstacle is a source point of a new spherical
wave. This explains diffraction (or bending) of the wave due to an obstacle.
Diffraction also helps the wave to propagate behind the obstacle to a space,
which is not seen from the original point of transmission. When the knife-
edge obstacle is just on the LOS path (h = 0), it causes an extra attenuation
of 6 dB. When the obstacle reaches just to the lower boundary of the first
Fresnel ellipsoid, the wave arriving at the receiving point may be even stronger
than that in a fully obstacle-free case. If there is a hill in the propagation
path that cannot be considered a knife-edge, extra attenuation is even higher
than in case of a knife-edge obstacle.
When terrestrial radio-link hops are designed, bending of the Earth’s
surface as well as bending of the ray in the troposphere must be taken into

account. The radio horizon is at the distance of rH if the transmitting antenna
is at the height of
hH = r2
H
2KR
(10.13)
Example 10.1
Consider a 50-km radio-link hop at 10 GHz, when the antenna heights are
the same. What are the required antenna heights?
Solution
Taking K = 4/3 we get from (10.13) that the radio horizon of the antennas
is in the middle point of the path between the antennas, when hH = 36.8m.
By introducing l = 0.03m and r1 = r2 = 25 km into (10.12) we get the
radius of the first Fresnel ellipsoid in the middle point as hF = 19.4m. The
antenna heights must be then at least h = hH + hF = 56.2m. In addition,
if there are woods in the path, the height of the trees must be taken into
account.
At low frequencies, fulfillment of the requirement of leaving the first
Fresnel ellipsoid empty is difficult. Often we must compromise. For example,
at 100 MHz in the 50-km hop of the example, the maximum radius of the
first Fresnel ellipsoid is 194m.
A radio-link hop design is aided by using a profile diagram of the
terrain, which takes into account the bending of the radio ray in standard
conditions. In the diagram, the height scale is much larger than the horizontal
scale, and the terrain along the hop is drawn so that perpendicular directions
against the Earth’s surface are parallel. The middle point of the hop is placed
in the middle of the diagram. After drawing the terrain, the antenna heights
are selected so that the first Fresnel ellipsoid is fully in free space, if possible.
Figure 10.9 presents a profile diagram between Korppoo and Turku in the
Finnish archipelago.
10.5 Reflection from Ground
In an LOS path, the receiving antenna often receives, besides a direct wave,
waves that are reflected from the ground or from obstacles such as buildings.
This is called multipath propagation.

258
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Figure 10.9 Profile diagram for radio-link hop planning.
Let us consider a simple situation, where there is a flat, smooth ground
surface between the transmitting and receiving antenna masts, which are
located so that their distance is d, and the distance between the transmitting
and receiving points is r0, as presented in Figure 10.10. In practice this
situation may be quite typical in VHF and UHF radio broadcasting, where
an antenna mast with a height h1 is at the broadcasting station. Let us
further assume that the transmitting antenna radiates isotropically. The
electric field strength due to the direct wave at the distance r0 from the
transmitter is E0. Taking also the reflected wave into account, the total
electric field strength at the receiving point is
E ≈E0F1 + re −jb(r1+r2−r0)G
(10.14)
where r is the reflection coefficient of the ground surface, and we have
assumed that r1 + r2 ≈r0. The reflection coefficient depends on the electric
Figure 10.10 A direct and reflected wave.

259
Propagation of Radio Waves
properties of the surface and on the polarization of the wave. At frequencies
above 30 MHz the reflection coefficient can be assumed to be −1 if the
polarization is horizontal (or perpendicular) and the antenna heights are
much less than the distance d ; that is, the grazing angle g is small. For the
vertical or parallel polarization the amplitude and phase angle of the reflection
coefficient vary rapidly at small angles g [5].
In the following we assume a horizontal polarization. In practice the
antenna heights h1 and h2 are often small compared to the distance d, and
therefore the angle g is small and r1 + r2 −r0 ≈2h1h2/d. Now the field
strength is
E ≈E0X1 −e −jb2h1h2/dC
(10.15)
The actual radiation pattern corresponds to that of the array formed
by the transmitting antenna and its mirror image. The electric field strength
E varies as a function of distance between values 0 and 2E0, as shown in
Figure 10.11(a). Note that E0 decreases as 1/d. The nulls of the field strength
(maxima for vertical polarization in case of an ideal conducting surface) are
at heights h2 ≈nld/(2h1), where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , as shown in Figure
10.11(b). The receiving antenna height must be selected correctly. In order
to reduce the effects of reflections, it is possible to use a transmitting antenna
that has radiation nulls at directions of the reflection points. Also, a forest
at the theoretical reflection points helps because it effectively eliminates
reflections.
Figure 10.11 Field strength (a) as a function of the distance d when the receiving antenna
height is h2 = 10m and (b) as a function of the receiving antenna height h2
when d = 10 km. The situation resembles Figure 10.10: r = −1, f = 500 MHz,
h1 = 300m.

260
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Example 10.2
The transmitting antenna is located at a height of 300m. The frequency is
225 MHz, and the polarization is horizontal. What is the best height for a
receiving antenna at a distance of 12 km, if the terrain between the antennas
is a flat field?
Solution
Reflection from the surface causes a phase shift of 180°. Therefore the electric
fields of the direct and reflected wave add up in phase when the path
difference r1 + r2 −r0 ≈2h1h2/d is equal to l/2. The optimum height of
the receiving antenna mast is h2 = ld/(4h1) = 13.3m. Other solutions are
(2n + 1) × 13.3m.
In the preceding discussion we have assumed that the wave propagates
as a ray. However, as we discussed in Section 10.4, the ray requires the
volume of the first Fresnel ellipsoid as free space. The surface area, where
the reflection may happen, is therefore large. If the distance between the
antennas is long, bending of the Earth’s surface must also be taken into
account in determining the location of reflection.
The surface may be considered smooth, if the rms value of the surface
roughness, Dh, fulfils the following condition:
Dh <
l
32 sin g
(10.16)
If the surface is rough, a considerable part of power will scatter; that is, it
will radiate into a large solid angle.
10.6 Multipath Propagation in Cellular Mobile Radio
Systems
Figure 10.11 presents the field strength as a function of distance when a
strong reflected wave interferes with an LOS wave. As the receiver moves
away from the transmitter, the signal fades wherever the two waves are in
opposite phase. In mobile radio systems, the situation is generally much
more complex due to the multipath propagation [6, 7].
We can categorize fading phenomena in many ways. Prominent obsta-
cles between the transmitter and receiver cause large-scale fading. Because

261
Propagation of Radio Waves
of this, the path loss increases rapidly over distance and is log-normally
distributed about the mean value. Small-scale fading refers to signal amplitude
and phase variations due to small changes (order of a wavelength) in position.
Interference of several waves—multipath propagation—causes this type of
fading. Because of the multipath propagation the signal spreads in time
(dispersion) and the channel is time-variant due to the motion of the mobile
unit. Both phenomena degrade the performance of the system. Depending
on the effect of dispersion, we categorize fading either as frequency-selective
or flat. If the radio channel is frequency-selective over the signal bandwidth,
intersymbol interference (ISI) will degrade the performance. In the case of
flat fading all signal components fade equally. According to the rapidity of
changes in the time-variant channel, we categorize fading as fast or slow.
When there is a dominant LOS wave in a multipath environment, the
amplitude of the signal envelope has a Rician probability distribution. If
there is no LOS wave, as in Figure 10.12, the envelope has a Rayleigh
probability distribution. There are reflected, diffracted, and scattered waves
as well as waves propagating through vegetation and buildings. The Rayleigh
distribution is obtained by summing up a large number of independent field
components, and its probability distribution is
P(r) = r
s2 exp [−r2/(2s2)]
(10.17)
Figure 10.12 Multipath propagation in an urban environment and the signal envelope in
a fading radio channel.

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
where the envelope r(t) of the complex signal E(t) is given as r(t) =
√[Re E(t)]2 + [Im E(t)]2, and s2 is the mean power, and r2(t)/2 is the
short-term signal power.
The effect of small-scale fading may be mitigated by using in receiving
or transmitting multiple antennas, time redundancy, several polarizations,
or several frequencies (space, time, polarization, and frequency diversity).
The diversity increases the probability that at least one of the received signals
will be strong enough to be detected. Spread spectrum or multicarrier systems
can mitigate the small-scale fading due to their large bandwidth, that is,
their frequency diversity. A rake receiver can mitigate it using time diversity
by detecting replicas of the transmitted signal with different time delays [7].
A smart antenna system such as multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) can miti-
gate it through space and polarization diversity [8]. Moreover, a MIMO
system can increase the spectral efficiency by utilizing different independently
fading propagation paths as parallel data channels.
In rural areas the base station antennas are located in high antenna
masts so that most of the path is in free space or along the treetops. The
final meters or tens of meters of the path to the mobile terminal may cause
a lot of attenuation; in a forest the average excess attenuation through
vegetation at 2 GHz is about 0.4 dB/m; however, the attenuation of a tree
with or without foliage is very different. In urban areas the base station
antennas may be located at the roofs or walls of the buildings, while the
mobile terminals move along the street canyons or are inside the buildings.
Both deterministic and stochastic propagation models are used in
design, optimization, and performance evaluation of cellular mobile radio
systems. Deterministic models are based on electromagnetic simulations
(utilizing ray tracing together with geometrical optics and uniform theory
of diffraction, finite difference time domain method, and so forth) making
use of information of the specific physical environment or on measurements.
Stochastic models describe the propagation phenomena on average; they are
based on defining the fading distributions (log-normal, Rayleigh, Rician).
The model parameters are based on measurements or on a deterministic
model in a given type of environment [9, 10].
The deterministic propagation models can be divided into simplified
semiempirical path loss models and computational site-specific models. An
example of the empirical models is the Okumura-Hata model [11]. In the
Okumura-Hata model the physical environment can be selected among a
large city, a medium to small city, a suburban area, or a rural area, and the
model takes into account the antenna heights and frequency. The Walfisch-

Bertoni model [12] allows slightly more detailed characterization of the
environment; for example, the average building height and the width and
orientation of the streets can be taken into account. It counts the propagation
loss as a function of distance (free-space loss), multiscreen diffraction due
to rows of houses, and finally the roof-to-street diffraction. Inside the build-
ings, site-specific computational models are often used, but simplified models
such as the Motley-Keenan model [13], which calculates the path loss from
the free-space path loss according to the distance added by attenuation of
each wall along the path, are also in use.
10.7 Propagation Aided by Scattering: Scatter Link
Inhomogeneities of the atmosphere cause scattering. Scattering means that
part of the coherent plane wave is transformed into incoherent form and
will radiate into a large solid angle. Normally, scattering will weaken the
radio link by attenuating the signal. However, the scattered field may also
be useful: A scatter link takes advantage of scattering.
Let us first consider scattering by a single object or particle. The
scattering cross section s of an object to a given direction describes the
effective area of the object when it is illuminated by a plane wave. The power
intercepted by this area, when scattered equally in all directions, produces
the same power density as the object. The scattering cross section also depends
on the direction of the incident wave and its polarization. Figure 10.13
shows how the scattering cross section of a conducting (metal) sphere behaves
as a function of frequency, when the direction of incidence and the direction
of observation are the same. The scattering cross section of a small (in
comparison to a wavelength), metallic sphere (or of an object of another
shape) is proportional to f 4 (Rayleigh scattering). The scattering cross section
s of a large (in comparison to a wavelength) sphere is equal to its geometric
cross section sg . This is called the optical region. Between these regions
there is a resonance region (Mie scattering). Because the relative permittivity
er of water is large, the curve in Figure 10.13 also describes the scattering
of a raindrop. The total scattering cross section ss multiplied by the power
density of the incident wave gives the total power scattered by the object
into the solid angle of 4p. The total scattering cross section ss of a large
object is 2sg .
If the density of small scattering particles is r (particles per cubic
meter), the scattering cross-section density is sd = rs. In a symmetric radio
path utilizing scattering as shown in Figure 10.14, the power received is

where V is the volume where scattering occurs.

265
Propagation of Radio Waves
In radio links, three kinds of scattering are utilized: tropospheric,
ionospheric, and meteor scattering. The tropospheric scattering is due to
turbulence in the troposphere and is the most widely utilized scattering
mechanism in communication. This may provide a 500-km hop in the
microwave region. The ionospheric scattering is caused by the cloudlike
structures of the lowest layers of the ionosphere, and the meteor scattering
is caused by the ionized trails of meteors. (The ionized trail is due to the
high temperature produced by friction as the meteor enters the atmosphere
at high velocity.) These scattering mechanisms may provide radio hops of
2,000 km at frequencies from 30 to 80 MHz. Furthermore, raindrops and
snowflakes cause scattering, which may introduce interference between differ-
ent radio links.
Fading or a random variation of the signal power level is typical for
radio systems based on scattering. This phenomenon may be divided into
a slow fading, which is due to large changes in the propagation conditions,
and into a fast fading, which is due to multipath propagation. Fading can
be partially compensated by a feedback, which is used to stabilize the signal
power level, or by using diversity, as described in Section 10.6.
10.8 Propagation via Ionosphere
The highest layers of the Earth’s atmosphere are called the ionosphere,
because they contain plasma, which is ionized gas (free electrons and ions).
The ionosphere extends from 60 to 1,000 km. Below 60 km the ionization
is insignificant because the solar ionizing radiation is getting weaker due to
absorption in the higher layers, and because recombination of plasma is fast
due to high density of molecules. Above 1,000 km the density of molecules
is too low for a significant phenomenon. It is possible to distinguish different
layers in the ionosphere, as shown in Figure 10.15; they are called D, E,
F1, and F2 layers. The electron density and the height of these layers depend
on the solar activity, on the time of day and season, and on the geographical
location. During night the D layer nearly disappears, and the F1 and F2
layers merge together. The highest electron density is about 1012 electrons/m3,
and it can be found at daytime at the altitude of about 250 to 400 km in
the F2 layer.
Let us consider radio wave propagation in plasma. The electric field
having a strength E affects (accelerates) a charge q by force qE. If there are
N charges in a unit volume, the current density in case of a sinusoidal field
is (F = ma = mdv/dt = mjvv)

(2.21), can now be written as

(10.20)
The charges cause a decrease of the permittivity of medium. Because
the electron rest mass is only 1/1,836 of that of a hydrogen ion, the electrons
determine the permittivity. The relative permittivity of plasma is

is the plasma frequency. The plasma frequency in hertz is
fp ≈9√N
(10.23)
where N is the number of electrons in one cubic meter; that is, the plasma
frequency is 9 MHz for an electron density of 1012/m3.
This treatment does not take into account collisions of electrons with
neutral molecules, which causes attenuation. Furthermore, the Earth’s mag-
netic field affects the electron motion, which leads to a direction depending
on er ; that is, plasma is an anisotropic and nonreciprocal medium and er
is a tensor. The nonreciprocity causes Faraday rotation (see Section 6.2).
The electric field of a linearly polarized wave may rotate, causing wrong
polarization in reception. Therefore, in radio systems utilizing the ionosphere,
a circular polarization is preferred.
A wave can propagate in plasma only if its frequency is higher than
the plasma frequency. Otherwise er is negative and the wave will be totally
reflected. At frequencies well above the plasma frequency, er ≈1, and the
effect of plasma on radio wave propagation is negligible. In practice, there
is no need to take the ionosphere into account at VHF and higher frequencies.
A wave propagating vertically into the ionosphere will be reflected at
altitude where er = 0, that is, fp = f. If the wave approaches the ionosphere
in an angle f0, as shown in Figure 10.16, reflection takes place at a height
where
fp = f cos f0
(10.24)
Via the ionosphere it is possible to obtain a radio hop to a distance
of 4,000 km just with one reflection. Also, longer hops are possible if the
wave reflects from the ground back to the ionosphere. In a given radio link
the frequency must be higher than the lowest usable frequency (LUF) but
lower than the maximum usable frequency (MUF). The LUF and MUF
depend on the temporary characteristics of the ionosphere.
10.9 Propagation as a Ground (Surface) Wave
If the transmitting and receiving antennas are close (in comparison to a
wavelength) to the ground, the wave propagates bound to the ground, as a

268
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

surface wave. The electric field strength of the wave decreases rapidly as the
distance from the surface increases. At low frequencies the attenuation of
such a ground wave is small, and the wave can propagate beyond the horizon
thousands of kilometers, especially over seawater. However, the attenuation
of a ground wave increases rapidly with frequency. Therefore this propagation
mechanism is useful only below 10 MHz.
Attenuation of the wave depends on conductivity and permittivity of
the surface (land, lake, or sea). Table 10.1 shows some typical characteristics
at frequencies below 30 MHz. At microwave frequencies these characteristics
change strongly as a function of frequency. ITU-R publishes field strength
graphs for different surface types. Figure 10.17 presents the electric field
strength versus distance when the wave propagates along the surface of a
medium dry land and sea [14]. The transmitting antenna is a vertical mono-
pole, and the power transmitted is 1 kW. The graphs show that at 10 kHz
the electric field strength decreases as 1/r (as in free space) up to a distance

of 1,000 km. At higher frequencies the attenuation is much higher. Over
the sea the wave attenuates much slower than over medium dry land. In
practice the electrical characteristics of the surface may vary a lot between
the transmitting and receiving stations, and therefore a prediction of the
power to be received is difficult.

Radio System
Performance of a whole radio system, such as a cellular network, navigation
system, or radar, depends on the characteristics of the transmitters, receivers,
and antennas as well as of propagation of radio waves between the transmitting
and receiving antennas. If the transmitted power and the gains and attenua-
tions in different parts of the system are known, the received power can be
calculated. However, in addition to the received power, there are other factors
affecting the signal detection: modulation of the signal, frequency stability,
interference from other radio systems, noise, dispersion due to the radio
channel, and so on.
In this chapter we first briefly discuss transmitters and receivers. Then
we study noise in more detail as it decreases the performance of any radio
system. We also study different modulation techniques, that is, how informa-
tion can be attached to the carrier. Finally we consider the link budget. In
Chapter 12 some radio systems are studied in more detail.
11.1 Transmitters and Receivers
A radio transmitter must produce a signal that has enough power, has
generally a very accurate frequency, and has a clean enough spectrum so
that the transmitter does not disturb users of other radio systems. Information
to be transmitted, the baseband signal, is attached to a sinusoidal carrier signal
by modulating the carrier amplitude, frequency, or phase either analogically or
digitally (see Section 11.3).
271

272
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Low-power transmitters are usually based on a semiconductor device,
a transistor or diode oscillator. When a transmitter power of hundreds of
watts is needed, power is generated with electron tubes or so-called microwave
tubes. Tetrodes are used from LF to VHF, and klystrons at UHF and
SHF. In radar transmitters, a magnetron oscillator is the most common. In
klystrons, magnetrons, and other microwave tubes, microwave oscillation is
generated by an electron beam interacting with a resonance cavity or a slow-
wave structure [1].
In order to have a sufficiently accurate and clean signal, the oscillator
frequency must be stabilized and the signal must be bandpass filtered before
transmitting. Oscillators may be stabilized using a resonator with a sufficiently
high quality factor. Often the accurate frequency is based on a quartz crystal
oscillator at a frequency of 1 to 40 MHz and with a frequency stability of
10−9 to 10−10 per day. The signal of the quartz oscillator is frequency
multiplied to the transmission frequency and then amplified, or it is used
to injection lock or phase lock another oscillator to the correct frequency.
Figure 11.1 presents a direct-conversion transmitter. A digital baseband
signal modulates the carrier in an IQ-modulator (see Section 11.3.2). The
modulated signal is then filtered and amplified. In a superheterodyne trans-
mitter the signal is further upconverted to the final frequency. The carrier
frequency is stabilized by phase locking [2]. A basic phase-locked loop (PLL)
is a feedback system consisting of a VCO, a phase detector (for example, a
double-balanced mixer), and a low-pass filter. In the loop of Figure 11.1
there is also in the feedback branch a digital circuit that divides the frequency
of the VCO by N. The output of the divider is compared with the signal
from the reference oscillator in the phase detector. A possible difference in
frequency (in phase) is transformed into a voltage proportional to the phase
difference, and after lowpass filtering this voltage is used to control the VCO
frequency until the frequency difference is zero. The output frequency of
the locked loop is Nfref . The loop also stabilizes within its bandwidth the
random phase variations of the VCO and, thus, the reference oscillator
determines the phase-noise characteristics.

Radio System
If the system must operate at several nearby frequencies (channels),
the transmitter and receiver signals are generated in a frequency synthesizer
[3]. The synthesis may be based on a PLL, on a direct synthesis, or on a
direct digital synthesis (DDS). If a programmable divider is employed in
Figure 11.1, this PLL can produce several frequencies spaced by fref . Smaller
frequency steps are obtained by combining several PLLs or by using a
fractional-N loop, where the division ratio is a fraction and is not limited
to integer values. The direct synthesis uses mixers, frequency multipliers,
dividers, filters, and switches to produce accurate frequencies. This method
may not be practical if a large number of closely spaced frequencies are
needed, because the synthesizer would become very complex. In the DDS
a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) generates the waveform using a look-up
table. Accurately modulated signals with very good frequency resolution may
be produced using DDS, but the upper frequency is limited by the available
DACs to a few hundred megahertz.
The receiver must be sensitive and selective. It must be able to detect
even a weak signal among many other, possibly stronger signals. Therefore,
a good receiver must have good filters, an accurate local oscillator frequency,
and low-noise components. It should have also a large, spurious-free dynamic
range.
Receivers are usually superheterodyne receivers (here ‘‘super’’ comes
originally from ‘‘supersonic,’’ meaning that there is an intermediate frequency
higher than the audio frequency, that is, the baseband signal frequency in
a voice radio). Figure 11.2 presents such a receiver, where the signal from
the antenna is first filtered and then amplified by an LNA by 10 to 20 dB.
In front of a mixer an image-rejection filter blocks the image band. A
frequency synthesizer generates an accurate local oscillator (LO) signal. The
mixer downconverts the signal to an IF, where it is again filtered with a
narrowband filter (e.g., a SAW filter) and amplified by an IF amplifier (e.g.
by 70 to 100 dB) before demodulation. The demodulator recovers the
original analog or digital baseband signal. If the signal power level may vary

cation.

significantly, the IF gain should be controllable with an automatic gain control
(AGC) circuit in order to avoid saturation in the back end.
There are many other receiver architectures. Often in a superheterodyne
receiver the signal is downconverted twice. In such a dual-conversion receiver
the first IF is high and the second IF is low. This facilitates the realization
of filters. Distribution of the gain to several frequencies also reduces the
tendency of the receiver to oscillate.
Figure 11.3 shows a direct-conversion receiver, which is called also a
homodyne or zero-IF receiver. The signal is now downconverted directly to
the baseband. There is no IF stage and, thus, this structure is simpler and
better suited for integration than the superheterodyne architecture. Lower
power consumption and the possibility of making the channel filter at the
baseband are other advantages. However, as the LO frequency equals the
carrier frequency, leaking of the LO power may cause severe problems. In
a dual-conversion receiver the channel selection can be realized with a synthe-
sizer operating at the IF, but in a direct-conversion receiver the synthesizer
must operate at the higher carrier frequency.
In a direct IF sampling receiver, which is also called a software radio,
the whole band at the IF is sampled with an analog-to-digital converter
(ADC). Channel filtering and demodulation is then realized with digital
signal processing. This architecture is flexible and suited multimode opera-
tion, because the system standard may easily be changed. However, the ADC
is now a critical component; it has to operate very linearly over a large
dynamic range.
A transceiver is a combination of a transmitter and receiver sharing
the same antenna. Now the isolation of the transmitter and receiver has to
be very large, for example, 120 dB. If the transmitter and receiver operate
Figure 11.3 Direct-conversion receiver.

275
Radio System
at different frequencies, called frequency division duplexing (FDD), a duplexing
filter separates them from each other. A duplexing filter consists of two
bandpass filters. If the transmitter and receiver operate in different time
slots, called time division duplexing (TDD), a switch can be used to isolate
the receiver during transmission. The loss of a switch is usually less than
the loss of a duplexing filter.
A high level of integration is essential in the mass production of low-
cost transceivers and receivers. The ultimate goal is to integrate all the
transceiver electronics on a single chip, because external components increase
the cost. High-quality filters and resonators are often too difficult to integrate
on a chip. The practical solution is to combine several chips made using
different technologies with some external components. Low-cost silicon-
based technologies such as bipolar, BiCMOS, and CMOS technology are
used to produce chips up to about 3 GHz. When top performance is required
or the frequency is higher, chips are made using GaAs and InP technologies.
11.2 Noise
Random fields and voltages, that is, noise, disturb all radio systems. The
antenna receives noise from its surroundings, and all receiver components,
which are either active or lossy, generate noise. We call the former the
antenna noise and the latter the receiver noise; their sum is called the system
noise. In a radio system (e.g., a communication link) the system noise power
in the receiver bandwidth may be stronger than the signal to be received.
The ratio of the signal power to the noise power at the receiver bandwidth,
that is, the S /N often determines the quality of a radio link. However, noise
signals may also be useful, as is the case in radiometry, for example, in
remote sensing and radio astronomy (see Sections 12.7 and 12.8).
In system considerations, a radio channel, where white noise corrupting
the signal is the only nonideality, is called the additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN) channel. In addition to noise, in practical radio channels there
are other nonidealities. When the small-scale fading or Rayleigh fading in
multipath propagation conditions is the limiting factor for the channel
performance, we call it a Rayleigh fading channel.
11.2.1
Receiver Noise
In a receiver, many kinds of noise are generated, for example, thermal noise,
shot noise, 1/f noise, and quantum noise.

276
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Thermal noise is generated by the thermal motion of charge carriers.
The warmer the material is, the more electrons collide with the crystal lattice
of the material. Each collision causes a change in the kinetic energy state of
the electron, and the energy difference is radiated as an electromagnetic
wave. Similarly, collisions are also the reason for resistivity of a material and,
therefore, thermal noise is generated in all materials and circuits absorbing
RF power. Thermal noise is directly proportional to the absolute temperature
of the medium, but its power density is independent of frequency—it is so-
called white noise.
Shot noise is often the most important noise mechanism in semiconduc-
tor devices and electron tubes. Shot noise is caused by the fact that charge
is not a continuous quantity but always a multiple of an electron charge.
For example, a current going through the Schottky interface is not continuous
but is a sum of the current impulses of single electrons. The power density
of shot noise is directly proportional to the current.
At low frequencies there is 1/f noise (flicker noise) in all semiconductor
devices. It is caused, for example, by the fluctuating amount of electrons in
the conduction band. Its power density is inversely proportional to frequency.
Quantum noise is due to the quantized energy of the radio wave. It
is important only in cases of submillimeter and shorter waves, because their
energy quantum W = hf is large.
Noise properties of a device are described by the noise factor F or the
equivalent noise temperature Te [4]. The latter is also called the effective
input noise temperature, the input noise temperature, or just the noise
temperature. The noise factor of a linear two-port is defined [5] by
F =
Nout
Ga Nin
(11.1)
where Nin is the available noise power in a bandwidth df from a matched
resistive termination (here ‘‘matched’’ means that the termination is matched
to the characteristic impedance of the line) at temperature T0 = 290K
connected to the input of the device, and Nout is the total noise power
available at the output port in a bandwidth df when the input power is Nin .
Ga is the available power gain of the two-port for incoherent signals from
an input bandwidth of df to an output bandwidth of df. The noise factor
indicates how many times larger the output noise power of the device is
compared to that of a noiseless device, when both have in the input a
matched resistive termination at the absolute reference temperature of
T0 = 290K.

277
Radio System
The equivalent noise temperature is defined by means of the noise
factor as follows:
Te = (F −1)T0
(11.2)
or
F = 1 + Te
T0
(11.3)
In other words, the equivalent noise temperature can be defined as the
physical temperature, at which the matched resistive input termination of
a noiseless device should be in order to have the same available noise power
in the output as the noisy device itself produces into its output when its
matched resistive input termination is at the absolute zero temperature.
A resistor R at temperature T generates noise, the rms voltage of which
in a bandwidth of df is
vn =√
4Rhfdf
e hf /kT −1
≈√4kTdfR
(11.4)
where h = 6.626 × 10−34 Js is Planck’s constant and k = 1.381 × 10−23 J/K
is Boltzmann’s constant. The approximation of (11.4) is valid when
hf << kT. The available noise power from this resistor, that is, the noise
power from this resistor to another resistor with the same resistance, is
P =S
vn
2RD
2
R = kTdf
(11.5)
This noise power P is equal to Nin in (11.1), and therefore the noise factor
is
F =
Nout
kT0dfGa
(11.6)
In (11.6) Nout is sometimes for practical reasons the power delivered
(coupled) to the load; then, instead of the available power gain, one must
use the transducer power gain Gt (see (5.26)). Because the available noise

278
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
power in the input is Nin = kT0df and the ratio of the signal powers in
output and in input is Ga = Sout /Sin , the noise factor can also be presented
as a ratio of the signal-to-noise ratios (S /N ) in input and in output, as
F = (S /N )in
(S /N )out
(11.7)
Thus, the noise factor describes the degradation of the S /N in the device,
when the matched input termination is at 290K. The noise figure is the
noise factor in decibels, that is,
F (dB) = 10 log F
(11.8)
So far we have assumed that the noise properties of the device are
constant over the bandwidth df. An average noise factor is
F =
E
∞
0
F( f )Gt ( f ) df
E
∞
0
Gt ( f ) df
(11.9)
where F( f ) is the noise factor at a point frequency.
An often-useful quantity in noise analysis is the noise bandwidth Bn
of the device illustrated in Figure 11.4:
Figure 11.4 Definition of the noise bandwidth Bn .

279
Radio System
Bn =
1
Gt,max E
∞
0
Gt ( f ) df
(11.10)
where Gt,max is the maximum value of the transducer power gain. In respect
to white noise in the input, the device behaves like a device that has a gain
of Gt,max over the noise bandwidth Bn and a gain of zero at all frequencies
outside this band.
Let us next consider the equivalent noise temperature of a resistive
attenuator at a physical temperature T. If both the attenuator itself and its
matched resistive input termination are at the same physical temperature,
the attenuator absorbs and emits the same amount of energy. When we
measure the noise power from this attenuator in a bandwidth of df, we get
the following result (assuming hf << kT ) as in (11.5)
Nout = kdfT = Nin e −t + Nint = kdfTe −t + kdfT(1 −e −t )
(11.11)
where t is the so-called optical depth, which describes the rate of absorption
and emission in the attenuator. For a section of a transmission line with a
length l and an attenuation constant a, the optical depth is t = al, and
therefore the attenuation of this attenuator is L = e al = e t. Now we know
that the intrinsic noise power Nint is
Nint = kdfT(1 −e −t ) = kdfTS1 −1
LD
(11.12)
By the definition of the equivalent noise temperature, the input noise temper-
ature TL of a resistive attenuator at a physical temperature T is then
TL = T(L −1)
(11.13)
A receiver is, from the signal and noise point of view, all the way from
the antenna terminals to the detector a chain of linear two-ports, as shown
in Figure 11.5. The noise factor of such a chain is

(11.15)
In (11.14) and (11.15) Fi , Ti , and Gi are the noise factor, noise temperature,
and available gain of the ith two-port of the chain. Equations (11.14) and
(11.15) are called the Friis noise equations. They are valid only if the two-
ports are matched to each other.
According to (11.15), the first stage determines the noise temperature
of a receiver, if G1 is high enough and T2 low enough. If possible, a good
amplifier should be placed as the first stage of the receiver. In a comparison
of different amplifiers, a quantity called the noise measure is used. The noise
measure is
M =
F −1
1 −1/Ga
(11.16)
which is the noise factor of an infinitely long chain of similar amplifiers
minus one. When cascading two amplifiers, it is better to put as the first
stage an amplifier, which has the lowest noise measure, and not necessarily
the one, which has the lowest noise factor.

281
Radio System
Example 11.1
You have two low-noise amplifiers, LNA1 and LNA2, with characteristics
T1 = 100K, G1 = 13 dB, and T2 = 90K, G2 = 7 dB, respectively. You want
to use these LNAs together in a series connection in the input of a low-
noise receiver. Which one should be placed as the first stage in order to
obtain the best possible noise performance of the receiver?
Solution
Let us first calculate the corresponding noise factors: F1 = 1 + T1/T0 = 1
+ 100/290 = 1.34, and F2 = 1 + 90/290 = 1.31. Gains of the amplifiers in
absolute values are G1 = 20.0 and G2 = 5.0. Now we can calculate the noise
measures: M1 = (F1 −1)/(1 −1/G1) = 0.34/0.95 = 0.36, and M2 = 0.31/0.8
= 0.39. Therefore, LNA1 should be placed as the first stage.
The noise factor and noise temperature of a mixer are quantities,
which continuously cause confusion, especially in the case of millimeter-
wave receivers, where a mixer is often the first stage [6]. The reason for the
confusion is the presence of an image sideband in the mixer. The most
frequent errors in the noise factor and noise temperature usage are made in
the following areas:
• The SSB quantities of a DSB mixer (also called a broadband mixer)
are confused with the respective quantities of an SSB mixer (also
called a narrowband or image-rejection mixer);
• Depending on the situation, the noise generated in the image termi-
nation is to be included as a part of either the receiver noise or the
source noise;
• Many old rules of thumb, valid for calculating SSB quantities from
DSB quantities of a DSB mixer (or vice versa) in a special case, are
unfortunately used also in other cases where they are not valid.
In a mixer, power is converted to the intermediate frequency not only
from the signal sideband but also from other sidebands, especially from the
image sideband. Let us consider a DSB mixer, which has conversion losses
Ls and Li from the signal and image sideband, respectively, to the intermediate
frequency band, and the conversion loss values from other (harmonic) side-
bands are infinitely large. The DSB noise temperature TM,DSB of this mixer
is, according to the definition of the equivalent noise temperature, the

282
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
temperature of a termination that is connected to the noiseless mixer at both
the signal and image sidebands. However, the SSB noise temperature TM,SSB
is the temperature of a termination, according to the definition that is
connected to the noiseless mixer only at the signal sideband, and at the
image sideband there is a termination at the temperature of 0K. Then the
DSB and SSB noise temperatures of the DSB mixer are related to each other
as
TM,SSB = TM,DSBS1 + Ls
LiD
(11.17)
If the first stage of the receiver is a mixer, the receiver noise temperature
is
TR = TM + Lc TIF
(11.18)
where Lc is the conversion loss of the mixer, TM is the mixer noise tempera-
ture, and TIF is the noise temperature of the IF amplifier. The receiver SSB
noise temperature is obtained with TM = TM,SSB and Lc = LM,SSB = Ls ,
and the DSB noise temperature is obtained with TM = TM,DSB and Lc =
LM,DSB = Ls Li /(Ls + Li ). For diode mixers Lc is larger than unity and,
therefore, the noise temperature of the IF amplifier plays a very important
role in the receiver noise temperature.
It is worth emphasizing that if an image-rejection filter is placed in
front of the DSB mixer, the mixer turns into an SSB mixer, and its conversion
loss Lc is no more equal to the original Ls neither is its noise temperature
the one obtained from (11.17).
So far we have assumed that when we use a DSB mixer in an SSB
mode, there is a termination at 0K at the image sideband. However, this is
not the case in practice. For example, a radiometer observing the atmospheric
molecular lines often utilizes a DSB mixer as its first stage, and although
the useful signal now enters the receiver only at the signal sideband, the
same atmospheric background noise enters the receiver at both sidebands,
and the termination impedance at both sidebands is nearly the same, that
is, the antenna radiation impedance. In this case we have to add a term
(Ls /Li )Ti into the receiver noise temperature of (11.18) in order to have
a noise quantity, which really describes the receiver’s ability to detect the
useful signal at the signal sideband. Here Ti is the image sideband termination
temperature, which is often nearly equal to the antenna noise temperature
(see Section 11.2.2), that is, Ti ≈TA .

Example 11.2
Calculate the receiver noise temperature and noise figure of a receiver con-
sisting of an LNA, followed by an image-rejection mixer, and an IF amplifier.
The characteristics of the components are TLNA = 50K and GLNA = 10 dB,
TM = 500K and LM = 6 dB, TIF = 200K and GIF = 50 dB. How much
worse is the receiver performance if at a room temperature of 295K there
is a cable with a loss of 0.2 dB in front of the LNA?
Solution
The component gains in absolute values are GLNA = 10, LM = 4, and GIF
= 100,000, but the latter is not needed in this calculation. TR = TLNA +
(1/GLNA )TM + (LM /GLNA )TIF = 50K + (1/10)500K + (4/10)200K =
(50 + 50 + 80)K = 180K. FR (dB) = 10 log (1 + TR /T0) = 10 log 1.62 =
2.1 dB. When the cable with loss of L = 0.2 dB (in absolute value L is 1.05)
is added in front of this receiver, we get a new receiver noise temperature
TR′ = (L −1)Troom + LTR = (1.05 −1)295K + 1.05 × 180 = 15K + 189K
= 204K.
When the aim is to have a very low-noise receiver, the receiver front
end is cooled down to, for example, a temperature of 20K. The cooling
reduces the noise temperature of an amplifier or a mixer but also the thermal
noise from resistive loss in transmission lines and other components. Some

284
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
amplifier and mixer types are able to operate only at very low temperatures,
for example, a maser and a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) quasi-
particle mixer. Figure 11.6 presents noise temperatures of different microwave
amplifiers and mixers.
11.2.2
Antenna Noise Temperature
Besides the useful signal, an antenna also receives noise power from its
surroundings. The antenna noise temperature TA is defined as the tempera-
ture of such a matched resistive termination, which provides the same noise
power as the noise power available from the antenna terminals, which is
equal to the noise power received by the antenna in case of a lossless antenna.
In the following we assume a lossless antenna.
A so-called black surface does not reflect any radiation incident on it.
At optical wavelengths such a surface is black in color. In a thermal equilib-

reference.

rium, the black surface must emit the same power as it absorbs. At temperature
T its brightness, or the power radiated per square meter, hertz, and steradian,
is [7]
B = 2hf 3
c2

e hf /kT −1
(11.23)
At radio frequencies hf << kT, and therefore
B ≈2kT
l2
(11.24)
Let us consider a situation like that in Figure 11.7, where a black
surface fully surrounds a lossless antenna. The noise power received by the
antenna in a bandwidth of df is
P = 1
2 Aef dfEE
4p
B(u, f) G(u, f)

(11.25)
where Aef is the effective aperture area of the antenna, G(u, f) is the antenna
gain in a direction (u, f), and Gmax is the maximum antenna gain. The

286
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
factor of 1/2 is due to the fact that an antenna has a certain polarization
but the polarization of noise is random. Therefore, one-half of the noise
power is in a given polarization. By substituting (11.24) into (11.25) we
get
P = 1
2 Aef df 2kT
l2
4p
Gmax
= kT df
(11.26)
Thus, TA = T, and the received noise power is independent of the
antenna gain and is directly proportional to the temperature of the black
surface and to the bandwidth. If the temperature of the black surface depends
on the direction within the radiation pattern of the antenna, the received
noise power is calculated by integrating from (11.25).
The antenna receives noise from everywhere, including from space and
the atmosphere. For these it is possible to define an equivalent black surface
temperature, which depends on frequency and direction, as shown in Figure
11.8.
Figure 11.8 Noise temperature of the sky.

287
Radio System
At frequencies that do not penetrate the ionosphere, that is, in the HF
band and at lower frequencies, noise from electric discharge in the atmosphere
(lightning) is dominant. The amount depends on the season and day, location,
and frequency.
Noise from space dominates at frequencies from 20 MHz to 1 GHz.
The Milky Way produces RF noise, which is at its maximum in the plane
of the Milky Way and decreases as the direction goes away from this plane.
The Milky Way noise also decreases as frequency increases. At all frequencies
there is a 3K cosmic background radiation, which has its origin in the Big
Bang, that is, it is a remnant of the birth of the universe.
Thermal noise due to the atmospheric attenuation is the dominating
noise source above 1 GHz. It depends on the atmospheric humidity and
elevation angle. The atmosphere can be considered as an attenuator at a
physical temperature of about 270K.
Noise due to human activity may be considerable, especially near
densely populated areas. In the VHF band and at lower frequencies, noise
from the spark plugs of cars and power lines may be stronger than that from
nature.
11.3 Modulation and Demodulation of Signals
Information to be transmitted in a radio system, such as voice or music, is
first transformed to a low frequency, for example, an audio frequency, electric
signal. This baseband signal cannot be directly transmitted through a radio
channel, or at least that would be very inefficient. The signal is first fed into
a modulator, which modulates some property (amplitude, frequency, phase)
of a high-frequency carrier according to the baseband signal. The high-
frequency signal obtained is then transmitted by a transmitting antenna. A
receiving antenna receives the high-frequency signal and feeds it into a
receiver. In the receiver the signal is often downconverted to an intermediate
frequency and then demodulated, that is, the original baseband signal is
detected; for example, in the case of voice radio, the original voice signal is
recovered. In other words, with a modulator the information is attached
into a carrier, and with a demodulator it is detached.
There are a number of different modulation schemes, which can be
divided into analog and digital methods. Modulation is important not only
in communication (radio broadcasting, radio links, mobile phone systems)
but also in radar, radionavigation, and so on. Modulation is treated in many
communication textbooks, for example, [8–10].

288
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
11.3.1
Analog Modulation
A sinusoidal waveform can be presented as
A(t) = A0 cos (v0t + c0) = A0 cos (2pf0t + c0)
(11.27)
Information can be attached into this carrier by modulating one of its basic
properties according to the baseband signal. Modulation methods are:
1. Amplitude modulation (AM): Information is attached to the carrier
amplitude.
2. Frequency modulation (FM): Information is attached to the carrier
frequency.
3. Phase modulation (PM): Information is attached to the carrier phase.
AM is in principle the simplest method, but it has high requirements,
especially for the linearity of the transmitter. It is used in radio broadcasting
in the LF, MF, and HF bands, and in TV broadcasting. FM is used, for
example, in FM radio.
11.3.1.1
AM
Let us consider a signal that is amplitude modulated by a sinusoidal signal
at frequency fm :
A(t) = A0[1 + m cos (2pfm t)] cos 2pf0t
(11.28)
Thus, the amplitude varies between values of A0(1 −m) and A0(1 + m).
Factor m is the modulation index or modulation depth. The signal envelope
follows the modulating signal as shown in Figure 11.9(a), if m < 1. The
carrier frequency should be much higher than the modulating frequency.
Equation (11.28) can be presented as
A(t) = A0Fcos v0t + m
2 cos (v0 + vm )t + m
2 cos (v0 −vm )tG
(11.29)
The graphical interpretation of this equation is presented in Figure
11.9(b). A constant voltage phasor A0 corresponds to the carrier frequency.
Two voltage phasors with an amplitude of (m/2)A0 rotate in opposite

directions at an angular frequency of vm . The resultant of these three voltage
phasors gives the total voltage. The spectrum contains the components at
frequencies f0, f0 + fm , and f0 −fm , as shown in Figure 11.9(c).
If the modulating baseband signal is more complicated, it can be
considered as consisting of several sinusoidal components, which have a
given amplitude and phase. The modulating signal has a given spectrum
and each spectral component modulates the carrier independently.
Figure 11.10 presents the spectrum of an AM signal when the modulat-
ing signal is distributed over a given frequency range. The AM is using
lavishly both the power and frequency spectrum, because also the carrier
not containing information is transmitted and one sideband is only a mirror
image of the other. Transmitter power can be saved using DSB modulation, in
which the carrier is suppressed, that is, it is not transmitted. This modulation
scheme is also called double-sideband suppressed carrier (DSBSC) modulation.
The frequency spectrum is saved by removing the other sideband, which
leads to SSB modulation.
If the modulating signal contains frequency components near the zero
frequency, use of SSB modulation becomes complicated, because it is difficult
to separate the sidebands. Vestigial sideband (VSB) modulation is a compro-
mise between SSB and DSB modulations. In VSB, one sideband is trans-

mitted nearly in full, but only a small part of the other sideband is transmitted,
as illustrated in Figure 11.11. VSB can be realized more easily than SSB by
filtering from DSB.
11.3.1.2
Amplitude Modulators and Demodulators
A mixer can be used as an amplitude modulator. The modulating waveform
is fed into the IF port and the carrier into the LO port, and the modulated
signal is obtained from the RF (signal) port, as in Figure 11.12. In a double-
balanced mixer there is a good isolation between the LO and RF ports. In
that case the carrier is suppressed, and a DSB signal is obtained. The SSB
modulation can be realized using the circuit shown in Figure 11.13.

An AM signal can be demodulated by an envelope detector. The output
of an envelope detector follows the envelope of the input signal, as shown
in Figure 11.14. During one half forward cycle the capacitance C is charged
rapidly to the peak voltage value of the signal. The time constant RS C must
be much shorter than the cycle length 1/f0. In the reverse direction the
capacitor C discharges slowly, but it has to be able to follow the modulating
signal. This leads to a condition 1/f0 << RL C << 1/B, where B is the
bandwidth of the modulating signal.
In order to demodulate a DSB signal, the carrier must be generated
in the receiver. Both the frequency and phase must be correct. The DSB
demodulator shown in Figure 11.15 is called the Costas loop, and it resembles
the PLL. The input signal is mixed with orthogonal LO signals from a VCO.
The difference signals selected by the lowpass filters are proportional to
m(t) cosf and m(t) sinf, where f is the phase error of the LO. The third
mixer produces a signal that adjusts the VCO phase and frequency until
the output signal of the upper branch is at maximum and that of the lower
branch vanishes. Also, demodulation of an SSB signal requires generation

of the carrier. In order to aid this process, a pilot carrier may be transmitted
together with the sideband.
11.3.1.3
Quadrature AM (QAM)
QAM is a modulation method that combines two orthogonal DSB signals
into the same band. In the transmitter shown in Figure 11.16(a), the phase
difference between the two carriers is 90°. In the receiver there is also a 90°
phase difference between the two LO signals, and the original baseband
signals can be separated. QAM is used in TV broadcasting.
11.3.1.4
FM
The amplitude of a frequency-modulated signal is constant, and the instanta-
neous frequency varies according to the modulating signal. If the modulating
signal is sinusoidal, the instantaneous frequency is
f (t) = 1

where Df is the maximum frequency deviation. The equation for an FM
signal waveform is
A(t) = A0 cos f(t) = A0 cosF2pf0t + Df

sin (2pfm t)G
(11.31)
The spectrum of the FM signal contains, besides the carrier, an infinite
number of sidebands with a separation of fm . The required bandwidth is
wider than that in AM, but tolerance to noise and interference is better.
The amplitudes of the carrier and sidebands depend on the modulation
index m = Df /fm . The amplitude Asp of a sideband p relative to the amplitude
A0 of an unmodulated carrier is obtained from
Asp
A0 (m = 0) = Jp (Df /fm )
(11.32)
where Jp is the pth order Bessel function of the first kind. Figure 11.17
presents Bessel functions and Figure 11.18 shows an FM power spectrum
when the modulation index is m = 5.52. In this case the normalized amplitude
J0 of the carrier component is small.
If m is small—less than unity—there is in the spectrum only one
important sideband on both sides of the carrier, and As1/A0 ≈m/2. The

spectrum looks like the AM spectrum, but the phases of the sidebands are
different.
In theory the FM signal requires an infinite bandwidth. If we allow a
given maximum distortion, we can limit the bandwidth. According to Car-
son’s rule the required bandwidth is [10]
B ≈2Df + 2fm = 2Df (1 + 1/m) = 2fm (1 + m)
(11.33)
11.3.1.5
Frequency Modulators and Demodulators
FM can be realized with a VCO. The output frequency of some oscillators
can be controlled directly by changing the operation point of the nonlinear
element. In other VCOs the frequency is controlled by voltage tuning the
resonance frequency of the high-Q embedding circuit, which contains a
voltage-dependent element such as a varactor.
Figure 11.19 shows a Hartley oscillator. The input network contains
a varactor. The resonance frequency of the input resonator is
f =
1
2p√(L1 + L2)C(t)
(11.34)
Let us assume that C changes sinusoidally an amount of DC around C0 and
that the ratio DC /C0 is small. Then

which shows that we have a frequency modulator.
A frequency demodulator produces a voltage, the instantaneous value of
which is proportional to the instantaneous frequency of the signal. Networks
capable of doing so include, for example, a frequency discriminator, such
as the one shown in Figure 11.20, and a PLL, shown in Figure 11.21. In
the frequency discriminator there are two resonance circuits, each followed
by an envelope detector. One resonance circuit is tuned to a frequency above
the carrier frequency, the other one below. One detector produces a positive
output voltage, the other one a negative output voltage. The sum of these
voltages is linear in the vicinity of the carrier frequency, if the difference
between the resonance frequencies has a proper value. Usually there is an
amplitude limiter before the frequency discriminator to eliminate the effects
of signal amplitude variations. In the PLL, the control voltage of the VCO
contains the demodulated signal, if the frequency depends linearly on the
control voltage.
11.3.1.6
PM
PM is closely linked to FM because frequency f (t) is obtained from the
derivative of phase f(t) = v(t)t + c(t) and accordingly the phase is obtained
as an integral of the frequency:

A PM signal can be presented as
A(t) = A0 cos [2pf0t + c(t)]
(11.38)
= A0 [cos (2pf0t) cos c(t) −sin (2pf0t) sin c(t)]
If c(t) is small, cos c(t) ≈1 and sin c(t) ≈c(t), and (11.38) is simplified
into form
A(t) ≈A0 [cos (2pf0t) −sin (2pf0t) c(t)]
(11.39)
When the modulating signal is sinusoidal c(t) = 2pM cos (2pfm t),
we obtain
A(t) ≈A0 {cos (2pf0t) −pM sin [2p( f0 + fm )t] −pM sin [2p( f0 −fm )t]}
(11.40)
Equation (11.40) shows that the spectrum of a PM signal contains
frequencies f0, f0 + fm , and f0 −fm , as an AM signal does, but now the
phases of these components are different. Figure 11.22 represents a phasor
diagram of the PM signal.
11.3.2
Digital Modulation
An analog signal, such as a voice signal in the form of an audio-frequency
electric signal, can be transformed into a digital form by sampling it frequently
Figure 11.22 Phasor presentation of a PM signal.

298
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
enough. A digital signal may be binary, that is, containing only symbols 0
and 1, or m-ary, containing m different levels or states. The digital modulation
has many advantages over the analog modulation; the total use of spectrum
is effective, immunity to interference is good, frequency reuse is effective,
TDM is easily realized, and it allows the use of encryption for privacy.
The basic digital modulation methods are amplitude-shift keying (ASK),
frequency-shift keying (FSK), and phase-shift keying (PSK). Figure 11.23 shows
the waveforms of binary ASK, FSK, and PSK signals when a symbol chain
01101001 is transmitted. In ASK, the maximum amplitude corresponds to
symbol 1 and a zero amplitude corresponds to symbol 0. In FSK, the
symbols are presented by signals with frequencies f1 and f2. In PSK, signals
corresponding to symbols 1 and 0 have a phase difference of 180°. While
analog FM and PM signals closely resemble each other, FSK and PSK signals
are easily distinguishable.
In digital modulation, rapid waveform changes occur and thus the
power spectrum of a digitally modulated signal is broad. Figure 11.24 shows
the spectra of a binary baseband signal consisting of rectangular pulses and
a PSK signal modulated with it. The envelopes of the spectra have the shape
of a sinc function. The width between the first nulls of the PSK spectrum
is twice the bit rate 1/Tb , where Tb is the symbol period. In practice, the
signal is filtered and the spectrum is narrower.

299
Radio System
Figure 11.24 Spectra of a digital baseband signal and a PSK signal modulated with it.
In a binary modulation each symbol contains one bit of information.
In a modulation scheme having 2m different states each symbol contains m
bits. Then it is possible to transmit more information in a given bandwidth
or to use a narrower band to transmit a given signal having a given bit rate.
A four-state FSK (4FSK), four-state PSK (4PSK or QPSK), and eight-state PSK
(8PSK) are examples of modulation methods that save spectrum compared to
the binary methods. In a digital QAM, both the amplitude and phase get
several discrete values and the number of states may be 16, 64, or even
higher. Therefore QAM is used in high-capacity links requiring effective use
of the spectrum.
11.3.2.1
FSK
FSK can be realized by frequency modulating an oscillator or by switching
between two oscillators operating at two different frequencies. The receiver
may consist of two bandpass filters tuned for the frequencies f1 and f2, and
followed by envelope detectors. Decision between symbols 1 and 0 is made
based on the output voltage of each detector. Such an FSK demodulator,
presented in Figure 11.25, is said to be noncoherent.
A coherent demodulator, shown in Figure 11.26, provides a smaller
bit error rate (BER). In the receiver, the frequencies f1 and f2 are regenerated,
and their phases are synchronized with the incoming signal. The output

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

voltage of a phase detector (a double-balanced mixer) is proportional to the
phase difference of these two signals. After filtering, the amplitudes are
compared at the sampling time, and a decision is made between 1 and 0.
Minimum-shift keying (MSK) is a special case of FSK having the smallest
separation of frequencies f1 and f2 so that the correlation between the symbols
corresponding to 1 and 0 is zero. For MSK, the difference between f1 and
f2 is half of the bit rate.
11.3.2.2
PSK
PSK can be realized by switching between two oscillators that have the same
frequency but opposite phase, or with a double-balanced mixer, as shown
in Figure 11.27(a). The double-balanced mixer acts as a polarity-reversing
switch: When the sign of the voltage fed into the IF port changes, the phase
of the carrier output from the RF port changes 180°. Demodulation takes
Figure 11.27 PSK: (a) modulation and (b) demodulation with a double-balanced mixer.

301
Radio System
place in a reversed order, as in Figure 11.27(b). The carrier is regenerated
in the receiver and fed into the LO port. The double-balanced mixer acts
as a phase detector, and therefore the voltage from the IF port is either
positive (+V = ‘‘1’’) or negative (−V = ‘‘0’’).
It may be difficult to get a phase synchronism between the carrier and
the local oscillator during a period of only a few symbols. This difficulty
can be avoided, and it is not necessary to generate the carrier in the receiver,
if the phase of successive symbols is compared. Figure 11.28 shows such a
differential PSK (DPSK) demodulator, where the signal is compared in a
phase detector with the signal delayed by one symbol period Tb .
In quadriphase-shift keying (QPSK), the phase has four possible values,
and each symbol corresponds to two bits: phase p/4 corresponds to 10,
3p/4 corresponds to 00, 5p/4 corresponds to 01, and 7p/4 corresponds
to 11. A QPSK signal can be generated using the circuitry shown in Figure
11.29(a). The first bit of the pair is fed to the mixer of the upper branch
(I = in-phase), and the second bit of the pair to the mixer of the lower branch
(Q = quadrature phase). In the demodulator, shown in Figure 11.29(b),
the carrier is regenerated and the phase detectors provide output voltages
proportional to the bits.

11.3.2.3
QAM
The circuits in Figure 11.29 are also called an IQ-modulator and an IQ-
demodulator. They may be used to generate and detect digital QAM signals.
For example, a 16QAM signal may be produced as a sum of a four-level
I-signal and a four-level Q-signal. Figure 11.30 shows the constellation of
the 16QAM signal on the IQ-diagram. Each point of the constellation
presents one symbol now containing 4 bits. The distance of a point from
the origin is proportional to the amplitude of the modulated carrier, and
the angle between the positive I-axis and the direction of the point from
the origin is analogous to the phase of the signal.
11.3.2.4
Comparison of Digital Modulation Methods
An ideal modulation method uses the radio spectrum efficiently, is robust
against noise, interference, and fading, and can be realized with low-cost
and power-efficient circuitry. However, these requirements are partly contra-
dictory, and some tradeoffs have to be made to optimize the overall system
performance.
Binary ASK, FSK, and PSK signals can be generated with simple
circuits. Because ASK and FSK signals can be demodulated incoherently
with an envelope detector, these receivers can also be made simple and
inexpensive. Coherent detection of ASK and FSK requires more complex
circuits but provides a lower BER. PSK has the lowest BER but requires
generation of a synchronized carrier in the receiver.
Figure 11.31 shows how the bit error rate of a PSK system depends
on the S /N in an ideal AWGN channel and in a Rayleigh channel. In the
AWGN channel, white noise is the only nonideality. An S /N of only about
7 dB is needed to achieve a BER of 10−3. Coherent FSK needs 3 dB higher

S /N than PSK for a similar performance. In the AWGN channel BER
decreases exponentially as S /N increases. In the Rayleigh fading channel a
much higher average S /N is required for a given BER, because during deep
fades the error rate is large. ASK has a very poor performance in the Rayleigh
channel, because the threshold level between 0 and 1 depends on the signal
level; FSK and PSK have no such problem.
The bandwidth efficiency describes how well a modulation method
uses a limited bandwidth. The bandwidth efficiency of binary modulation
methods is slightly less than 1 bit in 1 second per 1 hertz bandwidth. As
noted before, increasing the number of modulation states lowers the symbol
rate, making the spectrum narrower. Thus multistate methods have better
bandwidth efficiencies than binary methods. However, for a given signal
power the states become closer to each other, making the system more
susceptible to noise and interference. Also, the equipment requirements of
a multistate method are demanding. For example, an imbalance of the
branches of an IQ-modulator and IQ-demodulator, and the phase noise of
an oscillator may easily increase the BER.
In case of multistate QAM, the amplitude variations are large. Therefore
transmitters and receivers have to operate linearly; otherwise, the signal will
distort and the occupied bandwidth will grow. Modulation methods such
as MSK, producing a constant-envelope waveform, allow the use of nonlinear
power amplifiers in transmitters. As discussed in Section 8.4, nonlinear
amplifiers are more efficient than linear amplifiers. Power efficiency is an
important factor in battery-powered transmitters.

304
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
In mobile communication, connections have to operate reliably in spite
of signal fading and Doppler shifts. Therefore, simple FSK and QPSK
modulations or their variations are used in mobile systems. In fixed LOS
radio links, good bandwidth efficiency is often required. Size and power
consumption are not as critical as they are in mobile units. Multistate QAM
can be used in LOS links, because in such links propagation problems are
less severe than in mobile systems.
11.4 Radio Link Budget
A radio link between two stations consists of a transmitter, transmission
path, and receiver, as presented in Figure 11.32. In a given link it is possible
to transmit several channels, which are separated using frequency division
multiplexing (FDM) or time division multiplexing (TDM). The received signal
power is
Pr = Gt GrS
l
4prD
2 1
Lp
Pt
(11.41)
where Lp is the loss of the transmission path in addition to the free space
loss, which equals (4pr/l)2. Loss Lp contains, among other things, the
tropospheric absorption and scattering loss as well as the effects of diffraction
and multipath propagation. Thus, it is possible that Lp is less than unity.
The system noise temperature of a receiving system is
TS = TA + TR
(11.42)
Then the equivalent noise power in the receiver input is
Pn = kTS BRF
(11.43)
Figure 11.32 Radio link.

305
Radio System
where BRF is the noise bandwidth of the receiver (see Figure 11.4). The
noise bandwidth is approximately equal to the bandwidth of the modulated
RF signal, which, on the other hand, depends on the baseband signal and
the modulation method used. For example, the bandwidth of an analog
baseband signal required for voice is 3 kHz, and that for a TV picture is
5 MHz.
The S /N in the input of the receiver is
S /N = Pr
Pn

Gt Pt l2
(4pr)2kBRF Lp

(11.44)
The S /N required for a good transmission depends on the application.
For example, a good analog TV picture requires S /N over 40 dB for the
video signal. For FM radio, S /N over 10 dB is satisfactory. Often in the
receiving end one can affect the ratio Gr /TS by properly selecting the antenna
and receiver. Equation (11.44) in various forms is often called the link-
budget formula.
Example 11.3
Let us consider a 12-GHz satellite TV link, where a geostationary satellite
is broadcasting to Scandinavia. The distance between the transmitter and
receiver is 40,000 km, and the satellite is seen at an elevation angle of about
20°. The transmitted power is 200W, and the transmitting satellite antenna
is a 1.5-m paraboloid with an aperture efficiency of 0.6. The required
availability of the system is 99.9%. What is the minimum ratio Gr /TS and
the maximum TR that will result in a good TV reception?
Solution
From long-term statistics it is known that the atmospheric attenuation on
the radio path of such a geostationary satellite is during 99.9% of time less
than or equal to 3 dB. In order to obtain the required video signal S /N of
40 dB, the received FM signal must have at least S /N = 14 dB. By expressing
the variables and constants of (11.44) in decibels, we get the link budget in
decibels. Now the system properties can be calculated by adding and sub-
tracting the decibel values. Properties of the system in decibels are given in
Table 11.1. When the values from Table 11.1 are substituted into (11.44)
and it is taken into account that k = −228.6 dBWK−1Hz−1, it is obtained
that Gr /TS = 2.4 dBK−1. If the receiving antenna is a paraboloidal reflector
with a diameter of 0.4m and an aperture efficiency of 0.6, its gain is 31.8
dB. Then TS may be at maximum 29.4 dBK or 870K. The antenna noise

temperature may be assumed to be at maximum 150K, and therefore the
receiver noise temperature may be at maximum 720K. At the edges of the
satellite antenna beam Gt is smaller than at the center of the beam, and
therefore a larger receiving antenna or a more sensitive receiver is needed.

Applications
Communication is the most important application of radio engineering.
Radio communication includes broadcasting, terrestrial and satellite radio
link systems, wireless local area networks, and mobile communication. Radio-
navigation, sensor applications such as locating by radar, remote sensing,
and radio astronomy are other important applications. Radio waves are used
also in many kinds of other sensors as in industrial sensors, for heating, and
in medical applications.
12.1 Broadcasting
Broadcasting means supplying the public with information and entertainment
by means of radio and television. Transmitting stations may be either terres-
trial or satellite borne. Frequency ranges that are reserved for broadcasting
in Region 1 (see Figure 1.2) are listed in Table 12.1. Analog radio transmis-
sions are amplitude modulated in the LF, MF, and HF ranges and frequency
modulated in the VHF range. Analog television transmissions use a VSB
modulation for picture signal and either an analog FM or a digital QPSK
for voice signal. Up to the HF range, waves can propagate long distances,
even around the globe, as surface waves or by reflecting from the ionosphere.
At VHF and higher frequencies, a nearly free LOS path between the transmit-
ter and receiver is needed.
Broadcasting is currently transitioning from analog transmissions to
digitally modulated transmissions. Digital transmission techniques have

several advantages: The radio spectrum is used more effectively than in analog
systems, the quality of the sound and picture is excellent even if the receiver
is moving, and many kinds of services can be attached to the signal.
Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) is a European standard for digital
radio transmissions. DAB uses a coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex
(COFDM), in which information is coded effectively to reduce the number
of errors. Bits are then distributed to several orthogonal carriers, which are
modulated using a differential QPSK. A signal with 1,536 carriers has a
bandwidth of about 1.5 MHz and can carry, for example, 6 stereo programs
or 18 speech programs. Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) is a standard for
broadcasting digital TV. It is also based on COFDM. The maximum number
of carriers is 6,817, and alternative modulation methods are QPSK, 16QAM,
and 64QAM. Four or five TV programs fit to an 8 MHz wide channel.
Because there are many carriers in COFDM, in each carrier the symbol rate
is low and the symbol duration long. This makes COFDM insensitive to
the adverse effects of multipath propagation and allows a use of single-
frequency networks where all synchronized transmitters use the same
frequency.
12.1.1
Broadcasting in Finland
In Finland, radio and television programs are delivered by the Finnish
Broadcasting Company, Yleisradio (YLE) and some commercial companies.
The network includes about 40 large transmission stations, 160 substations,
and link stations. There are also two MF stations and one HF station. DAB
test transmissions were started in 1994 and regular transmissions in the

309
Applications
VHF III range (174–240 MHz) began in 1998. Test transmissions of digital
TV were started in 1998 and regular transmissions in the UHF range began
in 2001.
The antenna masts for FM, DAB, and TV broadcasting are usually
100m to 300m high. Several antennas are placed on a mast so that the
antennas of the highest frequency range are placed on the top. The directional
pattern should usually be omnidirectional in the horizontal plane, whereas
in the vertical plane the beam should be narrow and shaped to give equal
field strength at different distances. The mast disturbs antennas, except the
one on the top. The antennas lower in the mast have to be made of several
elements. There are usually three or four elements in the horizontal plane
and several elements in the vertical plane. The vertical pattern is realized by
adjusting the phase and amplitude of the elements. The antenna elements
are often dipoles with a reflector. Slot antennas are also used at UHF.
Tetrodes and parallel-connected transistor amplifiers are used as the output
stages of the VHF transmitters. At UHF, klystrons work as output stages.
Because frequencies used for the FM, DAB, and TV need an almost
free LOS path, one transmitter can cover typically an area with a radius of
about 70 km. Therefore, about 40 stations are needed to cover all of Finland,
which has a land area of 338,000 km2 as well as scattered islands. Figure
12.1 shows the locations of FM stations and their coverage areas. At the
outer limit of the coverage area, the field strength is 0.5 mV/m (54 dBmV/m).
Reception is often possible at distances 20 km to 30 km greater than these
limits. The equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP), or the transmitted
power that would be needed in the case of an isotropic antenna to give the
same field strength as the actual antenna, is usually a few tens of kilowatts
for FM transmissions. Total real radiated power is much less than EIRP.
The polarization of FM signals is horizontal. In Lapland, circular polarization
is also used. DAB transmissions are vertically polarized.
EIRP of TV transmissions can be as high as 1,000 kW. The polarization
of TV signals is mainly horizontal; in the VHF I range vertical polarization
is also used. In addition to the main transmission stations, many substations
are needed to cover the whole country. A substation receives the signal from
a main station, converts the frequency of the signal, and transmits it to those
viewers who are unable to receive the signal from any main station. The
coverage of the TV-1 and TV-2 networks is more than 99.9% of the
population.
MF stations are in Helsinki (558 kHz) and Pori (963 kHz). The
antennas are short (compared to wavelength) monopoles and the output
stages are tetrodes. The HF station in Pori operates in several bands. The

antennas are horizontal dipole arrays. Reception of these HF signals is possible
even in Australia.
In addition to YLE, many local FM radio stations operate in Finland.
They use vertical polarization. In urban areas cable network companies
distribute TV programs received from satellites.
12.1.2
Broadcasting Satellites
A satellite can be used as a platform for a broadcasting station. One single
transmitter onboard a satellite can cover a whole country or continent.

311
Applications
Broadcasting and most other communication satellites are placed on geosyn-
chronous Earth orbit (GEO) at the height of 35,800 km above the equator.
At that height the orbiting time is equal to the rotation time of the Earth,
23 hours and 56 minutes. Then the satellites seem to be stationary and the
antennas on Earth can be fixed. Positions of the satellites have to be corrected
every now and then due to disturbances in the gravitational field. The amount
of the steering gas limits the lifetime of satellites to about 10 years.
Broadcasting satellite service (BSS) satellites transmit (downlink) at fre-
quencies from 11.7 GHz to 12.5 GHz into Europe. Fixed satellite service
(FSS) satellites transmitting in the bands 10.7 to 11.7 GHz and 12.5 to
12.75 GHz also send radio and TV programs. The band 11.7 to 12.5 GHz
is divided into 40 channels having a separation of 19.18 MHz. The width
of the channels is 27 MHz and they are interleaved in orthogonal polariza-
tions. BBS satellites send circularly polarized waves and FSS satellites linearly
polarized waves. Analog TV programs are frequency modulated. Several
digitally modulated TV programs fit in one 27-MHz band. The programs
are sent to broadcasting satellites (uplink) in the band 17.3 to 18.1 GHz
and to FSS satellites in the band 14.0 to 14.5 GHz. Due to crowding of
the 12-GHz band, 20-GHz (downlink) and 30-GHz (uplink) bands will be
introduced for the broadcasting service.
The microwave unit of a broadcasting satellite includes antennas and
transponders. A transponder consists of a low-noise receiver, mixers and
oscillators for frequency conversion, and power amplifiers. To improve relia-
bility, transponders often have parallel units; for example, a broken power
amplifier can be replaced with another unit. The power transmitted is typi-
cally about 100W so that an antenna having a diameter of 0.5m can be
used for reception. The beam of the satellite antenna is shaped according
to the service area. Figure 12.2 shows a typical footprint of a TV satellite.
In Finland, TV programs can be received from more than 20 satellites.
The maximum elevation angle of geostationary satellites is only 21° in the
most southern part of Finland. Because transmissions are usually directed
to Central Europe, especially in the northern Finland, a large receiving
antenna may be necessary.
Example 12.1
A geostationary satellite transmits with a power of Pt = 100W. The width
of the circular antenna beam is 3°. The beam can be assumed ideal so that
the normalized pattern level is 1 within the beam and 0 outside the beam.
Find the power density at a distance of r = 40,000 km. What is the power
received with a 0.5-m dish?

312
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Figure 12.2 Typical footprint of a GEO TV satellite beam directed at Central Europe.
Solution
The beam area is approximately VA = (p/4)(3p/180)2 = 2.15 × 10−3
steradians (see Section 9.1). The directivity is D = 4p/VA = 5,840. The
power density at a distance of r is S = (DPt )/(4pr2). Thus, S = (5,840 ×
100)/[4p × (4 × 107)2]W/m2 = 2.90 × 10−11W/m2, that is, −105.4 dBW/
m2. The atmosphere is assumed to be lossless. The effective area of a 0.5-m
antenna having an aperture efficiency of 0.6 is Aef = 0.6p × 0.252 m2 =
0.118 m2. The power received is Pr = Aef S = 3.42 × 10−12W, that is,
−114.7 dBW or −84.7 dBm.
12.2 Radio Link Systems
Radio link systems convey telephone and data traffic, TV and radio signals
to broadcasting stations, and so on. Stations may be terrestrial or space
borne. In this section, only fixed links are considered. Short communication
links allowing user mobility are the topic of Section 12.3.
12.2.1
Terrestrial Radio Links
A radio link system typically consists of terminal stations and repeater stations,
as shown in Figure 12.3. There are several frequency bands reserved for
TEAMFLY

Applications
Figure 12.3 A point-to-point radio link system (horizontal distances not in scale).
fixed terrestrial point-to-point radio links, including 7/8, 13, 15, 18, 23,
38, and 58 GHz. Bands below about 2 GHz are nowadays reserved for other
applications, such as mobile communication. Below 10 GHz the curved
surface of the Earth or the height of masts (60m to 80m) limits the length
of a hop to about 50 km. At frequencies higher than 10 GHz, the atmospheric
attenuation and especially the attenuation due to rain limits the hop length.
For example, at 23 GHz the maximum hop length is about 10 km and at
58 GHz (near the oxygen resonance) about 1 km.
The reliability of a radio link system is important. Between two stations,
the first Fresnel ellipsoid should be free from obstacles to avoid excessive
propagation loss. The curved surface of the Earth, the ground profile between
the stations, and the bending of rays have to be taken into account when
planning the heights of antennas. The statistical nature of the bending of
rays and rain attenuation must be considered in the link budget. Diversity
techniques can reduce the adverse effects of multipath propagation; space
diversity in which two antennas are at different heights is a common
technique.
Radio link antennas are usually parabolic reflectors. At millimeter-wave
range, low-profile array antennas are also used [1]. The half-power beamwidth
is typically 1° to 3°. Often antennas are protected against weather with a
radome. Repeater stations have transponders, which change the frequency
so that successive hops do not interfere with each other.
Radio links are either analog or digital. Analog links use FDM; digital
links use TDM. Standard capacities of digital links are 2, 8, 34, 140, and
155 Mbit/s, or multiples of these bit rates. A 2-Mbit/s signal is composed
of the content of 32 channels with 64 kbit/s. Low- and medium-capacity
(34 Mbit/s or less) long-haul links below 10 GHz often use the QPSK
modulation. In high-capacity links more complicated modulation methods
such as 16QAM and 64QAM are needed. The modulation method of short-
haul links above 10 GHz is often 4FSK.

314
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Point-to-multipoint radio links are used in wireless local loops (WLLs)
and local multipoint distribution systems (LMDSs), which offer a wireless
access to fixed telecommunication networks. Point-to-multipoint links are
often a good alternative to cable.
12.2.2
Satellite Radio Links
When the link stations on satellites are placed in geostationary orbit, three
satellites can cover the whole globe, excluding the polar regions.
The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTEL-
SAT) was founded in 1964. In 2000, its 144 member states approved the
privatization of INTELSAT. The geostationary satellites of INTELSAT are
placed over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Ocean. They convey voice,
data, Internet, and video traffic. The first geostationary communication
satellite was INTELSAT-1, Early Bird, which was placed in orbit in 1965.
Its capacity was 240 voice channels or one TV channel. Satellites from
fifth to ninth generation were in operation in 2002. Figure 12.4 illustrates
INTELSAT-6, which has a capacity of 36,000 voice channels and three TV
channels. It has 48 transponders having a total bandwidth of 3.3 GHz. The
antenna system includes 4- and 6-GHz zonal reflector antennas, 4- and
6-GHz horn antennas that cover the whole globe seen from the satellite,
two steerable 14/11-GHz (uplink/downlink) spot antennas, and two omnidi-
rectional antennas for telemetry and command signals. Figure 12.5 shows
the beams of an Atlantic satellite. The transmitting power of the 4-GHz
beam is 5W to 15W; the 11-GHz spot beams have transmitting powers of
20W and 40W. Due to the vast service area, the ground stations have large
30-m antennas.
Many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia,
Indonesia, and Japan, as well as regional organizations have their own commu-
nication satellites. European countries have formed the European Telecommu-
nications Satellite Organization (EUTELSAT). INTERSPUTNIK is a satellite
organization of the eastern European countries.
12.3 Wireless Local Area Networks
A wireless local area network (WLAN) is a data communication system that
can be used as an alternative to or as an extension of a wired LAN. A WLAN
can cover a building or campus. A wireless network covering a larger area

315
Applications

is called a wireless wide area network (WWAN) or a wireless metropolitan
area network (WMAN). A network covering only a small range is called a
wireless personal area network (WPAN).
Computers, printers, robots, and so on can be connected to a wireless
network by infrared or radio links. Most WLANs use radio waves and are
also called radio local area networks (RLANs). Radio waves can penetrate
most walls and floor surfaces, whereas these solid objects block infrared.
WLANs offer many advantages over traditional wired networks, for example,
user mobility, installation speed, and flexibility.
Many standards are available for WLANs. IEEE 802.11, Bluetooth,
and HomeRF operate in the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical
(ISM) band, 2,400 to 2,483.5 MHz. Bluetooth and HomeRF are more
like WPANs than WLANs. HiperLAN/2 is a high-performance standard
operating in the 5-GHz band that was developed by the European Telecommu-
nications Standards Institute (ETSI). DECT is a standard for cordless phones
that can also be used for WLANs.

316
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Figure 12.5 Coverage areas of an INTELSAT satellite over the Atlantic Ocean.
No license is required for low-power transmitters operating in the
2.45-GHz band. In addition to WLANs, several other applications, including
microwave ovens and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems, use this
band. To reduce interference between different users, spread spectrum tech-
niques can be used. There are two types of spread spectrum techniques:
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and frequency hopping spread spectrum
(FHSS) [2].
In DSSS, a digital bit stream representing the source data is multiplied
by a pseudorandom (PN) code with a bit or chip rate much higher than
that of the data. Thus this product has a much higher symbol rate than the
original data, causing the spectrum to spread. In the receiver, the original
data can be recovered by multiplying the received signal with the same PN
code. Only the signal with the same PN code despreads. To an unintended
receiver, a DSSS signal appears as wideband noise.
In FHSS, the transmitter changes carrier frequency in a pattern known
to the receiver. To an unintended receiver, an FHSS signal appears to be
short-duration impulse noise.

317
Applications
12.4 Mobile Communication
Mobile communication [3–5] has grown faster during the last decade than
any other application of radio engineering. Optical fibers and copper cables
cannot compete with freely propagating radio waves in this application. In
addition to cellular mobile systems, which are the main topic of this section,
a moving person can use satellite systems or pager systems for voice or data
transfer. The geostationary satellites of International Mobile (earlier Maritime)
Satellite Organization (INMARSAT) offer communication services for ships,
airplanes, and trucks. The operating frequencies between the satellites and
mobile users are 1.6/1.5 GHz (uplink/downlink). Several other systems based
on satellites on low Earth orbit (LEO) have been launched since 1998.
Compared to the GEO systems, many more satellites are needed in the LEO
systems, but shorter path lengths allow the use of handheld terminals.
In a cellular network, the coverage areas of the base stations form a
‘‘cellular’’ structure. To offer a good availability both in densely and sparsely
populated areas, cells of different sizes are needed. To avoid interference,
adjacent cells use different frequencies. The same frequencies can be reused
in cells, which are far enough from each other. Also, the power levels of
transmitters should be controlled to reduce interference. When a mobile
phone moves from one cell to another, the network has to take care of this
handover without interruption. (Cellular systems can be used also for rough
locating because the cell, in which the mobile unit locates, is known. The
accuracy may be enhanced by using measurements performed by more than
one base station.)
In the development of cellular mobile systems, three generations can
be distinguished: first generation analog systems, second generation digital
systems, and third generation wideband systems. In addition to voice transfer,
the second generation systems are usable also for low bit rate data services.
Third generation systems support wideband multimedia services. The follow-
ing introduces an example of each generation.
Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) represents the first generation. It was
developed by the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.
The NMT 450 network, operating in the 450-MHz band, was launched in
1981. In response to congestion, the upgraded NMT 900 network, which
had a larger capacity, started in 1986. NMT networks are still in operation
in many countries outside Scandinavia. Several other analog systems have
been in use around the world, including AMPS in the United States and
TACS in the United Kingdom. However, due to emerging digital systems,
many first generation networks have been closed down.

318
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
In NMT 450, the transmitting frequencies of mobile phones (receiving
frequencies of base stations) are 453 to 457.5 MHz, and the transmitting
frequencies of base stations (receiving frequencies of mobile phones) are 463
to 467.5 MHz. Thus, the duplex frequency is 10 MHz. In NMT 900, the
transmitting and receiving frequencies are 890 to 915 MHz and 935 to 960
MHz, and the duplex frequency is 45 MHz. A frequency channel is assigned
for each user in a cell, that is, the access method is the frequency division
multiple access (FDMA). The channel spacing is 25 kHz. Thus, NMT 450
has 180 channels and NMT 900 has 1,000 channels. The modulation method
is FM. The mobile telephone exchange (MTX) is a central component of the
NMT network. Each MTX is responsible for a group of base stations. The
MTX determines the frequencies and transmitting powers of mobile phones,
and takes care of the handovers from one base station to another. One base
station covers an area with a radius of 0.5 km to 20 km.
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) represents the second
generation. It is a digital cellular standard developed at first by CEPT and
later by ETSI. Originally, the acronym GSM came from the name of the
study group Groupe Spe´cial Mobile, which was formed to develop a common
European standard. The first GSM networks were launched in 1991. GSM
was rapidly accepted worldwide. Other second generation standards include
Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) operating in Japan, American standards IS-
95 and IS-136, and Trans-European Trunked Radio (TETRA), which is a
standard for private mobile networks.
GSM (or GSM 900) operates in the same frequency range as NMT
900 (i.e., 890–915 MHz and 935–960 MHz). The access method is a
combination of the FDMA and TDMA. There are 124 carrier frequencies,
which are spaced 200 kHz apart. Each frequency channel is divided into
eight time slots for different users. Mobile phones and base stations transmit
short bursts of data. The bit rate during a burst is 270.833 kbit/s. The length
of a burst is 0.577 ms or 156.25 bit periods. Consequently, a TDMA frame
of eight bursts lasts 4.615 ms. Effects of multipath fading are alleviated by
using slow frequency hopping, that is, the carrier frequency changes from
one frame to another. The modulation method of the carrier is a Gaussian
minimum shift keying (GMSK). To reduce the number of bit errors, channel
coding and interleaving is used. In channel coding, redundancy bits are
added in order to detect and correct errors. Interleaving disperses a series of
consecutive bit errors to several blocks, making error correction easier.
Figure 12.6 shows the architecture of a GSM network. The mobile
station is connected to a base transceiver station (BTS) via a radio link. The
base station controller (BSC) controls a group of BTSs and manages their

radio resources. The mobile-services switching center (MSC) performs the
switching functions of the network and provides a connection to other
networks. MSCs also take care of the registration, authentication, and location
updating of subscribers. Received power levels are continuously monitored.
MSCs and BSCs make decisions about handovers using these received signal
strengths. Transmitter power levels are also controlled according to the signal
strengths; the maximum transmitter power of a handheld phone is 2W, and
thus the maximum average power is (2W)/8 = 0.25W.
Digital Cellular System, DCS 1800 or GSM 1800, is an upgraded
version of GSM 900. Mobile units transmit at frequencies from 1,710 to
1,785 MHz and base stations at 1,805 to 1,880 MHz. The number of
frequency channels is 374. GSM 1800 is especially useful in metropolitan
areas where the cells are small.
GSM supports data transfer at the speed of 9.6 or 14.4 kbit/s. An
extension to the GSM standard, High-Speed Circuit Switched Data (HSCSD),
permits using three time slots per frame, allowing a data speed of 43.2 kbit/s.
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Enhanced Data Rates for GSM
Evolution (EDGE) are further extensions of GSM, which may operate in
the existing GSM networks. GPRS is better suited for data transfer than
GSM or HSCSD, which are circuit-switched systems. In GPRS, data is
transmitted in packets and more than one timeslot per TDMA frame may
be allocated for a user. In EDGE, the eight-level phase modulation, 8PSK,
is used. One 8PSK symbol contains 3 bits of data, allowing a higher transfer
rate than the GMSK modulation of GSM.
The standardization work for the third generation systems is ongoing.
Within ITU these systems are called International Mobile Telecommunications

320
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
2000 (IMT-2000), whereas Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) is used in Europe [6]. Third generation systems will operate in the
2-GHz band and will provide data rates up to 2 Mbit/s. A wideband code
division multiple access (WCDMA) will be one of the access methods of the
third generation systems.
12.5 Radionavigation
Radionavigation means determining position, speed, or some other quantity
using radio waves for navigation, such as for steering a vehicle. Radionaviga-
tion is used in aviation, in shipping, and on land [7]. Radionavigation systems
can be divided into two groups:
1. Base station systems. The positions of stations on the ground or on
satellites are known. The position of a vehicle can be determined
by measuring distances, differences in distances (hyperbolic systems),
or directions to the base stations.
2. Autonomous systems. Doppler navigation is an example of autono-
mous navigation: Antenna beams are directed from an airplane to
ground. The speed of the plane is obtained from the measured
Doppler shifts. The position of the plane is calculated by integrating
the velocity vector.
Hyperbolic systems, satellite systems, and systems used in aviation are
treated in this section. In addition to these systems, radio beacons, broadcast-
ing stations, and base stations of mobile phone systems are used for navigation.
By taking a bearing to two beacons, the position of the vehicle can be solved.
The null in the radiation pattern of a loop or Adcock antenna can be used
for bearing.
12.5.1
Hyperbolic Radionavigation Systems
In a hyperbolic system, differences in distances to the base stations are
measured. The difference in distance for a pair of stations corresponds on
a plane surface to a hyperbola, on which the vehicle is located. The position
is obtained from the intersection of two such hyperbolas.
Both pulsed and continuous signals are usable: The difference of the
arrival times of pulses, Dt, or the phase difference of continuous waves, Df,
from two stations determine a hyperbola. The transmitted signals from

321
Applications
different stations have to be time- or phase-synchronized to each other. On
the line between two stations, a time difference of 1 ms corresponds to 150
km and a phase difference of 360° corresponds to l/2.
In the example in Figure 12.7, stations A, B, and C transmit pulses
simultaneously. (In practice, this would cause interference.) The pulse from
station A arrives at the receiver on the vehicle 2 ms earlier than the pulse
from station B and 1 ms earlier than the pulse from station C.
Decca, Loran-C, and Omega are hyperbolic radionavigation systems
used in shipping and aviation. Only Loran-C is in use at present. Decca
was closed down in 2000 after having been in operation more than 50 years.
Decca consisted of chains having fours stations, which transmitted in the
100-kHz range. Navigation was based on the measurement of phase differ-
ences. The operating range of a Decca chain was a few hundred kilometers
and it had an accuracy range of 5m to 50m. The worldwide Omega system
was closed down in 1997. It consisted of eight stations, which operated at
about 10 kHz. The determination of position was based on the measurement
of phase differences, and it had an accuracy range of from 2 to 4 km.
Loran-C (for long-range navigation) is a hyperbolic system that is based
on the differences in arrival times of pulses transmitted by the base stations.
Figure 12.7 Hyperbolic navigation system.

322
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Loran-C consists of chains, which have one master station and two to five
slave stations. The stations are located about 1,000 km apart. There are
about 30 chains around the world.
The carrier frequency of Loran-C pulses is 100 kHz. Transmitted pulse
power is typically 400 kW. The shape of the pulse is well defined, as shown
in Figure 12.8. Both the envelope of the pulses and the phase of the carrier
are used to determine time differences. The transmission sequence of a chain
starts with nine pulses from the master station. The pulses are 1 ms apart,
except the ninth pulse, which is 2 ms apart from the eighth pulse. Then,
after a given delay, each slave station transmits eight pulses. Because of the
delay, signals are always received from the stations in the same order in
spite of the location of the receiver. The length of the pulse pattern is 30
to 100 ms. Figure 12.8 shows an example of a received pulse pattern. Adjacent
chains have different repetition frequencies, which helps in the identification
of the chain.
The signals of Loran-C system propagate to a distance of about 2,000
km as surface waves. Reflections from the ionosphere come at least 30 ms
later than the surface waves and do not disturb if only the beginning of the
pulse is used for timing. Navigation accuracy is about 250m at a distance

Helsinki.

Applications
of 1,000 km. Reflections from the ionosphere can be used for navigation at
distances greater than 2,000 km but with inferior accuracy.
12.5.2
Satellite Navigation Systems
A global navigation system is realized best by positioning the stations on
satellites. Satellite navigation has several advantages:
• Vast areas can be covered with a few satellites, which makes the
maintenance of the system economical.
• Navigation accuracy is better because the radio frequency used can
be higher than in terrestrial systems.
• Three-dimensional navigation is possible.
In addition to navigation, satellite systems are used for locating, survey-
ing, and transferring time signals.
Transit and GPS are briefly described below. Many other satellite-
based navigation and location determination systems are in operation. The
Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) and Tsikada are the Russian
counterparts of GPS and Transit. Cospas-Sarsat is a worldwide rescue system,
which can locate rescue transmitters.
Transit was the first satellite navigation system and was operating
between 1964 and 1997. It was initially maintained by the U.S. Navy. Six
satellites in polar orbits at the altitude of 1,075 km transmitted at frequencies
of about 150 and 400 MHz. The use of two frequencies made it possible
to correct the effect of the ionospheric delay. Transit navigation was based
on the Doppler effect. The position of a receiver was determined from the
measured Doppler shift, fD , as illustrated in Figure 12.9. The longitude was
obtained from the rate of change in fD , and the latitude from time of passage
when fD = 0. The location accuracy for an immobile vehicle was 50m.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) is maintained by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Defense. Full operational status was reached in 1995. GPS includes
24 satellites, of which three are spare. Satellites are placed on six orbits at
the height of about 20,000 km (orbiting time: 12 hours), as shown in Figure
12.10. At least five satellites are high enough above the horizon for any
location on the globe.
GPS satellites transmit at two carrier frequencies, L1 = 1,575.42 MHz
and L2 = 1,227.60 MHz. Using both frequencies, the ionospheric delay can
be taken into account. The signal contains information about the orbit and

atomic clocks.
GPS is based on the measurement of the distances between the user
and satellites. The distance is determined from the time of propagation from

325
Applications
the satellite to the receiver. The coordinates of the receiver can be calculated
from distances to three satellites and from the coordinates of the satellites.
The clock error of the receiver can be eliminated by using four satellites.
The GPS signal is PSK modulated with two pseudorandom codes,
precise, or P, code and coarse/acquisition, or C/A, code, which have rates
of 10.23 and 1.023 Mbit/s, respectively. The received code is compared to
a similar code generated in the receiver, as illustrated in Figure 12.11. The
delay of the generated code is adjusted until the correlation is at maximum.
The transit time from the satellite to the receiver is the sum of the delay
and a multiple of the length of the code. Figure 12.11 also shows the
autocorrelation function of a pseudorandom code. Correlation is near zero
if the phase difference is more than one bit. An error of one-hundredth bit
period in the peak of the autocorrelation function corresponds to errors of
30 cm and 3m in the distance to the satellite with P and C/A codes,
respectively.
The uncertainties of the clocks on the satellites and in the receiver,
the uncertainties in orbital parameters, the propagation delays in the atmo-
sphere and receiver, and multipath propagation are sources of error that
impair navigation accuracy. The absolute accuracy of position is typically
some tens of meters. The relative accuracy, that is, the difference in position
for two receivers, is better, about 2m to 5m, because most of the errors are
the same for both receivers. This is utilized in the differential GPS (DGPS),
in which fixed stations monitor their positions and send correction signals
to nearby GPS receivers. In surveying, the accuracy can be further improved
by using the phase of the carrier and a long measurement time. The accuracy
may be as good as about 1 cm.
Figure 12.11 Determination of the transit time from a satellite to the receiver, and the
autocorrelation function of a pseudorandom code. The code length is n bits.

326
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The European Union has a definite plan to deploy a new satellite
navigation system called Galileo starting in 2005. The Galileo system should
be ready for full operation in 2008 when all 30 satellites are orbiting at the
altitude of 24,000 km.
12.5.3
Navigation Systems in Aviation
In addition to hyperbolic and satellite navigation systems, many other radio-
navigation systems are in use in aviation.
VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) is based on omnidirectional bea-
cons operating in the range of 108 to 118 MHz. The carrier is amplitude
or frequency modulated at 30 Hz so that the phase of modulation depends
on the azimuth angle. Two subcarriers 9,960 Hz apart from the carrier are
frequency modulated at 30 Hz and are angle-independent reference signals.
The receiver on an aircraft measures the phase difference of the 30-Hz signals
and thus reveals the direction of the beacon.
Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) operates in the range of 962 to
1,213 MHz and is usually located with a VOR beacon. Its frequency can
be ‘‘paired’’ with VOR or ILS. The distance between an interrogator on an
aircraft and a transponder at a ground station is obtained from the time it
takes for the signal to propagate from the aircraft to the ground station and
back, as shown in Figure 12.12. The interrogator sends a pair of pulses. The
transponder delays its response by 50 ms and changes the frequency
by 63 MHz.
The Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Microwave Landing System
(MLS) are landing systems that give guidance for airplanes approaching a
runway. ILS was introduced in the 1940s. It consists of three radio systems,
as indicated in Figure 12.13: localizer, glide slope, and marker signals. The
localizer signal (108–112 MHz) provides lateral guidance. The right side of
the antenna pattern, as seen by an approaching aircraft, is modulated at
Figure 12.12 Operating principle of DME.

150 Hz, and the left side at 90 Hz. On the correct track, the 90 and 150
Hz signals are of equal intensity. The glide slope signal (329–335 MHz)
provides vertical guidance. The upper part of the pattern is modulated at
90 Hz and the lower part at 150 Hz. The intensities of the modulating
signals are equal in the optimum glide angle, which is typically 2.5° to 3°.
Marker beacons at 75 MHz provide information on the distance from the
runway.
MLS is a precision landing system that will replace ILS. MLS allows
different glide angles and curved approach paths, and has many other advan-
tages over ILS. Navigation is based on five signals: (1) the scanning azimuth
signal, ±40° or ±60°; (2) the scanning elevation signal, maximum scan 0.9°
to 30°; (3) the back-azimuth signal for missed approaches; (4) precision DME
(DME/P); and (5) data signals. With the exception of DME/P, all MLS
signals are transmitted on a single frequency through time-sharing. The
operating range, 5,031 to 5,091 MHz, contains 200 channels. Figure 12.14
shows how the azimuth angle of an approaching plane is measured. The
narrow beam produced by a phased antenna array sweeps at a fixed scan
rate, and the receiver on the plane measures the time interval between sweeps,

Dt. The position of the plane is obtained from the measured azimuth,
elevation, and distance.
Traffic-alert and collision-avoidance systems (TCAS) are based on tran-
sponders, which warn pilots about potential midair collisions. There are
three versions of the system: TCAS I indicates potential threats, TCAS II
gives simple advice such as ‘‘climb’’ or ‘‘descend,’’ and TCAS III gives more
detailed advice.
12.6 Radar
The technique to detect and locate reflecting objects—targets—by using
radio waves was first called radio detection and ranging [8]. Eventually, this
expression was reduced to the acronym radar. The serious development of
radar began in the mid-1930s and progressed rapidly during World War II.
The applications of radar are numerous: Surveillance radar is used in
air-traffic control; tracking radar continuously tracks aircraft or missiles;
weather radar reveals rain clouds and their movements; police speedometers
are used in traffic control; collision-avoidance radar may be installed on all
kinds of vehicles; surface-penetrating radar can locate buried objects or
interfaces beneath the Earth’s surface or within visually opaque objects; and
so on. Radar is applied in navigation (Section 12.5), in remote sensing of
the environment (Section 12.7), in radio astronomy (Section 12.8), and in
various sensors (Section 12.9).
Radar is either monostatic or bistatic. In monostatic radar the same
antenna transmits and receives; in bistatic radar these are at separate locations.
According to the waveforms used, radar can be divided into pulse radar,
Doppler radar, and frequency-modulated radar. The basic principles of these
different types of radar and the surveillance and tracking radar are treated
in this section.
12.6.1
Pulse Radar
Pulse radar transmits a repetitive train of short-duration pulses, which reflect
from the target back to the receiver. The distance to the target can be
calculated from the speed of radio waves in the medium, which in most
cases is with a good approximation of the speed of light in vacuum and the
time Dt it takes for the pulses to propagate back and forth:
R = cDt
2
(12.1)

329
Applications
The resolution of the pulse radar is
DR = ct
2
(12.2)
where t is the length of the pulse. Typically t is in microseconds. Echoes
from two objects, which are in radial direction closer than DR to each other,
merge in the receiver. To avoid ambiguities in the measurement of distance,
the pulse repetition rate, fp = 1/T, should be so low that all the echoes
produced by a given pulse have traveled back to the receiver before the next
pulse is sent.
Figure 12.15 shows the block diagram of a monostatic pulse radar (the
transmitter and receiver of a bistatic radar are located at different sites). The
transmitter is often based on a magnetron oscillator, whose peak power may
be one megawatt. Usually, the same antenna is used both in transmitting
and receiving. A duplexer isolates the sensitive receiver during the high-
power pulses transmitted and directs the echoes to the receiver. The direction
of the target is obtained from the direction of the narrow main beam of
the antenna. The antenna may be a reflector antenna, which is rotated
mechanically, or a phased array, whose main beam direction is scanned
electronically. The output voltage of the superheterodyne receiver is compared
Figure 12.15 Block diagram of pulse radar.

330
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
to an adjustable threshold voltage, VT . An output voltage higher than VT
is interpreted as a target. A too-low VT increases the probability that noise
is interpreted as a target; a too-high VT reduces the probability of observing
a weak target. The display may be a plan position indicator (PPI), in which
the echo signal modulates an electron beam rotating synchronously with the
antenna. Thus, the display shows the surroundings of the radar in polar
form.
The power density produced by the radar at a distance of R is
S = Pt G
4pR2
(12.3)
where Pt is the transmitted power (during a pulse) and G is the gain of the
antenna. The radar cross section of a target, s, is the fictional area intercepting
that amount of power that, when scattered equally in all directions, produces
an echo at the radar equal to that from the target. In other words,
s = power reflected towards radar/unit solid angle
incident power density/4p
The radar cross section of a target depends on the frequency and
polarization, as well as on the direction of observation. In case of monostatic
radar, the power density produced by the target at the radar is (same R in
both directions)
Sr = Pt G
4pR2 ×
s
4pR2
(12.4)
and the power received is (same G both in transmitting and receiving mode)
Pr = Sr Aef = Sr
Gl2
4p = Pt G2l2s
(4p)3R4
(12.5)
If Pr,min is the minimum received power, which is reliably interpreted as a
target, the maximum operating range of the radar is
Rmax =F
Pt G2l2s
Pr,min (4p)3G
1/4
(12.6)

331
Applications
This equation is called the radar equation. Because of the two-way propaga-
tion loss, doubling the transmitted power increases the maximum range only
by 19%.
The minimum power Pr,min or the sensitivity of the radar is
Pr,min = kTs Bn
S
N
(12.7)
where TS is the system noise temperature, Bn is the noise bandwidth of the
receiver, and S /N is the signal-to-noise ratio corresponding to the threshold
voltage. Usually the IF filter determines the noise bandwidth, which should
be about 1/t. If the bandwidth were narrower, the received pulses would
distort. If it were broader, the sensitivity would be reduced.
The radar equation (12.6) is based on many idealizations. The atmo-
spheric attenuation reduces the maximum operating range, especially at high
microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. The radar cross section of the
target often changes rapidly, fluctuates, and thus has a statistical nature. Also
noise and other interfering signals are statistical. Therefore, instead of exact
figures, only probabilities can be estimated for a given radar measuring a
target of a given type. The maximum operating range for radar may be
calculated by assuming a certain probability of detection and a certain proba-
bility of false alarms.
The performance of pulse radar may be improved considerably by pulse
integration, pulse compression, and moving target indication. Even if the
beam of the antenna is scanning rapidly, several pulses are received from a
target during each scan. The sensitivity of the radar can be improved by
summing these pulses. The summing, or integration, is performed either
coherently at IF or noncoherently after detection. An ideal coherent integra-
tion of n pulses having equal amplitudes improves the S /N by a factor of
n. A noncoherent integration is not as effective as the coherent integration
but it is much simpler to realize.
In pulse compression, the transmitted pulse is long and its carrier
frequency or phase is modulated. In the receiver, the pulse is then compressed
to a short impulse, for example, by using a filter whose delay is frequency
dependent. Pulse compression combines the advantages of high-energy pulses
and short pulses, that is, a large operating range and a good resolution.
The echoes originating from fixed objects in the radar’s surroundings,
clutter, may mask the detection of more interesting weak targets. The effect
of clutter may be reduced by the use of a moving target indicator (MTI).
Figure 12.16 shows the principle of a simple MTI in which echoes of

Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

successive pulses are compared. For a fixed target, the echoes are similar,
giving no output. Moving targets can be detected because the distance of a
moving target changes from one pulse to the next and there is a phase
difference between successive received pulses. However, if the distance of a
target changes by a multiple of the wavelength during the delay 1/fp , the
phase difference is zero and the target cannot be detected. Such blind speeds
can be avoided by using two or more different pulse repetition frequencies.
The delay circuit may be an analog filter or a digital shift register.
Example 12.2
The properties of an air surveillance radar are: transmitted power Pt = 250
kW, antenna gain G = 40 dB, pulse length t = 1 ms, system noise temperature
TS = 500K, wavelength l = 0.1m. The radar cross section of the target is
s = 1 m2 and the S /N required for detection is S /N = 13 dB = 20. Find
the maximum operating range.
Solution
The noise bandwidth is about 1/t = 1 MHz. From (12.7) we obtain the
minimum power Pr,min = 1.38 × 10−23 × 500 × 106 × 20W = 1.38 ×
10−13W. Substituting this in (12.6) gives Rmax = [250 × 103 × 108 × 0.12
× 1/(1.38 × 10−13 × 43p3)]1/4m = 174 km.
12.6.2
Doppler Radar
The block diagram of a simple Doppler radar, called continuous wave (CW)
radar, is shown in Figure 12.17. The radar transmits a continuous and
unmodulated wave at a frequency of f0. If the radial velocity of the target
is vr , the frequency of the reflected wave is f0 + fD where the Doppler
frequency is
fD = ± 2vr
l
(12.8)

Applications
Figure 12.17 Simple Doppler radar.
Doppler frequency is positive for an approaching target and negative
for a receding target. Mixing the transmitted and received signals produces
an output frequency of | fD |. Thus, the sign of fD is lost in mixing. The
filter removes the dc component due to fixed targets. To obtain a good
resolution in velocity measurement, the signal should be produced with an
oscillator having low phase noise.
Figure 12.18 shows a more sophisticated Doppler radar. It has two
antennas, one for transmission and one for reception, which reduces the
leakage of power from the transmitter to the receiver. The local oscillator

334
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
frequency is shifted from f0 to f0 + fIF . Now the output frequency fIF −
fD reveals the sign of Doppler frequency. The higher output frequency also
reduces the effect of low-frequency noise. The use of a filter bank consisting
of narrow-band filters improves the signal-to-noise ratio compared to the
simple radar of Figure 12.17.
Doppler radar is used for many kinds of velocity measurements: in
traffic control, to measure ascent speeds of aircrafts, and so on. They are
also used to detect intruders.
Doppler radar is not able to measure the distance to a target. However,
pulsed Doppler radar may measure both the distance and the radial velocity.
The pulse repetition rate is so high that the velocity of the target can be
extracted from the phase shifts of the pulses, but at the expense of ambiguity
in distance measurement.
12.6.3
Frequency-Modulated Radar
Conventional pulse radar is not suitable for measuring short distances because
for that the pulses should be extremely short. FM radar, or FM-CW radar,
is better suited for such measurements. FM-CW radar can be used as airplane
altimeters, to measure liquid surface heights in containers and the thickness
of different layers, and so on.
FM-CW radar transmits a continuous wave whose frequency is modu-
lated. The distances of reflecting objects are obtained from the frequency
difference, fd , of the transmitted and received signals. If the frequency is
modulated with a triangular wave, as shown in Figure 12.19, the absolute
value of the frequency difference is, except near the turning points, directly
proportional to the distance R :
fd =
2R|df /dt|
c
= 4RDffm
c
(12.9)
Figure 12.19 Block diagram and frequency waveforms of FM-CW radar.

335
Applications
where Df is the maximum change of the transmitted frequency and fm is
the modulation frequency. Equation (12.9) is valid only if the reflecting
object is stationary. Other modulating waveforms can also be used.
Example 12.3
The frequency of FM-CW radar, as shown in Figure 12.19, is modulated
with a triangular wave between 3.0 and 3.2 GHz. The modulation frequency
is 50 Hz. The output frequency is 1,200 Hz. Find the distance of the target.
Solution
Now Df = 3.2 GHz −3.0 GHz = 200 MHz, fm = 50 Hz, and fd = 1,200
Hz. From (12.9) we solve R = cfd /(4Dffm ) = 3 × 108 × 1,200/(4 × 200 ×
106 × 50)m = 9m. This distance is too short to be measured with pulse
radar.
12.6.4
Surveillance and Tracking Radars
Surveillance radar covers for example an air space surrounding an airport,
whereas tracking radar follows a target continuously. Surveillance and
tracking radar are usually pulse radar, and they differ from each other mainly
by their beam shape and scanning techniques.
The beam of surveillance radar is usually scanned in the horizontal
plane mechanically by rotating the antenna or electronically by using a
phased array. In the circular scanning shown in Figure 12.20(a) the beam
is fan-shaped, that is, narrow in the horizontal plane and broader in the
vertical plane. If the beam is cosec2-shaped in the vertical plane, a target
flying at a constant height produces an echo having a constant strength. A
simple conical scanning reveals only the azimuth angle of the target. Stepped
circular scanning [Figure 12.20(b)], and nodding circular scanning [Figure
12.20(c)], also give information on the elevation angle. Now the antenna
may have a symmetrical pencil beam.
Tracking radar is used to track the paths of airplanes, missiles, rockets,
and so on. Often tracking radar has a surveillance mode in which the radar
seeks targets for tracking. As the target moves, the direction of the antenna
has to be changed. In a conical scanning [Figure 12.20(d)], the axis of the
beam makes a cone. If the target is not on the axis of the cone, the amplitude
of the received pulses is modulated at the scanning rate. An error signal is
generated from this modulation to correct the direction of the cone axis.
Monopulse radar has four beams, as shown in Figure 12.20(e). Now
an error signal can be derived from a single pulse by comparing the amplitudes

from all four beams. Therefore, the fluctuation of the radar cross section
causing amplitude modulation does not impair the tracking accuracy. A
multibeam antenna can be realized by placing an array of feed antennas on
the focal plane of a reflector antenna.
12.7 Remote Sensing
Remote sensing means measuring or observing of atmosphere or surface of
the Earth by using electromagnetic waves without any physical contact
with the object and the analysis of these measurements. Radio astronomy
investigating other celestial bodies is a separate field and is treated in Section
12.8.
Aerial photography has been carried out for more than one hundred
years. Optical pictures taken from satellites have good resolution, at its best
about 1m. Radio waves have been used for remote sensing since the 1960s.
Radio waves have some advantages over visible light and infrared waves:
Darkness and clouds do not prevent measurements; radio waves penetrate
deeper in the vegetation and soil; and higher radio frequencies give informa-
tion on the upper layers and lower radio frequencies on the deeper layers.
However, the resolution of radio images is poorer than that of optical images.
Remote-sensing methods may be divided into passive and active
methods. Passive remote sensing is called radiometry, in which thermal
emission from the ground or atmosphere is measured with a sensitive receiver,

337
Applications
a radiometer. In active remote sensing, radar techniques are used: objects
are at first illuminated with the radar signal and then the reflected or scattered
signal is measured.
Remote sensing using radio waves may reveal many properties of our
environment [9–11]. Subjects that can be studied are numerous: ground
profile, vegetation, moisture content of soil, water content of snow, oil
leakages from ships, wind speed and direction, temperature and water vapor
profiles of atmosphere, abundance of ozone and other molecules in the upper
atmosphere, and so on.
Measurements can be carried out with instruments on the ground, on
aircraft, or on satellites. The American Seasat (launched in 1978), Nimbus-7
(1978), and TOPEX/Poseidon (1992), the Canadian Radarsat (1995), and
the European ERS-1 (1991), ERS-2 (1995), and ENVISAT (2002) are
examples of remote-sensing satellites carrying radiometers or radar onboard.
Several sounders for the measurement of the temperature profile and the
contents profiles of water vapor, ozone, and many pollutants are planned.
12.7.1
Radiometry
All matter emits electromagnetic energy. A body in a thermodynamic equilib-
rium emits energy at the same rate as it absorbs energy. A blackbody is an
object that absorbs all the energy that is incident on it, that is, the reflection
coefficient is zero at all frequencies. If an antenna is pointing toward the
surface of a blackbody at a temperature of T, the power coupled to the
antenna in a bandwidth of B is (see Section 11.2.2)
P = kTB
(12.10)
Most natural bodies are ‘‘gray.’’ The power coupled to the antenna
from a gray body is obtained by replacing the physical temperature T in
(12.10) by the brightness temperature
TB = eT
(12.11)
where e is the emissivity, or the power transmission coefficient, of the surface.
The emissivity is related to the voltage (electric field) reflection coefficient
of the surface as
e = 1 −| r|2
(12.12)
The emissivity depends on the electrical properties of the object (er, s),
on the roughness of its surface, and on the angle, frequency, and polarization

338
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
of the measurement. For a blackbody the emissivity is 1, for an ideal conductor
it is 0, and for other objects it is between these limits. Thus, TB is always
smaller than or equal to the physical temperature. If the temperature of the
object is not constant as a function of depth from the surface, TB depends
on the temperature distribution within a few skin depths. Radiometry is
based on the fact that different objects have different temperatures and
emissivities, and thus the measured brightness temperature may give a lot
of information on the object.
Figure 12.21 shows a radiometer measuring the brightness temperature
of the ground surface. In an ideal case, the noise signal is not attenuated by
the atmosphere (L = 0 dB), the brightness temperature of the sky is Ti = 0K,
and the thermal noise from the ground having a brightness temperature of
TB fills the whole antenna beam and is independent of direction. Then the
antenna noise temperature is TA = TB . In practice, the atmosphere attenuates
the signal and itself produces thermal noise, the surface reflects noise from
the sky (Ti ≠0K), and a part of the antenna pattern is not pointing toward
the surface. The noise coming to the antenna can be characterized by a
direction-dependent antenna noise temperature TAP (u, f). The measured
antenna noise temperature is obtained by weighing TAP (u, f) by the normal-
ized radiation pattern Pn (u, f):
TA =EE
4p
TAP (u, f)Pn (u, f) d V
EE
4p
Pn (u, f) d V
(12.13)
Figure 12.21 Radiometer measuring the brightness temperature of ground.

339
Applications
The brightness temperature TB can be best figured out from the mea-
sured TA , if Ti and L are small. This situation realizes well in the frequency
range of 1 to 10 GHz, because at these frequencies the sky looks very ‘‘cold’’
and the attenuation of the atmosphere is small enough.
A microwave image of a terrain is acquired by placing a radiometer
on an airplane or a satellite and by scanning the beam of the antenna. The
emissivity of a rough ground surface is usually close to 1, whereas water has
much lower emissivity, about 0.4. Therefore, the brightness temperature of
a sea surface is TB = eTwater + (1 −e)Tsky ≈100K to 150K. Metallic objects
reflecting the cold sky are also easily distinguished. At longer wavelengths
the emissivity is sensitive to the soil moisture content, but the effects due
to the surface roughness and vegetation may reduce the accuracy. Combining
radiometric measurements at many frequencies and at both polarizations
with infrared measurements may enhance the accuracy.
Radiometry can also be applied for the measurement of thicknesses of
different layers. For example, a layer of ice or oil on the sea surface can be
detected because the layer works as a matching element between the wave
impedances of air and water. The reflection coefficient has a minimum and
the brightness temperature a maximum when the thickness of the layer is
a quarter (or an odd number of quarters) of wavelength.
Thermal emission of atmospheric gases can be used to study both the
lower and upper atmosphere. The oxygen resonance at 60 GHz reveals the
height profile of the temperature. The height profiles of the contents of
water vapor, ozone (O3), and many other molecules can be retrieved from
the measured spectral lines, which these molecules have at microwave and
millimeter-wave ranges. The emission or absorption spectrum of a molecule
that is not interacting with its surroundings is composed of a set of narrow
spectral lines. The collisions of molecules broaden these lines. Therefore,
molecules at lower altitudes and higher pressures emit broader spectral lines
than those at higher altitudes and lower pressures. Because the pressure versus
altitude is well known, the content profile of a molecule may be obtained
from the shape of its spectral line. A spectral line and the corresponding
height distribution of stratospheric ozone are shown in Figure 12.22.
The depletion of the ozone layer first observed in the 1980s is alarming
and requires constant monitoring. Global monitoring of the atmosphere can
best be carried out with radiometers onboard satellites. A proper geometry
for the measurement of upper atmosphere is achieved with a limb sounder,
a satellite instrument that has a narrow-beam antenna directed toward the
horizon. Height profiles can be measured by scanning the antenna.

sphere removed) and height profile corresponding to this line.
Example 12.4
A ground surface having a temperature of 295K and an emissivity of 1 is
covered with a quarter-wave layer of lossless material having a relative per-
mittivity of 5. Find the antenna temperature measured with a radiometer
pointing perpendicularly to the surface. Assume that the brightness tempera-
ture of sky is 0K.
Solution
The wave impedance of the layer is Zlayer = √m/e = √m0/e0 /√er =
376.7/√5V = 168.5V. Because now the ground is like a blackbody (emissiv-
ity e = 1), its wave impedance Zground = 376.7V equals the wave impedance
of free space, h0. The layer operates as a quarter-wave transformer (see
Section 4.3.3) that transforms Zground to a value of Zt = Z 2
layer /Zground =
75.4V. The reflection coefficient between the free space and this impedance
is r = (h0 −Zt )/(h0 + Zt ) = 0.666. The brightness temperature of the
ground is TB = eT = X1 −| r|2CT = 164K. This is also the antenna tempera-
ture seen by the radiometer, because the lossless layer itself does not emit
thermal radiation and the sky is cold. Without the layer, the antenna noise
temperature would be 295K.
12.7.2
Total Power Radiometer and Dicke Radiometer
A radiometer is a sensitive receiver that measures absolute noise power levels
accurately and that is calibrated to display the brightness temperature.
Figure 12.23 shows a block diagram of a total power radiometer. It is
a superheterodyne receiver, whose IF signal is fed to a detector. The mixer

341
Applications

usually converts both the upper and lower sideband to IF. The measurement
bandwidth is determined by the noise bandwidth of the IF stage, Bn . The
detected signal is integrated to average the noisy output voltage Vout , shown
in Figure 12.24. The output voltage includes both dc and ac components.
The dc component is directly proportional to the system noise temperature:
Vdc = GS (TA + TR )
(12.14)
The ac component, Vac , comes from the statistical nature of noise.
The ratio of the rms value of Vac to the dc component Vdc is 1/√Bn t
[9, 12], where t is the integration time of the detector output voltage. The
sensitivity of a radiometer is defined as the minimum change of the antenna
Figure 12.24 Output voltage of a total power radiometer.

342
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
noise temperature that can be detected. For a total power radiometer, the
sensitivity is
DT = TA + TR
√Bn t
(12.15)
A change of DT at the input produces at the output a change equal
to the rms value of Vac . The sensitivity can also be defined to be that change
at the input that produces a change equal to the peak-to-peak value of the
output voltage, Vpp . The peak-to-peak value is about six times the rms value.
The variations of the system gain, GS , reduce the accuracy of a measure-
ment. The gains of the amplifiers, mixer, and detector may depend on
temperature and supply voltages. The effect of slow variations can be taken
into account by calibrating the radiometer frequently with loads having
known brightness temperatures. Rapid gain fluctuations deteriorate the sensi-
tivity of the total power radiometer:
DT = (TA + TR )√
1
Bn t +S
DGS
GS D
2
(12.16)
where DGS is the rms value of the gain fluctuations. However, tight tempera-
ture control of the radiometer components successfully mitigates these
problems.
Figure 12.25 shows the block diagram of the Dicke radiometer, in
which the influence of gain variations is reduced. The receiver switches
continuously between the antenna and a noise source that has a constant

temperature, TC . Gain variations are assumed to be small between switching.
The output of the diode is detected synchronously with the switch generator
so that the output voltage, Vout , is proportional to the difference between
TA and TC . If the radiometer is balanced, that is, TA = TC , gain variations
have no influence on the output. A Dicke radiometer may be balanced by
injecting excess noise into the antenna branch (usually TA < TC ), by changing
the IF gain synchronously with a switch generator, or by adjusting the
temperature TC . Because only half of the time is used for an effective
measurement, the sensitivity, DT, of the Dicke radiometer is twice of that
of the total power radiometer:
DT = 2(TA + TR )
√Bn t
(12.17)
Example 12.5
A Dicke radiometer has a noise temperature TR = 500K and a bandwidth
Bn = 10 MHz. A blackbody having a temperature of 300K should be
measured with a resolution of 0.2K. Find the required integration time.
Solution
The system noise temperature TS = TA + TR = 800K. To obtain a sensitivity
DT = 0.2K, we solve for the required integration time from (12.17) as
t = (2TS /DT )2/Bn = (2 × 800/0.2)2/107 seconds = 6.4 seconds.
12.7.3
Remote-Sensing Radar
Side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), synthetic-aperture radar (SAR), scattero-
meter, and altimeter are radars used for remote sensing.
SLAR is pulse radar that is usually placed on an airplane. It produces
microwave images of ground at the side of the flight track. The beam of
the antenna is broad in the vertical direction and narrow in the horizontal
direction, as shown in Figure 12.26. If the plane flies at an altitude of
5 km, for example, the image may cover a range from 4 km to 15 km at
the side of the track. The resolution in the direction perpendicular to the
flight track depends on the pulse length t as
DRr =
ct
2 sin u
(12.18)
where u is the angle of incidence. Thus, directly below the flight track at
small u angles the resolution is bad. In the direction along the flight track,

344
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications

the resolution depends on the beamwidth of the antenna. If the dimension
of the antenna is D in the horizontal direction, the beamwidth is about l/D
and the along-track or cross-range resolution at a distance of R is
DRcr = Rl
D
(12.19)
The cross-range resolution gets worse as R increases and, therefore, SLAR
onboard a satellite would need a very large antenna to obtain good resolution.
To overcome the limited cross-range resolution of SLAR, satellite
remote-sensing radar is based on the principle of a synthetic aperture. Syn-
thetic-aperture radar is pulse radar that uses the motion of the satellite (or
some other vehicle) to synthesize the effect of a large antenna aperture.
Echoes of several pulses are processed coherently to produce high-resolution
images. If the pulses transmitted over a section of flight track having a length
of s are processed, the resolution of this synthetic aperture equals that of an
antenna having a width of 2s. Because a single-point target is in the view
of the real antenna over a track section s ≈Rl/D, the theoretical beamwidth
of the synthetic-aperture radar is
us = l
2s = D
2R
(12.20)

345
Applications
and the theoretical cross-range resolution is
DRcr = Rus = D
2
(12.21)
It is not practical to improve the resolution by using a smaller antenna
because echoes would get weaker and various sources of error over a long
section s would limit the resolution to a value higher than given by (12.21).
The reflectivity of the ground or sea surface depends on frequency,
polarization, and the angle of incidence. At higher frequencies, echoes depend
on the roughness of surface, whereas at lower frequencies, waves penetrate
into ground and echoes are sensitive to the humidity of soil. By combining
dual-polarization measurements made at different frequencies and angles of
incidence, SLAR and SAR measurements provide multifaceted information
for agriculture, forestry, geography, oceanography, and so on.
Scatterometers and altimeters are remote-sensing radar that do not
produce images. A scatterometer is radar calibrated for the measurement of
scattering. Scatterometers on satellites are used for the measurement of winds
over the oceans. Sea waves correlate with the wind, and scattering in turn
is sensitive to the height and shapes of the waves. Thus, by measuring
scattering from different angles, the speed and direction of wind may be
retrieved.
An altimeter is based on the measurement of the two-way propagation
time of an echo. Altimeters provide information of the shape of the globe,
ocean currents, ice coverage of glaciers, and so on.
12.8 Radio Astronomy
For a long time, only the optical window of the atmosphere covering visible
light and the shortest infrared and longest ultraviolet waves was available
for astronomers. In 1932, the American engineer Karl Jansky observed noise
coming from the Milky Way as he was studying interference in communica-
tion produced by thunderstorms. In the late 1930s, the American amateur
astronomer Grote Reber built a parabolic reflector and made the first rough
map of the radio sky. After World War II, microwave technology became
available to astronomers, and eventually radio astronomy developed into an
important part of astronomy. A very important milestone was the observation
of the interstellar neutral hydrogen at 1,420 MHz in 1953.

346
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
The atmosphere is nearly transparent (to zenith) from about 10 MHz
to tens of GHz. Thus, the radio window covers about four decades of
spectrum, whereas the width of the optical window is less than one decade.
The reflection from the ionosphere sets the lower frequency limit. At millime-
ter and submillimeter waves the attenuation of gases becomes prohibitive,
and telescopes must be placed on satellites.
The Sun, planets, gas and dust clouds of the Milky Way, pulsars, radio
galaxies, quasars, and cosmic background radiation are subjects studied in
radio astronomy [12]. Radio telescopes are also used for searching extraterres-
trial intelligence (SETI).
12.8.1
Radio Telescopes and Receivers
Signals from radio astronomical sources are very weak. Thus, a large radio
telescope and a sensitive receiver are crucial. A large telescope gathers waves
from a large area and has a good angular resolution. The telescope should
be situated at a high altitude and in a dry climate, especially if it is used at
submillimeter wavelengths. The location should also be selected so that the
level of man-made interference is low. The accuracy of the reflector surfaces
should be better than l/10, which is a formidable requirement for a large
telescope operating at high frequencies. Surface errors reduce the gain and
deteriorate the radiation pattern of the antenna.
Radio telescopes are typically parabolic reflector antennas. The telescope
of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Green Bank, West
Virginia, which started its operation in 2000, is the largest fully steerable
telescope. The size of this offset-fed reflector, shown in Figure 12.27, is
100m × 110m. It is usable even at millimeter wavelengths. Other large
parabolic reflectors are the 100-m telescope of the Max Planck Institute in
Effelsberg, Germany, the 76-m telescope of the University of Manchester
in Jodrell Bank, England, the 64-m telescope of CSIRO near Parkes, Austra-
lia, and the 45-m telescope of the Nobeyama Radio Observatory, Japan,
which operates up to 100 GHz. The 30-m telescope of the Institut de
Radioastronomie Millime´trique at Pico Veleta, Spain, and the 15-m James
Clerk Maxwell telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, are so accurate that they
can be used even at submillimeter wavelengths.
Due to gravitation, construction of steerable parabolic reflectors much
larger than 100m is not practical on Earth. However, even fixed telescopes
can cover large parts of the sky. The 305-m spherical reflector at Arecibo,
Puerto Rico, is situated in a mountain valley. Moving the feed antenna
allows observations up to 20° from the zenith. A large telescope can also be

347

made of a tilting flat reflector, which directs the waves to a fixed segment
of a parabola.
Even the largest radio telescopes, as measured in wavelengths, are very
small compared to optical telescopes and have correspondingly an inferior
resolution. The angle resolution may be improved by an aperture synthesis,
in which signals from several telescopes are combined. The Very Large Array
(VLA) of the NRAO in New Mexico consists of 27 parabolic reflectors,
each 25m in diameter. The antennas can be moved on three tracks 21 km
long, so that a Y-shaped configuration is formed on the plain. By taking
advantage of the Earth’s rotation and combining measurements made in
8 hours, an angle resolution equal to that of a continuous 40-km telescope
may be obtained.

348
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
In very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) radio telescopes are separated
by intercontinental distances or may even be in space. Signals cannot be
compared in real time but are recorded with accurate time signals from
atomic standards for later processing. The achievable resolution is far better
than that of optical telescopes. The Japanese satellite HALCA was launched
in 1997 and makes VLBI measurements with its 8-m telescope at 1.6 GHz,
5 GHz, and 22 GHz. It is in an elliptical orbit with an apogee height of
21,000 km.
The sensitivity of the receiver is very important in radio astronomical
measurements. Doubling of the system noise temperature increases the time
needed for a measurement by a factor of four. At microwave frequencies,
cooled transistor amplifiers (HEMT) are used as the front ends of the
receivers. At millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, receivers are based
on Schottky mixers, SIS mixers, cooled bolometric mixers, or bolometers.
Often an array of receivers is placed on the focal plane of the reflector.
Figure 12.28 shows a block diagram of a cooled Schottky-mixer receiver
operating in the 100-GHz frequency range. Signal from the reflector first
enters a quasioptical calibration and beam-switching system. Calibration is
based on two absorbing loads at known temperatures, one at the ambient
temperature (TH ), the other inside a cooled dewar (TC ). Beam switching
produces two adjacent beams in the sky by using a segmented, rotating
mirror and two fixed mirrors. The radio source to be observed is in one of
the beams while the other beam looks at the cold sky. The purpose of
beam switching is to reduce the influence of the fluctuations caused by the
atmosphere. The front-end components, feed horn, filter for LO injection,
mixer, and the first IF amplifier are cooled to 20K with a closed-cycle helium
refrigerator. The local oscillator is a phase-locked Gunn oscillator. The IF

signal is fed both to a detector operating synchronously with the beam
switching and to an acousto-optical spectrometer (AOS) for spectrum analysis.
12.8.2
Antenna Temperature of Radio Sources
The flux S of a radio source is calculated by integrating the brightness BS
over the solid angle VS covered by the source:
S =EE
VS
BS (u, f) d V
(12.22)
The unit of flux is jansky (Jy); one jansky is 10−26 Wm−2Hz−1.
Some radio sources are like points in the sky, and some sources are
extended. If the radio source is a point source and in the middle of the
antenna beam, the received power in the frequency band Df is
Pr = 1
2 Aef SDf
(12.23)
For an extended source, the flux S has to be replaced with the flux So
observed by the antenna. So is obtained by weighing the right side of (12.22)
with the normalized directional pattern Pn (u, f). If the brightness of the
radio source is constant over the whole antenna beam, the received power
is
Pr = 1
2 Aef BS VA Df
(12.24)
where VA = ee4p Pn (u, f) d V is the solid angle of the beam. Now the
observed flux is So = BS VA .
The received power may be written using the antenna noise temperature
TA as
Pr = kTA Df
(12.25)
Combining this with (12.23) gives
TA =
Aef So
2k
(12.26)

350
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
If the brightness temperature of the source, TB , is constant over the
whole beam, then TA = TB . For a small source (Pn ≈1 over the whole
source), the antenna noise temperature is
TA = VS
VA
TB
(12.27)
Above, the influence of the atmospheric loss was not taken into account.
Because the fluxes of radio sources are values defined outside the atmosphere,
the measured results have to be corrected with the attenuation of the atmo-
sphere.
Example 12.6
A point source having a flux of 2 Jy is measured with a 13.7-m radio
telescope. Find the antenna noise temperature produced by the source and
the required integration time t. The attenuation of the atmosphere is L =
0.8 dB, the aperture efficiency is hap = 0.6, the noise temperature of the
Dicke receiver is TR = 100K, and the bandwidth is Df = 300 MHz.
Solution
The physical area of the aperture is A = pD 2/4 = 147.4 m2. The effective
area Aef = hap A = 0.6 × 147.4 m2 = 88.4 m2. The flux at the antenna is
S = 2 × 10−0.08 Jy = 1.66 Jy. From (12.26), the antenna noise temperature
produced by the source is TA,source = 88.4 × 1.66 × 10−26/(2 × 1.38 ×
10−23)K = 53 mK. The sensitivity of a Dicke radiometer is DT =
2Ts /√tDf . The antenna noise temperature produced by the atmosphere is
TA,atm = (1 −1/L)Tphys = (1 −10−0.08) × 290K = 49K, assuming that the
physical temperature of the atmosphere, Tphys , is 290K. Thus, the system
noise temperature is TS = TA,atm + TR = 49K + 100K = 149K. The inte-
gration time depends on the required S /N (note that now signal is also
noise). S /N = 1 or TA = DT is achieved if t = (2TS /TA )2/Df = 0.11 second.
The integration time needed for S /N = 10 is 100 times longer, nearly 11
seconds.
12.8.3
Radio Sources in the Sky
The radio sky is very different from the sky we see at optical wavelengths.
Point sources, radio ‘‘stars,’’ are not ordinary stars, which are relatively weak
emitters of radio waves. The most significant similarities are the plane and
the center of the Milky Way, which can be seen clearly in both optical and
radio pictures.

351
Applications
Radio sources have different frequency dependencies. The radiation
produced by thermal sources obeys Planck’s radiation law. Nonthermal
sources often emit synchrotron radiation, which is produced by electrons
spiraling in a magnetic field. The intensity of synchrotron radiation decreases
as frequency increases. Both thermal and synchrotron radiation have a broad,
continuous spectrum and are called continuum radiation. Some sources emit
only at discrete frequencies and have a line spectrum. Atoms and molecules
emit spectral lines as their energy levels change, that is, when the atom or
molecule after excitation returns to equilibrium.
There are many radio sources in our solar system, in our galaxy, and
outside it. Moreover, from all directions comes a weak background radiation,
which corresponds to the radiation from a blackbody at a temperature of
2.7K; see Figure 12.29. The intensity of the cosmic background radiation
is at maximum at millimeter wavelengths, but on Earth it can best be observed
in microwave range, where the noise level is the lowest. The discovery of
background radiation in 1964 was proof in favor of the Big Bang theory,
which assumes that the universe was born in a huge explosion. After its
birth, the universe is believed to have expanded and cooled, and now we
can observe the remnant of this explosion. The background radiation obeys
extremely accurately Planck’s law and is very isotropic. However, some
anisotropy had to be in the young universe because galaxies have formed.
In 1992, the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite launched by
NASA observed these anisotropies: The brightness of background radiation
had tiny fluctuations whose relative amplitude was one part in one hundred
thousand (1:100,000). The aim of successive space missions, such as the
Figure 12.29 Spectrum of the cosmic background radiation.

352
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP), launched in 2001, and Planck Surveyor,
scheduled for launch in 2007, is to measure these fluctuations with a much
better angle resolution and with a better receiver sensitivity.
Although stars are weak radio sources, the Sun is an exception because
of its vicinity. The radiation from the Sun at frequencies higher than
30 GHz resembles the radiation of a blackbody at a temperature of about
6,000K. At lower frequencies the brightness temperature may be as high as
1010K and depends on the activity of the Sun. When the Sun is active and
there are plenty of sunspots, there are variations in the intensity of radiation.
The sunspots are a source of slow variations and the flares are a source of
rapid variations.
The planets and the Moon radiate almost as a blackbody. Jupiter is
an exception: Below microwave frequencies it radiates more than a blackbody
at the same temperature. The intensity of Jupiter’s radiation varies in a
complicated manner and is related to the position of its moon Io. Before
the time of spacecraft, planets were studied using radar techniques. For
example, the rotation times of Mercury and cloud-covered Venus were
determined with radar in the 1960s. The surface of Venus was mapped more
accurately in the beginning of the 1990s with SAR on the Magellan spacecraft.
The rings of Saturn, its moon Titan, and asteroids have also been studied
with radar.
Gas and molecular clouds, remnants of supernovas, and pulsars are
radio sources in our galaxy. The continuum radiation of the Milky Way
consists of synchrotron radiation and thermal radiation from ionized hydro-
gen. The synchrotron radiation dominates at frequencies lower than about
1 GHz and the thermal radiation at higher frequencies.
At 1,420 MHz (l = 21 cm) interstellar neutral hydrogen emits a
spectral line, which has been used to map the structure of the Milky Way.
By measuring radial velocities of hydrogen clouds in different directions
using the Doppler shift, it has been concluded that we live in a spiral galaxy.
Even the center of the Milky Way can be studied using radio waves, which
penetrate through dust clouds.
In addition to hydrogen, many different molecules, both inorganic and
organic, have been observed in interstellar clouds, in which new stars are born.
More than 80 different molecules have been found, the most complicated of
which has 13 atoms [14]. The line spectra of molecules are produced by
changes in the rotational energy states and occur at millimeter and submilli-
meter wavelengths. Lines may be either emission or absorption lines. An
absorption line is produced when a cloud absorbs a narrow band of frequencies
from continuum radiation coming from background. The measurement of

the spectral lines reveals the distribution of molecules and dynamics of clouds.
Figure 12.30 shows a measured spectrum of a molecular cloud in Orion
[15].
Pulsars, originally called pulsating stars, are swiftly rotating neutron
stars. They emit radiation in two narrow beams that sweep space like the
beams from a lighthouse. The periods of short pulses received from pulsars
range from one-thousandth of a second to a few seconds. The periods are
very stable but are in some cases increasing as the neutron star slows down.
Radio galaxies and quasars (quasistellar objects) are radio sources outside
our galaxy. The nearest normal galaxies have been mapped using radio waves.
The radio emission of an ordinary galaxy is only a small fraction of its optical
emission. In radio galaxies, the intensities of radio and optical emissions are
of the same order. Quasars look like point sources. Their optical spectra
show such large red shifts or recession velocities that the most distant quasars
must be located near the edge of the known universe, or they are seen as
they looked in the early universe. The intensities of both optical and radio
emissions change with periods as small as one day, indicating that the quasars
are small. The huge radiation of such a small object can be explained only
by assuming that matter is falling down a black hole.
12.9 Sensors for Industrial Applications
Microwaves can be used for many kinds of measurements in industry [16–19].
The electrical properties of matter determine how radio waves propagate in
it and reflect from interfaces. Electrical properties in turn depend on physical
properties such as moisture, density, composition, and temperature. The
Figure 12.30 Spectral lines of an interstellar molecular cloud. (After: [15].)

354
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
advantages of microwave sensors are that measurements can be carried out
without touching the object and that microwaves penetrate into the material.
Different types of sensors and their applicability are treated here.
12.9.1
Transmission Sensors
A typical transmission sensor has two horn antennas, a transmitter, and a
receiver. Waves pass through the object placed between the antennas. The
phase shift due to the change in propagation velocity and the attenuation
due to loss in the material are measured. Transmission sensors are simple
and can be used for the measurement of materials moving on a conveyor
belt, for example, or in a large tube. They are used to measure the moisture
content of grain, coal, sand, and so on.
12.9.2
Resonators
A microwave resonator may be a cavity, strip-line, slot-line, parallel-wire
line, or coaxial-line resonator. Resonators based on a slot or parallel-wire
line may be used to measure liquid, granular, or pasty materials. Strip-
line resonators are suitable for measuring sheets and material layers. Cavity
resonators may be used as gas analyzers and to measure bars and materials
flowing in tubes. Resonators may be used for many kinds of measurements:
the moisture content of paper (see Figure 12.31), veneer, and air, the thickness
of paper mass, the fiber orientation in paper, the thickness of plastic bars
Figure 12.31 Strip-line resonator array for measuring paper moisture profile. (After: [17].)

355
Applications
and metal sheets, the burning energy value of peat, the water content of
snow, and so on.
12.9.3
Reflection Sensors
The complex reflection coefficient of an object depends on the relative
permittivity er and its distribution within a few skin depths from the surface.
If the object is layered, the thickness and permittivity of the layers may be
solved from the frequency response of the reflection coefficient. An open
end of a coaxial cable or waveguide, which is pressed on the surface of the
object, is a simple reflection sensor. The reflection coefficient depends on
the end capacitance and conductance, which in turn are functions of er .
Measurement of ground moisture and testing of materials are applications
of reflection sensors.
12.9.4
Radar Sensors
Radar sensors can measure the amplitude of reflection, propagation time,
or Doppler shift. Applications of radar sensors are numerous: door openers,
movement detectors in burglar alarms, surface height detectors in vessels
(applicable also when there is danger of explosion or foam on the surface),
measuring power line vibrations, detecting rot in trees (see Figure 12.32),
detecting pipes, cables, ancient relics, and mines in the ground, measuring
marsh depth, and more.
Figure 12.32 Impulse radar used to measure rot in trees.

356
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
12.9.5
Radiometer Sensors
Radiometer sensors provide information on the physical temperature and
emissivity of an object. If one is known, the other may be found from the
measured brightness temperature. A radiometer can make measurements
through steam and smoke. By measuring also the reflection coefficient, the
accuracy can be improved. The depth profile of temperature may be obtained
by using several frequencies.
12.9.6
Imaging Sensors
In microwave tomography, the changes in amplitude and phase distribution
caused by the object are measured as shown in Figure 12.33. The three-
dimensional distribution of the permittivity may then be determined. In
microwave holography, the shape of the object is resolved by measuring the
scattered field. Imaging sensors can be used to search for objects in the
ground, inside ceilings, or in security inspections.
12.10 Power Applications
Radio waves can be used for heating lossy materials. Often losses are caused
by polar molecules such as water molecules, which the electric field turns
back and forth. In many dielectric materials m ″ = 0 and s = 0, and according
to (2.99) the power absorbed is

where E is the electric field within the material. Figure 12.34 shows how
the electric field E inside bodies of different shapes is related to the field E0
in the surrounding air.
Frequencies of 27 MHz and 2.45 GHz are allocated for power applica-
tions in Europe. Microwave ovens in the 2.45-GHz range are the most
common power application. The oven shown in Figure 12.35 is a large
cavity resonator within which many resonance modes are excited to realize
a field that is as even as possible. The household ovens have a magnetron
oscillator and their power is typically 600W to 1,000W. In industry, radio-
frequency power is used to dry lumber, bake bread, vulcanize rubber, seam
plastic, dry concrete, and so on.
12.11 Medical Applications
Radio waves are used in thermography, diathermy, and hyperthermia. Dia-
thermy and hyperthermia are based on the absorption of radio-frequency

surrounding air.

energy by a tissue, whereas in thermography, the thermal emission of the
tissue is measured.
12.11.1
Thermography
According to Planck’s law, the maximum intensity of thermal radiation is
at infrared wavelengths if the temperature of a blackbody is 310K, the
temperature of a human being. However, a human being can easily be
detected with a microwave radiometer also. At microwaves, the human body
is a gray object: at 3 GHz the emissivity of skin is about 0.5 and at 30 GHz
over 0.9 [20].
The skin depth ds given in (2.69) is a measure of how deep the waves
penetrate into the material. At a depth of ds from the surface, the field has
attenuated by a factor of e from its original value at the surface. Correspond-
ingly, the skin depth determines from how deep the thermal radiation of
the tissue can be detected. The skin depth depends on the frequency and
electric properties of the material. In bone and fatty tissue, water content is
low and, thus, the skin depth is large. Muscles and skin have much higher
water content and smaller skin depth, as shown in Figure 12.36 [21].
Thermography offers a noninvasive technique for early detection of
cancer. A tumor having a temperature 1°C to 5°C higher than its surround-
Figure 12.36 Skin depth for different tissues. (After: [21].)

359
Applications
ings can be detected with a microwave radiometer if the tumor is close
enough to the surface. At RF a tumor can be detected from a depth of a
few centimeters; at microwave frequencies a tumor can be detected only if
it is on the skin or just below it. The antenna of the radiometer may be a
large focusing antenna or a contact antenna pressed on the skin.
12.11.2
Diathermy
In diathermy, the temperature of a tissue or body is elevated by radio-
frequency energy. Frequencies for diathermy are 27 MHz and 2.45 GHz.
The temperature of the tissue is raised to between 39°C and 45°C. Higher
temperatures, which kill cells, must be avoided. The power density may be
100 to 1,000 mW/cm2. The power is focused to a restricted area and sensitive
parts of body, such as eyes, are protected. Raising the temperature has many
positive effects: Blood vessels become distended and circulation quickens,
muscles relax, the threshold of pain gets higher, the stretching ability of a
connective tissue increases, the penetration ability of cell membranes
increases, and metabolism and enzyme reactions speed up. Diathermy is
used for relieving muscle tension and as a pretreatment for physical therapy.
12.11.3
Hyperthermia
Microwave hyperthermia is used to treat cancer. A tissue containing a tumor
is heated without destroying the healthy cells surrounding the tumor. This
is possible because at 41°C to 45°C the cancer cells are destroyed more
readily than the healthy cells [22]. Because the power density is high (1
W/cm2) and the skin absorbs well, a burn may arise in the skin on top of
the tumor. To be able to focus the energy into the tumor, microwave
frequencies have to be used.
12.12 Electronic Warfare
Radar and wireless communication have many important military applica-
tions. There are also many other ways to utilize radio engineering techniques
or knowledge for military purposes: jamming enemy communication and
radar, stealth technology, signal intelligence, and so on. These applications
go under the name electronic warfare (EW). Electronic warfare can be defined
as military action involving the use of electromagnetic energy to determine,
exploit, reduce, or prevent the use of the electromagnetic spectrum by the

360
Radio Engineering for Wireless Communication and Sensor Applications
enemy, and as action that retains effective use of this spectrum, but sometimes
also as military action where an electromagnetic weapon is used against
personnel. EW is divided into three categories:
• Electronic support (ES), formerly EW support measures (ESM);
• Electronic attack (EA), formerly electronic countermeasures (ECM);
• Electronic protection (EP), formerly electronic counter-countermeasures
(ECCM).
12.12.1
ES
ES is defined as actions taken to search for, intercept, locate, record, and
analyze radiated electromagnetic energy for the purpose of exploiting it in
support of military operations, especially for the purpose of immediate threat
recognition. ES involves signal intelligence (SIGINT), which is divided into
electronics intelligence (ELINT) and communications intelligence (COMINT).
Detection, identification, evaluation, and location of foreign electromagnetic
radiation from radar, communication radios, and so on are called electronic
reconnaissance.
In ELINT wideband monitoring receivers covering, typically, frequency
ranges from 20 to 500 MHz and from 0.5 to 40 GHz, as well as omnidirec-
tional or rotating antennas are used to detect the presence of a radar signal.
A high-gain steerable antenna is used to find the rough direction of the signal
source. The signal is then analyzed and characterized using a sophisticated
channelized receiver and analyzer, and compared to known radar signals in
a signal library. Direction-finding antenna systems consisting of an array of
antenna elements and utilizing, for example, interferometric or time difference
of arrival (TDOA) techniques, are used at several receiving sites in order to
locate the transmitting radar. Similarly, in COMINT communication signals
in the HF, VHF, and UHF ranges are characterized and their sources located.
12.12.2
EA
EA is a division of EW involving actions taken to prevent or reduce an
enemy’s effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum by either passive or
active means. EA involves, for example, radar or communication link jam-
ming, high-power electromagnetic pulse (EMP), stealth technology, and the
use of chaff to make fake radar targets.
Active EA involves jamming, high-power microwave weapons, and
EMP. Jamming is deliberate radiation of wideband RF noise for the purpose

361
Applications
of preventing or reducing an enemy’s effective use of radar or communication
link. The high-power microwave weapon or electromagnetic weapon is a
class of directed energy weapons (DEW), and it is any device that can produce
a directed microwave field of such intensity that targeted items of electronic
equipment experience damage. EMP is often related to the electromagnetic
radiation from a nuclear explosion, but it may also be caused by non-nuclear
means, such as radio equipment; the resulting strong electric and magnetic
fields may damage electronic systems.
Passive EA includes the use of chaff or decoys and stealth technology.
Chaff is highly microwave-reflective material, such as sections of thin metallic
stripes or wires with a resonant length, dispensed over a large volume to
present a false radar target in order to protect a battleship or aircraft. A
decoy is a passive dummy target or a radio repeater that appears as a false
radar target. Stealth technology is used to reduce the radar cross section of
an aircraft, ship, or ground facility by shaping the object and covering its
surfaces with layers of absorbing composite materials.
12.12.3
EP
This division of EW involves actions taken to ensure effective use of the
electromagnetic spectrum despite the enemy’s use of electronic warfare by
protecting equipment and facilities. EP involves technologies, such as
shielding, that make electronic equipment robust against jamming, electro-
magnetic weapons, and EMP.

Biological Effects and Safety
Standards
RF radiation does not ionize molecules in biological tissue, because the
energy quantum hf is only 4 meV at 1 THz, while the minimum energy
to ionize those molecules is about 12 eV. Therefore, according to the informa-
tion and understanding of today, RF radiation cannot cause mutations
leading to, for example, cancer. However, RF radiation may have other
hazards: So-called thermal hazards are known for sure.
The biological effects of RF radiation have been studied through experi-
ments with animals and models, and through epidemiological research.
Effects may be divided into two classes: thermal effects and nonthermal
effects [1]. Firmly observed thermal effects are the following:
• Cataracts;
• Increase of tissue temperature (see diathermy and hyperthermia in
Section 12.11);
• Burns.
In addition, heat is known to weaken sperm, so this is also a possible
side effect of strong RF radiation. Furthermore, RF radiation is suspected
of causing instability in blood pressure and pulse rate, and changes in breath-
ing due to thermal effects.
Nonthermal effects are subjective (like sensitivity to electricity) and
include headache, tiredness, insomnia, irritation, weak appetite, loss of
363

memory, and so on. The origin of these effects is not known, neither are
they unambiguously proven.
Dosimetry is a field of research studying how radiation is absorbed
into a tissue. The absorption of RF radiation depends on the skin depth ds
of the tissue, on the size of the object in wavelengths, and on the polarization
of radiation [2, 3]. Depending on whether the electric field, the magnetic
field, or the propagation vector of the incident wave is parallel to the longitudi-
nal axis of the object, the polarization is said to be E-, H-, or k-polarization.
To measure absorption we use the specific absorption rate (SAR ),
which has a unit of watts per kilogram. The SAR depends strongly on the
size of the object. According to model measurements, the SAR on
E-polarization of an average-sized person is as shown in Figure 13.1 [4]. At
70 MHz there is a strong resonance. Various parts of the body have their
own resonance frequencies; the human head has a resonance at about 400
MHz. Because of resonance and depending on the tissue type, hot spots
may appear in the human body exposed to RF radiation; however, these
hot spots are not very pronounced due to high losses in the human body.
In practice, nearly all human beings are exposed to RF radiation from,
for example, mobile phones [5]. A person in a certain profession may be
exposed to a considerably higher power density. The industrial personnel
working with RF heaters or dryers is a good example of this. A faulty
Figure 13.1 Average SAR in plane wave conditions with power density of 10 W/m2 calcu-
lated using a block model of size of an average human being. Measurement
points are obtained with experimental models with human shape but artificial
tissues. (After: [4].)

Biological Effects and Safety Standards
microwave oven may expose its user to a high RF radiation dose. However,
we do not know any incidence where a person has been permanently harmed
by leakage radiation from a microwave oven. When an oven is mechanically
damaged, however, its leakage radiation should be checked before the oven
is used.
We consider harmless all the appliances that have maximum power
below 100 mW. Table 13.1 lists typical sources of RF radiation.
Most countries use both national and international safety standards.
The standards set limits on RF radiation power density or field strengths to
which people in the general public and specific personnel dealing with strong
RF radiation sources may be exposed.
In 1998 the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protec-
tion (ICNIRP) developed new guidelines for limiting exposure to time-
varying electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic fields [6], based on which

the Commission of the European Union in 1999 issued a directive concerning
limiting acceptable exposure to electromagnetic fields to between 0 Hz and
300 GHz. Table 13.2 provides these limits. It is worth noticing that, because
of the human body’s resonance, the frequency range from 10 to 400 MHz
is considered more harmful than other frequency ranges. In Finland, the
Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority supervises the safety of RF
equipment.

positions at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO), the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst, the Chalmers University of Tech-
nology, Go¨teborg, Sweden, at the Department of Physics, University of
California, Berkeley, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and California Institute
of Technology, Pasadena, and the Paris Observatory and University of
Paris 6.
Currently, Dr. Ra¨isa¨nen is supervising research in millimeter-wave
components, antennas, receivers, and microwave measurements at HUT
Radio Laboratory and MilliLab. He has authored or coauthored about 400
scientific or technical papers and five books: Microwave Measurement Tech-
niques, Radio Engineering, RF and Microwave Techniques, Millimeter-Wave
Techniques, and Fundamentals of Radio Engineering (with A. Lehto, published
by Otatieto, in 1991, 1992, 1994, 1997, and 2001, respectively, all in
Finnish). He also coauthored a chapter, ‘‘Radio-Telescope Receivers’’ with
M. E. Tiuri, in J. D. Kraus, Radio Astronomy, Second Edition (Cygnus-Quasar
Books, 1986). In 1994 he was elected to the grade of Fellow of the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) with the citation ‘‘for contribu-
tion to and leadership in millimeter-wave receiver technology.’’ In 1998 he
