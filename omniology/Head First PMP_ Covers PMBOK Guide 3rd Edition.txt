Praise for Head First PMP
“I have been doing project management for over 30 years and am considered a subject matter expert in 
the PMBOK Guide, Third Edition, primarily because I am the project manager who led the team that 
developed this edition…I can honestly say that Head First PMP is by far the best PMP exam preparation 
book of all I have reviewed in depth. It is the very best basic education and training book that I have 
read that presents the processes for managing a project, which makes it a great resource for a basic 
project management class for beginners as well as a tool for practitioners who want to pass the PMP 
exam. The graphical story format is unique, as project management books go, which makes it both fun 
and easy to read while driving home the basics that are necessary for preparing someone who is just 
getting started and those who want to take the exam.”
— Dennis Bolles, PMP 
Project manager for the PMBOK Guide, Third Edition, Leadership Team, 
DLB Associates, LLC, and coauthor of The Power of Enterprise-Wide Project 
Management
“This looks like too much fun to be a PMP study guide! Behind the quirky humor and nutty graphics lies 
an excellent explanation of the project management processes. Not only will this book make it easier to 
pass the exam, you’ll learn a lot of good stuff to use on the job too.”
— Carol Steuer, PMP
PMBOK Guide, Third Edition, Leadership Team
“This is the best thing to happen to PMP since, well, ever. You’ll laugh, learn, pass the exam, and become 
a better project manager all at the same time.”
— Scott Berkun, author of The Art of Project Management and The Myths of 
Innovation
“I love the brain-friendly approach used by Head First. When was the last time you heard that a PMP 
prep book was fun to read? This one really is!”
— Andy Kaufman, host of the People and Projects Podcast on iTunes
“Head First PMP is the PMP exam prep book for the rest of us: the people who live project management 
daily and want an exam prep book that is as interesting as the work we live, prepares them for the exam, 
and helps them become a better project manager. I’ve taken my copy of the first edition to numerous 
exam prep classes I have helped teach as a reference book. Students will pick it up, review several pages 
or topics and say, ‘That is how I learn. Can I take your copy?’ The impact and satisfaction is immediate.”
— Ken Jones, PMP and project manager
“In today’s business world, it’s not just what you get done, it’s how you get it done. To that end, Head First 
PMP has just the right balance of wit and fun that makes learning the Project Management Body of 
Knowledge engaging and interesting.”
—Jen Poisson, Director of Production Operations, Disney Online

Praise for Head First PMP
“Wow. In the beginning of March I finished and passed a four-hour adventure called the PMP exam. I 
can honestly say that though I used a few study guides, without the help of Head First PMP, I don’t know 
how I would have done it. Jenny and Andrew put together one of the best ‘head smart, brain friendly’ 
training manuals that I have ever seen. I have to say that I am a huge fan and will be buying their new 
Beautiful Teams book. Anyone I meet who mentions wanting to take the exam, I send them to http://
www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfpmp/ to get the sample chapter and free test. Seeing is believing. Thanks, 
Andrew and Jenny, for putting together an exceptional study guide. Keep up the good work!” 
—Joe Pighetti Jr., PMP, engineer
“I think that under the fonts and formalized goofiness, the book has a good heart (intending to cover basic 
principles in an honest way rather than just to pass the test). Head First PMP attempts to educate potential 
project managers instead of being a mere ‘how to pass the PMP exam’ book filled with test-taking tips. 
This is truly something, which sets it apart from the other PMP certification exam books.”
— Jack Dahlgren, project management consultant
“I love this format!  Head First PMP covers everything you need to know to pass your PMP exam. The 
sound-bite format combined with the whimsical images turns a dry subject into entertainment. The 
organization starts with the basics, then drills into the details. The in-depth coverage of complex topics 
like earned value and quality control are presented in an easy-to-understand format with descriptions, 
pictures, and examples. This book will not only help you pass the PMP [exam], it should be used as a 
daily reference for practicing project managers. I sure wish I had this when I was studying for the exam.” 
—Mike Jenkins, PMP, MBA
“It is like an instructor with a blackboard in a book, and the little devil and angel over your shoulder 
telling you what is right or wrong. I am getting instant results from the first five chapters. An excellent 
guide/training tool for all those new and somewhat new to project management methodologies.”
—BJ Moore, PMP 
Nashville, TN 
Amazon.com reviewer
“Studying for your PMP exam? Would you like the ability to carry not only an instructor but an entire 
classroom in your briefcase as you prepare? Then buy this book! The drawings and diagrams are 
reminiscent of your favorite teacher utilizing the whiteboard to step you through the key points of their 
lecture. The author’s use of redundancy in making the same point in multiple ways, coupled with the 
“there are no dumb questions” sections, gave the feeling of being in a classroom full of your fellow PMP 
aspiring peers. At times I actually caught myself feeling relieved that someone else asked such a good 
question. This book is enjoyable, readable, and most importantly takes the fear out of approaching 
the subject matter. If you are testing the PMP waters with your big toe, this book will give you the 
confidence to dive into the deep end.”
—Steven D. Sewell, PMP

Praise for other Head First books
“With Head First C#, Andrew and Jenny have presented an excellent tutorial on learning C#. It is very 
approachable while covering a great amount of detail in a unique style. If you’ve been turned off by 
more conventional books on C#, you’ll love this one.”
—Jay Hilyard, software developer, coauthor of C# 3.0 Cookbook
“I’ve never read a computer book cover to cover, but this one held my interest from the first page to the 
last. If you want to learn C# in depth and have fun doing it, this is the book for you.”
— Andy Parker, fledgling C# programmer
“Going through this Head First C# book was a great experience. I have not come across a book series 
which actually teaches you so well…This is a book I would definitely recommend to people wanting to 
learn C#”
—Krishna Pala, MCP
“Head First Web Design really demystifies the web design process and makes it possible for any web 
programmer to give it a try. For a web developer who has not taken web design classes, Head First Web 
Design confirmed and clarified a lot of theory and best practices that seem to be just assumed in this 
industry.”
—Ashley Doughty, senior web developer
“Building websites has definitely become more than just writing code. Head First Web Design shows you 
what you need to know to give your users an appealing and satisfying experience. Another great Head 
First book!”
—Sarah Collings, user experience software engineer
“Head First Networking takes network concepts that are sometimes too esoteric and abstract even for highly 
technical people to understand without difficulty and makes them very concrete and approachable. Well 
done.”
— Jonathan Moore, owner, Forerunner Design
“The big picture is what is often lost in information technology how-to books. Head First Networking keeps 
the focus on the real world, distilling knowledge from experience and presenting it in byte-size packets 
for the IT novitiate. The combination of explanations with real-world problems to solve makes this an 
excellent learning tool.”
— Rohn Wood, senior research systems analyst, University of Montana

Jennifer Greene studied philosophy in 
college but figured out pretty soon afterward 
that she really loved building software. Luckily, 
she’s a great software engineer, so she started out 
working at an online service, and that’s the first 
time she really got a sense of what good software 
development looked like.
She moved to New York in 1998 to work on 
software quality at a financial software company. 
She’s managed a teams of developers, testers, and 
PMs on software projects in media and finance 
since then.
She’s traveled all over the world to work with 
different software teams and build all kinds of cool 
projects.
She loves traveling, watching Bollywood movies, 
reading the occasional comic book, playing PS4 
games, and hanging out with her huge Siberian 
cat, Sascha.
Andrew Stellman, despite being raised a 
New Yorker, has lived in Pittsburgh twice. The 
first time was when he graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon’s School of Computer Science, and then 
again when he and Jenny were starting their 
consulting business and writing their first book for 
O’Reilly.
When he moved back to his hometown, his first 
job after college was as a programmer at EMI-
Capitol Records—which actually made sense, 
since he went to LaGuardia High School of 
Music and Art and the Performing Arts to study 
cello and jazz bass guitar. He and Jenny first 
worked together at that same financial software 
company, where he was managing a team of 
programmers. He’s had the privilege of working 
with some pretty amazing programmers over the 
years, and likes to think that he’s learned a few 
things from them.
When he’s not writing books, Andrew keeps 
himself busy writing useless (but fun) software, 
playing music (but video games even more), 
experimenting with circuits that make odd noises, 
studying taiji and aikido, having a girlfriend 
named Lisa, and owning a pomeranian. 
Jenny and Andrew have been building software and writing about software engineering together since they 
first met in 1998. Their first book, Applied Software Project Management, was published by O’Reilly in 
2005. They published their second book in the Head First series, Head First C#, in 2009.
They founded Stellman & Greene Consulting in 2003 to build a really neat software project for 
scientists studying herbicide exposure in Vietnam vets. When they’re not building software or writing 
books, they do a lot of speaking at conferences and meetings of software engineers, architects, and 
project managers.

Your brain on PMP.   Here you are trying to learn something, while here 
your brain is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn’t stick.  Your 
brain’s thinking, “Better leave room for more important things, like which wild 
animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a bad idea.” So how do you 
trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing enough to get 
through the PMP exam?

Tired of facing the same old problems?    If you’ve worked on 
a lot of projects, you know that you face the same problems, over and over 
again. It’s time to learn some common solutions to those problems. There’s 
a whole lot that project managers have learned over the years, and passing 
the PMP exam is your ticket to putting that wisdom into practice. Get ready to 
change the way you manage your projects forever.

In good company
If you want something done right…better hope you’re in the 
right kind of organization.   All projects are about teamwork—but how your team 
works depends a lot on the type of organization you’re in. In this chapter, you’ll learn about 
the different types of organizations around—and which type you should look for the next time 
you need a new job.

It all fits together
All of the work you do on a project is made up of processes.   Once you 
know how all the processes in your project fit together, it’s easy to remember everything you need to 
know for the PMP exam. There’s a pattern to all of the work that gets done on your project. First you 
plan it, then you get to work. While you are doing the work, you are always comparing your project to 
your original plan. When things start to get off-plan, it’s your job to make corrections and put everything 
back on track. And the process framework—the process groups and knowledge areas—is the key 
to all of this happening smoothly.

Getting it done on time
Time management is what most people think of when they 
think of project managers.  It’s where the deadlines are set and met. It starts 
with figuring out the work you need to do, how you will do it, what resources you’ll use, 
and how long it will take. From there, it’s all about developing and controlling that schedule.

Watching the bottom line
Every project boils down to money.  If you had a bigger budget, you 
could probably get more people to do your project more quickly and deliver more. That’s 
why no project plan is complete until you come up with a budget. But no matter whether 
your project is big or small, and no matter how many resources and activities are in it, 
the process for figuring out the bottom line is always the same!

Getting it right
It’s not enough to make sure you get it done on time and under 
budget.  You need to be sure you make the right product to suit your stakeholders’ 
needs. Quality means making sure that you build what you said you would and that you do 
it as efficiently as you can. That means trying not to make too many mistakes and always 
keeping your project working toward the goal of creating the right product!

Getting the team together
Behind every successful project is a great team.  So how do you 
make sure that you get—and keep—the best possible team for your project? You need to 
plan carefully, set up a good working environment, and negotiate for the best people 
you can find. But it’s not enough to put a good team together… If you want your project 
to go well, you’ve got to keep the team motivated and deal with any conflicts that happen 
along the way. Human resource management gives you the tools you need to get the 
best team for the job and lead them through a successful project.

Getting the word out
Communications management is about keeping everybody in 
the loop.  Have you ever tried talking to someone in a really loud, crowded room? That’s 
what running a project is like if you don’t get a handle on communications. Luckily, there’s 
Communications Management, which is how to get everyone talking about the work that’s 
being done, so that they all stay on the same page. That way, everyone has the information 
they need to resolve any issues and keep the project moving forward.

Even the most carefully planned project can run into trouble.  
No matter how well you plan, your project can always run into unexpected problems. 
Team members get sick or quit, resources that you were depending on turn out to be 
unavailable—even the weather can throw you for a loop. So does that mean that you’re 
helpless against unknown problems? No! You can use risk planning to identify potential 
problems that could cause trouble for your project, analyze how likely they’ll be to occur, 
take action to prevent the risks you can avoid, and minimize the ones that you can’t.

Project management is about knowing your 
audience.  If you don’t get a handle on the people who are 
affected by your project, you might discover that they have needs 
you aren’t meeting. If your project is going to be successful, you’ve 
got to satisfy your stakeholders.  Luckily, there’s Stakeholder 
Management, which you can use to understand your stakeholders 
and figure out what they need. Once you really understand how 
important those needs are to your project, it’s a lot easier to keep 
everyone satisfied.

Making good choices
It’s not enough to just know your stuff. You need to 
make good choices to be good at your job.  Everyone who 
has the PMP credential agrees to follow the Project Management Institute 
Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, too. The Code helps you with 
ethical decisions that aren’t really covered in the body of knowledge—and 
it’s a big part of the PMP exam. Most of what you need to know is really 
straightforward, and with a little review, you’ll do well.

Are you a project manager?
Do you want to learn, understand, remember, and

you can prepare for the PMP exam, and learn to be a

Do you prefer stimulating dinner-party conversation 
to dry, dull, academic lectures?

Are you completely new to project management?
(To qualify to take the PMP exam, you need to show a 
certain number of hours of experience as a professional 
project manager.)
Are you already PMP certified and looking for a 
reference book on project management?
Are you afraid to try something different? Would 
you rather have a root canal than mix stripes with 
plaid? Do you believe that a technical book can’t 
be serious if project management concepts are 
anthropomorphized?
We’ll help you study for the PMP 
exam in a way that will definitely 
make it easier for you to pass.
But even if you don’t have quite 
enough hours yet, this book can still 
help you study now, so you can be 
ready when you’ve got those hours 
under your belt! Plus, the ideas will 
help you on your job immediately…
You can also 
use this book 
to help you 
study for 
the CAPM 
exam—a lot of 
the concepts 
are really 
similar.

the intro
Great. 
Only 800 
more 
dull, dry, 
boring 
pages.
We know what you’re thinking.
And we know what your brain is thinking.
“How can this be a serious project management book?”
“What’s with all the graphics?”
“Can I actually learn it this way?”
Your brain craves novelty. It’s always searching, scanning, waiting for 
something unusual. It was built that way, and it helps you stay alive. 
So what does your brain do with all the routine, ordinary, normal things 
you encounter? Everything it can to stop them from interfering with 
the brain’s real job—recording things that matter. It doesn’t bother 
saving the boring things; they never make it past the “this is obviously 
not important” filter.
How does your brain know what’s important? Suppose you’re out for 
a day hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens inside your 
head and body? 
Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. 
And that’s how your brain knows…
This must be important! Don’t forget it!
But imagine you’re at home, or in a library. It’s a safe, warm, tiger‑free zone. 
You’re studying. Getting ready for an exam. Or trying to learn some 
tough technical topic your boss thinks will take a week, 10 days at the 
most.
Just one problem. Your brain’s trying to do you a big favor. It’s trying 
to make sure that this obviously unimportant content doesn’t clutter 
up scarce resources. Resources that are better spent storing the really 
big things. Like tigers. Like the danger of fire. Like how you should 
never again snowboard in shorts.
And there’s no simple way to tell your brain, “Hey brain, thank you 
very much, but no matter how dull this book is, and how little I’m 
registering on the emotional Richter scale right now, I really do want 
you to keep this stuff around.”
Your brain thinks 
THIS is important.
Your brain thinks 
THIS isn’t worth 
saving.

xxviii    intro
how to use this book
So what does it take to learn something? First, you have to get it, then make sure 
you don’t forget it.  It’s not about pushing facts into your head. Based on the 
latest research in cognitive science, neurobiology, and educational psychology, 
learning takes a lot more than text on a page. We know what turns your brain on.
Some of the Head First learning principles:
Make it visual. Images are far more memorable than 
words alone, and make learning much more effective 
(up to 89% improvement in recall and transfer studies). 
It also makes things more understandable.  Put the 
words within or near the graphics they relate 
to, rather than on the bottom or on another page, and 
learners will be up to twice as likely to solve problems 
related to the content.
Use a conversational and personalized style. 
In recent studies, students performed up to 40% better on 
post-learning tests if the content spoke directly to the reader, using a first-person, 
conversational style rather than taking a formal tone. Tell stories instead of 
lecturing. Use casual language. Don’t take yourself too seriously. Which would 
you pay more attention to: a stimulating dinner-party companion, or a lecture?
Get the learner to think more deeply. In other words, unless you 
actively flex your neurons, nothing much happens in your head.  A reader has to 
be motivated, engaged, curious, and inspired to solve problems, draw conclusions, 
and generate new knowledge. And for that, you need 
challenges, exercises, and thought-provoking questions, 
and activities that involve both sides
of the brain and multiple senses.
Get—and keep—the reader’s attention. We’ve all had the “I 
really want to learn this, but I can’t stay awake past page one” experience. 
Your brain pays attention to things that are out of the ordinary, interesting, 
strange, eye-catching, unexpected. Learning a new, tough, technical topic doesn’t have to be 
boring. Your brain will learn much more quickly if it’s not.
Touch their emotions. We now know that your ability to remember something is largely 
dependent on its emotional content.  You remember what you care about.  You remember when 
you feel something. No, we’re not talking heart-wrenching stories about a boy and his dog. 
We’re talking emotions like surprise, curiosity, fun, “what the…?” , and the feeling of “I rule!” 
that comes when you solve a puzzle, learn something everybody else thinks is hard, or realize 
you know something that “I’m more technical than thou” Bob from engineering doesn’t.
We think of a “Head First” reader as a learner.

the intro
If you really want to learn, and you want to learn more quickly and more deeply, 
pay attention to how you pay attention. Think about how you think. Learn how you 
learn.
Most of us did not take courses on metacognition or learning theory when we were 
growing up. We were expected to learn, but rarely taught to learn.
But we assume that if you’re holding this book, you really want to learn about 
project management. And you probably don’t want to spend a lot of time. And since 
you’re going to take an exam on it, you need to remember what you read. And for that, 
you’ve got to understand it. To get the most from this book, or any book or learning 
experience, take responsibility for your brain. Your brain on this content. 
The trick is to get your brain to see the new material you’re learning 
as Really Important. Crucial to your well-being. As important as a 
tiger. Otherwise, you’re in for a constant battle, with your brain doing 
its best to keep the new content from sticking.
Metacognition: thinking about thinking
I wonder 
how I can 
trick my 
brain into 
remembering 
this stuff...
So just how DO you get your brain to think that 
the stuff on the PMP exam is a hungry tiger?
There’s the slow, tedious way, or the faster, more effective way. The 
slow way is about sheer repetition. You obviously know that you 
are able to learn and remember even the dullest of topics if you 
keep pounding the same thing into your brain. With enough repetition, your 
brain says, “This doesn’t feel important to him, but he keeps looking at the same thing over 
and over and over, so I suppose it must be.”
The faster way is to do anything that increases brain activity, especially different 
types of brain activity. The things on the previous page are a big part of the solution, 
and they’re all things that have been proven to help your brain work in your favor. For 
example, studies show that putting words within the pictures they describe (as opposed to 
somewhere else in the page, like a caption or in the body text) causes your brain to try to 
makes sense of how the words and picture relate, and this causes more neurons to fire. 
More neurons firing = more chances for your brain to get that this is something worth 
paying attention to, and possibly recording.
A conversational style helps because people tend to pay more attention when they 
perceive that they’re in a conversation, since they’re expected to follow along and hold up 
their end. The amazing thing is, your brain doesn’t necessarily care that the “conversation” 
is between you and a book! On the other hand, if the writing style is formal and dry, your 
brain perceives it the same way you experience being lectured to while sitting in a roomful 
of passive attendees. No need to stay awake.
But pictures and conversational style are just the beginning.

We used pictures, because your brain is tuned for visuals, not text. As far as your brain’s 
concerned, a picture really is worth a thousand words. And when text and pictures work 
together, we embedded the text in the pictures because your brain works more effectively 
when the text is within the thing the text refers to, as opposed to in a caption or buried in the 
text somewhere.
We used redundancy, saying the same thing in different ways and with different media types, 
and multiple senses, to increase the chance that the content gets coded into more than one area 
of your brain. 
We used concepts and pictures in unexpected ways because your brain is tuned for novelty, 
and we used pictures and ideas with at least some emotional content, because your brain 
is tuned to pay attention to the biochemistry of emotions. That which causes you to feel 
something is more likely to be remembered, even if that feeling is nothing more than a little 
humor, surprise, or interest.
We used a personalized, conversational style, because your brain is tuned to pay more 
attention when it believes you’re in a conversation than if it thinks you’re passively listening 
to a presentation. Your brain does this even when you’re reading.
We included more than 80 activities, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember 
more when you do things than when you read about things. And we made the exercises 
challenging-yet-doable, because that’s what most people prefer.
We used multiple learning styles, because you might prefer step-by-step procedures, while 
someone else wants to understand the big picture first, and someone else just wants to see 
an example. But regardless of your own learning preference, everyone benefits from seeing the 
same content represented in multiple ways.
We include content for both sides of your brain, because the more of your brain you 
engage, the more likely you are to learn and remember, and the longer you can stay focused. 
Since working one side of the brain often means giving the other side a chance to rest, you 
can be more productive at learning for a longer period of time. 
And we included stories and exercises that present more than one point of view, 
because your brain is tuned to learn more deeply when it’s forced to make evaluations and 
judgments. 
We included challenges, with exercises, and by asking questions that don’t always have 
a straight answer, because your brain is tuned to learn and remember when it has to work at 
something. Think about it—you can’t get your body in shape just by watching people at the 
gym. But we did our best to make sure that when you’re working hard, it’s on the right things. 
That you’re not spending one extra dendrite processing a hard-to-understand example, 
or parsing difficult, jargon-laden, or overly terse text.
We used people. In stories, examples, pictures, and so on, because, well, because you’re a 
person. And your brain pays more attention to people than it does to things.

So, we did our part. The rest is up to you. These tips are a

for you and what doesn’t. Try new things.

Drink water. Lots of it.
Your brain works best in a nice bath of fluid. 
Dehydration (which can happen before you ever 
feel thirsty) decreases cognitive function. 
Make this the last thing you read before 
bed. Or at least the last challenging thing.

Create something!
Apply this to your daily work; use what you are 
learning to make decisions on your projects. Just 
do something to get some experience beyond the 
exercises and activities in this book. All you need 
is a pencil and a problem to solve…a problem that 
might benefit from using the tools and techniques 
you’re studying for the exam.
Listen to your brain.
8
Feel something!
Your brain needs to know that this matters. Get 
involved with the stories. Make up your own 
captions for the photos. Groaning over a bad joke 
is still better than feeling nothing at all.
Pay attention to whether your brain is getting 
overloaded. If you find yourself starting to skim 
the surface or forget what you just read, it’s time 
for a break. Once you go past a certain point, you 
won’t learn faster by trying to shove more in, and 
you might even hurt the process.
Talk about it. Out loud.
Speaking activates a different part of the brain. 
If you’re trying to understand something, or 
increase your chance of remembering it later, say 
it out loud. Better still, try to explain it out loud 
to someone else. You’ll learn more quickly, and 
you might uncover ideas you hadn’t known were 
there when you were reading about it.
Part of the learning (especially the transfer to 
long-term memory) happens after you put the 
book down. Your brain needs time on its own, to 
do more processing. If you put in something new 
during that processing time, some of what you 
just learned will be lost. 
Read the “There are No Dumb Questions”
That means all of them. They’re not optional 
sidebars—they’re part of the core content! 
Don’t skip them.
Do the exercises. Write your own notes.
We put them in, but if we did them for you, 
that would be like having someone else do 
your workouts for you. And don’t just look at 
the exercises. Use a pencil. There’s plenty of 
evidence that physical activity while learning 
can increase the learning. 
Slow down. The more you understand, 
the less you have to memorize.
Don’t just read. Stop and think. When the 
book asks you a question, don’t just skip to the 
answer. Imagine that someone really is asking 
the question. The more deeply you force your 
brain to think, the better chance you have of 
learning and remembering.
Cut this out and stick it 
on your refrigerator.
Here’s what YOU can do to

how to use this book
Read me
This is a learning experience, not a reference book. We deliberately stripped out 
everything that might get in the way of learning whatever it is we’re working on at that 
point in the book—although we didn’t take anything out that you might see on the PMP 
exam. And the first time through, you need to begin at the beginning, because the book 
makes assumptions about what you’ve already seen and learned.
The chapters are ordered the same way as the PMBOK Guide
We did this because it makes sense…. The PMP exam focuses on your understanding of 
the PMBOK Guide and the inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques it references. It’s a good 
idea for you to understand the material the way the test organizes it. If you are cross-
referencing this book with the PMBOK Guide, it will really help that the structure has been 
pretty much maintained throughout this book, too.
We encourage you to use the PMBOK Guide with this book.
This book talks about the practical applications of a lot of the ideas in the PMBOK Guide, 
but you should have a pretty good idea of how the guide talks about the material, too. 
There’s some information that’s on the test that isn’t in the guide, so we haven’t limited 
this book to a retread of what’s in the PMBOK Guide at all. But it’s a great reference, and 
you should be cross-referencing the two books as you go. That will help you understand 
all of the terminology better and make sure that there are no surprises on exam day.
The activities are NOT optional. 
The exercises and activities are not add-ons; they’re part of the core content of the book. 
Some of them are to help with memory, some are for understanding, and some will help 
you apply what you’ve learned. Don’t skip the exercises. Even crossword puzzles are 
important—they’ll help get concepts into your brain the way you’ll see them on the PMP 
exam. But more importantly, they’re good for giving your brain a chance to think about 
the words and terms you’ve been learning in a different context.

you are here 4
the intro
The redundancy is intentional and important. 
One distinct difference in a Head First book is that we want you to really get it. And we want you to finish the book 
remembering what you’ve learned. Most reference books don’t have retention and recall as a goal, but this book is about 
learning, so you’ll see some of the same concepts come up more than once. 
The Brain Power exercises don’t have answers.
For some of them, there is no right answer, and for others, part of the learning experience of the Brain Power activities 
is for you to decide if and when your answers are right. In some of the Brain Power exercises, you will find hints to 
point you in the right direction.
We want you to get involved.
Part of being a PMP-certified project manager is getting involved in the community and helping others out. An easy 
way to start doing this is to head over to the Head First forum, where you’ll be able to submit your own Head Libs and 
see what other people have come up with, too:

it stuck. The simulator, like the exam in the back of the book, was developed using the official Project Management

Then, just as the project was about to be completed, someone noticed a 
couple typos, and 10,000 leaflets had to be reprinted.
Two simple typos, and 
now the project is over 
budget and dissatisfying 
to the customer.
Then, when it was time to fix 
those typos, Kate realized that the 
printer was booked for another 
project.
And even though she knew there was a pretty good chance that someone 
else might need the printer, she didn’t have time to come up with a 
backup plan. 
Now the project’s going to be 
late and over budget, and the 
customer won’t be happy. 
The short timeframe didn’t 
give Kate enough time to

Projects don’t have to be this way
Inputs
It may seem like all projects have these types of problems, but there are 
proven solutions to them…and someone else has already done a lot of 
the work for you! Realizing that all projects have common problems with 
solutions, a team of experts put together the PMBOK Guide to pass those 
solutions on to you.
The PMBOK Guide was 
created by a team of 
experts, drawing on the 
collective wisdom of 
many project managers…
…all around the world.
The PMBOK Guide is a 
standard for what PMs 
need to know. It helps 
you avoid those familiar 
problems.
The PMBOK Guide contains 
best practices for dealing 
with problems that happen 
on nearly 
every project.
PMBOK guide saves the day
No book contains all the 
knowledge of project 
management, because it’s 
constantly changing…that’s 
why this book is a guide.

What you need to be a good project manager
Knowledge
If you pay attention to what’s going on 
in the field of project management, you 
can learn from everyone’s successes 
and mistakes so that you can be better 
at your job.
Performance
It’s not enough to know what you need 
to do—you’ve got to deliver, too. This 
one is all about keeping your nose to 
the grindstone and doing good work. 
Personal skills
Since you’re managing people, you’ve 
got to pay attention to what motivates 
them and what makes things harder 
on them. Your job as a PM is to make 
personal connections with your team 
and help keep everybody on the right 
track. 
The PMBOK Guide is full of practical tools that can help you manage your 
projects better. But all of that doesn’t mean much if you don’t have the 
three core characteristics of a successful project manager. You’ve got to pay 
attention to all three if you want to make your project a success. This is what 
you’ll need if you’re going to take on the role of project manager: 
core job duties
This means knowing all of the tools and 
techniques in the PMBOK Guide and how 
and when to use them. 
You and your team will 
have to work hard to 
deliver a successful 
project, too. 
As a PM, you’ve got to lead your team 
through the project lifecycle, so you 
need to be skilled at managing people 
if you’re going to be successful, even if 
they don’t report to you directly.

Not paying attention to these characteristics is sure to give your project problems. Which of the 
characteristics of a successful project manager was neglected in the failed projects listed below? 
Sometimes, more than one will apply; just pick the one that makes the most sense to you.
The project was delivered early, but 
it didn’t have all of the features that 
the customers asked for. The VP 
had suggested a new requirements 
gathering technique, but the PM 
shot it down because he’d never 
heard of it.
The project was late because the 
team couldn’t meet the company’s 
standards for productivity. They 
were always coming into work late 
and leaving early and taking long 
lunches. It seemed like the project 
manager just didn’t think the project 
was important. 
The project was late because the 
team cut corners that led to sloppy 
work, and they had to go back and 
fix all of their mistakes. 
The project manager thought his 
job was to meet the deadline above 
all else. So he demanded that the 
product be released on the date it 
was due, regardless of quality. The 
team wanted to create a high-
quality product, and they fought 
with the PM throughout the project 
to try to get him to change his mind. 
In the end, the team washed their 
hands of the product after it was 
released and refused to support it. 
The project manager refused 
to learn to use the scheduling 
software and templates the 
company had bought for the 
team. Instead, he kept track of 
the schedule in his head and on 
his whiteboard. Near the end of 
the project, he realized that he’d 
forgotten about some important 
tasks, and his ship date slipped by 
two months.

introduction to the pmp exam
Q:  How can the PMBOK Guide claim 
to be the entire body of knowledge for 
project management?
A:  Actually, it doesn’t claim that at all. 
That’s why the PMBOK Guide is called “A 
Guide to the Project Management Body 
of Knowledge.” It’s a reference book that 
organizes a lot of information about how project 
managers do their jobs—but it doesn’t claim 
to have all the information itself. Instead, it 
provides you with a framework for managing 
projects and tells you what information you 
need to know. 

A lot of people are surprised to find out that 
there are a bunch of things on the PMP exam 
that are never explicitly mentioned in the 
PMBOK Guide. (Don’t worry: we’ll cover that 
stuff in the rest of this book.) There’s a whole 
lot of information that modern project managers 
should know about risk management and time 
management and cost and quality…and you’re 
expected to learn more about the knowledge 
areas as you move forward in your career. 
That’s why you should never limit your study 
to just what’s in the PMBOK Guide. It’s meant 
only as a guide to all of the knowledge areas 
that project managers use on the job.
Q: What if I don’t do all of this stuff in 
my job?
A: The PMBOK Guide isn’t necessarily 
meant to be followed like a recipe for every 
project. It’s a broad collection of many tools 
and processes that are used across the project 
management profession, and project managers 
have a lot of discretion about how they run their 
projects. So you shouldn’t throw out all that 
you’re doing at work and replace it with every 
single one of the tools in this book immediately. 
But you’ll notice as you go that some of the 
tools you’re learning about will solve problems 
for you on the job. When you find places where 
these tools can help, you really should start 
using them. Seriously, it’s the best way to learn. 
You might find that your projects go better after 
you start using a new concept that you learn 
while you study. 
Q: I’ve heard that there are a whole 
bunch of formulas you have to memorize 
for the PMP exam. Will I have to do that?
A: Yes, but it won’t be that bad. The 
formulas are actually really useful. They help 
you understand how your project is doing 
so you can make better decisions. When 
you read about them later in the book, you’ll 
focus on how to use them and why. Once 
you know that, it’s not about memorizing 
a bunch of useless junk. The formulas will 
actually make sense, and you’ll find them 
intuitive and helpful in your day-to-day work.
Q: Aren’t certification exams just an 
excuse that consultants use so that they 
can charge their clients more money?
A: Some consultants charge more money 
because they are certified, but that’s not 
the only reason to get certified. The best 
reason to get PMP Certification is because 
it helps you understand all of the project 
management concepts available to help you 
do your job better. If you learn these tools 
and apply them to your job, you will be a 
better project manager. And hey, if it turns out 
you can make more money too, that’s great.

What’s more, it’s worth keeping in mind that 
for a project manager, being PMP-certified is a 
requirement for a large amount of contracting 
work, especially in government, and it’s 
increasingly seen in job postings of all kinds. 
Some employers won’t even interview project 
managers who don’t have a PMP Certification!
Q: Doing all of the stuff in the PMBOK 
Guide seems like it will take a long time. 
How much of this really applies to me?
A: That’s a great question. You might find 
that there are documents that are mentioned 
in the PMBOK Guide that you’re not used 
to writing or creating for your projects, and 
some planning steps that you’ve never taken 
before. That’s because the PMBOK Guide is a 
framework, not a recipe for a successful project.

When you get your certification, it means 
that you have a solid understanding of all of 
the tools and techniques that are typically 
used by project managers to plan projects, 
track them, and deal with problems that 
come up along the way. It doesn’t mean that 
you follow the exact same recipe for project 
success every time you lead a project. 
Q: But I work for a company that always 
runs projects on really tight deadlines. You 
can’t honestly expect me to write a bunch 
of project documents and use all of these 
formulas for my projects.
A: One of the useful things that you’ll 
learn in Chapter 8 of this book is that 
sometimes the processes that seem like a 
lot of work up front actually end up saving 
you time in the end. 

If you find a problem in a two-hour planning 
meeting that would’ve cost you two weeks to 
fix, then that two hours you spent planning 
actually saved your project two weeks of time. 
A lot of the planning and documentation that 
you’ll be tested on is there to help you head 
off problems before they derail your project. 
So in the end, doing all of that work up front 
and writing it all down can actually make your 
project go faster and be cheaper than not doing 
it would’ve been! 
The PMBOK Guide is just a guide, but if you understand all the material 
in it, then you’ll ultimately be a better project manager.

know your environment
Understand your company’s big picture
Your project is an important part of the work your company is doing, but 
you need to understand how it fits in to the higher-level strategy your 
company is executing, too. That’s where programs and portfolios come in. 
Portfolio
A portfolio is a group of projects 
or programs that are linked 
together by a business goal. 
If an architecture firm was 
venturing into remodelling 
existing buildings as well as 
designing new ones, it might 
split its efforts into separate 
New Construction and 
Remodelling portfolios, since 
the goals for each are quite 
different. 
Program
A program is a group of 
projects that are closely 
linked, to the point where 
managing them together 
provides some benefit. The 
firm knows from experience 
that creating huge skyscrapers 
is dramatically different than 
building residential homes, so 
residential home construction 
would be its own separate 
program. 
Project
A project is any work that 
produces a specific result and is 
temporary. Projects always have 
a beginning and an end. Building 
a house is a classic example of 
a project. Projects can be part 
of programs or portfolios, but 
portfolios and programs can’t be 
part of a project. 
Portfolios might include 
programs and projects. 
Programs are groups of 
projects that should be 
managed together. 
New

Projects have a beginning 
and an end and produce 
something specific. 
Projects in a program are often 
dependent on each other. Program 
management focuses on these 
interdependencies.

introduction to the pmp exam
Business 
value is the 
sum of all of 
the things 
your company 
is made of, 
from desks 
and chairs 
to people 
and the 
intellectual 
property they 
produce. 
Your project has value
Think about the projects you’ve worked on in your career. Each one of them did something 
beneficial for your company. You might’ve created a product and sold it to customers to make 
money directly. You might’ve made someone’s job easier by automating work that would’ve 
taken time and effort to do. No matter how you count the benefit you created when you 
completed your project, that benefit is the real reason that your company decided to do the work 
in the first place. That benefit has an impact on the overall business value of the company 
you work for. Sometimes it can be easy to spend so much time dealing with your project’s issues 
that you lose track of the goals you set out to achieve. It’s important to think about the value of 
your project with every decision you make. 
Portfolio
Portfolio managers divide up 
the projects, programs, and 
operations your company is 
doing so that they align with 
business goals. That way, they 
can be sure that projects get 
the most out of managing 
their timelines, budgets, and 
resource commitments so that 
the company’s goals are met. 
Program
Program managers focus on 
the places where projects 
depend on each other and 
coordinate activities to make 
sure that the work gets done in 
the most direct way possible. 
Project
Project managers keep the 
team focused on the business 
value the project is providing. 
By constantly helping each 
team member to understand 
how his or her work impacts 
the project’s value, project 
managers make sure that 
everyone on the team makes 
the best decisions to keep the 
project on track.

common ground
Portfolios, programs, and projects have a lot in 
common
We’ve talked about the differences between portfolio management, program 
management, and project management, but there are a lot of similarities between 
them too. 
Professions with proven processes
Portfolio managers and program managers have a set of proven processes, tools, and 
techniques that have been used to manage many successful programs and portfolios. 
Like the PMP, the Project Management Institute offers certifications in Portfolio (PfMP) 
and Program Management (PgMP) too. 
Deal with constraints
Portfolio managers need to prioritize work in environments with limited 
resources, budgets, risk tolerance, and many other constraints that set up 
the environment for their portfolio’s success. Program managers need to 
manage groups of projects that are being produced by the same resource 
pool or from the same budget. Project managers often have predefined 
schedules, resource constraints, and scope requirements to manage. All 
three need to use the processes, tools, and techniques that have worked 
for other managers to balance all of the constraints in their business 
environments.  
Business value
Portfolio managers prioritize work to meet a company’s strategic goals. Managing a 
program is all about keeping track of resources and other constraints affecting groups 
of projects so that all of those projects can achieve some shared benefit. Projects, on 
the other hand, are about managing the work to achieve some result. A portfolio’s 
strategic goals, a program’s shared benefit, and the result of that project add business 
value to your company.

introduction to the pmp exam
Portfolios, programs, and projects all use charters
All of the work you do to initiate, plan, execute, control, and close your project 
helps your program and portfolio managers understand how your project is doing 
and keep it on track. Following all of the processes in the PMBOK Guide will ensure 
that the programs and portfolios of which your project is a part always know how 
you’re doing and what you’ll accomplish. While there are many differences in the 
documents that are used in portfolio and program management, all three use a 
charter to define their objectives. 
Charter
Portfolios, programs, and projects all use a 
charter to define their goals and initiate work. 
A charter lists any known constraints and 
goals and gives the manager authority to get 
the work started. 
	
	
We’ll talk about the project charter 
in depth in Chapter 4.
While the charter is used in projects, 
programs, and portfolios, you really 
only need to focus on the project charter for the exam. We’ll 
spend a lot of time on the project charter later in the book. 
Portfolio charter
A portfolio charter will lay out the 
strategic benefits that a portfolio 
is going to accomplish. It will list 
all of the programs and projects 
included in the portfolio. 
Program charter
A program charter will define 
the shared benefit that the 
program is achieving as 
well as the list of projects it 
includes. 
Project charter
A project charter gives a 
project description, summary 
schedule, and business case, 
and assigns a project manager.

Ranch Hand Games: Portfolio Charter

Project Description: The Online Gaming Portfolio 
Market research shows that console gaming and PC gaming will not increase as fast 
as the online market in the coming fiscal year. Ranch Hand has launched a number of 
programs to target the online gaming market and increase our market share by 10% in 
the next 15 months. 
The following programs and projects are part of the Online Gaming Portfolio
Programs:
 • Online Arcade Program 
 • Online Gaming Sales and Marketing Campaign 
 • Server Upgrade Program
 • Online Store Program
Projects:
 • Cows Gone Wild II
 • Zarthak and the Flugelhorn
Ranch Hand Games: Program Charter
Project Description: The Online Arcade Program 
This is a targeted rewrite of all of our early games from the late 1980s and early 1990s 
for the online gaming market. All of these products will be released at the same time 
to coincide with a major trade show. Since many of these games were created using 
shared code, they’ll need to be managed together to make configuration management 
easier and coordinate development activities.

A portfolio manager will monitor 
the combined performance of all 
of the programs and projects 
to evaluate how the portfolio 
is doing. 
This program needs to 
be managed because 
all of the projects 
in it share code. If 
the projects were all 
managed independently, 
there would be time and 
effort wasted on all of 
the project teams trying 
to coordinate with one 
another. 
Portfolios contain 
both programs 
and projects.

You’ll need to know the difference between a portfolio, a program, and a project on the exam. Which 
one of those does each story below describe? 
A consulting company wanted to 
increase the amount of billable time 
for each consultant, so it started 
several company-wide programs 
to help consultants to get more 
productivity out of each year. 
A university wanted to build 
admissions websites for all of its 
departments. It realized that all 
of the sites would be feeding into 
the same registration interface 
and decided to manage all of them 
together in order to save time. 
A company wanted to switch from 
a paper-based Human Resources 
group to a software-based one. It 
spent some time looking into the 
best software packages for the 
job, and decided to manage all of 
the HR functions together since it 
needed the same people to help 
with all of the work. 
A company wanted to build a better 
reporting interface so that it could 
have more accurate data on year-
end goals.  
A software game company wanted 
to build up its online presence. It 
started several marketing and 
sales initiatives, created some new 
games, and rewrote some old ones 
in order to reach more gamers 
online.  
A construction company bid on 
several parking garage projects at 
the same time. It won one of the 
bids, and built the garage a month 
under schedule and $5,000 under 
budget.

introduction to the pmp exam
Temporary
Projects always have a start and a finish. They start when you 
decide what you are going to do, and they end when you’ve created 
the product or service you set out to create. Sometimes they end 
because you decide to stop doing the project. But they are never 
ongoing.
What a project IS…
… and what a project is NOT
Creating a unique result
When you create the product of your project, it is measurable. If 
you start a project to create a piece of software or build a building, 
you can tell that software or that building from any other one that 
has been produced. 
Operations are ongoing. If you’re 
building cars on an assembly line, 
that’s an operation. If you’re 
designing and building a prototype 
of a specific car model, that’s a 
project. 
Progressively elaborated
You learn more and more about a project as it goes on. When you 
start, you have goals and a plan, but there is always new information 
to deal with as your project progresses, and you’ll always have 
to make decisions to keep it on track. While you do your best to 
plan for everything that will happen, you know that you will keep 
learning more about your project as you go. 
Projects are NOT: always strategic or critical
Projects are NOT: ongoing operations (or processes)
Projects are NOT: always successful
You might also see the word “process” 
instead of “operation.” A team might run a 
project to build software, but the company 
might have an ongoing process for keeping 
the servers that run the software from 
going down. In fact, the group that keeps 
those servers running is often called “IT 
Operations.” Get it?

introduction to the pmp exam
A day in the life of a project manager
You probably already know a lot of what a project manager does: gets a project 
from concept to completed product. Usually a project manager works with a 
team of people to get the work done. And PMs don’t usually know a lot about the 
project when they start. When you think about it, you can categorize pretty much 
everything a project manager does every day into three categories. 
Even though you’re constantly gathering requirements, managing stakeholders, and working within 
constraints, different situations can call for different tools for dealing with all of those challenges. 
When you think about it, all of the tools and techniques that are discussed in the PMBOK Guide are 
there to help you do those three things at different points in your project’s lifecycle. That’s why the 
PMBOK Guide divides up the work you do on a project into the five process groups. The groups help 
you organize all of the work you do as your project progresses and keep your role in the project 
straight. 
Gather product requirements
Being a project manager almost always means figuring out what you’re going to build. 
It’s one of the first things you do when you start to plan the project! But as you go, 
you are always learning more and more. Sometimes that can mean changes to your 
product, while other times it’s just more detail on what you already knew. 
Deal with project constraints
Sometimes there will be constraints on the project that you’ll need to 
deal with. You might start a project and be told that it can’t cost more than 
$200,000. Or it absolutely MUST be done by the trade show in May. Or you 
can do it only if you can get one specific programmer to do the work. Or 
there’s a good chance that a competitor will beat you to it if you don’t plan it 
well. It’s constraints like these that make the job more challenging, but it’s all 
in a day’s work for a project manager. 
Manage stakeholder expectations
There are a lot of people involved in making most projects happen: the team that 
actually does the work, the people who pay for it, everybody who will use the product 
when you’re done, and everybody who might be impacted by the project along the 
way. Those people are called your stakeholders. And a big part of the PM’s job is 
communicating with everybody and making sure their needs are met.
One of the most important 
stakeholders is the sponsor. 
That’s the person who provides 
financial and political support 
for the project.
You’ll need to use your 
interpersonal skills to keep 
everyone on the same page.
You’ll learn all about the 
process groups in Chapter 3!

Which of these scenarios are operations, and which are projects?
Q: Do project constraints just mean 
restrictions on time and cost?
A: No. A project constraint is any 
limitation that’s placed on your project before 
you start doing the work. It’s true that project 
managers are really familiar with time and 
cost constraints, because those are really 
common. But there are lots of other kinds of 
constraints, too.

Here’s an example. Let’s say that some of 
your team members won’t be available for 
three weeks because they have to attend a 
mandatory training session. That’s called a 
resource constraint, because some of your 
project resources (people you need) are 
restricted.

There are lots of other kinds of constraints, 
too: risk constraints, scope constraints, and 
quality constraints.
Q: Wait a minute—a quality 
constraint? Shouldn’t I always run my 
project to build high-quality products?
A: Of course. But quality is more 
important for some projects than it is for 
others, and as a project manager, you need 
to be realistic about it.

If you’re running a project to build a 
playground, quality is important. You don’t 
want to build unsafe playground equipment, 
because children could get hurt. Does that 
mean that you spend the highest possible 
portion of your budget on quality? Take a 
minute and think about how you’d approach 
quality for that project, as compared to, 
say, a project to build a heart monitor for 
a medical device company. It’s likely that 
quality is a much more important constraint 
for the heart monitor than it is for the 
playground.

introduction to the pmp exam
How project managers run great projects
There are plenty of ways that you can run a project; people have been running projects for 
about as long as civilization has been around. But some project managers run their projects 
really effectively, while others consistently come in late, over budget, and with poor quality. So 
what makes the difference between a great project and one that faces challenges?
That’s exactly the question that the folks at the Project Management Institute asked when they 
started putting together their Guide to the Project Management Body of  Knowledge. They surveyed 
thousands of project managers and analyzed tens of thousands of successful and unsuccessful 
projects to come up with a structured way of thinking about how to effectively run a project.
One goal of the PMBOK Guide is to give you a repeatable way to run your projects. It does so 
by breaking the work down into 47 processes that describe different, specific kinds of work 
that project managers do. To help you understand how those processes fit together, they came 
up with two different ways to think about them. Each process falls into one of the five process 
groups, which tell you the sequence that the processes are performed on a project. But the 
PMBOK Guide is also a tool for organizing knowledge about project management, so each 
process also falls into one of 10 knowledge areas. The PMBOK Guide is organized around these 
knowledge areas…and so is this book!
There are also 10 knowledge 
areas that help organize 
the processes to make 
them easier to learn and 
understand.
The PMBOK Guide describes 
47 processes your project 
will go through from start 
to finish.
It has five process groups 
that show you the order 
that the processes happen 
on a project, and how they 
interact with one another.
Head First PMP has one 
chapter per knowledge 
area…and so does the 
PMBOK Guide.
Each process is assigned to a process 
group, and it’s also in a knowledge area.

22    Chapter 1
my PMO is so controlling
Project management offices help you do a good job, every time
Every project your company completes can teach you a lot about what works and 
what doesn’t within your company’s culture. Project management offices 
(PMOs) help you to learn from all of the work that’s been done in the past. They’ll 
give you the templates and the guidance you need to make sure your project takes 
the right approach and makes sense to everyone you work with. There are three 
different kinds of PMOs that you might run into in your career. 
Controlling
PMOs that control the way project management is done in a company will 
be able to check that you’re following the processes they prescribe. Like 
supportive PMOs, they’ll tell you what templates you should fill out and 
prescribe a framework for doing project management in your company. 
They’ll also periodically review the work that you’re doing on your project to 
make sure you’re following their guidelines. 
Directive
PMOs that take a directive approach actually provide project managers to 
project teams. In a directive PMO, the project manager usually reports to the 
PMO directly. That reporting structure makes sure that the project managers 
follow the frameworks and templates prescribed by the PMO, because their 
job performance depends on it. 
Supportive
PMOs that play a supportive role provide all of the templates you need to fill out 
while your project is under way. They’ll lay out the standards for how you should 
communicate your project’s scope, resources, schedule, and status as your project 
progresses from its initial stages through to delivery and closing.
Directive 
PMOs have a 
lot of control 
over the way 
things are done 
on projects.

introduction to the pmp exam
Good leadership helps the team work together
It’s not enough to have a good plan and all the resources you need to make your project a 
success. You need to think about your interpersonal skills if you want to keep your project 
on track. Here are a few examples: 
Some teams can be so motivated 
by the value of the project that 
their personal goals are secondary 
to making the project a success. 
When that happens, they can be 
really productive as a team.
Leadership
A good leader gets the team to see 
the end goal and focus on getting 
there. With the right leadership, team 
members feel like they can take 
control of the work they’re doing, and 
make good decisions to help the 
team achieve its goals as directly as 
possible. 
Team building and trust 
building
Everything you do to help team members feel 
like they can rely on one another is part of team 
building. When a team feels like they’re all working 
together to achieve the project’s goals, they’re 
able to do so much more than each of them can 
do individually. Trust building is all about sharing 
information with all of your stakeholders so that 
they know they can trust one another. 
Motivation
Some people are motivated by the kind of work they do, some are looking for 
experience that will help their résumés, and others are hoping for a promotion or a pay 
raise. Understanding what motivates your team members and helping them to achieve 
their personal goals will help your project, too. 

24    Chapter 1

Coaching
As the people on your team grow and take on new responsibilities, 
they might want some help developing new skills. That’s where 
coaching comes in. When you coach people, you help them 
develop their skills and get better at what they do. Sometimes this 
means helping them find training, while other times it’s just acting 
as a sounding board to help your team members sort through the 
problems they run into. 
Influencing
Sometimes you need to collaborate with others to get 
your work done. When you influence people, you focus 
on the shared benefit of the work with them and share 
power toward a common goal. You’re probably using your 
influence to make things happen every day on the job. 
Conflict management
When people work together, there will always be 
disagreements. A good project manager works to find 
positive solutions when conflicts pop up. 
Political and cultural awareness
It’s important to make sure that everybody on the team feels 
included. You need to be aware of the topics that might alienate 
people or make them feel uncomfortable, so that you can maintain 
an open and inclusive environment on your team. 
You usually can’t just 
tell people to do what 
you want and have them

Project teams are made of people
Keeping your team motivated and helping them to feel included are just a couple of the 
interpersonal skills that make your project a success. You also need to help your team 
members work through problems and maintain an environment where it’s easy for everyone 
to get along. Here are a few more interpersonal skills that a good project manager uses 
to keep the team on track: 
Can you think of a time when one of these skills helped your team succeed on a past project?
A good PM is always 
looking for ways to help 
the team get better at 
what they do. 
We’ll talk more about conflict 
management in Chapter 13. 
There are a few more interpersonal skills discussed in 
the PMBOK Guide that we’ll talk about along the 
way:
* Communication (Chapter 10 is all about 
communication).
* Negotiation and decision making (we’ll talk more 
about those in Chapter 9).

introduction to the pmp exam
Q: Directive and controlling PMOs 
seem pretty similar to me. What’s the 
difference again?
A: That’s a good question. Both of them 
are pretty active in managing the projects 
they govern, but there are some differences. 

Controlling PMOs tend to review the work 
a project team does at various points in the 
project to make sure that they are following 
the company’s agreed-upon process. The 
people who work in the controlling PMO are 
like auditors who take a look at a project 
team’s work products to make sure they’re 
complying with the company’s project 
management rules. 

Directive PMOs actually manages the 
projects on their own. The people who 
work in the PMO take on the role of project 
manager for all of the projects the PMO is 
responsible for. 
Q: My company doesn’t have a PMO 
at all. Do the 47 processes apply only to 
companies that have PMOs? How much 
of what’s in the PMBOK Guide applies to 
plain old project managers who aren’t in 
a PMO?
A: Yes! The PMBOK Guide is all 
about project management, and all of the 
processes it talks about are meant to be 
used on projects to help them succeed. If 
your company has a PMO, following the 47 
processes will help you work with that PMO. 
But if you don’t have a PMO where you work, 
it’s still good for a project to follow all 47 of 
them.
Q: Does the PMP exam test you on 
your interpersonal skills?
A: Yes. You need to know what all of 
the interpersonal skills are and when you 
would use them in managing your project. 
Interpersonal skills are an important part of 
managing a team. If your team members 
each feel like their opinion is valued and they 
are motivated to do good work, you’ll have a 
much better chance at success.
Q: Hold on, how are team building and 
coaching different?
A: Another good question. Team building 
usually means going out, having lunch, doing 
group exercises, and in general socializing 
as a team so that the group gets more 
familiar with one another and can have a 
better internal set of relationships. Coaching 
is about identifying your team members’ 
talents and helping them develop them.

Say a member of your team is really good 
at explaining technical concepts to other 
people. You might want to coach that person 
to write project documents that will help the 
whole team understand what they’re doing 
better. That would let the team member get 
better at using her talent, and also help with 
team communication.

Operations management handles the processes that 
make your company tick 
Think about all of the processes your company goes through every day to keep 
things running smoothly. You probably have worked with operations teams 
on many of your projects—from accounting departments to support teams to 
infrastructure teams who maintain software environments. Each operations 
team is staffed with specialists in the aspect of your company that they run. 
Sometimes, you’ll work with them to build out parts of your project; sometimes, 
you’ll depend on them to do work before your project can proceed. Operations 
teams are almost always stakeholders in your projects. 
You’ll learn more about 
stakeholders when we talk about 
stakeholder management in 
Chapter 13. 
Operations management will 
direct, oversee, and control the 
business processes you work with 
on your project every day.

exam questions answers
1. Answer: B
Although PMOs are usually value-driven, that’s not a valid type of PMO. The three types of PMOs are supportive, 
controlling, and directive. Supportive PMOs provide templates and guidelines for running projects, controlling PMOs 
audit projects to ensure adherence to processes and standards, and directive PMOs provide project managers to 
manage projects.
 2. Answer: B
A project doesn’t have to be strategic or critical. It only needs to be temporary, have a specific result, and be 
progressively elaborated.
3. Answer: A
Since the initiatives are being managed together because of a strategic business goal, you can tell that this is a 
portfolio. 
4. Answer: D
The sponsor is the person who pays for the project. The project manager doesn’t usually play that role.
5. Answer: B
Brainstorming is an activity that you do with other people, but it’s not an interpersonal skill that you need to hone to help 
manage all of the stakeholders on your project. 
6. Answer: A
Coaching is really about helping your team members to get better at what they do. Anything you do to challenge them 
to develop their skills is coaching. 
7. Answer: D
Since a portfolio can be a group of programs and projects, option D is the one that’s not true. It can be a group of 
programs, but it doesn’t have to be.

Exam Questions
Answers
8. Answer: A
Your knowledge of earned value management techniques is how you can predict that the project will be 
over budget. Knowing that could help you plan ahead to avoid further cost overruns. Minimally, it can help 
you to reset expectations with your stakeholders so they have a better idea of what’s coming.
9. Answer: C
This is a resource constraint, because the project manager’s resources—in this case, the people who will 
be testing the software—are not going to be available to her when she needs them. Yes, this will cause 
problems with the quality, introduce risks, and cause schedule problems. But they’re not schedule, time, or 
risk constraints, because there’s no outside limitation placed on the project quality, schedule, or risks. The 
only outside limitation is the resource availability. If they were available, there wouldn’t be a problem!
10. Answer: C
The way that the project manager interacts with the people on his team interfered with his work getting 
done. This is a good example of how a lack of personal skills can lead directly to major project problems 
down the line, and it’s why this particular project manager needs to work on his personal skills.

42    Chapter 2
Kate’s got three major options when looking at the kinds of organizations she can work 
for. Functional organizations are set up to give authority to functional managers, 
projectized organizations give it to the PM, and matrix organizations share 
responsibility and authority between the two. 
There are different types of organizations
Functional
Weak Matrix
Balanced Matrix
Matrix organizations
All of the project work typically 
happens within a particular department, 
and that department’s manager is 
completely in charge of everything. 
Project coordinators are like 
expediters, except that coordinators 
typically report to higher-level 
managers and have some decision-
making ability. Expediters have no 
authority at all. 
Folks who work in 
a balanced matrix 
organization report 
to a project 
manager AND a 
functional manager 
equally. 
ó
ó
Project management decisions 
need to be cleared with 
functional managers.
ó
ó
Project managers are assistants to 
the functional managers in getting 
the work done. 
ó
ó
Project managers spend a lot of 
time doing administrative tasks 
and often only work as PMs part 
of the time. 
ó
ó
You’re likely to find project 
expediters in functional 
organizations.
ó
ó
PMs have some authority, 
but they aren’t in charge of 
the resources on a project. 
ó
ó
Major decisions still need to 
be made with the functional 
manager’s cooperation 
or approval.
ó
ó
Project expediters (like Kate) 
and project coordinators 
can work in weak matrix 
organizations, too.
ó
ó
Project managers share 
authority with the 
functional managers.

decisions by the functional 
manager, but the functional 
manager runs his project 
decisions by the PM, too.

Strong Matrix
Projectized
For the PMP exam, most questions 
assume that you work in a matrix 
organization unless they say otherwise. 
If you’ve worked 
with a contractor or 
consulting company, 
they are usually 
organized like this. 
ó
ó
Project managers have more 
authority than functional 
managers, but the team still 
reports to both managers.
ó
ó
The team might be judged 
based on performance on 
their projects, as well as on 
their functional expertise. In 
a strong matrix, delivery of 
the project is most important. 
ó
ó
Teams are organized 
around projects. When 
a project is done, the 
team is released, and 
the team members 
move on to another 
project.
ó
ó
The project manager 
makes all of the 
decisions about a 
project’s budget, 
schedule, quality, and 
resources.
ó
ó
The PM is responsible 
for the success or failure 
of the project.
The project manager has the most authority 
and power in a projectized organization.
Wait a 
second. Not all 
companies will fit 
into one of these five 
categories, will they?
Good point. 
Sometimes companies will use multiple organization types to get 
different kinds of projects done. Those organizations are called 
composite organizations. 

44    Chapter 2
Q: I’m still not clear on the difference between a project 
coordinator and a project expediter.
A: They’re actually pretty similar. A project expediter is somebody 
who keeps track of status but has no decision-making authority on a 
project at all. A project coordinator is someone who does pretty much 
the same thing, but does get to make some of the minor decisions 
on the project without having to run them by the functional manager. 
Coordinators usually report to somebody who is pretty high up in 
the organization, while expediters are more like assistants to the 
functional manager. Both of them usually exist in weak-matrix or 
functional organizations. 
Q: What’s the difference between the way teams are run in a 
functional organization and a projectized one?
A: Think of a major bookkeeping project being run by the Admin 
department. Usually the head of Admin is the one who is ultimately 
responsible for what happens to it. If a project manager is called 
in to help out, she’s just there to keep things straight for the Admin 
department manager. The team is made up of people who already 
report to the Admin manager, so nobody questions his authority. 
That’s an example of a functional organization. 

Contrast that with the way the bookkeeping project would be run if a 
consulting company that specialized in bookkeeping were contracted 
to do it. The company would assemble a team of bookkeepers and 
assign a project manager to lead them. When the project was over, 
the team would dissolve, and the team members would go join other 
teams working for other project managers. That’s how a projectized 
organization works. The team is organized around a project and not 
around a job function. 
Q: Can I be an effective PM in a functional organization?
A: Since project managers don’t have much authority in a 
functional organization, it’s hard to have as much impact in a 
functional organization as you would in a matrixed or projectized one. 

Of course, you can be good at your job in any kind of organization. 
But, for your company to really get the most out of having project 
managers on staff, it really pays for it to look into changing the way 
it balances power. The project managers who are accountable for 
project success or failure should also have the chance to influence 
the team, budget, and schedule for those projects. 
Q: Does the PMP exam favor any kind of organization?
A: When you’re taking the PMP exam, if you see a question that 
mentions a PM, then you should assume that the question is asking 
about a matrix organization if it doesn’t say up front which kind of 
organization is being described. Functional organizations are usually 
painted in a negative light because they tend to give less authority to 
project managers. 
who’s in charge? 
¢
¢ Functional managers have all the power in a functional 
organization. Project managers have the power in a 
projectized organization.
¢
¢ If a question on the exam doesn’t state an organization 
type, assume it’s referring to a matrix organization. 
That means the PM is responsible for making budgets, 
assigning tasks to resources, and resolving conflicts.
¢
¢ Project coordinators and expediters don’t exist in a 
projectized organization.
¢
¢ A project expediter keeps track of project status only. 
A project coordinator has some authority, and usually 
reports to someone higher up in the company. Neither 
role has as much power or authority as a real project 
manager, even though expediters or coordinators may 
have “Project Manager” printed on their business cards.

Kate takes a new job
Welcome aboard, 
Kate! I’m Ben, the 
Functional manager.
Kate: Hi, Ben. I’m excited to be here. It’s such a 
relief to be hired as a project manager, and not just 
a project expediter anymore.
Ben: We’re excited too, since you’ll be taking care 
of our main software development project. It’s in 
maintenance mode right now.
Kate: Sounds great. How do we handle that here?
Ben: Well, we’re constantly getting business reports 
from the field, and when people think of new ideas, 
we just add them to the project.
Kate: Umm…so how do you know when you’re 
done?
Ben: We’re never really done; we try to release new 
versions as often as possible.
Ben
Kate’s spent a lot of time studying for the PMP exam, and the first 
thing she learned was that a project is temporary. When she sees 
ongoing work that doesn’t really have a start or a finish, it’s not a 
project at all. Ben asked Kate to do operational work, which has 
no beginning and no end. Since there’s no way for Kate to know 
when she’s done, it will be harder for her to be successful at her job. 
And that makes her nervous!

Operational Work
A Project
I’ve been meaning to sit down and talk to you for 
a while.
Really? I thought you were too busy doing your 
day-to-day business to care too much about us 
projects. 
Hey, don’t knock that day-to-day work! It’s your 
bread and butter. If I weren’t here keeping the 
lights on, there’d be no chance for you to go 
out and build all of the flashy stuff you do. It’s 
thankless work keeping the business running, I’ll 
give you that, but where would you be without me?
There you go again...“thankless work.” Give 
me a break. Eveybody knows that you 
represent all of the work the business does on 
an ongoing basis. You’re the work that keeps 
the computers running, and the paychecks 
flowing. You’re the systems upgrades and the 
maintenance...all of the work that has no 
definite beginning and end. 
You make it possible for me to break new 
ground. You’re a great supporting player. You 
make it easy for me to be a star! While I’m out 
there expanding the business, you’re making 
sure we can take care of our old stuff. Er, I 
mean, you’re maintaining our core work. 
I’m out there every day making progress, 
building new products, and changing the way 
that you do business. Yeah, I do feel like a star! 
I’m sorry you can’t see how important I am. I 
guess we’ll just never agree on this one. 
Don’t patronize me. I know you think you’re pretty 
hot because everybody wants to know when you’ll 
be done and how much you’ll cost. But remember, 
you’re temporary. When you’re done producing your 
product, you close down and I’ll be left to maintain 
the systems you create. Not only are you nothing 
without me, you have an expiration date. Still feel 
like a star?

organizations, constraints, and projects
Anyone who will be affected by the outcome of your project is a stakeholder. It’s 
usually pretty easy to come up with the first few people on the list of affected people. 
The sponsor who’s paying for the project, the team who’s building it, and the people in 
management who gave the project the green light are all good examples. But it can get a 
little tricky as your project gets going. You might start with that core group of people and 
find that the number keeps growing as time goes on. It’s your job as a project manager to 
find all of the stakeholders who are influential in your project and keep them updated on 
where your project is going. Making sure that their expectations are managed can be the 
difference between your project succeeding and failing. 
Stakeholders are impacted by your project
Not all of the people you’re working with are rooting for your project to succeed. Sometimes, 
the people you’re working with think that your project might bring negative consequences for 
them. Ben’s worried that bringing any kind of planning into his company will slow down his 
team. Kate’s going to have to manage his expectations and work with him to set goals 
that make sense to him if she’s going to bring him around to supporting her work. You need 
to know what’s motivating all of your project stakeholders if you’re going to understand the 
influence they’ll have over your project. 
Negative stakeholders
One of the first things you’ll do when you start a project is figure out who your stakeholders 
are and write down their goals and expectations in a stakeholder register. That’s part of 
the Identify Stakeholders process that you’ll learn more about in Chapter 13 of this book. 
Even though you do that work up front, you’ll find that new stakeholders are always popping 
up, and you’ll need to make changes to your stakeholder register to include them as you learn 
about them. 
Identify stakeholders
I hope Kate doesn’t 
do anything to 
slow down my 
development team.
You’ll learn more about how 
the Identify Stakeholders 
process helps you understand 
their goals and expectations 
in Chapter 13.
Kate might not think 
about Ben’s goals when 
she starts planning her 
project, and that could 
cause problems for her. 
It may sound like having 
a negative stakeholder 
is a really bad thing, 
but if Kate can turn 
Ben around then he’ll 
be a great ally in the 
future.

different kinds of stakeholders
Take a minute to think about all of the stakeholders who’ve ever had something 
to do with the projects you’ve worked on in the past. Making sure that they are all 
informed and helping your project to succeed is the point of Project Stakeholder 
Management, one of the 10 knowledge areas that are covered in the PMBOK Guide. 
Let’s take a look at some of the kinds of stakeholders that will impact your project. 
More types of stakeholders
Sponsor
The sponsor is the person who pays for the 
project. Without the sponsor’s help, there’s no 
way the project can be a success. 
Seller
You might license software 
or contract consultants to 
help you build your product. 
The companies you work 
with to help you deliver it 
are stakeholders in your 
project’s success too. 
Consumers or users
Usually, you build a product or service so that 
someone can buy or use it. You have to make 
sure your project meets the customer’s needs if 
you want to call it successful. 
Business partner
Your company might contract a company to 
provide training or other materials that affect 
your project. They’re important stakeholders of 
your project too. 
Functional manager
If you’re building an accounting software 
package, you’re going to need accounting 
expertise to understand what you’re building. 
Functional managers provide the subject matter 
expertise to make things run smoothly on your 
project. 
Organizational 
Groups
You might not think about it 
at first, but there are many 
ways that groups outside 
your team can be affected 
by your project. Your sales 
team, your internal support 
teams, all kinds of groups 
inside your company 
will have a stake in your 
project’s success

Can you name the project team role from the list of stakeholder roles on the opposite page for each

Project Team Role:
1. The project was nearly complete and it 
was time to have it tested for acceptance 
by the people who would need to use it

3. The company contracted an external 
vendor to build a big component of the 
product. The vendor met with the team 
everyday so that they could make sure 
there were no integration problems 
between the part they were building and 
the part the rest of the team was working 
on. 
When you think about it, most of the roles we just talked about have a place on your 
project team too. When you think about your team, it’s easy to focus on the PM and the 
project staff. But your team can be comprised of roles from many different stakeholder 
organizations. Think about all of the stakeholder organizations that might help you 
deliver the product of your project by actually assigning people to your project team.

54    Chapter 2
When Kate thinks about solutions, she’s going to have to deal with 
the project’s constraints. Every project, regardless of what is being 
produced or who is doing the work, is affected by the constraints of 
time, scope, cost, quality, resources, and risk. These constraints have a 
special relationship with one another, because doing something to deal 
with one of the constraints always has an effect on the others. 
Managing project constraints 
Your project will 
always have to stay 
within a budget.
Your project 
will need to 
get done on 
schedule.
You need to manage 
the scope of work 
you do for the 
project.
constrained optimism
If you don’t manage all six constraints at the 
same time, you risk managing in favor of just 
one constraint.
For Kate’s project to succeed, she needs to think about the project 
constraints. If she doesn’t manage these six constraints at the 
same time, she’ll find that her project is either late, over budget, or 
unacceptable to her customers.
Any time your 
project changes, 
you’ll need to 
know how that 
change affects all 
of the constraints.
Unexpected 
obstacles can 
wreck your 
project if you 
don’t deal with 
this one. 
If your product 
doesn’t do what 
it’s supposed to do, 
you wont succeed.
You have to have

materials to get 
the work done.

talking about quality.
Whenever you make

Resources are people or

for your project, and when 
you cut corners you end up

Did you get different answers? That’s okay! For this exercise, a good case 
can be made for almost any of the constraints. Don’t worry about which 
answer is “right” for now – it’s more important to get some practice 
thinking about projects in terms of constraints. And when you get to the 
actual exam questions, there will always be a clear, correct, BEST answer.

organizations, constraints, and projects
Q: I’ve heard project constraints referred to as the triple 
constraint. But there are six of them here. What gives?
A: Some project managers focus on Cost, Scope, and Time as 
the main constraints of a project. But just thinking about those three 
constraints doesn’t give a clear picture of all of the constraints you 
need to account for when planning a project. The important thing 
here is to understand that Cost, Time, Scope, Quality, Risk, and 
Resources are all related to each other. You need to pay attention to 
all of them and if you manage your project in favor of one of them, it 
will affect the others. 
Q: I’ve heard of an old saying: “Faster, cheaper, better—pick 
two,” but doesn’t that mean that there are only two constraints 
that you can manage at any given time?
A: No, that’s an old (and somewhat cynical) project management 
saying. When a project manager says it to a customer or stakeholder, 
what he is saying is that there’s no way to reduce cost, shorten the 
schedule, and increase quality all at the same time. At least one 
of those things absolutely has to give… but the saying is a little 
disingenuous! We already know that all six of the constraints are 
related to each other, and there’s almost never an easy, obvious 
trade-off where you can sacrifice one to improve the others.

Q: What if I know that a change will impact just scope, but 
not schedule or cost or any of the other constraints. Can I go 
ahead and make it?
A: Whenever you are making a change that affects the project 
constraints, you need to be sure that the change is acceptable to 
your stakeholders. They’re the people who will be impacted by your 
project. The term applies to your team, your customer, your sponsor, 
and anybody else who is affected by the change. 

A lot of project management is about evaluating what a change is 
going to do to your project constraints, and using that impact analysis 
to help stakeholders make choices about what to do when changes 
come up. Sometimes a change that affects the quality of your product 
is completely unacceptable to your stakeholders, and they would 
rather delay the project than sacrifice the product’s quality. 
Q:In my organization, we have some projects that would 
sound like they’re functional and some that are fully projectized. 
Where does that kind of organization fit in? 
A: Sometimes a company that mostly runs their projects in a 
functional way will create a special team that gives the project 
manager more authority. When a company manages using many 
different types of organizational structure, it’s called a composite 
organization. 
Q: I don’t quite get this whole negative stakeholder thing. 
Why do I care about people who aren’t helping me with my 
project?
A: Think of it this way: sometimes a project might have really 
good overall outcome for your company, but it might make some 
of the people who are impacted by it uncomfortable. (Here’s a 
quick example: think about another project manager who won’t 
get to use the resources he planned on because they’re taken up 
by your project.) Change can be really hard for people to adapt to, 
and sometimes your stakeholders are not going to be happy about 
changes that your project is making. It’s important to know how 
negative stakeholders feel, and understand why they’re resistant to 
your project. 

You need to identify and manage the expectations of all of the 
stakeholders who have influence over your project if you’re going 
to succeed. So don’t take it personally if there are people out there 
who aren’t as enthusiastic about your project as you are. Use it as an 
opportunity to find out what your project can do to get buy-in from the 
negative stakeholders out there. 
Q: You mentioned that it’s possible to “turn around” a 
negative stakeholder. How does that work?
A: Today’s negative stakeholders can become tomorrow’s 
advocates if you make sure their needs are met. By listening to 
them, taking their needs into account, and making changes to your 
project so that those needs are satisfied, those previously negative 
stakeholders will feel good about what you’re doing... and they’ll 
often become your closest allies in the future.
A stakeholder is anyone who is affected either 
positively or negatively by your project.

different kinds of stakeholders
You can’t manage your project in a vacuum 
Even the best project managers can’t control everything that affects their 
projects. The way your company is set up, the way people are managed, the 
processes your team needs to follow to do their jobs... they all can have a big 
impact on how you manage your project. On the exam, all of those things are 
called Enterpise Environmental Factors. 
Risk Tolerance
Some companies are 
highly tolerant of risk 
and some are really risk 
averse.

business and when they 
change, it can have a big

Kate’s project needs to follow company processes
Here’s a project governance 
document from our past 
projects. Maybe this will 
help you as you start to get 
your plan together.
Kate: This will really come in handy. There’s an 
organization chart that describes all of the teams and 
people that will rely on our project. Wow. There’s also a 
whole process for escalating issues that come up.
Ben: I wanted to make sure we didn’t re-invent the 
wheel when we drew up the plans for our development 
project.
Kate: This will make my life a lot easier. One question 
though: I don’t see any guidelines for project acceptance. 
How do we know if a project is a success?
Ben: Usually our sales team takes the new features out 
in the field and they let us know what the response is. 
If our customers like what we’ve done, the project is a 
success. If not, well... you get the picture.
Kate: Umm… that sounds a little hard to manage. 
Briefcase 
with project 
governance 
documents 
inside.
It’s a lot harder for a project to be successful if the team doesn’t have 
a clear goal in mind. Kate’s project needs to follow all of the company 
governance guidelines, but she also needs to write down the goal her 
team is shooting for. That way, it will be clear that the project has 
met its goals when it completes. Most projects aim to finish within the 
constraints we talked about in the last chapter (time, cost, resources, 
quality, risk, and scope). It helps to write down concrete goals for those 
constraints as acceptance criteria up front. That way there are no 
surprises when the project ends.

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: B
Scale is not a project constraint. The constraints are Scope, Time, Cost, Quality, Resource, and Risk.  
2. Answer: C
There is no mention of the project being late or missing its deadlines in the example. The project was over 
budget, which affects the project’s cost. The project won’t meet the stakeholder’s requirements, which is a 
quality problem. And the staff was more expensive than planned, which is another cost problem.
3. Answer: A
Building a purchase order system for accounts payable is a project. It’s a temporary effort that has a unique 
result. 
4.Answer: D
When a stakeholder is negatively impacted by your project, you need to manage his expectations and help 
him to buy into your project.
5. Answer: B
The stakeholder register is where you identify all of the people who are impacted by your project. 
6. Answer: D
A program is a group of projects that should be managed together because of interdependencies. A 
program charter fits the description in this question. 
7. Answer: C
A portfolio charter will give the business goal that a group of projects and programs will accomplish as part 
of a portfolio.
Usually there’s some benefit to 
the company by managing them 
together.

8. Answer: A
Since the project manager has to ask permission from the functional manager and can’t overrule him, she’s 
working in a functional organization.
9. Answer: C
The Project Manager in this scenario can overrule the functional manager, so she’s working in a Strong Matrix 
organization. If it were a projectized organization, she wouldn’t have to get permission from the functional 
manager at all because she’d be the person with authority to assign resources to projects.
10. Answer: C
Since the project manager is filling out the form because of a company policy. This is a good example of an

The process framework
3
It all fits together
All of the work you do on a project is made up of processes.   
Once you know how all the processes in your project fit together, it’s easy to remember 
everything you need to know for the PMP exam. There’s a pattern to all of the work that 
gets done on your project. First you plan it, and then you get to work. While you are doing 
the work, you are always comparing your project to your original plan. When things start 
to get off-plan, it’s your job to make corrections and put everything back on track. And the 
process framework—the process groups and knowledge areas—is the key to all of 
this happening smoothly.
We’re using 
process groups 
and knowledge 
areas to do our 
part!

Projects are like recipes
All projects, no matter how big or small, break down into 
process groups. Process groups are like the steps you use 
when following a recipe.
Needs
Initiating
process group
This is where you figure 
out what it is you 
need: a huge product, 
or maybe just some 
homemade cookies.
Planning
process group
Then you initiate your 
project—researching and 
deciding what you’re going 
to build to fulfill the 
project’s needs.
Next, you determine what 
“ingredients” you already have 
and which ones you still need. 
You’ll figure out where to get 
those missing resources, and 
think about what they’ll cost.

This is where you actually

Another large part of 
project management is keeping 
an eye on everything that’s 
happening, and adjusting 
processes as needed. So as 
you’re mixing, you check that 
the consistency is right, and 
you keep an eye on the oven 
temperature while baking.
This is where the bulk of the 
project work is done.

just going through a phase
Success!
Needs
If your project’s really big, you can manage it in phases
A lot of project managers manage projects that are big or complex, or simply need to be done in stages because of 
external constraints, and that’s when it’s useful to approach your project in phases. Each phase of the project goes 
through all five process groups, all the way from Initiating to Closing. The end of a phase is typically a natural point where 
you want to assess the work that’s been done so that you can hand it off to the next phase. When your project has 
phases that happen one after another and don’t overlap, that’s called a sequential relationship between the phases.
Success!
Needs
Success!
Needs
The first phase is to build 
the main website for a 
project; when it’s online 
and the site is up, the 
project manager delivers 
a complete result that’s 
ready to go, and then 
starts on the next phase.
Creating forums and a 
blog for the site required 
the same team, so this 
project has sequential 
phases, which means the 
second phase can’t start 
until the first one ends.
Every phase must go through 
all five process groups, which 
means the new phase needs 
to be initiated—just like a 
project!
When your project has sequential phases, 
each phase starts after the previous phase 
is 100% complete.
Each phase needs to 
go through the Closing 
processes when it’s complete.
You’re managing a large web development project...
...and here’s 
where the 
project ends.

the process framework 
Iteration means executing one phase while planning the next
There’s a third approach to phased projects that’s partway between sequential and overlapping. When 
your phases have an iterative relationship, it means that you’ve got a single team that’s performing 
the Initiating and Planning processes for one phase of the project while also doing the Executing 
processes for the previous phase. That way, when the processes in the Executing and Closing process 
groups are finished, the team can jump straight into the next phase’s Executing processes.
Iteration is a really effective way to run certain kinds of software projects. Agile software 
development is an approach to managing and running software projects that’s based on the idea of 
iterative phases.
Phases can also overlap
Sometimes you need teams to work independently on different parts of the 
project, so that one team delivers their results while another team is still 
working. That’s when you’ll make sure that your phases have an overlapping 
relationship. But even though the phases overlap, and may not even start at 
the same time, they still need to go through all five process groups.
Success!
Needs
Success!
Needs
This project has two 
overlapping phases. In this 
case, they don’t start at 
the same time—the first 
phase’s team needs to get 
started before the team 
for the second phase.
When the second phase 
begins, it needs to go through 
the Initiating process group 
independently, even though the 
first phase is already in the 
Executing processes.
The first phase is set to deliver 
while the second is still executing... 
but for some projects you might 
have an overlapping phase that 
ends before the previous phase. 
As a result, overlapping phases 
can get pretty complicated to 
manage! That’s why overlapping 
phases can increase risk, because 
your team might have to do a lot 
of rework.
Executing

Closing

Initiating

Planning

While the team’s in Executing for the first phase, 
they’re also in Initiating and Planning for the second one.
When the team is done with 
the first phase, the second 
one’s already planned, so 
they can jump right into the 
Executing processes!
This is a really good 
way to deal with an 
environment that’s 
very uncertain, or 
where there’s a lot 
of rapid change. Does 
this sound like any of 
the projects you’ve 
worked on?
Since one team is planning one phase while 
executing another, this means the whole 
team (INCLUDING designers, testers, 
etc.) is usually working at the same time.

Taking a vacation is simple, even though there are several steps.
Forty-seven processes might seem like a lot to remember, but once you’ve been using
them for a while, they’ll be second nature—just like all the things you do without thinking 
when you go on a trip.
Break it down
Within each process group are several individual processes, which is 
how you actually do the work on your project. The PMBOK Guide breaks 
every project down into 47 processes—that sounds like a lot to know, but 
don’t start looking for the panic button! In your day-to-day working life, 
you actually use most of them already…and by the time you’ve worked

Inputs
Outputs
Anatomy of a process
You can think of each process as a little machine. It takes the inputs—information 
you use in your project—and turns them into outputs: documents, deliverables, and 
decisions. The outputs help your project come in on time, within budget, and with high 
quality. Every single process has inputs, tools and techniques that are used to do the 
work, and outputs.
All of the processes in the 
PMBOK Guide work 
like this.
Here’s where you put all the information 
you need to do your work (like templates 
for your documents or policies and rules 
that your company follows—that kind 
of thing).
All the project 
work happens here. 
The tools and 
techniques take 
the inputs and 
turn them into 
outputs.
All the things you make during your 
project are outputs—documents, 
plans, schedules, budgets, and the 
actual product that you’re building.

the process framework 
Ok, I understand 
how this works for 
vacations and cookies, 
but 47 processes on every 
project? You’ve got to be 
kidding me…
These processes are meant to 
work on any type of project.
The processes are there to help you organize 
how you do things. But they have to work on 
small, medium, and large projects. Sometimes 
that means a lot of processes—but it also 
ensures that what you’re learning here will 
work on all your projects.
Q:  Can a process be part of more than 
one process group?
A:  No, each process belongs to only 
one process group. The best way to figure 
out which group a process belongs to is to 
remember what that process does. If the 
process is about defining high-level goals 
of the project, it’s in Initiating. If it’s about 
planning the work, it’s in Planning. If you 
are actually doing the work, it’s in Executing. 
If you’re tracking the work and finding 
problems, it’s in Monitoring and Controlling. 
And if you’re finishing stuff off after you’ve 
delivered the product, 
that’s Closing.
Q: Do you do all of the processes in 
every project?
A: Not always. Some of the processes 
apply only to projectized organizations or 
subcontracted work, so if your company 
doesn’t do that kind of thing, then you 
won’t need those processes. But if you 
want to make your projects come out well, 
then it really does make sense to use the 
processes. Even a small project can benefit 
from taking the time to plan out the way 
you’ll handle all of the knowledge areas. If 
you do your homework and pay attention to 
all of the processes, you can avoid most of 
the big problems that cause projects to run 
into trouble!
Q: Can you use the same input in 
more than one process?
A: Yes. There are a lot of inputs that show 
up in multiple processes. For example, think 
about a schedule that you’d make for your 
project. You’ll need to use that schedule 
to build a budget, but also to do the work! 
So that schedule is an input to at least two 
processes. That’s why it’s really important 
that you write down exactly how you use each 
process, so you know what its inputs and 
outputs are.
Your company should have records 
of all of these process documents, 
and the stuff the PMs learned 
from doing their projects. We call 
these things “organizational process 
assets,” and you’ll see a lot of them 
in the next chapter.

82    Chapter 3
Combine processes to complete your project
Sometimes the output of one process becomes an input of the next 
process. In the cookie project, the raw ingredients from the store are 
the outputs of the planning process, but they become the inputs for the 
executing process, where you mix the ingredients together and bake them:
The output of the mixing 
process—the cookie 
dough—becomes an input 
to the cooking process.

The final output of the 
cooking process is cookies.

Communication is a really

This one is another area that a lot 
of PMs don’t have much experience 
with. It’s all about selecting suppliers, 
contractors, and vendors, and setting 
up contracts with them. 
Since the PMBOK Guide covers 
projectized organizations, it talks 
about actually acquiring your team 
as a process, too. People in most 
organizations don’t get a chance 
to do that. The team is often 
determined by the time you get 
assigned to it.

Q:  So what’s the difference between process groups 
and knowledge areas?
A:  The process groups divide up the processes by function. 
The knowledge areas divide up the same processes by subject 
matter. Think of the process groups as being about the actions 
you take on your project, and the knowledge areas as the 
things you need to understand.

In other words, the knowledge areas are more about helping 
you understand the PMBOK Guide material than about running 
your project. But that doesn’t mean that every knowledge 
area has a process in every process group!  For example, 
the Initiating process group has only two processes. The 
Risk Management knowledge area has only Planning and 
Monitoring and Controlling processes. So the process groups 
and the knowledge areas are two different ways to think about 
all of the processes, but they don’t really overlap. 
Q: Is every knowledge area in only one process group?
A: Every process belongs to exactly one process group, 
and every process is in exactly one knowledge area. But a 
knowledge area has lots of processes in it, and they can span 
some, or all, of the groups. Think of the processes as the core 
information in the PMBOK Guide, and the process groups and 
knowledge areas as two different ways of grouping 
these processes.
Q: It seems like the Initiating and Planning process 
groups would be the same. How are they different?
A: Initiating is everything you do when you first start a 
project. You start by writing down (at a very high level) what 
the project is going to produce, who’s in charge of it, and what 
tools are needed to do the work. In a lot of companies, the 
project manager isn’t even involved in much of this. Planning 
just means going into more detail about all of that as you learn 
more about it, and writing down specifically how you’re going 
to do the work. The Planning processes are where the project 
manager is really in control and does most of the work.
Process groups and 
knowledge areas 
are two different 
ways to organize the 
processes…but they 
don’t really overlap 
each other! Don’t get 
caught up trying to 
make them 
fit together.
process groups are about actions

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: C
The Executing process group is the one where the team does all the work. You’ll get a good feel for the 
process groups pretty quickly!
 2. Answer: D
One of the hardest things that a project manager has to do on a project is figure out who all the 
stakeholders are. The project manager, the team, the sponsor (or client), the customers and people who 
will use the software, the senior managers at the company—they’re all stakeholders. Competitors aren’t 
stakeholders, because even though they’re affected by the project, they don’t actually have any direct 
influence over it.
3. Answer: C
The Procurement Management knowledge area deals with contracts, contractors, buyers, and sellers. If 
you’ve got a question about a type of contract or how to deal with contract problems, you’re being asked 
about a Procurement Management process.
 4. Answer: A
People who will be directly affected by the project are stakeholders, and when you’re creating a list of 
them you’re performing the Identify Stakeholders process. That’s one of the two processes in the Initiating 
process group.
5. Answer: D
In a weak matrix, project managers have very limited authority. They have to share a lot of responsibility 
with functional managers, and those functional managers have a lot of leeway to make decisions about 
how the team members are managed. In an organization like that, the project manager isn’t given a lot of 
responsibility.
That’s why you’re likely to 
find a project expediter 
in a weak matrix.

6. Answer: C
The work of an IT support department doesn’t have an end date—it’s not temporary. That’s why it’s 
not a project. Now, if that support team had to work over the weekend to move the data center to a 
new location, then that would be a project!
I see-so even when 
something is a 
process and not a 
project, there could be 
projects related to it.
7. Answer: B
Agile development is a really good example of an iterative approach to project phases. In an agile 
project, the team will typically break down the project into phases, where they work on the current 
phase while planning out the next one.

8. Answer: B
If there’s an increased risk of a project because one phase can’t start until another one ends, that means your project 
phases aren’t overlapping. When you’ve got overlapping phases, that means that you typically have multiple teams 
that start their phases independently of one another.

Also, take another look at answer C, because it’s an important point about overlapping phases. When your 
phases have an overlapping relationship, there’s an increased risk of rework. This typically happens when one 
team delivers the results of their project, but made assumptions about what another team is doing as part of their 
phase. When that other team delivers their work, it turns out that the results that both teams produced aren’t quite 
compatible with each other, and now both teams have to go back and rework their designs. This happens a lot 
when your phases overlap, which is why overlapping phases have an increased risk of rework.
9. Answer: D
In a projectized organization, the project manager has the power to assign tasks, manage the budget, and release the 
team.
10. Answer: A
The first things that are created on a project are the charter (which you create in the Develop Project Charter process) 
and the stakeholder register (which you create in the Identify Stakeholders process). You do those things when you’re 
initiating the project.

The teachers are thrilled…for now
Larry convinces the teachers to travel in June because of the great price he got on 
tickets. But he’s not really planning for the results of that decision—and neither 
are the teachers.
One of the keys of project management is thinking a project through before 
starting the work, so problems that could arise down the line are anticipated 
ahead of time. That’s why so much of project management is spent planning.
Larry may think this 
itinerary is a plan, but it 
doesn’t detail any of the 
problems that could arise 
on the teachers’ vacation.
Larry changed the date to 
June, and now the project’s 
coming in way under budget.

The day-to-day work of a project manager
Project managers make projects run well. They plan for what’s going 
to happen on the project. A big part of the job is watching closely to 
make sure the plan is followed, and when things go wrong, making sure 
they’re fixed. And sometimes the plan itself turns out to be inadequate! 
Project managers look for those kinds of problems, and fix them 
too. That day-to-day work is what the Integration Management 
processes are all about.
First you get assigned 
to a project.
Then you plan out all the 
work that will get done.
Then you make sure the 
work is done properly, 
dealing with changes 
along the way.
And once it’s finished, 
you close out 
the project.
A bird’s-eye view of a project
Every project follows the same kind of 
pattern. First it gets initiated, then planned, 
then executed (and monitored), and finally 
closed. That’s why the process groups are 
so useful—they’re a good way to think 
about how you do the work.
For a large project, you’ll often see this 
pattern repeated several times. Each major 
chunk of deliverables is treated as its own 
subproject that goes through all of the 
process groups and processes on its own.
So you always need to 
use the processes in the 
Closing group, even when 
it’s a subproject of a 
larger project.
Here’s where every 
project or 
subproject begins.
This is done by 
the process 
in the Initiating
group.
Three Executing and 
Monitoring and Controlling 
processes make sure the 
project runs smoothly.

102    Chapter 4
The six Integration Management processes
Without the project charter, 
you don’t have the authority 
to tell your team what to do 
and when to do it.
A big part of the Project Management plan is 
that it tells you how to handle changes when 
problems come up.
the integration management processes
The PMBOK Guide divides Integration Management into six processes that you 
need to understand for the exam. They’re what people usually think of as a 
project manager’s “core” responsibilities.
Develop Project Charter
The very first thing that’s done on a new project is the 
development of the project charter. That’s the document that 
authorizes you to do your work. But you’re not always involved in 
making it—oftentimes it’s handed to you by the sponsor.
1
 Develop Project Management Plan
The Project Management plan is the most important document in the 
entire PMBOK Guide because it guides everything that happens on the 
project. It spans all of the knowledge areas.
2
Develop
Project Charter
Develop Project 
Management 
Plan
The sponsor is the 
person who pays 
for the project.
 Direct and Manage Project Work
After you’re done planning, it’s time to do the work. Your job is to 
make sure that everybody is doing what they should be doing, and 
that the products or services your project creates meet the needs of the 
stakeholders.
3
Here’s where the work gets done. It’s where all of 
the planning you’ll do in all of the other knowledge 
areas comes together so that you can actually make 
stuff. It’s the day-to-day work that you help your 
team do, and make sure gets done.  

you are here 4    103
project integration management
Keep everyone satisfied by catching 
problems as early as possible.
Once you catch problems, this is where 
you figure out how to fix them—or if 
they should be fixed at all.
 Monitor and Control Project Work
A good project manager is constantly monitoring every single thing that 
goes on in the project. Remember, the later you find a problem, the 
harder and more expensive it usually is to fix.
4
 Perform Integrated Change Control
Once you’ve found problems on your project, you’ve got to work with your 
stakeholders and sponsors to figure out how to deal with those problems. 
You should also update your Project Management plan to reflect any extra 
steps you’ll need to take to complete the project. Updating the Project 
Management plan also makes sure everyone working on the project stays on 
the same page.
5
Close Project or Phase
The last thing you do on the project is close it out. Make sure you 
document everything…especially the lessons you and your team have 
learned along the way. You can never tell when these lessons may help 
you out on your next project.
6
Keep an eye out for potential changes. Part 
of your job is helping the people around you 
anticipate changes, and maybe even prevent them.

Start your project with the Initiating processes
All you need to get your project started are the only two processes in the 
Initiating process group. First, the Develop Project Charter process 
tells everyone in the company why the project is needed, and gives you 
the authority you need to make it happen. Then you use the Identify 
Stakeholders process to figure out who is affected by the project and 
how to communicate with them.

the output from the first 
process and the input to the 
second. It means the project 
officially starts and you’re 
authorized to work on it.
Everything you know 
about the work that 
needs to get done 
These are the only 
two processes in the

The Develop Project Charter process
The teachers’ contract 
said that they needed to 
go to Asia and Europe for 
$7,500 per person. You’d 
better make sure that 
shows up on the charter.
Since this project will be done at 
Acme Travel, Acme’s work culture 
will affect it. At Acme, everyone 
gets a two-hour lunch every day, 
so the schedule will need to take 
that into account. 
This is a description of the 
business need, the scope, and 
how the project fits into the 
strategic plan.
If you work in a matrix organization, then your team doesn’t report to you. 
They report to functional managers, and might have other work to do. But 
when they’re on your project, you’re effectively their boss. So how do you make 
that happen? Well, you need some sort of authorization, and that’s what the 
project charter is for. It says exactly what you’re authorized to do on the project 
(like assign work to the team members and use the company’s resources), and 
why you’ve been assigned to it. But the charter isn’t just important for matrix 
companies. In any kind of company, it’s really important to know who’s in charge, 
and what resources you have available to you when you manage a project.

Make the case for your project
A business case 
document says 
why it’s worth 
it to spend 
money on the 
project.
The Midwestern Teachers’ Association contract wasn’t the only one that Acme 
could have taken. The company’s got more work than it can handle right now, 
and occasionally it needs to turn away a client. That’s where a business case 
comes in handy. If a project is too risky, won’t make enough money, isn’t strategic, 
or isn’t likely to succeed, then the senior managers at Acme could choose to pass 
on it.
But to figure all that out, you need to do some thinking about what makes taking 
on this project a good idea for Acme Travel.  Preparing a business case means 
thinking about the value of the project to business. Is there a big market for world 
travel packages that Acme can break into if it does this project? Should Acme do 
it just because the customer requested it? Will it help the company in other ways?  
BUSINESS CASE DOCUMENT
Midwestern Teachers’ Association World Tour
Project Description: A group of teachers from Minnesota wants to take a trip 
around the world, starting with Mumbai, India, and ending somewhere in Europe. 
Strategic Analysis:   Taking on this project would give Acme Travel Agency 
an edge over most of the other travel agencies in town that don’t offer travel 
packages to southeast Asia.  The only travel agencies in the area that offer this 
kind of package charge about $500 more for the package than our clients are 
willing to pay.  By offering the package at the cost the Teachers’ Association has 
suggested, we’ll make around $700 profit on the trip and still be able to undercut 
the closest competition. 
Intangible Benefits: The agents who work on this trip will gain experience 
booking travel in Asia, and that will help us with some other prospects that have 
expressed interest in similar trips.  
Related Projects: This project is similar to the 2007 Handbell Enthusiasts 
European Tour we managed. If all goes well, we should be able to use the 
outcome of this project as leverage to win the travel planning job for the 
Midwestern High School Horticulture Club World Tour that’s coming up in 2011.  
Conclusion: It’s in Acme’s best interest to do this project. 
This project 
will make the 
company money.  
Doing this project 
will not only profit 
the company, but 
also might win it 
further business. 
Acme needs 
more Asia Travel 
specialists. This 
project will help 
train them.

Use expert judgment and facilitation 
techniques to write your project charter
When you think about it, a lot of different people’s opinions can help your company 
come to a good decision about whether or not to start a project. Sometimes project 
sponsors will call on experts to help them decide which projects to do. At Acme Travel, 
the CEO called a meeting with the VP of Asia Travel to make sure that the teachers’ 
trip was worth doing. The VP of Asia Travel had set up trips like this one before and he 
knew where things could go wrong in planning them. Together, they looked at all of the 
project documentation to make sure that this project looked like it would make Acme 
enough money to be worth doing.  
Your company might need to talk to subject matter experts from a bunch of 
different departments to decide if a project will be beneficial to it. It might rely on 
outside consultants or industry groups to tell it how other companies have solved 
the same problem. All of those different opinions are called expert judgment. 
If the experts agree that the project’s business case, contract, and statement of 
work all add up to a product that’s going to do good things for your company, 
they’ll usually give the green light to write the charter. 
Facilitation techniques help everyone understand 
the goal of your project
When you sit down to write your project charter, you’ll need to 
get your stakeholders on the same page about what your project 
team will do. You might set up meetings with your stakeholders 
to brainstorm project goals or work with them to resolve conflicts 
around how your project will run.  All of the approaches you 
take to get everybody on the same page are called facilitation 
techniques.

Project Charter
Project Description: World vacation in 4 weeks
 A group of teachers from Minnesota wants to take a trip around the world, starting with
Mumbai, India, and ending somewhere in Europe. They have contracted Acme Travel
Agency to make their dream a reality. 
Project Requirements:
 • Trip should be planned to coincide with good weather. 
 • Need to see famous monuments at each point of destination. 
 • Restaurant recommendations and nightlife information on request.
 • Need assistance for missed flights, lost luggage, and other issues in transit.
Assigned Project Manager and Authority Level:
You have the authority to use dedicated money and resources to accomplish this goal.
Summary Milestone Schedule
 June  13–20—Mumbai	
June  20–23—Hong Kong 
 June 24–29—Shanghai	
June 30–July 4—Rome
 July 5–8—Barcelona	 	
July 9–14—Paris 
Business Case:
This project will be a sound investment for Acme. Provided it is planned and executed properly,
we should receive around $700 per person in profit.
SIGNED,

As the project charter 
officially assigns the PM, 
it can be written before 
the PM is even involved.
The charter assigns you the authority to use 
resources, like people on your team, computers, 
office equipment, conference rooms—the things 
you need to get the job done.
This project has one 
sponsor, but it’s OK if 
a project has more than 
one.

Organizational
process assets
Enterprise
environmental factors
Two things you’ll see over and over and over…
There are two inputs that you’ll see repeatedly for a bunch of different processes 
throughout the rest of the book. Enterprise environmental factors are anything 
that you need to know about how your company does business. And organizational 
process assets have information about your projects: how people in your company 
are supposed to perform them, and how past projects have gone.
Can you think of how these would be useful for starting and planning your project?
Enterprise environmental factors tell you about 
how your company does business.
There’s a lot of information about your company that will be really 
useful to you when you’re planning your project. You need to know 
how each of the different departments operates, the market conditions 
you’re working in, the company’s overall strategy, any policies you 
need to work with, your company’s culture, and all about the people 
who work at the company.
One of the enterprise environmental factors you’ll use in the 
Integration Management processes is the work authorization 
system, which determines how your company assigns work to people 
and ensures that tasks are done properly and in the right order.
Organizational process assets tell you about how 
your company normally runs its projects.
Every company has standards for how to run its projects. There are 
guidelines and instructions for managing projects, procedures you 
need to follow, categories for various things you need to keep track of, 
and templates for all of the various documents that you need to create. 
These things are usually stored in some sort of library.
One of the most important organizational process assets is called 
lessons learned, which is how you keep track of valuable historical 
information about your project. At the end of every project, you sit 
down with the project team and write down everything you learned 
about the project. This includes both positive and negative things. 
That way, when you or another project manager in your company 
plans the next project, you can take advantage of the lessons you 
learned on this one.
The Project 
Management 
plan template 
is an 
organizational 
process asset, 
too.

116    Chapter 4
Q:  I’ve never had a project charter. Is it really necessary?
A:  Yes, definitely. Have you ever been on a project where you 
didn’t feel like you had enough authority to do your job? The project 
charter gives you the authority to manage your project. Every project 
should have a charter, and writing the charter is the first thing that 
should happen on any project. 

Q: Wait a minute! How can I be the one writing the charter, 
when it’s what gives me all of my authority and I might not even 
be assigned to the project yet?
A: Right, you’re not usually going to write a charter. The charter is 
usually handed to you. The project sponsor usually writes the charter. 
And it’s always easy to tell who the project sponsor is: the sponsor is 
the person who pays for the project, and comes up with the project’s 
overall goals.

Q: I’m still not sure I get the idea behind a business case 
document. How’s that different from the project charter?
A: The business case is a description of what your company 
is trying to get out of the project—like how much money you’re 
planning on making from the project, how it will benefit parts of your 
organization, and future business you might gain from the project.

The project charter is a high-level description of your project. It tells 
you—and anyone else who needs to know about your project—what 
you’ll be delivering, including a really high-level description of what it 
is that you’ll build.

A really important difference between them is that the project charter 
is what authorizes the project manager to do the work, while the 
business case helps give justification for the project. You can think of 
the business case as the background research that had to be done 
in order to make sure the project was worth doing, and the project 
charter as the thing that formally announces the decision to do it.
Q: I’m still not clear on who the sponsor is. How’s that 
different than the customer?
A: The sponsor is the person (or people) paying for the project. 
The customer is the person who uses the product of the project. 
Sometimes the customer is the same person as a sponsor. This is 
often true in consulting companies. For the teachers’ project, the two 
sponsors are the CEO and VP of Asia Travel, and the customers 
are the teachers. But it’s possible that in another travel agency, the 
teachers themselves would be the sponsors. This happens a lot in 
contracted work. 

For the exam, you’ll need to be careful about this. Sometimes you’ll 
see the word customer in a question that’s asking you about the 
sponsor. You might even see the word client—a word that appears 
in the PMBOK Guide only four times! (It’s usually used when you’re 
talking about procurement.) When you see this, you should assume 
that the question is asking you about a consulting situation, where 
the sponsor, customer, and client are all the same person.
Q: Hold on. My project sponsors are really important people 
in my company. I can’t imagine them actually typing up a project 
charter.
A: Good point. That’s why the project sponsor will often delegate 
the actual creation of the charter to the project manager. For the 
exam, though, keep in mind that the sponsor is ultimately responsible.
The sponsor of a project is responsible 
for creating the project charter.
The sponsor of a project pays for the 
project. The PM manages the project.
no dumb questions
The CEO and VP of Asia Travel are paying for this 
project in the sense that they’re providing funding for 
the project team at the travel agency and cutting 
checks to the airlines, hotels, tour groups, etc. The 
customers are definitely paying Acme Travel, but 
they’re not paying out the budget for the specific 
work that has to be done to complete the project.


The project charter officially sanctions the project. Without a charter, the project 
cannot begin.

The sponsor is the person (or people) responsible for paying for the project and is part 
of all important project decisions.

Develop Project Charter is the very first process performed in a project.

The project charter gives the project manager authority to do the project work, and 
to assign work or take control of project resources for the duration of the project. It 
also gives the project manager authority to spend money and use other company 
resources.

Facilitation techniques (like brainstorming) are ways to get all of your stakeholders on 
the same page about your project goals and your approach to meeting them.

The business case tells everyone why the company should do the project. It’s an 
input to building the project charter that tells everyone that the project actually started, 
explains what it’s going to deliver, and authorizes the project manager to do the work.

The project charter does not include details about what will be produced or how. 
Instead, it contains the summary milestone schedule.

Two additional inputs to Develop Project Charter are the agreements and the 
statement of work. The contract is what you agreed to do, although not all projects 
have a contract. The statement of work lists all of the deliverables that you and your 
team need to produce.

Enterprise environmental factors tell you how your company does business. An 
important one is the project management information system, which determines 
how work is assigned, and makes sure that tasks are done in the right order.

Organizational process assets tell you how your company normally runs projects. One 
of the most important assets is lessons learned, which is where you write down all of the 
valuable historical information that you learn throughout the project to be used later.
In matrix 
organizations, your 
team doesn’t report 
to you, so the 
charter gives you 
the authority to put 
them to work.
The project charter 
shouldn’t be too 
detailed. You shouldn’t 
have to update the 
charter every time you 
change something about 
your project for it to 
stay accurate.
When you’re taking the PMP exam, be 
careful when you see a question that 
asks you about the customer or client.
There’s a good chance that the question is 
asking you about a consulting or procurement 
situation where the customer or client is also the sponsor.
At Acme, the CEO and VP of Asia 
Travel were the sponsors. But at 
another travel agency, Frank and 
Joanne could just as easily sponsor the 
project, since they’re the customers.
Agreements are 
sometimes referred to 
as contracts on the 
exam.

Plan your project!
build your plan
Planning the project is when you really take control. You write a plan that says exactly 
how you’re going to handle everything that goes on in the project. The Develop 
Project Management Plan process is where you organize all of the information 
about your project into one place, so everyone knows exactly what needs to happen 
when they do the project work—no matter what their jobs are.
All of the planning processes 
in Chapters 5-13 will have 
you make plans. Those plans 
all go into the Project 
Management plan.

The Project Management plan is a collection of other plans
The Project Management plan is a single document, but it’s broken into a bunch of pieces 
called subsidiary plans. There’s one subsidiary plan for each of the other knowledge areas: 
Scope Management, Time Management, Cost Management, Quality Management, Human 
Resource Management, Communications Management, Risk Management, Procurement 
Management, and Stakeholder Management.
If you take over a project that’s 
already under way, but there isn’t 
a Project Management plan or 
it’s out of date, the first thing 
you need to do is get a current, 
accurate plan written up.
Project Management plan
The Project Management plan is actually 
a whole bunch of documents called 
“subsidiary plans,” each dedicated to a 
knowledge area and the problems that 
could happen related to that area.
The Project Management 
plan is all about planning 
for problems, and having 
the information you need to 
correct those problems when 
they occur.
Communications Management 
is another knowledge area. 
In that plan, we’ve got 
important numbers for the 
trip.
There’s a subplan for Risk 
Management. We used it when 
we took out traveler’s insurance 
for the teachers’ trip. That 
means if bags or cash are 
stolen, we’ll have a plan for 
dealing with it.
The Project Management plan lets you plan ahead for problems
The Planning process group is where you figure out how you’re going to do the 
project—because you need to come up with a plan before you bring the team in 
to do the work. This is where you think about everything that will happen on your 
project, and try to plot a course to completing it with as few errors as possible. 
And it’s where you figure out how you’ll handle changes—because every project has 
plenty of problems, but not all of those problems mean that you need to change 
course. If you plan well, your project will make only the right changes.
Outputs
The Project 
Management 
plan is the only 
output of the 
Develop Project 
Management 
Plan process.
The Project Management 
plan also has baselines. A 
baseline is a snapshot of 
the scope, schedule, or 
budget that you can use 
for planning. You’ll learn all 
about baselines in the next 
three chapters!

120    Chapter 4
 Don’t worry about memorizing all of 
the subsidiary plans.
You’re going to learn about all of the 
knowledge areas throughout the book, so 
don’t worry about memorizing all of these subsidiary plans 
right now. Just know that the Project Management plan has 
plans within it that map to each of the knowledge areas.
Relax
Isn’t a project plan just 
something I get out of 
Microsoft Project?
No. The Project Management 
plan is not the same thing as a 
project schedule.
You’ll use a tool like Microsoft Project 
when you’re doing Time Management to 
build the project schedule. (It’s useful for 
other knowledge areas as well.) But you’ll 
use your Project Management plan as a 
guide to help you develop that schedule. 
It will tell you what tools to use when 
you develop it, and how changes will be 
handled.

You’ll be learning about each of the knowledge areas throughout this 
book, and you’ll learn all about the subsidiary plan that goes with each 
area. But let’s take a quick look at what each subsidiary plan focuses on.
A quick look at all those subsidiary plans
Project Management Plan—Subsidiary Plans and Baselines
The Scope Management plan describes how scope changes are handled—like what to do when someone 
needs to add or remove a feature for a service or product your project produces.
The Requirements Management plan describes how you’ll gather, document, and manage the 
stakeholders’ needs, and how you’ll meet those needs with the project deliverables.
The Schedule Management plan shows you how to deal with changes to the schedule, like updated 
deadlines or milestones.
The Cost Management plan tells you how you’ll create the budget, and what to do when your project runs 
into money problems.
The Quality Management plan deals with problems that could arise when a product doesn’t live up to 
the customer or client’s standards. The Process Improvement plan tells you how you can change the 
processes you’re using to build your product to make them better. 
You use the Human Resource Management plan to deal with changes in your staff, and to identify and 
handle any additional staffing needs and constraints you might have in your specific project.
The Communications Management plan lists all of the ways that you communicate with your project’s 
team, stakeholders, sponsors, and important contacts related to the project.
The Risk Management plan is about detailing all the bad things that might happen and coming up with a 
plan to address each risk when and if it occurs.
The Procurement Management plan focuses on dealing with vendors outside of your company.
The Stakeholder Management plan focuses on managing the expectations of all of the people who are 
affected by the project. 
There are three baselines in the Project Management plan. The scope baseline is a snapshot of the 
scope, which helps you keep track of changes to the work that you’ll be doing and the planned deliverables 
you’ll be building. The schedule baseline does the same for the project schedule, and the cost 
performance baseline does the same for the budget.
The Project Management plan is the core of Integration 
Management. It’s your main tool for running a project.

122    Chapter 4
Below is a whole crop of problems that the teachers are running into. Write down which subsidiary 
plan you’d look in to get some help. If you’re not sure, just reread the descriptions of each 
subsidiary plan on the previous page, and take your best guess.
1. The teachers want to go Bali, but Acme Travel doesn’t book flights there so you 
need to subcontract one leg of the travel to another travel agency.
3. Just as you’re about to mail off the teachers’ tickets, you notice they’ve been 
printed incorrectly.
5.  The teachers are concerned that they won’t be able to get in touch with you when 
they’re away.
2. The teachers are having so much fun that they want to stay at a better hotel. They 
tell you to increase their budget by 15% to do that.
4.  The teachers might run into more bad weather, and you’ve got to figure out what 
contingencies you can put into place if that happens.
6. One  of the teachers realizes that he needs to come back earlier, and you want to 
make sure the budget reflects his lessened costs.
7.  You find out that you need to get the tickets out earlier than expected, because the 
teachers’ contract requires that all trips be preapproved by the superintendent of 
their school district.

Q: How far should I go when trying to anticipate every 
possible problem and list it in the Project Management plan?
A: It’s really important to think about what could go wrong 
on your project, so that you can have plans for what to do when 
problems crop up. An unexpected change can sometimes derail 
a project, and doing some planning up front can keep issues like 
that to a minimum. Planning can help you avoid problems in the 
first place, which is a lot better for everyone than reacting to them 
when they happen. So think of everything you can; the extra time 
you spend planning could be what keeps your project a success.
Q: Does the project manager create the Project 
Management plan all by himself?
A: No, it should be a group effort between the PM and the 
stakeholders. Everyone on the project team and all of the 
stakeholders need to agree that the plan is acceptable.
Q: What about things that I don’t think about? And 
sometimes, I know there could be problems in a certain area, 
but I’m not sure what they’ll be until the project gets going.
A: You’re never going to think of everything that could go 
wrong. To help keep your plan flexible, you should add an Open 
Issues section to the plan. You can write down any open issues or 
concerns in this section, and deal with them as they come down 
the line. However, you have to have all your project requirements 
complete before starting the project—you should never have any 
requirements in your Open Issues section.
Q: I still don’t get what enterprise environmental 
factors are.
A: Your company’s enterprise environmental factors are 
all of the information you have about its policies, processes, 
departments, and people. You need to know how your company 
does business in order to do a project. For example, you need to 
know about the different departments in your company if you’re 
managing a project that will be used by people in them.

Remember that the Project Management plan is formal—which means 
that it’s written down and distributed to your team.

You may get a question on the exam that asks what to do when 
you encounter a change. You always begin dealing with change by 
consulting the Project Management plan.

The project management information system is a part of your 
company’s enterprise environmental factors, and it’s generally part of 
any change control system. It defines how work is assigned to people.

The Project Management plan includes baselines: snapshots of the 
scope, schedule, and budget that you can use to keep track of them as 
they change.

Question Clinic: The “just-the-facts-ma’am” question
A lot of questions on the exam 
are pretty straightforward-but it’s the 
answers to those questions that can really 
hang you up. Here, take a look:
27. Which of the following can be found in the project charter?
A.	
Business case document
B.	 Expert judgment
C.	 Authorization for the project manager 
D.	 Project management information system
Some answers will clearly be wrong. The business case document is one 
of the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process.
Some answers are a little misleading! This is part of the 
Develop Project Charter process—but it’s from the tools and 
techniques, not a part of the project charter itself.
Here’s the right answer! The project manager’s authorization 
is included in the project charter. 
You haven’t seen this one yet—it’s part of enterprise environmental factors, an 
input to the Develop Project Charter process, but not in the charter itself.
When you see a “Just-The-

question really carefully! If 
you don’t, it’s easy for a wrong 
answer to look right.
A great way to prepare for the exam is to learn about the different kinds of 
questions, and then try writing your own. Each of these Question Clinics will look 
at a different type of question, and give you practice writing one yourself.

activity on the project, every step of the way. That’s what happens in the 
Direct and Manage Project Work process: you simply follow the 
plan you’ve put together and handle any problems that come up.

Project Management plan
The work you’re doing on the teachers’ project creates lots of things: airline 
reservations, hotel reservations, invoices, defect reports, and customer comments (to 
name a few). These things are all your deliverables, and they are one of the five 
outputs of the Direct and Manage Project Work process.
Another output is Work Performance Data, and that’s what we call the reports 
Acme’s running on the project. These reports track how many negative versus positive 
customer comments the project gets, and how well the project is doing at meeting 
its cost estimates. In fact, a project manager should figure out a way to use the work 
performance data that is generated from each knowledge area during the Direct and 
Manage Work process to understand how well the processes are being performed.
The project team creates deliverables
Any time your project 
produces something in the 
plan, that “something” is a 
deliverable of your project.
Your job is to direct the work, but 
you need to do more than deliver the 
results. You also need to keep track 
of how well your team performed—and 
that’s what the Work Performance 
Data output is about.
Since you create the Project

Repair defects in deliverables.

As the project plan changes,
make sure those changes are
reflected in the deliverables.
Executing the project includes repairing defects
Deliverables are anything 
you produce in the course of 
doing your project activities. 
dealing with defects
Your Quality Management plan 
focuses on catching defects as 
you go, so you can repair them 
as soon as possible.
The Direct and 
Manage Project 
Work process 
is where you 
and your team 
actually do the 
work to produce 
the deliverables.
The three components of the Direct 
and Manage Project Work process:
Deliverables include everything that you and 
your team produce for the project
The word deliverable is pretty self-explanatory. It means 
anything that your project delivers. The deliverables for your 
project include all of the products or services that you and your 
team are performing for the client, customer, or sponsor.
But deliverables include more than that. They also include every 
single document, plan, schedule, budget, blueprint, and anything 
else that gets made along the way…including all of the project 
management documents that you put together.
Deliverables
The Direct and Manage Project Work process has a bunch of inputs and outputs—but 
most of them have to do with implementing changes, repairs, and corrective action. If 
there’s a defect repair that’s been approved, this is where it happens. Once the defect is 
repaired, the result is an implemented defect repair. The same is true for changes 
and corrective actions; once they’re approved, they become process inputs, and then 
they can be implemented and become process outputs.
Any time you have to correct 
a mistake or make a repair in 
a deliverable, you’re fixing a 
defect.
This is different from fixing 
defects. A defect means that 
the plan was right, but your 
deliverable was built wrong.
Deliverables can be either 
internal to your company or 
to the customer.

deliverables, and others are work performance data produced by running 
reports. There’s also a list of changes, some of which affect the Project

Even if you work through all the processes you’ve seen so far, things

Take a minute and flip back to page 107. Notice how there’s a loop between the 
Executing and the Monitoring and Controlling processes? That’s because when 
your team is executing the plan and working on the deliverables, you need to keep 
a constant lookout for any potential problems. That’s what the Monitor and 
Control Project Work process is for. When you find a problem, you can’t just 
make a change…because what if it’s too expensive, or will take too long? You 
need to look at how it affects the project constraints—time, cost, scope, resources, 
risks, and quality—and figure out if it’s worth making the change. That’s what 
you do in the Perform Integrated Change Control process.
You start with 
information 
about how the 
work is being 
performed.
1
Next you figure 
out any changes 
that have to 
be made to 
the plans, and 
repairs that have 
to be made to 
the deliverables.
2
Once the 
changes and 
repairs are 
approved, 
you send 
them back to 
the team to 
put them in 
place.
3
A change control board (CCB) is a 
group of people—usually including the 
sponsor—that approves or rejects 
changes. Any time a change goes 
through integrated change control, 
the CCB decides whether or not it 
should be made. When they approve the 
change, you send it on to the team to 
implement.

Look for changes and deal with them
You need to stay on top of any possible changes that happen throughout your 
project, and that’s what the Monitor and Control Project Work process is 
for. Usually the work is progressing just fine. But sometimes you find out that you 
need to change something, and that’s when you use the Perform Integrated 
Change Control process to see if the change is worth the impact it will have on 
your project.

134    Chapter 4
Changes, defects, and corrections
You’ve already seen how a project can change as it goes along. When the teachers 
asked for their hotel to be upgraded, you took the request through the change 
control process at Acme, and when the change control board approved the 
change, you directed the agents to make the booking for the group.
But sometimes, things go wrong with what you intended to have happen in the 
first place. When your quality department told you that you had booked the 
teachers on the flight to Rome without putting them in the same row, you quickly 
fixed the reservation. But you intended for the teachers to sit together in the first 
place, so that’s not a change, it’s a defect.
In the process, you realized that your team wasn’t reading your documentation 
carefully, which is why they screwed up the airline reservations. To fix the way 
your team is working, you need to take corrective action. That’s when you need to 
change the way you’re doing the work on your project. Got all that?
changes versus defects
When the team 
is repairing 
defects to 
deliverables, 
they still need 
to go through 
change control.
Decide your changes in change control 
meetings
Sometimes a change you make will have a direct impact on other teams and 
projects, and it’s a good idea to be sure that everybody who will be impacted 
knows that it’s coming and thinks that it’s worth it before you make the change. 
You can’t always know everything that might happen as a result of a change, and 
that’s why it’s a good idea to get buy-in from key people in your company before 
you go through with it. And that’s what a change control meeting is all about!
Usually, a change control meeting will be a regularly scheduled thing, where 
people representing the affected areas of the company will get together to review 
proposed changes and decide whether or not to make them.  A change control 
board is never made up of just the people on your team. A change control 
meeting is all about getting people with different perspectives together to talk 
about the pros and cons of changes before deciding whether to approve or reject 
them.
It’s your job as a project manager to know the impact of requested changes to 
your project and prioritize them for the change control board.  Once you’ve done 
that, the change control board can make informed decisions about whether or not 
to approve them.

How the processes interact with one another
Make the change!
Here’s where you 
notice a problem. 
So you write down exactly 
what that change should be 
and send it to the CCB.
You use the change control 
system to evaluate the 
merits of the requested 
change and decide to 
approve or reject it. 
If the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process says it’s OK to go 
ahead, you make the change. The 
important thing to remember is 
that the change requests come from 
Monitor and Control Project Work, 
but are actually made during Direct 
and Manage Project Work.
While monitoring the teachers’ trip, you notice that they all ask for nonsmoking rooms 
every time they check into a hotel. But some hotels don’t have enough nonsmoking rooms 
available, and the teachers aren’t too thrilled about that.
After you talk it over with the teachers it’s clear that it’s worth splitting up the group over 
multiple hotels to make sure they all are in nonsmoking rooms—and some hotels are 
more expensive than you’d planned. The cost change will put you over budget, so the cost 
management plan needs to be updated. Time to take the request to change control:
I was 
dying in those 
smoky rooms; 
it’s well worth 
the extra cost.

happen during your project.

Change control is how 
you deal with changes 
to your Project 
Management plan. 
A change control 
system is the set 
of procedures that 
lets you make those 
changes in an 
organized way.
There’s a beautiful 
hotel across the street, 
and we want to transfer. 
Increase the budget by 15%, 
and book us there.
Project Management plan
Any time you need to make a change to your plan, you need to 
start with a change request. This is a document that either 
you or the person making the change needs to create. Any 
change to your project needs to be documented so you can 
figure out what needs to be done. Once you have a change 
request, that then kicks off your project’s set of change control 
procedures.
This means you need to 
write down exactly what 
needs to be changed and 
put it in something called 
a change request. That’s 
a form that you fill out 
to send a change through 
change control.
The key here is PROCEDURE—
change control is about how your 
company handles changes. You may 
use a computer system to monitor 
and document changes, but that’s 
just one part of your change 
control system.

Acme Travel Change Control System
This is Acme’s change control system. 
It’s specific to the company, but it 
contains all of the steps you’d see in a 
typical change control system.
The first thing you do with 
any change is to consult the 
proper management plan.
Next, you document the change, and 
submit it to the board that decides 
if the change will be implemented.
Not every change gets 
approved, but this 
one did—and now the 
Project Management 
plan can be updated.
At Acme, the plan is updated using 
the configuration management 
system, a part of the PMIS that 
tracks all of the changes. 
A change control board is a group 
of people who consider changes 
for approval. Not every change 
control system has one, but most 
do.

138    Chapter 4
Here is a list of actions that are recommended by a project manager. Which are preventive and 
which are corrective?
Preventing or correcting problems
When people predict problems on 
projects before they happen, it’s 
called a forecast. A forecast can be a 
good reason to make a change too!
When you monitor your project, you might be checking the actual time it’s 
taking you to do scheduled work versus the amount of time you planned, 
or you might be gathering information on the number of defects you have 
found versus the number you expected. In both cases, it’s possible that you 
might find problems. If you do, you have to change the way you do your 
work and keep your project from being dragged down. When you make a 
course change on your project, that’s taking corrective action.
It’s also possible that you might see problems that are going to occur 
even though they haven’t happened yet. If you do, you will want to take 
preventive action, or steps that you take to avoid 
potential problems.
In both corrective and preventive action, you always need to submit your 
proposed change and put it through the Perform Integrated Change 
Control process—and only if it is approved will you implement it. If your 
recommended action makes it through, you need to change the plan and any 
of your baselines to include it.
The documented scope, schedule, and cost baselines in the Project 
Management plan are called the performance measurement baseline.

project integration management
Q:  Sometimes my team members 
come to me and tell me that the project 
could have problems later. What do I do 
with that?
A:  For some project managers, it seems 
natural to dismiss these “negative Nellies” 
who seem concerned with problems that 
could go wrong in the future. But working 
with them instead is one of the best ways 
you can satisfy your stakeholders. 

When someone makes an estimate or 
prediction of a future condition that could 
lead to trouble, it’s called a forecast, and 
that’s very valuable information. You 
should distribute it along with your work 
performance information, and try to think of 
ways to avoid the problem—which is what 
preventive action is all about. 

A big part of your job as a project manager 
is to figure out how to prevent changes. 
This might seem a little weird—how can 
you prevent changes before the project is 
implemented? One way to do this is plan as 
well as possible, because a lot of changes 
happen because of a lack of planning. 
But it also means talking to stakeholders 
throughout the project and keeping an 
eye out for potential problems. When you 
take the PMP exam, if you see the phrase 
“influencing factors that cause change,” 
this is what it’s referring to.
Q: Who approves changes?
A: Usually there’s a change control 
board (CCB) that approves changes. That’s 
a group of people, most often including the
stakeholders and sponsor, who look at the 
benefits of a change and figure out if it’s 
worth the cost. If there’s a CCB, your change 
control system will include a procedure that 
mentions it. But not every company has a 
CCB, and there is no requirement in the 
PMBOK Guide that you have one. 
Q: What if there’s a problem outside 
my project, and I’m not sure it affects me?
A: You should still consider its potential 
impact when you’re monitoring your project’s 
work. It’s important that you’re always on the 
lookout for potential problems. If you’re not 
sure whether something could impact your 
project, it’s your responsibility as a project 
manager to bring it to the attention of your 
stakeholders. And if you can make a change 
on your own that doesn’t impact the project 
constraints (scope, cost, time, quality, risk, 
or resources), then it’s completely within 
your rights as a project manager to do it.
Q: Once a change is approved, what 
do I do with it?
A: You change your Project Management 
plan to incorporate the change. This can 
mean that you create a new baseline with the 
new Project Management plan. For example, 
say you forgot to add a stakeholder to the 
change control board, so your project plan 
now describes the wrong process for making 
changes. You’ll need to fix that, and you’ll 
need to go through change control to do it.

Every time a change is reviewed by the 
change control board, you keep a record of it 
in your change log.  So whether the change 
was approved or rejected, the change 
request and the decision the CCB makes 
about it should be documented.
Q: What about changes that don’t 
affect the project constraints?
A: If you evaluate the impact of a change 
and find that it won’t have an impact on 
the project constraints, then you can make 
the change without going through change 
control. Sometimes you need to change 
resources or move tasks around, and you 
can make those changes without affecting 
the bottom line or the end product. In these 
cases, change control wastes time and 
resources, rather than helping your project.
Q: Now, what’s a performance 
baseline again, and what do I do with it?
A: A  performance baseline is a snapshot 
of your project’s scope, schedule, and 
cost.  When you plan out the work you’ll 
do on a project, you write down all of the 
activities you’ll need to do and save that 
understanding as your scope baseline.  
You’ll do the same with your understanding 
of the project’s schedule and its cost. That 
way, you can always compare your actual 
performance to your plan.  

Every time a change is approved, that 
means the plan has changed. So you have 
to update your baseline to include the new 
work (or cost, or schedule).
You always have 
the authority to 
make changes to 
your project if 
they don’t affect 
cost, schedule, 
or scope.

Close 
project or 
phase
Finish the work, close the project
You can’t finish the project until you get paid! Most projects start with contracts, 
and when they do you need to make sure the terms are met. Acme signed a 
contract with the Midwestern Teachers’ Association when the project started, 
and now it’s time to make sure all of the parts of that contract are met. And 
that’s part of what you do in the Close Project or Phase process. But 
an even more important part of this process is that you create the lessons 
learned and add them to your company’s organizational process assets. 
That way you and other project managers can learn from this historical 
information in the future. The inputs to the Close Project or Phase process 
include the Project Management plan, organizational process assets, enterprise 
environmental factors, work performance information, and deliverables, along 
with any contract you have for the work (if there is one). And you use the same 
familiar tools and techniques list that you’ve seen throughout the chapter.

You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here 
The teachers have gone through their entire itinerary. They’re now on their 
way to Paris, which is the final leg of their tour. They’ve had a great time, 
and now it’s time for you to finish up.
Every project needs to end, and that’s what the Close Project or Phase 
process is all about. You want other travel agents at Acme to learn from 
anything new you’ve discovered. Remember how you had to scramble with 
the nonsmoking room request? Maybe your friends at Acme can learn from 
that, and ask new clients up front what they want! That’s why you write 
down your lessons learned, and that’s a big part of closing the project.
Lessons learned are finished 
in Close Project or Phase, but 
written down throughout the 
entire project. And it’s not just 
by the project manager—the 
whole team writes down lessons 
learned.
Think about a major project you’ve heard of that did not end well, like one 
that was shut down before the work was done. What lessons could have 
been learned from that project?
How can the project manager use the Close Project or Phase process to 
make sure that something good comes out of early termination?

The final product of your 
project is the thing your 
customers will remember most. 
You’ve seen the organizational process assets input a bunch of times now. But where 
does it really come from? It turns out that it comes from other project managers just 
like you. Every time a project is closed, you update those assets so that you can use 
them later. And new project managers will be able to learn from everything that’s 
happened on your project. 
Outputs
Even if your project ends early, 
you still need to follow the Close

142    Chapter 4
So why INTEGRATION Management?
The Integration Management knowledge area has all of the processes that you do 
in your day-to-day work as a project manager. So why are they called “Integration 
Management” processes? Well, think about what it takes to run a project: you need 
people and other resources from all around your company; knowledge about how your 
company does its business; standards, templates, and other assets that you’ve gathered 
from other projects; and the ability to put it all together—that’s what a project 
manager does. And that’s where the “integration” part comes in.
This is especially important when you need to work with consultants, because your 
job is to procure services for the project. And you need to plan for all of it at the 
beginning—which is when you integrate all of these things together into a single 
plan. It’s your job to make sure that every one of the 47 processes in the PMBOK Guide 
is addressed in the plan, even if you’re not going to use it (for example, if you don’t 
need contractors or consultants, you won’t use Procurement processes).
Integration 
Management 
means making 
sure that all of 
the processes 
work together 
seamlessly 
to make 
your project 
successful.
so that’s what it means!
What else is there?
Huh…it seems like we covered the whole project, right? You got authorized to do 
the work, you planned the project, you executed it, you corrected problems along 
the way, and you closed it out. Isn’t that everything?
Well, of course not! There’s a whole lot more planning that you have to do, and 
many skills that you need to have. Luckily, we’ve got the PMBOK Guide to help us 
figure out exactly what we need to know to manage projects effectively.
I get it! When I’m 
putting together my 
project management 
plan, I need to look at 
every single process 
and figure out how 
it’s integrated into 
my project. So that’s 
what “Integration 
Management” means.
That’s what the 
rest of the book 
is about.

D.	 Change requests
Start thinking about the kinds of questions 
you’re seeing. Some have extraneous details—
we call them “red herrings.” Others are about 
inputs and outputs. That will definitely  
make the exam more familiar and easier.
Oh, I see. Sometimes the 
details of the question 
don’t matter. They’re 
just there to throw you 
off track.
Just remember…if you get something 
wrong now, that means you’re 
actually MORE likely to remember 
it on the exam! That’s why practice 
exams are so useful.
Watch out for those red 
herrings.
Take some time to go over the answers 
to these questions and if they did throw 
you off track, reread the question to 
understand why.

158    Chapter 4
1. Answer: C
This is really a question about inputs and outputs. There’s only one process 
that takes “change requests” as an input, and that’s Perform Integrated Change 
Control. That’s where your changes get approved. The other answers all refer to 
other processes: A is about building a baseline (which is part of Develop Project 
Management Plan), while B and D are both about Direct and Manage Project Work.
2. Answer: B
The Project Management plan is created in the Develop Project Management Plan 
process, which happens after Develop Project Charter. Develop Project Charter is 
the very first process on any project, and the inputs in answers A, C, and D exist 
before the project started. The Project Management plan is created during the 
project.
3. Answer: C
The whole reason for the Direct and Manage Project Work process is to actually do 
the project work, and the deliverables are the products or services that are created 
by the project. Don’t get fooled by answer D—even though the work is performed in 
Direct and Manage Project Work, the information about how that work is performed 
is turned into forecasts in Monitor and Control Project Work. 
4. Answer: C
When you get a question about communication, look for the answer that provides 
the most complete, honest, and up-front information, even if that information won’t 
necessarily solve the problem or make everyone happy. 
5. Answer: B
All changes must be handled using the change control system, which is a set of 
procedures that is contained in the Project Management plan. There is no way to 
tell from the question what specific steps will be in that change control system—
answers A, C, and D are all possible ways to deal with changes, depending on the 
situation. The only way to know for sure what to do is to follow the change control 
procedures in the Project Management plan.
That makes sense. You need to 
monitor the work to figure 
out how well it’s 
being performed.
This is a “which-is-not” question. 
When you see a question asking you 
to choose which input or output is 
not associated with a process, one 
good strategy is to try to think 
of what it is that process does.

Exam Questions
Answers

6. Answer: A
This is a “just the facts” question, and answer A is the actual definition of the Work Authorization 
System from the PMBOK Guide. After you’re done with these questions, look it up—it’s on page 
567. Underline or highlight it, and then read it out loud. Once you’ve read about it in the chapter, 
answered this question about it, and then looked up the definition, you’ll never forget it!
7. Answer: D
The first thing you do after a change is approved is to update the baseline. If you chose answer 
C, don’t feel bad—it’s easy to get a little mixed up about what a baseline is used for. The whole 
purpose of the baseline is to figure out whether your project has deviated from the plan. But 
a change isn’t a deviation from the plan! A deviation is accidental, while a change is done on 
purpose. That’s why it’s so important to get the change approved: that way, everyone knows about 
it, which means that you can plan for it. And updating the baseline is how you do that planning.
8. Answer: B
When your company has a policy, you need to follow it and not try to work around it. Also, don’t 
get fooled by answer D—the question said that a change request was submitted, so it’s already 
documented. The exam could contain tricks like that!
9. Answer: B
This is a business case—it describes the benefits of doing a project and can be used to decide 
whether it’s worth it for your company to do the work. Sometimes the benefits will be about 
gaining capabilities, not just money.
10. Answer: D
Defects do not need to be documented in the Project Management plan. Take a look at the 
other answers—do you understand why they are correct? Answer A is simply the definition of 
the project charter; it doesn’t have anything to do with the defect, but it’s still true. When you’re 
performing the Monitor and Control Project Work process, you need to make sure defect repairs 
are approved before you change the deliverables, so answer B is true as well. And as far as 
answer C goes, that’s the whole purpose of the Perform Integrated Change Control process: to 
approve defect repairs, changes, and preventive and corrective actions!
You use the baseline to protect 
yourself from nasty surprises… and an 
approved change is not a surprise.
There will be questions on the exam 
where there are two valid answers 
but only one BEST answer.
The important stuff in this question is all 
in the second and third sentences. The 
outsourcing detail is a red herring.

11. Answer: A
This is the definition of the Project Management plan!
12. Answer: C
Even when a project is terminated, you still need to close it out.
13. Answer: A
If a resource is not available to you, it doesn’t matter what’s in your project charter or what your 
sponsors and stakeholders want. You need to figure out how to move forward from here, and the first 
step in doing that is evaluating the impact that this new problem will have on your project.
14. Answer: A
The project manager must decide the priority of the changes. If the changes need to be made, that 
means that they were approved. So you can’t simply deny them. And you can’t call the team in for a 
meeting, because they need to do the work. Some people may think that the stakeholders need to be 
involved—but since the change was already approved, you’ve gotten their buy-in. Now it’s up to you to 
decide the order in which they’re implemented. 
15. Answer: C
When you get a change request, you need to consult the Project Management plan and follow the 
procedures defined in the change control system. It is generally not a good idea to involve the entire 
team in evaluating each change that comes in—there may be many changes, and if you pull your team 
off the job for each one, they’ll never get their job done! 
16. Answer: A
Once a change is requested, all of the work that you do with it falls under Perform Integrated Change 
Control, right up until it’s approved and you can implement it. 
A question like this needs you to actually 
think about what you’d do—it’s not just 
about applying a rule that you’ve learned.
This is NOT a good change control board 
because a change control meeting doesn’t usually 
include the whole team!
There’s no such thing as a Change 
Prioritization plan! Keep an eye out for 
fake artifacts and processes.

17. Answer: B
The project management information system is defined by the company, and it’s external 
to the project. You can think about it as the rules that you are told to follow in order to 
assign work in your company. They are part of the enterprise environmental factors, an 
input to Develop Project Charter.
18. Answer: B
The work performance information is documented as part of Direct and Manage Project 
Work. By the time the project closes, it’s too late to use the work performance information! 
That’s why it’s an input to Monitor and Control Project Work—so you can take corrective 
action if the work is not being performed well.
19. Answer: B
The project charter authorizes the project manager. 
20. Answer: D
You’ll learn about forecasts in Chapter 7—they’re used to help 
predict whether the project will come in on time and within budget. 
If not, preventive or corrective actions will be needed! But you 
don’t need to know that to know they’re not an output of Direct and 
Manage Project Work.
21. Answer: B
Historical information is an important input into Develop Project Charter, 
which is the first process that you perform when you start a new project. 
Historical information is very important, because it’s how you learn about 
past projects’ successes and failures. It’s not actually listed as its own 
input. It’s a part of organizational process assets—and it really is a huge 
asset to any organization!
We’ll learn about Scope 
Management in the 
next chapter.
Remember that lessons learned 
are documented throughout 
the project, not just at the 
end! That’s why they’re part of 
Work Performance Information.
It seems 
like historical 
information is an 
important concept. 
I’ll bet there will 
a question or two 
about it on the exam.
Exam Questions
Answers
When you add lessons learned to your 
organizational process assets, you’re

When you close a process or

accepted by the stakeholders.

The project manager may be consulted when the project charter is created,

project is not even known when the charter is created! 
23. Answer: C
While you may employ good judgment in developing your project 
management plan, expert judgment is not an input. It’s a tool/technique 
used in the various processes.
24. Answer: C
The first step in handling any change is to document it. That’s why change 
requests are an input to Perform Integrated Change Control: the change 
control process cannot begin until the change is written down!
25. Answer: D
If you’re having trouble remembering what the inputs and outputs are for 
Monitor and Control Project Work and Perform Integrated Change Control, 
one way to think about it is that change control is all about deciding 
whether or not to do something. Monitor and Control Project Work is 
where you spot the problems—that’s why all of the REQUESTED 
changes are outputs of it, and inputs into Perform Integrated Change 
Control.

Perform Integrated Change Control is where those recommendations 
get evaluated and turned into APPROVED actions and changes. The 
ones that are not approved are REJECTED. Then they go back to Direct 
and Manage Project Work, where they are IMPLEMENTED, because 
that’s project work and all project work happens in that process.
Didn’t D look like a good answer?
Remember, this is how you handle changes: 
Find it…evaluate it…fix it.
So how did you do?
Rejecting changes means 
that sometimes you need 
to say no to people to make 
them happy in the end-they 
might not like it, but they’ll 
end up satisfied when the 
project goes well.

Doing the right stuff
Confused about exactly what you should be working on?   
Once you have a good idea of what needs to be done, you need to track your scope as 
the project work is happening. As each goal is accomplished, you confirm that all of the 
work has been done and make sure that the people who asked for it are satisfied with 
the result. In this chapter, you’ll learn the tools that help your project team set its goals 
and keep everybody on track.

We can’t lose control 
of the project this time 
around. Can’t we hire 
someone to help us keep 
CGW III on track?
…and right back into the fire
Since it took so long to get this version out, it’s already time 
to start working on the next version. But nobody wants to see 
that project spin out of control the way it did last time.
They’re wondering what 
they can do to get this 
new project started off 
on the right foot.
The Cows Gone Wild II team ran into a lot of 
changes throughout the project. Could they have 
done something to avoid that problem?

Cubicle conversation
Brian: The project rocked in the beginning. We brought in 
some really talented programmers so that we could handle 
all of the technical challenges that might come up. We spent 
all that time whiteboarding and working our way through 
the technical issues in design. It really felt like this game was 
going to be amazing and fun to build. What went wrong?
Amy: We got sidetracked all over the place. Remember 
what happened with the website? We spent months making 
that site look just like the game. It got to the point where it 
actually looked a lot better than the game did.
Brian: Yeah, you’re right. And there were all these changes 
along the way—the story got updated like a thousand times. 
It was nuts.
Amy: I remember that. What a mess.
Brian: Totally. Oh man, and that time we realized you had 
to redraw all the artwork for the Haymaker level? We all slept 
in the office for like a week!
Amy: Right…um, so what’s gonna keep that from happening 
this time?

How would you solve these problems that happened in Cows Gone Wild II so they don’t cause the 
same kind of trouble on CGW III?
Just write down a short sentence 
for each of these.
1. The website got larger and larger and took almost as much time to build as the game itself.
4. The game was over a year late.
2. Last-minute story changes.
3. Artwork changes that caused rewrites at the last minute.
The team had to rework a bunch 
of artwork because the game 
story changed.

168    Chapter 5
Here are some answers that are good for dealing with these scenarios.
	
	
	
	
Start planning sooner. Figure out what the 
team is going to do before they start.
Knowing what you’re going to build 
BEFORE you build it means you 
can do a better job predicting 
how long it will take.
Sounds like this game was late because the scope kept 
changing. Better planning could have fixed this.
Doing more planning at the start of 
the project helps you prioritize so 
that the most important work gets 
done efficiently.
Writing down all of the work 
and the effort required to do it 
will help everyone understand the 
impact of their changes.
It’s easier to figure out what’s going 
to have to change if everyone is in 
sync on the scope.
If the creative team figured out earlier 
that they’d need to make changes, the 
programmers could have worked on parts 
that weren’t going to change. That would 
have been a lot more efficient.
Get started on the artwork changes sooner.
Plan ahead and avoid late-breaking changes.

You can’t depend on the team to 
figure out what to do along the

work from the very beginning.
Luckily, if you nail down 
the scope up front, your 
team won’t waste time doing 
unnecessary work later.

scope management
It looks like we have a scope problem
All of the major problems on Cows Gone Wild II were scope problems. The 
website was bloated with features that were added on late in the project. The 
creative team kept realizing that they had to do a lot more work. These are 
classic scope problems.
For the exam, you need to understand both 
product and project scope.
Scope creep means uncontrolled 
changes that cause the team to do extra 
work.
Product scope means the features and 
functions of the product or service that 
you and your team are building.
The product scope is all about the final 
product—its features, components, pieces.
When people talk about scoping 
out their products, a lot of times 
they’re talking about figuring out 
the features of the product, not 
the work that goes into it.
Project scope is all of the work that 
needs to be done to make the product.
THIS is a big part of what the 
project manager is concerned 
with…the work the team has to 
do.
When we talk about scoping out a project, we 
mean figuring out all of the work that needs 
to be done to make the product.
This means changes that just went 
in without anyone bothering to 
figure out what effect they’d 
have on the project’s time, cost, 
scope, quality, risk, or resources.

 Q: Does the scope include all of the 
stuff that I make, like a project schedule 
or a budget? What about things that are 
used to build the product but not actually 
delivered to the people who use it?
A: Yes, the project scope includes every 
single thing made by you and the team, and 
that includes the project plan and other 
project management documents. There 
are plenty of things on a project that are 
deliverables, but which the people who use 
the product will never see…like a project 
schedule, specifications, blueprints, and 
budgets. And while some of these things are 
made by the project manager, there are a 
lot of them that aren’t, and it’s not your job 
to figure out what goes into them. You just 
need to make sure they get done.
Q: Won’t the team care more about 
what they are making than how they are 
making it?
A: Yes, definitely. It’s your job as project 
manager to worry about all of the work the 
team does to build the product, so that 
they can focus on actually building it. But 
that doesn’t mean you don’t need their 
cooperation to make sure you’ve written 
down all of the work, and nothing else.
Q: Does that mean the project 
manager doesn’t care about the product 
scope at all, just the project scope?
A: No, you still need to think about your 
project’s final product. You can never ignore 
product scope, because most projects have

changes to the product scope along the 
way. You’ll have to change your project 
scope to include the work that’s caused by 
product scope changes. Changes like that 
will probably have an impact on time and 
cost, too.
Here’s an example: if somebody asks for a 
new feature in Cows Gone Wild III, the first 
thing the team needs to do is understand 
how much work is involved to accommodate 
it, and what that scope change will do to the 
cost and schedule.
As a project manager, your main concern is 
understanding that impact, and making sure 
everyone is OK with it before the change 
gets made. It’s not your job to decide which 
is the best feature for the product, just to 
help everybody involved keep their priorities 
in mind and do what’s best for the project.

That’s a good idea. But what 
happens if they miss something?
It often seems like you should just be able 
to get everyone in the same room when the 
project starts and just hash all this stuff out. 
But it’s really easy to miss something, and it’s 
even easier for a team to get sidetracked.
It’s way too easy for people to go off track 
and start doing things that don’t really 
contribute to the project—like building the 
website for a video game instead of building 
the game itself.
You’ve got to know what (and how) you 
will build before you build it
You always want to know exactly what work has to be done to finish your project 
before you start it. You’ve got a bunch of team members, and you need to know 
exactly what they’re going to do to build your product. So how do you write 
down the scope?
That’s the goal of the six Scope Management processes. They’re about 
figuring out how you will identify all of the work your team will do during the 
project, coming up with a way to make sure that you’ve written down what work 
will be done (and nothing else!), and making sure that when things change on 
your project, you keep its scope up to date so that your team is always building 
the right product. 
The Scope Management plan describes how you write down the 
scope, make sure it’s right, and keep it up to date.
You need to write down exactly how 
you’re going to do all of those things 
in the Scope Management plan.
This is why the Scope Management 
plan needs to say how you’re going 
to keep unnecessary work out of 
the project.

The power of Scope Management
When you take control of your project’s scope, you’re doing more than just 
planning. It turns out that when projects have scope problems, the results 
are actually pretty predictable. Take a look at these problems that the 
Ranch Hand team ran into. Do any of these sound familiar to you? Many 
project managers run into similar problems on their own projects.
The team was tempted to lay down the law 
and forbid any changes…but a lot of those 
changes were necessary, and good ideas.
The worst part about this was that there was no 
way to know when they were done with the project 
without asking for the sponsor’s opinion…and it 
seemed like that opinion was always changing.
They’d sit around in meetings talking 
about what they wanted to build, but 
it seemed like weeks before anything 
started getting done.
 The team had trouble getting the project off the ground. 
Everyone on the team was good at their individual jobs, but it 
seemed like nobody knew how to get the project started.
1
 There were a lot of false starts. Just when they thought they 
were getting the project under way, it seemed like something would 
shift and they’d be back to square one.
2
 The sponsor and stakeholders were unpredictable. There 
were three different times that Amy and Brian thought they were 
done. But each time, a stakeholder found a problem that sent them 
back to the drawing board.
3
 There were a whole lot of changes. They were always 
scrambling to keep up with shifting priorities and ideas, and they 
never knew for sure what they’d be working on each week.

scope management
The six Scope Management processes
Each of the Scope Management processes was designed to help you avoid the kinds 
of scope problems that cause a lot of projects to go off track. One of the best ways 
to remember these processes for the exam is to understand why they’re useful, and 
how they solve the kinds of problems that you’ve seen on your own projects.
Collect Requirements
In this process, you find out all of the stakeholders’ needs and write them 
down so that you know what to build and your requirements can be 
measured and tracked.
Define Scope
Here’s where you write down a detailed description of the work you’ll do 
and what you’ll produce.
Create WBS
The work breakdown structure (WBS) organizes all of your team’s work into 
work packages—or discrete pieces of work that team members do—so that 
you can keep the momentum of the project going from the start.
Control Scope
We already know how important it is to control changes on your project. 
When scope changes aren’t controlled, it leads to the most frustrating sort of 
project problems. Luckily, you already know about change control, and now 
you can use it to manage your project’s scope.
When you do this right, the stakeholders 
are never unpredictable because you 
already understand their needs.
Validate Scope
Once the work is complete, you need to make sure that what you’re 
delivering matches what you wrote down in the project scope statement. 
That way, the team never delivers the wrong product to the customer.
Remember integrated change 
control from Chapter 4? Now 
you’ll see it in action.
Pay attention to the WBS—there will be 
a lot of questions about it on the exam.

Plan Scope Management
Here’s where you write down the subsidiary plan for the project 
management plan that we talked about in the last chapter. You plan out all 
of the work you’ll do to define your scope, make sure the team is planning to 
do the right work, and control it.

174    Chapter 5
scope it out
Plan your scoping processes
Here’s where you figure out how you’ll approach defining and validating the scope 
of your project. The Plan Scope Management process is where you lay out your 
approach to figuring out what work you’ll do and what’s out of scope. All of the other 
processes in the Scope Management knowledge area are defined and described in this 
document. It’s the blueprint you’ll use for everything else you’ll do to manage scope 
through the project.
Since you’re in the process of 
creating these plans for the 
other knowledge areas at the 
same time as this one, there’s 
a good chance that you can use 
some of the same ideas in this 
plan that you’ve uncovered in 
the process of creating your 
Time Management plan, your 
Cost Management plan, or any 
of the other subsidiary plans.

Now you’ve got a roadmap for managing scope
There are two outputs of the Plan Scope Management process: the Scope 
Management plan and the Requirements Management plan. Both of them help 
you define the scope of your project and make sure that you and your team are 
focused on only the work that will help you satisfy your customers’ needs. The 
Scope Management plan keeps you on track by detailing the processes you and 
your team will follow as you document your scope, figure out your work breakdown 
structures, and validate and control your scope for the rest of the project. 
The Requirements Management plan details the process you’ll use to collect 
requirements and how you’ll manage them once they’ve been written down.  
Outputs
Requirements

Here’s where you’ll find a description 
of the approach the team will 
take to planning, tracking, and

the prioritization process for 
requirements, and how you’ll 
build a traceability matrix for your 
requirements as well. 
Scope Management plan
Here’s where you write down the 
subsidiary plan for the Project 
Management plan that we talked 
about in Chapter 4. You plan out all 
of the work you’ll do to define your 
scope, with the right work planned for 
the team, and control it. 
Your Requirements 
Management plan will 
describe all of the 
processes your team 
will use to document 
your requirements and 
maintain that document 
throughout he project.
The Scope Management 
plan isn’t just about 
writing a scope 
document; it details 
the process you use 
to come up with 
your work breakdown 
structure too. 
The Plan Scope Management process helps 
you think through everything you’ll need to 
do to keep your project focused on the right 
work from beginning to end.

Collect requirements for your project
Gathering requirements is all about sitting down with all of the stakeholders 
for your project and working out what their needs are, and that’s what you 
do in the Collect Requirements process. If your project is going to be 
successful, you need to know what it will take for all of your stakeholders to 
agree that your project has met its goals. You need to have a good idea of 
what’s required of your project up front, or you’ll have a tough time knowing 
whether or not you’re doing a good job as you go. That’s why you need to 
write down all of your project and product requirements with enough detail 
that you can measure your team’s progress.

178    Chapter 5
Talk to your stakeholders
Interviews are important ways to get your stakeholders 
to explain how they’ll use the product or service your 
project is creating. By talking to people one-on-one, you 
can get them to explain exactly what they need so that you 
can be sure that your project can meet its goals. 
where to find requirements
The Collect Requirements process involves talking to the people who are affected by your 
project to find out what they need. All of the tools in this process are focused on getting your 
stakeholders to tell you about the problem that the project is going to solve. Sometimes that means 
sitting down with each of them one-on-one, and other times you can do it in a group setting. One 
of the most important things to understand about requirements is that every requirement fulfills a 
specific stakeholder need. Lucky for you, a lot of those needs are already written down—in your 
business case document. 
But that’s not the only place you’ll find requirements, so here are three really useful tools and 
techniques to help you gather requirements:
Focus groups are another way to get a group 
of people to discuss their needs with you. By letting a 
group discuss the end product together, you can get 
them to tell you requirements that they might not have 
thought of by themselves. 
Facilitated workshops are more structured group conversations where a 
moderator leads the group through brainstorming requirements together. In facilitated 
workshops, misunderstandings and issues can get reconciled all at once because all of the 
stakeholders are working together to define the requirements.  
Requirements Up Close
You start with 
the stakeholders 
for your 
project. They 
have a need that 
your project can 
meet.

Next, you figure

project.  
If you’ve ever done a joint 
application design (JAD) session 
where users and the development 
team work together to define 
requirements, it’s considered a 
facilitated workshop.
All your requirements fill 
stakeholders’ needs, and 
many start with a need 
that you identified in your 
business case document.

Make decisions about requirements
A big project usually has a lot of stakeholders, and that means a lot of 
opinions. You’ll need to find a way of making decisions when those opinions 
conflict with each other. There are four major decision-making techniques 
you can choose from. These are referred to as group decision-making 
techniques on the test. 
Unanimity means everyone agrees on the decision.  
Majority means that more than half the people in 
the group agree on the decision. 
Plurality means that the idea that gets the most votes 
wins. 
Dictatorship is when one person makes the decision 
for the whole group.
You’ll need to know the difference between the four different decision techniques for the 
exam. Here are the minutes from a facilitated workshop that the CGW team held with all of 
its stakeholders. Identify which decision-making technique was used in each case.

Help your team to get creative
Getting your team to think creatively can help you create a better product 
from the start. Group creativity techniques are all about getting those 
creative juices flowing while you gather your requirements. 
Idea/mind maps are 
a good way to visualize the 
way your ideas relate to each 
other. When you’ve finished 
working through an idea, it 
sometimes helps to create 
a map of how you got there 
and show which ideas can be 
grouped together.  
The Delphi technique is a way of letting everyone in the group give their thoughts about 
what should be in the product while keeping them anonymous. When you use the Delphi technique, 
everybody writes down their answers to the same questions about what the product needs to do and 
then hands them into a moderator. The questions could be about specific features that the product 
should have.
 When the CGW team used the Delphi technique, here were a few of their questions:
Here’s the mind map the 
CGW team made from 
their brainstorming session.

What new levels would you like to see in the game?

What should the story for CGW III be about?
The moderator keeps everybody’s names to himself , but shares the ideas so that everyone can learn 
from them and think of new ones.  After everybody discusses those ideas, they’re given a chance to 
adjust their original answers to the questions and hand them back in to the moderator. These iterations 
continue a few times until the group settles on a list of requirements for the product.  
The name “Delphi technique,” 
comes from the Oracle at Delphi. 
The Delphi technique can 
be used to estimate the 
work the team will need 
to do and how long it 
will take too!

Affinity diagrams are great when you have a lot of 
ideas and you need to group them so you can do something 
with them. A lot of people make affinity diagrams using Post-
it notes on walls. That way, you can move the ideas around 
and change the groupings when you think of new areas to 
explore. Sometimes just putting requirements in categories 
will help you to find new ones.
The nominal group technique is a form of 
brainstorming where you write down the ideas as you find 
them and have the group vote on which ones they like the 
best.  You then use the votes to rank all of the ideas and 
separate the ones that aren’t important from the ones you 
want to delve into deeper.  
Brainstorming is one of the most 
commonly used ways of collecting 
requirements. Whenever you sit a group of 
people down to think of new ideas, you’re 
brainstorming.   
This kind of diagram 
is also called a 
KJ diagram (or a 
Kawakita diagram) 
because it was 
invented by a really 
smart guy named Jiro 
Kawakita.
Benchmarking is a way of comparing 
the processes and practices used in 
building your software with the practices 
and processes in other organizations 
so you can figure out the best ideas for 
improvement.
Context diagrams help your team show the way all 
of the processes and features in your product scope relate 
to each other. It’s a picture of the scope of your product that 
shows how users will interact with it.   
Document analysis is a way of 
collecting requirements by reading through 
all of the existing documents for your 
product.

everyone likes a prototype
Use a questionnaire to get requirements from a 
bigger group of people 
The Cows Gone Wild development team needed to talk to the people who play 
their games to figure out what would make the gamers happy in the next 
version. The team obviously couldn’t go around to every customer’s house 
asking questions, so they wrote a questionnaire about new possible features for 
the game that they sent to gamers who had registered the game.  
When it was time to start collecting requirements for the new version, the 
team started with all of the data they’d gathered from those surveys and did 
some analysis to figure out which features were most important to the gaming 
community. Here’s an excerpt from their survey results:
Cows Gone Wild II Registration Survey Results 
The Cows Gone Wild series released Cows Gone Wild II three months ago. Since then, 
we’ve sold 500,000 copies of the game. Of those sales, 350,000 have been registered 
and 100,000 have responded to the CGW III requirements collection survey. Here are 
the results: 
Artwork:
Which new environments would you like to see included in a follow-up to the game?
Sometimes observing the people who will use your product while they work with it will give you a 
better idea of how to solve their problems. People don’t always know what to say when you ask them 
for requirements, so watching them deal with the problem your product is going to address can help 
you to find requirements that they might not tell you about on their own. 
Observation can help you see things from a different point of view

scope management
A prototype shows users what your 
product will be like 
Sometimes the best way to get your stakeholders to give you an opinion on what your 
product should be is to show it to them in a prototype. Prototypes are models of the 
product that you’re going to build that give your stakeholders a better idea of what 
your team is thinking. Sometimes users who are experimenting with a prototype will 
come up with a brand new requirement that they never thought of before. If you can 
get them to find it in the prototype, it’s a lot easier to deal with than if you wait until 
the end of the project to show to them. When you’re making a really complicated 
product, it can make sense to prototype it as part of the requirements collection 
process so that you can find changes that your users will ask for early on.  
Prototypes are a great tool if you’re developing your project using iterative techniques. 
If you’re using agile software development processes or defining requirements in 
phases, prototypes are a great way to keep your stakeholders involved in the project 
and get their feedback on changes that might be needed. 
Q:In my company, business analysts collect the requirements, 
not project managers. Why do I need to know all this stuff?
A: Good point. A lot of project teams will have a business 
analyst who will work on gathering requirements for the project and 
writing specifications for it. As the project manager, though, you are 
responsible for making sure that the needs of all of the stakeholders 
are met. So it’s a good idea for you to stay on top of the requirements 
collection process, and be an active participant in it.

Some organizations even divide up the requirements-gathering 
activities into project requirements and product requirements. The 
project requirements would be things like staying within the budget, 
meeting specific deadlines, and using a certain number of resources, 
while product requirements would be about features of the product. 
Even if you are lucky enough to have a business analyst on your 
project to help you gather requirements, you’d better understand both 
the project and product requirements if you’re going to keep your 
project on track. 
Q: Can I just skip these requirements-gathering tools and 
jump straight into code? We do iterative development where I 
work. That means I can jump right in and plan the work as it’s 
happening, right?
A: The short answer is no. The more you know up front, the easier 
it’s going to be for you to plan out your project. Even iterative projects 
must plan out their requirements for each phase up front. Now, it’s 
true that you should be able to get through the Collect Requirements 
process more quickly if you’re only gathering requirements for a 
small phase of your project, but it doesn’t mean that you can skip 
requirements altogether. 
Q: How do I know when I’m done collecting requirements?
A: That’s a good question. Your requirements need to be 
measurable to be complete. So it’s not enough to write down that you 
want good performance in your product. You need to be able to tell 
people what measurement counts as good performance for you. You 
have to be able to confirm that all of your requirements are met when 
you close out your project, so you can’t leave requirements up to 
interpretation. 
You know your requirements are 
complete when you’ve got a way to 
verify each of them once they’re 
built.

where your requirements live
CGW III Requirements Document
1. Introduction
CGW II was a huge hit. We’ve done some market research and some internal brainstorming and 
compiled these requirements for Cows Gone Wild III: The Milkening, which will be released next year in 
time for the holidays. 
2. Organizational Impact
This product will have an impact on many departments at Ranch Hand Games, including Research and 
Development, Marketing, Distribution, Shipping, Administration, Finance, and Customer Service. 
3. Functional requirements
Name
RU001—Include Underwater levels.
Summary
The cows will need to be able to move around under water.
Rationale
Underwater environment was the single biggest request from polled gamers. 
Requirement
Cows will need to be able to swim, and underwater puzzles will need to be 
developed that require swimming.
...
4. Nonfunctional requirements
Name
RNF001—Performance as good or better than CGW II.
Summary
The new functionality cannot slow down game play.
Rationale
Gamers were very happy with the performance upgrades in CGW II. 
We cannot be seen as losing that improvement in the next version. 
Requirement
All levels must load in under 15 seconds. All online levels must load 
in under 25 seconds over a cable connection at 256K.
Now you’re ready to write a requirements document 
The outputs of the Collect Requirements process are the requirements document and a 
requirements traceability matrix, which allows you to follow the requirements from the 
document through implementation and verification.
This requirement 
is measurable. If 
the end product 
has puzzles that 
involve swimming, 
the requirement 
will pass its test. 
If not, it will fail.
Outputs
The requirements document needs to list all of the functional and nonfunctional requirements of your product. 
Functional requirements are most of the kinds of things that you think of right away: new features, bug fixes, and 
new or different behavior. Nonfunctional requirements are sometimes called quality attributes because they’re things 
that you expect from your deliverables, but aren’t specific features. Some examples of nonfunctional requirements are 
performance, reliability, error handling, and ease of use.
Here, you can load 
the levels and time 
it to figure out if 
the product meets 
its requirements.

CGW II Requirements Management
The Requirements Collection Process:
The following techniques will be used for requirements elicitation:
	
1. Questionnaires and surveys
	
2. Facilitated workshops
	
3. Delphi technique
	
4. Focus groups
	
5. Interviews
	
6. Observation
They will be prioritized based on strategic alignment with CGW III’s 
business case document. 
Requirements will be managed as part of integrated change 
control once approved. 

Product scope means the 
features and functions of the 
product or service being built. 
Project scope means the 
work that’s needed to build the 
product.

Functional requirements are 
the behavior of the product. 
Nonfunctional requirements 
are implicit expectations about 
the product.

Scope Management is about 
figuring out all of the work 
that’s going to be needed for 
the project, and making sure 
only that work is done—and 
nothing else.

The Scope Management 
plan is created as part of the 
Project Management plan. 
It defines the process you’ll 
use for defining scope and 
managing changes to it. 

You’ll need to know the order 
of processes for the exam. 
A good way to remember 
them is to understand how the 
output of one process is used 
as the input for another.

a quick high-level look at all your requirements 
and make sure they’re mapped to specific test

Write down the Collect Requirements tool or technique that’s being used in each one of these 
scenarios.
1. The team got together to come up with ideas for the game. As they thought of them, they 
grouped them on different colored index cards and used thumb tacks to arrange them on a 
bulletin board by type.
2. Ranch Hand Games listed questions for people visiting the website to answer in exchange 
for a game promo coupon. 
3. The team got together to brainstorm and periodically voted to rank requirements and 
separate the least important from the most important.

Define the scope of the project
Now that the Ranch Hand team has a project manager, everything will go smoothly, right? 
Well, not exactly. Just assigning a project manager isn’t enough to get the scope under control. 
That’s why you need the Define Scope process. Even the best project managers need to rely 
on things from the company and the people around them. That’s why the inputs to Define 
Scope are so important. They contain everything you need to know before you can begin to 
break the project down into the work that the team members will do.
All of those requirements 
you collected are an input 
to Define Scope.
You’ll need this because it tells you 
the business needs, and who your 
sponsor and stakeholders are.
Just like with the Scope 
Management plan, templates and 
forms will help save you time.

Management plan
You’ll keep referring to the 
Scope Management plan 
through all of the Scope 
Management processes. 
It’s where you keep all the 
work you did to plan out 
how you’ll collect scope 
information and monitor 
and control your scope 
through the project. 

188    Chapter 5
How do you define the scope?
You already got a head start on defining the project scope when you wrote down the 
requirements. But now you need to go a lot further and write down all of the work that you 
and your team are going to do over the course of the project. Luckily, the Define Scope 
process tools and techniques are there to help guide you through creating the project 
scope statement (which you’ll learn about in a minute).
Facilitated workshops
When you do facilitated workshops with 
your stakeholders, figure out what they 
need, and write it all down. The reason 
you do this is because you need to make 
sure that what you’re delivering really 
meets the needs of the stakeholders. 
This keeps the team from delivering a 
poor product.
An important part of stakeholder 
analysis is doing your best to set 
quantifiable goals. That means 
writing down specific project goals that 
you can measure, which makes it a lot 
easier for the team to plan for the work 
they have to do.
VS.
Product analysis
Remember product versus project scope? People 
naturally think about the product they are making 
when they start to define the scope. This tool is all 
about turning those things into project work that 
needs to be done.
Once the work is complete, you’re going to have 
to make sure that what you’re delivering matches 
what you put in your requirements. The better your 
product analysis is at the start of the project, the 
happier your stakeholders will be with the product, 
and the less likely it is that you’ll discover painful, 
last-minute problems at the end.

C.
 Q: Is product analysis the same as 
requirements gathering?
A: Not exactly. When people gather 
requirements, they’re trying to understand 
what needs the product should fill. 
Requirements are the contents of the 
product. When you use product analysis 
to define the scope of the work to be done, 
you’re figuring out what deliverables the 
team needs to work on in order to build 
your project scope statement. So product 
analysis is concerned with how the work 
will be done, not what’s in it.
Q: What if there is only one way 
to do something? Do I still need to do 
alternatives identification?
A: There aren’t too many things out 
there that can only be done one way, but 
if you happen across one, then you don’t 
have to spend much time on alternative 
identification because there aren’t any 
alternatives to identify.


Q: What if a stakeholder can’t tell 
me how to measure his needs?
A: That can get kind of tricky. 
Sometimes stakeholders know that 
they want things to get better, but they 
don’t know how to tell when they’ve 
succeeded. You need to work with them 
to find something that can be measured 
in their ideas about project success. 
Without a way to measure your success, 
you won’t know whether or not you are 
accomplishing your goals.

I’m glad we’re finally getting a chance to chat in 
person.

I wouldn’t say that! It’s just that, well, I think it’s not 
hard to see why I’m such a critical part of Scope 
Management.
Well, it ought to be. I mean, you wouldn’t even exist 
if it weren’t for me.
There’s no work to do if there’s no product and 
without me, nobody knows what to build. So 
without me, really, who needs you?





But they still need me to tell them what to build. I 
tell everybody what the product needs to be. 


That’s true. And it’s no wonder that so many 
projects have problems. But the more you know up 
front, the easier it is to plan for what might happen 
along the way. 
Project Scope Statement:

Really? I never got the impression that you had 
much respect for me.


Typical. Everything’s about you.

How do you figure?



Now that’s just not fair. You think that just 
because people get together and talk about you in 
focus groups and brainstorming sessions, you’re 
something special. Without me, people would be 
arguing over your requirements forever. I’m the one 
who puts limits on all of this stuff. 
That may be true, but think about it for a minute. 
Your requirements almost always change from 
the time you start the project until it ends. You’re 
so high-maintenance. You hardly ever hear of a 
project where the team gets all of the requirements 
right from the beginning. And when you change, I 
have to change too. It’s so obnoxious.

Requirements Documentation:
I guess that means that knowing the project scope 
up front is pretty important too, now that I think 
about it. 

But you’re so broad. I mean, if you really want to 
know what’s getting done on a project, you have to 
look at me. I represent the need the project is filling; 
without me, it never would’ve happened in the first 
place.
That seems almost as important as my job to me.

The 
BEST 
answer
When 
you’re taking 
any sort of exam, the more familiar 
you are with it, the more relaxed you’ll be. And one 
way to get familiar with the PMP exam is to get to 
know the different kinds of questions you’ll see. One 
important sort is the “Which-is-BEST” question.
The Which-is-BEST 
question may have 
more than one good 
answer, but it only 
has one BEST answer.
Question Clinic: The “which-is-BEST” question
36. You are the project manager for a building 
contracting project. You schedule a meeting with 
your customer and stakeholders to give them 
an update on the progress of the project. At that 
meeting, they tell you that certain deliverables need 
to be changed before they can be accepted. Which is 
the BEST way for you to proceed?
A.	 Inform the stakeholders that they have no 
authority to decide what deliverables are 
acceptable.
B.	 Consult the project charter and use it to show 
the stakeholders that you are the authorized 
project manager.
C.	 Figure out what needs to be fixed so that you 
can tell the team how to make the deliverables 
acceptable.
D.	 Document the requested changes so that you 
can put them through change control.
The which-is-BEST 
question sometimes 
starts with a sentence 
or two talking about a 
particular situation.
This is one of those questions 
where “customer” is used in 
place of “sponsor.”
OK, now you have enough 
information to answer the 
question. What do you do 
when you find out that 
certain deliverables need to 
change?
Some of the answers 
will simply be wrong. 
You should be able to 
eliminate them first.
This one sounds good… That’s what the 
project charter is for, right? But wait 
a minute! What does the charter have 
to do with the scope of the work?
OK, this actually seems right—you 
do need to do that. But is it really 
the BEST answer?
Aha! Here’s the BEST answer! Even 
though C was technically correct, 
D is a much better description of 
how change control actually works.

Create WBS
Work breakdown 
structure
what’s in the scope statement?
Create the work breakdown structure
The Create WBS process is the most important process in the Scope Management 
knowledge area because it’s where you actually figure out all the work you’re going to 
do. It’s where you create the work breakdown structure (or WBS), which is the 
main Scope Management output. Every single thing that anyone on the project team—
including you—will do is written down in the WBS somewhere.
This isn’t the only output of 
the Create WBS process, but 
it’s the most important one.
Collect Requirements
Define Scope
The outputs from Collect Requirements 
and Define Scope become inputs to the 
Create WBS process.
The work breakdown 
structure is part of WBS

about that in just a minute.

Inputs
The inputs for the WBS come from other processes
You’ve already seen all of the inputs that you need to create the WBS. It shouldn’t be 
too surprising that you need the requirements document, project scope statement, and 
organizational process assets before you create the WBS. When you’re developing these 
things, you’re learning what you need to know in order to decompose the project work.
The forms and templates 
here will be really useful! 
When you’re building these, you’re 
doing the research and making the 
contacts you need to build the WBS.
Organizational
process assets
That’s what they’re there for!
On the next page, you’ll see what a WBS 
looks like. When you go to build one 
yourself for your next project, you don’t 
need to start from nothing. You’ll usually 
start with a template that you get from the 
organizational process asset library.

1.1 Initiating

1.3 Executing
Breaking down the work
One way to get a clear picture of all of the work that needs to be done on a 
project is to create a work breakdown structure. The WBS doesn’t show the 
order of the work packages or any dependencies between them. Its only goal is 
to show the work involved in creating the product. 
The WBS doesn’t try to establish the order that the 
team will perform each work package. Work packages can 
be listed in any order as long as they are in the right 
category. For example, creating the project scope baseline 
happens AFTER the WBS, even though they’re not listed 
here in that order.

Why would you break the project down by phase rather 
than deliverable? Why would you want to break it down by

Break it down by project or phase
A WBS can be structured any way it makes the most sense to you and your project 
team. The two most common ways of visualizing the work are by deliverable or by 
phase. Breaking down the work makes it easier to manage, because it means you 
are less likely to forget work packages that need 
to be included. This is the same project as the 
one on the left, but this time, it’s broken down 
by deliverable.

This WBS isn’t done—it doesn’t 
show any of the work related to 
creating the product. Those would 
need to be filled out before this 
chart could be finished. 
We haven’t talked 
about this one yet. 
But it’s coming up next. 
There are many project 
management deliverables 
not mentioned in this 
WBS, but some of the 
ones we have already 
covered are here. 
Each of these things is 
called a work package.
It’s a unit of work that you and your 
team use to organize the stuff you’re 
going to have to do to get the project 
done. The work package is the lowest 
level on a WBS; the higher levels are 
used to categorize the work packages. 
When you roll them all up into one 
big WBS, you get a complete picture 
of everything that the team will do 
over the course of the project.
Every work package in the WBS has 
a unique number, usually an outline 
number like in your word processor. 
You use the number to identify each 
work package and its category.
These are the same 
phases we talked 
about in Chapter 3.

Decompose deliverables into work packages
Creating the WBS is all about taking deliverables and coming up with work 
packages that will create them. When you do that, it’s called decomposition, 
and it’s the main tool you use to create a WBS. 
Organize the project 
based on how you work
Make sure the team has enough 
information about the work 
package to get the job done
Each work package has to 
be compact enough to make 
it easy to organize
This means you should begin to 
think about how you’re going 
to estimate the work packages 
when you’re decomposing them. 
We’ll talk more about this in 
the next chapter.
So you need to talk to the 
team. Are they satisfied that 
you’ve given them enough detail 
to do the job?
Start with a major 
deliverable.
Then begin 
breaking down 
the project 
into smaller and 
smaller pieces.
At the end of decomposition, 
you end up with a bunch of 
work packages that add up 
to the major deliverable.

You’ll need to understand decomposition for the exam. Here are a 
few deliverables from Cows Gone Wild III. Based on what you’ve seen 
so far, decompose them into work packages. There are no right or 
wrong answers—this is practice for thinking about decomposition.
You won’t find any solutions for this, because there aren’t 
any right or wrong answers! It’s your chance to take a minute 
to think things through—that’ll get it into your brain.

Project Scope Management Magnets
Understanding how to build a work breakdown structure is very 
important for the exam—it’s one of the most important parts of the 
Scope Management knowledge area. Here’s your chance to create a 
WBS for Cows Gone Wild III: The Milkening. There are two ways you can 
break down the work. See if you can use decomposition to do it!
On this page, create a work breakdown structure broken down 
by project phase.
We’ve filled in a few 
work packages to get you 
started.

Oops! Looks like the magnets fell off the fridge. Here’s your chance 
to practice breaking down the work to create a different WBS using 
the same magnets as before. But this time, instead of decomposing

You can break down the 
work for a project in 
any number of ways.
It’s OK if you decided that, say, creating 
scenery is a work package under construction, 
not design. The important thing here is to 
learn about the WBS, not video game design.
 Can you think of a reason that Mike would break down Cows Gone Wild III work by phase? 
Can you think of why he’d break it down by deliverable?

Did you notice how the project management work packages are the 
same in both WBSes? You could break them down into more detailed 
project management deliverables, and then you’d see a difference.
This WBS has the same work 
packages, but they’re broken 
down differently.

Inside the work package
You’ve probably noticed that the work breakdown structure only shows you the 
name of each work package. That’s not enough to do the work! You and your 
team need to know a lot more about the work that has to be done. That’s where 
the WBS dictionary comes in handy. It brings along all of the details you 
need to do the project work. The WBS dictionary is an important output of the 
Create WBS process—the WBS wouldn’t be nearly as useful without it.
The WBS dictionary 
contains the details of 
every work package. 
It’s a separate output 
of the Create WBS 
process.
This is one of the WBS Dictionary entries for 
the Cows Gone Wild III project. It goes with 
the “Test Software” work package in the WBS.
Each work package has a 
name, and in many WBSes 
the work packages will also 
have ID numbers.
This is just a 
description 
of the work 
that needs to 
be done.
Each work package 
should be small enough 
to make cost and 
resource estimates.
*This account identifier 
is important—it’s how you 
hook your WBS into your 
company’s accounting system. 
That way, you can make 
sure all of the work is paid 
for.
Don’t forget 
that the WBS 
doesn’t show 
dependencies 
among work 
packages.
Here’s what the WBS 
entry would look like 
with this ID number.
3.2.4 – Test Software

you are here 4    207
scope management
It will help you on the exam to know why all of the outputs 
are important, and the WBS is one of the most important ones. 
Write down as many reasons for using a WBS as you can think of.
 Q: Does the work breakdown 
structure need to be graphical? It looks 
like a lot of work. Can’t I just write out a 
list of tasks?
A: Yes, the WBS has to be graphical. 
The WBS needs to show all of the work 
packages, and how they decompose into 
phases or deliverables. When you look 
at a simple WBS, it might seem like you 
could manage your work packages just as 
efficiently using a simple list. But what if
you have a large team with dozens, 
hundreds, or even thousands of work 
packages? That’s when you’ll be really 
happy that you know how to decompose 
deliverables into a hierarchy.
Q: What if one work package depends 
on another one?
A: There are definitely dependencies 
among work packages. For example, the 
Ranch Hand QA team can’t begin to test the 
software until the programming team has 
finished building it. But while this information 
is important, the WBS isn’t where you figure 
out the dependencies.
The reason is that you need to figure out 
what work needs to be done before you start 
to figure out how the work packages depend 
on each other.

Q: What if I don’t know enough to 
estimate the cost of a work package? 
What do I add to the WBS dictionary?
A: The WBS dictionary should contain 
only information that you can fill in when you 
create it. A lot of the time, you’ll know all of 
the information that needs to go into it.
If you have an estimate and know the 
resources that should be used, then put it 
in. But if all you have is a statement of work 
and an account code, then that’s all the 
information you’ll be able to add to the entry.
Here’s another chance for you to think things through. 
Putting it down on paper helps the cognitive process.

208    Chapter 5
The project scope baseline is a snapshot of the plan
As the project goes on, you will want to compare how you are doing to what 
you planned for. So, the project scope baseline is there to compare 
against. It’s made up of the project scope statement, the WBS, and the WBS 
dictionary. When work gets added to the scope through change control, you 
need to change the baseline to include the new work packages for that work, 
so you can always track yourself against the plan. 
Yes. When there’s a change you 
need to take a new snapshot.
Whenever a change is approved through 
change control, the project scope baseline 
needs to be updated. Approved changes are 
changes to the Scope Management plan 
also, so it’s important that you re-baseline 
your project when they are approved. That 
way, you’ll always be comparing your 
performance to the most updated plan.
So, if someone 
wants to add or 
remove work packages, 
that’s a change?

you are here 4    209
scope management
 Q: What happens if I need to change 
the scope?
A: You need to put it through change 
control—just like a change to the product 
scope. As you’re building the product, it’s 
always possible that some work will pop up 
in an unexpected place.

It could be that the initial technical design 
is inadequate or buggy. Or maybe you just 
think of a better way to do things while 
you’re working. In either case, you have 
to determine the impact to the schedule, 
the budget, the scope, and the quality of 
the product, and put the proposed change 
through change control. That’s what it means 
to look at the project constraints every time 
there’s a change.

Once everyone understands the impact 
and approves the change, you need to go 
back and adjust your project scope baseline 
to include the new work. If your budget or 
schedule is affected, you’ll need to change 
those baselines too and integrate all of them 
into the Project Management plan. But we’ll 
talk more about that in later chapters.
Q: Do I really need to create a project 
scope baseline?
A: Yes. It might seem like a formality in 
the beginning, but the baseline is a really 
useful tool. As you are building your project, 
you will need to refer back to the baseline 
if you want to know how you are tracking 
against stakeholders’ expectations.

Let’s say you said it would take you 12 
months to build Cows Gone Wild III, and 
a wrong technical decision creates a two-
week delay. You can use the project scope 
baseline to figure out the impact of that 
change to all of the different plans you have 
made, and then explain to everybody the 
impact of the change.

You can think of the baseline as a way 
of keeping track of the project team’s 
understanding of their goals and how they 
are going to meet them. If the goals change, 
then the understanding of them needs to 
change too. By telling everyone who needs 
to approve the two-week delay about it, you 
make sure that the goals change for the 
team as well. Then you change the baseline, 
so you can measure your team against the 
new deadline of 12 and a half months.
Q: Wait a minute. Doesn’t that mean I 
need to do change control and update the 
baseline every time I make any change to 
the document while I’m writing it? That’s 
going to make it really hard to write the 
first version of anything!
A: Don’t worry, you don’t have to go 
through change control until the baseline is 
approved. And that goes for ANY document 
or deliverable. Once it’s accepted and 
approved by all of the stakeholders, only 
then do the changes need to go through 
change control. Until it’s approved, you can 
make any changes you want. That’s the 
whole reason for change control—to make 
sure that once a deliverable is approved, you 
run all of the changes by a change control
board to make sure that they don’t cause an 
unacceptable impact to the schedule, scope, 
cost, or quality.
Q: How can you know all of this up 
front?
A: You can’t. Even the best planned 
projects have a few surprises. That’s why 
the scope planning cycle is iterative. As you 
find out something new about your scope 
of work, you put it through change control. 
When it’s approved, you need to add it to 
your Scope Management plan, your project 
scope statement, your WBS, and your WBS 
dictionary.

It’s also possible that you might find new 
things that the team should do when you’re 
making your WBS or your project scope 
statement. So all of the scope planning 
documents are closely linked and need to be 
kept in sync with one another.
Q: What if I come up with new work for 
the team later on?
A: You use change control to update 
the baseline. Your project can change at 
any time, but before you make a change 
you need to figure out how it will affect the 
project constraints—and make sure your 
sponsors and stakeholders are OK with that 
impact. That’s what change control does for 
you.
Any time you make a change, you need to get it 
approved, and then update the baseline.

210    Chapter 5
The outputs of the Create WBS process
The Create WBS process has three major outputs: the work breakdown 
structure, the WBS dictionary, and the baseline. But there are others as 
well. When you create the WBS, you usually figure out that there are pieces of 
the scope that you missed, and you may realize that you need to change your 
plan. That’s what the project document updates are for.
We’ve already seen the most important ones.
This means changes to the 
Project Management plan and 
other project documents.
When you’re creating the 
WBS, you often discover 
missing pieces of the scope. 
You’ll need to go back and 
plan for them. That kicks 
off the planning cycle again. 

The Create WBS process is a 
really important process on the 
PMP exam.

You create the WBS by 
decomposing large work products 
into work packages. 

To finalize the WBS, control 
accounts are established for the 
work packages.

The WBS dictionary is a 
description of each work package 
listed in the WBS.

The inputs to WBS creation are the 
outputs to the Define Scope and 
Collect Requirements processes: 
the requirements document and 
the project scope statement. 

As you decompose the work, you 
find new information that needs 
to be added to the requirements 
document and the project scope 
statement. That information is 
treated as a change and goes 
through change control. Once it’s 
approved, it can be added into the 
document, and that kicks off the 
planning cycle again.

Make sure you finalize the WBS
Before your WBS is done, you need to finalize it. You do 
this by establishing a set of control accounts for the work 
packages. A control account is a tool that your company’s 
management and accountants use to track the individual 
work packages. For example, Mike gets a list of control 
accounts from Ranch Hand Games’ accounting department, 
so they know how to categorize the work for tax purposes.

you are here 4    211
scope management
Q: How do I know if I should use phases or deliverables for 
my WBS?
A: It really depends on the project. You want to present the 
information so that it allows the management in your organization the 
ability to visualize and control your project. So, if most people in your 
organization divide it by phases, then you should, too.

If people do it different ways from project to project where you work, 
then you might make your decision based on how people think about 
the work you are about to do.

The point behind the WBS is to help other people see the work that 
is necessary to get the project done, so if your management thinks 
of projects in terms of phases and understands them best that way, 
then it’s better to divide your project work along those lines.

It could be that the work you are doing is anxiously awaited by a lot 
of people who will look at the WBS to understand the project, and, 
in that case, it probably makes sense to divide your work up by 
deliverable. 

Q: How do I know when I have decomposed the work to a 
small enough work package?
A: The short answer is that you should decompose that work until 
it is manageable.

You need to be careful when you come up with the work packages for 
your WBS. If you decompose to the most granular level, you could 
end up wasting everybody’s time trying to figure out exactly how 
much effort goes into, say, writing up meeting minutes for each and 
every meeting in your project.

So, you should break down the work to small enough packages that 
everybody can understand what’s being done and describe it in the 
dictionary…and no further. 
Q: I know how to make scope changes during Planning. What 
do I do if I run into scope changes during Execution?
A: Any time you run into a change to your scope, regardless of 
where you are in the process, you put it through change control. Only 
after examining the impact and having the change approved can you 
incorporate the change.
We’ve planned 
the scope and we’ve 
broken down the 
work for Cows Gone 
Wild III. Now we’re 
ready to begin the 
project!
Q: Can you back up a minute and go over the difference 
between the Scope Management plan and the Project 
Management plan one more time?
A: Remember how the Project Management plan was divided into 
subsidiary plans? The Project Management plan tells you how to 
manage all of the different knowledge areas, and it has baselines for 
the scope, schedule, and budget.

The Scope Management plan is one of those subsidiary plans. It has 
really specific procedures for managing scope. For example, Mike’s 
Scope Management plan tells him which stakeholders he needs 
to talk to when he’s gathering requirements. It lists what tools and 
techniques he’s planning to use when he uses scope definition to 
define the scope (for example, it says that he needs to consult with 
specific experts when he does alternatives analysis). And when 
there’s an inevitable change—because even the best project manager 
can’t prevent every change—it gives him procedures for doing 
Scope Management. So even though the Scope Management plan is 
created in the Develop Project Management Plan process, it’s used 
throughout all of the Scope Management processes. So definitely 
expect questions about it on the exam!

Brian: At first I thought we could use the same five 
backgrounds over and over, but it’s starting to look 
really stale. 
Amy: Huh, I guess you’re right. It looks like we need to 
create more scenery.
Mike: Why were we trying to limit the backgrounds in 
the first place?
Amy: I think they were worried about disk space.
Brian: Yeah, but that’s not so much a concern right 
now.
Amy: Great! Let’s just change the artwork, then.
Mike: Not so fast, Amy. There are a couple of things 
we need to do first…
Everything is great. The project is rolling along, and there are no 
problems with the scope…until something goes wrong. 
Something’s not right 
with the artwork…

What homework do you need to do before you make a change to the 
scope by adding or removing project work? Why?
This is work that 
was not planned for, 
and isn’t in the WBS. 
That means it’s a 
scope change.

Why scope changes
Sometimes something completely unexpected happens. Say, a really important 
customer asks for a new feature that nobody saw coming and demands it right 
away. Or a design for a feature just isn’t working, and you need to rethink it. Or 
new stakeholders come on board and ask for changes.
The scope can change while you are working for a lot of reasons. Some changes 
are good for your project, while others will definitely reduce your chance of 
success. Change control is there to help you to see which is which. 
Good change
A good change makes the product better with very little 
downside. It doesn’t cost more time in the schedule or 
more money from the budget, and it doesn’t destabilize 
the product or otherwise threaten its quality.
Bad change
A bad change is one that might seem from the outside 
like a good idea but ends up making an impact on the 
project constraints. Here are a couple of examples:
Scope creep
This happens when you think you know the impact of a 
change so you go ahead, but it turns out that that change 
leads to another one, and since you are already making 
the first change, you go with the next. Then another 
change comes up, and another, and another, until it’s 
hard to tell what the scope of the project is.
Gold plating
Sometimes people think of a really great improvement 
to the product and go ahead and make it without even 
checking the impact. In software, this can happen pretty 
easily. A programmer thinks of a way to make a feature 
better, for example, and just implements it, without 
talking it over with anybody. This may sound good, but 
it’s not—because now you have to pay for these features 
you never asked for.
Good changes happen pretty 
rarely, and nearly EVERY 
change has some impact that 
should be fully explored before 
you go forward.
Be on the lookout for examples 
of scope creep and gold 
plating on the exam. Both are 
considered very bad and should 
never be done. 
The way to avoid 
scope creep is to 
plan your changes 
completely.

214    Chapter 5
Here’s the WBS that you created for the Cows Gone Wild III project, and below that are some 
changes that the team has asked Mike to make since the work started. All of them are bad changes. 
Check either scope creep or gold plating for each one.
Answers: 1, 3, and 4 are Scope creep. 2 is Gold plating
1. We need to create a screensaver to market the 
game. Let’s kill two birds with one stone and 
test out a brand new graphics engine on it. Oh, 
and we’ll need a story for the screensaver, so 
we should write that too. Of course we have to 
recruit some killer voice talent for the screensaver. 
Memorable names sell more games.

2. Testing the most recent build, I just noticed that if 
the player presses x–x–z–a–Shift–Shift–Space in 
that order, Bessie does the Charleston—it’s 
really funny.

  c  Scope creep  c  Gold plating
3. We should add a calculator for tracking gallons 
of milk collected in the game. It will be really 
easy. We could even release the calculator as a 
separate add-in, and we could probably make it 
full‑featured enough for the folks developing the 
game down the hall to use it too.

4. The printer just told us that she could also do silk 
screen T-shirts for everybody as a ship gift. Let’s 
get our design team to do some special artwork

The Control Scope process
There’s no way to predict every possible piece of work that you and your team are going to 
do in the project. Somewhere along the way, you or someone else will realize that a change 
needs to happen, and that change will affect the baseline. That’s why you need the Control 
Scope process. It’s how you make sure that you make only those changes to the scope that 
you need to make, and that everyone is clear on what the consequences of those changes 
are.
This came 
straight out of 
the Direct & 
Manage Project 
Execution 
process from 
the last 
chapter. It 
tells you how 
well the team’s 
been doing 
the job.

There’s only one tool in the Control Scope process:

compare the information that you’re gathering about 
the way the project’s going to affect your baseline.

Integrated

control
Anatomy of a change
Let’s take a closer look at what happens when you need to make a change. You 
can’t just go and change the project whenever you want—the whole reason that 
you have a baseline is so you can always know what work the team is supposed 
to do. If you make changes, then you need to change the baseline…which 
means you need to make sure that the change is really necessary. Luckily, you 
have some powerful tools to help you manage changes:
A change can come from anywhere–
the project manager, a team 
member, even a stakeholder!
Think of integrated change control as a 
kind of machine that converts requested 
changes into approved changes.
 A change is needed.
Every change starts the same way. Someone 
realizes that if the project sticks with the plan, 
then the outcome will lead to problems.
1
 Create a change request.
Before a change can be made, it needs to be 
approved. That means that it needs to be 
documented as a requested change. The only 
way to get a handle on a change is to write it 
down and make sure everyone understands it.
2
I know we’re under 
pressure to get the 
game out the door, but 
we need to make a change. 
We only planned on making 
four meadows on level 3 and 
reusing them for level 6, but 
it’s just not working for us. 
We’ve got to change this if 
we want the game to 
sell.
We’ll 
write up 
a change 
request, and then 
put it through 
Integrated 
Change Control 
to get it 
approved.
 Get the change approved.
Remember integrated change control from 
Chapter 4? That’s the process where the 
project manager takes a requested change and 
works with the sponsor and stakeholders to get 
approval to put it in place.

scope management
You’re weighing the change 
against the baseline to see 
if it’s going to require a 
big change to your plan.
This will come 
in handy when 
you go back to 
put together 
the lessons 
learned!
The change is done!
Now you can move on with the project 
using the new baseline that you saved 
and distributed to the team.
 Do variance analysis.
Take a look at the baseline and see how the change 
will affect it. This is where you decide whether you 
need to take some sort of corrective action. You 
compare the baseline against the change that you 
want to make, and figure out just how big the change 
really is.

 Create a new baseline.
Now that you’ve figured out that you need to change the 
scope, it’s time to update the baseline. Go back to the scope 
statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary, and update them so 
that they reflect the change that needs to be made.

The first step is to check

Since the change has been 
approved, it’s time to update 
the WBS and WBS dictionary.

A closer look at the change control system
One of the most important tools in any Monitoring and Controlling process is the 
change control system. Let’s take a closer look at how it works.
Since the folks at Ranch Hand need a change to add more scenery to Cows Gone 
Wild III, Mike takes a look at the Scope Management plan to understand the impact 
before forwarding it to the change control board. Once they approve the change, he 
updates the Project Management plan, checks it into the configuration management 
system, and changes the WBS and WBS dictionary to include the new work packages. 
Remember this from 
Chapter 4? It’s exactly 
the same change control 
system tool that we 
already learned about.
The PMIS is where the 
configuration management 
system is, so the changed 
plans go here.

scope management
Variance analysis
This means comparing the data that can be collected 
about the work being done to the baseline. When there is a 
difference between the two, that’s variance. 
This tool of Control Scope is all about analyzing the difference 
between the baseline and the actual work to figure out if 
the plan needs to be corrected. If so, then you recommend 
a corrective action and put that recommendation through 
change control.
The goal of 
Control Scope 
is updating the 
scope, plan, 
baseline, and 
WBS info.
Just one Control Scope tool/technique
There’s just one tool/technique in the Control Scope process. It’s pretty intuitive: 
take a minute and think of what you would need to do if you had to make a change 
to your project’s scope. You’d need to figure out how big the change is, and what 
needs to change. And when you do that, it’s called variance analysis.
A lot of things can happen along the way during a 
project, especially when you have a lot of changes. 
What happens if the deliverables you and the team build 
don’t quite match up to what your stakeholders expect?
There’s no “right order” for the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes
If you’ve got a copy of the PMBOK Guide handy, take a look at how it presents the Scope Management processes. Did 
you notice how the section on the Validate Scope process comes before Control Scope? We’re putting these processes in 
this book in a different order, and it’s the only time we deviate from the order of the PMBOK Guide. That’s not because 
the PMBOK Guide is wrong! We could do this because there is no “right” order: Control Scope can happen at any time, 
because project changes can happen at any time. Validate Scope (the next process you’ll learn about) is usually the last 
Scope Management process that you’ll do in a project. The trick is that sometimes you’ll find a scope problem while 
you’re verifying the scope, and you’ll need to do Control Scope and then go back and gather new requirements, rebuild 
the WBS, etc. So the Control Scope process can happen either before or after Validate Scope. 
So why did we change the order? Because thinking about how the two processes relate to each other will help you 
remember this for the exam!

220    Chapter 5
Q: Is Control Scope always about work and project 
scope? Can it ever be about deliverables and 
product scope?
A: No. The Control Scope process is always about 
the work that the team does, because the whole Scope 
Management knowledge area is about the project scope, 
not the product scope. In other words, as a project manager, 
you manage the work that the team is doing, not the things 
that they’re making. Now, that doesn’t mean you should 
never pay attention to deliverables. You still need to pay 
attention to the scope of the product, too, since the two are 
pretty closely related. For example, in the CGW III project, 
any time somebody wants to add a new feature to the game, 
a programmer will need to program it, an artist will need 
to make new artwork, and a tester will have to test it. Any 
time you make changes to the project scope, it affects the 
product scope, and vice versa.
Q: What if a change is really small? Do I still have to 
go through all of this?
A: Yes. Sometimes what seems like a really small change 
to the scope—like just adding one tiny work package—turns 
out to be really complex when you take a closer look at it. It 
could have a whole lot of dependencies, or cause a lot of 
trouble in other work packages. If you don’t give it careful 
consideration, you could find yourself watching your scope 
creep out of control. Each and every change needs to be 
evaluated in terms of impact. If there is any impact to the 
project constraints—time, cost, scope, quality, resources, or 
risk—you HAVE to put it through change control. 
Q: How can you do variance analysis without 
knowing all of the changes that are going 
to happen?
A: You do variance analysis as an ongoing thing. As 
information comes in about your project, you constantly 
compare it to how you planned. If you’re running a month 
behind, that’s a good indication that there are some work 
packages that took longer than your team estimated—or 
that you missed a few altogether. Either way, you need 
to take corrective action if you hope to meet your project 
objectives.

Waiting until all possible changes are known will be too 
late for you to actually meet your goals. So you need to 
constantly check your actuals versus your baseline and 
correct where necessary (after putting your recommended 
actions through change control, of course!). 
Q: I thought the configuration management system 
was part of the project management information system 
from Chapter 4. What does that have to do with change 
control? 
A: When you write and modify documents throughout 
your project, you need to make sure that everybody is 
working with the same version of them. So you check them 
into a configuration management system, and that way 
everybody always knows where to go for the latest version.
Since you are checking all of your documents in, that’s 
where you will keep your work performance information also. 
The most recent version of the schedule, any reports you 
have gathered on defects, and individual work performance 
should all be there. So, when you want to figure out what’s 
going on in your project, you look there first.
It follows that you would modify your documents and 
check them back into the CMS after any change has been 
approved too.
Every scope change 
goes through the 
Control Scope process.

The whole idea behind change control is that 
you start by figuring out that a change 
needs to be made, you make sure the change 
is really worth making, and then you update 
your baseline so you can keep track of it.
Remember, Control Scope 
is all about changes to the 
baseline. 
Ask the stakeholders.
You need to go back to the stakeholders 
and get formal acceptance. That’s what 
the Validate Scope process is for, and it’s

The stakeholders decide when the project is done
As you deliver the stuff in your scope statement, you need to make sure that each 
of the deliverables has everything in it that you listed in the scope statement. You 
inspect all of your deliverables versus the scope statement, the WBS, and the 
Scope Management plan. If your deliverables have everything in those documents, 
then they should be acceptable to stakeholders. When all of the deliverables in the 
scope are done to their satisfaction, then you’re done.

Is the project ready to go?
Once the deliverables are ready for prime time, you inspect them with 
the stakeholders to make sure that they meet acceptance criteria. The 
purpose of Validate Scope is to obtain formal, written acceptance of the 
work products. If they are found to be unsatisfactory, the specific changes 
requested by the stakeholders get sent to change control so that the right 
changes can be made.
If the deliverables are not 
acceptable, the project goes

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: C
The work breakdown structure is all about breaking down the work that your team needs to do. The WBS is graphical 
and hierarchical, not linear and unstructured. Did you notice that answer B was about product scope, not project scope?
2. Answer: A
There are two ways you can get to the right answer for this question. You can recognize that the WBS dictionary, 
change requests, and accepted deliverables are all Scope Management process outputs. (You’ll see change requests in 
every knowledge area!) But you can also recognize that the business case was created by the Develop Project Charter, 
which is part of the Initiating process group.
3. Answer: A
Did you recognize that answer A was describing the Scope Management plan? Once you know what the WBS is used 
for and how to make one, questions like this make sense.
4. Answer: C
You’ll need to know what order processes come in, and one good way to do that is to think 
about how the outputs of some processes are used as inputs for another. For example, you 
can’t create the WBS until the scope is defined, which is why A is wrong. And you can’t do 
change control until you have a baseline WBS, which is why B is wrong. 
5. Answer: B
An important tactic for a lot of exam questions is to be able to recognize a particular tool, technique, input, or output 
from a description. What have you learned about that tells you who is responsible for a work package, tells what control 
account to associate with it, and describes the work associated with it? That’s a good description of the WBS dictionary.
6. Answer: B
 There are some questions where you’ll just have to know what a process is all about, and this is one of them. That’s 
why it’s really helpful to know why Validate Scope is so helpful to you on a project. You use Validate Scope to check that 
all of the work packages were completed, and get the stakeholders and sponsor to formally accept the deliverables.
Take a minute and think about how there’s no “right” order for Validate Scope and 
Control Scope. You could have a scope change at the beginning of the project, so 
Control Scope would come first. But a change could happen late in the project, too! If 
there’s a major change to the project after the scope’s verified, you need to redo it.
exam answers
Inspection isn’t just done at the end of the 
project. You do Validate Scope on every 
single deliverable made by you and the team.

Exam Questions
Answers
The PMBOK Guide says this stuff 
is stored in a “corporate knowledge 
base,” but that’s just another word 
for a file cabinet or a folder on your 
network.
7. Answer: A
 It’s easy to forget that organizational process assets is more than just an input. It’s a real thing that’s part of your 
company. Take a second and think about what assets are in your organization that help you carry out each process. 
Get it? Good! So what is historical information, anyway? It’s stuff like reports and data that you or another project 
manager wrote down on a previous project and stored in a file cabinet or a database. That’s an asset you can use 
now! What are lessons learned? Those are lessons you wrote down at the end of a previous project and stuck in a file 
cabinet or a database. And now those lessons are another asset you can use.
8. Answer: C
One thing to remember about change control is that if you want to make the sponsor and stakeholders happy with 
the project in the end, sometimes you have to tell them “no” right now. When you’re doing Control Scope, the most 
important tool you use is the change control system. It tells you how to take an approved change and put it in place on 
a project, and there’s no other way that you should ever make a change to any part of the baseline. That means that 
once everyone has approved the scope statement and WBS, if you want to make any change to them, then you need 
to get that change approved and put it through the change control system.
9. Answer: C
The requirements traceability matrix is a tool that you use to trace each requirement back to a specific business case, 
and then forward to the rest of the scope deliverables (like specific WBS work packages), as well as other parts of 
the project: the product design (like specific levels in Cows Gone Wild) or test strategy (like test plans that the Ranch 
Hand Games testers use to make sure that the game works).
These 
inputs and outputs 
make sense when I think 
about how I’d use them on a 
project. Organizational Process 
Assets are just things that 
my organization keeps track 
of to help me do my job, like 
information from old projects 
and procedures.
The idea is that you’re tracing a deliverable 
from its initial description all the way 
through the project to testing, so that you 
can make sure that every single deliverable 
meets all of its requirements.

238    Chapter 5
10. Answer: B
When you’re getting the sponsor and stakeholders to formally accept the results of the project, you’re doing Validate 
Scope. There’s only one tool for it: inspection. That means carefully checking the deliverables (in this case, what the 
workers built on the highway) to make sure they match the WBS.
11. Answer: B
This question is a little tricky. The most important thing about a WBS is that if your Scope Management plan says 
it should be there, then your project absolutely cannot be done without it. And a general rule is that if you ever find 
that there is no WBS, you should always check the Scope Management plan to find out why.
12. Answer: B
This is another question that is testing you on the definition of a specific document, in this case the Scope 
Management plan, which is one of the subsidiary plans of the Project Management plan. Think about what you use 
a Scope Management plan for. It gives you specific procedures for defining the scope, breaking down the work, 
verifying the deliverables, and managing scope changes—which is what this question is asking. All of the other 
answers don’t have anything to do with managing changes.
Exam Questions
Answers
Answer D is a good idea, but it’s not 
as important as creating a new WBS.
That way, if I 
need to restart 
the project later 
or reuse some of its 
deliverables, I’ll 
know exactly where my 
team left off when it 
ended.
13. Answer: A
Here’s another example of how there are two correct answers but only one 
BEST one. Answer C is true—you are doing scope definition. But is that 
really the best way to describe this situation? Alternatives analysis is part 
of scope definition, and it’s a more accurate way to describe what’s going 
on here.
14. Answer: A
This question is an example of how you need to rely on more than just 
common sense to pass the PMP exam. All four of these answers could 
be good ways to handle a terminated project, but there’s only one of 
those answers that corresponds to what the PMBOK Guide says. When 
a project is terminated, you still need to complete the Validate Scope 
process. That way, you can document all of the work that has been 
completed, and the work that has not been completed.
When you look at a few ways to create 
a deliverable and then decide on the 
best one, that’s alternatives analysis.

Exam Questions
Answers
15. Answer: B
Are you starting to get the hang of how this change control stuff works? The baseline isn’t etched in stone, and 
you need to be able to change it, but you can’t just go ahead and make changes whenever you want. You need 
to document the change request and then put that request through change control. If it’s approved, then you can 
update the baseline so that it incorporates the change.
16. Answer: A
When a question asks you about what a particular document, input, or output contains, be on the lookout for 
answers that talk about a different document. What document do you know about that gives the project manager 
authorization to do the work? That’s what the project charter is for.
17. Answer: C
Sometimes Control Scope is easiest to think about as a kind of machine that turns approved changes into updates. 
It sucks in the approved changes and all of the other Scope Management stuff (the scope statement, WBS, and 
WBS dictionary), does all the stuff that it needs to do to update those things, and then spits out updates. And 
sometimes it spits out new requested changes because when you’re making changes to the WBS or scope 
statement you realize that you need to make even more changes.
18. Answer: A
Scope Identification is a made-up process. It didn’t 
appear in this chapter, and even though it sounds 
real, it’s wrong.
19. Answer: B
WBS templates are a great way to speed up 
creating the WBS, and the easiest way to create 
a template is to use one from a previous project. 
It is not a good idea to cut out deliverables, skip 
important outputs like the WBS dictionary, or make 
the sponsor do your job for you.
You definitely can’t just make 
the change and inform the 
sponsor later. All changes need 
to be approved.
I think of Perform 
Integrated Change 
Control as a machine 
that turns change 
requests into approved 
changes, and Control 
Scope as the machine that 
turns approved changes 
into updates to the 
baseline.
You can also use a 
template for the Scope 
Management plan.

This question asked you about the Define Scope process, but all of the answers describe various outputs. Which of 
these outputs matches Define Scope? Well, the main output of Define Scope is the scope statement, and answer C 
is a good description of the scope statement.
21. Answer: A
This question asked you where you defined the procedures for doing all of the Scope Management processes. 
Where do you find those procedures? You find them in the Project Management plan—specifically, the Scope 
Management subplan. And you build that in the Develop Project Management Plan process.
22. Answer: C
There’s only one document you’ve seen that shows you details of individual work packages and contains a control 
account, a statement of work, and a resource assignment. It’s the WBS dictionary.
23. Answer: D
When you read the question, it looks like the team really helped the project, right? But think about what happened: 
the team abandoned the plan, and then they made a change to the project without getting approval from the 
sponsor or stakeholders. Maybe they discovered a useful shortcut. But isn’t it possible that the shortcut the team 
found was already considered and rejected by the sponsor? That’s why change control is so important.
Hey, I’ll bet a good way 
to study for the exam is to

24. Answer: D
Some questions are just definition questions. When that definition is a “which-is-BEST” question, there could be an answer 
that makes some sense, and it’s tempting to stop with it. In this case, answer A sounds like it might be right. But if you read 
answer D, it’s much more accurate.
25. Answer: A
The question asked about the tools and techniques for Collect Requirements, and answer A is the only answer that has to 
do with the Create WBS process. The rest of the answers were descriptions of Collect Requirements tools and techniques: 
interviews (answer B), prototypes (answer C), and observations (answer D).
26. Answer: A
The three outputs of Collect Requirements are requirements documentation and the requirements traceability matrix. 
“Requirements Observations” isn’t really an output.
Keep an eye out for questions that describe an input 
or output and then ask you to name it. Look at each 
answer and think up your own descriptions for 
them—one of them will match the question. 
The easiest way to make sure you get questions 
like this right is to think about how each of those 
outputs are actually used later in the project.

Getting it done on time
Time management is what most people think of when they 
think of project managers.  It’s where the deadlines are set and met. It starts 
with figuring out what work you need to do, how you will do it, what resources you’ll 
use, and how long it will take. From there, it’s all about developing and controlling that 
schedule.

Rob and Rebecca have decided to tie the knot, but they don’t have 
much time to plan their wedding. They want the big day to be 
unforgettable. They want to invite a lot of people and show them all a 
great time.
But just thinking about all of the details involved is overwhelming. 
Somewhere around picking the paper for the invitations, the couple 
realize they need help…
They’ve always dreamed of 
a June wedding, but it’s 
already January.

Time management helps with aggressive timelines
Since there are so many different people involved in making the wedding go 
smoothly, it takes a lot of planning to make sure that all of the work happens 
in the right order, gets done by the right people, and doesn’t take too long. 
That’s what the Time Management knowledge area ­is all about.
Initially, Kathleen was worried that she didn’t have enough time to make sure 
everything was done properly. But she knew that she had some powerful time 
management tools on her side when she took the job, and they’ll help her 
make sure that everything will work out fine.

Outputs
Rob and Rebecca’s Wedding
Schedule Management Plan
Project Schedule Model Development: Kathleen will create a schedule model for the wedding using
Microsoft Project. It will be stored in an open document repository and updated on a weekly basis. The initial
schedule will be based on high-level estimates that will be refined at set intervals as requirements are defined
for the project. The schedule will be baselined whenever a change request is approved, and also at the 
following milestones:
	
	
Scope Statement Complete
	
	
Venue Booked
	
	
Invitations Sent
	
	
RSVPs Received
	
	
Bridesmaids 
Level of Accuracy: The initial schedule model is expected to be accurate by +/– 10%. As each week passes,
the schedule update increases the level of accuracy because the team knows more and more about the project. 
At the time of RSVPs received, the schedule model will be +/– 3% accurate. This possible 15% overage will be 
included in the team’s overall estimate as a contingency to assist in risk mitigation.
Units of Measure: All estimates will be provided in calendar days.
Organizational Procedures Links: The project schedule model will follow the organizational outline provided
by the WBS. All schedule status reports will follow the format provided in the WBS as well.
Project Schedule Model Maintenance: On a weekly basis, Kathleen will update the project schedule model
with individual % complete numbers on tasks to keep the schedule up to date.
Reporting Formats: Every Thursday, Kathleen will host a weekly status meeting to discuss how the project
is tracking to its estimates with Rob and Rebecca. The status report for this meeting will follow the standard
wedding planning status report template.

252    Chapter 6
Use the Define Activities process to break down the work 
Define Activities uses everything we already know about the project to divide the work into 
activities that can be estimated. The inputs for this process all come from the processes in the 
Scope Management and Integration Management knowledge areas. The first step in Time 
Management is figuring out how the project work breaks down into activities—and that’s what 
the Define Activities process is for.
You might want to look at all 
of the lessons from similar 
projects your company has 
done to get a good idea of 
what you need to do on the 
current one. 
The WBS and WBS 
dictionary have the work 
explained to the work 
package level. That’s more 
detailed than the scope 
statement, but still too 
high to estimate well. 
The project scope statement 
is still the main place to go to 
figure out what the project

Tools and techniques for Define Activities
Kathleen wrote down everything she knew about the project. She used 
the activity list from her last wedding as a guide and then thought about 
the things that Rob and Rebecca wanted that were different from her past 
projects. She broke those things down into activities and pulled everything 
together into an activity list. 
Decomposition
This means taking the work packages you defined in the 
Scope Management processes and breaking them down even 
further into activities that can be estimated.

of this tool!

254    Chapter 6
Rolling wave planning lets 
you plan as you go
Sometimes you start a project without knowing a lot about the work
that you’ll be doing later. Rolling wave planning lets you plan and 
schedule only the stuff that you know enough about to plan well.
If Kathleen were using rolling wave planning, she might write a 
schedule for only the tasks it takes to do the invitations, and leave the 
planning for the menu and the seating up in the air until she knows who 
will RSVP.
Rob and Rebecca probably wouldn’t be happy hearing that Kathleen 
was only going to plan for the invitations to be sent, though. They want 
to know that their wedding is going to happen on time. That’s why 
rolling wave planning should only be used in cases where it’s not possible 
to plan any other way.
Think back to the definition of a project in Chapter 2. Remember how 
projects are progressively elaborated? Rolling wave planning takes 
advantage of the fact that you know more about the project as you go to 
make plans more accurate. 
Q: How would you use experts to help you define tasks?
A: A wedding is something that a lot of people have experience 
with, but some projects are not as easy to get a handle on. If you 
were asked to manage a project in a new domain, you might want to 
ask an expert in that field to help you understand what activities were 
going to be involved.

Even in Kathleen’s case, access to a catering expert might help her 
think of some activities that she wouldn’t have planned for on 
her own.

It could be that you create an activity list and then have the expert 
review it and suggest changes. Or, you could involve the expert from 
the very beginning and ask to have a Define Activities conversation 
with him before even making your first draft of the activity list.
Q:I still don’t get rolling wave planning.
A: One way to develop a project is to divide it up into phases of 
work, and gather requirements for each phase as the previous one 
is completed. Sometimes projects are done iteratively, where you 
divide the work up into phases and then plan out each phase before 
you execute on it. Rolling wave planning is all about committing to 
planning out one portion of the work that you’ll do, executing it, and 
then moving on to the next portion.

Software projects using agile methodologies use a form of rolling 
wave planning to make sure that everything they sign on to do gets 
done. They might do user stories for a release of the software up 
front, build it, and deliver it, and then gather more requirements 
based on the users’ ideas after working with the released version.

Define activities outputs
The main output of this process is the activity list. It’s the basis for all of the 
estimation and scheduling tasks you will do next. But there are a few other outputs 
that go along with it, and help to make the estimates more detailed and accurate. 
Activity list
This is a list of everything that needs to be done to complete 
your project. This list is lower-level than the WBS. It’s all the 
activities that must be accomplished to deliver the 
work packages.
Activity attributes
Here’s where the description of each activity is kept. All of the 
information you need to figure out the order of the work should 
be here, too. So any predecessor activities, successor activities, 
or constraints should be listed in the attributes, along with 
descriptions and any other information about resources or time 
that you need for planning. 
Milestone list
All of the important checkpoints of your project are tracked 
as milestones. Some of them could be listed in your contract 
as requirements of successful completion; some could just be 
significant points in the project that you want to keep track 
of. The milestone list needs to let everybody know which are 
required and which are not.

The Sequence Activities process puts everything in order
Now that we know what we have to do to make the wedding a success, we need 
to focus on the order of the work. Kathleen sat down with all of the activities she 
had defined for the wedding and decided to figure out exactly how they needed to 
happen. That’s where she used the Sequence Activities process.
The activity attributes and the activity list she had created had most of the 
predecessors and successors written in them. Her milestone list had major 
pieces of work written down, and there were a couple of changes to the scope she 
had discovered along the way that were approved and ready to go. 
This includes information about 
each activity, including known 
predecessors and successors. 
Rob and Rebecca had asked that 
the invitations be printed at least 
three months in advance to be sure 
that everyone had time to RSVP. 
That’s a milestone on Kathleen’s list. 
Kathleen looked through past 
project files to find one that might 
help her sequence the activities for 
Rob and Rebecca’s wedding.

Diagram the relationship between activities
One way to visualize the way activities relate is to create a network diagram. Kathleen 
created this one to show how the activities involved in producing the invitations depend 
on one another. 
For example, the calligrapher is the person who’s hired to write the addresses on the 
invitations, so Rob and Rebecca need to pick a calligrapher before the invitations can 
be addressed. But the invitations also need to be printed before they can be addressed, 
because otherwise the calligrapher won’t have anything to write on! See how 
predecessors can get all complicated? Luckily, a diagram makes sense of them!
Showing the activities in rectangles and their relationships as arrows is called a 
precedence diagramming method (PDM).
Start
Picking a calligrapher and a 
printer have no predecessors.
This arrow shows a finish‑to‑start 
predecessor between the “pick 
calligrapher” and “address” activities.
This kind of diagram is also 
called activity on node (AON).
The successor to 
print is “address.”
Printing depends on 
designing the invitations.

Network diagrams put your tasks in perspective
Just looking at the way all of these tasks relate to one another can help 
you figure out what’s important at any time in the project. Once Rob 
and Rebecca looked at the network diagram below, they realized they 
needed to get online and start looking for a venue for their wedding 
right away, even before they’d figured out their budget and guest list.
Research 
venues online
Visit venues 
Give deposit 
Finish!
Rob and Rebecca needed to 
pick a date before they did 
anything else. That’s why 
there’s no predecessor here.
It’s never too early to do 
a little online research! No 
predecessor here either. 
Once they knew when the 
wedding was going to be, they 
had to figure out how many 
people were coming and how 
much they’d spend on the 
venue.
After they knew who they 
were inviting, it was time to 
pick a place that most people 
could get to easily.
Next, it’s time to call 
the venues to set up 
appointments.
Once they had 
appointments, they 
could go and check 
the places out. 
 Think of a few problems that having a diagram like this might solve.

Dependencies help you sequence your activities
The most common kind of predecessor is the Finish to Start. It means that one task 
needs to be completed before another one can start. There are a few other kinds of 
predecessors, though. They can all be used in network diagrams to show the order of 
activities. The three main kinds of dependency are Finish to Start (FS), Start to 
Start (SS), and Finish to Finish (FF).
Finish to Start (FS)
Start to Start (SS)
Finish to Finish (FF)
This is a little 
less common, but 
sometimes you need to 
coordinate activities 
so they begin at the 
same time.
These two finish 
at the same time. 
External dependencies
Sometimes your project will depend on things outside the work you are doing. For the wedding, we are depending on 
the wedding party before us to be out of the reception hall in time for us to decorate. The decoration of the reception 
hall then depends on that as an external dependency.
Discretionary dependencies
Rob and Rebecca really want the bridesmaids to arrive at the reception before the couple. There’s no necessity there—
it’s just a matter of preference. For the exam, know that you should set discretionary dependencies based on your 
knowledge of the best practices for getting the job done.
Mandatory dependencies
You can’t address an invitation that hasn’t been printed yet. So, printing invitations is a mandatory predecessor for 
addressing them. Mandatory predecessors are the kind that have to exist just because of the nature of the work.
Internal dependencies
The rehearsal dinner can’t begin until the happy couple leaves the church. Some dependencies are completely within 
the team’s control. 
Print invitations
Address
Give toasts
Serve cake
Play “Here Comes
the Bride”
Bride walks
down the aisle
dependency types
It’s called Finish 
to Start because 
the first activity’s 
finish leads 
into the second 
activity’s start.
When you think of 
dependencies, this is what 
you usually think of—one 
thing needs to end before 
the next can begin.
In the PMP exam, 
you might see 
this two-letter 
abbreviation.

time management
Leads and lags add time between activities
Sometimes you need to give some extra time between activities. Lag time is when you 
purposefully put a delay between the predecessor task and the successor. For example, 
when the bride and her father dance, the guests wait awhile before they join them.
Lead time is when you give a successor task some time to get started before the 
predecessor finishes. So you might want the caterer preparing dessert an hour before 
everybody is eating dinner. 
Book the
reception hall
Set up the
reception hall
Serve dinner
Prepare dessert
Lag
Lead
 Q: Where do you get the dependency 
information to figure out your network 
diagram?
A: Your activity attributes should list 
the predecessors and successors for each 
activity. As you build the network diagram, 
you might discover new dependencies as 
well. Your project team will determine the 
dependencies necessary for each of 
the activities.
Q: What about Start to Finish 
dependencies?
A: It’s possible for activities to require that 
a task has been started before it can finish. 
An example might be that singing couldn’t 
start until after the music had started. But 
tasks like that are pretty rare and almost 
never show up in network diagrams.
Q: My scheduling software makes 
network diagrams for me. Why do I need 
to know this?
A: Most scheduling software does create 
one of these diagrams automatically. But 
spending the time to think through your 
dependencies and examine them visually 
can really help you find places where you 
might need to give some tasks more priority 
if you want to get your project done on time. 
So you should know how to make them too.
A lag means making sure that 
one task waits awhile before it 
gets started. Kathleen books 
the hall months before it’s time 
to set it up for the wedding.
A lead is when you let a 
task get started before 
its predecessor is done.

You should still think of things in

For the test, it’s important to know the order of

all at once, you probably spend some time thinking 
about each of these things. 
But I do all this

Why do I need all these 
sequence diagrams?
 What’s the advantage of thinking about Define Activities and Sequence Activites separately?

Outputs
Create the network diagram
As you sequence the activities, you will find new activities that need to be 
added and new attributes for activities that you didn’t know about. So, while 
the main product of this process is the network diagram, you also produce 
updates to some of the Define Activities documents and outputs of other 
processes, too. 
If you find a new activity while 
sequencing, updates need to be 
made to the activity list. 
When you sequence your 
activities, you can find 
activities that carry a lot 
of risk to the project. Any 
risks you find in the process 
need to be added to your 
risk register. You’ll read more 
about that in Chapter 11. 
Sometimes sequencing will 
show that two tasks rely 
on each other. If you 
find new predecessors or 
successors, their attributes 
will need to be changed.

Rob and Rebecca have resource problems
Getting a handle on all of the tasks that have to be done is a great start. 
But it’s not enough to know the tasks and the order they come in. Before 
you can put a schedule together, you need to know who is going to do 
each job, and the things they need available to them in order to do it! 
Those are resources, and getting a handle on them is a very important 
part of Time Management.
Rebecca’s 
worried about 
human resources.
Rob realizes that not 
all resources are people!
Resources are 
people, equipment, 
locations, or 
anything else that 
you need in order 
to do all of the 
activities that you 
planned for. Every 
activity in your 
activity list needs 
to have resources 
assigned to it.
And it’s not

What you need to estimate resources
Good news: you’ve already seen most of the inputs to the Estimate Activity 
Resources process already! Before you can assign resources to your project, 
you need to know which ones you’re authorized to use on your project. That’s 
an input, and it’s called resource calendars. You’ll also need the activity list 
that you created earlier, and you’ll need to know about how your organization 
typically handles resources. Once you’ve got a handle on these things, you’re set 
for resource estimation.
Resource calendars are the only new input to the Estimate Activity 
Resources process. You’ve already seen the rest of the inputs.
How could policies, lessons learned, 
and historical information help you 
assign resources to your project?
Resource calendars
When you plan out a project, you need 
information about what resources you can use for 
various activities, and when they’re available to 
you. That’s what resource calendars are for. 
Don’t forget that some resources, like consultants 
or training rooms, have to be scheduled in 
advance, and they might only be available at 
certain times. You’ll need to know this before you 
can finish planning your project.
A June wedding is harder to plan 
than one in December, because the 
wedding halls are all booked up. 
That’s a resource constraint!

270    Chapter 6
Estimating the resources
The goal of Estimate Activity Resources is to assign resources to each activity in the 
activity list. There are five tools and techniques for the Estimate Activity Resources 
process. Some of them have technical‑sounding names, but they’re all actually pretty sensible 
when you think about it. They should all make sense to you when you think about what you 
have to do to figure out what resources your project needs.
Expert judgment means bringing in experts who 
have done this sort of work before and getting their 
opinions on what resources are needed.
Alternative analysis means considering 
several different options for how you assign 
resources. This includes varying the number of 
resources as well as the kind of resources you use.
Published estimating data is something that project 
managers in a lot of industries use to help them figure out 
how many resources they need. They rely on articles, books, 
journals, and periodicals that collect, analyze, and publish 
data from other people’s projects.
Project management software 
like Microsoft Project will often have features 
designed to help project managers play around 
with resources and constraints and find the best 
combination of assignments for the project.
Bottom-up estimating is a technique that you may have used before without even 
knowing it! It means breaking down complex activities into pieces, and working out the 
resource assignments for each of those simpler pieces using the other four tools and 
techniques.
Q:  In my company, I’m given my 
resources—I don’t get to assign them 
myself. How do these tools help me?
A:  When you work in a functional 
organization or some matrix organizations, 
you don’t have as much freedom in selecting 
resources as you do in a projectized 
organization. But that doesn’t mean these 
tools aren’t important! Whoever is doing the 
resource selection and assignment should 
be using them. And they’ll be on the PMP 
exam, so you need to understand them all.
Q: Is choosing a consultant, 
contractor, or vendor to do project work 
part of resource estimation?
A: When you’re working with a resource 
outside your company, like a contractor 
or consultant, you consider that resource 
the same way you consider any other 
resource. But actually negotiating the 
contract and selecting the vendor is not part 
of the Estimate Activity Resources process. 
There’s a whole other knowledge area for 
that—Procurement Management.
Q: What if I need a resource that isn’t 
available when my project needs it?
A: This is one of the reasons that project 
management is a tough job! When you need 
a resource that isn’t available, you need to 
negotiate for it. Think about it…your project 
depends on getting this resource, and 
without it your project won’t get done. You 
need it, or you’ll face delays! You have to 
do whatever you can to get that resource for 
your project.

Figuring out how long the project will take
Once you’re done with Estimate Activity Resources, you’ve got everything 
you need to figure out how long each activity will take. That’s done in a 
process called Estimate Activity Durations. This is where you look at 
each activity in the activity list, consider the scope and the resources, and 
estimate how long it will take to perform.
Most of the outputs of Estimate Activity 
Resources are immediately used as inputs for 
Estimate Activity Durations.
The resource 
breakdown 
structure, 
activity resource 
requirements, and 
project document 
updates are all 
the outputs of 
Estimate Activity 
Resources. All of 
them are combined 
with other inputs 
to lead into the 
Estimate Activity 
Durations process.
You shouldn’t be 
surprised to see these 
inputs by now. They

You need these because the

estimate the duration of 
each activity.
The more resources you 
add to an activity, the 
less time it takes.
But sometimes adding people won’t get 
the job done any faster! Remember, nine 
women can’t have a baby in one month.
You need to know when the resources are 
available, because that’s going to impact 
the final estimate for the activity.
Any time you see this, think 
about historical information 
and project records! 
The more you know about how 
past projects went, the more 
accurate your estimates will be.
This input is always about looking elsewhere 
in your organization for information.
You’re probably not the first person 
in your company to do this sort of 
project. Information from people 
around you will be very valuable when 
you’re creating estimates.

Each of these scenarios describes a different tool or technique from Estimate Activity Durations.
Write down which tool or technique is being described.
Estimation tools and techniques
Estimating the duration of an activity means starting with the information you have 
about that activity and the resources that are assigned to it, and then working with the 
project team to come up with an estimate. Most of the time you’ll start with a rough 
estimate and then refine it (maybe a few times!) to make it more accurate. You’ll use 
these five tools and techniques to create the most accurate estimates.
Expert judgment will come from your project 
team members who are familiar with the work that 
has to be done. If you don’t get their opinion, then 
there’s a huge risk that your estimates will be wrong!
Analogous estimating is when you look at 
activities from previous projects that were similar to 
this one and look at how long it took to do similar 
work before. But this only works if the activities and 
the project team are similar!
Parametric estimating means plugging 
data about your project into a formula, spreadsheet, 
database, or computer program that comes up with 
an estimate. The software or formula that you use for 
parametric estimating is built on a database of actual 
durations from past projects.
Three-point estimates are when you come 
up with three numbers: a most likely estimate 
that probably will happen, an optimistic one that 
represents the best-case scenario, and a pessimistic 
one that represents the worst-case scenario. The final 
estimate is the average.
Reserve analysis means adding extra time to the 
schedule (called a contingency reserve or a buffer) to account 
for extra risk.
1. Kathleen comes up with three estimates (one where everything goes wrong, one where 
some things go wrong, and one where nothing goes wrong) for printing invitations, and 
averages them together to come up with a final number.
2. There will be two different catering companies at the wedding. Kathleen asks the head chef at each of them 
to give her an estimate of how long it will take to do the job.
3. There’s a spreadsheet Kathleen always uses to figure out how long it takes guests to RSVP. She enters the

Three-Point Estimates Up Close
PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) is the most common form 
of three-point estimation. It’s a technique that was developed in the 1960s by consulting 
firms working with the U.S. government as a way of getting more accurate project duration 
predictions up front. To do a PERT estimate, you start with three estimates—pessimistic, most likely, 
and optimistic estimates. Since the pessimistic and optimistic estimates are less likely to happen than 
the normal estimate, the normal estimate is weighted (multiplied by 4) and added to the optimistic 
and pessimistic estimates, and then the whole thing is divided by 6 to give an expected duration. The 
formula looks like this:
Kathleen used a PERT estimate for the all of the wedding planning activities to make sure that she 
could get it all done in time for Rob and Rebecca’s big day. They only have six months until the 
wedding, so all of the planning needs to be done within the month to leave enough time to actually 
get everything done. She wrote down the assumptions she made for each estimate, coming up 
with all of the reasons she could think of that she took into account when coming up with her 
estimates.
(9 + 4(15) + 30) ÷ 6=16.5 
Optimistic = 9 days
Most likely = 15 days
Pessimistic = 30 days
All guests RSVP early.
Half of the guests won’t 
RSVP until the very last 
week; a few won’t RSVP at 
all but will still show up.
Nobody RSVPs and many 
bring guests unannounced.
The couple settles on the 
first venue they visit.
They’ll visit four or five and 
spend weeks negotiating with 
venue operators.
They’ll comb the 
neighborhood and visit every 
possible place for weeks.
The printer can get the 
invitations done in two weeks.
They’ll want to talk to a few 
printers and most of them 
will ask for at least a month.
All the printers will be 
booked, so we’ll have to use 
somebody from out of town 
and it’ll take six work weeks 
(30 business days).

Here are some examples of three-point estimates. Use the formula to figure out the expected time 
for each of these. 
Answers on page 318.
1. A software team gathered estimates for all of the work they’d have to do to build the next major release of their 
flagship product. Last time it took them around 45 days, but they’re hoping that the lessons learned from the past 
release could bring the time down to 30 days. However, the infrastructure team needs to upgrade their servers, and 
they are concerned that procurement delays could potentially extend the project out to 90 days. 
Expected duration = __________ 	
Optimistic duration = __________ 	
Most Likely duration = __________ 
Pessimistic duration = __________
2. A construction team gathered estimates for all of the work they’d have to do to build a garage. In general, they can 
build a garage in 20 days, but rain or cooler temperatures could stretch the project out to 30 days. If, however, the 
forecast is correct, warm, sunny weather might bring the duration down to just 12 days. 
Expected duration = __________ 	
Optimistic duration = __________ 	
Most Likely duration = __________ 
Pessimistic duration = __________
3. A project manager used data from past projects to come up with an estimate for an upcoming software system 
replacement project. She felt confident about a 25-day duration, but also noted that adding an extra resource could 
bring the schedule down to 10 days. The test team felt that the complexity of some completely new features would add 
additional test cases, adding a few weeks for a 40-day estimate. 
Expected duration = __________ 	
Optimistic duration = __________ 	
Most Likely duration = __________ 
Pessimistic duration = __________
4. A project manager in charge of a big civil engineering project came up with an estimate for a highway re-paving 
project. The worst-case scenario was 82 days, but the team felt more certain based on past experience that they could 
get it done in 49 days. If all went well with their equipment and materials, it might be done in 33 days instead.

Create the duration estimate
You’ve got a list of activities, you know what resources are needed to actually 
do each activity, and you’ve got your estimation tools and techniques…now 
you have enough to create the estimates! That’s the whole point of the 
Estimate Activity Durations process, and it’s also the main output.
The activity duration estimates are estimates of how 
long each activity in the activity list will take. The estimate 
can be in hours, days, weeks…any work period is fine, and 
you’ll use different work periods for different jobs. A small 
job (like booking a DJ) may just take a few hours; a bigger 
job (like catering—including deciding on a menu, ordering 
ingredients, cooking food, and serving guests on the big 
day) could take days.
You’ll also learn more about the specific activities while 
you’re estimating them. That’s something that always 
happens—you have to really think through all of the 
aspects of a task in order to estimate it. So the other 
output of Estimate Activity Durations is updates to the 
project documents. 
You may have guessed from the name that the activity 
duration estimates are always duration estimates, not 
effort estimates, so they show you calendar time and 
not just person-hours.
You don’t always know exactly how long an 
activity will take, so you might end up using 
a range (like 3 weeks +/- 2 days).
The activity 
duration estimate 
consists of 
estimates for each 
activity. It’s the 
main output of the 
Estimate Activity 
Durations process.

Q:  When you use parametric 
estimation, how does the program or 
formula know how much to estimate?
A:  When people design a system for 
parametric estimation, they collect a lot of 
data from past projects and condense it into 
a table or a database. And then they come 
up with a heuristic (like a rule of thumb) that 
lets you boil your estimation down into just a 
few parameters that you need to enter. Most 
successful parametric estimation systems 
need a lot of time to develop.
Q: Since reserve analysis lets me use 
buffers, why can’t I just put everything I 
don’t know about into the reserve?
A: The idea behind reserve analysis is that 
there are always unknowns on any project, but 
you can account for these unknowns by taking 
your best guess at what’s going to go wrong 
and inserting a buffer. But you can’t just make 
an enormous reserve, because then there’s no 
reason to ever do any estimation! The entire 
project becomes one big unknown, and that’s 
not particularly useful to anyone.
Q: Wait a minute! I don’t quite get the 
difference between a duration estimate 
and an effort estimate. Can you explain?
A: Duration is the amount of time that 
an activity takes, while effort is the total 
number of person-hours expended. If it 
takes two people six hours to carve the ice 
sculpture for the centerpiece of a wedding, 
the duration is six hours. But since 2 people 
worked on it for the whole time, it took 12 
person-hours of effort to create!

Back to the wedding
Kathleen’s really got a handle on how long things are going to take, 
but that’s not enough to get the job done. She’s still got some work to 
do before she’s got the whole project under control.
Rob and Rebecca know 
where they want to get 
married, and they’ve got 
the place booked now.
But what about the 
caterer? They have no 
idea who’s going to be 
providing the food.
And what about the band 
that they want? Will the 
timing with their schedule 
work out?
If the caterers come 
too early, the food 
will sit around under heat 
lamps! But too late, and the 
band won’t have time to play. 
I just don’t see how we’ll 
ever work this all out.
It’s not easy to plan for a lot of resources when they have tight 
time restrictions and overlapping constraints. How would you 
figure out a schedule that makes everything fit together?

280    Chapter 6
Bringing it all together
The Develop Schedule process is the core of Time Management. It’s 
the process where you put it all together—where you take everything you’ve 
done so far and combine it into one final schedule for the whole project. A lot 
of project managers consider this the most important part of their job. The 
schedule is your most important tool for managing a project.
There are some assets that you’ll 
need for your schedule, like a 
calendar of shifts or holidays.
Develop Schedule brings 
everything you’ve done so far 
together into one final schedule. 
All of the outputs from the 
other Time Management 
processes are inputs to Develop 
Schedule.
Look in here for 
important constraints. 
They’ll include drop‑dead 
dates you absolutely 
have to meet, and other 
important milestones.
This is where it all comes 
together. These are the 
outputs you made in the 
other processes, and now 
you’ll use them to build 
your schedule.

Don’t worry, even though you’re done with 
the Estimate Activity Resources process, 
you’re not done with the resources.
You’re never going to have the complete resource picture 
until you’re done building the schedule. And the same goes 
for your activity list and duration estimates, too! It’s only 
when you lay out the schedule that you’ll figure out that 
some of your activities and durations didn’t quite work.
That’s why the processes have the 
word “Estimating” in their names! 
Because you’re taking an educated 
guess, but you won’t know for sure 
until you’ve actually developed the 
schedule.
Each of the 
processes 
allows 
updates to an 
output from 
a previous 
one, so when 
you discover 
changes, you 
can include 
them in the 
schedule.
You’re not done with activity 
attributes yet. When you 
estimate resources, you’ll learn 
more about some activities and 
update their attributes.
You created 
this in Define 
Activities, but 
you learned more 
about it in Sequence 
Activities. Since the 
activity list is updated, 
it’s also an output to 
the process!
You won’t know everything 
about the resources until 
you actually develop the

to keep updating the 
resource requirements.

27. You’re the project manager for a highway construction

the project sponsor in order to find out any important 
milestones that you need to meet. What’s the next thing 
that you do?
A.	 Create the project schedule.
B.	 Perform the Define Activities process.
C.	 Consult your Project Management plan to figure out 
how to handle any schedule changes.
D.	 Figure out the dependencies between activities and 
create a diagram of the activity network.
Hold on—this question doesn’t look like 
it’s asking about the order of the 
processes! But a lot of which-comes-
next questions describe a situation and 
ask you what you’d do.
Don’t be thrown if the question asks 
about an industry you don’t know 
much about. All projects follow the 
same processes.
In other words, you’ve 
used decomposition and 
created an activity 
list. These are part of 
the Define Activities 
process.
The milestone list 
is an input that 
you’ve seen before.
The Develop Schedule 
process needs more 
than an activity 
list and resource 
availability.
The question 
described the 
Define Activities 
process, so you’ve 
already performed 
it. 
You only do this 
during Control 
Schedule, but since 
there’s no schedule 
yet, there’s nothing 
to control.
This answer describes 
Sequence Activities, which 
happens after Define 
Activities and takes the 
activity list and milestone 
list as inputs. That’s the 
right answer.
Question Clinic: The “which-comes-next” question
If you want to pass the PMP exam, you’ll 
need to have a good feel for the order that 
the processes are performed in, because you’ll be asked a 
lot of “Which-comes-next” questions! These are questions 
that quiz you on how the processes fit together into one big 
framework. These questions aren’t hard, but they can be a 
little misleading.
The Which-comes-next 
question doesn’t always look 
like it’s asking about the order of the 
processes! Keep an eye out for questions 
that describe inputs, outputs, tools, 
or techniques and ask you what you’re 
supposed to do next.
Did you notice the question said “diagram of the activity network” and 
not “project network diagram”? The exam might not use the exact 
same phrasing as the PMBOK Guide. That’s why you’re learning how 
these things are used, not just memorizing their names.

Use the critical path method to avoid big problems
The critical path method is an important tool for keeping your projects 
on track. Every network diagram has something called the critical path. 
It’s the string of activities that, if you add up all of the durations, is longer 
than any other path through the network. It usually starts with the first 
activity in the network and usually ends with the last one.
The reason that the critical path is, well, critical, is that every single activity 
on the path must finish on time in order for the project to come in on 
time. A delay in any one of the critical path activities will cause the 
entire project to be delayed.
The critical path 
is the string of 
activities that will 
delay the whole 
project if any one 
of them is delayed.

How does knowing your critical path help?
Knowing where your critical path is can give you a lot of 
freedom. If you know an activity is not on the critical path, 
then you know a delay in that activity may not necessarily 
delay the project.
This can really help you handle emergency situations. Even 
better, it means that if you need to bring your project in 
earlier, you know that adding resources to the critical path 
will be much more effective than adding them elsewhere.

Finding the float for any activity
Once you’ve figured out the critical path, there’s all sorts of useful stuff you can 
do with it. One of the most useful things you can do is calculate the float. The 
float for any activity is the amount of time that it can slip before it causes your 
project to be delayed. You might also see the word slack—it’s the same thing.
Luckily, it’s not hard to figure out the float for any activity in a network diagram. 
First you write down the list of all of the paths in the diagram, and you identify 
the critical path. The float for every activity in the critical path is zero.

That’s how you figure 
out how long any of its 
activities can slip before 
it delays the project.
The duration for this path is 8, 
and for the critical path it’s 11. 
So the float is 11 - 8 = 3.
The duration for this path is 7, 
and for the critical path it’s 11. 
So the float is 11 - 7 = 4.
Since this duration was 
already filled in, you don’t 
want to replace it…because 
that’s how long this 
activity can slip!
You can use this 
method to find the 
float for every activity 
in a network diagram.

Float tells you how much extra time you have
Once you know the float, you know how much play you have in your 
schedule. If an activity has a float of 2 days, it can slip by that much 
without affecting the end date. 
To find the float for an 
activity, figure out how 
much it can slip before it 
makes the project late. The float for any 
activity on the critical path is ZERO!

Activity G has a float of 4 because 
that’s how long path D → E → G 
can be delayed before it becomes 
the new critical path.
So D and E both 
have a float of 3.
The duration for the 
last path D → E → 
G is 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.
Activities D or E can slip by 3 without 
making the project late. Any more 
than that, and path D → E → F will 
take longer than the critical path!
A → B → C is the 
critical path, with total 
duration 4 + 3 + 7 = 14.
The float for activities A, B, 
and C is zero because any delay 
in them will cause the project 
to be late!
Activity F has a float 
of 3 because that’s how 
much it can slip without 
causing path D → E → F 
to delay the project.

All of the processes in Time 
Management tie together! When 
you develop your schedule, you’re 
using the durations for your 
activities that you came up with 
in Estimate Activity Durations.
I see-so when I created 
the network diagram in Sequence 
Activities, I was building on what I 
did in Define Activities. It all ties 
together!
Q: Where do the duration numbers come from on 
each activity?
A: A lot of people ask that question. It’s easy to forget that 
everything you do in Sequence Activities builds on the stuff you 
did in the other Time Management processes. Remember the 
estimates that you came up with Estimate Activity Durations? 
You used techniques like three-point estimates, analogous 
estimating, and parametric estimating to come up with an 
estimate for each activity. Those are the estimates that you use 
on your network diagrams!
Q: What if there’s a path that’s not critical, but where 
even a small slip in one activity would delay the project?
A: This is exactly why it’s important to know the float for 
each of your activities. When you’re managing your project, it’s 
not enough to just pay attention to the activities on the critical 
path. You need to look for any activity with a low float. And don’t 
forget that there may be some activities that aren’t on the critical 
path but still have a float of zero! These are the ones where you 
really want to pay attention and watch out for potential resource 
problems.

When you have a long critical path, but the other paths in your network diagram are 
short, then you have a lot of freedom in when you can start and finish each of the 
activities that are not on the critical path. You can use early start and early finish 
to get a handle on exactly how much freedom you have in your schedule.
When you find the early 
start and early finish for 
each task, you know exactly 
how much freedom you have 
to move the start dates 
for those activities around 
without causing problems.
Early start
Is the earliest time that an activity can start. An activity 
near the end of the path will only start early if all of the 
previous activities in the path also started early. If one of 
the previous activities in the path slips, that will push it out.
Early finish
Is the earliest time that an activity can finish. It’s the date 
that an activity will finish if all of the previous activities 
started early and none of them slipped.
The critical path has a duration 
of 6 + 5 + 7 = 18.
The other path has a duration 
of 2 + 7 = 9. It’s a lot 
shorter than the critical path, 
so there should be a lot of 
play in those activities.
Even if Activity D starts 
really late, since the path it’s 
on is so much shorter than 
the critical path, the project 
will still be on time.
That means the early start 
and early finish for D are 
really early—they can end a lot 
sooner than A, B, and C, which 
will free up their resources for 
you to use.

starting late
Figure out the latest possible start and finish
It’s also important to know how late any activity can run before it delays 
the project. That’s what late start and late finish are for! They let you 
figure out how late you can start a certain task and how much it can slip 
before it delays your project.
This is the same network 
diagram from the last page.
This path is much shorter than 
the critical path, so you should 
be able to start Activity D 
very late and still complete 
the project on time!
The path Activity D is on 
has a much shorter duration 
than the critical path. So 
even if it has a long delay, 
it still won’t harm the 
project.

Figuring out the late start 
and late finish will help you 
see how much “play” you 
have in your schedule. An 
activity with a large late 
start or late finish means 
you have more options.
Late start
Is the latest time that an activity can start. If an activity is on 
a path that’s much shorter than the critical path, then it can 
start very late without delaying the project—but those delays 
will add up quickly if other activities on its path also slip!
Late finish
Is the latest time that an activity can finish. If an activity is on 
a short path and all of the other activities on that path start 
and finish early, then it can finish very late without causing 
the project to be late.

Add early and late durations to your diagrams
You can use a method called forward pass to add the early start and 
finish to each path in your network diagram. Once you’ve done that, you 
can use backward pass to add the late start and finish. It makes your 
network diagrams look a little more complicated, but it gives you a lot of 
valuable information.

You can use this special 
node in your network 
diagram to write down 
the early and late 
start and finish.
The early start for 
this activity is 4.
Early start and finish go in 
the upper corners. Write the 
name of the activity above it, 
and the duration and float 
inside the box.
The early finish for this 
activity is 8. There’s no 
way it can end before 
day 8.
Write the late start in the lower-
lefthand corner. As long as the 
invitation design starts by day 7, it 
won’t delay the critical path.
The late finish for the 
Design Invitations activity is 
11, which means the latest it 
can finish without delaying 
the schedule is on day #11. 
If it hasn’t finished by then, 
Kathleen should worry!

Take a forward pass through the network diagram. 
Start at the beginning of the critical path and move forward through each 
activity. Follow these three steps to figure out the early start and early finish!
 The ES (early start) of the first activity in the path is 1. The EF (early finish) 
of any task is its ES plus its duration minus one. So start with Activity A. It’s 
the first in the path, so ES = 1, and EF = 1 + 6 – 1 = 6. 
1
 Now move forward to the next activity in the path, which is Activity B in 
this diagram. To figure out ES, take the EF of the previous task and add one. 
So for Activity B, you can calculate ES = 6 + 1 = 7, and EF = 7 + 5 – 1 = 11.
2
Uh-oh! Activity C has two predecessors. Which one do you use to 
calculate EF? Since C can’t start until both B and D are done, use the one 
with the latest EF. That means you need to figure out the EF of Activity D 
(its ES is 1, so its EF is 1 + 2 – 1 = 2). Now you can move forward to Activity 
C and calculate its EF. The EF of Activity D is 2, which is smaller than B’s EF 
of 11, so for Activity C the ES = 11 + 1 = 12, and EF = 12 + 7 – 1 = 18.

backward pass
Take a backward pass to find late start and finish
They’re the same if 
there’s only one path. 
But with more paths, 
things get interesting!
First do the forward pass for 
both paths. When you do that, you 
get a different LF for Activity B, 
which makes all the numbers change!
We use Activity D to calculate 
the LF for Activity C because 
it has the lower LS.
You can use a backward pass through the same network diagram to figure out the late 
finish and start for each activity.
The backward pass is just as easy as the forward pass. Start at the end of the path you just 
took a pass through and work your way backward to figure out the late start and finish.

 Start at the end of the path, with Activity C. The LF (late finish) of the last 
activity is the same as the EF. Calculate its LS (late start) by subtracting its 
duration from the LF and adding one. LS = 18 – 7 + 1 = 12.
1
 Now move backward to the previous activity in the path—in this case, 
Activity B. Its LF is the LS of Activity C minus one, so LF = 12 – 1 = 11. 
Calculate its LS in the same way as step 1: LS = 11 – 5 + 1 = 7.
2
 Now do the same for Activity A. LF is the LS for Activity B minus one, so 
LF = 7 – 1 = 6. And LS is LF minus duration plus one, so LF = 6 – 6 + 1 = 1.

Start with the critical path. 
You’re calculating the latest any activity 
can start and finish, so it makes sense 
that you need to start at the end of the 
project and work backward—and the 
last activity on the critical path is always 
the last one in the project. Then do 
these three steps, working backward to 
the next-longest path, then the next-
longest, and so on, until you’ve filled 
in the LS and LF for all of the activities. 
Fill in the LF and LS for the activities on 
each path, but don’t replace any LF or 
LS you’ve already calculated.

 There are four paths in this network diagram. Fill in each of the 
activity names and durations for each of the paths.
Let’s take some time out to walk through this!
All of this critical path stuff seems pretty serious, right? It’s one of the 
toughest concepts on the exam. But don’t sweat it, because it’s actually 
not hard! It just takes a little practice. Once you do it yourself, you’ll

Calculating the ES, EF, LS, and LF 
may seem complicated, but it only takes 
a little practice to get the hang of it. 
Once you walk through it step by step, 
you’ll see that it’s actually pretty easy!

298    Chapter 6
critical path practice
Take a forward pass through each of the four paths in the diagram and fill 
in the early starts and early finishes for each activity. Start with the first 
one.
Let’s move on to the second path.
Now take another look at it, and how 
it mixes with the last path. It includes 
Activity H, which was also in the last path. 
H will have a different 
ES depending on 
which path you use! 
So which predecessor 
do you use: E or 
G? The idea here is 
that you use the 
predecessor with the 
larger EF value when 
you calculate the ES 
for activity H (because 
you want the latest 
possible start date).
Remember, the early 
start of the first 
activity in a path is one.
The early finish of an 
activity is its ES plus 
its duration minus one.
The early start of an activity is the early 
finish of the previous activity plus one.
Once you have the EF for both 
activities E and G, you can use the 
bigger one to come up with the ES for 
Activity H.
The next path isn’t as straightforward as it looks. Start by filling in its values.

You’ve calculated the ES for each activity. Use that information and take a backward pass 
through the paths, starting with the first two paths.
Start by filling in the LF of the 
last activity in each path, which 
is the same as the EF of the last 
activity in the critical path.
Move backward through the 
path, filling in the LS by 
subtracting the duration from 
the LF and adding one. We’ve 
filled in the first two for you.
For activity B, you have a choice: you 
can calculate the LF using the LS from 
either Activity C or F. Use the lower value, 
subtract one, and fill it in.
The LF for each 
activity is the LS of 
the next one on the 
path minus one.
Finish up by calculating the LS and LF for the last two paths!
Activity D is another one where 
you have to choose which LS to 
use in order to calculate the LF. 
You can either use the LS from 
Activity E or Activity G. Use 
whichever is lowest, subtract one, 
and fill it in.

First start with the critical path. Take the EF of the last activity in the critical path and use it as the LF for 
the last activity in every path. If you take a minute to think about it, it makes sense to do that. The point of 
LF is to figure out the absolute latest that the activity can end without making the project late. And as long 
as every non-critical-path activity ends before the last activity in the critical path, then it won’t be late.
We’ll start by giving you the LF of critical path, Start-D-E-H-Finish, which is 17.
Activities B and D have two possible 
choices for which LS to use for the 
calculation. For Activity B, do you 
use the LS of C or the LS of F? And 
for Activity D, do you use Activity 
E or G? The answer is that you 
always use the lowest value of LS 
to calculate the LF. The reason is 
that you’re trying to find the latest 
possible start date that won’t make 
the project late. If you use an activity 
with a later LS, and the activity 
really is delayed by that much, then 
it’ll cause a delay in both following 
activities. And that will make the 
one with the lower LS start too late.

If you got a few of these wrong, don’t 
worry. It’s easy to miss one calculation, and 
that leads to a problem on the whole path.
You won’t have to do this kind of thing on 
the job…that’s what computers are for!
Project management software like Microsoft Project will 
do these calculations for you. But you need to know how 
to do it yourself, because when the computer is doing 
critical path analysis, this is exactly how it figures it out! 
Wait a minute...I’ve never had to 
do this for my projects at work! 
I’ve got projects with dozens of 
activities, and this would take all 
day!

time management
Q: Would I really use this critical path 
stuff in real life, or is it just something I 
need to memorize for the PMP exam?
A: Yes, critical path analysis really is 
important in real life! Sure, for a small project 
with a dozen or so activities, it’s pretty easy 
to figure out which activities are critical 
and which can slip by a little bit. But what 
happens if you’ve got a project with dozens 
of team members and hundreds of activities?
That’s where critical path analysis can come 
in very handy. For a project like that, you’d 
probably be using project management 
software rather than calculating the critical 
path yourself, and the software will be able 
to highlight that path for you. Pay special 
attention to all of the activities that are on the 
critical path—those are the ones that could 
potentially delay the project.
Q:What about the other numbers? 
How do I use float?
A: Float is a very powerful planning tool 
that you can use to figure out how well your 

project is going, and to predict where your 
trouble spots might be. Any activity with a 
low or zero float absolutely must come in on 
time, while the people performing an activity 
with a larger float have more freedom to slip 
without delaying the project. So you might 
want to assign your “superstar” resources to 
the low-float activities, and those people who 
need a little more mentoring to the ones with 
higher float.
Q: OK, but what about late start, early 
finish, and those other numbers? Do 
those do me any good?
A: Early and late start and finish numbers 
are also very useful. How many times have 
you been in a situation where you’ve been 
asked, “If we absolutely had to have this in 
two months, can we do it?” Or, “How late can 
this project realistically be?” Now you can 
use these numbers to give you real answers, 
with actual evidence to back them up.

Here’s an example. Let’s say you’ve got an 
activity in the middle of your project, and 

one of your team members wants to plan a 
vacation right at the time that the activity will 
start. Do you need to find someone to fill in 
for him? If he’ll be back before the late start 
date, then your project won’t be late! But that 
comes at a cost—you’ll have used up the 
extra slack in the schedule.
Q: I can see how the critical path is 
useful on its own, but what does it have 
to do with the rest of Time Management?
A: If you start putting together your 
schedule but the activities are in the wrong 
order, that’s really going to cause serious 
problems…and sometimes doing critical 
path analysis is the only way you’ll really 
figure out that you’ve made that particular 
mistake. That’s why you need to pay a lot 
of attention to the Sequence Activities tools 
and techniques. If you’ve come up with an 
inefficient or inaccurate sequence, with 
too many or incorrect predecessors and 
dependencies, then your entire critical path 
analysis will be useless.

The critical path is the path that has the longest 
duration.

You should be able to figure out the number of paths in 
a project network diagram, and the duration of each 
path.

The float for an activity is the amount that its duration 
can slip without causing the project to be delayed. The 
float for any activity on the critical path is zero.

You’ll need to know how to calculate the early start, late 
start, early finish, and late finish for an activity in a 
network diagram using the forward pass and backward 
pass. This is the core of critical path analysis.

You may see a PDM (or activity-on-node) diagram with 
special nodes that have extra boxes in the corners for 
the ES, EF, LF, and LS.

Don’t forget that when two paths intersect, you have to 
decide which ES or LF value to take for the calculation 
in the next node. For the forward pass, use the larger 
value; for the backward pass, use the smaller one. 

302    Chapter 6
Crash the schedule
There are two important schedule 
compression techniques that you can use to 
bring in your project’s milestone dates…but each 
has its own cost. When you absolutely have to 
meet the date and you are running behind, you 
can sometimes find ways to do activities more 
quickly by adding more resources to critical path 
tasks. That’s called crashing. 
Hmm. That’ll cost more…
No problem! 
We’ll just add more 
cooks and waiters to 
serve more people. 
A lot more 
people RSVP’d than 
we expected!
Crashing the schedule 
means adding resources 
or moving them around 
to shorten it. Crashing 
ALWAYS costs more and 
doesn’t always work!
Then you can’t crash the schedule.
There’s no way to crash a schedule without 
raising the overall cost of the project. So, if the 
budget is fixed and you don’t have any extra 
money to spend, you can’t use this technique. 
Yeah, but what if 
you’re at the budget 
limit and can’t afford 
extra resources?
crashing costs more

Fast-tracking the project
Another schedule compression technique is called fast-tracking. 
Sometimes you’ve got two activities planned to occur in sequence, but 
you can actually do them at the same time. On a software project, 
you might do both your UAT testing and your functional testing at 
the same time, for example. This is pretty risky, though. There’s a 
good chance you will need to redo some of the work you have done 
concurrently. 
If the decorations 
don’t match the flowers 
well enough, we’ll have to 
do some rework.

Modeling techniques
It’s always a good idea to think about all of the things that could go wrong on your project in 
advance. Trying to think through all of the possible problens your project could run into is 
called what-if analysis.

What if the limo breaks down? 

What if the florist cancels at the last minute?

What if the dress doesn’t fit?

What if the band gets sick?

What if the guests get food poisoning?

What if there’s a typo in the church address on the invitation?

What if the bridesmaids don’t show up?

What if the cake tastes horrible?

What if we lose the rings?
That way, you can figure out how to deal with any problems that might come your way. 
Sometimes there’s no way to still meet your dates and deal with these scenarios. But it always 
makes sense to try to understand the impact they will have on your schedule.
Simulation
This is a specific kind of what-if analysis where you model 
uncertainty using a computer. There are some packages that 
will help to calculate risk using random numbers and Monte 
Carlo analysis algorithms. While this is not a commonly 
used technique, there might be a question or two about it on 
the PMP exam, and you should know what it is.
Scheduling tool
Using a project management software package to create a model 
of the schedule and adjusting various elements to see what might 
happen is another technique for analyzing network diagrams.

Other Develop Schedule tools and techniques
There are just a few more tools and techniques in the 
Develop Schedule process that you should know. 
Critical chain method
In this method, resource dependencies are used to determine 
the critical path. Then, you add buffers, working backward 
from the delivery date into the schedule at strategic points, and 
managing the project so that each milestone is hit on time. 
Resource optimization techniques
Sometimes only one resource can do a given activity. If that 
resource is busy doing another activity on the critical path, the 
path itself needs to change to include that dependency. That’s 
the point of resource leveling. It evaluates all of the resources to 
see if the critical path needs to change to accommodate resource 
assignments.
Adjusting leads and lags
If you made any mistakes in your leads and your 
lags, you might be able to adjust them to change 
the projected end date.
And don’t forget…
Schedule compression and schedule network analysis
The last two tools and techniques in the Develop Schedule process are the 
ones you just learned over the last few pages: schedule compression 
and schedule network analysis using critical path, float, and the other 
schedule analysis techniques you just learned.

306    Chapter 6
Outputs of Develop Schedule
Of course, the main product of Develop Schedule is the schedule. But 
there are a few other supporting documents that help you understand how 
the work will get done as well.
Schedule
Milestone list
Project schedule
All of that analysis and modeling should produce 
a schedule that everyone can get behind. After 
thinking your way through everything that can go 
wrong and assigning resources, you should have a 
pretty accurate prediction of the work required to 
complete the project.
Milestone chart
Technically, the milestone chart is a part of the 
project schedule (so they’re really all part of 
the same output), but it’s very important. All of 
the major chunks of work can be marked with 
milestones to track their completion. Usually this list 
is published for other teams or stakeholders who are 
depending on parts of the work to be accomplished 
by a certain time. 
The reason you go through all of 
that what-if analysis is to make 
sure everybody agrees that this 
schedule is achievable!
The main thing to remember here 
is that milestones are usually used 
to track stuff that will be used by 
people outside the project. 
Outputs
Develop Schedule outputs
Schedule 
data
Schedule data
The schedule data is a collection of information 
about your schedule. It will include things that 
you’ll need to analyze your schedule later on in the 
project: alternative schedules, specific requirements 
for resources, milestone charts, bar charts, project 
schedule network diagrams, and other data and 
metrics about your schedule.

time management
Schedule baseline
When the Develop Schedule process is complete, a 
baseline is created so that actual progress can be 
compared to the plan.
Project calendars
Calendars will help you keep track of the time 
when team members will be away on vacation 
or unavailable to work on your project. 
This is just like the scope 
baseline in the last chapter.
Before you can do change control, you need requested changes. 
Once the change is approved, you can update the baseline!
Project Management plan 
updates
Since the schedule baseline and Schedule

Project Management plan, it makes sense that 
it would have to be updated. 
Project documents updates
While you’re creating the schedule, you might find that you need to update 
calendars, your resource requirements, the attributes of the activities themselves, or 
even your risk register, to name a few possibilities. 

308    Chapter 6
 For the exam, you need to know Develop Schedule outputs. Several outputs from 
the wedding’s Develop Schedule process are on the left. Match them to the correct 
description on the right.
1. Kathleen gives a list of dates to the caterer telling 
him when he will need to have his menu plans, and 
when the shopping for the ingredients will need to be 
complete for the reception and rehearsal dinner.
A. Project schedule
2. Kathleen realizes that she needs to make a change 
to how she keeps track of the waiters’ time, so she 
makes a change to the document that describes it.
3. While making the schedule, Kathleen realizes that 
the catering company can’t work from 3-4 on the day 
of the event because they’ll be travelling from another 
event. 
4. Kathleen makes a copy of the schedule when it’s 
done so that she can compare how she is doing to the 
original plan.
B. Schedule data
C. Schedule baseline
D. Project calendar update
E. Project document updates
scenario and output matching
5. There’s a big poster on the wall where Kathleen 
keeps track of who does what, and when.
Answers: A– 5; B –1; C– 4; D–3; E–2

 Q: Don’t we need to go through change control 
before we update the resource requirements or the 
activity attributes?
A: No. You need to go through change control if you 
are requesting changes to, say, your Cost Management 
plan. But while you are working on creating your 
schedule, everything you have created as part of the 
Time Management knowledge area is fair game.

As you work your way through your network diagram 
and figure out new dependencies, you will find that you 
need more resources for some items or that the activity 
itself has changed. That’s why this process gives you 
the freedom to refine your earlier idea and make all of 
the Time Management documents sync with your new 
understanding.

The Develop Schedule process is about taking all of the 
information you can think of up front and putting it into 
a schedule that is realistic. When you are done with this 
process, you should have a really good idea of what you 
are going to do, who will do it, and how long it will take.
Q: We always want to do our projects as quickly 
as we can. Why don’t we always fast-track and crash 
our schedules?
A: Because crashing is expensive and fast-tracking 
is risky. While it may look good on paper to add a lot of 
resources to a project that is running late, it often adds 
so much management overhead and training issues that 
the project just comes in later.

Even though it might seem like some predecessors 
are really unnecessary, you usually planned them for a 
reason. So when you break your dependencies to fast-
track your project, you can significantly compromise the 
quality of the work that gets done. That means you might 
have to redo it altogether—which would probably take a 
lot of time.

While fast-tracking and crashing might work sometimes, 
they always add both risk and cost to your project.
Q: Do people really do Monte Carlo analysis to 
figure out their schedules? I have never heard of that 
before.
A: It’s true that most people don’t use this technique 
to figure out what might go wrong on their projects, so 
don’t feel bad if you’ve never heard of it. Some people 
think that this is just one of those things that is on the 
PMP exam, so you have to know what it is. But there 
really are some project managers who use it and get 
great results!
Q: The critical chain method sounds complicated. 
Do I need to know how to do it?
A: Not really. You need to know that it is a technique 
for developing schedules that takes resource assignment 
into account early on.

When project managers use the critical chain method, 
they identify strategic points to put buffers in their 
schedule and then manage the size of the buffers so that 
each milestone in the schedule is met.
Don’t worry, you won’t be asked to create a schedule 
using this technique. You just need to know the definition.
Updates refine the 
outputs of previous 
processes so you don’t 
have to go back and 
redo them.

310    Chapter 6
Influence the factors that cause change
Joe (on phone): Good afternoon, Joe’s Catering. Joe speaking. 
How can I help you?
Kathleen: Hello, Joe. This is Kathleen calling about Rob and 
Rebecca’s wedding. 
Joe: Oh, hi! Everything’s going fine with that wedding. 
Kathleen: Are you sure? What about that big convention 
across town that’s going to be happening at the same time? 
Won’t it be tough to find waiters in June?
Joe: I didn’t think of that; we’d better start figuring out how 
we’ll handle it now.
The project manager doesn’t just wait for 
change to happen! She finds the things 
that cause change and influences them. 
Kathleen doesn’t just sit around and wait 
for schedule changes to happen…
Something doesn’t seem right 
with the catering.
By realizing that the convention across 
town will need waiters, too, Kathleen 
prevents a lot of changes before they 
cause schedule problems!
don’t wait for change

PMP exam that asks you about 
this.

Control Schedule inputs and outputs
As the project work is happening, you can always discover new information that 
makes you re-evaluate your plan, and use the Control Schedule process to make 
the changes. The inputs to Control Schedule cover the various ways you can discover 
that information. The outputs are the changes themselves. 
Control 
Schedule
You built the Schedule 
Management subplan back 
when you were in the Develop 
Project Management Plan 
process.
Changes are always 
compared to the schedule 
to understand impact. 
You discover a lot of 
changes by looking at 
performance improvements.
Updates to Time 
Management documents 
like the activity list or 
resource requirements 
New values for schedule

What Control Schedule updates
All of the stuff you made during the Develop Schedule process gets 
updated using the Control Schedule process. Here’s a closer look at 
what those updates mean. 
Control 
Schedule
Updates
Whenever a change is approved to your schedule, 
the baseline needs to be updated. That way, you will 
always be comparing your results to the right plan. 
As you make changes to your project schedule, you 
should be tracking your lessons learned so that other 
projects can benefit from your experience. Sometimes 
you might find changes to templates that will help 
future projects, too.
If the work you need to do changes, then you need to 
update your activity list and attributes to match the 
new information. 
Some scenarios for what might go wrong on your 
project might show up when you are already 
doing the work. You need to update your schedule 
accordingly. 
It could happen that the way you manage Control 
Schedule needs to change, and those changes would 
need to be updated in the Project Management 
plan.

Measuring and reporting 
performance
Most often, you identify changes by 
looking at performance data. It’s just as 
important once you make a change to gather 
performance data as it was when you found 
the change in the first place. Here’s how 
performance data feeds into the Control 
Schedule process.
Work 
Performance 
Data
Control 
Schedule
Work 
Performance 
Information
The Control Schedule process 
turns Work Performance 
Data into Work Performance 
Information.
Routine performance 
measurements might 
show that you are 
lagging in your schedule. 
We’ll learn more about 
how to measure this 
stuff in the next 
chapter.
Putting the recommended changes 
through Control Schedule will help 
you to evaluate the impact and 
update all the necessary documents. 
Now that you’ve been through 
the Control Schedule process, 
the Work Performance Data 
has been evaluated and 
turned into Work Performance 
Information.
During Control Schedule, you’ll use the routine measurements 
you’ve taken on  your schedule to come up with better 
understand of how your project is doing in relation to it’s 
baseline schedule. You might come up with new forecasts, or 
other information that will help your stakeholders know how 
you’re doing. Those new forecasts and status indicators are 
called work performance information. 

314    Chapter 6
Control Schedule tools and techniques
The tools and techniques for Control Schedule are all about figuring out where your 
project schedule stands. By comparing your actual project to the schedule you laid out 
in the baseline and looking at how people are performing, you can figure out how to 
handle every schedule change.
Resource optimization techniques
As things change in your project, you need to make 
sure that resources are covering all of the activities in 
your plan. That means you need to distribute resources 
so that the work that needs to get done always has a 
resource available to do it. 
Leads and lags, modeling techniques, 
schedule compression, scheduling tool 
Most of the tools from the last process apply to this one 
too. As you find variances in the schedule, you need to 
figure out the impact of those issues and change your 
schedule to account for the new information. 
Project management software
This is software like Microsoft Project that helps you 
organize and analyze all of the information you need to 
evaluate the schedule of any project.
Performance reviews
There are two important calculations called schedule 
variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) that 
give you valuable information about how your project is 
doing. You’ll learn all about them in the next chapter.
A lot of scheduling 
software contains logic 
to do this automatically.
Remember, Gantt charts—the bar charts you make with 
MS Project—are just one tool for scheduling. You may 
use them a lot in your day-to-day work, but they’re only 
one piece of Time Management. And remember, on the 
exam they’re called bar charts, not Gantt charts!
Hold it! Almost all the scheduling in my job 
is done with Gantt charts, but I barely see 
them here. What gives?
the tools of Control Schedule

time management
 Q: When I create work performance 
information, who uses them?
A: The work performance information 
that you create are used by a lot of people. 
The team uses them to keep an eye on the 
project. If there’s a schedule problem coming 
up, it alerts the team so that they can help 
you figure out how to avoid it.
Performance information is also used by 
your project’s sponsor and stakeholders, 
who are very interested in whether or not 
your project is on track. That information 
gives them a good picture of how the project 
is doing…and that’s especially important in 
Control Schedule, because most change 
control systems require that every change 
is approved by a change control board that 
includes sponsor and stakeholders. 
Q: What’s schedule data used for?
A: You use the schedule data to build 
the schedule, and you’ll usually generate 
and analyze it using a schedule tool (like 
Microsoft Project). It includes detailed 
information about things like resource 
requirements, alternate best-case and 
worst‑case schedules, and contingency 
reserves.
When you put together your schedule, you 
should look at all of these things in order 
to create an accurate plan. The more 
information you have when you’re building 
your schedule, the more likely it is that you’ll 
catch those little problems that add up to big 
schedule slips. 
Q: One of the tools is project 
management software. Do I need to know 
how to use software in order to pass the 
exam?
A: No. The PMP exam does not require 
that you know how to use software like 
Microsoft Project. However, if you spend 
a lot of time using project management 
software, then you probably have become 
very familiar with a lot of the Time 
Management concepts. It’s a good way to 
learn the basics of time management. 
Q: How often am I supposed to update 
the project calendar?
A: The project calendar shows you 
the working days for your team, holidays, 
nonworking days, planned training, and the 
dates that could affect your project. Luckily, 
in most companies these dates don’t change 
very often. You probably won’t need to 
update it—and most project managers just 
use their company’s existing project calendar.
When you’re doing Develop Schedule, you 
may discover that you need to make a 
change to the project calendar. That’s why 
updates to the project calendar are an output 
of Develop Schedule.
Q: What do I do with work 
performance data and work performance 
information once I’ve collected it?
A: When you’re planning your project, 
you’ll often look to your company’s past 
projects to see what went well and what 
could have been planned better. And where 
do you look? That information is in the 
organizational process assets.
So where do you think that information 
comes from? It comes from project 
managers like you who added their work 
performance data and information to the 
company’s Organizational Process Asset 
library.
Any time you 
generate data 
about your 
project, you should 
add it to your 
organizational 
process assets so 
you can use it for 
future projects.

Did you get thrown 
because you thought 
using a historical 
database meant 
that you were doing 
analogous estimation? 
If you’re plugging values 
into a database or

doing parametric 
estimation. A lot of 
people consider this 
a special type of 
analogous estimation, 
but describing it as 
parametric is more

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: C
You’re likely to get some questions that ask you about crashing and fast-tracking, and it’s important to know 
the difference between them. When you crash the project, it means that you add resources to it, especially 
to the critical path. There’s no real risk in doing that—in the worst-case scenario, the extra people just sit 
around!—but it does cost more. Fast-tracking means adjusting the schedule so that activities overlap. The 
same resources are doing the work, so it’s not going to cost more, but it’s definitely riskier, because now 
you’ve eliminated buffers and possibly broken some dependencies! And remember that crashing or fast-
tracking won’t always work to make the project go faster!
2. Answer: D
Calculating the early start (ES) of an activity isn’t hard. All you need to do is look at the early finish (EF) of the 
previous activity and add one. If there’s more than one predecessor, then you take the largest EF and add one. 
In this case, the predecessors to activity F are D, with an EF of 9, and E, with an EF of 12. So the ES of F is 
12 + 1 = 13.
3. Answer: A
It’s just as easy to calculate the late finish (LF). Look at the following activity, take its LS (late start), and 
subtract one. If there’s more than one following activity, use the one with the lowest LS. So, for activity F in the 
question, the following activities are G, with an LS of 17, and H, with an LS of 11. So the LF of F is 11 – 1 = 10.
4. Answer: C
Don’t let the jargon fool you! You don’t need to know anything about software testing to answer this question. 
When you have two activities, and the first activity has to be timed so that it finishes before the second one 
starts, then you’ve got a Finish-to-Start relationship, or FS.
5. Answer: B
This is a which-is-next question that describes a project that’s completed the Define Activities, Sequence 
Activities, Estimate Activity Resources, and Estimate Activity Durations processes. The next process in Time 
Management is Develop Schedule, which means that the next thing you do is create the schedule!

rolling wave planning when you’ve got

Exam Questions
Answers
6. Answer: D
The schedule baseline is an output of the Develop Schedule process, not an input. You should definitely 
know what goes into the schedule baseline: it’s a specific version of the schedule that you set aside and 
use for comparison later on, when you want to know if the project is running late.
7. Answer: A
You always want to be honest with your estimates. Every project has unknowns and risks, and there’s no 
way to estimate any activity exactly! Luckily, we have tools to deal with this. You can use reserve analysis, 
a tool of Estimate Activity Durations, to come up with a contingency reserve that you can use to plan for 
these risks.
8. Answer: B
The critical chain method is a technique that’s part of Develop Schedule that lets you figure out how to 
handle the problems that come with having limited resources. You use it to shuffle both activities and 
resources on your critical path. One important aspect of the critical chain method is that you can use it to 
add buffers to the schedule to reduce the risk of certain activities.
9. Answer: A
When you draw out a network diagram for the activities in the table, you end up with four paths. And you 
definitely should draw out the activity diagram for a question like this! You’re allowed to use scratch paper 
on the exam, and this is one place where you should definitely do it. Of the four paths, only one has the 
longest duration: Start‑A‑B‑C‑Finish, which has a duration of 6 + 4 + 8 = 18. That’s the critical path.
I get it-we can use the schedule 
baseline the same way that we use the 
scope baseline! We take a snapshot of 
it and then save it, so we can compare 
the project’s performance against it 
later!

332    Chapter 6
10. Answer: C
Activity F is in the path Start-A-D-E-F-Finish. This path has a duration of 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 10. The float of 
an activity is the longest time it can slip before it affects the critical path. In this case, activity F can slip by 
8 without causing the path that it’s on to go beyond the critical path. But any more than that, and its path 
becomes the new critical path!
11. Answer: C
This is the definition of fast-tracking, and you’re probably getting the hang of this one by now. You may get 
a question like this, but you’ll almost certainly see fast-tracking as an incorrect answer to several questions!
12. Answer: A
Remember that when you see slack, it’s the same thing as float. Either term could appear on the exam!
13. Answer: B
This question is asking about the Estimate Activity Durations process. Take a look at the answers—there’s 
only one answer that’s used in that process: you need to start with the activity list in order to do the 
estimates for the activities! The other answers are things that are inputs, tools, or techniques for other 
processes.
14. Answer: C
It’s not hard to remember the order in which the Time Management processes are performed. If you use 
a little common sense, you can reason your way through a question like this. You need to define your 
activities before you can sequence them, you need to know who’s going to be doing an activity before you 
can estimate how long it’s going to take, and you need to do all of that before you can build a schedule!
15. Answer: A
You’ll have to know the different kinds of estimating techniques for the exam. You don’t necessarily have 
to be good at doing them, but you should recognize which are which. Parametric estimating is when you 
plug values into a formula, program, or spreadsheet and get an estimate. Analogous estimating uses 
similar activities from past projects to calculate new estimates. Three-point estimating uses an optimistic, 
pessimistic, and realistic estimate.
Exam Questions
Answers
Did you notice answer A? Don’t forget 
that the float of any activity in the 
critical path is zero!
When a question asks what you’d use for a process, 
it’s asking you to pick an input, tool, or technique 
that’s part of the process.
exam answers
Control Schedule isn’t included in the list of processes 
because if a schedule change happens, you’ll have to go 
back and revisit the other Time Management processes.

Exam Questions
Answers
16. Answer: C
This question is asking you to apply the PERT three-point estimation formula: (optimistic time + 4 × most likely time 
+ pessimistic time) ÷ 6. When a question gives you these values directly, it’s easy. But in this case, to answer the 
question you had to figure out the values for the optimistic time and pessimistic time, which meant that you needed 
to look at the assumptions that the team was making. The most likely time was given: 27 weeks. The best-case 
scenario would come in two weeks earlier, at 25 weeks, and the worst case would come in five weeks late, at 32 
weeks. So the estimate is (25 weeks + 4 x (27 weeks) + 32 weeks) ÷ 6 = 27.5 weeks.

17. Answer: C
The path Start-E-D-C-End has a duration of 8 + 2 + 4 = 14, which is the longest total duration in the entire network.
18. Answer: B
Activity A is on three different paths: Start-A-B-C-End (13), Start-A-D-C-End (12), and Start-A-D-G-End (9). To 
calculate its float, you take the longest path’s length and subtract it from the length of the critical path: 14 – 13 = 1.
It looks like there will 
be a bunch of questions 
on the critical path 
method! It’s a good thing 
I’ve got so much practice 
with it.
Sometimes you’ll get a question about 
applying a formula, but you’ll need 
to read the text in the question to 
figure out all of the variables.
Can you think of how a question 
might quiz you on this information 
without actually asking you to look 
at a network diagram?
 19. Answer: A
Since activity E is on the critical path, its float is zero, because the float of any activity on the critical path is zero.
20. Answer: A
The Schedule Management plan tells you how changes to the schedule are to be handled. Any time there’s a 
change, the first thing you should do is consult the plan to see how it should be handled.

334    Chapter 6
21. Answer: A
The organizational process assets contain historical information about past projects. When you write up your 
lessons learned, or create work performance information, you store it in your company’s organizational process 
asset library! Also, did you notice that answer B was the wrong definition of parametric estimation?
22. Answer: D
Crashing the schedule is the form of schedule compression that increases cost. This is a difficult question 
because all of the answers sound good, and one or two are a little misleading! Don’t fall into the trap of 
choosing an answer because you recognize a valid tool or technique in it. Reserve analysis and three-point 
estimates are very useful techniques, but they’re not the answer to this question. 
23. Answer: B
The critical path is the path in the network diagram where any delay will cause a delay in the schedule. These 
are the activities that cannot slip without making the project late!
24. Answer: C
This question was really about the definition of duration, and the key to answering it is to understand how 
duration is different from effort. The correct answer talks about “calendar time,” which is what a duration is: it’s a 
measurement (or estimate) of how long the activity will take in real life, taking into account the number of people 
who will be doing the work, the availability of the people and other resources, everyone’s vacation time, time 
taken away from the schedule because people are pulled off of the activity to work on higher-priority activities, 
and other real-world factors. That’s different from effort (which is often measured in person-hours), and it’s 
different from resource estimating (which involves estimating how many people and what other resources will 
be used for the activity).

Introducing the Cost Management processes
Estimate Costs process
This means figuring out exactly how much you expect 
each work activity you are doing to cost. So each 
activity is estimated for its time and materials cost, and 
any other known factors that can be figured in. 
Determine Budget process
Here’s where all of the estimates are added up and 
baselined. Once you have figured out the baseline, 
that’s what all future expenditures are compared to. 
Control Costs process
This just means tracking the actual work 
according to the budget to see if any adjustments 
need to be made. 
To make sure that they don’t go over budget, Jeff, Charles, and Alice sit down 
and come up with detailed estimates of their costs. Once they have that, 
they add up the cost estimates into a budget, and then they track the project 
according to that budget while the work is happening.

going to do and how long 
it will take to do that 
work. 
This is just like the 
scope baseline from 
Chapter 5 or the 
schedule baseline from 
Chapter 6. 
Controlling costs means always 
knowing how you are doing 
compared to how you thought 
you would do. 
Plan Cost Management
Just like all of the other knowledge areas, you need to 
plan out all of the processes and methodologies you’ll 
use for Cost Management up front. 

340    Chapter 7
plan cost management
Plan how you’ll estimate, track, and control 
your costs
When you’ve got your project charter written and you’re starting to put together your 
Project Management plan, you need to think about all of the processes and standards 
you’ll follow when you estimate your budget and track to that estimate. By now, you’re 
pretty familiar with the inputs, outputs, tools, and techniques you’ll use in the Plan 
Cost Management process.

Now you’ve got a consistent way to manage costs
There’s only one output of the Plan Cost Management process, and that’s the 
Cost Management plan. You’ll use this document to specify the accuracy of your 
cost estimates, the rules you’ll use to determine whether or not your cost processes 
are working, and the way you’ll track your budget as the project progresses. When 
you’ve planned out your Cost Management processes, you should be able to 
estimate how much your project will cost using a format consistent with all the rest 
of your company’s projects. You should also be able to tell your management how 
you’ll know if your project starts costing more than you estimated. 
Outputs
Cost Management plan
Here’s where you write down the 
subsidiary plan inside the Project 
Management plan that deals with 
costs. You plan out all of the work 
you’ll do to figure out your budget 
and make sure your project stays 
within it. 
The Plan Cost Management process is where 
you plan out all the work you’ll do to make 
sure your project doesn’t cost more than 
you’ve budgeted. 
You’ll want to define the 
units you’ll use to manage 
your budget. For some 
projects, that’s total 
person-hours; for others, 
it’s an actual value in 
money. However you plan 
to track your costs, you 
need to let everybody 
on the project know up 
front.

Alice wants to keep the Lounge project’s costs under control, and that 
starts with the Estimate Costs process. Before Alice can estimate costs, 
she needs the scope baseline. Once she knows who’s doing what work, 
and how long it’ll take, she can figure out how much it will cost. 
The project scope 
statement lists all the 
objectives and the 
deliverables of the 
project. She’ll need to 
know that to figure 
out how much the 
work will cost.

1. The Starbuzz across the street opened just a few 
months ago. Alice sits down with the contractor 
who did the work there and asks him to help her 
figure out how much it will cost. He takes a look at 
the equipment Charles and Jeff want to buy and 
the specs for the cabinets and seating and tells her 
what she can afford to do with the budget she has. 
Tool: 
2. Alice creates a spreadsheet with all of the 
historical information from similar remodeling 
projects that have happened on her block. She sits 
down and types in the guys’ desired furnishings 
and the square footage of the room to generate an 
estimated cost. 
Tool:
3. Before Alice finishes her schedule, she gathers all 
of the information she has about previous projects’ 
costs (like how much labor and materials cost). She 
also talks to a contractor, who gives valuable input.
Tool:
4. Alice sits down and estimates each and every 
activity and resource that she is going to need. 
Then she adds up all of the estimates into “rolled-up” 
categories. From there she adds up the categories 
into an overall budget number. 
Tool:
5. Jeff sets up an appointment with the same 
contractor his friend used for some remodelling 
work. The contractor comes to the house, takes a 
look at the room, and then gives an estimate for 
the work.
Tool:
6. Alice figures out a best-case scenario, a most 
likely scenario, and a worst-case scenario. Then she 
used a formula to come up with an expected cost 
for the project. 

Tool:
You’ve actually seen five of the tools and techniques in the 
Estimate Costs process before. Take a look at the list of tools 
below, and try to figure out which one of them Alice is using 
when she estimates costs. Can you write down which tool is being 
used in each scenario?
A. Bottom-up estimating
B. Analogous estimating 
C. Expert judgment
D. Parametric estimating
E. Three-point estimates

344    Chapter 7
Take a minute and think about why it would be 
called “top-down.” When you’re doing bottom-
up estimating, first you break it down into 
pieces, estimate each piece, and add them up. 
Analogous estimation is the opposite: you start 
with the whole project (without breaking it up at 
all), find other projects that were like it, and use 
those projects to come up with a new estimate.
Analogous estimating is 
sometimes called “top-down 
estimating”
Watch it!
Did you work out which estimating tool from Time Management 
Alice is using when she estimates costs in each of these scenarios?
1: B. Analogous estimating
2: D. Parametric estimating
3: C. Expert judgment
4: A. Bottom-up estimating
5: C. Expert judgment
6: E. Three-point estimate
Good question.
Not all of the estimation techniques for cost are 
the same as the ones we used for time. Often, 
people only have a certain amount of time to 
devote to a project, and a fixed amount of money 
too. So, it makes sense that some of the tools for 
estimating both would overlap. We’ll learn a few 
new ones next. 
Since Alice is using the contractor’s experience 
with a similar project to figure out how long her 
project will take, she is assuming that her project 
will go like the Starbuzz one did.
In this one Alice is just applying some numbers 
particular to her project to some historical 
information she has gathered from other 
projects and generating an estimate from that.
Expert judgment often involves going back to 
historical information about past projects as 
well as consulting with experts or using your own 
expertise.
Starting at the lowest level and rolling up 
estimates is bottom-up estimating. Alice started 
with the activities on her schedule and rolled them 
up to categories and finally to a budget number. 
This is another example of asking somebody 
who has direct experience with this kind of 
work to give an estimate.
Alice came up with the three estimates and then 
performed the PERT calculation on them. 
Hold on! How can you 
use the same tools to 
estimate both time and 
cost?

Other tools and techniques used in Estimate Costs
Project management estimating software
Project managers will often use specialized estimating 
software to help come up with cost estimates (like a 
spreadsheet that takes resource estimates, labor costs, and 
materials costs and performs calculations).
Vendor bid analysis
Sometimes you will need to work with an external 
contractor to get your project done. You might even 
have more than one contractor bid on the job. This tool 
is all about evaluating those bids and choosing the one 
you will go with.
Cost of quality
You will need to figure the cost of all of your quality-
related activities into the overall budget, too. Since it’s 
cheaper to find bugs earlier in the project than later, there 
are always quality costs associated with everything your 
project produces. Cost of quality is just a way of tracking 
the cost of those activities. 
Reserve analysis
You need to set aside some money for cost overruns. If you 
know that your project has a risk of something expensive 
happening, better to have some cash laying around to deal 
with it. Reserve analysis means putting some cash away 
just in case. 
$
$
Cost of quality 
is how much 
money it takes 
to do the project 
right. 
Since the next 
chapter is all about 
quality, you’ll be 
learning a lot about 
this in Chapter 8.
You’ll see this in action 
when we look at Risk 
Management in Chapter 11.
A lot of times you come into a project and there is already an expectation of how much 
it will cost or how much time it will take. When you make an estimate really early in 
the project and you don’t know much about it, that estimate is called a rough order 
of magnitude estimate. (You’ll also see it called a ROM or a ballpark estimate.) 
It’s expected that it will get more refined as time goes on and you learn more about the 
project. Here are some more tools and techniques used to estimate cost: 
This estimate is REALLY 
rough! It’s got a range of 
-25% to +75%, which means 
it can be anywhere from half 
to one and a half times the 
actual cost! So you only use it 
at the very beginning of the 
project.
Group decision-making techniques
You’ll need to work with groups of people to figure out 
your costs. It’s important that your team feels like they can 
commit to the overall budget and schedule. 

346    Chapter 7
Let’s talk numbers
Benefit cost ratio (BCR)
This is the amount of money a project is going to make versus 
how much it will cost to build it. Generally, if the benefit is 
higher than the cost, the project is a good investment. 
Net present value (NPV)
This is the actual value at a given time of the project minus all of the 
costs associated with it. This includes the time it takes to build it and 
labor as well as materials. People calculate this number to see if it’s 
worth doing a project. 
Opportunity cost
When an organization has to choose between two projects, it’s 
always giving up the money it would have made on the one it 
doesn’t do. That’s called opportunity cost. It’s the money you 
don’t get because you chose not to do a project. 
Internal rate of  return
This is the amount of money the project will return to the company 
that is funding it. It’s how much money a project is making the 
company. It’s usually expressed as a percentage of the funding that 
has been allocated to it. 
Depreciation
This is the rate at which your project loses value over time. So, 
if you are building a project that will only be marketable at a 
high price for a short period of time, the product loses value as 
time goes on. 
There are a few numbers that can appear on the test as definitions. You 
won’t need to calculate these, but you should know what each term means. 
You’ll get exam questions 
asking you to use BCR 
or NPV to compare two 
projects. The higher these 
numbers are, the better!
budget numbers
Lifecycle costing
Before you get started on a project, it’s really useful to figure out how 
much you expect it to cost—not just to develop, but to support the 
product once it’s in place and being used by the customer.
Money you’ll get in three years isn’t 
worth as much to you as money you’re 
getting today. NPV takes the “time 
value” of money into consideration, 
so you can pick the project with the 
best value in today’s dollars.
If a project will make your company 
$150,000, then the opportunity cost 
of selecting another project instead 
is $150,000 because that’s how much 
your company’s missing out on by not 
doing the project.

Match each scenario to the cost numbers that Alice is using in each one.
Answers: 1–A, 2–C, 3–D, 4–E, 5–B
1. Alice does such a good job planning out her 
entertainment center remodeling that the Smiths 
down the street ask if they can have her help with 
their home theater upgrade. Since she is too busy 
doing the work on the lounge, she has to say no. 
Rob Smith says, “That’s a shame; we were willing 
to pay $1,000 to someone to help us out with this.”
2. The minute the TV gets installed, Alice starts 
inviting all of her friends over to the lounge to 
watch the games on the weekend. She charges a 
$2 cover charge for her football Saturdays and has 
been clearing about $20 per week even though the 
room isn’t finished. 
3. Even though the system she is currently 
installing is state of the art, Alice knows that 
within a year or so it will be on sale for half as 
much as she is paying now.
4. Alice wants to figure out how much the project 
is worth so far. So she adds up the value of all of 
the materials she has used, and subtracts the labor 
and any depreciation that needs to be accounted 
for. The number she ends up with gives the value 
of the overall project right now. 
5. Before Jeff and Charles decided to do the 
remodeling, they compared how much the project 
was going to cost to how much good they thought 
it would do for them. 
A. Opportunity cost
B. Benefit cost ratio
C. Internal rate of return

the lounge budget
Now Alice knows how much the Lounge will cost
Once you’ve applied all of the tools in the Estimate Costs process, you’ll get an 
estimate for how much your project will cost. It’s always important to keep all of 
your supporting estimate information, too. That way, you know the assumptions 
you made when you were coming up with your numbers. 
Activity cost estimates
This is the cost estimate for all of the activities in your activity list. It 
takes into account resource rates and estimated duration of 
the activities. 
Basis of estimates
Just like the WBS has a WBS dictionary, and the activity list has 
activity attributes, the cost estimate has a supporting detail called the 
basis of estimates. Here is where you list out all of the rates and 
reasoning you have used to come to the numbers you are presenting 
in your estimates. 
Updates to project documents
Along the way, you might find that you need to change the way you 
measure and manage cost. These updates allow you to make changes 
to the Project Management plan to deal with those improvements.

Lounge conversation
Jeff: OK, how do we start? There are a lot of things to 
buy here. 
Alice: We already have your savings, and the rest will 
come in July at the end of the quarter. The Lounge is 
having another great year, so the profits are pretty good. 
Your savings are around $4,000 and the profits will 
probably be closer to $6,000. That’s definitely enough 
money to work with. 
Charles: Well, the furniture I want isn’t back in stock until 
June.
Alice: OK, so we have to time our costs so that they’re in 
line with our cash flow. 
Jeff: Oh! I see. So we can start building now, but we’ll still 
have money in June and July when the furniture comes 
in. Perfect.

Once Alice has cost estimates for each activity, she’s ready to put a budget 
together. She does that using the Determine Budget process. Here’s where

Determine budget: how to build a budget
Roll up your estimates into 
control accounts.
This tool is called cost aggregation. You 
take your activity estimates and roll them 
up into control accounts on your work 
breakdown structure. That makes it easy 
for you to know what each work package 
in your project is going to cost.

Come up with your reserves.
When you evaluate the risks to your 
project, you will set aside some cash 
reserves to deal with any issues that 
might come your way. This tool is called 
reserve analysis. 
2
Build a baseline.
Just like your scope and schedule baselines, a cost baseline 
is a snapshot of the planned budget. You compare your actual 
performance against the baseline so you always know how you are 
doing versus what you planned.

It’s true that not everybody has 
access to historical data to do a 
check like this. But, for the purposes 
of the test, you need to know that 
it’s a tool for making your budget 
accurate. 
If you blow your limit, you need to 
replan or go to your sponsor to figure 
out what to do. It could be that 
a scope change is necessary, or the 
funding limit can be increased. 
Use your expert judgment.
Here’s where you compare your project to 
historical data that has been collected on other 
projects to give your budget some grounding 
in real-world historical relationships, and 
you use your own expertise and the expertise 
of others to come up with a realistic budget to 
cover your project’s costs. 
Make sure you haven’t 
blown your limits.
This tool is funding limit 
reconciliation. Since most people work 
in companies that aren’t willing to throw 
unlimited money at a project, you need 
to be sure that you can do the project 
within the amount that your company is 
willing to spend.

Figure out funding 
requirements.
It’s not enough to have an overall 
number that everyone can agree to. You 
need to plan out how and when you will 
spend it, and document those plans in 
the project funding requirements. 
This output is about figuring out how 
you will make sure your project has 
money when it’s needed, and that you 
have enough to cover unexpected risks as 
well as known cost increases that change 
with time. 
Update your project 
documents.
Once you have estimated and produced 
your baseline and funding requirements, 
you need to update your Cost 
Management plan with anything you 
learned along the way.

Your company’s management plans for project overruns!
Just because you plan out a budget in your cost baseline, that doesn’t mean your project is 100% guaranteed 
to fall inside that budget. It’s common for a company to have a standard policy for keeping a management 
reserve to cover unexpected, unplanned costs. When you need to get your project funded, that funding has 
to cover both the budget in your cost baseline and the management reserve.
So these requirements 
need to cover both 
the budget and the 
management reserve.

What tool or technique is Alice using to build the budget?
1.  Alice reads a newspaper article that says that there has been a sharp increase in lumber costs recently. She knows 
this wasn’t in her contractor’s original plan and decides to put a few hundred dollars aside to deal with the price hike if it 
should happen.

  c Funding limit reconciliation
 Answers: 1. Reserve analysis 2. Cost aggregation 3. Funding limit reconciliation

Parametric estimation is used 
in Estimate Costs and Determine 
Budget.

Cost aggregation is rolling up 
costs from the work package level 
to the control account level so that 
the numbers can be followed down 
through the WBS hierarchy.

Control accounts are high-
level WBS items that are used 
to track cost estimates. They do 
not represent activities or work 
packages. They represent the cost 
of the work packages and activities 
that appear under them in the WBS.
 

The main outputs of Estimate 
Costs are the activity cost estimate 
and the basis of estimates. The 
main outputs of Determine Budget 
are the cost baseline and project 
funding requirements. 

You will get questions on the exam 
asking you to select between 
projects using net present value 
(NPV) or benefit cost ratio (BCR). 
Always choose the project with the 
biggest NPV or BCR!

Lifecycle costing means 
estimating the money it will take 
to support your product or service 
when it has been released. 

Rough order of magnitude 
Estimation is estimating with very 
little accuracy at the beginning 
of a project and then refining the 
estimate over time. It’s got a range 
of –25% to +75%.

A management reserve is money 
set aside to cover unplanned, 
unexpected costs. Your project’s 
funding requirements need to 
cover both the budget in the cost 
baseline and the management 
reserve.

Q: Isn’t it enough to know my project’s 
scope and schedule, and then trust the 
budget to come out all right?
A: Even if you don’t have a strict budget 
to work within, it makes sense to estimate 
your costs. Knowing your costs means 
that you have a good idea of the value of 
your project all the time. That means you 
will always know the impact (in dollars) 
of the decisions you make along the way. 
Sometimes understanding the value of your 
project will help you to make decisions that 
will keep your project healthier.
Many of us do have to work within a set of 
cost expectations from our project sponsors. 
The only way to know if you are meeting 
those expectations is to track your project 
against the original estimates. 
It might seem like fluff. But knowing how 
much you are spending will help you relate 
to your sponsor’s expectations much better 
as well. 
Q: In my job I am just handed a 
budget. How does estimating help me?
A: In the course of estimating, you might 
find that the budget you have been given is 
not realistic. Better to know that while you’re 
planning, before you get too far into the 
project work, rather than later. 

You can present your findings to the sponsor 
and take corrective action right away if your 
estimate comes in pretty far off target. Your 
sponsor and your project team will thank you 
for it. 







Q: What if I don’t have all of this 
information and I am supposed to give a 
ballpark estimate? 
A: This is where those rough order of 
magnitude estimates come in. That’s just 
a fancy way of saying you take your best 
guess, knowing that it’s probably inaccurate, 
and you let everybody know that you will be 
revising your estimates as you know more 
and more about the project. 
Q: My company needs to handle 
maintenance of projects after we release 
them. How do you estimate for that?
A: That’s called lifecycle costing. The way 
you handle it is just like you handle every 
other estimate. You sit down and try to think 
of all of the activities and resources involved 
in maintenance, and project the cost. Once 
you have an estimate, you present it along 
with the estimate for initially building the 
product or service.
Q: I still don’t get net present value. 
What do I use it for?
A: The whole idea behind net present 
value is that you can figure out which of 
two projects is more valuable to you. Every 
project has a value—if your sponsor’s 
spending money on it, then you’d better 
deliver something worth at least that much 
to him! That’s why you figure out NPV by 
coming up with how much a project will be 
worth, and then subtracting how much it will 
cost. But for the exam, all you really need 
to remember are two things: net present 
value has the cost of the project built into 
it, and if you need to use NPV to select one 
of several projects, always choose the one 
with the biggest NPV. That’s not hard to 
remember, because you’re just choosing the 
one with the most value!
Q: Hold on just a minute. Can we go 
back to the rough order of magnitude 
estimate? I remember from my math 
classes that an order of magnitude 
has something to do with a fixed ratio. 
Wouldn’t –50% to +100% make more 
sense as an order of magnitude?
A: Yes, it’s true that in science, math, 
statistics, or engineering, an order of 
magnitude typically involves a series of 
magnitudes increasing by a fixed ratio. So 
if an order of magnitude down is 50%, then 
you’d typically maintain that same 2:1 ratio 
between orders of magnitude, so the next 
order of magnitude higher would be 100%.

However, if you check the PMBOK Guide, 
it defines it as follows: ” a project in the 
initiation phase could have a rough order 
of magnitude (ROM) estimate in the range 
of –25% to +75%.” [5th Edition, p201] Since 
that’s the definition in the PMBOK Guide, 
that’s what to remember for the exam.





Estimate Costs is just 
like Estimate Activity 
Durations. You get 
the cost estimate and 
the basis of the cost 
estimate, updates 
to the plan, and 
requested changes 
when you are done. 
Take a minute to think about what 
“value” really means. How does the 
sponsor know if he’s getting his money’s 
worth halfway through the project? 
Is there an easy way you can give the 
sponsor that information?

A few new tools and techniques
To-complete performance index
The to-complete performance index (TCPI) is 
a calculation that you can use to help you figure 
out how well your project needs to perform in the 
future in order to stay on budget.
Reserve analysis
Throughout your project, you are looking at how 
you are spending versus the amount of reserve 
you’ve budgeted. You might find that you are using 
reserved money at a faster rate than you expected 
or that you need to reserve more as new risks are 
uncovered. 
Project management software
You can use software packages to track your budget 
and make it easier to know where you might run 
into trouble. 
Forecasting
Use the information you have about the project 
right now to predict how close it will come to 
its goals if it keeps going the way it has been. 
Forecasting uses some earned value numbers to 
help you come up with preventive and corrective 
actions that can keep your project on the right track. 
Forecasting and performance 
measurement are very 
important! You use them to 
find the changes you need to 
make in your project. 
Performance reviews
Reviews are meetings where the project team 
reviews performance data to examine the variance 
between actual performance and the baseline. 
Earned value management is used to calculate and 
track the variance. Over time, these meetings are a 
good place to look into trends in the data.

Here’s where you measure how your project is 
doing compared to the plan. This involves using the 
earned value formulas to assess your project.

How to calculate planned value
If you look at your schedule and see that you’re supposed to have done a certain 
percentage of the work, then that’s the percent of the total budget that you’ve “earned” so 
far. This value is known as planned value. Here’s how you calculate it.
BAC—Budget at completion
This is the first number you think of when you work on 
your project costs. It’s the total budget that you have for 
your project—how much you plan to spend on your project.
The name “BAC” should make 
sense—it’s the budget of your 
project when it’s complete!
Planned % complete
If the schedule says that your team should have done 300 hours 
of work so far, and they will work a total of 1,000 hours on the 
project, then your planned % complete is 30%.
Planned % complete is easy to work 
out, as it’s just the calculation
Given amount ÷ Total amount.

This is how much of your budget you planned on using so far. 
If the BAC is $200,000, and the schedule says your planned % 
complete is 30%, then the planned value is $200,000 × 30% = 
$60,000.

Now it’s your turn! See if you can figure out BAC and PV
for a typical project.
1. You’re managing a project to install 200 windows in a new skyscraper and need to figure out your budget. 
Each week of the project costs the same: your team members are paid a total of $4,000 every week, and you 
need $1,000 worth of parts each week to do the work. If the project is scheduled to last 16 weeks, what’s 
the BAC for the project?

But wouldn’t be nice if, when your schedule said you 
were supposed to be 37.5% complete with the work, 
then you knew that you’d actually spent 37.5% of 
your budget?
Well, in the real world things don’t always work like that, 
but there are ways to work out—approximately—how 
far on (or off) track your budget actually is.
Hmm. Ok, but that

Earned value tells you how you’re doing
Your schedule 
tells you a lot 
about where you 
are supposed to 
be right now. 
When Alice wants to track how her project is doing versus the budget, she 
uses earned value. This is a technique where you figure out how much of 
your project’s value has been delivered to the customer so far. You can do 
this by comparing the value of what your schedule says you should have 
delivered against the value of what you actually delivered.
$2,200
$1,650
Today is May 14
The actual cost of this project on May 14th is $1,650. 
The planned value was $2,200. 
The schedule says we should 
have delivered this by now…
…but we only delivered this.

366    Chapter 7
EV—Earned value
This figure tells you how much your project actually earned. 
Every hour that each team member works adds value to the 
project. You can figure it out by taking the percentage of the 
hours that the team has actually worked and multiplying it by 
the BAC. If the total cost of the project is $200,000, then the 
earned value is $200,000 × 35% = $70,000.
When you do work, you convert 
the money your sponsor invests 
in your project into value. So, 
earned value is about how 
much work you have been 
able to accomplish with the 
money you’ve been given. 
When you calculate earned 
value, you’re showing your 
sponsor how much value that 
investment has earned. 
If your team actually got 35% of the work 
done when the schedule says they should only 
have gotten 30% done, that means they’re 
more efficient than you planned!
How to calculate earned value
If you could estimate each activity exactly, every single time, you wouldn’t 
need earned value. Your schedule would always be perfectly accurate, and 
you would always be exactly on budget.
But you know that real projects don’t really work that way! That’s why 
earned value is so useful—it helps you put a number on how far off 
track your project actually is. And that can be a really powerful tool for 
evaluating your progress and reporting your results. Here’s how you 
calculate it.
BAC—Budget at completion
Remember, this is the total budget that you have for your project.
Actual % complete
Say the schedule says that your team should have done 300 
hours of work so far, out of a total of 1,000. But you talk to your 
team and find out they actually completed 35% of the work. 
That means the actual % complete is 35%.

What’s the difference between actual cost and planned value? What does 
it mean if your AC is bigger than your PV? What if it’s smaller?
This is a harder problem to 
solve than it seems! Take a 
minute and really think about 
it before you turn the page.
You’ll be doing a lot of calculations in a minute. 
The best way to approach any calculation is to 
understand what it’s for and why you use it. 
So before you go on, grab a cup of coffee and 
think for a few minutes about the difference 
between BAC and PV. Also, how do you compute 
actual % complete on a real project? Doing 
that will really help you get these ideas firmly

Think about 
earned value 
from the 
sponsor’s 
perspective. 
It all makes 
a lot more 
sense then.
Put yourself in someone else’s shoes
Earned value is one of the most difficult concepts that you need 
to understand for the PMP exam. The reason it’s so confusing for 
so many people is that these calculations seem a little weird and 
arbitrary to a lot of project managers.
But they make a lot more sense if you think about your 
project the way your sponsor thinks about it. If you put 
yourself into the sponsor’s shoes, you’ll see that this stuff actually 
makes sense!
Let’s say you’re an executive:
You’re making a decision to spend $300,000 
of your company’s money on a project. To 
a project manager, that’s a project’s budget. 
But to you, the sponsor, that’s $300,000 of 
value you expect to get!
So how much value is the project delivering? 
If you’re the sponsor, you’re thinking about the 
bottom line. And that bottom line is whether or 
not you’re getting your money’s worth from the 
project. If the team’s done 50% of the work, then 
you’ve gotten $150,000 of value so far.
But if the schedule says that they should have 
done 60% of the work by now, then you’re 
getting less value than you were promised!
That’s the total 
budget, or the BAC.
That’s earned value—it’s 
based on how much work 
the team actually did.
Look at the schedule to figure 
out how much value you planned 
to deliver to your sponsor.
The sponsor doesn’t care as 
much about how you spend the 
budget. He just wants to get 
the most value for his money!
If you put the value in dollar terms, 
your sponsor knows what return he’s 
getting for his investment.

Neat. I think I can use these 
formulas to track my schedule and 
my budget!
You can definitely use them to track the schedule 
and budget on smaller projects.
But once your projects start getting more complex, your formulas 
are going to need to take into account that you’ve got several people 
all doing different activities, and that could make it harder to track 
whether you’re ahead of schedule or over budget.

Is your project behind or ahead of schedule?
Figuring out if you’re on track in a small project with just a few people is easy. But 
what if you have dozens or hundreds of people doing lots of different activities? And 
what if some of them are on track, some are ahead of schedule, and some of them 
are behind? It starts to get hard to even figure out whether you’re meeting your goals.
Wouldn’t it be great if there were an easy way to figure out if you’re ahead or 
behind schedule? Well, good news: that’s exactly what earned value is used for!
Schedule performance index (SPI)
If you want to know whether you’re ahead of or behind 
schedule, use SPIs. The key to using this is that when 
you’re ahead of schedule, you’ve earned more value 
than planned! So EV will be bigger than PV.
To work out your SPI, you just divide your EV by your PV.
Schedule variance (SV)
It’s easy to see how variance works. The bigger the 
difference between what you planned and what 
you actually earned, the bigger the variance.
So, if you want to know how much ahead or behind 
schedule you are, just subtract PV from EV.
If SPI is greater than 
one, that means EV is 
bigger than PV, so you’re 
ahead of schedule!
If SPI is less than one, then you’re 
behind schedule because the amount 
you’ve actually worked (EV) is less 
than what you’d planned (PV).
… so if the variance is positive, it tells 
you exactly how many dollars you’re 
ahead. If it’s negative, it tells you how 
many dollars you’re behind.

multiply it with the BAC to find the earned value.

Are you over budget?
You can do the same thing for your budget that you can 
do for your schedule. The calculations are almost exactly 
the same, except instead of using planned value—which 
tells you how much work the schedule says you should 
have done so far—you use actual cost (AC). That’s the 
amount of money that you’ve spent so far on the project.
Cost performance index (CPI)
If you want to know whether you’re over or 
under budget, use CPI.
Remember what CV means to the sponsor: 
EV says how much of the total value of 
the project has been earned back so far. 
If CV is negative, then he’s not getting 
good value for his money.
You’re within your budget if…
You’ve blown your budget if…
CV = $4,000 - $5,750 = -$1,750
And that’s how much they’ve gone over! 
Jeff, Charles, and Alice had better figure 
out how to contain those runaway costs, or 
they’ll have a nasty surprise later.
Now Alice can take a look at the Lounge’s checkbook. She 
figures out that she spent $5,750 on the project so far.
CPI = $4,000 ÷ $5,750 = 0.696
Since CPI is less than 1, it means that Jeff 
and Charles have blown their budget.
Cost variance (CV)
This tells you the difference between what you 
planned on spending and what you actually spent.
So, if you want to know how much under or over 
budget you are, just take AC away from EV.

 Measuring 
your cost 
difference in 
dollars is 
easy, but 
what if your schedule 
variance is negative?
A lot of people worry about that, 
but it’s actually not bad. Planned 
value just means that you planned 
on delivering a certain amount of 
value to your sponsor at a certain 
time. An SV of, say, –$5,000 tells 
you that you haven’t delivered all 
the value you promised.
Relax
CPI is greater than or equal to 1 and CV 
is positive. When this happens, your actual 
costs are less than earned value, which 
means the project is delivering more value 
than it costs.
CPI is less than 1 and CV is negative. 
When your actual costs are more than earned 
value, that means that your sponsor is not 
getting his money’s worth of value from 
the project.

that’s been done, while AC tells

The earned value management formulas
Earned value management (EVM) is just one of the tools and 
techniques in the Control Costs process, but it’s a big part of PMP 
exam preparation. When you use these formulas, you’re measuring 
and analyzing how far off your project is from your plan. Remember, 
think of everything in terms of how much value you’re delivering to 
your sponsor! Take a look at the formulas one more time:
Remember, your sponsor always cares 
most about what the project is worth 
to him. BAC says how much value he’s 
getting for the whole project, and EV 
tells him how much of that value he’s 
gotten so far.

Interpret CPI and SPI numbers to gauge your project
The whole idea behind earned value management is that you can use it to 
easily put a number on how your project is doing. That’s why there will be 
exam questions that test you on your ability to interpret these numbers! Luckily, 
it’s pretty easy to evaluate a project based on the EVM formulas.
If your project is on track, that means 
you’re delivering the value you promised.
You can tell that your project is on track because the two 
index numbers—CPI and SPI—are both very close to 
1, and the variance numbers—CV and SV—are very 
close to zero dollars. It’s very rare that you’ll get exactly 
to a CPI of 1 or a SV of $0, but a SPI of 1.02 means 
you’re very close to on time, and a CV of –$26 means 
you’re very close to on budget.
A lot of PMOs have a 
rule where a CPI or SPI 
between 0.95 and 1.10 
is absolutely fine! 
You can tell if your project is ahead of schedule 
or under budget by looking for larger numbers.
If the CPI is much bigger than 1, it means you’re under 
budget. And you can tell how much under by looking at the 
CV—that’s what variance is for! It helps you see just how much 
the actual cost varies from the value you were supposed to earn 
by now.
Sometimes you’ll see negative 
values written in parentheses—
in this case, ($26).
Being a long way under 
budget isn’t always a 
good thing. It means you 
asked for and were given 
resources that you didn’t 
need—and which your 
company could have used 
elsewhere.
A project that’s behind schedule or over budget will 
have lower numbers.
When you see a SPI that’s between 0 and 1, that tells you that the project 
is behind schedule…and that means you’re not delivering enough value 
to the sponsor! That’s when you check the SV to see how much less value 
you’re delivering. And the same goes for cost—a low CPI means that your 
project is over budget, and CV will tell you how much more value you 
promised to deliver to the sponsor.
CPI and SPI 
can’t be below 
zero, because 
they’re ratios!
If the SPI is 
below 1, then 
your project 
is behind 
schedule. But 
if you see a 
CPI under 1, 
your project is 
over budget!
Ahead of schedule 
or under budget
Behind schedule

you are here 4    375
cost management
Exactly! And when your CPI is really 
close to 1, it means that every dollar 
your sponsor’s spending on the project 
is earning just about a dollar in value.
The biggest thing to remember about all of these 
numbers is that the lower they are, the worse 
your project is doing. If you’ve got a SPI of 1.1 
and a CPI of 1.15, then you’re within your budget 
and ahead of schedule. But if you calculate a SPI of 
0.6 and a CPI of 0.45, then you’re behind schedule 
and you’ve blown your budget. And when these 
ratios are below 1, then you’ll see a 
negative variance! 
Remember:
Lower = Loser
If CPI or SPI is below 1, or if CV or SV is negative, 
then you’ve got trouble!
Oh, I get it: SPI and CPI are 
just ratios! If SPI is really close 
to 1, then SV will be really close to 
zero-and it means that my project is 
going as planned!

Forecast what your project will look like when it’s done
There’s another piece of earned value management, and it’s part of the last tool 
and technique in Cost Management: forecasting. The idea behind forecasting 
is that you can use earned value to come up with a pretty accurate prediction of 
what your project will look like at completion.
If you know your CPI now, you can use it to predict what your project 
will actually cost when it’s complete. Let’s say that you’re managing a 
project with a CPI of 0.8 today. If you assume that the CPI will be 0.8 for the rest 
of the project—and that’s not an unreasonable assumption when you’re far along 
in the project work—then you can predict your total costs when the project is 
complete. We call that estimate at completion (EAC).
If your CPI is below 1, that means 
you’re running over budget—which 
will give you an EAC that’s larger 
than your current budget.
If your CPI is above 
1, you’re running 
under budget, so the 
estimate will end up 
smaller than your BAC.
There are a bunch of different ways to calculate EAC, 
but this one is sufficient for the PMP exam.

You can use EAC, 
ETC, and VAC 
to predict what 
your earned value 
numbers will look 
like when your 
project is complete.
There are two useful numbers that you can compute with the EAC. One 
of them is called estimate to complete (ETC), which tells you how 
much more money you’ll probably spend on your project. And the other 
one, variance at completion (VAC), predicts what your variance will be 
when the project is done.
Once you’ve got an estimate, you can calculate a variance!
Since EAC predicts how much money 
you’ll spend, if you subtract the 
AC, you’ll find out how much money 
the rest of the project will end up 
costing.
If you end up spending more than 
your budget, the VAC will be 
negative…just like CV and SV!
EAC –
=
ETC
AC
BAC –
=
VAC
EAC
S 11,507 – S 5,750 = S 5,757
…but will the guys be 
able to come up with 
the extra money?
If the EAC is 
$11,507, and the AC is 
$5,750, then I can figure out 
what Jeff and Charles have 
left to spend.
 ETC = EAC - AC.
…and now she knows how 
much money the rest of 
the project is likely to 
cost...
S 10,000 – S 11,507= –S 1,507
So, we’re over budget. 
But what will the damage be? 
At least now I can figure out 
the final variance.
VAC = BAC - EAC.

               You’re a project manager working on a large project scheduled to last for two years. You’ve got six
different teams working on five major functional areas. Some teams are ahead of schedule, and
others are falling behind. That means that you have cost overruns in some areas, but you’ve saved
costs in others—and that’s making it very hard to get an intuitive grasp on whether your project is
over or under budget!
It’s nine months into your project. The total budget for your project is $4,200,000. You’ve spent $1,650,000 so far, and
you’ve got a CPI of .875. Use the earned value management formulas from forecasting to figure out where things stand.

situation will be like at project completion. You’ve now spent a total of $2,625,000. You look at all of the activities done 
by the team, and you find that the project is 70% complete. Can you come up with a new forecast for your project?

There are some times when you’ll need to flip the formulas upside down! 
Sometimes you’re going to be on the receiving end of earned value numbers. If 
you’re working at a company with a bunch of project managers, then sometimes 
you’ll get a report from one of them that only gives you part of the picture! 
Finding missing information
Most of the earned value questions on the exam will be pretty straightforward: 
you’ll be given the numbers that you need to plug into a formula, and when 
you do it you’ll get the answer. But once in a while, you’ll get a question that 
isn’t quite so straightforward.
Let’s say you’re given…
…the CPI and earned value, and you want to 
figure out the actual costs. Why would you 
ever see this? Sometimes it’s hard to figure out 
how important a project is unless you know how 
much it’s really spending—if a project is more 
expensive, people in your company probably 
care more about it. If you’re told that a project’s 
CPI is 1.14 and its EV is $350,000, how do you 
figure out the actual costs?
Here’s the formula for CPI. 
But what do you do if you’re 
given CPI and EV, and need 
to figure out AC?
Let’s fill in the 
numbers that we know!
You’re going to have to use 
a little basic algebra here… 
but it’s really easy!
…the earned value and actual percent 
complete, and you want to figure out the 
project’s budget. This can be really helpful 
when you need to “read between the lines” to 
make a decision about a project when someone 
doesn’t want to give you all the information 
you need. When you have a project’s EV of 
$438,750 and its actual % complete of 32.5%, 
how do you figure out the total budget (BAC)?
Now you know everything 
you need to calculate the 
final numbers.
Start with the formula 
that includes all the 
numbers you’re looking for.
Don’t forget that a 32.5% 
is the same as 0.325.

384    Chapter 7
 Q: What does CPI really mean, and why can it 
predict your final budget?
A: Doesn’t it seem a little weird that you can come up 
with a pretty accurate forecast of what you’ll actually spend 
on your project just by dividing CPI into your BAC, or the 
total amount that you’re planning to spend on the project? 
How can there be one “magic” number that does that 
for you?

But when you think about it, it actually makes sense. Let’s 
say that you’re running 15% over budget today. If your 
budget is $100,000, then your CPI will be $100.000 ÷ 
$115,000 = .87. One good way to predict what your final 
budget will look like is to assume that you’ll keep running 
15% over budget. Let’s say your total budget is $250,000. If 
you’re still 15% over at the end of the budget, your final CPI 
will still be $250,000 ÷ $287,500 = .87! Your CPI will always 
be .87 if you’re 15% over budget.

That’s why we call that forecast EAC—it’s an estimate of 
what your budget will look like at completion. By dividing 
CPI into BAC, all you’re doing is calculating what your final 
budget will be if your final budget overrun or underrun is 
exactly the same as it is today.
Q: Is that really the best way to estimate costs? 
What if things change between now and the end of the 
project?
A: EAC is a good way to estimate costs, because it’s 
easy to calculate and relatively accurate—assuming that 
nothing on the project changes too much. But you’re right, 
if a whole lot of unexpected costs happen or your team 
members figure out a cheaper and better way to get the job 
done, then an EAC forecast could be way off!

It turns out that there are over 25 different ways to calculate 
EAC, and the one in this chapter is just one of them. Some 
of those other formulas take risks and predictions into 
account. But for the PMP exam, you just need to know 
EAC = BAC ÷ CPI.
Q: Wow, there are a lot of earned value formulas! Is 
there an easy way to remember them? 
A: Yes, there are a few ways that help you remember 
the earned value formulas. One way is to notice that the 
performance Reporting formulas all have something either 
being divided into or subtracted from EV. This should make 
sense—the whole point of earned value management is 
that you’re trying to figure out how much of the value you’re 
delivering to your sponsor has been earned so far. Also, 
remember that a variance is always subtraction, and an 
index is always division. The schedule formulas SV and SPI 
both involve PV numbers you got from your schedule, while 
the cost formulas CV and CPI both involve AC numbers 
from your budget.

And remember, the lower the index or variance, the worse 
your project is doing! A negative variance or an index that’s 
below 1 is bad, while a positive variance or an index that’s 
above 1 is good!
The earned value formulas 
have numbers divided into 
or subtracted from EV.
SV and SPI use PV, while 
CV and CPI use AC.

To-complete performance index (TCPI)
This number represents a target that your CPI would 
have to hit in order to hit your forecasted completion 
cost. If you’re performing within your budgeted cost, 
it’ll be based on your BAC. If you’re running over your 
budget, you’ll have to estimate a new EAC and base your 
TCPI on that.

There are two different formulas for TCPI. One is 
for when you’re trying to get your project within your 
original budget, and the other is for when you are 
trying to get your project done within the EAC you’ve 
determined from earned value calculations.  
(BAC-EV)

BAC based:
Keep your project on track with TCPI
You can use earned value to gauge where you need to be to get your project in 
under budget. TCPI can help you find out not just whether or not you’re on 
target, but exactly where you need to be to make sure you get things done with 
the money you have.
Alice figured out the BAC and EAC for the bar project and realized that the lounge was over budget, so 
she did a TCPI calculation to figure out exactly where needed to keep her CPI if she wanted to get the 
project in without blowing the budget. Alice’s earned value calculations have put the lounge renovation 
project’s numbers here:
EAC= $11,507 		
 AC= $5,750 	
	
BAC=$10,000 	 	
EV=$5000
The project is over budget! So Alice uses the BAC-based formula to figure out where she needs to keep 
the CPI for the project if she wants to complete it within the original budget. Here’s the calculation:
(BAC-AC)
(BAC-EV)

So, if the project were going to get back on budget, it would have to run at a 1.17 CPI for the rest 
of the project to make up for the initial overage. Alice doesn’t think that’s going to happen. Jeff and 
Charles pushed for stucco in the lounge that cost an extra $750 in the beginning, and, the way things 
are going, it’s probably a safe bet that there will be a few more cost overruns like that as the project 
goes on. She prepared a second TCPI to see what the numbers would be to complete the project 
based on the current EAC.

A high TCPI means a tight budget
When you’re looking at the TCPI for a project, a higher 
number means it’s time to take a stricter cost management 
approach. The higher the number, the more you’re going to 
have to rein in spending on your project and cut costs. When 
the number is lower than one, you know you’re well within 
your budget and you can relax a bit.

Party time!
Jeff and Charles finished the new Lounge! It looks great, and 
they’re really happy about it…because Alice managed their 
costs well. She used earned value to correct their budget 
problems, and they managed to cut a few costs while they still 
had time. And they had just enough money left over at the 
end to throw a great party for her!
Thanks, 
Alice! You really 
saved our skins on 
this project!
Since she used earned value to stay on top of the budget 
throughout the project, Jeff and Charles were able to 
renovate the Lounge in style and still manage to stay within 
their spending limits.

Each week of the project costs the same: your team members are paid a total of $4,000 every week, and you 
need $1,000 worth of parts each week to do the work. If the project is scheduled to last 16 weeks, what’s 
the BAC for the project?

Meanwhile, back in the Lounge, Alice is working out if the project’s 
coming in on schedule and on budget. Here are the steps she’s taking 
and her notes. She was called away, so it’s up to you to work out 
whether the guys need to push the schedule.
Jeff and Charles have a total budget of $10,000, 
and they’re currently halfway through the schedule.
So their planned value is?
	
PV = $10,000 x 50% = $5,000
Uh-oh! On a closer look, it seems they’ve really only gotten 40% of the 
work done.
EV = $10,000 x 40% = $4,000
Now that you have the EV and PV, you can tell Jeff and Charles if they’re 
getting their money’s worth!

Start with the schedule and budget. Figure out how much work you planned, how 
much the team has done, and the total budget (BAC).
Figure out EV. This is the part that actually takes some thinking! You need to figure 
out what percentage of work the team has actually done. Once you have that, 
multiply it with the BAC to find the earned value.
Now you can calculate SPI and SV. Once you’ve figured out EV and PV, you can do 
the calculations.

You are the project manager at an industrial design firm. You expect to spend a total of $55,000 on your 
current project. Your plan calls for six people working on the project eight hours a day, five days a week, 
for four weeks. According to the schedule, your team should have just finished the third week of the 
project. When you review what the team has done so far, you find that they have completed 50% of the 
work, at a cost of $25,000. Based on this information, calculate the earned value numbers:
The schedule says the team should 
have just finished the third week 
of a four-week project, so the 
planned % complete is 75%.
Get used to seeing negative 
numbers in parentheses 
instead of using a minus sign.
An SPI below 1 means your project’s behind 
schedule. It’s time to think 
about schedule 
compression!
Since CPI is 
below 1 and 
CV is negative, the project is over budget. Cost-cutting is 
definitely a good idea! 
This SPI means that the 
project is ahead of schedule, 
but it’s very close to 1, which 
means the schedule is pretty

392    Chapter 7
You’re a project manager working on a large project scheduled to last for two years. You’ve got six
different teams working on five major functional areas. Some teams are ahead of schedule, and
others are falling behind. That means that you have cost overruns in some areas, but you’ve saved
costs in others—and that’s making it very hard to get an intuitive grasp on whether your project is
over or under budget!
It’s nine months into your project. The total budget for your project is $4,200,000. You’ve spent $1,650,000 so far, and
you’ve got a CPI of .875. Use the earned value management formulas from forecasting to figure out where things 
stand.
You’re starting to get the hang of this 
stuff! These formulas look a little 
intimidating at first, but they’re really 
not that bad once you get used to them.
Since VAC is negative, 
it means that you’ll be 
$600,000 over budget at 
the end of the project.
This VAC means your project 
is $450,000 under budget.
Take a second to think about what these numbers really 
mean. Are you delivering good value to the sponsor?

=    450,000
ETC  =     3,750, 000 –  2,625,000
=    1,125,000
Now it’s six months later, and your project looks very different. You need to work out a new forecast for what your budget 
situation will be like at project completion. You’ve now spent a total of $2,625,000. You look at all of the activities done by 
the team, and you find that the project is 70% complete. Can you come up with a new forecast for your project?
Your project will be over / under budget at completion. 
(Circle one.)

1. You are creating your cost 
baseline. What process are you in?
A.	
Determine Budget
B.	 Control Costs
C.	 Cost Estimating
D.	 Cost Baselining
Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: A
This is really a question about the order of the processes. Determine Budget and Control Costs both use the 
cost baseline, so it has to be created before you get to them. Cost Baselining isn’t a process at all, so you 
should exclude that from the choices right away. The main output of Determine Budget is the cost baseline and 
supporting detail, so that’s the right choice here. 
2. Answer: A
This one is just testing whether or not you know the formula for schedule variance. Just plug the values into the 
SV formula: SV = EV – PV and you get answer A. Watch out for negative numbers, though! Answer B is a trap 
because it’s a positive value. Also, the test will have answers like C that check if you’re using the right formula. If 
you use the SPI formula, that’s the answer you’ll get! You can throw out D right away—you don’t need to do any 
calculation to know that you have enough information to figure out SV!
3. Answer: D
When you’re using the past performance of previous projects to help come up with an estimate, that’s called 
analogous estimation. This is the second time you saw this particular technique—it was also in Chapter 6. So 
there’s a good chance that you’ll get an exam question on it.
4. Answer: A
The formula for SPI is: SPI = EV ÷ PV. So you just have to fill in the numbers that you know, which gets you 1.2 = 
EV ÷ $56,733. Now flip it around. You end up with EV = 1.2 x $56,733, which multiplies out to $68,079.60. 
5. Answer: B
If you see a question asking the opportunity cost of selecting one project over another, the answer is the value 
of the project that was not selected! So even though the answers were all numbers, there’s no math at all in this 
question. 
Watch out for fake 
processes! This isn’t 
a real process name.
Don’t get thrown off by four-letter abbreviations 
like BCWS—some people have different abbreviations 
for PV, EV, and AC. The PMP exam will always give 
you the abbreviations you’re familiar with.
2. You’re working on a project that has an EV of $7,362 and a PV (BCWS) of $8,232. What’s your SV?
Did you notice the red herring in the question? It didn’t matter 
what the projects were about, only how much they cost!

cost management
6. Answer: D
This is one of those questions that gives you a definition and asks you to pick the term that’s being defined. So which 
one is it?
Try using the process of elimination to find the right answer! It can’t be benefit cost ratio, because you aren’t being 
asked to compare the overall cost of the project to anything to figure out what its benefit will be. Depreciation isn’t 
right—that’s about how your project loses value over time, not about its costs. And it’s not net present value, because 
the question didn’t ask you about how much value your project is delivering today. That leaves lifecycle costing.
7. Answer: C
When you see an SPI that’s lower than one, that means your project is behind schedule. But your CPI is above one, 
which means that you’re ahead on your budget! 
8. Answer: C
Use the formula: EV = BAC × actual % complete. 
When you plug the numbers into the formula, 
the right answer pops out!
9. Answer: B
You might not have recognized this as a TCPI problem immediately, but take 
another look at the question. It’s asking you whether or not a project is going 
to come in under budget, and that’s what TCPI is for. Good thing you were 
given all of the values you need to calculate it! The actual % complete is 57%, 
the BAC is $1,500,000, and the AC is $950,000. You can calculate the EV = 
BAC x actual % complete = $1,500,000 x 57% = $855,000. So now you have 
everything you need to calculate TCPI: this means he needs a TCPI of 1.17 in 
order to come in under budget. Since he knows that he can’t get better than 
1.05, he’s likely to blow the budget.

10. Answer: D
Some of these calculation questions can get a little complicated—but that doesn’t mean they’re difficult! 
Just relax—you can do them!
The formula you need to use is: SPI = EV ÷ PV. But what do you use for EV and PV? If you look at 
the question again, you’ll find everything you need to calculate them. First, figure out earned value: 
EV = BAC × actual % complete. But wait! You weren’t given these in the question!
OK, no problem—you just need to think your way through it. The project will cost $52/meter to lay 4 km 
(or 4,000 meters) of cable, which means the total cost of the project will be $52 x 4,000 = $208,000. 
And you can figure out actual % complete too! You’ve laid 1,800 meters so far out of the 4,000 meters 
you’ll lay in total…so that’s 1,800 ÷ 4,000 = 45% complete. All right! Now you know your earned value: 
EV = $208,000 × 45% = $93,600.
So what’s next? You’ve got half of what you need for 
SPI—now you have to figure out PV. The formula 
for it is: PV = BAC × scheduled % complete. So 
how much of the project were you supposed 
to complete by now? You’re 5 weeks into an 
8-week project, so 5 ÷ 8 = 62.5%. Your PV is 
$208,000 × 62.5% = $130,000. Now you’ve 
got everything you need to calculate SPI! 
EV ÷ PV = $93,600 ÷ $130,000 = .72
11. Answer: B
You’ll run into a lot of questions like this where a problem happens, a person has an issue, or the 
project runs into trouble. When this happens, the first thing you do is stop and gather information. And 
that should make sense to you, since you don’t know if this change will really impact cost or not. It may 
seem like a huge change to the programmer, but may not actually cost the project anything. Or it may 
really be huge. So the first thing to do is figure out the impact of the change on the project constraints, 
and that’s what answer B says!
So that question 
was really about 
whether I could 
figure out how to 
calculate EV and PV 
from what I was 
given.
Did you think that this was a red 
herring? It wasn’t—you needed all the 
numbers you were given.

you are here 4    403

12. Answer: B
What formula do you know that has AC and EV? Right, the CPI formula does! Take a look at it: CPI = EV ÷ AC. So 
what happens if AC is bigger than EV? Make up two numbers and plug them in! You get CPI that’s below 1, and you 
know what that means…it means that you’ve blown your budget!
13. Answer: D
This question gave you a definition and is checking to see if you know what it refers to. 
You should take a minute to look at the four possible answers and see if you can think 
of the definition for each of them. It’s definitely worth taking the time to understand what 
each of these formulas and variables represents in real life! It will make the whole exam 
a lot easier.
14. Answer: C
This is a classic red herring question! The money you’ve spent so far is the actual cost. 
It’s a simple definition question, wrapped up in a whole bunch of fluff!
15. Answer: A
When you plug a bunch of values into a formula or computer program, and it generates an estimate, that’s called 
parametric estimation. Parametric estimation often uses some historical data, but that doesn’t mean it’s the same as 
analogous estimation!

16. Answer: C
You’ve been given a net present value (NPV) for each project. NPV means the total value that this project 
is worth to your company! It’s got the costs—including opportunity costs—built in already. So all you 
need to do is select the project with the biggest NPV.
17. Answer: B
The rough order of magnitude estimate is a very preliminary estimate that everyone knows is only within 
an order of magnitude of the actual cost (or –25 to +75%).
18. Answer: A
You should definitely have a pretty good idea of how change control works by now! The change control 
system defines the procedures that you use to carry out the changes. And Control Costs has its own set 
of procedures, which are part of the Perform Integrated Change Control process you learned about in 
Chapter 4.
19. Answer: B
You use the project cost baseline to measure and 
monitor your project’s cost performance. The 
idea behind a baseline is that when a change is 
approved and implemented, the baseline gets 
updated.
20. Answer: C
You should have the hang of this by now! Plug the numbers into the formula (CPI = EV ÷ AC), and it spits 
out the answer. Sometimes the question will give you more numbers 
than you actually need to use—just ignore them like any other red 
herring and only use the ones you need! 
21. Answer: B
If your TCPI is above 1, you need to manage costs aggressively. It 
means that you need to meet your goals without spending as much 
money as you have been for the rest of the project. 
I recognize 
this-a change is requested, 
approved, and implemented, and 
then the baseline is updated. So I’m 
using the Cost Baseline just like 
I used the scope baseline back in 
Chapter 5!

enough information yet to do analogous, parametric, or bottom-up estimates.
The only estimation technique that you can use that early in the project is the rough order of magnitude estimate. That 
kind of estimate is not nearly as accurate as the other kinds of estimate and is used just to give a rough idea of how 
much time and cost will be involved in doing a project.
23. Answer: D
This question may have seemed a little wordy, but it’s really just a question about the definition of TCPI. You’re being 
asked to figure out where you need to keep your project’s CPI in order to meet your budget. And you know it’s the EAC-
based TCPI number, because the question specified that you already gave him a forecast, which means you gave him 
an EAC value already. So now you can calculate the EAC-based TCPI number to figure out where you need to keep 
your CPI for the rest of the project.
By calculating this based on the EAC, 
you show your sponsor just how much 
money he needs to kick in (or less, if 
you’ve got good news!) in order to come 
in under budget.

Getting it right
It’s not enough to make sure you get it done on 
time and under budget.  You need to be sure you make the right 
product to suit your stakeholders’ needs. Quality means making sure that 
you build what you said you would, and that you do it as efficiently as 
you can. That means trying not to make too many mistakes and always 
keeping your project working toward the goal of creating the right product!
I can’t 
remember if I used 
chocolate chips 
or marbles, but 
I guess it’s ok. 
Someone’s sure to 
figure it out before

408    Chapter 8
What is quality?
Everybody “knows” what quality is. But the way the word is used in everyday 
life is a little different than how it is used in project management. You manage 
quality on your project by setting goals and taking measurements. That’s 
why you need to understand the quality levels your stakeholders believe are 
acceptable, and that your project meets those targets…just like it needs to 
meet their budget and schedule goals. 
How can you tell a high-quality product from a low-quality one?

You need more than just tests to figure out quality 
A lot of people confuse quality with testing. When projects run into quality 
problems, some project managers will respond by adding more testers to 
the project to try to find more bugs. But testing is only one part of the story. 
To know your product’s quality, you need to do more than test it:
Scenario 1
Lisa presses the button, but nothing happens.
The Black Box 3000TM
Scenario 2
Lisa presses the button and a voice comes out 
of the box that says, “You pressed the button 
incorrectly.”
Scenario 3
Lisa presses the button and the box heats up to 
628°F. Lisa drops the box and it shatters into 
hundreds of pieces. 
Hmm. I have no 
idea what these 
tests prove!
Lisa, our tester, is testing 
the Black Box 3000TM, but 
she isn’t sure what she’s 
supposed to be testing for.
How does Lisa know which of these boxes is 
working, and which failed her test?

410    Chapter 8
Once you know what the product is supposed to do, 
it’s easy to tell which tests pass and which fail
Testing is all about checking to be sure that the product does what it is 
supposed to do. That means that you need to have a good idea of what it is 
supposed to do to judge its quality. That’s why the most important concept 
in defining quality for the PMP exam is conformance to requirements. 
That just means that your product is only as good as the requirements you 
have written for it.  To say that something is a high-quality product means 
that it fulfills the requirements your team agreed to when you started the 
work. 
Quality is the 
measurement of 
how closely your 
product meets its 
requirements. 
The spec lists all of the 
requirements that must be 
met by the product.
BLACK BOX 3000TM
Specification Manual
The BB3KTM is a heating element for an 
industrial oven.
BB3KTM must heat up to exactly 628°F in 
0.8 seconds.
BB3KTM must have a large, easy-to-press 
button.
Scenario 
#3 was the test that 
passed! The product looks 
like it’s conforming to that 
requirement. But scenarios 
1 and 2 could be defects. I 
don’t see anything about 
them in the spec. 
Now that she knows what she is 
supposed to be testing for, Lisa 
can report on what behavior 
was correct and what wasn’t. 
quality means conformance
That’s why getting the Collect 
Requirements process right is so 
important!

Quality up close
There are a few general ideas about quality that will help you understand 
a little better where the PMP exam is coming from. A lot of work has been 
done on quality engineering in the past 50 years or so that was originally 
focused on manufacturing. Those ideas have been applied to product quality 
over lots of different industries. Here are a few concepts that are important 
for the exam. 
Customer satisfaction is about making sure that the people 
who are paying for the end product are happy with what they get. 
When the team gathers requirements for the specification, they try to 
write down all of the things that the customers want in the product so 
that you know how to make them happy.
Some requirements can be left unstated, too. Those are the ones that 
are implied by the customer’s explicit needs. In the end, if you fulfill all 
of your requirements, your customers should be really satisfied. 
Fitness for use is about making sure that the product you build 
has the best design possible to fit the customer’s needs. Which would 
you choose: a product that’s beautifully designed, well constructed, 
solidly built, and all-around pleasant to look at but does not do what 
you need, or a product that does what you want despite being really 
ugly to look at and a pain in the butt to work with?
You’ll always choose the product that fits your needs, even if it’s 
seriously limited. That’s why it’s important that the product both does 
what it is supposed to do and does it well.
Conformance to requirements is the core of both customer 
satisfaction and fitness for use. Above all, your product needs to 
do what you wrote down in your requirements specification. Your 
requirements should take into account both what will satisfy your 
customer and the best design possible for the job.
In the end, your product’s quality is judged by whether you built what 
you said you would build.
Customer needs should be 
written down as requirements 
before you start to build 
your product. That way, you 
can always plan on building 
the right thing.  
You could pound in a 
nail with a screwdriver, 
but a hammer is more 
fit for the job.
Quality is a measure of 
how well your product 
does what you intend. 
That means conforming 
to both stated and 
implied requirements. 
This idea came from a quality 
theorist named Joseph Juran.
Philip Crosby made this idea 
popular in the early 1980s. It’s 
been really important to quality 
engineering ever since.
Some requirements are just common 
sense—like a product that people hold 
can’t be made from toxic stuff that 
kills you. It might not be stated, but 
it’s definitely a requirement.

412    Chapter 8
It’s easy to mistake a low-grade 
product for a low-quality one.
When people talk about the quality of their 
car or their meal, they are often talking 
about its grade. You can judge something’s 
grade without knowing too much about its 
requirements. But that’s a lot different than 
knowing its quality. 
Quality vs. grade
You can eat a lobster platter for dinner, or you can eat a hot dog. They are 
both types of food, right? But they have very different tastes, looks, feels, and 
most importantly, cost. If you order the lobster in a restaurant, you’ll be 
charged a lot more than if you order a hot dog. But that doesn’t mean the 
lobster is a higher-quality meal. If you’d ordered a salad and got lobster or a 
hot dog instead, you wouldn’t be satisfied.
The lobster is a high-grade meal; the hot 
dog is a low-grade one. But they’re both 
low quality if you actually wanted a salad.
I know quality 
when I see it. Can’t I 
just look at the final 
product and reject it if 
it’s low quality?
high-quality, low-grade
Quality means that something does 
what you needed it to do. Grade 
describes how much people value it. 
Higher-grade stuff typically costs 
more, but just because you pay more 
for something doesn’t mean it does 
what you need it to do.

“An ounce of prevention…”
It’s not enough to go to the dentist to get your cavities filled. You 
need to brush your teeth every day. The same goes with product 
quality. If you focus on preventing mistakes on your project before 
they happen, you are more likely to get the product done on time 
and without spending too much money. 
10% of the Black Boxes have buttons 
that stick when you press them. 
We could hire a lot more inspectors to check to see if each of the 
products has a sticky button and send it for repair…
When it comes to 
defects, prevention 
is always better 
than inspection! 
Or 
we could change the 
design to make the 
button a millimeter 
smaller and 
eliminate the problem 
altogether. 
prevention over inspection
And that’s why you need the three 
Quality Management processes!
There are three processes in the Quality 
Management knowledge area, and they’re all designed 
to make sure that you and your team deliver the 
highest quality product that you can. 
Plan Quality Management is like the 
other planning processes you’ve learned about—
you create a Quality Management plan to 
help guide you and your team through quality 
activities.
Control Quality is the Monitoring and 
Controlling process where you look at each 
deliverable and inspect it for defects.
Perform Quality Assurance is where 
you take a step back and look at how well your 
project fits in with your company’s overall quality 
standards and guidelines.

The focus here is on making sure that no 
more defects happen, rather than on finding 
them.
Catching the bugs after they’ve been 
put in the product is not the most 
efficient way to deal with this problem. 
It will cost more money and take longer.
This is a much better way of dealing with 
the same problem. It focuses on making sure 
the bugs never make it into the software 
rather than finding them and fixing them. 
This one is also focused on finding the 
problems once they’re in the product.

Plan Quality is how you prevent defects
Since prevention is the best way to deal with defects, you need to do a lot of 
planning to make sure that your product is made with as few defects as possible. 
The Plan Quality Management process focuses on taking all of the 
information available to you at the beginning of your project and figuring out 
how you will measure your quality and prevent defects.
Your company should have 
a quality policy that tells 
how it measures quality 
across the organization. 
You should make sure 
your project follows the 
company policy.
Any company or governmental 
rules or regulations on how 
you need to plan quality for 
your project are considered 
enterprise environmental 
factors.
The team will need the 
requirements to plan 
out all of the activities 
they’ll perform to make 
sure the product does 
what it’s supposed to 
do.

How to plan for quality
You need to plan out which activities you’re going to use to measure the quality 
of the product of your project. And you need to be sure that the activities you 
plan are going to pay off in the end. So you’ll need to think about the cost 
of all of the quality-related activities you want to do. Then you’ll need to set 
some guidelines for what you’re going to measure against. Finally, you’ll need 
to design the tests you’re going to run when the product is ready to be tested.
Cost-benefit analysis is looking at how much your quality 
activities will cost versus how much you will gain from doing them. 
The costs are easy to measure; the effort and resources it takes to 
do them are just like any other task on your schedule. Since quality 
activities don’t actually produce a product, though, it is harder for 
people to measure the benefits sometimes. The main benefits are 
less rework, higher productivity and efficiency, and more satisfaction 
from both the team and the customer. 
That makes sense. A team 
that is making a high-quality 
product will be really proud 
of their work. 
Benchmarking means using the results of Plan Quality on other 
projects to set goals for your own. You might find that the last project 
your company did had 20% fewer defects than the one before it. You 
would want to learn from a project like that, and put in practice any 
of the ideas the company used to make such a great improvement. 
Benchmarks can give you some reference points for judging your own 
project before you even get started with the work. 
Design of  experiments is where you apply the scientific method to 
create a set of tests for your project’s deliverables. It’s a statistical method, 
which means you use statistics to analyze the results of your experiments 
to determine how your deliverables best meet the requirements. A lot of 
quality managers use this technique to produce a list of tests that they’ll 
run on the deliverables, so they have data to analyze later.
In the software world, 
this is usually called 
test planning.
Plan Quality tools
Seven basic quality tools are the main methods used for 
measuring quality across your project. You’ll learn more about them 
later in the chapter. 
Meetings are used to figure out how your team will do all of the 
quality-related activities your project requires. The whole team might 
collaborate on the Quality Management plan in these meetings.

Read each of these scenarios and identify which tool or technique is being used.
Cost of  quality is what you get when you add up the cost of all 
of the prevention and inspection activities you are going to do on your 
project. It doesn’t just include the testing. It includes any time spent 
writing standards, reviewing documents, meeting to analyze the root 
causes of defects, doing rework to fix the defects once the team finds 
them—absolutely everything you do to ensure quality on the project. 
Cost of quality can be a good number to 
check whether your project is doing well or 
having trouble. If your company tracks cost 
of quality on all of its projects, you could 
tell if you were spending more or less than 
the others are, so you can get your project 
up to snuff. 
1. You look through your company’s asset library and find that a recent project was able to reduce defects by 20% by 
inserting defect prevention meetings early in the construction phase. You put the same process in your quality plan and 
set the target for shipped defects to be 20% lower than the company average for your project.

and requirements that the product would need to fulfill to be considered accepted into test.

Statistical sampling is when you look at a representative sample 
of something to make decisions.  For example, you might take a look at 
a selection of widgets produced in a factory to figure out which quality 
activities would help you prevent defects in them. 
•	 Brainstorming (which you’ll learn all about in Chapter 11).
•	 Affinity diagrams (which you learned about in Chapter 5).
•	 Force field analysis is how engineers analyze structures to see what forces affect their use.
•	 Nominal group techniques mean brainstorming with small groups, and then working 
with larger groups to review and expand the results.
•	 Matrix diagrams are tables, spreadsheets or pivot tables that help you analyze complex 
relationships.
•	 Prioritization matrices let you analyze multiple issues and prioritize, so you can attack the 
important ones first.

The Quality Management plan gives you 
what you need to manage quality
Once you have your Quality Management plan, you know your 
guidelines for managing quality on your project. Your strategies for 
monitoring your project quality should be included in the plan, as well 
as the reasons for all of the steps you are taking. It’s important that 
everyone on the team understands the rationale behind the metrics 
being used to judge success or failure of the project.  
Even though 
this number is 
part of Time 
Management, you’ll 
often measure it 
in your Quality 
Management 
plan because it’s 
part of customer 
satisfaction on 
the project.

plan is the main tool for 
preventing defects on 
your project.

A metric is just

Quality checklists are there to help people head off mistakes that 
might cause defects. You can create checklists to avoid common errors as 
part of your Plan Quality process and then put them to use throughout your 
project as a defect prevention technique. Checklists can also be used for 
inspecting products to be sure that they display specific characteristics. 
The Process Improvement plan is a plan for improving the process 
you are using to do the work. In it, you come up with strategies for finding 
inefficiencies and places where the way you work might be slowing you down 
or creating a low-quality product. You set goals for how you can monitor the 
process during your project, and make recommendations to make it better.  
Quality metrics are the kinds of measurements you’ll take throughout 
your project to figure out its quality. If you’re running a project to install 
windows in a skyscraper, and 15% of them have to be reinstalled because 
they were broken, that’s an important metric. You’ll probably want to work 
with your company to bring that number down.
Here’s where you document how you’ll be figuring out the product’s quality. 
You need to write down the formulas you’ll use, when you will do the 
measurements, why you are taking them, and how you will interpret them. 
Project document updates might need to be made because you 
have found new information in the course of planning your quality activities 
that affects one of the other plans you’ve already made. That’s why this 
process includes an output for making those kinds of changes. 
Outputs
This means you need 
to think about more 
than just building 
the product of the 
project. You also need 
to think about how 
your company does all 
of its projects.

might need to be

422    Chapter 8
Q:  Why do you need to track the cost 
of testing?
A:   You mean cost of quality, right? 
Cost of quality isn’t just the cost of testing. 
It’s the cost of all of your quality activities. 
Even preventive activities like spending time 
writing checklists and standards are part of 
it. The reason you track cost of quality is that 
it can tell you a lot about the health of your 
project as a whole.

Say you find you’re spending twice as much 
on quality activities as you are on building 
your product. You need to use that number 
to start asking some questions about the 
way the work is being done.

Are people not doing enough up front to 
prevent defects, and adding a lot of expensive 
test activities at the end of the project to 
compensate? Is the design not clear, so your 
team needs to do a lot of rework trying to get 
what the customer needs? There are many 
reasons that could be causing a high cost-of-
quality number, but you wouldn’t even know to 
ask about them if you didn’t track it. 
Q: How do you know your 
benchmarks before you start building?
A: That’s what your organizational 
process assets are for. Since your company 
keeps a record of all of the projects that 
have been done over the years, those 
projects’ quality measurements can help you 
get a gauge on how your project will perform 
too. If your company knows that all of the 
projects in your division had a cost of quality 
that was 40% of the cost of the overall cost 
of development, you might set 40% cost 
of quality as a benchmark for your project 
as well. Your company might have stated a 
goal of having a schedule variance of plus or 
minus 10% on all projects for this calendar 
year. In that case, the schedule variance is a 
benchmark for your project.




Q: I don’t really have good 
requirements for my projects because 
everyone on the team starts out with just 
a good idea of what we’re building. How 
do I handle quality?
A: You should never do that. Remember 
how you spent all that time collecting 
requirements in the Collect Requirements 
process? Well, this is why you needed them. 
And it’s why it’s your responsibility to make 
sure that the project starts out with good, 
well-defined, and correct requirements. If 
you don’t have them, you can’t measure 
quality—and quality is an important part of 
project management.

Without requirements, you have no idea 
what the product is supposed to do, and 
that means you can’t judge its quality. You 
can learn a lot about a product by testing 
it, but without knowing its requirements, a 
product could pass all of its tests and still not 
do what the customer expects it to do. So 
having good requirements really is the only 
way to know whether or not your product is 
high quality.

Inspect your deliverables
It’s not enough to inspect the final product. You must look at all of the things that 
you make throughout a project to find bugs. In fact, the earlier you find them, the 
easier they are to fix. The Control Quality process is all about inspecting work 
products to find defects. 
How would you use your checklists and metrics to 
inspect all of the deliverables and find defects?

Control Quality is in the Monitoring and Controlling process 
group. Like Control Scope and Control Costs, you look at the work 
performance information that is coming from your project and 
compare it to your plan. If there are problems, you recommend 
a change. That way, you can either fix the problem or make 
sure that it doesn’t happen again.

Use the planning outputs for 
Control Quality
You’ve come up with a plan to make sure each 
deliverable is right. Now it’s time to monitor the work 
that’s being done to the requirements—and that’s just 
a matter of following your plan! You’ll need to look 
at everything that is being produced and make sure 
that it stands up to all of the requirements that have 
been gathered. And you’ll need nearly everything you 
produced in Plan Quality Management in order to get 
a handle on your product’s quality. 
Metrics tell what and how you are 
going to measure your product’s 
quality. They give you some 
objective measures to help you 
make better judgments about it.
The Quality Management 
plan describes your 
approach to inspection—
what you’ll track and 
what you’re shooting for.
Metrics make it easy 
for you to check how 
well your product 
meets expectations. 
You’ll use checklists to help 
you remember all of the

The seven basic tools of quality
Control charts are a way of visualizing how processes 
are doing over time. Let’s say that the button on each Black 
Box needs to be between 7.5 and 9.5 millimeters tall, and the 
chart above represents sample height measurements of boxes 
being made. We want the boxes to all be between 7.5mm and 
9.5mm. The lower control limit of the chart is 7.5mm, and 
the upper control limit is 9.5mm. The chart above shows 
control limits as dashed lines. The mean is the solid line 
in the middle, and it shows the average height of all of the 
buttons in the sample. By looking at the chart above, you can 
see that there are a lot of buttons that were taller than 9.5mm 
manufactured and only one that was shorter than 7.5mm.  
When a data point falls outside of the control limits, we say 
that data point is out of control, and when this happens we 
say that the entire process is out of control.
It’s pretty normal to have your data fluctuate from sample to 
sample. But when seven data points in a row fall on one side 
of the mean, that’s an uncommon enough occurrence that 
it means your process might have a problem. So when you see 
this, you need to look into it and try to figure out what’s going 
on. That’s called the rule of seven, and you’ll definitely see 
questions about it on the PMP exam.
These points are showing the 
Rule of Seven AND that this 
process is out of control.
There are three lines on a control 
chart. The first one is the upper 
control limit.
Cause and effect diagrams are also 
called fishbone and Ishikawa diagrams. 
They are used to figure out what caused a defect. 
You list all of the categories of the defects that 
you have identified and then write the possible 
causes of the defect you are analyzing from each 
category.
Fishbone diagrams help you see all of the 
possible causes in one place so you can think 
of how you might prevent the defect in the future.

they have a name. They’re called the seven basic tools of

Pareto charts, flowcharts, and histograms
Pareto charts help you to figure out which 
problems need your attention right away. They’re 
based on the idea that a large number of problems 
are caused by a small number of causes. In fact, that’s 
called the 80/20 rule—80% of the defects are 
usually caused by 20% of the causes. Pareto charts 
plot out the frequency of defects and sort them in 
descending order. The right axis on the chart shows 
the cumulative percentage. For the example here, the 
most defects are caused by scope issues. So improving 
the way projects are scoped would be the best way to 
prevent defects in upcoming projects.

Flowcharts let you show how 
processes work visually. You can use 
a flowchart to show how the tasks in 
your project interrelate and what they 
depend on. They are also good for 
showing decision-making processes.
The example on the left shows a high-
level view of a software development 
process. First, the high-level scope is 
decided, then the requirements, and 
then the design. After design there 
is a decision to be made: does the 
design pass a review? If yes, then 
move on to the build phase; if no, 
there’s still some design work to do. 
After the build process, the product 
needs to pass its unit tests to make it 
into the test phase. 
The flowchart helps you to see how 
all of the phases relate to each other. 
Sometimes the way you are working is 
responsible for defects in your product. 
Flowcharts help you get a handle on 
the way you are working by showing 
you a picture of the whole process.

Histograms give you a good idea 
of how your data breaks down. If 
you heard that your product had 158 
defects, you might think that they 
were all critical. So looking at a chart 
like the one above would help you 
to get some perspective on the data. 
A lot of the bugs are low priority. It 
looks like only 28 or so are critical. 
Histograms are great for helping you 
to compare characteristics of data 
and make more informed decisions. 
This product probably isn’t 
ready to ship—it still has a 
lot of bugs. But at least you 
know that the bugs aren’t all 
critical!
Don’t call this a “bar

The seven basic tools are all about charting 
defects. Why do you think that would be 
useful in Control Quality?
Checksheets allow you to collect data on the product 
under test. Checksheets are sometimes called checklists or tally 
sheets.  You can use them to organize the test activities you’ll 
be performing and track whether the product passes or fails 
tests.  Checksheets are often used as a means of gathering the 
data that’s displayed in Pareto diagrams or other trending and 
charting tools in the seven basic tools of quality.
Scatter diagrams show how two different types of data 
relate to each other. If you worked with your test team to create 
a bunch of new tests, you might use a scatter diagram to see 
if the new test cases had any impact on the number of defects 
you found. The chart here shows that as more test cases pass, 
fewer defects are found.

Inspection is what you’re doing when 
you look at the deliverables and see if they 
conform to requirements. It’s important to 
remember that you don’t just inspect the 
final product. You also look at all of the 
deliverables that are made along the way. 
Statistical sampling helps you 
make decisions about your product without 
looking at each and every thing you make. 
Lisa is responsible for the quality of the 
Black Box 3000TM, but there’s no way she 
can inspect each one as it comes off the 
assembly line. It makes sense for her to take 
a sample of the products and inspect those. 
From that sample she can learn enough 
about the project to make good judgments. 
Approved change request review 
is when you inspect a repaired defect to be 
sure that it is actually fixed.
It’s not enough to 
fix defects. You need 
to be sure that they 
don’t cause more 
damage once they’re 
fixed.

Question Clinic: The “which-one” question
You’ll see a lot of 
questions on the exam 
that describe a situation and ask 
you to identify the tool, technique, 
or process that’s being used or is 
most appropriate. Luckily, process of 
elimination is really useful when you 
see a “which-one” question.
When you think about it, 
all questions are “which-one” 
questions…but when the question 
asks to choose one item from a list 
of four really similar or related 
things, then that’s when you really 
get to work your way backward 
and start eliminating them one at a 
time.
This can’t be right—it’s not 
even a tool! It’s just a rule.

Quality control means finding and correcting defects
When you look for bugs in your deliverables, you produce two kinds of 
things: outputs from the inspections and outputs from the repairs you’ve 
made. All of the outputs of the Control Quality process fall into 
those two categories. 
Quality control measurements are all of the results of your 
inspections: the numbers of defects you’ve found, numbers of tests 
that passed or failed—stuff like that. You’ll use them when you look 
at the overall process you are using in your company to see if there 
are trends across projects. 
That’s coming up 
in the Quality 
Assurance process. 
That’s next!
Lessons learned updates are where you keep a record 
of all of the major problems that you solve in the course of your 
project so that you can use them later.

Completed checklists are records of quality activities that 
are performed through the course of the project and their results. 
It’s a good idea to keep records of the results of reviews and quality

When you’ve finished 
inspecting your product, 
you know whether or 
not your fixes worked. 
Change requests are recommended or preventive actions that 
also require changes to the way you are doing your project. Those 
kinds of changes will need to be put through change control, 
and the appropriate baselines and plans will need to be updated if 
they are approved. 
Validated defect 
repair
Verified deliverables and validated changes are 
two of the most important outputs of Control Quality. Every single 
deliverable on the project needs to be inspected to make sure it meets 
your quality standards. If you find defects, the team needs to fix 
them—and then those repairs need to be checked, to make sure the 
defects are now gone.
Deliverables
First the team 
inspects every 
deliverable to find 
defects that need 
to be fixed.
Project document updates might need to be made. You 
might discover that your company’s quality standards need to be 
updated, because something you thought was a defect might not be 
a defect after all!
Work performance 
information
Work performance information  might include all of the 
data your quality processes are producing.  Once you’ve looked at 
the results of your quality tools, you might find places where the 
processes you’re using to build your product need to be changed.  
The data you collect in the Control Quality process can help you 
make those kinds of changes. 

436    Chapter 8
Q:  What exactly are Pareto charts for?
A:  Pareto charts go together with the 
80/20 rule. It says that 80 percent of the 
problems you’ll encounter in your project 
are caused by 20 percent of the root causes 
you can find. So if you find that most of your 
problems come from misunderstanding 
requirements, changing the way you 
gather requirements and making sure that 
everybody understands them earlier in 
the process will have a big impact on your 
project’s quality.

To get the data for your Pareto chart, first 
you have to categorize all of the defects 
that have been found in your project by 
their root causes. Then you can graph them 
in a Pareto chart to show the frequency of 
bugs found with each root cause and the 
percentage of the cumulative defects that 
are caused by each root cause. The one with 
the highest frequency is the root cause that 
you should work on first.
Q: If I am trying to prevent quality 
problems, why can’t I just test more?
A: You can find a lot of problems by 
testing. If you find them during testing, then 
you have to go back and fix them. The later 
you find them, the more expensive they are 
to fix. It’s much better for everybody if you 
never put the bugs in the product in the first 
place. It’s much easier to fix a problem in a 
specification document than it is to fix it in 
a finished product. That’s why most of the 
Plan Quality Management process group 
is centered on setting standards and doing 
reviews to be sure that bugs are never put 
into your product and, if they are, they’re 
caught as early as possible.
Q: I still don’t get that thing where a 
control chart can show you defects that 
are out of control, but also show you that 
your process is out of control.
A: The reason that’s a little confusing to 
some people is that you use the same tool 
to look at defects that you do when you’re 
looking at the whole process. 

A lot of the time, you’ll use charts to measure 
processes, not just projects. They’re used 
to look at sample data from processes and 
make sure that they operate within limits 
over time. But they are considered quality 
control tools because those data samples 
come from inspecting deliverables as they 
are produced. Yes, it’s a little confusing, but 
if you think of control charts as the product 
of inspection, you’ll remember that they are 
Control Quality tools for the test. 

Inspection means checking each deliverable for 
defects. That means checking your specs and your 
documentation, as well as your product, for bugs.

The better you plan the quality activities for your project, 
the less inspection you need. 

Ishikawa diagrams help you to pinpoint the causes of 
defects.

The rule of seven means that any time you have seven 
data points in a row that fall on the same side of the 
mean on a control chart, you need to figure out why.

When data points fall above the upper limit or below 
the lower limit on a control chart, the process is out of 
control.

For the test, using any of the seven basic quality tools 
is usually a good indication that you are in the Control 
Quality process. 

Ishikawa, fishbone, and cause-and-effect diagrams 
are all the same thing. 

Scatter charts help you look at the relationship 
between two different kinds of data.

Flowcharts help you get a handle on how processes 
work by showing all of the decision points graphically. 

Grade refers to the value of a product, but not its 
quality. So, a product can be low-grade by design, and 
that’s fine. But if it’s a low-quality product, that’s a big 
problem.

It’s not enough to inspect your deliverables. Sometimes it’s the way you work 
that’s causing your problems. That’s why you need to spend some time thinking 
about how you will make sure you are doing the work efficiently and with as

Introducing Quality Assurance
In the Perform Quality Assurance process, you take all 
of the outputs from Plan Quality Management and Control 
Quality and look at them to see if you can find ways to improve 
your process. If you find improvements, you recommend 
changes to your process and your individual project plan to 
implement them. 
Quality control 
measurements
You’ll use the outputs of the other quality 
processes and information about how the work 
is being performed to find ways to improve 
the way your company operates.
Plan Quality Management tools and techniques are all of the 
tools you used in Plan Quality. They come in handy when you’re reviewing your 
process, too. 
Control Quality tools and techniques are all of the tools from 
Control Quality. You can use histograms, control charts, and flowcharts—all of 
them can be used to help you figure out how your process is working. 
Quality audits are reviews of your project by your company. They figure 
out whether or not you are following the company’s process. 
Process analysis is when you look at your process to find out how to make 
it better. You use your Process Improvement plan to do this one.

A closer look at some tools and techniques
How would you use these tools to manage your project?
Quality audits are when your company reviews your 
project to see if you are following its processes. The point is 
to figure out if there are ways to help you be more effective 
by finding the stuff you are doing on your project that 
is inefficient or that causes defects. When you find those 
problem areas, you recommend corrective actions to fix 
them.  
Process analysis means following your Process 
Improvement plan to compare your project’s process data 
to goals that have been set for your company. If you find 
that the process itself needs to change, you recommend 
those changes to the company and sometimes update the 
organizational process assets as well as your own Project 
Management plan to include your recommendations. 
Fixing the bugs in your project solves the problems that give you trouble. 
But fixing bugs in your process means that other projects can learn from 
the problems you’ve faced and avoid your project’s bugs altogether. The 
tools that are used in quality assurance are the same as the ones in quality 
control, but they’re used to examine the process rather than the project.  
When Lisa noticed that the 
warehouse was full of Black Box 
parts that weren’t needed yet, 
she was really noticing a problem 
with the process. Why spend 
money on overstocked inventory? 
Even if your company has the 
best process in the world, it 
doesn’t do your project any 
good if you don’t follow it!. 
A lot of companies have Quality 
Assurance departments whose 
job is to perform these audits 
and report findings from 
projects to a process group. 
Quality management and control tools are the 
same ones you already know about from earlier in this chapter. 
But instead of using them to look for problems with specific 
defects, you’ll use them to look at your overall process. A good 
example of this is using a control chart to see if your whole 
process is in control. If it’s not, then you’ll want to make a 
change to the whole way you do your work in order to bring it 
under control.
Here’s another example. If you created 
a Pareto chart that showed all of the 
defects in all of your projects, you 
could find the one or two categories of 
defects that caused problems for the 
whole company. Then you could get all 
of the PMs together to figure out an 
improvement that they could all make 
that would help the whole company.

Kaizen means continuous improvement. It’s 
all about constantly looking at the way you do 
your work and trying to make it better. Kaizen 
is a Japanese word that means improvement. 
It focuses on making small improvements and 
measuring their impact. Kaizen is a philosophy 
that guides management, rather than a particular 
way of doing quality assurance.
Just-in-Time means keeping only the inventory 
you need on hand when you need it. So, instead of 
keeping a big inventory of parts sitting around, 
the Black Box company might have only the 
parts it needs for that day. Some companies have 
done away with warehouses all together and 
have production lines take the parts directly off 
the trucks to do the work. If you’re working in 
a Just-in-Time shop, quality is really important 
because there isn’t any extra inventory to 
deal with mistakes. 
Plan-Do-Check-Act is one way to go about improving 
your process, and it’s used by a lot of Kaizen practitioners. 
It was popularized by a well-known quality theorist named 
W. Edwards Deming and is also known as the Deming Cycle. 
Plan-Do-Check-Act is about making small improvements, and 
measuring how much benefit they make before you change your 
process to include them. Here’s how it works:
improve your process
You’re right. The Perform Quality Assurance process is all about 
improving the process, and that isn’t what most of project management is about. 
But your project is really affected by the process you are working in, so you should fully 
understand it and help to make it better wherever you can. The bottom line is that your 
project has a better chance of succeeding if you stay involved with process improvement 
and keep your eye on how your project stacks up to your company’s expectations of quality 
and process. 
Wait a minute! In the 
beginning of the book, you said 
that projects were temporary. 
This stuff is all about 
processes! What gives?
More ideas behind quality assurance
There are a couple more things you need to know about 
quality assurance. These are some of the most important 
ideas behind modern quality and process improvement.
Plan-Do-Check-Act was created by 
Walter Shewhart, who also created 
the control chart while he was 
working at Bell Labs in the 1920s.

442    Chapter 8
Tonight’s talk: Two quality processes discuss the best 
ways to correct problems on your project.
Control Quality:
I’d like to go first, because I’m what most people think 
of as quality. Whenever you see one of those “Inspected 
by #8” stickers on the inside of your sneaker, that’s me!



Whoa, there, buddy. That’s a strong statement!




That’s right. And don’t forget, I’m everywhere. Any 
time you call for customer service, I’m there to tell you 
that your call will be recorded for quality purposes. I’m 
always warning you to make sure package contents 
haven’t shifted, and to check your car’s emissions once 
a year.


I guess I don’t really understand exactly how you do 
your job, then, because I’m having a hard time figuring 
out how I would ever be able to take a long weekend.


Well, last week it was because the company logo came 
out upside down on a bunch of the shoes. It turned out 
that the logo was being stitched into the leather and 
then put on another assembly line, and once in a while 
it was placed on the belt upside-down.
Perform Quality Assurance:



You’re right—most people do think that quality begins 
and ends with inspection. Which is funny, because we 
wouldn’t even need you if people paid attention to me.
Now don’t get me wrong. Nobody’s ever felt 
comfortable enough with me that they’ve eliminated 
inspection entirely. You always need someone at the end 
of the line to look at what’s been produced and make 
sure that we delivered what we meant to.





Right, but don’t you get tired of doing all of that 
tedious work? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound 
of cure, after all.



Let’s take a look at those sneakers you mentioned. 
What’s the most common reason you throw a pair back 
to the factory floor to be restitched?
control versus assurance

you are here 4    443
quality management
Control Quality:

We had to throw out about 10% of our sneakers last 
week. Let’s just say that the boss wasn’t happy. You 
could see the little veins in his forehead throbbing. It 
was kind of gross. 

The boss yelled at everyone, and we’ll check even more 
carefully to make sure we don’t ship it.


Wow, I never thought of that.


We’d have to pay someone else to paint that on. This is 
no time to be increasing our costs!





Huh. Um. No.
Perform Quality Assurance:
That seems like an honest mistake. How much did it 
cost?



Wow, that sounds expensive. What’s keeping it from 
happening again?

So next week your inspection costs will be even higher, 
and you’ll probably still have to throw out just as many 
shoes, or more!
What if you painted a little arrow on the inside of the 
leather showing which direction the logo should be 
placed on the belt?

But a small increase in the cost of painting the leather 
will cause you to throw out a whole lot fewer sneakers.
I call that cost of quality. You have to pay more to 
put quality in at the beginning, but you can reduce the 
number of inspectors and scrap a lot less product. In 
the end, I save you far more money that I cost. Can you 
say the same about yourself?

1. You use a Pareto chart to figure out which root causes are responsible

at the start of every shift to be sure that the machine is always set 
properly.

The Black Box 3000TM makes record profits!
Thanks to Quality Management, 
the Black Box 3000TM is always 
high quality.
People who bought the product were thrilled with it. They were happy that the Black Box company 
always kept its promises and the products were always high quality. The company managed to save a lot 
of money by implementing process improvement measures that caught defects before they cost too much 
money to fix. And Lisa got a big promotion—now she’s in charge of quality assurance for the whole 
company. Great job, Lisa!
Since the company focused 
on preventing defects, it was 
able to find and fix problems 
efficiently and didn’t need to 
hire lots of testers. 
The company cut down on 
extra inventory by using 
Just-in-Time processes to 
track and forecast how 
much it would need. Just in 
Time means no parts sitting 
around anymore!
The number of inspectors 
the company needed went 
down as the quality got 
better and better.

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: C
It’s important for projects to produce a valuable product, but value isn’t really a part of quality. That’s why 
earned value is part of Cost Management, not Quality Management.
2. Answer: B
In the Control Quality process, the team inspects the product for defects and uses the seven basic tools to 
analyze them. Since the defects came from inspection, you know it’s Control Quality.
3. Answer: B
Cost of quality is the time and money that you spend to prevent, find, or repair defects.
4. Answer: C
The Perform Quality Assurance process is all about how well your company meets its overall quality goals.
5. Answer: A
A manufacturer that uses Just-in-Time management is relying on its suppliers to deliver parts exactly when 
they’re needed. This saves costs, because it doesn’t have to warehouse a lot of spare parts.
6. Answer: D
Your project team needs to inspect ALL of the deliverables! That means every single thing that gets produced 
needs to be reviewed by team members, so they can find and repair defects.
7. Answer: B
A Pareto chart divides your defects into categories, and shows you the percentage of the total defects each of 
those categories represents. It’s really useful when you have a limited budget for Plan Quality Management 
and want to spend it where it’s most effective!
But those parts had better not have a lot of 
defects, because there aren’t a lot of spare 
parts lying around to do repairs! 
Don’t forget that ALL deliverables need to be 
inspected, including the stuff you create—like 
the schedule, WBS, and Project Management plan. 
So you’ll get defects for them, too!

 Don’t assume that just because 
you’re using a fishbone diagram, 
you’re always doing quality control! 
It’s also used in Risk Management; you’ll see 
that in Chapter 11. The key thing to watch for 
here is that the fishbone diagram is being used to find the 
root cause of a DEFECT, not a risk or something else.

8. Answer: C
Keep your eye out for questions 
asking you about Ishikawa or 
fishbone diagrams. When you use 
those tools to analyze defects, 
you’re in the Control Quality 
process.
OK, so I can use a 
run chart to figure 
out whether quality 
is getting better or 
worse over the course 
of my project.
11. Answer: D
A lot of people get Control Quality and Verify Scope confused because they seem really similar. Both 
of them involve looking closely at deliverables to make sure that they meet requirements. But they 
serve really different purposes! You use Control Quality to find defects that you’re going to repair. Verify 
Scope happens at the very end of the Executing phase; it’s when you work with the stakeholder to get 
formal acceptance for the deliverables.
12. Answer: B
Benchmarking is when you use previous projects to set quality guidelines for your current project. You 
can always find the results of the past projects in the organizational process assets.
You’d better have found all the 
defects before you take the 
product to the customer!
9. Answer: B
A run chart is one of the seven 
basic tools of quality. It’s a long 
line graph that shows you the 
total number of defects that were 
found over time.
10. Answer: B
Inspection is when your team examines something that they produced for 
defects…and every single deliverable needs to be inspected! That’s what 
“prevention over inspection” means: if you produce a deliverable that’s 
needed later in the project today, it’s a lot cheaper to fix defects in it now 
than it will be when that deliverable is used later on in the project.

456    Chapter 8
Exam Questions
Answers
13. Answer: A
The rule of seven tells you that when seven consecutive data points on your control chart come out on the 
same side of the mean, you’ve got a process problem. That sounds a little complicated, but it’s actually 
pretty straightforward. Defects tend to be scattered around pretty randomly; in any project that makes a lot 
of parts, even if they’re all within the specification, you’ll get a couple of parts that are a little bigger, and a 
couple that are a little smaller. But if you have a bunch of them in a row that all run a little big, that’s a good 
indication that something’s gone wrong on your assembly line!
14. Answer: C
Going back and repairing defects can be a pretty risky activity, because it’s really easy to introduce new 
defects or not fully understand why the defect happened in the first place. Answer C says exactly that: you 
go back and review the defects to make sure they’re fixed.
15. Answer: D
A lot of times it’s impractical to check every single product that rolls off of your assembly line. Statistical 
sampling is a great tool for that; that’s when you pull out a small, random sample of the products and 
inspect each of them. If they’re all correct, then there’s a very good chance that your whole product is 
acceptable!
16. Answer: C
A lot of people get confused about the difference between Control Quality and Perform Quality Assurance. 
Control Quality is where you inspect deliverables for defects, while Quality Assurance is where you audit 
the project to make sure the quality activities were performed properly.
You inspect products for defects, and you can 
remember that because you’ll find an “inspected 
by #8” tag in a product. You audit processes, 
and you can remember that because when you 
get audited, they’re making sure you did your 
taxes correctly—they’re auditing your actions, 
not a product.

your project in order to look for quality problems and inefficiencies.
18. Answer: B
You’re analyzing the process, so you are using Perform Quality Assurance.
19. Answer: D
Pareto charts are based on the 80/20 rule. They sort your defects in descending order by root cause.  
So you always know which 20% of root causes are responsible for 80% of defects on your project.

Getting the team together
Behind every successful project is a great team.  So how do you 
make sure that you get—and keep—the best possible team for your project? You need to 
plan carefully, set up a good working environment, and negotiate for the best people 
you can find. But it’s not enough to put a good team together…if you want your project to 
go well, you’ve got to keep the team motivated and deal with any conflicts that happen 
along the way. Human resource management gives you the tools you need to get the 
best team for the job and lead them through a successful project.
OK, on three…

Hey, we’re all on the same

we have people from our teams 
just help out whenever you need 
someone?
Brian: Yeah, there’s no reason you need our resources 
dedicated to your project. We can get multiple projects done 
that way.
Mike: Come on, guys. You don’t really think that’s gonna work, 
do you?
Amy: Sure, why not?
Mike: We can’t just staff up as we go; that’s going to cause huge 
problems.
Brian: You’re overreacting, Mike. Look, I’m a team player, 
and I want to get the project done. You just tell me when you 
need someone off my team, and I’ll make sure you’ve got the 
developers and testers you need. What’s wrong with that?
Mike: OK, so what if I need three developers starting 
tomorrow for the next two weeks? Can you do that?
Brian: Well, no, I’ve got a deadline on Friday. It’ll have to wait 
until next Monday. But that’s just a couple of days.
Mike: See, that’s what I’m talking about! A few days here, a few

Get your team together and keep them moving
You want to stay in control of your project team, right? But when you work 
in a matrix organization, your team members don’t directly report to you. So 
how do you make sure you get the best people, and keep them motivated 
and productive? That’s what the four processes in Human Resource 
Management are for: guiding you through all the things you need to do to 
make sure you get everyone for your project when you need them.
This shouldn’t be a surprise—every 
knowledge area has its planning 
process, and Plan Human Resource 
Management is no exception.
This is where you plan out 
the staffing needs for your 
project, and how you’ll 
manage and reward the 
team.
In the Plan Human 
Resource Management 
process, you plan 
out exactly which 
resources you’ll need, 
what their roles 
and responsibilities 
are, and how you’ll 
train your team and 
make sure they stay 
motivated.

What can you do to make sure that you get the right people for your team exactly when you 
need them? What can you do before the project starts to make sure they stay motivated?
It makes sense that Acquire Project 
Team and Develop Project Team are 
in the Executing group—you only 
put the team together AFTER the 
project has started.
Once the project gets started, 
you need to put together your 
team. This means you may 
need to negotiate for some of 
the resources.
You’ll need to train your team, 
and keep them motivated with 
rewards in order to get the 
project done.
No project goes perfectly. 
People have conflicts, and 
it’s up to you to make sure 
they get resolved.
All three of these 
processes are part of

Figure out who you need on your team
Project teams don’t just assemble themselves spontaneously! It takes 
a lot of planning and guidance to get a team together, and that’s the 
idea behind the Plan Human Resource Management process. 
Remember, in a matrix organization your team doesn’t report directly 
to the project manager. You need to work with the functional managers 
to get the team members that you need for your project…which means 
there’s a lot of information that you need to give to everyone so they 
know exactly who you need for your team.
The Human Resource 
Management plan tells 
everyone on the project who 
you’ll need on your team, when 
you need them, and what skills 
they’ll need.
You’ve seen these two 
inputs a whole bunch 
of times now!
This is a lot like 
the other planning 
processes you’ve

Your Staffing Management plan describes who will 
be on your project, when they’ll do the work and 
for how long, and the reward system you’ll use to 
keep the team motivated.
Every role on the project needs to be defined—it has a title, has authority to 
do certain things, and is responsible for specific deliverables.
This is a lot like the org 
chart for your whole 
company, except that 
it lists only the specific 
people on the project.

Hold on-how can organization charts 
be both tools and techniques and 
outputs?
You need two charts because 
you have two “organizations.”
One organization is the whole 
company—along with any 
subcontractors or consultants you’ve 
got access to for your project team. The 
other organization is just the people who 
are on the team. The team might have 
people from different groups in your 
company, and they need to know how 
they interact. That’s why you create a 
chart just for the team.
Some people will bring in a consultant or expert 
to manage or lead part of the team. Make sure 
the project’s org chart shows that relationship, 
even if it’s not part of the company!
The project organization chart 
shows how your team members 
relate with one another.
This might include people or relationships 
that may not necessarily show up on a 
company organization chart. If you’ve got 
a team built from multiple consultants and 
subcontractors, this chart will be the only 
place where everyone is listed at once.
Roles and responsibilities show who’s 
responsible for what.
It’s really common to see the roles and responsibilities for a 
project written out as a RACI matrix, which is just a table that 
lists the role or people on the top; the specific activities, work, or 
responsibilities down the side; and the level of responsibility that 
each person or role has for each of the activities or responsibilities. 
(RACI stands for “Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and 
Informed.”)
This could also list roles, like Project 
Manager, Creative Director, or 
Development Manager.

The Staffing Management plan
An important component of the Human Resource 
Management plan is the Staffing Management plan. 
It tells you everything that you need in order to build your 
team, keep them motivated, and manage them to resolve 
conflicts and get the work done.
Everything you do with 
your team—acquiring them, 
developing them, and managing 
them—depends on a good 
Staffing Management plan.
The resource histogram tells 
you the type and number of 
resources you need at any time. 
It’s usually a vertical bar chart.
This is really important for 
telling the functional managers 
exactly who you’ll need on your 
team, so they can provide the 
staff that you need to get 
the job done.
You need to make sure everyone 
on the team has the skills he or 
she needs to do the job.
A really important part of 
Human Resource Management 
is keeping your team motivated, 
and rewards tied to goals are 
a great way to do that.
You’ll need to plan out exactly 
how your team members will 
roll off of your project so 
functional managers and other 
project managers will know if 
they’re available for 
other projects.

A common way of showing the 
timetable—or when people will work on 
what—is to use a resource histogram.

Read the Staffing Management plan on the facing page and answer these questions about the 
project.
1. How many designers, developers, and testers are needed in week #7 of the project?
	
	
 designers	
	
developers	
	
testers
2. Who is responsible for verifying that each team member has the skills appropriate to the project?
3. Rewards should always be tied to performance goals in order to motivate the team. What 
performance goal has been set for the team, and what reward will each team member
receive if it’s achieved?
Q:  I still don’t get the resource 
histogram. Am I supposed to make this 
myself, or does it come from somewhere?
A: You need to come up with the 
histogram yourself when you put together 
the Staffing Management plan. Since you’re 
managing the project, you’re the only one 
who knows when each person is needed on 
the project. Remember all of the activities 
that you came up with, back when you were 
building the schedule in the Chapter 6? 
Well, each of those activities had resource 
requirements, right? That means you know 
exactly what resources you’ll need at any 
time in your project! That’s why the activity 
resource requirements are an input to Plan 
Human Resource Management—you need 
the schedule and the activities in order to 
figure out the timetable. The histogram is the 
easiest way to show that information.
Q: Is that RACI chart really necessary?
A: Yes, definitely! Sometimes people 
split up responsibilities in ways that aren’t 
immediately obvious just from people’s 
titles or the names of their roles on the 
project—that’s one of the big advantages 
of a matrix organization. RACI charts help 
everyone figure out their assignments. Mike 
might have Brian’s senior developers sit in 
on Amy’s design meetings, even though they 
don’t usually do that. He’d put that in the 
RACI matrix to show everyone that’s now 
part of their jobs for the project.
Q: Once I know what roles need to be 
filled on my project, how do I actually get 
the team on board?
A: That’s what the next process is all 
about! It’s called Acquire Project Team, 
and it’s where you actually staff your project. 
Of course, you don’t staff it during the 
planning phase. You have to wait until the 
project work begins, which is why it’s in the 
Executing process group.

The hardest part about staffing your project 
is negotiating with the functional managers. 
The best resources are the ones that are in 
demand, which means your negotiating skills 
will be very important when it comes time to 
staff your project team.
Answers on page 496.

470    Chapter 9
Take a minute and 
think about why you 
need each of these 
inputs.
Acquisition means going outside 
of your company to contractors and 
consultants to staff your team.
Virtual teams are when your team 
members don’t all work in the same 
location. This is really useful when you’re 
relying on consultants and contractors for 
outsourced work. Instead of meeting in 
person, they’ll use phone, email, instant 
messaging, and online collaboration tools 
to work together.
Don’t be thrown by the word “acquisition”—
even though this is the Acquire Project 
Team process, this particular technique only 
refers to acquiring resources from outside.
Get the team together
Negotiation is the most important tool 
in this process. There are resources that 
you need for your project, but they don’t 
report to you. So you need to negotiate 
with the functional managers—and 
maybe even other project managers—for 
their time.
Preassignment is when you can 
actually build the assignments into your 
Staffing Management plan. Sometimes 
you have resources who are guaranteed 
to you when you start the project, so you 
don’t need to negotiate for them.
There aren’t any 
surprises here—if 
you’ve staffed 
a project team, 
you’ve done all of 
these things.
gather the team
Inputs
Your Human Resource Management plan is in place, your project is 
ready to roll, and now it’s time to begin the actual project work! You 
need your team, and the way you bring them on board is the Acquire 
Project Team process.
This is where you negotiate with functional managers for your project 
team members. You need the right people for the project, and you’ve 
done all the prep work to figure out who you need and when you need 
them. So now it’s time to go get your team!
Beware of  the 
halo effect!
That’s when you 
put someone in 
a position they 
can’t handle, just because 
they’re good at another job.
Multicriteria decision analysis 
means looking at a bunch of factors when 
deciding on who should be part of your 
project team. Sometimes teams will use 
tools that help them weigh factors like cost, 
skills, knowledge, and availability when 
deciding on project team needs.

Develop your project team
The Develop Project Team process is the most important one in Human 
Resource Management. It’s the one where you make sure your team is 
motivated and well managed—and those are some of the most important 
things that project managers do! You do it throughout the entire Executing 
phase of the project, because you need to keep your team moving toward the 
goal.
You develop your project team by keeping them motivated, 
and you do this all the way through your entire project.
Motivation
Get the team involved in planning—the 
more they feel like they’re in control, 
the better they feel about the project!
This makes it more 
challenging to stay on top 
of the team and make sure 
the work is getting done.
This is one of the tools and 
techniques for Develop Project Team.

Develop the team with your management skills
How do you keep your team motivated and up and running? With the 
tools and techniques for Develop Project Team, that’s how. When 
you’re working with your team, you need to be a leader. That means 
setting the rules for how people interact with one another, making sure 
they have the skills they need, setting up a good working environment, 
and keeping them motivated.
The inputs to Develop 
Project Team are the 
outputs you just created.
Ground rules help you 
prevent problems between 
team members, and let you 
establish working conditions 
that everyone on the team 
can live with.
Training is a really important part 
of developing your team. If you’ve 
got a team member who doesn’t 
have the skills to do the job, you 
need to get him trained…and it’s 
up to you to plan enough of the 
project’s time and budget to make 
sure it happens!
Colocation is the opposite of 
virtual teams. When you have 
all of your team located in the 
same room, you can increase 
communication and help them 
build a sense of community. 
Sometimes that room is called a 
war room.
Recognition and 
rewards are the best way 
to keep your team motivated!
Discussing ground 
rules with the team 
can be really valuable, 
because it helps 
everyone see what’s 
important to their 
teammates!

476    Chapter 9
let’s get interpersonal
Your interpersonal skills can make a big 
difference for your team 
Knowing all of the tools and techniques in the PMBOK Guide will help you 
learn a lot about your project, but the way you help your team to get the job 
done is just as important as the steps you take to get it done.  
Leadership is all about giving the team a goal to shoot for and helping them to see the 
value in the work they are doing. It’s not enough to have a team know the end product that 
they’re building; they need to understand the value that that product is going to 
bring to the company. A project manager needs to constantly remind the team of the 
vision they’re working toward, and make decisions to help keep the team on track toward it. 
Team building involves helping your team learn to depend on and trust one 
another. As a project manager, you’re responsible for helping the team come to an 
understanding about how they’ll communicate and stay motivated when things 
go wrong. If you’re open about your decision-making processes and communicate 
often about what you’re doing, you can help your team to bond. Some people 
think of team building as going out for pizzas after work, but it’s more about how 
you lead, and how you help to create an environment where your team members 
can trust one another. 
Motivation demonstrates to your team the value that the project has for them.  It 
includes making sure that people are compensated and rewarded financially for their work. 
But that’s not the only facet of team motivation that you need to be concerned with. Your 
team also needs to know how the tasks they’re doing contribute to project success, and 
what’s in it for them. Motivating your team is about helping them to be satisfied with 
the job they’re doing, recognizing them when they do a good job, and keeping them 
challenged with new and different problems. 
Communication is a constant concern when you’re leading a team. It’s not enough to 
make the best decisions to get your project done; you’ve got to make sure that everybody 
in the team knows why you’re making them, and feels like you’re being open and honest 
about what’s motivating every decision you make. If the people on your team feel like

dark, they’ll be able to trust you and one another more.  
The team was happy to work on 
CGW III from the beginning. But 
when Mike told them that the 
company saw the game’s success 
as responsible for 70% of their 
revenue, it really showed them how 
important the work was. 
When Mike agreed to consolidate the code reviews for two features into 
one review, he forgot to tell the team about it. When the first code review 
was cancelled, the team was confused. They thought Mike didn’t care about 
the quality of the product they were making, and the misunderstanding was 
really hard on them.

human resource management
Influencing is all about using your relationships with the people on 
your team to get them to cooperate in making good decisions for the 
project. When you lead by example, you show your team how you want 
them to behave by doing it. It may seem subtle, but the way you work 
as a project manager can set the standard for your teammates.  
Collaborating with your team on the best way of working through your 
project is a really effective way of making sure that the team members 
gel, and know that they can rely on one another.  
Decision making is how you handle the issues that come up when you’re working 
through your project. There are a few basic techniques for decision making that you’ll use:
	
Command: Sometimes you’ll just make a decision and inform your team 	
	
	
about it. You’ll decide, and then team will do what you say.
	
Consultation: Sometimes you’ll talk your decision over with your team and ask 	
	
for their opinions before you decide. 
	
Consensus: Another way of making decisions is to talk about a few options 	
	
	
with your team and get everybody to agree on one of them before you decide. 
	
Coin flip: Another way to make a decision is to just randomly choose one of 	
	
	
the options.  
Political and cultural awareness means knowing the people 
on your team and understanding their backgrounds. Since projects 
sometimes span more than one culture, it’s important to take the time 
to understand the similarities and differences in the working 
environments across the project team. It’s equally important to 
communicate with your team members and understand what motivates 
them. 
Negotiation helps the people on your team come to an 
agreement about how to work together. It’s important when you’re 
negotiating to listen to both parties and to make sure that you 
make it clear when concessions are made.  That should 
get everyone to see both sides of the issue and know that you’re 
negotiating a fair resolution to it. 
Mike made sure he came to work 
early as often as he could. After a 
while he noticed that everybody on 
the team was doing the same thing. 
Trust building, coaching, and conflict 
management are also important in managing the 
interpersonal dynamics on your team.  You’ll remember trust 
building and coaching from Chapter 1.  We’ll talk about conflict 
management in just a minute.

leadership and power
Lead the team with your management skills
You’ve seen tools and techniques that help you set up a great environment 
for your team to succeed, but you need more than that to get
them through a tough project. You need leadership skills,
those “soft skills” you use to influence your team and keep
them directed toward the project’s goals.
Wait a second! How 
can a multiple-choice 
test quiz me on my 
leadership skills?
You’re right, it can’t. What the PMP exam can quiz you 
on is your knowledge of leadership skills. There’s been a lot of 
research on how people wield power in companies. The PMP 
exam concentrates on research done by two social psychology 
researchers named French and Raven who came up with five 
different kinds of power that people use to influence others.
The five kinds of power
There are five kinds of power that a project manager typically uses 
on a project. The first is called legitimate power, which is what 
you use when you assign work to someone who reports to you. 
When you’re someone’s boss, you have legitimate 
power to tell them what to do. But when you 
work in a matrix organization, you don’t have 
direct reports! So you’ll need to use the other 
kinds of power to influence your team.
Expert power means that the team 
respects you for your expertise in a 
specific area, and gives you credibility 
because of that. Think about it: a 
team of programmers is more likely 
to respect you and do what you ask 
them to do if they know that you’re an 
accomplished software engineer!
Reward power is what you have when you 
can award a bonus or another kind of reward in 
order to motivate team members. Always make 
sure that rewards are fair—you don’t want 
to single out one person who is eligible for a 
reward without giving others a chance at it! And 
rewards work best when they’re tied to specific 
goals or project priorities.
Everyone on 
the team will get an 
extra $500 bonus if 
we meet all of the 
quality standards in 
the spec!
I spent a few 
years leading a 
game design team, 
and I got the best 
results when we 
held joint design 
meetings with the 
programmers.
Reward and expert power 
are the most effective 
kinds of power that a 
project manager can use.
Making everyone compete 
for one single reward 
isn’t fair—it’s actually 
demotivating to force 
people to compete for 
an arbitrary prize.
You use leadership skills 
throughout the entire project! 
But they’re most important in 
Develop Project Team because 
that’s where you lead your 
team through their work.

human resource management
Match each form of power to the scenario where it’s being used.
“We’re not meeting our quality standards, and until we 
do we’re going to have to work weekends.”
Legitimate power
Reward power
Expert power
Referent power
Punishment power
A functional manager assigns a tester to work on the 
project manager’s team.
A project manager sets up an “Accolade Wall” and posts 
awards for team members who come in ahead of schedule.
Everyone always does what Shelly says because 
everyone knows that senior management loves her. 
The programmers always listen to the team lead 
because he’s a really good software architect.
Punishment power is exactly what it 
sounds like—you correct a team member for 
poor behavior. Always remember to do 
this one-on-one and in private! Punishing 
someone in front of peers or superiors is extremely 
embarrassing, and will be really counterproductive.
Referent power means that people admire 
you, are loyal to you, and want to do what you 
do because you’re part of the cool crowd. Often, 
a project manager might wield referent power 
because he’s trusted by people in authority, and 
others perceive him as associated with success.  
Look, Joe, I know 
you’re trying your 
best, but if you can’t 
meet the delivery 
deadline, I’m going 
to have to take you 
off the team.
Could you imagine if 
someone said that to you 
in front of your boss?
If you buy something because 
a celebrity does, that’s 
referent power.

Motivate your team
No matter how good your soft skills are, if your team has a lousy work 
environment, they’re going to have a hard time getting the project done. 
Luckily, there’s been research done over the years to figure out exactly what 
makes a good working environment. For the PMP exam, you’ll be expected to 
be familiar with the most popular theories of motivation and organization.
This stuff is all part of recognition 
and rewards—one of the tools and 
techniques for Develop Project Team.
Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory
Sure, you love being a project manager. But would 
you do the job if you weren’t getting a paycheck? 
Of course not!
What Herzberg figured out was that you need 
things like good working conditions, 
a satisfying personal life, and 
good relations with your boss 
and coworkers—stuff he called 
“hygiene factors.” They don’t 
motivate you, but you need them 
before you can be motivated. Until 
you have them, you don’t really 
care about “motivation factors” like 
achievement, recognition, personal 
growth, or career advancement.
Maslow’s Hierarchy of  Needs says that 
people have needs, and until the lower ones are satisfied 
they won’t even begin to think about the higher ones.
You might see this in a question about “Maslow’s 
theory,” or it might show up on the exam as 
“Hierarchy of Needs” or “Maslow’s Hierarchy.”
Maslow says you can’t 
achieve the higher needs 
until you’re comfortable 
with the lower ones…
A “hygiene factor” is something like 
a paycheck or status—stuff that 
people need in order to do the job. 
If people don’t have this stuff, it’s 
really hard to motivate them!
McGregor’s Theory X and Theory Y 
McGregor tells us that there are two kinds of 
managers: ones who assume that everyone on 
the team is selfish and unmotivated, and ones 
who trust their team to do a good job. He calls 
the kind of manager who distrusts the team a 
“Theory X” manager, and the kind who trusts 
them a “Theory Y” manager. You could get 
exam questions where the answer could 
be “Theory X” or “Theory Y”—or both!
A Theory X manager will micromanage the 
team, looking over everyone’s shoulder all 
the time and making them feel like they 
aren’t trusted.
It’s much better—and easier—to 
be a Theory Y manager. If you 
trust the team to do their jobs, 
they won’t let you down!
Herzberg says that people need 
the stuff they normally expect out 
of a job—like hot coffee—before 
you can get them motivated about 
achievement and personal growth.

Each of the following scenarios demonstrates one of the motivational theories at work.
Write down which theory each scenario describes.
Expectancy Theory says that you need to give 
people an expectation of a reward in order to motivate 
them—but this works only if that award is achievable. 
If everyone knows the award is either worthless or 
impossible to achieve, it will actually demotivate them!
McClelland’s Achievement Theory says that 
people need  to be motivated. Achievement is when 
someone performs well and is recognized for it. Power 
means he or she has a lot of control or influence in the 
company. And someone feels a strong sense of affiliation 
from being a part of a working team and having good 
relationships with coworkers.
Two more theories that might appear on 
the PMP exam—although they’re not 
nearly as common as the others.
Answers on page 498.
1. Bob is a programmer on the team, but he doesn’t 
really feel like he’s “one of the guys.” He doesn’t 
really have a lot of control over the work he’s 
assigned. Recently, Bob put in a long weekend to 
get his work done, but nobody really seemed to 
take notice.
2. There was a break-in at the office, and now people 
are really jittery. Plus, the heating system has been 
broken for weeks, and it’s freezing! No wonder 
nobody’s getting any work done.
3. Eric’s a functional manager, but his team seems 
to move really slowly. It turns out that everyone 
who reports to him has to hand him their work first, 
before they can give it to anyone else. He goes 
through it line by line, which sometimes takes 
hours! He doesn’t trust his team to release anything 
he hasn’t seen.
4. Joe’s a functional manager, and his team is very 
efficient. He spot-checks their work, but for the 
most part he sets realistic performance goals and 
trusts them to meet it—he only pulls people aside if 
he finds that there’s a specific problem that has to 
be corrected.
 5. A project manager is having a lot of trouble 
motivating the team. He tries setting up rewards 
and a good working environment. But the team 
remains difficult to motivate—mostly because their 
paychecks all bounced last week, and everyone is 
angry at the CEO because they didn’t get bonuses.

the real last stage is blaming
Stages of team development
Forming: People are still trying to figure out their roles in the 
group; they tend to work independently, but are trying to get 
along. 
Storming: As the team learns more about the project, 
members form opinions about how the work should be done. 
This can lead to temper flare-ups in the beginning, when people 
disagree about how to approach the project. 
Norming: As the team learns more about the other members, 
they begin to adjust their own work habits to help out one 
another and the team as a whole. Here’s where the individuals 
on the team start learning to trust one another. 
Performing: Once everyone understands the problem and 
what the others are capable of doing, they start acting as a 
cohesive unit and being efficient.  Now the team is working like 
a well-oiled machine.
Adjourning: When the work is close to completion, the team 
starts dealing with the fact that the project is going to be closing 
soon. 
Researcher Bruce 
Tuckman came up 
with these five 
stages as a model 
for team decision 
making.
How does knowing the five stages of team development change the decisions that you’ll 
make in handling conflicts on your team?
There’s a process for a team to get from a group of strangers 
to a group that creates something good together, and that’s 
what the stages of team development are all about. 
Every team goes through these stages during a project.
Although this is the normal progression, it’s possible that the team can get stuck in any 
one of the stages.  One big contribution you can make, as the project manager, is to help 
the team get through the initial Storming phase, and into Norming and Performing.  It’s 
important to keep in mind that people have a tough time creating team bonds initially, and 
to try to use your soft skills to help the team to progress through the stages quickly.

Each of the following scenarios demonstrates one of the stages of team development.
Write down which stage each scenario describes.
1. Joe and Tom are both programmers on the Global Contracting project. They disagree on the overall 
architecture for the software they’re building, and frequently get into shouting matches over it. Joe thinks 
Tom’s design is too short-sighted and can’t be reused. Tom thinks Joe’s design is too complicated and 
probably won’t work. They’re at a point right now where they’re barely talking to each other. 

                  
2. Joan and Bob are great at handling the constant scope changes on the Business Intelligence project. 
Whenever the stakeholders request changes, they shepherd them through the change control process and 
make sure the team doesn’t get bothered with them unless it’s absolutely necessary. That leaves Darrel and 
Roger to focus on building the main product. Everybody is focusing on their area and doing a great job. It 
seems like it’s all just clicking for the group.

                  
3. Derek just got to the team, and he’s really reserved. Folks on the team aren’t quite sure what to make of him.  
Eveybody’s polite, but it seems like some people are a little threatened by him. 

                  
4. Now that the product has shipped, the team is meeting to document all of their lessons learned and write up 
project evaluations.

                  
 5. Danny just realized that Janet is really good at developing web services. He’s starting to think of ways to 
make sure that she gets all of the web service development work and Doug gets all of the client software 
work. Doug seems really happy about this too—he seems to really enjoy building Windows applications.

Conflict management up close
It’s probably no surprise that over half of conflicts come from priorities, schedules, 
and people. That’s why so many of the processes you’re learning about are 
focused on preventing conflicts. Ground rules, good planning practices, and 
pretty much anything that has to do with communication are all there to prevent 
the most common reasons that conflicts happen.
Some of the common reasons that conflicts happen
Resources are scarce—that’s why you have to negotiate for 
them. Have you ever been in a situation where there’s a “good” 
conference room, or top-performing team member,  or even that 
photocopy machine that always seems to be in use? Well, that’s a 
scarce resource. No wonder resources cause so many conflicts.
Priorities mean one project or person is more important 
than another, and gets more budget, resources, time, prestige, 
or other perks. If the company’s priorities aren’t crystal clear, 
then conflicts are definitely going to happen.
Schedules decide who gets what, when. Have you ever 
had a client, sponsor, or stakeholder get upset because your 
project won’t come in as early as he or she wanted it to? 
Then you’ve had a conflict over schedules.
These three things are 
the source of over 50% 
of all conflicts!
Personalities are always 
clashing. Sometimes two 
people just don’t get along, 
and you’re going to have to 
find a way to make them work 
together in order to get your 
project done.
Cost disagreements seem to 
come up a lot, especially where 
contracts are involved. Even 
when the price is agreed upon 
up front, buyer’s remorse will 
set in, and it will lead to issues.
Technical opinions are 
definitely a reason that conflicts 
happen, because it’s really hard 
to get an expert to change his 
mind…so when two of them 
disagree, watch out!
Some more sources of conflict
Over half of all 
conflicts are caused 
by resources, priorities, 
and schedules.
What’s the best way to deal with a conflict between two people on your project team?

488    Chapter 9
How to resolve a conflict
When you’re managing a project, you depend on people to get 
the work done. But when they have any sort of conflict, your 
project can grind to a halt…and you’re the one who has to 
face the music when it causes delays and costs money! Since 
you’re on the hook when a conflict threatens your project, 
you’re the one who has to resolve it. Luckily, there are 
some techniques for getting your conflicts resolved. 
Confronting—or problem solving—is the 
most effective way to resolve a conflict. 
When you confront the source of the conflict head-on 
and work with everyone to find a solution that actually 
fixes the reason that conflicts happen, then the problem 
is most likely to go away and never come back!
Compromise sounds good, doesn’t it? 
But hold on a second—when two people 
compromise, it means that each person gives 
up something. That’s why a lot of people call 
a compromise a “lose-lose” solution.
Ok, let’s 
see if we can 
get to the 
bottom of this.
Look, each of you is 
going to have to give 
up something if we 
want to get back on 
track.
The first thing you do whenever you 
face a problem is do your research 
and gather all the information so you 
can make an informed decision.
You should always try to confront the problem first—you 
should forge a compromise only after you’ve tried every 
possible way to solve the real problem.
The best way to resolve a 
conflict is to confront the 
problem: do your research, 
figure out what’s behind it, 
and fix the root cause.
keeping everyone together
Collaborating means working with other 
people to make sure that their viewpoints and 
perspectives are taken into account. It’s a great 
way to get a real commitment from everyone.
Amy came up 
with a good idea, 
and Brian expanded 
on it. It sounds like 
we’ve got a real plan 
here!

Forcing means putting your foot down and 
making a decision. One person wins, one 
person loses, and that’s the end of that.
I’m in charge 
here, and I’ve 
made my decision…
and you’re just 
gonna have to live 
with it.
Smoothing is what you’re doing when you try to 
play down the problem and make it seem like it’s not so 
bad. It’s a temporary solution, but sometimes you need 
to do it to keep tempers from flaring and give people 
some space to step back and really figure out what’s 
going on.
Withdrawal doesn’t do much good for 
anyone. It’s when people get so frustrated, angry, 
or disgusted that they just walk away from the 
argument. It’s almost always counterproductive. 
If someone withdraws from a problem before it’s 
resolved, it won’t go away—and your project will 
suffer.
Come on, guys. I 
know this seems 
like the end of the 
world, but it’s really 
not such a big deal.
You 
guys are 
being totally 
unreasonable, 
and we’re just 
not going to talk 
about it anymore.
Who’s really being 
unreasonable here?
You should really try 
to avoid forcing and 
withdrawal if you can.

490    Chapter 9
confront the problem
But confronting 
sounds like a bad 
thing! Shouldn’t I avoid 
confrontation?
No! Confrontation is just another 
name for problem solving, because 
you solve a problem by confronting it head-on, 
doing your research, and fixing whatever is 
causing it. If you always remember to:
Confront the problem
…it will really help you through a bunch of 
questions on the exam!
“Confronting” is another way 
of saying “problem solving.” Any 
time two people have a conflict, 
you need to step back and figure 
out what’s actually causing 
the problem. That’s how you 
“confront” it—by finding and 
fixing the underlying issue!

no dumb questions
Q: How do I know what form of power to use?
A: You should always try to use expert power or reward power if 
you can. Expert power is effective because people naturally follow 
leadership from someone they respect. And reward power is also 
good because rewards help people motivate themselves.

When you use referent power, you’re appealing to a really important 
psychological tool: the fact that when you like someone or she likes 
you, you’re much more likely to influence her. And when you use 
punishment, you have to be very careful because it can be highly 
demotivating to the team. When you use it, always be careful not 
to punish someone in front of the team or other managers in your 
company. That can be embarrassing for the person, and just makes 
you look vindictive. Remember, your goal is to get your project back 
on track, not to put someone in his place!
Q: It sounds like compromise is a bad thing. But I’ve been 
told that when people are fighting, I should always look for a 
middle ground!
A: Yes, as little kids a lot of us were told that we should always 
look for a compromise. And that probably is the right thing to do on 
the playground. But when you’re managing a project, you’re judged 
by the success of your final product, not by how happy your team is. 
When you forge a compromise instead of really figuring out what’s 
causing the problem, you’re usually taking the easy way out.
Q: I’m still not quite clear about all of that storming and 
norming stuff. Do I need to know that to run a project?
A: Yes, you do! When Bruce Tuckman published his pioneering 
research about group development in 1965, he was looking for a 
model to describe how teams face their challenges, tackle their 
problems, find solutions to those problems, and deliver results. Since 
then, it’s become the foundation for a lot of modern thinking about 
how teams form and work. More importantly, if you learn to recognize 
how teams evolve over the course of a project, it will actually help 
you in real life when you run your projects. If you understand how 
group dynamics work, you’ll have a much better idea of what’s 
causing conflicts and problems on your team, and you can help 
everyone work through those problems. Sometimes knowing that 
groups go through these patterns helps you keep perspective...and 
realize that it’s normal—even healthy!—to have conflicts every now 
and then.
Try to avoid using punishment. 
When you do have to punish 
someone, make sure to do it in 
private, and not in front of 
peers or other managers.

Resources, schedules, and priorities cause 50% of 
project problems and conflicts. Personality conflicts are 
actually the least likely cause.

The best way to solve a problem is to confront it, which 
means doing your research, figuring out what’s causing 
the problem, and fixing it.

Withdrawal happens when someone gives up and 
walks away from the problem, usually because he’s 
frustrated or disgusted. If you see a team member doing 
this, it’s a warning sign that something’s wrong. 

Don’t be fooled by questions that make it sound like 
“confronting” is a bad thing. Confronting is just 
another word for problem solving.

Smoothing is minimizing the problem, and it can help 
cool people off while you figure out how to solve it.

You should compromise only if you can’t confront the 
problem.

Forcing means making a decision by simply picking one 
side. It’s a really ineffective way to solve problems.

The Cows Gone Wild IV team ROCKS!
The odds were against Mike—he had to fight for a whole new 
team, keep them motivated, and solve some pretty serious 
problems. But he followed his plan, got a great team together, 
kept them on track, and got the product out the door!
Phew! 
that was a 
whole lot of 
work, but we got 
a great product 
out the door!
Mike made sure 
everyone had a great 
working environment….
…he set up rewards 
that kept the team 
motivated...
…there were conflicts and 
arguments, but he confronted 
each of them and got the 
project back on track…
…and the team built 
the best Cows Gone

198. Three people on your project team are having conflicts about 
priorities. A junior team member wants to do the activities out of 
order, while two senior members want to follow the schedule that 
you had originally put together. What’s the first step in resolving 
this conflict?
A.	 Tell everyone to work out the problem among themselves.
B.	 Tell the junior member that you should always follow the 
schedule.
C.	 Tell them to keep to the original schedule.
D.	 Meet with all three people and get all the information.
Sounds like these guys 
are right, and the 
other person is wrong… 
right? Well, maybe not.
Never push off your management 
responsibilities on the team.
You shouldn’t make a 
unilateral decision without 
understanding the conflict.
This is the right answer. 
Get all the facts before 
you make any move.
That’s not true! What if the 
schedule has a problem and needs 
change control? The junior team 
member could be right.
Don’t be fooled—even though 
this asks about conflict, that 
doesn’t mean it’s asking you 
for a conflict resolution 
technique.
Question Clinic: The “have-a-meeting” question
There are a whole lot of questions on 
the exam that give you a situation where 
there’s a conflict, an issue, or even a crisis, and ask 
you what to do first. The trick is that in all of these 
cases, one of the options is to have a meeting. Sounds 
odd, right? But this is actually really important for a 
project manager to know! That’s because you need to 
gather information from other people before you 
make a decision.
Remember how you always 
look at the impact of a 
change before you decide 
whether or not to make it? 
Well, this is the same idea! 
You always want to look at 
all the facts before you 
make a move.
It’s not always team members who 
have conflicts. You could have an 
unhappy client who has a complaint 
about you or your team members… 
and that client could be right.

1. Bob is a programmer on the team, but he doesn’t 
really feel like he’s “one of the guys.” He doesn’t 
really have a lot of control over the work he’s 
assigned. Recently, Bob put in a long weekend to 
get his work done, but nobody really seemed to 
take notice.
2. There was a break-in at the office, and now people 
are really jittery. Plus, the heating system has been 
broken for weeks, and it’s freezing! No wonder 
nobody’s getting any work done.
3. Eric’s a functional manager, but his team seems 
to move really slowly. It turns out that everyone 
who reports to him has to hand him their work first, 
before they can give it to anyone else. He goes 
through it line by line, which sometimes takes 
hours! He doesn’t trust his team to release anything 
he hasn’t seen.
4. Joe’s a functional manager, and his team is very 
efficient. He spot-checks their work, but for the 
most part he sets realistic performance goals and 
trusts them to meet them—he only pulls people 
aside if he finds that there’s a specific problem that 
has to be corrected.
5. A project manager is having a lot of trouble 
motivating the team. He tries setting up rewards 
and a good working environment. But the team 
remains difficult to motivate—mostly because their 
paychecks all bounced last week, and everyone is 
angry at the CEO because they didn’t get bonuses.

Each of the following scenarios demonstrates one of the stages of team development.
Write down which stage each scenario describes.
1. Joe and Tom are both programmers on the Global Contracting project.  They disagree on the overall 
architecture for the software they’re building, and frequently get into shouting matches over it. Joe thinks 
Tom’s design is too short-sighted and can’t be reused.  Tom thinks Joe’s design is too complicated and 
probably won’t work.  They’re at a point right now where they’re barely talking to each other. 

                  Storming
2. Joan and Bob are great at handling the constant scope changes on the Business Intelligence project. 
Whenever the stakeholders request changes, they shepherd them through the change control process and 
make sure the team doesn’t get bothered with them unless it’s absolutely necessary. That leaves Darrel and 
Roger to focus on building the main product.  Everybody is focusing on their area and doing a great job.  It 
seems like it’s all just clicking for the group.

3. Derek just got to the team, and he’s really reserved.  Folks on the team aren’t quite sure what to make of him.  
Eveybody’s polite, but it seems like some people are a little threatened by him.

make sure that she gets all of the web service development work and Doug gets all of the client software 
work. Doug seems really happy about this too—he seems to really enjoy building Windows applications.

Exam Questions
Answers
1. Answer: B
When you think about how you organize the work on your project, the RACI chart makes sense. Being responsible 
for a specific task or area of work means you’re the one who’s on the hook if it doesn’t get done. Being accountable 
means you might not be doing it directly, but you have influence over it. Some people need to be consulted but don’t get 
involved in the work, while others should just be kept informed of status.
2. Answer: D
The power is here is referent. People are reacting to Tom’s relationship to the president of the company, not his own 
authority.
3. Answer: B
Confronting does sound like it would be negative, but it just means solving the problem. If you actually solve the problem, 
there’s no more reason for people to fight at all. That’s always the best way to deal with a conflict. Any of the other 
options could lead to more problems later.
4. Answer: D
This is a classic “have-a-meeting” question! You should always gather the information you need before you make any 
kind of decision.
5. Answer: C
Joe decided that the best tactic was to refuse to talk to the client anymore—that’s withdrawing. It’s also probably not 
going to solve the problem.
6. Answer: C
You create the histogram as part of the Staffing Management plan. It’s the main output of the Plan Human Resource 
Management process.
7. Answer: B
Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs says that your safety and acceptance are a prerequisite for your being able to do your best.
Did you choose punishment? People might be afraid of punishment from 
the president of the company if they don’t agree with Tom. But since 
Tom isn’t the one who would punish them, it’s referent power.

8. Answer: A
Jim took his ball and went home. 
That’s withdrawal.
9. Answer: A
A micromanager is a Theory X manager. 
Tina believes that all employees need to be 
watched very closely, or they will make mistakes.
10. Answer: C
You definitely need to know what causes conflicts on projects. Resources, technical opinions, 
priorities, and personalities all cause people to have conflicts, and there’s a good chance you’ll get a 
question on that!
11. Answer: B
Just because someone is good at a technical job, it doesn’t mean he will be good at management. 
The jobs require very different skills.
12. Answer: B
You are motivating the work by offering a reward for it. People might be motivated by the bonus to put 
in the extra time even if they would not have been motivated by the deadline alone. 
13. Answer: D
Both of them had to give something up, so that’s a compromise. 
14. Answer: C
War rooms are part of colocation. It’s a way to keep your entire team in one room so they don’t have 
any communication gaps. 
It seems 
like Jim and Sue had 
a confrontation, right? 
But that’s not what 
“confronting” means here! 
It really means problem 
solving.

15. Answer: A
Developing the team is where you evaluate performance and set up motivational factors. Manage 
Project Team is where you solve conflicts.
16. Answer: A
In matrix organizations, team members usually report to their functional managers. A project 
manager never has legitimate power over the team in those situations. 
17. Answer: A
Tom’s project is at the very beginning—he’s using the organization chart as a tool to figure out 
who’s going to be assigned to his team.
18. Answer: D
Expectancy Theory says that people get motivated only by rewards that they can achieve, and that 
are fair. If you set up a reward system that selects people who don’t deserve rewards, or that has 
rewards that are unattainable, then it will backfire and cause people to resent their jobs.
19. Answer: B
Whenever you choose one side over another without thinking or actually finding the root cause of 
the problem, you’re forcing a solution on it. This is not a good way to solve problems!
20. Answer: C
Any time there’s any sort of conflict, the 
first thing you need to do is gather all the 
information. And that’s especially true when 
there’s a disagreement between the client and 
the team! You’d better have your facts straight 
in such a charged situation.
Don’t forget that there are two org 
charts—one for the company, and one 
for the project.
He should 
have sat down with 
both programmers and 
figured out what the 
real problem was. Even 
if the solution isn’t 
perfect, at least it’s 
more fair.

party, his old staticky phone made it hard for everybody to understand what he 
was asking. Sometimes their taste for retro furniture can make things a 
little difficult.
What can Jeff and Charles do to get a handle on 
their communication problems?
Make sure 
you bring the 
good wine!
This phone is old and 
staticky!!
Oops! The caterer 
couldn’t make out 
what Jeff was saying. 
Hi Jeff. This is the 
caterer. We got 
your message. We’ll 
be sure to bring 
pork rinds.

Man, I’ve gotta

and make sure

I wonder if I need to 
contact anyone other than 
the caterer about this? Is 
there something wrong 
with the phone? How can 
we be sure this won’t 
happen again?

Anatomy of communication
When you communicate with your team, you need to encode your message into 
a phone call, a document, an IM chat, or sometimes even a different language for 
them to understand. Your team then decodes that message so they can get its 
content. If something happens to your message along the way (static on the phone 
line, your printer inserts garbage characters, your Internet connection is spotty, 
or your translation isn’t very good), then your team might not get the intended 
message. The kind of interference that can alter your message is called noise. 
The thing that is 
used to transfer 
the call is the 
medium.
Because of the noise 
on Jeff’s line, it’s 
tough for Charles to 
decode the message. 
Charles encodes his 
response as a phone 
call.

olives from

Jeff encodes 
his message as a

When the receiver responds to the 
sender’s message, it’s called feedback.

Get a handle on communication
Any kind of communication can have interference. The wrong person can get 
the message; noise can garble the transmission; you can make mistakes decoding 
or encoding the message. It turns out that 90% of a project manager’s job is 
communication, which is why there’s a whole knowledge area devoted to it. The 
Communications Management processes are here to help you avoid these 
common kinds of errors, through planning and careful tracking of stakeholder 
communications on your project. Just like every other knowledge group we’ve 
covered so far, it all starts with a plan.

out who needs to know what. 
the communications management processes
Manage Communications is in the Executing 
process group, because it happens while the work 
is being done. You need to make sure everybody 
gets the information they need while they’re 
working, so that they’re completely equipped to 
get their jobs done.

Control 
Communications
This is where you turn all of 
that work performance data 
(like how long it actually took 
the team to complete tasks, 
and actual costs of doing 
the work so far) into work 
performance information (like 
forecasted completion dates, 
and budget forecasts) that 
your stakeholders will use to 
stay informed. 
Control Communications is in the Monitoring and 
Controlling process group. You need to constantly 
monitor and always stay in control of all of the 
communication that goes on throughout the project, 
whether it’s to communicate your team’s performance, 
or to keep stakeholders up to date on the project.

the data your project is producing, and control how it is presented to your 
stakeholders.

Communication technology 
has a major impact on how you can keep 
people in the loop. It’s a lot easier for 
people to get information on their projects 
if it’s all accessible through a website 
than it is if all of your information is 
passed around by paper memos. The 
technologies available to you will definitely 
figure into your plan of how you will keep 
everyone notified of project status and 
issues. 
Communication methods are how 
you actually share the information with 
your stakeholders. Communications can be 
interactive, where everyone exchanges 
information with one another. You can push 
information out to your stakeholders by 
sending out emails, memos, faxes, or other 
one-way communications. Or, if you need to 
get a lot of information out to people, they 
can pull it down themselves from intranet 
websites, e-learning courses, or libraries.
Meetings are always great 
for helping your team to think 
about communication.

Get the message?
Communication is about more than just what you write and say. Your facial expressions, 
gestures, tone of voice, and the context you are in have a lot to do with whether or not 
people will understand you. Effective communication takes the way you act and sound 
into account. Most of the communication on your project takes place during the Manage 
Communication process, so you need to know how to communicate effectively. Here are the 
important aspects to effective communication:
Nonverbal communication means your gestures, facial expressions, and 
physical appearance while you are communicating your message. Imagine what Jeff 
and Charles would think of the caterer if he negotiated the contract for their party 
while wearing a chicken suit. They probably wouldn’t take him very seriously. You 
don’t always think about it, but the way you behave can say more than your words 
when you are trying to get your message across. 
Paralingual communication is the tone and pitch of your voice when 
you’re talking to people. If you sound anxious or upset, that will have an impact on 
the way people take the news you are giving. You use paralingual communication 
all the time—it’s a really important part of how you communicate. When your tone 
of voice makes it clear you’re really excited about something, or if you’re speaking 
sarcastically, that’s paralingual communication in action.
Feedback is when you respond to communication. The best way to be sure 
people know you are listening to them is to give lots of feedback. Some ways of 
giving feedback are summarizing their main points back to them, letting them know 
that you agree with them, or asking questions for clarification  When you give a lot 
of feedback to someone who is speaking, that’s called active listening. 
Like effective communication, 
effective listening is about 
taking everything the 
speaker says and does into 
consideration and asking 
questions when you don’t 
understand. 
So it’s not 
enough to say the 
right thing. You 
need to say it the 
right way, too.
more than words
If someone has dread in 
his voice when he tells 
you about a promotion, 
you get a much 
different impression 
than if he’d emailed 
you about it.
You do most of the project communication 
when you’re performing the Manage 
Communications process.
When you’re 
communicating 
with other people, 
you actually do 
more nonverbal 
communication than 
verbal!
That’s why active listening is an 
important part of communication.

More Manage Communications tools
The tools in this process area are all about getting information from your team and making 
sure that the information makes it to the people who need it. You’ll start your project with 
a kickoff meeting to get everyone on the same page, and follow your Communications 
Management plan as your project progresses. As you learn more about your project, you write 
down decisions you make and everything you learn on the project as lessons learned. 
Information management systems are how you get the information your team 
needs to do the job. You might have an inbox where everyone puts their status information. 
If it’s printed out on paper, you’re doing hard copy document distribution. You could 
also use electronic communication. For example, you might use email, or you could 
have a software application that gathers information about your project and saves it to a 
database so that you can make your reports. Or your company might have electronic 
tools for project management, like a timesheet system for tracking hours spent on 
a project or a budgeting system for tracking expenditures. All of those are information 
gathering and retrieval systems, because the data they produce will be used to make 
decisions about your project. 
get the word out
Communication methods are the specific methods you use to distribute 
information to your team…and you’ve already learned about them!
Performance reporting is all about gathering information on how your team is 
progressing through the project.  You might create status reports that show how close 
you are to your baseline schedule and highlight issues that your team has run into along the 
way. You’ll always want to keep everybody informed on how your project is tracking risks, 
any changes that might come up that weren’t planned for, and forecasts of what’s coming up 
next for the team. 
Communication technology is a tool that you use to get the message out.  If 
you need to get a message to someone urgently, it might be hard to wait for a face-to face 
meeting.  You might choose to use email, phone, or a ticketing system to communicate.  
There are a lot of factors that influence your decision to use a particular technology when 
communicating other than urgency, including availability, how easy the technology is to 
use, whether or not the team can meet to face-to-face because of where they work, and how 
confidential the information you’re communicating is. 
Communication models are important in the Manage Communications process, 
just like they are in planning. You already know about those too!

Lessons learned:
1. Don’t use 70s phones for 
calling external vendors. 
2. Be sure to hire 
people with effective 
communication skills.
Next time they plan a 
party, Jeff and Charles 
won’t run into the 
misunderstandings that 
they had on this one. 
It’s important to 
write down the good 
things you learned 
on the project, too. 
That way, you can be 
sure to repeat your 
successes next time.  
Lessons learned are all of the corrective and preventive actions that you 
have had to take on your project, and anything you have learned along the way. 
And one of the most valuable things you’ll do for future project managers is write 
them down and add them to your company’s organizational process 
asset library. That way, other people can learn from your experience.
Project communications 
Throughout your project, you’re creating status reports, presentations, and many 
other communications to keep your project stakeholders informed.  It makes 
sense that all of these would be outputs of the Manage Communications process.
Project Management plan updates
As your project progresses, you’ll make changes to the Project Management 
plan as new information is available.  All of those project plan updates help to 
communicate what’s going on in your project. 
Project document updates
We’ve seen in other processes that keeping the project documentation 
updated is a big part of keeping everyone on the same page. Those 
project document updates are likewise a big part of how your project is 
communicated to all of the project stakeholders.
One of your most important outputs

526    Chapter 10
Q:  What do I do with lessons learned after I write them?
A:   The great thing about lessons learned is that you get 
to help other project managers with them. You add them to 
your company’s organizational process asset library, and other 
project managers then use them for planning their projects. 

Since Jeff and Charles learned that they shouldn’t use their 
retro phones for planning parties, no one should ever have 
to deal with that problem when planning a party for Jeff and 
Charles again. They wrote down the lesson they learned and 
filed it away for future planning efforts. 
Q: I still don’t get the different types of communication.
A: When you think about it, they are pretty easy to 
remember. You have formal and informal communication, and 
verbal and written communication types. The four different 
ways you can mix those up are all of the communication types. 
Think of informal verbal as phone calls between different team 
members. Formal verbal is giving a presentation. Informal 
written is sending out notes, emails, or memos. Formal written 
is when you have to write specifications or other formal project 
documentation. 

For the test, you need to be able to identify which is which. If 
you just think of these examples, it should be a snap for you.
Q: Now, who’s decoding, who’s encoding, and where 
does feedback come from?
A:  Think of encoding as making your message ready 
for other people to hear or read. If you write a book, you are 
encoding your message into words on pages. The person who 
buys the book needs to read it to decode it. The same is true for 
a presentation. When you present, you encode your thoughts 
into presentation images and text. The people who are listening 
to your presentation need to read the text, hear your voice, and 
see the visuals to decode it. 

Feedback is all about the person who decodes the message 
letting the person who encoded it know that she received it. In 
the case of a book, this could be a reader sending a question 
or a note to the author or writing a review of it on a website. In 
a presentation, it could be as simple as nodding your head that 
you understand what’s being said. 
Q: Do I have to know everything that will be 
communicated to build a plan?
A: No. As you learn more about the project, you can always 
update the plan to include new information as you learn it. 
Pretty much all of the planning processes allow for progressive 
elaboration. You plan as much as you can up front, and then put 
all changes through change control from then on. So, if you find 
something new, put in a change request and update the plan 
when it’s approved. 
There are only four 
communication types; 
formal written, informal 
written, formal verbal, 
and informal verbal. For 
the test, you need to be 
able to tell which is which.

Let everyone know how the project’s going
You spend a lot of time collecting valuable information about how your 
projects are doing. So what do you do with it? You communicate it. And 
that’s what the Control Communications process is for: taking the 
information you gathered about how work is being done and distributing 
it to the stakeholders who need to make decisions about the project.
Remember, the team members are all 
stakeholders, too—and this information is 
especially important to them.!
Hey, 
we’re still 
waiting on the 
band to confirm. 
And didn’t the 
caterer have some 
questions?
I have no idea! 
I haven’t heard 
back from anyone!
It all starts with work performance data
You create one of the most important outputs of your entire project 
when the team is doing the project work in Direct and Manage 
Execution. Work performance data tells you the status of each 
deliverable in the project, what the team’s accomplished, and all of 
the information you need to know in order to figure out how your 
project’s going. But you’re not the only one who needs this—your team 
members and stakeholders need to know what’s going on, so they can 
adjust their work and correct problems early on.
Whenever you hear back from 
a team member about how 
the job is going, that’s work 
performance data.
Work performance 
data
You created this when you were 
executing the project—it was where 
you reported how the project work 
was going. Now you’re using it to 
report the performance of the 
team to the stakeholders and the 
rest of the company.

528    Chapter 10
Take a close look at the work being done
Work performance information isn’t the only information you 
need to figure out how the project is going. There are a whole 
lot of outputs from the Executing processes that you need to 
look at if you really want to get a clear picture of your project. 
Control Communications 
takes the outputs from 
the Executing process in 
Manage Communications 
and turns them into 
work performance 
information.
This input is all of the 
data your project is 
producing, like # of 
defects, % complete, and 
actual costs.
If you want a complete 
picture of your project, you’ll 
need to take a look at your 
deliverable status and the other 
communications you’ve made so 
far.
You already know what 
these are for! Can you 
think of why they’re 
important for Control 
Communications?
The work performance data input is a lot easier than it looks—because you 
already know all about it!
Take a minute and flip back to Control Costs in Chapter 7. You learned how to use actual costs 
and actual percent complete numbers to help you calculate EV, CPI, and SPI to measure your 
project’s performance, and you used EAC and ETC to forecast when the project would be complete. Those data 
points that were actually measured on your project are called work performance data. And those forecasts that you 
calculated are called work performance information.

that’s really familiar to a lot of project managers. Can you figure out 
what each of its tools and techniques is for just from the name?
Information management systems
Here’s where all of the project communication can be found. You’ll find all of the 
current progress reports, risk and issue logs, and other project documents here.  
Expert judgment
You might want to rely on expertise from your stakeholders, consultants, your 
PMO, or others to determine the right information to communicate about  your 
project.  
Meetings
You can hold meetings with your team members to get everyone on the same 
page about the progress reports on your project.

Now you can get the word out
Now that you’ve gathered up all the information about 
how the project’s being done, it’s time to get it out to 
the people who need it. The outputs from Control 
Communications shouldn’t be particularly surprising… 
you’re just packaging up the information you collected and 
turning it all into stuff that’s easy to distribute to all the 
stakeholders. You’ve got three outputs from the process:
Control Communications is about more than just telling people how the project is doing. It’s 
also about finding problems. What kind of problems are you likely to uncover when you sit 
down with stakeholders and put together your work performance information and forecasts?
Work performance information is the most 
important output of the process—which shouldn’t 
be a surprise, since the process is called Control 
Communications. Your performance reports tell 
everyone exactly how the project is doing, and how 
far off it is from its time, cost, and scope baselines. 
These include forecasts, which are what you 
turn your EAC and ETC numbers into. That way, 
everyone has a good idea of when the project is going 
to finish.
Organizational process asset updates 
need to be added—especially your lessons learned. 
There are always a lot of lessons to be learned when 
you’re gathering this kind of project information.
Change requests happen when you do Control 
Communications. What do you do if you find out 
that your forecasts have your project coming in too 
late or over budget? You put the change request 
in as soon as possible. And if you need the project 
to change course, you’ll need to recommend 
corrective actions to the team.

People aren’t talking!
What’s causing all of these problems? 
Will better communication help?
There’s so much information floating around on 
any project, and if you’re not careful it won’t get 
to the people who need it. That’s why so much 
of your job is communication—if you don’t 
stay on top of all of it, your project can run into 
some serious trouble!

a handle on this?
The forecast 
looked good, and 
everyone was on top of

we were on track for

these problems came 
up…

534    Chapter 10
Count the channels of communication
How many people need to talk to one another? Well, Jeff and Charles need to talk. But 
what about the DJ and the band? They wanted to set up their equipment in the same 
place—it looks like they need to talk, too. And the bartender needs to coordinate with 
the caterer. Wow, this is starting to get complicated. A good project manager needs 
to get a handle on all this communication, because it’s really easy to lose track of it. 
That’s why you need to know how to count the channels of communication
on any project.
When there are 
three people 
on the project, 
there are 
three lines of 
communication.
But add three more people 
to the project, and you 
add a LOT of potential 
communication to the project! 
How do you get a handle on it?
Counting communication lines the easy way
It would be really easy to get overwhelmed if you tried to count all the lines of 
communication by hand. Luckily, there’s a really easy way to do it by using a simple formula. 
Take the total number of people on the project—including the project manager—and call 
that number 
. Then all you need to do is plug that number into this simple formula:
So, how many more lines of communication were added when three more people joined 
the three-person project above? You know there were three lines to start with. So now just 
figure out how many lines there are for 6 people:
When you added three more people to the three-person project—that had three lines 
of communication—the new team has 15 lines. So you added 12 channels of 
communication.
Don’t forget to count 
the project manager!
 n x (n - 1) 
2
# lines for n people =
 6 x (6 - 1) 
2
# lines for 6 people =
= (6 x 5)  2 = 15
You’ll need to know this 
formula on the PMP exam. 
Just keep using it, though, 
and you’ll get it down in 
no time.
counting communication lines
Sometimes you’ll see 
communications channels 
referred to as “lines.” You 
might see it either way 
on the exam, so we’ll use 
both terms here to get 
you used to them.

You’ll need to know how to calculate the number of lines of 
communication for the exam…but don’t worry, it’s really easy 
once you get a little practice.
1. You’re managing a project with five people on the team, plus one additional stakeholder—the sponsor. Draw 
in all the channels of communication on this picture.
2. Wow, that was a lot of work. Luckily, you won’t need to do that again. Now do it the easy way: use the formula 
to figure out how many lines of communication there are for seven people.
3. OK, now let’s say that you’ve added two team members and two more stakeholders, so there are now 11 
people on the project who need to communicate with one another. How many lines did you add?

First figure out how many lines there are for 11 people:







So how many lines were added when four people joined the seven-person project?
       x (       - 1) 
2
# lines for      people =
= (       x       )  2 =      
     
     
Don’t forget the project manager. 
There are six people on the team, 
but the total number of people who 
need to communicate is seven people, 
because the PM needs to communicate 
with the team members and sponsor.
       x (       - 1) 
2
# lines for        people =
= (       x       )  2 =      
     
     
# lines added = # lines for 11 people - # lines for 7 people
=        -        =

536    Chapter 10
Q: Some of those communication 
skills seem like the same thing. What’s 
the difference between active and 
effective listening?
A:  Some of the communications ideas do 
have names that are a little confusing. But 
don’t worry, they’re really easy concepts for 
you to understand.

Active listening just means when you’re 
listening to something, you keep alert and 
take specific actions that help make sure 
you understand. It includes both effective 
listening and feedback. Effective listening 
is a way that you do active listening—it 
means paying attention to both verbal and 
nonverbal communication. Feedback means 
doing things like repeating back the words 
that you were told in order to make sure 
you understood them, and giving your own 
nonverbal cues to show the speaker that you 
got the message.
Q: OK, so what about nonverbal and 
paralingual communication? Aren’t those 
the same thing?
A: They are very similar, but they’re not 
exactly the same. Nonverbal communication 
is any kind of communication that doesn’t 
use words. That includes things like 
changing your body language, making eye 
contact, and using gestures. Paralingual 
communication is a kind of nonverbal 
communication—it’s changing your tone 
of voice or intonation, finding ways to 
communicate things above and beyond just 
the words that you’re saying. For example, 
the same words mean very different things 
if you say them sarcastically than if you say 
them in a normal tone of voice.
Q: Why is all that stuff about different 
kinds of communication important?
A: It’s important because 90% of project 
management is communication, so if you 
want to be the best project manager that 
you can be, you need to constantly work to 
improve your communication skills!
Q: Should I always have a kickoff 
meeting?
A: Yes, absolutely! You should always 
have a kickoff meeting for every project. 
Not only that, but if you’re running the 
kind of project with several phases, and 
you go through all of the process groups 
for each phase, then you should have a 
separate kickoff meeting for each new 
phase. Kickoff meetings also help you 
define who’s responsible for various 
communications. Kickoff meetings are really 
important, because they give the team a 
chance to meet face-to-face, and give you 
the opportunity to make sure that everyone 
really understands all of the ways they 
can communicate with one another. That’s 
a great way to head off a lot of potential 
project problems!
Q: Why do I need to be able to 
calculate the number of lines of 
communication?
A: It may seem like the lines of 
communication formula is something 
arbitrary that you just need to memorize for 
the exam, but it’s actually pretty useful.

Let’s say that you have a project with 
a whole lot of people on it. You set up 
a good communication system in your 
Communication Management plan, but you 
want to make sure that you really included 
every line in it, because if you missed one 
then you could run into communications 
problems down the line. So what do you 
do? Well, one thing you can do to check 
your work is to calculate the total number 
of lines of communication in your project, 
and then make sure that every one of those 
lines is represented somewhere in your 
communications plan. It’s a little more work 
up front, but it could really save you a lot of 
effort down the line!
Q: I spent all that time working on 
performance reports. What do I do with 
them once I’m done with them?
A: The same thing you do with any 
information that you generate on your 
project. You add them to your organizational 
process assets! 

Think back to how you came up with your 
estimates in Time Management and Cost 
Management. You spent a lot of time doing 
analogous estimation, right? That’s where 
you use performance from past projects to 
come up with a rough, top-down estimate for 
your new project. Well, where do you think 
the performance information from those past 
projects came from? You got them from your 
organizational process assets. And how did 
they end up there? Project managers from 
those past projects took their performance 
reports and added them. So you should add 
your performance reports, too. That way, 
project managers on future projects can 
use your project when they need to look up 
historical data.
You should add all 
of your performance 
reports to the 
organizational process 
assets so that project 
managers on future 
projects can use them as 
historical information.

12. You’re managing a project with 2 client 
sponsors, and you have a 10-person team 
reporting to you. You’ve been given a budget 
increase, which allowed you to increase 
your team size by 30%. How many lines of 
communication were added?
A.	 66
B.	 78
C.	 42
D.	 120
This is the wrong answer 
you’d get if you calculate 
the number of lines of 
communication if you include 
the team and two sponsors, 
but forget to include the 
project manager.
Question Clinic: The calculation question
You’ll run across a bunch of 
questions on the exam asking you to use some 
of the formulas that you learned. Luckily, 
these are some of the easiest questions that 
you can answer.
When you sit down to take an exam at a 
computer testing center, you’ll be given scratch 
paper. You’ll also have 15 minutes to go through a 
tutorial that shows you how to use the exam system. 
Before you finish the tutorial, take a minute and write 
down all of the formulas. Write down the earned value 
formulas and the formula to calculate the lines of 
communication on the scratch paper. That will make 
any calculation question easy.
This wrong answer is 
the number of lines of 
communication BEFORE the 
team size was increased. You 
have 13 people (10 team 
members, 2 client sponsors, 
and you), so the number of 
lines is 13 x 12 ÷ 2 = 78.
This wrong answer is the number of lines of 
communication AFTER the team size was 
increased by 30%. You have 16 people (13 
team members, 2 client sponsors, and you), so 
the number of lines is 16 x 15 ÷ 2 = 120.
Aha! Here’s the right answer. 
Take the number of lines for 
16 people and subtract the 
number of lines for 13 people: 
120 - 78 = 42.

communications management
1. Answer: B
Any communication that can be used for legal purposes is considered formal written communication.  An 
invoice is a formal document.
2. Answer: C
Information gathering techniques are not part of Plan Communications Management. 
3. Answer: A
The Communications Management plan is the first 
thing you need to create in this situation.  It will help 
you organize the meetings that are taking place and 
get everyone on the same page. The Communications 
Management plan will help you to streamline 
communications so that the customer can use you as a 
single point of contact, too.  
4. Answer: D
Paralingual communication happens when additional information is conveyed by the tone or 
pitch of your voice. It’s when you use more than just words to communicate.
5. Answer: B
When you look at work performance data, you’re in the Control Communications process. And 
what do you do with the work performance data? You compare it against the baselines to 
see if your project is on track! If it isn’t, that’s when you want to get the word out as quickly as 
possible.
6. Answer: A
The formula for lines of communication is n x (n – 1)  2.  In this problem there were seven people named, plus you.  
(8 x 7)  2 = 28.

All of the other options show the speaker that you understand what is being said. That’s active listening.
8. Answer: A
This question is just asking if you know the definitions of encode, decode, and feedback.  Encoding is 
making a message ready for other people to understand, while decoding it involves receiving the message 
and understanding it. Feedback means letting the sender know that you got the message. 
9. Answer: C
Any time you are communicating with the customer about the scope of your project, it’s a good idea to use 
formal written communication. 
10. Answer: A
He has to encode his message so that others will understand it.  
11. Answer: A
(15 x 14)  2 = 105. This one is just asking if you know the formula n x (n–1)  2.
12. Answer: D
Control Communications is the only Monitoring and Controlling process in Communications Management.
Active listening sometimes means saying things 
like “I agree,” or “can you explain that a 
little further?”
Any time you see anything about a 
formal document in communication with 
a client, it’s formal written.

13. Answer: B
There are now 12 team members, 5 sponsors, and a project manager. That gives you 18 people. Use the 
formula: n x (n – 1)  2 to calculate this: 18 x 17  2 = 153.
14. Answer: B
The idea behind forecasts is that you are using the earned value calculations that forecast the completion of 
the project to set everyone’s expectations. That’s why you use EAC (which helps you estimate your project’s 
total cost) and ETC (which gives you a good idea of how much more money you think you’ll spend between 
now and when it ends).
15.  Answer: C
There are plenty of ways that communication can go 
wrong. When you send email to the wrong person, 
your communication had trouble—but that’s not 
noise. Noise is the specific thing that interferes with 
the communication. In this case, the garbled text is a 
great example of noise.

Planning for the unknown
Even the most carefully planned project can 
run into trouble.  No matter how well you plan, your project can 
always run into unexpected problems. Team members get sick or quit, 
resources that you were depending on turn out to be unavailable—even 
the weather can throw you for a loop. So does that mean that you’re 
helpless against unknown problems? No! You can use risk planning 
to identify potential problems that could cause trouble for your project, 
analyze how likely they’ll be to occur, take action to prevent the risks 
you can avoid, and minimize the ones that you can’t.
Don’t worry, 
Sally! I took 
care of it with risk 
planning. You can 
swing away without 
a care in the world!
Gee whiz, 
Bobby! What 
if these ropes 
break?

552    Chapter 11
risks might occur
What’s a risk?
There are no guarantees on any project! Even the simplest activity can run into 
unexpected problems. Any time there’s anything that might occur on your project 
and change the outcome of a project activity, we call that a risk. A risk can be an 
event (like a fire), or it can be a condition (like an important part being unavailable).  
Either way, it’s something that may or may not happen…but if it does, you will be 
forced to change the way you and your team work on the project.
A risk is any 
uncertain event 
or condition 
that might 
affect your 
project.
Not all risks 
are negative.
If your project requires 
that you stand on the 
edge of a cliff, then 
there’s a risk that you 
could fall.
If it’s very windy out 
or the ground is slippery 
and uneven, then falling 
is more likely.
Not all risks are negative
Some events (like finding an easier way to do an 
activity) or conditions (like lower prices for certain 
materials) can help your project! When this happens, 
we call it an opportunity…but it’s still handled just 
like a risk.

How you deal with risk
When you’re planning your project, risks are still uncertain: they haven’t happened 
yet. But eventually, some of the risks that you plan for do happen. And that’s when 
you have to deal with them. There are four basic ways to handle a risk:
 Avoid
The best thing that 
you can do with a 
risk is avoid it—if 
you can prevent it 
from happening, 
it definitely won’t 
hurt your project.
1
 Mitigate
If you can’t avoid the 
risk, you can mitigate it. 
This means taking some 
sort of action that will 
cause it to do as little 
damage to your project 
as possible.
2
 Transfer
One effective way 
to deal with a risk 
is to pay someone 
else to accept it 
for you. The most 
common way to 
do this is to buy 
insurance.
3
 Accept
When you can’t avoid, mitigate, or transfer a risk, 
then you have to accept it. But even when you accept 
a risk, at least you’ve looked at the alternatives and 
you know what will happen if it occurs.
4
The easiest way to avoid 
this risk is to walk away 
from the cliff…but that 
may not be an option on 
this project.
If you can’t avoid the risk, and there’s 
nothing you can do to reduce its 
impact, then accepting it
is your only choice.
Looks like 
falling is the 
best option.

554    Chapter 11
planning for risk
Plan Risk Management
By now, you should have a pretty good feel for how each of the 
planning processes work. The past few knowledge areas started 
out with their own planning process, and Risk Management 
is no different. You start with the Plan Risk Management 
process, which should look very familiar to you.
Are people at your company 
risk takers? Do they play 
it safe? Every company 
has people with different 
attitudes about risk.
You’ll need to see if there 
are standard templates, 
roles and responsibilities, 
or risk categories that 
your company uses.
You can figure out why 
you need these Project 
Management plans and the 
scope statement. Take a 
minute to think it through.
Are you starting to see 
a pattern here?
You may get a question on 
the exam that asks which 
processes use organizational 
process assets! Think about why you 
need them for Plan Risk Management and 
the other planning processes. That should 
help you remember which processes need 
them.
Organizational
process assets
Enterprise
environmental factors
Inputs
By the time a risk actually occurs on your 
project, it’s too late to do anything about it. 
That’s why you need to plan for risks from 
the beginning and keep coming back to do 
more planning throughout the project.
Project Management plan

You’ll learn more 
about this one in

project risk management
Meetings
You do all your 
risk planning 
by meeting 
with the team.
You’ll keep meeting 
with them 
throughout your 
project to stay on 
top of risks.
The Risk Management plan is the only output
It tells you how you’re going to handle risk on your project—which 
you probably guessed, since that’s what management plans do. It 
says how you’ll assess risk on the project, who’s responsible for 
doing it, and how often you’ll do risk planning (since you’ll have to 
meet about risk planning with your team throughout the project).
The plan has parts that are really useful for managing risk:
It has a bunch of risk categories that you’ll use to classify 
your risks. Some risks are technical, like a component 
that might turn out to be difficult to use. Others are 
external, like changes in the market or even problems 
with the weather. Risk categories help you to build a risk 
breakdown structure (RBS).
You’ll need to describe the methods and approach you’ll use 
for identifying and classifying risks on your project.  This 
section of the document is called the methodology.
It’s important to come up with a plan to help you figure out 
how big a risk’s impact is and how likely a risk is to happen. 
The impact tells you how much damage the risk will cause 
to your project. A lot of projects classify impact on a scale 
from minimal to severe, or from very low to very high. 
This section of the document is called the definitions of 
probability and impact.
The Risk Management 
plan is your guide to 
identifying and analyzing 
risks on your project.
It tells you who identifies and 
analyzes the risks, how they do 
it, and how often it happens.

Use a risk breakdown structure to categorize risks
You should build guidelines for risk categories into your 
Risk Management plan, and the easiest way to do that is 
to use a risk breakdown structure (RBS). Notice how 
it looks a lot like a WBS? It’s a similar idea—you come up 
with major risk categories, and then decompose them into 
more detailed ones.
This is what an RBS looks like. 
The idea here is that you want 
to come up with a way to take 
each risk and give it a category.
When you sit down with the 
team to come up with a list 
of risks, the RBS will be 
really useful. The categories 
are a great reminder when 
you’re brainstorming.
Once you come up with a list 
of risks, you’ll label each risk 
with one of these categories. 
That will make it easier to 
figure out how to deal with 
the risks later.

The RBS is just one way to 
categorize risks. It’s not a tool 
or technique by itself; you’ll

Anatomy of a risk
Once you’re done with Plan Risk Management, there are four more 
Risk Management processes that will help you and your team come 
up with the list of risks for your project, analyze how they could 
affect it, and plan how you and your team will respond if any of the 
risks materialize when you’re executing it.
Identify Risks
The first thing you need to do when 
planning for risks is to gather the team 
together and come up with a list of 
every possible risk you can think of.
Once you’ve got a list of risks, you’ll 
need to get a good idea of the 
probability and impact of each risk.
Remember the probability and impact 
guidelines in the Risk Management 
plan? This is where you use them to 
assign a probability and impact to 
each risk!
risk planning processes
Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis
The RBS you created during Plan 
Risk Management will make it a 
lot easier to do this.

you are here 4    559
project risk management
Plan Risk Responses
All four of these Risk Management 
processes are in the Planning 
process group—you need to plan 
for your project’s risks before you 
start executing the project.
By the time you get here, 
you’ve got a list of risks, with 
a probability and impact 
assigned to each. That’s a 
great starting point, but 
sometimes you need more 
information if you want to 
make good decisions…
You can make better decisions with 
more precise information. That’s 
what this process is about—assigning 
numerical values for the probability 
and impact of each risk.
All that’s left now is to plan responses 
to each risk! This is where you decide 
whether to avoid, mitigate, transfer, 
or accept…and how you’ll do it!
Perform Quantitative Risk 
Analysis
Some teams do Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis first, while others start with Perform Quantitative 
Risk Analysis. Some only do one or the other. Can you think of reasons they might do this?
There are two more Risk Management processes. 
You already saw Plan Risk Management. There’s 
also a Monitoring and Controlling process called 
Control Risks that you use when a risk actually 
materializes.

What could happen to your project?
You can’t plan for risks until you’ve figured out which ones you’re likely to run 
into. That’s why the next Risk Management process is Identify Risks. The 
idea is that you want to figure out every possible risk that might affect your 
project. Don’t worry about how unlikely the risk is, or how bad the impact 
would be—you’ll figure that stuff out later. 
This will include all of your activity cost 
estimates and your activity duration 
estimates, which are also inputs.
You should look at lessons 
learned from past projects 
to see what went wrong.
The tools and techniques are all 
about gathering information from 
people and making sure it’s right.
The risk register is the only 
output—and it’s the most 
important part of Risk 
Management. It’s a list of all of 
the risks and some initial ideas 
about how you’d respond to them.
The goal of 
all of the 
risk planning 
processes is to 
produce the 
risk register. 
That’s your 
main weapon 
against risk.

Information-gathering techniques for Identify Risks
You probably already guessed that the goal of Identify Risks is to identify risks—
seems pretty obvious, right? And the most important way to identify those risks is 
to gather information from the team. That’s why the first—and most important—
technique in Identify Risks is called information gathering techniques. These 
are time-tested and effective ways to get information from your team, stakeholders, 
and anyone else who might have information on risks.
Brainstorming is the first thing you 
should do with your team. Get them all 
together in a room, and start pumping 
out ideas. Brainstorming sessions always 
have a facilitator to lead the team and 
help turn their ideas into a list of risks.
Four useful information gathering techniques
There are a lot of different ways that you can find risks on your project. 
But there are only a few that you’re most likely to use—and those 
are the ones that you will run across on the exam. 
The Delphi technique is a 
way to get opinions and ideas from 
experts. This is another technique 
that uses a facilitator, but instead of 
gathering team members in a room, 
the facilitator sends questionnaires 
to experts asking about important 
project risks. The facilitator will then 
take those answers and circulate them 
all to the experts—but each expert is 
kept anonymous so that they can 
give honest feedback.
Root cause identification is analyzing each 
risk and figuring out what’s actually behind it. Even 
though falling off of the cliff and having your tent 
blow away are two separate risks, when you take a 
closer look you might find that they’re both caused by 
the same thing: high winds, which is the root cause 
for both of them. So you know that if you get high 
winds, you need to be on the lookout for both risks!
Interviews are a really important 
part of identifying risk. Try to find 
everyone who might have an opinion 
and ask them about what could 
cause trouble on the project. The 
sponsor or client will think about the 
project in a very different way than 
the project team.
The facilitator is really important—without her, 
it’s just a disorderly meeting with no clear goal.
The team usually comes up with 
risks that have to do with 
building the product, while the 
sponsor or someone who would use 
the product will think about how 
it could end up being difficult to 
use.
The Delphi technique 
is always anonymous. 
People will give more 
honest opinions if 
they know their 
names won’t be 
attached to them.
What’s the big difference between brainstorming and the Delphi technique? Can 
you think of a situation where one would be more useful than the other?

562    Chapter 11
More Identify Risks techniques
Even though gathering information is the biggest part of Identify Risks, it’s not the 
only part of it. There are other tools and techniques that you’ll use to make sure 
that the risk register you put together lists as many risks as possible. The more you 
know about risk going into the project, the better you’ll handle surprises when they 
happen. And that’s what these tools and techniques are for—looking far and wide 
to get every risk possible.
Documentation reviews are 
when you look at plans, requirements, 
documents from your organizational 
process assets, and any other relevant 
documents that you can find to squeeze 
every possible risk out of them.
Assumptions analysis is what 
you’re doing when you look over your 
project’s assumptions. Remember 
how important assumptions were 
when you were estimating the project? 
Well, now it’s time to look back at 
the assumptions you made and make 
sure that they really are things you 
can assume about the project. Wrong 
assumptions are definitely a risk.
Checklist analysis means using checklists 
that you developed specifically to help you find 
risks. Your checklist might remind you to check 
certain assumptions, talk to certain people, or 
review documents you might have overlooked. 
Diagramming techniques should be pretty familiar to you already. You 
can use the Ishikawa or fishbone diagrams from Quality Management to help 
you find the root cause of a risk, just like you did for a defect. You can also use 
flowcharts to see how parts of your system interact—any place where they get 
complex or uncertain is a good source of risks.
The RBS you created in Plan Risk Management 
is a good place to start for this. You can use all 
the risks you categorized in it as a jumping-off 
point.

analyze strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats. 
You’ll start by brainstorming 
strengths and weaknesses, and 
then examine the strengths to 
find opportunities, and you’ll 
look at the weaknesses to come 
up with threats to the project.
The team made assumptions 
during planning to deal with 
incomplete information…and

Read each of these scenarios and identify which tool or technique is being used.
If a scenario uses an information-gathering technique, specify which one.
1. Your project requires that you set up a campsite on the edge of a cliff. You gather your 
team members—including a geologist, a meteorologist, a tracker, and three campsite 
workers—and lead them in a directed discussion where they identify as many risks as 
possible.
2. You look through your company’s asset library and discover that two previous projects 
involved setting up camp in this area. You look through the lessons learned to figure out 
what went wrong, and what could have been avoided through better planning.
3. You’ve sent a questionnaire to a park ranger and engineers at tent and hiking 
equipment companies to gather their opinions on the risk of falling off of a cliff. You 
remove their names from their responses, copy them, and send them back to everyone 
to get their feedback.
4. You’ve identified a risk that is very complex, so you identify the root cause. You use an 
Ishikawa diagram to gain insight into it.
5. You’ve reviewed your estimates and find that you had assumed that seasonal weather 
patterns would hold. If they change, then it could cause serious problems with the 
project.
6. You meet individually with many different people: the sponsor, stakeholders, team 
members, and experts. You ask each of them detailed questions about what they think 
could go wrong on the project.

Where to look for risks
A good way to understand risks for the exam is to know where they 
come from. If you start thinking about how you find risks on your 
project, it will help you figure out how to handle them. 
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re looking for risks:
These areas are a good start, but there are plenty of other places on your 
project where you can find risks. Can you think of some of them?
find all the risks
Resources are a good 
place to start.
Have you ever been promised a person, 
equipment, conference room, or some other 
resource, only to be told at the last minute that 
the resource you were depending on wasn’t 
available? What about having a critical team 
member get sick or leave the company at the 
worst possible time? Check your list of resources. 
If a resource might not be available to you when 
you need it, then that’s a risk.
The critical path is 
full of risks.
Remember the critical path method from 
Chapter 6? Well, an activity on the critical 
path is a lot riskier than an activity with 
plenty of float, because any delay in that 
activity will delay the project.
2
”When you assume...”
Have you ever heard that old saying about what 
happens when you assume? At the beginning of 
the project, your team had to make a bunch of 
assumptions in order to do your estimates. But 
some of those assumptions may not actually be 
true, even though you needed to make them for 
the sake of the estimate. It’s a good thing you 
wrote them down—now it’s time to go back and 
look at that list. If you find some of them that 
are likely to be false, then you’ve found a risk.
3
Look outside your 
project.
Is there a new rule, regulation, or law 
being passed that might affect your 
project? A new union contract being 
negotiated? Could the price of a critical 
component suddenly jump? There are 
plenty of things outside of your project 
that are risks—and if you identify them 
now, you can plan for them and not be 
caught off guard.
4
If an activity that’s not on the critical 
path has a really small float, that means 
a small problem could easily cause it to 
become critical—which could lead to big 
delays in your project.
Finding risks means talking to 
your team and being creative. 
Risks can be anywhere.

Now put it in the risk register
The point of the Identify Risks process is to…well, identify risks. But what does that 
really give you? You need to know enough about each risk to analyze it and make 
good decisions about how to handle it. So when you’re doing interviews, leading 
brainstorming sessions, analyzing assumptions, gathering expert opinions with the 
Delphi technique, and using the other Identify Risks tools and techniques, you’re 
gathering exactly the things you need to add to the risk register.
The risk register is built into the Risk Management plan. Updates to 
the risk register are the only output of the Identify Risks process.
Risk register
It’s a good idea for your 
Identify Risks meetings to 
include a discussion of how 
to respond to the risks, 
but you’ll really dive into 
this later in the Plan Risk 
Responses process.
This is where the 
results of your root 
cause analysis go.
Some risks do not have 
an obvious response.
You might discover new risk categories, 
like Equipment. If you do, you’ll go 
back to the RBS and add them.
Each risk that you and 
the team come up with 
should go here.
You’ll get a chance 
to come up with 
more complete 
responses later.

Rank your risks
It’s not enough to know that risks are out there. You can identify risks all day long, 
and there’s really no limit to the number of risks you can think of. But some of them 
are likely to occur, while others are very improbable. It’s the ones that have much 
better odds of happening that you really want to plan for.
Besides, some risks will cause a whole lot of damage to your project if they happen, 
while others will barely make a scratch…and you care much more about the risks 
that will have a big impact. That’s why you need the next Risk Management process, 
Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis—so you can look at each risk and figure out 
how likely it is and how big its impact will be.
Why do you think enterprise environmental factors are not an 
input to the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process?

to look at lessons

it happened before.
You need to know what risks 
you’ve identified in order to

Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis helps you prioritize 
each risk and figure out its 
probability and impact.
Examine each risk in the register
Not all risks are created equal. Some of them are really likely to 
happen, while others are almost impossible. One risk will cause a 
catastrophe on your project if it happens; another will just waste a 
few minutes of someone’s time. 
Risk data quality assessment means 
making sure that the information you’re using in your 
risk assessment is accurate. Sometimes it makes sense 
to bring in outside experts to check out the validity 
of your risk assessment data. Sometimes you can 
even confirm the quality of the data on your own, by 
checking some sample of it against other data sources.
Risk categorization is all about grouping 
your risks so that you can come up with a better 
strategy for dealing with them. You might group 
them by the phase of the project where you’ll see 
them, or by the source of the risk. Or you could 
come up with a bunch of additional categories 
that would help you to organize your responses 
better and be ready for the risk if it should happen. 
Risk urgency assessment is checking out 
how soon you’re going to need to take care of a 
particular risk. If a risk is going to happen soon, you’d 
better have a plan for how to deal with it soon, too. 
Risk probability and impact assessment is 
one of the best ways to be sure that you’re handling your 
risks properly by examining how likely they are to happen, 
and how bad (or good) it will be if they do. This process 
helps you assign a probability to the likelihood of a risk 
occurring, and then figure out the actual cost (or impact) 
if it does happen. You can use these values to figure out 
which of your risks need a pretty solid mitigation plan, 
and which can be monitored as the project goes on.

Probability and impact matrix is a table 
where all of your risks are plotted out according to 
the values you assign. It’s a good way of looking at 
the data so you can more easily make judgments 
about which risks require response. The ones with 
the higher numbers are more likely to happen and 
will have a bigger impact on your project if they 
do.  So you’d better figure out how to handle those.
Creating risk categories can help you 
deal with whole groups of risks in one 
response plan.  
Sometimes you’ll find that some risks have obviously low 
probability and impact, so you won’t put them in the 
main section of your register. Instead, you can add them 
to a separate section called the watchlist, which is just a 
list of risks. It’ll include risks you don’t want to forget 
about, but which you don’t need to track as closely. 
You’ll check your watchlist from time to time to keep an 
eye on things.
Expert judgment definitely comes in handy when 
you’re assessing risks. Who better to help you come up 
with things that might go wrong than experts who have 
been through similar projects before?

prioritizing practice
This gives you a good picture of the 
threshold the company has set for 
evaluating risks. 
You can figure out the priority of 
each risk based on its probability 
and impact. Low-priority risks have 
no shading, medium ones are light 
gray, and high ones are dark gray.
1.The organizational process assets at your company set a high-priority risk as any risk with a probability and 
impact score higher than 0.20.  Medium-priority risks are those between 0.10 and 0.19, and low-priority are those 
between 0 and 0.09. Low-priority risks can be monitored on a watchlist, but high and medium ones must have a 
response strategy.
Fill in the missing values in the Priority and Probability columns in the risk register on the right, using the 
Probability and Impact matrix to figure out which ones are low, medium, or high. For example, we filled 
in “High” under Priority for row #3 by looking up risk (“No truck”) in the first table, finding the probability 
and impact values, and then using the  Probability and Impact matrix. The probability is .3 and the impact 
is .7, so you can find the corresponding box in the matrix. Since it’s dark gray, its priority is high.
2 After analyzing your data, you came up with three risk categories for the project: natural, equipment, and human.
Fill in the missing values in the Category column of the risk register with either “Natural,” “Equipment,” or 
“Human.” We started you out by filling in a few of them.
3. For this particular project, you’ll need the equipment at the start of the project, so any equipment risks are 
considered high urgency. Natural and human risks are all medium urgency, except for ones that have to do with 
storms, which you consider low urgency for this project because of limited mitigation potential.
Figure out the whether the urgency for each risk is low, medium, or high and fill in the Urgency column in 
the risk register.

project risk management
Q:  Who does Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis?
A:  The whole team needs to work on it together. 
The more of your team members who are helping to 
think of possible risks, the better off your plan will be. 
Everybody can work together to think of different risks to 
their particular part of the work, and that should give an 
accurate picture of what could happen on the project. 
Q: What if people disagree on how to rank risks?
A: There are a lot of ways to think about risks. If a risk 
has a large impact on your part of the project or your goals, 
you can bet that it will seem more important to you than 
the stuff that affects other people in the group. The best 
way to keep the right perspective is to keep everybody on 
the team evaluating risks based on how they affect the 
overall project goals. If everyone focuses on the effect 
each risk will have on your project’s constraints, risks will 
get ranked in the order that is best for everybody.
Q: Where do the categories come from?
A: You can create categories however you want.  
Usually, people categorize risks in ways that help them 
come up with response strategies. Some people use 
project phase. That way, they can come up with a risk 
mitigation plan for each phase of a project, and they 
can cut down on the information they need to manage 
throughout. Some people like to use the source of the risk 
as a category. If you do that, you can find mitigation plans 
that can help you deal with each source separately.  That 
might come in handy if you are dealing with a bunch of 
different contractors or suppliers and you want to manage 
the risks associated with each separately. 
Q: How do I know if I’ve got all the risks?
A: Unfortunately, you never know the answer to that 
one. That’s why it’s important to keep monitoring your 
risk register throughout the project. It’s important that you 
are constantly updating it and that you never let it sit and 
collect dust. You should be looking for risks throughout all 
phases of your project, not just when you’re starting out.
Q: I’m still not clear on the difference between the 
Delphi technique and brainstorming. 
A: It’s easy to get those two confused because both 
are about people sitting and thinking of risks. Delphi is a 
technique where you ask experts (who may or may not be 
team members) to give their opinion anonymously, and 
then you evaluate those opinions. Brainstorming is just you 
and your team sitting in a room thinking of risks. 
Q: What’s the point in even tracking low-priority 
risks? Why have a watchlist at all?
A: Actually, watchlists are just a list of all of the risks 
that you want to monitor as the project goes on. You might 
be watching them to see if conditions change and make 
them more likely to happen. By keeping a watchlist, you 
make sure that all of the risks that seem low priority when 
you are doing your analysis get caught before they cause 
serious damage if they become more likely later in the 
project. 
The conditions that cause a risk are called triggers. So, 
say you have a plan set up to deal with storms, and you 
know that you might track a trigger for lightning damage, 
such as a thunderstorm. If there’s no thunderstorm, it’s 
really unlikely that you will see lightning damage, but once 
the storm has started, the chance for the risk to occur 
skyrockets.
Q: I still don’t get the difference between priority 
and urgency.
A: Priority tells you how important a risk is, while 
urgency tells you when you need to deal with it. Some 
risks could be high priority but low urgency, which means 
that they’re really important, but not time-critical. For 
example, you might know that a certain supplier that 
provides critical equipment will go out of business in six 
months, and you absolutely need to find a new supplier. 
But you have six months to do it. Finding a new supplier 
is a high priority, because your project will fail if it’s not 
taken care of. But it’s not urgent—even if it takes you four 
months to find a new supplier, nothing bad will happen.

qualitative vs. quantitative
Qualitative vs. quantitative analysis
Let’s say you’re a fitness trainer, and your specialty is helping 
millionaires get ready for major endurance trials. You get paid the 
same for each job, but the catch is that you get paid only if they 
succeed. Which of these clients would you take on?
vs.
Running a marathon
Climbing Mount Everest
One client wants you to help him 
train so that he can finish a 
marathon. He doesn’t have to win, 
just get to the finish line.
It’s much more likely that you can get even an 
out‑of‑shape millionaire to finish a marathon 
than it is that you can get him to climb Mount 
Everest successfully.
In fact, since the 1950s, 10,000 people have attempted 
to climb Mount Everest, and only 1,200 have succeeded. 
200 have died. Your qualitative analysis probably told 
you that the climbing project would be the riskier of the 
two. But having the numbers to back up that judgment 
is what quantitative analysis is all about. 
Another client wants you to help him 
get to the top of Mount Everest. He 
won’t be satisfied unless he gets to 
the summit.

Risk register
The Risk Management plan 
describes how you’ll analyze 
risk.
Risk register updates
The tools for this process 
are all about gathering data 
and analyzing it to determine 
probability of risks occurring. 
Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis
Once you’ve identified risks and ranked them according to the team’s 
assessment, you need to take your analysis a little further and make 
sure that the numbers back you up. Sometimes you’ll find that your 
initial assessment needs to be updated when you look into it further. 
Once you’re done analyzing, you 
update the risk register with 
the data you’ve gathered.
The risk register from qualitative 
analysis is an input to quantitative 
analysis.

get the facts
First gather the data…
Quantitative tools are broken down into three categories: the ones that 
help you get more information about risks, the ones that help you to 
analyze the information you have, and expert judgment to help you put 
it all together. The tools for gathering data focus on gathering numbers 
about the risks you have already identified and ranked. These tools are 
called data gathering and representation techniques.
Interviewing
Sometimes the best way to get hard data about your risks is to 
interview people who understand them. In a risk interview, you 
might focus on getting three-point cost estimates so that you can 
come up with a budget range that will help you mitigate risks later. 
Another good reason to interview is to establish ranges of probability 
and impact, and document the reasons for the estimates on both 
sides of the range. 
Probability distribution
Sometimes taking a look at your time and cost estimate ranges in 
terms of their distribution will help you generate more data about 
them. You probably remember these distribution curves from your 
probability and statistics classes in school. Don’t worry, you won’t be 
asked to remember the formal definition of probability distributions 
or even to be able to create them. You just need to know that they 
are another way of gathering data for quantitative analysis. 
Expert judgment
It’s always a good idea to contact the experts 
if you have access to them. People who have 
a good handle on statistics or risk analysis in 
general can be helpful when you are doing 
quantitative analysis. Also, it’s great to hear 
from anybody who has a lot of experience 
with the kind of project you are creating, too.

project risk management
…then analyze it
Now that you have all the data you can get about your risk register, it’s 
time to analyze that information. Most of the tools for analyzing risk 
data are about figuring out how much the risk will end up costing you. 
These tools are called quantitative risk analysis and modeling 
techniques.  
Sensitivity analysis is all about looking at the effect one 
variable might have if you could completely isolate it. You might 
look at the cost of a windstorm on human safety, equipment loss, 
and tent stability without taking into account other issues that 
might accompany the windstorm (like rain damage or possible 
debris from nearby campsites). People generally use tornado 
diagrams to look at a project’s sensitivity to just one risk factor.
Expected monetary value analysis lets you examine 
costs of all of the paths you might take through the project 
(depending on which risks occur) and assign a monetary value to 
each decision. So, if it costs $100 to survey the cliff and $20 to 
stake your tent, choosing to stake your tent after you’ve looked at 
the cliff has an expected monetary value of $120.
The main method of expected monetary value analysis you need 
to know for the test is decision tree analysis. For decision tree 
analysis, you just diagram out all of the decisions you think you 
will need to make to deal with risks. Then you add up all that you 
would need to spend to make each decision. 
Modeling and simulation. It’s also a good idea to run 
your project risks through modeling programs if you can. Monte 
Carlo analysis is one tool that can randomize the outcomes of 
your risks and the probabilities of them occurring to help you get 
a better sense of how to handle the risks you have identified. 
Monte Carlo analysis lets you run a lot of 
simulations to come up with data about 
what could happen on your project. 
This is the same 
technique you learned 
about back in Chapter 6.
The tornado diagram lets you look at just one 
uncertain factor while assuming that all other 
data will stay where you expect it to.
We’ll talk about 
this in a couple 
of pages…
The wind’s blowing 
at 31 mph SE. I weigh 
153 lbs. According to 
my simulations, I have 
a 28.3% chance of 
falling off the cliff 
in these conditions. 
Quantitative analysis means taking 
measurements and coming up with exact 
numbers to describe your risks.

576    Chapter 11
Calculate the expected monetary value of your risks
OK, so you know the probability and impact of each risk. How does that 
really help you plan? Well, it turns out that if you have good numbers for 
those things, you can actually figure out how much those risks are going to 
cost your project. You can do that by calculating the expected monetary 
value (or EMV) of each risk:
 Start with the probability and impact of each risk.
1
Risk
Probability
Impact
High winds
35%
cost $48 to replace equipment
Mudslide
5%
lose $750 in damage costs
Wind generator is usable
15%
save $800 in battery costs
Truck rental unavailable
10%
cost $350 for last-minute rental
 Take the first risk and multiply the probability by the impact. For opportunities, 
use a positive cost. For threats, use a negative one. Then do the same for the 
rest of the risks.
2
High winds: 35% x – 48 = – 16.80
Mudslide: 5% x – 750 = – 37.50
Wind generator: 15% x 800 = 120.00
Truck rental: 10% x – 350 = – 35.00
Now that you’ve calculated the EMV for each of the risks, you can add 
them up to find the total EMV for all of them.
3
EMV = – 16.80 + – 37.50 + 120.00 + – 35.00 = – 30.70
The wind generator risk is an 
opportunity because you’ll save 
money if it happens. So when you 
do the EMV calculation, you use 
a positive number for the impact.
Even though 
the impact of a 
mudslide is big, 
the probability 
is low so the 
EMV is small.
If you add $30.70 to the budget, 
then it should be enough to account 
for these risks.
You can find these 
in your risk register.

cost of choices
Decision tree analysis uses EMV to help you make choices
There’s another way to do EMV—you can do it visually using something 
called a decision tree. This decision tree shows the hidden costs of 
whether or not you buy a heavier tent. The tent is more expensive—it 
costs $350, while the lighter tent costs $130. But the heavier tent has better 
protection against the wind, so if there are high winds, your equipment 
isn’t damaged.

–$6.50 
EMV = 35% x –$953
–$333.55 
EMV = 65% x –$15
–$9.75 
Is it worth spending 
$350 on a heavier tent, 
rather than $130 on 
the lighter one?
Each of the four branches of this decision tree 
has its own EMV. This branch shows you what 
happens when you don’t buy the heavier tent and 
the high winds occur. The tent costs $130. Add 
the EMV for high winds, which is 35% x $953 = 
$333.55. So the total cost for this branch is $130 
+ $333.55 = $463.55
The National Weather 
Service says there’s a 
35% chance of high winds, 
which means there’s a 
65% chance of low winds.
This is just the EMV of the 
low winds if you buy the 
heavier tent. The probability 
of low winds is 65%, and the 
cost is $10. So it’s just like 
the other EMV calculations: 
65% x -$10 = -$6.50. 
These costs are lower 
because the heavy tent 
gives you more protection 
against the wind.
If you buy a heavy tent, then it protects 
your equipment better, but it’ll cost more. 
You figure that if there are high winds, 
you’ll lose $953 worth of equipment with a 
light tent, but only $48 worth if you have 
a heavy one. If there are low winds, then 
you’ll only lose $15 worth with a light tent 
and $10 worth with a heavy tent.
If we add the EMV for high winds plus the EMV for low winds to the 
cost of the tent, we’ll figure out the “real” cost of choosing the heavier 
tent. So that’s -$16.80 + -$6.50 + -$350 = -$373.30.
Compare that with the EMV of choosing the lighter tent. Which decision makes sense?
We can do the same thing for the bottom two branches of the tree. The 
“cheaper” tent costs -$130 + -$333.55 + -$9.75 = $473.30. So it’s 
actually more expensive!

project risk management
Looking at the decision tree on the facing page, see if you can figure out the 
expected monetary value depending on the decisions the team makes.
1. You hear a weather report that says there’s now a 45% chance of high winds. Does it still make sense 
to buy the heavier tent?
2. If you don’t buy the heavier tent, then you have room to take along a wind generator that can power 
your equipment, and that will save you $1,100 in portable batteries if there’s a heavy wind. If there’s 
still a 45% chance of high winds, does it still make sense to buy the heavier tent? 
Q:  I still don’t get this Monte Carlo 
stuff. What’s the deal?
A:  All you really need to know about 
Monte Carlo analysis for the test is that it’s 
a way that you can model out random data 
using software. In real life, though, it’s a 
really cool way of trying to see what could 
happen on your project if risks do occur. 
Sometimes modeling out the data you 
already have about your project helps you to 
better see the real impact of a risk if it 
did happen.
Q: I can figure out how much the 
risk costs using EMV, or I can do it with 
decision tree analysis. Why do I need two 
ways to do this?
A: That’s a good question. If you take a 
really careful look at how you do decision 
tree analysis, you might notice something…
it’s actually doing exactly the same thing as 
EMV. It turns out that those two techniques 
are really similar, except that EMV does it 
using numbers and decision tree analysis 
spells out the same calculation using 
a picture.
Q: I understand that EMV and decision 
trees are related, but I still don’t exactly 
see how.
A: It turns out that there are a lot of EMV 
techniques, and decision tree analysis is just 
one of them. But it’s the one you need to 
know for the test, because it’s the one that

helps you make decisions by figuring out 
the EMV for each option. You can bet that 
you’ll see a question or two that asks you 
to calculate the EMV for a project based on 
decision tree like the one on the facing page. 
As long as you remember that risks are 
negative numbers and that opportunities are 
positive ones, you should do fine.
Q: So are both quantitative analysis 
and qualitative analysis really just 
concerned with figuring out the impact 
of risks?
A: That’s right. Qualitative analysis 
focuses on the impact as the team judges it 
in planning. Quantitative analysis focuses on 
getting the hard numbers to back up 
those judgments.
Hint: Figure out the new EMV for each branch—
that will tell you if the decision makes sense.
This is an opportunity. So it should 
have a POSITIVE value when you do 
the EMV calculation.

Update the risk register based on your 
quantitative analysis results
When you’ve finished gathering data about the risks, you change your 
priorities, urgency ratings and categories (if necessary), and you update 
your risk register. Sometimes modeling out your potential responses to 
risk helps you to find a more effective way to deal with them. That’s 
why the only output of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis 
is Project Documents Updates. 
This one got downgraded when quantitative 
analysis showed that it was not very likely to 
happen on such a short-term project.

project risk management

The main output of all of the Risk Management planning processes is updated project documents, 
and the main document that gets updated is the risk register. 

The first step in Risk Management is Identify Risks, where you work with the whole team to figure out 
what risks could affect your project.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis are all about ranking risks based on their probability and impact. 

Qualitative analysis is where you take the categories in your risk plan and assign them to each of the 
risks that you’ve identified.

Quantitative analysis focuses on gathering numbers to help evaluate risks and making the best 
decisions about how to handle them. 

Decision tree analysis is one kind of expected monetary value analysis. It focuses on adding up 
all of the costs of decisions being made on a project so that you can see the overall value of risk 
responses. 

To calculate EMV, be sure to treat all negative risks as negative numbers and all opportunities as 
positive ones. Then add up all of the numbers on your decision tree. 

Don’t forget watchlists. They let you monitor lower-priority risks so that you can see if triggers for those 
risks occur and you need to treat them as higher priorities. 

All of the processes in Risk Management are Planning or Monitoring and Controlling processes. 
There are no Executing processes here. Since the goal is to plan for risks, there is no need to focus on 
actually doing the work. By then, it’s too late to plan for risks.
Your risk register should include 
both threats and opportunities. 
Opportunities have positive impact 
values, while threats have negative 
ones. Don’t forget the plus 
or minus sign when you’re 
calculating EMV.
How would you handle the risks 
listed in the risk register so far?

582    Chapter 11
How do you respond to a risk?
After all that analysis, it’s time to figure out what you’re going to do if a 
risk occurs. Maybe you’ll be able to keep a reserve of money to handle 
the cost of the most likely risks. Maybe there’s some planning you can do 
from the beginning to be sure that you avoid it. You might even find a way 
to transfer some of the risk with an insurance policy.
However you decide to deal with each individual risk, you’ll update your 
risk responses in the risk register to show your decisions when you’re done. 
When you’re done with Plan Risk Responses, you should be able to 
tell your change control board what your response plans are and who will 
be in charge of them so they can use them to evaluate changes. 
Plan Risk Responses 
is figuring out what 
you’ll do if risks 
happen.
You’ve updated your risk register as 
part of all of your analysis so far. It 
should contain everything you know 
about the risks facing your project, 
and even some preliminary responses you 
might have thought of along the way. 
You might consult the Risk Management 
plan to figure out who is responsible 
for various activities in the Plan Risk 
Responses process, and for guidelines to 
help you prioritize your risks.
Notice that organizational process 
assets aren’t here. You can’t use 
a template for this one. It’s all 
about figuring out the responses 
that make sense for your project’s 
SPECIFIC risks.

It isn’t always so bad
Remember the strategies for handling negative risks—avoid, mitigate, 
transfer, and accept—from earlier? Well, there are strategies for handling 
positive risks, too. The difference is that strategies for positive risks 
are all about how you can try to get the most out of them. The strategies for 
handling negative and positive risks are the tools and techniques for the Plan 
Risk Responses process.
 Exploit
This is when you do everything you can to make 
sure that you take advantage of an opportunity. 
You could assign your best resources to it. Or 
you could allocate more than enough funds to 
be sure that you get the most out of it.
1
 Share
Sometimes it’s harder to take advantage of an 
opportunity on your own. Then you might call 
in another company to share in it with you. 
2
 Enhance
This is when you try to make the opportunity 
more probable by influencing its triggers. If 
getting a picture of a rare bird is important, 
then you might bring more food that it’s 
attracted to.
3
 Accept
Just like accepting a negative risk, sometimes an  
opportunity just falls in your lap. The best thing 
to do in that case is to just accept it!
4
Response planning can even find more risks  
Secondary risks come from a response 
you have to another risk. If you dig a trench to 
stop landslides from taking out your camp, it’s 
possible for someone to fall into the trench and 
get hurt. 
Residual risks remain after your risk 
responses have been implemented. So even 
though you reinforce your tent stakes and get 
weatherproof gear, there’s still a chance that 
winds could destroy your camp if they are 
strong enough. 
I get it. So, I have to go 
back and analyze secondary 
risks. But residual risks just 
sit there, so I can deal with 
them later. 
The strategies for negative risks are 
also tools and techniques for this 
process. They’re the ones you already 
learned: avoid, mitigate, transfer, and 
accept. Acceptance is a technique for 
both negative and positive risks.

If the weather’s good, then there’s a chance you could see a meteor 
shower. If the team gets a photo that wins the meteor photo contest, 
you can get extra funding. You have your team stay up all night with 
their telescopes and cameras ready.
You hear that it’s going to rain for the first three days of your trip, so 
you bring waterproof tents and indoor projects for the team to work 
on in the meantime. 
You read that there’s a major bear problem in the spring on the cliff 
where you are planning to work. You change your project start date to 
happen in the fall. 
On your way up the cliff, you meet another team that is looking to 
survey the area. You offer to do half of the surveying work while they 
do the other half and then trade your findings with each other. 
There’s a high probability of water damage to some of your 
equipment, so you buy insurance to avoid losses.
There’s always the chance that someone could make a mistake and 
fall off the cliff. No matter how much you plan for the unexpected, 
sometimes mistakes happen. 
About 10 years ago a really rare bird, the black-throated blue warbler, 
was seen on this cliff. If you could get a picture of it, it would be 
worth a lot of money. So, you bring special seeds that you have read 
are really attractive to this bird, and you set up lookout points around 
the cliff with cameras ready to get the shot.

Add risk responses to the register
It’s time to add—you guessed it—more updates to project documents, including 
the risk register. All of your risk responses will be tracked through change 
control. Changes that you need to make to the plan will get evaluated based on 
your risk responses, too. It’s even possible that some of your risk responses will 
need to be added into your contract.

Head First: We’ve seen you hanging out on cliffs 
for a while now. Apparently, you’ve also been paying 
people to stand on the cliff for you, or getting a 
friend to hold a trampoline at the foot of the cliff; 
we’ve even seen you jump off of it. So now that I’ve 
finally got a chance to interview you, I want to ask 
the question on everyone’s mind: “Are you insane? 
Why do you spend so much time up there?”
Stick Figure: First off, let me dispel a few myths 
that are flying around out there about me. I’m not 
crazy, and I’m not trying to get myself killed! Before 
Risk Management entered my life I, like you, would 
never have dreamed of doing this kind of thing. 
Head First: OK, but I’m a little skeptical about 
your so-called “Risk Management.” Are you trying 
to say that because of Risk Management you don’t 
have to worry about the obvious dangers of being up 
there?
Stick Figure: No. Of course not! That’s not the 
point at all. Risk Management means you sit down 
and make a list of all of the things that could go 
wrong. (And even all the things that could go right.) 
Then you really try to think of the best way to deal 
with anything unexpected. 
Head First: So you’re doing this Risk Management 
stuff to make it less dangerous for you?
Stick Figure: Yes, exactly! By the time I’m standing 
up there on that cliff, I’ve really thought my way 
through pretty much everything that might happen 
up there. I’ve thought through it both qualitatively 
and quantitatively. 
Head First: Quantitatively?
Stick Figure: Yes. You don’t think I’d go up there 
without knowing the wind speed, do you? Chance 
of landslides? Storms? The weight of everything 
I’m carrying? How likely I am to fall in weather 
conditions? I think about all of that and I measure 
it. Then I sit down and come up with risk response 
strategies. 
Head First: OK, so you have strategies. Then 
what?
Stick Figure: Then I constantly monitor my risks 
while I’m on the cliff. If anything changes, I check to 
see if it might trigger any of the risks I’ve come up 
with. Sometimes I even discover new risks while I’m 
up there. When I do, I just add them to the list and 
work on coming up with responses for them.
Head First: I see. So you’re constantly updating 
your list of risks.
Stick Figure: Yes! We call it a risk register. 
Whenever I have new information, I put it there. 
It means that I can actually hang out on these cliffs 
with a lot of confidence. Because, while you can’t 
guarantee that nothing will go wrong, you can be 
prepared for whatever comes your way.
Head First: That’s a lot of work. Does it really 
make a difference?
Stick Figure: Absolutely! I’d never be able to sleep 
at night knowing that I could fall off the cliff at any 
time. But I’ve planned for the risks, and I’ve taken 
steps to stay safe…and I sleep like a baby.
don’t let “risk” become a four-letter word!

You can’t plan for every risk 
at the start of the project 
Even the best planning can’t predict 
everything—there’s always a chance that 
a new risk could crop up that you hadn’t 
thought about. That’s why you need to 
constantly monitor how your project is 
doing compared to your risk register. If a 
new risk happens, you have a good chance 
of catching it before it causes serious 
trouble. When it comes to risk, the earlier 
you can react, the better for everybody. 
And that’s what the Control Risks 
process is all about.
There have been 
reports of bears 
causing problems 
for people around 
here lately. Be 
careful out here. 
The park ranger’s come 
by to let you know 
about some recent bear 
sightings on this cliff. 
The risk register doesn’t say 
anything about handling bears. 
Looks like this is a new 
risk altogether…

588    Chapter 11
control your risks
Control Risks is another change control process 
Risk responses are treated just like changes. You monitor the project in every 
status meeting to see how the risks in the risk register are affecting it. If you need 
to implement a risk response, you take it to your change control board, because it 
amounts to a change that will affect your project constraints. 
Risk monitoring 
should be done 
at every status 
meeting.
You should keep 
monitoring your 
risks at every 
meeting until the 
project is closed.
You should review status 
reports, metrics, and other 
work outputs to see if risks 
are happening.
You compare all of your actual 
data to your plans using the risk 
register and the PM plan.

project risk management
How to control your risks
Controlling risks means keeping your finger on the pulse of the project. If you 
are constantly reviewing all of the data your project is producing, you will be able 
to react quickly if a new risk is uncovered, or if it looks like one of your response 
strategies needs to spring into action. Without careful monitoring, even your best 
plans won’t get implemented in time to save your project if a risk happens. 
Risk reassessment 
You should have some regularly scheduled reassessment meetings 
to go over all of the information you have to date and see if your 
risk register still holds true. In a reassessment, your main goal is to 
find any new risks that have come up. That’s why it’s important to 
reassess your risk register every so often, and be sure that all of the 
risks in it are still the right ones. 
Variance and trend analysis
Comparing the actual project performance to the plan is a great 
way to tell if a risk might be happening. If you find that you’re 
significantly over budget or behind schedule, a risk could have 
cropped up that you didn’t take into account. Looking for trends in 
your defects or schedule variance, for example, might show patterns 
that indicate that risks have occurred before you would have found 
that out on your own. 
Reserve analysis
Just like you keep running tabs on your budget, you should always 
know how much money you have set aside for risk response. As 
you spend it, be sure to subtract it so you know if you have enough 
to cover all of your remaining risks. If you start to see that your 
reserves are running low and there are still a lot of risks being 
identified, you might be in trouble. Keeping tabs on your reserves 
means that you will always know if you need to set aside more funds 
or make different choices about how to handle risks as they come up.
Sometimes this kind of reserve is called 
a “contingency”—because its use is 
contingent on a certain risk happening.

risk monitoring
More control risk tools and techniques 
There are just a few more tools in the Control Risks process. They’re all 
focused on finding new risks if they crop up, dealing with changes to the risks 
you’ve already planned for, and responding quickly to risks you know how to 
handle. 
Risk audits are when you have an outside party come 
in and take a look at your risk response strategies to judge 
how effective they are. Sometimes risk audits will point 
out better ways of handling a specific risk so that you can 
change your response strategy going forward. 
Technical performance measurement means 
comparing the performance of your project with its planned 
performance. So if you expected to hit a specific milestone, you 
could check performance information on your product at that time 
to see if it measured up to the plan. If not, that might indicate that 
there are risks you didn’t plan for. 
Meetings are the most important way to keep the team up to 
date on risk planning—so important that they should happen 
throughout the entire project. The more you talk about risks 
with the team, the better. Every single status meeting should have 
risk review on the agenda. Status meetings are a really important 
way of noticing when things might go wrong, and of making sure 
that you implement your response strategy in time. It’s also possible 
that you could come across a new opportunity by talking to the team. 
Never stop looking 
for new risks and 
adapting your 
strategies for 
dealing with them.
Auditors will also look at how 
effective your overall processes 
for risk planning are.

risks that have been causing trouble on your 
project.

prepare for the unknown
Q: Why do I need to ask about risks at 
every status meeting?
A: Because a risk could crop up at any 
time, and you need to be prepared. The 
better you prepare for risks, the more secure 
your project is against the unknown. That’s 
also why the triggers and watchlists are 
really important. When you meet with your 
team, you should figure out if a trigger for a 
risk response has happened. And you should 
check your watchlist to make sure none of 
your low-priority risks have materialized.

For the test, you need to know that status 
meetings aren’t just a place for you to sit and 
ask each member of your team to tell you 
his or her status. Instead, you use them to 
figure out decisions that need to be made to 
keep the project on track or to head off any 
problems that might be coming up. In your 
status meetings, you need to discuss all of 
the issues that involve the whole team and 
come up with solutions to any new problems 
you encounter. So, it makes sense that you 
would use your status meetings to talk about 
your risk register and make sure that it is 
always up to date with the latest information. 
Q:  I still don’t get trend analysis. How 
does it help me find risks?
A:  It’s easy to miss risks in your project—
sometimes all the meetings in the world 
won’t help your team see some of them. 
That’s why a tool like trend analysis can be 
really useful. Remember the control chart 
from Chapter 8? This is really similar, and 
it’s just as valuable. It’s just a way to see if 
things are happening that you did not plan 
for.
Q: Hey, didn’t you talk about risks 
back in the Time Management chapter 
too?
A: Wow—it’s great that you remembered 
that! The main thing to remember about risks 
from Chapter 6 is that having a very long 
critical path or, even worse, multiple critical 
paths means you have a riskier project. The 
riskiest is when all of the activities are on the 
critical path. That means that a delay to even 
one activity can derail your whole project. 
Q: Shouldn’t I ask the sponsor about 
risks to the project?
A: Actually the best people to ask about 
risks are the project team itself. The sponsor 
knows why the project is needed and how 
much money is available for it, but from 
there, it’s really up to the team to manage 
risks. Since you are the ones doing the work, 
it makes sense that you would have a better 
idea of what has gone wrong on similar 
projects and what might go wrong on this 
one. Identify Risks, Perform Qualitative and 
Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk 
Responses are some of the most valuable 
contributions the team makes to the project. 
They can be the difference between making 
the sponsor happy and having to do a lot of 
apologizing.
Q: Why do we do risk audits?
A: Risk audits are when you have 
someone from outside your project come in 
and review your risk register—your risks and 
your risk responses—to make sure you got 
it right. The reason we do it is because risks 
are so important that getting a new set of 
eyes on them is worth the time.
Q: Hold on, didn’t we already talk 
about reserves way back in the Cost 
Control chapter? Why is it coming up 
here?
A: That’s right, back in Chapter 7 we 
talked about a management reserve, which 
is money set aside to handle any unknown 
costs that come up on the project. That’s 
a different kind of reserve than the one for 
controlling risks. The kind of reserve used 
for risks is called a contingency reserve, 
because its use is contingent on a risk 
actually materializing.

Project managers sometimes talk about both 
kinds of reserves together, because they 
both have to show up on the same budget. 
When they do, you’ll sometimes hear talk of 
“known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns.” 
The management reserve is for unknown 
unknowns—things that you haven’t planned 
for but could impact your project. The 
contingency reserve is for known unknowns, 
or risks that you know about and explicitly 
planned for and put in your risk register.
The better you 
prepare for risks, 
the more secure 
your project 
is against the 
unknown.

Question Clinic: The “which-is-NOT” question
You’ll see some questions on the 
exam that list inputs, outputs, tools, or 
concepts and ask you to determine which one of 
them is not part of the group. Usually, you can 
figure them out by going through the answer 
choices one by one and eliminating the one that 
doesn’t belong.
This one is definitely a quantitative 
analysis technique. Multiplying 
probability with the value of positive 
and negative outcomes of the project 
is all about putting numbers to risk.
Remember reading something about 
Monte Carlo back in Chapter 6? It 
might be right…right? But wait, it’s 
also a tool for using random numbers 
to model out possible risks on the 
project. It’s definitely part of 
quantitative analysis.
D’s definitely the right answer. It’s about 
numbers, but it isn’t concerned with 
assigning numbers to the risk. It’s about 
keeping tabs on the contingency reserve 
when risks materialize, so it’s a Monitoring 
and Controlling process. This has to be it!
Take your time 
answering 
which-is-NOT 
questions.
Take your time and think your 
way through it. All of them will 
have something in common but one. 
As long as you remember the 
group you’re fitting them into, 
you won’t have any trouble.

Take a look at this table of risks.
1. Calculate the EMV for each of these three risks.
2. If these are the only risks on the project, calculate the total EMV.
3. The latest weather report came out, and  there is now a 20% chance of unseasonably 
warm weather. What’s the new EMV for the project?
4. Now the cost of replacement rations goes up to $150. What’s the new EMV for the 
project?
You’ll need to know how to do EMV calculations for the test. Give 
them a shot now—they’re pretty easy once you get the hang of 
them.
Navigation equipment failure: 15% x –  300 = – 45.00
Unseasonably warm weather: 8% x 500 = 40.00
Wild animals eat rations: 10% x – 100 = – 10.00
Don’t forget to use a 
positive value here because 
it’s an opportunity, not a 
threat.
Total EMV = - 45.00 + 40.00 + – 10.00 = – 15.00
You get the total EMV 
by adding up the EMV 
for each risk.
Unseasonably warm weather: 20% x 500 = 100.00
The new total EMV = – 45.00 + 100.00 + – 10.00 = 45.00
The EMV is 
now positive, 
which means the 
project should 
cost less than 
you originally 
budgeted.
Wild animals eat rations: 10% x – 150 = – 15.00
The new total EMV = – 45.00 + 100.00 + – 15.00 = 40.00

1. You hear a weather report that says there’s now a 45% chance of high winds. Does it still make sense 
to buy the heavier tent?
2. If you don’t buy the heavier tent, then you have room to take along a wind generator that can power 
your equipment, and that will save you $1,100 in portable batteries if there’s a heavy wind. If there’s 
still a 45% chance of high winds, does it still make sense to buy the heavier tent? 
EMV of choosing the heavier tent: – 350 plus  (45% x – 48) plus (55% x – 10) = – 377.10
EMV of choosing the lighter tent: – 130 plus  (45% x – 953) plus (55% x – 15) = – 567.10
It still makes sense to choose the heavier tent.
EMV of choosing the heavier tent: – 350 plus  (45% x – 48) plus (55% x – 10) = – 377.10
EMV of choosing the lighter tent: – 130 plus  (45% x 147) plus (55% x – 15) = – 72.10
Now it makes sense to choose the lighter tent.
So where did this $147 come from? Well, if 
there’s a heavy wind, then the generator turns 
this into an opportunity. You’ll still see $953 in 
equipment damage, but that’s offset by the 
$1,100 in savings for portable batteries. That 
puts you ahead by $147—but only if there’s a 
heavy wind!
When the probability of high 
winds changed to 45%, then the 
probability of low winds also 
changed: to 55%.

do the other half and then trade your findings with each other. 
There’s a high probability of water damage to some of your 
equipment, so you buy insurance to avoid losses.
There’s always the chance that someone could make a mistake and 
fall off the cliff. No matter how much you plan for the unexpected,

1. Answer: B
Sharing is when a project manager figures out a way to use an opportunity to help not just her project but 
another project or person as well.
2. Answer: D
Confronting is a conflict resolution technique. 
3. Answer: A
You use an RBS to figure out and organize your risk categories even before you start to identify them.  Then 
you decompose the categories into individual risks as part of Identify Risks.
4. Answer: B
Your risk register should include watchlists of low-priority risks, and you should review those risks at every 
status meeting to make sure that none of them have occurred.
5. Answer: C
The expected monetary value (or EMV) of the weather risk is the probability (30%) times the cost ($12,000), 
but don’t forget that since it’s a risk, that number should be negative. So its EMV is 30% x –$12,000 = –$3,600. 
The building materials opportunity has an EMV of 20% x $5,000 = $1,000. Add them up and you get –$3,600 + 
$1,000 = –$2,600.
6. Answer: C
Using the Delphi technique, experts supply their opinions of risks 
for your project anonymously so that they each get a chance to 
think about the project without influencing each other. 
Common sense would tell you that 
the answer is D, but brainstorming 
doesn’t have to be anonymous. So, 
it’s got to be Delphi.

Wow, did you see that huge red herring?
7. Answer: B
Susan bought an insurance policy to cover cost overruns due to weather. She transferred the risk from her 
company to the insurance company.
8. Answer: B
You wouldn’t want to transfer an opportunity to someone else! You always want to find a way to use that 
opportunity for the good of the project. That’s why the response strategies for opportunities are all about 
figuring out ways to use the opportunity to improve your project (or another, in the case of sharing).
9. Answer: B
A secondary risk is a risk that could happen because of your response to another risk.
10. Answer: D
The processes of Risk Management are organized around creating the risk register, and updating it as part 
of project documents updates.
11. Answer: B
$200,000 x 0.70 = $140,000 savings, and $100,000 x 0.30 = -$30,000 expenses.  Add them together and 
you get $110,000. 
12. Answer: B
Contingency reserves are calculated during Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis based on the risks you’ve 
identified. You can think of a risk as a “known unknown”—an uncertain event that you know about, but 
which may not happen—and you can add contingency reserves to your budget in order to handle them. 
Management reserves are part of Cost Management—you use them to build a reserve into your budget for 
any unknown events that happen.
The key to this one is to remember that the 
money the project makes is positive, and the 
money it will cost is negative.
That’s why it’s useful to figure out the 
EMV for a risk—so you know how big your 
contingency reserve should be.

13. Answer: D
Risk monitoring and response is so important that you should go through your risk register at every status 
meeting!
14. Answer: D
The Probability and Impact matrix is a tool that you use to analyze risks. You might find it in your Project 
Management plan, but it’s not included in the risk register.
15. Answer: A
It’s really important that you get the entire team involved in the Identify Risks process. The more people who 
look for risks, the more likely it is that you’ll find the ones that will actually occur on your project.
16. Answer: D
Even though this looks a little wordy, it’s just another EMV question. The probability of the risk is 50%, and the 
cost is –$650, so multiply the two and you get –$325.
17. Answer: A
This is just the definition of Monte Carlo analysis. That’s where you use a computer simulation to see what 
different random probability and impact values do to your project.
18. Answer: D
There are some risks that you just can’t do anything about. When that happens, you have to accept them. But 
at least you can warn your stakeholders about the risk, so nobody is caught off guard.

19. Answer: D
You’ve got an unplanned event that’s happened on your project. Is that a risk? No. It’s a project problem, and 
you need to solve that problem. Your Probability and Impact matrix won’t help, because the probability of this 
happening is 100%—it’s already happened. No amount of risk planning will prevent or mitigate the risk. And 
there’s no sense in trying to take preventive actions, because there’s no way you can prevent it. So the best 
you can do is start looking for a new part supplier.
20. Answer: C
It’s a good idea to bring in someone from outside of 
your project to review your risks. The auditor can make 
sure that each risk response is appropriate and really 
addresses the root causes of each risk.
I see-this wasn’t 
a risk at all, it was 
just a problem that came 
up during the project. I 
bet better risk planning 
might have helped the 
team prepare for this!

Some jobs are just too big for your company to do on its 
own.  Even when the job isn’t too big, it may just be that you don’t have the expertise

Kate’s last project went really well. In fact, maybe a little too well. The company’s

spend a long time on hold, and that’s not good for the company.

Calling in the cavalry
Kate: No problem. The hard part will be figuring out how to 
manage the transition. Are we going to try to expand the team 
immediately, or call in a supplier to help us out?
Ben: Whoa, hold on there! Is going outside the company even 
an option?
Kate: Look, our tech support team is already at full capacity, 
and it’ll take months to upgrade the facilities to handle more 
people…not to mention to hire and train the staff. We may be 
able to handle it ourselves, but there’s a good chance that the 
easiest way to get the job done is to go outside our company to 
find a vendor to do the work.
Ben: But isn’t it kind of risky thinking about working with 
another company? I mean, what if it goes out of business during 
our project? Or what if it costs too much?
Kate: Well, we’ll need to make sure that we answer those 
questions. But this isn’t the first time our company’s brought on a 
contractor like this. The legal department has done this kind of 
thing before. I’ll set up a meeting with somebody over there and 
see if they can help us out.
Ben: OK, you can follow up on that. But I’m still not sure about 
this.
We’ve got a new 
project for you, Kate. We 
figure it’s going to take about 
18 months to ramp up the new 
tech support call center. Can 
you handle it?
Sometimes you need to hire an outside company to do 
some of your project work. That’s called procurement, 
and the outside company is called the seller.

but i’m not a lawyer
Wait a minute. I’m 
not a lawyer. Why should I 
have to know a bunch of details 
about contracting?
You need to be involved because it’s your 
project, and you’re responsible for it.
One of the most common mistakes people make on 
the exam (and in real life) is to assume that if another 
company is selling products or services for your project 
and they don’t deliver, it’s not your problem. After all, 
you’ve got a contract with the company, right? So if they 
don’t deliver, they won’t get paid.
Well, it’s not that simple. Yes, there are plenty of sellers 
who fail to deliver on their agreements. But for each 
seller that doesn’t deliver, there’s a frustrated project 
manager whose project ran into trouble because of it. 
That’s why a lot of the Procurement Management tools 
and techniques are focused on selecting the right seller 
and communicating exactly what you’ll need to the 
people doing the work.
The PMP exam is based on contracting 
laws and customs in the United States.
Are you used to working in a country that ISN’T the 
U.S.? Then you should be especially careful about 
these processes. You may be used to working with 
agreements in a way that isn’t exactly the same as how they’ll 
work on the exam questions. Luckily, the U.S. government 
publishes a lot of information on contracting at http://www.

What should Kate do to figure out if it’s really a good idea to contract the work?
Ask the legal expert
Thanks for coming by, Steve. We’re looking for a contractor to handle 
tech support while we bring on more people in our call center. How 
do we normally handle this stuff?
Here’s how it usually works. I’ll actually write the contract and do 
the negotiation. But before I do that, I’ll need to sit down with you to 
understand what the contract has to accomplish.
Kate: So I’m not involved at all?
Steve: Oh, you’re definitely involved. You need to help with the 
negotiations, because you’re the only person who really understands 
what we’re trying to accomplish with the contract.
Kate: OK, that makes sense. So when do we get started?
Steve: Well, not so fast. We need to be really sure that the way 
we pick our vendors is absolutely fair. We’ve got some company 
guidelines that you’ll need to follow. And once we’ve got the contract 
signed and the work is under way, we’ll need to meet to make sure 
the contract is really being followed. And if there’s a problem and we 
need to negotiate a change to the contract, you’ll need me to do it.
Kate: OK, I can handle that. So should I start working on 
something to send out to sellers?
Steve: Not quite. Before we even get started with all of that, are you

procurement management processes
Anatomy of an agreement
Procurement is pretty intuitive, and the four Procurement Management processes follow a 
really sensible order. First you plan what you need to contract; then you plan how you’ll do it. Next, 
you send out your contract requirements to sellers. They bid for the chance to work with you. You 
pick the best one, and then you sign the contract with them. Once the work begins, you monitor it 
to make sure the contract is being followed. When the work is done, you close out the contract and 
fill out all the paperwork. 
Plan Procurement Management Here’s where 
you take a close look at your needs, to be sure that you 
really need to create a contract. You figure out what 
kinds of contracts make sense for your project, and you 
try to define all of the parts of your project that will be 
contracted out.  
You’ll need to plan out each individual contract for the 
project work and work out how you’ll manage it. That 
means figuring out what metrics it will need to meet to be 
considered successful, how you’ll pick a seller, and how 
you’ll administer the contract once the work is happening. 
Conduct Procurements
This process is all about getting the word out 
to potential agreement or contract partners 
about the project and how they can help you. 
You hold bidder conferences and find 
qualified sellers that can do the work.  
Next, you evaluate all of the responses to your 
procurement documents and find the seller 
that suits your needs the best. When you find 
them, you sign the contract, and then the work 
can begin.

When the contract is under

and make sure the contract is 
adhered to. You monitor what 
the contractor is producing and 
make sure everything is running 
smoothly. Occasionally, you’ll 
need to make changes to the 
contract. Here’s where you’ll find 
and request those changes. 
Close Procurements
When the work is done, 
you’ll close your contract

contract, and that the 
contractor gets paid.

The first Procurement Management process is Plan Procurement 
Management. It’s a familiar planning process, and you use it to plan out 
all of your procurement activities for the project. The other three processes 
are done for every contract. Here’s an example. Say you’re managing a 
construction project, and you’ve got one contract with an electrician and 
another one with a plumber. That means you’ll go through those three 
processes two separate times, once for each contractor.
The work performance information tells you if there are problems 
with your agreement—so Control Procurements is just like any other 
Monitoring and Controlling process.

plan your procurement
Start with a plan for the whole project
You need to think about all of the work that you will contract out for 
your project before you do anything else. The Plan Procurement 
Management process is all about figuring that out, and writing 
up a plan for how you’ll do it.
Make or buy analysis means figuring out 
whether or not you should be contracting the work 
or doing it yourself. It could also mean deciding 
whether to build your own solution to your problem 
or buy one that is already available. Most of the same 
factors that help you make every other major project 
decision will help you with this one. How much does 
it cost to build it versus buy it? How will this decision 
affect the scope of your project? How about your 
project schedule? Do you have time to do the work 
and still meet your commitments? As you plan out 
what you will and won’t contract, you need to have 
thought through your reasoning pretty carefully.
There are some resources (like heavy equipment) 
that your company can buy, rent, or lease depending 
on the situation. You’ll need to examine leasing 
versus buying costs and determine the best way to go 
forward.
Your cost estimates and your 
schedule play a big part in how you 
plan out your procurement.
Your resource requirements  
and requirements document 
tell you a lot about the 
work you need to do and 
how this contract will fit 
into it. 
You need to consider the level of 
expertise your company has with the 
product or work you’re thinking of 
contracting, as well as the job and 
contracting markets you operate in.

Expert judgment means asking someone who’s made 
the same kind of decision before to help you look at all 
the information you have for your project and make the 
right decision. Experts can be really helpful in evaluating 
technology, or providing insight into how your work might 
be done in different sourcing scenarios. 
Market research You will want to check out reviews 
of possible vendors to work with.  Sometimes procurement 
teams will go to conferences or read published reports 
that evaluate vendors doing similar contracts to help make 
decisions. 
Meetings help your team put their heads together and 
make sure they’re covering all of the project’s needs when 
setting up a procurement.  
After doing your make 
or buy analysis, you write 
down what you learned 
so that other people 
understand your rationale. 
This plan will have:
•	The planned delivery dates for the work or products you 
are contracting
•	The company’s standard documents you will use
•	The contract types you plan to use, and any metrics that 
will be used to measure the contractor’s performance
•	Any constraints or assumptions you need to know about all 
of the contracts you plan to create for your project

make or buy?
Because sometimes it’s not worth having your 
team do part of  the job.
If your company needed to renovate your office, would you hire 
the carpenter, electrician, and builders? Would you buy the power 
tools, cement mixer, trucks, and ladders? Of course not. You’d 
hire a contractor to do the work, because it would cost too much 
to buy all that stuff for one job, and you wouldn’t want to hire 
people just for the job and then fire them when it was done. Well, 
the same goes for a lot of jobs on your projects. You don’t always 
want to have your company build everything. There are a lot of 
jobs where you want to hire a seller.
It’s natural to feel a little nervous 
about this contracting stuff.
A lot of project managers have only 
ever worked with teams inside their own 
companies. All this talk of contracts, lawyers, proposals, 
bids, and conferences can be intimidating if you’ve never 
seen it before. But don’t worry. Managing a project with a 
contractor is really similar to managing one that uses your 
company’s employees. There are just a few new tools and 
techniques that you need to learn…but they’re not hard, and 
you’ll definitely get the hang of them really quickly.
Relax
There are a lot of words 
for the company you’re 
hiring: contractor, consultant, 
external company…but 
for the PMP exam, you’ll 
typically see the term “seller.”
I still don’t buy it. Why 
should I go outside of my 
company? Why can’t I just have 
my team do all the work?

Our estimate is that it will 
cost around $30,000 per month 
to hire an additional 10 people 
and reduce wait time to 10 
minutes per call. The cheapest 
contract for this is around 
$40,000 per month.

The cost for equipment and training 
for a 10-person team is around 
$50,000. Contracts could be drawn up 
to cut that cost down a lot.
We think the procurement 
process will take around 
three months, and ramping

will take eight months.
It might be hard to control the

Contracting companies who specialize

could make the project go more smoothly.

The decision is made
Doing make or buy analysis just means understanding the reasons for 
the contract and deciding whether or not to contract out the work. Once 
you’ve done that, if you still think contracting is an option, then you should 
have a good idea of what you need to get out of the contracting process. 
Sounds good. What kind of 
contract are we looking at?
Steve, I’ve taken a really close look at 
this, and I think it makes sense to find a seller 
to handle some of our technical support for 
us. If they take over the second shift for a few 
months, that’ll give us time to ramp up our own 
team and add phone capacity.

626    Chapter 12
pick the right contract
Types of contractual agreements
It’s a good idea to know a little bit about the most commonly used 
contract types. They can help you come up with a contract that 
will give both you and the seller the best chance of success. 
Fixed price contracts
Fixed price (FP) means that you are going to pay one amount regardless of how much it costs the 
contractor to do the work. A fixed-price contract only makes sense in cases where the scope is very well known. 
If there are any changes to the amount of work to be done, the seller doesn’t get paid any more to do it. 
Fixed price plus incentive fee (FPIF) means that you are going to pay a fixed price for the 
contract and give a bonus based on some performance goal. You might set up a contract where the team gets 
a $50,000 bonus if they manage to deliver an acceptable product before the contracted date. If the fixed-price 
contract does not include a fee, it’s often referred to as a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract.
Cost-reimbursable contracts
Costs plus fixed fee (CPFF) means what it says. You pay the seller back for the costs involved in 
doing the work, plus you agree to an amount that you will pay on top of that. 
Costs plus award fee (CPAF) is similar to the CPFF contract, except that instead of paying a fee on 
top of the costs, you agree to pay a fee based on the buyer’s evaluation of the seller’s performance.
Costs plus incentive fee (CPIF) means you’ll reimburse costs on the project and pay a fee if some 
performance goals are met. Kate could set up her project using this contract type by suggesting that the team 
will get a $50,000  bonus if they keep the average wait time for the calls down to seven minutes per customer 
for over a month. If she were on a CPIF contract, she would pay the team their costs for doing the work, and 
also the $50,000 bonus when they met that goal.
 
Time and materials
Time and materials (T&M) is used in labor contracts. It means that you will pay a rate for each of the 
people working on your project plus their materials costs. The “time” part means that the buyer pays a fixed 
rate for labor—usually a certain number of dollars per hour. And the “materials” part means that the buyer 
also pays for materials, equipment, office space, administrative overhead costs, and anything else that has to be 
paid for. The seller typically purchases those things and bills the buyer for them. This is a really good contract 
to use if you don’t know exactly how long your contract will last, because it protects both the buyer and seller.
Some PMP exam questions might just 
refer to a contract type by its acronym 
(FP, CPFF, etc.).
Don’t worry about trying to cram these into your head right now—
you’ll get a lot of practice with them throughout the chapter.
If you want to see a really thorough overview of 
the different types of contracts, check out the 
U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation website:
http://www.acquisition.gov/far/
Even if your project has several contracts, they don’t all have to be the 
same type. That’s why you need to administer each one separately.
A lot of people say that the T&M contract is a lot like 
a combination of a cost-plus and fixed-price contract, 
because you pay a fixed price per hour for labor, but on 
top of that you pay for costs like in a cost-plus contract.

There are advantages and disadvantages to every kind of 
contract. Different kinds of contracts carry different risks to both 
the buyer and seller. Can you think of some of them?
This is a tough one—take 
your time and think about

Here’s a hint: FP contracts don’t

not the buyer. Can you figure out why?

know your contracts
There are a lot of right answers—even if yours 
aren’t here, it doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.
A fixed-price contract has 
a lot more risk for the seller 
than the buyer.
A lot of T&M contracts include a “cost not to exceed” 
clause to make sure this doesn’t happen. If the contract 
doesn’t have this, it can get really risky for the buyer!
CPFF contracts have risks for both 
the buyer and the seller.
CPAF contracts are risky for the sellers, because the 
buyer subjectively determines their performance, and 
can decide they didn’t perform well enough.
Incentive fees are a really good way to reduce the risk 
to the buyer on a cost-plus contract.
The only risk is if the seller doesn’t deliver because of costs.
Unexpected costs could be bigger than the contract itself.
There’s still not much risk to the buyer in fixed-price contracts.
The seller still has the same risks as FP, but may make more.
If the costs are too high, the buyer will have to pay a lot more.
A fixed fee on top of costs might not be worth it for the seller.
There aren’t many risks to the buyer.
If the buyer determines the seller underperformed, he can withhold the fee.
There’s still a risk of cost overruns, but it’s not as bad.
If costs are too high, the contract could get expensive.
The incentive fee isn’t guaranteed, so it might not be paid.
The contract might not cover high overhead costs.
Take a minute and try to figure out why the T&M contract is a 
really good choice if you don’t know how long the job will last.
There are advantages and disadvantages to every kind of 
contract. Different kinds of contracts carry different risks to both 
the buyer and seller. Can you think of some of them?

More about contracts
There are just a few more things you need to know about any contract to do procurement work.
Every contract needs to outline the work to be done and the payment for 
that work.
•	
You might see an exam question that mentions “consideration”—that’s just another word for the 
payment.
•	
Remember in Risk Management how you used insurance to transfer risk to another company? You 
did that using a special kind of contract called an insurance policy.
•	
You might get a question that asks about force majeure. This is a kind of clause that you’ll see 
in a contract. It says that if something like a war, riot, or natural disaster happens, you’re excused 
from the terms of the contract.
Always pay attention to the point of  total assumption.
•	
The point of total assumption is the point at which the seller assumes the costs. In a fixed-
price contract, this is the point where the costs have gotten so large that the seller basically runs out 
of money from the contract and has to start paying the costs.
You should always make sure both the buyer and seller are satisfied.
•	
When you negotiate a contract, you should make sure that the buyer and the seller both feel 
comfortable with the terms of the contract. You don’t want the people at the seller’s company to 
feel like they got a raw deal—after all, you’re depending on them to do good work for your project.
1. If they handle the extra work within the company instead of finding a seller, it will cost an extra $35,000 in 
overtime and $11,000 in training costs in total, on top of the $4,400 per person per month for the five-person team 
needed to do the extra support work. What’s the total cost of keeping the work within the company?
2. Kate and Ben talked to a few companies and estimate that it will cost $20,000 per month to hire another company 
to do the work, but they’ll also need to spend $44,000 in setup costs. What will contracting the work cost?
3. So does it make more sense to make or buy? Why?
Answers on page 650.
You might see this kind of question about whether to make or buy. Here’s 
a chance to get a little more practice with making contract decisions.

630    Chapter 12
how will you evaluate each seller?
Figure out how you’ll sort out potential sellers
The two big outputs of Plan Procurement are the procurement documents and 
source selection criteria. The procurement documents are what you’ll use to find 
potential sellers who want your business. The source selection criteria are what 
you’ll use to figure out which sellers you want to use.
You always put together procurement documents and source selection criteria 
before you start talking to individual sellers who want your business.
There are a bunch of  different documents you might want to 
send to sellers who want to bid on your work.
You’ll usually include the procurement statement of work (SOW) so that 
sellers know exactly what work is involved.
An invitation for bid (IFB) is a document that tells sellers that you want them 
to submit proposals. You’ll also hear of people using requests for information 
(RFI) and requests for proposals (RFP). 
There’s another kind of invitation—an invitation for quote (IFQ). This is a 
way to tell sellers that you want them to give you a quote on a fixed-price contract 
to do the work.
A purchase order is something you’ll send out to a seller who you know that you 
want to work with. It’s an agreement to pay for certain goods or services.
In some cases you’ll want to allow for more flexibility in your contract. If you’re 
hiring a seller to build something for you that you’ve never built before, you’ll often 
encourage them to help you set the scope instead of locking it down.
Decide in advance on how you want to select the sellers.
There are a lot of ways you can select a potential seller. Figuring out if a 
seller is appropriate for your work is something that takes a lot of talking and 
thinking—and there’s no single, one-size-fits-all way of selecting sellers. But 
there are some things that you should definitely look for in any seller:
•	
Can the seller actually do the work you need done? 
•	
How much will the seller charge?
•	
Can the seller cover any costs and expenses necessary to do the job?
•	
Are there subcontractors involved that you need to know about?
•	
Does the seller really understand everything in the SOW and contract?
•	
Is the seller’s project management capability up to the task?
A big part of Procurement 
Management is making sure that 
both the buyers and sellers are 
treated fairly. Writing out source 
selection criteria beforehand is a 
good way to make sure each seller 
gets a fair shake.
You’d be amazed at how 
many sellers respond to bids 
that they have no business 
responding to. You definitely 
need to make sure the seller 
has the skill and capacity to 
do the work you need.

Get in touch with potential sellers
The next step in procurement is pretty straightforward. You use 
the Conduct Procurements process to, well, get the word 
out to sellers and see what kind of responses you get.  Once you 
narrow down your list of sellers to a few who look like they might 
be good candidates, you evaluate all of their responses against 
your source selection criteria and choose the vendor you’re 
going to work with. All that’s left to do after that is to get it all on 
paper…and then you award the contract!

The make or buy decisions you made 
will come in handy because they’ll tell 
you what you need to find a contractor 
to help out with and what you’ll do 
yourself. 
Use outputs from the Plan Procurement 
Management process to find the right seller
When you perform the Conduct Procurements process, you’ll start with 
some of the outputs you created in Plan Procurement Management. 
Here’s how you’ll use them:
Use the source selection criteria to 
evaluate the sellers that respond to you.  
By evaluating all of your sellers using 
the same criteria, you’ll be sure that 
you evaluate everyone fairly and find 
the right seller for your company. 
Procurement documents will have all of 
the information that you’ll actually give to 
potential sellers to help them bid on your 
contract.  Two of the most commonly 
used procurement documents are the RFI 
and the RFP. 
RFI: Request for information 
documents are sent to potential sellers to 
ask for information about their capability 
to do the work.
RFP: Request for proposal is when 
you give a seller the opportunity to 
examine your procurement documents 
and write up a proposal of how they’d do 
the work. 
The procurement statement of work 
is where you write out all of the work 
that needs to be done by a contractor. 
It tells you the scope of the work that 
you’re going to contract to another 
company.

Pick a partner
You’ve figured out what services you want to procure, and you’ve gone out and 
found a list of potential sellers. Now it’s time to choose one of them to do the 
project work—and that’s exactly what you do in Conduct Procurements.
Analytical techniques
You’ll need to determine whether or not the vendor is capable of completing the 
project in the required time frame and understand how well it can deliver to your 
budget. If you check out its track record on past projects, you’ll have a better 
sense of how it’ll perform. 
Independent estimates
A lot of the time, you don’t have the 
expertise in your company to figure 
out whether or not a seller is quoting 
you a fair price. That’s why you’ll 
often turn to a third party to come 
up with an estimate of what the 
work should cost.
Expert judgment
Here’s another case where it’s really 
good to bring in someone from 
outside your project to help evaluate 
each proposal. You should bring 
in someone with a lot of specific 
expertise in the work being done to 
make sure the seller is up to the job.

to do that is to get them all in a room 
together, so that they can ask questions 
about your contract. That way, you 
don’t give any one seller an advantage 
by providing inside information that 
the other sellers don’t have access to.
Advertising
Sometimes the best way to get in 
touch with sellers is to place an ad. 
Also, sometimes you are required 
to take out an ad (like for some 
government‑funded projects), in 
order to give all sellers full notice.

Procurement negotiation
When you send out a package of procurement documents to a 
potential seller, it usually has some information about the contract 
you want to sign: the type of contract, some of the terms, maybe 
some rough calculations and estimates of the total costs, and 
other numbers. But not all sellers will want to sign that particular 
contract, even ones who you’ll eventually want to work with. 
That’s why you need to negotiate the terms of the contract.
This is one of those times where your company’s lawyers will 
probably do most of the talking—but that doesn’t mean you’re 
not a critical part of the process. Your job is to provide the 
expertise and in-depth understanding. After all, you’re the one 
who understands your project and your project’s needs better than 
anyone else. 
When Kate selects a seller, she’ll need to help her company’s legal team negotiate the terms 
of the contract. Which type of contract do you think is right for Kate’s project?
Proposal evaluation techniques
You’re going to have to work closely with the seller to figure out 
if his proposal really is appropriate for the work. You need to be 
very careful before you choose someone to do the work. That’s 
what this tool is for—it’s a kind of “catch-all” that’s there to 
remind you that there’s no single way to evaluate a proposal. You 
need to look at the whole picture—the seller, your needs, and the 
job.
Resource 
calendars
Finally! Everyone’s signed on 
the dotted line, and you’ve 
got your contract.
In the course of selecting a source, you 
might find changes that need to be made 
to your requirements or other documents.
The whole point of the 
Conduct Procurements 
process is, well, to conduct 
procurements…and here 
they are. Along with the 
contract, this is the most 
important output of the 
process.
If your contract 
makes some of the

Q:  Do I always need to hold a bidder 
conference whenever I do procurement?
A: No, you don’t always need a bidder 
conference. Sometimes your company has a 
preferred supplier who you always deal with, 
so you don’t have to advertise for sellers. 
And sometimes there’s a sole source for a 
particular service or part—there may only be 
one company that provides it. In that case, 
advertising and bidder conferences would be 
pointless.

The bidder conference has two goals. The 
first is to make sure that you answer all of 
the questions from potential sellers. But the 
other is to make sure that all potential sellers 
are treated equally and have access to the 
same information.
Q: I’m still not clear on why I’d want to 
use a cost-plus contract.
A: One of the best reasons to use a cost-
plus contract is to make sure that the seller 
you’re working with doesn’t end up getting a 
raw deal. A fixed-price contract can be pretty 
risky for a seller. When the seller uses a 
cost-plus contract—like a cost plus incentive 
fee, or cost plus fixed fee—it means that 
there’s a built-in guarantee that the seller 
won’t have to swallow cost overruns. If 
you’re reasonably certain that the costs 
can be contained, or if you set up a good 
incentive system, then a cost plus contract 
can be a really good one for making sure 
that both the buyer and seller are treated 
fairly.
Q: Why all this talk about treating the 
seller fairly? I’m trying to get the best 
deal I can. Doesn’t that mean I should try 
to get as many concessions from sellers 
as possible?
A: One of the most important parts of 
procurement is that both the buyer and 
seller should feel like they’re getting a good 
deal. You should never expect a seller to 
have to take on a bad contract. After all, 
you’re depending on the seller to deliver a 
necessary piece of your project. That’s why 
the goal in any procurement should always 
be for the buyer and seller to both feel like 
they were treated fairly.
Q: How do I use organizational 
process assets to find a seller?
A:When you’re conducting procurements, 
you need to actually find sellers to do the 
work. Many companies have a list of sellers 
who they consider qualified to work for them 
because of past project performance. You’ll 
usually find a list like this on file, and that’s 
what the qualified seller list is.

Kate is putting out an RFP to find a seller to provide technical 
support for her company. Can you figure out which Conduct 
Procurements tool she’s using?
1. Kate works with her company’s seller evaluation 
committee, which follows a documented, formal 
evaluation review process to determine which seller 
should be selected for the contract.
2. Kate contacts an IT trade journal and places a 
classified ad to try to find sellers.
3. The CEO’s brother-in-law runs a company that’s 
bidding on the contract. Kate needs to make sure he 
gets fair—not preferential—treatment. She doesn’t 
want to give him an unfair advantage, but she 
also doesn’t want to exclude him from the bidding 
process. So she gathers representatives from all 
sellers into a room where they can ask questions 
about the contract out in the open and hear the 
responses to each question.
4. Kate’s company takes part in an equal-opportunity 
program in which seller companies owned by 
minorities must be given notice of any RFPs. She 
uses a website approved by the program to find 
seller companies with performance data from similar 
projects.

Kate needs to use most of the tools and techniques in Conduct 
Procurements. Which technique is Kate using in each of these 
scenarios?
1. This is the first time that Kate’s company has contracted out technical support services, so she hires a 
consultant to help her and the legal team estimate a fair price for the contract.
2. Kate sets up criteria for each seller. Before sellers can submit a bid, they must show that they have handled 
technical support contracts before and have facilities that can handle over 150 simultaneous calls.
3. The CIO and the director of the IT department at Kate’s company spent a lot of time setting up the company’s 
existing technical support department, so Kate meets with them to get their technical opinions.
4. Kate sent a notification out to all potential sellers who responded to her RFP informing them that she was 
calling a meeting with all of them. She made sure that all prospective sellers had a clear understanding of the 
work that needed to be done, and she answered all questions from each seller out in the open.
5.  Kate reviews all of the sellers’ past performance on similar projects to determine whether or not there might 
be risks if she were to award the contract to any of them.
6. Kate and her company’s legal team sit down with the sellers and work out the terms of the contract. There’s a 
lot of back and forth, but they settle on an agreement that everyone is comfortable with.

638    Chapter 12

most important for the proposal.

Since a preset price will be paid, this is a 
fixed price (or lump sum) contract.
A lot of T&M contracts will have a “not to 
exceed” clause to limit risk for the buyer.
Notice how the incentive fee was tied to specific 
quality measurements. That’s a great way to 
motivate the seller to do a good job.
This is the same agreement from the fixed-price 
contract, but it’s got the incentive fee from the 
CPIF contract. So it’s fixed-price incentive fee.
The contract lays out the costs, and then adds a 
dollar amount fee on top of that. That’s a fixed 
fee, so it’s a CPFF contract.

It’s often hard to come up with a fair price yourself, because the 
skills you need to do that are usually the same skills that you need 
to do the job. Sometimes you don’t have those skills in your company, 
which could be why you looked for a seller in the first place.
When you screen out potential sellers, it makes the 
job of selecting a seller a lot easier.
You’ve seen a whole lot of other processes that have this 
same technique. Expert judgment always means getting an 
opinion from someone outside your project.
Project managers don’t usually do the negotiation themselves. 
They’ll get involved and provide expertise and knowledge, 
but usually rely on a lawyer or legal department to work 
out the actual terms of the contract.

something’s gone wrong
Two months later…
What could Kate have done to prevent this problem? Could she have detected it sooner? 
What should she do now?
Kate, the CEO called me at 3 
a.m. There’s a janitor’s strike 
at the seller’s technical support 
office, and that’s causing all sorts 
of havoc. Now our wait times are even 
longer than they were three months 
ago. What are you going to do about 
this?
Kate’s procurement project had been going 
really well…or so she thought. But it turns 
out there’s a problem.
Kate never even thought to 
ask about the janitors union 
when the legal team was 
negotiating the contract.
Keep an eye out for questions 
that ask about unions, even 
when they don’t have to do with 
contracts or Procurement 
Management.
When you work with a union, even if it’s through 
a seller, then the union contract (also called a 
collective bargaining agreement) can have an 
impact on your project. That means you need to 
consider the union itself a stakeholder, and when you 
do your planning you need to make sure any union 
rules and agreements are considered as constraints.

Keep an eye on the contract
You wouldn’t just start off a project and then assume everything would go perfectly, 
would you? Well, you can’t do that with a contract either. That’s why you use the 
Control Procurements process.
The idea behind the Control Procurements process is that staying on top of the work that 
the seller is doing is more difficult than working with your own project. That’s because 
when you hire a seller to take over part of your project, the team who’s doing the work 
doesn’t report to you. That’s why the first three inputs are especially important. 
The approved change requests are the way that you change the terms of the contract if 
something goes wrong, and the work performance data and work performance reports 
are how the seller tells you how the project is going.

manage your contract
Stay on top of the seller
The tools and techniques for Control Procurements are all there to help 
you work with the seller. Some of them help you look for any potential problems 
with the seller and make changes to correct them. Others help you with the day-to-
day administration work that you need to do in order to keep your project running.
Payment systems
Your partner won’t be very happy 
if you don’t pay. The payment 
system is how your company pays 
its sellers. It’s usually established 
by an Accounting or Accounts 
Receivable department.
Records management 
system
There are a lot of records 
produced by a typical contract: 
invoices, receipts, communications, 
memos, emails, instructions, 
clarifications, etc. You’ll need to 
put a system in place to manage 
them.
Claims administration
When there’s a dispute between a 
buyer and a seller, that’s called a 
claim. Most contracts have some 
language that explains exactly how 
claims should be resolved—and 
since it’s in the contract, it’s legally 
binding, and both the buyer and 
seller need to follow it.
Performance reporting
The easiest way for you to keep 
track of the contract work being 
done is to write up performance 
reports. These are exactly like the 
performance reports that you saw 
earlier in the book—you’ll use 
them to monitor the project work 
and report on the progress to your 
company’s management.
Procurement 
performance reviews
Most contracts lay out certain 
standards for how well the seller 
should do the job. Is the seller 
doing all the work that was agreed 
to? Is the work being done on 
time? The buyer has the right to 
make sure this is happening, and 
the way to do this is to go over the 
performance of the seller’s team.

Q:  Should I only care about unions 
when I’m working with contracts?
A: Unions come up in procurement and 
contracts whenever a seller has an existing 
contract with a union. That contract is called 
a collective bargaining agreement, and 
if that agreement impacts the work that the 
seller is going to do for you, then you need 
to make sure that your legal department 
considers it when they work out the terms of 
the contract.

But unions are also important when you’re 
doing Human Resource Management. If 
your company has a collective bargaining 
agreement with a union, then you need 
to consider the terms of that contract 
as external constraints to your project 
plan. Here’s an example: let’s say you’re 
managing a construction project, and your 
workers are all union members. Then you 
need to make sure that you consider any 
overtime rules and other restrictions on 
resource availability when you put together 
your team, your budget, and your plan.

Q: Once a contract is signed, does 
that mean it’s never allowed to change?
A: No. This confuses some people, 
because when you sign a contract, it’s 
legally binding—which means you must 
abide by the terms of the contract. But that 
doesn’t mean those terms can’t change. If 
both the buyer and the seller agree to make 
a change to the contract, then they have 
every right to do so. That’s why you have a 
contract change control system—so you can 
make sure these changes are made properly.

But you can’t always assume that you have 
the ability to change a contract that you’re 
not happy with. Once your company has 
agreed to a contract, then you’re absolutely 
required to meet its terms and complete your 
side of it. If you want to make a change to 
it, you need to negotiate that change, and 
it’s possible that the seller won’t agree to 
it—just like you have every right to refuse 
an unreasonable change that the seller 
requests.
Q: Does the type of contract make a 
difference in how changes are handled?
A: No, it doesn’t. While the type of 
contract definitely affects a lot of things, 
changes are always handled the same way. 
You always use the contract change control 
system to handle the changes.

That’s why the contract change control 
system is so important. It tells you the exact 
rules that you need to go through in order to 
make a change to a contract. No contract is 
perfect, and most of the time there are little 
tweaks that both the buyer and seller want 
to make. This gives them the tools they need 
to make only the changes that they need, 
without either team agreeing to a change 
that they don’t want included in the contract.
Q: I still don’t get the difference 
between a performance review and an 
audit.
A: The difference is that performance 
reviews are about the work, while 
inspections and audits are about the 
deliverables and products.

You’ll use a performance review when you 
want to make sure that the team at the seller 
is doing every activity that they should. For 
example, if you have a contract that requires 
the seller to perform certain quality control 
or project management tasks, you might 
conduct a performance review where you 
observe the team and verify that they do 
those tasks. On the other hand, if you want 
to make sure that the products that the 
team is producing meet your requirements 
and standards, you’ll send out an auditor to 
inspect the products that the seller is making 
to verify that they meet the requirements.
Q: So do project managers usually get 
involved in contract negotiations?
A: Project managers don’t usually do the 
negotiating themselves, but they do often get 
involved in contract negotiations. Remember, 
nobody knows more about the project than 
the project manager—you know what work 
needs to be done, what requirements the 
product must meet, and what kind of budget 
you need to stay within. So even though a 
lawyer or legal department will do the actual 
negotiation, they won’t know if the seller is 
capable of doing the job without the project 
manager’s help.
Whenever you 
see “inspection” or 
“audit,” it means that 
you’re looking at the 
products that the 
seller delivered to 
see if they meet your 
standards.

Procurement audits
Once you’ve closed out the contract, you go over 
everything that happened on the project to figure 
out the lessons learned and look for anything that 
went right or wrong.
Records management system
When you were working with the legal team 
to put the contract together, you looked at 
information about past contracts. So where 
did it come from? Past project managers 
stored their contracts and other documents 
in the records management system.
When the seller’s work is done, it’s time to close 
the contract, and that’s when you use the Close 
Procurements process. Even if your contract 
ends disastrously (or in court), you still need to close 
out the contract so that you can make sure all of 
your company’s responsibilities are taken care of—
and that you learn from the experience.
Any lessons you learned from 
the procurement audits should 
be added here, along with any 
documentation and a copy of 
the formal acceptance that 
you gave to the seller.
The way you close out a contract is 
by giving notice—a formal written 
one—that the contract is complete… 
and instructions for doing that 
should be part of the contract 
terms.
The Close

process is one of

Procurement negotiations
You need to make sure that all of the 
terms of the contract have been met and 
there are no outstanding claims on it. If 
the buyer or the seller have outstanding 
claims from the relationship, they need 
to get resolved, sometimes through legal 
arbitration or, in the worst-case scenario, 
in court.

1. If they handle the extra work within the company instead of finding a seller, it will cost an extra $35,000 in 
overtime and $11,000 in training costs in total, on top of the $4,400 per person per month for the five-person team 
needed to do the extra support work. What’s the total cost of keeping the work within the company?
2. Kate and Ben talked to a few companies and estimate that it will cost $20,000 per month to hire another company 
to do the work, but they’ll also need to spend $44,000 in setup costs. What will contracting the work cost?
3. So does it make more sense to make or buy? Why?
Kate is putting out an RFP to find a seller to provide technical 
support for her company. Can you figure out which Conduct 
Procurements tool she’s using?
exercise solutions
The total cost for keeping the work is the monthly cost ($4,400 per person x 5 people x 18 months 
= $396,000) plus the extra costs ($35,000 overtime and $11,000 training costs). $396,000 + 
$35,000 + $11,000 = $442,000 total costs for keeping the work inside the company (“making”).
The cost for hiring another company to do the work is $20,000 per month x 18 months plus the 
$44,000 in setup costs. ($20,000 x 18) + $44,000 = $404,000 total costs for contracting 
out the work (“buying”).
In this case, it makes more sense to buy because the costs of making ($442,000) are greater than 
the costs of buying ($404,000).
1. Kate checks works with her company’s seller 
evaluation committee, which follows a documented, 
formal evaluation review process to determine which 
seller should be selected for the contract.
2. Kate contacts an IT trade journal and places a 
classified ad to try to find sellers.
3. The CEO’s brother-in-law runs a company that’s 
bidding on the contract. Kate needs to make sure he 
gets fair—not preferential—treatment. She doesn’t 
want to give him an unfair advantage, but she 
also doesn’t want to exclude him from the bidding 
process. So she gathers representatives from all 
sellers into a room where they can ask questions 
about the contract out in the open and hear the 
responses to each question.
4. Kate’s company takes part in an equal-opportunity 
program in which seller companies owned by 
minorities must be given notice of any RFPs. She 
uses a website approved by the program to find 
seller companies with performance data from similar 
projects.

1. Answer: D
This contract is a time and materials contract. It’s charging a rate for labor and overhead for materials. 
2. Answer: A
One of the most important things about a bidder conference is that no one seller is given better access to 
the buyer. They should all have the same opportunity to gather information, so that no single seller is given 
preferential treatment.
3. Answer: C
A fixed-price contract is the riskiest sort of contract for the seller. That’s because there’s one price for the whole 
contract, no matter what happens. So if it turns out that there’s a lot more work than expected, or the price of 
parts or materials goes up, then the seller has to eat the costs.
4. Answer: C
This is just the definition of the point of total assumption.
5. Answer: C
This is a simple make-or-buy decision, 
so you can work out the math. The 
contractor’s quote of $19,000 per week 
for a 16-week job means that buying will 
cost you $19,000 x 16 = $304,000. On 
the other hand, if you decide to keep the 
work in-house, then it will cost you $35,000 
for the engineer, plus $15,000 per week 
for 16 weeks: $35,000 + (16 x $15,000)  = 
$275,000. It will be cheaper to make it 
rather than buy it!

6. Answer: A
This question describes make-or-buy analysis, which is part of the Plan Procurement Management process.
7. Answer: C
One of the most important things that you do when you’re finding sellers during the Conduct Procurements process 
is to select the sellers that will do the work. And the qualified seller list is an input that you use for that.
8. Answer: B
One of the most important parts of Procurement Management is that both the buyer and the seller want to feel like 
they’re getting a good deal. Every procurement should be a win-win situation for both parties!
9. Answer: D
This may look like a tough problem, but it’s actually pretty easy. Just figure out how much the rental would cost you 
for each of the answers:
Now look at what the excavator would cost for 25 months. It would cost $105,000 plus $20,000 for the 
maintenance costs, for a total of $125,000. So at 25 months, the excavator is worth buying—but before that, it 
makes more sense to rent.
10. Answer: D
The time and materials (T&M) contract is the riskiest one for the buyer, because if the project costs are much 
higher than the original estimates, the buyer has to swallow them, while the seller keeps getting paid for the time 
worked.
That makes sense. You can’t start contracting 
until you figure out whether or not you should.
If this seems a little out of place, remember that 
renting equipment is a kind of contract, and the 
same kind of make-or-buy decision is necessary.
8 months x $5,000 per month + $2,000 service charge = $42,000
16 months x $5,000 per month + $2,000 service charge = $82,000
A.	  8 months
B.	  16 months
C.	  21 months
D.	  25 months
21 months x $5,000 per month + $2,000 service charge = $107,000
25 months x $5,000 per month + $2,000 service charge = $127,000
Your company should already have 
a qualified seller list on file.

658    Chapter 12
Exam Questions
Answers
11. Answer: D
Both cost-plus and fixed-price contracts are based on the idea that you know how long the contract is going 
to last. A seller would only agree to a fixed-price contract if there’s a good idea of how much it’s going to 
cost. And a cost-plus contract will hurt the buyer if it goes over. Only the time and materials contract will 
give both the buyer and seller a fair deal if neither has a good idea of how long the work will take.
12. Answer: A
Contracting is a pretty linear process—first you plan the contract, then you put together a package of 
procurement documents to send to potential sellers, and then you select a seller and start the work. So you 
send out a request for proposals after you’ve put together the procurement document package so that you 
can select a seller for the job.
13. Answer: D
You put together the source selection criteria as part of the Plan Procurement Management process. That 
way, you can use the criteria when you’re looking at the responses you get from sellers.
14. Answer: C
You can always change a contract, as long as both the buyer and the seller agree to it. When you do that, 
you need to use the contract change control system—just like with any other change.
15. Answer: C
It’s easy to get mixed up with all of these audits, but if you think about how they’re used, it gets less 
confusing. When you’re performing Control Procurements, the most important part of your job is to figure 
out if the products that the seller is producing meet your requirements. By the time closure happens, the 
products have all been completed—if there was a problem, you should have caught it during Control 
Procurements. All you can do now is come up with any lessons learned so that you can avoid mistakes in 
the future.
That’s the only time you really should 
use a T&M contract.

Keeping everyone engaged
Project management is about knowing your 
audience.  If you don’t get a handle on the people who are 
affected by your project, you might discover that they have needs 
you aren’t meeting. If your project is going to be successful, you’ve 
got to satisfy your stakeholders. Luckily, there’s the Stakeholder 
Management knowledge area, which you can use to understand 
your stakeholders and figure out what they need. Once you really 
understand how important those needs are to your project, it’s a lot 
easier to keep everyone satisfied.

Stakeholder Management 
makes sure you know who 
you need to engage to keep 
your project on track. 
Understanding your stakeholders
When you think about it, there are a lot of people who have an interest in your 
project.  That obviously includes the sponsor who’s paying for it, the team who’s 
making it, and the people who will support it. But there are people who aren’t so 
obvious who have a stake in your project as well.  If you don’t pay attention to 
all of your stakeholders, you could find that you don’t meet their needs, and that 
can cause your project to run off the rails. The Stakeholder Management 
processes are here to help you figure out who your stakeholders are, plan how 
you’ll keep them engaged, and manage your project to keep them satisfied.

hint: it’s not a vampire slayer
Find out who your stakeholders are
One of the first things you need to do when you start a project is to figure out 
who your stakeholders are and what you need to do to keep them all in the loop. 
The Identify Stakeholders process is all about writing down your stakeholders’ 
names along with their goals, expectations, and concerns in a document called 
the stakeholder register. Most projects succeed or fail based on how well the 
project manager knows and manages stakeholder expectations.  Writing them 
down up front will help you to come up with a strategy to identify the people who 
could impact your project, but still need to be convinced of its value. 
Stakeholder analysis is a critical 
tool in this process. You need to interview 
all of the stakeholders you can find for your 
project, and find out the value the project 
has for them.  As you sit with stakeholders, 
you’ll identify more people to interview.  
During stakeholder analysis, you can divide 
your stakeholders into groups based on 
their level of involvement and need for 
communication.  When you understand 
what motivates all of your stakeholders, you 
can come up with a strategy to make sure 
that they’re told about the things that they 
find important, and that they’re not bored 
with extraneous details. 
Expert judgment  in this process 
means talking to all of the experts on 
your project to identify more stakeholders, 
and learn more about the ones you’ve 
identified.

The register should tell you what individual

**Flip the page to learn more about the stakeholder register. 
The PMBOK Guide defines a stakeholder 
a little more specifically than its everyday 
term: “Individals, groups, or organizations 
who may affect, be affected by, or perceive 
themselves to be affected by a decision, 
activity, or outcome of a project.” [PMBOK 
Guide, 5th edition, page 394]
The classification 
tells you whether 
the stakeholder 
is internal or 
external, but also 
whether he’s a 
supporter, resistor, 
or neutral 
participant in the 
project.
What effect would a resistant stakeholder have 
on your project? What about a neutral one?

666    Chapter 13
who’s got the power; who’s got the interest
When you get started on your project, the first thing you should do is examine the 
charter and any contract information you have to figure out who will be impacted by 
it.  Once you have a preliminary list of stakeholders, you should sit down with each one 
of them and figure out their responsiblities, goals, expectations, and concerns.  These 
interviews will be the basis for the stakeholder profiles in your stakeholder register.  As 
you interview people, you’ll likely find more stakeholders to include in the list.

Stakeholder analysis up close
It’s useful to group 
stakeholders together, 
because stakeholders in 
a particular group tend 
to have similar needs 
and project interests.
At first, it may sound 
like “requirements” and 
“expectations” are the same 
thing, but it’s useful to make 
a distinction. Requirements 
are what someone needs to 
get out of your project, 
while expectations are what 
they think will actually 
happen.
It’s easy to imagine a 
stakeholder with high hopes 
but little actual expectation 
of seeing them realized.
Once you’ve got a handle 
on your stakeholders’ 
concerns, you can start 
making headway addressing 
them. That’s how you turn a 
negative stakeholder into an 
advocate!

you are here 4    667
stakeholder management
One way to get a handle on how to communicate with your stakeholders is to create a power/interest grid. When 
you plot your stakeholders on a power/interest grid, you can determine who has high or low power to affect your 
project, and who has high or low interest. People with high power need to be kept satisfied, while people with high 
interest need to be kept informed. When a stakeholder has both, make sure you manage her expectations very closely!
The people who are high 
power and high interest 
are the decision makers 
who have the biggest 
impact on project success, 
so closely manage their 
expectations.
Folks with high interest 
and low power should 
be kept in the loop as 
the project progresses. If 
they’re kept informed, 
your project will get good 
buzz.
You shouldn’t have 
to worry too much 
about the people with 
low interest and low 
power; they require 
the least amount of 
attention here.

You need these people 
to be kept satisfied with

This is the Plan Stakeholder Management process. You’ve seen a lot of planning processes now. Can
you fill in the inputs and outputs for this one?
This one is your company’s 
culture and policies toward 
project communication.
You need to know 
who you’re going to 
communicate with. 
Here’s where your company 
keeps all of its templates 
and lessons learned. 
Here’s where you use all of 
the planning you’ve done for 
all of the knowledge areas in 
your project so far.
Inputs
the plan stakeholder management process
Analytical techniques means figuring out how 
engaged your stakeholders are today, and how engaged 
you want them to be as your project gets under way.  
The levels of engagement are:
Unaware: The stakeholder doesn’t know that the 
project is happening.
Resistant: The stakeholder doesn’t want the project 
or decision you’re making to happen.
Neutral: The stakeholder is fine with the project or 
decision no matter how it turns out.
Supportive: The stakeholder wants your project or 
decision to succeed.
Leading: The stakeholder is actively helping the 
project to succeed.
When you’re mapping out your Stakeholder 
Management plan, it helps to determine where all of 
your stakeholders are in relation to these classifications, 
and where you ultimately want them to be.

It’s not enough to know who your stakeholders are—you need to understand 
what motivates them, and what it will take to make the project a success for each 
of them.  That’s where the Stakeholder Engagement Assessment matrix 
comes in.  Jeff and Charles sat down and worked to come up with one for their 
upcoming party. Here’s what it looked like:

Turning around a negative 
stakeholder can take a lot of effort.  You 
might need to pay special attention to the 
things that affect his opinion to do it.  But 
usually your project will be better off for it, 
especially if that negative stakeholder has 
a lot of influence.

Answers on page 676.
Think about a major project you’ve worked on where there were a large number of 
stakeholders. Where was their engagement level at the beginning of the project? Where did it 
end up? 

674    Chapter 13
Q:  How do I figure out who all of my stakeholders are?
A:   The short answer is: look around. You probably can 
name the majority of the stakeholders on your project right off 
the top of your head. You’ll surely know who the sponsor is; 
you can point to her name right on the charter. Then there’s the 
team that’s doing the work; you’ll know who they are because 
you work with them every day. From there, it gets a little 
harder. Any business partners (like trainers or support people 
for software packages) that your company has contracted to 
help out with the project are also stakeholders. Consultants 
or other vendors you might’ve contracted to help you deliver 
your product will also be stakeholders. Then you’ll have to 
think about how the product of your project will affect the rest 
of your company. Will it change the way people work when it’s 
complete? How will those people who need to change their 
work feel about the project if you asked them today? They’re 
stakeholders, too. If you’re thorough, the list might get pretty 
long, but it’s much better to think about your stakeholders up 
front than it is to ignore them. A stakeholder you don’t plan for 
today could cause a lot of turbulence in your project later. 
Q: Explain the point of that power/interest grid again.
A: Different people have different perspectives on your 
project. Some of them will put a lot of time and effort into 
making your project succeed, while others will not have the 
spare cycles to give. And some people might even actively 
work against your project if they don’t understand it. The power/
interest grid is there to help you understand how you should 
approach the stakeholders for your project. If someone without 
a lot of power to influence your project doesn’t have the time or 
the will to help you with it, that’s less of a problem than when 
someone with a lot of power to affect your project is resistant 
to it. It’s a tool to help you figure out the best approach to 
managing all of the stakeholders on your project. It will help you 
choose the right way to influence the people who can help you 
succeed. 
Q: How do I turn around resistant stakeholders?
A: Many times they’re resistant for a good reason. The best 
approach is really to try to understand why they’re resistant 
and help them to see the benefits of your project. Many 
times, stakeholders who are resistant to change have good 
suggestions that can make the project better in the long run. 
Q: What does it mean to have a stakeholder in a leading 
role?
A: When a stakeholder takes on a leading role, he is actively 
involved in making sure your project is a success. He may go to 
meetings and convince others to support the project, and help 
you to clear any obstacles that might jeopardize your project’s 
goals. When a stakeholder has a leading role in the project, he 
has a stake in seeing it succeed. Leading stakeholders are 
willing to put time and energy into making sure that others 
support the project. 
There are five 
engagement levels for 
stakeholders; unaware, 
resistant, neutral, 
supportive, and 
leading.   
rules of engagement

stakeholder management
Managing stakeholder engagement means 
clearing up misunderstandings
As your project progresses, you’ll need to check in with your stakeholders 
regularly so that misunderstandings don’t develop. Your job is to help 
them to take part in the decisions the team is making, so that they can 
be supportive. When a stakeholder is resistant to change, you’ll need to 
negotiate with her and understand her resistance so that you can take her 
perspective into account. 
Sometimes a stakeholder you don’t always talk to might have a good 
suggestion for improvement that can help the whole team. It’s also 
possible that there are some facts about the project that the stakeholder 
hasn’t considered, and you can help him to be better informed. The key 
to success in Stakeholder Management is being inclusive, and sharing 
information with everyone who’s impacted by the project’s outcome. 
What’s up with the 
Sound engineers? 
Are we going to 
be able to get 
them to come out 
on the night of the 
party?
Last I heard, 
they were charging 
a big fee. Did they 
ever confirm?
Jeff and Charles didn’t realize that they scheduled their party on the same 
day as another music event that was happening in the city.  The sound 
engineers needed to bring in extra help to handle both events, and that’s why 
they were charging a bigger fee.  Once you found out what the issue was and 
communicated it back to the Head First Lounge team, they understood the 
cost and approved it.

Control your stakeholders’ engagement
Now that you’ve got a great framework set up for managing 
the way your stakeholders interact with your project, you need 
to monitor those interactions to make sure that everybody 
stays in the loop. When you run into a problem or find a 
place where you might be able to bring the project closer to 
meeting a stakeholder’s goal, you can make course corrections 
and changes to keep as many of your stakeholders satisfied 
as possible—and that’s what the Control Stakeholder 
Engagement process is all about.   
Once you know 
what your 
stakeholders’ 
requirements are, 
you can monitor 
how close or 
far away your 
project is from 
meeting them. 
This is the first place to 
look for information on 
your project.
This is all of the data 
about how your project is 
progressing. You can use it to 
make forecasts and tell how 
close you are to meeting your 
stakeholders’ goals.
You’ll need to stay on top of 
all of the current issues for 
your project if you want keep

Now you can tell when you need to change the 
way you deal with stakeholders
Now that you’ve taken a look at all of the data coming from your project, 
you’re in a better position to tell if you need to make changes to the way you’re 
managing stakeholder engagement. The outputs from Control Stakeholder 
Engagement are all about making changes to the documents you’ve been using to 
keep them engaged all along. 
Project Management Plan updates might 
be needed as you work with your stakeholders to 
ensure successful delivery. Your stakeholders might 
request changes to your overall strategy for any of 
the knowledge areas you’ve planned as part of your 
Project Management plan. You’ll need to go back 
and make updates to those plans if you want to keep 
everyone in the loop about the change in approach.
Work performance information is the 
analyzed work performance data, changed from 
raw data into reports that are understood in context 
and can be used to make project decisions. Where 
work performance data was the raw outputs of the 
various controlling processes, the work performance 
information is consolidated. Think of work 
performance data as your raw budget performance 
data (this month, we’re over budget by $1,000) and 
work performance information as that data in context 
(the project budget forecast is currently $10,000 
under budget, even though we’re over by $1,000 this 
month). 
Change requests happen as part of controlling 
stakeholder engagement. What do you do if you find 
out that one of your stakeholders’ requirements has 
been missed? You put the change request in as 
soon as possible.
Outputs
Project documents updates happen as 
you work with your stakeholders to monitor and 
control their engagement. You might find new 
stakeholders along the way who make you update 
your stakeholder register. You could also run into 
issues that need to be added to the issue log.
Organizational process asset updates 
need to be added—especially your lessons learned. 
There are always a lot of lessons to be learned when 
you’re working with stakeholders to ensure project 
success.

Work performance data is an input of some Stakeholder Management processes, but not an input to Plan 
Stakeholder Management.  
3. Answer: A
The stakeholder register is the first thing you need to 
create here.  It looks like some of the upper managers 
who might be thinking of cancelling the project need 
to have their ideas taken into account.  Once you’ve 
identified them as stakeholders, you can work to bring 
their perspective into account on your project and 
include them in project management decisions.  
4. Answer: A
It sounds like this stakeholder is completely unaware of her responsibilities on the project.  The 
next step here is to spend some time bringing her up to speed on what’s expected. 
5. Answer: C
When you look at work performance data and discover a new stakeholder requirement, you’re 
doing the Control Stakeholder Engagement process.  Some of the outputs of that process are 
change requests, project document updates, and Project Management plan updates. 
6. Answer: B
Stakeholders in the low power/high interest quadrant of the power/interest grid need to be kept informed of all project 
decisions.

Exam Questions
Answers
7. Answer: B
Identify Stakeholders is the only process in Stakeholder Management that is part of the Initiating process 
group.
8. Answer: B
Stakeholders in the high power/high interest quadrant of the power/interest grid need to have their 
expectations and requirements closely managed by the project manager.
9. Answer: D
The Project Management plan is not an input to the Identify Stakeholders process.  Since the Identify 
Stakeholders process is part of the Initiating process group, the stakeholders are identified as an input to 
the Planning processes that create the Project Management plan.  
10. Answer: A
This is a stakeholder expectation.  The stakeholder expects that the team will do as requested.   
11. Answer: D
Not all stakeholders have deliverables on a project. Some are sponsors, vendors, or others who might be 
involved in the project but not actually producing deliverables. When a stakeholder does have deliverables 
that she’s accountable for, she’ll be documented in the Scope Management plan.
12. Answer: D
Control Stakeholder Engagement is the only Monitoring and Controlling process in Stakeholder 
Management.
Flip back to chapter 4 for a quick refresher 
on the Initiating process group, now that 
you’ve studied Stakeholder Management. It’s 
a good way to review.
It can get confusing because Identify Stakeholders 
is discussed at the end of the PMBOK Guide, 
but it’s part of the Initiating processes and done 
before you get to the Planning processes.

Making good choices
It’s not enough to just know your stuff. You need to make good 
choices to be good at your job.  Everyone who has the PMP credential 
agrees to follow the Project Management Institute Code of Ethics and Professional 
Conduct, too. The Code helps you with ethical decisions that aren’t really covered in the 
body of knowledge—and it’s a big part of the PMP exam. Most of what you need to know 
is really straightforward, and with a little review, you’ll do well.
0h, really? 
Well, does it say 
anything about taking 
the garbage out?
Knowing the 
PMI Code of Ethics 
and Professional 
Conduct has made me a 
better project manager 
AND a better 
husband. 

694    Chapter 14
meet the code of ethics and professional conduct
Doing the right thing
You’ll get some questions on the exam that give you situations that 
you might run into while managing your projects and then ask 
you what to do. Usually, there’s a clear answer to these questions: 
it’s the one where you stick to your principles. Questions 
will make the decisions tougher by offering rewards for doing the 
wrong thing (like money for taking a project shortcut), or they 
will make the infraction seem really small (like photocopying 
a copyrighted article out of a magazine). If you stick to the 
principles in the PMP Code of Professional Conduct regardless 
of the consequences, you’ll always get the answers right. 
The PMP exam categorizes ethics and professional 
conduct as part of a project manager’s cross-
cutting knowledge and skills. This means 
that there will be questions about ethics and 
professional conduct scattered throughout the 
exam alongside questions about each of the 
process groups. You should expect to see questions 
about specific ethical situations around each of the 
process groups. When you come across a question 
about ethics and professional conduct, you’re 
likely to see it in the context of initiating, planning, 
executing, or monitoring and controlling a project.
So if you find out that someone has stolen questions 
from the PMP exam, cheated on the PMP exam, 
falsely claimed to have a PMP certification, or lied 
about anything related to the PMP certification 
process, then you MUST report that to PMI.
The main ideas
In general, there are a few kinds of problems that the 
code of ethics prepares you to deal with. 
1.	 Follow all laws and company policies.
2.	 Treat everybody fairly and respectfully.
3.	 Have respect for the environment and the community 
you’re working in.
4.	 Give back to the project management community by 
writing, speaking, and sharing your experience with 
other project managers.
5.	 Keep learning and getting better and better at your job. 
6.	 Respect other people’s cultures.
7.	 Respect copyright laws.
8.	 Always be honest with everyone on the project.
9.	 If you find that another person has done something 
to damage the PMP credential in any way, you must 
report it to PMI.
Ethics and 
professional 
responsibility 
questions make 
up 10% of the 
exam. That’s 
good news because 
these questions are 
really easy if you 
understand the ideas 
behind the PMP 
Code of Professional 
Conduct. 

you are here 4    695
professional responsibility
Being a PMP-certified project manager means 
that you know how to do your job and that you will 
do it with integrity.
It might seem like it doesn’t really matter how you will handle 
these situations, but think about it from an employer’s perspective 
for a minute. Because of the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional 
Conduct, employers know that when they hire a PMP-certified 
project manager, they are hiring someone who will follow company 
policies and do everything aboveboard and by the book. That means 
that you’ll help to protect their company from litigation and deliver 
on what you promise, which is actually pretty important. 
So you should definitely expect to see questions about ethics and 
professional responsibility on the exam. Not only that, but you won’t 
necessarily see them as straightforward, black-and-white questions, 
either. Since the questions on this topic are combined into the other 
questions for the process groups, you’re likely to get questions about 
situations that might occur on real projects. A question about ethics 
or professional responsibility might look at first like a question about, 
say, a particular tool or technique in planning. Keep your eye out for 
“red herring” questions that turn out to be about ethics and social 
responsibility. They’ll lay out a situation that sounds like a normal 
project management problem, but requires you to use one of the 
principles in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
Can you think of some situations where you might need to 
make decisions using these principles in your own projects?
Come on. Is this really on 
the test? I know how to do my 
job. Do I really need a morality 
lesson?

696    Chapter 14
never take bribes
Keep the cash?
A lot of ethics questions on the PMP exam 
concern bribery. It is never, under any 
circumstances, OK to accept a bribe—even 
if your company and customer might benefit 
from it somehow. And bribes aren’t always 
cash. They can be anything from free trips to 
tickets to a ball game. Any time you’re offered 
anything to change your opinion or the way 
you work, you must decline the offer and 
disclose it to your company.
Kate, you were so great to 
work with. We’d like to send 
you $1,000 as a token of our 
appreciation.
Awesome. I’ve 
been wanting to go 
shopping for a while. 
And what about that 
vacation? Acapulco, 
here we come!
I would never 
accept a gift like 
that. Doing a good 
job is its own 
reward!
I’m sorry, I can’t 
accept the gift. I 
really appreciate the 
gesture, though. 
In some countries, even though 
you may be “expected” to pay 
a bribe, it’s not okay to do 
it—even if it’s customary or 
culturally acceptable.

Fly business class?
Any time there’s a policy in your company, you 
need to follow it. Even if it seems like no harm will 
be done if you don’t follow the policy, and even 
if you will be able to get away with it, you should 
not do it. And that goes double for laws—under no 
circumstances are you ever allowed to break a law, no 
matter how much good it “seems” to do you or 
your project.
Did you know 
that those chairs 
go into totally flat 
beds? This is so cool. 
i’ve worked so hard, i’ve 
totally earned it!
There’s 
no excuse for 
not following 
the rules. The

We’ve got some

budget and you’re really 
doing a great job. I know the 
travel policy says we always 
fly coach. But we can afford to 
splurge a bit. Why don’t you buy a 
business ticket this time?
Wow, Ben. That’s 
really nice of you. 
But the economy fare 
will be fine. 
And if you ever see someone in your 
company breaking the law, you need 
to report it to the authorities.

New software
When it comes to copyright, it’s never OK to use 
anything without permission. Books, articles, music, 
software…you always need to ask before using it. For 
example, if you want to use some copyrighted music 
in a company presentation, you should write to the 
copyright owner and ask for permission.
Absolutely! 
This will totally

Shortcuts
You might see a question or two that asks if you 
really need to follow all of the processes. Or you 
might be asked by your boss to keep certain facts 
about your project hidden from stakeholders 
or sponsors. You have a responsibility to make 
sure your projects are run properly, and to never 
withhold information from people who need it.

respect our environment
A good price or a clean river?
Being responsible to the community is 
even more important than running a 
successful project. But it’s more than 
being environmentally aware—you 
should also respect the cultures of 
everyone else in your community, and 
the community where your project 
work will be done.
We just found out 
that one of our suppliers 
dumps harmful chemicals in 
the river. They’ve always given 
us great rates, and our budget 
will go through the roof if we 
switch suppliers now. The whole 
thing gives me a headache. What 
should we do?
We can’t let the project 
fail for a bunch of stupid 
fish. 
The earth is 
our home and is 
so much more 
important than this 
project. We have to 
do what’s right…
Ben, I know it could 
cause us problems, but 
we’re gonna have to find 
another supplier. 
That means even though languages, customs,

We’re not all angels
We know that the choices you make on your project are not always black and 
white. Remember that the questions on the exam are designed to test your 
knowledge of the PMP Code of Professional Conduct and how to apply it. A lot 
of situations you will run into in real life have a hundred circumstances around 
them that make these decisions a little tougher to make than the ones you see here. 
But if you know what the code would have you do, you’re in a good position to 
evaluate those scenarios as well. 
Now, go read the PMP Code of Professional Conduct 
before you take these exam questions. Go to this

You should never copy anything that’s copyrighted. Make sure you always respect other people’s 
intellectual property!
2. Answer: B
It’s never OK to discriminate against women, minorities, or others. You should avoid doing 
business with anyone who does.
3. Answer: A
This is a difficult situation for any project manager. But you can’t cut corners on the project 
management processes, and you certainly can’t tell the client that you’re refusing their business. 
The best thing you can do is meet with the CEO to explain why you need to follow the rules.
4. Answer: B
The client is demanding a bribe, and paying bribes is unethical. You should not do it. If your 
project requires you to bribe someone, then you shouldn’t do business with that person.
5. Answer: A
You should always try to help other people learn about managing projects.

time to make it stick
A long-term relationship for your brain
Take a minute and think back over everything you’ve just learned. Does 
it seem a little…well, overwhelming? Don’t worry, that’s absolutely 
normal. You’ve got all of this information that’s floating around in your 
brain, and your brain is still trying to organize it.
Your brain is an amazing machine, and it’s really good at organizing 
information. Luckily, when you feed it so much new data, there are ways 
that you can help make it “stick.” That’s what you’ve been doing in this 
chapter. Your brain wants its new information to be categorized. That’s 
why it helps to first review how the processes are organized, and then 
review what the processes do.
I get it! That’s 
why I did the process 
magnets first, then the 
process crossword, then 
the calculation questions. 
Working through these 
things separately can help 
me get them into my 
brain.
Yes! Cognitive psychologists call it chunking, and it’s a really 
effective way of getting information into your long-term 
memory. When you have a collection of things that are 
strongly associated with one another, it gives your brain a sort 
of “guideline” for storing it. And the weaker associations with 
the other “chunks” give it a bigger framework for managing 
this large amount of information, so that it’s all mutually 
reinforcing.

Here’s how to do this next section
This next section consists of a series of questions grouped together by knowledge area. To make this 
as effective as possible:
* Make this the only PMP study activity you do today.
* Give yourself plenty of time to do it.
* Make sure you drink lots of water while you’re answering the questions.
* As you’re answering the questions, think about each answer and only 
mark down one response, even if you’re not 100% sure.
* After you do each section, read through each question again.
* Don’t look at the answers until you’ve gone through all of the knowledge 
areas.
* Make sure you get plenty of sleep the night after you do these questions.
Cognitive 
psychologists 
recognize that sleep plays 
a really important role in 
helping your brain organize and 
consolidate information into 
your long-term memory.

how sharp’s your pencil?
You’ll definitely get a bunch of calculation questions on the exam. 
Luckily, you’ve got a handle on them! Here’s your chance to get a 
little more practice.
1. How many lines of communication are there on a project with nine people (including the project manager)?

2. Your project has a budget at completion of $250,000. You’ve completed half of the work, but your schedule 
says you should have completed 60% of the work. Calculate PV and EV.

3. Your project has a BAC of $7,500. Your scheduled % complete is 35%, but your actual % complete is 30%. 
Calculate the SPI. What does that SPI tell you about your project?

4. You’re managing a project with a team of eight people, plus you (as the project manager), when you added 
four team members. How many lines of communication were added?

5. You’ve got a project with a budget of $500,000. Your project is 75% complete, and you have spent $400,000 
so far. Calculate the EAC and ETC. What does that tell you about the project?

6. You’ve identified two risks and an opportunity for your project. Risk A has a probability of 35% and a cost of 
$500. Risk B has a probability of 60% and a cost of $750. Opportunity C has a probability of 10% and a value 
of $1,000. What’s the total EMV of Risk A, Risk B, and Opportunity C?
7. Your project has a CPI of 1.2 and an EV of $150,000. Calculate the actual cost of the project so far.
The formula for # lines of communication is:    # lines =  n x (n - 1) ÷ 2
So # lines = 9 x (9 - 1) ÷ 2 = 9 x 8 ÷ 2 = 36 lines of communication
The formulas are:    PV = BAC x scheduled % complete       EV = BAC x actual % complete
So the answers are:    PV = $250,000 x 60% = $150,000      EV = $250,000 x 50% = $125,000
The formula is: SPI = EV ÷ PV.     So first calculate EV and PV:    EV = $7,500 x 30% = $2,250
	
        PV = $7,500 x 35% = $2,625
Now calculate SPI: SPI = $2,250 ÷ $2,625 = .86     Since SPI is lower than 1, your project is behind schedule.
We already figured out the team of 9 people in question 1—you have 36 lines of communication. The new team 
has four more team members, or a total of 13, so # lines = 13 x (13 - 1) ÷ 2 = 13 x 12 ÷ 2 = 78 lines
So the number of lines added is 78 lines - 36 lines = 42 lines of communication
The formulas are: EV = BAC x % complete    CPI = EV ÷ AC    EAC = BAC ÷ CPI  and  ETC = EAC - AC
First calculate EV = $500,000 x 75% = $375,000, and then calculate CPI = $375,000 ÷ $400,000 = .94
Now you can calculate EAC = $500,000 ÷ .94 = $531,915 and ETC = $531,915 - $400,000 = $131,915
This means that you should expect to spend about $131,915 before the project ends.
To calculate EMV, add up the individual probabilities multiplied by costs (negative) or values (positive).
EMV = (.35 x -$500) + (.60 x -$750) + (.10 x $1,000) = -$525
The formula is:    CPI = EV ÷ AC.    First fill in what we know:   1.2 = $150,000 ÷ AC
Now flip it around: AC = $150,000 ÷ 1.2 = $125,000

1. B. 
Since this question is asking about the company’s operating environment, it’s really asking you to figure out which of the 
answers is not an enterprise environmental factor. Marketplace conditions, government standards, and political climate 
are enterprise environmental factors, but forecasts aren’t—that’s a Cost Management output.
2. D. 
Whenever your project’s scope changes, that means you need to put your project through change control. That doesn’t 
necessarily mean that you need to have your team change the way they’ll work, or reject the change outright. The first 
step in evaluating any change is understanding the impact that it will have on the project.
3. B. 
The main role of the sponsor is to provide funding for the project. That’s why the sponsor is an important stakeholder. 
However, the sponsor does not necessarily have a specific role on the project beyond paying for it. 
4. C. 
When you put together your Project Management plan, one of the first things that you do is select a project methodology 
(or lifecycle), and determine exactly how each of the processes will be implemented. Your Communications Management 
plan will definitely have specifics about how you communicate with your stakeholders, because that’s a really important 
part of managing a project. But your Project Management plan doesn’t typically include your company’s policies. For 
example, guidelines about how your company hires and retains staff are usually set by an HR department, and they 
generally don’t vary from project to project.
Integration Questions
Answers
That doesn’t mean that the sponsor can’t also 
be involved in those other things. A sponsor 
who’s paying for a project also wants it to 
succeed, and will often fill other roles on the 
project as well.
Staffing and retention guidelines are an 
example of one of your company’s policies, and 
policies are enterprise environmental factors.

Scope Questions
5. A. 
This stakeholder wants to exclude something from the scope, and project exclusions—which identify what is out of 
scope for the project—should always be documented in the project scope statement. (You might also consider it a 
constraint—technically, it’s both—but constraints are also documented in the project scope statement.)
6. B. 
When you’re talking to project stakeholders and documenting their needs, you’re collecting requirements. “Observations” 
is a technique used in the Collect Requirements process. And that makes sense—you often need to observe people 
doing their jobs in order to figure out how they’ll use your project’s deliverables.
7. D. 
When a project manager analyzes deliverables and subdivides them into smaller components, he is using 
decomposition, which is the only tool or technique in the Create WBS process.
8. D. 
When a project team lead—who, in this case, is acting as the project manager—is gathering formal acceptance of 
deliverables, she is performing the Validate Scope process. That process has only one tool or technique—Inspection—
and a walkthrough is a very common way to inspect a deliverable.
Answers
This will also be a project requirement, so it will 
end up in a requirements document as well. But 
that wasn’t one of the choices in the question!

9. A. 
When one activity (such as ordering hardware) must take place a certain amount of time before another activity (installing the 
operating systems), that’s called a lead.
10. C. 
The resource calendar has information on which resources—which includes equipment and material, as well as people—are 
available at specific times. You’ll typically use it to estimate resource utilization, which you’ll need to do when you’re building the 
schedule for this project.  
11. C. 
A Finish-to-Start (FS) relationship is the most common sort of predecessor that you’ll see in a project schedule. That’s what you 
call it when one activity (imaging the machine) starts as soon as another one is finished (the operating system is installed).
12. C. 
This question is asking you to apply the PERT analysis three-point estimate. The optimistic estimate is 5 weeks, the most likely 
is 9 weeks, and the pessimistic is 13, so the three-point estimate is (5 + 4 × 9 + 13) ÷ 6 = 9 weeks.
Time Questions
Answers
Did you think that the resource calendar applied only to human 
resources? Any scarce piece of equipment is also a resource, and 
you can use a resource calendar to make sure it’s available when 
your team needs it.

exam answers
Cost Questions
13. B. 
Funding limit reconciliation means checking the project’s expenditures—how much you’ve already spent—against any limits that 
your company has on the commitments of funds. Companies typically don’t allow project managers to throw unlimited amounts 
of money at the project, so this makes sure that the project can be done within the company’s guidelines…so you can catch 
cost overruns before you’ve spent more than you’re allowed to spend! This is how you know you haven’t blown your budget—by 
comparing it against the hard limits set by your company.
14. B. 
When you’re asked to figure out the lower limit of your CPI to keep your project within its budget, you’re being asked to calculate 
the to-complete performance index (TCPI). If you’ve got a BAC, an AC, and a % complete, then you know enough to compute 
the EAC, so you should use the formula TCPI = (EAC – EV) ÷ (EAC – AC):
EV = BAC × actual % complete = $75,000 x 70% = $52,500
AC = $56,000
CPI = EV ÷ AC = $52,500 ÷ $56,000 = 0.9375
EAC = BAC ÷ CPI = $80,000
TCPI = (EAC – EV) ÷ (EAC – AC) = ($80,000 - $52,500) ÷ ($80,000 – $56,000) = 1.18
15. D. 
The first step in figuring this out is to figure out the actual % complete, which you can do by figuring that you’ve installed 3,570 
of the total 7,500 lightswitches, or 3,575 ÷ 7,500 = 47.6%. Then you can use the formulas, which show you that CPI is .7597, 
telling you that you’ve exceeded your budget:
Actual % complete = 47.6%
AC = $153,500 (but since this doesn’t tell you anything about your schedule, answer A is incorrect)
EV = BAC × actual % complete = $245,000 x 47.6% = $116,620
CV = EV – AC = $116,620 - $153,500 = –$36,880 (since the CV is negative, you’re below your budget, so answer C is 
incorrect; the CV in this case is negative)
CPI = EV ÷ AC = $116,620 ÷ $153,500 = .7597
EAC = BAC ÷ CPI = $245,000 ÷ .7597 = $322,495 
ETC = EAC – AC = $322,495 – $153,500 = $168,995 (which doesn’t actually tell you whether or not you’re within your 
budget, so answer B is incorrect)
16. A. 
A really common way of doing parametric estimation involves entering numbers into a spreadsheet that performs calculations 
based on historical data gathered from previous projects. 
Answers
This looks 
like a lot of 
work, but once 
you break it 
down, it’s all 
formulas that 
you know.
So as long as your CPI doesn’t go 
below 1.18 for the rest of the 
project, you’ll still hit your budget.

17. D. 
Gaining formal acceptance of project deliverables is part of Scope Verification, which is NOT a quality activity, so it’s not 
part of the cost of quality. All of the other answers involve costs incurred in either finding defects or dealing with them once 
they’ve been found, and that’s all part of cost of quality.
18. B. 
When you’re performing quality assurance, that means that you’re looking at the way that people are doing their jobs. 
Often, it means that you’re taking a step back to look at the big picture—if many defects have the same root cause, if all of 
the processes are documented, and if they’re being followed properly. However, if you’re looking at individual deliverables, 
then you’re doing inspection, which is part of quality control, not quality assurance.
19. A. 
Statistical sampling helps you make decisions about a large number of items without having to look at every single one of 
them.
20. B. 
The Process Improvement plan is a plan that you build as part of the Plan Quality Management process that helps you 
improve the way your company does its work. This is what you use to help your team think “outside” of your project, and 
look at the company’s overall process or methodology for doing projects. 
Quality Questions
Answers
A lot of the time, when you’re performing quality 
assurance, you’re looking at ongoing processes and 
not just projects.

Human Resource Questions
21. A. 
Colocation means having most or all of your team members working in the same location. This is an 
important tool for running a team, but the question is asking about acquiring a team. Virtual teams, 
preassignment, and negotiation are all tools and techniques of Acquire Project Team.
22. C. 
Many teams go through five stages of development: forming, storming, norming, performing, and 
adjourning. The storming stage occurs early on in team development, before the team members 
are really comfortable with one another or the work. During this stage, they often have trouble 
collaborating, and are not necessarily open to one another’s ideas.
23. C. 
One of the most important interpersonal skills that a project manager has is influencing, and leading 
by example is a very effective way to do this. But when a project manager sets a bad example, it is 
almost certain to be reflected in the behavior or attitude of the team.
24. D. 
Referent power means that you have the power or ability to attract others and build loyalty. One 
effective way that people often wield referent power is to take advantage of the loyalty that the team 
already has to someone high up in the company—in this case, the CTO. 
Answers
Even if the team is in the storming phase of team 
development, they should still be expected to act in a 
professional manner—and this includes showing up to meetings 
on time.

25. C. 
Since Sue is in the high-power, low-interest quadrant, she needs to be kept satisfied. This means that she has to feel that 
her needs are actually being met, but since she’s not following the project on a day-to-day basis, the only way you can 
do that is by delivering a final product that meets those needs. Bob is low-power, high-interest, so he needs to be kept 
informed. This means that he needs to feel like he’s constantly in the loop on important decisions, even if he won’t actively 
be taking part in them. 
26. D. 
This is a basic “lines of communication” problem—you need to figure out how many people are communicating. In this 
case it’s six team members, four stakeholders, two subcontractors…and don’t forget the project manager! That’s 6 + 4 + 2 
+ 1 = 13 people. The formula is n(n – 1) ÷ 2 = 13(12) ÷ 2 = 78.
27. B. 
The definition of a stakeholder includes “anyone who is directly impacted by your project.” That means this person is a 
stakeholder! Since you never spoke to this person, you failed to identify him as a stakeholder, and as a result you did not 
meet his needs.
28. B. 
When you’re making relevant information available to your project’s stakeholders, you’re performing the Manage 
Communications process. The power/interest grid is a useful tool, but it’s not part of Manage Communications.
Communications Questions
Answers
Tools and techniques like a Stakeholder 
Management strategy or stakeholder register 
are great, but they don’t work well if you 
haven’t identified all of the project’s 
stakeholders.

Risk Questions
29. C. 
The question asked for “quantitative techniques,” which means that it’s asking about tools and 
techniques in the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Even though the Probability and 
Impact matrix assigns numbers to risks, it’s not one of those tools and techniques—in fact, it’s not 
a quantitative technique at all! It’s a qualitative technique, because it’s used for prioritization and 
categorization.
30. C. 
This is an example of risk mitigation, because you are taking steps to deal with the problem just in 
case it happens.
31. C. 
The management reserve is the part of the budget reserved for unplanned risks. If a risk was on the 
risk register, it was planned for, and the contingency reserve is used to pay for it. In this case, since 
the management reserve was used, that means the risk wasn’t planned for at all.
32. A. 
When the other team built that tool, that presented an opportunity. Asking the team to share the tool 
with you is your way of taking advantage of it. That’s called exploiting the opportunity. 
Answers
Did the word “accept” throw you? Make sure that you always 
read the whole question, and don’t just take a single word out 
of context!
Even though the word “share” appeared in the question, since 
only one party—your team!—is benefiting from the action, 
you’re exploiting the opportunity, not sharing it. Since your use 
of the tool doesn’t benefit the other team at all, this isn’t an 
opportunity for them.

The fixed-price contract is the riskiest type of contract that a seller can take on. When the project’s costs exceed the price 
of the contract, the seller has to pay for the overrun. 
34 A. 
Claims administration is what you do when there are contested changes to the contract, and the seller and buyer can’t 
reach an agreement on the change. Any time you see a dispute or appeal between the buyer and seller and there’s no 
clear resolution, that’s where claims administration comes into play.
35. D.
When a buyer and seller have a teaming agreement, the seller acts as a partner with the buyer. It’s not just a typical 
“here’s the terms, you go off and do the work” relationship that a lot of sellers and buyers have. Instead, the buyer asks for 
the seller’s input, and makes the seller an active part of the management of the project.
36. C. 
A document that defines the portion of work the contractor will do is the procurement statement of work (SOW). It’s a clear, 
concise, unambiguous, and complete document that describes the work that must be done, and can include specifications 
of deliverables. But it doesn’t include contract terms—those terms are part of the contract itself.
Procurement Questions
Answers
When a seller works on a project with a teaming agreement, the team 
members from both the buyer’s and seller’s teams usually have a lot of 
mutual respect. That’s why this is a really effective way to do procurement.
 This is usually bad for the buyer, too! 
Contracting works best when it’s a win-win 
situation for both the buyer and the seller.

37. C. 
Tom is a low-power, high-interest stakeholder. The project manager on the project should work to keep him informed. 
38. D. 
The project manager is performing the Control Stakeholder Engagement process. The outputs of Control Stakeholder 
Engagement are work performance information, change requests, Project Management plan updates, project document 
updates, and organizational process asset updates. The question mentioned most of these outputs.
39. B.
Joanne is a resistant stakeholder.  If she is attempting to cancel the project, she is not onboard with the benefits the 
project might bring.

Before you look at the answers...
Before you find out how you did on the exam, here are a few 
ideas to help make the material stick to your brain. Remember, 
once you look through the answers, you can use these tips to 
help you review anything you missed.
 Don’t get caught up in the question.
If you find yourself a little confsued about a question, the first thing you 
should do is try to figure out exactly what it is the question is asking. It’s 
easy to get bogged down in the details, especially if the question is really 
wordy. Sometimes you need to read a question more than once. The 
first time you read it, ask yourself, “What’s this question really about?”
1
This is especially useful 
for conflict resolution 
questions—the ones where 
you’re presented with a 
disagreement between 
two people and asked how 
you’d handle it.
 Write your own questions.
Is there a concept that you’re just not getting? One of the best ways that 
you can make it stick to your brain is to write your own question about 
it! We included Question Clinic exercises in Head First PMP to help you 
learn how to write questions like the ones you’ll find on the exam. And 
if you visit http://www.headfirstlabs.com/PMP, you’ll find a 
fill-in form to help you construct your own questions—and you can see 
questions that other people have written. And that’s all going to help 
you understand the material better.
3
When you write your own question, you 
do a few things: 
•	You reinforce the idea and make 
it stick to your brain. 
•	You think about how questions are 
structured. 
•	 By thinking of a real-world 
scenario where the concept is used, you 
put the idea in context and learn how 
to apply it.
 And all that helps you recall it better.!
Try this stuff out on your job.
Everything you’re learning about for the PMP exam is really practical. 
If you’re actively working on projects, then there’s a really good chance 
that some of the ideas you’re learning about can be applied to your job. 
Take a few minutes and think about how you’d use these things to make 
your projects go more smootly.

The scope baseline contains the WBS and 
project scope statement, so you’ll find 
constraints and assumptions there, too!
1. Answer: C
Just because the change will help the project’s timeline doesn’t mean that it will be an overall 
benefit to the project. It’s important to check how the project will impact the other two constraints 
as part of your change request. Once you know all the facts about the change, the change 
control board can make an informed decision about how to proceed. 
2. Answer: A
Work performance data is what you’re doing when you look at the work that the team is 
performing in order to determine whether the project is ahead or behind schedule. A really 
good way to do that is to use schedule variance (SV) and schedule performance index (SPI) 
calculations.
3. Answer: B
Quality audits are when your company reviews your project to make sure that you are following 
all of the processes in your company correctly. They are a tool of the Perform Quality Assurance 
process.
4. Answer: A
When a change has been approved, you always need to update the baseline and then 
implement the change. That way, you will be sure to track your performance versus new scope 
and schedule expectations and not the old ones. 
5. Answer: A
Translating your communications into a different language so that they can be transmitted to 
someone else is an example of encoding. 
6. Answer: A
The project Scope Management plan is a really important tool in your project. It tells you exactly 
how you’ll create the project scope, define the WBS, verify that the work has been done, and 
make changes to the scope. But it doesn’t tell you about specific assumptions that you and 
the team have made, or constraints on your project. To find those, you should look in the 
requirements documentation and the project scope statement.

7. Answer: A
Stakeholder analysis is one of the tools and techniques of the Identify Stakeholders process. 
And that shouldn’t really be a surprise. After all, the goal of stakeholder analysis is to write down 
the needs of your stakeholders. Identify Stakeholders is the only process in the Stakeholder 
Management knowledge area that is part of the Initiating process group.
8. Answer: C
It’s not enough that the project manager approves of the Project Management plan; it needs to be 
approved by all of the stakeholders in the project. Everyone on the team should feel comfortable 
with the processes that are going to be used to do the work. 
9. Answer: B
The most expensive defects are the ones introduced when the product is being designed. This is a 
little counterintuitive at first, but it really makes sense once you think about how projects are run. If 
your team introduces a defect into a product while it’s being assembled, then they have to go back 
and fix it. But if there’s a flaw in the design, then you have to halt production and go back and figure 
out all the things that flaw affected. You may have to order new parts, reassemble components, 
and maybe even go back and redesign the product from the ground up.
10. Answer: A
This question is asking you to create a forecast using estimate to complete (ETC), which uses 
CPI to project how much money is likely to be spent for the rest of the project. The first step is to 
plug the numbers into the formula EAC = BAC / CPI, which yields EAC = $80,000 / .95 = $84,210. 
That’s how much money you’re likely to spend on the project. Now you can figure out ETC = EAC – 
AC = $84,210 – $25,000 = $59,210.
That’s why your Quality Management processes are 
so focused on reviewing EVERY deliverable—not 
just the final product, but all of the components, 
designs, and specifications, too.

11. Answer: B
Decomposition is the main tool for creating the WBS. It just means breaking the work down into 
smaller and smaller pieces based on how your company does the work until it is small enough to 
categorize and organize hierarchically. 
12. Answer: C
Quality Management is all about making sure that the product you are building conforms to your 
customer’s requirements. If you have done a good job of gathering and understanding those 
requirements, all of the measurements you take on your project should help you see if what you 
are building will make your clients satisfied in the end. 
13. Answer: D
The Communications Management plan defines all of the processes that will be used for 
communication on the project. 
14. Answer: D
The work authorization system is a part of your company’s enterprise environmental factors, and 
it’s generally part of any change control system. It defines how work is assigned to people. If 
work needs to be approved by specific managers, the work authorization system will make sure 
that the right people are notified when a staff member’s work assignments change. 
15. Answer: A
There are a few really important ethical issues in this question. Your senior management was 
clear about the rules: go with the lowest bidder. And that’s what you should do. But on top of that, 
you shouldn’t choose your sellers based on perks that you’ll get—that’s called a bribe. And you 
should always refuse bribes.
16. Answer: C
The RACI matrix shows roles and responsibilities on your project. RACI stands for Responsible, 
Accountable, Consulted, Informed. Some people on your project will be responsible for activities; 
others might be accountable for them. The RACI matrix is a table that shows people and how 
they relate to the work that is being done.

17. Answer: B
Some questions on the exam might ask you about how to operate in another country. In this case, 
the question is about whether or not something is a bribe. Clearly, if it’s a bribe, you can’t pay it. But 
is it? If a payment to a government official (or anyone else) is customary, then it’s not a bribe. You 
should go ahead and pay the police—as long as it’s acceptable and legal in that country.
18. Answer: D
Confronting means figuring out the cause of the problem and fixing it. That’s the best way to be 
sure that the right decision is made. 
19. Answer: D
The most important part of the Control Quality process is that your team has to inspect each 
deliverable in order to verify that it meets its requirements. So what do you need to do that? Well, 
obviously you need the deliverables! And quality checklists are really useful too, because they help 
you inspect each deliverable. You need work performance data, because that tells you how well the 
team is doing the job. But validated changes aren’t an input—they’re the output! 
20. Answer: D
You can’t do anything about the problem until you understand it. You should meet with the client to 
get a better understanding of what went wrong and why the product is not meeting their needs. 
21. Answer: C
Your risk register is one of the most important project management tools that you have—that’s 
why you review it and go over your risks at every meeting. Any time you come across a new 
risk, the first thing you should do is document it in the risk register. It’s really easy to lose track of 
risks, especially when you’re running a big project. By adding every risk to the register, you make 
sure that you don’t forget about any of them. So once you’ve identified the risk, what’s the next 
step? You analyze the impact and probability of the risk! That’s what the Perform Qualitative Risk 
Analysis process is for. You shouldn’t take any other action until you’ve analyzed the risk. The 
reason is that it might turn out that the risk is very unlikely, and there might be another risk with a 
higher probability and larger impact that deserves your attention.  
(If you’re wondering why the defect repairs are recommended rather than approved, it’s 
because those defect repairs still need to go through change control! After all, there are 
some defects that are just not worth repairing, but only the stakeholders on the change 
control board can determine which ones are worth it and which ones aren’t.)
(Sometimes a bribe isn’t money. Sometimes it’s not 100% clear if something even is a bribe. 
But if you see an exam question where you’re getting any reward for doing your normal job, 
make sure you treat that reward as a bribe—and refuse it!)

22. Answer: D
Tom is using a template. As your company completes projects, the documents created along the 
way are stored in an organizational process asset library. The WBSes from those past projects 
can be a great way to be sure that you are thinking of all of the work that you will need to do 
from the very beginning. Your project will never match the old WBS exactly, but there could 
be work packages listed there that you might not have thought of on your own but really are 
necessary in your project. 
23. Answer: A
The project charter does several important things: it lays out the project requirements, describes 
an initial summary milestone schedule, documents the business case, and identifies initial 
risks, assumptions, and constraints. But most importantly, a project charter identifies the project 
manager, and assigns him or her the authority necessary to get the job done.
24. Answer: B
You need to figure out the root cause of the problem if you are going to find a lasting solution 
to it. The best choice is to meet with the manager and understand why he offered the team 
members to you and what you can do to work together to find the right people for your team. It’s 
possible that he has some information about those staff members that make them a good fit 
after all. 
25. Answer: C
The point of total assumption is the point at which the seller assumes the costs. In a firm fixed-
price contract, this is the point where the costs have gotten so large that the seller basically runs 
out of money from the contract and has to start paying the costs.

As a certified project management professional, it’s your duty to respect copyrights. Purchased software is

28. Answer: B
If you want to evaluate how the project is doing with respect to the schedule and budget, you need to calculate 
CPI and SPI. The first step is to write down the information you have so far: BAC = $450,000, planned % 
complete = 45%, actual % complete = 40%, and AC = $165,000. Now you can calculate PV = BAC x planned 
% complete = $450,000 x 45% = $202,500. And you can calculate EV = BAC x actual % complete = $450,000 
x 40% = $180,000. Now you have the information you need to calculate CPI and SPI. CPI = EV / AC = 
$180,000 / $165,000 = 1.09, which is above 1.0—so your project is within its budget. And you can calculate 
SPI = EV / PV = $180,000 / $202,500 = .89, which is below 1.0—so your project is behind schedule.
29. Answer: D
Sometimes Validate Scope happens before Control Scope, and sometimes it happens afterward—and 
sometimes it happens both before AND afterward. That actually makes a lot of sense when you look at what 
those two processes do, and how they interact with each other. You always perform some Validate Scope 
activities at the end of your project, because you need to verify that the last deliverable produced includes all 
of the work laid out for it in the scope statement. Most projects will almost certainly have gone through Control 
Scope before then. So it might seem like Control Scope always happens before Validate Scope. But you don’t 
just perform Validate Scope at the end—you actually do it after every deliverable is created, to make sure that 
all the work for that deliverable was done. Not only that, but sometimes Validate Scope fails because your team 
didn’t do all of the work that was needed—that’s why change requests are an output of Validate Scope. And 
if those changes include scope changes, then your project will end up going through Control Scope again—
possibly for the first time in the project, if this is the first scope change you’ve had to make. So Control Scope 
can happen before Validate Scope, but it can also happen afterward as well. That’s why there’s no prescribed 
order for those two processes: they can happen in any order. 
30. Answer: A
When there’s a dispute between a buyer and a seller, that’s called a claim. Most contracts have some language 
that explains exactly how claims should be resolved—and since it’s in the contract, it’s legally binding, and both 
the buyer and seller need to follow it. Usually it’s not an option to renegotiate a contract, especially at the end 
of the project after the work is complete, and lawsuits should only be filed if there are absolutely, positively no 
other options.
When a question says that you don’t have enough money in the 
budget to do something that will keep your project from being 
late, then your project will be late. That’s why time and cost 
are two of the constraints you have to deal with.
Answer D is wrong because you can’t just terminate a contract, since it’s legally 
binding. But if a contract does eventually get terminated early during claims 
administration, you do have to follow any termination procedures in the contract.

792    Chapter 16
31. Answer: C
When you’re performing the Close Procurements process, you’re closing out work done by a seller 
for a contract. To do that, you do a few things: you verify that all of the work and deliverables are 
acceptable, you finalize any open claims, and in case of early termination, you follow the termination 
clause in the contract. On the other hand, when you’re performing the Close Project or Phase 
process, you’re finalizing all of the various activities that you do across all of the process groups, and 
you’re also verifying that the work and deliverables are complete.
32. Answer: B
Of all of the contract types listed in the question, the Time and materials (T&M) contract is the riskiest 
kind of contract for the buyer, because if the cost of the materials gets really high then they’re passed 
along to the buyer—and the seller doesn’t have any incentive to keep them down! (It’s true that cost 
plus award fee (CPAF) could involve paying an additional fee to the seller, but that fee is based entirely 
on the buyer’s subjective evaluation of the seller’s performance, which lowers the risk.)
33. Answer: A
Gold plating is when you or your team add more work to the project that was not requested by the 
sponsor or client. It is always a bad idea to gold-plate a project because the impact is sometimes not 
immediately known. Sometimes, a feature that might seem really useful to your team is actually a 
detriment to the client. Gold-plated features can also introduce bugs that slow down later development. 
34. Answer: C
This is an example of accepting a risk. The team can’t do anything about the weather, so the project 
manager has accepted the fact that they could end up being delayed by it. 
35. Answer: B
A watchlist is where you keep risks that don’t have a high enough probability or impact to make it into the 
risk register but still need to be monitored. By recording the risk in a watchlist, you will have a reminder 
to check to be sure that circumstances haven’t changed as your project goes on. That should give you 
enough time to come up with a risk response strategy if circumstances change as time goes on.

The Project Management plan is not a bar chart (or a Gantt chart). It’s the collection of all of the 
planning documents you create through all of the knowledge areas within the five process groups. 
It describes how your project will handle all of the activities associated with your project work. 
37. Answer: A
Validate Scope is the Monitoring and Controlling process for the Scope Management knowledge 
area. It doesn’t have anything to do with planning out the scope of the project—you do it as you 
complete each project phase to make sure that your team has completed all of the project work.  
38. Answer: C
Cost aggregation is used to build your budget, but it is not a tool for cost estimation. Bottom-up,

39. Answer: A
A control chart is a really valuable tool for visualizing how a process is doing over time. By taking 
one measurement after another and plotting them on a line chart, you can get a lot of great 
information about the process. Every control chart has three important lines on it: the mean (or the 
average of all data points), an upper control limit, and a lower control limit. There’s an important 
rule called the rule of seven that helps you interpret control charts. That rule tells you that if you 
find seven consecutive measurements that are on the same side of the mean, there’s something 
wrong. That’s because it’s extremely unlikely for seven measurements like that to occur—it’s much 
more likely that there’s a problem with your process. If you can figure out an improvement to fix 
that, you’ll have a lot fewer defects to repair later!
40. Answer: B
The PMP Code of Professional Conduct states that you must follow every law, no matter how

Once you’ve figured out the impact of the change to your schedule, budget, and scope, the 
next step is to take the change request to the change control board. If they approve your

When you work with a union, then the union contract can have an impact on your project. That

A change control board (or CCB) is a group of people that approves or rejects changes. It usually

Stakeholder analysis means talking to the stakeholders and figuring out their needs, and it’s 
something that you do when you’re defining the project scope. If there’s an important client who 
has needs that your project is supposed to fulfill, that client is always a stakeholder. And if your 
project is not meeting that client’s needs, then you didn’t do a good enough job when you were 
performing stakeholder analysis!

processes comes next. So what clues do you have to tell you where you are in the project lifecycle? Well, you’ve just 
been authorized to manage a new project. Since the project charter is what authorizes a project manager to work on 
a project, it means that the Develop Project Charter process has just been performed. So which of the processes in 
the list comes next? The other Initiating process: Identify Stakeholders.
Any time you create recommended 
corrective actions, they go through

73. Answer: C
The expected monetary value (or EMV) of the problems integrating the component is the 
probability (20%) times the cost ($3,000), but don’t forget that since it’s a risk, that number 
should be negative. So its EMV is 20% x $3,000 = –$600. The savings from not having to build 
the component from scratch is an opportunity. It has an EMV of 40% x $10,000 = $4,000. Add 
them up and you get –$600 + $4,000 = $3,400.

The best thing that you can do with a risk is avoid it—if you can prevent it from happening, it

The WBS dictionary always corresponds to an entry in the WBS by name and work package 
ID. So that’s the easiest way to cross-reference the two. The statement of work describes the

it. Schedule milestones are any set dates that will affect the work. The quality requirements 
describe how we will know if the work has been done properly. The resource and cost estimates 
are just a list of how many people will be needed to do the work and how much it will cost.

The Staffing Management plan includes a “Reward and Recognition” section that describes how you’ll reward your

91. Answer: C
It’s pretty obvious just from a quick glance at the numbers that this project is in trouble. The total budget for 
completion is 900 panels x $75 per panel = $67,500, and your actual costs are already $45,000. But if you look at 
all the answers, every one of them could potentially be correct: you know that you’re pretty far below budget, so the 
CPI will be below 1 and the CV will be negative. And since you should have completed 400 panels, you’re behind 
schedule, so you know your SPI will also be below 1. So which of the answers is right? There’s only one way to 
find out: do the calculations. Actual % complete is 350 ÷ 900 = 38.9% so PV = $67,500 x .389 = $26,258. Planned 
% complete is 400 ÷ 900 = 44.4%, so PV = $67,500 x .444 = $29,970. CPI = $26,258 ÷ $45,000 = .584, and CV 
= $26,258 – $45,000 = –$18,742, so neither of those numbers matches the answers for A and B. And for answer 
D, SPI = $26,258 ÷ $29,970 = .876, which doesn’t match, either. But for answer C, TCPI = ($67,500 – $26,258) ÷ 
($67,500 – $45,000) = 1.833, which does match the answer. Answer C is correct.

A resource histogram is just a way to visualize the number of people in each role that you will need on your project 
as time goes on. Once you have figured out your schedule and the order of activities, you figure out how many 
people it’s going to take to do the work and plot that out over time. Then you have a good idea of what the staffing 
needs of your project will be. 
94. Answer: D
Change control is how you deal with changes to your Project Management plan. And a change control system is the 
set of procedures that lets you make those changes in an organized way. A typical change control system includes a 
change control board, utilizes a project management information system, and ends with either approval or rejection. 
That’s why the payment system is one of the 
Administer Contracts tools and techniques, and not 
part of Close Procurements—you can’t close out 
the contract until it’s been paid.
Stakeholder analysis is important, but 
it’s not part of change control.

Since the CFO is affected by your project, that means he’s a stakeholder. The best thing you 
can do in this situation is get the new stakeholder’s opinion incorporated in the project up front. 
It’s important that all of the project stakeholders understand the needs and objectives that the 
project is meant to address. The worst case is to have the stakeholder’s opinion incorporated at 
the end of the project—that could mean a lot of rework or even an entirely unacceptable product. 
109. Answer: D
An important part of identifying stakeholders is reviewing lessons learned from prior projects 
(because they may help you identify stakeholder issues early), performing stakeholder analysis 
(which often involves a power/interest grid), and reviewing procurement documents (because a 
contract often brings extra stakeholders with it). However, you don’t create the change control

Pareto charts plot out the frequency of defects and sort them in descending order. The right axis

by 20% of the root causes you can identify. So if you do something about that small number of 
causes, you can have a big impact on your project.

data. Work performance data is a name for all of the actual data that comes from the work your 
team is doing.

172. Answer: A
Lessons learned are some of your most important organizational process assets. At the end of every 
project, you sit down with the project team and write down everything you learned about the project. 
This includes both positive and negative things. That way, when you or another project manager in 
your company plans the next project, you can take advantage of the lessons you learned on this one.
173. Answer: D
Once you’ve closed out a contract, it’s important to conduct a procurement audit. This is where you go 
over everything that happened on the project to figure out the lessons learned, and look for anything 
that went right or wrong.
174. Answer: A
“Force majeure” is a kind of clause that you’ll see in a contract. It says that if something like a war, riot, 
or natural disaster happens, you’re excused from the terms of the contract.
175. Answer: D
Ground rules help you prevent problems between team members, and let you establish working 
conditions that everyone on the team can live with. You set up the ground rules for a project to help 
guide people in their interactions with each other. Make sure you discuss the ground rules with the 
team during the kickoff meeting!
176. Answer: A
One of the most important things that you do as a project manager is to constantly monitor the project 
for changes, and take the appropriate action whenever you make a change. But changes don’t 
happen on any sort of schedule—if they did, it would make project management a whole lot easier! 
That means you need to continuously monitor your project to figure out whether or not its plans and 
scope need to change. 
177. Answer: B
This question is basically asking you the difference between change requests and change request 
status updates. Change request status updates are outputs from Perform Integrated Change Control, 
not Monitor and Control Project Work.
It’s really important that you work with the 
team to write down the lessons you’ve learned, 
because they have a lot of insight into what 
went right and wrong on the project.
You can think of Change Requests as what you get when someone finds 
a problem and needs to make a change. Once you’ve figured out whether 
or not to do that change (in Perform Integrated Change Control), you 
give the person an update on its status.

178. Answer: C
You can’t know the answer to technical questions as well as your team. So, while it’s important to 
understand both sides of the issue, your job is to make sure that problems are confronted and fairly 
evaluated. 
179. Answer: D
Parametric estimation is a tool for creating estimates. It’s not a deliverable. 
180. Answer: D
The WBS dictionary is an output of the Create WBS process. It is created along with the WBS and 
gives all of the details about each work package in the WBS.
181. Answer: C
This question isn’t hard if you remember one really important fact: you need your team’s help when 
you’re writing the lessons learned. That’s why you can’t release the team until the lessons learned 
are documented and added to the organizational process assets. Also, the last thing you do on the 
project is close the contract. The reason for this is that you don’t want to have to wait for payment 
before releasing the team, because most contracts have payment terms that allow for some period 
of time before full payment is required. 
182. Answer: D
The kickoff meeting gets all of the stakeholders together to explain how communication will go. 
That way, everyone knows who to talk to if things go wrong or they run into any questions. 
183. Answer: A
Not every change needs to be made. Before you make any change, you always need to evaluate 
its impact on the triple constraint—time, cost, and scope—and how those changes will affect the 
quality of the deliverables. Until you analyze that impact, there’s no way to know whether or not it 
makes sense to make the change.
The team always needs to help you document 
the lessons learned for the project.

184. Answer: B
The idea behind net present value (or NPV) is that you can compare potential projects by 
figuring out how much each one is worth to your company right now. You figure out a project’s 
NPV out by coming up with how much the project is worth, and then subtracting how much it will 
cost. If you’re asked to choose between projects and given the NPV of each of them, choose the 
one with the biggest NPV. That means you’re choosing the one with the most value!
185. Answer: C
It’s easy to get change, defects, and corrective actions mixed up—they’re all words that 
sound suspiciously similar! Just remember: a defect is any deliverable that does not meet 
its requirements. A defect is not always caused by a mistake—defects can come from lots of 
sources, and team members’ errors only cause some defects. For example, plenty of defects 
are caused by equipment problems. 
186. Answer: D
Forcing means putting your foot down and making a decision. One person wins, one person 
loses, and that’s the end of that. 
187. Answer: B
The project scope statement is where you figure out exactly what your stakeholders need, and 
turn those needs into exactly what work the team will do to give them a great product. Any 
constraints or assumptions that need to be made to determine the work need to be written down 
in the scope statement as well. 
188. Answer: C
You can figure out the actual cost that was spent on a project, even if all you’re given are some 
of the project metrics. In this case, if you only have CPI and EV, you can figure out the AC by 
writing down the formula that has all three of them: CPI = EV / AC. Now flip the formula around: 
AC = EV / CPI = $172,500 / .92 = $187,500.
Don’t forget that the Project Management plan itself is a 
deliverable! That means that it can have defects, too—a lot 
of companies have specific standards and requirements that 
every project plan must meet. And if a defect is found in the 
plan after the work has started, then you need to go through 
change control to repair it!

Exam Questions
Answers
189. Answer: A
Changes are found in Monitor and Control Project Work; they are approved in Perform Integrated 
Change Control, and implemented in Direct and Manage Project Execution. When you are monitoring 
and controlling the project work, you are always looking for changes that might need to be made to 
your plan and assessing their impact. Then you present those changes to the change control board for 
approval. If they approve, you implement them in the Direct and Manage Project Execution process—
that’s where all the work gets done. 
190. Answer: A
A work breakdown structure is the best way to visualize all of the work that will be done on your project. 
It divides all of the work up into work packages and shows how it fits into higher-level categories. By 
looking at the WBS, you can communicate to other people just how much work is involved in your 
project.
191. Answer: B
Over half of the conflicts on projects come from resources, priorities, and schedules. It can be tough to 
get resources assigned to projects, especially if they have skills that are in high demand. Sometimes 
multiple projects (and even roles within projects) are vying to get top priority. Finally, you probably don’t 
need to think too hard to remember a conflict about schedules on a project you’ve worked on—many 
projects start with overly aggressive deadlines that cause conflicts from the very beginning.
192. Answer: D
When do you gather work performance information? You do it when you’re reporting on the performance 
of the team—that’s why it’s a tool and technique of the Control Communications process. But that’s not 
something you do during Control Risks—work performance information is an input to that process, which 
means it needs to be gathered before you start controlling your risks.
Some questions on the PMP exam will describe tools 
or techniques rather than using their names. A question 
might say “bringing in an outside party to review your risk 
response strategies” instead of “risk audit.” You’re actually 
asked about concepts you’ve learned, not just about a 
bunch of things you’ve memorized.

You should always use formal written communication when you are communicating with clients 
about changes in your project. 
194. Answer: C
The project charter is created long before you start identifying work packages and activities. 
Those things are done as part of the project planning, which happens only after the project 
charter is completed. 
195. Answer: C
Positive risks are opportunities that could happen on your project. The strategies for dealing with 
them are all about making sure that your project is in a position to take advantage of them or at 
least share in them with other projects if possible. 
196. Answer: D
The RBS is part of the Risk Management plan. It’s structured very similarly to an WBS. The 
RBS helps you to see how risks fit into categories so you can organize your risk analysis and 
response planning. 
197. Answer: B
The PMP Code of Professional Conduct says that you’re not allowed to accept any kind of gift, 
not even if it’s after the project has finished. That would be the same thing as taking a bribe.
198. Answer: D
This is a tough situation for any project manager. You’ve got a problem that’s happened, and 
you didn’t plan for it. Now it’s going to cost you money. What do you do? Well, you can’t just 
accept it and move on—that’s only something you do with risks that have no other option. You 
have options with a problem that happens during your project. And you can’t just go to the boss, 
because you’re the project manager and it’s your job to figure out what to do. There’s no use in 
doing risk planning, because you already know the probability (100%) and impact (the cost of 
fixing the problem). So what do you do?

So how’d you do?
PMI uses a scoring system called the “Modified Agnoff Technique” 
(which it explains in the PMP Handbook, available for download 
from their website), which makes it a little hard to predict 
exactly how you’ll do. But if you’re scoring in the 80% to 90% 
range on this exam, then you’re in really good shape.

Answers
That’s where your reserve comes in. There are two kinds of reserves: a contingency reserve and a 
management reserve. The contingency reserve is what you use for “known unknowns”—you use 
it to pay for risks that you’ve planned for. But this situation isn’t like that. That’s why you tap into 
the management reserve. That’s the money in the budget you set aside for “unknown unknowns”—
problems that you didn’t plan for but which came up anyway. 
199. Answer: B
When you have a project that’s broken up into subprojects or phases, it’s important that you 
perform the Initiating processes at the beginning of the project. Answer B is the one that best 
describes something that happens during the processes in the Initiating group—performing the 
Identify Stakeholders process.
200. Answer: B
This question looks hard, but it’s actually pretty easy if you remember that Control Stakeholder 
Engagement is just an ordinary Monitoring and Controlling process—it’s the one for the 
Stakeholder Management knowledge area. Once you know that, it’s easy to pick out the output that 
doesn’t fit! When you’re handling a change in a Monitoring and Controlling process, you update 
your project plan and organizational process assets, and you request changes. But you don’t 
create deliverables.
