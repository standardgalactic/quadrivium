Dedication
I dedicate this book to my children: Jordan, Dalton, Paige, Teegan, Ethan, 
Noah, and Addison. Each of you brings a unique and special joy to my life. 
Life with kids in general — but with seven kids especially — is chaotic, loud, 
stimulating, frustrating, motivating, and inspiring. I can’t imagine life without 
all of the challenges and the rewards of being your father. Your inspiration 
helps me get through the downs and truly enjoy the ups in life. I consider it a 
privilege to learn from each of you each day. Tony Bradley
I would like to dedicate this book to my family; Lilam, Swati, and our dearly 
departed son, Sachin. Each one inspired me during the process, especially 
Sachin, spreading his infectious smile with those beautiful blue eyes looking 
over me as a guardian angel. We all love you and miss you, beta.   Satish Shah

Authors’ Acknowledgments
I want to thank my wife and my children first and foremost. It is a privilege 
and a joy to be able to work from home and spend so much time with them. 
I will always be thankful that I have had this opportunity. My family is my 
inspiration and they drive me to be the best that I can be.
I would like to thank my coauthor, Satish Shah. It has been an honor to call 
him my colleague when we were partners at the same company. He has been 
a tremendous mentor for me in the field of unified communications and a 
good friend. His contributions to this book helped not only to ensure that 
the book was completed and eventually published, but greatly increased the 
quality and value of the content. 
I would also like to thank some other people who have helped to develop 
my knowledge and skills and guide my career in ways big and small. I want 
to thank Stewart Tan, Scott Paladino, Mike Borkin, Stuart McClure, George 
Kurtz, Marcus Ranum, Joel Dubin, Ben Rothke, and Anatoly Elberg. I also 
want to express a special thanks to Joe Schurman, a friend and fellow 
Microsoft MVP who introduced me to the world of unified communications 
and involved me in his vision. Tony Bradley
I couldn’t have written this book without the expert assistance from our 
smart and intelligent daughter, Swati, who graciously read and corrected my 
grammar or spelling and continually encouraged my progress.
My lovely wife, Lilam, has been the rock of the family and especially during 
those arduous months of writing and rewriting she was always there to sup­
port me in taking pictures or correcting them, or whatever else needed to be 
done.
Even though this is my first book, folks at Wiley treated me with respect and 
encouraged me with their assistance and support, especially Katie Mohr, 
Tiffany Ma, and Pat O’Brien, my editorial team. Thanks.  
Finally, thanks to you for believing in the premise of this book. I hope it helps 
you in your Unified Communications journey. Best wishes, Satish Shah.

Unified Communications For Dummies

Foreword 
A
t my first job I had a phone. Then they gave me the dreaded beeper to 
use when it was my weekend to monitor data center processing jobs. 
E-mail was used by a few of us in IT, but not consistently enough to be 
relied on for business critical issues.  It was all simple enough that we knew 
how to get reach people when needed, but it wasn’t always at the speed busi­
ness demanded. My boss got in at 7 A.M. and I could usually reach her until 
7:45 A.M. If there was a critical issue during the day, I had to call, or leave 
voice messages, or stroll by her office, or try to catch her walking out for 
lunch. Not exactly the model of business efficiency. 
Since then, the work environment has changed dramatically. In the last 20 
years, communications technology has leapt forward to the point where 
there are dozens of ways we can communicate with our managers, custom­
ers, colleagues, and business partners. But are we any more efficient in 
reaching who we need to and effectively collaborating? While traveling in 
India I had a consultant give me his business card. On his card there were 
eleven different ways to contact him. If I needed to reach him, which number/
e-mail/IM/social networking site was I to use? And what if I left a message on 
one and he didn’t check it for a few days? Communications is about getting 
business done; in a global market operating independently of time zones, 
failure to communicate in a timely fashion could cost you the competitive 
advantage. 
And what about the time required learning all these systems? A simple con­
ference call often requires several minutes of keying numbers and trying to 
figure out who is present on the call. A video conference takes so long to 
set-up that expensive room-based systems often sit unused and gathering 
dust unless you pay a staff member to set it up in advance. Web conferencing 
is fine if you use it frequently enough and all your colleagues are on the same 
system, but adding a new participant can be an exercise in frustration. 
Because of these issues we often fall back to simple phone calls, SMS texting, 
instant messaging, and e-mail (which is convenient but we all know the frus­
tration of phone tag and email overload!). And now with social networking 
sites proliferating, you might track three or four web sites to keep up with 
your professional and personal networks. Some managers wonder if their 
employees are still doing real work or just in a constant state of e-mail, phone 
calls, texting, and social networking!
There is a solution: a truly unified communications system that can remove 
silos of vertical systems infrastructure, multiple user interfaces, different 
communications methods, and the myriad of devices. One identity for all 

your communications: a single inbox for all your messages (including voice, 
text, and e-mail) and one identity to present your availability to the world. 
IT can then manage and administer one communications infrastructure that 
integrates into your organization’s business processes and applications.
The technology exists today. The authors of Unified Communications For 
Dummies have paved the path for your journey in this book. I have worked 
with Satish as a colleague and seen him present these topics with both clar­
ity of vision and practicality of real world experience; he makes the business 
case to the C-level executives and provides IT professionals with the depth 
of how it really gets done using his vast knowledge and expertise in unified 
communications. Now as the author, he has captured the essence of unified 
communications so that both the novice and experienced executive and com­
munications professional can understand and apply the principles in a simple 
step-by-step process. He paints the vision of where you can take your organi­
zation and shows the pragmatic steps to take, identifying the pitfalls to avoid 
along the way. Selling a vision is easy; delivering it requires the real world 
experience contained in these pages. 
I am sure you will find the guidance in this book enlightening and educational, as 
I did. Best of luck in your own organization’s unified communications journey!

Introduction
W
elcome to Unified Communications For Dummies, the book that’s writ­
ten especially for people who have this nagging feeling in the back of 
their minds that they should connect telephones and computers but haven’t 
a clue about how to or where to begin.
You’ve found the right book. Help is here, within these humble pages.
This book talks about unified communications in everyday terms. The lan­
guage is friendly; you don’t need a graduate education to get through it. And 
the occasional potshot helps unseat the hallowed and sacred traditions of 
networkdom, bringing just a bit of fun to an otherwise dry subject. The goal 
is to bring the lofty precepts of networking down to earth, where you can 
touch them and squeeze them and say, “What’s the big deal? I can do this!”
About This Book
This isn’t the kind of book you pick up and read from start to finish, as if it 
were a cheap novel. If I ever see you reading it at the beach, I’ll kick sand in 
your face. This book is more like a reference, the kind of book you can pick 
up, turn to just about any page, and start reading. It has 19 chapters, each 
one covering a specific aspect of unified communications — such as plan­
ning, or rolling out the system.
You don’t have to memorize anything in this book. It’s a need-to-know book: 
You pick it up when you need to know something. Need to know what pres­
ence is? Pick up the book. Need to know about communication clients? Pick 
up the book. Otherwise, put it down and get on with your life.
How to Use This Book
This book works like a reference. Start with the topic you want to find out 
about. Look for it in the table of contents or in the index to get going. The 
table of contents is detailed enough that you should be able to find most of 
the topics you’re looking for. If not, turn to the index, where you can find 
even more detail.

2
Unified Communications For Dummies 
After you find your topic in the table of contents or the index, turn to the 
area of interest and read as much as you need or want. Then close the book 
and get on with it.
Of course, this book is loaded with information, so if you want to take a brief 
excursion into your topic, you’re more than welcome. If you want to know the 
big security picture, read the whole chapter on security. If you just want to 
know how to create a decent password, read just the section on passwords. 
You get the idea.
If you need to type something, you see the text you need to type like this: 
Type this stuff. In this example, you type Type this stuff at the keyboard and 
then press Enter. An explanation usually follows, just in case you’re scratch­
ing your head and grunting, “Huh?”
Whenever I describe a message or information that you see on the screen, I 
present it this way:
A message from your friendly network
What You Don’t Need to Read
Aside from the topics you can use right away, much of this book is skippable. 
I carefully placed extra-technical information in self-contained sidebars and 
clearly marked them so that you can steer clear of them. Don’t read this stuff 
unless you’re really into technical explanations and want to know a little 
more of what’s going on behind the scenes. Don’t worry: My feelings won’t be 
hurt if you don’t read every word.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m making only two assumptions about who you are: You’re someone who 
works with a personal computer, and you either have a unified communica­
tions system, or you’re thinking about getting one. I hope that you know (and 
are on speaking terms with) someone who knows more about computers 
than you do. My goal is to decrease your reliance on that person, but don’t 
throw away his or her phone number yet.
Is this book useful for Macintosh users? Absolutely. Although the bulk of this 
book is devoted to showing you how to link Windows-based computers to 
form a network, you can find information about how to network Macintosh 
computers as well.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
Inside this book, you find chapters arranged in four parts. Each chapter 
breaks down into sections that cover various aspects of the chapter’s main 
subject. The chapters are in a logical sequence, so reading them in order 
(if you want to read the whole thing) makes sense. But the book is modular 
enough so you can pick it up and start reading at any point.
Here’s the lowdown on what’s in each of the seven parts.
Part I: Getting Started
The chapters in this part present a layperson’s introduction to what network­
ing is all about. This part is a good place to start if you’re clueless about what 
unified communications is and why you’re suddenly expected to use it. 
Part II: Applying Unified Communications
Uh-oh. The boss just gave you an ultimatum: Figure out a UC plan by Friday 
or pack your things. The chapters in this section cover everything you need 
to know so you can match your needs with the available technology.
Part III: Implementing Unified 
Communications 
After the fun of the courtship comes the daily domestic stuff. Step by step, 
I’ll show you how to make all those pretty promises come true when you’re 
ready to use all your new toys.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without a collection of lists of interest­
ing snippets.

Getting Started

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part provide a gentle introduction 
to unified communications, written especially for the 
user or manager who might be even more new to this than 
they’re letting on to their colleagues.
It’s okay.  We’ll keep it between us.

Chapter 1
Unified Communications 
from A to Z
In This Chapter
▶	Learning about the evolution of communications technology
▶	Merging communications methods
▶	Understanding the future of unified communications
O
ne of the most important aspects of doing business is communication. 
Users need to communicate effectively with each other, whether it is 
	
✓	A written memo
	
✓	A phone call
	
✓	An e-mail
	
✓	An instant message
	
✓	A text message on a mobile phone
Today’s business has an arsenal of communications tools at its disposal. The 
problem is in using the communications tools efficiently and productively. 
Unified communications seeks to converge the various communications 
methods together to provide a seamless communications experience. With 
unified communications, co-workers can identify whether peers are busy or 
available and can choose to reach them by whichever method is most con­
venient or best suited for the moment. Unified communications represents a 
strategic advantage for those organizations that understand and leverage its 
potential before their competitors.
Evolving From Voice to VoIP
The voice network that we have today is quickly evolving and bears less 
resemblance with each passing day to what Alexander Graham Bell envisioned 

8
Part I: Getting Started 
in 1876. The world has grown up and we need a communications system that 
can keep pace with the 21st century.
PSTN
A network of wires has grown around the world to enable parties from 
Albuquerque to Zimbabwe to simply pick up a phone and dial a number in 
order to communicate. This network is the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone 
Network).You can easily place a call to anyone, anywhere with a standard 
phone.
PBX
Traditional business telephone systems use a PBX (Private Branch 
Exchange). The PBX manages calls within the business and connects busi­
ness calls to the PSTN if necessary.
	
One of the primary advantages of a PBX was cost. If each employee phone 
within an organization were connected to the PSTN, then an internal call 
from one employee to another would have connection charges from the ser­
vice provider. By managing inter-company calls internally, the organization 
avoided paying a provider to connect those calls.
The PBX connects to the PSTN through a trunk (see Figure 1-1) to enable 
inbound and outbound calls with the public phone system. 
	
A PBX trunk isn’t like an elephant trunk or a storage trunk. In voice communi­
cations terms, a trunk is a connection between two switched networks. A busi­
ness PBX is typically connected to the PSTN using one or more trunks. 
PBXs provide a range of functions for voice communications such as:
	
✓	Hunt groups
	
✓	Account code dialing
	
✓	Call forwarding
	
✓	Call transfer
	
✓	Call park
	
✓	Three-way calling
These are just a few of the more common PBX features. The PBX is the hub 
of voice communications for most businesses and provides a vast array of 
options for managing voice calls.

These functions help businesses communicate more effectively. For example, 
a phone number dedicated to customer sales can be set up on a hunt group 
that will ring all the extensions in the sales department to ensure that some­
one gets the call and that a potential sale isn’t lost.
The Internet
In the early 1990s, a new era of communications was introduced with the 
advent of the Internet. Although the personal computer had been around for 
nearly 20 years, suddenly people and businesses could connect their PCs to 
the global network that we call the Internet and interact and communicate 
with each other.
	
Ironically, early connections from the PC to the Internet usually were over the 
PSTN:
	
✓	A modem converted the digital computer data into analog signals for 
transmission over the copper phone lines.
	
✓	Modem is short for modulator–demodulator. It’s a device that facilitates 
the conversion of digital data to analog signals and from analog signals 
to digital data.

10
Part I: Getting Started 
At the other end, another modem converted the analog signals back into 
digital data that the receiving computer could understand. With communica­
tions of all sorts moving from analog to digital, and with businesses already 
investing in switch and router technology, it didn’t take long for the data and 
telephone engineers of the world to see that the packet-switching network 
could transmit voice data. Using the same infrastructure as the data network 
offered some significant savings, and the global interconnectivity of the 
Internet meant that voice communications could be less expensive as well.
The move of voice communications onto the data network became known as 
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) because voice was now being transmitted 
over the IP (Internet Protocol) network. The transition from traditional PBX 
to IP PBX and from PSTN telephony to Internet telephony marked the begin­
ning of the unified communications evolution.
Converging Communications
Unified communications is about more than voice. The road to unified com­
munications is paved with more than the migration of traditional phone com­
munications onto the IP network. New kinds of communications use the new 
technology.
You’ve got mail!
E-mail quickly emerged as one of the primary methods of communication 
for businesses and individuals alike. It surpasses voice communications for 
many organizations. One of the factors that made e-mail compelling when it 
was introduced is that it enabled users to communicate on their own terms. 
Traditional voice communication, commonly referred to as “phone calls,” 
had a couple of significant drawbacks in the efficiency department:
	
✓	Phone calls are often an ineffective use of time:
 
• The caller may waste time calling multiple numbers trying to track 
down a person and each failed attempt to contact the individual is 
simply more wasted time.
 
• Answering a phone call is generally an interruption of something 
else.
	
✓	Phone calls are typically one-on-one conversations. If the same informa­
tion needs to be conveyed to a whole team, the caller would need to 
either
 
• Place multiple calls to repeat the same message
 
• Set up a conference call

11
 Chapter 1: Unified Communications from A to Z
E-mail overcomes these shortcomings of voice calls:
	
✓	Senders can compose and send the message when it fits their schedule.
	
✓	Recipients can read and respond to e-mail when it fits their schedule.
	
✓	E-mail can be directed to many e-mail addresses at the same time.
E-mail has a couple of other benefits that aren’t possible with traditional 
voice calls:
	
✓	It’s an automatic written record of the conversation.
	
✓	E-mail can contain more than the message itself: 
 
• Hyperlinks can access documents on the World Wide Web.
 
• File attachments can share documents, spreadsheets, and other 
data. 
Communication at the speed of light
Although e-mail is delivered almost instantly around the world, you can’t 
be sure that the recipient will actually download it or even read it. Actually, 
delivery and read receipts can be requested within most e-mail systems, 
but the recipient has the option of not responding to those requests so 
the absence of a receipt doesn’t necessarily mean that the message wasn’t 
received or read.
What’s a person to do when he wants to communicate with someone in writ­
ing, and e-mail simply isn’t fast enough? Use instant messaging. Instant mes­
saging, or chatting, is a real-time conversation between two or more parties 
via the Internet. It’s almost like a hybrid solution between voice and e-mail 
in that it offers the immediacy of a phone call with the written record and 
retention of an e-mail. Corporations didn’t immediately jump on the instant 
messaging bandwagon. Consumers were the first to see the value of instant 
messaging and corporations joined the party later, in many cases reluctantly, 
as a result of demand from users. Users started off using services such as 
AOL Instant Messenger and ICQ (Figure 1-2) at home and then installed the 
applications on their work computers so they could still keep in touch during 
the workday.

Figure 1-2: 
Instant

users then

to the 
workplace.
	
Instant messaging also offered a couple of other new advantages to the com­
munications mix:
	
✓	The instant messaging software lets users see which of their contacts 
are currently online. Obviously, if a contact isn’t online, there is no way 
to have an instant messaging conversation with that person. This rudi­
mentary capability to determine the status of a given contact forms the 
basis of presence which is a key component of unified communications. 
Presence is discussed in more depth in Chapter 2.
	
✓	Instant messaging allows for more efficient multitasking. A user can 
simultaneously participate in a voice call and instant messages. Multiple 
simultaneous voice conversations aren’t practical.
The call heard around the world
VoIP allowed a new twist on traditional handset-to-handset phone calls. 
Because a voice call on VoIP is nothing more than data packets traveling on 
the same IP-based network as all the other data, the computer itself can be 
used as the phone. 
As long as there is a microphone to speak into and speakers to hear from, the 
computer itself can be the phone. The capability to make and receive calls 
can be incorporated into virtually any software.

13
 Chapter 1: Unified Communications from A to Z
One of the first places that this functionality began to appear was within the 
instant messaging clients. From the instant messaging software, users could 
click to open a text chat window or click to initiate a voice call. Aside from 
the novelty of using the computer for voice calls, this solution also offered 
the advantage that users could connect with and talk to people around the 
world without incurring any toll call charges. The voice call was just more 
data traveling around the Internet.
	
Tying voice calls into software provides other benefits as well, such as the 
capability to either 
	
✓	Call someone by simply clicking a name in a contact list.
	
✓	Look up a phone number on the Internet and place a call by clicking the 
number. 
Can you see me now?
If you add a camera of some sort, the computer can then connect you to your 
contacts via video for a virtual “face-to-face” chat (Figure 1-3).
For home users, video conferencing may be a novelty. It’s nice to see family 
and friends who live across the country or around the world. Video calls can 
let grandparents watch as Junior opens the Nintendo Wii for his birthday, or 
let parents who have to travel on business see their children rather than just 
talking to them on the phone.
For businesses, however, video conferencing provides a variety of benefits, 
including the potential to save significant time and money. Companies spend 
huge sums of money to send people around the world to various meetings. 
They might be 
	
✓	Internal corporate meetings
	
✓	Sales meetings with prospective customers
	
✓	Meetings with partners to discuss marketing strategy
Rather than spending for airfare, hotel lodging, rental car, and dining and 
other incidental expenses, on top of the lost productivity of the travel time 
itself, video conferencing can achieve the same sort of synergistic interaction 
for a fraction of the cost.

Future of Unified Communications
Even though there is confusion in the marketplace about which unified com­
munications components make the most sense for a particular business, this 
book attempts to reduce that confusion. Presenting a clear business case for 
unified communications is easier said than done. Even though uniform stan­
dards may be lacking, the vendors have adopted Session Initiation Protocol 
(SIP) for components to converge and create unified communications. There 
is still a need for these components from various vendors to co-exist and 
integrate smoothly in the existing environment. Businesses will still need to 
define a clear ROI (return on investment) from unified communications to 
justify their investments.

15
 Chapter 1: Unified Communications from A to Z
Even with all these factors, the unified communications market continues 
to grow and play a defining role for many organizations’ IT strategy. A 2008 
report from UC Strategies claims that the unified communications market in 
2007 was only about $200 million, but also predicted that the segment would 
grow about 1,200 percent to more than $2.4 billion by 2012.
All hardware and software vendors are vying for a piece of that $2.4-billion 
market. Major vendors such as Microsoft and Cisco have promising platforms 
that have begun the convergence to where a business can form a strategy of 
co-existence. It’s true that none of the vendors’ solutions alone may provide 
you all the unified communications components.
To provide a complete unified communications solution, organizations must 
combine VoIP infrastructure and unified communications components from 
various hardware and software vendors. A key issue for enterprises with 
an existing Microsoft infrastructure will be determining which options can 
integrate smoothly and enhance or extend functionality instead of creating 
headaches. Organizations must also consider how the combined solution will 
be maintained and scaled to meet future needs. I have attempted to provide 
solutions and alternative options so that you may choose to achieve the best 
results for your organization.

Chapter 2
All Present, Say Aye
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying the presence of users in the system
▶	Integrating presence with communications tools
▶	Streamlining business processes
E
ffective communications should improve the process of communicating 
and help people to communicate . . . more effectively. That isn’t always 
the case, though. With traditional communications, things keep getting faster, 
but not necessarily more efficient.
For example, you can send a document to a customer via the postal service 
and that person will receive it in three to five business days. You can fax it 
and the individual will receive it in a couple of minutes. You can e-mail it and 
have it arrive within a matter of seconds. However, regardless of the speed 
with which the message arrives, you have no guarantee the recipient will be 
there to receive it.
Unified communications addresses this problem using the concept of pres­
ence. Presence is implemented differently from one unified communications 
vendor to the next, but the premise is the same — to provide users with a 
visual cue that enables them to quickly determine the current status and 
availability of their contacts.
There is no set combination of features or functionality that defines unified 
communications, but presence is the glue that binds them. In this chapter, I 
dive deeper into what presence is and how it helps to tie unified communica­
tions together and enable people to communicate more efficiently.
The Role of Presence
When a customer calls in to a contact center, it is important that the call 
get routed to an individual who is both available and knowledgeable in the 
right area to address the issue. Call center agents are labeled with their skill 
sets or areas of expertise, and they log in to the call center system so that 

18
Part I: Getting Started 
the system knows whether they’re available. When they take a call, the call 
center system recognizes that they’re busy and temporarily changes their 
status to unavailable so that other agents know they can’t route any other 
calls to that person right now.
This method of distributing call center communications is a rudimentary 
example of the concept of presence, and a demonstration of how presence 
helps users to communicate more efficiently (see Figure 2-1). Rather than 
blindly sending calls to agents who aren’t available or lack the proper skills, 
call center distribution helps to ensure that the call is addressed as quickly 
as possible by someone who has the skills and authority to resolve it.
	
Figure 2-1: 
Call distribu-
tion in a call 
center helps 
to ensure 
calls are 
routed to 
agents who 
are both 
capable and 
available.
	
That’s the role that presence plays within unified communications. Unified 
communications presence allows users to select the best method for the 
moment because they can see
	
✓	When their contacts are free 
	
✓	What methods of communication are available
Evolution of presence
The concept of call distribution in a contact center has been around for a 
while. For an organization that exists to resolve issues, it makes good busi­
ness sense to manage those issues as efficiently and as effectively as pos­
sible. Doing so results in both satisfied customers and the ability to handle 
higher call traffic.

19
 Chapter 2: All Present, Say Aye
Ordinary users still have issues that need to be addressed, and it would 
be beneficial to have those issues addressed by someone who is available 
and has the ability to address them. However, lacking the direct correla­
tion of “more calls = more revenue,” this simple fact escaped businesses for 
decades.
The first taste of presence for most end users came with the introduction of 
instant messaging. You can’t communicate “instantly” with someone who 
isn’t logged in, or who is otherwise occupied. So, instant messaging applica­
tions such as Windows Live Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) 
adopted visual cues (see Figure 2-2) to identify which users are available and 
which aren’t.
	
Figure 2-2: 
Windows 
Live 
Messenger 
shows 
unavailable 
users as 
grayed out.
	
In many cases, you can see 
	
✓	Whether a user is currently available
	
✓	How long that user has been connected with the instant messaging service
	
✓	Whether that person is actively typing
	
✓	If the user has been idle and appears to have stepped away 

20
Part I: Getting Started 
All these facets of presence help you to determine whether a given contact is 
available and facilitate the capability to communicate instantly.
It has taken some time for users to adapt to instant messaging and the con­
cept of presence. There is still a long way to go for many users. For example, 
many of them rely on instant messaging just to ping someone to say, “Are you 
available for a phone call?” or “Did you get that e-mail I sent you?” This sort 
of redundant communication is the opposite of communicating more effec­
tively and efficiently.
Moving beyond “Are you there?”
Presence is a keystone of unified communications. The capability to iden­
tify who is available and determine the best way to communicate with that 
person at a given time is critical to the success of unified communications. 
But, in order for presence to provide real value, it has to do more than simply 
let you know whether a given contact is currently logged in.
The capabilities of presence have to 
	
✓	Provide more information than simply “Are you there?” 
	
✓	Integrate with the tools you already use and work as automatically as 
possible
	
The last thing users need are more tools to configure and schedules to update. 
So, what features or functions should presence have?
	
✓	The capability to integrate with common calendar or scheduling tools 
and automatically update presence based on calendar availability
	
✓	Communication with phones — whether land-line or mobile — to be 
able to determine whether a user is currently engaged on a call
	
✓	Configurable groups that enable control over which users are allowed to 
communicate in which circumstances and how
	
	For example, a friend may not be able to interrupt or communicate when 
you’re busy, while a project team peer or manager can.
	
✓	Centralized management of presence so that it can be reported across 
systems and applications and doesn’t depend on a client application on 
a given computer
	
✓	The capability to integrate with other vendor systems and applications 
to extend presence functionality to all tools
	
✓	Federation with partners, vendors, suppliers, or other groups so effi­
cient communication can be applied to external business interactions

21
 Chapter 2: All Present, Say Aye
Gluing Unified Communications Together
Presence is more than just the grayed-out names found in instant messaging 
applications. In more advanced unified communications platforms, presence 
can let you know 
	
✓	Where people are at a given moment
	
✓	The topic of the meeting or call they’re engaged in
	
✓	When they will be available again
Rather than relying on you vigilantly watching their presence to see when 
they become available — a monumental waste of time — flags can be set so 
that you can receive an alert when the user’s presence status changes.
For unified communications presence to be able to provide relevant informa­
tion about a user’s status and availability, it must integrate with the user’s 
calendar, phone, mobile phone, and other tools.
Calendar
To be effective, the unified communications platform should be able to auto­
matically update presence based on the user’s schedule. That means that 
presence should integrate with common business scheduling tools such as 
Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes.
Without some type of integration with your calendar program, you would be 
required to constantly update your status — manually. Every time you have 
a meeting or conference call, you would have to also update your status to 
reflect that. But, the capability of your unified communications platform to 
determine your status based on your schedule from your calendar automates 
that process and ensures that your presence information stays up to date 
(see Figure 2-3).
Office phone
Whether it’s the phone on your desk or a software-based phone client on your 
PC, the presence status in your unified communications platform should be 
able to automatically detect when you’re on a call and update your presence:
	
✓	At a minimum, your presence should be updated to show that you’re 
unavailable any time you’re on a phone call. 
	
✓	To be an effective tool for enabling more efficient communication, pres­
ence should go one step farther and state “in a call.”

22
Part I: Getting Started 
	
	Just knowing whether an individual is available is a very rudimentary 
version of presence. But, if I know that you aren’t just busy, but on a 
call, I still may be able to communicate with you via instant messaging. 
The additional detail in the presence status enables us to multitask.
Mobile phone
Some unified communications platforms take this a step further by providing 
some sort of client or agent capability for mobile phones. Even when users 
are away from their desk — whether they’re in a meeting down the hall or 
a client site across the country — these unified communications platforms 
help people to determine the availability and the best method of communi­
cating with other users whose presence information indicates they are on 
a call. Presence information that lets users know that you are using your 
mobile phone may also impact whether they choose to engage you in an 
instant messaging session. Those little tiny keyboards aren’t quite as effec­
tive for chat sessions.
Avaya and Microsoft have embraced the integration of the mobile phone. 
Avaya One-X Communicator software and the Microsoft Office Communicator 
Mobile client have similar capabilities on compatible mobile phones:
	
✓	Telephony
	
✓	Presence
	
✓	E-mail
	
✓	Instant messaging
	
✓	Contact directory
	
Avaya and Microsoft solutions for mobile phones have some differences:
	
✓	Avaya One-X delivers visual voicemail.
	
✓	Communicator Mobile provides single-click access to join audio 
conferences.
	
Microsoft has extended the reach of its unified communications to Nokia S40 
and S60 devices and the Motorola Razr phones with the introduction of Office 
Communicator Mobile for Java. Previously, Communicator Mobile worked 
only on Windows Mobile phone platforms.

Business at the Speed of Presence
Presence, and unified communications in general, hold the promise of being 
able to help organizations work more efficiently, deliver more effectively, cut 
costs, and speed up processes. But, the realization of that promise is depen­
dent on how it is executed.
Streamlining processes
Business follows processes. Whether an organization has clearly defined or 
nicely documented processes, it follows a process of some sort.
Business processes are often inefficient. They may involve 
	
✓	Placing calls or sending e-mails to users who aren’t even in the office
	
✓	Sending requests or issues to users who don’t have the skills or author­
ity to resolve them
Presence helps enterprises function more effectively when it’s applied just 
as call distribution has been implemented in contact centers for decades. 
By ensuring that business processes are routed to the most qualified person 
currently available, the process can be streamlined and business functions 
can be executed faster (see Figure 2-4).

24
Part I: Getting Started 
	
Figure 2-4: 
Illustration 
of the logic 
of efficient 
business 
process 
flow.
	
The capability for presence to help streamline business processes is partially 
dependent on the unified communications platform being used. Some plat­
forms have more robust presence integration and provide more capabilities 
to groups or identify users, similar to the way contact center call distribution 
groups work. Assuming that the unified communications platform is capable, 
here are some questions that should be asked to design more effective busi­
ness processes:
	
✓	What level of authority is needed?
	
✓	What knowledge or skill sets are required?
	
✓	Who is available?
Simply forwarding a process along to the next available person isn’t effective 
because being available doesn’t mean they know how to handle it. Forwarding 
a process to someone who is available and has the knowledge to address it 
isn’t efficient unless that person also has the authority to address the situation.
Developing a unified communications culture
The weakest link in just about any process is the user. Unified communica­
tions and presence can help users to operate more efficiently, but they have 
to understand the tools available to them and apply them effectively to real­
ize those benefits.

25
 Chapter 2: All Present, Say Aye
Business won’t be more efficient and processes won’t be streamlined if an 
organization invests in unified communications but the end user executes it 
poorly.
Unified communications is more than just a tool; it’s a culture. Users need to 
be provided with training and guidance (refer to Section III of this book for 
more help using the unified communications tools) to enable them to make 
the shift from their traditional methods of communication, understand pres­
ence and how to apply it, and embrace unified communications.
Beyond the organization
The next step is to extend presence outside of the enterprise to customers, 
partners, vendors, and suppliers.
The time savings and efficiencies that can be gained from federating or inte­
grating presence with external entities are changing.
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 (OCS 2007) provides the 
capability to 
	
✓	Federate, or connect the OCS server with other external OCS servers 
(see Figure 2-5) 
	
✓	Integrate the instant messaging functionality with public instant messag­
ing platforms such as Windows Live Messenger and AIM

E
veryone wants better, faster communication. Some people may already 
have it to a degree but want more — and the question is why? What is so 
great about this new phenomenon called unified communications? 
Well, look at what is happening in the business world today. What challenges 
are businesses facing? Why should they look at the new world of work with 
these new tools and solutions called unified communications? 
Communications Everywhere
Everyone is bombarded with different modes of communications today — PC 
on the desk, laptop on the road, BlackBerry or smartphone in the pocket, and 
a phone on the desk. The issues are which one to use when and how, and 
how to inform colleagues, customers, and partners when to use each mode. 
Did you ever receive a voicemail asking you to look at your e-mail or vice 
versa? I used to get urgent voicemails on my desk phone and cell phone to 
check my e-mails when a crisis occurred in the workplace. 

28
Part I: Getting Started 
In today’s global economy, employees work with colleagues, customers, and 
partners across the world — in what is called “virtual teams.” Communicating 
and collaborating with them has become business critical — maybe even a 
competitive advantage if you’re doing it right. Customer and partner expecta­
tions necessitate that you be available almost anytime to stay competitive and 
deliver satisfaction.
Obviously, costs increase with the increase in number of communication 
modes that a company enables for its employees. In addition to the costs 
associated with the use of different modes of communications, the costs of 
management, monitoring, and compliance also increase exponentially. 
If a company provides its employees with five modes of communications, 
there are five ways for someone to break in and steal the company’s most 
critical data. Each mode of communication is a potential security hazard. 
How often have you heard about a bank employee’s laptop being stolen with 
clients’ secure financial data, making those clients vulnerable to someone 
doing something detrimental with the confidential information? Additionally, 
in light of major government bailouts, taxpayers are demanding that financial 
and healthcare providers be extremely transparent. The federal, state, and 
local governments, as well as the FDA, SEC, HIPPA, and Sarbanes-Oxley, all 
require companies to be compliant and archive their communications data 
for three to ten years.
Most unified communications vendors have been able to provide a software- 
or software-hardware–powered solution that unifies instant messaging; pres­
ence; audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing; e-mail; voicemail; and Enterprise 
Voice (VoIP) onto a single platform. 
They have made it easier and simpler so companies adopting unified commu­
nications don’t have to worry about multiple platform management, monitor­
ing, or compliance headaches.
	
✓	Instant messaging: The capability to chat with colleagues, customers, 
and partners instantly based on their availability and preference
	
✓	Presence: Real-time availability to chat or talk
	
✓	VoIP: Transmitting voice over the Internet Protocol
End-users can use the similar clients on a desktop, laptop, the Web, or on 
smartphones that are streamlined for all the modalities and can easily transi­
tion from one to another without any loss of experience or data. They can 
even let people know how, when, and where to reach them. If they don’t want 
to be disturbed, they can change their presence to Do Not Disturb, as shown 
in Figure 3-1.
Unified communications makes those IT guys happy because they can con­
trol, monitor, and manage less while reducing the total cost. (It makes the 
CIO and CEO happy, too!)

More organizations are realizing the benefits of unified communications 
solutions as they start using them effectively and extending their reach to 
customers and partners. Unified communications solutions facilitate produc­
tivity improvements for employees wherever their work takes them. Unified 
communication solutions also enhance the way in which employees commu­
nicate and collaborate with each other and with customers and partners.
Increased Efficiency
As soon as an employer enables employees to connect and communicate 
with colleagues and customers or partners, the barriers of distance and time 
between them are removed. Employees can make decisions faster, and that 
leads to internal efficiency as well as with customers and partners no matter 
where they are located or in which time zone.
If a company is planning to deploy a unified communications solution to its 
employees, in today’s global economy it is critical to consider mobility and 
remote access, especially for those employees who travel for business. 
Road warrior Suzy was on her way to Seattle from New York and she 
checked her mobile communicator from her smartphone. Within minutes, 
she received an urgent Instant Message from John about a serious problem. 
Suzy immediately invited Larry from the Chicago office to the IM conversa­
tion. The three of them devised a plan to tackle the crisis. John agreed that 
he would update the plan and share it with everyone via e-mail. Suzy said she 
would review it as soon as she landed in Seattle. Using traditional processes, 
John would have e-mailed his original plan to everyone and waited for input 
from everyone. That method could have taken a minimum of a day or more 
since Suzy was traveling. Using the unified communications solution and 
anywhere/anytime tools, the team averted a crisis and reached an amicable 
solution in only 30 minutes.

30
Part I: Getting Started 
Today, it is common for project/product teams to be dispersed all over the 
world and in different time zones. Such teams are commonly known as “vir­
tual teams.” Unified communications solutions and tools enable the project/
product virtual team to improve efficiencies and reduce the cycle time, espe­
cially because they have easy access to subject matter experts in real-time, 
no matter where they are located or in which time zone, with online pres­
ence. These same capabilities can be leveraged with virtual teams made up of 
the internal company resources as well as partner and customer resources, 
and reduce the cycle time for projects or products, while improving the qual­
ity of their communications and collaboration — typically at a lower cost!
Many organizations deploying unified communications solutions integrate 
their telephony infrastructure with the new instant messaging and confer­
encing solutions. These investments significantly improve employee com­
munications because employees can choose how they want to connect and 
communicate with colleagues: 
	
✓	Instant Message
	
✓	Click-to-call
	
✓	Audio-, Web-, or videoconferencing
Internal communications
A hospital in California was looking for a solu­
tion to improve its capability to communicate 
and collaborate more efficiently, especially 
in the radiology department. The radiology 
department recently had expanded to include 
radiologists from India and Australia to provide 
round-the-clock coverage. When patients were 
x-rayed in California, their x-rays were loaded 
in a Kodak system that allowed authorized col­
leagues access to them over the Internet. So a 
patient’s x-rays taken at 5 p.m. in California by 
the technician and then loaded on the Kodak 
system were available to the radiologist in India 
or Australia after the California radiologist went 
home. Now the radiologist in India or Australia 
could analyze the x-rays and enter the diagno­
sis into the system. In the morning, when the 
California radiologist and technicians returned 
to work, those x-rays were viewed and the 
diagnosis was entered. 
If the radiologist or the physician in California 
had questions or wanted to consult with the 
radiologist in India or Australia, or with an 
expert, he or she could participate in a Web 
conference (Microsoft Office Live Meeting or 
Cisco WebEx, for example), open and view the 
x-rays online, consult with the other partici­
pants, annotate a specific area on the charts 
by using annotation tools, and reach a well-
informed conclusion. Just for an example, 
4–6 p.m. in California would mean 9–11 a.m. in 
Australia (next day) and 5:30–7:30 a.m. in India 
(next day). Unified communication is a brilliant 
innovation that improves efficiency in commu­
nications and collaboration. 

31
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Business Benefits
It is possible with some of the unified communications solutions available 
today that some participants will use their computers and Voice over IP 
(VoIP) for audio in a Web-conference, while others may connect using a tra­
ditional phone for the audio part of the conversation or even connect from 
their car, train, or at the airport to just listen in on an audio conversation. 
The VoIP-based Web-conference has been extended to dial-in conferencing, 
thus opening it to everyone, no matter how the connection is made. These 
new dial-in capabilities have created efficiencies for both the presenter and 
participants regardless of where they are and what modalities they have 
available to connect and communicate.
Using your computer with the Instant Messaging client and tying voice and 
video calls into it garners you many benefits, such as simple one-click calling: 
There’s no need to look in the address book, no need to dial a number.
Increased Productivity
Many organizations today have over half of their staff working remotely 
at home, in a branch office, or on the road. They carry their laptops, 
BlackBerries, or Windows Mobile–based smartphones with them wherever 
they go. Most popular unified communications solutions from Cisco and 
Microsoft allow them to receive calls made to their office number from any 
workspace: main office, branch office, home, or hotel. They can listen to their 
office voicemail messages from their Microsoft Exchange 2007 Inbox on their 
computer or from an IP phone, traditional phone, or mobile phone.
	
✓	These road warriors also utilize the capability to call into their e-mail 
mailbox (known as Outlook Voice Access provided in Microsoft’s 
Exchange 2007 server Unified Messaging) using any kind of phone from 
anywhere to listen to their e-mail messages and voicemails, and manage 
their calendars. They remain productive no matter where they are: 
 
• In the car with their Bluetooth hands-free headset
 
• At the airport waiting at the gate
 
• In their hotel room
	
✓	Managing your calendar using Outlook Voice Access allows you to inform 
colleagues, customers, and partners via e-mail if, for instance, you are 
stuck in traffic and will be late for your meeting — all via any phone. 
	
	This is particularly helpful — if someone is waiting for you in a confer­
ence room or on a Web-conference.
Microsoft Outlook is the e-mail client of choice for many organizations. Most 
unified communications vendors, such as IBM, Cisco, and Microsoft, integrate 
their solutions with Outlook so users can schedule audio and Web-conferences 
using their Outlook calendar and send invitations to other individuals using 

32
Part I: Getting Started 
Outlook. The invitees receive their invitations in their Outlook mailboxes and 
single-click to accept or decline the invitation. The invitation information gets 
added to the calendars, and invitees get a standard Outlook reminder 15 min­
utes before the meeting.
	
The unified communications solution is so tightly integrated with the user’s 
desktop experience that it adds another way to improve productivity.
	
✓	A hospital in California was trying to find a better way to provide con­
tinuing education (called Grand Rounds) for its physicians, nurses, and 
other hospital staff — a requirement mandated by the state and medical 
board. Traditionally, everyone gathered in the cafeteria and a guest lec­
turer came from other hospitals in the area or flew in from out of town. 
Attendance suffered because many people had to drive 30 to 60 min­
utes or fly in to participate. They found Microsoft Office Live Meeting 
solution hosted Web-conferencing enabled everyone to either attend 
in person or participate from their offices over the Internet. The guest 
presenters could either present on location or remotely, right from their 
offices. Microsoft Office Live Meeting also allowed them to record each 
meeting for anyone to watch later. Translation: Increased productivity 
and attendance, and lower meeting costs.
	
✓	Newer unified communications solutions, as shown in Figure 3-2, allow 
managers to delegate their calls to their executive assistants or create a 
team-call group where multiple people’s phones ring when a call comes in 
and anyone can answer the call. The first person who answers the call can 
 
• Transfer it to a subject matter expert if required.
 
• Create a multi-party conference and look at an issue with col­
leagues, customers, or partners. 
	
	The call gets answered on the first ring and the issue gets resolved 
immediately.

33
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Business Benefits
	
✓	If you were looking for someone at the office whose door is closed or 
who is in a meeting in a conference room, you may frequently walk by 
that person’s office or the conference room so you would know when he 
or she is free to meet with you. 
	
	Unified communication solutions change how you make that discovery. 
With unified communications, you can see the individual’s presence 
state from your computer:
 
• In a meeting
 
• Busy
 
• Do Not Disturb 
	
	No need to walk around the office or conference room — all you have to 
do is Tag that person (electronically). The computer will tell you when 
he or she is online and available by sending you an alert-called “toast 
pop-up” because it is displayed on the bottom right pane of your com­
puter. The presence state turns green. Now you can send an IM.
Improved Customer/Partner Satisfaction
Unified communications solutions support “Federation” or “Public IM 
Connectivity” features so that organizations can directly connect with their 
key customers and partners.
	
✓	Federation: Organizations that need to communicate with each other 
implement the same unified communications solution and agree to 
exchange secure IM and audio/video communications.
	
✓	PIC: An organization extends its unified communications solution to allow 
connection to public IM providers such as Windows Live Messenger, 
Yahoo!, or AOL Instant Messenger. (Additional licensing may be required.)
If an organization has implemented Federation or PIC, employees can easily 
see their customers’ and partners’ real-time presence and vice versa. They 
can be in direct contact with each other and can collaborate and communi­
cate faster with a single click of the mouse. Customers’ and partners’ capa­
bility to see the online presence of employees they are doing business with 
creates a great sense of trust and satisfaction and reduces cycle time for 
projects, products, and contracts.
Following are other ways to improve customer and partner satisfaction:
	
✓	Organizations can use the unified communications solutions, especially 
audio, video, and Web-conferencing, to deliver sales and marketing pre­
sentations to customers and partners. Unified communication can also 
be used in customer support scenarios and project/product collabora­
tion with customers and partners.

34
Part I: Getting Started 
	
✓	Organizations can respond with speed to customer/partner questions 
and use real-time presence to find subject matter experts who can 
answer those queries quickly and easily. These advantages can increase 
the number of customers/partners served exponentially and result in 
dramatic satisfaction improvements. 
	
✓	Enhanced communication between customers/partners and sales teams, 
in which sales staff have real-time access to subject matter experts 
through presence awareness, call forwarding, and other tools, means 
faster response to customer/partner requests for proposals (RFPs), 
requests for information (RFI). In turn, sales staff can respond to more 
such requests in less time than ever before. 
	
✓	The voice functions, such as Response Groups, provide a method for an 
external call to be routed to anyone in a team, help desk, or customer 
service, and can be used for teams that are supposed to be available 24 
hours a day. These teams have a person designated to be on-call so that 
the help desk staff can reach a resource to solve an issue. 
Consolidated network architecture
Organizations can immediately garner real cost-savings by phasing in vari­
ous components of the unified communications solutions one at a time, if 
desired. 
	
I cover more about planning and implementations in Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7. 
The basic principle with any of today’s unified communications solutions 
is the capability to consolidate and unify various forms of communications 
devices and modes so a user experiences a seamless environment with a 
single desktop client. This integration and consolidation obviously results in 
cost savings from administration, management, and monitoring activities. It 
also eliminates the need and cost for different hardware and software solu­
tions maintenance contracts.
In some cases, even the software licensing costs can be reduced by convert­
ing to a comprehensive or bundled licensing package.
	
✓	Is the communications system your enterprise uses today, such as PBX 
(Public Branch Exchange), located in each of your sites with its own 
voicemail system? Do you have some sort of interactive voice response 
system (IVR) also attached to the old PBX in some sites? It is possible 
that some of these systems are outdated and in dire need of a face-lift.
	
	If you were looking at or evaluating some sort of unified communications 
solution anyway, here is your opportunity to consolidate your systems 
centrally to the headquarters (or at least fewer locations) while using 
VoIP over your existing wide-area network (WAN) to support other 
locations.

35
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Business Benefits
	
✓	Most unified communications solutions from major vendors like Cisco 
and Microsoft offer an opportunity for voice communication system 
consolidation.
	
	If voicemail systems are tied to your PBX today, you may be interested 
in what unified communications vendors call “Unified Messaging” — 
the capability to consolidate voicemail into e-mail systems. Unified 
Messaging eliminates the need for separate hardware and software, and 
all voicemail and faxes go directly into the user’s mailbox.
	
✓	Consolidation of your site/divisional servers is now possible with 
the use of 64-bit and virtual server architecture where appropriate. 
Centralized consolidation will eliminate costs of equipment and support 
at remote sites.
Here are other advantages of hardware/software consolidation:
	
✓	If various sites/locations in your organization have their own locally 
managed storage or archiving systems, they can be consolidated into 
fewer locations or centralized at the headquarters. 
	
	Does your organization have distributed e-mail, voicemail, and other 
systems at each site/location? Consolidate them to the headquarters or 
fewer locations for significant savings in 
 
• Administration
 
• Management
 
• Monitoring 
	
✓	Implementation of a unified communications solution that is integrated 
with your voice system’s PBX will yield significant savings from the con­
solidation and reduction in administrative and maintenance costs. If you 
were planning to upgrade your traditional PBX to an IP-PBX, the unified 
communications solutions integration with that traditional PBX may 
extend the life of that PBX without incurring the costs of ripping and 
replacing the entire PBX. 
Reduced costs
Recently, I attended the “virtual” launch of a brand new product; thousands 
of people from around the world were expected. The manufacturer wanted 
to demonstrate the true business value of unified communications — thus, 
a virtual launch. Customers and partners could participate remotely from 
the comfort of their home or office over the Internet. After registration, each 
attendee was sent a unique link to join.

36
Part I: Getting Started 
Partners were invited to become sponsors and have a virtual booth where 
they could create their own keynote presentations and offer their literature 
for downloads. Product demonstrations could be delivered live or stored as 
videos for attendee viewing.
The unified communications vendor had its own keynote presentations and 
demos delivered live to the audience, plus marketing and technical materi­
als available for downloads. The vendor even offered attendees a virtual 
briefcase in which to add all the documents that they wanted to download by 
visiting different booths virtually. They could download all the documents all 
at one time.
	
Use this link to try attending this event yourself. Click on Enter to join without 
registering or register and then sign in to download the docs in your briefcase:

This type of a virtual show can save many people thousands of dollars, time, 
and effort it would require to attend a live convention/launch of a product.
	
Bravo to the person or team that came up with this vision and executed it 
flawlessly. What it means is that customers or partners who missed an actual 
virtual event on the day it was scheduled can still participate later by viewing 
the event in recorded format at their convenience.
Technology companies have become more innovative today to help their cus­
tomers and partners reduce costs while improving efficiency and productivity:
	
✓	Let’s assume that your organization has traditional PBX with voice­
mail that needs to be replaced and the cost ranges from $500 to $1,000 
per user for IP phones on each desk and backend IP-PBX replacement 
(including hardware, software, maintenance costs, and so forth). As I 
discuss earlier in this chapter, it’s possible to integrate your traditional 
PBX with the unified communications solution (described in detail in 
Chapter 4) and use your WAN for voice communications, thus extend­
ing the life of the existing PBX. A unified communications solution with 
integration to your traditional PBX may cut costs in half. Assuming the 
above numbers, if you have 1,000 employees, you may yield savings 
between $250,000 and $500,000.
	
✓	Obviously, you need to look at those expensive maintenance contracts 
with PBX and voicemail systems that may cost you $50 to $100 per user 
or mailbox. Also look at the administration, management, and monitor­
ing costs, ranging from $50,000 to $100,000 annually. It may be an oppor­
tunity to decommission them one location at a time with the unified 
communications solution implementation. 

37
 Chapter 3: Understanding the Business Benefits
	
	Look at case studies for unified communications costs savings from 
organizations in your industry at unified communications vendors’ Web 
sites. You’ll likely be pleasantly surprised to discover that many organi­
zations have already done what you are thinking of doing.
	
✓	Will your organization enable telecommuting for your employees now 
that you are implementing unified communications solution in the 
workplace? With the unified communications solution in place, you can 
provide a remote working environment for employees. With the unified 
communications tools at their disposal, employees can easily collabo­
rate and communicate with their colleagues and customers/partners 
regardless of where they are — in the office, on the road, or working 
from home. Telecommuting saves costs for the employees and the 
corporation by using the same office space for many employees, called 
“Progressive Office.”
	
✓	Employees can reduce travel expenses by using Web-conferencing and 
reduce long-distance phone charges by using VoIP. For example, imagine 
a company with 1,000 employees. Say that 25 percent of the employees 
travel for business each year — five trips per year at an average cost 
of $1,000 per trip. Assuming that those employees eliminate one or 
two trips per year by using the Web-conferencing tools available with 
any unified communications solution, the resulting savings is $1,000 to 
$2,000 per employee. Multiply that amount by 250 (25 percent of 1,000), 
and the aggregate savings is $250,000 to $500,000.

Today’s marketplace includes several business or personal solutions like 
Skype that can be advantageous to small and medium sized businesses. Many 
major vendors offer similar solutions called Software as a Service (SAS) to 
provide businesses unified communications tools over the Internet as a sub­
scription service. You don’t have to install, manage, and monitor your own 
hardware and technology. You may even pay as you go or sign minimal con­
tracts. Check them out.
Organizations can make their individual users and teams more productive 
by enabling them for unified communications. Unified communications 
makes it easier to contact colleagues for information, check for messages, 
and stay connected and productive even while out of the office. Unified 
communications-enabled employees and teams inside the organization 
become more productive in their interactions with customers and partners, 
too. Improving individual productivity and organizational efficiency that 
reduce costs is a winning formula for any organization, especially in today’s 
economy.

ou discover the ins and outs of planning a shiny new 
system that rings your phone and tweets your text.
Yes, some technical information is included in these chap­
ters. Fear not! I bring you tidings of great joy! Lo, a unified 
communications system is at hand, and you — yea, even 
you — can design it yourself.

Planning Your Deployment
In This Chapter
▶	Assessing your existing communications
▶	Evaluating unified communications components
▶	Justifying the business case
A
good plan can mean the difference between the success and failure for 
any project. This chapter focuses on planning your deployment and 
sharing how a well-thought-out plan created with a great project team will 
lead to successful implementation.
For your unified communications deployment to succeed, you will need to 
make a true assessment of your existing communications environment, and 
then evaluate which unified communications components are critical to your 
business.
My step-by-step instructions lead you through the planning process and 
assist you in making the right choices for successful implementation of a uni­
fied communications solution.
A unified communications project should be looked at as an ongoing process 
that you implement over time, introducing one or more components at a 
time. This implementation process allows your users and administrators time 
to learn and use it effectively. I estimate that it may take you 3 to 6 months to 
complete all phases of your deployment if yours is a small to medium busi­
ness, and a year or more if it’s a large organization. So before jumping in with 
both feet, make sure that you have a well-balanced team that will approach 
the unified communications solution carefully and thoroughly. 

42
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Surveying the Landscape
If done right, the unified communications solution will enable your employ­
ees to become productive without completely replacing everything in your 
existing communications infrastructure. But to get those bottom-line results, 
you will need to:
	
✓	Assess your company’s business and technical requirements in light of 
the unified communications solutions that are available and the features 
they provide.
	
✓	Look at your existing telephone system, e-mail and voicemail, and your 
local area networks (LAN) and wide area network (WAN). Compare them 
against your business and technical requirements to assess where the 
gaps are. After you identify where the gaps are, you can evaluate unified 
communications solutions in the marketplace and decide which comes 
closest to meeting your business and technical requirements while 
allowing you to keep at least part of your existing infrastructure. 
	
	Even if your existing telephone system has some miles left in it, it’s 
possible that it is still really time to retire the old system. Consult with 
your unified communications vendor to make sure that the new phone 
system you are considering is compatible with their unified communica­
tions solution.
Regardless of the size of your enterprise, a unified communications solution 
will immediately start delivering benefits and improve employee productivity. 
Proper planning and lots of testing along the way, including a small pilot pro­
gram before full implementation, are keys to success.
You aren’t the only one thinking about unified communications; many enter­
prises have launched their unified communications journey or are in the middle 
of planning and implementing. As a matter of fact, Forrester Research cites a 21 
percent increase in unified communications pilot programs since 2007.
Many organizations thinking of implementing a unified communications 
solution may already have some components in their infrastructure that can 
be leveraged. Also, if you bought licenses for an older version of a vendor’s 
unified communications solution and also purchased insurance that entitles 
you to free upgrades for 3 years, then you have a compelling reason to move 
forward. Perhaps your organization is considering upgrading only your e-mail 
and voicemail system, or your telephone system. You can leverage your 

43
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
current and future investments by adding unified communications compo­
nents that make sense for your business and take advantage of the savings 
and productivity improvements. 
	
To exploit the software- and hardware-powered unified communications solu­
tions, look at it as a journey: Divide your plan into phases (discussed later in 
this chapter). Each phase may be implementation of some unified communica­
tions component, such as 
	
✓	Instant messaging and presence
	
✓	Conferencing
	
✓	Integration of the telephony system with unified communications 
Each phase will deliver benefits to your organization while your users 
become acquainted with the new technology. Your users will find new ways 
to engage with their colleagues and customers and partners (if enabled). In 
this global economy, everyone needs a competitive edge. A unified communi­
cations solution may be the perfect edge.
Each component of the unified communications solution will deliver its own 
set of benefits. You will see clear value in planning out each phase of the pro­
cess with careful thought and team consensus:
	
✓	It may take time to get the plan in place and get your infrastructure 
ready for the unified communications solution implementation. It is criti­
cal to plan for each unified communications component, and then let the 
users adopt and experience it for a time before implementing the next 
component. 
	
✓	Invest time in evaluating the software choices available in the market­
place and weigh different options against your business and technical 
requirements as well as the cost before selecting the solution. Most uni­
fied communications vendors provide professional services that include 
evaluation, planning, design, implementation, and testing the solution. 
They may also recommend their trusted local partners. Ultimately, it 
all means a great competitive advantage for your organization if you 
become the successful early adopter.
Consider the unified communications solutions to allow your organization 
to innovate and adopt new ways to manage your business — for example, 
how your sales team delivers contracts and proposals to the customers or 
how customer service works with the customers and partners to ensure that 
every call is answered and questions are resolved the first time.

44
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Unified communications will involve a paradigm shift in how your individual 
users, teams, and your enterprise perform and require the cultural changes. 
To be successful, it’s critical to involve:
	
✓	People from your IT department in the project team and the pilot team
	
✓	Key decision-makers and users from your various businesses or busi­
ness functions so their business requirements are considered during the 
evaluation phase and eventual implementation
Because unified communications provides the capability to integrate your 
existing telephony and voicemail system, you should consider involving your 
telephony/PBX folks in the pilot and project team. 
The overall plan for unified communications deployment should include 
some sort of user adoption training or activities, such as brown bag lunch 
sessions, to make everyone understand how to use the new unified commu­
nications tools and to whom to turn for assistance. You may even consider 
some sort of incentives, and then start measuring the success of your unified 
communications solution by monitoring metrics that the unified communica­
tions solution allows you to gather.
	
In most organizations, some people immediately embrace new technology 
and start reaping the benefits. They also become the departmental wiz, the 
“champ” in that technology, to whom everyone else turns for help. You need 
such people on your “user adoption” and training team. You need to train 
them first (“train the trainers”). Once trained, they will become your internal 
champions for leading their departments, divisions, or business units to suc­
cess in adopting the new unified communications tools. You may even create 
some sort of internal contest or competition amongst these champions so that 
more users adopt the new tools and start on the road to success for the uni­
fied communications solution. The only way to actually gain the true benefits 
of unified communications is user adoption. The faster it happens, the sooner 
you will be counting the dollars and time you are saving for your organization.
Assessing Your Existing Communications
It’s important to assess your organization’s existing communication systems 
and network infrastructure.
Directory
Does your organization have a single enterprise directory that everything 
else integrates with, or do you have separate disparate databases for each 
component in your enterprise?

45
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Many enterprises have consolidated their directory structure into a single, 
comprehensive enterprise directory structure, commonly known as the 
Active Directory from Microsoft or a LDAP standard-based directory. 
	
If you are using a single enterprise-wide directory that everything integrates 
to, you are already ahead of the game compared to others.
E-mail
What e-mail system does your enterprise have? Most common are Microsoft 
Exchange Server 2003 or 2007, Lotus Notes, and some form of hosted e-mail 
system like Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo!.
If your enterprise is using either Microsoft Exchange Server or Lotus Notes, 
you are already integrated with an enterprise directory of some sort — 
maybe even Windows Active Directory.
PBX/PSTN system
Many enterprises have legacy PBX systems that aren’t yet IP- (Internet 
Protocol) based. Other enterprises may have begun converting their PBX to 
an IP-based PBX from, for example, Cisco, Avaya, or Nortel. If your enterprise 
has the latest IP-based PBX, you are on your way to leveraging that invest­
ment and achieving the unification of your IP telephony with other communi­
cations tools.
It is critical to know whether your current PBX system is a traditional TDM-
based or latest IP-based: 
	
✓	Does it extend to national and international connections? 
	
✓	How are your remote sites connected to the PSTN network? 
 
• Do they have their own PBX and voicemail systems?
 
• Are they using the centrally managed system at the headquarters? 
	
✓	How is each PBX system is managed?
	
✓	What are the cost elements?
	
Following are descriptions of some terms/acronyms used in this chapter and 
elsewhere in the book:
	
✓	PBX: A Private Branch Exchange connects all internal phones centrally 
so the users only need to dial a 4- or 5-digit extension number to reach a 
colleague. 

46
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
✓	PSTN: A PBX connects to the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone 
Network) to enable internal users to reach external entities by making 
local, national, or international calls by dialing a number with 7 or 10+ 
digits.
	
✓	TDM: PSTN networks use circuit-switching to transmit multiple calls on 
the same line. 
	
	Time division multiplexing (TDM) divides each call into multiple parts 
(frames) and transmits each part one at a time in a time-slot at a higher 
bandwidth.
Prepare an inventory of each site, noting how many users and what type of 
PBX/telephony infrastructure each site has. Each site could have its own 
small- to medium-sized PBX, including its own voicemail system, database 
directory, administration, and so forth.
How are calls being routed from your PBX to the outside world? What type of 
dialing plans have you subscribed to for national and international dialing? If 
you have multiple sites and users, consider a corporate policy regarding who 
at each site is allowed to call local, national, and international numbers. It will 
save your enterprise a lot of money once you figure out and implement some 
policies in the unified communications solution that you are implementing:
	
✓	Is the phone on each desk a legacy phone, or has it been upgraded to an 
IP-based phone? 
	
✓	Do you have standard phones in conference rooms, or are they confer­
ence phones — like Polycom or Cisco? 
	
✓	Do you have videoconferencing in the conference rooms? Is this technol­
ogy either 
 
• A point-to-point connection? 
 
• A multi-point connection?
Voicemail
Is it a voice-mail system provided by your PBX vendor such as Avaya, Nortel, 
or Siemens, or is it integrated with your e-mail system? The most common 
scenario will be that your PBX vendor has provided some sort of voice-mail 
system that requires you to dial your phone to retrieve your voicemails and 
manage them, such as 
	
✓	Archive
	
✓	Delete
	
✓	Forward

47
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
A few PBX vendors that provide voice mail have already integrated it with 
Microsoft Office Outlook so that the voice mails actually show up in your 
e-mail inbox with an .avi file attachment that you can play on your computer.
Also, most PBX vendors that provide voice-mail systems provide an indicator 
on your phone that you have new voice mail waiting — the blinking red light 
that many of us have become addicted to and can’t live without. 
Instant messaging and presence
Does your enterprise currently have some sort of enterprise IM implemented 
with presence? Is it internally managed or hosted by providers such as 
Windows Live Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger, or AOL Instant Messenger?
Enterprises that have Lotus Notes for their e-mail system may have Lotus 
Sametime as their IM system.
Conferencing
Does your company use audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing? Most 
enterprises today have some sort of audio conference bridge provided by 
telephony providers such as AT&T or Verizon. A few may have internally 
managed systems, like Latitude, MeetingPlace, and InterCall, that provide 
internal management and maybe even integrate it with the Microsoft Outlook 
calendar. Does either of these scenarios describe your organization’s setup?
Many companies have hosted Web-conferencing from WebEx (Cisco), 
Microsoft Live Meeting, or Citrix GoToMeeting, which requires annual con­
tracts, a fixed fee per month, plus additional fees for exceeding fixed minutes, 
much like cell phone contracts.
Voice
If your enterprise has implemented VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)-based 
communications, you are already partway into your unified communications 
journey.
Look at your current telephony environment and figure out what you have, 
how many sites, and how many users at each site. During this planning cycle, 
you need to evaluate where you are, what you want to accomplish in the new 
environment, and how you want to achieve it. Here is your chance to rethink 

48
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
your enterprise strategy about communications and who can do what. To 
reduce costs when you implement the unified communications solutions, you 
may consider allowing only certain users to call long-distance and interna­
tional. Most new unified communications solutions will allow you to define 
policies that group employees into those who call:
	
✓	Only local area codes
	
✓	Local and national
	
✓	Local, national, and international
Enterprise LAN and WAN
If your organization is a single-site, small organization, chances are that you 
have a local area network (LAN) that connects to the Internet via services 
provided by your Internet Service provider (ISP). Your existing LAN allows 
all the desktop computers as well as the servers in the back closet/room to 
connect into the local network and share components like printers and other 
peripherals. Using a broadband router, your LAN connects to the Internet via 
the ISP. Having a LAN is sufficient for you to consider adding some of the uni­
fied communications components to your environment. When I discuss the 
impact of the unified communications solution on your network, you will see 
whether you need to add any additional components to beef up your LAN or 
the Internet connection to get improvements in employee productivity and 
enterprise efficiency.
If your organization has multiple sites (national or international), then you 
probably have a LAN in each site that connects to a Wide Area Network 
(WAN). The WAN allows each local site to communicate and collaborate with 
other sites so your employees can connect with each other. To implement a 
new unified communications solution, it will be critical for you to gather the 
following information about your LAN and WAN:
	
✓	How many sites are there, and how many users are at each site?
	
✓	Are servers implemented in any of the sites?
	
✓	Are IT administrators located at any of the sites?
	
✓	Are there different e-mail systems, or any sites that are already using 
some unified communications components? 
	
	It is possible that one or more sites may have a contract for hosted Web-
conferencing or audio conference bridge, for example.
	
✓	Does each site have a separate telephone system (PBX), voice-mail 
system, directory, and/or administration?

49
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Evaluating Unified Communications 
Components
In the initial planning phase, several key decision factors will affect how you 
choose to deploy the unified communications solution in your organization. 
Evaluate your organization’s particular business and technical requirements, 
and decide what features of unified communications you want to enable. 
Most unified communications solutions vendors have created components 
that can be implemented in phases. For example, you can gain benefits of 
instant messaging and presence without implementing enterprise VoIP. 
Instant messaging and presence should be the first unified communications 
component you implement.
Determine what features 
you want to deploy
All unified communications solutions provide you with ways to unify and 
simplify instant messaging, presence, and conferencing: audio-, video- and 
Web-conferencing for users within your internal organization. Some unified 
communications solutions also will allow you to extend your unified commu­
nications solution to communicate with external users: 
	
✓	Customers
	
✓	Partners 
	
✓	Vendors/suppliers
	
These are known respectively as “Federation” and “Public IM Connectivity”; 
they’re covered in Chapter 2.
You may want or need to archive your instant messages and audio/video 
communications for compliance or security reasons. The unified communica­
tions solution may provide archiving functionality out of the box, or you may 
have to look at third-party solutions that integrate with the solution that you 
have selected.
We have consolidated some key features of unified communications in Table 
4-1 that you can use as a reference and compare it with features that your orga­
nization needs. For example, if your business depends on your capability to 

50
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
communicate with your customers, partners, and vendors/suppliers instantly, 
then instant external communication is a critical business requirement.

 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Evaluate your organization’s specific needs
Before you begin any deployments, you must consider the specific needs 
your business may have. They are different for each organization:
	
✓	Importance of high availability — 24/7 — of your unified communica­
tions solution. Can your business survive any downtime?
	
	If high availability is business critical, then you also should look at disas­
ter recovery. What happens if there is a natural disaster in your area and 
your data-center/computer room is impacted?
	
✓	Geographic distribution of your organization
	
	Do employees need access to the solution remotely — while on the 
road, in a hotel, or at home?
	
✓	Do you have any specific service level agreements?
	
✓	Do you want to support external user access: customers, partners, and 
suppliers/vendors?
	
✓	Do federal, state, and/or local regulations require you to comply by 
archiving your communications?
	
✓	Does your business need Enterprise Voice (VoIP)?
Importance of high availability 
and disaster recovery
Some businesses cannot sustain any downtime from their unified communi­
cations solution: 24/7 availability is business critical for them. If you are in 
that category, make sure the unified communications solution you are evalu­
ating will provide it. In general, high availability requires additional hard­
ware/software. That means your cost will increase, but you can be assured 
that you will not experience any downtime. If your business can sustain itself 
with minimal downtime, say, a few hours to a day, and simplicity and econ­
omy are more important, then a single server may be an appropriate choice. 
Let’s define some terms first:
	
✓	High availability: 100 percent availability of the unified communications 
solution; no downtime
	
✓	Disaster recovery: Processes and procedures implemented to recover 
from a natural disaster

52
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
✓	SLA: IT department may contract with the rest of the business in a com­
pany to provide certain levels of service, such as 
 
• Responding within 4 to 8 hours for any trouble-ticket created by 
users
 
• 99.99 percent uptime for business critical systems
Geographic distribution
The geographic distribution of your company will affect the implementation 
of the unified communications components and how you do it. For example, 
if you have strong wide area network (WAN) links between your sites, assess 
how much is used on a regular basis and how much is truly available. 
	
Adding the unified communications components will add a new load on your 
local area network (LAN) as well on the WAN. Let’s say that your WAN is 
already very much overloaded and putting new load on it could bring it to its 
knees. In this case:
	
✓	Consider placing unified communications servers locally in each one of 
your sites or at least those sites that are low on WAN bandwidth. Especially, 
the addition of audio and video features will require greater bandwidth, and 
your users will have a better experience with a local server.
	
✓	Consider who absolutely needs or should have audio, video, and Web-
conferencing capabilities, and avoid enabling everyone for it.
Number of users in each location
It is critical for your design and deployment team to know the number of 
users in each location today as well as the planned growth to determine if 
your unified communications deployment should include local servers in 
each site or centralize them.
Consider local servers on site if
	
✓	You have more than 200 users in a remote site that is expected to grow 
and you want to put a media gateway that connects to the PSTN or SIP 
trunking so you can reduce long-distance toll charges as well as band­
width usage on your WAN. 
	
✓	Your users in that local site have high availability requirements for 
enterprise voice.
	
✓	You plan to support external participants’ access to Web conferences and 
audio/videoconferences and you expect a high amount of usage in this site.

53
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Support for remote access 
and external user access
Most organizations have employees and managers who will need access to 
the unified communications tools remotely:
	
✓	On the road
	
✓	In hotels
	
✓	From home
Many organizations allow their employees to telecommute these days, and 
so enabling remote access may be a requirement for your organization. If 
you choose to enable your employees to access the unified communications 
solutions from anywhere or enable external user access — say, for custom­
ers and partners — then you will need to plan for a proxy/edge server in your 
perimeter network topology.
	
The terms that follow are defined broadly:
	
✓	Remote Access: Capability of users to access unified communications 
systems when they aren’t connected directly to company’s network — 
on the road, in a hotel, or from home
	
✓	External Access: Employees can connect with customers and partners 
for same level of presence and instant messaging access if they use 
same vendor’s unified communications solution or have public IM: 
Yahoo!, AOL, or Windows Live Messenger solutions 
	
✓	Perimeter Network: Company’s internal servers are separated from 
external servers using firewalls
Support for enterprise voice
You can integrate your PBX/PSTN system with enterprise voice so your users 
can use communicator to single-click call anyone from their contact list. This 
call will travel from the user’s computer over your WAN (Voice over Internet 
Protocol) and hand off to the local, national, or international telco network 
to complete the call. If you plan to do that, you must consider the need for a 
media gateway device that enables connection between the unified communi­
cations solution and your PBX/PSTN network. 
Each unified communications solution will offer different choices and topolo­
gies to deploy the enterprise voice in your unique environment.

54
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
Media gateways are devices that provide translation of traditional telephone 
conversations into SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) that the unified communi­
cations system understands.
Scalability
Any solution that you implement that requires hardware and software 
will need to grow when the number of users increases or the actual usage 
increases. For example, let’s say that in the case of the unified communica­
tions solution that we are speaking of, the company hires hundreds of new 
employees and needs the unified communications solution to grow or scale. 
The need to grow or scale is a requirement because the company added sub­
stantial new load with the new employees all using IM; presence; audio-, Web- 
and videoconferencing; and so forth. The unified communications solution 
typically should be able to grow or scale by adding hardware.
A unified communications solution is considered scalable if the performance 
and its ability to sustain additional load (through usage or new users) 
improves proportionally to additional hardware. 
	
✓	Scale vertically (scale up) means adding additional processors and 
memory to an existing server in the topology.
	
✓	Scale horizontally (scale out) means adding more servers to the topolo­
gies, such as adding a server to an existing pool in the unified communi­
cations solution without shutting down the system.
For the sake of the unified communications solution topologies I am discuss­
ing, horizontal scaling should support additional load on the unified com­
munications system by adding servers in a pool. Horizontal scaling doesn’t 
require shutting down the unified communications server to add additional 
processors or memory. All that’s being done is installing and configuring an 
additional server to the pool of servers already configured for the unified 
communications solution.
Network bandwidth requirements
The audio-, Web- and videoconferencing functionality of the unified com­
munications solution will be a bigger consumer of your network’s bandwidth 
and will add load that you will need to be very careful about. If your business 
requires all or some employees to be enabled for the conferencing functions 

55
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
and some of them start using high-quality devices like VGA or HD Webcams, 
then be prepared to add additional bandwidth on your LAN or WAN as 
required. Plan for 
	
✓	Expansion in the number of users in your company at various sites
	
✓	Increased usage as the users become more familiar with the unified 
communications tools
	
Graphics terms are defined below:
	
✓	VGA: Video Graphics Array resolution, typically 640 x 480 pixels
	
✓	HD: High-definition resolution output
Survivability
We spoke of high-availability earlier, where an organization needs the system 
to be available 24/7 and it cannot sustain if the unified communications 
system crashes for any reason.
Survivability means that the unified communications solution must remain 
live or available in case of a natural disaster such as earthquake, tornado, or 
flood. It’s also known as Disaster Recovery.
Many organizations call it business continuity planning (BCP) or have disas­
ter recovery as a component of their overall BCP. Most organizations define a 
BCP site where business may continue if their main site is down because of a 
natural disaster. 
New unified communications 
features to consider
Vendors of unified communications solutions always introduce new features 
that enable capabilities you have been used to in your legacy environment 
but that required a hardware/software combination. Now those features are 
delivered through software innovation. Can your business benefit from them?
Call delegation
In the old days, most managers had their administrative assistants to answer 
the phone for them, find out who is calling, and ask if the manager wanted to 
take the call. Administrative assistants acted as the screeners and managed 

56
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
the phone console for multiple bosses. Many managers liked that concept 
and felt that it allowed them to be more efficient. So the unified communica­
tions vendors, listening to their customers’ suggestions, have now imple­
mented it.
Managers can delegate phone call handling to one or more administrative 
assistants or other delegates of their team. When a delegate answers a call, 
the manager is notified that the call has been answered, along with the name 
of the delegate who answered. Delegates can transfer the call to the manager 
by speaking to her first or directly, and maybe even transfer the call to the 
right person in the department based on the context of the call. It allows 
everyone to work more efficiently and productively, and the customer/part­
ner who is calling gets to speak to the right person the first time rather than 
going to voicemail. Managers get their work done more efficiently, and the 
administrative assistants can assist in managing multiple managers’ calen­
dars and schedules. 
	
If your organization doesn’t have administrative assistants anymore (many 
organizations today don’t), managers can certainly transfer their calls to a 
team member or multiple people who report to them.
Team Calling
Similar to Call Delegation, a team leader of help-desk team or customer ser­
vice team can select an entire team to answer the incoming call. As a result, 
when a team receives a forwarded call, each member’s phone rings, and all 
members can see who forwarded the call. When a team member answers the 
call, the phones of all other members stop ringing. Once again, the premise is 
that the call gets answered and the person answering can forward to a sub­
ject matter expert based on the context and whoever is calling gets someone 
on the first try and gets an answer to their question/issue right away. This 
feature can be used in many different contexts but the ultimate goal is to get 
calls answered the first time rather than ending up in voicemail and the call­
ers get satisfaction that work is progressing.
Group Chat
Chat enables users to engage in persistent, ongoing IM conversations. In 
Group Chat, the conversation persists, along with all IM conversations, files, 
Web links, and other associated data. This persistence makes it possible to 
maintain complete records of each session.
	
You can compare it to the concept of chat rooms where you can virtually 
enter at any time, if permitted, and still see all the information that has been 
exchanged so far. Even if you leave, the information remains intact. 
You also can invite customers or partners to participate if enabled through 
“Federation.” Imagine maintaining a continuing flow of information among 
project or product team members, both internal and external.

57
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Making the Business Case
A high-tech company deployed instant messaging, presence, and conferenc­
ing to over 80,000 employees distributed throughout the world. The company 
expects that the first phase of the deployment will yield over 20 percent just 
by cutting its external audio conferencing expenses. 
In a harsh economic environment, everyone looks for a leg up on the 
competition while seeking to cut costs and optimize resource usage while 
improving employee productivity and enterprise efficiency. This section 
highlights and provides details on how your enterprise can justify the 
investment in unified communications to gain that competitive advantage 
while reducing costs.
Specifically, I dive into a few areas of cost savings that you can immediately 
apply to your business and come up with direct and indirect cost reductions 
that will justify your investment in a unified communications solution:
	
✓	If you are paying for a reservationless audio conference bridge or for 
hosted Web-conferencing, you can completely eliminate them or reduce 
them drastically after you implement the IM, presence, and conferencing 
tools provided by the unified communications solution. 
	
✓	If you enable telecommuting for your employees, you can reduce the 
costs of your office facilities.
	
✓	Immediately reduce or eliminate travel costs and replace them with 
Web-conferencing or videoconferencing.
	
✓	Reduce or consolidate your communications systems — PBXs, voicemail 
systems, and duplicate infrastructures at your sites/locations.
	
✓	Leveraging unified communications tools, improve the individual and 
team productivity, and your savings could be 20 to 30 minutes per day 
or more.
	
The savings potential that we have suggested to our customers in the past 
from their unified communications investments has resulted in customers 
recovering their investments in less than a year. Always implement the solu­
tion components that return the highest cost-savings.
I define each savings opportunity here in general, and as I have said earlier, 
your individual mileage may vary. You can use these general guidelines to 
perform your own savings calculations to arrive at an overall business justifi­
cation for your enterprise. 

58
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Travel
Your enterprise can reduce or eliminate employee travel by leveraging uni­
fied communications tools. You can easily do this without disrupting your 
business effectiveness. You may even save costs for your partners and cus­
tomers because they won’t have to travel, either. If your company collabo­
rates with customers and vendors to create contracts and proposals, you can 
replace those trips with tools like videoconferencing or desktop sharing and 
save cash and time.
Instead of everyone traveling to one place while you are working through the 
contract requirements and creating a first draft, review, second draft, review 
and so on, use the Web-conferencing feature from unified communications:
	
✓	Everyone can view and edit the content of the contract together.
	
✓	You can post the content, if necessary, for someone who didn’t attend. 
	
✓	A unified communications Web-conference can be easily recorded for 
later viewing.
Without anyone traveling, you could very well have a completed final version 
of the contract in less time than it would take if multiple trips for everyone 
were required to get the same work done.
Actual savings will come from reduction in travel expenses by targeting 
those employees who travel the most and enabling them with all the unified 
communications tools, including high-quality headsets or Webcams so their 
Web-conference audio and video quality is the best. For example, imagine a 
company with 1,000 employees. Say that each year, 25 percent of the employ­
ees travel for business five or six times, at an average cost of $1,000 per trip. 
Eliminating one or two trips annually by using the Web-conferencing tools 
available with any unified communications solution translates into a savings 
of $1,000 to $2,000 per employee, multiplied by 250 (25 percent of 1,000) for a 
total savings of $250,000 to $500,000.
Conferencing
Is your organization paying for a third-party audio-, video- or Web-conferencing 
service? When your organization moves to a unified communications solution 
that provides on-premise audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing, you can imme­
diately start replacing many of those conferences over time, perhaps as soon 
as 3 to 6 months. You may want to consider investing in high-quality Webcams 
or headsets to enable users to use VoIP for those meetings/conferences, which 
eliminates the audio-conference bridge costs.

59
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Even though external audio-conferencing services only cost ten cents per 
minute and external videoconferencing services costs 30 cents per minute, it 
can still add up to substantial amounts based on your current usage. Look at 
an example for 1,000 users:
Assume that you are paying $75 per user per month to the audio/video ser­
vice provider. Say your cost of the new unified communications solution for 
audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing is $25, that will result in savings of $50 
per user:
$50 x 1,000=$500,000 potential annual savings for a 1,000-employee 
company.
Telephone tolls and cell phone charges
Does your organization pay for your employees’ long-distance calling charges 
or cellular phone bills? Long-distance calls could cost you between 10 cents 
and 45 cents per minute and cellphone bills could average $100 to $200 per 
month. If only 50 percent of employees’ long-distance and cell phone bills are 
paid by a company of 1,000, and they reduce usage by 50%, cell phone costs 
alone could deliver a potential annual savings of $450,000.
Now that you are looking to deploy unified communications, your users will 
be able to use the secure VoIP for their audio calls anywhere in the world, 
using your existing data network instead of paying the long-distance toll call 
providers. They can even use presence to check if their colleagues across 
the world are available before actually making the VoIP call without wasting 
any bandwidth on your data network. I don’t pick up the phone as much any­
more; instead, I use my communicator to check presence of a colleague or a 
customer/partner (if federated) and then ping that person using IM. 
	
Find people in your company who have higher cellular bills and target them 
for this savings first.
Office facilities costs
Any organization that is deploying unified communications solution and is 
willing to allow its employees to telecommute can target reduction in the 
costs of the office facilities, especially: 
	
✓	Fixed costs like rent and security staff 
	
✓	Variable costs like telephone, electricity, heating, and air-conditioning

60
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Many organizations can use the unified communications solutions to enable 
employees to work remotely, at least part of the time, with few shared “pro­
gressive offices” available when those employees must come to the office.
Organizations can simultaneously reduce costs of office facilities and 
increase employee satisfaction and productivity.
A leading telecommunications company in Europe estimates that saving just 
30 minutes per week for each of its 1,500 employees amounts to $1.48 million 
in productivity gains annually.
A global Internet Protocol (IP) Solutions provider estimates that the aver­
age employee saves 20 minutes a day due to more efficient communications, 
including time to market on product development cycles and increased 
productivity across projects. A manufacturer of folding tables and chairs 
reduced overall voice mail and traditional phone maintenance costs by 
$851,000 annually.
Deploying the System
Most unified communications solutions include provision for what is called 
“Unified Messaging” — a way to integrate call answering and taking voice 
mail messages, maybe even automatic attendant service and access for users 
to retrieve their messages from anywhere. These voicemail messages then 
show up in your Outlook mailbox. You can either 
	
✓	Play them.
	
✓	Have Caller ID information that allows you to directly answer that call. 
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Cisco Unity provide most of the features 
of Unified Messaging. Unified Messaging also enables all incoming faxes to be 
received by the server and dropped in the recipient’s mailbox, eliminating 
the need for fax machines. In today’s unified communications solutions, you 
may still need the fax machines for outgoing faxes, unless you are already 
using computerized fax-sending solutions.
	
Divide your unified communications deployment into at least three phases:
	
1.	 Use presence to reduce interruptions and find people when they’re 
available.
	
2.	 Lower your costs and reduce travel, while increasing collaboration.
	
3.	 Centralize and customize telephony for mobile workers and telecommuters.
The rest of this chapter is your guide.

61
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Phase 1: Implement presence 
and instant messaging
IM and presence make up the core building block on which the rest of the 
unified communications components depend. No matter what component 
of unified communications may be the mission critical for your business 
requirements, you still must start with IM and presence, so why not make 
that your Phase 1 implementation goal?
Your end users will get streamlined communications enabling them to con­
tact the right person, the first time, when they use the presence capabili­
ties. For example, as seen in Figure 4-1, John can make sure that Larry and 
Claire are available (green) before contacting them. If one or the other’s 
presence shows red (busy, do not disturb, in a meeting), John can tag them 
so he gets notified when they are available rather than wasting time trying 
to reach them and getting voicemail. Depending on the unified communica­
tions solution you choose, presence may even be extended to other common 
applications you use every day, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
Sharepoint, and so forth, so you don’t have to leave the application you are 
working with to check someone’s presence. Instead, you always find the right 
person, the first time.

John can

and Claire’s 
presence

municator 
client.
	
Phase 2: Implement conferencing
Most organizations looking at a unified communications solution plan to 
implement the familiar audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing integration into 
their unified communications deployment so users get the advantages of 

62
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
jumping into an audio or video call with one or more colleagues to discuss an 
important 
	
✓	Issue
	
✓	Project
	
✓	Proposal
	
✓	Idea
	
Tackle the implementation of conferencing into your unified communications 
solution in phase 2, after you have deployed IM and presence. IM and presence 
are required building blocks for conferencing, and your users will actually be 
able to use the communicator client on their desktop or any popular application 
to first find those colleagues available and then invite them into either 
	
✓	Audio conference
	
✓	Video conference
	
✓	Web conference
The conferencing component delivers productivity and efficiency for the 
users and reduces costs. This conferencing component is installed on the 
unified communications server that sits in your organization’s back room. 
You take advantage of additional capabilities from the same hardware and 
software that you installed in Phase 1 and enable more features.
Compare that to the cost of your audio conferencing bridge from AT&T or 
Verizon and videoconferencing from third-party companies. If your organiza­
tion was using hosted Web-conferencing solutions like WebEx (Cisco), Live 
Meeting (Microsoft), or GoToMeeting (Citrix), those costs are basically gone 
now that your internal server has enabled on-premise conferencing. No more 
bills to pay, especially the overages if you go over the fixed minutes that you 
signed up for.
You may invite someone locally, nationally, or internationally from your 
computer when you invite them into a conference — audio, video or Web. All 
use the computer with headsets or built-in Webcams, and the data and voice 
that you transmit travel over your data network — LAN and WAN — using 
Internet protocol (IP):
	
✓	Users can invite two people or ten, from around the world
	
✓	There is no need for anyone to travel anywhere, lowering your costs 
while increasing collaboration between colleagues. 
In this phase, I recommend that you deploy audio-, video-, and Web-
conferencing broadly to your users and start reducing or completely elimi­
nating the reservationless audio bridge costs. 

63
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
	
Consider extending the conferencing capabilities to your external customers 
and partners. Imagine your sales and marketing team running Webinars for 
your products and services on a monthly basis and reaching thousands of 
existing or new customers and partners from the comfort of their offices. If it 
is appropriate, they can even invite subject matter experts (from your com­
pany or outside) to present and demo or simply answer questions. Web-
conferencing tools allow you to share a presentation or an application from 
your computer to hundreds of people in your audience, and no one has to 
leave the office to participate. Talking about cost savings, you are now even 
saving your customers and partners from having to travel somewhere.
Phase 3: Implement voice
The enterprise voice component of unified communications delivers 
software-powered VoIP, transmitting data and voice both on your IP network. 
These capabilities also integrate with your existing messaging (e-mail) and 
telephony infrastructure to provide a totally unified experience for the end 
users.
The enterprise voice component significantly reduces the load on your PBX/
PSTN network usage as your users start using their computers to talk and 
collaborate with their colleagues. Most of the unified communications ven­
dors have released devices that provide very high quality voice and video to 
integrate with your unified communications solution. My experience using 
these enterprise voice devices — Bluetooth-enabled headsets, IP phones, 
USB speakerphones, and HD or VGA Webcams — has been very positive. (I 
cover some of them later.) I have a built-in Webcam that came with my Dell 
laptop, and I use it every day to participate in audio- and videoconferences. 
I also am very impressed with Polycom’s USB speakerphone that connects 
easily with my Communicator.
If you’ve already started upgrading your PBX to IP telephony and started 
putting IP phones (phones that use your data network, LAN, instead of the 
telephone network) on users’ desks, then you have a leg up and you can inte­
grate that IP PBX with your unified communications solution and leverage 
that investment faster than you may have anticipated.
As shown in Figure 4-2, John is able to call any phone numbers that have 
been published by Claire directly from his communicator client easily.

Taking everything into account
Figure out which style of company you are and what type of deployment 
category you may fit into. In this section, I categorize businesses into 
three groups and discuss the planning and deployment scenarios for each. 
Obviously, these are sample categories and deployment ideas; you may pick 
and choose what fits in your business and technical requirements. As dis­
cussed earlier, unified communications solutions are “componentized” so 
you may choose a component from another category that fits better in your 
particular situation.
These categories are grouped based on complexity and size of an organization:
	
✓	Small and medium businesses unified communications solution 
applies to companies that have fewer than 5,000 employees, don’t 
need high-availability, and will deploy internal-only IM, presence, and 
conferencing.
	
✓	Large businesses unified communications solution applies to compa­
nies that have more than 5,000 employees, need high-availability, and 
are planning to centralize all servers into a single physical site.
	
✓	Global businesses unified communications solution applies to compa­
nies that have more than 5,000 employees, need high-availability, scal­
ability, external user access, and want enterprise voice.

65
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Small to medium deployment scenarios
The simplest form of unified communications deployment fits the business 
requirements of a small to medium sized organization. In this scenario, it is 
most important to the organization that the unified communications solution 
be simple and economical. I lay out this simple topology so that it can be 
used by the organization to start from and add other building blocks on top 
later, if appropriate. Each subsequent section discusses deployment scenar­
ios that take on more complexity and add functionality and the components 
necessary to enable it.
Small deployment: IM, presence and conferencing for internal users only
The simplest topology provides IM, presence, and conferencing internally for 
a small user base. It may consist of a single server deployment to start with.
This topology is appropriate for small to medium organizations with fewer 
than 5,000 users or pilot deployments in which the main goals are simplic­
ity, economy, and ease of management, and where high availability isn’t a 
requirement. Figure 4-3 shows a simple deployment.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Simple

to medium 
organiza-
tions with

Small deployment with support for external user access
Now add external user access to the preceding small to medium business 
deployment of a single unified communications server. It will allow you to 
support IM, presence, and conferencing both for internal users and external 
users, adding to the initial building block of single server deployment. 

66
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
In this topology, you add a server in your perimeter network (DMZ), called a 
proxy server or edge server, that connects you to the external world by having 
a secure connection to the Internet. This topology enables you to configure 
	
✓	Remote access
	
✓	Federation
	
✓	Public IM connectivity
If you plan to invite external users to conferencing, then you also need to 
deploy an HTTP Reverse Proxy component in your perimeter network, as 
shown in Figure 4-4. This component carries the HTTP and HTTPS traffic to 
the Web components. 
For this topology: 
	
✓	The perimeter network has 
 
• A single edge server 
 
• A HTTP Reverse Proxy server 
	
✓	All three edge server roles are installed on a single computer:
 
• Access Edge Server
 
• Web Conferencing Edge Server
 
• A/V Edge Server 
Figure 4-4 shows a simple deployment with support for external user access.

 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Medium-sized deployment: External user access and voice
In this scenario, a small to medium sized company wants to support IM, pres­
ence, conferencing both for internal users and external users, and the voice 
(VoIP) functionality. Here, you can build upon the simple deployment with 
external access, and add a connection to your PBX into the single server. As 
discussed earlier, you can even leverage your existing PBX that hasn’t been 
upgraded yet to an IP PBX by adding a media gateway. 
Like the simple deployment with external access, as previously described, a 
single edge server is deployed in the perimeter network and the single server 
is connected to the PBX via media gateway for voice functionality.
Figure 4-5 shows a simple deployment with support for external user access 
and voice.
	
Figure 4-5:

Medium-sized deployment with external access and voice in multiple locations
Using the preceding scenario of a medium sized deployment with external 
access and voice in a single location, I now will add the appropriate compo­
nents to support a medium sized company with the following requirements:
	
✓	IM, presence, and conferencing both for internal users and external 
users
	
✓	Voice functionality for multiple locations
Some locations for this medium-sized company have at least 200 employees 
and are growing, so it is recommended to consider adding the additional 
media gateway and voice server at those locations to support the local users 
for voice. 

68
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Also, you must consider each location’s requirements for high-availability 
and traffic for audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing, and then decide whether 
other unified communications components like the edge server should be 
deployed locally. 
A voice server connected to a media gateway will connect to the PBX in the 
local office, and then connect to the PSTN network. The voice server’s job is 
to translate media between the gateway and the single unified communica­
tions server. 
	
Some unified communications gateway vendors may provide advanced media 
gateways that combine the functions of the voice server and media gateway 
integrated into the gateway itself.
Medium-sized deployment: Archiving, external access, 
Web access, and voice in multiple locations
Your organization may be required by federal, state, or local agencies to 
archive all communications: 
	
✓	IM
	
✓	E-mail
	
✓	Voice
So in this scenario, a medium-size company wants to support the following 
functionality:
	
✓	IM, presence, and conferencing both for internal users and external users
	
✓	Voice functionality for multiple locations
	
✓	Internet access to IM functionality using a Web browser
	
✓	The ability to archive IM messages or usage data and capture call detail 
records
 
• Web access for IM: User’s ability to use a browser from any com­
puter to access IM, presence, and audio conferencing
 
• Archive IM or usage data: Capture all IM conversations text as 
well as the date/time stamp for audio and video conversations
 
• Call Detail Records: Capture of all VoIP conversations: who, when, 
how, and so forth, for each audio-, video-, and Web-conference
 
• HTTPS: Secure and encrypt transmission of data over the Internet
I can use the same topology I used in Figure 4-5 with the additional unified 
communications component — Archiving Server — that enables archiving 
and CDR capture via the new server role. I also add a server role called Web 

69
 Chapter 4: Planning Your Deployment
Access Server to enable user’s access to the IM feature over secure Internet 
access (HTTPS) via a browser. Users can access the same IM functionality 
from a Web browser when they’re 
	
✓	On the road
	
✓	Working from a customer site
	
✓	Use a non-Windows computer
In the sample topology diagram, the Archiving and CDR Server is collocated 
on the same server hardware. Based on which unified communications vendor 
you choose, the requirements for the servers may vary a little and you may not 
be able to collocate these two servers on the same box. Figure 4-6 depicts a 
sample topology.

Centralized enterprise deployment scenarios
For large enterprises that are centralized into a single physical site but 
require high availability internally, topology will change to provide for 24/7 
high-availability. The simplest design that will provide high availability inter­
nally is to deploy multiple IM/presence servers (also called front-end servers) 
in a pool. These front-end servers can be load-balanced with a hardware load 
balancer and connected to multiple database servers.
The following deployment scenarios are supported:
	
✓	Enterprise deployment: IM and conferencing for internal and external 
users
	
✓	Scaled deployment with high availability

70
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Enterprise deployment supporting IM, conferencing and voice with high-availability
In larger enterprises, when instant messaging, presence, and conferencing 
are considered mission critical, high availability is a requirement. Any enter­
prise pool with multiple Enterprise Edition Servers can provide basic high 
availability.
In its simplest configuration, a consolidated topology, each Enterprise 
Edition Server in a pool runs all server roles: Front-End, A/V Conferencing, 
and Web Conferencing, as well as IIS for the Web Components. A consoli­
dated pool can support up to 30,000 users. The advantage of the consoli­
dated configuration over the expanded configuration is ease of management.

In This Chapter
▶	Unified messaging
▶	Working with voicemail
▶	Managing and routing calls
▶	Integrating the PC and desk phone
T
he telephone is one of the most common and widely used communica­
tions devices in existence. Ever since Alexander Graham Bell uttered the 
famous line “Mr. Watson, come here — I want to see you” to his assistant 
Thomas Watson in March 1876, the telephone has been a staple of communi­
cations around the world.
As the leading communications technology, it has earned a position as the 
keystone of most unified communications deployments. As communications 
technology evolves, it doesn’t mean that voice communication will become 
a thing of the past. On the contrary, as unified communications expands the 
functionality of voice communications, it will evolve and enable organizations 
and individuals to have more control and flexibility in how they use it.
This chapter explores how unified communications has impacted voice commu­
nications beginning with unified messaging and the convergence of communica­
tions to a single inbox. It then covers the new ways that unified communications 
and unified messaging enable you to work with voicemail messages, and 
explores how you can be contacted using a single phone number by managing 
how calls are directed. The chapter wraps up with an overview of how unified 
communications integrates the PC desktop with the traditional desk phone and 
the benefits of that merger.
Understanding Unified Messaging
Unless you have been living under a rock for the past 20 or 30 years, you 
should be familiar with the concept of voicemail. We have come a long way, 
though, from the days of using an analog audio tape on a machine physically 
connected to the phone.

72
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Local telephone service providers have offered some type of digital voicemail 
feature for decades. However, that voicemail service generally is tied to a 
specific phone number. It’s possible to dial in and retrieve voicemail from 
virtually any phone in the world, but you are restricted to listening to and 
saving or deleting messages one at a time, sequentially. It certainly isn’t the 
most efficient system in the world.
One inbox for all
Unified messaging takes the concept of voicemail to a whole new level. 
Rather than having to dial into one system to get voicemail and access a dif­
ferent system to receive faxes, and log into a server to get e-mail messages, 
unified messaging enables you to have a single message store or inbox for all 
communications.
Top five benefits of unified messaging
Unified messaging provides a number of ben­
efits for users:
	 1.	 A single inbox. Unified messaging can 
deliver all types of messaging and commu­
nication to a single inbox. The single inbox 
is easier for administrators to maintain, and 
provides flexibility for users to manage and 
interact with all of their communications.
	 2.	 Efficient communication. Users can com­
municate more efficiently by having access 
to all communications at one time and being 
free to share, forward, or manage them in 
the way that’s most convenient or effective 
for the given communication.
	 3.	 Cost savings. Merging streamlines the 
communications administration and 
consolidates the infrastructure onto fewer 
physical servers, saving money for the 
enterprise.
	 4.	 Access from anywhere. Unified messaging 
provides alternative methods of accessing 
communications. By merging e-mail, voice, 
and other communications, users can get 
voice messages in e-mail, have e-mail dic­
tated over the phone, or access communi­
cations via the Web.
	 5.	 Effective search. Rather than sifting 
through different applications and execute 
multiple searches, users can quickly con­
duct searches of all communications and 
easily locate the data they are looking for.

73
 Chapter 5: Unifying Voice
The concept of unified messaging and the features it delivers vary from 
vendor to vendor, but in general these are some of the capabilities you can 
expect:
	
✓	Automated Attendant. An automated attendant is like a virtual recep­
tionist or operator. The automated attendant may work on either touch-
tone menu input or voice-response recognition and can make it simpler 
and more intuitive for callers to reach the department or individual they 
are seeking.
	
✓	Receiving Voicemails. Rather than being stored on a separate phone 
server or system, voicemail messages are stored in a common inbox 
along with e-mail and other communications. Voicemails can be played 
directly from within an e-mail or may be attached to the e-mail as an 
audio file (Figure 5-1). Receiving voicemail in the e-mail inbox also 
expands the options for accessing voicemail; it can be retrieved
 
• From a phone
 
• From the e-mail client
 
• Through Web-based e-mail access
 
• Through e-mail access on a mobile phone
	
✓	Receiving Faxes. If you receive faxes on a stand-alone fax machine that 
spits out actual paper copies of the message, this won’t help you much. 
However, if you rely on a fax server, the faxes can be rerouted to a uni­
fied messaging inbox. Old-fashioned faxing requires that you be physi­
cally present at the site of the fax machine in order to receive it; unified 
messaging faxes can be accessed anywhere, any time, in all of the same 
ways previously mentioned for accessing voicemail.

74
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
✓	Voicemail Notification. Traditional voicemail typically relies on either a 
flashing light on the telephone handset or a stutter tone when the phone 
is picked up to notify you that there is a pending message. With unified 
messaging, the user receives the voicemail in e-mail, making it acces­
sible from anywhere in the world at any time, plus the softphone client 
generally has some sort of voicemail notification to alert the user that 
there’s a new voicemail.
	
✓	Direct Access to Voicemail. Some enterprise phone systems have this capa­
bility already, but it is still a cool feature. With voice tied into unified messag­
ing, you can leave voicemail for a co-worker without actually ringing their 
phone. If you want to leave messages for someone without interrupting that 
person or just want to leave a reminder without having an actual conversa­
tion, the capability to connect directly to voicemail can come in handy.
	
✓	Route Playback to Phone. Even though unified communications and 
unified messaging can give you the capability to play your messages 
back on your computer either through the softphone client or by playing 
an embedded or attached audio file from an e-mail, you might not always 
want to do this. If you are in a coffee shop or sitting in an airport, you 
may want your messages to be private. Unified messaging allows you to 
initiate playback of voicemail messages on your computer, but reroute 
them to your desktop or mobile phone.
	
A unified messaging inbox uses significantly more space than a traditional 
e-mail inbox. Adding audio/video content and images (such as faxes) can 
quickly fill standard message storage. As you implement unified communica­
tions and unified messaging, you will need to account for this and expand the 
storage capacity.
You’ve Got (Voice)mail
With unified communications and the convergence of voicemail with e-mail 
and with the PC desktop, you have new ways to interact with voicemail mes­
sages. You’re probably used to some sort of light on your desk phone or a 
stutter dial tone when you lift the handset to alert you when a new voicemail 
message is waiting.
Depending on the unified communications platform, those notifications may 
be extended to the desktop by either
	
✓	Unified communications client. The unified communications softphone 
or instant messaging client application typically has some sort of notifi­
cation to alert you when a new voicemail message is available.
	
✓	Windows systray. The unified communications software may tie into the 
Windows desktop and provide some sort of message waiting indicator in 
the systray of the Microsoft Windows operating system.

75
 Chapter 5: Unifying Voice
Playing voicemail from the unified 
communications application
The integration of voicemail and e-mail provides additional options for listening 
to voicemail messages. The softphone or unified communications client applica­
tion typically provides the capability to access and listen to voicemail messages. 
For example, with Microsoft Unified Communications you can contact the voice­
mail system directly from Microsoft Office Communicator with a single click.
Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 has a Change Greetings option which 
provides one-click access to enable you to change the greeting message for your 
Exchange voicemail. You can record a new message and work with the voicemail 
settings directly from the Microsoft Office Communicator application.
Getting voicemail in your e-mail
Voicemail is an essential feature to have for a phone system. The capability 
to leave a voicemail is certainly better than having the phone ring indefinitely 
with no way to reach the user. However, voicemail has its drawbacks as well.
Generally, users only receive their voicemail when they use the phone that 
the voicemail was left on. Most voicemail systems also provide some method 
of remotely retrieving messages by calling in to the voicemail system, but 
those features are rarely used unless someone is going to be away from the 
office for an extended period of time.
With unified messaging, voicemails are delivered to the same inbox as e-mail 
and other communications and can be retrieved using an e-mail client. Users 
often have e-mail delivered on their mobile phones and many organizations 
have Web-based access to the enterprise e-mail system, so the capability to 
receive voicemail in e-mail means that you have access to your voicemail vir­
tually anytime and anywhere.
Some unified communications systems attach voicemail messages as an MP3, 
WAV, or other audio file format to an e-mail. 
Other unified communications platforms, such as Microsoft Unified 
Communications, embed the voicemail in the e-mail itself. In fact, when using 
Microsoft Exchange with Unified Messaging and Microsoft Outlook, voicemail 
messages have an embedded audio player so they can be played directly 
from within the e-mail without the need for any additional audio utilities.

76
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
With Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange voicemail, you can also click 
Play on Phone to have the voicemail system call you on your phone if you 
want to listen to the voicemail messages with more privacy than you may 
have by blaring them over your computer speaker. If you’re in a coffee shop 
or other public area, this can be a handy feature.
Hang on, let me grab a pen
Odds are good that at some point in your life you have listened to a barely 
intelligible voicemail message in which someone left information such as 
directions to a location or a phone number, and it was difficult to hear the 
details. With traditional voicemail, you had little choice but to continuously 
replay the message and record one deciphered tidbit at a time while writing 
it down on a sticky note or a scrap of paper.
Being able to play the voicemail as an audio file — whether embedded within 
the e-mail itself or attached to an audio file — gives you much greater flexibil­
ity by enabling you to
	
✓	Pause
	
✓	Rewind
	
✓	Repeat
	
✓	Adjust the volume
Integrating with other applications
Another benefit provided by unified communi­
cations and the merger of voicemail and e-mail 
is the capability to integrate with other applica­
tions to provide relevant information in addition 
to the voicemail message itself.
The e-mail message containing the voicemail 
generally will contain any Caller ID info that was 
collected during the incoming call. Typically, 
the Caller ID info is also clickable, meaning that 
you can place a return call to that number with 
a simple mouse click.
Some unified communications implementa­
tions take this benefit a step further, though, by 
resolving the Caller ID information against your 
contact list or against a customer relationship 
manager (CRM) database of some sort.
This functionality can help you be more efficient 
and effective by adding valuable information to 
the message. Rather than having just a phone 
number with a voicemail message, you can 
have the caller’s 
	✓	Name
	✓	Company
	✓	Title
	✓	Notes from previous contacts
	✓	Sales history

77
 Chapter 5: Unifying Voice
Most desk phones enable you to adjust the volume, but doing so is often 
more complex or cumbersome than adjusting the volume on the PC, and the 
PC can produce much louder volume than the phone.
Products like Microsoft Exchange Server enable Outlook users to add 
thoughts and type notes that stay attached to the voicemail. Instead of small 
scraps of paper that are lost, the notes entered into Outlook with a voicemail 
message stay there. You can refer to the notes you entered and recall unique 
details or pertinent facts related to that message, whether you access that 
voicemail either
	
✓	Next week
	
✓	Next month
	
✓	Next year
More importantly, the data entered into the notes of the voicemail is indexed 
and becomes searchable text. You can locate old voicemail messages much 
more quickly and efficiently by typing some information into the notes that 
can serve as relevant search terms should you ever need to find the voice­
mail again.
Sharing messages
Another limitation of traditional voicemail messages and faxes is that their 
use typically is limited to the recipient. Granted, a fax could be re-faxed to 
another recipient, but that generally involves printing it, and then rescanning 
and transmitting it, which wastes ink, paper, and time. In most cases, mes­
sages can’t be forwarded or shared as voicemail.
Because unified messaging enables you to receive your voicemails and faxes 
embedded or attached to e-mails in a single, unified inbox, it also enables you 
to work with those message types any way you can work with e-mail messages.
With unified messaging and a single inbox you have greater control and flex­
ibility for sharing communications with others. Some examples of this flex­
ibility include:
	
✓	Voicemail can be forwarded to other individuals or groups that may be 
more appropriate to address an issue.
	
✓	Voicemail can be escalated to management to resolve problems.
	
✓	Faxed purchase orders can be forwarded to appropriate departments 
for handling.
	
✓	Voicemail and fax messages can be backed up and archived for future 
reference.

78
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
The capability to store, forward, and distribute all forms of communication, 
including voicemail, faxes, and instant messages, creates opportunities for 
users to increase productivity. At an organizational level, unified messaging, 
and the capability to share messages in this way, enables processes to be 
automated and business to be executed more efficiently.
Single Point of Contact
Have you ever missed an important phone call? Have you ever needed to get 
in touch with someone urgently, but were unable to find that person? Did it 
take multiple calls to various numbers to finally track down the individual? 
The voice capabilities of unified communications help to minimize or elimi­
nate these issues.
With unified communications, you can take advantage of features that enable 
others to determine if you’re available and to reach you no matter where you 
are. For starters, Presence (see Chapter 2) helps people to identify with a 
glance if you’re available to accept a phone call immediately.
If you know from users’ presence status that they’re either on a call or in a 
meeting and can’t receive a phone call at this time, you can opt for alterna­
tive communications methods. You may be able to communicate via instant 
messaging or e-mail.
This section focuses on a different, but related, aspect of unified communica­
tions: the ability to direct a single phone number to multiple destinations.
Think about that for a minute. Consider the information you currently have 
stored in your contact manager. Some users might have five or more phone 
numbers:
	
✓	Work phone
	
✓	Work fax
	
✓	Work mobile phone
	
✓	Personal mobile phone
	
✓	Home phone
If you need to get in touch with someone, you might call each one of those 
numbers in succession (with the possible exception of the fax line) and still 
have no assurance of reaching that person. If the call is urgent, you may fur­
ther complicate matters by leaving a voicemail message at all of the numbers. 
All in all, an inefficient system for contacting someone.

79
 Chapter 5: Unifying Voice
Using the functionality available in unified communications, you have a vari­
ety of options at your disposal to control how your incoming calls are man­
aged. In effect, a single point of contact can be achieved by routing all calls to 
a single phone number.
Two primary functions available with virtually any unified communications 
platform can be used to consolidate phone numbers:
	
✓	Call Forwarding: You can use call forwarding to route incoming calls to 
an alternate number. 
	
	Call forwarding typically can be configured to either
 
• Forward all incoming calls immediately.
 
• Forward calls only after you don’t answer after a specified number 
of rings on the number that was initially dialed.
	
✓	Simultaneous Ring: With simultaneous ring, you can assign an alternate 
number that will receive the incoming call at the same time that it is 
ringing on the number that was initially dialed.
Some of the more robust unified communications platforms take things a 
step farther by allowing custom rules that forward and reroute calls. For 
example, calls from an individual or group can be forwarded to a mobile 
phone to ensure they are received while other calls can be routed to a differ­
ent group or individual to be addressed in your absence or simply be allowed 
to go to voicemail.
Merging Phone and PC
Although the clock seems to be ticking on the traditional desk phone, you 
would be hard-pressed to find an enterprise that has simply ditched the 
phone in favor of purely software-based communications. For now, organiza­
tions are more interested in finding ways to leverage their existing invest­
ment in their voice communications infrastructure and integrating the pieces 
they already have with their chosen unified communications platform.
The goal of unified communications is to simplify and integrate communi­
cations so that users can work more efficiently and increase productivity. 
Having a desk phone and a software-based phone sitting on the same desk 
requires that users have some level of integration and work cooperatively 
toward those goals.

80
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Remote call control
With remote call control (RCC), you can integrate your unified communica­
tions platform with your existing Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone 
system. RCC enables you to leverage some of the capabilities of unified com­
munications without requiring you to migrate to a VoIP-based phone system.
Essentially, an RCC integrated system ties the existing PBX infrastructure in 
to the unified communications environment:
	
✓	When users make or receive a call using their desk phone, the presence 
status in unified communications is updated to reflect that they are on a 
call. 
	
✓	The unified communications softphone application can be used to make 
and receive calls and otherwise interact with the desk phone.
The functionality of RCC is dependent on the capabilities of the PBX system 
being leveraged, but may include
	
✓	Placing calls
	
✓	Receiving calls
	
✓	Initiating call waiting
	
✓	Placing calls on hold
	
✓	Viewing Caller ID
	
✓	Transferring calls
	
✓	Forwarding calls
	
✓	Accessing a missed call notification
Dual-forking
Dual-forking is similar to RCC: It enables an enterprise to leverage the existing 
PBX infrastructure and integrate it with the unified communications experience.
Dual-forking by itself provides a variety of capabilities to enable you to use 
the unified communications environment to work with the PBX-based desk 
phone and vice versa. Dual-forking can also be used in conjunction with the 
RCC scenario, as described previously, to provide a more robust integration 
between the two infrastructures.

ave you used any form of instant messaging yet? Have you heard of 
	
	
✓	America Online (AOL)?
	
✓	Yahoo! Instant Messenger?
	
✓	MSN Messenger?
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger? 
If not, please ask a teenager or a twenty-something individual and you will 
find out what that generation is using and how are they using it. You may 
even try one of the free IM solutions just to learn. Who knows — maybe you 
will like it so much that you won’t be able to live without it, either.
This chapter starts with the history of instant messaging and how it has 
evolved. I highlight what corporations are doing with instant messaging 
today and what I recommend you look at to get the most benefit out of 
instant messaging.
Evolution of Instant Messaging
Instant messaging (IM) is a way for two or more people to communicate with 
each other instantly — in real-time — by each typing text. In most cases, 
these people are connected with each other via the Internet, but in some 

82
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
cases it is possible that they all work for the same company and are con­
nected to the company’s local area network (LAN). It is also possible that 
they don’t have access to the Internet and so they can only communicate via 
IM with their colleagues in the company.
Instant messaging solutions also provide you access to the real-time pres­
ence (availability) of the people whom you have added to your contact list. 
For example, John Williams works in the marketing department of his com­
pany and always works with Suzy McNeil and Claire McBride, both of whom 
are also in marketing. Occasionally, John works with Larry Smith in Finance. 
After John adds Suzy, Claire, and Larry to his contacts list, he can very easily 
see their presence online. 
Instant messaging (or chatting, as it used to be called by the teenagers) 
became popular in the early 1990s when vendors upgraded the text-based IM 
applications to a Graphical User Interface (GUI). In 1992, CU-SeeMe offered 
the very first IM solution that even allowed you to use audio and video while 
chatting. But, America Online really should be credited for revolutionizing 
the industry by offering AOL Instant Messenger in 1997.
Microsoft launched MSN instant messenger soon after Yahoo! launched its 
own IM, and IBM released one of the very first enterprise solutions, known 
as Lotus Sametime, in 1998. A consumer solution known as Pidgin emerged 
around the same time; it supported many popular IM protocols and became 
a popular desktop client that you could use to connect to different vendors’ 
services.
Figure 6-1 shows an image of what the early IM clients looked like and illus­
trates that they even allowed you to add contacts to your client application 
from different places like 
	
✓	Work
	
✓	Friends
	
✓	Family
Pidgin has about 3.5 million active users, AOL has over 50 million, and MSN 
(now called Windows Live Messenger) has more than 200 million. IBM Lotus 
Sametime has over 15 million active users (in private corporations). 
WebEx revolutionized the market with its introduction of Web-conferencing— 
audio/video and application sharing features added to the IM function­
ality. Microsoft followed with its Live Meeting service, and Citrix with 
GoToMeeting. All of these services are provided for a fee, moving away 
from the earlier free-services business model like MSN or Yahoo!.

83
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Chapter 2 discusses the concept of presence — the capability to see which 
of your contacts are available online at this instant so you can send them a 
quick instant message. IM also allows a user to easily multi-task; for example, 
you can have separate IM conversations with multiple people at the same 
time. Many times when I was on the phone with a customer who asked me a 
licensing question — which I am not an expert on — I could easily IM one of 
my licensing experts and ask for an answer.
Many employees, especially young college graduates, are demanding unified 
communications solution tools because they have been used to them while 
in college and high school. They want the same (or better) capabilities in the 
workplace. Many employers are listening to these demands from employees 
who have learned the value of these tools, and have started evaluating and 
deploying these unified communications solutions. Companies are also rec­
ognizing the business value and savings to be gained when they use these 
IM tools to communicate efficiently with their customers and partners, espe­
cially if they are geographically dispersed.
If you haven’t experienced it already, you soon will see the business value as 
well as the individual productivity improvement you can gain by using some 
or all of the tools mentioned in this and earlier chapters: 
	
✓	Instant messaging
	
✓	Audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing
	
✓	Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) based calling

Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
It will also soon become evident that if you are using e-mail today to com­
municate, IM conversations will save you time and effort while getting your 
answers quickly because most IM conversations tend to be short and don’t 
drag into multiple subjects. You will probably use IM and presence to get a 
quick answer to a question or jump into an impromptu short application/
desktop sharing session with a colleague or customer/partner. I used my IM 
contact list of customers and partners while I was at Microsoft to keep in 
touch with them occasionally so that we were all on the same page — espe­
cially when we were engaged in projects.
Another great benefit of IM and presence is that you can change your pres­
ence manually so that you can focus on a project or proposal deadline and 
remove yourself from being disturbed. Sort of like closing the door of your 
office and hanging a “Do Not Disturb” sign. You can very easily change your 
presence status to “busy” or “do not disturb,” thus flagging your unavailabil­
ity to communicate. As shown in Figure 6-2, John really has to finish the tasks 
on his to-do list and doesn’t want any disturbance so he hangs a “Do Not 
Disturb” sign for his status (availability).
	
Figure 6-2: 
John 
turns his 
presence 
(availability) 
to “Do Not 
Disturb.”
	
As a business evaluating unified communications solutions, you obviously 
have some choices to make: Should you either
	
✓	Stay with free or lower priced hosted consumer solutions, like 
 
• AOL
 
• Yahoo!
 
• Windows Live
	
✓	Implement your own enterprise solution, like 
 
• Cisco Unified Presence Server 
 
• Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 

85
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
	
The answer depends on your industry:
	
✓	If your company is in an industry such as financial services, health-
care, or any of the industries that have to meet stringent federal, state, 
or local regulations for security, archiving, and compliance, then you 
would be better off implementing your own server-based solution. 
	
✓	If you aren’t in an industry that is strictly regulated and you have 
smaller budgets to work with, you can start out with one of the con­
sumer IM solutions like AOL, Yahoo!, or Windows Live to get your feet 
wet and learn. 
	
	After you see the business value and need more security or more fea­
tures, you can look at either 
 
• Your own in-house implementation 
 
• One of the hosted unified communications solutions provided 
through Microsoft, GoToMeeting, Cisco, and so forth.
Instant Messaging in Corporate 
Enterprises
You may be reading this book because you are facing the challenges that many 
executives and information workers in similar businesses are experiencing:
	
✓	You are a small business but need to communicate with customers and 
partners nationally or around the globe.
	
✓	You are a medium-sized company that has employees spread around the 
country or the world who need to communicate and collaborate effectively.
	
✓	You are a large enterprise that has many different solutions imple­
mented for communicating and collaborating but none are integrated.
	
✓	You need quick and fast response to customer inquiries or sales oppor­
tunities inside your organization and able to compete with competitors 
to gain competitive advantage.
Before the introduction of the unified communications solutions at my 
employer, the only option I had to communicate and collaborate with my 
colleagues, customers, and partners was e-mail. I first sent project docu­
ments and proposals to my colleagues and management for review, and 
then waited for their feedback. If I needed an answer right away or we were 
under some strict deadline, I made my e-mail high priority. If I didn’t get an 
answer or feedback on my proposal when I expected it, I started calling all 
parties involved, including my manager, and leaving voice mail. If I really got 
frustrated, I even called their cell phones. If I didn’t reach them, I left urgent 
messages. 

86
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Of course, after my repeated voice mails and maybe a 911 in my e-mail 
subject line, they all started calling me back at my desk. If I didn’t answer 
my desk phone, they called my cell phone. Many times, I was in an urgent 
meeting with a customer or business partner. It wasn’t anyone’s fault that 
we couldn’t connect easily or quickly; unfortunately, during those years, we 
didn’t have the instant messaging and presence solutions that would have 
gotten us out of the mess of missed connections.
Your employees, customers, and partners may be spread nationally or glob­
ally and the competitors are looking for any and all advantages they can gain 
to communicate and collaborate better. To beat the competition and become 
an agile business, you need to recognize the business value of unified com­
munications solutions and become smarter and faster in responding to your 
customer and partner requirements.
Many corporate executives and decision makers have become believers 
in the promise of unified communications, especially after they have seen 
the actual product demos and literature. Industry pundits like Gartner and 
Forrester Research are forecasting that by 2012, the unified communica­
tions market will be a $10-billion market and 5 million users in the corporate 
world will be using some form of unified communications solution on their 
desktops. The research shows that more than 50 percent of enterprises now 
report that they are evaluating, installing, or running unified communications 
solutions.
Manufacturing
A U.S.-based manufacturing company with 15 sites and about 1,500 employ­
ees learned that each site had its own PBX. When customers called a branch 
office, they could be transferred multiple times before reaching the right 
person. There was no easy way for employees at the branch offices or the 
headquarters to communicate and collaborate with each other. Employees at 
one site needed to call long-distance to get to the employees at other sites or 
the headquarters.
The manufacturing company realized that a unified communications solution 
could provide a way for all employees, regardless of their location, to look up 
a colleague’s presence and transfer the customer calls to someone who could 
immediately respond. Even better, the person responding could find experts 
if needed to answer a critical question by looking up their presence and IM 
them — thus being able to close the sale in one single phone call from the 
customer.
The manufacturer installed the Cisco unified communications solution. The 
company already had a Cisco network; using the network as the platform for 
communications simplified management and administration.

87
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Real-time presence of experts became the clear competitive advantage. 
During a single call, employees resolved any issues by providing the expert’s 
advice and secured the contract before hanging up the phone.
Advertising and Marketing
A leading international advertising and marketing firm needed a way to col­
laborate on key projects internally as well as with customers and partners 
internationally. Many of these collaborative sessions could be scheduled in 
advance, but a few could be last-minute, impromptu meetings that were a 
matter of success or failure. The company had 15,000 employees in 165 cities 
worldwide. Its major clients included IBM, American Express, SAP, Cisco, and 
others.
The company realized that its collaboration needs could be satisfied by invest­
ing in some of the hosted Web-conferencing solutions like WebEx, Microsoft 
Live Meeting, and so forth, but being forward-thinking, the decision-makers 
researched other full-featured unified communications solutions so they could 
take advantage of presence and IM to become productive and faster than their 
competition.
In 2006, they upgraded to Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.0 and 
Unified Presence Server 6.0 to take advantage of presence information, which 
lets employees consult an online directory on their laptops to see whether 
co-workers are available and how best to reach them. The company also 
implemented the mobile communicator to allow traveling employees access 
to all the unified communications tools while on the road and still be acces­
sible and communicate.
The company also realized that being an early adopter of the unified com­
munications solutions attracted younger college graduates because of the 
advanced communication and collaboration tools offered.
In 2008, the company upgraded again to Cisco Unified Communications 
Manager 7.0 and added Cisco Unified Personal Communicator and Cisco 
Unity Connection. Approximately 500 employees have eliminated the need 
for a traditional phone by using their MacBook Pro laptops with Cisco Unified 
Personal Communicator, a desktop application that integrates all communi­
cations services that employees use frequently, including instant messaging, 
presence, voice message access, click to call, videoconferencing, user direc­
tory, and call history.

88
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Enterprises, big and small, are taking advantage of unified communications 
solutions to provide their employees new ways to perform their jobs while 
improving their productivity and improving customer and partner satisfac­
tion. They are achieving these results by using 
	
✓	Instant messaging
	
✓	Presence (availability)
	
✓	Audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing
	
✓	Enterprise VoIP to make calls over the Internet protocol
Wholesaler
A Canadian wholesaler realized that managers were traveling a lot to 
attend meetings in the U.S. to visit dealers. They evaluated popular Web-
conferencing solutions: WebEx and Microsoft Office Live Meeting. They 
selected Microsoft Office Live Meeting and started using the hosted service.
By May 2007, Microsoft Office Live Meeting and Round Table — a panoramic 
camera that delivers a 360-degree view of the room — were in use through­
out the company. After learning that Microsoft Office Live Meeting can be run 
internally on Office Communications Server 2007, the company deployed the 
on-premise solution. 
By holding meetings online instead of in person, the company saves 
$300,000 annually. In addition, ongoing training sessions, which also were 
held in Montreal, Canada, were costly for the company to conduct because 
they included overnight visits. By using Microsoft Office Live Meeting and 
RoundTable camera, they reduce another $100,000 in travel and meeting 
costs. 
Best practices for instant messaging 
in the enterprise
While evaluating or actually using the unified communications tools, you 
may look at the suggestions below as tips and tricks for an efficient way to 
improve productivity.
Managing your contacts and contact list
After you start using the unified communications tools, especially the com­
municator client on your desktop, you will see that your contact list (buddy 
list) will build and grow. This list may include colleagues whom you typi­
cally communicate with, customers and partners (if enabled), and family and 
friends (if enabled). 

89
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
	
Keep your contact list small and compact so you can easily find someone in 
your own list. For example, say you’re working on a project with Sam Johnson 
from the Bradley Group. After the project is done, you should remove Sam 
from your list. It is very possible that now you are working on a project with 
Swati from Shah Associates and want to add her in your contact list. Keep 
your contact list updated with the people in your company whom you typi­
cally work with.
As shown in Figure 6-3, John wants to find Suzy McNeil, his coworker in the 
Marketing Department. John simply starts typing Suzy in the communica­
tor’s Find (Search) box, and anyone whose first name is Suzy shows up in the 
search results box. John highlights Suzy McNeil’s name and right-clicks on it. 
Because John has created a Contact Group — Marketing — already, he easily 
adds Suzy to the Marketing Group.
	
Figure 6-3: 
John finds 
Suzy and 
adds her 
to the

group.
	
Creating contact groups
You can create groups of your company’s departments that you generally 
work with so you can easily IM the whole group or send an IM to someone in 
that group. Putting co-workers, customers, and partners in their own groups 
will allow you to find them easily after your contact list has grown.

90
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Figure 6-4 shows that John has created groups for Finance and Marketing, the 
two departments that John communicates with all the time.
If your company has enabled “federation” or “public IM Connectivity,” then 
you can even create groups for your customers and partners who use simi­
lar unified communications solutions or have IM accounts on AOL, MSN, or 
Yahoo!. 
In Figure 6-4, John has added two groups:
	
✓	“Bradley Group” because he typically works with Tony Bradley and Sam 
Johnson of the Bradley Group
	
✓	“Shah Associates” because John works with Swati, Lilam, and Satish 
Shah on a regular basis
	
Figure 6-4: 
John 
created 
groups and 
organized 
his contacts 
in groups.
	
	
To add a public IM contact or a federated contact, your organization must 
be configured for public IM connectivity or federation. Contact your system 
administrator to make sure you have been enabled for public IM or federation.
Create new groups
In the Contact List, right-click a group name, select Create New Group, type 
a name for the group, and then press ENTER. To add contacts to the group, 
simply drag them from an existing group or from the Search Results box.
Manage your presence and access levels
Each contact in your Contact List has a Presence button to the left of his or 
her name that reflects availability and willingness to be contacted.

91
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
View a contact’s contact card
By simply clicking a contact’s Presence button, you will be able to see details 
about that contact’s title, office, calendar information, as well as phone num­
bers and the best way to contact that person. John can see Claire’s contact 
card by clicking the presence icon next to her name, as shown in Figure 6-5.

Control access to your presence information
As seen from Claire’s contact card above, along with presence, most unified 
communications solutions also show your phone numbers and calendar 
information to anyone looking at your contact card. You can control who can 
see your mobile or home number and calendar information. Communicator 
may enable you to set Access Levels — different tiers of access that you can 
assign to your teammates versus the rest of the company.

Change a person’s access level
Right-click a contact’s name, click Change Level of Access, and then select a 
level, such as Team for your teammates, as shown in Figure 6-7.

Block a person from contacting you
When someone adds you to his or her contact list, you may get an alert that 
says Mary wants to add you to her contact list — do you want to allow her to 
do that? If you know Mary and want to allow her, you can say yes and at the 
same time add Mary to the proper contact group in your contact list as well 
as assign her an access level.
But if you don’t know Mary, or for some reason you don’t want Mary to be 
able to see your presence or communicate with you, you can block her.
In the Contact List, right-click a contact’s name, click Change Level of 
Access, and then select Blocked.
Contacts who can interrupt you
You can manage a list of people whom you want to be able to interrupt you 
even when your presence status is “Do Not Disturb.” If Suzy and Larry are 
those people, you can click on Suzy’s name first. While pressing the CTRL 
key, click on Larry’s contact, and then right-click your selection, select 
Change Level of Access, and select Team.

 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Customize your presence information
Most communicator clients provide a set of personal presence attributes that 
you can customize and make available to other contacts to help them com­
municate with you: 
	
✓	Presence status. 
	
✓	Location.
	
✓	A personal note.
Add and publish phone numbers
	
Once you have added people into your Team access level, it is a good idea 
to let them contact you on your mobile number, especially when you are on 
the road. Most communicator clients will allow you to publish multiple phone 
numbers — work, mobile, and home. You should at least publish the work and 
mobile phone numbers for the team.
For your executive assistant, boss, or someone else whom you want to have 
your home number: 
	
✓	Assign that person the Personal access level.
	
✓	Publish your home number. 
The Personal access level allows contacts to see your home number.
Manually change your presence status
Obviously, from time to time, you will want to close the door to your office 
and hang a “Do Not Disturb” card — such as when you are working on a criti­
cal proposal or are in an impromptu meeting with the boss. In the old days, 
you may have done just that — stick a yellow sticky note saying “Please Do 
Not Disturb” on your door or cubicle entrance. But now that your company 
has advanced to the electronic era of online presence, you should set your 
presence status in communicator by clicking your presence button, and then 
selecting the appropriate status, such as “Do not Disturb.” Figure 6-8 indi­
cates that John Williams will “Be Right Back.”
Set your location
It is always a good idea to let people know where you are working from 
today. Most communicator clients allow you to select your location to let 
your co-workers know that you are
	
✓	On the road
	
✓	Working from a client’s office
	
✓	Working from home

94
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Click your Presence button, point to Current Location, and then either
	
✓	Select a location — office or home 
	
✓	Create a custom location, such as 
 
• Client’s office in Chicago 
 
• On the road in New York
This gives your colleagues an idea of how best to reach you.
	
Figure 6-8: 
Manually

the pres-
ence status.
	
Create a customized note
You can add a personal note to give more precise information. For example, if 
you have to leave your office unexpectedly, you can set your presence status 
to Be Right Back and add a custom note that says how long you will be gone. 
It takes only a few seconds to keep your information up-to-date. That’s a good 
habit to get into.
Click in the Type a note box (see Figure 6-8), and then enter a note. Click out­
side the box when you are done.
Your presence information and access levels
Each communicator contact, including you, has a full set of presence attri­
butes that describe availability, activity, and willingness to be contacted. 
Presence attributes also include contact information such as phone numbers, 
personal notes, and location. The amount and type of presence information 
that you make available to others is controlled by Access Levels. For exam­
ple, when you assign a contact to the Team Access Level, that contact has 
access to your mobile phone number, calendar “free or busy” information, 
and your location (refer to Figure 6-7).

95
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Sending and receiving instant messages
IM can take the place of e-mail or a phone call. You can avoid the possibility 
of having to leave a voice mail and getting into a phone-tag scenario when 
you use IM. 
Only send an IM after checking others’ presence (availability). Remember 
that you can save the IM conversations yourself and if you need to, send a file 
to a colleague during an IM session. 
	
Always type a Conversation Subject when the IM window opens, so the recipi­
ent knows the context of the IM and pays appropriate attention.
Customize your instant messages
	
When you are in IM communication with others, create a customized person­
ality for your IMs. Most communicators will allow you to customize the font 
and color for your instant messages — plus you can save your choices.
Add an emoticon
To emphasize a point, you may add an emoticon to your IM. Place the mouse 
cursor where you want to add the emoticon, click the emoticon button, and 
then select the emoticon.
Send an instant message to a group
Creating groups for your contacts has another benefit:
	
✓	If you want to send an IM to the whole group — Marketing or Finance — 
right-click the name of the group, and then select Send an Instant Message.
	
✓	If you want to send an IM to two or more people, click the first contact, 
hold the CTRL key, and select the second contact. Right-click and select 
Send an Instant Message. (See Figure 6-9.)
Receiving an Instant Message
Become alert for the beep (sound) or a pop-up display (also known as toast) 
alert in the lower-right pane of your screen when someone is sending you an 
instant message, as shown in Figure 6-10.
	
✓	To accept the IM invitation, just click on that alert and an IM window 
will open on your screen. You will be able to see the initial message the 
sender typed, and then you can type your response.
	
✓	To decline the IM invitation, you can click the Redirect button, and then 
click Set to Do Not Disturb to show that you are unable to engage at 
this time. You should typically use this feature when your status shows 
you as available, but you are in an unscheduled meeting or an important 
conversation. The new presence status lasts until the beginning of the 
next hour.

Instant Messaging and Unified 
Communications
Unified communications refers to the convergence of all different forms of 
communications — instant messaging; audio-, Web- and videoconferencing; 
presence; e-mail and voicemail; and phone — into a single seamless interface. 
The integration of all modes of communications into a single tool enables you 
to start with an IM conversation and then either 
	
✓	Transition into an audio-video conversation
	
✓	Start sharing an application on your desktop with a colleague 

98
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
There are significant gains in individual productivity and team efficiency 
achieved by using the right mode of communication based on other users’ 
information about
	
✓	Presence
	
✓	Location
	
✓	Calendar information
For example, similar modes of communication are available to you when you 
are on the road — you can use the mobile communicator client or use the 
Web-based communicator client.
The productivity gains are achieved as a result of your ability to see others’ 
presence and only communicate with them when they are available, thus 
reducing the latency in your communications. If you need to speak with Suzy 
and you find that Suzy’s presence shows busy, in a meeting, or in a call, you 
simply tag Suzy and you will be automatically notified with a pop-up alert 
when her status changes to available. You don’t have to keep checking for 
Suzy manually.
If you represent an organization that has implemented the entire unified 
communications solution or are evaluating unified communications 
solutions, the following sections help you take the right steps to reap 
the benefits of all the unified communications features available, not just 
instant messaging.
The following are a few scenarios of when you can take full advantage of the 
unified communications solution that you have implemented or are planning 
to implement so you get the maximum benefits for your investment:
	
✓	Executives and managers are traveling to internal company meetings 
nationally or internationally.
	
✓	Experts are traveling to meet with customers or partners to discuss spe­
cifics of projects or proposals.
	
✓	Training instructors are traveling to deliver training to branch sales 
people or technical engineers.
	
✓	Weekly, monthly, or quarterly audio conference calls are scheduled with 
the use of an external audio bridge from AT&T, Verizon, or other providers.
	
✓	Employees travel within a local region to attend meetings on a weekly, 
monthly, or quarterly basis which may take someone more than an hour 
just in travel time.

99
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
	
Implement these new business processes to save time, effort, and money for 
the company:
	
✓	Eliminate or reduce executive travel: Let their executive assistants 
schedule Web-conferences using Outlook. Give the executives and 
managers good quality Webcams (VGA or HD) and headsets so their 
participation in the Web-conferences will be of the highest quality. Train 
the executives and managers on how to use application sharing, white-
boards, polling, and so forth during the meetings so they are extremely 
effective and have a great experience during their meetings. 
	
	Eliminating one trip in the U.S. alone could result in a savings of $1,000 
to $1,500; eliminating a single international trip could save your com­
pany $3,000 to $10,000. Eliminating one trip could also save the execs a 
day of commute time alone — or more than a day if the trip would have 
been international.
	
✓	Eliminate or reduce experts’ travel: Let the local/regional salesperson 
travel to meet with the customer or partner and have the experts attend 
via a Web-conference and share their presentation/demos. 
	
✓	Eliminate or reduce instructors’ travel: Let instructors deliver training 
via live Web-conference or desktop sharing. A huge advantage of using 
the Web-conference for training delivery is recording. Instructors can 
record the first live training session that they deliver. Afterward, branch 
employees can use the recorded training as reference or for those who 
missed the live session. The time and dollar savings are significant if you 
have several branch locations or deliver a lot of training.
	
✓	Eliminate or reduce audio bridge costs: Convert all externally managed 
audio conference calls to on-premise conference calls delivered through 
the unified communications solution. Savings will vary based on your 
actual usage.
	
✓	Eliminate or reduce employees’ local travel: Convert these meetings to 
Web-conferences or audio conferences hosted on-premise through the 
unified communications solution. Average savings could be 1 to 2 hours 
for each participating employee.
This section focuses on unified communications features other than instant 
messaging: audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing and how organizations can 
effectively use them to eliminate or reduce certain costs:
	
✓	External costs of conferencing and telephony: Use the on-premise uni­
fied communications server based tools to eliminate fees paid to exter­
nal third-party companies.
	
✓	Travel expenses: Up to 40 percent reduction in travel even within the 
same region, where previously employees used an automobile.
	
✓	Time and effort required to make better business decisions: Instant 
access to subject matter experts when needed.

Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
You and your team are ready to launch a new product in the marketplace. As 
the deadline approaches, you are looking for different modes of communica­
tions to stay in touch with the team, customers, and partners. 
Explore the entire set of tools that you have in your unified communications 
toolbox and use the one that makes sense for the type of communication you 
need to have.
Most communicator clients allow you to make several types of audio calls, 
such as computer-to-computer calls or computer-to-phone calls. They also 
allow you to make outbound audio calls and receive calls by using your com­
puter or your traditional phone.
Making audio calls
On the communicator client, always check the availability of your contact 
first and then call. There are several ways to call a contact in communicator:
	
✓	Communicator call: Always try this option first because it will use 
your local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN) and not cost 
anything.
	
✓	Call alternate number: You can click the arrow next to the call button 
to select an alternate phone number to call (for example, mobile) if you 
have been given access.
Receiving audio calls
When someone invites you to an audio call, you get a pop-up alert on the 
lower-right pane of your computer screen. Here are things you can do when 
that happens:
	
✓	You can take the audio call on your computer using the computer’s 
speakers and microphone or using a headset (this is a computer-to-
computer call).
	
✓	If you are in a meeting in a conference room, but this call is critical for 
you to take, simply click redirect to transfer it to your cell phone. Leave 
the room while you answer the call.
	
✓	If you are in a meeting in a conference room and you really don’t need 
to take the call at that time, click redirect to transfer to voicemail or to 
an IM conversation so you can tell the other party that you are busy and 
will follow up later.

101
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Forwarding calls
John is excited about his company’s ad being released in the market. He has 
a meeting scheduled with Suzy to discuss the details about the launch in the 
conference room. Just as he is about to step out for the meeting, he sees a 
pop-up alert for a call from Wilson, a member of the media team, asking for 
clarifications on the ad distribution. John wants to talk to Wilson, but doesn’t 
want to keep Suzy waiting in the conference room. Therefore, John clicks 
the redirect button, forwards Wilson’s call to his mobile phone, and talks to 
Wilson while he is walking to the conference room.
Most communicator clients offer the flexibility of forwarding audio calls to 
	
✓	An alternate phone number, such as 
 
• Mobile phone
 
• Hotel phone
 
• Home phone
	
✓	Your voicemail 
	
✓	Another contact
Making video calls
You can make video calls using your communicator. It is simple as long as 
you either have 
	
✓	A built-in Webcam on your laptop 
	
✓	An external Webcam connected with a USB connector
While answering your call, the contact can see your video feed, even if he 
or she doesn’t have a Webcam. If the contact has a Webcam connected to a 
computer, you can see the video feed for that person in your Conversation 
window.
	
If a Webcam isn’t connected to your computer, you need to set one up by run­
ning the Set Up Audio and Video Wizard. To run the wizard, click Tools, and 
then click Set Up Audio and Video.

102
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Conferencing
IM conversations are designed to support the way you usually communicate 
with others. For example, if John started an IM conversation with Suzy, he 
can easily invite Larry or Wilson or both to the ongoing conversation. When 
John invites a third or fourth person into an IM conversation, John creates an 
ad-hoc conference. Once the conference has started, John can easily escalate 
it to audio and video communication modes, if appropriate.
It would be appropriate to have informal IM, audio, or video conference with 
colleagues and external users (if enabled) when needed.
It’s wise to evaluate Web-conferencing options if you are planning a formal 
presentation or would like to share or demo an application to the audience.
Most Web-conferencing vendors like WebEx, Microsoft, and Citrix allow you 
to download a plug-in so you can schedule your conference calls or Web-
conferences using Outlook’s calendar functions.
Scheduling conference calls or 
Web-conferences using Outlook
This is probably one of the most important features released by unified com­
munications vendors to make you productive while giving you a familiar way 
to do things. You can now use Outlook’s calendar functions to schedule con­
ference calls and Web-conferences.
	
You may even be able to invite external users if permitted by your company 
and allow your customers and partners to join those scheduled conference 
calls or Web-conferences.
To schedule a conference call, follow these steps:
	
1.	Open Outlook and click Conferencing.
	
2.	Choose Schedule a Conference Call to a meeting invitation.
	
3.	In the meeting invitation, enter the names of the participants in the To 
box, enter the subject of the conference call in the Subject box, and 
select the date and time of the call.
	
4.	To assign leader rights to the participants, click the Leader button.
	
5.	Assign access to all the participants by clicking the Access button.
	
6.	Click Send.

103
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
Using Instant Messaging to Improve 
Communications 
Most instant messaging solutions provide the tools and features that help 
you be more productive. IM solutions help you find and connect with people 
from different geographical locations and time zones using the communica­
tions mode that works best for you. Here are ten ways that instant messaging 
and unified communications can streamline your communications and give 
you greater flexibility and control.
	
✓	Presence: 
 
• Tells you if your colleague, John for this example, is available, in a 
meeting, on a call, or even out of the office. 
 
• Allows you to decide how best to contact him. 
	
	Assuming that John is out of the office and his presence status shows 
offline or away, the best way to reach him urgently would be to call him 
using his mobile number. If it isn’t urgent, you can tag John from your 
communicator. When he reaches his destination and connects using 
communicator, you will get an alert that John is available and you can 
start your IM with him. Presence allows you to make the right choice 
and reach John the first time.
	
✓	Customers and partners: If your company has implemented the infra­
structure to enable federation and public IM connectivity, you are now 
able to view the real-time presence of your customers and partners. You 
can decide the best way to contact them and what mode to use. You can 
share the critical proposal or contract with them online and get things 
done faster versus sending it via e-mail and waiting for a response.
	
✓	Desktop sharing: If you are engaged in any critical project or proposal 
discussions, what better way to collaborate and review that project doc­
ument or proposal than using ad-hoc desktop sharing with other people. 
Of course, you will only want to start this ad-hoc session after checking 
everyone’s presence and then asking all of them if they have 15 minutes 
(or whatever amount of time you think you will need).
	
✓	Audio conferences: After you start an IM conversation with one or more 
people, it may get difficult to stay focused if everyone is just typing 
away; you may decide it is better to upgrade to an audio or videoconfer­
ence. Now that you are in the audio conference, you can 
 
• View the list of participants.
 
• Find the active speaker.
 
• Mute and un-mute.
 
• Promote a participant to presenter to share controls. 

104
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
	Sometimes an audio or videoconference allows you to gauge someone’s 
audible reaction or facial expression better than you can through an IM. 
	
✓	VGA and HD Video: If you are delivering training or sales presentations, 
invest in high-definition (HD) or VGA Web cameras. You can deliver a 
richer conversation by sharing video in high definition.
	
	A dual core central processing unit (CPU) and VGA Webcam are 
required for VGA support and a quad core machine and HD camera are 
required to use the HD capabilities.
	
✓	Forward to the team: If your unified communications solution allows, 
while you are away, just forward your calls to your team. 
 
• Team members will see the call being transferred on your behalf in 
the incoming prompt.
 
• You’ll get a notification in e-mail for any call answered by a team 
member. 
	
	Customers or partners who are calling for you will always get someone 
on the first try who can answer their questions while you are unavail­
able. Someone should be available to answer the call even when a few 
people may be busy.
	
✓	Delegates: If your unified communications solution allows, you can 
forward your calls to a delegate who can screen your calls. Delegates 
can take the call, find out who is calling, and consult with you to see 
whether you can take the call before actually transferring the call to you. 
Delegates can add notes to the call history or take other follow-up notes 
when they are consulting with you. You are better informed about the 
call before you answer. Delegates can also originate calls on your behalf, 
and then only transfer to you when appropriate.
	
✓	Integration with your IP desk phone: If your company has upgraded 
your desk phone to an IP phone, you can take advantage of it with the 
integration into your unified communications solution. When you are in 
an audio conversation with one or more persons using your communica­
tor client, you can leverage that IP phone as your audio device. Call con­
trols, including conference, hold, and transfer, are synchronized to give 
you a seamless experience.
	
✓	Voicemail: If your company has integrated your voicemail system into 
the unified communications system, you can access your voicemail from 
 
• The communicator client
 
• Office Outlook
 
• Any regular phone
	
	After you open a voicemail in Outlook, you can return the call directly 
from Outlook because you have the Caller ID information right there.

105
 Chapter 6: Employing Instant Messaging
	
✓	Integrated Web-conferencing: From communicator, select and invite 
multiple people to an ad-hoc Web-conference where you or others can 
 
• Share presentations, spreadsheets, documents
 
• Engage in brainstorming by using white-boards, polling, and so 
forth. 
	
	If the function is enabled, you can even invite customers or partners to 
the ad-hoc Web-conference.

Remote Connections
In This Chapter
▶	Benefits of connecting remotely
▶	Accessing universally on the go
▶	Interacting with voice
You understand the benefits of unified communications and how they 
can help your organization operate more efficiently and boost produc­
tivity. You have grasped the concept of presence and how to leverage pres­
ence information to choose the most appropriate form of communication. 
You know how to use your phone, e-mail, instant messaging, and other tools 
to communicate effectively . . . as long as you are sitting at your desk.
Of course, it’s still nice to establish some healthy boundaries between your 
job and your personal life, so you don’t want remote connectivity to be used 
against you so that you are available 24/7. However, working remotely is on 
the rise for a variety of reasons, and unified communications needs to be able 
to extend beyond the walls of the office to deliver functionality to users no 
matter where they may be working.
In this chapter, I look at the tools and functions that enable you to use unified 
communications anytime and anywhere. You learn about accessing e-mail 
and instant messaging using a Web browser, accessing e-mail and calendar 
functionality from a phone, and using unified communications from mobile 
phones.

108
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Extending the Reach of Unified 
Communications
Whether remote employees are working from a home office, a branch loca­
tion, or sitting in a hotel room or coffee shop with their laptop, they still need 
to be able to communicate with 
	
✓	Team members
	
✓	Managers
	
✓	Other peers within the company
You can’t allow just anyone from the public Internet to access your unified 
communications system, though, and you don’t want to have those servers 
exposed to the public Internet where they may be vulnerable.
The solution is to leave the primary components of the unified communica­
tions platform safely behind a firewall on the internal network, while having 
some sort of public-facing server outside of the internal network to facilitate 
remote connections. Ideally, that server should be in a DMZ (demilitarized 
zone) so that it has a firewall to protect it from unauthorized access (see 
Figure 7-1).
Saving the environment . . . and the bottom line
More and more, organizations are allowing 
employees to work from home offices and 
other remote locations. For some, it is about 
saving the environment; for others, it’s about 
saving a dollar. In either case, it also boosts 
employee morale and generally results in higher 
productivity.
Saving the environment:
	✓	Fewer cars on the road
	✓	Less fuel consumption
	✓	Reduced exhaust and greenhouse emissions
Saving the bottom line:
	✓	Minimal office space required
	✓	Lower electricity and cooling expenses
	✓	Reduced travel and lodging costs
	✓	Fewer pieces of furniture and office equip­
ment required
Implementing unified communications and 
encouraging employees to work remotely 
wherever possible is a great way to save the 
planet and the corporate pocketbook at the 
same time.

Communications between the internal unified communications environ­
ment and external or remote clients are typically protected in some way. For 
example, Microsoft Office Communications Server uses TLS (Transport Layer 
Security) over SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) to protect signaling traffic and 
SRTP (Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol) to encrypt and protect media 
traffic.
I dive deeper into the protocols and methods that the different unified com­
munications platforms use to handle encrypting and protecting communica­
tions traffic in later chapters, particularly Chapter 13.
With unified communications set up to communicate with external or remote 
clients, users outside of the internal network can still leverage the features 
and benefits of unified communications. Whether you are working from 
home, sitting in a local coffee shop, or connecting from a client site around 
the world, as long as you can access the public Internet you can still use all of 
the unified communications features: 
	
✓	E-mail
	
✓	Instant messaging
	
✓	Voice calls
	
✓	Desktop sharing
	
✓	Audio/videoconferencing

110
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Unified Communications on the Go
If you are connecting remotely using your primary computer or laptop, then 
the remote connectivity just discussed will enable you to access and leverage 
the various unified communications functions just as if you were sitting in the 
office connected directly to the network. But, what do you do when you are 
working remotely and you don’t have your computer?
Unified communications provide Web- and mobile phone–enabled tools to 
allow you to access the communications functionality any time and anywhere. 
Depending on the unified communications platform, you may be able to either
	
✓	Access e-mail or instant messaging functions from the Web
	
✓	Provide your mobile phone with software to make use of the unified 
communications functionality
Accessing E-mail via the Web
No matter where you are, the Web is probably nearby. Public libraries pro­
vide PCs for public use that have Web access. Many hotels provide Web-
connected PCs in the lobby for patrons to use. If you are visiting a client or 
partner, you can probably borrow a PC for a while.
Of course, loaner PCs don’t have your e-mail software installed or your e-mail 
account information configured so they won’t necessarily help you see if that 
important message you are expecting has arrived or if there are any urgent 
new messages you should be aware of.
You may already have a Web-based e-mail account through one of the 
consumer-oriented services such as 
	
✓	Yahoo! mail
	
✓	Windows Live mail
	
✓	Google’s Gmail
In fact, in the absence of an enterprise Web-based e-mail solution, many 
users rely on their personal Web-based e-mail to communicate while they are 
working remotely or are disconnected from corporate e-mail resources.
With Web-enabled e-mail such as Microsoft’s Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
(see Figure 7-2), you can access your e-mail from anywhere, anytime as long 
as you have access to a Web-connected device. Platforms such as Microsoft 
Exchange and Lotus Notes provide Web-based options that enable you to 
access and work with your e-mail almost identical to the experience you have 
working with the native e-mail applications.

OWA enables you to access your e-mail, contacts, calendar, and tasks, and 
work with the Exchange Server just as you would from within Outlook.
Communicating with instant 
messages over the Web
Accessing e-mail and contacts and calendar data from the Web is great, but 
sometimes you want to be able to leverage the instant messaging capabilities 
as well. Again, you may already have a personal instant messaging account 
using services such as 
	
✓	Yahoo! Messenger
	
✓	AOL Instant Messenger (AIM)
	
✓	Windows Live Messenger 

112
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
In situations where there is no enterprise Web-based instant messaging solu­
tion, many people use their personal instant messaging accounts to commu­
nicate in a pinch.
Tools such as Microsoft’s Communicator Web Access (CWA) allow you to 
access the instant messaging and some of the other functions of the native 
Microsoft Office Communicator client. One of the biggest benefits of using 
an enterprise tool such as CWA over a personal instant messaging account 
is that you will be able to have access to your same set of contacts that you 
would if you were on your normal PC and you can view the presence informa­
tion for your peers and co-workers.
Unified communications 
from your mobile phone
No matter where you go, there is a good chance you will have your mobile 
phone with you. The mobile phone has become a compulsory item for leav­
ing the house, right up there with keys and wallet. If you are anything like me, 
your mobile phone is with you 24/7. That being the case, what better place to 
provide connectivity with your unified communications platform?
The major unified communications providers such as Avaya, Cisco, and 
Microsoft all provide client software that can run on mobile phone devices. 
For Microsoft, the tool is Microsoft Office Communicator Mobile. It provides 
a mobile version of the Communicator client software so you can access your 
contacts, see their availability via the presence information, and communi­
cate using instant messaging from your mobile phone.
Another cool feature that is provided through mobile devices for some uni­
fied communications platforms is the capability to place calls through the 
enterprise voice system rather than through your mobile phone. This can be 
beneficial if you have limited mobile phone minutes or you need to place an 
international call that might be cost-prohibitive from the mobile phone.
Talking Your Way Through 
Unified Communications
What are you supposed to do if you are traveling for an important meeting 
with a customer and your laptop dies? Or, what if you are on the way from 
your hotel to the customer’s office, but you are running late and you don’t 
have the client’s phone number handy? How can you access your e-mail or 
calendar information?

113
 Chapter 7: Remote Connections
Some unified communications platforms provide the capability to interact 
with the unified communications system using your voice. As long as you 
have access to a phone, you can still get your e-mail, contacts, calendar infor­
mation, and more. Microsoft and Avaya provide this functionality.
Avaya’s one-X Speech enables you to listen to and return voice mail and 
e-mail messages, access contact information, and “click-to-call” to initiate a 
call, schedule or modify appointments on your calendar, manage your tasks, 
and more.
Similarly, Outlook Voice Access (OVA), a feature of Microsoft Exchange 
Server 2007 Unified Messaging, enables you to retrieve e-mail messages and 
interact with e-mail and calendar data using voice-activated or touch-tone 
responses.
Let’s examine some common features and how you can apply them to com­
municate more effectively and improve your productivity:
	
✓	Voice mail messages
	
✓	E-mail messages
	
✓	Calendar information
	
Microsoft enables you to speak voice commands to navigate the menus within 
Unified Messaging using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Although 
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 and Unified Messaging can be configured to 
use languages other than English, the ASR feature is available only in English. 
If you configure Unified Messaging to use a language other than English, you 
will have to interact with the system using touch-tone inputs rather than 
speech recognition.
“Reading” and reviewing e-mail
With a voice interaction system available, you can either
	
✓	Listen to your e-mail messages
	
✓	Reply to messages
	
✓	Forward messages to either
 
• Other users 
 
• An alternate e-mail account
	
✓	Create new e-mail messages

114
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
If you are expecting an important e-mail and don’t have access to your e-mail 
client or the Internet, you can use your mobile phone (or any available 
phone) to dial into the system and retrieve your e-mail by having your mes­
sages read to you by the system.
While the system is reading the e-mail messages to you, you can interact with 
the system using voice commands by saying:
	
✓	“Reply” to reply to the sender of the current e-mail
	
✓	“Reply all” to reply to the sender and all other recipients of the current 
e-mail
	
✓	“Forward” to forward the current e-mail to another user or alternate 
e-mail address
These are the primary commands that are common among systems. 
Depending on the unified communications platform, there may be additional 
options as well.
Listening to e-mail
After dialing into the system and entering any applicable PIN or password 
information to authenticate, you can access your e-mail over the phone. The 
system will begin by reading the subject, time of receipt, and sender informa­
tion from the first unread e-mail message. At that point, you can interact with 
the system to read your messages using the following:
	
✓	“Next message” will stop reading the current e-mail, mark it as read, and 
proceed to read the next unread e-mail message.
	
✓	“Mark unread” stops reading the current e-mail and proceeds to the 
next unread e-mail message, but leaves the preceding e-mail marked as 
unread.
	
✓	“End” tells the system to skip to the end of the current e-mail message 
being read.
	
✓	“Delete” instructs the system to delete the current e-mail message.
	
Although it’s a voice-response system, in most cases you can also interact 
using touch-tone equivalents. If you are ill and can’t speak, or if you are in a 
noisy environment where the background noise interferes with the capability 
to speak with the system, you can simply use the numbers on the phone dial­
ing pad.

115
 Chapter 7: Remote Connections
Responding to e-mail
After you have listened to an e-mail message, you may want to respond. If 
you aren’t already in the e-mail listening mode and there is a particular mes­
sage you need to respond to, you can simply follow the steps for listening to 
e-mail in the preceding section and say “next message” until you get to the 
correct e-mail message. After either listening to the complete message, or 
saying “end” to skip to the end of the e-mail, you can use one of the following 
voice commands to respond:
	
✓	“Reply” allows you to send an e-mail response to the sender of the e-mail 
message you are listening to.
	
✓	“Reply to all” sends your response to the sender of the e-mail, as well as 
all other recipients.
	
✓	“Forward” enables you to forward the e-mail message to a third party or 
alternate e-mail address.
Managing Your Calendar
Voice interaction isn’t just for e-mail. You can also use voice to interact with 
and manage your calendar. You can 
	
✓	Listen to your scheduled appointments
	
✓	Respond to meeting requests
	
✓	Create calendar items
	
✓	Forward events to other users
The voice interaction can be helpful for situations such as getting stuck in 
traffic and needing to notify other meeting attendees that you are running 
late, or when an urgent matter arises and you need to simply clear your cal­
endar of scheduled events for the day.
Checking your calendar
You can dial in to the voice response system and access your calendar to 
check your schedule for today, or any other given day. The system will read 
you the event details from the items scheduled on your calendar. To access 
your calendar, follow these steps:
	
1.	Dial in to the voice system.
	
2.	Enter your PIN to access the system.

116
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
3.	Say “calendar for today” to listen to the calendar items from today’s 
schedule.
	
	 You can also just say “calendar” and the voice interaction system will 
ask you to clarify which day you would like information for.
	
4.	Listen to the details for the events on your schedule.
	
5.	Say “end” to skip to the end of the details for the current event being 
read.
	
6.	Say “next” to move on to the next scheduled event.
“I’m running late”
If you happen to be running late getting to an important meeting and you 
don’t have access to your computer, say, for instance, you are stuck in traf­
fic, you can call into the system and use the voice interaction in Microsoft 
Exchange with Unified Messaging to let the other meeting participants know 
you will be late. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Say “calendar for today.”
	
2.	Listen to the events from your calendar and find the meeting you will 
be late for.
	
3.	Once the system has read the calendar event details, say “I’ll be late.”
	
	 The Unified Messaging automated voice attendant will ask “how later?”
	
4.	Reply with a timeframe such as “15 minutes.”
	
	 The Unified Messaging automated attendant will ask “do you want to 
record a message?”
	
5.	Say “yes” or “no” and record a message explaining your delay if you 
choose.
	
6.	Tell the system to “send it.”
	
	 All meeting participants will receive an e-mail from you notifying them 
that you will be late by 15 minutes.
Canceling a meeting
You can’t cancel someone else’s meeting, but assuming that you are the 
creator or organizer of the meeting, you can use the voice interaction of 

117
 Chapter 7: Remote Connections
Microsoft Exchange with Unified Messaging to cancel the meeting if neces­
sary. After you have dialed in to the voice interaction system, entered your 
PIN, and followed the steps for accessing your calendar and finding the event 
that you would like to cancel, do the following:
	
1.	Say “cancel meeting.”
	
	 The voice interaction system will ask that you confirm that you wish to 
cancel the meeting.
	
2.	Say “yes.”
	
	 The Unified Messaging automated attendant will ask “do you want to 
record a message?”
	
3.	Say “yes” or “no” and record a message explaining the cancellation if 
you choose.
	
4.	Tell the system to “send it.”
	
	 All meeting participants will receive an e-mail from you notifying them 
that you have canceled the meeting, including the explanation or mes­
sage if you chose to record one.
Cancel my meetings
You may have a crisis at work that requires your full attention or perhaps an 
urgent personal matter that will unexpectedly have you out of the office for 
a period of time. In either event, you can use the voice interaction system 
to clear your calendar for the day in one fell swoop rather than having to go 
through and deny or cancel each scheduled event individually. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Access the system and say “calendar for today.”
	
2.	Say “clear my calendar.”
	
	 You can specify the number of days that you wish to clear.
	
3.	The system will ask if you would like to record a message to include 
with the cancellation notices.
	
4.	Say “yes” or “no” and record a message if you choose.
	
5.	Say “send it” to send out notifications to meeting organizers and 
attendees, letting them know that you’re cancelling your meetings.

118
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Managing meeting requests
This task is actually a combination of interacting with both your e-mail and 
your calendar. While you are listening to your e-mail messages, you may 
come across an invitation to attend a scheduled meeting. You can choose 
whether to accept the meeting, and if you accept it the event will be added 
to your calendar, along with the details for the scheduled event. Follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Dial in to the voice interaction system and enter your PIN for access.
	
2.	Say “e-mail” to listen to your e-mail messages.
	
3.	When you receive an e-mail that is a meeting request, you can 
respond with “accept” or “decline.”
 
• If you accept, the event details will be added to your calendar and 
the meeting organizer will be notified.
 
• If you decline, the meeting organizer will be notified but the event 
will not be added to your calendar.
Replying to meeting organizer
If you need to share information or remind a meeting organizer of important 
details to discuss during the event, you can reply to the meeting request to 
send a message to the creator or organizer of the event. Follow these steps:
	
1.	After the system has read the calendar event that you wish to reply to, 
say “more options.”
	
	 One of the additional options is the option to reply to the message.
	
2.	Say “reply” to send a message to the meeting organizer.
	
3.	Record your message.
	
4.	Say “send it” to send a message to the meeting organizer which 
includes the audio message that you just recorded.
Working with contacts
Another function that you take for granted when sitting at your computer and 
may need to access while you’re roaming about is the capability to search 
through your contacts. For example, you may be on vacation enjoying a piña 
colada on the beach and suddenly realize that you forgot to share critical 
information with your manager that she will need for an upcoming client 
meeting.

119
 Chapter 7: Remote Connections
After you dial in to the voice interactive system, you can work with your con­
tacts using the following steps:
	
1.	Say “directory” to access the corporate directory or “contacts” to 
access your personal contacts list.
	
2.	Speak the name of the person you want to contact.
	
	 If more than one person matches the name you are searching for, the 
system will list them for you.
	
3.	Select the appropriate contact from the list.
	
4.	Say “call office” or “call mobile” to call the contact’s office or mobile 
phone number.
The business environment today is more mobile and global in nature than 
ever. Employees who used to sit next to each other in an office now team up 
virtually from home offices and connect on the go from wherever they may 
be. Unified communications provides a variety of features and functions to 
enable you to leverage the communications tools no matter where you are.

Conferencing 
In This Chapter
▶	Exploring the evolution of conferencing
▶	Starting a voice conference call
▶	Joining a voice conference call
▶	Videoconferencing
▶	Web-conferencing
A
 picture is worth a thousand words. In the business world, that often is 
true. This chapter explores how audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing 
evolved and where it is today. I share the options available to you as a corpo­
rate user, and how corporations are taking advantage of conferencing in the 
business. And lastly, I share some best practices when using and leveraging 
conferencing in the business world.
Evolution of Conferencing
A conference call is a telephone call where all parties dial into either a toll-
free number or a toll number. Usually, most companies use a specialized ser­
vice provider like AT&T or Verizon, that maintains the conference bridge and 
provides a toll-free number and PIN codes that participants dial to access the 
meeting or conference call.
	
Sometimes it is called reservationless conferencing.
In this type of conference call, the organizer or leader may request an operator to: 
	
✓	Manage the entry and exit of participants
	
✓	Announce who joined the conference call 
	
✓	Mute and un-mute participants
	
	Provide the capability for some participants to only listen, not speak or 
ask questions. Many companies make announcements to their employ­
ees where participants just listen.

122
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Most desktop phones allow three-way calling or even conference five or six 
people into such a call, but the organizer or leader must call and connect 
each person into the conference call. There aren’t many people using these 
capabilities inherent in their desk phones because the feature is cumbersome 
to manage. 
Many companies will have a conference or speakerphone in a conference 
room. To participate in an audio conference call with other sites or custom­
ers and partners, everyone gathers into the conference room and uses the 
specially designed speakerphone. 
Businesses are using conference calls daily to meet with remote parties, both 
inside and outside of their companies. Common applications are: 
	
✓	Client meetings or sales presentations
	
✓	Project meetings and updates
	
✓	Regular team meetings
	
✓	Training classes and communication with employees in different 
locations 
Conference calling is viewed as a means of cutting travel costs and allowing 
workers to be more productive without going out-of-office for meetings.
Conference calls are used by nearly all publicly traded corporations in the 
U.S. to report their quarterly results. These calls usually allow for questions 
from stock analysts and are called earnings calls. A quarterly conference call 
has a predictable structure:
	
1.	 A disclaimer states that anything said in the duration of the call may be 
a forward-looking statement, and that results may vary significantly.
	
2.	 The CEO, CFO, or Investor Relations officer then reads the company’s 
quarterly report.
	
3.	 The call is opened for questions from analysts.
Conference calling evolved into videoconferencing as companies realized 
the need for video — a picture is worth a thousand words — and vendors 
innovated ways for businesses to use it. A videoconference allows two or 
more locations to interact via two-way video and audio transmissions simul­
taneously. Videoconferencing enables individuals in faraway places to have 
meetings on short notice. Time and money that used to be spent in traveling 
can be used to have short meetings. With the introduction of the Internet 
and VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology, use of the desktop 
videoconferencing has grown significantly. It enables low-cost, face-to-face 
business meetings without leaving your desk, especially for businesses with 
wide-spread offices around the world. Figure 8-1 shows an example of video­
conferencing.

123
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
	
Figure 8-1: 
An example 
of videocon-
ferencing.
	
Knowing that videoconferencing delivers tremendous value in many business 
scenarios, it is still new technology for many employees who may be reluc­
tant during a videoconference.
	
Managers should use the technology in front of their employees to assist their 
employees in overcoming the anxiety. They may even consider practice ses­
sions or rehearsals with employees when an important customer or partner 
videoconference is scheduled. 
As a presenter/leader of a Web-conference, if you are describing or showing 
details of a medical procedure or equipment, then:
	
✓	Use zooming options to focus on the equipment or procedures being 
described.
	
✓	Make your presentation available to the participants for download from 
the Web-conference console.
Many vendors recognized the value that businesses were realizing from the 
use of videoconferencing, and they soon innovated what is now known as 
Web-conferencing. Companies that are the pioneers in the development of 
popular Web-conferencing solutions are NetMeeting (Microsoft), WebEx 
(now part of Cisco), Placeware (now part of Microsoft and called Office Live 
Meeting), and GoToMeeting (Citrix).

124
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Web-conferencing combined the audio and video into a live meeting over the 
Internet, where you can make presentations or product demonstrations. In a 
Web-conference, each participant sits at his or her own computer and is con­
nected to other participants via the Internet. This can be either: 
	
✓	A downloaded application on each attendee’s computer
	
✓	A Web-based application with which the attendees connect to a Web site 
address (URL) to join the conference
A Web-conference can be collaborative, in which the presenter includes poll­
ing and question-and-answer sessions to allow full participation between the 
audience and the presenter. In most cases, the presenter and participants all 
dial into an audio conference call bridge provided by AT&T, Verizon, or other 
provider. There now are Web-conferencing technologies that incorporate the 
use of VoIP technology to allow for truly Web-based communication.
Businesses are using Web-conferencing for sales and marketing presenta­
tions, product demonstrations, and product/project team collaboration — 
and no one needs to travel anywhere. Everyone gets the same view of the 
presentation or data without leaving the comfort of the office. Businesses can 
look forward to significant savings from reduction in travel expenses, reduc­
tion in facilities and office expenses, and reduction or complete elimination 
of the audio conference bridge costs to third-party providers.
Unified communications have consolidated the various forms of audio-, video-, 
and Web-conferencing that business were using into a seamless single inter­
face where the users can decide which mode of communication is the right one 
at that instant. They can easily press a few keys with their mouse and connect 
with their colleagues, customers, and partners. With unified communications 
innovations to use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), businesses can immedi­
ately eliminate traditional telephone-based audio from many Web-conferences, 
converge to the VoIP technology, and thus save a lot of money.
Starting a Voice Conference Call
I assume that you have implemented a unified communications solution that 
allows you to use instant messaging, with the added features of audio-, Web-, 
and videoconferencing. 
When you want to start a voice conference call with one or more people, you 
have options to consider:
	
✓	Is this an ad-hoc conference call with some business urgency so you 
need to do it right now?
	
✓	Is this a conference call that you can schedule ahead of time and give 
everyone advance notice?

125
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
Ad-hoc voice conference calls
The business world has many scenarios in which you need to conduct a 
voice conference call instantly with colleagues and customers or partners. 
Say you are working on a critical project, proposal, forecast, or budget. You 
need to speak with the other participants to get the issues or questions on 
the table, make a quick decision, and then move forward. 
To conduct a quick ad-hoc conference call, follow these steps:
	
1.	From Communicator, find the people you need in this ad-hoc confer­
ence. Check their presence (availability) and hopefully everyone is 
green (available).
	
2.	For multiple participants, hold down the CTRL key and click each 
person you want included in the conference call.
	
3.	Right-click and select Start a Conference Call. You then have an option 
to select Communicator (VoIP) call or start the conference call using 
one of your phone numbers.
	
	 Select Communicator (VoIP) call if you have a headset or if you can use 
your computer’s speakers and microphone. 
	
	 Figure 8-2 shows John calling Larry and Swati into a conference call 
using his communicator.
	
	 The people who have been invited into a conference call receive an alert 
on the lower-right corner of their computer screen that tells them John 
Williams is inviting them to a conference call.

• Join using their Communicator
 
• Select any of their phone numbers that have been published
 
• Set their status to Do Not Disturb if they can’t take the call
	
	 As shown in Figure 8-3, Larry is working from home and selects his home 
number to be used for this conference call.
	
	 Swati decides to join the call from her Communicator client, as shown in 
Figure 8-4.

	 After all participants have connected into the conference call, their pres­
ence status changes to In a Conference and they see conference call con­
trol buttons on their screens, as shown for John in Figure 8-5. 
	
5.	Using these controls, John can choose from the following actions:
 
• Put the conference on hold or end the conference
 
• Mute his line
 
• Invite others to the conference call
 
• Make someone else the leader of the conference call
 
• Mute others or remove them from the conference

While businesses are facing multiple challenges — globalization, maintain­
ing a connected workforce, and increased competition — the perfect way 
to maintain a competitive advantage is to use the unified communications 
audio-, Web-, and videoconferencing tools to enhance the user experience. 
Scheduled voice conference calls
Most unified communications solutions today have integrated with Outlook 
calendars to leverage the calendaring functions in Outlook: checking every­
one’s calendars for the best day and time to meet, creating the invitation, 
sending the invitation, and allowing participants to accept or decline the 
invitation. 
If you are the meeting organizer, you can use Outlook’s calendaring to find 
the best day and time; after sending the invitations, you can track how many 
people have accepted or declined your invitation. The unified communica­
tions audio-conferencing solution will also add the audio bridge number for 
everyone to dial along with a unique conference code for this particular con­
ference. If the organizer wishes, he or she can even add a PIN number 
for each participant to use — especially great if this is a highly confidential 
meeting.
	
Schedule the conference call, if possible, to give participants time to get it on 
their calendars:
	
✓	You will have better participation
	
✓	It will allow everyone to prepare for his or her part in the conference call 
so your results can be stronger.
As shown in Figure 8-6, Outlook now has a button that allows you to Schedule 
a Conference Call. If you click that button, the standard calendar request 
form opens up and allows you to enter the names of participants you want 

128
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
to invite and the subject of the call, and select the day and time that is most 
convenient for all. Outlook has a scheduling assistant function that allows 
you to see when most people in your invitee list are available so you may 
select that day and time.

As Figure 8-7 shows, the Outlook conferencing invitation was altered by the 
unified communications solution — automatically adding an audio bridge 
number for everyone to dial along with a unique Conference ID number. So in 
this case, your unified communications solution server is acting as the audio 
bridge service provider so you don’t have to pay AT&T or Verizon for the 
service.

 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
Sound quality issues
Whether you are using high-quality headsets or your computer speakers and 
microphone, make sure that the equipment you are using doesn’t disrupt the 
conference call. Even if you are using a traditional phone or cellular phone, 
always be careful about the static and external noises. This means, however, 
that any static or disruptive noise that can be picked up through your phone 
line will affect the conference, so you must ensure that you are speaking in a 
quiet environment. 
A few guidelines can prevent sound quality problems:
	
✓	Avoid speakerphones. They pick up background noise.
	
	Speakerphones pick up lots of background noise, and sometimes cause 
“clipping” because of the limitations of the equipment. If you are using a 
speakerphone, try to find one that is “full digital duplex.” This will allow 
all parties to speak at the same time with no clipping. And if no one in 
your room needs to speak, use the Mute button on the phone to prevent 
background noise from disrupting the meeting. When someone needs to 
speak, simply release the Mute.
	
✓	Avoid mobile or cordless phones. They pick up static.
	
	If possible, use a phone with a handset that is hard-wired into the phone 
lines. Be sure to test the working condition of your equipment before an 
important meeting! Cellular or cordless phones are more likely to cause 
static or other distracting noise that they pick up in the airwaves.
	
✓	Turn off call waiting.
	
	Most conference calls are set to play a tone as an announcement of 
a new person entering the conference or someone leaving it. If your 
phone line starts beeping with call waiting, it can be very confusing and 
disrupting to the meeting! Most call-waiting features can be deactivated 
by dialing *70 before dialing into the conference. Check with your local 
phone service provider if you are unsure how to deactivate this function 
on your phone.
	
✓	If a cell phone call is required, find a stationary location where the signal 
is strong.
	
✓	Avoid noisy environments:
 
• If you’re calling from home, close out pets and children.
 
• Don’t bang on your keyboard, shuffle papers, eat, or drink.
 
• At the office, find a quiet room instead of an open cubicle area.

130
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
If you have sound quality problems during a call, try these options:
	
✓	Hang up and dial back in. Generally these sorts of problems clear them­
selves up when the bad connection is terminated.
	
✓	Use the Mute button on your local phone.
	
	This may help isolate the problem. Then only “Un-mute” when you need 
to speak.
	
✓	If the problems still persist, try using another phone.
Joining a Voice Conference Call
So you have been invited to a voice conference call. Figure 8-8 shows the invi­
tation that John sent to invitees.
	
Figure 8-8: 
Outlook 
invitation 
received by 
invitees to a 
conference 
call.
	
First order of business for the recipients is to either accept or decline the 
invitation. 
If you accept the invitation, Outlook automatically adds it to your calendar. 
The organizer will receive your acceptance through Outlook. On the day of 
the conference call, 15 minutes before the actual meeting, you should see a 
pop-up message on your screen reminding you of the meeting. Maybe a few 

131
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
minutes before the actual meeting, you want to open the invitation and look 
at the agenda and the details of how to join the conference call. Prepare for 
your part of the conference call to make it a successful one.
You will have two options to join the audio conference call:
	
✓	You can join using your Communicator client (refer to Figure 8-8), 
meaning that you are using headsets or your computer’s speakers 
and microphone.
	
✓	You can connect using any phone, a landline phone or a cellular phone. 
	
	If you aren’t in front of your computer at that time, you can still join just 
the audio portion of the conference call from your car or from a location 
where you don’t have an Internet connection to use your Communicator 
client.
Videoconferencing
Many business situations require you to consider using videoconferencing, 
especially if this is the first time you are meeting with a customer or partner. 
Instead of a dry conference call, you decide to jazz it up with video.
Videoconferencing can be a simple point-to-point communication between 
two parties in private offices or it may involve multiple locations (multi-
point). It enables you not only to transmit audio and video, but also to share 
documents, presentations, and white-boards.
	
Videoconferencing should be considered when
	
✓	A live conversation is needed.
	
✓	Visual information is an important component of the conversation.
	
✓	The parties of the conversation can’t physically come to the same location.
	
✓	The expense or time of travel is a consideration.
Education
Students and lecturers have a unique opportunity to come together with 
the help of videoconferencing and remove the geographical barriers 
between them. Either one can connect from practically anywhere in the 
world. It is great advantage for smaller schools or training facilities where 
they can share lecturers with other schools and teach classes on French 
or Japanese — with the instructor connecting from France or Japan.

132
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Here are some examples of how videoconferencing can benefit people around 
campus:
	
✓	Students and instructors or guest lecturers can join from anywhere in 
the world. 
	
✓	An instructor who is out of town can still teach a class from another 
location.
	
✓	A faculty member can participate in a Web-conference from a different 
building on the campus.
	
✓	People at the school or university participate in budget, project, or research 
sessions as guests even though they are not physically at the school.
	
✓	Dean of Admission can interview potential student candidates virtually 
so they don’t have to travel the distance to the university. 
	
✓	Students can interview with prospective employers in another city.
Medicine and health
Chapter 3 has the perfect example of how unified communications solu­
tions help this industry. In that example, a hospital in California uses Web-
conferencing to bring radiologists from India and Australia together with 
each other for consultation.
Special cameras that are fitted onto microscopes or endoscopes allow phy­
sicians in one hospital to consult with physicians in another hospital thou­
sands of miles away using videoconferencing or Web-conferencing.
Business
Businesses can use videoconferencing for meetings with colleagues, custom­
ers, and partners across the world, especially using the VoIP technology 
to do it from their desktop computers. If your company has offices located 
around the U.S. or the world, you can benefit greatly by using unified commu­
nications tools to communicate.
	
If your business is new to this mode of communication, consider using it for 
sales presentations, product/project team meetings and collaboration, allow­
ing employees to telecommute and reduce office expenses, meet with custom­
ers and partners remotely, and cut down on travel costs.

133
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
Law
Some court systems now allow videoconferencing for the testimony of indi­
viduals who cannot travel because of illness or physical hardship. Lawyers 
from anywhere in the world consult with other lawyers or clients using vid­
eoconferencing, enabling them to provide their expertise regardless of the 
distance between the individuals.
Media relations
Marketing organizations use videoconferencing to announce product 
launches and provide the public and press an opportunity to ask questions 
from anywhere in the world. 
Journalists can participate in an international press conference from any­
where without leaving their offices or their countries. They just need to sit in 
front of a computer connected to the Internet and ask their questions to the 
speaker.
Government
You may have witnessed the videoconferencing between presidents of the 
U.S. and other countries in the popular television series “24.” The technol­
ogy they are using is the Cisco TelePresence System (see Figure 8-9), which 
allows for a number of people to participate from two different locations. The 
telepresence systems use the ultimate in television-quality cameras and HD 
monitors to deliver the highest quality.

Web-Conferencing
Web-conferencing is used to conduct live meetings, presentations, and 
product demonstrations via the Internet. Presenters or leaders of the Web-
conference and all participants connect from their own computers:
	
✓	Some Web-conferencing solutions ask you to download an application 
that runs locally on your computer.
	
✓	Others allow you to connect using a Web-based version for which no 
download is required. 
WebEx really revolutionized Web-conferencing with their innovative solu­
tions that allow a presenter and participants to use their Webcams to share 
video with everyone and use VoIP for audio communications. WebEx also 
provides audio bridge services for everyone to talk using traditional phones. 
WebEx was subsequently acquired by Cisco and has integrated the Web-
conferencing solution with their instant messaging and presence systems.
Microsoft acquired a company called Placeware that had a similar Web-
conferencing solution and re-created it with a new name: Office Live Meeting. 
When Microsoft announced its unified communications solution, the com­
pany also had integrated Web-conferencing with its instant messaging and 
presence engine to provide a seamless experience for the end user.
Citrix has a similar solution, called GoToMeeting, but the company doesn’t 
have any unified communications solution for instant messaging or presence.
Common features of Web-conferencing
Many features are commonly found in most Web-conferencing solutions:
	
✓	Slide show presentations: 
 
• PowerPoint slides, an Excel spreadsheet, or a Word document is 
presented to the audience.
 
• Markup tools and a remote mouse pointer are used to engage the 
audience while the presenter discusses slide content.
	
✓	Live or Streaming video: Full motion Web cam, digital video camera, or 
multi-media files are pushed to the audience.
	
✓	VoIP: Voice over Internet Protocol real-time audio using headsets or 
computer speakers and built-in microphone.
	
✓	Web tours: URLs, data from forms, cookies, scripts, and session data 
can be pushed to other participants, enabling them to be pushed 
through Web-based logins, clicks, and so forth. 

135
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
	
	This type of feature works well when demonstrating Web sites where 
users can participate, like taking a survey.
	
✓	Meeting Recording: Presentation activity is recorded on a PC, MAC, or 
server side for later viewing and/or distribution.
	
✓	White-boarding with annotation: Allows the presenter and/or attendees 
to either
 
• Highlight or mark items on the slide presentation.
 
• Brainstorm by drawing pictures and writing text notes on a blank 
white-board.
	
✓	Presenters can open up the meeting for Q&A: Participants can type 
their questions and the presenter/moderator can either 
 
• Review the questions and answer them live via audio.
 
• Type the answers for all to read.
	
✓	Polls and surveys: Allows the presenter to conduct questions with mul­
tiple-choice answers directed to the audience.
	
✓	Screen sharing/desktop sharing/application sharing: Participants can 
view anything the presenter currently has shown on the screen. 
	
	Some screen-sharing applications allow for remote desktop control, 
allowing participants to manipulate the presenter’s screen, although this 
isn’t widely used.
Web-conferencing is often sold as a service, hosted on a Web server by the 
vendor. Offerings vary per vendor, but most hosted services provide a cost 
per user per minute model, a monthly flat fee model, and a seat model. Some 
vendors also provide a server side solution which allows the customers to 
host their own Web-conferencing service on their own servers. If your vendor 
provides Web-conferencing running on the same server as the instant mes­
saging and presence capabilities, then you have an advantage of serving 
everything inside your own premises and don’t have to purchase externally 
hosted services. For you to host the Web-conferencing service on your inter­
nal servers, those servers need to be strong enough to handle the additional 
load.
Common uses of Web-conferencing
Here are some ways companies are using Web-conferencing to reduce costs 
while improving user experience:
	
✓	A hospital in California wanted to improve the patient experience when 
patients visited the radiology department. The hospital outsourced the 
radiology to India. When it’s 5 p.m. in California, it’s 5:30 a.m. in India. 
Radiologists in India start their work at 6 a.m. IST, when it is 5:30 p.m. 

136
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
in California — and time for the radiologists in California to go home for 
the day. If a patient’s x-ray or CT scan was taken before 5 p.m. Pacific 
time, the digital image is stored in the Kodak system. If it is urgent, the 
technician in California marks it as such. That alerts the radiologists 
in India to look at the x-rays or CT scan and record their diagnosis. 
During the hours of 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pacific time, the radiologists in India 
are reading the x-rays and CT scans that were taken during the day in 
California and recording their diagnosis in the system. 
	
	If a physician in California needs to consult with the radiologist in India 
or with other physicians anywhere in the world, that doctor can use 
Office Live Meeting to connect everyone in the Web-conference, and 
each person can annotate the x-rays or CT scan displayed on the screen 
and discuss the diagnosis further with the others who are participating 
in the consultation.
	
✓	When I was at Microsoft, my teammates were spread throughout 
the U.S., mostly in each major U.S. city. I was working from the San 
Francisco office. My manager had us meet each month in a budget and 
forecast meeting using Microsoft’s Office Live Meeting. Each of us typi­
cally updated a shared spreadsheet stored on a file-share with our indi­
vidual forecasts and budgets for the quarter. 
	
	We each connected at the designated day and time into the Live Meeting 
from our location or from wherever we were at that time. I may have 
joined from the Microsoft office or my home, and once in a while if 
I was out of town visiting a customer, I would join from the client’s 
office. My manager would open the spreadsheet in the Live Meeting in 
a shared mode and allow each one of us to make changes to it as we 
discussed the upcoming quarter. At the end of the meeting, we had an 
updated budget and forecast for the next quarter for the entire U.S. Our 
manager’s manager and some other managers joined us as guests each 
month to discuss new products coming out from their teams over the 
next quarter. Once in a while, someone from the sales training or tech­
nology planning would join us to train us or ask our opinions about new 
processes or products. Within an hour, we were able to get our shared 
budget and forecast completed for the next quarter regardless of where 
each teammate was located at the time or where our managers were on 
that day.
	
✓	As a unified communications technology architect, I was responsible 
to work with my sales team in the entire Pacific northwest region. 
Sometimes our U.S. salesperson would be visiting customers in Idaho, 
Oregon, or Washington state. I had meetings with Nike, based in 
Portland, Oregon, or Starbucks, based in Seattle, Washington, where 
I had to demonstrate the Microsoft unified communications solution. 
Rather than traveling to Portland or Seattle, I scheduled a Live Meeting 
and invited everyone, including the client, into the Web-conference. At 
the time of the meeting, our salesperson was at the client’s facility and 
connected his laptop to the Microsoft Live Meeting and also connected 
it to the projector in the conference room. Everyone in the room in 

137
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
Portland was looking at the presentation that our salesman had loaded 
in the Live Meeting room, and he presented it for the first 20 to 25 min­
utes. When he turned it over to me, I was able to share my desktop and 
demonstrate the unified communications solution to everyone while 
answering the client’s questions.
	
✓	If your company sells products or services, you can consider using 
the Web-conferencing solutions for “webinars,” where you can invite 
hundreds of customers based on the capacity of the unified communi­
cations solution you are using. You may even use common marketing 
services companies that may assist you in inviting customers in a spe­
cific region who meet certain criteria: manufacturing companies with 
revenue over $50 million, for example. After everyone has joined into 
the Web-conference, you have the opportunity to present anything you 
want using PowerPoint presentations or any other software application 
demonstrated over the Internet and also allow the participants to give 
their opinions when you use the polling or survey capabilities. The par­
ticipants can ask questions by simply typing them in or asking over the 
audio so everyone else can hear their queries. 
	
	Have at least two people from your company: — one to present/demo 
while the other watches the Q&A and answers them, or he or she holds 
questions until the final 10 to 15 minutes for you to answer them. 
	
	It’s always a great idea to have a backup person also.
	
✓	It is common in internal meetings that span geographies for colleagues 
working on projects or products to meet and discuss while looking 
at the same screen and give feedback or review the next phase of the 
product or project. The Web-conferencing solutions allow you to share 
the control of the program with anyone present so it’s a great way to 
collaborate. Anyone can share his or her desktop and show what others 
need to see.
	
✓	If you have deployed Web-conferencing in your company, one use you 
should think about is the internal help-desk that assists employees 
with fixing their problems faster. When an employee calls the help desk 
with a computer-related problem, the help desk can take control of the 
user’s computer, check the problem, and fix it without an actual visit to 
the user’s desk. This allows the help desk to be remote and still fix the 
user’s computer problems faster.
	
✓	If your company provides customer support or services where access­
ing a customer’s computer makes it easier for the support person to fix 
the problem, you can now use the Web-conferencing software to do it. 
First, invite the customer to a Web-conference, and then allow that indi­
vidual to give you control of his or her desktop. Now the technician has 
a easy way to resolve the problem.

138
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Any Web-conferencing solution should allow you to at least do the following: 
	
✓	Team Collaboration: Share documents or desktop and pass control, use 
white-board to brainstorm, take notes during a meeting.
	
✓	Sales Presentations: Customers and partners can join from anywhere 
and you can poll them for their opinion.
	
✓	Lead Generation: Invite new customers to see your products and 
services.
	
✓	On-Line Training: Allows you to train your customers and partners.
	
✓	Recording: Must be able to record your meetings so others can view 
them whenever they have time or they need a refresher.
	
✓	White-boarding: Must be able to open up an electronic white-board and 
allow everyone in the Web-conference to participate and share ideas.
	
✓	Polling and Surveys: Must be able to take polls and surveys with partici­
pants so you can gather their opinion after the meeting and learn valu­
able information about what they liked or disliked about your. product 
or services
Managing Web-Conferencing
Many businesses have been using Web-conferencing to enhance their 
employees’, customers’, and partners’ experiences without worrying 
about the geographical distances between them. They may be using Web-
conferencing solutions from vendors that host the solutions, like 
	
✓	WebEx
	
✓	Microsoft Live Meeting
	
✓	GoToMeeting
These vendors provide the hosted services at reasonable fixed costs for 
your employees based on the number of organizers or seats, and it may cost 
between $15 to $59 per user per month. 
	
Watch for additional costs charged when you go over your fixed minutes.
Now, with the new unified communications solutions that have been intro­
duced by the vendors, you will have a choice of hosting the audio-, Web-, and 
videoconferencing internally on your own servers and manage everything 
yourself. It could be a cost-effective solution for your business if it makes 
sense to host the unified communications servers on-premise. In earlier 

139
 Chapter 8: Conferencing 
chapters, I discussed instant messaging and presence provided through the 
implementation of servers on your premises. If you do that, your unified com­
munications solution may also include audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing 
on the same server. The most cost-effective solution for a business is to 
implement all the communications modes internally and thus eliminate the 
external costs of hosted audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing.
Ad-hoc Web-conference
A hosted Web-conferencing solution, WebEx, shows the different options 
available. When I downloaded the WebEx trial software, it automatically 
added buttons to my Outlook so I could “Start a Meeting Now” or “Schedule a 
Meeting” from Outlook.
To start an ad-hoc Web-conference, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Start Meeting Now button in Outlook.
	
	 As seen in Figure 8-10, the WebEx MeetMeNow window opens and allows 
you to send invitations to the attendees via e-mail, as well as a URL that 
you can give someone over the phone or through an instant message.
	
Figure 8-10:

invites.
	
	
2.	After the attendees have joined in the Web-conference, the leader can 
start sharing the video, a presentation, or any applications running on 
the leader’s desktop.
	
	 The presenter/leader console can be used to control the options and 
even pass control to an attendee if appropriate, to allow for that indi­
vidual to share data with you.

140
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Scheduled Web-conference
I am using a Microsoft Office Live Meeting solution to show you the example 
of how to Schedule a Web conference. Live Meeting has a plug-in to add the 
scheduling buttons to your Outlook so you can “Meet Now” or “Schedule a 
Live Meeting” from Outlook.
To schedule a Web conference, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click the Schedule a Live Meeting button in Outlook.
	
	 An Outlook calendaring form opens that allows you to add the attendees 
you want to invite to the Web-conference.
	
	 Use Outlook’s scheduling assistant to find the best day and time for all 
to attend.
	
2.	Add subject and a location. Because this is a Live Meeting Web-
conference, there is basically no meeting place; participants join from 
their own desks.
	
	 The invitation will have a Join the meeting (LM link [URL]) hot link, an 
audio conferencing phone number, and a unique conference ID that is 
assigned to this conference.
	
	 The invitees receive the invitation and can either accept or decline it. A 
calendar item is added to their calendars if they accept. 
	
3.	On the day of the Web-conference, the presenter and participants join 
by clicking the Join the Meeting hot link; the Live Meeting console is 
loaded on each person’s computer screen. 
	
	 The presenter/leader console can be used to upload content to be 
shared with the participants, including presentations, a program or 
desktop, white-board, poll, Web site, and so forth.
	
	 A presenter can load a PowerPoint presentation, start the audio-video 
options, and even write action items in a shared notepad that everyone 
can use to take notes during the meeting and then save, if needed, as 
minutes of the meeting.

Collaborating and Sharing
In This Chapter
▶	Sharing your desktop
▶	Integrating with Office applications
▶	Collaborating with co-workers and partners
O
ne of the major reasons that businesses are interested in unified com­
munications solutions is because UC provides a platform for collabo­
ration — sharing presentations and applications on your computer with 
co-workers, customers, and partners. Especially in today’s economy, it has 
become even more critical for businesses to find solutions that will reduce 
travel expenses while improving employees’ productivity and efficiencies.
In this chapter, I show you how best to use the UC tools to collaborate and 
share important business aspects.
Sharing Your Desktop
Recently, I purchased a Dell laptop and as soon as I received it, I installed 
Windows 2008 Server operating system. Next, I started installing Office 
Communications Server 2007 R2 to set up my lab on it and soon realized that 
when I installed the operating system, some of the drivers for wireless and 
sound may have been overwritten. They stopped working. I installed new 
drivers from the DVDs, but no luck. I called Dell and was connected with a 
support professional.
The support professional asked me if I would be willing to share my desktop 
with her. I agreed, and then she sent a link that allowed me to share my desk­
top with her. She looked around the laptop and asked if it was okay to install 
some new drivers. She went to the Dell support site and found my laptop 
model and the 64-bit drivers for sound and wireless, plus a few more that she 
thought were appropriate. After installing all the drivers, she rebooted the 
laptop. When I signed back on, my wireless and sound worked fine. I thanked 
her and asked where she was based. She said in Manila, the Philippines.

142
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Here is a great example of the UC tools that allow two or more people to 
share their desktops with each other for trouble-shooting and solving com­
puter issues regardless of where each person is located. Tani from Manila 
solved my problem while I was at my home office.
Collaboration enables employees in a company to work with colleagues, cus­
tomers, and partners using various UC tools: instant messaging; presence; 
audio-, video- and Web-conferencing; and enterprise voice (VoIP).
Users can collaborate with others in two ways:
	
✓	Asynchronous collaboration means that you upload documents into a 
portal (internal or external Web site). Others also upload documents 
to the same portal if given permission to do so. Then each individual is 
allowed to download them for review, edit, and re-upload the updated 
documents to the Web site. Users are doing the activities at their own 
time and no one is interacting with each other in real-time. 
	
	Examples of asynchronous collaboration software include Cisco WebEx 
Connect, Microsoft Office Groove, and Microsoft SharePoint. Say that 
a product team is creating product marketing documents. Each team 
member may create a document and upload it to the portal and allow 
the rest of the team to review it. Each team member can take his or her 
time to review and give feedback to the author. The author’s responsibil­
ity is to then take everyone’s feedback, consolidate it into the document, 
and create the final version. 
	
✓	Synchronous collaboration is real-time during which two or more people 
interact with each other at the same time. The earlier example I cited 
with a Dell support person is an example of synchronous collabora­
tion. Perhaps the most commonly associated form of synchronous col­
laboration is desktop sharing or Web-conferencing using tools such as 
Communicator desktop-sharing, Cisco WebEx Meetings, or Microsoft 
Live Meeting. 
	
	Synchronous or real-time collaboration is becoming a popular form of 
collaboration, especially with tools like WebEx and Microsoft Office Live 
Meeting. The tools have extended their portfolio of features to take the 
place of in-person meetings and still get the same experience — but at a 
lower cost. 
Assuming that you have implemented a UC solution in your company or you 
may be piloting or evaluating UC, you should have instant messaging and 
presence to start with as the basic building block for collaboration. You have 
multiple options of how you actually start sharing your desktop with others.

143
 Chapter 9: Collaborating and Sharing
Ad-hoc sharing of your desktop
You may need to instantly review something you are doing with a colleague 
and get a quick resolution. Here are steps you can follow:
	
1.	 Say John wants Suzy and Larry to review his budget forecast before he 
sends it to the rest of the team. From Communicator, first he checks 
their presence to make sure that they are available, and then sends 
them both an instant message to ask if they have time to join him now to 
review the budget forecast.
	
2.	 After everyone agrees and is in the IM conversation, John clicks on the 
sharing icon to start sharing his desktop, as shown in Figure 9-1. He gets 
a warning that all participants will now be able to see his desktop. John 
clicks OK.
	
Figure 9-1: 
John clicks 
the desktop 
sharing 
icon.
	
	
3.	 Larry and Suzy get an alert to John’s invitation to view the desktop shar­
ing session, as shown in Figure 9-2. They need to accept the invitation to 
see John’s desktop.
	
Figure 9-2: 
Larry gets 
an alert to 
John’s shar-
ing session.
	

144
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
4.	 After Suzy and Larry accept the invitation to the sharing session, they 
see John’s desktop, as shown in Figure 9-3. You can see the budget fore­
cast spreadsheet that John is sharing and that John is in control.
	
Figure 9-3: 
Suzy and 
Larry can 
see John’s 
desktop and 
John is in 
control.
	
	
5.	On John’s screen, he can click on the down-arrow next to In Control: 
John Williams, as shown in Figure 9-4, to open up the options for shar­
ing control. He can share control with all participants or select Larry or 
Suzy to pass control to. Even Suzy or Larry can request control of John’s 
desktop. Of course, John is in control always, so he can deny or take 
control back whenever he wants to.
	
Figure 9-4: 
John can 
share 
control with 
others.
	
	
Only pass control to one person at a time. It could get confusing if multiple 
people are changing your data at the same time.
This example shows it would be very easy to use your instant messaging 
solution to start sharing the desktop on an ad-hoc basis based on other 
people’s presence availability. If you are sharing a spreadsheet (refer to 

145
 Chapter 9: Collaborating and Sharing
Figure 9-3), after the editing is done by all in the collaboration session, the 
spreadsheet can be saved by anyone who has the control — it will be saved 
on John’s computer because he initiated the sharing session.
When you are using desktop sharing or Web-conference, you can initiate the 
session and invite users from your contact list as well invite others via e-mail. 
They don’t even have to have the same UC software. If your company’s UC 
solution allows you to invite external participants, then you can invite them 
to the ad-hoc session.
	
For team collaboration, store the original spreadsheet or document on a 
shared drive or a portal that everyone has access to. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Start the collaboration by opening the document from the shared drive, 
and then allow for all participants to share control.
	
2.	 Each team member takes turn updating the data for his or her region or 
product line.
	
3.	 Everyone reviews the data before saving it again to the same shared 
drive or the portal. 
This scenario works for any team sharing common goals.
Scheduled sharing of your desktop
Most people prefer to schedule a meeting in advance so that it gives them 
and others time to prepare. On a few occasions, you must meet instantly with 
your colleagues to discuss an issue or task that can’t be delayed. 
Obviously, when you deliver training or product/project updates to a team or 
collaboratively meeting for brain-storming with a team, you want to schedule 
a collaborative session. You will find many more reasons to use a scheduled 
session of collaboration where you give everyone advance notice, as well as 
use Outlook’s scheduling assistant to find the best day and time for everyone 
to participate. You may even invite customers and partners, if appropriate 
and this functionality is enabled for you to do so at your company.
Scheduled sharing of the desktop
If the situation permits, it’s always better to schedule a meeting so that 
everyone gets adequate time to prepare for the meeting. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 From Outlook, select Schedule a Live Meeting or Schedule Meeting 
(WebEx) option.

146

2.	 Select the people you want to invite, and then click Scheduling 
Assistant, as shown in Figure 9-5.
	
	 Scheduling Assistant will help you find the best day and time for every­
one to participate. Determining when most people can participate 
ensures a productive meeting.

	 Include a detailed agenda so everyone knows what will be discussed 
during the meeting and whether there will be multiple presenters. 
Including an agenda gets everyone on the same page and emphasizes 
the importance of attendance as well as attention, especially if the meet­
ing will include training.

 Chapter 9: Collaborating and Sharing
	
5.	 When everyone is in the Web-conference, the leader can start by sharing 
his or her desktop. 
	
6.	 After the sharing session starts, the leader will have options to pass con­
trol to another presenter or project/product team members to demon­
strate a part of a document, spreadsheet, or application being developed.
Most Web-conferencing software solutions allow the presenter to share 
either 
	
✓	An entire desktop 
	
✓	A specific application/program running on the desktop
Figure 9-7 shows that presenters can share selected areas of their desktop so 
everyone doesn’t see the entire desktop.
	
Figure 9-7: 
Presenters 
can share 
a selected 
area of their 
desktop.
	
Some desktop sharing solutions allow presenters to push everyone to a 
full-screen view, while other solutions allow the participants to select a full-
screen view on their desktops. Obviously, some participants don’t object to 
be forced into a full-screen view of the presentation but other participants 
may object. As a presenter, it’s important to keep that in mind. 
During the meeting, the presenter can lead everyone into the sharing of a 
program, desktop, a white-board, a poll, a Web site, or a screen snapshot 
based on the need and goal of the meeting.
	
Remove anything on your desktop that you don’t want others to see, or use 
share selected area of your desktop as discussed earlier. If you have any type 
of background scenery or family photos on the desktop, for instance, it may 
be appropriate to remove them before the desktop sharing session. High-
quality graphics, pictures, and background colors take extra bandwidth and 
time to transmit to others’ computers. Such nonessential elements also dis­
tract people from the real reason they were invited into the Web-conference. 

148
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Integrating with Office Applications
There are more than 200 million users of Microsoft Office worldwide. That 
said, wouldn’t it be great if you could share your desktop or collaborate with 
others while you are working in a Word document or Excel spreadsheet? Why 
leave Word or Excel in order to determine presence of colleagues, customers, 
and partners so you can collaborate with them? 
You don’t have to!
Most of the major vendors of UC solutions have integrated presence with 
Office applications; some may even allow you to integrate presence with 
other applications. So now, you can start instant messaging or desktop shar­
ing with others right from Word or Excel.
The UC vendors have taken advantage of a feature built-in to Word and Excel 
called Smart Tags to turn that presence info on for you while you are these 
applications. To be specific, when you hover over someone’s name in Word 
or Excel, that individual’s presence information is high-lighted and you can 
right-click on that person’s name to send an IM or start sharing your desktop 
and collaborate.
Look at the following example.
In Figure 9-8, a Word document is open and looks like a Project Status Report 
prepared by John Williams. It shows that Suzy McNeil and Larry Smith are 
team members for this project. If you are reviewing this document and came 
up with a question or thought that requires you to discuss it with one of 
them, you can put your mouse over John’s name because he is the Project 
Manager for this project. If John’s presence icon shows that he isn’t available, 
then you can hover over Suzy or Larry’s presence icon. Larry’s presence icon 
is green, so he is available.
Now you can right-click on Larry’s presence icon and a whole menu of UC 
options will open up, letting you start an IM or call Larry Smith at his pub­
lished numbers. What a great way to communicate with someone without 
leaving Word, as shown in Figure 9-9.
You can do the same in Excel, PowerPoint, or any other Office application as 
well as in SharePoint. Most times, presence awareness will work out of the 
box. However, the following steps turn it on if it hasn’t been set by default.

How to turn presence awareness on 
in Word or Excel
You can enable presence in Microsoft Word or Excel. Follow these steps:
	
1.	If your Communicator client isn’t running and logged in, start it.
	
2.	From an open Word document or Excel spreadsheet, go to the Office 
button in the upper-left corner. 
	
	 The button is shown in Figure 9-10.

3.	Choose Word Options or Excel Options at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
4.	From the Word Options or Excel Options screen, select Proofing.
	
5.	From the proofing screen, select AutoCorrect options.
	
6.	Click the SmartTags tab. Under Label text with smart tags, check 
Person Name (English) and Person Name (Outlook e-mail recipients), 
as shown in Figure 9-11. Click OK.
	
	 When you hover over anyone’s name in Word, Excel, or other Office 
programs, the individual’s presence icon will light up to indicate actual 
availability.
	
7.	Right-click on the presence icon.
	
	 You will see all the available options to communicate.
Advantages of incorporating 
online presence
Enabling presence in Word or Excel enhances a user’s capability to improve 
collaboration between group members and increase efficiency in business 
processes. By integrating instant messaging and presence information in 
Word, Excel, or a SharePoint site, group members can see who is online and 
instantly know whether they are available for a quick question or brief meet­
ing. Individuals can streamline work processes by immediately notifying team 
members of document or timeline changes or establish group collaborative 
sessions by using instant messaging.

Organizational considerations
It’s important to balance the benefits of increased collaboration among group 
members with the requirements for security and compliance, particularly 
in regard to the deployment of an instant messaging client. Planning for 
presence should include assurance that both internal and external com­
munications to and from the instant messaging client are consistent with 
company-wide policy for security and compliance with regulatory guidelines 
and business practices.
For example, in some highly regulated industries, instant messaging conver­
sations must be retained in accordance with record-keeping requirements for 
electronic communications. Companies that are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley 
regulation must archive instant messaging conversations as a part of their 
records-retention requirements.
Software requirements
Because online presence status is rendered by Office, Office 2003 or later is 
required on all client computers. Additionally, one of the following instant 
messaging clients must be installed on client computers to enable real-time 
communications:
	
✓	Microsoft Windows Live Messenger
	
✓	Microsoft Office Communicator 2005 or newer

152
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Windows Live Messenger users will see online status for their Messenger 
contacts only. If Office Communicator is installed, the end user will see the 
online status for all contacts. 
E-mail account requirements
To display online status, the presence feature uses a Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) address to communicate with the instant messaging client. 
	
Only SIP addresses can take advantage of additional presence features, such as 
	
✓	Sending and receiving e-mail 
	
✓	Displaying free/busy information from the online status indicator
If a SIP address isn’t available, a .NET address (MSN Messenger) or an 
Exchange Instant Messaging address (Windows Messenger) can be config­
ured on an individual basis. 
Collaborating with Co-workers 
and Partners
Unified communications opens up many new ways to work with co-workers, 
customers, and partners, especially with the geographically dispersed work­
force that most companies have. UC provide you with tools for working 
remotely and communicating efficiently and collaboratively.
This section details how you can use the UC features to communicate 
more efficiently with your colleagues and also improve your customer and 
partner satisfaction dramatically. I share the specific steps needed to estab­
lish a collaboration strategy for your internal organization as well the exter­
nal marketplace.
Collaboration means cooperation — people getting together to achieve a 
common goal. It could be between team members who are working on the 
same project, product, strategy, or a marketing campaign — whatever the 
theme is, everyone wants to achieve the same end result. Collaboration 
means everyone is at the same level; there are no leaders or managers, but 
there may be a moderator to keep things moving in a collaborative session.
There are many business scenarios to collaborate with colleagues, custom­
ers, and partners. The best way to achieve effective collaboration is to treat 
everyone as an equal contributor or partner. As a business leader, you may 

153
 Chapter 9: Collaborating and Sharing
want to provide your employees with training and awareness about the best 
ways to collaborate so that they achieve greater results for your company.
That said, sometimes a collaborative meeting in which everyone is treated 
equal can easily get out of control or boring if someone isn’t pushing the 
agenda along and motivating everyone to participate. So you may want to 
think about assigning someone to be a meeting coordinator/moderator to 
keep these meetings interesting, on-target, and productive. 
	
Here are some best practices for collaborative meetings:
	
✓	Assign different team members to be the moderator for each recurring 
meeting. They will send the invitations, create the agenda, and then 
moderate the actual meeting to achieve the goals set out in the agenda. 
They also should be responsible to take meeting minutes and post or 
send them to everyone later.
	
✓	It’s critical for the meeting moderator to keep it on schedule and follow 
the agenda. It’s possible to lose control in collaborative meetings. Keep 
everyone on topic and don’t allow discussions to drag on.
	
✓	Check with all participants at the start of the meeting to see whether 
they are comfortable with the agenda and if a topic needs to be added or 
removed.
	
✓	In a Web-conference, some participants will join remotely and others 
will be in a conference room. Make sure all who join using phones (espe­
cially speakerphones) mute the phones when they aren’t speaking. 
	
✓	Polling or surveys are available in most Web-conferencing software and 
allow you to get a consensus from everyone easily on a topic of discus­
sion. Does everyone feel a particular feature is a must in the product 
even if that moves the delivery date, or can the feature be optional?
	
✓	Use electronic white-boards, available with UC tools, to brainstorm for 
new ideas. Regardless of location, everyone can contribute ideas by 
using annotation tools.
	
✓	Most UC solutions allow you to take notes during the meeting, so the 
moderator or someone else assigned as the scribe should do that to 
keep track of what was discussed, action items, results of polls taken, 
list of documents or items to be shared with everyone, and equally 
important — agenda topics for the next meeting and who will lead it. All 
this information can easily be turned into meeting minutes and shared 
with everyone.
	
✓	People may join the meeting late or have to leave early. That means they 
need to be updated about information discussed during that meeting in 
their absence. One effective way to do this is to publish the meeting min­
utes along with an invitation for the next meeting. 

154
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
Save the shared documents, chat, polling results, whiteboards, and so forth that 
are used during the meeting. Depending on which Web-conferencing software 
you use, you may be reminded before you end the meeting to save everything.
The following are some examples of collaboration in different types of busi­
nesses or professions:
Business
UC tools have revolutionized the ways in which an organization collaborates 
internally and externally. Businesses recognize that instant collaboration 
improves employees productivity and team efficiency that could gain a com­
petitive advantage. The UC solutions that leverage the Internet and VoIP have 
opened up the opportunity for a business to extend it to include key custom­
ers and partners and achieve new forms of collaboration that was unheard 
of five years ago. If you provide any type of customer service or technical 
support for your customers and partners, UC tools provide you the opportu­
nity to improve and make it faster while reducing your costs. Here are some 
scenarios in business for which collaboration tools can be used:
	
✓	Project/product team collaboration, both internally and externally
	
✓	Customer/partner training
	
✓	Customer/partner service or help desk (internal and external)
	
✓	Marketing/sales presentations (Webinars)
	
✓	Budget forecast review meetings
Education
Educational institutions can provide their students and teachers with col­
laborative UC tools that allow the students or teachers to participate from 
anywhere in the world, removing all geographical barriers.
	
✓	UC solutions such as WebEx Training Center allow students to work on 
their own computers while teachers are able to look over their shoul­
ders and assist with trouble-shooting, connected remotely over the 
Internet.
	
✓	As a trainer for the Microsoft UC solutions, I have delivered training for 
learning centers that enable students to connect remotely from any­
where and I deliver my presentations using Live Meeting. Students per­
form their lab exercises remotely, and I have access to look over their 
shoulders and assist them if the need arises. 

155
 Chapter 9: Collaborating and Sharing
	
✓	Microsoft Office Live Meeting service allows a lecturer to start with a 
general topic, and then 30 minutes into the lecture, allow students to 
break out into what is called breakout rooms — different virtual rooms 
where different topics are discussed or different courses are taught — 
simply by clicking a few buttons in the original Web-conference that 
they joined remotely.
Publishing
Any publishing activity would require the collaboration of multiple people at 
the same time to reach consensus and then publish a magazine, a book, or 
a newspaper. Look at some examples how UC tools can be leveraged in the 
publishing industry:
	
✓	A photographer or illustrator and a writer can use the sharing and col­
laboration tools discussed earlier to share ideas. Both WebEx and Live 
Meeting allow sharing of live media during a Web-conference so they can 
run some videos before deciding what parts to use for the final version.
	
✓	Editors, reviewers, photographers, and writers can collaborate on an 
ad-hoc basis or in regularly scheduled sessions to hash out publication 
schedules and action items or review actual material to get to the final 
stages of publication.
	
✓	Authors and their editors or agents can get together remotely and work 
on the outline of the book or an article before the author starts writing. 
The agent may also get involved to hash out the contractual details.
Science
Researchers and scientists are known to be early adopters of technologies 
that further their goals, and UC is not new to them. Many original IM tools 
were widely used in the scientific arena to collaborate and communicate 
with colleagues across the world. It’s possible that the recent advances in 
the UC tools have further advanced the possibilities of collaboration among 
researchers and scientists and brought them together for joint publications 
of articles, research activities, and so on. 
Technology
Innovation of the UC tools discussed throughout this book were the results 
of the engineers and architects of UC actually having them to further their 
advancements. The people at Microsoft, Cisco, and IBM who innovated the 

156
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
tools like instant messaging; audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing; and VoIP 
integration were able to do it faster and cheaper because of access to these 
tools themselves.
I was an early adopter of the UC tools while I was at Microsoft and provided 
the product teams with insight about the use of the tools from a usability 
perspective. It is imperative for a technology company to be able to innovate 
and test its own products organically before they are available to the market­
place, ready for the masses.
For technology companies, it is critical to have instant access to experts 
throughout their organization for customer and partner inquiries as well as 
their own internal needs. For product development, what better way to col­
laborate than having instant access to the whole team, no matter whether 
they are — in India, Australia, China, or Israel. If a software developer needs 
assistance, all he has to do is look at his Communicator and see who is 
online and ping that person instantly. By having UC integrated with VoIP and 
Internet, the cost of reaching someone across the world has become insig­
nificant compared to the investment; no technology companies should keep 
their employees from leveraging these tools today.

▶	Communicating with an all-in-one interface
▶	Examining available client software
▶	Integrating unified communications with applications
O
ne of the Utopian promises of unified communications is to enable 
users to communicate anytime, anywhere, using the most effective and 
efficient means possible at the time, all from a single application or communi­
cations interface. 
	
The goal of unified communiacations is to 
	
✓	Tame the chaos of trying to manage multiple phone numbers, 
e-mail addresses, instant messaging accounts, and other methods of 
communication
	
✓	Help people to be more productive.
All For One, and One For All
Unified communications allows you to use a single application to interface with 
various forms of communication. You can see who is available and determine 
the most appropriate method of contacting that person, and then — with a 
single click — you can either
	
✓	Initiate a phone call, an e-mail, or an instant message.
	
✓	Invite the user to an audio or video conference call.
Ideally, the all-in-one unified communications client should also provide a 
means for you to receive and manage your incoming communications from 
one application:
	
✓	When someone calls, you can answer with the unified communications 
client.

158
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
	
✓	You can view e-mails with a click.
	
✓	If you have voicemail or incoming faxes, your unified communications 
client will notify you and provide a way for you to view and manage 
those communications.
The following sections look at the features you can expect to find in a unified 
communications all-in-one client, and the kinds of functionality they deliver 
to help you communicate more efficiently and be more productive.
Presence
You may have noticed a theme at this point: Presence is a keystone of unified 
communications. Just as many of the original instant messaging clients include 
functionality to let you know who is currently available online, presence in uni­
fied communications lets you see the current status of your contacts.
Unlike the instant messaging client, however, unified communications pres­
ence typically provides more detailed information about the status. Rather 
than simply showing whether someone is online or offline, presence provides 
information such as In a Meeting or On a Call. In addition, presence can be 
tied to your personal calendar so that it automatically modifies your pres­
ence based on the appointments and events you have entered into your 
schedule.
Some unified communications clients also enable you to group users into dif­
ferent categories and filter the level of detail that users can see about your 
presence. For example, you may want casual acquaintances to see you as 
busy while allowing your manager or co-workers to see your actual status 
and communicate with you.
Instant messaging
Instant messaging is the foundation of most unified communications all-in-
one client applications. At first glance, there isn’t much difference between 
the way that an instant messaging client like Windows Live Messenger (see 
Figure 10-1) looks and the way that a unified communications client such as 
Microsoft Office Communicator (see Figure 10-2) looks.
Even some of the functionality is similar. The instant messaging application 
evolved into more of a communications hub than just an instant messaging 
client and was essentially a catalyst in the broader evolution of enterprise 
unified communications and the concept of the all-in-one communications 
interface.

159
 Chapter 10: Single-Click Access
The instant messaging functionality of the unified communications client 
enables users to chat in real time with one another. Some applications can 
invite multiple users to participate in a multi-party group chat session.

to a unified

application.
	
E-mail
E-mail is one of the primary methods of communication used by today’s con­
sumers and enterprises. To be truly all-in-one, the unified communications 
client application should provide a way to interface with e-mail.
Most unified communications client software can initiate an outbound e-mail. 
By clicking a contact within the unified communications application, you can 
choose from the communications methods available to contact an individual. 
Usually, sending an e-mail is one of the choices. 

160

Figure 10-2:

munications

phone 
numbers to 
call.
	
Clicking this option will open up a new e-mail message using your default 
e-mail application and automatically fill in the e-mail address with the infor­
mation for the user you selected. You can then type whatever message you 
need to convey and send the e-mail on its way.
Ideally, an all-in-one unified communications client also enables you to view 
your incoming messages or at least notify you when there’s new e-mail in 
your Inbox. This functionality is necessary for the unified communications 
application to truly be all-in-one. Otherwise, you need to have both the uni­
fied communications client software and your default e-mail client open 
simultaneously in order to see all inbound communications.
Telephony
The other cornerstone of consumer and enterprise communications is the 
traditional voice phone call. The unified communications client software 
must integrate with the voice communications and provide an interface for 
the user to receive phone calls, place outbound phone calls, and listen to 
voicemail messages.
By combining unified communications presence with any other status informa­
tion entered by users (such as a note stating that they are offsite at a client 
meeting or working from a home office), you can decide which of the available 
phone numbers is the best option to reach the user (see Figure 10-3).

161

Figure 10-3: 
Providing

whether to 
take the call 
right now.
	
The unified communications client is usually a softphone or software-based 
telephone that can make and receive voice calls using the computer.
For a computer to be a software-based phone, it must have a means of audio 
input and audio output. In other words, the computer must have a micro­
phone and sound card/speakers so that you can hear the phone call and 
speak to the other party.
A cool function of placing calls through the unified communications client 
software is that you can assign a subject to the call (refer to Figure 10-3) so 
that it has some context and helps the recipient determine if it is a priority to 
discuss right now.
Some unified communications clients, such as Microsoft Office 
Communicator, allow you to place a call directly to a recipient’s voicemail. 
This can be useful if you need to share information that’s best suited for a 
voice call, but you don’t want to interrupt the user to communicate it.
Audio conferencing
Conference calling (multi-party voice calls) has been around for decades. 
Many consumer phone plans can conduct a three-way conversation by essen­
tially patching two separate phone calls from one source together.
Enterprises frequently conduct conference calls of various sorts. They may 
be virtually any meeting involving more than two parties, such as 
	
✓	Project team calls
	
✓	Meetings with customers or partners
	
✓	Shareholder or board of director calls 

162
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
These calls typically involve either
	
✓	Subscribing to some sort of hosted service that manages the conference 
calling capabilities
	
✓	Purchasing expensive equipment to handle conference calling internally
One of the capabilities found in some of the unified communications client 
applications is the capability to select multiple contacts and initiate an audio 
conference call on the spot. The software will dial all of the chosen parties to 
conference them in. You may have the option of either
	
✓	Conducting the audio conference call using the softphone function of 
the unified communications software
	
✓	Having the unified communications system call you back on your desk 
or mobile phone.
Videoconferencing
Videoconferencing is quickly growing in popularity. Although audio 
conferences are a viable option for engaging a group of people in a discus­
sion, sometimes objects need to be seen, such as architectural models 
or product prototypes. It is also beneficial in business dealings to see the 
facial expressions and body language of the partner or customer whom 
you are engaging with.
Videoconferencing also offers a practical replacement for travel. Rather than 
flying executives and salespeople around the world to meet with customers 
face to face, companies can simply conduct those meetings via videoconfer­
ence calls. The face-to-face aspect is maintained without the expense of air­
fare, lodging, rental cars, and meals.
Video calls require 
	
✓	Video camera or Webcam
	
✓	Microphone
	
✓	Sound card
	
✓	Speakers
Desktop sharing
Another aspect of online conferencing and collaboration is the capability to 
share applications or the desktop of a participant’s computer. Whether con­
ducting a one-on-one call, or a multi-party audio or video call, you may wish 

163
 Chapter 10: Single-Click Access
to discuss financial projections on a spreadsheet or collaborate on a presen­
tation for an upcoming client meeting.
Unified communications client applications typically are capable of shar­
ing the desktop of a computer, or sharing select applications or files so that 
other meeting participants can see them on their screens. 
	
Some applications may also provide the capability to designate control to 
allow other parties to either
	
✓	Manipulate the keyboard and mouse.
	
✓	Modify the shared file.
User directory
A function that helps you work more efficiently when using a unified commu­
nications application is the capability to quickly find the people you need to 
communicate with.
Because the unified communications software generally resembles an instant 
messaging client, you may have a list of contacts that you communicate with 
on a regular basis. You can even group them by company, department, proj­
ect, or however else it makes the most sense to you.
You obviously have quick access to the people you add to your contact list. 
But, what about other people in your company who aren’t on your contact 
list? The unified communications software is typically integrated with Active 
Directory or whatever other user directory exists for the unified communica­
tions infrastructure. 
	
That means that you can also quickly search for and contact anyone else in 
the user directory by typing the name, e-mail address, or phone number.
The Microsoft Office Communicator software searches both the back-end 
user directory of the company and the personal contacts stored in your 
Outlook profile. By simply typing “jim,” you can display a list of all names in 
both the Active Directory user data and your Outlook contacts whose first 
or last name begins with “jim.” After you identify the right contact, you can 
right-click and select from all of the available methods of communication and 
then either
	
✓	Send an e-mail.
	
✓	Start an instant messaging session.
	
✓	Place a voice call.

164
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Contact history
The unified communications software should retain a history of the commu­
nications between you and other parties. One of the advantages of an instant 
messaging session or e-mail communication over a voice call is that there’s 
a written record of what was discussed. A voice call could be recorded, of 
course, but even then it doesn’t provide the same degree of functionality that 
you can achieve by searching archived communications using keywords and 
quickly identifying the information you are looking for.
The unified communications system should automatically retain such com­
munications. Many organizations have both
	
✓	A business use for archiving the information
	
✓	A compliance requirement to retain communications data
An all-in-one unified communications application should provide a quick and 
easy way for you to search your previous communications and access previ­
ous conversations.
Unified Communications Clients
Don’t get rid of the phone on your desk or throw away your mobile phone just 
yet. The vision of unified communications and the concept of the all-in-one 
communications interface is grand in scope, but you aren’t quite there yet.
The unified communications interface is useful as a communications hub 
while you are sitting at your computer. However, there may be times when 
you’d rather not have your phone call broadcast over your computer speak­
ers so you’ll use your desk phone instead. There will also be times that you 
are away from your computer and have to rely on your mobile phone to com­
municate. The following sections take a look at the unified communications 
applications available from some of the major unified communications ven­
dors and the functions they currently offer.
Avaya
Avaya has a background as a communications hardware provider. It had 
been in the business of enterprise voice and telephony, evolving to IP-based 
telephony solutions, prior to diving into the unified communications market.

Cisco
Cisco is best known as a provider of networking infrastructure and network 
hardware such as routers and switches. Cisco also provides IP PBX hardware 
and IP telephony equipment. They have expanded the scope of their IP-based 
communications offering to include a complete unified communications suite 
which includes the Cisco Unified CallConnector for Microsoft Windows client 
software.

Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Cisco Unified CallConnector for Microsoft Windows provides an interface for 
making and receiving calls from a Microsoft Windows–based computer. Cisco 
also integrates with Microsoft Windows applications such as Outlook and the 
Internet Explorer Web browser through toolbars.
The software displays presence information for contacts to notify you 
whether contacts are available and to help you determine the most effective 
method of communicating with them. It then lets you initiate a voice call, an 
e-mail, or an instant messaging session with a simple mouse click. Like the 
Avaya One-X software, Cisco Unified CallConnector for Microsoft Windows 
provides software-based access to virtually all of the IP telephony features 
found on desktop phone handsets.
IBM
IBM has a different approach to unified communications. IBM views uni­
fied communications as a software function rather than an extension of IP 
telephony or network infrastructure. With Lotus Sametime, IBM provides a 
unified communications console that delivers a comprehensive variety of 
communications tools from one application.
The Lotus Sametime client (see Figure 10-4) resembles a typical instant mes­
saging application with presence information to let you know the availability 
of your contacts, but diving deeper you will find that it provides much more. 
The Sametime client application also allows you to conduct multi-party chat 
sessions, make and receive VoIP phone calls, conduct video calls, and more.

file transfer, and interoperability with public instant messaging networks.
Microsoft
At first glance, Microsoft Office Communicator looks similar to a stan­
dard instant messaging client. Right-clicking one of the names in your 
Communicator contact list reveals that Communicator is capable of much 
more than just instant messaging, though. Figure 10-5 shows the various 
options available for communicating with this one contact.
Microsoft Communicator displays presence information using color-coded circles. 
	
✓	Green means that a user is available.
	
✓	Yellow means that the user is away or inactive.
	
✓	Red indicates that the user is busy.

Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
Microsoft Communicator integrates with your Outlook calendar and automat­
ically updates your status when you are occupied in meetings or conference 
calls.
With a couple of clicks of Communicator, you can 
	
✓	Do the standard communicating via instant message, voice call, or e-mail. 
	
✓	Share applications or let other contacts share your desktop.
	
✓	Initiate a video call or ad hoc conference call. 
You can assign users or groups to different access levels within Communicator. 
Customers may be able to see only basic presence information, while co-
workers can see your general availability, and you can enable members of your 
team or your managers to see detailed information from your calendar. You 
can also block users so that you appear offline to them.
Communicator lets you tag contacts for status change alerts. When contacts 
that are designated for status change alerts sign on, or sign off, or their pres­
ence status changes in any way, you will receive notification via a pop-up 
Microsoft Communicator Mobile
Microsoft Communicator Mobile provides 
access to virtually all of the same unified commu­
nications functions as Microsoft Communicator, 
but from your mobile phone. With Communicator 
Mobile, you can update your status and view the 
current presence information for your contacts. 
When you make or receive a call on your mobile 
phone, Communicator Mobile automatically 
updates your status to “In a Call” and changes 
the color of your presence to red.
Clicking a name in Communicator Mobile dis­
plays a quick look at the user’s availability for 
the next few hours according to that contact’s 
Outlook calendar and brings up a menu of 
options to select from in order to communicate 
with that user. You can send an instant mes­
sage, initiate an e-mail, or place a call to any 
phone number listed for that contact.
Microsoft Communicator Mobile has some cool 
features:
	✓	You can place a softphone-to-softphone 
call, called a Communicator Call. 
	
	 This feature places a SIP-based (Session 
Initiation Protocol) call between your 
Communicator Mobile and the user’s 
Microsoft Office Communicator client soft­
ware rather than using your mobile phone 
minutes or forcing the user to shift gears or 
stop using the computer in order to answer 
a phone.
	✓	Microsoft Communicator Mobile can be 
configured to allow users to place calls to 
third parties through the enterprise voice 
system. 
	
	 Rather than placing a call directly and 
using up mobile phone minutes or incurring 
expensive roaming or international calling 
charges, you can place the call from the 
corporate VoIP system, which can save the 
company a significant amount of money.

 Chapter 10: Single-Click Access
message and/or sound. You can use this to monitor team member productiv­
ity and see when contacts are online, or to alert you when a contact you need 
to communicate with becomes available.
Integrating with Applications
One of the factors of unified communications that can help you be more 
efficient and productive is how it integrates with the tools and applications 
you rely on. The capability to place a call or send an e-mail by clicking a link 
within an e-mail or Excel spreadsheet saves you from having to copy and 
paste the information or write it down so you can switch to some other appli­
cation to initiate communications.
You may think it seems tedious, bordering on lazy, to nitpick about the 30 
seconds here and 30 seconds there that users might expend in looking up 
phone numbers or contact information the old-fashioned way and switching 
to the appropriate program and communicating. Those 30-second increments 
add up, though. Multiplied many times per day times hundreds or thousands 
of users, those 30 seconds hinder efficiency and impact the bottom line.
A core unified communications protocol is SIP. SIP is similar to HTML (hypertext 
markup language) and provides many of the same capabilities: You can create 
links and leverage SIP connections from within other applications. The following 
sections explain some of the ways that unified communications integrates with 
office productivity and other desktop software applications to provide a seam­
less communications infrastructure that helps users work more efficiently.
Office productivity
Unified communications functionality can be embedded into office productiv­
ity applications such as Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel. Microsoft and 
IBM, approaching unified communications primarily from the software side 
and being the developers of office productivity suites, lead the pack in this 
regard. IBM, in particular, provides integration with its own office suite as 
well as with Microsoft Office applications.
Users can seamlessly transition between unified communications-enabled 
software and initiate communications with users. For example, links can be 
embedded to allow a user to call, e-mail, or instant message the creator of an 
Excel spreadsheet. This functionality may be useful if you have a question 
about calculations contained in a financial projection spreadsheet. Rather 
than switching to a different application to look up the contact info for the 
author and then switching again to your e-mail or instant messaging client or 
picking up the phone to contact the person, you can quickly see if the person 
is available and make contact with just a mouse click.

170
Part II: Applying Unified Communications 
E-mail
E-mail clients such as Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Notes are an integral part 
of unified communications. E-mail is one of the primary forms of communica­
tion used by consumers and enterprises so it makes sense that e-mail would 
occupy a significant role in unified communications.
With unified communications integration, though, e-mail provides new 
facets of communication as well. For example, with Microsoft Office 
Communications Server and Microsoft Outlook, presence information is dis­
played for the contacts that an e-mail is from or to. As you are reading the 
e-mail and have questions you need to clarify or issues you want to discuss, 
you can tell at a glance whether the individual is available (see Figure 10-6). 
The presence info is dynamic. It changes in real time as the individual’s 
status changes. It isn’t a static snapshot of presence at the time the e-mail 
was sent.
	
Figure 10-6: 
Right-

communica-
tion options.
	
Whether they are available or not, you can right-click names to display a 
menu of communication options, including replying by e-mail or instant mes­
sage or placing a call to a contact. For e-mail messages with multiple recipi­
ents, you can, with a single mouse click, either
	
✓	Invite all parties to an instant messaging chat session.
	
✓	Call all parties to join a voice conference call.

171
 Chapter 10: Single-Click Access
Custom solutions
One of the ultimate benefits of software-powered voice and software-based 
unified communications is that they enable developers to create custom solu­
tions that extend the unified communications functionality:
	
✓	Many such applications are available.
	
✓	Other new, innovative solutions are being developed daily.
Here are a few examples:
	
✓	Gold Systems has developed a voice-powered password reset appli­
cation that integrates with Microsoft Office Communication Server. 
Password Reset leverages OCS and extends the functionality to provide 
users with a virtual help desk that is available 24/7. Companies can 
improve efficiency and productivity while cutting costs by implementing 
a solution like this that lets users manage the password reset process 
themselves.
	
✓	Evangelyze Communications’ SmartSuite includes SmartVoIP, 
SmartSearch, and SmartSIP. One that was selected as an Internet 
Telephony Product of the Year for 2008 is SmartChat. Instant messaging 
is a core function of Microsoft Office Communication Server. Evangelyze 
Communications extended that capability to create a click-to-chat appli­
cation that can be embedded within Web sites. With SmartChat, com­
panies can provide a direct means for customers to interact with a help 
desk or customer service center to get their questions answered.

U
nified communications can mean different things to different organiza­
tions. There are a variety of potential components that comprise a uni­
fied communications implementation. Which combination will work for your 
organization is a subjective decision (see Figure 11-1). VoIP and instant mes­
saging are key components in most cases. E-mail, including unified messaging 
which lets users get voicemails as audio file attachments, is another common 
component. But they aren’t mandatory.

176
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Presence (read Chapter 2 for more about Presence) is the tie that binds a 
unified communication implementation. Presence lets you easily identify 
the status and availability of your contacts. Ideally, presence should be inte­
grated throughout the various applications you use so that you can quickly 
identify who is available and initiate communications, no matter what you 
are doing.
The nice thing about the modularity of unified communications components 
is these pieces can be deployed in a phased approach. You can eat the pro­
verbial elephant one bite at a time. This modular approach also enables you 
to spread the cost over a larger period of time, instead of replacing the entire 
communications infrastructure all at once. In this chapter, we will take a look 
at some of the approaches you can take to build a unified communications 
environment starting with what you already have. We will also talk about why 
it is still important to have a plan and an ultimate goal in mind even when 
approaching unified communications one step at a time.
	
The modularity of unified communications is beneficial for organizations that 
have an existing investment in some of the components, but want to expand 
the functionality and integrate with other components to achieve unified com­
munications. Leveraging existing hardware and software makes the overall 
solution more cost-effective. 
Another advantage of being able to approach unified communications in 
phases is that installing many new technologies simultaneously makes them 
more complicated to troubleshoot and tune. If you deploy a variety of new 
hardware and software technologies simultaneously, it is difficult to deter­
mine which new device or application is the root of the problem. The phased 
implementation allows time to ensure that one component is functioning 
properly before moving on to the next one. 
Assessing Where You Are
While unified communications is modular enough that you can implement it 
in whatever combination or order works best for you, you still have to deter­
mine what combination or order works best for you.
Before you start making decisions and laying out plans for your unified com­
munications project, consider the following:
	
✓	What have you got? You should begin by compiling a list of the equip­
ment and capabilities you already have as it relates to unified communi­
cations. Assess assets like:
 
• PBX / IP-PBX
 
• Desk phones

177
 Chapter 11: Eat the Elephant One Bite at a Time
 
• Email server
 
• Instant messaging
 
• Audio conferencing
 
• Videoconferencing
 
• Voice service provider
 
• Server hardware and software
 
• Desktop PC hardware and software
 
• Mobile devices
	
✓	What do you want? Why are you considering unified communications? 
Determine which features or capabilities are important to you and make 
a prioritized list of the unified communications components you would 
like to implement. This list can help get you started:
 
• Presence
 
• VoIP
 
• Email
 
• Instant messaging
 
• IP desk phones
 
• Soft phones
 
• Unified messaging
 
• Audio conferencing
 
• Videoconferencing
 
• SIP trunking
 
• Mobile unified communications client
 
• Single-number communications 
	
✓	How will what you want impact what you’ve got? If you already have a 
reliable voice system and you want to integrate it with e-mail to provide 
unified messaging, how will that impact productivity? Compare what 
you have and what you want to determine where they overlap and inter­
sect, so you can develop an efficient implementation plan that minimizes 
the disruption of normal business.
Starting From Where You Are
The following scenarios explore how you can leverage your existing invest­
ment in hardware and software and incorporate additional technologies to 
build a unified communications infrastructure. We’ll analyze situations starting 

178
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
with e-mail as a base, adding VoIP to an existing unified communications foun­
dation, and building on VoIP to expand to a fully functional unified communica­
tions environment. 
Building on E-mail
Let’s start by looking at a scenario where you have an e-mail platform you 
like, and you want to build on that to begin implementing a unified communi­
cations infrastructure. The current situation is
	
✓	Small company
	
✓	Using Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 for e-mail
	
✓	Not very technologically advanced and does not have an extensive net­
work infrastructure
	
✓	Employees rely on Microsoft Outlook as the client software for e-mail, 
contacts, and calendar scheduling.
	
✓	Phone system is a traditional analog POTS (plain old telephone system).
How can you use the hardware and software you already have, and begin to 
build toward a unified communications platform at the same time? 
Because you already have Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, an obvious place 
to start is by adding the Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 Unified Messaging 
role to the Exchange server. Unified Messaging combines all messaging types 
into a single storage space. 
This one-stop shopping for communications is a big step in the right direc­
tion toward realizing the promise of unified communications. Rather than 
checking e-mail in one place and voicemail in another, and picking up faxes in 
a third, all these messages are delivered to the Exchange Inbox, and they can 
all be retrieved from the Outlook client software.
This functionality is even more important when you consider that it opens 
the potential for users to be able to get their communications anytime and 
anywhere (Chapter 7 covers using unified communications remotely). 
Combined with Outlook Web Access (OWA) or Exchange ActiveSync delivery 
to mobile devices, Unified Messaging lets users retrieve voicemails and faxes 
from 
	
✓	Any computer connected to the Web
	
✓	Any e-mail-capable mobile device

179
 Chapter 11: Eat the Elephant One Bite at a Time
Exchange Server 2007 with Unified Messaging also provides Outlook Voice 
Access (see Figure 11-2). Outlook Voice Access is an interactive voice 
response system that works with Outlook. Users can 
	
✓	Hear their e-mails over the phone.
	
✓	Check calendars.
	
✓	Reschedule appointments using any phone in the world.

nications

Installing Unified Messaging
Unified Messaging requires Microsoft Exchange Server 2007. Before install­
ing the Unified Messaging role, you should ensure that the Exchange Server 
is upgraded to Service Pack 1 (SP1). Service Pack 1 adds a number of new 
features and capabilities to Exchange Server 2007, many of which expand the 
functionality of Unified Messaging and provide a more robust unified commu­
nications environment. 
After you have verified that Exchange Server 2007 SP1 is applied, check your 
Exchange Server 2007 server to see which roles are active, and whether 
the Unified Messaging role is already present, by using the Exchange 
Management Shell. Type the following to display the server’s roles:
c:\ Exchange> get-exchangeserver <servername> | FL
The Exchange Server can operate multiple roles as long as the physical 
server has the resources to manage the load (such as processing power, 
memory, and storage space).

180
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
To add the Unified Messaging role to an existing Exchange Server 2007 
system, navigate to the bin directory of the Microsoft Exchange installation 
(typically found at %programfiles%\Microsoft\Exchange Server) and 
run Setup.cmd from a Command Prompt. You can also modify the Exchange 
Server installation through the Control Panel. 
	
You can get more detailed instructions from this Microsoft TechNet article: 
How to Modify an Exchange Installation.
Giving unified communications a voice
Now let’s consider another example. This time you have some unified com­
munications foundation and want to add voice communications. 
This is the current situation:
	
✓	Using Microsoft Exchange Server
	
✓	Using Microsoft Office Communications Server for
 
• Instant messaging
 
• Online conferencing
 
• Presence
	
✓	Implemented Unified Messaging on Exchange Server
	
✓	Traditional analog PBX phone system
The existing voice system, an old-fashioned analog PBX, is not integrated into 
the Microsoft unified communications infrastructure. To connect the analog 
PBX to the existing environment, you must deploy an OCS 2007 Mediation 
Server and install an analog gateway that is certified to work with Microsoft 
Office Communications Server.
Mediating Between Protocols
The Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 Mediation Server role is 
designed to mediate between the various voice and VoIP protocols used by 
PBX and IP PBX platforms and the Microsoft Office Communications Server. 
The Mediation Server is able to convert PSTN (public switched telephone 
network), TDM (time division multiplexed), and SIP (session initiation pro­
tocol) protocols from the gateway into the SIP over MTLS (mutual transport 
layer service) protocol that OCS 2007 uses.

181
 Chapter 11: Eat the Elephant One Bite at a Time
There are some additional considerations to keep in mind when integrating 
analog voice with the existing Microsoft Unified Communications environment:
	
✓	The number of DID (direct inbound dial) numbers that can be assigned 
in OCS 2007 will be limited by the number of actual analog lines coming 
from the PBX. 
	
✓	Caller ID info will not be communicated in most cases; neither the called 
nor calling party information will be transmitted to OCS.
There are other issues as well between OCS and the use of the available 
analog lines. It may not be possible to designate which analog line should 
be used for which outbound calls. This can also impact inbound calls in that 
calls coming in to a designated analog line may ring busy to the caller even 
though the individual being called is actually available. Some gateways have 
additional functionality to accommodate these issues. 
Taking these issues into consideration, adding the Mediation Server 
and an appropriate analog gateway to the existing Microsoft Unified 
Communications environment allows this organization to incorporate voice 
into their unified communications and expand their unified communications 
functionality.
Integrating existing VoIP with Microsoft 
Unified Communications
For this scenario, assume that you have an existing Voice over IP (VoIP) envi­
ronment for voice communications, but lack the other components of unified 
communications. The initial situation looks like:
	
✓	VoIP solution already in place
	
✓	Email platform already in place
The approach for this organization is largely a matter of business needs or 
personal preference. To begin with, the organization should look at the avail­
able unified communications components and decide what they ultimately 
want to have in place. They should look at what the various unified commu­
nications components have to offer and how they will improve efficiency or 
impact business processes.
You have a solution in place for email, even if it is not Microsoft Exchange / 
Outlook. You could take the approach of installing Microsoft Exchange Server 
2007 and Unified Messaging to integrate with the current VoIP infrastructure. 

182
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
However, because you already have a functional email system, perhaps you 
would gain more benefit from starting with Microsoft Office Communications 
Server 2007. OCS 2007 will provide instant messaging capabilities and 
Presence. If it is integrated with the VoIP infrastructure, users will be able to 
also make and receive phone calls from their computer using Microsoft Office 
Communicator. 
Regardless of the approach you take, you can benefit from the modularity of 
unified communications. Whichever component you start with, you can take 
the time to integrate it and ensure it is running smoothly before moving on 
to the next one. You can spread out the investment in new technology, and 
adopt unified communications at a comfortable pace that enhances, rather 
than hinders, business productivity.
Measure Twice, Cut Once
As you embark on building a unified communications environment, plan care­
fully before sawing or cutting so you don’t mess it up and have to start all over. 
Regardless of the existing hardware and software in place, how many users 
are involved, or how many sites the organization has, there are some basic 
principles behind every successful migration. 
Begin with the end in mind
Your unified communications implementation plan should begin with the big 
picture or ultimate goal in mind. While it might be possible to simply add one 
piece at a time and see how it goes, your options may become more limited 
with each component you add. You may end up venturing down a path that 
forces you into design decisions or causes you to have to start over.
Taking an ad hoc approach can be both costly and frustrating. Some hard­
ware and software components work well together. Some don’t. Without a 
long-term vision to work toward, a decision early in the process to go with 
a specific vendor or solution may preclude you from being able to explore 
options at later stages that might benefit your unified communications infra­
structure.
Aside from the compatibility and integration of the various unified commu­
nications components, you also have to consider the network and domain 
infrastructure. You have to ensure, as you proceed through each phase, that 
the Active Directory structure and network domains are constructed in a way 
that will work efficiently for the final unified communications result.

183
 Chapter 11: Eat the Elephant One Bite at a Time
Implement sufficient capacity
Unified communications is not very forgiving when it comes to server pro­
cessing power and network bandwidth. Streaming audio and video are 
resource intensive. Audio and video quality can suffer greatly if packets are 
delayed by even a millisecond. 
	
✓	When you are rolling out one piece of the unified communications infra­
structure, or if you are just conducting a test of a unified communica­
tions technology, a given server and network architecture might work. 
	
✓	However, as users are added to the unified communications infrastruc­
ture server and network, capacity can quickly be overwhelmed. 
You don’t have to deploy all of the hardware at once, but you should project 
capacity based on 
	
✓	The total number of users
	
✓	The expected bandwidth 
	
If you architect a solution without sufficient server horsepower and network 
bandwidth, the communications quality will be unacceptable and the unified 
communications project will fail. 
Develop redundancy or failure
Communications are a critical function for most organizations. As you merge 
all of the communications for the organization into one infrastructure, if that 
infrastructure fails in any way communications will fail as well. 
For a complete unified communications environment that can mean losing 
email, voice communications, instant messaging, audio and video conferenc­
ing, and more, all in one fell swoop. 
	
When relying on hardware and software for voice communications, a loss of 
power can make it impossible to call for emergency services, such as 911. 
For both business and safety reasons, you should consider the disaster 
recovery and business continuity scenarios that might impact your unified 
communications and make sure that you have adequate redundancy or fail­
ure options in place. At the very least, policies and procedures should be 
documented to provide instruction for how to communicate if the unified 
communications infrastructure is unavailable.

184
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Consider future expansion
Architecting, planning, and implementing a well-designed unified communica­
tions environment can be very gratifying and yield significant benefits for the 
organization. But the glory may be short lived if the unified communications 
platform can not be grown or extended to meet demand.
If the business is successful, it will grow. Employees will be added. Perhaps 
remote or branch office locations will be established. The company may 
even acquire competitors and other smaller entities. All of these events will 
require that the unified communications environment be flexible enough to 
grow with the business and that additional users and capacity can be added 
on the fly.
Keep in mind how much the unified communications environment can be 
customized or extended. One of the benefits of software-powered voice and 
unified communications is the ability to design custom solutions that enable 
communications to fit the business process rather than the business process 
being confined to what the communications system is capable of. 
Not all unified communications platforms are created equally when it comes 
to extendibility. Some are more proprietary and limited. Make sure you 
understand the limitations of the design decisions you make and that the 
unified communications system you build is capable of meeting the needs of 
your business. 
Start with a pilot test
Start with a small sampling of users for a pilot test, rather than just diving 
into the deep end, especially when you’re dealing with something that could 
potentially affect all communications.
The pilot group should be representative of the organization. There should 
be members of the pilot group from various departments throughout the 
company to make sure that the test encompasses as many of the regu­
lar functions and processes necessary to conduct business as possible. 
Feedback should be collected from the pilot group, and modifications made 
to the overall plan and architecture to address any serious concerns that are 
discovered.
Assuming that any initial pilot test is successful, the pilot implementation 
should not have to be replaced. It should be built on to expand the imple­
mentation to fit the needs of the organization rather than just the pilot group. 
That requires considering other factors, such as sites, domain architecture, 
and network architecture as a part of the initial pilot test.

M
ost businesses have a network that is used to connect users’ comput­
ers to the corporate servers and other peripheral devices, such as 
printers and fax machines. This network is called a data network because all 
the data is transported over this network. The geniuses at technology compa­
nies like Cisco and Microsoft figured out they can also use this data network 
to transport voice and conduct audio and video conversation. In the context 
of unified communications, some vendors call it Enterprise Voice when they 
use software to transport Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP):
	
✓	It integrates audio and video conversations with 
 
• Traditional e-mail
 
• Calendaring
 
• Instant messaging
 
• Conferencing
	
✓	End-users experience a seamless desktop client to take advantage of all 
the unified communications tools.
	
✓	Administrators have simple management tasks through the use of a 
single management console.
As a business decision maker, you derive new benefits when you integrate 
your voice needs with your other unified communications needs like IM, 
presence, and conferencing. You leverage the investment you made in the 
data network and see it extended to your audio and video conversations 
and substantially reduce your company’s long-distance and cellular phone 
charges.

Translation Service
The technology geniuses who work with telephony realized that people like 
to dial internal numbers and external numbers in different ways. For exam­
ple, some companies’ users dial five digits to reach someone internal while 
other companies use four digits. To dial external numbers, some companies 
require first dialing a 9 to reach an outside line; others dial 8 or nothing at 
all. All these methods of dialing needed to be standardized according to the 
telephony geniuses, who came up with a standard that is called E.164. E.164 
format in the U.S. would look like +13125551212 if you were dialing a local 
Chicago number with area code 312 and 555-1212 as the local number.

 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
Unified communications servers that provide you the Enterprise Voice capa­
bility from the same desktop client need to also adhere to the E.164 standard 
so calls go to the correct destination. The software geniuses who designed 
these unified communications servers call it the Translation Service (TS); it 
translates a dialed number into the E.164 format. 
The TS needs to know 
	
✓	Where the user is actually located — like Chicago, Singapore, or London.
	
	This is called a location profile. 
	
✓	What to do if someone dials 
 
• A three-digit number such as 911, 411, or 511. 
 
• A four-digit number (internal extension)
 
• A seven-digit number (local number)
 
• A ten-digit number (long-distance)
	
	In each case, the service needs to know how to translate the number to 
the E.164 format. 
These translation rules defined by the administrator are called normalization 
rules, and the process of translating is known as normalization. Location pro­
file and normalization rules are discussed later in this chapter.
All the dialing is done through the communicator client after the end-user 
has been enabled for Enterprise Voice.
	
In different countries or localities, gateways or Private Branch Exchanges 
(PBXs) may not support the E.164 format. In such cases, the administrator 
must define the format to be used by the TS.
Inbound Routing
After enabled for unified communications, John Williams can use his 
Communicator client to forward all calls he receives to his mobile or home 
phone or his voice mail. Each user who is enabled for Enterprise Voice in a 
company can do the same. When administrators install the unified communi­
cations server in your company, the Inbound Routing component is installed 
automatically; its job is to handle the incoming calls and route them to the 
correct destination based on the user’s preference. 
If your company also has installed Exchange 2007 server with its Unified 
Messaging component, then the voice mails are routed to the UM server that 
is installed at your company.

188
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Outbound Routing 
If John Williams uses his Communicator client and calls Suzy or Larry, who 
are part of his own company, the calls need to be handed to the company’s 
Private Branch Exchange (PBX). If John dials an external number, it needs to 
be routed to the external Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). 
When administrators install the unified communications server in your com­
pany, the Outbound Routing component is installed automatically and routes 
calls to the PBX or the PSTN. Before actually routing a call to the PSTN, 
Outbound Routing also determines if the user is authorized to make this call; 
some users may be enabled for long distance, and some may not be. 
Depending on where the call is going, administrators may define least-cost 
routes so the call charges are minimized. You must make sure that the net­
work or telephony administrators duplicate your existing PBX routing logic.
Exchange UM Routing component
Some companies may have installed Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging to 
enable their users to receive their voice mail or fax transmissions in the 
Outlook mailbox. 
If you have that case, then when John receives a call and doesn’t answer it, 
UM Routing will route the call to the UM server.
PSTN Integration component
When John receives a call from an external source, the call comes on the 
PSTN. The PSTN hands the call off to the PBX that typically would route it 
to the actual user’s phone. That was before Enterprise Voice implementa­
tion. Now, with your Enterprise Voice implementation, the call needs to go 
to John’s Communicator client and alert him. Similarly, when John uses his 
Communicator to call an external number, it needs to be handed off to the 
PSTN to route to the right destination. 
PSTN Integration seamlessly manages the integration between these two 
environments without the user knowing what is going on. 
Some companies may need to employ a media gateway for all the translations 
to work correctly; those scenarios are covered later.

189
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
Address Book Service
Each time a user makes a call using the Communicator client, a global 
directory of addresses is used to retrieve the called user’s information. 
Typically, this address book would be the corporate address book called 
Active Directory. The software geniuses figured out that it would be more 
efficient if each user’s copy of the corporate directory had only the specific 
information that each user needed, like phone numbers. 
Address Book Service creates this copy every night, and then stores it 
somewhere so all Communicator users can easily download it to their own 
computers. After a copy is downloaded to a user’s computer, it takes only 
mini-seconds for the Communicator to find the right information about a user 
for the call to be made.
Private Branch Exchanges (PBX)
The PBX is a telephone exchange that makes connections among the internal 
telephones of your organization and also connects your organization to the 
PSTN that your company has deployed. Your telephony or network expert 
can confirm for you whether your PBX is based on Time-Division Multiplexing 
(TDM) or Internet Protocol (IP).
IP PBXs were developed in the 1990s with the realization that existing data 
networks can be used for transporting voice — Voice over Internet Protocol 
(VoIP) — and thus reducing the costs of long-distance calls traveling over 
phone lines. Cisco is a pioneer in developing the IP PBXs and is considered a 
leader in that technology.
Some IP PBXs support Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) directly without an 
intermediate media gateway. All of the unified communications solution pro­
viders have designed their unified communications servers to use SIP for the 
transport of all IMs, presence, and conferencing data.
Direct SIP or SIP trunking enables your enterprise to connect your voice 
network to a third-party service provider that offers PSTN origination and 
termination. Doing so eliminates the needs of any IP PSTN gateways in your 
environment.

190
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
For the configuration of your unified communications voice components, it 
is critical for you to know whether your company has an old TDM PBX or an 
IP PBX. The easiest way to find out which one you have is to look under the 
desk and see if your phone is connected to the telephone network via 
	
✓	Traditional phone cable (RJ11) for TDM PBX
	
✓	Network cable (Ethernet) for IP PBX
If your company has a TDM-based PBX, to enable the Enterprise Voice fea­
tures in your unified communications solution, you need to use a media gate­
way that converts the TDM to SIP. Media gateways are discussed later in this 
chapter.
Engaging the traditional 
voice administrators
Any project for which you enable new technologies that integrate software 
applications with hardware infrastructure like telephony system always 
requires a team of people with knowledge and expertise in both to collabo­
rate with each other for successful deployment. I highly recommend that you 
assemble a team composed of people from both the software applications 
side and the hardware infrastructure (telephony) side.
Later in this chapter, I discuss dialing plans, normalization rules, and more, 
all of which are required components for you to gain the benefits from imple­
menting your unified communications solution. It is mission critical that 
those components are implemented correctly and work as required for your 
business to get the best user experience while saving money for the com­
pany. To achieve that end goal, you must collaborate with your traditional 
PBX administrators.
Another advantage of working with the PBX admin team is to enable them 
to clearly understand the company’s goals and benefits that the new unified 
communications solution will achieve.
Your company may have already implemented least-cost routing, hunt 
groups, dialing rules, and so forth, in your existing PBX environment — func­
tions that you don’t want to throw out but instead, preserve and duplicate 
them in the new unified communications environment. So getting the inti­
mate knowledge and expertise that your existing PBX team has about how 
your company’s telephony system operates is absolutely essential.
	
Include the PBX team as part of your overall project team for the implementa­
tion of the voice components of the unified communications solution.

191
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
Interoperability between your existing PBX and PSTN with the unified commu­
nications solution presents a number of challenges that need to be overcome 
so users have a seamless experience and will continue to reap the benefits.
Challenges in PSTN Integration
PSTNs only support TDM protocol, while most unified communications solu­
tions require the use of SIP. Once again, the technology geniuses of the uni­
fied communications industry sort of came together and agreed that SIP is 
the standard for IM, presence, and conferencing. 
Unified communications solution designers also decided to protect your 
investments in their products by providing adequate security during the sig­
naling and transmission of voice media.
To overcome the above challenges, the unified communications vendors 
came up with unique solutions. 
Mediation Server
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 is one of the leading unified 
communications solutions available. The product designers came up with a 
new component called the Mediation Server to deliver signaling and media 
translation. A Mediation Server connects the Communications Server to 
a PBX.
If your company is using a legacy PBX (TDM protocol only), then you will 
need a converter or media gateway to convert that TDM signal to SIP. A typi­
cal organization may need multiple gateway–Mediation Server combinations, 
depending on the number of office locations, the number and distribution of 
Enterprise Voice users, network traffic, and performance requirements. See 
Figure 12-2.
Media gateways
A media gateway sits between the Mediation Server and the TDM PBX; it con­
verts the TDM signal into SIP. There are three types of media gateways (see 
Figure 12-3):
	
✓	Basic Media Gateway provides only the gateway functions and requires 
you to have a separate server box to install the Mediation server on.
	
✓	Hybrid Media Gateway provides a way to collocate the gateway and a 
Mediation server on the same server box.
	
✓	Advanced Media Gateway provides a way to incorporate the Mediation 
server logic on the same mother board as the gateway.

The number, size, and location of media gateways will be the most impor­
tant and potentially costly decision your team must make for deploying 
Enterprise Voice infrastructure in your environment. The main questions to 
answer are:
	
✓	What type of gateway should you deploy?
	
✓	How many media gateways are needed? 
	
	The answer depends at least in part on the size of the gateways and 
where you plan to deploy them.
	
✓	What size should the gateways be? 
	
	The answer depends in part on how many you plan to deploy and where 
you plan to put them.

193
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
	
✓	Where should the gateways be located? 
	
	The answer depends in part on the topology and geographic distribution 
of your organization.
None of the previous questions can be answered independently. Answers to 
all four depend ultimately on how much telephone traffic you anticipate and 
how that traffic is distributed across your organization. But that is only the 
beginning: You must also consider your gateway topology options.
The media gateways that most organizations consider deploying range in size 
from 2 to as many as 960 ports. 
Follow these guidelines to estimate the number of gateway ports your organi­
zation will require:
	
✓	Light telephony users (one PSTN call per hour) should allocate one port 
for every 15 users. 
	
	For example, if you have 2,000 users, you need 134 ports allocated 
among multiple gateways. 
	
✓	Moderate telephony users (two PSTN calls per hour) should allocate 
one port for every ten users. 
	
	For example, if you have 2,000 users, you need 200 ports allocated 
among one or more gateways.
	
✓	Heavy telephony users (three or more PSTN calls per hour) should allo­
cate one port for every five users. 
	
	For example, if you have 2,000 users, you need 400 ports allocated 
among multiple large gateways.
A minimum of two gateways should be deployed in the event one goes down. 
Beyond that, the number and size of gateways that you should deploy will 
vary widely but you can base your decision on the above logic and the tele­
phone traffic your company generates. 
	
Consider deploying the combination of a mediation server and gateway closer 
to the location of your users. For example, if you have more than 200 users in 
any one site, consider deploying a mediation server-gateway combination at 
that site, especially if the users require high-availability and are heavy users of 
telephony (three or more PSTN calls per hour).
SIP
SIP is the industry standard protocol used by most unified communications 
solution vendors. Each mode of communication — IM, presence, conferenc­
ing, video, and voice, all uses SIP for its transport. Even signaling for the 

194
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
incoming and outgoing phone calls between the PSTN and unified communi­
cations client is converted to SIP by the media (PSTN) gateway.
	
✓	Direct SIP (see Figure 12-4) enables a qualified IP PBX to directly con­
nect to the unified communications front-end server (for example, 
Office Communications Server) without requiring the media gateway 
(for example, Cisco Call Manager v6.X and higher are qualified IP PBX to 
directly connect to the Office Communications Server using Direct SIP). 
	
✓	SIP Trunking enables the front-end server (for example, Office 
Communications Server) to connect directly to an IP Telephony Service 
Provider. There is no PBX or media gateway.
	
	SIP trunking (see Figure 12-5) has a couple of advantages:
 
• Simplifies and reduces costs for Enterprise Voice
 
• Eliminates the PBX and media gateway
As shown in Figure 12-5, for SIP trunking, an Internet Protocol virtual private 
network (IP VPN) is required to connect between your enterprise network 
and the PSTN service provider. The IP VPN provides security and IP connec­
tivity. You could also configure it for quality of service if the service provider 
gives you that option.

tion.
	
With SIP trunking implementation, the Mediation Server still provides media 
and signaling translation. But now, the SIP traffic and media traffic between 
your enterprise network and the SIP trunking service provider network flow 
through the IP VPN and the Mediation Server.
	
Wherever you install a voice client (like Communicator), I recommend that 
you maintain a backup option for users to call 911 in case of power failure 
or outage of your unified communications solution. You may consider a cell 
phone or standard telephone connected to a PSTN line.
User authorization and outbound 
call routing requirements
In your existing telephony system (PBX), any calls made by users from their 
desk phones are routed to the proper destination: Internal calls go to the 
PBX, and external calls go to the PSTN. For these calls to successfully reach 
their destinations, your existing telephony system has 
	
✓	Outbound call routing rules
	
✓	Rules or policies that determine which users can call long-distance or 
international numbers and which users are limited to local calls

196
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Now that you are implementing and configuring your unified communications 
system for Enterprise Voice, you need to duplicate the outbound routing 
rules and policies so users can continue their dialing habits with the new uni­
fied communications client, sometimes also called a softphone client.
Look at how the unified communications system actually routes the out­
bound call through the Enterprise Voice infrastructure:
	
1.	 Say that John Williams uses his Communicator client to place a call to an 
external contact at 415-555-1212.
	
2.	 The unified communications server normalizes the number to E.164 
format (+14155551212), invokes routing rules based on John’s location 
profile (Chicago), verifies that John is allowed to call long distance 
(based on user policy), and directs the call to the appropriate mediation 
server (based on routes defined).
	
3.	 The mediation server translates the media and routes the call to the 
media gateway (if present) or to the IP PBX (Direct SIP).
	
4.	 Gateway, based on topology, applies local dialing rules or PBX dialing 
rules and passes the call to the PSTN.
There are new terminologies used in describing the outbound route of a call 
originated from a user’s unified communications client (Communicator) des­
tined for the PBX or the PSTN. Figure 12-6 includes a diagram that shows this 
call flow.
Different unified communications vendors may call the outbound routing 
components by different names, but in principle, the concepts are similar 
and each follows similar steps:
	
1.	 A location profile represents unique dialing habits and numbering plans 
in a company. 
	
	 For example, a company that has sites in Chicago, Singapore, and 
London with 200 or more users in each, may create three unique loca­
tion profiles. If your company already has a traditional legacy PBX, you 
may use its dial plan and routing rules to configure the location profile.
	
2.	 A normalization rule translates a dialed number to the standard E.164 
format. 
	
	 For example, in Chicago, users may dial 911 for emergency or five digits 
for internal extensions and seven digits for local numbers. All of these 
need to be correctly translated to the E.164 format. So for the Chicago 
location profile, you may define the above three normalization rules 
so all calls get translated correctly and get routed appropriately. But 
Singapore users may have special needs, such as
 
• A different emergency number 
 
• Four-digit dialing for internal extensions 

197
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
	
	 For these reasons, it would be wise to create a unique location profile 
for Singapore and assign appropriate normalization rules to it.
	
Figure 12-6: 
Outbound 
call flow 
through the 
unified com-
munications 
system.
	
	
3.	 A phone usage record specifies a class of service (local, long-distance, 
or international) that a user or groups of users are authorized to make. 
	
	 Most organizations can easily divide their users in multiple groups: those 
allowed to call long distance and those allowed to make local calls only. 
A phone usage record is added to a voice policy, and each user in a com­
pany is assigned a voice policy. Assume that John’s company has created 
three phone usage records: local, long-distance, and international.
	
4.	 A voice policy is made up of one or more phone usage records, and then 
assigned to a user or a group of users. 
	
	 For example, John’s company defines a voice policy called Local Only. 
The company adds the local phone usage record to this policy. The com­
pany also defines a voice policy called Long Distance and International. 
It adds local, long-distance, and international phone usage records to 
this one policy. Now, if Suzy is authorized to only call local numbers, 
she is assigned the voice policy called Local Only. If the company 
authorizes John to make all calls, he is assigned the Long Distance and 
International voice policy.

198
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
5.	 A voice route associates target phone numbers with particular IP PSTN 
gateways and phone usage records. 
	
	 Say that you have users in various sites — for example, Chicago (2,000), 
Paris (500), Rome (300), and Madrid (50). You should plan to locate one 
or more mediation server and media gateway combinations at Chicago, 
Paris, and Rome. Because Madrid only has 50 users, you can create a 
route for all calls to Madrid to go through the Paris mediation server. 
Paris would be known as a breakout point. A call from the U.S. to Madrid 
first travels on the company’s wide area network (WAN) all the way to 
Paris, and then it is connected to the PSTN provider in Paris to connect 
to Madrid. So your company is only paying the toll charges for a call 
between Paris and Madrid instead of from the U.S. to Madrid, which 
would cost a lot more.
The following example illustrates the relationship between the various out­
bound routing components. You may find it helpful to refer to Figure 12-7 as 
you go through the configuration process.
Say that Contoso company headquarters is located in Chicago, IL, and they 
have 2,000 users based in Chicago.
	
1.	 First, Contoso creates a location profile called Chicago that defines all 
phone numbers that can be dialed from Chicago. The Chicago location 
profile needs multiple normalization rules.
	
2.	 Next, Contoso creates multiple normalization rules to accommodate its 
users’ dialing habits. For example:
 
• Chicago five-digit extension: If the users in Chicago used to dial 
only five digits for internal extensions, this normalization rule 
translates the five-digit extension to the full E.164 format. 
	
	For example, a user dials 51212; the translation would be 
+13125551212.
 
• Chicago Local Calls: If the users in the Chicago office used to dial 
seven digits for local calls, this normalization rule translates the 
seven digits dialed into the full E.164 format. 
	
	For example, a user dials 1231212; the translation would be 
+13121231212.
 
• Chicago National Calls: If the users in Chicago dial a ten-digit 
number, this normalization rule translates the number to a full E.164 
format by adding the leading + sign and a 1 to make it standard. 
	
	For example, a user dials 415-555-1212 to call someone in San 
Francisco; the rule translates it to full E.164 format, +14155551212.

199
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
 
• Chicago International Calls: If a user in the Chicago office dials an 
international number, this normalization rule translates it to the 
full E.164 format. 
	
	As shown in Figure 12-8, at the bottom, if you enter 
01141785551212 in the sample dialed number box, the rule trans­
lates it to +41785551212 as shown in the translated number box.

3.	 Next, Contoso creates phone usage records to specify two classes of calls 
(such as local and long distance), and then assigns them to various users, 
or groups of users, who are authorized to make those classes of calls. 
	
	 For example:
 
• ContosoUsage: No long distance calls allowed
 
• ContosoExecUsage: Long distance calls allowed
	
4.	 Next, two voice policies must be created to associate the two phone-
usage records defined above:
 
• Local Calls Only (see Figure 12-9): Add ContosoUsage to this policy 
and make sure you check the box that says Allow simultaneous 
ringing.
 
• Local and Long Distance: Add ContosoExecUsage to this policy.
	
5.	 Finally, a voice route is defined to route the destination phone numbers 
to a particular IP PSTN gateway and phone usage records.
	
	  For example:
 
• All Calls: Route all external calls to the Chicago office gateway that has 
the ContosoExecUsage as the Phone Usage defined (see Figure 12-10).
 
• Local Calls Only: Allow calls to 312, 773, 331, and 630 area codes 
only and use ContosoUsage as the Phone Usage Record.
	
6.	 After the policies and rules have been defined, you need to assign cor­
rect voice policies to the users. So everyone at Contoso who is not an 
executive will be assigned the policy defined as Local. 
As shown in Figure 12-11, John Williams, a member of the executive team, is 
assigned to the Local and Long Distance voice policy.

Deployment scenarios
You basically have two deployment options: 
	
✓	Keep your existing PBX and integrate it with Enterprise Voice.
	
✓	Remove your existing PBX completely from your environment.
	
Figure 12-11:

and Long

203
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
	
The decision depends on how your employees work:
	
✓	If your users typically work from their offices and you want to leverage 
your investment in the existing PBX, you can implement the Enterprise 
Voice components described above, mediation server and media gate­
way (if needed), to enable co-existence: 
 
• If your existing PBX is a legacy TDM PBX, you need to add the cer­
tified media gateway and mediation server so that your users’ desk 
phone and Communicator client can both be used.
 
• If your existing PBX is an IP PBX that supports SIP natively, you 
can integrate it with Enterprise Voice and enable full co-existence. 
Users can use their existing desktop IP phone or unified communi­
cations client to make calls. 
	
✓	If your users are very mobile and work remotely more often than from 
the office, you may consider removing your existing PBX completely or 
gradually and move over to the unified communications solution for all 
your voice needs. The users in this case will give up their desk phones 
immediately or gradually. 
	
✓	You can start your deployment of the unified communications solution 
with Enterprise Voice by departments or teams. Those departments 
or teams will be completely migrated to the unified communications 
solution as the only telephony solution available to them. You are able 
to introduce Enterprise Voice slowly in your company and test out the 
users’ experience before moving the entire company to it. If your com­
pany has widely dispersed teams that are mobile and prefer working 
remotely, this is an ideal solution to gain significant savings in your long-
distance and cellular phone charges. 
	
✓	If you are a new business that does not yet have a PBX or your company 
is opening new sites, you can take advantage of the unified communica­
tions solution implementation and move to Enterprise Voice. You will 
have significant savings from not having to implement and maintain a 
PBX, integrating it with unified communications, and incurring deploy­
ment and maintenance costs. In this scenario, all calls are routed over 
your IP network. Calls to the PSTN are routed to the appropriate media 
gateway. Communicator becomes your softphone client. This type of 
deployment is called a Greenfield deployment. 
	
In addition to the network infrastructure that is required to support the uni­
fied communications system, in a Greenfield deployment, you may consider a 
small PBX to support fax machines and to provide emergency services if your 
unified communications system is down. 

204
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Configuring voice mail
Your existing PBX environment may have a separate voice mail system that 
delivers voice mails to your desk phones and turns the flashing red light on. 
It is possible that the PBX may have its own voice mail system.
With the deployment of unified communications in your company, you may 
decide also to implement Unified Messaging and integrate it with the instant 
messaging and audio, videoconferencing, and voice system.
The Exchange 2007 server provides the Unified Messaging features by adding 
a UM server role to its architecture. Unified Messaging combines voice mail, 
fax, and e-mail so that users receive all in a unified mailbox, Outlook. You can 
now access your mailbox from 
	
✓	A desktop or laptop computer
	
✓	A mobile phone
	
✓	A standard telephone
For your users to have a seamless experience between their unified commu­
nications features of IM, presence, conferencing, and the Unified Messaging 
features, you need to integrate these two environments. 
If you are considering Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 for your 
unified communications solution, the following requirements must be met for 
the integration of the two components mentioned earlier:
	
✓	You must be running Exchange 2007 SP1 on all Unified Messaging serv­
ers in your organization.
	
✓	You must be running Communications Server 2007 in your organization.
	
✓	Exchange 2007 SP1 and Communications Server 2007 must be configured 
correctly.
The Exchange UM server interoperates with several IP gateways. When you 
decide to integrate Exchange UM and Office Communications Server’s unified 
communications features, then Office Communications Server becomes the 
gateway for all UM traffic and manages the routing of voice mail. Dialing rules 
are used to route incoming calls to the appropriate gateway — in this case, 
the appropriate gateway is the Office Communications Server.
In Figure 12-12, different deployment scenarios are described depending 
upon which unified communications deployment scenario you have selected 
from the earlier discussions in the “Deployment Scenarios” section.

Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
In addition to voice mail and faxes integrated with your e-mail and dropped 
into your Outlook mailbox, integration of the unified communications and UM 
features also will enable other features:
	
✓	Voicemail access: You can access your voice mails from Outlook, 
Outlook Web Access, Outlook Mobile, and Office Outlook Voice Access.
	
✓	Multiple locations: A single Exchange server can support multiple loca­
tions so you won’t need to set up separate UM servers in each of your 
sites. Many companies have different voice mail systems with their dif­
ferent PBXs in each site and will now have a unique option to centralize 
everything to a single site. 
	
✓	Integration with Many Private Branch Exchanges (PBXs): Exchange UM 
supports all standard VoIP protocols and can integrate with your TDM or 
IP PBX. If you have a TDM PBX, you will need a media gateway. The same 
media gateway that you use with your unified communications solution 
may work with Exchange UM and allow you to reduce your costs.
	
✓	Outlook Voice Access: Your users will be able to access their Exchange 
mailbox using a standard telephone or from their communicator client. 
Using touchtone commands or speech-enabled interactive menus, they can 
 
• Hear and act on their calendars
 
• Listen to e-mail messages (translated from text to speech)
 
• Listen to voice mail messages
 
• Call their personal contacts
 
• Call any user listed in the company
	
✓	Active Directory Integration: Both Exchange Unified Messaging and the 
Office Communications server use Active Directory for all user enable­
ment. Administrators can now manage all of these environments from 
standard, integrated management consoles. 
	
✓	Play on phone: When you are in a public place like an airport and it is 
not practical to play your voice mails on your computer for all to hear, 
you can route the voice mail to play on a mobile phone or desk phone. 
	
✓	Self-Service Options: You can easily reset your voice mail PIN or greet­
ings from Outlook or Outlook Web access, thus reducing the need for 
you to call the help desk.
	
✓	Speech-Enabled Auto Attendant: You may set up an automatic interac­
tive voice response system for external calls coming to your company 
number. An automated operator with customizable menus (for example, 
“Press 1 for sales”) and global address list directory lookups (for exam­
ple, “Whom would you like to contact?”) answers the incoming calls. 
Callers interact with the Automated Attendant through touch tone com­
mands or their voices using speech recognition. This is another way to 
reduce costs for answering thousands of incoming calls and route them 
to the correct department or person. 

207
 Chapter 12: Configuring Voice
After you have installed the required server roles in your Exchange Server 
2007 organization, there is a sequence of steps that you must perform on 
the Exchange UM environment and in your OCS 2007 environment to cor­
rectly deploy Enterprise Voice and Exchange Server 2007 Unified Messaging. 
Exchange 2007 UM is used to provide call answering, Outlook Voice Access, 
and auto attendant services. Office Communications Server 2007 enables 
more advanced features that are found in Enterprise Voice services. 
For integration of the two environments, you must perform the following 
steps:
	
1.	 Create UM SIP Dial Plans: All users will have an e-mail address and a 
phone extension now that they have been enabled for both Exchange 
UM and Communications Server unified communications. For the inte­
gration to work, Exchange UM dial-plan must correspond to the location 
profile defined earlier. For example, you may create a dial-plan called 
Chicago.
	
	Run ExchUcUtil.ps1: You need to run this utility using Exchange 
Management Shell and it will: 
 
• Assign the Communications server to be the UM IP gateway for 
Exchange UM to use 
 
• Create an Exchange UM hunt group for each gateway
 
• Grant Communications Server security permission to read 
Exchange UM Active Directory objects
	
2.	 Create an OCS 2007 location profile: If you are integrating Exchange UM 
with Communications Server, then the location profile name must match. 
	
	 For example, if the name of a UM dial plan is Chicago, then the name of 
the corresponding location profile must be Chicago.contoso.com.
	
3.	On the OCS 2007 Front End servers, run the Exchange UM integration 
utility. The utility creates Active Directory contact objects and validates 
that the location profile name matches the Exchange UM dial plan. 
	
	 When you run the Exchange UM Integration Utility, it performs the fol­
lowing tasks:
 
• Creates contact objects for each auto-attendant and subscriber 
access number to be used by Enterprise Voice users
 
• Verifies that the name of each Enterprise Voice location profile 
matches its corresponding UM dial plan phone context
 
• The Exchange UM Integration tool must be run from a user 
account with the following characteristic: Membership in the RTC 
UniversalUserAdmins group 
 
• Enables users for Enterprise Voice from Communications Server 
console
 
• Enables users for UM from Exchange management console

J
ust once, can’t there be a technology that just works and doesn’t require a 
conscious effort to secure and protect? 
Well, no. Sorry.
Often, vendors are in a rush to get into the market and the initial wave of 
products are big on bells and whistles and short on security. With new tech­
nologies it is common for companies to jump on the cutting-edge bandwagon 
and start implementing new tools without properly considering security. 
	
Security is less expensive and more effective when built in from the beginning 
than when tacked on as an afterthought. 
When it comes to unified communications, there are also some unique 
security concerns. Along with combining the best of both worlds, unified 
communications also introduces the worst of both worlds. Traditional voice 
networks are separate from data networks and have their own security 
issues. Migrating to VoIP, and merging voice and data communications, 
exposes the voice network to data network exploits and the data network to 
voice network exploits. 
Don’t Forget about Security
Many aspects of information security are approached as an afterthought. 
Security is not considered during the initial design of the software or hard­
ware. Security isn’t factored in to the architecture and implementation of the 
hardware or software when it is deployed. After the product is implemented, 
the options for securing it are both limited and expensive.

210
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
The right way to do security is to build it into the solution from the beginning:
	
✓	Vendors need to design their products with security in mind.
	
✓	Organizations need to consider security implications, and architect their 
implementations with security in mind.
Let’s take a look at some of the security considerations for unified commu­
nications and what you need to do to ensure that your communications are 
secure.
Understanding unified 
communications protocols
Your system will protect these common protocols:
	
✓	SIP: Short for Session Initiation Protocol, it is an application-layer 
control protocol; a signaling protocol for Internet Telephony. SIP can 
establish sessions for such features as audio/videoconferencing, interac­
tive gaming, and call forwarding to be deployed over IP networks, thus 
enabling service providers to integrate basic IP telephony services with 
Web, e-mail, and chat services.
	
	In addition to user authentication and redirect and registration services, 
SIP Server supports traditional telephony features such as personal 
mobility, time-of-day routing, and call forwarding based on the geo­
graphical location of the person being called.
	
✓	H.323: An International Telecommunications Union (ITU) standard that 
provides specification for computers, equipment, and services for mul­
timedia communication over packet based networks that defines how 
real-time audio, video and data information is transmitted.
	
	H.323 is commonly used in VoIP, Internet Telephony, and IP-based vid­
eoconferencing. Users can connect with other users over the Internet 
and use varying products that support H.323. This standard is based on 
the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Real-Time Protocol (RTP) 
and Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP), with additional protocols for 
call signaling and data and audiovisual communications.
	
✓	TLS: Short for Transport Layer Security, a protocol that guarantees pri­
vacy and data integrity between client/server applications communicat­
ing over the Internet.
	
	The TLS protocol is made up of two layers:
 
• The TLS Record Protocol: Layered on top of a reliable transport 
protocol, such as TCP, it ensures that the connection is private by 
using symmetric data encryption, and it ensures that the connection 

211
 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
is reliable. The TLS Record Protocol also is used for encapsulation 
of higher-level protocols, such as the TLS Handshake Protocol. 
 
• The TLS Handshake Protocol: Allows authentication between the 
server and client and the negotiation of an encryption algorithm 
and cryptographic keys before the application protocol transmits 
or receives any data.
	
	TLS is application protocol-independent. Higher-level protocols can 
layer on top of the TLS protocol transparently.
	
✓	RTP: Short for Real-Time Transport Protocol, an Internet protocol for 
transmitting real-time data such as audio and video. RTP itself doesn’t 
guarantee real-time delivery of data, but it does provide mechanisms 
for the sending and receiving applications to support streaming data. 
Typically, RTP runs on top of the UDP protocol, although the specifica­
tion is general enough to support other transport protocols.
	
	RTP has received wide industry support. Netscape intends to base its 
LiveMedia technology on RTP, and Microsoft claims that its NetMeeting 
product supports RTP. 
	
✓	SRTP: The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (or SRTP) defines a pro­
file of RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol), intended to provide encryp­
tion, message authentication and integrity, and replay protection to the 
RTP data in both unicast and multicast applications.
Protecting your communications 
with encryption
There are a lot of ways to attack voice systems. These range from old-school 
phreaking, to denial of service, to run-of-the-mill eavesdropping. What’s chal­
lenging about protecting these systems is that the nature of convergence 
means that there are many more attack vectors. For instance, you can attack 
an IP telephony system either
	
✓	By phone
	
✓	From the network/TCP/IP side
	
✓	Through applications, such as
 
• Integrated e-mail/voicemail
 
• HTTP, LDAP, and XML interfaces, which many IP phones support
The first thought that most network administrators have is that encryption 
would be impractical for VoIP because of the CPU-intensive overhead that 
comes from all that math. The fear is that delay and jitter the encryption 

212
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
process might add would make the conversation quality intolerable. This is a 
factor to be considered, but most networks today (especially domestic ones) 
find that they have plenty of room in their budgets to afford encryption. 
If confidential voice is a requirement in your organization, then you also need 
to decide which device will do the encryption. It may be that you only need 
to encrypt a VoIP trunk that passes through a provider’s network, in which 
case you can use regular IPSec tunnels with “VPN accelerators” or other 
hardware-based encryption devices. These devices usually add fewer than 
10 ms of delay, which is usually easy to accommodate.
If you need to encrypt all voice conversations from end-point to end-point, 
then you’re probably looking at vendor-specific implementations. While some 
IP phones and gateways on the market support encryption (such as that pro­
vided by IPsec), many phones and gateways don’t.
Office Communications Server 2007 R2 uses TLS and MTLS to encrypt instant 
messages. All server-to-server traffic requires MTLS, regardless of whether 
the traffic is confined to the internal network or crosses the internal network 
perimeter. 
	
TLS is optional, but recommended, between the Mediation Server and media 
gateway; If TLS is configured on this link, MTLS is required. Therefore, the 
gateway must be configured with a certificate from a CA that is trusted by the 
Mediation Server.
Requirements for client-to-client traffic depend on whether that traffic 
crosses the internal corporate firewall. Strictly internal traffic can use either 
	
✓	TLS, in which the instant message is encrypted
	
✓	TCP, in which the instant message isn’t encrypted
The TURN protocol doesn’t mandate the traffic to be encrypted, and the 
information that it is sending is protected by message integrity. Although it is 
open to eavesdropping, the information it is sending (IP addresses and port) 
can be extracted directly by simply looking at the source and destination 
addresses of the packets. The A/V Edge service ensures that the data is valid 
by checking the Message Integrity of the message using the key derived from 
a few items including a TURN password, which is never sent in clear text.
TLS and MTLS
TLS and MTLS protocols provide encrypted communications and endpoint 
authentication on the Internet. Office Communications Server uses these 
two protocols to create the network of trusted servers and to ensure that all 

213
 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
communications over that network are encrypted. All SIP communications 
between servers occur over MTLS. SIP communications from client to server 
occur over TLS.
TLS enables users, through their client software, to authenticate the Office 
Communications Server 2007 R2 servers to which they connect. On a TLS 
connection, the client requests a valid certificate from the server. There are 
two rules:
	
✓	The certificate must have been issued by a CA that is also trusted by the 
client.
	
✓	The DNS name of the server must match the DNS name on the certificate. 
If the certificate is valid, the client trusts the server and opens the connec­
tion. The resulting connection is trusted; from that point, the connection isn’t 
challenged by other trusted servers or clients. Within this context, Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) as used with Web services can be associated as TLS-
based.
Server-to-server connections rely on mutual TLS (MTLS) for mutual authen­
tication. On an MTLS connection, the server originating a message and 
the server receiving it exchange certificates from a mutually trusted CA. 
The certificates prove the identity of each server to the other. In Office 
Communications Server 2007 R2 deployments, certificates issued by the 
enterprise CA are automatically considered valid by all internal clients and 
servers. In federated scenarios, the issuing CA must be trusted by both feder­
ated partners. Each partner can use a different CA, if that CA is trusted by the 
other partner. 
	
This trust is most easily accomplished by either
	
✓	The Edge Servers having the partner’s root CA certificate in their trusted 
root CAs
	
✓	Use of a third-party CA that is trusted by both parties
TLS and MTLS help prevent both eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle 
attacks. In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker reroutes communications 
between two network entities through the attacker’s computer without the 
knowledge of either party. TLS and secure server lists mitigate the risk of a 
man-in-the-middle attack partially on the application layer, but ultimately 
the networking infrastructure (in this case corporate DNS) must be secured 
according to best practices. 
	
Office Communications Server assumes that the DNS server is trusted in the 
same way that domain controllers and global catalogs are trusted.

214
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Unified communications security threats
	
✓	Compromised-key attack: A compromised-key attack occurs when the 
attacker determines the key (a secret code or number used to encrypt, 
decrypt, or validate secret information). This key corresponds to the 
certificate associated with the server. When the attacker has the key, 
the attacker uses the key to decrypt encrypted data without the knowl­
edge of the sender of the data.
	
	There are two sensitive keys in use in public key infrastructure (PKI):
 
• The private key that each certificate holder has
 
• The session key that is used after a successful identification and 
session key exchange by the communicating partners
	
✓	Network denial-of-service: The denial-of-service attack occurs when the 
attacker prevents normal network use and function by valid users.
	
	By using a denial-of-service attack, the attacker can
 
• Send invalid data to applications and services running in the 
attacked network to disrupt their normal function.
 
• Send a large amount of traffic, overloading the system until it stops 
responding or responds slowly to legitimate requests.
 
• Hide the evidence of the attacks.
 
• Prevent users from accessing network resources.
	
✓	Eavesdropping: Eavesdropping can occur when an attacker gains access to 
the data path in a network and has the ability to monitor and read the traffic.
	
	This is also called sniffing or snooping. 
	
	If the traffic is in plain text, the attacker can read the traffic when the 
attacker gains access to the path. An example is an attack performed by 
controlling a router on the data path.
	
✓	Identity spoofing: Spoofing occurs when the attacker determines and 
uses an IP address of a network, computer, or network component with­
out being authorized to do so.
	
	A successful attack allows the attacker to operate as if the attacker is 
the entity normally identified by the IP address. This situation comes 
into play only if an administrator has both
 
• Configured connections that support only Transmission Control 
Protocol (which isn’t recommended, because TCP communications 
are unencrypted)
 
• Marked the IP addresses of those connections as trusted hosts
	
	This is less of a problem for Transport Layer Security (TLS) con­
nections, which are encrypted.

215
 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
	
	This precaution prevents an attacker from performing IP address spoof­
ing on specific connection (for example, mutual TLS connections). But 
an attacker could still spoof the address of the DNS server that Office 
Communications Server uses.
	
✓	Man-in-the-middle attack: A man-in-the-middle attack occurs when an 
attacker reroutes communication between two users through the attack­
er’s computer without the knowledge of the two communicating users 
(see Figure 13-1).
	
	The attacker can monitor and read the traffic before sending it to the 
intended recipient. Each user in the communication unknowingly sends 
traffic to and receives traffic from the attacker, while thinking they 
are communicating only with the intended user. This can happen if an 
attacker can either
 
• Modify Active Directory Domain Services to add his or her server 
as a trusted server
 
• Modify Domain Name System (DNS) to get clients to connect 
through the attacker on their way to the server.
	
	A man-in-the-middle attack can also occur with media traffic between 
two clients, except that in Office Communications Server 2007 R2 point-
to-point media streams are encrypted with SRTP, using cryptographic 
keys that are negotiated between the peers using Session Initiation 
Protocol (SIP) over TLS. Servers such as Group Chat and Communicator 
Web Access use HTTPS to secure Web traffic.
	
✓	RTP replay attack: A replay attack occurs when a valid media transmis­
sion between two parties is intercepted and retransmitted for malicious 
purposes.
	
	SRTP used with a secure signaling protocol protects transmissions from 
replay attacks by enabling the receiver to
 
• Maintain an index of already received RTP packets.
 
• Compare each new packet with those already listed in the index.

216
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
✓	Call Redirection Attack: When initiating VoIP communications with SIP, 
the first part of establishing a call is that the sending or initiating system 
sends a SIP INVITE request. The receiving or called system then sends 
a SIP response. The response could be that the phone is ringing, or that 
the call is being forwarded, or a variety of other options. One set of 
response codes tell the initiating SIP device that the call should be 
redirected.
	
	Here are some examples of SIP Redirection responses:
 
• 301: Move Permanently
 
• 302: Moved Temporarily
 
• 305: Use Proxy
 
• 380: Alternative Service 
	
	If an attacker can monitor or intercept the SIP INVITE requests (by exe­
cuting a MitM attack, for example), they can spoof the INVITE response 
and get the initiating SIP device to reroute or redirect the call. These 
attacks are possible from the external Internet, particularly when using 
SIP trunking to connect with the VoIP provider directly, but are more 
likely to occur successfully from attackers who already have access to 
the internal network.
	
	A Call Redirection attack could be used for
 
• Denial-of-Service: Redirect calls to a non-existent destination.
 
• Disrupt Communications: Redirect calls to some other random 
destination.
 
• Intercept Calls: Redirect calls to a rogue device and spoof the 
intended call recipient.

 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
	
✓	SPIM: Unsolicited commercial instant messages or presence subscrip­
tion requests. While not by itself a compromise of the network, it is 
annoying, it can reduce resource availability and production, and it can 
possibly lead to a compromise of the network.
	
	An example of this is users spimming each other by sending requests. 
Users can block each other to prevent this, but with federation, if a 
coordinated spim attack is established, this can be difficult to overcome 
unless you disable federation for the partner.
	
✓	SPIT: Spam over Internet Telephony, or SPIT, is the proliferation of 
unwanted, automatically-dialed, pre-recorded phone calls using Voice 
over Internet Protocol (VoIP).
	
	Voice over IP systems, like e-mail and other Internet applications, are 
susceptible to abuse by malicious parties who initiate unsolicited and 
unwanted communications. Telemarketers, prank callers, and other tele­
phone system abusers are likely to target VoIP systems, particularly if 
VoIP tends to supplant conventional telephony.
	
✓	Viruses and worms: A virus is a unit of code whose purpose is to repro­
duce additional, similar code units. To work, a virus needs a host, such 
as a file, e-mail, or program.
	
✓	A worm is a unit of code that is coded to reproduce additional, similar 
code units, but doesn’t need a host.
	
	Viruses and worms primarily show up during file transfers between cli­
ents or when URLs are sent from other users.
	
✓	Personally identifiable information: Unified communications has the 
potential to disclose information over a public network that might be 
able to be linked to an individual.
	
	The information types can be broken down to two specific categories:
	
• Enhanced presence data: Information that a user can choose to 
share, or not share, over a link to a federated partner or with con­
tacts within an organization. This data isn’t shared with users on a 
public IM network. Group policy and client configuration may give 
some control to the system administrator. 
 
• Mandatory data: Data that is required for the proper operation of 
the server or the client and isn’t under the control of the client or 
system administration. This information is necessary at a server or 
network level for the purposes of routing, state maintenance, and 
signaling.

218
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Best Practices
VoIP merges the communications network with the data network, making 
voice communications subject to the same sorts of threats and compromises 
that used to affect only data networks. Most of VoIP and unified communica­
tions security rests in sound practices for network security. 
Start by following these essential rules for security:
	
✓	Keep security patches up to date: Inadequate patching exposes the 
VoIP and data network to risks that could easily be avoided. Many 
attacks target software vulnerabilities and flaws in the implementation 
to achieve very specific and potentially damaging aims.
	
	A very systematic approach to monitoring and installing patches from 
the vendor must be formed and religiously followed to protect your 
assets.
	
✓	Install and maintain a good anti-virus system: Ensure all laptops, serv­
ers and other devices have a sophisticated anti-virus system installed 
and updated regularly to prevent viruses, worms, and other malware 
from affecting both the data and VoIP network.
	
	While existing anti-virus solutions don’t adequately protect against VoIP 
attacks because it doesn’t recognize them, you should ensure that a virus 
or worm doesn’t impact either the VoIP/unified communications network 
or applications from the data side as the infrastructures converge.
	
✓	Enforce strong authentication and encryption wherever possible: It’s 
imperative that all signaling be encrypted, but it’s just as important 
that all media be encrypted to ensure privacy and confidentiality of the 
conversation. At the same time, all end-points should be verified using 
either 
 
• Digest
 
• Certificates
 
• Two-factor authentication techniques 
	
	Inbound calls should only be accepted from trusted or verifiable 
sources.
	
✓	Secure WiFi access points: Anyone implementing a WiFi network knows 
that you need to secure it, and you need to be sure that only authorized 
endpoints have access and that the traffic is encrypted. 
	
	With WiFi/dual-mode phones being deployed in the enterprise, similar 
precautions need to be taken to ensure no rogue devices gain access to 
the network for either VoIP or data communications.

219
 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
	
✓	Use VLANs to keep voice and data traffic separate: By segmenting 
voice and data traffic using virtual LANs, VoIP traffic is prioritized, 
resulting in lower latency and better quality. VLAN separation also helps 
to prevent data attacks from affecting the VoIP network. 
	
	If you’re rolling out soft clients, enabling Microsoft OCS, or incorporat­
ing other collaboration applications, then this separation will be far less 
effective. You need to allow voice traffic on the data VLAN, and vice-
versa, so you need to police the interconnection point.
The ideal comprehensive VoIP/unified communications security solution 
incorporates three core pieces:
	
✓	Unified communications threat prevention to ensure unique VoIP/uni­
fied communications attacks are proactively recognized, detected, and 
eliminated
	
✓	Unified communications policy compliance to enforce granular polices 
to all unified communications traffic based on user, device, network, and 
time of day
	
✓	Secure unified communications access to
 
• Guarantee the privacy and authentication of all unified communi­
cations traffic to the enterprise
 
• Limit the number of ports open on existing firewalls

ing unified communications.

service attacks and malformed message fuzzing attacks.
	
	Customized scrubbing rules detect and remove malformed messages 
that may crash, make vulnerable, or slow down the VoIP systems (serv­
ers and end points).
	
✓	Media anomaly prevention: Selectively enables the media traffic and 
enforces rules on the type of traffic carried, based on the negotiated 
signaling and other configured policies (such as preventing video and 
modem/fax messages).

220
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
	This also prevents bandwidth abuse.
	
✓	Spoofing prevention: Various validation techniques are applied to 
detect and prevent device and caller ID spoofing, including the use of 
fingerprints for different protocol fields/messages that trigger further 
validations and verifications.
	
✓	Stealth attack prevention: Based on behavior learning, the product can 
detect nuisance/annoying calls to individual users and selectively block 
these calls.
	
	Stealth attacks are typically undetectable by traditional data security 
devices and SBCs that rely on rate limiting.
	
✓	Reconnaissance prevention: It must monitor source behavior to detect 
application layer scans and block the attackers.
	
✓	Spam protection: Unlike e-mail spam, where the e-mail content is avail­
able to perform text analysis, VoIP spam must be prevented by blocking 
a call even before the actual message is delivered.
	
	Compute and maintain network-wide caller trust scores and apply vari­
ous policies to detect and protect against spammers, including VoIP 
Turing tests to identify machine generated calls.
	
✓	Signature updates: New signatures for detecting new known and poten­
tial attacks must be
 
• Easily added to a central attack signatures database
 
• Automatically distributed to all appliances in the network
VoIP/unified communications 
policy compliance
	
✓	Whitelist/Blacklist: Used to allow and block specific endpoints based on 
either
 
• Caller identity
 
• SIP URI
 
• IP Address
 
• Device name
	
	Entire domains can be blocked.
	
✓	Signaling Firewall: Signaling rules allow you to define the action to be 
taken (allow or deny) for each type of signaling request and response 
message. 
	
	Signaling rules allow finegrained control over protocol headers, meth­
ods, and requests.

221
 Chapter 13: Securing Unified Communications
	
✓	Media Firewall: Media rules allow you to enforce RTP media packet 
parameters such as
 
• Codec types (both audio and video)
 
• Codec matching priority
 
• Firewall rules 
 
• NAT considerations
	
✓	Application Control: Application rules allow you to enforce which types 
of and how many unified communication sessions are allowed for such 
applications as voice, video, and IM.
	
✓	Call Routing Policies: Routing rules allow fine-grained control over
 
• Inbound packet transport settings
 
• Name server addresses and resolution methods
 
• Next hop routing information
 
• Outbound packet transport types
Secure VoIP/unified communications 
access
	
✓	Message integrity: Message integrity means that the recipient is assured 
that what they receive is exactly what the sender transmitted.
	
	This is achieved by standard HMAC techniques used in TLS and SRTP
	
✓	Privacy: Privacy prevents unauthorized network users from eavesdrop­
ping on data sent to and from the network by encrypting it, thereby 
assuring confidentiality to authorized users.
	
	This is achieved by standard encryption algorithms used by TLS and 
SRTP.
	
✓	Authentication: Authentication identifies the parties exchanging infor­
mation and ensures that each party can be sure of whom they are com­
municating with.
	
	This is achieved by using two-factor authentication, such as RSA 
SecurID, exchanging digital certificates, and/or encrypted password 
based digest authentication techniques.
	
✓	Replay protection: Replay protection ensures that transmitted data 
cannot be captured and replayed at another time.
	
	This is achieved by integrity protection of sequence numbers or random 
nonces.

222
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
✓	Firewall/NAT traversal: Media uses ephemeral UDP ports that need to 
be open during the call.
	
	Enforce signaling/media integrity by allowing media traffic to use only 
the negotiated port numbers while blocking all non-negotiated ports 
to prevent media attacks. And for remote users behind NAT, the VoIP 
Firewall must keep the port mapping on the remote NAT refreshed to be 
able to successfully connect new calls.
	
✓	Secure Firewall Channel: Tunnel VoIP/unified communications traffic to 
the IP PBX to ensure that
 
• Only one port is open in the internal firewall.
 
• There is no access to other data services. 
	
	This functionality is crucial to simplifying firewall rules and ensuring the 
security of the system making it a key advantage over traditional firewalls.
	
✓	Call Admission Control: Set limit on maximum number of simultaneous 
calls, bandwidth usage, and call rate for each network, domain, and user 
group.

Archiving and Compliance 
In This Chapter
▶	Compliance requirements
▶	Archiving instant messages
▶	Archiving meeting history
▶	Archiving voicemail
▶	Archiving e-mail
T
his chapter discusses the current compliance requirements that exist 
and summarizes those requirements for electronic communications, 
specifically. It also covers the available options you have to comply with 
those requirements — including archiving of IM; audio-, video-, and Web-
conferencing; e-mail; and calling history. 
Compliance Requirements
Are you in a business that is regulated by the federal, state, or local government? 
Are you in health, insurance, financial, or any industry that typically is regulated 
and has a higher degree of compliance requirements than other businesses? 
Have you heard about the HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley, FDIC, and other regulations 
that affect e-mail, instant messaging, and how they are managed and archived 
to meet the regulations? 
Have you heard about the e-discovery law that was passed in December 2006? 
If your answer is yes to any of these questions, chances are that your company 
is already archiving and retaining the e-mail messages. If your answer is no or 
your company is not archiving and retaining the electronic communications 

224
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
between your employees and customers and partners, you may need to 
start looking for ways to archive them. It may include all your electronic 
communications:
	
✓	Instant messages
	
✓	Audio-, video, and Web-conferencing
	
✓	Voice calls
	
✓	E-mail
You may be required to archive these communications in specific ways so 
that you are in compliance with the federal, state, or local requirements.
HIPAA
If your business participates in any type of health care of patients, you may 
be familiar with the implementation and provisions of the HIPAA regulation. 
For everyone’s clarification purposes, the following sections discuss the 
rules, the people covered, and the compliance requirements. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) released the 
Privacy rule in April 2003 to implement the requirements identified in the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).
This privacy rule addresses the use and disclosure of an individual’s health 
information known as “protected health information” by organizations that 
are subject to the privacy rule known as “covered entities.”
A major goal of the privacy rule is to assure that individuals’ health informa­
tion is secured and protected appropriately while allowing the flow of health 
information needed to provide and promote high-quality health care and to 
protect the public’s health and well-being.
The privacy rule applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and to 
any health-care provider who transmits health information in electronic form 
in connection with transactions for which the Secretary of HHS has adopted 
standards under HIPAA.
To determine whether you are a “covered entity,” use the decision tool at:
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HIPAAGenInfo/06_AreYouaCoveredEntity.asp
Basically any business that deals with a person’s health and electronically 
transmits that person’s health information needs to meet specific compliance 
requirements. 

225
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
HIPAA documentation and 
record retention
A covered entity must maintain, until six years after the later of the date of 
their creation or last effective date, its privacy policies and procedures, its 
privacy practices notices, disposition of complaints, and other actions, activi­
ties, and designations that the privacy rule requires to be documented.
In addition to HIPAA, many other regulations need to be considered by busi­
nesses to determine their archiving and compliance requirements. Major 
amongst them are:
	
✓	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX): This is one of the most widely 
known regulatory acts that requires the preservation records by cer­
tain exchange members, brokers, and dealers. Many corporate scan­
dals, including Enron’s, caused the decline of public trust in corporate 
accounting and brought about the passing of this act.
	
✓	Security Exchange Commission Rule 17a-4 (SEC Rule 17 A-4): A U.S. 
Security and Exchange Rule that provides rules regarding the retention 
of electronic correspondence and records.
	
✓	National Association of Securities Dealers 3010 & 3110 (NASD 3010 
& 3110): The NASD details requirements for member firms that include 
the supervision of registered representatives, including transactions and 
correspondence with the public. These regulations affect primarily 
broker-dealers, registered representatives, and individuals who trade 
securities or act as brokers for traders who are subject to the regulations.
	
✓	Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools 
Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot 
Act): It is known as the Patriot Act and expands the authority of U.S. 
law enforcement for the stated purpose of fighting terrorist acts in the 
United States and abroad.
Now that everyone is either using or considering using some of the uni­
fied communications tools like instant messaging, audio, video, and 
Web-conferencing, e-mail, and VoIP-based calls, it becomes a corporate 
responsibility to manage these communications both for security and protec­
tion of corporate information.
Many businesses have recognized the corporate, regulatory, and e-discovery 
requirements to retain and archive corporate e-mail communications and 
have implemented rules and procedures to do so. Most businesses retain 
their corporate e-mail communications for three to seven years, depending 
on the type of business they are in as well as the federal, state, and local 
requirements. 

226
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Those businesses need to focus on the real-time communications applica­
tions in their workplace and assess the risks associated with employees 
using instant messaging with their colleagues, customers, and partners. 
Obviously, management should be concerned that employees are not send­
ing the company’s confidential information (intellectual property) to custom­
ers or partners.
E-discovery law
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enacted new laws for e-discovery that went 
into effect in December 2006, requiring organizations to keep track of any elec­
tronic communications and be prepared to produce it as evidence in most 
federal court cases — especially for electronically stored information (ESI). ESI 
covers any and all information that can be stored electronically — including 
e-mail, instant messaging threads, and other forms of electronic communica­
tion. Government agencies have been known to request ESI more often in recent 
times and impose strict penalties for failure to produce it. Unfortunately, many 
companies are unaware of these compliance requirements.
Even if you are in a non-regulated industry, you should consider corporate 
compliance as the best practice to protect your electronic communications 
from any sort of unauthorized use and prepare yourself for the e-discovery 
laws. It is in the company’s best interest to archive and retain electronic com­
munications like e-mail and IM.
Look at the following types of communications:
	
✓	E-mail
	
✓	Instant messages
	
✓	File-transfers via IM
	
✓	Information sharing
	
✓	Sharing or restricting access to sensitive data
	
✓	Audit trail

Archiving Instant Messages
There are many regulatory requirements to archive and retain electronically 
stored information, which includes instant messages.
Fortunately for the businesses that are planning to deploy instant messaging in 
their organization, most unified communications vendors include some form 
of archiving solution as part of their unified communications solution, albeit as 
an optional component. If you are still evaluating unified communications solu­
tions from different vendors and your company is one of the covered entities 
described earlier, then you should look at unified communications vendors’ 
solutions that include archiving and compliance out of the box. It is always 
better to have the option of installing the archiving component when you 

229
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
need it. Make sure that you also look at the archiving solution options — for 
example, can you define retention policies by department or individuals? That 
would be a big plus. 
After researching the compliance requirements that apply to your particu­
lar business, you need to evaluate the archiving component included in the 
unified communications solution that you have deployed or are planning to 
deploy. If an out-of-the-box archiving component doesn’t offer all of the fea­
tures you need based on the requirements, you need to look at third-party 
solutions that will provide the appropriate coverage. Your unified communi­
cations vendor also may have recommendations for third-party partner solu­
tions that integrate well with its unified communications solution.
In most cases, instant messaging happens between two or more people who 
work for the same organization. In some cases, your company may extend 
your IM infrastructure to federate with your customers and partners. 
	
Federation is possible between two organizations if both have deployed the 
same type of unified communications solution, and then trust each other by 
exchanging digital certificates and each other’s external FQDN for the edge 
servers. The IP address of the Edge server has to be publicly routable.
If your IM system is internal only, the archiving server component will allow 
for archiving the text of the IM conversation.
If your IM system includes federation with customers and partners, then the 
archiving server component may allow you to archive the text of all IM con­
versations, including those of external participants. This is something you 
need to pay attention to if it applies to your company, and then figure out the 
best solution that covers all your requirements.
Archiving server component
Here’s an example to illustrate the process of deploying and implement­
ing an archiving solution: Say a medium-sized organization is deploying 
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007, which includes an optional 
archiving server component out of the box. Most vendors’ unified com­
munications solutions will fit this example, with a little variation of features 
included or reports that are available out of the box. Figure 14-1 shows the 
typical scenario for a medium-sized organization deploying Microsoft Office 
Communications Server 2007 that includes the optional archiving server com­
ponent for the purpose of archiving all the content of IM conversations.
The archiving server component shown uses a SQL database server to store all 
the content being archived. It is possible to co-locate the database server and 
archiving server on the same computer. It is recommended to use a separate 
server for the database if you have more than 500 users with a lot of IM activity.

230
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
Figure 14-1: 
Medium-
sized 
organiza-
tion’s 
deployment 
of unified 
communica-
tions with 
archiving.
	
If your company has fewer than 100 users, you can co-locate the archiving 
server with the front-end server. You will have to watch out for the perfor­
mance impact on your users and decide if the archiving activity is impacting 
users’ productivity when they are using IM.
	
You may use a single SQL server for the archiving database. But if your com­
pany wants high availability and redundancy for the SQL database, so that no 
IM conversations can be missed, you may consider using a virtual SQL server 
instance running in a cluster. Clustering the SQL server database means you 
have two instances of SQL server — one active and one passive node — that 
ensures that if the active node fails the passive node will take over, providing 
extra assurance or redundancy. 
When you deploy the archiving server and associate it with your front-end 
server, you can choose to archive IM conversations of all users located on the 
front-end server or pool or archive only the users that you specify. You can see 
these options in Figure 14-2. You also have an option to select archiving the 
federated conversations if your company has enabled federation.
When you set up the archiving server, you have an option to choose to run 
the archiving server in critical mode if the archiving server is temporarily 
unable to send a message to the database queue or insert a message into the 
database — where the front-end server shuts down.
To illustrate, look at a scenario of how the IM conversations are archived 
after you have installed the archiving server component and chosen to 
archive all users’ IM conversations.

2.	Open SQL Server Management Studio Express on the SQL server, 
which is installed along with the archiving server component. 
	
	 As an administrator, you have access to SQL Server Management Studio 
Express.
	
3.	Connect to the instance of the SQL server created in Step 2.
	
4.	Click New Query, type the following query (case-sensitive), and then 
click Execute:
USE LcsLog
GO
SELECT * FROM Messages

232
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
	 The query returns the results that show all the IM messages, including 
date/time stamp and other pertinent information.
	
5.	Scroll all the way to the right, under the Body column, to see the 
details of a specific conversation.
	
	 For other reports and information captured by the archiving server 
component, Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 includes a 
Resource Kit. The Resource Kit includes an Archiving Reporter tool that 
provides the number of reports and access to other pertinent data. You 
need to install the Resource Kit on the archiving server computer.
	
6.	Install the OCS R2 Resource Kit ocsreskit.msi from the OCS 2007 
server DVD. 
	
	The Resource Kit installs ArchivingCdrReporter.
	
7.	Run the Reporter from Start and find it under Microsoft Office 
Communications Server 2007.
	
8.	Click the Archiving tab; then, in Instance, type the name of the SQL 
server instance that was created earlier.
	
9.	In the Database name field, type LcsLog and click OK. Then, from the 
Database drop-down list, choose Archiving.
	
	 As you can see in Figure 14-4, ArchivingCdrReporter enables you to look 
at different numbers that have been captured for peer to peer IM con­
versations, conferencing data, total number of users, and actual users 
whose data has been captured.
	
	 If you want to figure out which users are actually using the unified com­
munications system you have deployed, you can search the archived 
data and find those users, as shown in Figure 14-5.

ArchivingCdrReporter allows you to filter the information by dates or by spe­
cific users’ activities. In Figure 14-6, I filtered the archived data between May 
1, 2009, and June 19, 2009, for the users Peter and Holly. The total number of 
instant messages between them is 20.
	
Figure 14-6:

234
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Based on your requirements, the filter provides options such as searching 
for all IM conversations for a particular person between specific dates (enter 
only the one user’s SIP URI — the e-mail address), all IM conversations that 
occurred between two specific users (enter both users’ SIP URI), or all IM 
conversations among all users between specific dates (enter only the dates 
and leave the SIP URI blank). 
If all the preceding features and options shown for the example still don’t 
meet your archiving and compliance requirements for IM messages, you need 
to look at other vendors that specialize in archiving and compliance solu­
tions. Most of these vendors create customized archiving solutions that inte­
grate well with the core unified communications vendor’s solutions.
Archiving Conferencing and VoIP Data
If you are deploying a unified communciations solution in your company, you 
probably will enable your users for 
	
✓	Audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing
	
✓	Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls
	
✓	Meetings
	
✓	Application sharing
	
✓	File transfers
Any type of conferencing and voice communications data is commonly 
known as Call Detail Record (CDR) and comprises many data elements that 
are typically required for both compliance and monitoring, including 
	
✓	Date/time stamp
	
✓	Initiator
	
✓	Participants
	
✓	Duration 
In the earlier example, the archiving server component of Microsoft Office 
Communications Server 2007 was implemented. If your company also needs 
to capture the call detail records to meet compliance requirements, then you 
will need to deploy the monitoring server component.
Using the earlier example of a medium-sized organization, and as shown 
in Figure 14-7, I install the monitoring server component in addition to the 
archiving server component installed earlier.

235
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
	
Figure 14-7: 
Monitoring 
server 
component

medium-
sized 
deployment.
	
Obviously, each unified communications vendor offers different ways to col­
lect this data. If your organization is required to capture data for compliance, 
make sure that the unified communications vendor you are looking at pro­
vides a way for you to do so. Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 
delivers enhanced out-of-the-box monitoring and reporting capabilities for 
conferencing, voice, and video conversations.
Monitoring server component
It’s possible to install the monitoring server component on the same server 
as the archiving server component if your organization has fewer than 100 
users and your requirements are simple. It does require a full installation of 
Microsoft SQL server database. You may use a single SQL server for the mon­
itoring database. But if your company wants high availability and redundancy 
for the database so that no CDR can be missed, consider using a virtual SQL 
server instance running in a cluster.
When you deploy the monitoring server and associate it with your front-
end server (see Figure 14-8), you can select to monitor all peer-to-peer call 
details, conferencing call details, and voice call details.
After you install the monitoring server, you need to enable call detail record­
ing on the front-end server or pool to actually start the data capture. You 
also need to restart the front-end server service so the call detail records get 
captured when any activities take place between the users.

236
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
Figure 14-8:

options.
	
The following steps show how the call detail record data is captured and how 
you can look at some available reports:
	
1.	Start a video conversation.
	
	 In this example, Peter starts a video conversation with Holly (see 
Figure 14-9).
	
Figure 14-9: 
Video con-
versation

237
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
	
2.	Look at the right side of the Conversation screen to see how long the 
audio conversation has been in progress.
	
	 In the audio conversation between Peter and Holly, you can see that the 
conversation has been going on for 2 minutes, 44 seconds.
	
3.	To access the CDR data (as an administrator), open the Archiving CDR 
Reporter on the archiving server and view the new CDR data elements 
that have been captured by the Monitoring server component. Click 
the CDR tab; in the Instance, type the name of the SQL server instance 
created for the Monitoring component.
	
4.	In the Database name field, type LcsCDR and click OK. In the Database 
drop-down list, choose CDR.
	
	 As shown in Figure 14-10, ArchivingCdrReporter enables you to look at 
many different data elements, including
 
• Peer to Peer Usage Reports
 
• Conferencing Usage Reports
 
• VoIP Usage Reports
 
• Response Group Usage Reports
	
	 In Figure 14-10 you can see the selected dates between 5/1/09 and 
6/19/09, and Peter and Holly as the users. You can see all the statistics 
of usage between these users for the dates specified. For example, they 
spent a total of 30 minutes in conferencing during that time period.
	
Figure 14-10:

shows total 
conference 
minutes. 
	

238
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
5.	To enable the Monitoring Server Report Pack, which you can add 
during installation, you must be running SQL server reporting service 
on that computer. 
	
	 The reports are accessible from the Web site you define during the 
installation of the report pack. By default, your Web URL is https://
reports.domain.com/reportserver/. After you access the report 
server Web URL, you get a list of reports that you can run for either
 
• Specific dates and specific users
 
• All dates and all users

Archiving Voicemail and E-mail
Microsoft Exchange 2007 Server provides Unified Messaging that includes 
convergence of your e-mail, voicemail, and fax transmissions all coming into 
your single mailbox. Now that all communications media is delivered into 
a single Outlook inbox, you need to consider the archiving and compliance 
requirements for the e-mail and voicemail delivered as e-mail.
Even if your organization has not deployed Exchange Unified Messaging, your 
voicemail system may be delivering them in your Outlook e-mail mailbox. 
As long as they are delivered to your mailbox, you may have compliance 
requirements to archive them.

239
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
Most businesses that have implemented some sort of e-mail messaging system 
in their organizations may already have made provisions to retain and archive 
the e-mail messages for the 3- to 7-year period required by regulations.
For an example scenario, say a medium-sized organization is using Microsoft 
Exchange Server 2007 as its e-mail system. Exchange uses two concepts that I 
need to explain: archiving and journaling.

All your e-mail and perhaps voicemail is automatically deposited in your 
mailbox and stored on the Exchange server. In fact, Exchange calls it the 
mailbox server role. As e-mail is received by your e-mail system — Exchange 
server in most cases — it gets sent immediately to the mailbox server role. 
The client, in this case Microsoft Outlook, will be able to access the e-mail, 
and perhaps the voicemail, from the mailbox server when needed. If you are 
required to archive these e-mails, you need to back up and store the data 
somewhere and remove it from its native storage. This way, even if users 
delete the e-mail from their active inbox, the backup will still be available for 
compliance purposes. This activity is called archiving.
The question is whose e-mail and voicemail gets archived? Earlier, in the 
discussion of instant messaging, I mentioned that the administrator has the 
capability to determine whether the IMs of all or only selected users get 
archived. With Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, you also have the capabil­
ity to define which users’ e-mail and voicemails get archived. This activity is 
called journaling.
Journaling allows the administrator to specify that all communications be 
recorded, including e-mail communications, so that the organization can 
meet its compliance requirements. Many organizations may have imple­
mented e-mail retention or archival strategy as a company policy to meet 
other obligations, such as e-discovery laws.
To illustrate, consider an example of a financial services company based in 
New York. SEC and NASDAQ regulations require the corporate officers to 
take the responsibility for any claims their employees make to their clients. 
These claims may be made by brokers or financial analysts to the clients via 
instant messages, e-mail, and so forth. The company officers need to ensure 
that claims made are accurate and that the company can stand behind them. 
One way to do this is to occasionally and randomly review employee commu­
nications both instant messaging (if enabled) and e-mail.
This financial services company needs to journal all e-mail communications 
of those employees who directly communicate with clients. Even fax trans­
missions and telephone conversations of these employees to their customers 
must be recorded.

240
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
If your company has implemented Exchange Unified Messaging, all voice 
mails and faxes are delivered to their e-mail mailboxes along with e-mail, 
making it easier to journal all communications coming into the e-mail mailbox 
of those employees who deal with customers.
With Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, administrators need to define a 
Journaling agent to capture all e-mail communications for those employees 
just mentioned. Administrators have two options:
	
✓	Standard journaling. In this option, each user is located on a specific 
mailbox database on the computer that hosts the mailbox server role. 
You may have divided your user base among multiple mailbox data­
bases as a performance or storage requirement. If you have five mailbox 
databases defined in your Exchange organization, you need to configure 
journaling for each mailbox manually. It may be wise as a retention and 
archival strategy to group all users who need to be recorded into a mail­
box database and only journal that database. 
	
✓	Premium journaling: In this option, individual users or users in a dis­
tribution list can be marked for journaling regardless of which mailbox 
database they are located in. Premium Journaling requires Exchange 
Enterprise Client Access License (CAL).
Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 allows administrators to define the scope of 
the journaling rule:
	
✓	Internal: Only messages sent or received by internal mailboxes are 
journaled.
	
✓	External: Messages sent or received from external recipients are 
journaled.
	
✓	Global: All messages that pass through the hub transport server in an 
Exchange organization are journaled.
Based on the regulations that apply to your company, select internal, exter­
nal, or global scope to process the messages. 
	
External and Global scopes will increase the number of messages that are 
processed and retained in your archived storage, requiring you to provide for 
additional storage capacity as well as plan for the performance hit on your 
infrastructure.
	
If your organization falls under any special regulations for retention of e-mail 
communications from or to specific recipients, or if they are involved in any 
legal proceedings, you may consider using the Premium Journaling option 
available.

241
 Chapter 14: Archiving and Compliance 
Exchange Unified Messaging–enabled 
journal recipients
If your organization has deployed Exchange Unified Messaging, your users 
will get their faxes, voicemails, and e-mails all in the same inbox. The volume 
of this combination of messages for each user can be significant for an orga­
nization. You need to determine if the regulation requires you to retain and 
archive all communications, including missed-call notifications and voice­
mail, or just the e-mail messages.
	
If you can skip retaining the missed-call notifications and voicemail messages 
generated by the UM server, that will substantially reduce the need for extra 
storage space on your archiving hardware and reduce the performance hit on 
your network.
The journaling agent allows you to skip processing of the missed-call notifica­
tions and voicemail messages.
	
Unified Messaging service delivers faxes to your Inbox as mail messages. 
These messages will always be journaled even if you skip the missed-call noti­
fications and voicemail messages.
Journaling mailboxes
When you define journaling in Microsoft Exchange Server 2007, you also have 
to configure a journaling mailbox that is used to collect all journal reports.
	
Journal reports contain the most sensitive information that you need to 
secure and protect at all costs. If needed, you will be required to submit the 
contents of the journaling mailbox as is without any tampering.
Messages that are journaled are wrapped in journaling envelopes that con­
tain information about whom the message was sent to, who sent it, its sub­
ject, and other useful information. You may either
	
✓	Create one journaling mailbox to collect messages for all the journal rules.
	
✓	Create journaling mailboxes for each journal rule. 
The journaling mailbox can be a valid SMTP address, meaning that you can 
store journaled messages in either
	
✓	Microsoft Exchange
	
✓	A SharePoint services site
	
✓	A hosted message archival solution

242
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
Create strict policies for who can access the journaling mailbox and speak 
with your legal counsel to verify that your retention and archiving policies will 
meet the regulatory requirements for your organization.
Considering Exchange Hosted Services
Perhaps your organization is not ready to take on the additional require­
ments of hardware, software, and administration of archiving and com­
pliance. In that case, you may consider external services provided by 
third-party providers that enable archiving as a hosted service. Microsoft 
provides Exchange Hosted Services: 
	
✓	Hosted Filtering protects from e-mail–borne malware.
	
✓	Hosted Archiving provides e-mail retention.
	
✓	Hosted Encryption encrypts data to preserve confidentiality.
	
✓	Hosted Continuity provides access to e-mail during and after emergency 
situations.
Exchange Hosted Services can be integrated with on-premise Exchange serv­
ers that your IT staff is managing, as well as with Hosted Exchange e-mail ser­
vices offered through service providers.

▶	Monitoring systems
▶	Diagnosing problems
E
ven after you have successfully deployed all of your unified communica­
tions components, you are really not done. If you are in the IT depart­
ment of your company, you now have the responsibility of managing this new 
infrastructure. You must make sure that it works as advertised, and that your 
users are achieving higher productivity and are satisfied.
You have assembled so many components together — hardware, software, 
network, PBX integration with gateways (if enabled), and of course, the users — 
that something somewhere could fail. Managing and monitoring the unified 
communications infrastructure that you have planned and implemented so 
carefully is a mission critical task.
If you are part of the IT team that is responsible for the planning and imple­
mentation of your company’s unified communications solution, then the 
contents of this chapter are for you. It starts with exploring details about 
monitoring the server component (see Chapter 14), and then dives into 
detailed troubleshooting strategies and how your unified communications 
solution can help you do just that. This chapter also explores the diagnostics 
tools that you should be familiar with and describes the major ones available.
Monitoring Unified Communications
Any technology solution that you implement requires constant monitoring to 
keep it running smoothly and make sure that the users are productive when 
they use the solution so the company’s investment in the technology is get­
ting paid back.

244
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
As IT administrators for the unified communications solution, you should 
constantly monitor the unified communications system and its usage. 
Constant monitoring ensures that you will be able to detect problems and 
issues before they become company-wide problems and everything shuts 
down. 
Most unified communications solutions include tools for the administrator 
to manage the infrastructure proactively and be on the lookout for potential 
problems. Amongst the tools that are commonly available are:
	
✓	Event logs
	
✓	Performance monitor
	
✓	Archiving Server and Monitoring Server
Administrators can use a combination of these tools to monitor the health 
of the unified communications system, track the usage, and make sure that 
users are taking full advantage of the components.
Event logs
Any software solution that you implement is tracked through recording of 
events in the Windows event log. After implemented and operational, your 
unified communications system starts logging milestones, successes, failures, 
and warnings in the event logs.
In the example scenario of deploying the Microsoft Office Communications 
Server 2007 R2, it saves all the event information in an event log named Office 
Communications Server. If the archiving server cannot connect to the SQL 
server database, an event will be recorded as shown below:
Failed to connect to the back-end database. Office Communications Server 
Archiving Service will continuously attempt to reconnect to the back-end. 
While this condition persists, incoming messages will not be archived and 
will remain in the queue.
Windows Event viewer is a standard tool included with any server or client 
software that you install in your environment. It records and logs thousands 
of events that are not as important or critical for you to monitor. The events 
that you need to monitor are the warnings and actual failures that occur. To 
better monitor these important events, there are other tools that look at the 
Event logs for you and only deliver the important events that you specify for 
your view.

245
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2 has included a Microsoft 
Management Console (MMC) snap-in called Administrative Tool that presents 
a better view for the administrators focused on OCS. The Administrative tool 
is recommended because it includes filtering mechanisms that administra­
tors can use to select only events that show critical errors or select specific 
categories, dates, and so forth. 
The Administrative tool by default shows you the latest ten events regard­
less of the event source or category for that server. It also makes it possible 
to look at events for any server by simply clicking on the server that you are 
interested in. All the OCS server roles that you have deployed in your organi­
zation show up in the Administrative tool, and you can select event logs for 
any of them.
Look at an example. You deployed the Archiving Server component. You 
are the IT administrator and you have been asked to monitor the Archiving 
server. You will open the Administrative tool and click the Archiving server 
node. Each server’s events are grouped by categories in the event log to 
allow for quick views. The Administrative tool displays the event categories 
for the Archiving server:
	
✓	Archiving Server
	
✓	Management
	
✓	Deployment
Administrative tool
The Administrative tool will show only the events that are relevant to the 
archiving server role, and so you have to monitor and track only those 
events. After all the events for the archiving server role have been collected, 
the administrative tool allows you to scroll through the list and see the actual 
reason for the event. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	On one of the OCS 2007 servers, archiving or monitoring, go to Start, 
select Run, and type MMC. That will open the Microsoft Management 
Console. Select File, and then click Add/Remove Snap-In. As shown 
in Figure 15-1, from the Available Snap-Ins window, select Office 
Communications Server, and then click Add. Click OK. 
	
	 Save this MMC console by giving it a name for ease of use in the future.

snap-ins for

strative 
Tool.
	
	
2.	After the Administrative tool opens, select the Forest and expand the 
nodes. 
	
	 For example, if you are interested in looking at the Monitoring server, 
click on that node and select the server. In the right-window pane, you 
can select the Status tab to look at the status of the services for the 
Monitoring server. The next tab shows the Event Log, as shown in Figure 
15-2; you can see all the events that include information, warnings, and 
error events.

247
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
	
3.	If you don’t want to see all the events but only the critical errors, you 
can open the Event Log Filter and choose to display records by
 
• Category
 
• Type of event (information, warning, or error)
 
• Dates
 
• Maximum number of records 
	
	 As shown in Figure 15-3, all errors that occurred after June 1, 2009, in All 
Categories were selected. This strips the list from the Figure 15-2 (nine 
records) down to only error events (three records). 
	
	 As an administrator, sometimes you only want to focus on critical errors 
that you need to fix right away, and those are exactly what you will be 
viewing, as shown in Figure 15-3.
	
Figure 15-3: 
Admini- 
strative tool

Performance monitoring
As an administrator, you should always be proactive in monitoring the uni­
fied communications environment for signs of trouble before it actually 
happens. The Event log provides you with adequate information about the 
events that have happened already. Problems recorded in the Event logs 
provide you with information that you can use and respond to in order to 
prevent the same events from happening again.

248
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Administrators for the unified communications system need to look for moni­
toring information somewhere else — and that is the Performance monitor. It 
involves real-time monitoring of the entire unified communications system as 
well as the individual components that have been deployed in your environ­
ment, such as archiving or remote access.
Any Windows server or client component is best monitored using the 
Performance monitor. Most vendors create many data elements in their 
systems that can be monitored through what’s called performance counters. 
Performance counters enable you to monitor how many users are connected 
to the system at any given time or how the CPU is performing under the load 
of that many users.
Continuing with the example of Microsoft Office Communications Server 
2007, it has a myriad of counters that allow an administrator to monitor the 
health of the overall system as well as manage and monitor individual server 
components, like the Archiving server.
The Administrative tool used in the earlier example to view the Event logs 
was specifically designed to focus on the OCS 2007 server only. In the same 
way, the Administrative tool has been embedded with instances of the 
Performance monitor that are pre-populated with the counters relevant to 
the OCS 2007 server and its components.
For example, if you want to look at the performance counters available for 
the Monitoring Server component, here is what you need to do:
	
1.	Open the Administrative tool console.
	
2.	Click on the Monitoring node, and then highlight the server.
	
3.	In the right-window pane, select the Performance tab. 
	
	 You will see an instance of Performance monitor already running that 
shows different Call Detail Records (CDR) counters displayed in the 
graphical way. This default instance of the performance counter is 
shown in Figure 15-4.
	
	 You can change the style of the graph, add other counters, remove exist­
ing counters, and more. 
	
	 For example, if you want to see how the processor is doing, you can add 
the Processor Time counter by simply clicking on the + sign, and then 
selecting the appropriate counter. Now you can see the results of the 
Processor time counter in the graph, as shown in Figure 15-5. You can 
see the yellow line between the 0 and 10 percent lines.

Administrative tools have a default set of performance instances pre-defined 
for each server component in the OCS 2007 server environment. It’s possible 
that you don’t like the default counters selected in a specific instance of the 
Performance monitor for a server component. Just like the processor time 
counter was added in the example above, you may want to add or delete 
counters that are shown in an instance, and then save that modification for 
future use.

250
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
The only way to modify the default set of performance counters for a server 
component is by modifying a file called ServerPerfMon.xml, and then saving it.
	
You can find the ServerPerfMon.xml file in C:\program files\common 
files\Microsoft office communications server 2007 r2\. Back 
up this file first before modifying it. Simply add new counters that you want to 
be displayed and remove those that you don’t want to be displayed.
Archiving server and Monitoring server
In Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007, the Archiving server role 
recorded the contents of all IM conversations that occurred in your unified 
communications environment as well as captured the usage information, 
called Call Detail Records (CDR). CDRs include the usage information like 
	
✓	File transfers
	
✓	Audio, video and Web-conferencing usage
	
✓	Application sharing
	
✓	Desktop sharing 
As an administrator, you install the Archiving server role to collect all of this 
usage information and to meet compliance requirements.
With the release of Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2, the CDR 
capture capabilities were moved to the Monitoring server role along with 
other new monitoring features. For monitoring and tracking usage informa­
tion related to conferences, file transfers, or VoIP calls, you now also need to 
install the Monitoring server role.
	
Archiving server stores the actual content of the IM conversations in the SQL 
server database. Monitoring server does not actually record or store the phone 
calls or conferences content, but does record and store such information as 
	
✓	Time and date
	
✓	Who called whom
	
✓	Call length
	
✓	Which devices were used
In this chapter, we look at Archiving server and Monitoring server roles in 
detail from a monitoring and trouble-shooting perspective.

251
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
Say that your thousands of users have been using the unified communica­
tions system for a while and your management decides to evaluate how the 
users would rate the system:
	
✓	You may create an evaluation survey for the system, and then ask the 
users to fill out the survey. 
	
	If you don’t want to ask all the thousands of users, you may use the 
Archiving server and Monitoring server data to identify the top 100 
users of IM; audio, video, or Web-conferencing; or VoIP calls, and then 
survey them. 
	
✓	You may also seek evaluation ratings from the bottom 100 users, and 
ask them why their usage is low.
	
One of the major questions that you may ask is about the voice quality of the 
VoIP call or an A/V conference. You may have users rate the quality from 1 to 
5 (5 being the highest). If you asked your users an open-ended question such 
as “How was the voice quality,” you may see answers like:
	
✓	I couldn’t hear clearly.
	
✓	I heard an echo.
	
✓	My speakers sounded funny.
Does that help you in monitoring or tracking the voice quality of your unified 
communications system? These highly subjective answers are hard to evalu­
ate and make it difficult to take any type of action. Each user is giving a sub­
jective answer that is clearly related to something very specific in the unique 
environment — speakers or headsets, background noise, or something else.
There is a better way to measure voice quality called absolute categorization 
scale (ACS). Users are asked a set of questions about their listening experi­
ence and rate their quality of experience from 1 to 5 (highest). These answers 
are then averaged and a mean opinion score (MOS) is calculated. The MOS 
then allows you to compare between groups, like the top 100 users and 
bottom 100 users in your company, and see what the MOSs are. If the top 
group gets an average of 3.5 and the bottom group gets an average MOS of 
2.1, you can summarize that the bottom group’s listening experience was not 
as good as the top group’s experience. You then can start looking for areas 
where you need to make adjustments or add capacity.
Monitoring server role has been populated with a series of algorithms to 
predict how users would rate the quality of experience based on a lot of 
research and analysis of data. Monitoring server categorizes MOSs based on 
these algorithms in the following categories:
	
✓	Listening MOS: Prediction of the wideband quality of an audio stream 
that a user is listening to. It takes into account the audio fidelity, distor­
tion, speech, and noise levels.

252
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
✓	Sending MOS: Prediction of the wideband quality of an audio stream 
sent from a user and looking at the audio fidelity, distortion, speech, and 
noise levels.
	
✓	Network MOS: Prediction of the wideband quality of an audio stream 
played to a user while looking at network factors only, including audio 
codec used, packet loss, packet errors, and jitter (variation in the delay 
time of packets arriving at their destination).
	
✓	Conversational MOS: Prediction of the narrowband quality of the audio 
stream played to a user. In this case, the mathematical algorithms look 
at how a large group of users would rate the quality of the connection 
for holding a conversation.
	
Narrowband refers to the audio codecs that use an 8 kHz sample rate. 
Wideband refers to the audio codecs that use a 16 kHz sample rate. Typically, 
telephone conversations are rated as narrowband.
The Monitoring server component is installed at the highest level of the 
organization, the Forest level. You should also install the Monitoring server 
report pack so you can take advantage of the built-in reports. Built-in reports 
retrieve and aggregate the CDR data collected in the SQL server database. 
This is the fastest and simplest way to get started with viewing and analyzing 
the data collected by the Monitoring server.
Monitoring server report pack
Out of the 12 pre-defined reports, 9 reports focused on the media quality 
and 3 CDR Activity Summary reports. Each report allows you additional fil­
tering capability to narrow down the scope to specific dates, users, type of 
media, and so forth. Figure 15-6 shows a list of the available reports from the 
Monitoring server.
For example, if you selected the Media Quality report known as UC-to-UC in 
Summary Trend Reports, you can filter the data by:
	
✓	Location: 
 
• Select all subnets 
 
• Select 1 or 2 specific subnets
	
✓	Media connection: 
 
• Direct
 
• Relay
 
• HTTP proxy

254
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
When you are interested in usage statistics for your organization’s uni­
fied communications system, the Monitoring Server Reports should be the 
first place you look. But if the data you are looking for is collected by the 
Archiving server or you just want to extract certain CDR data collected by 
the Monitoring server not included in the above reports, then look at the 
ArchivingCDrReporter.
	
Chapter 14 covers the ArchivingCDrReporter in detail, so please look at that 
chapter if you are interested in this tool.
Troubleshooting Unified Communications
No matter how much proactive monitoring and management you implement, 
some component of your unified communications environment may still fail.
Microsoft Management Console has a snap-in for the administration of Office 
Communications Server 2007 or R2 and has comprehensively integrated all 
of the components deployed in your unified communications environment 
under one roof. You can access all of the global settings that you have config­
ured at the Forest level as well as all of the settings for each individual role, 
such as front-end server, archiving server, and monitoring server.
The rest of this chapter covers useful troubleshooting tools.
Administrative tool or Event logs
Microsoft Office Communications Server provides the Administrative tool 
that shows you the ten latest events regardless of the event source or cat­
egory for a server role. The Administrative tool also makes it possible to look 
at events for any other server role by simply clicking the server that you are 
interested in. All the OCS server roles that you have deployed in your organi­
zation show up in the Administrative tool, and you can select event logs for 
any one of them. 
You can even use the Event Log filter to narrow the scope of the events. For 
example, you can filter on either
	
✓	Errors only
	
✓	Errors and warnings only 
	
	While troubleshooting a specific server or service that is not working, 
it is best to filter the events for errors only, and then focus on those 
events.

255
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
Validation wizard
During the installation of the Office Communications Server 2007, you had 
an option to run the Validation wizard, which analyzes and validates current 
configuration and connectivity to detect errors. It validates basic end-to-end 
scenarios and provides configuration recommendations to fix errors.
	
If you want to use the Validation wizard after installation, you can do so from 
the Office Communications Server 2007 or R2’s management console, as 
shown in Figure 15-7. Highlight the OCS in the left pane, and then scroll over 
to the right-window pane to see the available tasks. As you can see, you have 
many different choices to use the Validation wizard.
	
Figure 15-7: 
Validation 
wizard from 
OCS man-
agement 
console.
	
For example, if you want to check out end-to-end audio/videoconferencing 
functionality, you can select the A/V Conferencing Server from the right-
window pane. (I did that for illustration purposes.) The Validation wizard 
checked all the connectivity components for assessing the validity of A/V ser­
vices and created a report that provides a significant amount of details and 
shows success or failure of each internal component. As seen in Figure 15-8, 
the report for the lab installation shows success throughout.

If you run into any errors that look like connectivity issues between compo­
nents or between the client and server, you can run the Validation wizard on 
that server component to discover the possible underlying problem.
Office Communications 
Server Logging tool
This tool can be accessed from the OCS management console and allows the 
administrators to start and stop server logging activity, and then filter and 
view the logs to identify errors and what is recommended as a fix.
As shown in Figure 15-9, the Logging tool can be easily accessed from the 
management console by right-clicking on any server component, and then 
selecting Logging Tool. You can start a new debug session or restart an exist­
ing session.
Snooper
Snooper is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows administrators to 
summarize, search, and view client and server protocol and trace logs. Figure 
15-10 shows an example of the Snooper tool. Snooper can be used to view 
logs from the client or server components, and it will summarize protocol 
messages, identify diagnostic and connection-level events, and then display 
the full content.

257
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
Snooper can also be used to create reports from queries against the 
archiving or monitoring server SQL database. Snooper’s Reports menu offers 
this capability. The records can be filtered by user or specific attributes of 
the error message so the administrator can analyze the problems that a user 
is having. These types of overview information for all errors or specific types 
of errors can lead to proactively identifying problems before they can impact 
many users.

OCS Best Practices Analyzer
Administrators who want to determine the overall health of their unified 
communications system can use this tool proactively. Many administrators 
may be familiar with BPA for Microsoft Exchange server or SQL server. They 
all use the same framework and assist in identifying the readiness of the cur­
rent infrastructure for Office Communications Server. 
Here’s what a BPA does:
	
✓	Checks the readiness of your environment for installation of OCS
	
✓	Checks for compliance with Microsoft’s recommended best practices
	
✓	Highlights missing updates for components and how to obtain them

Deployment Validation Tool
What if you can test the connectivity for your VoIP calls between each one 
of your sites as well as assess the quality of the connections between those 
sites? It’s the same concept as your cell phone company testing connectivity 
everywhere it provides the service and insuring that the quality is excellent.
Well, recently released OCS 2007 R2 has added just the Deployment 
Validation tool (DVT) so you can do the same, proactively, and then assure 
your users regardless of where they are located that the voice quality will be 
excellent. (Think cell phone company ads that bombard us.)
DVT simulates a call between any two end-points (locations) that you specify, 
and you can rest assured that it will verify that a connection can be made 
between them. DVT also tests and reports the quality of that connection.
	
As a proactive administrator, you should plan to use this tool all the time so 
that you can assure your users that connectivity and quality of their voice 
calls will be excellent.
DVT uses an answering agent that the administrator needs to install. After 
the answering agent has been installed, anyone in the organization can just 
call it as if calling a colleague and test the voice quality. Say that you are on 
a business trip to China, and you will need to participate in a critical confer­
ence call that will use your company’s unified communications system. You 

259
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
need to make sure that when you dial into the conference your connection 
and quality will be adequate. You may call the answering agent a few minutes 
before the actual conference. The answering agent responds like an answer­
ing machine and prompts the user to record a message. The answering agent 
plays the recorded message back so the user can judge the voice quality.
As an administrator, you can use the answering agent to occasionally test the 
connectivity and voice quality between locations. If you can’t connect, then 
review the event logs.
Enterprise Voice Route Helper
Enterprise Voice Route Helper can be easily installed by installing the OCS 
2007 or R2 resource kit. Route Helper is a terrific graphical tool that allows 
administrators to test the configuration of the Enterprise Voice location pro­
file, normalization rules, voice policies, usage, and routes by actually testing 
the various user scenarios that they plan to support.
First, when you open Route Helper, it shows the configuration that you have 
implemented so far (see Figure 15-11). This is a great way to validate the dif­
ferent scenarios for Enterprise Voice that you plan to support and make sure 
that you have configured all the normalization rules and policies that you will 
need and have attached them to the appropriate usage records.
	
Figure 15-11: 
Enterprise 
Voice Route 
Helper 
shows the 
current con-
figuration.
	
Route Helper also enables you to test each call scenario by clicking the Ad 
hoc Test tab and typing the different ways your users will make calls. For 
example, they may dial a 5-digit local extension and expect it to go to a col­
league. If you typed a valid 5-digit extension, you not only will see that it 
works, but Route Helper will also identify the actual user’s SIP address that 
the number belongs to so you can verify it.

260
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
For example, the test lab has a normalization rule called “Main Office 
International Calls” that will be used when someone from the U.S. dials a 
number starting with 011. To test out this scenario, I typed in 011445874366 
in the Ad hoc Test window for the dialed number. As Figure 15-12 shows, 
Route Helper checked all the normalization rules that were configured and 
highlighted which rule would be applied, which route will be used that 
shows the associated gateway, and what normalized number will be dialed as 
+445874366.
	
Figure 15-12: 
Route 
Helper Ad 
hoc Test for 
international 
number.
	
To be sure that all the different test cases will work appropriately, you 
can enter all your different scenarios and test out your configuration. I did 
that for illustration purposes to show the various potential combination of 
numbers that users may dial and ran them using Route Helper. Figure 15-13 
shows each different combination of numbers tested and identifies the nor­
malization rule, usage, policy, route, and gateway that will be used to dial the 
number. Finally, it tells you whether the dialed number passed through the 
configuration.
	
Figure 15-13: 
Route 
Helper test 
cases 
scenario.
	

261
 Chapter 15: Management and Troubleshooting
If a user calls your help desk and says, “I dialed this number,” and gives you 
the exact combination of what was actually dialed, you can run a test through 
Route Helper and identify where the exact problem is occurring, such as 
whether it is with a normalization rule, policy, or usage. 
Escalate to vendor product support
As a last resort, when everything else fails and you have been unable to 
figure out what is causing the server or service down situation, contact the 
unified communications vendor’s product support. Depending on your spe­
cific licensing, you may receive vendor support for a limited time or your 
company may have signed a specific and longer support agreement with the 
vendor. 
Most unified communications vendors that support professionals have exten­
sive databases (knowledgebases) that document issues faced by other cus­
tomers, and those vendors could easily search and make recommendations. 
Many unified communications vendors are available 24/7 and stay on the line 
while you apply their recommendations.
Another great advantage of unified communications vendors is that they use 
their own software solutions to enable remote desktop sharing; that means 
they can take over your server, if you permit them, and can actually look at 
the server configuration firsthand and apply diagnostic tools or be able to try 
different solutions.

Chapter 16
Customizing Unified 
Communications
In This Chapter
▶	Creating custom client-side solutions 
▶	Developing server-side customizations
▶	Demonstrating capabilities of customization
O
ne of the biggest benefits of unified communications and software-
powered VoIP is the ability to integrate the features into other applica­
tions and extend the functionality of unified communications in ways that 
can’t be achieved with traditional communications. Rather than defining your 
business processes based on what the communications system is capable of, 
you can modify the communications system to meet the needs of your busi­
ness processes.
The major unified communications platforms include the capability to 
develop custom solutions that either
	
✓	Use the unified communications features 
	
✓	Extend the functionality
Microsoft and IBM, in particular, being software-based solutions, provide 
exceptional platforms for custom unified communications solutions. Cisco, 
Avaya, and other unified communications systems also have software 
components and provide the Software Development Kits and Application 
Programming Interface so the software developers can customize them.
This chapter looks at the tools used to create unified communications cus­
tomization, and examines a few custom unified communications applications 
as examples of what is possible.

264
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Creating Custom Client-Side Solutions
You can use the SDK and API tools from unified communications vendors to 
	
✓	Develop custom presence states.
	
✓	Add tabs to the unified communications client application that inte­
grates with other data or applications.
	
✓	Create new features. 
To see what is possible, take a look at the tools available from Microsoft to 
develop custom solutions on the client side.
Microsoft has a variety of SDKs available for working with OCS 2007 and OCS 
2007 R2. Which one you end up using depends on what your goal is. You begin by 
answering some key questions that will help you choose the appropriate tools.
	
✓	Invoke Communicator from other applications. You can use the 
Communicator Automation APIs to leverage the Microsoft Office 
Communicator application and invoke Communicator functionality from 
within other programs. 
	
	This approach requires less code because you are simply interfacing 
with the existing tools. 
	
	With these APIs, you can:
 
• Sign into or log out of Communicator
 
• Display a list of contacts, including current presence status
 
• Show profile information
 
• Manage contacts and groups
 
• Initiate instant messaging, voice, or video sessions
 
• Transmit text to an instant messaging session
 
• Manipulate the size and position of the Communicator interface 
window
	
✓	Embed unified communications features in applications. If you need 
to integrate Office Communications Server features into other applica­
tions and want to include a rich feature set, you can use the Unified 
Communications Client API (UCCA).
	
	Using UCCA you can add things like presence state and instant messag­
ing functionality directly into applications. 
	
	UCCA essentially enables the same features and functions as the 
Communicator Automation APIs, but builds the functionality directly 
into a custom application rather than invoking the Communicator client 
externally.

265
 Chapter 16: Customizing Unified Communications
	
✓	Customize presence states in Communicator. Communicator displays 
presence with such states as 
 
• Available
 
• Busy
 
• Do Not Disturb 
	
	But you may prefer to show your presence state with other conditions, 
such as
 
• Working from Home
 
• Meeting with Customer
 
• Presenting 
	
	Using a customized XML configuration file, you can do it. Check 
it out at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/
dd819946(office.13).aspx. 
	
✓	Develop custom tabs for Communicator. With Communicator 
Extensions, you can create custom tabs that appear within the Microsoft 
Office Communicator software. The custom tabs extend functional­
ity and add features not already present in Communicator. Check 
it out at http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/
dd425110(office.13).aspx.
	
	Communicator Extensions leverage an Internet Explorer control and 
transmit the SIP URI of the signed-in user and/or other designated con­
tacts. With the SIP URI details, the tabs can be used to customize the 
information displayed for the specific user(s). In Figure 16-2 (later in 
this chapter), on the bottom, you can Assign, White-List and Reload 
each using tab customizations. Each one of these tabs is linked to other 
actions which could be a hyperlink.
	
	Custom tabs can also be created by 
 
• Using Registry modifications
 
• Developing custom XML config files for the Communicator client
	
✓	Create Web-based customization. You can leverage Communicator Web 
Access (CWA). CWA is a Web-based version of the Communicator soft­
ware built on AJAX. Because it is Web-based and built on AJAX, it allows 
you to manipulate or build on the Web-based functionality.
	
	With the Unified Communications AJAX API, you can embed the follow­
ing unified communications functionality into Web pages:
 
• Contacts and contact management
 
• Initiation or acceptance of instant messaging and audio/videocon­
ference sessions
 
• Display and modification of presence status

266
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
	
To use the Unified Communications AJAX API, you must have CWA enabled.
Developing Server-Side Customizations
It is also possible to manipulate the way that Office Communications Server 
routes communications or responds to events. Again, Microsoft provides 
a variety of tools to accomplish this, and which one you ultimately use 
depends on what you are trying to achieve. Decide whether you want to
	
✓	Create custom routing and logging of messages. If you want to modify 
message routing or develop custom logging and archiving solutions, you 
can develop custom plug-ins for OCS 2007 using the OCS Server APIs. 
The OCS Server API uses Microsoft SIP Processing Language (MSSPL) to 
enable you to alter message routing and control.
	
✓	Develop an auto-responder bot. You can create a bot, an automated 
response system that can respond to specific events or messages, by 
using the Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA). Using this 
functionality, you can automate the response to frequently asked ques­
tions or gather standard information from a user or customer. For 
example, you may have seen an online chat tool on many Web sites that 
allows you to chat online with a customer service person, such as on 
Dell.com. Before you get to a live person, the automated bot may ask 
you general questions about your name, e-mail, phone number, and the 
issue you want to discuss. If you describe your issue appropriately, the 
automated bot can find the expert who can answer your questions after 
checking the expert’s presence to make sure that he or she is online and 
available (see Figure 16-1).
	
	There is a significant difference between UCMA 1.0 and the UCMA 2.0 
Core functionality available in OCS 2007 R2.
	
✓	Customize tools with speech recognition. Using the Speech Server Core 
API (SSCA), you can develop custom solutions that include speech rec­
ognition and interactive voice response (IVR) capabilities.
	
Figure 16-1: 
Expert chat 
on Dell.com.
	

267
 Chapter 16: Customizing Unified Communications
	
You must have a Microsoft Speech Server installed in order to make use of the 
speech recognition or IVR functionality.
Microsoft has a variety of APIs that work with different platforms and serv­
ers and provide varying levels of functionality for developing custom unified 
communications solutions. Table 16-1 details the APIs that are available and 
which OCS 2007 version(s) they are compatible with.

Demonstrating Capabilities 
of Customization
You have virtually endless possibilities to develop custom modifications to 
the unified communications functionality to create business processes and 
scenarios that enhance productivity and help users operate more efficiently.
The unified communications platform can be exploited and extended by 
third-party vendors. That means that a variety of applications are available to 
enable you to expand the functionality of your unified communications plat­
form without having to develop the solutions yourself.
Let’s take a look at some examples of third-party unified communications 
applications.

Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
ETC Time Tracker for OCS
ETC Time Tracker for OCS is an add-on application from Enabling 
Technologies that integrates with Office Communicator to automatically 
track the time a user spends on it using any mode of communication: IM/VoIP 
Call, video call, and so forth.
Attorneys and executives in the Professional Services business can use ETC 
Time Tracker for OCS to track their time. Incoming and outgoing calls/IM and 
video are all tracked automatically. This eliminates the lag time between employ­
ees turning in their paperwork and Cash Flow for the Firm. In rough financial 
times, many organizations are asking for increased accuracy in their bills. OCS 
Time Tracker enables the company to provide precise and timely accounting to 
its clients. Figure 16-2 shows the client’s Communicator screen on which it can 
identify the client and matter/project that the call should be billed to.
	
Figure 16-2:

ETC Time Tracker for OCS includes the following features:
	
✓	For In-coming communications:
 
• Data lookup
 
• OCS/Outlook contact lookup

269
 Chapter 16: Customizing Unified Communications
 
• MS CRM/Sharepoint lookup
 
• Third-party client project database
 
• Match recent client projects
 
• Create/use existing client projects 
	
✓	For Out-going communications:
 
• Click to dial a contact from Outlook/OCS
 
• Click to dial from context menus in Outlook
 
• Click to dial from third-party directory
ics Office
ComputerTalk has integrated its ice contact center with Microsoft Office 
Communications Server 2007 R2 to add new unified communications features 
and enhancements to the 18 different modules that include such features as 
	
✓	A comprehensive multichannel contact center 
	
✓	Speech interactive voice response (IVR)
	
✓	Call recording
	
✓	Automated dialing
The ice contact center provides computer telephony integration and multi-
channel contacts by phone, fax, e-mail, instant messaging (IM), and Web chat. 
Available as SaaS or CPE, it also supports both standard telephony and VoIP 
using standards-compliant session initiation protocol (SIP) for multimedia 
communication sessions. Embedded predictive dialing allows for effective 
outbound campaigns. ice also integrates with third-party applications such 
as Workforce Management and CRM software, giving contact-center agents 
an in-depth view of customers’ purchases and service histories.
By integrating ice with Office Communications Server 2007 R2, ComputerTalk 
clients gain presence awareness — the capability to see when and how other 
users of the communications system are available for communication — and 
several other capabilities, including call management. The integration with 
Microsoft Office Communicator gives users the capability to 
	
✓	Place, hold, and transfer calls
	
✓	Consult with others
	
✓	Conference
	
✓	Manage multiple simultaneous calls

270
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
Calls can be placed directly from the Microsoft Office Outlook communica­
tion and collaboration client. IM sessions can also be placed into queues 
and routed to the correct experts within the enterprise. Check it out at www.

Message Waiting Indicator
I spoke about Exchange Unified Messaging in Chapter 4. Exchange 2007 
Unified Messaging added voicemail and in-bound fax transmissions to the 
types of messages that users receive in their Outlook Inbox. This voicemail 
functionality created by the Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging role provides a 
useful and rich experience, including such features as Outlook Voice Access 
and speech-enabled auto attendants. However, the Exchange voicemail 
system doesn’t light up your PBX desk phone’s message-waiting light.
Enabling Technologies created etcMWI. For some organizations, particu­
larly those organizations in which some users are assigned phones but not 
computers, a fully functional Message Waiting Indicator is mission critical. 
ETCDevCorp’s etcMWI version 3.1 is designed to solve this problem by using 
technologies native to Exchange 2007 and utilizing the existing VoIP infra­
structure required by an Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging implementation.
In addition to MWI, the etcMWI 3.1 platform provides additional functionality 
to an Exchange 2007 Unified Messaging installation. These features provide 
text or voice notification to end users when the user receives a new voice­
mail. Figure 16-3 depicts the message flow.

 Chapter 16: Customizing Unified Communications
OCS for Blackboard Learn Platform
OCS for the Blackboard Learn Platform (OCS for BB) is a communications 
suite that brings together the strengths of two products:
	
✓	Blackboard Learn Platform (BB) is a sophisticated Web application that 
enables students, teachers, and administrators to communicate and 
share information.
	
✓	Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS) is a communications 
tool that focuses on unified communications and makes it easier for 
people to connect and share information.
The OCS for Blackboard Learn Platform solution from Enabling 
Technologies brings these two applications together to enable students, 
teachers, and administrators to dynamically connect, share, and communi­
cate. Suppose that a student needs to contact a professor or administrator 
at the school or vice versa. OCS for Blackboard enables presence awareness 
and automatically populates the student’s client with contacts organized by 
classes or administrators tabs, as shown in Figure 16-4.

Password Reset
Gold Systems’ Password Reset solution offers a convenient anywhere, 
anytime user interface, a secure caller authentication, and back-end reset 
functionality. Users simply call in to reset their passwords as they normally 
would. But now, the entire process is driven by self-service voice technology.
For additional security, the option of Speaker Verification (voice biometric) 
can be added — for the entire organization or just for specific groups that 
require a stricter authentication policy. The Gold Systems Password Reset 

272
Part III: Implementing Unified Communications 
solution also provides a Web-based alternative, allowing users to automati­
cally reset their passwords using a secure network interface. Gold Systems 
even supports multiple languages in both the voice and Web interfaces.
	
✓	Quick Enrollment: Password Reset users first enroll over the Web by 
answering a few challenge questions. For the speaker verification option, 
a voiceprint is created over the phone.
	
✓	Secure Authentication: When a user forgets or misplaces a system pass­
word, he or she calls into the application and is identified by providing 
the correct responses to a random sampling of challenge questions 
asked during enrollment.
	
✓	Easy Administration: Web-based administration is easy to set up. You 
can choose the number of enrollment questions, configure your challenge 
questions, set the temporary password activation time period, change 
temporary password attributes, provide access information for Active 
Directory settings, and monitor the performance of the application.
Gold Systems has versions of the Password Reset application available for 
both the Microsoft Office Communications Server platform and the Cisco 
Unified Communications platform.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
I
f you keep this book in the bathroom, the chapters in 
this section are the ones that you’ll read the most. 
Each chapter consists of ten (more or less) things that 
are worth knowing about various aspects of unified 
communications.

Chapter 17
Ten Advantages of Unified 
Communications
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the benefits
▶	Taking advantage of unified communications features
▶	Maximizing value of unified communication
C
ommunication is nothing new. Consumers and enterprises alike have 
been communicating just fine using phones, fax machines, e-mail, 
instant messaging, and other methods for decades. The content of the com­
munications may not always be of the best quality, but people understand 
how to use the technology.
What’s the big deal with unified communications, then? What is it about uni­
fied communications that changes the playing field? This chapter addresses 
the advantages and benefits of unified communications that 
	
✓	Set it apart from traditional communication methods
	
✓	Provide value for organizations that embrace this new era of 
communications. 
Presence
Presence is the magic glue that binds unified communications. It’s one of the 
things that separates unified communications from traditional communica­
tions and helps users to communicate more effectively and more efficiently. 
	
Presence is essentially the user’s status or availability. 

276
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The method varies by vendor or platform, but presence provides a visual 
notification that identifies whether a given user is currently available for 
communication, as shown in Figure 17-1. 
	
Figure 17-1: 
Microsoft 
Office 
Commun- 
icator uses 
colored 
circles to 
display 
presence 
information.
	
With traditional communication methods that don’t integrate with each other, 
and don’t provide or update presence information, interruptions can come 
from anywhere. You might be on the phone, receiving e-mail, with your mobile 
phone ringing, while carrying on two separate instant messaging conversa­
tions. Presence can’t eliminate these distractions by itself, but if a user knows 
that you are already on a call and not currently available, he or she will (hope­
fully) find a more appropriate method or time to communicate with you.
Increase Efficiency
Unified communications enables you to communicate more efficiently. It 
isn’t efficient or effective to send an e-mail, place multiple phone calls, leave 
a voicemail, send an instant message, and attempt to send a text message in 
order to track down a user. Unified communications helps by 
	
✓	Providing presence information to notify you of the person’s status or 
availability
	
✓	Unifying the various methods of communication

277
 Chapter 17: Ten Advantages of Unified Communications
No matter how you choose to communicate with someone, they can receive 
and respond to that communication with a single device or application.
Some communications are simply more urgent than others while some can 
wait. Unified communications helps to harness all of the various communica­
tions methods and ensure that you can communicate with users anytime and 
anywhere. If you need to reach someone, and you know they are in a meeting 
or they are already on a phone call, then you can send an instant message or 
make a call straight to voicemail so they receive the message without being 
interrupted.
Improve Productivity
It’s a common business situation: You’re reading a document, and you have a 
question. With traditional communication, contacting that person can be dis­
tracting and time-wasting. For example, you may have to go to the company 
intranet site to search for the individual’s phone number, and then dial the 
number and hope the person is there to answer the phone. 
Unified communications improves productivity by integrating with applica­
tions, and providing a seamless communications experience. For example, 
a document can display presence information for the user who created it. 
When you have a question about the document, you can determine whether 
the person is available with a glance. Whether or not they are available, you 
can initiate a phone call, an e-mail, or an instant message with a click or two, 
rather than using a separate directory in another application to find the 
contact information, then using the contact information in yet another 
application.
Team Collaboration
Most organizations already use voice conferencing to conduct meetings. 
Many have also embraced online desktop-sharing or white-boarding tools 
for conducting meetings. Some companies use videoconferencing. Setting 
up these sessions is often a cumbersome and tedious process though that 
requires opening or logging into separate applications.
With unified communications, these synergistic collaborations can occur on 
the fly with a click of the mouse. You can select multiple contacts, then start 
a group chat session or desktop-sharing session to discuss ideas and collabo­
rate on effective solutions. 

278
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
	
Some unified communications platforms allow you to select contacts to invite 
to an audio or videoconference; the unified communications software then 
places calls to each user, to connect them with the conference. 
One Number, One Client
One of the most cumbersome issues of traditional communications is how 
many available options there are. 
	
It isn’t uncommon for an individual to have separate accounts and devices for 
	
✓	Work phone
	
✓	Home phone
	
✓	Mobile phone
	
✓	Work instant messaging
	
✓	Personal instant messaging
	
✓	Work e-mail
	
✓	Personal e-mail
That means that an average individual might need to check seven different 
communications tools to stay on top of the communications coming in. 
Unified communications seeks to converge those various technologies to 
a single device or a single interface. It isn’t perfect yet, and it varies from 
vendor to vendor, but with unified communications you can redirect your 
phone calls from several numbers so that they all arrive at one phone. Your 
voicemail, e-mail, and instant messaging communications can all be stored in 
a single repository. 
It’s also a boon when you want to reach someone. Unified communications 
provides you with the technology to do that from a single tool. Most unified 
communications platforms offer a client application that provides the instant 
messaging interface, but also enables you to send an e-mail, place a phone 
call, or start a videoconference with a click or two. 
Communicate Anywhere
Interactive voice response systems, like the one provided by Microsoft 
Exchange with Unified Messaging, enable users to access their e-mail, calen­
dar, contacts, and other Exchange services from any phone, anywhere in the 

279
 Chapter 17: Ten Advantages of Unified Communications
world, at any time. The system will read your e-mail messages to you, and 
you can dictate e-mails or changes to your calendar; the system will send out 
on your behalf.
As cool as that is, it’s better if you can simply use the unified communica­
tions functions directly from your mobile phone. Many of the unified commu­
nications platforms include some sort of client application that works with a 
mobile phone. You can view presence information for your contacts, commu­
nicate via instant messaging, send e-mails, make and receive calls, and more. 
Mobile client applications like this allow you to stay connected while you’re 
on the go, and ensure that you receive all of your communications wherever 
you are.
Extend Functionality
Unified communications and software-powered voice platforms open up a 
whole new world of potential for applications that extend the functionality 
of unified communications. Organizations aren’t limited by what the product 
can do out of the box. Using software APIs, third-party vendors and in-house 
developers can create tools and utilities that leverage the capabilities of the 
unified communications platform.
For example: 
	
✓	Gold Systems has created a tool that leverages Microsoft Unified 
Communications and Microsoft Speech Server to provide an automated 
voice response system to enable users to reset their own passwords. 
	
✓	Evangelyze Communications has an entire suite of products, including 
 
• SmartChat, which extends presence data and instant messaging 
capabilities to an organization’s web site
 
• SmartSIP, which allows Microsoft Office Communications Server 
2007 R2 to be connected with any SIP device or SIP phone and any 
SIP trunk provider
These are just a few examples of what’s possible when building on the core 
functionality of the unified communications platform. Rather than figuring 
out how to develop business processes that work with the communications 
technology, you can develop communications technology that supports and 
enhances your business processes.

280
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Single Infrastructure
From an architecture standpoint, unified communications means converging 
voice and data communications to a single infrastructure. That represents 
a cost savings for organizations that only need to run cabling for the IP net­
work to each desktop, rather than having separate voice and data cabling 
and jacks for each user. 
The converged network also allows for more efficient monitoring, and 
enables the IT department to maintain the voice network more efficiently. 
Troubleshooting and repair are limited to one network, too.
Retention and Compliance
There are a number of regulatory and industry compliance mandates that 
organizations might be required to abide by. 
	
✓	Publicly traded companies are covered by Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX). 
	
✓	Organizations that deal with medical data and health insurance must 
comply with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). 
	
✓	Companies that accept, process, transmit, or store credit card trans­
action data must comply with PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data 
Security Standard). 
These are just three compliance standards. There are many more.
With traditional enterprise communications that could mean having to moni­
tor and retain communications from two or three different networks or appli­
cations. Unified communications, and unified messaging, simplify regulatory 
compliance and data retention by storing all communications in one reposi­
tory to begin with.
Minimize Travel Expenses
One of the largest expenses for many companies is travel:
	
✓	Executives travel to branch offices for strategy meetings.
	
✓	Salespeople travel to meet with customers. 
	
✓	Employees travel to partner, supplier, and customer locations for a vari­
ety of reasons.

 Chapter 17: Ten Advantages of Unified Communications
But travel is expensive. Companies have to cover airfare, rental cars, hotel 
lodging, meals, and other miscellaneous travel expenses. Those costs add up 
quickly, and don’t include other intangible costs: The employee is less pro­
ductive during the hours they spend 
	
✓	In an airport
	
✓	On an airplane
	
✓	Driving from site to site
The synergy of collaborating and working together is important, though. With 
unified communications, organizations can conduct virtual meetings that 
allow individuals from anywhere in the world to work together. With video­
conferencing virtual meetings can even retain the face-to-face factor that can 
enhance communications and collaboration.

Chapter 18
Ten Events You Shouldn’t Miss
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the benefits
▶	Searching for unified communications events
I
n this chapter, I review the major events that cover unified communica­
tions that you may find useful in your evaluation or if you have already 
implemented unified communications, keeping yourself updated on latest 
upgrades on both software and hardware fronts. I discuss two types of 
events, trade-show and conferences, as well as training events that you may 
find interesting.
I recommend that you carefully evaluate these events as well as search for 
local/regional events. You may visit any of the vendors’ web sites, and then 
search on events — search for training provided through the vendors as well 
as your local training centers. Many vendors provide free technical training.
Understanding the Benefits
After reading about all the magic that unified communications can spread, 
it may look like the golden rainbow — someone’s dream or fantasy. But it 
isn’t a dream, it is real. Yes, you can get rid of that clunky old phone from 
your desk once and for all. Yes, the playing field has changed now and we are 
moving into a whole new era of technology that will revolutionize your com­
munications and collaboration paradigm.
How do I learn more, you ask? How do I see it all in action? Well, you can 
invite the vendors that I cover in Chapter 19 and have them give you all the 
sales and marketing hype, show you demos of their products, and tell you 
why their products are the best. You can read a lot of books, articles, and 
industry pundits’ analysis of the unified communications solutions, and then 
make up your mind.

284
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Or, you can visit a few major events that cover unified communications and 
explore the unified communications solutions with your own eyes and ears at 
your own pace, and then decide which ones would make your short-list. This 
way, you will have narrowed down the field of vendors that can meet your 
company’s business and technical requirements.
TechEd
Microsoft hosts this premier event annually throughout the world: in North 
America, India, Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and China. 
TechEd provides you an opportunity to participate in technical and business 
oriented sessions for all major Microsoft server and client products. Just to 
get a flavor of what it is all about, you may check out the 2009 event that was 
held in Orlando, Florida, at http://microsoft.com/events/teched2009.
Cisco Live
Cisco hosts its premier event annually; the 2009 event concluded in San 
Francisco. It was a very well attended event and covered all major Cisco 
products, including unified communications. You can get free access to some 
of the information that was shared at the event at the Cisco Live virtual web 
site: http://www.cisco-live.com/attendees/virtual. You can get access to all 
the sessions and more virtually for a small subscription.
VoiceCon
VoiceCon will help you learn the roadmap for migrating to the next genera­
tion of IP telephony and unified communications while maximizing your 
investment in enterprise communications. You will find all the major vendors 
that I have highlighted in Chapter 19 at VoiceCon. VoiceCon is hosted twice 
a year in the U.S.: Orlando in March and San Francisco in November (Avaya, 
Siemens, and Polycom have already announced their sponsorship). They will 
start VoiceCon Europe in 2010. Typical topics discussed are:
	
✓	Unified Communications
	
✓	IP-PBX Systems and Architectures
	
✓	IP Telephony/Converged Network ROI

Microsoft Exchange Connections/
Windows Connections
If you are an IT professional focused on messaging and e-mail technologies, 
then you may want to consider attending this event that now combines with 
Windows Connections, SharePoint Connections, ASP Connections, Visual 
Studio Connections, and SQL Server Connections. Here is your opportunity 
to learn and network with not only the vendors but also the industry experts, 
authors, and your colleagues from other companies. The Expo hall provides 
an opportunity to see and hear from vendors that deliver new add-ons to 
your unified communications solutions as well as the latest upgrades from 
major vendors. One of the highlights of the last Connections conference I 
attended was the Q&A session that allowed me to get my tough questions 
answered.
Cisco Networkers
Cisco’s annual user community conference is called “Cisco Networkers” and 
is held in various cities around the world. It’s a great way to meet and learn 
from your local communities of users how they are implementing Cisco tech­
nologies as well as to get trained and learn about the latest products and 
updates from Cisco.
Cisco engineers and developers are available at these events to deliver inten­
sive technical training and discuss the latest updates to the products. 
Cisco IP Communications Training
Cisco has been a pioneer in delivering IP communications, and thus you 
may want to check out the opportunities to get technical training in Cisco’s 
IP-based communications products.
Cisco delivers these training offerings through its authorized Cisco Learning 
partners worldwide and also enables you to get Cisco certifications in vari­
ous technologies. If you were looking at Cisco IP telephony, Cisco’s unified 
messaging solution — Unity or their unified communications solution — I 
recommend you check out training available at Cisco’s web site or look for 
local authorized Cisco learning centers.

IBM Unified Communications Training
IBM’s unified communications offerings include the Lotus Notes e-mail 
system as well as the instant messaging and audio, videoconferencing solu­
tion called Sametime. Many organizations may have Lotus Notes as their 

288

Chapter 19
Ten Tools You Should Have
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the benefits
▶	Selecting great unified communications tools
I
n this section, I review the hardware devices that provide the best quality 
experience when using audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing or making 
VoIP-based calls. I selected tools that vendors have certified and approved to 
best work with their software solutions so the combination will provide you 
the best quality.
Understanding the Benefits
Throughout the book, you read about what unified communications is and 
how it enables convergence of all your communications modes into a single 
seamless interface. Most vendors call this interface Communicator, and you 
install it on your desktop or laptop so you can 
	
✓	Send an instant message.
	
✓	Check presence.
	
✓	Engage in audio-, video-, or Web-conferencing.
	
✓	Use the existing network for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) calls.
If you are using a standard desktop phone, you will expect a certain standard 
of voice quality when you switch over to VoIP for all your audio-, video-, Web-
conferencing, and calling needs. If you currently use some form of hosted 
Web-conferencing, then you are familiar with using a Webcam or a headset. 
Obviously when you start using the new unified communications platform, 
you expect to start with tools that provide you the same or better quality 
than you previously had.

290
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
I already highlighted many benefits of a unified communications platform. It 
is critical to understand that you can’t reap the unified communications ben­
efits without the right equipment.
For example, you should start using the new unified communications plat­
form to conduct audio- and videoconferences and reduce or eliminate your 
third-party audio-bridge and videoconferencing costs. To do that, you need 
high-quality audio headsets or Webcams or speakerphones in conference 
rooms that integrate with your unified communications software platform. 
Investing in the appropriate hardware tools will quickly reduce or eliminate 
external third-party costs.
Unified Communications Tools
As you may recognize, I focus on hardware devices — tools that allow you to 
reap the benefits of your unified communications implementation and pro­
vide you with the same or better audio and video quality that you had before 
unified communications.
USB phones
Now that you have a unified communications solution available, you may be 
ready to replace your old desk phone with a USB phone device that directly 
plugs in to your desktop or laptop. These phones are specially designed and 
optimized to work with Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 and are manu­
factured by LG-Nortel (IP8501) and Polycom (CX-200).
If you are used to having a device that looks and works like a phone, then 
USB phones may fit the bill. If you need a dial pad, then check out the IP 
phones described later. Because you are integrating USB phones with your 
Communicator client, I recommend that you use the Communicator for dial­
ing. The majority of the time, you will select someone from your contact list 
whom you want to call, so you won’t even need to dial a number. I like the 
voicemail indicator that tells me I have voicemail waiting, just like my old 
phone, and I often use the speakerphone for long meetings.
These aren’t good travel phones. If you travel a lot and want to carry a por­
table phone, Polycom’s CX-100 is easy to tote in a jacket pocket, a purse, a 
laptop bag, and so forth.
Price: $115–$145

291
 Chapter 19: Ten Tools You Should Have
IP phones
Even though you have a unified communications solution, you may prefer the 
look and feel of a traditional phone, including the dial pad. Such phones are 
known as IP phones; they take advantage of your data network and plug into 
a network port.
IP phones are full-function phones with full-size handsets, standard phone 
bases, and dial pads — not meant to travel with.
Cisco IP phones
Cisco is an IP-phone pioneer, delivering its IP-PBX known as Cisco Unified 
Call Manager that integrates with Cisco Unified Presence Server. Cisco IP 
phones are designed and optimized for the Cisco Personal Communicator. 
Cisco also provides video-phones.
You can look up details about them on the website at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/voicesw/ps6788/phones/ps379/ps9900/
data_sheet_c78-504890.html
Microsoft IP phones
IP phones described below have been specially designed and optimized to 
work with Microsoft Office Communicator 2007. The specifications for these 
phones were defined by Microsoft, and LG-Nortel (IP8540) and Polycom (CX-
700) manufactured them.
Both of these models give you a full-function phone with the added benefit 
of a 5.7-inch LCD color touch screen that displays all your contacts. Touch a 
contact’s entry, and your call is made!
These phones are meant to be used in your office. A big plus is that they con­
nect to the network, not your PC, so they can be stand-alone phones on your 
desk and still get you connected with your colleagues via a single touch.
Price: $466–$549
Speakerphones
Some unified communications-enabled users prefer a full-function phone on 
their desk, and others may prefer a high-quality speakerphone with a built-in 
microphone to make and receive VoIP calls using their Communicator client. 
Both options are available; it’s a matter of individual preference whether you 
like a headset or a speakerphone on your desk.

292
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
	
Many people in sales or marketing positions prefer headsets to a phone.
Once again, Microsoft defined the specifications for the vendors to manufac­
ture these speakerphones designed and optimized for either small groups 
or large groups in a conference room. Some of the speakerphones described 
below can easily connect to a user’s desktop or laptop with USB for indi­
vidual use. 
ClearOne Chat170
The design of this speakerphone works great for a small group of users in a 
conference room or even for individual use.
Price: $329
Plantronics MCD 100-M
Microphone pickup is great from across a room with this speakerphone, and 
the people on the other end of the call experience great audio clarity.
Price: $119–$148
Polycom CX100
CX-100 easily fits in a jacket pocket or laptop bag. Pickup range is great even 
when I walk around in my home office or hotel room while in a conference 
call. I recommend this for the road-warrior.
Price: $119
Polycom CX5000
One of the best designs for group audio/videoconferencing, this model 
should be used with Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007. Your remote partici­
pants will get a panoramic view of the entire conference room. It’s meant for 
large conference rooms with a table in the center. It doesn’t work well if the 
room is set up like a classroom or an auditorium.
Price: $3,300–$4,299
Handsets
Some people absolutely need a dial pad and the flexibility of movement so 
manufacturers have designed handsets that integrate the power of the uni­
fied communications with corded handsets.

293
 Chapter 19: Ten Tools You Should Have
Jabra Dial 520 USB Handset
Because some users absolutely have to have a dial pad, this handset fulfills 
that need. It offers a cell-phone style handset with an easy-to-use dial pad 
that connects to a laptop or desktop with a USB cord.
Price: $45
Corded headsets
Depending on your users’ preferences, you can select one of these unified 
communications tools to ensure that they get the best quality experience 
when they use their computers to make calls. Even though various users in 
your company may prefer a USB phone, a corded headset, or a Bluetooth 
headset, your one-time investment for each user will pay off in the long run; it 
may even allow you to get rid of the traditional phones on every desk.
	
If you are in sales or marketing and on the phone a lot with customers, or if 
you like to get up and stretch while you are on a phone call, you may prefer 
something like the Jabra GN2000 NC — especially with its reasonable price 
point. It ranges from $67 to $120. You can even answer or end a call while you 
are standing or stretching by using the in-line hook-switch on the cord.
Bluetooth headsets
Bluetooth headsets are among the most practical devices because they pro­
vide complete freedom for you to multi-task. You can walk around freely while 
speaking and use your hands to check something on the computer, in a book, 
or among papers. As an added bonus, you get the best of both worlds — a 
headset for your mobile phone and Communicator.
Jabra M5390 USB
When I tested the Jabra headset, I was able to easily connect it with my 
smartphone and Communicator and switch between them. Jabra offers the 
farthest range from the base without loss of quality.
Price: $179
LG-Nortel IP 8502
IP 8502 differentiates itself by providing a presence indicator. But the range 
isn’t as good as the Jabra M5390.
Price: $175

294
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Wireless headsets
Jabra GN9350 OC
If you are on the phone all day at your office, you will need a long battery life 
or talk time. Jabra GN9350 may be for you if you are office-bound and want a 
larger coverage area so that you can walk around while speaking.
Portable Webcams
When you start using a unified communications solution for all your com­
munications and collaboration needs, one of the biggest benefits is the reduc­
tion or elimination of travel for your employees. To really make that work, 
you need to invest in good-quality Webcams or purchase laptops with built-in 
Webcams.
Both Cisco and Microsoft have announced support for VGA and high-
definition with their unified communications solutions; it would be worth­
while to check out those Web cameras for top execs or to place portable 
Webcams in exec conference rooms.
Logitech QuickCam 3000 for Business
I like the VGA video (640 x 480 pixels) quality at a price point around $25, but 
with one caution for travelers: This one doesn’t pack well in a laptop bag.
Price: $25
Microsoft LifeCam Show
I was impressed with the crisp quality of the picture I saw when my colleague 
at Microsoft told me he was using the LifeCam Show. So I checked out the 
specs and realized that it has a 2.0 megapixel camera, and that explained the 
picture quality. He also said it was easy to travel with.
Price: $79
Microsoft LifeCam VX-5500
If you are a traveler like I am, this one is for you. It didn’t really make a differ­
ence to me that it comes with three interchangeable faceplates (white, blue, 
and red). The best part of the design is that it folds flat and I can easily pack 
it in my laptop bag. It works well in either scenario — at my home office, 
where I have a window facing me and streaming sunlight during the day, or 
when I am on the road.
Price: $49
