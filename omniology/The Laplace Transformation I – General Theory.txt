Introduction
Introduction
We have in Ventus: Complex Functions Theory a-1, a-2, a-3 given the most basic of the theory of
analytic functions:
a-1 The book Elementary Analytic Functions is deﬁning the battleﬁeld. It introduces the analytic
functions using the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Furthermore, the powerful results of the Cauchy
Integral Theorem and the Cauchy Integral Formula are proved, and the most elementary analytic
functions are deﬁned and discussed as our building stones. The important applications of Cauchy’s
two results mentioned above are postponed to a-2.
a-2 The book Power Series is dealing with the correspondence between an analytic function and
its complex power series. We make a digression into the theory of Harmonic Functions, before
we continue with the Laurent series and the Residue Calculus.
A handful of simple rules for
computing the residues is given before we turn to the powerful applications of the residue calculus
in computing certain types of trigonometric integrals, improper integrals and the sum of some not
so simple series.
a-3 The book Stability, Riemann surfaces, and Conformal maps
starts with pointing out the con-
nection between analytic functions and Geometry. We prove some classical criteria for stability in
Cybernetics. Then we discuss the inverse of an analytic function and the consequence of extending
this to the so-called multi-valued functions. Finally, we give a short review of the conformal maps
and their importance for solving a Dirichlet problem.
In the following volumes we describe some applications of this basic theory. We start in this book
with the general theory of the Laplace Transformation Operator, and continue in Ventus, Complex
Functions Theory a-5 with applications of this general theory.
The author is well aware of that the topics above only cover the most elementary parts of Complex
Functions Theory. The aim with this series has been hopefully to give the reader some knowledge of
the mathematical technique used in the most common technical applications.

The Lebesgue Integral
1.1
Null sets and null functions
The theory of the Laplace transformation presented here relies heavily on residue calculus, cf. Ventus,
Complex Functions Theory a-2 and the Lebesgue integral. For that reason we start this treatise with
a very short (perhaps too short?) introduction of the most necessary topics from Measure Theory and
the theory of the Lebesgue integral.
We start with the deﬁnition of a null set, i.e. a set with no length (1 dimension), no area (2 dimension)
or no volume (3 dimensions). Even if Deﬁnition 1.1.1 below seems to be obvious most of the problems
of understanding Measure Theory and the Lebesgue integral can be traced back to this deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 Let N ⊂R be a subset of the real numbers. We call N a null set, if one to every
ε > 0 can ﬁnd a sequence of (not necessarily disjoint) intervals In, each of length ℓ(In), such that
N ⊆
+∞

n=1
In
and
+∞

n=1
ℓ(In) ≤ε.
Deﬁnition 1.1.1 is easily extended to the n-dimensional space Rn by deﬁning a closed interval by
I := [a1, b1] × · · · × [an, bn] ,
where aj < bj for all j = 1, . . . , n.

The Lebesgue Integral
If n = 2, then I = [a1, b1] × [a2, b2] is a rectangle, and m(I) := (b1 −a1) · (b2 −a2) is the area of this
rectangle. In case of n ≥3 we talk of n-dimensional volumes instead.
We ﬁrst prove the following simple theorem.
Theorem 1.1.1 Every ﬁnite or countable set is a null set.
Proof. Every subset of a null set is clearly again a null set, because we can apply the same ε-coverings
of Deﬁnition 1.1.1 in both cases. It therefore suﬃces to prove the claim in the countable case. Assume
that N = {xn | n ∈N}, xn ∈R, is countable. Choose any ε > 0 and deﬁne the following sequence of
closed intervals
In :=

xn −ε · 2−n−1, xn + ε · 2−n−1
,
for all n ∈N.
Then xn ∈In and ℓ(In) = ε · 2−n, so
N ⊆
+∞

n=1
In
and
+∞

n=1
ℓ(In) =
+∞

n=1
ε · 2−n = ε.
Since ε was chosen arbitrarily, it follows from Deﬁnition 1.1.1 that N is a null set. □
Example 1.1.1 The set of rational numbers Q are dense in R, because given any real numbers r ∈R
and ε > 0 we can always ﬁnd q ∈Q, such that |r −q| < ε. This is of course very convenient for many
applications, because we in most cases can replace a real number r by a neighbouring rational number
q ∈Q only making an error < ε in the following computations.
However, Q is countable, hence a null set by Theorem 1.1.1, while R clearly is not a null set, so points
from a large set in the sense of measure can be approximated by points from a small set in the sense
of measure, in the present case even of measure 0.
Figure 1: Proof of N × N being countable.

The Lebesgue Integral
That Q is countable is seen in the following way. Since countability relies on the rational numbers N,
the set N is of course countable. Then N × N := {(m, n) | m ∈N, n ∈N} is also countable.
The points of N × N are illustrated on Figure 1, where we have laid a broken line mostly following the
diagonals, so it goes through every point of N × N. Starting at (1, 1) ∼1 and (2, 1) ∼2 and (1, 2) ∼3
following this broken line we see that we at the same time have numbered all points of N × N, so this
set must be countable.
An easy modiﬁcation of the proof above shows that Z × N is also countable. The reader is urged
as an exercise to describe the extension and modiﬁcation of Figure 1, such that the broken line goes
through all points of Z × N.
To any given (m, n) ∈Z × N there corresponds a unique rational number q := m
n ∈Q, and to every
q = m
n ∈Q there corresponds inﬁnitely many pairs (p · m, p · n) ∈Z × N for p ∈N. Therefore, Q
contains at most as many points as Z × N, so Q is at most countable. On the other hand, Q ⊃N, so
Q is also at least countable. We therefore conclude that Q is countable, and Q is a null set. ♦
Example 1.1.2 Life would be easier if one could conclude that is a set is uncountable, then it is not
a null set. Unfortunately, this is not the case!!! The simplest example is probably the (classical) set
of points
N :=

x ∈[0, 1]
 x =
+∞

n=1
an · 3−n, an ∈{0, 2}

.
The set N is constructed by dividing the interval [0, 1] into three subintervals

and then remove the middle one. Then repeat this construction on the smaller intervals, etc.. At
each step the length of the remaining set is multiplied by 2
3, so N is at step n contained in a union of
intervals of a total length
2
3
n
→0 for n →+∞, so N is a null set.
On the other hand, we deﬁne a bijective map ϕ : N →M by
ϕ

n=1
an
2 · 2−n =

b : n · 2n,
where bn := an
2 ∈{0, 1}.
Clearly, every point y ∈[0, 1] can be written in the form
y =
+∞

n=1
bn · 2−n,
bn ∈{0, 1},
so we conclude that M = [0, 1]. Since ϕ : N →[0, 1] is surjective, N and [0, 1] must have the same
number of elements, or more precisely, N has at least as many elements as [0, 1], but since N ⊂[0, 1]
it also must have at most as many elements as [0, 1]. The interval [0, 1] is not a null set, because its
length is 1, so it follows from Theorem 1.1.1 that [0, 1] is not countable. Hence, N is a non-countable
null set. ♦

The Lebesgue Integral
Examples 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 above show that null sets are more diﬃcult to understand than one would
believe from the simple Deﬁnition 1.1.1. The reason is that there is a latent aspect of Geometry in
this deﬁnition, which has never been clearly described, although some recent attempts have been done
in the Theory of Fractals. So after this warning the reader is recommended always to stick to the
previous Deﬁnition 1.1.1 and in the simple cases apply Theorem 1.1.1, and not speculate too much of
the Geometry of possible null sets.
The next deﬁnition is building on Deﬁnition 1.1.1.
Deﬁnition 1.1.2 A function f deﬁned on R is called a null function, if the set {x ∈R | f(x) ̸= 0}
is a null set, i.e. if the function is zero outside a null set.
When f is a null function, we deﬁne its integral as 0, i.e.
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx = 0,
if f is a null function.
That this is a fortunate deﬁnition is illustrated by the following example.
Example 1.1.3 Given a subset A ⊆R, we deﬁne its indicator function χA : R →{0, 1} by
χA(x) =



1
for x ∈A,
0
for x /∈A.
The indicator function is in some textbooks also called the characteristic function of the set A, and
denoted by 1A.
It follows from the above that A is a null set, if and only if χA is a null function.
Figure 2: The indicator function of Q ∩[0, 1] is a null function, which is not Riemann integrable.

The Lebesgue Integral
If we choose A = Q ∩[0, 1], then A is countable, hence a null set, so by the deﬁnition above,
 +∞
−∞
χQ ∩[0,1](x) dx = 0.
On the other hand, χQ ∩[0,1] cannot be Riemann integrable. In fact, any approximation from below
is ≤0, while any approximation from above is ≥1. This illustrates that Deﬁnition 1.1.2 cannot be
derived from the well-known Riemann integral.
Clearly, if the integral of f exists and is ﬁnite, and g = f + h, where h is a null function, then we put
 +∞
−∞
g(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
{f(x) + h(x)} dx =
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx +
 +∞
−∞
h(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx,
so we can always change a function on a null set without changing the value of its integral. This
observation will often be convenient in the following.

The Lebesgue Integral
More generally, we deﬁne the following pointwise product
0 · (+∞) = 0 · (−∞) = 0,
so a “pointwise” 0 will always dominate the values ±∞. (The reader should be aware of that these
rules cannot be applied when we are dealing with limits in general.) Then we shall also allow the
(real) functions to have inﬁnite values ±∞. Combining the deﬁnitions above we get for a null set A
that
 +∞
−∞
(+∞) · χA(x) dx = (+∞) ·
 +∞
−∞
χA(x) dx = (+∞) · 0 = 0,
so (+∞) · χA(x) is again a null function.
Furthermore, if g is any real function, and f is a null function, then the pointwise product f(x)g(x)
is again a null function. ♦
If f is a null function, we write f = 0 a.e., where “a.e.” is an abbreviation of “almost everywhere”.
If f −g = 0 a.e., we also write f = g a.e.. If they both are integrable, their integrals are equal.
Remark 1.1.1 The rules of calculation of ±∞deﬁned above are not universal. There exist other
forms of inﬁnity, which do not obey these rules. One example is given by the so-called “Dirac’s δ
function”, which is 0 at any x ̸= 0, and a “higher form of inﬁnity” at 0, because one customary puts
“
 +∞
−∞
δ(x) dx = 1”,
which is not possible, if δ(x) was an ordinary function, because {0} is a null set. This enigma is
solved by identifying δ as a point measure at 0, and not as a function. We shall return to δ in Ventus,
Complex Functions Theory a-5. ♦
1.2
The Lebesgue integral
As mentioned earlier we shall base our theory of the Laplace transformation on the Lebesgue integral,
and not on the more familiar Riemann integral. We shall only give the most necessary deﬁnitions and
results without any proper proof, because this book is not meant to be a course in Measure Theory
and Lebesgue integral.
We shall only consider the so-called measurable functions. This is actually no problem, because every
function stemming from practical applications in Physics or Engineering Sciences are necessarily
measurable, and non-measurable functions only exist in an ideal mathematical world. They do exist,
but it is not possible to construct just one of them without using some doubtful methods. Therefore,
we shall in the following tacitly assume that every function under consideration is indeed measurable,
even if we do not make their deﬁnition precise.
Concerning the Lebesgue integral a workable deﬁnition for our purposes, though most mathematicians
would not like this version, is the following:

The Lebesgue Integral
Deﬁnition 1.2.1 Assume that f ≥0 is a non-negative function. If there exists a Riemann integrable
function g, such that f = g a.e., then we call f Lebesgue integrable (or just integrable), and we deﬁne
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
g(x) dx.
Let f be a real function. We deﬁne
f +(x) = max{f(x), 0} = (f ∨0)(x),
f −(x) = min{f(x), 0} = (f ∧0)(x),
where ∨, resp. ∧, is a shorthand for max, resp. min.
Deﬁnition 1.2.2 A real function f is (Lebesgue) integrable, if both f + ≥0 and −f −≥0 are inte-
grable in the sense of Deﬁnition 1.2.1.
If this is the case, we deﬁne
(1)
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx :=
 +∞
−∞
f +(x) dx−
 +∞
−∞
(−f −(x)) dx =
 +∞
−∞
(f(x) ∨0) dx−
 +∞
−∞
{−(f(x) ∧0)} dx.
It follows from Deﬁnition 1.2.2 that
 +∞
−∞
(f ∧0)(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
min{f(x), 0} dx = −
 +∞
−∞
{−(f ∧0)(x) }dx,
so (1) can be written in the usual way,
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx :=
 +∞
−∞
f +(x) dx +
 +∞
−∞
f −(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
(f ∨0)(x) dx +
 +∞
−∞
(f ∧0)(x) dx.
We deﬁne in a similar way the Lebesgue integral of complex functions by requiring that both ℜf and
ℑf are Lebesgue integrable.
Consider any (measurable) function f and any number p ∈[1, +∞[. If |f|p is integrable, we deﬁne
the p-norm of f by
∥f∥p :=
 +∞
−∞
|f(x)|p dx
1/p
(< +∞).
The most important cases are p = 1 and p = 2, and p = (+)∞, the latter being deﬁned in the following
way,
∥f∥∞:= ess.sup {|f(x)| | x ∈R},
where “ess.sup” means the “essential supremum”. It is deﬁned as the uniquely determined number
∥f∥∞, for which
{x ∈R | f(x) > a}



is a null set, if a > ∥f∥∞,
is not a null set, if a < ∥f∥∞.

The Lebesgue Integral
If f(x) is continuous and bounded, then of course
∥f∥∞= sup{|f(x)| | x ∈R}.
The set of all functions f on R, for which ∥f∥p < +∞, is denoted by Lp(R).
Of course the above is easily generalized to Rn in the most obvious way.
Finally we mention without proofs in the present section the following main theorems from the theory
of the Lebesgue integral.
Theorem 1.2.1 Theorem of majoring convergence.
Let (fn)n∈N be a sequence of functions from
L1(R), and assume that the pointwise sequence (fn(x))n∈N is convergent for almost every (ﬁxed)
x ∈R with the limit function f(x), deﬁned almost everywhere.
Assume that there is a function g ∈L1(R), such that
|fn(x)| ≤g(x)
for all n ∈N and almost every x ∈R.
Then the limit function f(x) = limn→+∞fn(x), deﬁned a.e. is Lebesgue integrable, and we have
 +∞
−∞
f(x) dx =
 +∞
−∞
lim
n→∞fn(x) dx =
lim
n→+∞
 +∞
−∞
fn(x) dx,
so in this case the limit process and the integration process can be interchanged.
This theorem is one of the advantages of the Lebesgue integral. It does not hold for the Riemann
integral, unless we replace the pointwise convergence is replaces by the much stronger uniform con-
vergence.
Theorem 1.2.2 Fubini’s theorem. Assume that f(x) = f (x1, x2) for x = (x1, x2) ∈R2 is a Lebesgue
integrable function.
For almost every ﬁxed x1 = a ∈R the function f (a, x2) is Lebesgue integrable in x2. Its integral
 +∞
−∞f (x1, x2) dx2 (writing x1 again instead of a) is an (almost everywhere deﬁned) Lebesgue inte-
grable function, and we have
 
R2 f(x) dx =

f (x1, x2) dx2

The Laplace transformation
2.1
Deﬁnition of the Laplace transformation using complex functions the-
ory
We shall in the following only consider functions deﬁned a.e. on the nonnegative real axis [0, +∞[
and shall not always specify that f(x) = 0 for x < 0.
Most readers have ﬁrst met the Laplace transformation more or less given by the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.1.1 The class of functions E consists of all piecewise continuous functions f : [0, +∞[ →
C, for which there are constants A > 0 and B ∈R, such that
(2) |f(t)| ≤A eBt
for every t ∈[0, +∞[.
Using the quantors ∀(= “for all”) and ∃(=“there exists”) we deﬁne
(3) ϱ(f) = inf

B ∈R | ∃A > 0 ∀t ≥0 : |f(t)| ≤A eBt
.
In many simple cases concerning the Laplace transformation it suﬃces just to consider functions
from E. However, we shall here introduce a larger class of functions F ⊃E, on which the Laplace
transformation is equally well deﬁned and with the same properties. We shall here use our knowledge
of Measure Theory from Chapter 1.

The Laplace transformation
Deﬁnition 2.1.2 The class of functions F consists of all (measurable) functions
f : [0, +∞[ →C⋆= C ∪{∞},
for which there is a constant σ ∈R, such that
(4)
 +∞
0
|f(t)| e−σt dt < +∞.
We put
(5) σ(f) = inf

σ ∈R |
 +∞
0
|f(t)| e−σt dt < +∞

.
By introducing the Lebesgue integral in (4) we see that (5) is less complicated than (3). Furthermore,
if (4) holds for some σ0 ∈R, then it clearly holds for all σ ≥σ0, because e−σt ≤e−σ0t. We even get
that if (4) holds for some σ ∈R, then
 +∞
0
f(t) e−zt dt,
for z := σ + iτ
is convergent for every τ ∈R.
Let f ∈E, i.e. f satisﬁes condition (2). For given ε > 0 we choose σ = B + ε, from which we get
 +∞
0
|f(t)| e−(B+ε)t dt ≤A
 +∞
0
e−εt dt < +∞,
and (4) holds for every σ = B + ε, ε > 0, from which we conclude that E ⊂F and σ(f) ≤ϱ(f).
Example 2.1.1 The function deﬁned by
f(x) =





1
√x
for x > 0,
0
for x ≤0,
belongs to F. In fact, choose any σ > 0, then by a change of variable for ε > 0,

 +∞
√ε
e−σ u2 du →2
 +∞
0
e−σ u2 du < +∞
for ε →0+,
and (4) is proved.
On the other hand, since f(t) →+∞for t →0+, there is absolutely no hope for (2) to be fulﬁlled, so
f ∈F \ E. ♦
Whenever f ∈F \ E, we put ϱ(f) = +∞.
It follows immediately from Deﬁnition 2.1.2 that αf + βg ∈F for all f, g ∈F and all α, β ∈C, so F
is a vector space over C.
We notice that if f ∈F and g ∈E, then it follows from a trivial estimate that the pointwise product
f · g ∈F. This result is not true in general if both f, g ∈F.

The Laplace transformation
Deﬁnition 2.1.3 Let f ∈F. We deﬁne the Laplace transform L{f} of f as the complex function
given by
(6) L{f}(z) :=
 +∞
0
e−zt f(t) dt,
where z belongs to the set of complex numbers, for which the integral on the right hand side of (6) is
convergent.
Remark 2.1.1 It follows from Deﬁnition 2.1.2 that the set of points z for which the right hand side
of (6) is convergent, is not the empty set. This shows that the Laplace transform L{f} exists for every
f ∈F. ♦
Remark 2.1.2 In some very rare and simple applications of the Laplace transformation it suﬃces
only to consider a real variable.
However, in most cases the use of a complex variable is almost
inevitable. ♦
Remark 2.1.3 It is customary in the literature to denote the variable by s, so one writes L{f}(s).
However, in order to keep in line with Complex Functions Theory we have decided in Ventus, Complex
Functions Theory a-4 and a-5 to write z instead, in order to emphasize that the Laplace transform
L{f}(z) is even an analytic function, so we can apply all the previous results from Ventus, Complex
Functions Theory a-1, a-2, a-3. More precisely, we prove in the following that L{f}(z) deﬁned by
(6) is an analytic function in at least an half plane of the form ℜz > ℜz0. It will therefore often be
possible to extend L{f}(z) analytically to larger sets than just to this half plane. We shall call any
such analytic extension a Laplace transform L{f}(z) of f. ♦
We shall in the following examples derive the simplest Laplace transforms L{f}(z).
Example 2.1.2 The constant function f(t) = 1 for t ≥0 belongs to the class E ⊂F, and we have
ϱ(1) = σ(1) = 0, and
L{1}(z) =
 +∞
0
e−zt · 1 dt =

−1
z e−zt
+∞
t=0

z
ℜz > 0.
Obviously, L{1}(z) = 1
z is deﬁned in C \ {0}, so we have a unique analytic extension from the half
plane ℜz > 0 to the deleted plane C \ {0}, cf. Remark 2.1.3 above. ♦
Example 2.1.3 Let f(t) = tn, t ≥0 and n ∈N. Since the exponential dominates the power function,
we see that even tn ∈E with ϱ (tn) = σ (tn) = 0. For ℜz > 0 we get by partial integration,
L {tn} (z) =

z · L{1}(z) = n!

z =

for ℜz > 0.
Here we have for the ﬁrst time used the common convention to write L{f(t)}(z) instead of the formally
more “correct” L{f}. ♦
Example 2.1.4 Let a ∈C be a constant, and consider the function f(t) = eat for t ≥0. Then
eat ∈E and ϱ (eat) = σ (eat) = ℜa.

ℜa = ℜ(ib) = −ℑb,
and
cosh(at) = cosh(ibt) = cos(bt),
and
sinh(at) = sinh(ibt) = i sin(bt),
cf. also Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-1, Chapter 4. Therefore, by this simple substitution it
follows from the above that

The Laplace transformation
The three examples above cover most of the elementary applications of the Laplace transformation.
We shall in this ﬁrst book on the Laplace transformation mainly consider examples which can be
derived from these three examples, leaving more advanced applications to Ventus, Complex Functions
Theory a-5, Laplace Transformation II. We collect these simple cases in Table 1. A larger table is
given in Section 4, page 101.vs
We shall now return to the general theory, where the next important topic is to prove that the Laplace
transform L{f}(z) is indeed an analytic function in the half plane ℜz > σ(f). Once we have proved
this result, we can rely on the theory of analytic functions as derived already in Ventus, Complex
Functions Theory, a-1 – a-3.
In the proof we shall need the following lemma.
Lemma 2.1.1 Assume that L{f} (z0) deﬁned by (6) exists at the point z0. Choose any Θ ∈

and denote by SΘ (z0) the angular sector
SΘ (z0) := {z ∈C | Arg (z −z0) ∈[−Θ, Θ]} .
Then the integral

e−zt f(t) dt is uniformly convergent in z for z ∈SΘ (z0).
Notice that the vertex z0 /∈SΘ (z0).

Figure 4: The geometry of the sector SΘ (z0) in the proof of Lemma 2.1.1.
Theorem 2.1.1 (Karl Weierstraß, appr. 1860). Assume that {fn} is a sequence of analytic functions
in an open domain Ω, where this sequence converges uniformly towards a function f in every closed
disc contained in Ω.
Then the limit function f is analytic in Ω.
Furthermore, f ′
n →f ′ pointwise in Ω, and uniformly in every closed disc contained in Ω.
We shall not prove Theorem 2.1.1, because its proof relies on Morera’s theorem, which again requires
a lot of preparations, and the aim of this book would be in danger of being lost, if we also gave a
proof of Theorem 2.1.1.
Theorem 2.1.1 is used in the proof of the following important theorem.
Theorem 2.1.2 If f ∈F, then there is a uniquely determined number σ = σ(f) ∈[−∞, +∞]
(including ±∞as possibilities), such that the integral
(15)
 +∞

e−ztf(t) dt
is



convergent for ℜz > σ,
divergent for ℜz < σ.
The number σ is called the abscissa of convergence of L{f}(z), which is deﬁned by (15) for ℜz > σ.
The function L{f}(z) is analytic in the open half plane
(16) Ω:= {z ∈C | ℜz > σ},
and we have for z ∈Ω,

The set Ωgiven above by (16) is called the half plane of convergence of L{f}. It is clearly in the
extreme case when σ = −∞not a half plane, though even better, namely all of C.
Usually is is not possible to decide, whether the integral (15) is convergent or divergent on the vertical
line ℜz = σ.
Notice that it is possible to give examples of functions f ∈E, for which σ < ϱ.

Then assume that ℜz < σ and choose x ∈]ℜz, σ[. If the integral
 +∞

e−ztf(t) dt were convergent,
then it would follow from Lemma 2.1.1 that
 +∞
0
e−xtf(t) dt is convergent. Hence, σ ≤x by the deﬁ-
nition (18) of σ. This is contradicting the choice of x < σ. We therefore conclude that

e−ztf(t) dt
is divergent for every z, for which ℜz < σ, and the ﬁrst part of Theorem 2.1.2 is proved.
Clearly, σ deﬁned by (18), is identical with σ(f) given in Deﬁnition 2.1.2.
Consider Ωgiven by (16). The functions

where we have used that the interval of integration is bounded for every n ∈N. Clearly, gn(z) →
L{f}(z) pointwise in Ωfor n →+∞. According to Theorem 2.1.1 we shall only prove that gn →L{f}
uniformly for n →+∞on every closed disc contained in the open half plane Ω.
Now, every closed disc in the open set Ωmust lie in some angular sector SΘ (z0) for some z0 ∈Ωand
some Θ ∈

by Theorem 2.1.1, L{f} is analytic in Ω, and

25 
The Laplace transformation
1) First use the integral on the right hand side of (20) to deﬁne the uniquely deﬁned analytic function
L{f}(z) on the left hand side of (20) in the set Ω= {z ∈Ω| ℜz > σ}.
2) Then extend the analytic function L{f}(z) to a larger set which contains the half plane of conver-
gence Ω.
It will therefore be convenient to extend the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform L{f}(z) of a function
f ∈F.
Deﬁnition 2.1.4 Given f ∈Ωand its half plane of convergence Ω= {z ∈Ω| ℜz > σ}. Let F(z) be
an analytic function in an open set ˜Ω⊆Ω, such that
F(z) =
 +∞
0
e−ztf(t) dt
for every z ∈Ω.
Then F(z) is also called a Laplace transform of f, and we write F(z) = L{f}(z), even if z ∈˜Ω\ Ω.
The essence of Deﬁnition 2.1.4 is that ˜Ωcontains the half plane of convergence Ω. Obviously, ˜Ωis
usually not unique. If e.g. f(t) = 1

The analytic function

z can of course be extended analytically to larger sets which also include
subsets of the left half plane, but the extension is not unique, because the branch cut of the square
root is not unique.
Theorem 2.1.3 If f ∈F, then
L{f}(z) →0
for ℜz →+∞.
Proof. When f ∈F, there is a σ0 ∈R, such that
 +∞
0
|f(t)| e−σ0t dt < +∞.
Since the integral is convergent, we can to every given ε > 0 ﬁnd a constant a > 0, such that

The Laplace transformation
This is true for every ε > 0, and the claim follows. □
Example 2.1.5 The simplest example of an analytic function, which does not satisfy the condition
of Theorem 2.1.1, is the constant function F(z) = 1. Hence, it cannot be the Laplace transform of
any function f ∈F. In the technical sciences one claims that the impulse “function” (or Dirac’s
“function”) δ has F(z) = 1 as its Laplace transform. This is not quite true according to the usual
Theory of Distributions, but the theory can be modiﬁed. Anyway, since F(z) = “L{δ}(z)” = 1 does
not converge towards 0 for ℜz →+∞, Theorem 2.1.3 shows that δ cannot be a function from F. ♦
Example 2.1.6 The proof of Theorem 2.1.3 showed that to every ε > 0 there is a σ1 ∈R, such that
(21) |L{f}(z)| ≤
 +∞
0
|f(t)|e−σ1t dt < ε
for ℜz > σ1,
i.e. the estimate (21) holds in a right half plane. As a consequence, the function exp

−z2
cannot be
the Laplace transform of any function f ∈F. The estimate (21) is of course true for real z = x ≥σ1.
However, if we put z = λ(1 + i) for λ > 0, then z2 = 2iλ2, and we get
exp

z2 =
exp

−2iλ2 = 1
for all λ > 0,
so
exp

z2 does not tend towards 0 for λ →+∞, or ℜz →+∞. ♦
2.2
Some important properties of Laplace transforms
We shall here list some common and important properties of Laplace transforms.
Let A denote the set of all analytic functions with their domains containing some right half planes.
Then the Laplace transformation is an operator L : F →A.
Theorem 2.2.1 . The linearity property.The operator L : F →A is linear in the following sense:
If λ, µ ∈C are constants, and f, g ∈F, then
L{λf + µg}(z) = λL{f}(z) + µL{g}(z)
for ℜz > max{σ(f), σ(g)}.
Sketch of proof. Let ℜz > max{σ(f), σ(g)}. Prove that the integral (6) corresponding to
L{λf + µg}(z) is convergent, and then use that the integral is linear, where one uses that the two
integrals on the right hand side obviously are convergent for ℜz > max{σ(f), σ(g)}. The simple
missing details are left to the reader. □
Example 2.2.1 We get for ℜz > 0 by using the linearity property above and Table 1 that

The importance of the Laplace transformation in the technical applications lies in the fact that it
transforms problems of diﬀerential equations (actually also more general problems) into algebraic
problems, which are easier to solve. After the derived algebraic problem has been solved, we imply
the inverse Laplace transformation to obtain the solution of the original problem. We shall ﬁrst extend
the concept of diﬀerentiability in order to meet our more general demands.
Assume that f is a continuous function, which is piecewise of class C1. Then the set of points, where
f is not of class C1, a null set, so it is quite natural to let f ′ denote the function, which is given by
f ′(x) :=



the usual derivative, if f is C1 at x,
any value, if f is not C1 at x.
The philosophy is of course that we can freely change the value of f ′(x) on a null set, and we use this
principle on the null set where the usual derivative does not exist.
Notice that f ′(x) then can be considered as a piecewise continuous function.
Theorem 2.2.5 Laplace transformation of derivatives. Assume that f ∈E is continuous and piece-
wise C1. Then f ′ ∈F, and
L{f ′}(z) = z · L{f}(z) −f(0).
Proof. The proof below requires actually that f ∈E and that we apply ϱ(f) as the bound of the
half plane of convergence instead of σ(f).
Let {tn} denote the null set of points, in which f is not of class C1, and put t0 = 0. We shall assume
that {tn} is inﬁnite, because the proof is modiﬁed trivially, if {tn} is ﬁnite.
We get by partial integration,

Here we can only say for sure that limn→+∞e−ztn+1 · f (tn+1) exists, if f ∈E and ℜz > ϱ(f), so we
add these assumptions. Then it follows from the deﬁnition of ϱ(f) that we can ﬁnd real constants
A > 0 and B, where furthermore ϱ(f) < B < ℜz, such that
e−Btf(t)

for t →+∞,
from which follows that even
lim
n→+∞e−ztn+1 · f (tn+1) = 0.
and the theorem is proved. □
Even if the proof of Theorem 2.2.5 required that ℜz > ϱ(f), it is obvious that the analytic function
L{f ′}(z) = z · L{f}(z) −f(0) may be extended analytically to a larger open set Ω. Now, the analytic
extension to a given open set Ωis always unique, if it exists. This implies that we could deﬁne a more
general form of diﬀerentiability of functions in F by its Laplace transform, i.e.
(22) L{f′}(z) := z · L{f}(z) −f(0),
for f ∈F.
There is a lot of truth in (22), though it is not the full story. We shall here point out some pitfalls in
the adoption of (22) as a deﬁnition of a more general derivative.
1) Due to the term f(0) we must require that f ∈F is continuous at t = 0, i.e.
lim
t→0+ f(t) = f(0).
It is of course a strange condition to require continuity at one speciﬁc point and not anywhere else.
This is, however, caused by the fact that the Laplace transformation in the Theory of Distributions
has a hidden discontinuity at t = 0, so we must compensate by requiring that f(t) is continuous
at t = 0.
2) The new function f ′ deﬁned by the inverse Laplace transformation of (22) does not have to belong
to F. It even does not have to be an ordinary function
Example 2.2.5 To illustrate some of the problems above we notice the trivial factorization 1 = z · 1
z
for z ̸= 0. Now,
L{1}(z) = L

χ[0,+∞[

(z) = 1
z ,
so we guess that
1 = L

χ′
[0,+∞[

(z) = L{δ}(z).
This can actually be justiﬁed, but not by using the argument above!
The hidden obstacle is that
the discontinuity of the function χ[0,+∞[ at t = 0 coincides with the discontinuity of the Laplace
transformation itself. ♦

Obviously, if f ∈E is of class C1 and piecewise C2, then it follows by iteration of Theorem 2.2.5 that

Example 2.2.7 At this stage we only know very few Laplace transforms, so we can only apply
Theorem 2.2.6 on very simple examples, where we also have other possibilities of solution. We have
proved in Example 2.1.3 that tn ∈E with ϱ (tn) = σ (tn) = 0 and
L {tn} (z) =

Theorem 2.2.9 Periodic functions. Assume that f ∈F is a periodic function of period T > 0 for

The proof of Theorem 2.2.9 relies heavily on the assumption that ℜz > 0. However, by the usual

because it is almost trivial that the integral

for every f ∈F and every z ∈C.
Example 2.2.11 In this example we show that even if we obtain the structure
F(z) =
1
1 −e−zT ϕ(z) = L{f}(z)
of the Laplace transform, this does not necessarily imply that the function f(t) is periodic.

[t] := max{p ∈Zp ≤t},

Obviously, f ∈E. The question is now:
Does there exist a periodic function g ∈E, such that
 T
0 e−ztg(t) dt = 1
z ?
The answer is “no”, because if g(t) were periodic, then L{f}(z) = L{g}(z), thus L{f −g}(z) = 0. We
shall later prove the uniqueness theorem which states that 0 (almost everywhere) is the only function
which has the Laplace transform 0. Hence, f(t) = g(t) a.e. and it is obvious that the step function
f(t) is not periodic.
Another point is that even if f(t) is periodic, its Laplace transform in its simplest form does not have
the structure of Theorem 2.2.9. We showed in Example 2.1.4 that
L{sin t}(z) =
1
z2 + 1
for ℜz > 0.
The function sin t has the period 2π, so in order to obtain the same structure as in Theorem 2.2.9 we
should write

The Laplace transformation
Theorem 2.2.11 Final value theorem. Let f ∈F, where σ(f) ≤0. If limt→+∞f(t) = c ∈C exists,
then the real limit limx→0+ xL{f}(x) also exists, and
lim
t→+∞f(t) = lim
x→0+ xL{f}(x).
If f ∈E ∩C1 and |f ′(t)| ≤A for all t ≥0, then
lim

zL{f}(z).
Proof. Since limt→+∞f(t) = c ∈C we can to every ε > 0 ﬁnd a T = T(ε) > 0, such that
|f(t) −c| < ε

This is true for every ε > 0, so we conclude that

Then assume that also f ∈E ∩C1 and |f ′| ≤A. It follows from Theorem 2.2.5 that
L{f ′}(z) = zL{f}(z) −f(0),
because the additional assumptions above imply that f(0) exists.

This shows that limx→0+ xL{f}(x) may exist, while the limit of f(t) for t →+∞does not. ♦

The Laplace transformation
We shall later return to the Initial value theorem and the Final value theorem, when we have become
able to handle more complicated examples.
2.3
The complex inversion formula I
In practical applications one typically uses the theorems of Section 2.2 in order to compute the
Laplace transform F ∈A of the unknown function f(t). It is therefore important also to establish
some methods by which one can reconstruct f(t), t > 0, from the analytic function F(z).
In this section we prove the simplest versions of the Laplace inversion formula. They are very easy to
apply, because they rely on the well known residuum calculus, cf. Ventus: Complex Functions Theory
a-2. Furthermore, in many technical sciences, like e.g. in Cybernetics and Elementary Circuit Theory
the functions F ∈A will be of a type where the methods of this section suﬃce.
We shall later in Section 3.5 give a more general inversion formula where we only require that F ∈A
some very reasonable growth conditions in a right half plane. We shall in this general case even allow
that F(z) is a branch of a many valued function.
We mention without proof
Theorem 2.3.1 Weierstraß’s approximation theorem. Let f : [a, b] →R be a continuous real function
on the closed and bounded (i.e. compact) interval [a, b], a < b.
There exists a sequence of polynomials (Pn) which converges uniformly towards f on [a, b].
This means that to every ε > 0 we can ﬁnd n0 ∈N, such that for every n ≥n0 and every x ∈[a, b]
we have the estimate
|f(x) −Pn(x)| < ε,

or more compactly,
max
x∈[a,b] |f(x) −Pn(x)| < ε

.
It is possible to give an elementary proof using only calculus in one variable, but it is very long. There
is also a much shorter proof, but it requires knowledge of Chebyshev’s inequality.
We use Theorem 2.3.1 to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 2.3.1 Assume that f : [a, b] →C is continuous.
If
 b
a tnf(t) dt = 0 for every n ∈N0, then f ≡0 on [a, b],
Proof. We can always consider the real and the imaginary parts separately, so it suﬃces to prove
the lemma for f : [a, b] →R real and continuous.
Choose by Theorem 2.3.1 a sequence (Pn) of polynomials converging uniformly towards f. Since every
Pn(t) is a polynomial, it follows from the assumption that also
 b
a
Pn(t)f(t) dt = 0
for every n ∈N0,
For given ε > 0 choose n0 ∈N, such that

x∈[a,b] |f(x) −Pn(x)| ·

|f(t)| dt < ε
for all n ≥n0.

 b
a {f(t)}2 dt = 0. Since the integrand {f(t)}2 ≥0 is continuous,
this is only possible if f(t) = 0 for all t ∈[a, b]. □
Theorem 2.3.2 Assume that f ∈E is continuous. If there is a τ, such that
L{f}(z) = 0
for ℜz > τ,
then f(t) = 0 for every t ∈[0, +∞[.
Proof. It follows from the assumption that
L{f}(z) =
 +∞
0
e−ztf(t) dt = 0
for ℜz > τ.
Choose a ﬁxed x0 > τ + 1. Then x0 −1 > τ and
L{f} (x0 −1) =
 +∞
0
e−x0t+tf(t) dt = 0.
In particular, e−x0t+tf(t) →0 for t →+∞, because f ∈E. If we put s = e−t, s ∈]0, 1], and
h(s) = e−x0t+tf(t),
t = ln 1
s,
we see that h(s) can be extended continuously to [0, 1] by adding the value
h(0) =
lim
t→+∞e−x0t+tf(t) = 0.
Now x0 + n > τ for every n ∈N0, so for every n ∈N0 we get by the assumption,
 1
0
snh(s) ds = −
 0
+∞
e−nt ex0t+t f(t) dt =
 +∞
0
e−(x0+n)tf(t) dt = L{f} (x0 + n) = 0.
Finally, Lemma 2.3.1 implies that h(s) = e−x0t+tf(t) = 0, hence also f(t) = 0. □
Remark 2.3.1 The assumption of Theorem 2.3.2 can be relaxed to the following: There is a z0 ∈C
and a λ > 0, such that
L{f} (z0 + λn) = 0
for every n ∈N0.
The proof is only a modiﬁcation of the proof of Theorem 2.3.2. From this follows that if F ∈A is not
identically 0, then F(z) sin z can never be the Laplace transform of any continuous function. The proof
is very simple: By choosing zn = nπ for n ≥n0 we trivially get F(nπ) sin nπ = 0, so the only possible
continuous function is f(t) ≡0. However, F(z) ̸= 0 by assumption, so F(z) sin z ̸= 0 = L{0}(z). ♦

We shall next get rid of the assumption that f ∈E is continuous.
Theorem 2.3.3 Let f ∈E, and assume that there is a τ, such that L{f}(z) = 0 for ℜz > τ. Then
f(t) = 0 for almost every t ∈[0, +∞[.
Proof. It follows from f ∈E that g(t) :=
 t

Theorem 2.2.6 that
L{g}(z) = L
 t

(z) = 1
z L{f}(z) = 0

Finally, by Theorem 2.3.2,
g(t) =
 t
0
f(τ) dτ ≡0,
which is only possible if f(τ) = 0 almost everywhere. □
Remark 2.3.2 If we knew more about of the Lebesgue integral than just what is given in Chapter 1,
we could prove that it suﬃces in Theorem 2.3.3 to assume that f ∈F. It cannot be done in the
present book, so we just mention that such a result exists. ♦

The Laplace transformation
Corollary 2.3.1 If f and g ∈E, and
L{f}(z) = L{g}(z)
for ℜz > τ,
then f = g almost everywhere in [0, +∞[.
Proof. The assumption implies by linearity that L{f −g}(z) = 0 for ℜz > τ, where f −g ∈E, so
the corollary follows immediately from Theorem 2.3.3. □
Remark 2.3.3 Combining Corollary 2.3.1 and Remark 2.3.2 it follows that the conclusion of Corol-
lary 2.3.1 also holds, if f, g ∈F. As mentioned above we cannot here give the correct proof, so this
information is just for reference. ♦
We shall use Corollary 2.3.1 in the investigation of the following problem:
Given an analytic function F ∈A deﬁned in an open domain Ωwhich contains a right half
plane ℜz > τ. Does there exist a function f ∈F, such that L{f}(z) = F(z)?
According to Remark 2.3.3 there is – apart from addition of a null function – at most one such function
f ∈F.
If there exists a function f ∈F, such that L{f}(z) = F(z), then we call f the inverse Laplace
transform of the analytic function F ∈A, and we write
f(t) := L−1{F}(t),
t ≥0.
In practice it will cause no problem that f(t) is “only” determined almost everywhere, because we are
always allowed to change f(t) on a null set with no consequences for the concrete physical or technical
situation we are trying to model.
Our ﬁrst result of ﬁnding L−1{F}(t) is the following theorem.
Theorem 2.3.4 Residuum inversion formula. Let F(z) be analytic in C\{z1, . . . , zn}, i.e. in the whole
complex plane except for a ﬁnite number of singularities. Assume that there are positive constants M,
R, α > 0, such that we have the estimate
|F(z)| ≤M
|z|α
for |z| ≥R.
Then F(z) has a (uniquely determined) inverse Laplace transform. It is given by the residuum formula

The Laplace transformation
Remark 2.3.4 Theorem 2.3.4 is in particular useful in Cybernetics and in Circuit Theory,, because
in these sciences one shall typically ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform of a fraction between two
polynomials, where the denominator has higher degree than the numerator. Furthermore, formula
(25) is easy to use, once one knows the simple rules of ﬁnding a residuum, cf. also Ventus: Complex
Functions Theory a-2. This is advantageous, when the use of tables becomes too complicated. On
the other hand, tables are of course useful, when the assumptions of Theorem 2.3.4 are not met, so
we cannot rely on formula (25). We mention that residuum formulæ usually give a wrong result when
not all of the assumptions are fulﬁlled. It is therefore of paramount importance always to check the
assumptions of a residuum formula, because otherwise the error may be very dramatic indeed, without
any element at all of an “approximation” of the right result. ♦
Proof.
Fix z, such that ℜz = β > σ := max {ℜzj | j = 1, . . . , n}.
Then choose γ, such that
σ < γ < β. Finally, consider any r > R and deﬁne the closed path of integration Cr,γ, which is given
on Figure 5, i.e. Cr,γ is composed of a circular arc of centre 0 and radius r, and a segment of the
vertical line ℜζ = γ.
Figure 5: The closed path of integration Cr,γ, where σ ≥0. The case σ < 0 is similar.
Due to the estimate |F(z)| ≤M · |z|−α < +∞for |z| ≥r > R, all singularities of F(z) lie inside
Cr,γ. Using (25) as a deﬁnition of f(t), it follows from the Residuum Theorem, cf. Ventus, Complex
Functions Theory a-2, that

2) One may add that F(z) ≡1 /∈A, because it does not satisfy the necessary condition of F(z) →0
for ℜz →∞of being a Laplace transform of a function from F, cf. Theorem 2.1.3, so one may
believe that this is the reason why (25) does not hold. This is, however, not the case, which we
shall prove now by choosing f(t) = χ[0,1](t), where clearly f ∈F. We get immediately by a small
computation,
L{f}(z) =
 1
0
e−zt dt = 1 −e−z
z
= F(z)
for z ∈C,
because the singularity at z = 0 is removable, F(0) = 1. Hence, σ = −∞, and F(z) is analytic in
all of C, and an application of (25) gives
f1(t) = L−1{F}(t) =
n

≡0 ̸= f(t) = χ[0,1](t).
We therefore conclude that at least one of the assumptions of Theorem 2.3.4 is not fulﬁlled.
In this case the villain is the exponential, because
1 −e−z
z
= 1 −e−x
x
= e|x| −1
|x|
→+∞
for z = x →−∞,
when z = x is chosen real and negative. It is again the growth condition
|F(z)| ≤M
|z|α
for |z| > R,
which is not fulﬁlled. ♦
It was mentioned above that Theorem 2.3.4 is in particular useful when F(z) = P(z)
Q(z) is a rational
function, where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials, and deg Q > deg P. If z0 is a zero of multiplicity
n of Q, then it follows from one of the residuum theorems in Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-2
that

Since z0 may also be complex, we conclude that the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function
F(z), which satisﬁes F(z) →0 for z →∞, is a linear sum of terms of the form
tkeat,
tkeat cos bt
and
tkeat sin bt,
corresponding to the complete solution of some linear homogeneous ordinary diﬀerential equation of
constant coeﬃcients. Therefore, if the Laplace transform F(z) of some unknown function proves to
be a rational function satisfying F(z) →0 for z →∞, then it is theoretically possible to reformulate
the original problem to a linear ordinary diﬀerential equation of constant coeﬃcients, where one

The Laplace transformation
already knows the complete solution from Elementary Calculus, cf. e.g. Ventus, Calculus 1. For such
problems we may therefore apply the simple old solution method known from Elementary Calculus
without involving the theory of Laplace transformation, so also excluding the residuum calculus in
the form of Theorem 2.3.4. The two methods certainly give the same result. The former is easy
to understand, while the latter requires some more advanced knowledge of mathematics.
It can,
however, be proved that both methods rely on the problem of ﬁnding the roots of the same so-called
characteristic polynomial of the problem.
From the discussion above the reader should therefore conclude that in the simple case of a rational
function F(z), where F(z) →0 for z →∞one might alternatively just as well solve a linear ordinary
diﬀerential equation by elementary calculus instead of using the Laplace transformation, where the
elementary calculus sometimes may even be easier to use. However, when engineers nevertheless prefer
to use the Laplace transformation instead of elementary calculus, the reason is that one intrinsically
build the given boundary conditions f(0), f ′(0), etc. into F(z) by repeating the rule
L{f ′}(z) = z · L{f}(z) −f(0).
A trivial, though important consequence of Theorem 2.3.4 is the following
Corollary 2.3.2 Heaviside’s expansion theorem. Let P(z) and Q(z) be polynomials, where
deg Q > deg P, and assume that the denominator Q(z) has only simple roots, z1, . . . , zn. Then the
inverse Laplace transform of the rational function F(z) = P(z)
Q(z) is given by
f(t) =
n

j=1
P (zj)
Q′ (zj) · ezjt
for t > 0,
and σ(f) = max {ℜzj | j = 1, . . . n}.
Example 2.3.2 We shall here show that Theorem 2.3.4 can be applied to other analytic functions
than just the rational functions, so Theorem 2.3.4 is therefore more general than one would expect
from the discussion above of the rational functions.

Convolutions
Convolutions were originally introduced in Number Theory, but it was soon proved that it was also
useful in Mathematical Analysis, because the discrete and the continuous formula were of the same
structure, and the continuous formula also occurred naturally in solution formulæ. For that reason
one kept the vocabulary from Number Theory, although it is diﬃcult to see in the continuous case
without this historical background why we call this new operation a convolution.
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 Let f and g be two functions, both 0 for t < 0 negative. The convolution f ⋆g of
the two functions is deﬁned by the integral
(f ⋆g)(t) =
 +∞
−∞
f(t −τ)g(τ) dτ,
t ∈R,
where we also allow inﬁnite values of the integral.
In general, the requirement that the functions are 0 for t < 0 negative, is not at all necessary. It is
only added here, because we are dealing with the Laplace transformation, so unless speciﬁed otherwise
we only consider in the following functions which are 0 on the negative half axis.
Given the assumptions of Deﬁnition 2.4.1, it follows that the integrand
f(t −τ)g(τ) = 0
for τ /∈[0, 1]
for t > 0 ﬁxed,
and of cause for every τ ∈R, if t ≤0, because then either f(t −τ) = 0 or g(τ) = 0. This implies that
Deﬁnition 2.4.1 can be reduced to
(f ⋆g)(t) =



 t
0 f(t −τ)g(τ) dτ
for t > 0,
0
for t ≤0.

The Laplace transformation
Notice in particular that if both f and g are 0 for t < 0, then the convolution f ⋆g is also 0 for t < 0.
We have an even better result.
Theorem 2.4.1 If f, g ∈F are both 0 for t < 0, then also f ⋆g ∈F, and the convolution f ⋆g is 0
for t < 0.
Proof. From f, g ∈F follow the existence of σ > 0 such that
 +∞
0
|f(t)|e−σt| dt < +∞
and
 +∞
0
|g(t)|e−σt| dt < +∞,
where we of course can use the same σ > 0 in both integrals.
Using this σ > 0 we shall prove that also
 +∞
0
|(f ⋆g)(t)|e−σt| dt < +∞.
This is done in the following way, where we use Fubini’s theorem from Chapter 1, when we below
interchange the order of integration. Notice that 0 ≤τ ≤t < +∞, when this interchange takes place:
 +∞
0
|(f ⋆g)(t)|e−σt| dt

 +∞

|g(τ)| e−στ dτ < +∞,
where we also have used the substitution u = t −τ. □
Remark 2.4.1 It is easy to prove (cf. e.g. Ventus, Complex Functions Theory c-11) that if f, g ∈E,
then also f ⋆g ∈E. Notice also that f ⋆g ∈F implies that (f ⋆g)(t) is ﬁnite almost everywhere. ♦
The importance of the convolution in connection with the Laplace transformation is described by the
following theorem, which also shows that ⋆behaves like some sort of multiplication between functions
in F.
Theorem 2.4.2 Laplace transformation of a convolution.
1) Convolution is commutative on F. Thus, if f, g ∈F, then
(f ⋆g)(t) = (g ⋆f)(t)
almost everywhere.
2) If f, g ∈F, then
L{f ⋆g}(z) = L{f}(z) · L{g}(z)
for ℜz > max{σ(f), σ(g)}.
Thus, the Laplace transformation of a convolution of functions from F is the pointwise product
of their Laplace transforms L{f} and L{g}. An analytic extension shows that this rule holds,
whenever the product L{f}(z) · L{g}(z) is deﬁned.

The Laplace transformation
Therefore, Theorem 2.4.2 implies that a complicated operation like convolution (which often occurs in
solution formulæ) by the Laplace transformation is transformed into a simple pointwise multiplication,
where one knows the rules of computation from elementary calculus.
Proof.
It follows from the proof of Theorem 2.4.1 that it is allowed to interchange the order of
integration, provided that ℜz > max{σ(f), σ(g)}. Then just copy the computation of the proof of
Theorem 2.4.1 with trivial modiﬁcations to get
L{f ⋆g}(z)

f(u)e−zu du ·
 +∞
0
g(τ)e−zτ dτ = L{f}(z) · L{g}(z).
When f and g are interchanged in the computation above we also get
L{g ⋆f}(z) = L{g}(z) · L{f}(z) = L{f}(z) · L{g}(z) = L{f ⋆g}(z),
because pointwise multiplication is commutative.
Using that the Laplace transformation on F is
injective (apart from values of the functions on a null set, a result still to be proved), we ﬁnally
conclude that
(g ⋆f)(t) = (f ⋆g)(t)
almost everywhere,
so the convolution is commutative. □
Example 2.4.1 It was proved in Example 2.3.7 that the inverse Laplace transform of F(z) =
z
(z2 + 1)2 was given by 1
2 t sin t.
From Example 2.3.6 follows that the inverse Laplace transform
of
1
z2 + 1 is sin t, and from Example 2.3.5 follows that the inverse Laplace transform of
z
z2 + 1 is cos t.
Hence,
L{sin ⋆cos}(z) = L{sin}(z) · L{cos}(z) =

We therefore conclude that

for t > 0,

We shall prove that ϕ(t) fulﬁls the Bessel equation (30) and the initial conditions ϕ(0) = 1 and
ϕ′(0) = 0, because then it follows from the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem of Linear Ordinary

First we get by diﬀerentiating under the integral sign that

We have proved that ϕ(t) is a solution of the Bessel equation of order 0 satisfying the same
boundary conditions as J0(t). Hence, ϕ(t) = J0(t) by the Existence and Uniqueness Theorem of
Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations, and we have proved (31), from which follows, as already shown
above, that |J0(t)| ≤1 for t ∈R.
3) Finally, the Laplace transform L {J0} (z) of J0(t) is found by applying the Laplace transformation
on the Bessel equation (30) and then use the various rules of computation derived in Section 2.2,
i.e. “multiplication by t”, “diﬀerentiation”, linearity and formula (23), which we repeat here,
L{f ′′}(z) = z2L{f}(z) −z · f(0) −f ′(0).

The argument above is a typical application of the initial value theorem. In general, the Laplace
transformation transforms some linear diﬀerential equation in t into another linear diﬀerential
equation in z, which hopefully is simpler, so it can easily be solved. The complete solution of
the transformed equation will of course contain arbitrary constants, which usually are determined,
either by the initial value theorem or the ﬁnal value theorem, depending on the conditions on the
original function f(t).

Linear ordinary diﬀerential equations
In many cases linear ordinary diﬀerential equations are easily solved by using the Laplace transfor-
mation. The reader should, however, be aware of that the more primitive methods from Elementary
Calculus must not be forgotten, because they sometimes give the solution in an even easier way.
We shall here describe the solution method by means of the Laplace transformation.
We shall without any justiﬁcation assume that there exist solutions from F, and we shall aim at ﬁnding
a solution formula, in which the Laplace transformation enters. Once we have found a candidate of the
solution, we check it by insertion into the diﬀerential equation and the boundary conditions, because
this check will justify our computations.
From time to time we may obtain “solutions” which are not diﬀerentiable, so they do not fulﬁl the
diﬀerential equation in the usual sense. We shall consider these as generalized solutions. A further
investigation of these will lead to the Theory of Distributions, from which we shall only consider
Dirac’s δ “function” in a few cases.
The method is based on the result
(33) L{f ′}(z) = z L{f}(z) −f(0),
for f ∈F,
proved in Section 2.2. We mention in this connection that if f ∈F is only continuous for t →0+,
then f ′(t) does not exist, but . . . The right hand side of (33) makes sense!
Therefore, (33) can
in such cases be considered as the deﬁnition of L{f ′}(z), where f ′ here means diﬀerentiation in a
generalized sense, ﬁxed by equation (33). In scientiﬁc applications this extension of the diﬀerentiability
is very convenient, as long as one does not speculate too much about the diﬀerence between the usual
diﬀerentiation and diﬀerentiation in this generalized sense.
Example 2.5.1 We shall solve the diﬀerential equation with boundary value conditions,

1) The sophisticated method. Rewrite the equation in the following way:

e3tϕ(t) = C2 + C1e2t,
thus
ϕ(t) = C1e−t + C2e−3t,
where C1 and C2 are arbitrary constants. Then it follows from the initial conditions that
ϕ(0) = C1 + C2 = 0
and
ϕ′(t) = −C1 −3C2 = 1,
so C2 = −1
2 and C1 = 1
2, and the solution of (34) becomes
ϕ(t) = 1

2) The classical method. The diﬀerential equation of (34) is linear and homogeneous of constant coef-
ﬁcients. It therefore has a characteristic polynomial, which is obtained by replacing the derivative
ϕ(j)(t) by λj, where λ ∈C. We get
P(λ) = λ2 + 4λ + 3 = (λ + 1)(λ + 3).
The characteristic polynomial P(λ) has the roots λ = −1 and λ = −3, so the complete solution of
the diﬀerential equation is given by
ϕ(t) = C1e−t + C2e3t,
C1, C2 arbitrary constants.
Then it follows from the initial conditions that
ϕ(0) = C1 + C2 = 0
and
ϕ′(t) = −C1 −3C2 = 1,
so C2 = −1
2 and C1 = 1
2, and the solution of (34) becomes
ϕ(t) = 1

3) The method of Laplace transformation. Since ϕ(0) = 0 and ϕ′(0) = 1, we get
L{ϕ′}(z) = z L{ϕ}(z) −ϕ(0) = z L{ϕ}(z),
and
L{ϕ′′}(z) = z L{ϕ′}(z) −ϕ′(0) = z2L{ϕ}(z) −1.

We notice that the factor z2 +4z +3 is precisely the characteristic polynomial found by the second

the rest of the example.
We shall solve the equation
ϕ′(t) −ϕ(t) = H(t −1)
for t ≥0 and ϕ(0) = 0.
Notice that H(t −1) has a discontinuity at t = 1, so one should be careful using elementary calculus
methods, although the method as shown below is possible.

2) We shall now see what happens, if we instead apply the Laplace transformation, where we deﬁne
f ′ by the equation
L{ϕ′}(z) := zL{ϕ}(z) −ϕ(0) = zL{ϕ}(z).
We get

♦
Example 2.5.3 We shall by the Laplace transformation ﬁnd a solution formula for the linear inho-
mogeneous initial value problem



ϕ′′(t) + 2ϕ′(t)0 + 2ϕ(t) = f(t),
ϕ(0) = ϕ′(0) = 0,
for general f ∈F.
By the Laplace transformation,
z2L{ϕ}(z) + 2zL{ϕ}(z) + 2L{ϕ}(z) = L{f}(z),
so
L{ϕ}(z) =

The inverse Laplace transform of

so we get from Theorem 2.4.2 concerning convolutions that

We see that the structure of the solution is that of a convolution. It can be proved that this is always
the case for linear ordinary inhomogeneous diﬀerential equations.
Notice that (35) is the usual solution formula in this speciﬁc example, when we use the Wro´nski
method. ♦
If the linear ordinary diﬀerential equation has variable constants, one can only hope for a successful
application of the Laplace transformation, when the coeﬃcients are at most polynomials of degree at
most 2. This was actually the case in Example 2.4.2, where we found the Laplace transform L {J0} (z)
by transforming the Bessel function (30), i.e.
t J′′
0 (t) + J′
0(t) + t J0(t) = 0,
and then derive the diﬀerential equation

z2 + 1
 d
dz L {J0} (z) + z L {J0} (z) = 0.
The order of the diﬀerential equation of L {J0} (z) is the same as the highest degree of the polynomial
coeﬃcients of the original equation.
At the same time it becomes obvious that if the coeﬃcients of the governing equation are not polyno-
mials or constants, then there is almost no hope of solving it by means of the Laplace transformation.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
3.1
The two-sided Laplace transformation
We proved in Chapter 2 some computational rules for the Laplace transformation. Among these the
Laplace transformation of a derivative, i.e.
(36) L{f ′}(z) = z L{f}(z) −f(0)
for f ∈E,
where we assume that f is piecewise of class C1, and f(0) = limt→0+ f(t) exists, has a strange
mathematical structure. In particular, two facts are indeed odd.
1) If f ∈F, then z L{f}(z) is well-deﬁned, while the classical deﬁnition of the derivative,
(37) f ′ (t0) = lim
t→t0
f(t) −f (t0)
t −t0
is not suﬃcient general in all cases to specify f ′ as a well-deﬁned element. It is, however, possible
to give a convenient deﬁnition of f ′ as a so-called generalized function such that (36) makes sense,
while (37) may not be deﬁned. It is unfortunately not possible here to go through the necessary
arguments from Distribution Theory, so we shall only use heuristic considerations, when we are
dealing with e.g. the δ “function”, which is the simplest such element which is not an ordinary
function.
2) The second problem of (36) is of course the constant −f(0), where f is not transformed, and 0 is
a t-value. Thus, (36) contains both the function f itself and its Laplace transform L{f} as well
as the variables z and t, so in this sense formula (36) is rather messy. The reason is of course the
contribution from the lower bound t = 0, when
 +∞
0
e−ztf ′(t) dt is integrated partially.
The easiest way to avoid the second problem pointed out above is to extend the integration to all of
R, because then the lower bound becomes −∞. We shall in this section consider this possibility, so
we introduce
Deﬁnition 3.1.1 Let f(t), t ∈R, be a (measurable) function. Assume that there is a non-empty
open domain Ωin CC, such that
 +∞
−∞
e−ztf(t) dt
is convergent for all z ∈Ω.
Then we say that f(t) has a two-sided Laplace transform L2{f}(z) in Ω, and it is deﬁned by
L2{f}(z) :=
 +∞
−∞
e−ztf(t) dt
for z ∈Ω.
If f has a two-sided Laplace transform, then
(38) L2{f}(z) =
 +∞
−∞
e−ztf(t) dt =
 0
−∞
e−ztf(t) dt +
 +∞

where the two improper integrals are both convergent. The latter integral on the right hand side of
(38) is the usual Laplace transform of f(t)H(t), where
H(t) :=

denotes the Heaviside function. Hence, the domain of convergence of the latter integral is the usual
half plane of convergence ℜz > a, possibly all of C, and the integral representation is an analytic
function for ℜz > a.
The former integral is treated similarly, only t is negative in the domain of integration, hence the half
plane of convergence must be given by ℜz < b, possibly all of C.
If z fulﬁls a < ℜz < b, then both improper integrals on the right hand side of (38) are convergent.
Hence, if a < b, then f(t) has a two-sided Laplace transform given by
(39) L2{f}(z) =
 +∞
−∞
e−ztf(t) dt
for ℜz ∈]a, b[,
and the domain of convergence is usually a vertical parallel strip in C with a = −∞or b = +∞as
trivial exceptions.
When z belongs to the strip of convergence, then L2{f}(z) is an analytic function of z so we may
again have the possibility of an analytic extension of L2{f}(z) to larger subsets of C.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
Remark 3.1.1 In some sense the extension above of the laplace transformation to the two-sided
Laplace transformation resembles the extension of Taylor series to Laurent series. We know e.g. that
an analytic function have diﬀerent Laurent expansions in diﬀerent annuli. Concerning the two-sided
Laplace transformation, the same analytic function F(z) may be the two-sided Laplace transform
of two diﬀerent functions when restricted to two diﬀerent strips. Therefore, if we want an inversion
formula of the two-sided Laplace transformation, we must always specify the strip of convergence. ♦
Example 3.1.1 Let a > 0, and put f(t) = e−a|t|. We shall ﬁnd the two.sided Laplace transform of
f. Assuming the convergence of the improper integrals we get
L2{f}(z) =
 0
−∞
e−zteat dt +
 +∞
0
e−zte−at dt =

1
a −z e(a−z)t
0
−∞
+

−
1
a + z e−(a+z)t
+∞
0
.
It follows that the conditions of convergence is ℜ(a−z) > 0 and ℜ(−(a+z)) < 0, hence ℜz ∈]−a, a[,
and when this is fulﬁlled, then
L2{f}(z) =
1
a −z +
1
a + z =
2a
a2 −z2
for |ℜz| < a.
Choose instead g(t) = −2 sinh(at) · H(t). Then
L2{g}(z) = −2L{sinh(at)}(z) =
2a
a2 −z2
for ℜz > a,
because g(t) = 0 for t < 0, and where we have used Example 2.1.4.
Finally, if h(t) = 2 sinh(at) · H(−t), then
L2{h}(z) = 2
 0
−∞
sinh(at)e−zt dt =
2a
a2 −z2
for ℜz < −a.
The three totally diﬀerent functions f(t), g(t) and h(t) have formally the same two-sided Laplace
transform
2a
a2 −z2 , where the only diﬀerence is the speciﬁcation of their disjoint strips of convergence.
The danger here is that if each of the three two-sided Laplace transforms is extended analytically to
its largest possible domain C \ {−a, a}, then they are identical. Fortunately, it can be shown that if
one is given the analytic function
F(z) =
2a
a2 −z2
for z ∈Ω= C \ {−a, a},
and then restrict it to one of the three possible vertical strips
ℜz < −a,
−a < ℜz < a,
ℜz > a,
contained in Ω, then we get the right function
h(t),
f(t),
g(t)
resp.
as inverse two-sided Laplace transform.
There is, however, no need here to derive a theory of the inverse two-sided Laplace transformation L−1
2 ,
because it can be derived from the general inverse Laplace transformation, presented in Section 3.5.

Remark 3.1.2 We computed in Example 3.1.1 directly the two-sided Laplace transform of a given
function. In general, it is more standard to use the change of variable τ = −t in one of the integrals,
because then

where L{f} denotes the usual one-sided Laplace transform computed as an integral over [0, +∞[.
This formula is often used, when one explicitly computes L2{f}(z). ♦
3.2
The Fourier transformation
If a = b in (39), page 64 in Section 3.1, then the strip of convergence is obviously empty. Nevertheless,
the improper integral

may still be convergent for z = a + iξ, ξ ∈R. This integral cannot in general be extended analytically
in the variable ξ. Now, the real part a of z is ﬁxed, so by writing f(t) instead of e−atf(t) it follows
that we may assume that a = 0. This heuristic analysis shows that it may also be of interest to
consider another transformation of the form
F{f}(ξ) :=

for ξ ∈R.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
This is the deﬁnition of the Fourier transformation, which we in general shall consider in this section.
Deﬁnition 3.2.1 Let f(x) be a (measurable) function. If the improper integral
 +∞
−∞e−ixξf(x) dx is
convergent for almost every ξ ∈R, then f has a Fourier transform, denoted by either F{f}(ξ) or by
ˆf(ξ), and it is given by
(40) ˆf(i) = F{f}(ξ) =
 +∞
−∞
e−ixξf(x) dx
for almost every ξ ∈R.
Remark 3.2.1 We have in (40) used the most common deﬁnition of the Fourier transformation. The
reader should, however, be aware of that other deﬁnitions may also be met, like e.g.
 +∞

√
2π
 +∞
−∞
e−ixξf(x) dx,

No matter which deﬁnitions is used, the qualitative results will always be the same, but we may have
diﬀerent constants involved. In case of using another deﬁnition the reader should start with identifying
the necessary constants. ♦
Most of the rules of computations of the Laplace transformation have an analogue for the Fourier
transformation.
It is, however, obvious that the Fourier transform of a periodic function is only
deﬁned in the trivial case, when f is a null function.
Theorem 3.2.1 Linearity. Assume that f and g both have a Fourier transform. Let λ, µ ∈C be
complex constants. Then λf + µg have a Fourier transform, which is given by
F{λf + µg}(ξ) = λF{f}(ξ) + µF{g}(ξ)
for almost every ξ ∈R.
Proof. Let F{f}(ξ) be deﬁned for ξ ∈R \ N1, and let F{f}(ξ) be deﬁned for ξ ∈R \ N2, where N1
and N2 are null sets. Then N1 ∪N2 is a null set, and when ξ ∈R \ {N1 ∪N2}, then
 +∞

 +∞
−∞
e−ixξf(x) dx + µ
 +∞
−∞
e−ixξg(x) dx
=
λF{f}(ξ) + µF{g}(ξ).
Hence, the integral on the left hand side is convergent in (at least) R \ (N1 ∪N2), where N1 ∪N2 is
a null set, so it is equal to F{λf + µg}(ξ), and the theorem is proved. □

If both f and f ′ have a Fourier transform, then it can be proved (the proof is not given here) that
f(x) →0 for x →+∞as well as for x →−∞. Using this result it is easy to prove
Theorem 3.2.5 Fourier transformation of derivatives. If f ∈C1 and f ′ ∈C0 both have a Fourier
transform, then
F{f ′}(ξ) = iξ ˆf(ξ).

The proof of Theorem 3.2.9 is far more diﬃcult than any other of the proofs above, so we shall not
produce it here.
We give some Fourier transforms in Table 4 in Section 4, page 102. Although we have not deﬁned
Dirac’s δ “function”, we shall include some of the results concerning this element, because it is so
frequently used in the technical sciences. Concerning the notation, δ(n) means the n-th derivative of δ,
and δ(h) means δ translated to x = h, i.e. in the usual (incorrect, though understandable) engineering
notation, “δ(h)(x) = δ(x −h)”.

and it follows that ˆf(ξ) is continuous. Hence we have proved above,
Lemma 3.3.2 If f ∈L1, then ˆf(ξ) is a bounded and continuous function in ξ ∈R.
We shall now prove that if f ∈L1, then we also have ˆf(ξ) →0 for ξ →±∞. We start by proving the
following simple lemma.
Lemma 3.3.3 Assume that f(x) is piecewise constant in the interval [−a, a] with a ﬁnite number of
discontinuities. The

and since |2 sin(aξ)| ≤2 for all ξ ∈R, the claim follows.
Then consider the function
f(x) =

for x ∈[−a, b[,
β
for x ∈]b, a].
We notice that since {b} is a null set, there is no need to specify f(b).

and the lemma is proved. ♦
We mention without proof the following simple approximation theorem.
Theorem 3.3.1 Given f ∈L1([−a, a]). To every ε > 0 there exists a piecewise constant function g
with only ﬁnite many diﬀerent values, such that
∥f −g∥1 =
 a
−a
|f(t) −g(t)| dt < ε.
This approximation theorem is used in the proof of the following
Theorem 3.3.2 If f ∈L1(R), then its Fourier transform ˆf(ξ) is continuous and bounded,
 ˆf(ξ)
 ≤∥f∥1
for all ξ ∈R,
and
lim
ξ→−∞
ˆf(ξ) = 0,
lim
ξ→+∞
ˆf(ξ) = 0.
Proof. The ﬁrst two claims were proved in Lemma 3.3.2, so we shall only prove that
ˆf(ξ) →0
for ξ →−∞or ξ →+∞.
From f ∈L1(R) follows that to every given ε > 0 we can ﬁnd a > 0, such that

|f(x)| dx < ε

Then apply Theorem 3.3.1 using the truncated function
f(x) · χ[−a,a](x) ∈L1([−a, a]),
from which follows that there exists a piecewise constant function g(x) of ﬁnitely many values on
[−a, a], such that

Remark 3.3.1 The inversion formula is also written

The inversion formula implies that if f and g have the same Fourier transform, then they are equal
almost everywhere. ♦
Proof. Since we have not developed the full Lebesgue Theory of Integration, we can only give a
correct proof of the inversion formula under the additional assumption that f is continuous. The
general proof will, however, follow the same pattern as the proof when f is continuous.
The next obstacle is that it is not possible here to give a straightforward proof of the inversion formula.
The reason is that if we compute the right hand side of the formula, then

where it is obvious that we cannot interchange the order of integration, because the indeﬁnite integral

ei(x−t)ξ dξ does not have limits for ξ →±∞.
Instead we use the old trick of choosing an auxiliary function g ∈L1, which we later shall choose as
the explicit function g(x) in Lemma 3.3.5. For the time being g is just any function from L1(R).
Choose any g ∈L1, and let ε > 0 be a parameter. Deﬁning gε(ξ) := g(εξ), it follows from the Theorem
of change of scale that
ˆgε(x) = 1
ε ˆg

and
gε ∈L1.
Then it follows from Lemma 3.3.4 that

For ﬁxed x, both functions gε(ξ)· ˆf(ξ) and ˆg(y)f(x+εy) belong to L1, so both integrands are absolutely
integrable for every ε > 0.
At this step we choose g(ξ) = exp

with g(0) = 1, and then let ε →0+ under the integral

Theorem 3.3.5 Fourier’s residuum inversion formula I. Assume that F(ζ) is analytic in an open
domain Ω, which contains the closed upper half plane ℑζ ≥0, except for a ﬁnite number of singularities
{ζ1, . . . , ζn}, where all ℑζj > 0.
Furthermore, assume that there exist positive constants R, α, c > 0, such that we have the estimate
|F(ζ)| ≤

|ζ|α
for ℑζ ≥0 and |ζ| ≥R.

Then all singularities ζ1, . . . , ζn in the upper half plane lie inside CR1,R2, because they all lie in the
set {ζ ∈C | ℑζ > 0, |ζ| < R}.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
Proof. If x > 0, then the ﬁrst result of (50) was proved in Theorem 3.3.5. If x < 0, we modify
the proof of Theorem 3.3.5 in the following way. The curve CR1,R2 is reﬂected in the ξ-axis, and the
orientation of the curve is reversed, such that the segment on the ξ-axis is traversed from R2 to −R1,
explaining the change of sign in (50). The ﬁnal claim of Corollary 3.3.1 follows from the ﬁrstFourier’s
inversion formula. □
Example 3.3.1 Choose F(ζ) =
1
1 + ζ2 . Then F(ζ) is analytic in C\{−i, i}, and we have the estimate
|F(ζ)| =
1
|1 + ζ2| ≤
2
|ζ|2
for |ζ| ≥2.
Furthermore, F(ξ) lies in L1(R) for ξ ∈R.
It follows from Corollary 3.3.1 that

for x < 0,
hence
f(x) = 1

Thus, to every R > 1 there is a cR > 0, such that

This is an example which shows that if f ∈L1 is not continuous, then F(ξ) = ˆf(ξ) can never belong
to L1. The general proof goes as follows. If ˆf ∈L1, then it would follow from the inversion formula
and Theorem 3.3.2 that f(x) = 1

Example 3.3.3 Let F(ζ) =

|F(ζ)| =
1
|ζ −i|2 ≤
2
|ζ|2
for |ζ| > 2,
so F(ξ) ∈L1(R). It then follows from Theorem 3.3.2 that f(x) = 1
2π F{F(ξ)}(−x) is continuous.
Since F(ζ) does not have singularities in the lower half plane, the function f(x) given by (50) must
be 0 for x < 0, and by the continuity, also for x = 0. When x > 0, then

It is easy to check that if we add f(0) = 0, then f(x) becomes continuous, and also f ∈L1. ♦

brieﬂy return to the family of Bessel functions in Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The Laplace

The Mellin transformation
For completeness we shall also consider the so-called Mellin transformation, which is deﬁned as an
operator on the set of functions f by the following
(53) M{f}(a) :=
 +∞
0
f(x) xa dx
x ,
which is a function of the variable a, provided that the improper integral is convergent.
If the integral of (53) is absolutely convergent, we change variable, x = e−t, to get
(54) M{f}(a) :=
 +∞
0
f(x) xa dx
x =
 +∞
−∞
f

e−t
e−at dt,
where the right hand side is the two-sided Laplace transform of the function g(t) := f (e−t) at the
point a. This shows the connection between the Mellin transformation and the two-sided Laplace
transformation.
In order not to get into trouble of deﬁning the right branch of xa for a complex we shall always assume
that the exponent a ∈R is real. We shall furthermore assume that f(z) is analytic in C except for a
ﬁnite number of singularities, none of these lying on the positive real axis R. Usually one also assumes
that all singularities are poles. However, the proof below will show that we only require that a possible
singularity at z = 0 is at most a pole. Any other singularity may be a pole or an essential singularity.
Then we turn to the factor xa of the integrand. If a ∈Z, then za is deﬁned in the usual way for z ̸= 0
(and also for z = 0, if a ∈N0). Assume that a ∈R \ Z, and ﬁx the following branch of the logarithm,
Log0 z := ln |z| + i Arg0 z,
where Arg0 z ∈]0, 2π[,
for z ∈C \ (R+ ∪{0}). The branch cut is along the positive real axis, and the argument is the angle
of the vector −→z ̸= −→0 , measured from R+ in the positive sense of the plane. We deﬁne
(55) za := exp (a · Log0 z)
for z ∈C \ (R+ ∪{0}) .
It should be obvious, why we cannot use the principal logarithm.
Since za is composed of analytic functions, it is also analytic in the open domain Ω:= C\(R+ ∪{0}),
and it is easy to prove from (55) that
d
dz za = a za−1
for z ∈Ω,
which is what we also would hope for.
Put z = r eiΘ, where r > 0 and 0 < Θ < 2π. Then we get from (55) that
(56) |za| = | exp(a{ln r + iΘ})| = ra,
because a ∈R was chosen real.
Remark 3.4.1 It is possible to allow a ∈C, but then (56) should be modiﬁed. The details are left
to the interested reader. ♦

Proof. As usual it is only a matter of choosing the right path of integration CR,r,ϕ in
Ω′ := Ω\ (R+ ∪{0}). We choose this path as the one given in Figure 10, where we also assume that
R ≥R0 and r ≤r0 and 0 < ϕ < π

The complex inversion formula II
We proved in Section 2.3 a residuum formula of the inverse Laplace transform of an analytic function
F(z), deﬁned in a domain of the form C \ {z1, . . . , zn}, and which fulﬁlled an estimate of the form
|F(z)| ≤
c
|z|α
for |z| ≥R,
where c, α, R > 0 are ﬁxed constants.
We shall in this section prove a more general inversion formula, where we only require that F(z)
is deﬁned in some domain Ω, which contains a right half plane. The proof is unexpectedly using
Fourier’s inversion formula.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
Theorem 3.5.1 We make the following assumptions:
1) Assume that F(z) is analytic in an open domain Ωwhich contains a right half plane ℜz > σ0.
2) Assume that there exists a σ1 ≥σ0, such that for every δ > 0 one can ﬁnd A > 0, such that for
every x > σ1 and every y ∈R, for which |y| ≥A, we have
|F(x + iy)| < δ.
3) Finally, we assume that there is an x0 > σ0, such that the integral
(61)
1
2πi
 x0+i∞
x0−i∞
F(z) ezt dz,
for t > 0,
represents a function from the class of functions F in the variable t. In particular, the improper
integral (61) is convergent for almost every t > 0.
Then the function
(62) f(t) :=
1
2πi
 x+i∞
x−i∞
F(z) ezt dz,
for t > 0,
is convergent for almost every t > 0 and all x > σ1.
Furthermore, except for a null set, the function f(t) is independent of the choice of x > σ1, and f ∈F,
and
L{f}(z) = F(z).
Thus, the inverse Laplace transform of F(z) is, apart from a null set, given by (62).

Proof. Let x0 be given as above, and choose any x > σ1. Finally, choose t > 0, such that the
improper line integral along the vertical line through x0 is convergent.

Given δ > 0, choose A > 0 as in the condition above and consider the simple, closed curve CA as

the claim follows by letting δ →0+, and we have proved that (62) is independent of x > σ1. In
particular, f ∈F, and there exists a σ2 ∈R, such that
(63)
 +∞

e−σt |f(t)| dt < +∞
for every σ > σ2.
We deﬁne for every ﬁxed x > max {σ1, σ2} an auxiliary function ϕx by
ϕx(t) =



e−xt f(t)
for t > 0,
0
for t ≤0.
It follows from 63) that ϕx ∈L1(R).

e−iyt ϕx(t) dt = ˆϕx(y),
which shows that the Laplace transform of f at the point z = x+iy, where x > max {σ1, σ2}, is equal
to the Fourier transform of ϕx at the point y ∈R.
Since ϕx ∈L1 for x > σ2, Fourier’s inversion formula holds for ˆϕx, hence
ϕx(t) = 1

where the line integral is taken along the straight vertical line which goes through x > max {σ1, σ2}
on the x-axis.
On the other hand, f(t) is given by (62), and since both improper integrals are convergent for
x > max {σ1, σ2}, it follows that
 x+i∞
x−i∞
{F(z) −L{f}(z)} ezt dz = 0
for almost every t > 0,
and we conclude that
(64) F(z) = L{f}(z)
for almost every z, for which ℜz > max {σ1, σ2} .
Finally, both F(z) and L{f}(z) are analytic functions, in particular continuous, so (64) holds for every
z, for which ℜz > max {σ1, σ2}, and the theorem is proved. □
Remark 3.5.1 Theorem 3.5.1 is more general than Theorem 43, because it also covers cases, where
we consider branches of many-valued functions where the branch cuts lie in a left half plane. The
integral (62) is called a Bromwich integral. ♦

shall ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform of F(z). ♦

□
The factor n! of the transition formulæ bn = n! an, or an = 1
n! bn, indicates once more that if we shall
get an optimum beneﬁt of the theory of the Laplace transformation, then we need some new functions,
which are not included in the usual courses of elementary Calculus.
These “new” transcendental
functions are for historical reasons called Special Functions. A better word, however, would be Useful
Functions, because they almost certainly always pop up in more advanced applications of the Laplace
transformation in the technical sciences. We see here that these special functions are necessary, if
we want to apply the theory of Laplace transformation on other cases than just when F(z) is a
quotient between two polynomials. The introduction of the most necessary special functions is given
in Chapter 1 of Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The Laplace Transformation II.
Example 3.6.1 We shall here give an example of what we may encounter in general. We choose

It follows by an analytic extension that this also holds for ℜz > 0 and that

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
3.7
A catalogue of methods of ﬁnding the Laplace transform and the in-
verse Laplace transform
In this ﬁnal section we shall sketch a catalogue of possible methods when we want to compute either the
Laplace transform or the inverse Laplace transform of a given function. We also list some methods,
where the corresponding examples are postponed to Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The
Laplace Transformation II.
3.7.1
Methods of ﬁnding Laplace transforms
1) Direct application of the deﬁnition
L{f}(z) :=
 +∞
0
e−zt f(t) dt.
The simplest examples of Laplace transforms were computed by using the deﬁnition alone. It is
possible in some more complicated cases, though in far from all of them, to use this primitive
approach which only requires some knowledge of practical integration.
2) The method of series expansion.
If
f(t) =
+∞

n=0
an tn
is convergent for all t > 0,
then formally,
L{f}
+∞

n=0
n! an ·
1
zn+1 .
If this Laurent series expansion is convergent for |z| > R, where R < +∞is ﬁnite, then it is indeed
the Laplace transform of f(t), deﬁned in the set, where |z| > R. This is the result of Theorem 3.6.1
in Section 3.6.
The method requires at least that f(t) is the restriction of an analytic function f(z) deﬁned in
all of C. Another requirement is of course that the indicated Laurent series of L{f}(z) is indeed
convergent for |z| > R for some ﬁnite R.
3) The method of Laplace transforming a diﬀerential equation.
This method was applied in Example 2.4.2, where we found the Laplace transform of the Bessel
function J0(t) of order 0. We apply the Laplace transformation on the Bessel equation of order
0, and then use the rules of computation to get a (hopefully) simpler diﬀerential equation in the
complex variable z. If it really is simpler, then we solve it by elementary methods. Finally, the
constants are found either by the initial value theorem or the ﬁnal value theorem.
4) Diﬀerentiation with respect to a parameter.
An example of this method is postponed to Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The Laplace
Transformation II, where we shall ﬁnd the Laplace transform of the function f(t) = ln t, t > 0.
5) Application of tables.
This method requires that one owns a suﬃciently large table to cover all the functions needed.
So far we have only systematically found the Laplace transforms of Table 1 on page 17. A larger
table is given by Table 2 on page 102.

Other transformations and the general inversion formula
3.7.2
Computation of inverse Laplace transforms
1) Decomposition.
This method is used, when
F(z) = P(z)
Q(z) e−az,
where P(z) and Q(z) are polynomials, for which deg Q > deg P. One decomposes the fraction
P(z)
Q(z). The exponential e−az is handled by using the Second Translation Property.
2) Method of series expansion.
If
L{f}(z) =
+∞

n=0
bn ·
1
zn+1
for |z| > R,
then
f(t) =
+∞

n=0
1
n! bn tn
for t > 0.
This method was used in Example 3.6.1 and in Example 3.6.2. It requires that the given function
L{f}(z) can be written as a convergent Laurent series for |z| > R, and that an = 0 for every
n ∈N0.
3) The method of applying a diﬀerential equation.
First establish a diﬀerential equation of the given function L{f}(z) = F(z). Then use the rules
of computation, given in Section 2.2, to obtain a diﬀerential equation of f(t), which hopefully is
simple enough to be solved.
4) Diﬀerentiation with respect to a parameter.
An example of this method is postponed to Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The Laplace
transformation II.
5) Applications of tables.
The comments are the same as above. We shall of course use either Table 1 on page 17, or Table 2
on page 102.
6) The complex inversion formula.
This is given in two versions. The simpler one in Section 2.3 is a residuum formula, so one shall
always be extremely careful of checking all the assumptions, because residuum formulæ usually
give very wrong “results”, when these are not satisﬁed.
The general formula of Section 3.5 is a line integral (a Bromwich integral) along a vertical line.
This method is in particular used when F(z) is a branch of a many-valued function. We shall
postpone the more diﬃcult applications of this formula to Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5,
The Laplace Transformation II.
