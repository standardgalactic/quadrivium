Dummies, which won a 2002 Lowell Thomas Travel Writing Award
for best guidebook.
Liz Albertson (Chapter 12) worked as an editor for Frommer’s
Travel Guides for four years before making the leap to the other
side of the computer as the author of Ireland For Dummies. When
she isn’t researching and writing, Liz spends much of her time in
Ireland sitting in on traditional music sessions, fiddle in hand. She
currently teaches fifth and sixth grade in New Haven, Connecticut.
Cheryl A. Pientka (Chapter 13) is a freelance journalist and a liter-
ary scout. She is the author of Paris For Dummies and co-author of
France For Dummies. A graduate of Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism and the University of Delaware, she lives in
New York when she can’t be in Paris.
George McDonald (Chapter 14) is a former deputy editor of and
currently contributing writer for Holland Herald, the in-flight maga-
zine for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. He has written extensively
about Amsterdam and the Netherlands for international magazines
and travel books such as Frommer’s Belgium, Holland &
Luxembourg and Frommer’s Europe.
Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince (Chapters 16 and 17) have
written numerous best-selling Frommer’s guides and are co-
authors of Frommer’s Europe. Porter is a former bureau chief for
the Miami Herald, and Prince, who began writing with Porter in
1982, worked for the Paris bureau of the New York Times.
Hana Mastrini (Chapter 18) is a native of the western Czech spa
town of Karlovy Vary who became a veteran of the “Velvet
Revolution” as a student in Prague in 1989. She is the author of
Frommer’s Prague & the Best of the Czech Republic and co-author of
Frommer’s Europe and Frommer’s Europe by Rail.

Bruce Murphy and Alessandra de Rosa (Chapters 19–21) are part-
time residents of Rome. Murphy’s work has appeared in magazines
ranging from Cruising World to Critical Inquiry. An avid traveler
since her first cross-Europe trip at the age of 2, de Rosa was born
in Rome and has lived and worked in Rome, Paris, and New York
City. They are the authors of Italy For Dummies and Rome For
Dummies.
Neil Schlecht (Chapters 22 and 23) is a writer and cycling afi-
cionado who has lived in Spain, Brazil, and Ecuador. He has
worked in Spain as an English teacher, a consultant on social and
economic development projects for the European Union, and as a
contributing writer for a Spanish art and antiques magazine. He is
the author of a dozen travel guides, including Spain For Dummies.
Vancouver-born Tania Kollias (Chapter 24) longed to travel since a
teen trip to England to meet the relatives, and used a Frommer’s
guide for her first solo journey to Europe. A degree, four conti-
nents, and many journals later, she now lives in her father’s native
Athens, Greece, where she wrote the country’s first comprehen-
sive listings book for expats, edited the Now in Athens monthly for
the 2004 Olympics, and still works as a journalist and writer. She
travels in and out of Greece whenever she gets the chance.

Introduction
F
inally, you’re taking that long-awaited trip to Europe. Congratulations!
You’re about to embark on a great adventure, and in addition to the
excitement, you may feel a bit overwhelmed. You have lots of plans to
make: where to stay, where to dine, how long to remain in each country,
how to travel from place to place, and which attractions to see — but
we’re here to help you every step of the way. You already took a step in
the right direction by buying Europe For Dummies, 5th Edition!
About This Book
You have in your possession a reference tool, not a guidebook that you
have to read from cover to cover. Open up this book to any chapter to
find the answers on how to make your European travel dreams come
true. You can read Europe For Dummies from start to finish if you want,
but if you’re already familiar with some aspects of international travel,
feel free to skip over the first two parts and jump right into the destina-
tion descriptions.
This is a selective guidebook to Europe. Our goal throughout is to give
you a really good selection of each country’s highlights. That means we
exclude places that other, more exhaustive guidebooks routinely
include. Brussels, Copenhagen, and Lisbon are important cities, but
from the perspective of the first-time visitor to Europe, they can’t com-
pete with London, Paris, and Madrid. In addition, so much is really
worth seeing in Europe that you don’t need to waste your time with the
second-rate, the overrated, or the boring.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. We, therefore, suggest that
you write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans.
The authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all favorite
targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
If you’ve ever tried to extract some information from a guidebook and
felt that you needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret all the differ-
ent symbols, we’re happy to report that you won’t have that problem

with user-friendly Europe For Dummies. The use of symbols and abbrevi-
ations is kept to a minimum.
The few conventions that we do use include the following:
 Abbreviations for credit cards: AE (American Express), DC (Diners
Club), MC (MasterCard), and V (Visa).
 Two prices for everything: First in the local currency, which often
is the euro (), followed by the U.S. dollar equivalent. These dollar
conversions were calculated using the exchange rate listed in each
destination chapter and were accurate at press time.
Exchange rates can and will fluctuate, and the rate probably will
not be the same when you visit. However, because the fluctuations
tend to stay within around 10 percent to 20 percent, our conver-
sions give you a fair idea about how much you’ll pay (assuming the
price itself doesn’t go up, of course). But be aware that money mar-
kets worldwide have been volatile, to say the least, and that the
U.S. dollar has been trading low against the euro.
 Dollar-sign ratings for all hotels and restaurants: The number 
of signs indicates the range of costs for one night in a double-
occupancy hotel room or for a meal at a restaurant (excluding 
alcohol), from $ (budget) to $$$$$ (splurge). Because of the
number of countries covered in this book, these ratings are rela-
tive, applied on a city-by-city basis. So a $ hotel in pricey London
may be a quirky bed-and-breakfast with shared bathrooms; but a 
$ hotel in far-cheaper Athens may well be a centrally located mid-
scale hotel. The same goes for restaurants: At a rustic $$$$ joint in
Madrid, you may get a delicious, stick-to-your-ribs stew for about
$30; but a $$$$ restaurant in Paris dishes up fancy, haute-cuisine
dishes that can cost as much as $85 per course.
 Two categories for hotels: Our personal favorites (the “tops”) and
those that don’t quite make our preferred list but still get our
hearty seal of approval (the “runners-up”). Don’t be shy about con-
sidering those in the second category if you’re unable to get a room
at one of our favorites or if your preferences differ from ours. The
amenities that the runner-up hotels offer and the services that they
provide make all of them good choices to consider as you deter-
mine where to rest your head at night.
 Cross-references to maps: For those hotels, restaurants, and
attractions that are plotted on a map, a page reference is provided
in the listing information. If a hotel, restaurant, or attraction is out-
side the city limits or in an out-of-the-way area, it may not be
mapped.

Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made some assumptions about you and what
your needs may be as a traveler. Here’s what we assumed about you:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Europe and how to plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t have a lot of
time to devote to trip planning or you don’t have a lot of time to
spend in Europe when you get there. You want expert advice on
how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Europe or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction
available to you. Instead, you’re looking for a book that focuses on
the places that will give you the best or most memorable experi-
ence in Europe.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Europe For Dummies gives you the
information you’re looking for.
How This Book Is Organized
We divide Europe For Dummies into six parts. The first two parts cover
planning and travel skills. The next three parts divide Europe into three
regions; you get the lowdown on 15 of Europe’s most popular destina-
tions, with each chapter organized as a mini-guidebook. You find the
information you need to conquer each city: how to get around, local cus-
toms, the best hotels and restaurants for every budget, out-of-the-way
gems, noteworthy day trips, and more, all with little in the way of histori-
cal background. We even recommend how much time to spend at each
major attraction. The last part includes some fun top-ten lists as well as
an appendix packed with helpful travel info you can use on the go.
Part I: Introducing Europe
This part covers where to go, how to link it all together, and how to
budget for your dream trip. We give you our picks of the best destina-
tions and sights and our recommendations for the most fun-packed itin-
eraries to fit your interests and vacation schedule.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe
If you’re looking for a deal (and isn’t everybody?), read on. This part
reveals the tricks of the trade for finding the best prices on plane tickets,
rail passes, and car rentals. We help you find the best hotel in any price
range and share budgeting tricks so that you can travel Europe without
Introduction 3

breaking the bank. We discuss tips for students, seniors, families, travel-
ers with disabilities, and gay and lesbian travelers. Then we guide you
through applying for passports; making reservations; dealing with trip
insurance, health issues, and Customs; and figuring out how to keep in
touch while traveling. We do everything but pack your bag!
Part III: The British Isles
First, we help you discover London and make side trips in England to
Bath, Salisbury and Stonehenge, and Oxford. Then we direct you north
to Edinburgh and other Scottish highlights such as Loch Ness,
Inverness, and Glasgow. Finally, we take you across the waters to
Dublin and the best of Ireland’s countryside, from the Wicklow
Mountains to the Ring of Kerry.
Part IV: Central Europe
Many adventures await you in Central Europe. From the much-loved and
ever-popular city of Paris, we take you to the palace at Versailles and
the Gothic cathedral at Chartres. After cruising Amsterdam’s famous
canals, we help you explore the Dutch tulip fields in Haarlem and enjoy
the Hoge Veluwe Park with its Kröller-Müller Museum. In Germany, we
bring you to Munich and Bavaria, where you can drink beer with
oompah bands and explore Neuschwanstein, the ultimate Romantic
castle.
You raise a glass (of coffee) to the Hapsburgs in genteel Vienna before
heading to Innsbruck in the Austrian Alps. Finally, you head to the mag-
ical baroque cityscape of Prague in the Czech Republic.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe
The bright Mediterranean basin has been home to Europe’s great civi-
lizations. From the multilayered city of Rome, we direct you to Naples
and the ancient ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii, each just a day trip
away. Then you journey to Florence, the city of the Renaissance, and the
nearby Tuscan towns of Pisa, Siena, and San Gimignano, which help
bring the Middle Ages back to life. We round out our Italian tour with the
canal city of Venice, one of the most beautiful and unusual cities on
Earth.
Next we take you to Spain. You start in Madrid, which houses great
museums and tapas bars, and the nearby towns of Toledo and Segovia,
medieval gems that provide respite from big-city sightseeing. Then you
visit the great city of Barcelona, with its modernismo architecture and
Gothic quarter.
Finally, to Athens we go, pointing out the ancient ruins and best hotels
and restaurants in a metropolis that underwent a major upgrade for the
2004 Olympic Summer Games. From Athens, we guide you to further
antiquities in Delphi and then on to the Greek island villa of Santoríni.

Part I
Introducing Europe

In this part . . .
W
hat comes to mind when you’re looking at a map of
Europe? So many beautiful countries, so many glam-
orous cities, and so many possible itineraries. Before you
jump on that plane, you need a travel plan that allows you to
visit as many of the places on your wish list as possible. This
part guides you through the necessary steps that you need to
take in order to build your ideal travel plan. In these chap-
ters, we introduce you to Europe, help you decide when and
where to go, and give you ﬁve great itineraries.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Europe
In This Chapter
 Finding the best museums, historic sights, food, and architecture
 Discarding misconceptions before you go
 Traveling to the most intriguing cities and attractions
E
urope offers a roster of the world’s most exciting cities, romantic
landscapes, outstanding museums, historic sights, culinary cre-
ations, and architectural wonders. In this book, we guide you to the best
of the best.
In order to make your trip as smooth and hassle-free as possible, 
you need to start planning a few months before you leave. You’ll be 
dealing with things such as passports (see Chapter 9), rail passes (see
Chapter 6), plane tickets (see Chapter 5), and foreign currencies (see
Chapter 4). But for now, just sit back and dream of the possibilities.
You can sail past time-washed palaces and grandiose churches on Venice’s
Grand Canal for the price of a bus ticket. You can splurge on a five-star
meal or people-watch from a sidewalk cafe in Paris. You can wander
through the Tower of London, ground zero for so much English history
over the last 900 years. Or you can drain creamy mugs of Guinness while
clapping along to traditional Celtic music on a pub crawl through Dublin.
You may want to gaze in stupefied wonder at the famed scene of God
Creating Adam on Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel ceiling in Rome. Or you
may linger over breakfast in a revolving restaurant atop Switzerland’s
Schilthorn Mountain, surrounded by snow-covered peaks and glacier-filled
valleys. How about a picnic lunch on the Greek island of Santoríni, hun-
dreds of feet above the Mediterranean amid the ruins of a Mycenaean city?
Europe, with all its bewitching and unforgettable sights, is yours to dis-
cover, experience, and enjoy. To get you started on your European adven-
tures, this chapter gives you a selection of what we consider to be the
“best of the best” choices. The highlights in this chapter are also tagged
with the Best of the Best icon in the destination chapters of this book.

The Top Museums
Europe is home to some of the world’s greatest museums, displaying a
cultural kaleidoscope of Western and worldwide art and artifacts, dating
from prehistoric times to the present day. Classical busts, Renaissance
paintings and sculptures, Impressionist landscapes, Cubist portraits,
contemporary installations — in the museums of Europe, you’ll find
incredible riches from every epoch and in every style.
 The Louvre (Paris): Our short list has to start with the Louvre (see
Chapter 13), one of those great treasure-trove museums that daz-
zles with ancient sculptures (including that armless beauty Venus
de Milo), Egyptian mummies and medieval artifacts, and some true
icons of Renaissance art, including da Vinci’s Mona Lisa and
Delacroix’s ultra-French Liberty Leading the People.
 Musée d’Orsay (Paris): After exhausting yourself at the Louvre, you
can cross the Seine River to visit an old train station that’s been
transformed into the Musée d’Orsay (see Chapter 13). This
museum picks up the thread of French art where the Louvre leaves
off, highlighting the best from the Romantic period onward, includ-
ing the world’s greatest collection of crowd-pleasing Impressionists
such as Manet, Monet, Degas, Cézanne, Renoir, Gauguin, van Gogh,
Seurat, and more.
 The Vatican Museums (Rome): One of Europe’s greatest collec-
tions, the Vatican Museums (see Chapter 19) inspire at every turn.
The Vatican’s Painting Gallery houses Raphael’s Transfiguration and
Caravaggio’s Deposition. The antiquities collections preserve some
of the world’s greatest examples of ancient Greek, Egyptian,
Etruscan, and Roman sculpture. This is where you find the former
private papal apartments, frescoed by Pinturicchio and Raphael,
and, of course, the perennially awe-inspiring Sistine Chapel, with its
ceiling frescoed by Michelangelo.
 The British Museum (London): You can get up close and personal
with artifacts from the dawn of human history at London’s
renowned (and admission-free) British Museum (see Chapter 10).
Fabulous examples from every epoch of the ancient European,
Mediterranean, or Middle Eastern worlds are on view: Celtic treas-
ure hordes; the Parthenon Sculptures of Greece; remains of
Assyrian palaces; the Rosetta stone, which helped archaeologists
crack the language of hieroglyphics; intricately decorated Greek
vases; and superb examples of Egyptian mummies. And that’s just
the beginning.
 Museo Nacional del Prado (Madrid): In the Prado (see Chap-
ter 22), you get to enjoy masterworks by the greats of Spanish 
art — courtly and insightful works by Velázquez, dark and tragic
images by Goya, elongated and uniquely colorful canvases by El
Greco, and nightmarishly surreal paintings by Hieronymus Bosch.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
12

 The Galleria degli Uffizi (Florence): Take a stroll through the
Galleria degli Uffizi (Uffizi Galleries; see Chapter 20), a veritable
textbook on the development of Italian painting during the
Renaissance. Compared to the great museums of other cities, the
Uffizi is small, but it houses an embarrassment of riches, from ear-
lier works by Giotto, Fra Angelico, and Botticelli (the goddess-on-a-
half-shell Birth of Venus and flower-filled Primavera both hang here)
through the height of the Renaissance, represented by da Vinci,
Raphael, and Michelangelo.
 The Deutsches Museum (Munich): Overloaded on art and ancient
relics? Head to the Deutsches Museum (see Chapter 15), one of the
world’s greatest science and technology museums. Here you’ll find
fleets of early Mercedes, eye-popping electrical demonstrations, a
hangar full of historic aircraft, lab benches where famous experi-
ments in nuclear physics took place, and giant machines used to
dig tunnels under the Alps. This informative and often hands-on
museum is a delight for all ages.
The Top Historic Sights
Europe is the wellspring of Western culture, a living textbook of human
history. Europeans think in terms of centuries and millennia, not
decades. Americans may speak of the ’60s; Italians just as breezily refer
to il seicento (the 1600s). Europe allows you to dip into history at just
about any point. You’re surrounded by it in every city you visit.
 Best Greek and Roman ruins: You can see remnants of the ancient
Greek and Roman empires and the remains of massive temples
some 1,500 to 3,000 years old at the Acropolis or Ancient Agora in
Athens and at Delphi (see Chapter 24). In Rome, you can wander
through the Roman Forum and explore the ultimate sports arena of
the ancient world, the Colosseum (see Chapter 19).
 Best prehistoric sites: Prehistoric standouts include the brooding
standing stones of Stonehenge (see Chapter 10), in England; the
ruins of the ancient Minoan city of Akrotíri (see Chapter 24), on
the Greek island of Santoríni; the Stone Age passage tomb of
Newgrange (see Chapter 12), in Ireland; and remnants of the earli-
est settlements of what is now Paris, excavated under the square in
front of Notre-Dame Cathedral (see Chapter 13).
 Best castles: You’ll find castles and fortified structures from 
the Dark Ages and Middle Ages (from A.D. 500 to 1500) strewn
across Europe. Pride of place goes to the Tower of London (see
Chapter 10), with its bloody legends and famed crown jewels;
Edinburgh Castle (see Chapter 11), glowering atop a volcanic hill
in the center of the city; and Prazsk; Hrad (Prague Castle; see
Chapter 18), with its soaring cathedral and half-timbered lane of old
alchemists’ shops.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Europe 13

 Best medieval neighborhoods: The medieval era saw the develop-
ment of now-major cities throughout Europe, leaving behind a
legacy of fascinating cobblestone medieval quarters such as the
Altstadt of Bern (see Chapter 17), the Staré Mesto in Prague (see
Chapter 18), Trastevere in Rome (see Chapter 19), and the Barri
Gòtic in Barcelona (see Chapter 23).
 Best hill towns: Tiny hill towns and hamlets sprang up between 
A.D. 500 and 1500, and this book describes the best of them, includ-
ing Chartres in France (see Chapter 13), Innsbruck in Austria (see
Chapter 16), the Tuscan hill towns of Siena and San Gimignano
(both in Chapter 20), and Spain’s time capsules of Toledo and
Segovia (both in Chapter 22).
The Top Culinary Delights
European cuisine runs the gamut from stick-to-your-ribs rösti (deluxe
hash browns spiked with ham and eggs) of the Swiss Alps to France’s
traditional coq au vin (chicken braised in red wine, with onions and
mushrooms). Mix in the fabulous pastas of Italy, the dozens of types of
sausage in Prague and Munich, and the incredible yet unknown cheeses
of Ireland, and you’re in for a festive feast every day of your European
journey.
 Best Mediterranean meals: The cooking of Italy (see Chapters 19–21)
goes far beyond pasta, which is merely considered a primo, or first
course. For your secondo, or second course, you can sample Adriatic
fish in a Venetian trattoria patronized by local gondoliers, dig into a
mighty bistecca fiorentina (an oversize T-bone brushed with olive
oil and cracked pepper and then grilled) in Florence, or dine on
saltimbocca (wine-cooked veal layered with sage and prosciutto) in
a Roman restaurant located in the ruins of an ancient theater.
A night out in Madrid (see Chapter 22), where dinner starts at 
10 p.m., may mean a traditional roast suckling pig in a restaurant
unchanged since the days when Hemingway was a regular, or a giant
Valencian paella (rice tossed with a seafood medley) to share with
everyone at the table under the wood beams of a country-style inn.
Meanwhile, Barcelona (see Chapter 23) has become one of Europe’s
hottest dining destinations, with fresh seafood right out of the
Mediterranean and highly imaginative takes on Catalan cooking.
 Best British meals: England (see Chapter 10) once had a reputation
for serving the worst food in Europe. Traditional favorites still
include shepherd’s pie (ground lamb capped by mashed potatoes),
fish and chips, and bangers and mash (sausages and mashed pota-
toes). But, oh, how times have changed. Much to Paris’s chagrin,
London now enjoys the hottest restaurant scene in Europe, and its
celebrity chefs and designer dining spots surf the crest of modern
cooking trends and serve the hippest fusion cuisines. Even the old
traditional dishes taste better now that they’ve been “rediscovered.”
Part I: Introducing Europe 
14

 Best bets for a sweet tooth: French and Italian pastries are divine,
but you can also sate your sweet tooth in Vienna (see Chapter 16),
home of the Sachertorte, the original Death by Chocolate. And
what better way to cap off a night of clubbing in Madrid than to join
the locals for churros y chocolada (fried dough strips you dip in
thick hot chocolate) as the sun rises? Don’t worry: You’ll do so
much walking on your trip that you probably won’t gain too much
weight . . . assuming of course you don’t discover the gelato
(super-rich ice cream) of Florence (see Chapter 20) or sticky toffee
puddings in England (see Chapter 10).
 Best beer and wine: You can savor some of the finest wines in the
world in France, Italy, and Spain, or take a swig from a liter-sized
mug of beer in Germany. But did you know that Eastern European
beers are finally getting the recognition they deserve in Prague (see
Chapter 18)? And rightly so, because all Pilseners, and what
became Budweiser, originally hail from the Czech Republic. And
how about the heuriger in Vienna (see Chapter 16)? These small,
family-run wine estates serve up their white wines accompanied by
simple, hearty Austrian dishes.
The Architectural Highlights
Europe’s famous cathedrals, palaces, and castles draw visitors from
around the globe. You can enjoy the sight of devilish gargoyles and
marvel at the ancient rose windows in Paris’s Cathédrale de Notre-
Dame (see Chapter 13), gape at Michelangelo’s Pietà sculpture and
Bernini’s towering altar canopy in Rome’s St. Peter’s Basilica (see
Chapter 19), and admire magnificent creations of medieval masonry and
Renaissance engineering everywhere in between.
 Chartres Cathedral (beyond Paris): Chartres Cathedral (see
Chapter 13) is a study in formal Gothic, from its 27,000 square feet
of stained glass to its soaring spires and flying buttresses.
 Westminster Abbey (London): Britain’s most revered church,
Westminster Abbey (see Chapter 10) has been the site of corona-
tions and the final resting place of kings and queens for some eight
centuries.
 St. Mark’s Basilica (Venice): The multiple domes, rounded arch-
ways, and glittering mosaics of St. Mark’s Basilica (see Chapter 21)
hint at how this great trading power of the Middle Ages sat at the
crossroads of Eastern and Western cultures; it’s as much Byzantine
as it is European.
 The Duomo (Florence): When the Renaissance genius Brunelleschi
invented a noble dome to cap Florence’s Duomo (see Chapter 20),
Europe’s architectural landscape changed forever. For the first time
since antiquity, domes started sprouting up all over Europe. Visit
Florence’s original, and you can clamber up narrow staircases
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Europe 15

between the dome’s onion layers to see just how Brunelleschi per-
formed his engineering feat — and get a sweeping panorama of the
city from the top.
 Residenz Palace and Schloss Nymphenburg (Munich): In the 17th
and 18th centuries, powerful kings governing much of Europe
claimed they ruled by divine right and built palaces to prove it. The
Bavarian Wittelsbach dynasty ruled for 738 years from Munich’s
Residenz Palace and the pleasure palace outside town, Schloss
Nymphenburg (see Chapter 15).
 Hofburg Palace (Vienna): The Hapsburg emperors set up house-
keeping in the sprawling Hofburg Palace (see Chapter 16), where
the chapel is now home to a singing group known as the Vienna
Boys’ Choir, and where museums showcase everything from classi-
cal statuary and musical instruments to medieval weaponry and
the imperial treasury.
 Buckingham Palace (London): You can line up to watch the
Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace (see Chapter 10), and
even tour the royal staterooms in August and September, when Her
Majesty Elizabeth II isn’t at home.
 Versailles (beyond Paris): A short train ride from downtown Paris
brings you to the palace to end all palaces, Versailles (see Chap-
ter 13), where Louis XIV held court, Marie Antoinette kept danger-
ously out of touch with her subjects (who were brewing revolution
back in Paris), and the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I was
signed.
 Neuschwanstein (beyond Munich): Tourists aren’t the only ones
looking to recapture a romantic, idealized past. Mad King Ludwig II
of Bavaria was so enamored with his country’s fairy-tale image that
he decided to build Neuschwanstein (see Chapter 15) in the
foothills of the Alps south of Munich. This fanciful 19th-century ver-
sion of what Ludwig thought a medieval castle should look like is a
festival of turrets and snapping banners that later inspired Uncle
Walt’s Cinderella Castle in Disneyland.
 La Sagrada Família and La Pedrera (Barcelona): Lest you think
architectural innovations are all relics of the distant past, head to
Barcelona (see Chapter 23), where one of the greatest architects of
the early 20th century, Antoni Gaudí, used his own unique riff on
Art Nouveau to design everything from surreal apartment build-
ings, such as La Pedrera, to the wild, futuristic church, La Sagrada
Família, still under construction.

 Selecting the best season to travel
 Participating in Europe’s many festivals and feasts
 Picking up a few sightseeing survival tips
T
his chapter takes you through the pros and cons of traveling to
Europe at different times of the year. You also find a rundown of the
most popular festivals, as well as some strategies for staving off sight-
seeing overload.
Going Everywhere You Want to Go
Europe is loaded with desirable destinations and discoveries. Narrowing
our coverage was tough, but a guidebook only contains so many pages,
and you only have so much time in your vacation schedule. Keeping that
in mind, we present the must-see destinations and the best of all possi-
ble side trips to give you a wide-ranging picture of all that Europe has to
offer.
The splendor of the British Isles
The best place to start is London (see Chapter 10), the history-drenched
capital of the United Kingdom. From the medieval Tower of London to
the neo-Gothic Houses of Parliament and the up-to-the-second Tate
Modern, London offers a wealth of sightseeing possibilities.
It vies with New York as the hotbed of English-language theater, and its
museums cover everything from Old Masters (National Gallery) and 
decorative arts (the Victoria & Albert Museum) to naval history
(Greenwich’s Maritime Museum) and contemporary art (Tate Modern).
The city contains the pomp and ceremony associated with the royal
family and the bump and grind of the trendiest neighborhoods and
nightclubs. You can dine on everything from pub grub to Indian fare to
modern British cuisine.

Easy day trips from London include the Georgian splendors and Roman
ruins of Bath, the mysterious prehistoric stone circle of Stonehenge, the
Gothic cathedral of Salisbury, and the busy streets and quiet quads of
Oxford, one of the world’s pre-eminent university towns.
Edinburgh (see Chapter 11), the capital of Scotland, is a dynamic inter-
national destination whose old city is presided over by an impressive
castle and whose Georgian New Town is a grid of genteel streets for
shopping and dining. You can haunt the pubs once frequented by local
son Robert Louis Stevenson, find out about Scottish Impressionism at
the National Gallery, visit the royal yacht Britannia, and stroll the Royal
Mile in search of tartan scarves and memorable attractions (from a
whisky tour to royal Holyrood Palace).
From bustling Edinburgh, you can make a day trip to Inverness and
search for the Loch Ness Monster from the ruins of Urquhart Castle, or
head down to happening Glasgow, an industrial city revitalizing itself as
a cultural center.
Although a visit to the Irish capital of Dublin (see Chapter 12) has its
charms, such as admiring the Book of Kells at Trinity College, exploring
Celtic history at the Archaeological Museum, following in the footsteps
of James Joyce and other Irish scribes, and pub-crawling through
Temple Bar, the best way to enjoy Ireland is to rent a car and drive
through the Irish countryside.
To that end, we offer plenty of coverage of the passage tomb at
Newgrange, the Celtic crosses and windswept heaths of the Wicklow
Mountains and Glendalough, and the fishing villages and ancient sites
of the Ring of Kerry and Dingle Peninsula.
The heart of the Continent
Many people consider chic, glamorous Paris (see Chapter 13) the capital
of European sightseeing. From viewing the masterpieces in the Louvre
and the Impressionists collection of the Musée d’Orsay to climbing the
Eiffel Tower, cruising the Seine, or simply whiling the day away at a cafe
in the St-Germain-de-Pres or Marais neighborhoods, Paris has enough to
keep you busy for a lifetime. In Parisian bistros and brasseries, you can
sample everything from the finest 5-star cuisine in town to cheaper
fixed-price menus.
But do take the time to day-trip from Paris to Versailles, one of the
“royalest” royal residences in Europe, or to Chartres, one of the world’s
great Gothic cathedrals, famed for its exquisite stained glass.
Amsterdam (see Chapter 14) is as famed for its canals lined by charming
17th-century town houses as it is for its social and cross-cultural toler-
ance, with examples ranging from the libidinous (the red-light district
and “smoking” cafes) to the heroic (the Dutch house where Anne Frank
and her family hid during the Nazi occupation). This unique Dutch city
Part I: Introducing Europe 
18

was home to artistic giants such as Rembrandt and van Gogh, whose
works are showcased in Amsterdam’s fabulous museums. Food-wise,
you can enjoy an Indonesian feast in the Leidseplein district, fresh her-
ring from an outdoor stall, and local beers and gin.
Nearby, you can sample a less hectic Dutch way of life in the smaller city
of Haarlem or tour tulip gardens, windmills, and re-created villages in
the countryside. You can also ride bikes for free in Hoge Veluwe
National Park, with its stunning Kröller-Müller Museum dedicated to
van Gogh and other modern-era artists.
The pulsing heart of life-loving Bavaria is Munich (see Chapter 15), a cul-
tural powerhouse packed with a bevy of fine museums and two out-
standing baroque palaces, and host to Oktoberfest, the biggest beer
party in the world. You can munch on bratwurst and pretzels in beer
halls and stroll the old center and expansive Englischer Garten city park,
or visit the Pinakothek art galleries to feast on masterpieces from
Germany and elsewhere throughout Europe.
Half the fun of Munich is traveling out of town to visit Neuschwanstein,
the ornate fairy-tale castle of Mad King Ludwig. The darker side of his-
tory is here, too. Just outside Munich, the town where the Nazi Party got
its start, you can tour the sobering concentration camp at Dachau.
Over the Alps in Austria (see Chapter 16), you can visit Vienna, a city
that was once capital of the giant Austro-Hungarian Empire and still
retains its refined architectural and artistic grandeur. Steep yourself in
this heritage by climbing the cathedral towers, sipping coffee at a
famous cafe, admiring the masterpieces of the Kunsthistoriches
Museum, or taking in a performance at the renowned Vienna State Opera
house — Vienna is, after all, one of the great music centers of Europe,
where Mozart, Johann Strauss, and other famous composers made their
careers. Another popular Austrian destination is Innsbruck, a lovely
little town tucked away in the heart of the Austrian Alps.
After a visit to the Swiss capital of Bern (see Chapter 17), where you can
admire hometown boy Paul Klee’s masterpieces, see where Einstein
came up with E=mc2, feed the town mascots at the Bear Pits, and float
down the river with the locals, you can delve into the heart of the Swiss
Alps, the Bernese Oberland region around the towering Jungfrau peak.
Here, small resort towns and Alpine villages cling to the sides of the
mighty Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald valleys, surrounded by glaciers
and ribbon-thin waterfalls, accessible by scenic railways, cable cars, and
miles of hiking and skiing trails.
Finally, take a foray into Eastern Europe to see how the medieval and
baroque city of Prague (see Chapter 18), once stifled behind the Iron
Curtain, has come roaring back to life and become one of Europe’s most
popular destinations. This dreamy city of church spires, castles, and
ancient streets is one of the world’s top centers for sampling beer and
Chapter 2: Deciding When and Where to Go 19

classical music. You find a plethora of concerts every night and in every
venue imaginable — from symphonies playing in grand halls to street
trios improvising under a medieval bridge abutment.
The charms of the Mediterranean
Rome (see Chapter 19), once the most powerful city in the Western
world, brims with famous sites, from the ancient Forum and Colosseum
to massive St. Peter’s Cathedral. Dozens of museums house everything
from ancient Roman statues, frescoes, and mosaics to Renaissance mas-
terpieces. One of the city’s greatest treasures is Michelangelo’s magnifi-
cent ceiling in the Sistine Chapel. The cityscape itself is a joy to wander,
a tangle of ancient streets and Renaissance-era boulevards punctuated
by public squares sporting baroque fountains (such as famed Trevi
Fountain), Renaissance sculpture, and Egyptian obelisks.
From Rome you can easily day trip to Tivoli, where the atmospheric
ruins of Hadrian’s villa and the famed gardens of the Villa d’Este provide
enchanting diversions, or take the subway to Ostia Antica, the ancient
port of Rome.
Florence (see Chapter 20), birthplace of the Renaissance, is loaded with
a lifetime’s worth of world-class museums and churches designed or
decorated by some of the greatest names in Italian art. Here you find
Michelangelo’s towering David, Botticelli’s sublime Birth of Venus,
Leonardo’s moving Annunciation, and other artistic icons. Florence is
also a great place to dine on succulent Tuscan fare, sample fine Italian
wines, and wander old neighborhoods known to Dante.
Florence is the capital of Tuscany, one of Europe’s most popular regions.
In this fabled and sublimely beautiful land, the tower of Pisa leans,
wineries turn ripe grapes into Brunellos and Chiantis, and hill towns
such as Siena and San Gimignano bring the Middle Ages to life with
their forbidding stone towers and finely decorated churches.
Venice (see Chapter 21) floats like a dream on its lagoon, with ornate
palaces and tiny footbridges spanning a network of canals. The only
modes of transportation here are boats and your own two legs. The inte-
rior of St. Mark’s Cathedral glitters with golden mosaics, and the works
of great Venetian artists, such as Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, adorn
the walls of the Accademia Gallery and Doge’s Palace.
After feasting on Venice’s seafood specialties, take the public ferry to
explore the outlying islands of Murano (where Venetian glass blowing
was invented), Burano (a colorful fishing village), and Torcello (an un-
developed island hiding another gorgeously mosaicked church). And
consider setting aside a day on the Veneto mainland to see the Giotto
frescoes in Padova (Padua).

The lively Spanish capital of Madrid (see Chapter 22) is renowned for its
museum collections, from the masterworks in the Museo Nacional del
Prado to Picasso’s Guernica in the Reina Sofia. Tour the Royal Palace,
take in a professional bullfight, or roam from bar to bar sampling tapas
before indulging in a hearty 10 p.m. dinner and resting up to catch a fla-
menco show or party in the clubs until dawn.
From Madrid, you can easily explore the medieval capital of Toledo, the
kingly monastery at El Escorial (both boasting many El Greco paintings),
and the impressive Roman aqueduct and Gothic cathedral of Segovia.
Barcelona (see Chapter 23), the sophisticated capital of Spain’s
Catalonia region, invites you to explore its picturesque Gothic quarter
(Barri Gòtic), ramble down Las Ramblas (one of Europe’s liveliest pedes-
trian promenades), hang out at the beach (along the city’s revitalized
waterfront), and take in the works of local early 20th-century greats
Picasso and Miró (each of whom has a museum dedicated to his work).
Barcelona is perhaps most famous for Gaudí, whose modernista architec-
ture is the stuff of singular town houses, a funky city park, and the only
great European cathedral still being built, his Sagrada Familía.
Last, but certainly not least, head off to the heart of the Mediterranean,
the ancient Greek capital of Athens (see Chapter 24), a sprawling
modern city with the ruins of the 2,500-year-old Parthenon looming over
it from atop the Acropolis Hill. Packed around the tavérnas and enticing
shops lie other enduring reminders of Greece’s Golden Age, such as the
Temple of the Olympian Zeus and the Temple of the Winds. The city’s
archaeological museums highlight not only remnants from the Classical
Age but also statues from the Cycladic era and earlier ages.
The possibilities for side trips from Athens are extraordinary. Visit the
romantic ruins of Delphi, where the ancient world’s premier oracles
advised kings and commoners alike. Or take off for the island of
Santoríni, a haven for sun-worshippers, with its beaches, white wine,
summer nightlife, and Minoan and Mycenaean ruins.
The Secret of the Seasons
Although it’s harder than ever to predict weather with any degree of
accuracy, Europe in general experiences few seasonal surprises. The
weather in Europe is roughly similar to that of the northeastern United
States. You may run into a warm, breezy day in December in Sicily, or a
cold snap in summer in Scotland, and you’ll probably hear reports of
unseasonably “weird weather” from England to the Czech Republic.
Europe tends to be slightly wetter than the United States in autumn,
winter, and spring, and drier in summer. Rain is a year-round occurrence
in England, and the peaks of the Alps never lose all their snow.
Chapter 2: Deciding When and Where to Go 21

Be prepared for all varieties of weather by packing clothes that you can
layer, long underwear, a folding pocket umbrella, and lightweight clothes
for warmer days.
Spring is great because . . .
 During this shoulder season (between low and high seasons), the
weather tends to be pleasantly mild, but unpredictable. Temperatures
may still be cool enough for skiing in the Alps but already warm
enough to sit outside at a sidewalk cafe in Paris or Rome. European
springs can be notoriously fickle, though; be prepared for rain, cold
spells, sudden heat waves, and/or perfect weather.
 Airlines usually offer more reasonable rates than in summer.
 Europe is neither too crowded nor too solitary.
 Tulips bloom in Holland and the great gardens of England and
throughout Europe are perking up.
But keep in mind . . .
 Shoulder season is becoming ever more popular (read: crowded) as
frequent travelers tire of the summer hordes and take advantage of
airlines’ reduced rates.
 The off-season often runs October to Easter, so in early spring,
some things may still be closed — from hotels and attractions to
rural tourism destinations such as vineyards or farms.
Summer is great because . . .
 All the services that cater to tourists open their welcoming arms —
this is the height of the tourist season, with the exception of ski
resorts. Early summer, especially June and July, is the most popular
time to visit Europe.
 Colorful folk festivals, open-air music, and theatrical performances
abound in summer.
 Attractions are made even more attractive by evening illumination
or sound-and-light shows and special performances.
But keep in mind . . .
 In summertime, Europe can feel like one giant bus tour. In fact, the
crowds are the season’s biggest drawback.
 The prices are the highest of the year — especially for airfares and
hotels.
 Popular museums and attractions have long lines. You may have to
wait for hours to get inside at peak times.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
22

 The temperatures really heat up across Europe in August, espe-
cially during the second half of the month, and air-conditioning is
not always available. Europeans go to the beaches, leaving the
sweating cities to the tourists.
 In southern Europe, the heat can be intense all summer long.
Fall is great because . . .
 The bulk of the tourists have left.
 Crops ripen, and wine and harvest festivals celebrate the season.
 As in spring, the fall shoulder season brings reasonable rates on
airlines and some hotel bargains.
 The opera and concert seasons for Europe’s best companies and
grand performance halls tend to begin in mid- to late fall.
But keep in mind . . .
 The weather can turn on you suddenly, with lots of drizzle, and the
occasional wintery cold snap.
 Some tourist facilities — hotels, restaurants, and a few sights —
close for the season in October and November.
 Tourism is increasing at this time of year as visitors try to escape
the crowds of summer.
Winter is great because . . .
 During low season (from mid- or late Nov through Easter, excluding
Christmas week), hotel and travel expenses drop and you often
have entire churches, museums, or even small towns to yourself.
 Christmas in Paris — or Rome or London or Munich or Madrid or
Venice — can be beautiful and an experience to remember.
 You haven’t really skied until you’ve been to the Swiss Alps and
gone downhill for more than an hour without ever having to wait
for a lift.
But keep in mind . . .
 You may not want to spend your vacation bundled up, shielding
yourself from the cold.
 Tourism destinations tend to freshen up during this period of calm.
Museums review and reorganize their exhibits; churches and monu-
ments undergo restorations or cleanings; and local transportation,
tourist offices, and shops shorten their hours, while some restau-
rants and hotels close for a week or even a month.
 Some of the most popular destinations, such as islands, smaller
tourism-based cities, and spas, close up almost entirely.
Chapter 2: Deciding When and Where to Go 23

Europe’s Calendar of Events
A great way to tour is to plan an entire vacation around a single large fes-
tival or seasonal celebration. You can witness a slice of European life
that most tourists never get to see. Celebrate the festival with the locals
and take tons of pictures, and you’ll return home with some unforget-
table memories.
Book your accommodations as soon as possible if your plans include
traveling to a location where a major festival or other cultural event is
taking place. Attendees snatch up accommodations quickly at festival
time, sometimes months in advance. For big festivals in smaller places,
such as the Palio in Siena, Italy, all the hotels within the town walls may
be sold out over a year in advance. If necessary, book a room in a neigh-
boring town.
What follows is a subjective list of the top festivals in Europe. Specific
country guidebooks, such as those published by Frommer’s (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.), list many, many more festivals. For exact dates or more
information, contact the local tourist offices (see the “Fast Facts” sec-
tions of Chapters 10 through 24 for listings) or visit the event Web site.
 Carnevale, Venice, Italy (and many other cities throughout
Europe): Carnevale is a feast of food and wine and a raucous cele-
bration of spring — a true pagan holdover grafted onto the week
preceding Christian Lent. Carnevale turns the world upside down:
Those of modest means hobnob with (or lampoon) the elite and
those in power, and everyone has a roaring good time. The most
famous celebration in Europe is Venice’s Carnevale, a series of ele-
gant-yet-tipsy masked balls harking back to the 18th century, but
you’ll find celebrations throughout Europe, including Munich and
Madrid. Carnevale starts a week or two before Ash Wednesday
(usually in late Feb) and culminates on the final Tuesday, called
“Fat Tuesday” (Mardi Gras in French). Fat Tuesday immediately pre-
cedes the sober period of Lent.
 Easter, throughout Europe: In London, you can see multicolored
floats parade around Battersea Park. In Florence, you can watch an
ox-drawn cart stuffed with fireworks explode in front of the cathe-
dral. In Rome, the Pope makes a special appearance on his balcony.
Celebrations vary widely between Good Friday and Easter Monday.
 Palio, Siena, Italy: One of the highlights of the Italian summer is this
breakneck, bareback, anything-goes horse race around the sloping,
dirt-covered main piazza of medieval Siena (www.paliosiena.com).
Even a horse that’s thrown its rider can take the prize, and whips
are used as much on competing riders as on the horses. The parties
held before and after the horse race are street feasts to behold, no
matter who wins. The horse race occurs twice each summer, July 2
and August 16.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
24

 Running of the Bulls, Pamplona, Spain: One of the more dangerous
festivals you can see is this one, where courageous fools dressed in
white, with red kerchiefs, run through the narrow streets of
Pamplona chased by enraged bulls (www.sanfermin.com). This
wild event ends when the bulls chase the last runners into the
harbor — after forcing most of them to jump the fences for safety.
After that, all involved drink wine, set off fireworks, and, of course,
attend the many bullfights. You can experience the Running of the
Bulls vicariously by reading Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises, or see
it yourself from July 6 to 14.
 Bastille Day, Paris, France: France celebrates its nation’s birthday
with street fairs, parades, feasts, and pageants, starting with a pro-
cession along the Champs-Elysées and ending with fireworks over
Montmartre. Bastille Day is July 14.
 Edinburgh International Festival and Fringe Festival, Edinburgh,
Scotland: One of Europe’s premier cultural extravaganzas, the 
festival features art, dance, films, plays, and music of some of 
the world’s top creative talents and performers. The traditional
bagpipes-and-kilt Military Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle is the festi-
val’s highlight. The Edinburgh International Festival (www.eif.
co.uk) takes place over three weeks in August. The Fringe Festival
(www.edfringe.com), also held in August, started off as a small,
experimental offshoot to the main festival, but it has exploded in
popularity and now hosts more than 1,500 shows and events.
Either way, August is a fantastic time to be in Edinburgh.
 Bloemencorso, Amsterdam, the Netherlands: This major flower fes-
tival takes place in a country obsessed with blooms. The event
begins with a colorful parade of floral floats in the nearby flower
market town of Aalsmeer and ends in Amsterdam on the Dam
Square. And get this — tulips are not included (it’s too late in the
season for them). The festival (www.bloemencorsoaalsmeer.nl)
takes place on the first Saturday in September.
 Oktoberfest, Munich, Germany: Wilkommen to the world’s biggest
keg party! This festival attracts tens of thousands of revelers who
listen to brass oompah bands, feast on roasted ox and sausages,
and sit under giant tents drinking liter-size mugs of beer.
Oktoberfest (www.oktoberfest.de) actually begins in mid-
September. The first weekend in October is the final flourish.
 Christmas, throughout Europe: You can enjoy the Christmas fun
and festivities anywhere in Europe from a few weeks before the hol-
iday until January 6 (the Epiphany). Squares and piazzas across the
Continent are set up with Christmas markets, where you can buy
handcrafted items and traditional holiday foods, and in some coun-
tries crèches (Nativity scenes) are displayed in public squares and
church chapels. Trafalgar Square in London is decorated with a
giant Norwegian spruce, and holiday concerts ring out in churches
and concert halls all over Europe. On Christmas Eve, you can go to
Oberndorf, north of Salzburg, Austria, to sing “Silent Night” in the
Chapter 2: Deciding When and Where to Go 25

town where the song was written. Or you can receive a blessing
from the pope at noon on Christmas Day, when he leans out his
window in Rome to give a Mass blessing, broadcast around the
world.
Tips for Successful Trip Planning
When planning your trip — both the whole trip and the daily 
schedule — make sure to leave room for downtime, changing plans, 
and spontaneity:
 Make time for relaxation. For every seven days of rigorous sight-
seeing, plan at least one day for doing little or nothing.
 Mentally prepare yourself for those inevitable changes in your
plans. You never know when circumstances will cause you to miss
a train, for example. Try to rethink your altered situation in order
to make the most of your revised circumstances.
 Be spontaneous. Take advantage of unexpected opportunities,
such as day trips or festivals, and don’t hesitate to spend more or
less time in a place after you get to know it.
Travelers who return to Europe for a second or third visit often plan
their itineraries in a way that allows them to enjoy a more leisurely pace
away from the crowds and pressures of the big cities. But on your first
visit, your goal may be to visit as many major cities and sights as possi-
ble, and the whirlwind tour is still the best way to do that. After you’ve
seen the “must-sees,” you can return as an experienced European trav-
eler to explore lesser-known attractions and other interesting areas in
greater depth.
Seeing it all without going nuts
The idea of planning a large-scale trip can seem overwhelming — so
much history and culture, so little time! Here are six ways to maximize
your time and still see as much as possible:
 Don’t duplicate types of sights. You know that many sights in
Europe are unique and worth seeing in their own right. But let’s
face it: Visiting every church in Rome or every museum in London
can be wearying or even boring. Pick one or two examples of each
and move on.
 Stay centrally located. On your first trip, use your limited time to
see as much of Europe as you can, instead of taking days to travel
to a peripheral corner. Consider skipping some of the more geo-
graphically remote countries, such as Norway, Sweden, Portugal,
Spain, and Greece, because — unless you take advantage of no-frills
airlines — traveling to them takes a long time. See Parts III through
V to help you choose destinations that keep this idea in mind.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
26

 Select side trips prudently. We highly recommend day trips
because they add variety to your city sightseeing. But pick your
excursions wisely, and make sure these trips don’t take time away
from the major city you’re visiting. If you’re in Florence for just one
day, don’t plan to visit Pisa as well, because you’ll end up seeing
neither. Unless you hook up with a time-specific escorted tour,
reserve a full day to see any destination that’s more than a city-bus
ride away.
 Go your separate ways. If you plan six days in London to accom-
modate the sightseeing wishes of each member of the family, you’re
wasting time unnecessarily. You don’t have to tour Europe as
Siamese triplets. Your partner can spend a few more hours in the
British Museum, your kids can ride the British Airways London
Eye, and you can check out Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. That way
you all spend a single afternoon doing what otherwise would have
taken a day and a half.
 Practice extreme time-saving techniques. No matter how pretty
the countryside, you can save a lot of precious vacation time by
taking night trains between major cities. That way, you won’t have
to use a whole day just getting from Point A to Point B. This may
not be the most comfortable way to spend the night, but because
you arrive at your destination so early, it’s a strategy that allows
you to visit a museum before the crowds arrive (you can always
take a siesta later).
 Keep in mind that you’ll probably come back. Assume it. Europe
still has a lot left to see, no matter how much you pack in. Europe
will wait for you.
Staying sane on the museum trail
For many travelers, Europe is synonymous with history and art, and you
may feel like you’ve seen it all by the time your vacation is over. These
hints can help you get the most out of your visits to the great museums
without overloading your brain:
 Plan to go to big museums twice. Spread the visit over two or
three days, if you have the time and inclination, because some
museums are just too big to get through in one day. Consider this
strategy for the Louvre, Prado, Vatican Museums, British Museum,
Uffizi, and National Gallery (London).
 Split up. Nothing is as subjective as taste in art. You and your com-
panions don’t have to stick together in museums and spend all
your time looking at the same paintings. You can each go through
at your own pace and peruse your own pleasures. This strategy
also gives you and your companions some time apart. (Even the
closest of friends and family can get on each other’s nerves.)
Chapter 2: Deciding When and Where to Go 27

 Take advantage of the audio tour. Audio tours in museums are
easy and fun and can add immeasurably to your enjoyment of a
work of art or a historic site. Nowadays, most audio tours are digi-
tal, and you go at your own pace. The exhibited works have num-
bers next to them, which you just punch into the wand’s keypad. It
then gives you the facts and background of the work, artist, era,
and so on. This way, you get the lowdown on the works that most
intrigue you.
 Do the guided-tour thing. Museum tours are led by experts who
explain the background and significance of the most important
works and can answer your questions. In huge museums, they
guide you directly to masterworks you’d otherwise have to find on
your own.
 Do your homework. The art and artifacts will be much more engag-
ing and interesting if you know something about what you’re look-
ing at. Whether you skim your guidebook for the information or
take a class in art history before your trip, a little brushing up on
European artists and movements will enrich any museum-going
experience.
 Keep the museum hours in mind. To avoid disappointment, it’s
always a good idea to verify a museum’s opening days and hours
before your visit. Many of the big museums stay open until 7 or 8
p.m. on one or two evenings a week, and in summer, some of them
stay open as late as 10 p.m. or even midnight. This is a great time to
visit because the galleries are less crowded, and you can visit
another must-see site during the day.
 Concentrate on the masterpieces. Even a moderate-size museum
can overwhelm you if you don’t pace yourself. Don’t feel obligated
to see every work on display. Many museums include a list of the
masterpieces on their floor plans, and you can skip entire wings of
less important works.
Dealing with cultural overload
While visiting Florence, the French writer Stendhal was so overwhelmed
by the aesthetic beauty of the Renaissance — and so exhausted by
trying to see absolutely everything — that he collapsed. Stendhal’s case
is an extreme one, perhaps, but he’s not the last one to break down from
too much Europe.
Even if you don’t faint in the piazza, after a few days or weeks of full-
steam-ahead sightseeing, you may feel unaccountably tired or irritable,
catch a cold, or just stop caring whether you see another church or
painting in your life. When the idea of visiting the Louvre makes you
groan and want to take a nap, it’s time to recharge your mental batteries.
Check out these hints for remedying traveler’s burnout:
Part I: Introducing Europe 
28

 Just because something is famous, don’t feel obligated to do or
see it. If you’re going to wear yourself out, do it on the stuff you
love. Skip what doesn’t interest you and limit yourself to those
attractions that you really want to see.
 Pace yourself. Don’t feel obligated to race around like a marathon
runner when you’re soaking up the variety of Europe’s cultural
offerings. Schedule rest periods. Leave room to picnic, to dip your
hands in a fountain, and to stop and smell the cappuccino. Don’t
pack too much into your overall trip itinerary or your daily sight-
seeing agenda.
 Put variety into your sightseeing. Visit a church, ruin, or museum,
and then relax in a cafe or in a park before hitting your next site.
Don’t visit one big museum after another. Give other areas of your
brain a workout so that your trip doesn’t blur into one large, color-
ful mirage of Gothic cathedrals and Old Masters.
 Do the siesta thing. In Mediterranean countries, many businesses
close in the early afternoon (the hottest part of the day), so why
not do as the locals do and take a nap? It can do you a world of
good, both physically and mentally. After you’re awake and
refreshed, you can return to your sightseeing.
 Take a break when the sightseeing starts getting to you. Whatever
it takes to bring your cultural appreciation back from the brink, do
it. Take a day to get off the beaten path. Go shopping. Go to a
soccer match. Above all, stop trying to rack up sightseeing points.
Sit down with a coffee or a glass of wine and write postcards. After
describing your unforgettable experiences to your friends back
home, chances are you’ll be psyched to get back on the sightseeing
trail.
How to Schedule Your Time
Table 2-1 gives you an idea of the minimum amount of time that’s needed
to “see” Europe’s major cities. This schedule allows time to settle in,
visit the major sights, get a taste for the place, and maybe go on one day
trip.

efore you start gathering information on specific destinations or
checking on airfares, you need to piece together a skeleton itiner-
ary for your trip to Europe. Choosing all the places you want to visit is
the easy part. Figuring out which of them you have time to see takes
some work. To ease the burden, we present five possible itineraries in
this chapter.
We’ve fit most of these tours into a one- or two-week timeframe, because
so many of us get just one or two precious weeks of vacation. We also
include a three-week whirlwind extravaganza in case you can carve out a
few extra days.
These itineraries assume two extra weekend “freebie” days. Many flights
to Europe from North America leave in the evening, so if you can get a
Europe-bound flight on Friday night, you have all day Saturday in Europe
as well. If you fly back home on the last Sunday of your trip, all of a
sudden, your “week” is nine days long. Traveling like this, you have to
disregard jet lag, which typically throws a wrench into the schedules of
transatlantic travelers after they arrive in Europe. Keep in mind that
opening hours vary from season to season. Because summer is the most
popular travel time, we’ve arranged these itineraries assuming summer
schedules. You may have to tweak them if you’re visiting in the off
season or if one of the days you happen to be in a particular European
town falls on a Sunday, a Monday, or another day when some sights may
be closed.

Occasionally, we include specific train times and schedules, but remem-
ber that this is just to get you thinking about how to schedule your time.
Rail and airline timetables can and will change regularly, so always
check the current schedules. (Chapter 6 shows you how to do just that.)
The Everything-but-the-Kitchen-Sink-
in-Two-Weeks Tour
If you’re determined to see as much as you can on your trip, here’s one
way to do it. But rest up first because you’ll be on the go nonstop and
won’t have time for jet lag.
Take an overnight plane that lands early in London (see Chapter 10).
Spend Days 1 through 4 as outlined in the itineraries we recommend in
Chapter 10, using the extra, fourth day to take in whichever side trip
most intrigues you: Oxford, Bath, or Stonehenge. This itinerary gets in
the greatest sights and experiences of London, from the National Gallery
and British Museum to the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey;
from shopping at Harrods to joining a London Walks tour and taking in a
Shakespeare play at the Globe.
On Day 5, take the earliest Eurostar train through the Channel Tunnel to
Paris (see Chapter 13). Get settled in your hotel, have lunch, and head
to the Musée Rodin. Then, suspend your sightseeing until the next day
and instead enjoy the late afternoon people-watching in a classic French
cafe followed by a sunset cruise on the Seine.
Spend Days 6 through 8 as outlined in Chapter 13 (the “If you have three
days” suggested itinerary), marveling at Notre-Dame and Sainte-
Chapelle, perusing the art treasures of the Louvre and Musée d’Orsay,
and climbing the Eiffel Tower.
Leave plenty of time to stroll through the chic Marais quarter, along the
banks of the Seine River, and around bohemian-turned-touristy (but still
fun) Montmartre. Plan a day at the extravagant Versailles, the palace to
end all palaces. Treat yourself to at least one first-class dinner to cele-
brate your arrival in one of the world capitals of cuisine.
On the morning of Day 8, get up early and head to the Gare de Lyon
train station to reserve a couchette for that night’s train to Venice, leav-
ing around 7 or 8 p.m. You can also store your bags at the station so that
you don’t have to lug them around during your final day in Paris.
Train stations make excellent way stations for your luggage when visit-
ing a city for a short time. Most train stations around Europe have lock-
ers or a luggage storage office where you can leave your heaviest bags
for around $10 a day.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
32

When you arrive in Venice (see Chapter 21) on Day 9, check out the next
morning’s schedule for trains to Florence and leave your bags in the
lockers; you can live out of your backpack or carryall for this one day.
Then dive (well, not literally) into the city of canals. Cruise the Grand
Canal on the vaporetto (public ferry) to one of Europe’s most beautiful
and historic squares, Piazza San Marco. Tour the glittering mosaic-filled
St. Mark’s cathedral and ride the elevator to the bell tower for sweeping
views across the city and its canals.
Tour the Palazzo Ducale (Doge’s Palace) for a behind-the-scenes look at
Venetian history and intrigue. Have a snack on your way to check into
your hotel in the early afternoon, and then visit the masterpieces of the
Accademia in the midafternoon. Take a gondola ride before dinner and
wander the quiet, romantic streets after your meal. Try to get to bed at a
reasonable hour because you’ll have to get up early.
On the morning of Day 10, head to the train station at least 90 minutes
before your train departs (this allows time for the slow public ferry to
get there). Retrieve your bags, take the first morning train you can to
Florence (see Chapter 20), and drop your bags at your hotel.
Have a lunch on the go so that you leave plenty of time to see the
Duomo (cathedral), climbing its ingenious and noble dome to get a city
panorama, and marveling at the mosaics inside the adjacent baptistery.
By 3 p.m., make your way to the world’s premier museum of the
Renaissance, the Uffizi Galleries (it’s best to reserve your admission
ticket beforehand). Have a Tuscan feast at Trattoria Garga before bed.
Be in line at the Accademia on Day 11 when it opens so that you can see
Michelangelo’s David before the crowds arrive. If you don’t linger too
long, you’ll have time to swing by the church of Santa Maria Novella
before lunch for a look at its Renaissance frescoes. (A young apprentice
named Michelangelo helped out on the Ghirlandaio fresco cycle.)
After lunch, while the city is shut down for the midday riposo (rest),
make your way over to the Giotto frescoes in Santa Croce church, the
final resting place of Michelangelo, Galileo, and Machiavelli. On your way
back to the heart of town, stop by Vivoli for their excellent gelato.
Cross the shop-lined medieval bridge called Ponte Vecchio to get to
Oltrarno, the artisan’s quarter, and the Medicis’ grand Pitti Palace,
where the painting galleries will keep you occupied until closing time at
7 p.m. Oltrarno is full of good, homey restaurants where you can kick
back, toast your 36 hours in Florence, and plan your return.
Get up extra early on Day 12 to catch the 7:30 a.m. train to Rome (see
Chapter 19), which pulls in around 9:15 a.m. Spend Days 12 through 14
as outlined in Chapter 20 in the “If you have three days” section. See the
glories of ancient Rome at the Forum, Colosseum, and Pantheon, and the
riches of the capital of Christendom at St. Peter’s.
Chapter 3: Presenting Five Great Itineraries 33

In addition to the superlative Vatican Museums, make time while in
Rome for two additional world-class museums: the Capitoline Museums
and the gorgeous Galleria Borghese (reserve your admission at the
Borghese before you leave home).
Spend Day 15, your last full day in Europe, at Tivoli, a nearby hill town
full of palaces, gardens, and the haunting ruins of Emperor Hadrian’s
villa. Return to Rome in time for dinner and then make your way to the
famous Trevi Fountain. It’s tradition to toss a coin into the water to
ensure that one day you’ll return to the Eternal City.
Most flights from Rome back to North America leave either in the morn-
ing or early afternoon. Either way, Day 16 is a wash; spend the morning
getting to the airport and the day in the air.
The Three-Week Grand Tour of Europe
Slightly less intense than the two-week tour outlined in the preceding
section, this itinerary allows a little leisure time to get out and enjoy the
countryside, with a few scenic drives and mountain hikes thrown in for
good measure.
Days 1 through 4 are the same as those in the preceding “Everything-
but-the-Kitchen-Sink-in-Two-Weeks” trip — you start in London (see
Chapter 10).
On the morning of Day 5, take an early flight to Amsterdam (see Chap-
ter 14). You can usually get a cheap fare with easyJet (www.easyjet.
com). After you settle in, spend Days 5 and 6 as described in Chapter 14
in the “If you have two days” section — relaxing with a canal cruise and
imagining life in all those narrow, gabled, 17th-century town houses.
Continue with that two-day itinerary, enjoying the masterpieces in the
Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum, a bike ride, an Indonesian feast
in the hopping Leidseplein neighborhood, and a sobering tour of the
Anne Frank House. Dine early on the evening of Day 6, because you need
to catch the overnight train to Munich, which leaves around 7:30 p.m.
First thing to do when you arrive in Munich (see Chapter 15) is pause at
the train station to book an overnight couchette to Venice for the next
evening. Spend Days 7 and 8 in Munich as in our recommended sug-
gested itineraries in Chapter 15. The overnight train to Venice leaves
very late (around 11:30 p.m.), so after dinner on the evening of Day 8,
bide your remaining time in Munich in true Bavarian style at the
Augustinerkeller beer hall, 5 long blocks from the train station.
When you get to Venice (see Chapter 21), check into your hotel, and
then head to the center of town. Spend Day 9 enjoying the three major
sights: St. Mark’s Cathedral, the Doge’s Palace, and the Accademia
Part I: Introducing Europe 
34

Gallery. Spend Day 10 visiting the outlying islands of the Venetian lagoon
with their glass- and lace-making traditions, fishing villages, and glitter-
ing church mosaics.
For Day 11, spend the morning in the museums, especially the Peggy
Guggenheim, and then the early afternoon simply wandering through
Venice’s enchanting back alleys. Be sure to leave yourself plenty of time
to hop on a late-afternoon train to Florence (see Chapter 20), arriving in
time to check into your hotel and find a late (around 10 p.m.) dinner.
For Days 12 through 14, visit Michelangelo’s David, the Uffizi Galleries,
the Pitti Palace museums, Fra’ Angelico’s frescoes in San Marco
monastery, the Medici Tombs, the cathedral and its dome, Bargello
sculpture gallery, and the shop-lined Ponte Vecchio spanning the Arno
River.
Starting with an early morning train to Rome (see Chapter 19), spend
Days 15 through 18 exactly as Days 12 through 15 in the preceding sec-
tion, with one addition: On the morning of Day 18, head to the train sta-
tion to check your bags and to book a couchette for the overnight train
to Paris before heading out to Tivoli for the day. Leave Tivoli by 4 p.m. at
the latest so that you’ll be back in Rome by 5 p.m. — enough time to
pick up some picnic supplies for dinner on the train. The Paris train
leaves around 7:30 p.m.
Spend Days 19 through 22 in Paris (see Chapter 13), following the
schedule for Days 5 through 8 under the two-week itinerary in the pre-
ceding section.
Most flights from Paris back to North America leave in the morning or
early afternoon, so spend the morning of Day 23 getting to the airport
and spend the day flying home.
Two Weeks in Europe for Lovers of Art
For this trip, you can work out the daily sightseeing schedules on your
own. Most of the cities in this suggested itinerary have two-and-a-half
days of sightseeing time budgeted, which gives you enough time to
check out the masterpieces in the major museums.
Head to London (see Chapter 10) for Days 1 through 3. Your first order
of business should definitely be the medieval, Renaissance, and baroque
masterpieces of the National Gallery. The other great art collection is
the Tate Gallery, now divided between two buildings, one on each side of
the Thames: The Tate Britain covers the British greats, and the Tate
Modern, a vast space in Southwark, concentrates on international art in
the 19th and 20th centuries (from Impressionism to contemporary
works), with stellar temporary exhibits.
Chapter 3: Presenting Five Great Itineraries 35

While at the National Gallery, you may also want to nip around the
corner to the National Portrait Gallery (same building, different
entrance). Although the collection exists more for the cultural impor-
tance of its subjects, some artistically fine portraits reside here as well
(especially by Holbein, Reynolds, and Warhol).
No museum buff should miss the British Museum, with its outstanding
antiquities collections (including the Parthenon sculptures), or the
Victoria & Albert Museum, which has London’s best sculpture collection
(including Donatello, Giambologna, and Bernini) in addition to miles of
decorative arts.
On the morning of Day 4, catch a Eurostar train to Paris (see Chapter
13). Spend Days 4 through 6 in the City of Light, exploring the treasures
of the Louvre over a full day. Fans of Impressionism and French art in
general should devote at least two-thirds of a day to the Musée d’Orsay.
Paris has so many smaller art museums that choosing from among them
can be difficult, and squeezing them all in during your visit can be nearly
impossible. Entire museums are devoted to single artists (such as Rodin
and Picasso), and others are devoted to eras (such as the incomparable
modern collection at Centre Pompidou). One of our favorite Paris art
treasures is Monet’s 360-degree Waterlilies in specially built basement
rooms of the Orangerie, off Place de la Concorde. At the end of Day 6,
hop on the overnight train to Florence.
Days 7 through 9 are for Florence (see Chapter 20). Reserve one entire
day for the Uffizi Galleries and its masterpieces of Renaissance art. The
Pitti Palace’s Galleria Palatina covers the High Renaissance and baroque
eras. Michelangelo’s David and his unfinished Slaves in the Accademia
are a must, while Donatello reigns supreme at the Bargello sculpture
museum. A veritable who’s who of Italian greats were responsible for 
the rich decorations in Florence’s churches, so visit as many of them as
you can.
Then you can see Brunelleschi’s magnificent architecture: the Duomo,
Santo Spirito, and the Pazzi chapel at Santa Croce. Florence is one place
where you’ll definitely run out of time long before you run out of art.
Days 10 through 12 find you in Rome (see Chapter 19). Take the morn-
ing train here from Florence on Day 10 and start exploring the baroque
period with Bernini’s giant sculptures adorning the fountains in Piazza
Navona and on display in the recently restored and utterly glorious
Galleria Borghese.
The Vatican Museums (home to the Raphael Rooms, the Pinacoteca
painting gallery, and Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel) require at least two-
thirds of a day. The Capitoline Museums split their collections between
ancient sculpture and mosaics and Renaissance and baroque painting.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
36

Rome’s churches are filled with art, from Filippino Lippi’s frescoes in
Santa Maria Sopra Minerva (where you also find Michelangelo’s Risen
Christ) to the Caravaggios in Santa Maria del Popolo and Michelangelo’s
Moses in San Pietro in Vincoli. Again, you’re unlikely to run out of art to
ogle in your three days here.
On the evening of Day 12, get on the overnight train for the long haul to
Barcelona. If you don’t like those overnight trains, wait for the 8:55 a.m.
train, although you’ll have to adjust the rest of your itinerary to accom-
modate the 51⁄2-hour trip. Volareweb.com (www.volareweb.com) sells
cheap, no-frills flights to Barcelona.
Spend Day 13 in the Catalonian capital of Barcelona (see Chapter 23).
You should definitely take in the intriguing early Picasso works at the
museum dedicated to this hometown hero and make a survey of Antoni
Gaudí’s sinuous and surprising architecture. At the end of the day, board
the overnight train to Madrid.
Plunge into the myriad museums of Madrid (see Chapter 22) on Days 14
and 15. Spain is the land of Picasso, Velázquez, Goya, El Greco (by adop-
tion), Murillo, and Ribera. You have a day to devote to the Museo del
Prado and another day to split between the Reina Sofía Museum (home
of Picasso’s Guernica), the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, and — if you
can stand any more art at this point — the Monasterio de las Descalzas
Reales.
Day 16 is your day to travel home.
A Week of Romance, European Style
Nothing kills a romantic mood faster than dashing hurriedly from place
to place, so we leave the daily scheduling for this tour up to you.
The mere mention of Paris (see Chapter 13) conjures up romantic
images, so it’s a great place to begin. Spend Days 1 through 3 enjoying
Paris’s famed museums — the Musée d’Orsay has both French
Romantic-era painters and loads of those lovable Impressionists.
But take time to enjoy the finer points of Parisian life. Linger at cafe
tables, spend an evening strolling Montmartre, have long meals at fine
restaurants and cozy bistros, explore Paris’s gorgeous parks, take a
dinner cruise along the Seine, and ascend the Eiffel Tower one evening
for a panorama of Paris, City of Light.
Indulge in the romance of yesteryear by spending a day at Versailles, the
palace to end all palaces. On the evening of Day 3, board the overnight
train or a late-evening flight on no-frills SmartWings (www.smartwings.
com) to Prague.
Chapter 3: Presenting Five Great Itineraries 37

Prague (see Chapter 18), your focus for Days 4 and 5, is a city of
baroque palaces, mighty fortresses, delicious beers, hidden gardens,
and classical street musicians who play a mean Dvorák. Spend an after-
noon delving into Prague’s rich Jewish heritage at its synagogues and
museums. Take a sunset stroll across the statue-lined Charles Bridge.
Spend a day (or at least a morning) exploring Prague Castle, both to
appreciate its soaring Gothic cathedral and to see how a fortress-city of
the Middle Ages looked and worked. Whatever else you do, try to fit in
as many of Prague’s delightful evening concerts as you can.
At the end of Day 5, hop an overnight train to Venice (see Chapter 21)
for Days 6 through 8. La Serenissima — “The Most Serene” city of
canals, palaces, Byzantine mosaics, and delicate blown glass — makes a
romantic out of everyone. This extraordinarily atmospheric and secre-
tive, sensual city has always been a haven for lovers, so we leave you to
your own devices in exploring.
Don’t pass up a ride in a traditional gondola (despite the outrageous
prices). Make sure you have a couple of long, drawn-out Italian feasts by
candlelight, a cruise down the majestic sweep of the Grand Canal, and
some moonlit strolls through the narrow, winding alleys and over the
countless canals.
To round out your romantic adventures in Venice, set aside one full day
to explore the smaller fishing, glass-blowing, and lace-making islands in
the Venetian lagoon.
You’ll most likely have to fly home from (or at least connect through)
Milan, so leave all of Day 9 free for the return trip. Allow at least 90 min-
utes from the time you leave your Venice hotel to get to the train station
(either to take the train to Milan in 21⁄2–31⁄2 hours, or to catch the shuttle
to the Venice airport in 20 minutes).
A Week in Europe That the Kids Will Love
When planning your family itinerary, leave plenty of time for the kids to
rest, and remember that most kids’ ability to appreciate even the finest
art and coolest palaces wears out quickly. You may want to spend five
hours in the Louvre, but the tykes will be lucky to last two. Take Europe
at their pace so that you can all get something out of it and have a fan-
tastic, rewarding, and (shh! don’t tell) educational time.
For this trip, fly into London and out of Rome. Your overnight plane
lands early on Day 1 in London (see Chapter 10). Check into your hotel,
and then head for the British Airways London Eye, a giant observation
wheel that offers a thrilling overview of the city. From there, head across
the Thames to see the Houses of Parliament with the giant Clock Tower
holding the bell called Big Ben. At nearby Westminster Abbey, you can
see the tombs of great poets, explorers, kings, and queens.
Part I: Introducing Europe 
38

After lunch, cross St. James’s Park to peer through the gates at
Buckingham Palace, the residence of the queen of England, before
making your way to the Tower of London, where the Yeoman Warders
(or Beefeater Guards) give some of the most entertaining tours in all of
Europe, turning a millennium of dry history into juicy tales of intrigue.
The Crown Jewels glitter as brightly as the armor and battle-axe blades
on display in the armory-and-torture-device museum.
Start off Day 2 with a cruise down the Thames to Greenwich, which still
retains a bit of its village ambience and is home to a bevy of exciting
sights. Start with a peek at the Cutty Sark, the most famous of the multi-
sailed clipper ships, now being restored after a big fire in 2007. Then
make your way to the National Maritime Museum, where you’ll see ship
models and find out about the famed Royal British Navy in the days when
the sun never set on the British Empire. At the nearby (within walking
distance) Old Royal Observatory, the kids can walk down the prime
meridian (the line that separates Earth’s two hemispheres), have fun
jumping from one to the other, and set their watches at the source from
which all the world’s clocks get their reading: Greenwich mean time.
Take a boat from Greenwich back to London and spend the late after-
noon relaxing. In the evening, get cultural. See a big splashy musical,
such as Phantom of the Opera, a cutting-edge play in the West End, or
Shakespeare performed in the Globe Theatre.
Reserve Day 3 for a day trip to Salisbury, with its towering Gothic cathe-
dral, and evocative Stonehenge, where imaginations can run wild specu-
lating on the mysteries of this evocative site.
From London, take the earliest Eurostar train through the Channel
Tunnel to Paris (see Chapter 13) on Day 4. Get settled in your hotel,
have lunch, and head to Notre-Dame, which you can make even more
interesting if you take the time to clamber up the North Tower so that
the kids can examine those famed gargoyles up close. On a sunny day,
even the most jaded of teenagers can’t help but be impressed by the del-
icate spectacle of light and color through Sainte-Chapelle’s stained-glass
windows.
Spend at least two hours in the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa and other
artistic treasures. From here, it’s off to the Eiffel Tower.
In the morning of Day 5, take your bags to the Gare de Lyon train station
and leave them in lockers so that you can catch that evening’s overnight
train to Rome (it leaves around 7:30 p.m.).
Then take the RER (light-rail train) out to Versailles, the biggest, most
impressive palace in all of Europe. Even all this lavishness gets pretty
boring pretty quickly for the kids, so just take a quick tour of the high-
lights. A less educational alternative to a day at Versailles is a day at
Disneyland Paris. Be back in Paris in plenty of time to shop for picnic
supplies for dinner on the train and be at the station by 7 p.m.
Chapter 3: Presenting Five Great Itineraries 39

Your train pulls into Rome (see Chapter 19) on Day 6 around 10 a.m.
Check into your hotel, splash some water on your faces, and head off to
the Markets of Trajan, where the kids can wander down an ancient
Roman street and explore the empty shops pigeonholing the remarkably
intact ruins of the world’s first multilevel shopping mall.
Truth be told, this section of the Imperial Fori is a bit more impressively
intact than the far more famous Roman Forum across the street, but
you’ll still want to wander through that seat of Roman Imperial power.
You can walk from the Roman Forum to the massive Colosseum, where
the kids can clamber around and imagine tournaments of wild beasts
and gladiator fights.
If you finish with the Forum and Colosseum by 2 p.m., you have enough
time to visit one or two catacombs along the Appian Way. The littlest
kids may be afraid, but most will get a thrill out of wandering miles of
spooky underground tunnels lined with the open-niche tombs of ancient
Christians. The best catacomb to visit is the Catacombe di San Domitilla.
On Day 7, head across the Tiber to St. Peter’s Basilica and the adjacent
Vatican Museums. The sheer size of St. Peter’s is inspiring to anyone,
especially if you tour the subcrypt of papal tombs and climb the dome.
Impress the kids by pointing out that Michelangelo carved his Pietà
sculpture when he was just 19 years old.
Then walk around the wall to the Vatican Museums, home to ancient
sculptures, the Raphael Rooms, and of course, the sublime Sistine
Chapel frescoed by Michelangelo.
From there, head over to the Spanish Steps in time for the passeggiata, a
see-and-be-seen stroll in the surrounding streets. And before you head to
bed for the night, stop by the Trevi Fountain (best after dark) so that
everyone can toss in a coin to ensure a return to the Eternal City.
Spend Day 8 on a day trip to Ostia Antica, ancient Rome’s port. It’s an
Imperial-era ghost town of crumbling temples, weed-filled shops,
mosaic-floored houses, dusty squares, cavernous baths, and paved
streets deeply rutted by cart wheels — on par with Pompeii, but without
the hordes of tourists and just a Metro ride away from downtown Rome.
Most flights from Rome leave in the early afternoon, so plan on spending
Day 9 just getting packed and to the airport two hours before your
flight.

ere we get down to the nitty-gritty of trip planning. In
the following chapters, you’ll ﬁnd indispensable infor-
mation on everything from managing your money and shop-
ping for plane tickets to choosing a tour operator and
reserving a hotel room. We point out special resources avail-
able for travelers with particular needs — including students,
seniors, families, and gays and lesbians — and make some
experience-based suggestions on what to pack, how to get a
passport, and how to take advantage of special rates for
rental cars and rail passes. In short, we provide you with the
practical advice and information you need to make your

T
his chapter addresses some essential money-related questions, such
as, “Can I afford a trip to Europe?” and “What are the real expenses
involved?”
If you’re wondering approximately how much you should realistically
budget for your trip, read on. In this chapter, you’ll also find hints, tips,
and secrets on how to trim your budget down to an amount you can
actually afford.
After you have your budget planned out, you need to know how to
handle your money when you get to Europe. As you travel, you have
many payment options, including ATM cards, credit cards, traveler’s
checks, and local currency. This chapter weighs the benefits and annoy-
ances of each method and shows you how to get the most out of your
money. We share a bit about currency exchange rates, which have been
drastically simplified with the advent of the euro, and explain the
European version of a sales tax. At the end of the chapter, you’ll find
some safety tips for securing your money and yourself.
Planning Your Budget
You can make two different trips to the same city for the same amount of
time and see all the same sights, but come out with a total bill that dif-
fers by thousands of dollars. This book shows you how to maintain the
quality of your trip while stretching your dollars along the way.

Traveling frugally means looking for simple, clean, and comfortable hotels
rather than those with minibars and spas; knowing when to splurge, when
to skimp, and how to spot rip-offs; buying rail passes and museum cards
instead of individual tickets; and enjoying meals in local bistros, cafes, and
trattorie (family-run restaurants) rather than expensive restaurants.
Before you delve into the specific tips on saving money, plan out a rough
trip budget. Your total cost depends greatly on your means and tastes. If
you look through the listings in the destination chapters of this book,
you can easily figure out what price level of hotel and restaurant appeals
to you. Just plug the average cost for these accommodations into your
expected daily expenses. As long as you round all dollar amounts up to
allow for some padding, you should get a basic idea of your costs. As
always, overestimating is wise. End your trip with some surprise leftover
cash rather than a disastrous shortfall.
In addition to the prices listed later in this book, here are some general
guidelines:
 Long-distance transportation: One of your biggest expenses will be
transportation. International airfares vary dramatically, depending
on the season and the carrier; the same is true of airfares within
Europe. But a host of no-frills airlines now makes air travel on the
Continent an inexpensive option (see Chapter 5 for ways to get the
best deal). Traveling through Europe by train, however, is a lot
more fun than flying, and money-saving rail passes are available to
help you travel between regions or countries for less money. To
save time and money, you may want to make your long trips at
night, upgrading to a couchette (see Chapter 6 for options and
prices). For short rail trips within Europe, it sometimes makes
sense to pay for individual tickets when you arrive.
 Local transportation: Once you’re in the city of your dreams, you
need to get around. In some places, you can do all your sightseeing
on foot. But in other, larger cities, you need to use some form of
public transportation: subway, tram, bus, or taxi (if you want to
splurge). Many cities offer inexpensive full-day transportation tick-
ets that bring costs way down. Budget at least $15 a day for your
local public transportation costs.
 Lodging: Hotel costs vary from country to country and depend on
your personal tastes. In general, budget hotels and low-end B&Bs
range in price from around $100 to $175 per double. If you’re willing
to stay in dormitory-like hostels, the rate drops to about $40 to $75
a night per person. For a first-class or luxury-grade hotel room,
expect to pay anywhere from $250 to $300 and up for double occu-
pancy. Keep in mind, though, that by shopping around, you can
often find special deals that bring hotel prices way down. You’ll
find money-saving tips in Chapter 7.
 Dining: Sampling an area’s local cuisine should play as large a role
in your vacation as sightseeing does, so allow a generous budget
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
44

for meals. For a simple lunch (not a sandwich at a takeaway shop),
plan to spend $25 to $35 on average (more in London). If you want
a big dinner every night, budget around $50 to $75 per person for a
moderately priced restaurant and $75 and up per person to dine at
a more upscale restaurant. Again, be aware that food prices will
vary from country to country (the most expensive meals will defi-
nitely be in London and Paris).
You probably don’t need to budget money for breakfast because
most hotels offer breakfast with a room. If not, buying a small
breakfast at a cafe costs about $10.
 Attractions/shopping: Museum hounds and sightseeing fanatics
should figure enough cash into their budgets to cover the costs of
admission. Don’t be chintzy here. Estimate an average of $20 per
sight ($25–$35 for biggies). Therefore, stopping at three major
sights per day adds up to roughly $60 to $100. Budget at least $10 a
day for postcards and other minor souvenirs, more if you’re a
chronic shopper.
All the big national museums in London are now free, and so are a
few other major sites throughout Europe, such as the Roman
Forum. Also, many cities sell museum passes that give you substan-
tial savings on cultural attractions. You’ll find more information
about these savings in the “Shaving off sightseeing and shopping
costs” section, later in this chapter.
Using the three-week grand tour from Chapter 3 as a sample (making one
change: instead of flying home from Paris, on the last day you take a no-
frills flight back to London and fly home from there), Table 4-1 presents
an estimated per-person budget for two adults traveling together. We’ve
averaged our prices on the “plus” side for this three-week trip (starting
with calculating for 22 days to allow for an extra travel day). Single trav-
elers booking a single room may be able to shave off a few dollars for
lodging.
Airline fares, as you probably know, can fluctuate dramatically, and the
value of the U.S. dollar against the European euro also affects prices. At
press time, the dollar was very low against the euro, meaning prices in
Europe were higher for American travelers.

As Table 4-1 indicates, you can finance a thrilling three-week trip, which
hits most of Europe’s must-see sights, for under $7,000 per person. 
Yes, it looks like a lot of money, but the experience of traveling in Europe
is priceless. If our rough average amount is too much, don’t give up
hope — the budget does have some leeway.
To trim more money from your budget, for example, you can cut out
$117 by sleeping in unreserved compartments on overnight trains (the
pull-out-seat kind) instead of couchettes. Buy a sandwich or a piece of
pizza for lunches (around $10 a person) and keep your dinner costs
down to $30 apiece, and your dining total shrinks from $1,650 to $880.
Reduce your miscellaneous expenses to $10 a day by making your
photos your postcards and skipping the souvenirs, and $550 is whittled
down to $220.
Factoring in these adjustments, the new grand total comes to around
$5,527 — still a great value for everything that you’re getting. You can
even manage a two-week trip to Europe for as little as $3,000, if you
travel smart, go during the off-season, and keep your budget in mind.
The next section presents some tips to help you do just that.
Keeping a Lid on Hidden Expenses
No matter how carefully you plan a budget, it seems like you always end
up shelling out for expenses that you didn’t expect. The following is a
list of common (yet completely avoidable) travel expenses, and ways to
keep them from putting a dent in your vacation fund:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
46

 Find out what your rental covers. When shopping for car rentals,
always make sure you know what the quoted rate includes — and
excludes. Some charges that the rental agent may or may not men-
tion to you include airport pickup/drop-off surcharge, drop-off fee for
renting in one city and dropping off in another, the collision damage
waiver (CDW), local taxes, mileage (is it limited or unlimited?), and a
tank of gas. See Chapter 6 for more information about renting a car.
 Ask whether taxes are included. In most of Europe, taxes are auto-
matically included in the hotel rates. In some countries, however,
hotels may quote you the prices before tax — usually the case in
Spain (7 percent), sometimes in England (17.5 percent), and occa-
sionally at expensive hotels in the Czech Republic (22 percent).
Always ask to be sure.
 Never place a phone call from a hotel room. On long-distance
calls, the markup is often 200 percent. Hotels may even charge for
what should be free calls to the local AT&T, MCI, or Sprint calling-
card number. Always use a pay phone or consider renting a cell-
phone if you plan to make many calls (see Chapter 9).
 Look before you tip. Many restaurants include a service charge in
your bill, so tipping another 15 percent is tossing your money out
the window. Always ask if service is included. If not, tip about 15
percent, just like at home. If service is included, and you felt that
your server did a good job, leave a bit extra on the table anyway
(one euro, for example, or in England, a pound coin).
 Watch out for high commission on exchange rates. Find out the
bank’s commission fee or percentage before exchanging traveler’s
checks, or you could end up leaking a little extra cash each time
you change money.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
The following list just gives you a taste of all the budget strategies that
exist. No doubt you’ll encounter more ways to stretch your travel dollar.
Planning ahead for discounts
Airfare to Europe can make you blow your budget before you even leave
home, but fear not — there are plenty of ways to save:
 Go off-season. If you can travel at non-peak times (Oct–May for
most major cities and tourist centers), you’ll find hotel rates up to
30 percent below the prices of peak months.
 Travel midweek. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to your destination. When
you ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying
on a different day. (For more tips on getting a good fare, see
Chapter 5.)
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent, airline, or packager, for a price
much less than if you put the trip together yourself. The savings
can be amazing. (See Chapter 5 for more about package tours.)
 Always ask for discount rates. You may be pleasantly surprised to
discover that you’re eligible for discounts on sights, transportation,
hotels, you name it. Members of automobile clubs, such as AAA
and CAA, trade unions, or AARP; frequent fliers; teachers; students;
families; and members of other groups sometimes get discounted
rates on car rentals, plane tickets, and some chain-hotel rooms. Ask
your company whether employees can use the corporate travel
agent and corporate rates even for private vacations. You never
know until you ask.
If your family emigrated from Europe, you may get another dis-
count. Many ethnic travel agencies (usually found in major cities)
specialize in getting forgotten sons and daughters rock-bottom
rates when returning to the old country. It’s worth looking into if
you can find one near you.
Trimming transportation expenses
Getting to Europe uses up most of your transportation budget, but just
getting from place to place can add up too. Here are a few ways to make
the most of your remaining transportation dollars:
 Reserve your rental car before you leave. If you know you want to
have a car for some or all of your trip, rent it through a major U.S.
company before you leave, saving big bucks over the cost of rent-
ing on the spot in Europe (see Chapter 6 for details).
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need lots
of space, don’t go beyond the economy size. For more about car
rentals, see Chapter 6.
 Invest in a rail pass. Europe’s extensive train system constitutes its
greatest transportation asset. The train system’s best value is its
family of Eurail passes (see Chapter 6).
 Buy a single- or multi-day transportation pass for local trans-
portation needs. Most big cities offer specially priced day or multi-
day tickets for their public transportation systems. These passes
provide enormous savings over individual ticket prices and free
you up from the need to always have the correct fare.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save lots of money in
taxis and other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know
your destination more intimately because you explore at a slower
pace.

Lowering your lodging bill
Hotel costs in Europe can be sky-high, especially in big cities. If you
don’t relish the thought of paying big bucks for a swank room that you
won’t be spending much time in anyway, try some of the following tips:
 Catch 20 winks on an overnight train for $39 (or maybe even
free!). Armed with your trusty rail pass, you can jump on an
overnight train and fork over just $39 for a reserved bunk in a
sleeping couchette. Or if you’re feeling lucky, take your chances on
finding an empty sitting compartment, slide down the seat back,
and — voilà! — you have a bed for free. In the morning, you’ll have
reached your destination and saved yourself a night’s hotel charge.
 Leave the private plumbing at home; take a room without a bath-
room. You can get a hotel room that shares a bathroom down the
hall for about two-thirds as much as you pay for a virtually identi-
cal room with its own plumbing.
 Get a triple or cots, not two rooms, if you have kids. At most
European hotels, kids stay for free in a parent’s room. At the worst,
a hotel may charge a small fee ($15–$25) for the extra bed.
 Rent a room instead of staying at a hotel. At $40 to $80 a night, pri-
vate rooms for rent beat out even the cheapest B&Bs or pensions.
You also get the experience of staying in a European home, which
no five-star hotel can give you for any price (see Chapter 7).
 Give the ultracheap accommodations a try. If sleeping near 150
roommates (mostly students) on a wooden floor under a big tent
sounds appealing, you can spend a night in Munich for $15. Budget
options abound in Europe, from hostels (beds from $40–$52) to
convents ($40–$75) to extreme options such as Munich’s aforemen-
tioned mega tent. See Chapter 7 for more details.
 Opt for a double bed instead of two singles. Fewer sheets for the
hotel to wash equals savings for you. Though this twin-versus-
double option is disappearing in many places, it still holds true in
some countries.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive,
tram trip, or bus ride away. Hotels outside the historic center, in
the next town over, or otherwise less conveniently located are
great bargains.
 Never allow the hotel to handle your laundry. Unless you enjoy
being taken to the cleaners, you can wash a few pieces of clothes in
the sink each night, roll them in towels to sop up the dampness,
and hang them on the radiator to dry — or even better, on the
heated towel racks (an amenity even cheap places are installing).
Or look for a laundry shop that washes and dries clothes based on
weight (an average load costs $15). Most European cities have
them; start looking near the local university.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49

 Rent a room that doesn’t include breakfast. Often hotels charge
an extra $15 to $20 a night when breakfast is included. You can
sometimes get the same food for about $10 at a nearby cafe.
Digging for dining bargains
Don’t worry, you won’t have to go hungry or even eat bad food to keep
dining costs to a minimum. You can find plenty of ways to eat well in
Europe without breaking the bank:
 Stuff yourself if your hotel room rate includes breakfast. Don’t be
shy about loading up on the food that comes with your room.
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchenette. Doing your own cooking
and dishes may not be your idea of a vacation, but you can save
money by not eating in restaurants three times a day. Even if you
only make breakfast or cook the occasional dinner, you’ll save in
the long run.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch
menus often offer many of the same dishes, but at a fraction of the
dinnertime cost.
 Lunch on pub grub in Britain and Ireland. An authentic, yet
cheap, meal in a British pub includes a sandwich and a sturdy pint
of ale. If you don’t want to go to a pub, you can easily find great
sandwich bars and cheaper fast-food specialties throughout Britain
and Ireland and in every country in Europe.
 Order from fixed-price and tourist menus. Fixed-price meals can
be up to 30 percent cheaper than ordering the same dishes a la
carte. Although the options on a fixed-price menu are limited, you
can’t beat the price.
 Picnic often. For about $15, you can buy food in a supermarket and
dine like a king wherever you want — on a grassy patch in the city
park, in your hotel room, or on the train.
Shaving off sightseeing and shopping costs
Some of the best sights in Europe are absolutely free, and you can often
find ways to get a discounted rate on the rest:
 Purchase a Paris Museum Pass. The Paris Museum Pass gives you
unlimited entry for four full days to virtually all Parisian museums
and sights (the Eiffel Tower is the only major one not on the list) for
only 45 ($72). You can find similar passes in other cities that also
include free travel on city buses and subways and other benefits.
 Visit the free or near-free sights. You can, for example, witness 
firsthand Paris cafe culture for the price of a cup of coffee (around
3.50/$5.60) or cruise the Grand Canal in Venice for 6.50 ($10) on
the public vaporetto (water ferry). Other free sights and experiences
include London’s British Museum, Tate Gallery, and National Gallery;
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
50

Rome’s Pantheon, Forum, and lively piazzas; and throughout Europe,
most churches and cathedrals, church services where choirs sing,
medieval quarters, sidewalk performers, baroque fountains, city
parks, and street markets.
 Take advantage of free or reduced-price museum days. See the
Vatican for free on the last Sunday of every month. You can
uncover such policies at many other museums as well. The Louvre,
for example, waives admission on the first Sunday of the month
and is also almost half-price after 3 p.m. Check the museum’s Web
site for information about free days and hours of reduced admis-
sion, but remember that other people have the same idea — the
museums will be most crowded during these free times.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and memories serve as the
best mementos of your trip. Ten years down the road, you won’t
care about the T-shirts, key chains, Bier steins, and the like.
 Use ATMs instead of traveler’s checks. If you’re using traveler’s
checks, trade them only at a bank for local currency or you’ll get a
bad exchange rate. Also, exchange booths at major tourist attrac-
tions give the most miserable rates. Nowadays it makes more
sense, and costs less, to withdraw money from European ATMs
using your bank card. (See the following section for more informa-
tion about traveler’s checks and ATMs.)
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless you
happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using your ATM card
Nowadays you can saunter up to an ATM in virtually any city or small
town in Europe and retrieve local cash, just as you would back home.
Using the ATM is the fastest, easiest, and least expensive way to
exchange money. When you use an ATM, you take advantage of the
bank’s bulk exchange rate (better than any rate you would get changing,
say, traveler’s checks at a bank), and the fees your home bank may
charge you for using a nonproprietary ATM are usually less than a com-
mission charge on a traveler’s check would be.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51

Both the Cirrus/Maestro (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) and
PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks offer automated ATM
locators that list the banks in each country that will accept your card.
Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, and
then call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. Or, as an
alternative, you can search for any machine that carries your network’s
symbol. In Europe, nearly every bank ATM is on both systems.
Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) before you
leave home, and find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart.
Also, keep in mind that many home banks impose a fee every time you
use your card at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for
international transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones
(where they’re rarely more than $2).
Increased internationalism has essentially eliminated the worry that
your card’s PIN needs special treatment to work abroad, but you should
still check with the issuing bank before you leave. Most European sys-
tems use four-digit PINs; six-digit ones sometimes won’t work.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Visa and MasterCard are almost universally accepted at European
hotels, restaurants, and shops. The majority of these places also take
American Express, although its high commissions and unhurried reim-
bursement process are leading more and more small businesses to deny
acceptance. The Diners Club card has always been more widely
accepted in the cities and at more expensive European establishments
than in smaller towns and budget joints, but its partnership with
MasterCard means that the card may soon be welcomed at establish-
ments that take MasterCard.
Except in the most exclusive restaurants and hotels, most Europeans
have never heard of Carte Blanche. You rarely find a place that accepts
Discover, and gas station and department-store credit cards are worth-
less overseas. Leave all those at home. Likewise, when visiting smaller,
cheaper, family-run businesses, such as some inexpensive hotels and
restaurants, most rental rooms, and some neighborhood shops, you 
may find that all your plastic is useless, even Visa. Therefore, never 
rely solely on credit cards.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
52

When you use your credit cards overseas, you pay the premium interest
rate (usually around 19 percent) on cash advances, not the low introduc-
tory rate that many credit cards offer. Likewise, with most cards, you
start to accrue interest immediately when you make a cash advance
(rather than at the end of the month and only if you don’t pay up, as
with purchases). If you use American Express, you can usually only
obtain a cash advance from an American Express office.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card for purchases abroad,
most banks assess an additional 2 percent to 3 percent fee on top of the
1 percent fee charged by Visa, MasterCard, or American Express for cur-
rency conversion on credit charges. It’s a sneaky way to add fees that
are basically unwarranted. But because traveler’s check exchange rates
and service fees add up to about 6 percent per transaction, using credit
cards may still be a better option for on-the-spot purchases.
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused (a good reason to carry the phone number with you). But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card on
your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so having a
backup is the smart way to go.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 53
Chip and PIN: Credit cards European-style
Over the past few years, several European countries have moved away from the mag-
netic-stripe credit cards Americans use to a new system called “chip and PIN.” As a
result, some American travelers have had trouble using their credit cards, particularly
in England and France. Although businesses that show the Visa or MasterCard logo
all have the equipment to take U.S.-style swipe cards, some retailers believe that they
can’t take swipe cards that don’t have PINs. In France, many self-service vendors,
including gas stations and automatic ticket kiosks throughout the entire national rail
network, will only operate with chip-and-PIN cards. So what should you do?
 Get a four-digit PIN number from your credit cards’ issuing banks before leaving
the U.S. Call the number on the back of each card and ask for one. Get the PIN for
your credit cards (this isn’t for your ATM card).
 Keep an eye out for the right logos. You want Visa and MasterCard, not Maestro,
Visa Electron, or Carte Bleue.
 Consider Amex. American Express is accepted at fewer locations than Visa or
MasterCard, but an Amex card will always work where the Amex logo is displayed.
 Make sure you have enough cash. As a last resort, you should be able to cover
your purchases with cash.

Cashing traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most towns
and cities in Europe have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash
as needed. However, keep in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM
withdrawal fee if the bank is not your own, so if you’re withdrawing
money every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks. Traveler’s
checks have a built-in safety factor, too: If you lose your traveler’s checks,
you haven’t lost your money.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in the event that they’re
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. They’re offered in denomi-
nations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1,000. Generally, you’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. The most pop-
ular traveler’s checks are offered by American Express (% 800-807-
6233 or 800-221-7282 for card holders — the latter number accepts col-
lect calls, offers service in several foreign languages, and exempts Amex
gold and platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee); Visa (% 800-732-
1322); and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
American Express, Thomas Cook, Visa, and MasterCard offer foreign
currency traveler’s checks, useful if you’re traveling to one country or
to the euro zone; they’re accepted at locations where dollar checks may
not be.
Take your traveler’s checks (along with your passport for identification)
to any bank or exchange booth in Europe, and they’ll change the checks
for the equivalent amount of local currency, minus exchange-rate fees.
(You can find more about shopping for exchange rates in the following
section.) Keep in mind that without a passport or appropriate bank iden-
tification, you won’t be able to cash them.
Paying for a hotel room, shop purchase, or meal directly with a trav-
eler’s check drawn on U.S. or nonlocal currency virtually ensures that
you get the worst possible exchange rate. Exchange your traveler’s
checks for local cash at a bank or the American Express office.
Exchanging Money at the Best Rate
Make sure that you do some research before you change your cash, or
you risk getting ripped off. Exchange rates are the best and easiest way
small-time financiers can take advantage of inattentive tourists.
Shop around for the best exchange rate. If you do, you often notice that
exchange rates at banks right next door to each other can differ by 40
percent. The business section of major newspapers (and Europe’s main
English-language paper, the International Herald Tribune) lists the current
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
54

rates for European currencies. The figures published are prime rates, so
although you won’t find a street price that’s as attractive, they’re good
guides to follow when shopping for rates.
In the “Fast Facts” section of each destination chapter in this book, we
give you the exchange rate for that country. Although currency conver-
sions in this guide are accurate as of this writing, European exchange
rates fluctuate constantly. For up-to-date rates, look in the business
pages or travel section of any major newspaper, and check online at the
Oanda Currency Converter (www.oanda.com).
Most banks and currency-exchange services display a chart of the cur-
rent exchange rates that they offer, often in an outside window or inside
at the international teller’s window. Make sure that you look at the rate
the bank buys, not sells, the currency that you need to exchange. When
you compare the rates at different banks, look for the chart with the
highest number in the buying-dollars column to find the best rate.
Remember to factor in the commission, if any, when comparing rates.
The commission can be a flat fee that equals a few dollars or a percent-
age (usually 2 percent to 6 percent) of the amount you exchange. (Banks
display commission costs in the fine print at the bottom of the daily rate
chart.) Occasionally, a slightly less attractive exchange rate coupled
with a low or flat-fee commission can cost you less in the long run
(depending on how much you exchange) than a great-looking rate with a
whopping commission.
You can also exchange money at commercial exchange booths (multilin-
gually labeled as change/cambio/wechsel). The rates here are generally
lousy and the commissions high, but they do keep longer hours than
banks. Only use commercial exchange booths as a last resort if banks
are closed and you can’t access an ATM. Hotels and shops also offer 
terrible rates.
Buying Currency before You Leave
Though the age of ATMs makes this less necessary, some people still
purchase about $50 worth of local currency for each country that they’ll
visit even before they leave home. Doing so gets you from the airport or
train station to the better exchange rates of a downtown bank. Likewise,
this money can tide you over until you get your hands on some more, if
you arrive in town late at night or on a bank holiday.
AAA offices in the United States sell ready-to-go packs of several curren-
cies at relatively reasonable rates, although you can get better ones at
any bank (call ahead — usually only banks’ main downtown branches
carry foreign cash). Shop around for the best rate, and ask the teller to
give you small bills (close to $10 denominations) because you need the
cash primarily to buy inexpensive items like maps, bus tickets, and
maybe food.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 55

Paying and Redeeming the VAT
Most purchases that you make in Europe have a built-in value-added tax
(VAT) of approximately 17 percent to 33 percent, depending on the coun-
try. Theoretically, most European Union (EU) countries are supposed to
adopt the same VAT tax across the board (especially the euro countries
because, technically, they share a single economic system), but that’s a
convention still being worked out.
The VAT tax is the European version of a state sales tax, only it’s already
embedded in the price instead of tacked on at the register. The price tag
on merchandise is the price you pay.
If non-European Union citizens spend more than a certain amount at any
one store, they’re entitled to some or all of the VAT via refund. This amount
ranges from as low as £50 ($100) in England to 182 ($291) in France; the
minimum purchase amount varies from store to store. You can also avoid
the VAT if you have your purchases shipped directly from the store, but
the high cost of shipping generally offsets any savings on the taxes.
To receive a VAT refund, request a VAT-refund invoice from the cashier
when you make your purchases, and take this invoice to the Customs
office at the airport of the last EU country that you visit. Have all your
VAT-refund invoices stamped before you leave Europe. After you’ve
returned home, and within 90 days of your purchase, mail all your
stamped invoices back to the stores, and they’ll send you a refund
check. This process usually takes from few weeks to a few months.
Many shops now participate in the Tax Free for Tourists network (look
for a sticker in the store window). Shops in this network issue a check
along with your invoice. After Customs stamps the invoice, you can
redeem it for cash directly at the Tax Free booth in the airport (usually
near Customs or the duty-free shop), or you can mail it back to the store
in the envelope provided within 60 days for your refund.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
56
One big merger: The euro
In 2002, most Western European nations finally did away with their francs, marks,
pesetas, and lire and finalized the adoption of a single European currency called the
euro (). As of this writing, 1 equals about $1.60, and conversions in this guide were
calculated at this exchange rate.
Countries in this guide that use the euro include Austria, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain. The United Kingdom (which includes
Scotland) and Switzerland have not adopted the euro, and the Czech Republic, which
joined the European Union (EU) in May 2004, has yet to jump the appropriate economic
hurdles to be able to join the more exclusive club of the single-currency zone.

Avoiding Theft
Random, violent crime rates are still much lower in Europe than in the
United States. On the whole, Europe’s big cities are safer than U.S. cities.
The two biggest things you need to worry about are pickpockets and the
crazy traffic.
Stay safe by sticking to populated streets after dark, and know the loca-
tions of bad neighborhoods. Each destination chapter in this book
includes discussions of neighborhoods, as well as sections on safety
(under “Fast Facts”), which list the less savory parts of town.
If your wallet is missing and you didn’t leave it in a restaurant or hotel,
chances are that it’s gone for good. If you heed the advice in Chapter 9
and keep all your important stuff in a money belt, all you’ve lost is a
day’s spending money (and a wallet).
Make two copies each of your itinerary, your plane tickets, and your
vital information, including the information page of your passport, your
driver’s license, and your student or teacher’s identity card. Also,
include your traveler’s check numbers, your credit card numbers (write
the numbers backward to “code” them), and the phone numbers listed
later in this chapter for the issuers of your bank cards, credit cards, and
traveler’s checks. (If you lose any of these items on the road, call those
numbers collect to report your loss immediately.) Leave one copy of
each of these items with a friend at home and carry the second copy
with you in a safe place (separate from the originals) while you travel.
Hazard #1: The pickpocket
Pickpockets target tourists, especially Americans. Pickpockets know
that American tourists often carry lots of money and expensive cameras.
Make sure you’re especially careful in crowded areas (buses, subways,
train stations, and street markets) as well as most touristy areas (the
Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum, and so on).
Don’t tempt thieves. Leave your jewelry at home and don’t flaunt your
wallet or valuables. Follow these tips to theft-proof yourself:
 Keep all valuables (plane tickets, rail passes, traveler’s checks,
passport, credit cards, driver’s license, and so on) in a money
belt and wear it at all times. Keep only a day’s spending money in
your wallet (see Chapter 9 for more about this).
 Carry your wallet in a secure place, such as a back pocket that
buttons or in the front pocket of your jeans. When riding buses,
casually keep one hand in your pocket with your wallet.
 Don’t hang your purse strap off one shoulder where a thief can
easily grab it. Instead, hang your purse across your chest. If your
purse has a flap, keep the flap and latch side against your body, not
facing out where nimble fingers have easy access. When on the
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 57

sidewalk, walk close to the wall instead of the curb, and keep your
purse toward the wall. Also, beware of thieves who zip up on their
scooters and snatch away purses.
 Don’t hang your purse or travel bag on the back of your chair in
an outdoor cafe. You may be so engrossed in people-watching that
you don’t see a fast-moving thief who’s ready to snatch your bag
and disappear into a crowd.
 Don’t leave your camera around your neck when you aren’t
using it. Instead, stow your camera in a plain bag. (A camera bag
announces, “Steal my camera” to thieves.)
 Travel in a trench coat (good for warmth, rain, a makeshift blan-
ket, and fitting into European crowds). You can fit all your valu-
ables inside your coat or pants pockets, and with the trench coat
wrapped around you, you can feel pickpocket-proof.
Hazard #2: The scam artist
Each con artist uses his own specific tactics to rip you off. Here are
some of the most common swindles:
 In countries that count pocket change in increments of hundreds
(not so much of a concern since the introduction of the euro),
watch out for dishonest types who confuse new arrivals with all
those zeros. For example, some people will give you change for
1,000,000 Turkish lire when you paid with a 10,000,000 bill, unless
you catch them. Until you’re used to the money system, examine
each bill carefully before you hand it over and make sure you show
the receiver that you know what you’re doing.
 Waiters sometimes add unordered items to your tab, double the
tax (allocating 15 percent for the state and 15 percent for the
waiter), or simply shortchange you.
 A stranger may offer to help you exchange money, befriend you,
and walk off with your wallet after hugging you goodbye. Decline
any stranger’s offer for assistance and continue on your way.
 Hotels may sneak in minibar, phone, or other charges. So, if your
bill is any higher than the rate (plus tax) you agreed upon multi-
plied by the number of nights you stayed, ask a manager to explain
your bill.
 Hotels charge obscenely high telephone rates, with markups any-
where from 150 to 400 percent — especially on long-distance
calls, and it’s perfectly legal. In fact, hotels often charge you for
the free local call to your calling-card company! Do your wallet a
favor and pretend that the hotel phone doesn’t exist. Use pay
phones or the post office instead.
 If your escort on a guided bus tour recommends a shop for
buying local crafts or souvenirs, she may be getting a kickback
from that store. In return, the store charges heavily inflated prices
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
58

for items. (In defense of tour guides, however, this kickback system
is one of the only ways they can make a living, because they’re
notoriously underpaid — in part because companies unofficially
expect them to take advantage of this option as an unlisted perk.)
Keeping valuables safe on trains
Here are some tips for keeping your stuff safe and secure on an
overnight train:
 Don’t flaunt your valuables.
 Lock your door and make sure that everyone in the couchette
understands the importance of keeping your door locked.
Conductors usually emphasize this point, but doing it yourself
doesn’t hurt either.
 Reserve the top bunk. Although the top bunk is hotter, it puts your
goods above the easy reach of most thieves, and you can sleep
with your head next to your bags.
 Stow your bags in the luggage niche above the door. If you strap
or lock your bags to this railing, a thief can’t easily tug them down
and run off with them.
 Turn your valuables into a pillow. You may not experience the
most comfortable sleep, but if you wrap your valuables in your
clothes and put it in a sack, the discomfort is worth the reward.
 Take special precautions when sleeping in unreserved sitting
couchettes.
Coping with a stolen wallet
If you lose your wallet, don’t panic. If you follow the tips earlier in this sec-
tion, you won’t have more than a day’s spending money in your wallet.
If you lose your traveler’s checks and you remembered the all-important
rule of writing down the check numbers and keeping them in a separate
and safe place, you can easily replace them in any big European city.
Just call the issuer of your checks for details (see “Cashing traveler’s
checks,” earlier in this chapter, for telephone numbers).
If you lose credit cards or ATM cards, you’ll need to cancel them imme-
diately. Before you leave on your trip, create a list of the international
customer-service numbers given on the back of each card. Keep the list
in a safe spot (not with your cards). Note that these are special U.S.
numbers set up explicitly for emergencies abroad. Go to any pay phone
in Europe and dial an international operator to connect your collect call.
Your credit card company or insurer may require a police-report number
or record of the loss. Check with your credit card company before you
leave home to get the phone number to call (usually a collect call) to
report a lost or stolen card.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 59

Your credit card or ATM card issuer may be able to wire you a cash
advance or issue an emergency replacement card in a day or two. In situ-
ations such as these, carrying traveler’s checks, which are easily
replaced, can save your entire vacation.
An alternative to getting quick cash in an emergency is to have a friend
wire you money. Reliable, international services include Western Union
(% 800-CALL-CASH [800-225-5227]; www.westernunion.com) and
American Express’s MoneyGram (% 800-666-3947; www.moneygram.
com), which allow someone back home to wire you money in an emer-
gency in less than ten minutes.
When traveling abroad, you’re a non-entity without your passport. If you
lose your passport, go immediately to the nearest U.S. consulate. Make
sure that you bring a photocopy of your passport’s information pages
(the two pages facing each other with your picture and vital informa-
tion), passport-size photos (bring some with you), and any other form of
identification that wasn’t lost.
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your credit
cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately; placing a
fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability for criminal
activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are Equifax

Beware of thieves young and old
As you make your way around Europe, be aware that you may encounter masterful
thieves and pickpockets (although you won’t realize it until you reach for your wallet
and find it missing). Often, these thieves are Gypsies — easy to spot, in their colorful
but ragged clothes. Although you may find them anywhere — especially around major
tourist attractions — they’re most prevalent in southern Europe.
The adults mainly beg for money and can be very pushy doing so. The ones you really
need to watch out for, however, are the children. They’ll swarm you while babbling
and sometimes holding up bits of cardboard with messages scrawled on them to dis-
tract you, during which time they rifle your pockets faster than you can say “Stop!” If
you’re standing near a wall or in a metro tunnel, they’ll even be so bold as to pin you
against the wall with the cardboard message so as to fleece you more easily.
Although not physically dangerous, they’re very adept at taking your stuff, and they’re
hard to catch. Keeping on the lookout is your best defense. If a group of scruffy-looking
children approaches, forcefully yell, “No!”, glare, and keep walking; if they persist,
yell “Politz!” (which sounds close enough to “police” in any language). If they get near
enough to touch you, push them away — don’t hold back just because they’re children.

www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.trans
union.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline
and explain the situation; they may allow you to board the plane if you
have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the police
report you’ve filed.

Getting to Europe
In This Chapter
 Consulting a travel agent
 Considering package tours
 Choosing an escorted tour
 Arranging your own flights
Just thinking about your European vacation fills you with excitement.
At last all those famous sights, scenes, and experiences you’ve been
dreaming about are going to become reality. All that’s left is to figure out
how to get there.
Airline options are plentiful. To check out the offerings, you can tap a
travel agent for assistance, call flight reservation desks on your own, or
cruise the Internet for the best deals. Also, you can choose to set out on
your European explorations with or without a professional guide.
Before you get down to the business of booking a flight, take time to
wing your way through this chapter.
Seeking a Travel Agent’s Advice
Word of mouth is the best way to find a qualified, reliable travel agent.
Finding a cheap deal on airfare, accommodations, and a rental car is the
least a good travel agent can do. A more helpful agent goes the extra
mile to give you vacation value by considering comfort and expense.
Great agents can give advice on several travel issues, including how
much time to spend in a particular destination and how to choose an
economical and practical flight plan. They can also make reservations
for competitively priced rental cars and find deals at better hotels.
To help your travel agent help you, do a little research before you sit
down to talk; picking up this book is a great start. Read the destination
chapters so that you’ll have a general idea of where you want to stay
and what you want to do. If you have access to the Internet, check prices
on the Web to get a ballpark feel for prices (see “Booking your flight
online,” later in this chapter, for airline-shopping ideas).

When you have enough information in hand, pack up your notes and
make an appointment to see a travel agent with experience in Europe.
Agents rely on a variety of resources, so your arrangements are likely to
cost less than if you seal the deal yourself. Plus, your agent can suggest
alternatives if your first choice of hotels is unavailable, and issue airline
tickets and hotel vouchers.
The travel industry is built on commissions. When you book a vacation,
your agent earns a paycheck from the airline, hotel, or tour company
with which you’re doing business. Some airlines and resorts started
eliminating agents’ commissions several years ago. Customers now have
to make specific mention of certain hotels or airlines if they’re interested
in booking; otherwise, the agent may not bring them up as options. Bear
in mind, too, that some travel agents now charge a fee for their services.
Exploring Package-Tour Possibilities
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public.
Comparing packages
When dealing with packagers, keep in mind that differences exist among
the available options — differences that may significantly affect your
travel experience. Set side by side, one combo may top another in any of
the following ways:
 Better class of hotels
 Same hotels for lower prices
 Accommodations and travel days (days of departure and return)
may be limited or flexible
 Escorted and independent packages available — not one or the
other only
 Option to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips (also
at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour
Some packagers specialize in overpriced, international chain hotels.
Spending time shopping around can yield rewards; don’t hesitate to
compare deals and details before you fork over your funds.
Hunting down the deals
You can find a tour package on your own. In fact, the information is right
under your nose: Start by looking for packagers’ advertisements in the
travel section of your local Sunday paper. Also check national travel
Chapter 5: Getting to Europe 63

magazines such as Arthur Frommer’s Budget Travel, Travel + Leisure,
National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Reputable packagers include these standouts:
 American Express Vacations (% 800-346-3607; www.american
express.com/travel)
 Euro Vacations (% 877-471-3876; www.eurovacations.com)
 Go-Today.com (% 425-487-9632; www.go-today.com)
 Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com)
 Magical Holidays (www.magicalholidays.com)
Airlines often package flights together with accommodations. When you
check out the airline choices, look for one that offers both frequent serv-
ice to your airport and frequent-flier miles.
The following airlines offer tour packages:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.
com)
 Continental Airlines Vacations (% 888-898-9255; www.cool
vacations.com)
 Delta Vacations (% 800-872-7786; www.deltavacations.com)
 Northwest Airlines World Vacations (% 800-800-1504; www.nwa
worldvacations.com)
 United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com)
 US Airways Vacations (% 800-455-0123; www.usairways
vacations.com)
Most European airlines offer competitive packages as well (see the
Quick Concierge for their Web sites and toll-free numbers).
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz,
Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If
you’re unsure about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the
Better Business Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go
online to www.bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based,
don’t book with it.
The biggest hotel chains and resorts sometimes offer packages, too. If
you already know where you want to stay, call the hotel or resort and
ask about land/air packages.

64

Joining an Escorted Tour
Many people love escorted tours. The tour company takes care of all the
details and tells you what to expect at each leg of your journey. You
know your costs up front, and you don’t get many surprises. Escorted
tours can take you to see the maximum number of sights in the mini-
mum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, consider purchasing travel
insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay up front. But
don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour operator doesn’t
fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid for, there’s
no reason to think that it will fulfill its insurance obligations, either. Get
travel insurance through an independent agency. (We tell you more
about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 9.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? What if the
tour operator cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain
escorted tours may not be for you.
 Can you opt out of certain activities? Does the tour allow picking
and choosing activities; or does the bus leave once a day, and
you’re out of luck if you’re not onboard?
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum group
size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough people. If a
quota exists, find out what it is and how close they are to reaching
it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers, but the
information may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. Are all your meals planned in advance? Can
you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Chapter 5: Getting to Europe 65

Making Your Own Arrangements
So you want to plan the trip on your own? This section tells you all you
need to know to research and book the perfect flight.
Booking your flight
With the introduction of codesharing — one carrier selling flights as its
own on another carrier — customers now enjoy more travel options and
an easier time making flight arrangements. Chances are, you can call
your favorite airline and come up with a plan that flies you from just
about anywhere in North America to just about anywhere in Europe.
Listed in the Quick Concierge are the phone numbers and Web sites for
all the major North American and European airlines that offer direct
flights from North America to Europe. In these days of airline alliances,
widespread codesharing, and carrier consolidation, it hardly seems to
matter which airline you call to make your booking. Chances are, their
interlocking partnerships will ensure you can flit from your hometown to
your European destination on any combination of carriers, foreign or
domestic, and any one of them can arrange this for you.
Getting to Europe from the U.S., you may have to travel first to a hub,
such as New York, Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Atlanta, Los Angeles,
or San Francisco, in order to pick up a direct flight to your destination.
To reach smaller European cities, you’ll probably be routed through a
major European hub such as London, Paris, or Frankfurt.
Shopping for the best airfare
Competition among the major U.S. and European airlines is unlike that of
any other industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basi-
cally, a coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hun-
dreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who want
to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known as the
full fare. But if you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday
night, and are willing to travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can
qualify for the least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare.
On most flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, the full
fare is close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket
may cost less than half that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — for Europe
that’s generally September 15 through June 14. You almost never see a
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
66

sale around the peak summer-vacation months of July and August, or
around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many people fly regardless of
the fare they have to pay — though this is less true if you can get a
direct flight to Europe from your home airport (most folks travel domes-
tically for the holidays). Often, flying into Europe’s major cities (usually
London and Paris) brings the price of a ticket down. Also, look into pur-
chasing an open-jaw plane ticket, one that allows you to fly into one
European city and depart from another — say, flying into London but
out of Madrid on your way home. Open-jaw tickets can sometimes be a
more expensive option, but it’s a wonderful way to keep your itinerary
flexible, and you don’t have to backtrack to the first city on your trip.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sections; U.S.
travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and
Miami Herald. For less-developed destinations, small travel agencies cater-
ing to immigrant communities in large cities often have the best deals.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Some reliable consolidators include:
 Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airticketsdirect.
com)
 AutoEurope (% 888-223-5555; www.autoeurope.com)
 Cheap Tickets (% 800-755-4333; www.cheaptickets.com)
 Flights.com (www.flights.com)
 Lowestfare.com (% 866-210-3289; www.lowestfare.com)
 STA Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com)
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) sell
most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. Canadian travelers should
try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca. U.K. residents can go 
to www.expedia.co.uk, www.opodo.co.uk, or Travelsupermarket 
(% 0845-345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.com), a flight search engine
that offers flight comparisons for the budget airlines whose seats often
end up in bucket-shop sales. Meta search sites (which find and then direct
you to airline and hotel Web sites for booking) include Sidestep.com and
Kayak.com — the latter includes fares for budget carriers, such as JetBlue
and Spirit, and the major airlines. Site59.com is a great source for last-
minute flights and getaways. In addition, most airlines offer online-only
fares that even their phone agents know nothing about.
Chapter 5: Getting to Europe 67

Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
megasites, such as Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), that
compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials. For last-minute
trips in the U.S. and Europe, www.lastminute.com sometimes has
better deals than the major-label sites.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also, keep an eye on
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog.com
and Farecast.com.
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, prompter
service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or delayed, or
if you want to change your seat (especially after you’ve racked up some
miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; frequent-flier credit
cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing your everyday shop-
ping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs on the market, con-
sumers have never had more options. Investigate the program details of
your favorite airlines before you sink points into any one of them.
Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, of
those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances given your
most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your best
advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk
(www.flyertalk.com) or go to Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer
(www.insideflyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs
in detail and post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.

Getting Around Europe
In This Chapter
 Discovering low-cost, European air travel
 Riding the rails of Europe
 Taking buses and ferries
 Renting a car
T
raveling around Europe is part of the fun of a European vacation.
Trains, planes, boats, buses, and rental cars make traveling from
country to country fast and easy. But this is where a little basic knowl-
edge can also help you to save hundreds of dollars. Choosing the right
rail pass and knowing how to get the best travel deals from no-frills air-
lines and rental-car agencies can slash your travel budget in half. This
chapter provides the ins and outs of traveling within Europe.
Flying Around Europe
Air travel within Europe makes sense only if you need to cover great dis-
tances in a limited amount of time. The good news is that with the
advent of no-frills airlines, air travel in Europe is now an option even to
those on the strictest of budgets.
Though train travel is always more fun, flying is something to consider if
your train ride would take up most of a day, and if the plane ticket is
actually cheaper than the train. Always remember, however, that train
stations in European cities are usually right in the city center, close or
easily accessible to hotels and attractions. If you arrive by plane, you
have to consider the hassle of getting into the city from the airport,
sometimes making the savings in time and money not really worth it.
You have three main choices for air travel within Europe:
 Regular flights on major European carriers: Although this is your
best bet, it’s also the most expensive option. You can call the air-
lines’ toll-free numbers (see this book’s Quick Concierge) before
you leave for Europe to arrange these flights, or you can contact a
travel agent or the airline’s office in any European city.

 Consolidator tickets: Budget travel agencies across Europe, espe-
cially in London and Athens, sell cheap tickets from consolidators.
Although these tickets aren’t totally unreliable, they constitute the
least-safe way to fly. Shady consolidators can go out of business
overnight (always pay for these tickets with a credit card so that
you can cancel payment if the consolidator goes bust), they have a
higher rate of cancellation, and many of the airlines (often Middle
Eastern and Asian carriers) follow lower safety standards than
major North American and European carriers.
 Small, no-frills airlines: Over the past few years, Europe has devel-
oped a fabulous system of no-frills airlines. Modeled on American
upstarts such as Southwest and JetBlue, dozens of these small car-
riers sell one-way tickets for destinations throughout Europe for
well under $100. By keeping their overhead down — electronic tick-
eting (often via Web sites exclusively, no phone calls allowed), no
meal service, and flights to and from major cities’ secondary air-
ports or smaller cities — these airlines are able to offer amazingly
low fares.
The two big players in the no-frills business are easyJet (www.easy
jet.com), which has hubs in London, Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester,
Barcelona, Amsterdam, and Paris; and Ryanair (www.ryanair.com),
which flies out of London, Glasgow, Dublin, Shannon, Bremen,
Stockholm, Brussels, Milan, St. Tropez, and several other locations.
The current short list of the most dependable among the other
choices includes: Virgin Express in Brussels (www.virgin
express.com); Germanwings (www.germanwings.com) and Tuifly
(www.tuifly.com) in Germany; Volare (www.volareweb.com) in
Italy; Sterling (www.sterlingticket.com) in Scandinavia; and Air
Europa (www.air-europa.com) and Spanair (www.spanair.com)
in Spain.
There are many more. Independent Web sites such as www.low
costairlines.org keep track of the industry.
Taking the Train
Fast, efficient, convenient, and comfortable, trains rule European travel.
As a rule, European trains run on time, are clean, and utilize a vast rail
network that includes almost every major and minor city — all with the
added bonus of watching all that scenery roll by.
For average travel times by rail between the destinations in this book,
see this book’s Quick Concierge.
Figuring out the basics of train travel
In North America, most folks hop in the car or book a plane ticket for
long-distance travel, but in Europe, people still take the train. Though
no-frills airlines (discussed earlier in this chapter) are now the best way
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
70

to cover great distances between far-flung countries, the train is still
king when it comes to exploring Europe. But before you ride the rails,
you should know a few things.
Understanding train classifications
Europe offers several train classifications that range from local runs that
stop at every tiny station to high-speed bullet trains (France’s TGV;
Italy’s ETR; Pendolino, Spain’s AVE), new international high-speed runs
(Thalys from Paris to Brussels; Artesia from Paris to Turin and Milan;
and from Barcelona to Madrid), and the Eurostar Channel Tunnel train
between London, Paris, and Brussels. The popular EC (Eurocity), IC
(Intercity — same as Eurocity, but doesn’t cross an international
border), and EN (Euronight) are other fast trains.
The Eurostar train (% 08705-186-186 in London, 0044-1235-617-575 in
France and Belgium, 800-EUROSTAR [800-387-6782] in the U.S.; www.euro
star.com) runs through the Channel Tunnel and connects London’s St.
Pancras International Station with the Gare du Nord in Paris and Central
Station in Brussels. Both trips take about three hours (plus or minus the
one-hour time-zone difference). Because the old train-ferry-train route
between Dover and Calais takes so much longer, Eurostar is an option
worth considering.
Many high-speed trains throughout Europe require that you pay a supple-
ment of around $15 to $25 in addition to your regular ticket price. If you
buy point-to-point tickets, this supplement is included in the full price. If
you travel with a rail pass, you won’t have to pay this supplement.
Finding schedule and fare information
Contact Rail Europe (% 877-257-2887 in the U.S., 800-361-7245 in
Canada; www.raileurope.com) to receive more information about train
travel in Europe and to get online schedule information. Looking at Rail
Europe’s Web site is an easy way to get an idea of train schedules. You
can also visit the Web sites of the individual national rail systems in
Europe, which always have the latest schedules and prices (occasionally
even in English).
Most train schedules and signs use native names for cities, not the
English equivalent. For example, Athens is Athinai, Cologne is Köln,
Copenhagen is København, Florence is Firenze, Lisbon is Lisboa, Munich
is München, Naples is Napoli, Pamplona is often Iruñea, Prague is Praha,
Venice is Venezia, Vienna is Wien, and so on.
Making reservations
Some of the speediest high-speed trains require reservations, including
Eurostar (the Channel Tunnel train), TGV in France, Pendolino in Italy,
and long-distance trains in Spain. And it’s also a good idea to reserve a
seat for any train travel during the crowded summer months and during
holiday periods. If you don’t, even if you have a rail pass, you may find
yourself standing.

You must reserve ahead of time, for a fee, any train marked with an R on
the schedule — usually around $20. You can almost always reserve a
seat within a few hours of the train’s departure, but booking a few days
in advance at the station assures that you have a seat. You must also
reserve any sleeping couchettes or sleeping berths (see the next sec-
tion, “Taking overnight trains,” for more information).
Unless you’re on an extremely tight schedule, it’s probably better not to
buy or reserve individual train tickets before leaving home. Doing so
locks you into a schedule that you may want to change once you’re in
Europe. The exceptions are the Eurostar and the Artesia train between
Paris and major Italian cities; it’s smart to reserve both before arriving in
Europe. Remember, though, that if you’re going to buy a money-saving
rail pass, you need to do so before leaving home; see “Saving time and
money with rail passes,” later in this chapter.)
Traveling without a reserved seat on a regular train can become a prob-
lem in the summer and during holiday periods, when European trains
are full. Without a reservation, you aren’t guaranteed a seat, no matter
what kind of rail pass you have. Many overnight trains now require you
to make at least a seat reservation for around 5 ($8), if not a couchette
or sleeper (see earlier in this section).
To find out if a seat is reserved, look on the partition outside individual
train compartments; there you’ll see a little plastic window with RESERVED
on it for those seats that have been reserved. In newer trains, the
RESERVED sign may be a computerized display above the seat. To save
yourself the trouble of getting booted out later in your trip, check to
make sure that you’re occupying an unreserved seat before you claim it.
If you have reserved a seat, no problem: You’re assigned a specific seat
in a specific train car.
Taking overnight trains
Go to bed in Paris, wake up in Rome. What could be more convenient?
On an overnight train, not only do you get a cheap (if uncomfortable)
bed for the night, but you also maximize your time and money.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
74
Layout of the train
Some European trains still have the old-fashioned seating configuration wherein each
car has ten small compartments, with seats for six to eight people in second (or stan-
dard) class, and four to six people (in plushier chairs) in first class, with a corridor run-
ning alongside. Most European trains, however, have switched to modern “saloon”
cars with seats running down both sides of an open aisle. Note: Many adult rail passes
(see “Saving time and money with rail passes,” later in this section) are for travel in
first-class compartments — a lovely luxury.

On an overnight train, you have four sleeping choices:
 Regular seats: Use this as a last resort, because you won’t get
much sleep sitting up.
 Fold-out seats: In regular sitting compartments, you can often pull
facing seat bottoms out toward each other, collapsing the seat
backs. It’s not a very comfortable way to nap, and the doors in
these basic compartments don’t lock.
 Flip-down couchettes: Sleeping couchettes (six per compartment
in standard class; four or two per compartment in first class) are
narrow, flip-down, shelflike bunks. In a couchette compartment,
you can lock the door (make sure it’s locked before you go to bed)
and a conductor watches over the rail car and your passport,
which he holds overnight for border crossings. For about 30 ($48)
per couchette, this option is one of the cheapest sleeping deals
that you can find in Europe. Unless you reserve an entire compart-
ment, prepare to share your room with strangers.
 A sleeping-car berth: Usually, sleeping-car berths are only a first-
class option. For 40 to 95 ($64–$152), depending on distance
traveled and how many bunks there are, you get a tiny room with
two to four bunks and a private sink. Berths are a smidgen comfier
than couchettes, but strangers may populate the other bunk if
you’re traveling alone.
Don’t drink the water on the trains, not even to rinse your mouth. Use
this water for hand-washing only. Trains, especially overnight trains,
dehydrate you quickly, so make sure that you bring bottled water to sip
and to rinse your mouth and toothbrush the next morning.
Saving time and money with rail passes
The rail pass — a single multi-use ticket that allows you unlimited travel
for a certain number of days of travel within a set period of time — was
the greatest value in European travel until no-frills airlines came along,
and it remains the easiest and most economical way to get around
Europe by train. If your trip is going to cover countless kilometers on the
rails, a pass ends up costing you considerably less than buying individ-
ual train tickets once you arrive. A rail pass also gives you the freedom
to hop on a train whenever you feel like it, making a day trip out of town
cheap and easy. An extra bonus of the rail pass is that you don’t have to
wait in ticket lines, unless you want to reserve a seat (always a good
idea).
The granddaddy of passes is the Eurail pass, now called the Eurail
Global Pass, which covers 20 countries (most of Western Europe, except
the U.K.). If you’re taking a whirlwind, Europe-wide tour, this is your
single best investment. The more modest but flexible Selectpass covers
three to five contiguous countries for more focused trips. Just remem-
ber: Eurail passes must be purchased before you arrive in Europe.
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 75

These rail passes also include discounts on private rail lines (such as
those in the Alps) and the Eurostar between London and Paris or
Brussels, and give you discounts or free travel for ferry crossings (Italy
to Greece) and some boat rides on rivers (Rhine, Mosel) and lakes (espe-
cially Swiss lakes).
Using a rail pass
From the date that you buy your rail pass, you have six months to begin
using it. You have to validate your pass at a European train station the
day you want to start using the pass. Validating your rail pass is the only
time that you have to wait in a ticket line, unless you’re reserving seats
or couchettes or buying supplements. With consecutive-day, unlimited-
use Eurail passes, you can just hop on trains at whim.
Rail passes are available in either consecutive-day or flexipass versions
(in which you have two months to use, say, 10 or 15 days of train travel).
Consecutive-day passes are best for those taking the train very fre-
quently (every day or every couple of days) and covering a lot of
ground. Flexipasses are for folks who want to range far and wide but
take their time doing so.
The flexipass gives you a certain number of days (5–15) to travel within
a two-month period from initial validation. Printed on your flexipass are
a number of little boxes that correspond with the number of travel days
you bought. Write the date in the next free box (in ink) every new day
that you board a train. The conductor comes around, checking your
ticket to make sure that you’ve put down the right date.
What date do I write down for overnight trains, you ask? A Eurail day
begins at 7 p.m. and runs 29 hours until the following midnight. In other
words, when you board an overnight train after 7 p.m., write the next
day’s date in the box. Doing so clears you for that night and any travel-
ing that you do the next day.
Eurail covers Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg,
the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and
Switzerland. Note: The United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland) isn’t included because U.K. countries use the BritRail
pass (also available from Rail Europe).
Knowing your options
There are saverpasses for two to five people traveling together, and
rail/drive passes that mix train days with car-rental days. If you’re 25 or
under, you can opt to buy a regular first-class pass or a less-expensive
second-class youth pass; if you’re 26 or over, only first-class passes are
available. Passes for children 4 to 11 are half-price, and children 3 and
under travel free. Seniors 60 and older qualify for special discounted
passes.

month; $1,104 for two months; or $1,364 for three months.
 Eurail Global Pass Youth Flexi: Only for travelers under age 26,
allowing for 10 days of travel within two months for $574 or 15 days
within two months for $754.
 Eurail Selectpass: For trips covering three to five contiguous Eurail
countries connected by rail or ship. It’s valid for two months, and
cost varies according to the number of countries you plan to visit.
A pass for three countries is $473 for five days, $522 for six days,
$619 for eight days, and $717 for 10 days. A four-country pass costs
$529 for five days, $578 for six days, $675 for eight days, and $771
for 10 days. A pass for five countries costs $583 for five days; $632
for six days; $731 for eight days; $825 for 10 days; and $1,047 for 
15 days.
 Eurail Selectpass Saver: Same as the Eurail Selectpass (and slightly
less expensive), but for two to five people traveling together. Per
person, the three-country pass is $401 for five days, $445 for six
days, $574 for eight days, and $607 for 10 days. A pass for four
countries is $447 for five days, $492 for six days, $574 for eight
days, and $654 for 10 days. A five-country pass is $494 for five
days, $537 for six days, $619 for eight days, $700 for 10 days, and
$890 for 15 days.
 Eurail Selectpass Youth: Good in second class, only for travelers 25
and under. Cost varies according to the number of countries you
plan to visit, but all passes are valid for two months. For three
countries, the per-person price is $307 for five days, $342 for six
days, $401 for eight days, $464 for 10 days. A four-country pass
costs, per person, $344 for five days, $375 for six days, $438 for
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 77

eight days, and $489 for 10 days. A five-country pass is $379 for five
days, $410 for six days, $473 for eight days, $534 for 10 days, and
$680 for 15 days.
 Eurail Select Pass Drive: This pass offers the best of both worlds,
mixing train travel and rental cars (through Hertz or Avis) for less
money than it would cost to do them separately (and it’s one of the
only ways to get around the high daily car-rental rates in Europe
when you rent for less than a week). A flexipass, it includes three,
four, or five days of unlimited, first-class rail travel and two days of
unlimited mileage car rental (through Avis or Hertz) within a two-
month period. Prices (per person for one or two adults) vary with
the class of the car and the number of adjoining (contiguous
border) countries you’ll be visiting (three, four, or five). For a three-
country pass that includes three days of train travel and two days
of car rental, the cost is: $321/$744 economy, $458/$778 compact,
$476/$796 intermediate, $516/$836 automatic. You can add up to six
extra car days ($52 each economy, $70 compact, $78 midsize, $98
small automatic). You have to reserve the first “car day” a week
before leaving home but can make the other reservations as you go
(subject to availability). If you have more than two adults in your
group, the extra passengers get the car portion free but must buy
the four-day rail pass.
There are also national rail passes of various kinds (flexi, consecutive,
rail/drive, and so on) for each country, dual country passes (Eurail
France–Italy or Eurail Switzerland–Austria, for example), and regional
passes such as BritRail (covering Great Britain) and the European East
Pass (good in Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and
Slovakia).
Purchasing your rail pass
You must buy passes for Eurail and its offshoots before you leave home.
(You can purchase passes in some major European train stations, but
you pay up to 50 percent more.) You can buy rail passes from most
travel agents, but the largest supplier is RailEurope (% 877-257-2887 in
the U.S., 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com), which also
sells most national passes.
Passing on passes
Nifty as they are, rail passes aren’t the wisest investment for every trip.
If you’re on an extended tour of Europe and plan to travel to several dif-
ferent countries by train, a Eurail pass is generally a good idea. However,
if you’re taking shorter, more focused trips, or if you plan to take only a
couple of train rides over the course of your visit, a rail pass may end up
costing more than buying point-to-point tickets after you arrive.
Is any pass right for you? The answer is different for every trip, so pre-
pare to do some math. After you create an itinerary, you can estimate
how much you think you’ll spend on individual tickets by contacting
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
78

Rail Europe (% 877-257-2887 in the U.S., 800-361-7245 in Canada; www.
raileurope.com) for prices. Choosing which pass is right for you can
be tricky as well. For example, you have to travel at least 22 days (24
days with the youth pass) to make a two-month consecutive-day pass a
better deal per trip than the 15-days-within-2-months flexipass. You have
to decide if the extra days are worth it, depending on your travel plans
and how much freedom you want to jump trains on a whim.
Navigating the train station
Like the trains themselves, European train stations are generally clean
and user-friendly. They also offer good snack bars. Spending 20 minutes
there when you first arrive in a city can help orient you and prepare you
for your visit.
Most train stations are fairly safe, but because they’re central clearing-
houses for tourists, pickpockets flourish. Never abandon your bags,
always pay attention, and don’t become distracted by hotel touts offer-
ing rooms.
Here are a few suggestions for taking advantage of the train station’s
resources:
 Hit the ATM. Most stations have a bank or ATM where you can pick
up some of the local currency.
 Find the tourist-board kiosk. Pick up whatever free info, maps, and
brochures you need.
 Visit a newsstand. Unless the free map that you picked up from the
tourist office is better (a rare thing), buy a map. Buy a phone card if
you’ll be in the country long enough to use it, purchase the local
English-language information/events magazine, and buy a local
transportation pass or individual tickets for the bus or subway.
 Find the lockers. If you want to dump your heaviest bag, find the
lockers or the luggage storage office; the cost is generally about $10
a day. You’ll definitely want to do this if you’re only in town for a
half-day visit, but even if you’re spending the night, it’s easier to go
hotel hunting without your heaviest luggage.
 Make some calls. Find a phone and call around for a hotel, or use
the station’s hotel booking service. See Chapter 7 for more hotel
advice. (You’ll save a lot of precious time by reserving your hotel
room before you arrive.)
In smaller towns, the tiny station bar may double as the ticket office.
Most stations, however, have banks of ticket windows, and more and
more of them have automated ticket machines. Try to figure out which
window you need before getting in the invariably long lines. The bulk of
windows are for purchasing regular tickets, and a few windows are for
people who are only making seat reservations (if, for example, you have
a Eurail pass but want to be assured of a seat or couchette).
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 79

Before you exit the train station, verify the options for your departure,
and check train times for any day trips that you plan to make. You can
then swing by the train station a day or two before you leave to buy your
tickets and reserve seats or couchettes rather than wait until the last
minute, when the lengthy ticket lines may thwart your plans.
The rail information desk — not to be confused with the city tourist
board’s desk (the two won’t answer each other’s questions) — usually
has a long line and a harried staff. Use the do-it-yourself information
sources as much as possible. Modern stations in big cities usually have
computerized rail information kiosks and automatic, multilingual ticket-
ing machines.
When the lines at the information desk are long, you can still access the
information you need the old-fashioned way. Almost all stations (except
some in Paris) have schedule posters that list the full timetables and
regular track numbers for all trains that pass through the station.
Arrivals are usually on a white poster and departures are on a yellow
one. These posters show you the trains, their departure times, whether
you need a reservation (usually marked by a prominent R), stops along
the route, and the final destination for that train. Keep in mind that track
assignments may change on a daily basis. In larger stations, check the
electronically updated departure boards. You can then seek out a con-
ductor on the indicated platform and say your destination in a question-
ing voice while pointing at the train-in-waiting for reconfirmation before
boarding. After you’re onboard, you may also want to triple-check with
one of the other passengers.
Make sure that you get on the right car, and not just the right train.
Individual train cars may split from the rest of the train down the line
and join a different train headed to a different destination. Making sure
that you’re on the right car is especially important when taking a night
train. (If you have a reserved spot, you don’t have to worry.) Each car
has its own destination placard on the side of the car, which may also
list major stops en route. If you have a reserved seat, the ticket will tell
you which car and seat is yours.

80
Ticketing tips for public transport
Although most metros (subways) have turnstiles, other forms of public transportation
(buses, trams, cable cars) in European cities sometimes operate on the honor system.
As soon as you board, you’re expected to punch your ticket in a little box on the bus.
Make sure that you hold on to all tickets (metro, bus, or otherwise) for the duration of
your ride, because spot inspectors board regularly or stop you in the metro tunnels. If
they discover that you don’t have a valid ticket, they fine you on the spot; fines range
from $20 to $300. On the London Underground (subway), you need your ticket to get
back out at the end of your journey.

In many countries now, you must stamp your ticket in a little box — 
usually attached to a column at the beginning of each track — in order
to validate it before boarding the train. Conductors are increasingly 
issuing fines for not validating the ticket, even to unknowing tourists
who plead ignorance. This is not an issue, of course, if you’re traveling
with a rail pass.
Sailing to Your Destination by Ferry
A ferry trip may figure into your European travel plans, perhaps the tra-
ditional English Channel crossing from Dover, England, to Calais, France,
or to Greece from Italy. Ferry travel is usually scenic and can be cheap,
but it’s also slow. For approximately double the money of a ferry, you
can often take a hydrofoil (a sort of a ferry on steroids). A hydrofoil trav-
els about twice as fast as the ferry, but you’re stuck below deck for the
entire trip and the noise level can be deafening.
Getting Around by Bus
Regional and long-haul bus service in Europe is efficient and inexpen-
sive, but it’s also the slowest mode of travel, taking two to four times as
long as the train. But in some rural and more remote parts of Europe,
buses are your best (perhaps only) option. If the bus makes a better con-
nection for your itinerary (Florence to Siena, for example), take it. In
some countries — especially Ireland, Greece, and parts of Spain — the
bus network is better than the train service.
Driving in Europe
Although trains are great, a car is sometimes the best way to see Europe,
or certain parts of it. A car gives you the freedom to explore scenic
areas, head down any road you feel like, and visit vineyards, medieval
hamlets, and fortified castles. With a car, you can make your own sched-
ule and get away from the set time structures of trains. Using a car is the
easiest way to explore any small region in depth.
But driving a car also has its downside. For example, you have to deal
with aggressive drivers, navigate nerve-racking and confusing city traf-
fic, try to understand road signs in different languages, and find and pay
for parking whenever you stop. Likewise, you can’t relax when you’re
behind the wheel, and the gasoline prices in Europe are usually at least
double what they are in the U.S.
Obtaining an international driver’s permit
If you plan to drive in Europe, you may want to bring along and carry, in
addition to your regular driver’s license, an international driving permit.
This permit isn’t required; it merely translates your data into several 
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 81

languages. The permit costs $15 from AAA (call % 407-444-7000 to find
the office nearest you, or visit www.aaa.com). You don’t have to be an
AAA member to get the pass, but if you are, ask for any free info and
maps that they can send you to cover the European countries you’ll be
visiting.
Knowing when to rent a car
If you want to cover lots of ground, concentrate on the cities, or go solo,
taking the train is better than renting a car. However, if you’re explor-
ing a single country or region, want to visit many small towns, and trav-
eling in a party of three or more, renting a car makes economic sense.
Splitting the cost of one car rental is cheaper than train tickets when
you’re traveling with a group, and renting a car allows you more flexibil-
ity if you’re traveling with kids. Tuscany, Provence, southern Spain, and
Ireland are among the most scenic and rewarding areas in Europe to
explore by car.
Avoid renting and having a car in cities. It’s stressful and exorbitantly
expensive. Between hotel parking charges and garage and lot fees, you
can expect to pay anywhere from $15 to $100 a day just to park. Save
renting the car for exploring the countryside. Arrange to pick up your
rental car the morning you leave the first city on your driving itinerary
and to drop it off as soon as you pull into your final destination.
In areas where you want to visit the countryside, you can mix and match
your modes of transportation. For example, you can take the train to
Florence, and then spend two or three days driving through the vine-
yards and hill towns of Tuscany to Rome. Rail-and-drive passes (see
“Figuring out the basics of train travel,” earlier in this chapter) are an
easy way to do this.
Saving time and money on rental cars
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you hundreds of dollars.
Follow these tips to get the best deal on a rental car:
 Arrange your rental before you leave home. You can get the best
rates on car rental if you rent ahead of time directly through a
major international rental company. See the Quick Concierge for
the numbers of the major rental companies, plus those that special-
ize in European travel.
 Shop around. You may think that the rental-car companies offer
similar rates, but they don’t. For the same three-day weekend, 
you may hear $50 from one company and $130 from another. 
The European specialists at Auto Europe (% 800-223-5555;
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
82

www.autoeurope.com) and Europe By Car (% 800-223-1516;
www.europebycar.com) invariably offer the best rates. Make sure
to find out what your rental rate includes — or excludes — such as
a collision-damage waiver (CDW), taxes, mileage (you definitely
want unlimited), and any other restrictions that may apply.
 Shop online. As with other aspects of planning your trip, using 
the Internet can make comparison-shopping for a car rental 
much easier. You can check rates at most of the major agencies’
Web sites. Plus, all the major travel sites — Travelocity (www.
travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.
orbitz.com), and Smarter Living (www.smarterliving.com), for
example — have search engines that can dig up discounted car-
rental rates. Just enter the car size you want, the pickup and return
dates, and the location, and the server returns a price. You can
even make the reservation through any of these sites.
 Be flexible. When giving the rental company your dates for pickup
and delivery, inform them that you’re open to other dates as well, if
changing your dates means saving money. Picking up the car on
Thursday instead of Friday, or keeping it over the weekend, may
save you big bucks. You may also save money if you rent for a full
week rather than two days. Finally, check whether the rate is
cheaper if you pick up the car at a location in town instead of the
airport.
 Know your restrictions. Most rental companies restrict where you
can drive. With some companies, you must stay in the country of
rental (usually only smaller, national outfits mandate this rule).
Likewise, most don’t allow you to take a car that you rented in
England to Ireland or the Continent. Few let you drive from any
Western European country into Eastern Europe, so if you’re plan-
ning to drive to Prague, make sure that you make arrangements
with the rental agency before you leave.
 Check any age restrictions. Many car-rental companies add on a
fee for drivers 24 and under, while some don’t rent to them at all. If
you’re 24 or under, research which companies will rent to you with-
out a penalty.
 Lease for longer periods of time. Companies don’t always remind
you of the leasing option, but if you want a car for more than 17
days (up to six months), tell them that you want to short-term-
lease the car (Auto Europe and Europe By Car both offer this
option). Leasing a car gives you a brand-new car and full insurance
coverage with no deductible. The minimum age for renting a car
ranges from 18 to 27, but anyone 18 or over can usually lease a car.
 Mention the ad. If you see an advertised price in your local news-
paper, be sure to ask for that specific rate; otherwise you may be
charged the standard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention 
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 83

membership in AAA, AARP, and trade unions. These memberships
usually entitle you to discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 
percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite air-
lines likely to have sent you discount coupons, but most car rentals
add at least 500 miles to your account.
 Consider a stick shift instead of an automatic. You can save up to
40 percent on the price of car rental if you rent a stick-shift car
instead of an automatic. As an added bonus, stick shifts are more
fuel efficient and often give you better control on Europe’s many
narrow, windy, hilly roads and tight streets in ancient cities.
 Look into coverage you may already have. The collision damage
waiver (CDW) basically allows you to total the car and not be held
liable. Your credit card may cover the CDW if you use it to pay for
the rental, so make sure that you check the terms of your credit
card before purchasing the CDW. However, keep in mind that some
rental agencies in Italy won’t accept a credit card CDW for rentals;
you must purchase it separately instead. Travel Guard (% 800-826-
4919; www.travelguard.com) sells independent CDW coverage for
a mere $7 a day — a sight better than the $10 to $20 per day that
rental agencies tend to charge.
 Carefully consider the other insurance options. The car-rental
companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you harm
others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects insurance (if your
luggage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car
at home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences.
However, if your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if
you don’t have auto insurance, definitely consider the additional
coverage (ask your car-rental agent for more information).
 Remind the company that you’ve already paid. Make sure that
you know exactly what you paid for when you arranged your car
rental. Many times, the car pickup offices in Europe overlook the
fact that your credit card was already charged for the rental cost,
and they try to double-charge you. Usually, you end up with one
charge on your card from the European office for the first full tank
of gas that it provides (which is almost never included in the origi-
nal rental price).
 Inspect the car before driving away. If the rental agency doesn’t
know that something is wrong with the car you rented when you
drive it off, it’ll assume that you broke the car and charge you
accordingly. If the car’s condition doesn’t match the inspection
form that they want you to sign, point out the discrepancy.

away. Make sure that all locks and doors work, check the various
lights, and scan the entire car for dents, scratches, and fabric rips.
 Check for repair and safety equipment. Check the trunk to make
sure that your rental car is equipped with a jack, inflated spare,
snow chains (for winter driving), and a hazard triangle (most coun-
tries require that you hang this on your trunk if you’re broken
down on the side of the road). Likewise, check the glove compart-
ment for a parking disk. (Ask the rental agency about the parking
disk; they’ll explain the country’s honor-system parking lots, if the
system applies.)
 Gas up before you return the car. When leaving the rental com-
pany, make sure the car has a full tank of gas so that you don’t have
to worry about dealing with local gas stations immediately. Also,
make sure that you return the car with a full tank of gas. Similar to
rental-company practices in North America, if you forget to fill up
the car before you return it, the company will kindly fill it for you at
obscenely jacked-up prices. Before you return the car, find a gas
station and top off the tank.
Understanding European road rules
Except for driving on the left in Great Britain and Ireland, European road
rules are similar enough to American ones that you can drive without fur-
ther instruction. However, the following important differences do exist:
 Watch out for aggressive drivers. Most European drivers are much
more aggressive than American drivers.
 Don’t cruise in the left lane. You do not ride in the left lane on a
four-lane highway; it’s for passing only.
 Help other drivers pass you. If a vehicle comes up from behind
and flashes its lights at you, it’s signaling for you to slow down and
drive more on the shoulder of the road, so it can pass you more
easily.
 Be aware of speed limits. Except for parts of the German
Autobahn, most highways list speed limits of approximately 100 to
135kmph (60–80 mph).
 Remember to convert from kilometers. European measurements
relating to vehicles are in kilometers (distances and speed limits).
For a rough conversion, remember that 1 kilometer equals 0.6
miles.
 Watch out for gas prices. Gas may look reasonably priced, but the
price is per liter, and 3.8 liters equals 1 gallon, so multiply by 4 to
guestimate the equivalent per-gallon price.
Chapter 6: Getting Around Europe 85

 Buy a toll sticker. Some countries, such as Austria and Switzerland,
require highway stickers in lieu of paying tolls (or as a supplement
to cheap tolls). If you rent a car within such a country, your car
already has a sticker. But, if you’re crossing a border, check at the
crossing station to see whether you need to purchase a sticker on
the spot for a nominal fee.
 Drive defensively. Assume that other drivers have a better idea of
what they’re doing than you, and take your hints from them.

A
ccommodations will probably eat up the biggest slice in your travel
budget. But because you have so many options of where to stay,
lodging is also an area in which you can save a lot of money. In Paris, for
example, you can spend several hundred dollars on a lavish luxury hotel
room, stay in a clean but simple two-star hotel down the street for
around $100, or check into a hostel for about $40 per person per night.
This chapter gives you the lowdown on the types of accommodations
you’ll encounter throughout Europe.
Understanding European Hotels
Hotels in Europe, with the exception of the great luxury hotels, tend to
have fewer frills and features than hotels in the United States. For exam-
ple, free cable television is standard at even the cheapest U.S. motel
chains. In Europe, however, few inexpensive hotel rooms even have 
televisions.
Europe’s more traditional hotels and pensions (smaller, family-run
places) typically differ from American hotels in the following ways:
 The appearance of the lobby rarely reflects the appearance of
the rooms. Never judge a European hotel by the front entry; expen-
sive hotels sometimes invest heavily in the lobby but cut corners
on the rooms, and cheaper hotels often have just a dingy desk in a
hallway, but spotless accommodations upstairs.
 “Double” beds are often two side-by-side twin beds made with a
single sheet and blanket (or overlapping twin sheets).

 Hotels in old European buildings often don’t have elevators. If
they do, the few elevators that are available are likely to be small
and slow.
 Floors are often covered with tile or linoleum instead of carpet.
 Bathrooms are vastly and surprisingly different from the
American norm. For more details, see the next section, “The bath-
room: The big culture shock.”
 You can trust hotel staff to provide you with general information
and pamphlets about sightseeing and attractions, but be wary of
anything beyond that. A restaurant recommended by an employee
may be one owned by a relative or someone who has agreed to give
the hotel a kickback. Usually the place is fine, but never count on a
hotel to direct you to the best food in town. Hotel staff members
may also offer to get you tickets for the theater or cultural shows,
but tickets are usually cheaper from the box office or local tourism
office.
The bathroom: The big culture shock
People who haven’t traveled in Europe think that language, architecture,
and food best illustrate the cultural differences between North America
and the Continent. But for many newcomers traveling in Europe, the
greatest culture shock is the bathroom. It all starts in your first cheap
pension, when you find out that the only bathroom is down the hall and
shared by everyone on the floor.
Although more and more European hotels are installing bathrooms in
every room, in small, inexpensive pensions and B&Bs, this is not the
case. If you simply can’t bear the thought of sharing a bathroom, you’ll
have to pay extra for a private bathroom in your room. Except in luxury
hotels, don’t expect your bathroom to be large and glamorous. The bath-
rooms in many budget hotels are almost as small as those in airplanes.
Europeans usually refer to the bathroom itself simply as the toilet. You
may also hear the term wc (short for the British euphemism “water
closet”). A bathroom is where you take a bath.
See the section on electronics in Chapter 9 for information on what isn’t
safe to plug into European bathroom outlets. (Here’s a hint: everything.)
The shower: Another new adventure
In some of the cheaper European hotels, the shower is a nozzle stuck in
the bathroom wall with a drain in the floor and no shower curtain. You
may have to remove the toilet paper from the bathroom to keep it dry
while you drench the entire room with your shower. You won’t encounter
this phenomenon in most hotels; it’s more prevalent in southern Italy
and Greece.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
88

Likewise, the least expensive hotels are generally not going to have full-
size bathtubs, either. You may encounter half-tubs, in which you can 
sit but not stretch out. Your water source in some showers will be a 
flexible, wall-mounted hose with a spray nozzle attached to it.
That extra thing: Not a toilet
The extra porcelain fixture that looks like another toilet is called a bidet
(bi-day). Do not use the bidet as a toilet. The water that jets up and out is
meant to clean your private parts.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
This section offers information and advice that helps you find the
accommodations that meet your needs and your budget.
Comparing room rates and ratings
The hotels listed in this book are rated from $ to $$$$$. These ratings
are not an official ranking system, nor do they reflect the overall quality
of a hotel. Rather, these categories reflect the approximate price range
of the recommended hotels related to their overall value. A ranking of 
$ indicates a budget hotel, $$ means a fairly cheap hotel, $$$ is applied
to moderate hotels, $$$$ means more upscale accommodations, and
$$$$$ is for a recommended splurge. These ratings are comparable only
within the same city, meaning that a $ hotel in an expensive place like
London may cost nearly the same as a $$$$ hotel in a far cheaper area
such as Athens.
In addition to these categories, we include the hotel’s actual rates, which
should make finding something in your price range much easier. Of
course, rates can and do go up regularly, so always check the hotel’s
Web site for current prices or verify them when you call to make your
reservation.
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
Sometimes these rates are posted on the back of your door or on a wall
near the reception desk.
Hotels, of course, are more than happy to charge you the rack rate, but
you can almost always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying
the rack rate is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted
rate. You may be pleasantly surprised. You’ll stand a better chance of
receiving a lower rate if you’re traveling in the off-season or if you’re
staying several days at that one hotel. If you’re booking ahead, many
hotels often run specials on their Web sites that clock in well below the
official rack rates. The rates at the smallest, least expensive hotels, pen-
sions, and B&Bs are usually not negotiable.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 89

Room rates change with the season as occupancy rates rise and fall. But
even within a given season, room prices are subject to change without
notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be different from the rate
you receive when you make your reservation. If you’re thinking of book-
ing a room at a major international chain, be sure to mention member-
ship in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, or any other corporate
rewards programs. You never know when the affiliation may be worth a
few dollars off your room rate.
Reserving a room through a large chain hotel’s toll-free number may
result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand,
the central reservations number may not know about discount rates at
specific locations. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the
toll-free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Verify all hotel charges when you check in. You don’t need to pay in
advance (though occasionally, a budget hotel may require it), but make
sure that you and the hotel clerk agree on the rate. Does it include
breakfast, taxes, and showers? What are the phone rates? Do they
charge even for you to dial your calling card’s toll-free number? Also, be
sure that the quoted rate is per room, not per person, as may be the
case in resort-type coastal towns and islands.
In most European destinations, taxes are automatically included in the
quoted rates. However, in some countries (often in Spain, where it’s 
7 percent; in England, where it’s 17.5 percent; and in France, where it
varies depending on the classification of the hotel), these local taxes are
not included in the price quoted over the phone. Always ask, “Does that
price include all taxes?”
When you check in, take one of the hotel’s business cards. You’d be sur-
prised at how many people forget their hotel’s name or location after a
long day of sightseeing. Many cards have a little map on the back. If
you’re clueless about where your hotel is, hop in a cab and show the
driver the card with the hotel’s address.
Making hotel reservations
Everyone goes about finding and reserving hotels differently, but you’ll
save yourself time and tons of hassle if you book your hotel rooms
before you leave home. That way you don’t have to make calls when you
arrive or trudge from one hotel to the next before you find one that suits
you. Booking in advance minimizes the stress and uncertainty when you
arrive tired and in a strange place. If you’re traveling with young chil-
dren, you don’t want to be fumbling for coins in the train station as you
simultaneously try to reserve a room and keep the kids from running off
for parts unknown.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
90

If you’re not planning to reserve your hotel rooms in advance, at least
find out whether you’ll be arriving in town during a festival or trade fair.
If you are, the gala may be the highlight of your trip, but you could end
up sleeping under the stars if you haven’t booked a room well in
advance (before you leave home).
If you want to reserve a room in a European hotel by fax or e-mail, use
simple language in your communications and include the following 
information:
 Your name
 The number of people in your party
 What kind of room you want (Make sure you say “double with one
bed with private bathroom” or “double with two beds and a shared
bathroom,” and specify “two adults, one child, in the same room.”)
 The number of nights you want to stay
 The date of the first night
To avoid confusion, always spell out the full name of the month —
Europeans numerically abbreviate dates day/month/year, not
month/day/year as Americans do (so “5/6/2009” would be read May 6 in
the United States, but June 5 in Europe).
Always request that the hotel confirm your reservation with a follow-up
fax or printable e-mail that includes all the details (number of people,
room rate, nights you’ll be staying, and so on). Most hotels do this with-
out being asked, but always make sure. Bring the confirmation with you
because it gives you printed proof that you’ve booked a room.
Using a hotel booking service
At the train station or the local tourism office in most European towns,
you’ll find a central hotel reservation service. To use the service, tell the
people working there your price range and the part of the city you’d like
to stay in, and they’ll find you a room. In each city chapter in this book,
we list hotel booking services at the beginning of the hotel section.
The advantages of hotel booking services are:
 They do all the legwork for you. Staff members speak English, so
they can act as interpreters while calling hotels for you.
 They’re helpful when rooms are scarce. If all the hotels are full,
they can often find rooms in hotels that aren’t listed in the guide-
books or other popular resources.
 They know the hotels. The best ones can find accommodations
that perfectly match your needs and price range.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 91

But booking services do have their drawbacks:
 Contacting hotels directly is generally cheaper. Booking services
usually charge a nominal fee of $5 to $10. In many countries, hotels
charge higher rates for bookings they receive through hotel book-
ing services.
 A tourism office booking-desk clerk offers no opinion about the
hotels. Agents just provide you a list to choose from that may
include amenities and prices, but little else.
 They may be biased. A booking agency, especially a private one,
may try to steer you to places on its “push list.” Rather than an
honest evaluation, its “advice” is frequently a sales pitch for the
hotel itself.
In a few large cities — Prague and Rome come to mind — and on popular
Greek islands, hotel reps may approach you as you step off the train or
boat. Some are drumming up business for a perfectly respectable hotel
or pension, but others may be out to fleece you. If an offer interests you,
make sure that the rep pinpoints the exact location of the hotel on a
map and get the price in writing before you go off with him. Pay close
attention to any photos he shows you — a little photo retouching and
some strategic furniture rearrangement can make a dismal cell look
more like a palatial suite.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking
agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline.com). It’s best to shop
around and compare the online sites because prices can vary consider-
ably from site to site. Keep in mind that a hotel at the top of a site’s list-
ing may be there for no other reason than that it paid money to get the
placement.
Of the major sites, Expedia (www.expedia.com) offers a long list of spe-
cial deals and “virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so that you
can see what you’re paying for. Travelocity (www.travelocity.com)
posts unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according
to the AAA rating system. Hotels.com is also reliable. An excellent free
program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.net), can help you search multi-
ple hotel sites at once — even ones you may never have heard of — and
conveniently lists the total price of the room, including the taxes and
service charges. Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.
com), is partly owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton,
Hyatt, and Starwood chains) and is plugged directly into the hotels’
reservations systems. If you book your hotel online, it’s a good idea to
get a confirmation number and make a printout of any online booking
transaction.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
92

In the opaque Web site category, Priceline.com and Hotwire.com are
even better for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick
the neighborhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your
money. Priceline’s hotel listings cover Europe, but it’s generally better at
getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding anything at
the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick Priceline
guests in their least desirable rooms. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay up front, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty-program credits or points or other frequent-guest ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
One of the pluses of Web sites is that they often include virtual
brochures, so you can see pictures of the rooms ahead of time. You can
also usually get the latest hotel rates, plus any discounts the booking
service may be able to secure (especially at pricier inns).
But hotel-booking Web sites also have some big minuses. Because most of
them charge a fee to the hotels they list and the hotels themselves provide
the write-ups and other info, you must take any descriptions or recommen-
dations with a grain of salt. Travel guidebooks like this one provide unbi-
ased recommendations, but most hotel-booking Web sites are just a new
form of promotional material. Also, the bulk of the hotels that choose to be
listed on these sites are high-end, business-oriented, owned by chains, or
all of the above. The best small hotels in the historic city centers, mom-
and-pop pensions, and outright cheap places are usually absent.
Some lodging sites specialize in a particular type of accommodation,
such as bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs), which you don’t find on mainstream
booking sites. Others offer weekend deals at chain properties, which
cater to business travelers and have more empty rooms on weekends.
HotelChatter.com is a daily Webzine offering smart coverage and cri-
tiques of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.com for
helpful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
Finding deals at the last minute
If you arrive at your destination with no hotel reservation, a guidebook
like this can come in very handy. Before you get to town, study the hotel
reviews and figure out which ones best fit your taste and budget. Then
rank your top choices by writing 1, 2, 3, and so on in the book’s margin.
Prioritizing the hotels prepares you to move quickly to the next-best
option if your first choice is full.
After your train pulls into the station, get some change or buy a phone
card at a newsstand and start calling hotels to check for vacancies. This
strategy gives you a head start on the many people who look for a room
by marching out of the station with their bags and walking to the nearest
hotel. If you’re uncomfortable making the calls yourself, the train station
or tourism office may have a hotel reservation service that can do this
for you (see “Using a hotel booking service,” earlier in this chapter).
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 93

If you can’t find a room this way, you can try wandering the streets
checking each hotel you pass. The areas around city train stations usu-
ally are full of cheap hotels, but they’re also often in bland — sometimes
seedy — neighborhoods.
Hotels outside the center of town often have more rooms available and
are cheaper than centrally located ones. You may be able to get a good
deal in the next town over, but it won’t be worth the trouble if it’s more
than a 30-minute train ride away.
To get the best price on the best room, follow these tips:
 Compare different hotels. Many people don’t want to run from
place to place, but if you have some time and are counting your
pennies, it’s worth a try. Don’t assume that the first hotel you visit
is the best. If you’ve called around and lodging seems in short
supply, take a room where you can get it. But if rooms seem plenti-
ful, tell the first hotel you stop in that you’ll think about it and head
to another one nearby.
 Ask to see different rooms. When you get to the hotel, don’t feel
obligated to take the first room you’re shown. Ask to see some
other ones. Open and close windows to see how well they block
out noise. Check the rates posted on the room door (usually there
by law) to make sure they match the rate you were quoted and the
rate that’s posted in the lobby. Ask whether some rooms are less
expensive than others.
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed
questions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best
room in the house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually
larger, quieter, and have more windows and light than standard
rooms, and they don’t always cost more. Also, ask if the hotel is
renovating; if it is, request a room away from the renovation work.
Inquire, too, about the location of the restaurants, bars, and discos
in the hotel — all sources of annoying noise. And if you aren’t
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
94
Checking in at the chains
International chain hotels, which you can usually reserve from home, are sometimes
located on the edge of town in the business or industrial district. They’re huge, imper-
sonal, and expensive, but you can count on a certain level of amenities and services.
There is one chain that does it a bit differently in Europe. By partnering with existing
downtown hotels, Best Western International (%800-528-1234; www.bestwestern.
com) usually offers personality and location. Often a European Best Western is a local
bastion of a hotel that’s been a solid low-end-of-luxury choice in that city for decades,
if not a century or more.

happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If
they have another room, they should be happy to accommodate
you, within reason.
 Bargain. The more empty rooms a hotel has to fill for the night, the
better your chances of getting a lower price. If you’re staying a
single night during high season, you’ll have to pay the going rate.
But for off-season stays and for longer than three nights, ask for a
discount. Many places have weekend discounts, too.
For more tips on saving money on hotel costs, see Chapter 4.
Discovering Other Options
The reviews in this book include standard hotels (along with a few tradi-
tional and charming family-run pensions), which are generally large 
and likely to have rooms available. But hotels aren’t your only lodging
option.
The most popular alternatives
Each country seems to have its own hotel alternatives, from Alpine
hikers’ shacks to rental villas in Tuscany. Here’s a quick rundown on the
most popular substitutes for the traditional hotel (for more information
on each of these, check with the local tourism office):
 B&Bs or pensions: When Europeans go on vacation, they often stay
at these small, family-run versions of hotels. If the hotels in town
charge $150 for a double, a pension usually costs only $80 to $100.
Upscale B&Bs can be found in larger cities such as London and
Paris.
Some B&Bs require you to pay for breakfast or half or full board
(meaning that one or all meals are included); private bathrooms are
still rare (although this is changing); and the service is almost
always genial and personable.
 Private room rentals: Even the cheapest B&B can’t beat the price
of renting a room in a private home, which can run as low as $40 to
$60 for a double. This is a great option for single travelers because
you don’t pay the single-occupancy rate that most hotels charge.
The quality of the accommodations in rental rooms is less consis-
tent than at standard hotels, but at worst you’re stuck in a tiny,
plain room. At best, you get comfortable furniture, a homey atmos-
phere, a home-cooked breakfast, and a feel for what it’s like to be
part of a European family.
 Motels: Europe has adopted this American form of modular inn-
keeping, but most travelers don’t know this because — as in the
United States — motels cluster around city outskirts at highway
access points. If you’re doing your travel by car and arriving late,
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 95

these places are a great, cheap lodging option. They’re completely
devoid of character, but they’re often real bargains. Some are even
fully automated so you check yourself in and out.
 Converted castles and other historic buildings: These usually
high-quality lodgings can be outrageously expensive, or they can
be surprisingly cheap state-run operations. (Spain’s paradores are
the best example of the latter.)
 Rental apartments or villas: If you’re planning a long stay in one
location and want to feel like a temporary European, or if you have
a large traveling party (a big family or two families traveling
together), these options are the best.
Rental apartments or villas are easiest to book through a travel
agent or rental consortium, such as Barclay International Group
(% 800-845-6636; www.barclayweb.com), but you can sometimes
get better rates by contacting the owners directly (with addresses
or phone numbers from newspaper travel sections, magazines,
English-language magazines, and tourism boards).
 Apartment or home swaps: Some travelers beat the cost of
European hotels by exchanging their home or apartment with
Europeans for a specified period of time. There are no guarantees
here; it’s up to you to work out the details and take the risks. If 
this option intrigues you, check out the offerings on craigslist
(www.craigslist.com); you may also find short-term apartment
rentals there.
Hostels and other bargain options
If you’re on a severely limited budget, or if you like hanging out with pri-
marily youthful backpackers, you may want to stay in a hostel. They
used to be called youth hostels, but the only ones that still follow the
under-26-only rule are in southern Germany. Most hostels are now open
as cheap digs for travelers of all ages, with nightly rates ranging from
$25 to $50 per person.
Some are affiliated with the official hostel organization, Hostelling
International (or IYH, as it’s known abroad), which means they have to
live up to a certain set of standards. Increasingly, private, unaffiliated
hostels are opening up (often closer to the center of town than the offi-
cial hostel), and although they may not have the IYH stamp of approval,
in some cases they’re actually nicer places.
In a hostel, you stay in beds or bunks in shared, dormlike rooms, though
increasingly hostels are offering private rooms sleeping two to four
people as well. You find anywhere from four to eight beds per room (the
current trend) to as many as 100 beds in one big gymnasium-like space
(this sort of arrangement is slowly disappearing); most hostels have a
mix of different-size rooms at varying prices. Families can usually find
hostels with four-bunk rooms. Many hostels separate the sexes into 
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
96

different rooms or floors and supply lockers for safe bag storage.
Bathrooms are usually shared (but this, too, is changing as more private
rooms are made available), breakfast is often included, and other cheap
but school cafeteria-like meals may be available.
Hostels (especially the official IYH ones) are often far from the city
center, occasionally on the outskirts of town, and they fill up with high-
school students in the summer. Year-round, many seem to be little more
than giant backpacker singles’ bars — great for meeting your fellow trav-
elers, but terrible for getting to know the local city and culture.
Almost all hostels impose evening curfews (usually between 10 p.m. and
midnight), midday lockout periods, and length-of-stay limits (often a
maximum of three days). You may only be able to make reservations
weeks in advance by going online, one day ahead of time by calling, or
not at all, in which case you’ll need to show up early if you want a bed.
To stay in many “official” IYH hostels — or at least to get a discount —
you must be a card-carrying member of Hostelling International, 8401
Colesville Rd., Suite 600, Silver Springs, MD 20910 (% 301-495-1240;
www.hiusa.org). Membership is free for children 17 and under, $28 per
year for adults 18 to 54, and $18 for seniors 55 and older. You can also
buy the card at many hostels abroad. You can find hostel listings on
Hostelling International’s Web site (www.hihostels.com) and at the pri-
vate sites www.hostels.com and www.hostels.net.
Most hostels furnish a blanket but require you to have your own sleep-
sack, which is basically a sleeping bag made out of a sheet. If you plan to
stay in hostels on your trip, buy one (from Hostelling International)
before you leave, or make one (fold a sheet in half and sew it closed
across the bottom and halfway up the side). Some hostels sell sleep-
sacks, and a few insist that you rent one of theirs.
In addition to hostels, several other options exist for low-budget lodging
(ask for details at the tourism office):
 Convents: Especially in predominantly Catholic countries such as
Italy, Spain, and France, staying in convents and other religious
buildings enables you to save money and get an immaculate and
safe room, no matter what your religious affiliation. Rooms in con-
vents, available in many major cities and pilgrimage sites, cost as
little as $15 and generally no more than $100 per night. Your room
probably won’t be any fancier than the cells that the nuns or
monks occupy, but a few are quite posh. Many convents do give
preference to visitors of their own denomination or from that reli-
gious order’s country of origin.
 University housing: During the summer, when school is not in ses-
sion, check with local universities to see whether any unused dorm
rooms are for rent (at rates comparable to hostels). This tip is
especially useful in London during the summer holidays.
Chapter 7: Booking Your Accommodations 97

 Pod hotels: Pod hotels originated in Japan, where space is at a pre-
mium, and they’re now spreading through Europe. The concept is
simple: You rent a private, podlike cabin that contains a bed, light-
ing, a toilet, and a sink, but little else (you may not even have a
window). Pod hotels are a step up from hostels and cost a bit more,
but they represent a new trend in inexpensive European hotels
(cost is generally well under $100 per night); you’ll be seeing more
of them in European cities and airports. Yotel (www.yotel.com) in
London and Qbic Hotel (www.qbichotel.nl) in Amsterdam are
two examples.
 Tent cities: During the height of the summer season, some cities,
including Munich, London, Paris, Venice, and Copenhagen, have
hangarlike rooms or large tents for travelers on an extremely tight
budget. For anywhere from $10 to $25, you get a floor mat and a
blanket, more than 100 roommates, and a cup of tea in the morning.
Most of the people at these giant slumber parties are students, but
the tent cities are open to everyone. Essentially, this is one step
above sleeping on a park bench (which, by the way, is dangerous,
not recommended, and usually illegal).
If you use any type of shared-space lodging, such as hostels or tent
cities, be very careful with your belongings. Always play it safe; leave
your pack in the lockers (if you’re staying in a hostel) or at the train sta-
tion (if you’re staying in another type of communal lodging). For safety
tips on overnight trains, see Chapter 4.

f you’re headed to Europe with a particular interest or concern in
mind, here is the place to look for information. This chapter has
resource information and travel tips for families, seniors, gays and les-
bians, and travelers with disabilities.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have trouble getting your kids out of the house in the morning,
dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an insurmount-
able challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding, giving you
new ways of seeing the world through younger pairs of eyes. Europeans
expect to encounter traveling families, because that’s how they travel.
You’re likely to run into caravanning European clans, including grand-
parents and babes in arms. Locals tend to love kids, especially in
Mediterranean countries. Hotels and restaurants often give you an even
warmer reception if you have a child in tow.
Your best bet for help with small children may be three- and four-star
hotels. The baby sitters on call and a better infrastructure for helping
visitors access the city and its services more than offset the hotels’
higher costs.
Most museums and sights offer reduced prices or free admission for
children under a certain age (anywhere from 6–18), and getting a cot 
in your hotel room won’t cost you more than 30 percent extra, if that.
Always ask about discounts on plane and train tickets for kids, too.

A number of books that offer hints and tips on traveling with kids are
available. Take Your Kids to Europe: How to Travel Safely (and Sanely) in
Europe with Your Children, by Cynthia Harriman (Globe Pequot Press),
offers practical advice based on the author’s four-month trip with her
hubby and two kids. Another worthwhile book is Family Travel &
Resorts, by Pamela Lanier (Lanier Publishing International), which gives
some good general advice that you can apply to travel in the United
States, Europe, and elsewhere. You also may want to check out the reli-
able Adventuring with Children: An Inspirational Guide to World Travel and
the Outdoors, by Nan Jeffrey (Avalon House), which includes specific
advice on dealing with everyday family situations, especially those
involving infants, which can become Herculean labors when you
encounter them on the road.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
such sites as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com),
a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family
Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning
site that offers travel features, deals, and tips; TravelWithYourKids.com
(www.travelwithyourkids.com), another site with trip-planning tools;
and Family Travel Files.com (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com),
which offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-path

tours and tour operators for families. The highly regarded Smithsonian
Study Tours has inaugurated a Family Adventures division (% 877-338-
8687; www.si.edu/tsa/sst) that runs escorted educational and adven-
ture trips specifically designed for the entire clan.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Seniors comprise a huge proportion of transatlantic travelers to Europe.
In general, older travelers in good health won’t encounter any major
problems, but be aware that smaller, less expensive hotels, pensions,
and B&Bs often do not have elevators or porters to carry your luggage.
If climbing stairs or hauling suitcases is difficult, make sure your chosen
hotel has an elevator (it may be called a lift) and porter service. If you’re
a senior traveling on an escorted tour, these issues are all taken care of
for you. And just a reminder: Bring a good pair of walking shoes that will
handle cobblestone streets.
If you’re a senior citizen, you may be eligible for some terrific travel bar-
gains. Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277;
www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels and car rentals. AARP offers
members a wide range of benefits, including AARP: The Magazine and 
a monthly newsletter. You won’t find as many AARP deals in Europe as
you do in the United States, however; generally they’re offered only by
American chains operating in Europe. Anyone over 50 can join AARP.
Avis, Hertz, and National give an AARP discount (5–30 percent), and
many rental dealers that specialize in Europe — Auto Europe, Kemwell,
Europe By Car — offer rates 5 percent lower to seniors. For contact
information, look under “Toll-free numbers and Web sites” in this book’s
Quick Concierge.
Make sure to ask about senior discounts when you book your flight.
People over 60 or 65 also get reduced admission at theaters, museums,
and other attractions in most European cities. Additionally, they can
often get discount fares or cards on public transportation and national
rail systems. Make sure to carry identification that proves your age.
Grand Circle/Overseas Adventure Travel, 347 Congress St., Boston, MA
02210 (% 800-959-0405; www.gct.com), specializes in vacations for sen-
iors (as do hundreds of travel agencies). The tour-bus style of most of
these packages is not for everyone, however. If you’re a senior who
wants a more independent trip, you should probably consult a regular
travel agent.
Many reliable agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market. Give
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056 or 617-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org)
a ring if you want to try something more than the average guided tour 
or vacation. Foreign universities host these trips, and your days are
filled with seminars, lectures, field trips, and sightseeing tours, all led 
Chapter 8: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 101

by academic experts. You must be 55 and older to participate in
Elderhostel (a spouse or companion of any age can accompany you),
and the programs range from one to four weeks.
Road Scholar tours (% 800-466-7762; www.roadscholar.org), an off-
shoot of Elderhostel, is aimed at giving adults (not just seniors) a tour
that combines learning with travel. Resident experts — local professors
and professionals — join the group for on-site talks, culture and lan-
guage lessons, and field trips. There’s freedom in the schedule, though,
allowing you to do a fair amount of exploring on your own.
ElderTreks (% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group
tours to off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to
travelers 50 and older.
Accessing Europe: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
A disability shouldn’t stop anybody from traveling to Europe. Although
access remains an issue in some countries or regions, the major cities
have made an effort in the past few years to accommodate people with
disabilities. More options and resources are out there for the Europe-
bound traveler with disabilities than ever before, including accessible
train cars and public transportation. You’ll find plenty of organizations
to help you plan your trip and provide specific advice before you go.
Organizations that offer assistance or information to travelers with dis-
abilities include MossRehab (% 215-456-9603; www.mossresourcenet.
org), which provides a library of accessible-travel resources online; the
Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (SATH; % 212-447-7284;
www.sath.org), which offers a wealth of travel resources for all types 
of disabilities and informed recommendations on destinations, access
guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehicle rentals, and companion
services; and the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB; % 800-
232-5463; www.afb.org), a referral resource for the blind or visually
impaired that includes information on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs.
The worldwide organization known as Mobility International, P.O. Box
10767, Eugene, OR 97440 (% 541-343-1284 V/TTY; fax: 541-343-6812;
www.miusa.org), promotes international disability rights, provides ref-
erence sheets on travel destinations, and hosts international exchanges
for people with disabilities. Its A World of Options book lists information
on everything from biking trips to scuba outfitters.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive

access information and advice for traveling around the world with dis-
abilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.
accessiblejourneys.com) offers wheelchair travelers and their fami-
lies and friends resources for travel.
Avis Rent A Car has an Avis Access program that offers such services as
a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs; special car features such as swivel seats, spin-
ner knobs, and hand controls; and accessible bus service.

check out the quarterly magazine Emerging Horizons ($16.95 per year,
$21.95 outside the U.S.; www.emerginghorizons.com) and Open World
Magazine, published by SATH ($13 per year, $21 outside the U.S.).
Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Western Europe has led the way when it comes to same-sex issues (gay
couples can be married in Holland and Spain, and civil union provisions
exist in Denmark, England, and Germany). In terms of gay culture, you’ll
find large and active gay communities in all major European cities, espe-
cially London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Many cities have telephone help
lines or walk-in offices for gays and lesbians; some Web research will
help you locate them. In addition, most European cities host gay-pride
events, including a huge yearly Europride festival that moves from city
to city. Check the Web site www.europride.com for a list of cities and
dates.
There is a level of sophistication and acceptance in Europe that has
called to gays and lesbians for decades, and in general you won’t
encounter any problems. Hotels in the European Union, for example,
cannot discriminate against same-sex couples. But do some research on
the city or area you’re planning to visit. As is usually the case, smaller,
more traditional towns are often not as accepting.
Your best all-around resource is the International Gay and Lesbian
Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.
iglta.org), the trade association for the gay and lesbian travel indus-
try. IGLTA offers an online directory of gay- and lesbian-friendly travel
businesses; go to its Web site and click on Members.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay and
lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.
abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour operator
for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.nowvoyager.
com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and -operated
travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or 510-655-
0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships for exclusive

lesbian vacations and offers smaller group experiences for both gay and
lesbian travelers.
Look for gay-specific travel guides at your local travel bookstores, gay
and lesbian bookstores, or online at Giovanni’s Room, 1145 Pine St.,
Philadelphia, PA 19107 (% 215-923-2960; www.giovannisroom.com) or
A Different Light Bookstore (www.adlbooks.com). Gay.com (www.gay.
com) offers guidebooks and travel resources for the global gay and les-
bian scene. StandOut Destinations (www.standoutdestinations.com)
gives a gay perspective to the travel experience, covering not only desti-
nations but also gay-specific travel issues.

esides deciding on an itinerary and booking your flight, what else
do you have to do? This chapter answers questions about obtain-
ing or renewing a passport, deciding whether to purchase additional
insurance, figuring out what to pack, and staying in touch while you’re
away from home.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world; you can’t cross an international border without it. Wherever
you enter Europe, an official stamps your passport with a visa that is
valid for 90 days within the same country. (If you plan to visit longer in
any one country, you can get a specific visa by contacting any of the
country’s consulates in the United States before you leave, or any U.S.
consulate when you’re abroad.)
Getting a passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an 
up-to-date country-by-country listing of passport requirements around
the world, go to the Web site of the U.S. State Department at http://
travel.state.gov and start at “Country Specific Information.”

Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a passport for the first time, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. To find
your regional passport office, check the U.S. State Department Web
site (http://travel.state.gov/passport) or call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778) for automated
information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship. (Bringing
along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social Security
card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 × 2 inches.
You often find businesses near a passport office that take these
photos. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo-vending machine
because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $97. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $82. For expedited service, add $60 per passport
application.
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $67.
Whether you’re applying in person or by mail, you can download pass-
port applications from the U.S. State Department Web site at http://
travel.state.gov/passport. For general information, call the
National Passport Agency (% 202-647-0518). To find your regional
passport office, either check the U.S. State Department Web site or call
the National Passport Information Center toll-free number (% 877-487-
2778) for automated information.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; at press time,
standard processing took four to six weeks; expedited service, which
requires an additional fee, took two weeks. If you use the expedited serv-
ice, it’s also a good idea to arrange overnight delivery (for an extra
charge) to send your passport application and receive your passport.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom:
 Australians can pick up an application from your local post office or
any branch of Passports Australia, but you must schedule an inter-
view at the passport office to present your application materials. Call
the Australian Passport Information Service (% 131-232), or visit
the government Web site (www.passports.gov.au).

 Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-567-
6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Note: Canadian children who travel must
have their own passports.
 Residents of Ireland can apply for a ten-year passport at the
Passport Office, Setanta Centre, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2 
(% 01-671-1633; www.irlgov.ie/iveagh). Those under age 18 and
over 65 must apply for a three-year passport. You can also apply at
1A South Mall, Cork (% 21-494-4700), or at most main post offices.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site.
Contact the Passports Office at % 0800-225-050 in New Zealand 
or 04-474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children 15 and under) 
at passport offices, major post offices, or travel agencies. For infor-
mation, contact the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-
521-0410; www.ukpa.gov.uk).
When you receive your passport, make a photocopy of the first two
pages and bring it with you; it’ll come in handy if, for any reason, you
need to replace a lost or stolen passport.
If you lose your passport while traveling, immediately find the nearest
U.S. embassy or consulate. Bring any forms of identification so that they
can process a new passport for you.
Always carry your passport with you, safely tucked away in your money
belt or in a vest pocket that you can button. Take it out only when neces-
sary, such as at the bank while changing traveler’s checks, for the
guards to verify when crossing borders, or for the train conductor on
overnight journeys by couchette.
European hotels customarily register all guests with the local police.
When you check in to your hotel (particularly in southern Europe), the
desk clerk may ask to keep your passport overnight (to fill out the
paperwork when business is slow). To avoid having your passport get
lost or misplaced, ask the desk clerk to fill out your paperwork while
you wait, or arrange to pick it up in a few hours.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 107

age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking. You can get estimates
from various providers through InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost
and dates, your age, and other information, for prices from more than a
dozen companies. Here is our advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you must go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation 
can range from sickness to natural disasters to the U.S. State
Department declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, a list of travel suppliers
considered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travel
guard.com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance
with a credit card — by law, you can get your money back on goods
and services not received if you report the loss within 60 days after
the charge is listed on your credit-card statement.
Note: Many tour operators, particularly those offering trips to
remote or high-risk areas, include insurance in the cost of the trip
or can arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a
convenient and often cost-effective way for the traveler to obtain
insurance. Make sure the tour company is a reputable one, how-
ever. Some experts suggest that you avoid buying insurance from
the tour or cruise company you’re traveling with, saying you’re
better off buying from a third-party insurer than you are putting 
all your money in one place.
 If you have health coverage at home, buying medical insurance for
your trip doesn’t make sense for most travelers. For travel over-
seas, most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not
provide coverage, and the ones that do often require you to pay for
services up front and reimburse you only after you return home.
Even if your plan does cover overseas treatment, most out-of-
country hospitals make you pay your bills up front, and send you 
a refund only after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary
paperwork with your insurance company. As a safety net, you may
want to buy travel medical insurance, particularly if you’re travel-
ing to a remote or high-risk area where emergency evacuation is a
possible scenario. If you require additional medical insurance, try
MEDEX Assistance (% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or
Travel Assistance International (% 800-821-2828; www.travel
assistance.com).
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per tick-
eted passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions of
international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approximately
$9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you
plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability, find
out if your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s policy or get
baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-insurance
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
108

package. Don’t buy insurance at the airport — it’s usually over-
priced. Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with
you in your carry-on luggage; many valuables (including books,
money, and electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com), Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travel
guard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com), and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy when You Travel
Getting sick on vacation is bad enough, but trying to find a doctor in a
foreign country can add to the stress of being ill. Bring all your medica-
tions with you, as well as an extra prescription in case you run out. Ask
your doctor to write out the generic, chemical form rather than a brand
name to avoid any confusion at foreign pharmacies. And note that it’s
not always possible to bring a U.S. prescription into a European phar-
macy to get it filled; in some countries, you’ll have to find a licensed
doctor to write the prescription for you.
Check with your health-insurance provider to find out the extent of your
coverage outside your home area. For travel abroad, you may have to
pay all medical costs up front and be reimbursed later. For information
on purchasing additional medical insurance for your trip, see the pre-
ceding section.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 109
Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis or, as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and
stretch your legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive
measures include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and
avoiding alcohol and sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart
disease, or another condition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend
wearing compression stockings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask
your physician about the best course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis
include leg pain or swelling, or even shortness of breath.

If you have a serious and/or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before
leaving on a trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298 or
209-669-2450 outside the U.S.; www.medicalert.org), which immedi-
ately alerts doctors to your condition and gives them access to your
records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot line. Contact the International
Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-
4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.iamat.org) for tips on travel 
and health concerns in the countries you’re visiting, and lists of local,
English-speaking doctors. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.gov) provides up-to-date infor-
mation on health hazards by region or country and offers tips on food
safety. If you do get sick, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a
local doctor — even his own doctor, if necessary — or contact the local
U.S. embassy for a list of English-speaking doctors. If a situation requir-
ing emergency medical assistance arises while you’re traveling, call for
an ambulance; emergency numbers are listed in the “Fast Facts” section
at the end of each destination chapter in this book.
Dealing with European Healthcare
Europeans often rely on their local pharmacist to treat their ailments. So
even if you don’t speak the language, just walk up to the counter, groan,
and point to whatever hurts.
If your condition requires further medical attention, you can visit any
European hospital. (Don’t worry: Most hospitals have English-speaking
doctors.) Many European countries practice semi- or fully socialized
medicine, so they may send you on your way with a prescription and a
small medical bill.
If you must pay for healthcare, especially overnight care or other costly
procedures, most health-insurance plans and HMOs foot some of the
bill. Many plans require you to pay the expenses up front but reimburse
you when you get back. (Save your hospital receipt; you need it to fill
out claim forms.) Members of Blue Cross/Blue Shield can use their
cards at certain hospitals in most major cities worldwide, which means
lower out-of-pocket costs. For more information, call % 800-810-BLUE
(800-810-2583) or go to www.bluecares.com for a list of participating
hospitals.
Making Reservations for Popular 
Restaurants, Events, and Sights
If you want to be certain that you’ll get tickets for special events or per-
formances (the opera, a symphony concert, seasonal festivals), a reser-
vation at a special restaurant, or admission to an extraordinary museum,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
110

think about booking these activities before you leave (or at least a few
days ahead while on the road).
Top restaurants in Paris, London, and other major cities can have wait-
ing lists up to two or three weeks long. Often, you can call the day before
(or the day of) your planned dinner and get a reservation, but you may
want to call further ahead to ensure a table at restaurants with hot,
haute reputations.
Increase your chances of landing a table at a coveted eatery by reserv-
ing for lunch rather than the more popular dinner hour. Also, while trav-
eling, you may want to reserve dinners at special restaurants a day or so
ahead of time if missing a meal there would be a big disappointment.
If you want to make sure that you see a special musical or play in 
the West End, the Vienna Boys Choir, an opera at the ancient Roman
amphitheater in Verona (or at any of Europe’s opera houses), a sym-
phony concert with a famous orchestra, or Shakespeare at the Globe,
reserve your tickets several weeks before you leave. Call the box office
direct, book at the theater’s Web site (which allows you to peruse the
schedule and pick your performance), or contact the local tourist office.
Expect to pay a small service charge.
You can also contact a ticketing agency such as Keith Prowse (the U.K.,
France, Italy, Czech Republic, Austria, and Ireland; % 800-669-8687;
www.keithprowse.com), Edwards & Edwards/Global Tickets (all of
Europe; % 800-223-6108), or Tickets.com (the U.K., the Netherlands,
Germany, Ireland, and Belgium).
If you don’t have time before you leave, try to reserve tickets when you
first arrive in town. To find out what’s playing, pick up the local events
magazine — such as Time Out in London or Pariscope in Paris — at a
newsstand.
At several museums and sights across Europe (especially in Italy), you
can call ahead and reserve an entry time. This feature can save you
hours of standing in line at popular places such as Florence’s Uffizi and
Rome’s Galleria Borghese (where reservations are mandatory and sell
out weeks ahead of time).
Sights worth reserving ahead for are the Lipizzaner Horse Show in
Vienna, the Galleria Borghese and Papal Audiences in Rome, the Uffizi
Galleries and the Accademia (Michelangelo’s David) in Florence, the
Secret Itineraries tour of the Doge’s Palace in Venice, Buckingham Palace
and the Houses of Parliament summer tours in London, and the Military
Tattoo at Edinburgh Castle in Scotland.
Even if a museum or sight does not offer advance booking, you may still
be able to skip to the head of the line by buying a special attractions
pass at the city’s tourist office; the Paris Museum Pass, for example,
allows you immediate entry at dozens of museums with no waiting.

Packing It Up
Here’s a helpful packing suggestion: Take everything you think you need
and lay it out on the bed. Now get rid of half. You’ll have a better trip,
and be more mobile, if you carry less.
So what are the bare essentials? Comfortable walking shoes, a camera, a
versatile sweater and/or jacket, an all-purpose coat or windbreaker, a
belt, toiletries, medications (pack these in your carry-on bag), and some-
thing to sleep in. Unless you attend a board meeting, a funeral, or one of
the city’s finest restaurants, you don’t need a dress suit or a fancy dress.
For everyday wear, you can rely on a pair of jeans or comfortable
trousers and a sweater or pullover.
Put things that may leak, like shampoo and suntan lotion, in zippered
plastic bags. Finally, put a distinctive identification tag on the outside so
your bag is easy to spot on the luggage carousel.
Dressing as the locals do
Over the past couple of decades, a kind of universal, homogenous,
brand-name fashion consciousness has erased many of the differences
between younger Europeans and their American counterparts. If it’s cool
at home, it’ll probably be considered cool in Europe. Older and more
sophisticated Europeans, however, are still known for their savvy fash-
ion sense. In Europe, even casual can be pretty chic.
Of course, comfort is essential, but you may feel more at ease if you look
less like a tourist. Leave the silly garments at home (you know what they
are) and pack a sensible, sporty outfit. If you’re bringing only one pair of
shoes, make sure they’re comfortable and all-purpose enough so that
you can wear them to restaurants and dressier spots. Nothing gives
away the American traveler faster than running shoes worn for every
occasion. In some classier restaurants, you may encounter a “smart
casual” dress code, which means that no jeans or running shoes are
allowed and that men must wear a jacket (sometimes a tie as well).
Europe in general is becoming more casual about clothing, but dressing
up for a special occasion or an evening out remains an important part of
European life.
If your travel plans include visiting churches and cathedrals, keep in
mind that some adhere to strict dress codes. St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome,
for example, turns people away who show too much skin. Plan ahead:
Wear shorts or skirts that fall past the knee and shirts that cover your
shoulders. During warmer seasons, layer a shirt over or under a sleeve-
less jumper, and in cooler temperatures, an oversize scarf can substitute
for a wrap — a very chic look! Men, please leave behind the sleeveless 
T-shirts.

Sporting money belts
Many travelers like to tote their most important documents, such as
plane tickets, rail passes, traveler’s checks, credit cards, driver’s license,
and passport, in a money belt.
Money belts are flat pouches worn under clothing. You can choose from
three kinds: one that dangles from your neck; one that fastens around
your waist, over your shirttails but under your pants (larger and more
safely concealed, but less comfortable); and one that sways by your
pants leg, attached to your belt by a loop.
Don’t take any keys except your house key and leave behind any unnec-
essary wallet items (department-store and gas-station credit cards,
library cards, and so on).
Traveling without electronics
Electronics take up valuable luggage space, waste too much time, and
blow hotel fuses. And you spend way too much time worrying about
losing them or having them ripped off. In other words, leave them at
home. Open your eyes and ears to Europe’s sights and sounds! Take a
small battery-operated alarm clock and maybe a small camera — and
that’s it.
If you’re determined to lug around half of an electronics store, consider
the following: American current runs on 110V and 60 cycles, and
European current runs on 210V to 220V and 50 cycles. Don’t expect to
plug an American appliance into a European outlet without harming
your appliance or blowing a fuse. You need a currency converter or
transformer to decrease the voltage and increase the cycles.
You can find plug adapters and converters at most travel, luggage, elec-
tronics, and hardware stores.
Travel-size versions of popular items such as irons, hair dryers, shavers,
and so on come with dual voltage, which means they have built-in con-
verters (usually you must turn a switch to go back and forth). Most con-
temporary camcorders and laptop computers automatically sense the
current and adapt accordingly — be sure to check the manuals, the
bottom of the machine, or with the manufacturer to make sure you don’t
fry your appliance.
Mastering Communication
This section helps you figure out how to call another country — for
example, in case you need to make advance reservations or book a hotel
before you leave — and how to stay in touch while you’re away from
home.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 113

Calling Europe from the United States
When calling Europe from the United States, you must first dial the inter-
national access code (011), then the country code, and then (some-
times) the city code (usually dropping the initial 0, or in Spain’s case,
the initial 9). Country and city codes are listed in the “Fast Facts” sec-
tion of each destination chapter in this book.
Only when you’re calling a city from another area within the same coun-
try do you dial the initial 0 (or 9).
Many countries (France, Italy, and Spain, among others) are now incor-
porating the separate city codes into the numbers themselves. In some
cases, you still drop the initial 0; in others you do not. If all this seems
confusing, don’t worry: The rules for dialing each city are included in
the destination chapters in this book.
Calling home from Europe
No matter which calling method you choose, overseas phone rates are
costly. But some money pits are avoidable. For example, never make a
transatlantic call from your hotel room, unless you can spare lots of
cash. Surcharges tacked onto your hotel bill can amount to a whopping
400 percent over what you pay if you make the call from a public pay
phone. Most hotels even overcharge for local calls. Just ignore the
phone in your hotel room; look for one in a nearby bar or cafe instead.
Using a calling card is the simplest and most inexpensive way to call
home from overseas. (Some credit cards even double as calling cards.)
You just dial a local number — which is usually free, but keep in mind
that some hotels will charge you for it — and then punch in the number
you’re calling plus the calling-card number (often your home phone
number plus a four-digit PIN). The card comes with a wallet-size list of
local access numbers in each country (these numbers are listed in the
“Fast Facts” section of each destination chapter in this book). Before
leaving home, set up a calling-card account with AT&T, MCI, or Sprint. If
you’re calling from a non-touch-tone country such as Italy, just wait for
an American operator, who will put your call through, or for the auto-
mated system in which you speak your card’s numbers out loud.
To make a collect call, dial a phone company’s number and wait for the
operator.
Phone companies offer a range of calling-card programs. When you set
up an account, tell the representative that you want the program and
card most appropriate for making multiple calls from Europe to the
United States.
Calling from the United States to Europe is often much cheaper than the
other way around, so you may want to ask friends and family to call you
at your hotel instead of you calling them. If you must dial direct from
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
114

Europe to the United States, first dial the international access code
(often, but not always, 00), and then the country code for the United
States (which is 1). After that 001, just punch in the area code and
number as usual.
Using European pay phones
European and North American pay phones operate similarly. You’ll find
three types of phones in Europe: coin-operated, phone-card only (most
common), and a hybrid of the two. Phone-card units are quickly replac-
ing coin-operated phones all over the Continent.
Slide the phone card into the phone as you would an ATM card at a cash
machine. You can buy prepaid cards in increments equivalent to as little
as $2 or as much as $30, depending on the country. Single-country
phone cards come in handy only if you plan on staying for a while or if
you want to make direct long-distance calls. If you’re visiting for only a
few days and expect to make mainly local calls, just use pocket change
or a smaller-increment prepaid card.
Calling cards (described in the preceding section) have made phoning
North America from Europe cheap and easy from any pay phone, but
some traditionalists still prefer heading to the post office or interna-
tional phone office, where you make your call on a phone with a meter
and then pay when you’re done. This method is no cheaper than direct
dialing from a pay phone, but at least you don’t need to worry about
remembering a bunch of numbers to get through.
Staying connected by cellphone
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile and AT&T
Wireless use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Fido and some
Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians 
use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone (Sony, Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung all make models
with this capability), you can make and receive calls across much of the
globe. Just call your wireless operator and ask for international roaming
to be activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can
be high, usually $1 to $1.50 in Western Europe.
That’s why buying an “unlocked” world phone is important. Many cell-
phone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you from using any
removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM card) other than
the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows you to install a
cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in your destination
country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones work on
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 115

all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number and much, much lower
calling rates. Getting an already locked phone unlocked can be a compli-
cated process, but it can be done; just call your cellular operator and
say you’ll be going abroad for several months and want to use the phone
with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. Although you can rent a phone
from any number of overseas sites — including kiosks at airports — we
suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way you can give
loved ones and business associates your new number, make sure the
phone works, and take the phone wherever you go. This option is espe-
cially helpful for overseas trips through several countries, where local
phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and may not let you
take the phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus 
airtime fees of at least a dollar a minute. If you’re traveling to Europe,
though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls within
their home country, which can save you big bucks. The bottom line:
Shop around.
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-872-7626)
and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
You may find cheaper rates by renting through one of the big car-rental
agencies, such as AutoEurope (www.autoeurope.com) or Avis (www.
avis.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll tell you what wireless
products you need. InTouch will also, for free, advise you on whether
your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to http://intouchglobal.com/
travel.htm.
Accessing the Internet in Europe
Travelers in Europe have any number of ways to check their e-mail and
access the Internet while on the road. Of course, using your own laptop —
or even a personal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a
modem — gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a com-
puter, you can still access your e-mail and even your office computer from
cybercafes.
Nowadays, finding a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes is difficult.
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists, two places to
start looking are www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer you can use to access the Internet, and most public
libraries across the world offer Internet access free or for a small
charge. Inexpensive hotels often have an Internet terminal in the lobby
that you can use for free or pretty cheaply, but avoid business centers in
the pricier hotels or in international chain properties, unless you’re will-
ing to pay exorbitant rates.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
116

Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gate areas. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in tourist informa-
tion offices, give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually
higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high price
mean they should be avoided whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com) or Microsoft’s Hotmail (www.
hotmail.com). Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to the
Web-based account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is turned on 
and has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with a cable
modem or DSL). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re
worried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe
computer to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer, which is frankly a hassle on a
pleasure trip, Wi-Fi hot spots in hotels, cafes, and retailers provide high-
speed connection without cable wires, networking hardware, or a phone
line. You can get Wi-Fi connection one of several ways. Many laptops
sold today have built-in Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet
connection). Mac owners have their own networking technology, Apple
AirPort. For those with older computers, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card can be
plugged into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops, primarily in the U.S. (followed by the U.K. and Japan).
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers
also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby setups. Best
of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s
network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The compa-
nies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-
connection, and per-minute plans, but in general you pay around $30 a
month for limited access — and as more and more companies jump on
the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
There are also places that provide free wireless networks in cities around
the world. To locate these free hot spots, go to http://wiki.personal
telco.net/WirelessCommunities.
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 117

If Wi-Fi is not available in your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout the world offer dataports for laptop modems, and many
hotels in Europe now offer free high-speed Internet access using an
Ethernet network cable. You can bring your own cables (another
hassle), but most hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in
advance to find out your options.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home, and how much it’ll cost. If you’re travel-
ing outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers
in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass
provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for each of
your destinations. For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com
and click on Individual Purchase. One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-
811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out if your hotel supplies them to guests. European phone-jack con-
verters and line testers are available from some travel and electronics
stores and from catalogs such as Magellan’s (www.magellans.com) or
TravelSmith (www.travelsmith.com). Many European phone lines use
the pulse system rather than touch-tone, so you may need to configure
your dial-up software settings to cope.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports have generally become more stable and consistent. Generally,
you’ll be fine if you arrive at the airport at least two hours before an
international flight.
Obviously, bring your passport. Be prepared to show it several times —
to airline employees asking security questions, to the clerks checking
you in, to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials at
the security checkpoint, and, on Europe-bound flights, to the gate atten-
dants before you board the aircraft.
Many travelers have grown accustomed to paperless E-tickets, curbside
luggage check-in, timesaving kiosks, and even checking in for flights
online. But when you’re flying internationally, you’re still required to
wait in line for check-in, answer security questions, show your passport,
and then proceed to the security checkpoint with your boarding pass
and photo ID.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter, but some doozies remain.
If you have trouble standing for long periods of time, tell an airline
employee; the airline will provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Europe 
118

wearing metal objects such as big belt buckles or oversized jewelry. If
you have metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can prevent a
long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only ticketed
passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting passen-
gers or children with disabilities.
Federalization has standardized what you can carry through security
and what you can’t. The general rule is that sharp objects and bottled
water are out, and nail clippers are okay. Any liquids or gels must be in a
small container (3.4 ounces or less) and placed in a see-through quart-
size plastic bag, which is put separately through the scanner. (After
you’ve passed through security, you can buy bottled water and bring it
on the plane.) Food and beverages you bring with you to the airport
(rather than those purchased beyond the initial security screening
checkpoints) must be passed through the X-ray machine. Travelers are
generally allowed one carry-on bag, plus one personal item such as a
purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of
things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still consid-
ered a personal item. The TSA has issued a list of restricted items; check
its Web site (www.tsa.gov) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. Although the TSA recommends that you do not lock
your checked luggage (because, if they search it, they have to break the
locks), you can now purchase TSA-approved locks (also called Travel
Sentry–certified and marked with a red diamond logo), which agents are
able to unlock with a special key and secret combination. Check www.
tsa.gov for a list of approved locks and the retailers who sell them. For
more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.
Bringing Your Goodies Back Home
You can take your European goodies home with you, but restrictions
exist for how much you can bring back for free. If you go over a certain
amount, Customs officials impose taxes.
The personal exemption rule (how much you can bring back into the
United States without paying a duty on it) is $800 worth of goods per
person. On the first $1,000 worth of goods over $800, you pay a flat 3 per-
cent duty. Beyond that, it works on an item-by-item basis. There are a few
restrictions on amount: 1 liter of alcohol (you must be 21 or over), 200
cigarettes, and 100 cigars. Antiques more than 100 years old and works of
fine art are exempt from the $800 limit, as is anything you mail home.
You can mail yourself $200 worth of goods duty-free once a day; mark the
package “For Personal Use.” You can also mail gifts to other people with-
out paying duty as long as the recipient doesn’t receive more than $100
worth of gifts in a single day. Label each gift package “Unsolicited Gift.”
Any package must state on the exterior a description of the contents and
Chapter 9: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 119

their values. You can’t mail alcohol, perfume (it contains alcohol), or
tobacco products worth more than $5.
Items bought at a duty-free shop before returning to the United States
still count toward your U.S. Customs limit. The “duty” that you’re avoid-
ing in these shops is the local tax on the item (such as state sales tax in
the United States), not any import duty that may be levied by the U.S.
Customs office.
If you need more information or would like to see a list of specific items
you can’t bring into the United States, check out the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection Web site (www.cbp.gov).
The following list outlines a few items for residents of Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand.
 Canada allows its residents of legal age a C$750 exemption, and
you’re allowed to bring back duty-free 200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of
tobacco, 40 imperial ounces of liquor, and 50 cigars. In addition,
you’re allowed to mail gifts to Canada from abroad at the rate of
C$60 a day, provided they’re unsolicited and don’t contain alcohol
or tobacco (write on the package “Unsolicited gift, under $60
value”). Note: The C$750 exemption can be used only once a year
and only after an absence of seven days. For a clear summary of
Canadian rules, write for the booklet I Declare, issued by the
Canada Border Services Agency, 2265 St. Laurent Blvd., Ottawa,
ON K1G 4KE (% 800-461-9999 or 204-983-3500; www.cbsa-asfc.
gc.ca).
 The duty-free allowance in Australia is A$900 or, for those 17 and
under, A$450. Citizens 18 and older can bring in 250 cigarettes or
250 grams of loose tobacco and 2.25 liters of alcohol. A helpful
brochure available from Australian consulates or Customs offices 
is Know Before You Go. For more information, call the Australian
Customs Service at % 1300-363-263, or log on to www.customs.
gov.au.
 The duty-free allowance for New Zealand is NZ$700. Citizens 18 
and over can bring in 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars or 250 grams of
tobacco (or a mixture of all three if their combined weight does not
exceed 250 grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine and beer or 1.125 liters 
of liquor. New Zealand currency does not carry import or export
restrictions. Most questions are answered in a free pamphlet avail-
able at New Zealand consulates and Customs offices: New Zealand
Customs Guide for Travellers, Notice no. 4. For more information,

Part III
The British Isles

In this part . . .
A
visit to the British Isles makes for a memorable, adven-
turous stop on any European vacation. London, the cap-
ital of the U.K., is considered by many to be the most exciting
city in Europe, ﬁlled with an inexhaustible array of charms
and attractions. From London, it’s easy to make fascinating
day trips to other parts of England, including Bath, Oxford,
and the perennially mysterious ancient stones of Stonehenge.
Farther north, in scenic Scotland, you can explore Edinburgh,
hike the heather-clad highlands, and go “Nessie” hunting on
Loch Ness. To the west, charming Ireland beckons, offering
cosmopolitan pleasures in Dublin and some of the most glori-
ous scenery in the world.

T
he wondrous city of London is home to Buckingham Palace and Big
Ben, the Tower of London and the Crown Jewels, Westminster Abbey
and St. Paul’s Cathedral, Piccadilly Circus and the British Museum.
That’s just the beginning of what you can see and do in this huge, hap-
pening city on the Thames. Spend the evening at the latest West End
play, attend an opera or symphony, dance until dawn at the hippest
clubs, and have a pint in the same pubs where Charles Dickens hung
out. And if that’s not enough, you have the River Thames to cruise, the
Tate Modern to peruse, and all the shopping you’re up for. London also
has some of the world’s foremost museums, including exhaustive collec-
tions of historical artifacts, paintings, and antiquities, and a stunning
array of parks and architectural treasures.
Anything less than three days in London is simply not enough time to
appreciate all that’s here; four or five days is more reasonable. With this
chapter, no matter how many days you have, you can begin to plan your
explorations of what many consider to be the most exciting city in
Europe.
Getting There
Air travel is the most convenient option for getting to London, although
if you’re coming from the Continent you can always hop a ferry or take
the super-fast Eurostar train from Paris or Brussels through the Channel
Tunnel (Chunnel for short).

Arriving by air
Transatlantic flights usually land west of the city at Heathrow Airport
(% 0870-000-0123; www.heathrowairport.com). From Heathrow, you
can take a 15-minute ride on the Heathrow Express train (% 0845-
600-1515; www.heathrowexpress.com), with departures every 15 min-
utes to London’s Paddington Station. One-way standard-class fare is £15
($30); you can buy tickets at the airport (machines and ticket windows)
or, for a £3 ($6) extra charge, on the train. Another option is a leisurely
50-minute Underground ride on the Piccadilly Line, which runs through
the center of town and may drop you off at a more convenient point
closer to your hotel. One-way fare to Paddington Station is £4 ($8).
Some flights (especially from the Continent) and charter planes land at
Gatwick Airport (% 0870-000-2468; www.gatwickairport.com), 48km
(30 miles) south of London and a 30-minute ride (£17/$34 one-way) on
the Gatwick Express to London’s Victoria Station (% 0845-850-1530;
www.gatwickexpress.com), or at London Stansted Airport (% 0870-
000-0303; www.stanstedairport.com), 56km (35 miles) northeast of
town and a 45-minute ride (£15/$30 one-way) to London’s Liverpool Street
Station on the Stansted Express (% 0845-850-0150; www.stansted
express.com).
Some flights from Britain and northern Europe land at London City
Airport (% 020-7646-0000; www.londoncityairport.com), 14km 
(9 miles) east of the center. The Docklands Light Railway takes you into
central London (about 20 minutes). A one-way fare is £4 ($8). EasyJet
and other no-frills/low-cost European airlines are making little London
Luton Airport (% 01582-405-100; www.london-luton.co.uk), 48km
(30 miles) northwest of the city, a busy hub for budget flights from other
parts of Britain and the Continent. From Luton Airport, take the free
shuttle bus (eight minutes) to Luton’s rail station and connect to a train
(30 minutes) to London’s King’s Cross Station or next-door neighbor St.
Pancras Station; one-way fares are £11 to £17 ($22–$34).
Arriving by rail
Trains coming from Dover (where ferries from the Continent land) arrive
at either Victoria Station or Charing Cross Station, both in the center of
town (101⁄2 hours total travel time from Paris via the ferry route).
The direct Eurostar trains (www.eurostar.com) that arrive from Paris
and Brussels via the Channel Tunnel (a trip of three hours — two after
you factor in the time change) pull into the newly refurbished St.
Pancras International Station in the northern part of Central London. If
you’re coming from Edinburgh, you arrive at King’s Cross Station, also
in the northern part of the city.

Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 125
Orienting Yourself in London
London is a huge, sprawling city with over 7.5 million residents. Urban
expansion has been going on around London for centuries, and the 1,601
sq. km (618 sq. miles) of Greater London consist of many small towns
and villages that have been incorporated over time. Officially, 33 bor-
oughs divide London, but most of its residents still use traditional neigh-
borhood names, which we do as well in this guide.

Most of Central London lies north of the Thames River and is more or
less bounded by the Circle Line Tube route. Central London, where
you’ll find most of the must-see attractions, is divided into The City and
the West End. Several performing arts venues and the megapopular Tate
Modern sit on the South Bank, right on the Thames.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Located on what now is the eastern edge of London’s center, The City is
the ancient square mile where the Romans founded the original settle-
ment of Londinium. This area is home to St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower
of London, world financial institutions, and Fleet Street, the one-time
center of newspaper publishing.
The West End is much larger and harder to classify. This lively center of
London’s shopping, restaurant, nightlife, and museum scene includes
many neighborhoods.
One old West End neighborhood, Holborn, lies alongside The City and is
filled with the offices of lawyers and other professionals. North of this
district, the British Museum and the University of London lend a literary,
academic feel to Bloomsbury. West of Bloomsbury, Fitzrovia is an old
writer’s hangout with shops and pubs that fade into Soho to the south.
Farther to the west, the area called Marylebone attracts visitors to
Madame Tussaud’s and the stamping grounds of the fictional Sherlock
Holmes.
The areas below Bloomsbury get livelier. Covent Garden and the Strand
comprise an upscale restaurant, entertainment, and shopping quarter.
To the west, Soho, once a seedy red-light district, is cleaned up and con-
tains numerous eateries and nightclubs, as well as London’s Chinatown.
To the south is Piccadilly Circus/Leicester Square, where you find the
bulk of London’s theaters; lots of crowded pubs, bars, and commercial
clubs; the biggest movie houses; and Piccadilly Circus, which is a
swirling square of traffic with a statue of Eros in its center and neon-
faced superstores all around.
Southwest of Piccadilly Circus are the old, exclusive residential streets
of St. James’s (imagine an old gentlemen’s club and expand it several
blocks in each direction). Northwest of St. James’s (and west of Soho) 
is fashionable Mayfair, which is full of pricey hotels and tony restau-
rants. Westminster, running along the western bank of the Thames’s
north–south stretch, is the heart and soul of political Britain, home to
Parliament and Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II’s London home.
Westminster flows into Victoria to the south. Centered on Victoria train
station, this neighborhood remains genteel and residential, but has lots
of B&Bs and small hotels. Northwest of Victoria and west of Westminster
is Belgravia, an old aristocratic zone full of stylish town houses that’s
just beyond the West End.
Part III: The British Isles 
126

West of the West End, the neighborhoods are divided north–south 
by enormous Hyde Park. South of Hyde Park stretch the uniformly fash-
ionable residential zones of Knightsbridge, Kensington, and South
Kensington, which are also home to London’s grandest shopping streets.
(Harrods department store is in Knightsbridge.) South of Belgravia and
South Kensington is the artists’ and writers’ quarter of Chelsea, which
manages to keep hip with the changing times — Chelsea’s King’s Road is
where miniskirts debuted in the 1960s and punk in the 1970s.
North of Hyde Park are the more middle-income residential neighbor-
hoods of Paddington, Bayswater, and Notting Hill, popular among
budget travelers for their abundance of bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs) and
inexpensive hotels. Nearby Notting Hill Gate has become a hip fashion
and dining center in its own right.
On the other side of the Thames is Southwark (Suh-thuk) — where
tourism has recently exploded, thanks to the opening of Shakespeare’s
Globe Theatre, the Tate Modern (connected to St. Paul’s Cathedral and
The City by the elegant pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge), and an
assortment of lesser sights. It’s also an arts and cultural center, with
major performance venues such as Royal Festival Hall and the National
Theatre.
On a first-time or quick visit, you probably won’t venture too far beyond
this huge area of central London. If you do, the most likely candidates
are the revitalized Docklands, a major housing and business develop-
ment of the 1980s, or the East End, part of the real, working class of
London and home to many recent immigrants, but becoming trendier by
the day.
If you’re exploring London to any extent, one of your most useful pur-
chases will be “London A to Z,” one of the world’s greatest street-by-
street maps. This publication is the only one that lists every tiny alley
and dead-end lane of the maze that is London. You can buy one at any
bookstore and most newsstands. (Z, by the way, is pronounced “zed.”)
Finding information after you arrive
London’s tourist office (see the “Fast Facts: London” section at the end
of this chapter) will provide useful information, as will a copy of Time
Out: London, sold at any newsstand.
The London Information Centre (% 020-7292-2333; www.london
informationcentre.com), smack-dab in the middle of Leicester Square
right next to the TKTS booth, offers a free London map and general
information to visitors, including a hotel booking service. Like the
square, the info center is open late — from 8 a.m. to midnight seven
days a week.
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 127

Getting Around London
The city of London is too spread out for you to rely solely on your feet to
get from here to there. Driving in the city is a nightmare, and taxis are
pretty expensive. Fortunately, London has an extensive public trans-
portation system. At any Tube station or tourist center, pick up a copy
of the map/pamphlet “Tube & Bus,” which outlines the major bus routes
and includes a copy of the Tube map. For information on all London
public-transport options (Tube, buses, light rail) call Transport for
London at % 020-7222-1234, or visit www.tfl.gov.uk.
You can hop aboard London’s buses, the Tube, and light rail systems
with the Travelcard (in this section we just discuss “off-peak” prices,
which are valid after 9:30 a.m. Mon–Fri and any time weekends and
public holidays). You buy tickets according to how many zones you’ll
need to ride through. Zone 1 covers all of Central London and all the
major attractions you want to see on an average visit; zone 2 is the next
concentric ring out, getting in most of the outlying attractions. Charts
posted in Tube stations help you figure out in which zones you’ll be 
traveling.
By Tube (subway)
The quickest and most popular way to get around town is by London’s
subway system, known locally as the Tube or the Underground. The
Underground is a complex network of lines and interchanges that make
getting anywhere in London easy. For travel time, count on an average of
three minutes between Tube stops. You can pick up a free Tube map in
any station, or see the inside back cover of this book.
You can buy tickets from machines (they take coins and £5, £10, and £20
notes) or manned booths in Tube stations. A single ticket in zones 1 to 6
costs £4 ($8) adults. Children 5 to 10 ride for free on the Tube when
accompanied by an adult with a valid ticket, and 11- to 18-year-olds and
students can get discounted tickets if they have an Oyster card (see the
nearby box, “Travel fast and cheap by Oyster”).
Paying a full-price one-way fare every time you use the Underground is
prohibitively expensive. To save money, consider buying a Travelcard or
the new Oyster card, about the size of a credit card and easy to use —
you just touch it over an electronic reader pad when entering and leaving
an Underground station or a bus. Not only will you save money with
either option, but you’ll enjoy the freedom of nipping around London
without worrying about paying each time you step onto a bus or the
Underground. A Day Travelcard, valid in zones 1 and 2, costs £5.50 ($11)
adults and £3.40 ($6.80) children. Three-day Travelcards covering zones 1
and 2 cost £17 ($34) adults and £8.70 ($17) children.
Part III: The British Isles 
128

By bus
Although you can use the Tube and its many transfer stations to tunnel
your way just about anywhere in London, we suggest you ride the bus a
few times — but not during rush hour — because riding the bus gives you
a much better feel for the city layout than when you travel underground.
Bus-stop signs with a red slashed circle on white are compulsory stops,
so you just wait and the bus will stop for you; if the slashed circle is
white on red, you’re at a request stop, and you have to wave down 
the bus.
The bus system in London is changing — and, sadly, that includes replac-
ing the famous double-decker buses with ones that are twice as long and
bend in the middle — although the “heritage” double-deckers continue to
operate on some routes in Central London. You may also encounter new
energy-efficient hydro-powered buses. On older buses, you just board the
bus and — if you don’t have a Travelcard — pay the conductor cash.
However, on newer, Pay Before You Board (PBYB) lines — distinguishable
by the fact that the route numbers have a yellow background on bus-stop
signs — you must either have a Travelcard or buy a ticket from a machine
before you board (all bus lines that have become PBYB have ticket
machines at each stop).
Either way, a regular ride costs £2 ($4) adults, free for children 16 and
under (with valid ID). One-day bus passes are available for £3.50 ($7)
adults; weekly passes are £13 ($26) adults.
By taxi
London’s Tube and buses can get you around town nicely, but you can
also opt for a ride in one of London’s fabled and incredibly spacious
black cabs. The drivers are highly trained and experienced, and also
incredibly knowledgeable about London information. In fact, many
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 129
Travel fast and cheap by Oyster
The new Oyster card entitles Londoners to all sorts of travel discounts, but London
visitors can benefit, too. You can buy an Oyster (at any ticket window) and put up to
£90 ($180) in credit on it. With the Oyster, you automatically get substantial discounts
every time you travel. The cost of a trip on the Underground, for instance, drops from
£4 ($8) to £1.50 ($3), and a bus fare from £2 ($4) to 90p ($1.80). What’s more, the daily
amount you spend is automatically capped, so no matter how much you travel, you
spend less than you would with a Travelcard: For example, the Oyster cap for travel all
day in zones 1 and 2 is £6.30 ($13), compared to the £6.80 ($14) you pay for a peak Day
Travelcard valid for travel in these zones.

people use these drivers as auxiliary city guides, asking them for infor-
mation as they ride. Prices, however, are far from a bargain. Fares
change depending on the time of day, speed, and distance traveled.
Fares and any extra charges are displayed on the meter next to the
driver. Hail a taxi on the street or find one at a taxi rank (stand) outside
major rail stations, hotels, department stores, and museums. To call for
a taxi (an extra £2/$4 charge), dial % 020-7272-0272, 020-7253-5000, or
020-7432-1432. Take note, though: The meter begins running as soon as
the driver picks up the call. For more info, visit www.tfl.gov.uk/pco.
The basic taxi fare begins at £2.20 ($4.40) and rises in increments of 20p
(40¢) every 160m (525 ft.) or 34.5 seconds. Tip your cabbie 10 percent to
15 percent of the total fare.
Minicabs are meterless taxis that operate out of offices rather than driv-
ing the streets for fares. Minicabs are more useful at night when the
Tube stops running and fewer regular taxis are available. Make sure you
get one that is licensed by the Public Carriage Office (indicated by a
sticker in the window with the diamond-shaped LICENSED PRIVATE HIRE VEHI-
CLE hologram). Negotiate the fare before you get into the minicab. You
can find minicab stands in popular spots, such as Leicester Square, or
call the numbers in the preceding paragraph. Women may prefer Lady
Cabs, with only women drivers (% 020-7254-3501).
By foot
London sprawls, and what appears to be a short jaunt may actually be
an epic trek. There are, however, pleasant walks throughout the city. Try
out the new Millennium Bridge between St. Paul’s and the Tate Modern
in Southwark, the colorful back streets of Soho, or the pedestrian-only
riverside walk along the South Bank.
Staying in London
Hotel rates in London come at premium prices, especially when com-
pared to other large European cities. To avoid exorbitant room rates,
your best bet is to find a B&B or small hotel offering low(er) rates. You
may not sleep in luxury, but you’ll be able to afford the rest of your trip.
Many hotels offer weekend breaks or special seasonal discounts that
can get you 20 percent to 50 percent off a room. Always check the
hotel’s Web site for special offers, and refer to Chapter 8 for more
money-saving tips on finding the best hotel rate.
The two best hotel booking services are run by the Visit London tourist
board (% 08456-443-010 or 020-7932-2020; www.visitlondonoffers.
com) and the private LondonTown (% 020-7437-4370; www.london
town.com). Both offer discounted rooms.
Part III: The British Isles 
130

Britain sports two types of bed-and-breakfasts these days: the old pen-
sion-type inn — often worn about the edges, and pretty hit-or-miss, but
costing from about £45 ($90) per person — and the upscale private-home
type of B&Bs that burgeoned in the 1990s (at rates from £80/$160 on up
per person, £95/$190 for double occupancy). The place to find the cream
of the crop among the latter type is the Bulldog Club (% 0870-803-4414;
www.bulldogclub.com), a reservation service that lists tasteful private-
home accommodations throughout London and the U.K. Not quite 
as exclusive, but still representing upscale B&Bs and apartments, is
Uptown Reservations (% 020-7937-2001; www.uptownres.co.uk). Solid
midrange agencies include London Homestead Services (% 020-7286-
5155; www.lhslondon.co.uk), London Bed & Breakfast Agency 
(% 020-7586-2768; www.londonbb.com), London B and B (% 800-
872-2632 in the United States; www.londonbandb.com), and the
Independent Traveller (% 01392-860-807; www.gowithit.co.uk).
You can also consider staying at a self-catering hotel, where you do the
cooking in the kitchen in your hotel room. For short stays and for one or
two people, self-catering hotels don’t always beat the competition’s price.
But for families and travelers who can’t afford or don’t want to eat out every
meal, self-catering hotels can be a budget-saver. For comfort and conven-
ience, Astons Apartments in South Kensington is among the best (see 
the listing in the following section). If you’re interested in finding other self-
catering options in London, contact Refresh Accommodation (% 0845-680-
0080; www.refreshaccommodation.com).
For general tips on booking and what to expect from European accom-
modations, see Chapter 7.

Astons Apartments

South Kensington
Astons offers value-packed accommodations in three carefully restored
Victorian redbrick town houses. Each studio has a compact kitchenette
(great for families on a budget), a small bathroom, and bright, functional
furnishings. (Because you can cook on your in-room stove, the English call
these accommodations “self-catering” units.) The more expensive designer
studios feature larger bathrooms, more living space, and extra pizzazz in
the décor. Four-person apartments are also available. If you like the idea
of having your own cozy London apartment (with daily maid service, but
no breakfast), you can’t do better. Free cribs, baby tubs, and baby-bottle
sterilization equipment are available.

Durrants Hotel

Marylebone
Opened in 1789 off Manchester Square, this 92-room hotel makes for an
atmospheric London retreat. Durrants is quintessentially English, with
pine- and mahogany-paneled public areas, a wonderful Georgian room that
serves as a restaurant, and even an 18th-century letter-writing room. Most
of the wood-paneled guest rooms are generously proportioned and nicely
furnished, with decent-size bathrooms. Some rooms are large enough for
families with children. The Wallace Collection, one of London’s most sump-
tuous small museums, is right across the street.

The Hoxton
$–$$
Shoreditch
This trendsetting “urban lodge” opened in 2007 and offers something quite
unique for London: chic style at a cheap price. In fact, check their Web site
because the Hoxton periodically holds incredible sales, and you may be
able to nab a room for as little as £1 ($2)! The rooms are comfortable, well-
designed, and refreshingly free of frou-frou. The beautifully tiled, shower-
only bathrooms have every hotel in this price range beat by a mile. A
simple bagged breakfast arrives at your room every morning, food and
wine are sold in the lobby at supermarket prices, guests have access to
high-speed computers (and free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel), and phone
calls are incredibly cheap. In short, you’ll find great value and no rip-offs.
The trendy Shoreditch area is considered part of London’s East End.

Luna & Simone Hotel

Westminster and Victoria
The outside of this big, stucco-fronted, family-run hotel gleams bright
white, and each guest room has a tiled private bathroom with shower. The
36 rooms vary widely in size, but with their blue carpeting and cream-
colored walls, they beat all the dowdy, badly designed hotels and B&Bs
for miles around. The beechwood and marble-clad reception area is all
new, too, as is the smart-looking breakfast room. The look throughout is

Bloomsbury
This clean and comfortable old hotel is the best of a cluster of inexpen-

offered kind, homey service for over 50 years. Rooms are carpeted and the
furniture is worn but cared-for. Ask for a room in the rear of the hotel —
those are the nicest. Though not all rooms have private bathroom, they
do have sinks, TVs, and telephones. The breakfast is large and is included
in the low rates. The British Museum is just around the corner — a huge
plus. Stay more than one day, and the Marazzis will knock a couple of

Dining in London
The British have long been mocked for the drab quality of their national
cuisine (mushy peas, anyone?), and you can still find plenty of undistin-
guished food. But over the past two decades, London’s top chefs have
been paying lots of attention to the quality of old-fashioned dishes,
adopting new culinary techniques, and using more international ingredi-
ents. This fusion of old-world tradition with new-world foodstuffs has led
to the rise of Modern British cuisine and turned London into one of the
culinary capitals of the world. Factor in London’s variety of ethnic
restaurants — locals go out for Indian the way Americans go out for
Chinese — and you won’t ever have to touch steak and kidney pie unless
you want to.
If you’re not interested in trying out the new culinary trends, Britain still
has plenty of time-tested dishes for you to try. The ploughman’s lunch
is a hunk of bread, a chunk of cheese, butter, pickle (relish), and chut-
ney. Two familiar meat pies are the Cornish pasty (beef, potatoes,
onions, and carrots baked in a pastry shell) and shepherd’s pie (lamb
and onions under mashed potatoes; if beef is used, it’s called cottage
pie). The English are masters of roast beef, which is traditionally served
with Yorkshire pudding (a popover-like concoction meant to soak up
the juices).
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 137

You can also partake of oddly named British dishes such as bangers and
mash (sausages and mashed potatoes), bubble-and-squeak (fried cab-
bage and potatoes), or toad in the hole (what Americans call pigs in a
blanket). Fish and chips (fried fish with french fries) remains a popular
staple.
Traditional English breakfasts — becoming rarer in these days of the
continental croissant-and-coffee breakfast — include sausage, fried eggs,
fried tomatoes, and toast with butter and jam. Even better is the tea
ritual, detailed in the “More cool things to see and do” section, later in
the chapter.
English cheeses are delicious and puddings (British for “desserts”) tend
to be very sweet. Of the former, blue-veined Stilton is the king and is
best enjoyed with a glass of port wine. Regional delicacies pop up on 
the cheese board as well, one of the most famous being cheddar. If you
prefer your meal to end with something sweet, try an English pudding.
Trifle is sponge cake soaked with brandy, smothered in fruit or jam, and
topped with custard. Light cream whipped with fresh fruit is called a
fool, and a treacle pudding is a steamed trifle without the sherry and
with syrup instead of fruit.
If you want to wash down your meal with a pint of bitter, make sure it’s a
proper English ale and not a wimpy import or lager. A few of the most
widely available bitters are listed in the “More cool things to see and do”
section, later in this chapter. More and more Brits drink wine, not beer,
with their evening meal.
London is chockablock with restaurants, and Soho is the neighborhood
with the densest concentration of (relatively) inexpensive eateries
(Indian, Italian, Asian, and more). Leicester Square/Piccadilly is the eas-
iest place to find a Döner kebab (a pita wrap with spiced lamb and a
picante sauce) or other Middle Eastern street food. Some of the cheap-
est (but still excellent) Indian and Asian restaurants now cluster just
south of the British Museum in the south end of Bloomsbury (around,
not on, New Oxford Street).
Several of London’s museums and sights have extremely good cafeterias
or restaurants on the premises, so you don’t have to leave the museums
at lunchtime. You may want to plan on a meal in the Tate Britain, Tate
Modern, National Gallery, British Museum, or National Portrait Gallery.
The most discriminating diners shop for their picnic delicacies in the
gourmet food departments of Fortnum & Mason, 181 Piccadilly (see list-
ing later in this section) or Harrods, 87–135 Brompton Rd. (see “More
cool things to do,” later in this chapter). Marks and Spencer, 458 Oxford
St. (% 020-7935-7954), has a grocery department for less fancy staples.
Sainsbury’s is a fairly common supermarket chain where you can buy
food to go (called takeaway).

dishes ranging from glazed pea and leek tart to fresh steamed fish, wine-
braised veal, roast chicken salad, or steaks, plus simpler, more popular

Saving money on meals
Eating out in London can be mind-bogglingly pricey. So where do you go for lower-
cost meals? Try pubs, cafes, sandwich bars, food halls in department stores, ready-
made meals in supermarkets, pizza places, and ethnic restaurants — places where
you’re not paying for custom cooking and high-end personal service. If you opt for a
pricier establishment, always find out whether the restaurant of your choice has a
fixed-price menu. Many of London’s top restaurants offer two- and three-course fixed-
price meals that can slash an a la carte tab by one-third or more. Wine can cost you
a bundle, so forgo that glass of chardonnay if you need to watch your budget. And try
your splurge dining at lunch, when prices are often one-third of the cost at dinner and
you get the same food. Note that in London and throughout England, tap water is not
automatically brought to your table — you must specifically request it. Bottled min-
eral water (still or “fizzy”) is more commonly drunk with meals than tap water.

good, inexpensive afternoon tea.

TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Fortnum & Mason, a posh, legendary London store that’s a “purveyor to

mezzanine-level Patio is a good lunch spot, with a menu that offers an
assortment of pricey sandwiches and main courses, including hot and cold
pies (steak and kidney, curried fish and banana, chicken, and game) and
Welsh rarebit (thick melted cheese poured over toast) prepared with
Guinness stout. The lower-level Fountain offers breakfast and lunch, and
the fourth-floor St. James’s serves lunch and afternoon tea. The more well-
heeled dine at St. James’s, where the menu is traditionally British: For
starters, try the kipper (smoked herring) mousse or potato and Stilton
brûlée; main courses include pies and roast rib of Scottish beef. Although
crowded with tourists, these three establishments remain pleasant places
where you can get a good meal and a glimpse of the fading Empire. The
Fountain and Patio are good places to dine with a family; ice-cream sun-

with the venison or wild fowl. Try the roast loin of Wiltshire rabbit, Irish
sirloin steak with béarnaise sauce, or Gloucestershire pork chops with
crackling and chutney — just make sure you cap the meal off with one of
Rules’s famous puddings. This truly is a special place, well worth a splurge.

Exploring London
London is home to some of the world’s greatest museums and nearly 
all of them are absolutely free. You can walk in and enjoy the antiquities
of the British Museum, the Old Masters of the National Gallery, the con-
temporary greats in the Tate Modern, and the decorative arts in the
Victoria & Albert Museum (known as the V&A). London’s major
churches — Westminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral — do charge
admission, and so does the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace.
London’s top sights
British Airways London Eye
South Bank
As a piece of engineering, the 400-foot-high London Eye observation wheel
is impressive. Each glass-sided elliptical module holds about 25 passen-
gers, with enough space so that you can move about freely. Lasting about
30 minutes (equivalent to one rotation), the ride (or flight, as they call it)
is remarkably smooth — even on windy days riders don’t feel any nerve-
twittering shakes. Providing that the weather is good, the wheel offers
unrivaled views of London. It’s a good idea to reserve your place (with a
specific entry time) before you arrive; otherwise, you may have to wait an
hour or more before you can get on the wheel.

British Museum
Bloomsbury
The British Museum ranks as the most visited attraction in London, with
a splendid, wide-ranging collection of treasures from around the world.
Permanent displays of antiquities from Egypt, Western Asia, Greece, and
Rome are on view, as well as prehistoric and Romano-British, Medieval,
Renaissance, Modern, and Oriental collections. Give yourself at least three
unhurried hours in the museum. If you have only limited time, consider
taking one of the 90-minute highlight tours offered daily at 10:30 a.m., 
1 p.m., and 3 p.m.; the cost is £8 ($16). You can rent audio guides, which
also cover museum highlights, for £3.50 ($7).
The most famous of the museum’s countless treasures are the superb
Parthenon Sculptures brought to England in 1801 by the seventh Lord
Part III: The British Isles 
142

Elgin. These marble sculptures once adorned the Parthenon in Athens,
and Greece desperately wants them returned. Other famous treasures
include the Egyptian Mummies; the Rosetta Stone, which enabled archae-
ologists to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics; and the Sutton Hoo Treasure,
an Anglo-Saxon burial ship, believed to be the tomb of a seventh-century
East Anglian king.
The museum’s Great Court, inaccessible to the general public for 150
years, is now the museum’s central axis, with a glass-and-steel roof
designed by Lord Norman Foster. The circular building in the center, com-
pleted in 1857, once served as the museum’s famous Reading Room.
Completely restored, it now houses computer terminals where visitors can
access images and information about the museum’s vast collections.

Buckingham Palace and the Changing of the Guard
St. James’s Park and Green Park
Since 1837, when Victoria ascended the throne, all the majesty, scandal,
intrigue, triumph, tragedy, power, wealth, and tradition associated with
the British monarchy has been hidden behind the monumental facade of
Buckingham Palace, the reigning monarch’s London residence.
An impressive early-18th-century pile, the palace was rebuilt in 1825 and
further modified in 1913. From August through September, when the royal
family isn’t in residence, you can buy a ticket to get a glimpse of the state-
rooms used by Elizabeth II and the other royals. You leave via the gardens,
where the queen holds her famous garden parties each summer. Budget
about two hours for your visit.
Throughout the year, you can visit the Royal Mews, one of the finest work-
ing stables in existence, where the magnificent Gold State Coach, used in
every coronation since 1831, and other royal conveyances are housed (and
horses stabled). The Queen’s Gallery, which features changing exhibits
of works from the Royal Collection, went through a refurbishment and
reopened for the queen’s golden jubilee in June 2002.
The famous Changing of the Guard takes place along Birdcage Walk and
in front of Buckingham Palace at 11:30 a.m., daily from April through early
June and on alternate days the rest of the year. You can check dates at
www.royalcollection.org.uk.
You can purchase admission tickets to Buckingham Palace, and request a
specific entry time, by calling % 020-7766-7300. All phone-charged tick-
ets cost an additional £1.25 ($2.50). Also, you can purchase reduced-price

Houses of Parliament and Big Ben
Westminster
The Houses of Parliament, situated along the Thames, house the land-
mark clock tower containing Big Ben, the biggest bell in the booming
hourly chime that Londoners have been hearing for nearly 150 years.
Designed by Sir Charles Barry and A. W. N. Pugin, the impressive Victorian
buildings were completed in 1857. Covering approximately 3.2 hectares (8
acres), they occupy the site of an 11th-century palace of Edward the
Confessor.
At one end (Old Palace Yard) you find the Jewel House, built in 1366 and
once the treasury house of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377. The
best overall view of the Houses of Parliament is from Westminster Bridge,
but if you prefer, you can sit in the Stranger’s Gallery to hear Parliamentary
debate. The best way to see the Houses of Parliament, however, is to take
a 75-minute guided tour, available Monday through Saturday from the end
of July through most of September. The tours cost £12 ($24) for adults, £8
($16) for seniors, £5 ($10) for children, and £30 ($60) for families; you can
reserve by phone at % 0870-906-3773, online at www.keithprowse.com,
or by visiting the ticket office in Westminster Hall (at the Houses of
Parliament). For the rest of the year, the procedure for getting a tour is
much more difficult. If you’re interested, you can find details on the Web at

get the lion’s share of wall space, with works by artists such as da Vinci,
Botticelli, and Raphael. The French Impressionist and post-Impressionist
works by Monet, Manet, Seurat, Cézanne, Degas, and van Gogh are splen-
did. And because you’re on English soil, check out at least a few of Turner’s
stunning seascapes, Constable’s landscapes, and Reynolds’s society por-
traits. And you won’t want to miss the Rembrandts. Budget at least two
hours to enjoy the gallery. The second floor has a good restaurant for
lunch, tea, or snacks.

St. Paul’s Cathedral
The City of London
After the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the city’s old cathedral, the great
architect Christopher Wren was called upon to design St. Paul’s, a huge
and harmonious Renaissance-leaning-toward-baroque building. During
World War II, Nazi bombing raids wiped out the surrounding area but
spared the cathedral, so Wren’s masterpiece, capped by the most famous
dome in London, rises majestically above a crowded sea of undistin-
guished office buildings. Grinling Gibbons carved the exceptionally beau-
tiful choir stalls, the only impressive artwork inside.
Christopher Wren is buried in the crypt; his companions in the crypt
include Britain’s famed national heroes: the Duke of Wellington, who
defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and Admiral Lord Nelson, who took down
the French at Trafalgar during the same war. But many people want to see
St. Paul’s simply because Lady Diana Spencer wed Prince Charles here in
what was billed as “the fairy-tale wedding of the century.”
You can climb up to the Whispering Gallery for a bit of acoustical fun or
gasp your way up to the very top for a breathtaking view of London. You
can see the entire cathedral in an hour or less. St. Paul’s is now linked to
the Tate Modern on the South Bank by the pedestrian-only Millennium
Bridge, designed by Lord Norman Foster.

Transept; ring the bell for assistance.
Tate Britain
Pimlico
The Tate Gallery took this name to distinguish it from its new counterpart,
Tate Modern (see the next listing). Tate Britain retains the older (pre–20th
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 145

century) collections of exclusively British art, plus works by major British
stars, such as David Hockney, and experimental works by Brits and for-
eigners living in Britain. Among the masterpieces on display in a host of
newly refurbished galleries are dreamy works by the British pre-Raphaelites,
the celestial visions of William Blake, bawdy satirical works by William
Hogarth, genteel portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, pastoral landscapes by
John Constable, and the shimmering seascapes of J. M. W. Turner. The col-
lection is hung thematically rather than chronologically. Plan on spending
at least two hours here. The gallery has a fine restaurant and a cafe on the
lower level.

but call first for details on entry.
Tate Modern
South Bank
The former Bankside Power Station is the setting for the fabulous Tate
Modern, which opened in May 2000. Considered one of the top modern-
art museums in the world, it houses the Tate’s collection of international
20th-century art, displaying major works by some of the most influential
artists of this century: Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Salvador Dalí, Marcel
Duchamp, Henry Moore, and Frances Bacon among them. A gallery for the
21st-century collection exhibits contemporary art. Fans of contemporary
art and architecture shouldn’t miss this new star on the London art scene.
Plan on spending at least two hours.

Tower of London
The City of London
Come early to beat the long lines at London’s best medieval attraction, a
site of intrigue, murder, and executions galore. The hour-long tours, guided
by Beefeater guards, are highly entertaining and informative. Count on at
least another full hour to explore on your own and to investigate the
Crown Jewels, the Armory, and such. The Beefeaters take you past the
Bloody Tower, where Sir Walter Raleigh awaited execution for 13 years and
where King Edward IV’s two young sons were murdered. You walk through
the 900-year-old White Tower, still housing an armory of swords and plate
mail, as well as a gruesome collection of torture instruments, and into
Tower Green, where Thomas Moore, Lady Jane Grey, and two of Henry
VIII’s wives (Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard) were beheaded.
Part III: The British Isles 
146

All the gore should be enough trade-off for the kids when you have to wait
in line to be whisked past the Crown Jewels on a moving walkway. Be sure
to drool over the world’s largest cut diamond, the 530-carat Star of Africa
(set in the Sovereign’s Sceptre), and to gape at Queen Victoria’s Imperial
State Crown (still worn on occasion), studded with over 3,000 jewels. Say
hello to the resident ravens, who are rather pampered because legend
holds that the Tower will stand as long as they remain; in 2006, they were
put indoors so that they wouldn’t contract avian flu.

Admission: £16 ($32) adults, £13 ($26) seniors and students, £9 ($18) children 5–15.

2:30 p.m. (3:30 p.m. in summer); Sun tours begin at 10 a.m.
Trafalgar Square
St. James’s
After a major urban redesign scheme, Trafalgar Square reopened in 2003
with one side attached to the steps of the National Gallery, making access
easier than it’s ever been. Besides being a major tourist attraction,
Trafalgar Square is the site of many large gatherings, including political
demonstrations, Christmas revels, and New Year’s Eve festivities. The
square honors military hero Admiral Lord Nelson (1758–1805), who lost
his life at the Battle of Trafalgar, fighting French and Spanish forces.
Nelson’s Column, with fountains and four bronze lions at its base, rises
some 44m (145 ft.) above the square. At the top, a 4m-high (14-ft.) statue
of Nelson (who was 5'4" tall in real life) looks commandingly toward
Admiralty Arch, passed through by state and royal processions between
Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral. You don’t really need more
than a few minutes to take in the square. St. Martin-in-the-Fields (% 020-
7930-0089), the famous neoclassical church at the northeast corner of
Trafalgar Square, was designed by James Gibbs, a disciple of Christopher
Wren, and completed in 1726.
See map p. 132. Bounded on the north by Trafalgar, on the west by Cockspur Street,
and on the east by Whitehall. Tube: Charing Cross (an exit from the Underground sta-
tion leads to the square).
Victoria & Albert Museum
South Kensington
The Victoria & Albert (known as the V&A) is the national museum of art and
design. In the 145 galleries, filled with fine and decorative arts from around
the world, you find superbly decorated period rooms, a fashion collection
spanning 400 years of European designs, Raphael’s designs for tapestries in
the Sistine Chapel, the Silver Galleries, and the largest assemblages of
Renaissance sculpture outside Italy and of Indian art outside India. The
Canon Photography Gallery shows work by celebrated photographers. In
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 147

November 2001, the museum opened its spectacular new British Galleries.
Allow at least two hours to cover just the basics.
See map p. 132. Cromwell Road. % 020-7942-2000. www.vam.ac.uk. Tube: South
Kensington (the museum is across from the Underground station). Admission: Free.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Fri). Closed Dec 24–26. The museum is
wheelchair accessible (only about 5 percent of the exhibits include steps).
Westminster Abbey
Westminster
The Gothic and grand Westminster Abbey is one of London’s most impor-
tant historic sites. The present abbey dates mostly from the 13th and 14th
centuries, but a church has been on this site for more than a thousand
years. Since 1066, when William the Conqueror became the first English
monarch to be crowned here, every successive British sovereign except
for two (Edward V and Edward VIII) has sat on the Coronation Chair to
receive the crown and scepter. In the Royal Chapels, you can see the
chapel of Henry VII, with its delicate fan vaulting, and the tomb of Queen
Elizabeth I, who was buried in the same vault as her Catholic half-sister,
Mary I, and not far from her rival Mary Queen of Scots. In Poets’ Corner,
some of England’s greatest writers (including Chaucer, Dickens, and
Thomas Hardy) are interred or memorialized. Other points of interest
include the College Garden, cloisters, chapter house, and the Undercroft
Museum, which contains the Pyx Chamber, with its display of church 
plate — the silver owned by the church. In September 1997, the abbey
served as the site of Princess Diana’s funeral; in 2002, the funeral service for
the Queen Mother was held there. The abbey is within walking distance of
the Houses of Parliament.

More cool things to see and do
 Strolling Portobello Road Market: Antiques collectors, bargain
hunters, tourists, and deals on everything from kumquats to
Wedgwood are what you find at London’s most popular street
market. The outdoor fruit and veggie market runs all week (except
Sun), but on Saturday, starting at 5:30 a.m., the market balloons
into an enormous flea and antiques mart. About 90 antiques shops
line the roads around this section of London; so even during the
week, you can browse their dusty treasures (serious shoppers pick
up the Sat Antiques Market guide). To get to the market, take the
Tube to Notting Hill Gate.

 Embarking on a London pub crawl: The drinker’s version of a tradi-
tional London evening out starts around 5:30 p.m. at a favorite pub
and continues from one pub to the next throughout the evening.
Among the most historic and atmospheric ale houses are the his-
toric Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese at Wine Office Court, off 145 Fleet St.
(% 020-7353-6170), where Dr. Johnson once held court; Dryden’s
old haunt the Lamb and Flag, 33 Rose St. (% 020-7497-9504),
known as “Bucket of Blood” from its rowdier days; the Art Nouveau
Black Friar, 174 Queen Victoria St. (% 020-7236-5474); and Anchor
Inn, 34 Park St. (% 0870-990-6402), where the present pub dates
from 1757 — but a pub has been at this location for 800 years, with
Dickens and Shakespeare as past patrons. Make sure you order
some true English bitters, hand-pumped and served at room tem-
perature. Try Wadworth, Tetley’s, Flowers, and the London-brewed
Young’s and Fuller’s. Most pubs are open Monday through Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 10:30 p.m. Pub
opening hours were extended in 2005, so some of them now stay
open until midnight and later.
 Making a shopping pilgrimage to Harrods: Posh, somewhat stuffy,
and a bit snobbish (they may turn you away if you look too scruffy),
Harrods, 87–135 Brompton Rd. (% 020-7730-1234; www.harrods.
com), is the only store in the world that offers you any item you can
possibly want and backs up its word. With 1.2 million square feet
and 300 departments, the store carries just about everything. Its
fabulous food halls are still the highlight of a visit — 500 varieties 
of cheese, anyone?
 Raising your pinkies at a proper afternoon tea: Tea (and, increas-
ingly, coffee) is drunk around the clock, but “tea time” is between 
3 and 5:30 p.m. That’s when you can sit down and order a steaming
pot of tea accompanied by a tiered platter of delicious finger sand-
wiches, slices of cake, and scones with jam and clotted cream. A full
tea can run anywhere from £10 to £40 ($20–$80). One of London’s
classiest (and most expensive) afternoon teas is at Brown’s Hotel,
29–34 Albemarle St. (% 020-7493-6020; www.brownshotel.com;
Tube: Green Park). Less pricey — but just as good — are the teas 
at two of London’s legendary department stores: the inimitable
Harrods Georgian Restaurant, on the fourth floor, at 87–135
Brompton Rd. (% 020-7730-1234; www.harrods.com; Tube:
Knightsbridge), and Fortnum & Mason’s St. James’s Restaurant, 181
Piccadilly (% 020-7734-8040; www.fortnumandmason.co.uk; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus or Green Park).
 Seeing a Shakespeare play at the Globe Theatre: Shakespeare 
was once part owner and main playwright for a theater called the
Globe, right on the Thames at Bankside. Shakespeare’s Globe
Theatre is a recently built replica of the O-shaped building, with an
open center and projecting stage — the sort of space for which
Shakespeare’s plays were written. Performances are late April
through early October; tickets for seats run £15 to £33 ($30–$66).
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 149

For only £5 ($10), you can stand in the open space right in front of
the stage (tiring, and not so fun if it rains). Call % 020-7401-9919
for the box office. Even if you don’t stop for a show, make some
time during the day to come for a tour (% 020-7902-1400; www.
shakespeares-globe.org).
 Club hopping: The city that gave the world punk, new wave,
techno, and electronica still has one of the world’s most trend-
setting clublands. The nature of the art means that any place we
mention in this book will be considered out before the guide is, so
do yourself a favor and pick up the Time Out London magazine to
find out what’s hottest each week. A few perennial favorites (sure
to be full of tourists) include the Ministry of Sound, 103 Gaunt St.,
SE1 (% 020-7378-6528; www.ministryofsound.com); the Equinox,
Leicester Square, W2 (% 020-7437-1446); Carwash, 256 Old St.,
EC1 (% 0870-246-1966); and Venom Club/The Zoo Bar, 13–17 Bear
St., WC2 (% 020-7839-4188).
 Joining the thespians — an evening at the theater: London rivals
New York for the biggest, most diverse theater scene. The West End
has dozens of playhouses, but you find many other venues as well.
The Time Out London and What’s On magazines list (and review)
the week’s offerings, as does the online Official London Theatre
Guide (www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk). For tickets, your
best bet is to go directly to the theater’s box office, where you
won’t have to pay an additional booking fee; you can also buy
them, and pay a booking fee, from Keith Prowse (% 800-223-6108
in the U.S., 0870-842-2248 in the U.K.; www.keithprowse.com),
which has a desk in the main tourist office on Regent Street.
Theater tickets can cost anywhere from £15 to £70 ($30–$140). If
you want to try to get last-minute tickets at a discount, the only
official spot is Leicester Square’s half-price TKTS ticket booth
(www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk/tkts), open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday noon to 3 p.m. The tick-
ets there are usually half-price (plus a £2.50/$5 fee) and are sold on
the day of the performance only. The most popular productions are
usually not offered at TKTS.
 Waxing historic at Madame Tussaud’s: Famous Madame Tussaud’s,
Marylebone Road (% 0870-400-3000; www.madame-tussauds.co.
uk), is something between a still-life amusement ride and a serious
gallery of historical likenesses. Madame herself took death masks
from the likes of Marie Antoinette and other French royals beheaded
in the Revolution; Ben Franklin (while very much alive) personally
sat for her to mold a portrait. Some of the historical dioramas are
interesting — although whether they’re £20 ($40) worth of interest-
ing is seriously up for debate. (Tickets for children are £16/$32; the
prices for all tickets fall considerably if you enter after 5 p.m.).
Besides the obligatory celebs and superstores on display, there’s
also a gore-fest Chamber of Horrors and a Spirit of London theme
ride. The museum is open Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

 Setting your watch — a day in Greenwich: London may set its
watches by Big Ben, but Ben looks to the Old Royal Observatory at
Greenwich for the time of day. This attractive Thames port and river-
side village keeps Greenwich (mean) time, by which the entire world
sets its clocks. At the observatory, you can straddle the prime merid-
ian (0° longitude mark) and have one foot in each hemisphere. Then
visit the National Maritime Museum and immerse yourself in the his-
tory of the British Navy. After that, head to the adjacent Queen’s
House, designed by Inigo Jones, completed in 1635, and later used as
a model for the White House; today it’s an art gallery. All three attrac-
tions are free and open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (% 0870-780-
4552 or 020-8312-6565; www.nmm.ac.uk). Unfortunately, that most
famous of clipper ships, the Cutty Sark, suffered major fire damage
in 2007 and is closed for a complete refit that will take years. The
Greenwich Tourist Information Centre, Pepys Houses, Cutty Sark
Gardens (% 0870-608-2000; www.greenwich.gov.uk), can give you
more information on all the historic attractions in Greenwich. You
have several options for getting to Greenwich: You can take the
Jubilee Tube line to North Greenwich (then bus no. 188 to the mar-
itime heritage site); the train from Charing Cross Station; the
Docklands Light Railway from the Tower Hill Tube stop; or the no.
188 bus from Russell Square. Our favorite mode of transport to this
destination is by boat: Catch a ferry from Westminster Pier.
Guided tours
You can get an excellent overview of the city’s layout, and see many of
the architectural sights at a snappy pace, from the top of a double-
decker bus on the Original London Sightseeing Tour (% 020-8877-
1722; www.theoriginaltour.com). You’ll find boarding points for this
hop-on/hop-off bus at 90 different stops throughout the city, including all
the major attractions. At £19 ($38) for adults and £12 ($24) for kids, the
Original Tour is the best overall, spinning a 90-minute loop of the top
sights with five minutes (15 in winter) between buses. Tickets are good
all day — if you buy tickets after 2 p.m., they’re good the next day as
well. With this tour you get a free boat ride on the Thames and some
walking tours as well.
Of the many walking tour outfits in this city, by far the biggest and best
is London Walks (% 020-7624-3978; www.walks.com). For fun, educa-
tion, and entertainment at a really low price (£6/$12 adults, free for chil-
dren 14 and under with a parent), a London Walk is one of the best
investments you can make in London. Two-hour themed walks with an
expert guide take you through historic neighborhoods, on pub crawls, or
for walks in the footsteps of Shakespeare, Churchill, Christopher Wren,
or Jack the Ripper.
Suggested itineraries
In case you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this sec-
tion offers some tips for building your own London itineraries.
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 151

If you have one day
To see London in a day takes full-throttle sightseeing. Reserve ahead for
the 9:30 a.m. Beefeater tour at the Tower of London. After perusing the
Crown Jewels there, take off for the British Museum (grab lunch along
the way) to ogle the Rosetta Stone, Egyptian mummies, and Parthenon
sculptures. Be at Westminster Abbey by 3 p.m. to pay homage to the
British monarchs, English poets, and other notables entombed therein;
then make your way over to have a look at Buckingham Palace and
Trafalgar Square. Have an early pre-theater dinner at Rules and then
spend the evening doing whatever floats your boat: attending a play or a
concert, indulging in a pub crawl, or just enjoying the street scene and
nighttime crowds milling around Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.
If you have two days
Begin Day 1 at Buckingham Palace, where, if you time it right, you can
watch the Changing of the Guard. Afterward, head for the British Museum
to marvel at the spoils of the old empire. Move along to the stellar collec-
tion of Renaissance paintings in the National Gallery, stopping early on
for a sandwich in the excellent cafeteria, and visiting Trafalgar Square
afterward. Lunch tides you over until you get to fabled Harrods depart-
ment store, where you can take a break from the window-shopping to
indulge in an afternoon tea in the Georgian Restaurant. Spend the late
afternoon however you like, but make sure you get tickets ahead of time
for a play or show (whether it’s Shakespeare at the Globe or a West End
musical), and book ahead at Rules for a post-theater dinner (in fact, try to
reserve a week or so beforehand).
Start off Day 2 at the Tower of London on one of the excellent Beefeater
tours. Spend the late morning climbing the dome of Christopher Wren’s
masterpiece, St. Paul’s Cathedral. After a late lunch, be at the meeting
place for the London Walks tour that intrigues you the most (several
leave from near St. Paul’s). Try to get to Westminster Abbey early
enough to pop into the Royal Chapels before they close. Duck out and
head over to have a look at the neighboring Houses of Parliament and
the clock tower with Big Ben. The British Airways London Eye is right
across the river and, on a clear day, offers a stupendous view of London.
If it’s a Friday or Saturday, you still have time afterward to hit the Tate
Modern, which doesn’t close until 10 p.m.
If you have three days
Spend the morning of Day 1 in the British Museum, which catalogs
human achievement across the world and throughout the ages. During
lunch, call the Globe Theatre to find out whether a play is on for the next
day at 2 p.m. (if so, book tickets). Try to finish lunch by 2 p.m. and then
head to the nearest stop on the map for the Original London Sightseeing
Tours and take the 90-minute bus loop past the major sights of London,
which will include Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square. After you’re
good and oriented, plunge right into the Old Masters of the National
Gallery. Have a traditional British dinner at Rules or Porters English
Part III: The British Isles 
152

Restaurant and try to get to bed early; you need to wake up early the next
morning.
Day 2 is the day for the London of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. Be
at the Tower of London by 9:30 a.m. to get in on the first guided tour of
this medieval bastion and its Crown Jewels. Afterward, visit St. Paul’s
Cathedral and grab some lunch. Then head across the Thames River 
on the Millennium Bridge to visit the Tate Modern. Afterward, stroll
Bankside walkway along the Thames to tour Shakespeare’s Globe
Theatre and, if possible, experience one of the Bard’s plays in the open-
air setting the way he intended (plays start at 2 p.m.). The tour itself
only takes an hour; a play takes two to four hours.
If you see a play, plan on a quick dinner; if you just do the tour, you have
the late afternoon to spend as you like — perhaps squeeze in a visit to
Tate Britain to marvel at the best of British art, or take a ride on the
British Airways London Eye. Either way, finish dinner by 6:30 or 7 p.m.
so that you can join whichever historic pub walk London Walks is run-
ning that evening (they start at 7 or 7:30 p.m.; the brochure tells you
where to meet). After your introduction to British ales and pub life, call
it a night.
Yesterday was medieval, but for Day 3 you’re going to stiffen your upper
lip with some Victorian-era British traditions. Start out at 9 a.m. by
paying your respects to centuries of British heroes, poets, and kings
buried at Westminster Abbey. Drop by the Victoria & Albert Museum
for miles of the best in decorative arts and sculpture. Have a snack (not
lunch) on your way to the world’s grandest and most venerable depart-
ment store, Harrods. After a bit of browsing inside, stop by the fourth
floor’s Georgian Restaurant at 3 p.m. sharp for a proper British after-
noon tea. Linger and enjoy your teatime.
Head over to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament around 5:30 p.m.
and, if government is in session (Oct–July), get in line to go inside and
watch Parliament at work, vilifying one another in a colorfully entertain-
ing way that makes the U.S. Congress seem like a morgue. Or, if you go
gaga over musicals (or are itching to see a cutting-edge London play), 
go see a show. Either way, because you’ll eat late, make sure you’ve
reserved a restaurant that specializes in late, after-theater meals (Rules
is a good choice).
Traveling beyond London
You can find enough in London to keep you busy for weeks, but a day
trip into the English countryside is a magnificent way to spread your
wings and enlarge your horizons. Our top choices are Bath, with its
ancient Roman baths and stately 18th-century mansions; Salisbury, with
its imposing Gothic cathedral and Stonehenge nearby; and Oxford, one
of the world’s greatest college towns.
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 153

The fastest and easiest way to reach these destinations is by train.
National Express (% 08705-808-080; www.nationalexpress.com)
offers guided bus trips, but the buses take much longer than the train.
Bath: Ancient Rome in Georgian clothing
When Queen Anne relaxed at the natural hot springs here in 1702, she
made the village of Bath fashionable, but she wasn’t exactly blazing new
territory. The Romans built the first town here in A.D. 75, a small village
centered on the same hot springs. The water was considered to be
sacred and healing, so the Romans built a temple over the springs and
dedicated it to Sulis Minerva — a deity that combined the Latin goddess
of knowledge, Minerva, with Sulis, the local Celtic water goddess. In the
18th century, when the Georgians were laying out what would become
Britain’s most unified cityscape — with the help of architects John
Wood, Sr., and John Wood, Jr. — they unearthed the ancient temple,
Britain’s best-preserved Roman ruins.
Bath, today, is a genteel foray into the Georgian world, with its memories
of fashionable balls, gambling, gossip, and of course, “taking the waters.”
Highlights of a visit here include touring the excavated Roman temple
and admiring the honey-colored stone architecture that drew, in its
heyday, the likes of Dickens, Thackeray, and Jane Austen, the writer
most associated with Bath. With its parks, squares, and curving cres-
cents, Bath is a city of such architectural distinction that UNESCO has
designated it as a World Heritage City. Although doable as a day trip
from London, Bath’s charms really come out after the day-trippers leave;
savvy travelers plan to stay the night and next morning.
Getting there
Trains to Bath leave from London’s Paddington Station every half-hour;
the trip takes about 90 minutes. For train fares and schedules, call
National Rail at % 08457-484950 or go to www.nationalrail.co.uk.
Once you’re there, pick up maps and information at the Tourist
Information Centre (% 01225-477-761; www.visitbath.co.uk),
located on the square next to Bath Abbey in the center of town.
Free, two-hour Mayor’s Guides walking tours leave from outside the
Pump Room Sunday through Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., and Saturday
at 10:30 a.m. From May through September, additional walks are offered at
7 p.m. on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday.
Seeing the sights
Start your tour at the city’s main square. A spin through the Roman
Baths Museum (% 01225-477-785; www.romanbaths.co.uk) with your
digital audio guide in hand gives you an overview of the hot springs from
their Celto-Roman inception (the head of Minerva is a highlight) to the
17th/18th-century spa built over the hot springs. You can drink a cup 
of the famous waters (taste: blech!) upstairs in the elegant Pump Room
(% 01225-477-785). This cafe/restaurant offers one of England’s classic
Part III: The British Isles 
154

afternoon tea services, but you can also get a good lunch here, all to the
musical accompaniment of a live trio or solo pianist. Lunch and tea are
served daily. The museum is open November through February daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., March through June and September through
October daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and July and August from 9 a.m. to
10 p.m. Admission is £11 ($22) adults, £9 ($18) seniors, £6.80 ($14) chil-
dren, and £30 ($60) families.
After seeing the museum and Pump Room, head out to the square to
examine Bath Abbey (% 01225-422-462), a 16th-century church
renowned for the fantastic, scalloped fan vaulting of its ceilings. The
Abbey is open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
(until 6 p.m. Apr–Oct), Sunday from 1 to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Admission is £2.50 ($5).
The Jane Austen Centre, 40 Gay St. (% 01225-443-000; www.jane
austen.co.uk), located in a Georgian town house on an elegant street
where Austen once lived, is something to visit if you’re a Jane Austen
buff. Exhibits and a video convey a sense of what life was like in Bath
during the Regency period, and how the city influenced Austen’s writing.
The center is open daily from 9:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (July–Aug Thurs–Sat
until 8:30 p.m.; Nov–Feb daily until 4:30 p.m.). Admission is £6.50 ($13)
adults, £4.95 ($9.90) seniors and students, £3.50 ($7) children, £18 ($36)
families. The Regency Tea Rooms on the second floor are a nice spot for
afternoon tea (£6.95/$14).
Bath in and of itself is a major attraction, so plan to stroll as much as
you can. Be sure to visit the architectural triumphs of The Circus and
the Royal Crescent, both up on the north end of town. The latter has a
highly recommended museum, No. 1 Royal Crescent (% 01225-428-
126), a gorgeously restored 18th-century house with period furnishings.
It’s open mid-February through mid-October Tuesdays through Sundays
from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and mid-October through November from
10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.; admission is £5 ($10) adults, £4 ($8) seniors, and
£12 ($24) families.
Where to stay
If you can swing the £185-and-up ($370) per-double price tag, the place
to stay in Bath is bang in the middle of one of the city’s architectural tri-
umphs at the Royal Crescent Hotel, 16 Royal Crescent (% 888-295-4710
in the U.S., 0800-980-0987 or 01225-823-333 in the U.K.; Fax: 01225-339-401;
www.royalcrescent.co.uk). If you stay here, you get to experience 
a contemporary version of Georgian splendor, with a private boat and
hot-air balloon at your disposal (for a hefty additional sum). Otherwise,
the elegant Victorian One Three Nine, Leighton House, 139 Wells Rd.
(% 01225-314-769; Fax: 01225-443-079; www.139bath.co.uk), is a small,
stylish, boutique B&B that’s much more affordable. Rack rates are £65 to
£150 ($130–$300) double.
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 155

Where to dine
A popular eatery in Bath’s city center is No. 5 Bistro, 5 Argyle St. 
(% 01225-444-499). The chef at this pleasant restaurant produces
mouthwatering daily specials such as steak, Provençal fish soup, char-
grilled loin of lamb, and vegetarian dishes. Main courses are £14 to £17
($28–$34).
Salisbury and Stonehenge: Inspired spires 
and outstanding standing stones
Many visitors hurrying out to see the famous stone circle known as
Stonehenge are surprised to find one of Europe’s greatest Gothic cathe-
drals just 14km (9 miles) away. Salisbury, gateway to South Wiltshire and
its prehistoric remains, is a medieval market town that’s a deserved
attraction in its own right. Although you can see the cathedral and
Stonehenge as a day trip from London, you have to rush to do it.
Getting there
Hourly trains travel from London’s Waterloo Station to Salisbury 
(pronounced Sauls-bur-ee) daily. From here, Wilts and Dorset buses
(% 01722-336-855; www.wdbus.co.uk) depart about every two hours
(starting at 10:25 a.m.) for the 40-minute trip out to Stonehenge, 14km 
(9 miles) north of the city at the junction of the A303 and A344/A360.
Salisbury’s Tourist Information Centre (% 01722-334-956; www.visit
salisbury.com) is on Fish Row.
Seeing the sights
Salisbury Cathedral, The Close (% 01722-555-120), the town’s one
must-see attraction, dates from the 13th century and is the best example
of the Perpendicular Gothic style of architecture in all of England. The
123-m (404-ft.) spire is the tallest in the country and dominates the coun-
tryside. Step into the cathedral’s exceptionally beautiful octagonal chap-
ter house to see one of the four surviving original copies of the Magna
Carta, and then stroll through the serene cloisters. The suggested dona-
tion for admission is £5 ($10) for adults, £4.25 ($8.50) for seniors and stu-
dents, £3 ($6) for children, and £12 ($24) for families. The cathedral is
open daily from 7:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. (until 7:15 p.m. June–Aug).
After exploring the cathedral, take some time to wander around the
Cathedral Close, the historic precinct housing the cathedral and sur-
rounded by old stone walls and the River Avon. Some of Salisbury’s
finest houses are in the large Close, which includes some 75 buildings.
You can tour one of the best of the remaining houses: Mompesson
House (% 01722-335-659; www.nationaltrust.org.uk), built in 1701.
The house evokes the Queen Anne period so richly that period dramas
are often filmed here. (You may recognize the house from director Ang
Lee’s 1995 Sense and Sensibility.) The house is open mid-March through
Part III: The British Isles 
156

October Saturday through Wednesday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission
for adults is £4.50 ($9). If you have time, walk through the nearby Water
Meadows, where you can enjoy a view of the cathedral and surrounding
landscape made famous by the painter John Constable in the early 19th
century.
Where to stay
A double with breakfast at the comfortable Mercure White Hart Hotel
(% 01722-327-416; www.mercure.uk.com), opposite Salisbury
Cathedral, goes for £90 to £160 ($180–$320). More atmospheric is the
Red Lion Hotel (% 01722-323-334; www.the-redlion.co.uk), an
ancient coaching inn (now owned by Best Western) where the doubles
with breakfast start at £134 ($268) and an open fire warms the pub.
Where to dine
For good homemade food in the center of Salisbury (overlooking the
marketplace), go to Harper’s Restaurant, 7–9 Ox Row, Market Square
(% 01722-333-118). On the menu at this old-fashioned restaurant you’ll
find uncomplicated main courses such as lemon sole, burritos, deep-fried
calamari, and Wiltshire sausages. Main courses run from £7.50 to £14
($15–$28). One Minster Street, 1 Minster St. (% 01722-322-024), is the
trendy new name for a wonderfully atmospheric chophouse and pub that
dates to 1320 and that everyone still calls the Haunch of Venison. The
menu at the third-floor restaurant combines contemporary international
cuisine and traditional favorites; mains go for £7.50 to £15 ($15–$30). Do
check out the ancient pub rooms, even if you don’t dine here.
Chapter 10: London and the Best of England 157
Still standing: the stones of Stonehenge
Stonehenge (% 01980-624-715; www.english-heritage.org), one of the world’s
most renowned prehistoric sites and one of England’s most popular attractions, is a
stone circle of megalithic pillars and lintels built on the flat Salisbury Plain some 3,500
to 5,000 years ago. As you walk around the site, and listen to the history of Stonehenge
on the free audio guide, the majesty and mystery of these ancient stones will not be
lost on you.
Stonehenge was almost certainly a shrine and/or ceremonial gathering place of some
kind. A popular theory is that the site was an astronomical observatory because it’s
aligned to the summer solstice and can accurately predict eclipses based on the place-
ment of the stones. Recent archaeological evidence has uncovered another ceremo-
nial avenue nearby, leading experts to speculate that Stonehenge was also an important
burial place. But in an age when experts think they know everything, Stonehenge still
keeps its tantalizing secrets to itself. Admission is £6.30 ($13) adults, £4.70 ($9.40) seniors
and students, and £3.20 ($6.40) children. Stonehenge is open daily from March 16 through
May and September through October 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., June through August
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and October 16 to March 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Oxford: The original college town
Oxford University, one of the world’s oldest, greatest, and most revered
universities, dominates the town of Oxford, about 87km (54 miles) north-
west of London. Its skyline pierced by ancient tawny towers and spires,
Oxford has been a center of learning for seven centuries (the Saxons
founded the city in the 10th century). Roger Bacon, Sir Walter Raleigh,
John Donne, Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Samuel Johnson, Edward Gibbon,
William Penn, John Wesley, Lewis Carroll, T. E. Lawrence, W. H. Auden,
and Margaret Thatcher are just a few of the distinguished alumni who’ve
taken degrees here. Even Bill Clinton studied at Oxford.
Although academically oriented, Oxford is far from dull. Its long sweep
of a main street (High Street, known as “The High”) buzzes with a cosmo-
politan mix of locals, students, black-gowned dons, and foreign visitors.
You can tour some of the beautiful historic colleges, each sequestered
away within its own quadrangle (or quad) built around an interior court-
yard; stroll along the lovely Cherwell River; and visit the Ashmolean
Museum.
Getting there and taking a tour
Oxford is a comfortable day trip from London. Trains depart hourly from
London’s Paddington Station, take just over an hour, and cost £16 ($32)
for a round-trip “cheap day return” ticket.
The Oxford Information Centre, 15–16 Broad St. (% 01865-726-871;
www.visitoxford.org), conducts two-hour walking tours of the town
and its major colleges (but not New College or Christ Church). Tours leave
daily at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., with additional walks on Saturday at 10:30 a.m.
and 1 p.m.; the cost is £6.50 ($13) adults, £3 ($6) children 5 to 15.
City Sightseeing (% 01708-864-340; www.citysightseeing.co.uk)
offers a one-hour bus tour (£9.50/$19) with hop-on/hop-off service.
Buses depart daily from the train station starting at 9:30 a.m. and run
every 15 to 20 minutes until 5 or 6 p.m., depending on the season.
Seeing the sights
Oxford University (% 01865-270-000; www.ox.ac.uk) doesn’t have just
one, but 45 widely dispersed colleges serving some 16,000 students.
Instead of trying to see them all (impossible in a day), focus on seeing 
a handful of the better-known ones. Faced with an overabundance of
tourists, the colleges have restricted visiting to certain hours and to
groups of six or fewer; in some areas, you aren’t allowed in at all. Before
heading off, check with the tourist office to find out when and what col-
leges you can visit, or take their excellent walking tour.
A good way to start your tour is with a bird’s-eye view of the colleges
from the top of Carfax Tower (% 01865-792-653) in the center of the
city. The tower is all that remains from St. Martin’s Church, where
William Shakespeare stood as godfather for a fellow playwright. The
Part III: The British Isles 
158

tower is open November through March daily from 10:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.,
and April through October from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is £2 ($4)
adults, £1 ($2) children 5 to 15.
The Oxford Story, 6 Broad St. (% 01865-790-055), packages Oxford’s
complexities into a concise and entertaining exhibit-cum-ride that takes
you through 800 years of the city’s history, reviewing some of the architec-
tural and historical features that you may otherwise miss. It also fills you
in on the backgrounds of the colleges and those people who’ve passed
through their portals. Admission costs £7.25 ($15) for adults. The exhibit
is open July and August daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and September
through June daily from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (from 11 a.m. on Sun).
We recommend visits to the following three colleges:
 Christ Church College (% 01865-276-150), facing St. Aldate’s Street,
was begun by Cardinal Wolsey in 1525. Christ Church has the largest
quadrangle of any college in Oxford and a chapel with 15th-century
pillars and impressive fan vaulting. Tom Tower houses Great Tom,
the 18,000-pound bell that rings nightly at 9:05 p.m., signaling the
closing of the college gates. The college and chapel are open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 5:30 p.m.
Admission is £4.90 ($9.80).
 Magdalen (pronounced Maud-lin) College, on High Street (% 01865-
276-000), founded in 1458, boasts the oldest botanical garden in
England and the most extensive grounds of any Oxford college; you
even find a deer park. The 15th-century bell tower, one of the town’s
most famous landmarks, is reflected in the waters of the Cherwell
River. You can cross a small footbridge and stroll through the water
meadows along the path known as Addison’s Walk. October through
June, the college is open daily from 1 p.m. to dusk; July and August,
it’s open daily noon to 6 p.m. Admission is £3 ($6).
 Merton College (% 01865-276-310), dating from 1264, stands near
Merton Street, the only medieval cobbled street left in Oxford. The
college is noted for its 14th-century library, said to be the oldest
college library in England (admission is £1/$2). On display is an
astrolabe (an astronomical instrument used for measuring the alti-
tude of the sun and stars) thought to have belonged to Chaucer. The
library and college are open Monday through Friday 2 to 4 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; both close for a week at
Easter and at Christmas.
East of Carfax is the famed Bodleian Library, Broad Street (% 01865-
277-000), the world’s oldest library, established in 1450. The Radcliffe
Camera, the domed building just south of the Bodleian, is the library’s
reading room, dating from 1737. You can visit parts of the library on a
one-hour guided tour (daily at 10:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 2 p.m., and 3 p.m.;
£6/$12); call or stop in at the Bodleian bookstore for details.

American Express
You can find Amex foreign exchanges in
terminals 3 and 4 at Heathrow (% 020-
8759-6845) and in London at 78 Brompton
Rd., Knightsbridge SW3 (% 020-7761-7905).
Area Code
The country code for the United Kingdom is
44. The city code for most of Greater London
is 020. Many businesses instead use the
new, non-geographical code of 0870. When
dialing either from abroad, drop the initial 0.
To call London from the United States, dial
011-44-20, and then the local number. See
also “Telephone,” later in this section.
Currency
Britain has so far opted out of adopting the
euro. The basic unit of currency is the
pound sterling (£), divided into 100 pence
(p). There are 1p, 2p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and
£2 coins; banknotes are issued in £5, £10,
£20, and £50.
The rate of exchange used to calculate the
dollar values given in this chapter is $1 =
50p (or £1 = $2). Amounts over $10 have
been rounded to the nearest dollar.
Doctors and Dentists
Most hotels have physicians on call. Medical
Express, 117A Harley St., W1 (% 020-7499-
1991; Tube: Oxford Circus), is a private clinic
with walk-in medical service (no appoint-
ment necessary) Monday through Friday 
9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday 10 a.m. to 
2 p.m. Dental Emergency Care Service, Guy’s

Britain’s best. The impressive painting collection features works by
Bellini, Raphael, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Picasso. The museum is
open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from
2 to 5 p.m.; admission is free.
Where to stay
You can hole up for the night at the Mercure Eastgate Townhouse, 23
Merton St., The High (% 0118-971-4700; www.mercure.uk.com), origi-
nally a 17th-century coaching inn. The hotel is near the river, close 
to most of the colleges, with modern doubles going for £99 to £119
($198–$238) with breakfast.
Where to dine
Browns, 5–11 Woodstock Rd. (% 01865-319-655), a large, casual, upbeat
brasserie, is one of the best places to eat in Oxford. It serves hearty food,
including a good traditional cream tea, and has a large convivial bar and a
very pleasant outdoor terrace. Main courses run from £7 to £16 ($14–$32).
If you don’t want to spend a lot for lunch, stop in at Mortons, 22 Broad St.
(% 01865-200-860). They make delicious sandwiches on fresh baguettes
and serve a daily soup; open daily 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The main Tourist Information Centre, Britain
& London Visitor Centre, 1 Lower Regent St.,
Piccadilly Circus, SW1 (Tube: Piccadilly
Circus), provides tourist information to walk-
in visitors Monday 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
Tuesday through Friday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.,
and Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

London information, call % 0870-156-6366.
The London Information Centre in Leicester
Square is open late seven days a week. See
“Finding information after you arrive,” ear-
lier in this chapter.
Online you can get information at the
national Visit Britain site (www.visit
britain.org) and Visit London’s site
(www.visitlondon.com).
Internet Access and Cybercafes
The easyInternetCafe shops (www.easy
internetcafe.com), located all over
London and open daily from 8 or 9 a.m. to 
11 p.m. or midnight, offer hundreds of termi-
nals and charge the lowest rates in town —
£1 ($2) per hour. Branches include 456–459
The Strand, just off Trafalgar Square,
across from Charing Cross Station (Tube:
Charing Cross); 9–13 Wilton Rd., opposite
Victoria Station (Tube: Victoria); 9–16
Tottenham Court Rd. (Tube: Tottenham Court
Road or Goodge); and 43 Regent St., in the
Burger King on Picadilly Circus (Tube:
Picadilly Circus).
Maps
The London A to Z (the Z is pronounced
“zed”) is a widely available street atlas that
maps every teensy alleyway, mews, close,
and street in all of London. Makes a great
souvenir, too.
Newspapers and Magazines
The best way to find out what’s going on
around town, from shows to restaurants to
events, is to buy a copy of the Time Out
London magazine, published every Tuesday
and available at newsstands. You can also
get listings from Time Out London’s com-
petitor, What’s On, as well as from the
Evening Standard.
Pharmacies
Boots (www.boots.com) is the largest
chain of London chemists (drugstores). You
find them located all over London. They’re
generally open Monday through Saturday
from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from
noon to 5 p.m.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999 from any
phone; no money is needed.
Post Office
The most central post office is the Trafalgar
Square branch at 24–28 William IV St. 
(% 020-7930-9580), open Monday through
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Other
post offices and sub-post offices (window
newsagent stores) are open Monday
through Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and

Saturday 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Look for red
POST OFFICE signs outside.
Safety
Security in the London Underground was
dramatically increased following the 2005
terrorist attacks. In general, London is a
safe city. As in any large metropolis, use
common sense and normal caution when
you’re in a crowded public area or walking
alone at night. The area around Euston
Station has more purse snatchings than
anywhere else in London.
Taxes
In England, a 17.5 percent value-added tax
(VAT) is figured into the price of most items.
Foreign visitors can reclaim a percentage
of the VAT on major purchases of consumer
goods (see Chapter 4 for more about this).
Taxis
See the “Getting Around London” section,
earlier in this chapter.
Telephone
London has three kinds of pay phones —
one that accepts only coins; the Cardphone,
which takes only phone cards; and one that
accepts both phone cards and credit cards.
The minimum charge for a local call is 20p
(40¢) for 55 seconds. Stick to small coins at
coin-operated phones because they don’t
make change. Phone cards are sold at
newsstands and post offices in amounts
varying from £3 ($6) to £20 ($40). Credit card
pay phones accept the usual credit cards —
Visa, MasterCard, American Express — but
the minimum charge is 50p ($1); insert the
card and dial 144. For directory assistance,
dial 192 for the United Kingdom or 153 for
international; for operator-assisted calls,
dial 100 for the United Kingdom or 155 for
international.
To call the United States direct from
London, dial 001 followed by the area code
and phone number. To charge a call to your
calling card or make a collect call home,
dial AT&T (% 0800-890-011 or 0500-890-
011), MCI (% 0800-279-5088), or Sprint 
(% 0800-890-877 or 0500-890-877). See 
also “Area Code,” earlier in this section.

E
dinburgh is an attractive city full of distinguished architecture and
devoted to the fine arts. Called the “Athens of the North,” partly
because of its renowned university and intellectual life (Sir Walter Scott
and Robert Burns lived here, and Robert Louis Stevenson is a native
son) and partly because some neoclassical ruins top one of its hills,
Edinburgh’s history lends it an air of old-fashioned romance. But don’t
be fooled. The city is also a modern, international business destination
and enjoys some of the most happening nightlife in Britain. Edinburgh
(ed-in-bur-ah) is a cultural capital of Europe and hosts a performing arts
blowout every August called the Edinburgh International Festival (see
“More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter). It also serves as
a gateway to the fabled, heather-clad Highlands. It’s possible to tour
Edinburgh in a day, but it really deserves two or three.
The Scots are a proud people with a long, turbulent history. Although
Scotland is incorporated into the United Kingdom, the Scots are fiercely
independent and increasingly autonomous. Use the word Scotch only to
describe the whisky, the broth, or the prevailing northern mist. Calling a
person Scotch is considered an insult. Refer to the locals here as Scots or
Scottish.
Getting There
Scotland borders England to the north, so if you’re coming to Edinburgh
from London, the best choices are a quick one-hour flight or a scenic
five-hour train ride that lets you off right in the middle of town.

Arriving by air
Edinburgh Airport (% 0870-040-0007; www.edinburghairport.com) 
is just 10km (6 miles) west of town and handles flights from all over
Great Britain and major cities on the Continent (including Amsterdam,
Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris, Madrid, and Zurich). The airport is small and
quite manageable. The information desk is located in the arrivals hall. To
get into the city, you can take the Airlink 100 bus (% 0131-555-6363;
www.flybybus.com), which leaves every ten minutes or so (every 30
minutes at night when the bus follows a slightly different route) for the
25-minute trip to downtown’s Waverley Station. One-way fare is £3 ($6);
round-trip is £5 ($10). You can buy tickets at the airport Airlink desk or
onboard the bus. A 20-minute taxi ride from the airport to Edinburgh
runs about £18 ($36). The taxi rank (stand) is to the left outside the
arrivals hall.
Arriving by train or bus
Fast trains link London with Edinburgh’s Waverley Station, at the east 
end of Princes Street. All trains depart from London King’s Cross Station,
except for the overnight train, which departs from London Euston. The
journey takes 41⁄2 hours during the day; overnight trains take 71⁄4 hours and
have couchettes. Coaches (the term for buses here) from London cost less,
but they take eight hours and arrive at a bus depot on St. Andrew Square.
Orienting Yourself in Edinburgh
Edinburgh is a port town of sorts; its outskirts rest on the Firth of Forth,
an inlet of the North Sea. The center of town is an ancient volcanic out-
crop crowned by Edinburgh Castle. Due east of the castle is Waverley
Station. Princes Street Gardens stretches between the two and effec-
tively divides the city into the Old Town to the south and the gridlike
New Town to the north.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Hotels and shops fill New Town, developed in the 18th century. The major
east–west streets of New Town are Princes Street, bordering the gardens
named after it, and George Street, which runs parallel to Princes Street 
2 blocks north.
The Royal Mile, the main thoroughfare of the Old Town, spills off the
castle’s mount and runs downhill to the east. It’s a single road, but 
the Royal Mile carries several names: Lawnmarket, High Street, and
Canongate. Farther to the south is the University District, one of the 
hot spots for Edinburgh’s famed nightlife.
Finding information after you arrive
Edinburgh’s tourist office (see the “Fast Facts: Edinburgh” section at the
end of this chapter) is an excellent resource.

Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 165
Getting Around Edinburgh
Because historic Edinburgh is not a big area, you can walk most of it
easily. But if you plan to travel across town to catch a show or see a
sight, consider hopping a bus or hailing a cab.
By bus
City buses (% 0131-555-6363; www.lothianbuses.co.uk) are cheap
and offer quick access to the residential districts that surround the city

center (where you find the more inexpensive hotels and B&Bs). On
Edinburgh buses, you pay a £1 ($2) flat fare (60p/$1.20 children 5–15) 
for any distance traveled; drop exact change in the slot. Night buses cost
£2 ($4).
The Dayticket costs £2.50 ($5) for adults and £2 ($4) for children for a
full day of unlimited rides. Purchase tickets from the driver as you
board, but be sure to have the correct change.
By taxi
You can reach Edinburgh’s tourist sights easily on foot, but a taxi may 
be useful if you’re traveling longer distances or carrying luggage. Hail 
a cab or find one at a taxi rank at Hanover Street, Waverley Station, or
Haymarket Station. To call a taxi, dial % 0131-229-2468 or 0131-228-1211.
Taxi fares start at £1.50 ($3) or £2.50 ($5) at night, and go up in 25p (50¢)
increments every 45 seconds or 445 meters (1⁄4 mile).
By foot
Edinburgh is an easily walked city, and most of the sights listed in this
chapter won’t take you too far from the city’s center. An especially pleas-
ant walk is down the Royal Mile (see “Exploring Edinburgh,” later in this
chapter).
Staying in Edinburgh
Edinburgh hotels are not cheap, and they all charge three different rates:
off-season, high season, and festival season (the annual Edinburgh
International Festival — see “More cool things to see and do,” later in
this chapter). If you don’t book well in advance for festival time, you
probably won’t find a room, at least not anywhere near the city center.
Even if you do book in advance, staying near the city center during the
festival costs more than double the off-season price.
Luckily, Edinburgh has many pleasant suburbs no more than 20 minutes
by bus from the center of town — neighborhoods where the rooms cost
less year-round and where you can find some of the only available space
during the festival. Inexpensive guesthouses fill one such area, around
Dalkeith Road between Holyrood Park and the Meadows, just a ten-
minute bus ride south of the Old Town.
The tourist office has a booklet listing local B&Bs and guesthouses, and
the staff can help you find room in one or space in a regular hotel for a
small fee.
For general tips on booking and what to expect from European accom-
modations, see Chapter 7.

Edinburgh’s top hotels and B&Bs
Balmoral Hotel
$$$$$
New Town
Edinburgh’s oldest luxury hotel is a 1902 city landmark with a clock tower,
where kilted doormen welcome you to a slightly contrived Scottish expe-
rience. The Rocco Forte chain recently refurbished the hotel, and the large
rooms are now outfitted in a Victorian-meets-contemporary-comfort style,
discreetly cushy and with full amenities. The Michelin-starred Number One
restaurant is refined and highly recommended for international cuisine, as
is the modern brasserie-style Hadrian’s. You can take afternoon tea in the
Palm Court after a workout in the gym, a trip to the spa or sauna, or a dip
in the indoor pool. The rack rates are exorbitant, so be certain to check the
hotel’s Web site for special offers and packages.
See map p. 168. 1 Princes St. (at the east end of the street, practically on top of the
train station). % 800-225-5843 in the U.S. or 0131-556-2414. Fax: 0131-557-3747.
www.thebalmoralhotel.com. Bus: 3, 3A, 4, 8, 15, 26, 30, 31, 33, or 44 (but if you’re
arriving by train, you’re already there). Rack rates: £345–£510 ($690–$1,020) double.
Full Scottish breakfast £19 ($38); continental breakfast £14 ($28). AE, DC, MC, V.
Bank Hotel
$$–$$$
Old Town
This unusual hotel is located right in the heart of Old Town and offers
better value than all of its competitors along the Royal Mile. Built in 1923
as a branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland, it now offers a handful of indi-
vidually decorated theme rooms (each named for a famous Scotsman)
above Logie Baird’s Bar, a lively ground-floor bar and restaurant. You’ll find
delightful touches throughout, and the bathrooms are as nice and com-
fortable as the rooms.
See map p. 168. Royal Mile at 1–3 S. Bridge St. % 0131-622-6800. Fax: 0131-622-6822.
www.festival-inns.co.uk. Bus: 4, 15, 31, or 100. Rack rates: £85–£125
($170–$250) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
The Bonham
$$$–$$$$
New Town
Style is pumped up to a very high level at this New Town hotel occupying
three Victorian town houses. The high-ceilinged, large-windowed guest
rooms feature the best of contemporary furnishings against a bold palette
of colors. Beds are huge and bathrooms as fine as you’ll find. The hotel is
very techno-friendly and every room has its own communication and
entertainment center. The Restaurant at the Bonham offers fine dining.
See map p. 168. 35 Drumsheugh Gardens. % 0131-226-6050. Fax: 0131-226-6080.
www.thebonham.com. Bus: 41 or 42. Rack rates: £110–£250 ($220–$500) double.
Rates include full Scottish breakfast. AE, MC, V.

Christopher North House Hotel
$$–$$$$
New Town
Christopher North, a famous and colorful figure in 19th-century Edinburgh,
lived in this neoclassical town house from 1826 to 1854. The dramatic stair-
case and glass-roofed foyer ceiling are original, and the red-flocked hall-
way wallpaper re-creates a Victorian splendor, but the room furnishings
are modern and the décor full of dramatic accents. Some of the rooms 
are rather small; suites are large and comfortably luxurious. Bathrooms
throughout are ample and well equipped. Bacchus, the hotel’s intimate
restaurant, is one of Edinburgh’s best-kept secrets.
See map p. 168. 6 Gloucester Place. % 0131-225-2720. Fax: 0131-220-4706. www.
christophernorth.co.uk. Bus: 19 or 80 to North West Circus Place. Rack rates:
£98–£198 ($196–$296) double. Rates include full breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Dalhousie Castle
$$$–$$$$$
Bonnyrigg
Staying right in charming Edinburgh is convenient, but you can travel just
outside the town to find a 15th-century castle that offers all the medieval
romance that you expect to find in Scotland. Henry IV, Sir Walter Scott, and
Queen Victoria all resided at Dalhousie Castle, before it was renovated to
provide luxurious, modern comforts. The castle’s sylvan setting beside a
flowing stream appeals to romantic and to outdoorsy types alike. The hotel
organizes salmon and trout fishing, shooting, and horseback riding expe-
ditions. Try the Dungeon Restaurant for a unique dining experience. The
novelty of staying in a castle is usually a big hit with kids. Children 11 and
under stay free in parent’s room.
See map p. 168. Bonnyrigg (13km/8 miles southeast of Edinburgh). % 01875-820-153.
Fax: 01875-821-936. www.dalhousiecastle.co.uk. By car: Take the A7 13km (8
miles) southeast of Edinburgh toward Carlisle and turn right onto B704; the castle is
just outside the village of Bonnyrigg. Rack rates: £135–£330 ($270–$660) double. Rates
include full Scottish breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
The Howard
$$$$–$$$$$
New Town
Classic elegance, impeccable service, and gorgeous furnishings combine
to make this one of Edinburgh’s finest small deluxe hotels. Occupying
three Georgian terrace houses, the Howard is refined but relaxed about it.
The spacious guest rooms are impeccable, the bathrooms fabulous (some
have free-standing “roll-top” Georgian-style bathtubs). Your dedicated
butler is on call 24/7.
See map p. 168. 34 Great King St. % 0131-550-3500. Fax: 0131-557-6515. Bus: 13, 23,

Sheraton Grand Hotel & Spa
$$$$$
New Town
A short walk from Princes Street, this upscale hotel has one of Europe’s
greatest spas attached to it. The spacious, traditionally furnished guest
rooms are extremely comfortable and have nice bathrooms; the castle-
view rooms on the top floors are the best. Very fine dining is available in
the Grill Room; traditional afternoon tea is served in the graciously
appointed hotel bar, called The Exchange. What really makes this hotel
stand out, however, is the new and superlatively equipped spa, which con-
tains a state-of-the-art gym, gorgeous indoor and outdoor pools, steam
room and sauna, and a complete array of spa treatments. Children 12 and

This centrally located budget hotel beneath the castle has
reasonably priced rooms, which range from adequate to extra large, and

Radisson SAS Hotel Edinburgh
$$$–$$$$
Old Town
The almost castlelike Radisson — formerly a
Crowne Plaza — looks centuries older than its 15 years, due to Edinburgh’s
strict zoning rules for the Royal Mile. The hotel has smallish, amenity-filled
rooms and a stellar location, plus a health club, pool, and restaurant (appe-
tizing international cuisine in a dull subterranean environment). See map

Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 171

Dining in Edinburgh
Edinburgh boasts the finest restaurants in Scotland. You’ll find an array
of top restaurants serving Scottish, French, Modern European, and
ethnic cuisines. The Scottish–French culinary connection dates back to
the time of Mary Queen of Scots, though it’s been much refined over the
centuries. More and more restaurants are catering to vegetarians, too.
Some of the dishes Edinburgh is known for include fresh salmon and
seafood, game from Scottish fields, and Aberdeen Angus steaks. What’s
the rage at lunch? Stuffed jacket potatoes (baked potatoes with a variety
of stuffings) are popular, but you can also get good sandwiches at coffee
bars on the Royal Mile and in other locations around central Edinburgh.
At a Scottish high tea, you can sample freshly baked scones alongside
some of the best fresh jams (especially raspberry), heather honeys, and
marmalades in Europe. Also excellent are Scottish cheeses — look in
particular for cheddars; the creamy, oatmeal-coated Caboc; and cottage
cheeses.
The Atrium
$$$$
New Town
MODERN SCOTTISH/INTERNATIONAL
This stylish, award-winning restaurant next to the Traverse Theatre has
been one of the top dining spots in Edinburgh since 1993. The menu draws
inspiration from Scotland and all over the world. The offerings change daily
but may include roast pumpkin soup; wild mushroom, truffle, and artichoke
risotto; pan-fried halibut; or filet of Aberdeen Angus beef. Rosemary crème
brûlée with mascarpone sorbet is one delectable dessert worth trying.
Upstairs, the Atrium’s sister restaurant, Blue (% 131-221-1222; www.blue

Have you had your haggis today?
Scotland’s national “dish” is the infamous haggis, a fat, cantaloupe-size sausage tra-
ditionally made from sheep lungs, liver, and hearts mixed with spices, suet, oatmeal,
and onions (there are newer vegetarian versions, too). Haggis smells horrible, but if
you’re looking for an authentic taste of Scotland, try it — if only once. Charles
MacSween and Son, Dryden Road (% 0131-440-2555), is the city’s most time-honored
purveyor.

David Bann Vegetarian Restaurant & Bar

New Town
VEGETARIAN
All the current trends in vegetarian cooking are wonderfully summarized
in this hip vegetarian restaurant around the corner from the new Scottish
Parliament building. With its stylish décor and smooth jazzy background,
it’s a place where you want to linger. The chef creates vegetarian dishes
inspired and influenced by the foods of India, China, and the Mediter-
ranean. This is a good spot to come for a meatless Sunday brunch.

Deacon Brodie’s Tavern
$$
Old Town
SCOTTISH/PUB GRUB
This tavern, established in 1806, is a favorite among the locals and tourists
who are drawn to the old pub atmosphere, the good food, and the unusual
story of its namesake, whose life inspired R. L. Stevenson to write The
Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. A respectable city councilor and
inventor by day, Brodie was a thief and murderer by night. In 1788, his dark
side caught up with him, and after a trial, he was hanged on a gibbet he
helped to perfect. Morbid history aside, the tavern serves decent pub food
on the ground floor, but head upstairs to the wood-lined restaurant, where
you may want a second helping of the beef steak pie (a variant on shep-
herd’s pie).

between 1470 and 1722. The chef uses creative flair to create unfussy
Scottish food, such as filet of Aberdeen Angus beef, pheasant, grilled hal-
ibut, and — most delectable and expensive of all — a platter of Scottish
seafood and crustaceans with oysters, langoustines, clams, mussels, crab,
smoked salmon, and lobster. For dessert, sample the passion fruit and
mascarpone trifle or the warmed bitter chocolate torte. Some 550 wines
and 40 malt whiskies are available.

Exploring Edinburgh
With the exception of the National Gallery, you’ll find most of Edinburgh’s
most popular sights concentrated in Old Town, the rocky outcropping
that overlooks the rest of the city.
Edinburgh’s top sights
Edinburgh Castle
Old Town
No place in Scotland is filled with as much history, legend, and lore as
Edinburgh Castle. Its early history is vague, but it’s known that in the 11th
century, Malcolm III (Canmore) and his Saxon queen, later venerated as
St. Margaret, founded a castle on this spot. The oldest structure in
Edinburgh is St. Margaret’s Chapel, a small stone structure on the castle
grounds dating from the 12th century.
The somber and sparsely furnished State Apartments include Queen
Mary’s Bedroom, where Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to James VI of
Scotland (later James I of England). Scottish Parliaments used to convene
in the Great Hall. For most visitors, the highlight is the Crown Chamber,
housing the Honours of Scotland (Scottish Crown Jewels), used at the
coronation of James VI, along with the scepter and sword of the state of
Scotland. The storerooms known as the French Prisons were used to
incarcerate captured French soldiers during the Napoleonic wars. Many
of them made wall carvings still visible today.
See map p. 168. Castlehill. % 0131-225-9846. www.historic-scotland.gov.
uk. Bus: 23, 27, 28, 41, or 42. Admission: £11 ($22) adults, £9 ($18) seniors, £5.50 ($11)
children. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Last
admission 45 minutes before close.
Museum of Scotland
Old Town
Scotland’s premier museum, built of pale Scottish sandstone, opened in
1998 to house the nation’s greatest national treasures. There are many
Part III: The British Isles 
174

beautiful objects on display here, but the museum in some ways over-
whelms the collections. Highlights include wonderful examples of ancient
jewelry displayed in modern sculptures by Sir Eduardo Paolozzi; the
Trappan treasure horde of silver objects found buried in East Lothian; the
12th-century Lewis chessmen; and, gruesomely, the “Maiden,” an early
guillotine. The roof terrace has great views of the city.
Chambers Street. % 0131-247-4422. www.nms.ac.uk. Bus: 23, 27, 28, 41, 42.
Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Tues); Sun noon to 5 p.m.
National Gallery of Scotland
Princes Street Gardens
This honey-colored neoclassical temple houses one of the best midsize art
museums in Europe, hung with a well-chosen selection of Old Masters and
Impressionist masterpieces. Spend a morning (or at least half of one) here
in the company of Rembrandt, Rubens, Andrea del Sarto, Raphael, Titian,
Velázquez, El Greco, Monet, Degas, Gainsborough, and van Gogh. You may
find yourself pleasantly surprised by the many works of largely unknown
Scottish artists.
See map p. 168. 2 The Mound (in the center of Princes Street Gardens, behind the
train station). % 0131-624-6200 or 0131-332-2266. www.nationalgalleries.
org. Bus: 23, 27, 28, 41, 42, or 45. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 
7 p.m. Thurs).
Palace of Holyroodhouse
Old Town
The royal palace of Scotland was originally the guesthouse of a 12th-cen-
tury abbey (now in ruins). Of James V’s 16th-century palace, only the north
tower — rich with memories of his daughter, the political pawn Mary Queen
of Scots — remains. You can see a plaque where Mary’s court secretary
Riccio was murdered by her dissolute husband and his cronies, and some
of the queen’s needlework is on display. Most of the palace was built in the
late 17th century. Although Prince Charles held his roving court here at one
time, the palace was only recently restored after years of neglect; it opened
in November 2002. A quick visit takes about 45 minutes. Admission is by
timed entry and includes an audio guide. You must book ahead of your visit.
Behind Holyroodhouse begins Holyrood Park, Edinburgh’s largest. With
rocky crags, a loch, sweeping meadows, and the ruins of a chapel, it’s a wee
bit of the Scottish countryside in the city, and a great place for a picnic.
From the park, you can climb up a treeless, heather-covered crag, called
Arthur’s Seat, for breathtaking panoramas of the city and the Firth of Forth.
See map p. 168. Canongate (east end of the Royal Mile). % 0131-556-5100 for
required reservations. www.royalcollection.org.uk. Bus: 35 or 64. Admission:
£9.80 ($20) adults, £8.80 ($18) seniors, £5.80 ($12) children under 17. Open: Mid-Mar
to Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov to mid-Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. Last admission
45 minutes before close. Closed for parts of May, June, and July (see Web site for
exact dates), and Dec 25–26.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 175

The Royal Mile
Old Town
Walking down the Royal Mile — the main drag of the Old Town that
changes names from Lawnmarket to High Street to Canongate — takes you
from Edinburgh Castle on the west end, downhill to the Palace of
Holyroodhouse on the east. The various small museums of the Royal Mile
tend to be open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (a few
stay open until 7:30 p.m. in summer and are open Sun from noon to 5 p.m.).
Some museums along the Royal Mile are free, but the ones listed below
charge admission ranging from £1 to £8.95 ($2–$18). Simply strolling the
Royal Mile from one end to the other takes 20 to 30 minutes. Add in
another 20 to 30 minutes for each stop you want to make along the way.
Begin your mile tour at the Scotch Whisky Experience, 354 Castlehill 
(% 0131-220-0441; www.whisky-heritage.co.uk), where you find out
all that you could possibly want to know about the making of single malts.
The tour is expensive and somewhat cheesy, but you get to down a dram
(or a soft drink) as part of your tour.
Across the street, housed in Outlook Tower, is Camera Obscura and
World of Illusions (% 0131-226-3709; www.camera-obscura.co.uk).
From the top of the tower, the live image of Edinburgh that you see pro-
jected by the camera obscura onto a white surface has been famous for
over 150 years. The exhibits are updated to include modern advances in
optics, such as laser holography.
At 477B Lawnmarket, Gladstone’s Land (% 0131-226-5856; www.nts.
org.uk) is a restored 17th-century home (open mid-Mar to Oct only). A
nearby alley leads to Lady Stair’s House, home to the Writer’s Museum
(% 0131-529-4901; www.cac.org.uk), which celebrates the lives and
works of Scotland’s three great scribes: Burns, Scott, and Stevenson.
Briefly a cathedral in the past, the High Kirk of St. Giles (% 0131-225-
9442; www.stgiles.net) has changed so much over the ages that today
the main draw is the Thistle Chapel, built onto the church’s corner in 1911.
The fiery John Knox, leader of the Scottish Reformation and perpetual
antagonist to Mary Queen of Scots, served as the church’s minister from
1559 to 1572.
Supposedly Knox lived a few doors down at 43–45 High St., although no
actual historical evidence supports this theory. The John Knox House
(% 0131-556-9579) is the only 16th-century building with projecting upper
floors still existing on the Royal Mile.
Across the street at no. 42 is the Museum of Childhood (% 0131-529-
4142; www.cac.org.uk), a museum full of toys from Victorian to recent
times. Patrick Murray founded the museum even though he was a confirmed
bachelor who insisted he was opening a museum of social science, not a
romper room for kids — whom he reportedly detested.
As the Royal Mile becomes Canongate, you pass at no. 142 the Museum of
Edinburgh (% 0131-529-4143; www.cac.org.uk). It resides in a restored
Part III: The British Isles 
176

16th-century house filled with period rooms and collections detailing
Edinburgh’s past. Across the street is the clock-faced 1591 Canongate
Tollbooth, a one-time council room, law court, and prison, now housing
the People’s Story Museum (% 0131-529-4057; www.cac.org.uk), an
exhibit on working life in Edinburgh from the 18th century to today.
The Royal Yacht Britannia
Leith
Used by Queen Elizabeth II and the royal family from 1952 until it was
decommissioned in 1997, this luxurious 124m (412-ft.) yacht is berthed in
Leith (3km/2 miles from Edinburgh’s center) and open to the public. You
reach the famous vessel by going through a shopping mall to a visitor
center, where you collect a portable audio guide keyed to the major state-
rooms and working areas on all five decks. You can walk the decks where
Prince Charles and Princess Diana strolled on their honeymoon, visit the
drawing room and the little-changed Royal Apartments, and explore the
engine room, the galleys, and the captain’s cabin. An air of the 1950s still
permeates the yacht. Give yourself at least an hour. It’s fascinating.
Ocean Terminal, Leith. % 0131-555-5566. www.royalyachtbritannia.co.uk.
Bus: 11, 22, 34, 35, 36, or 49. Admission: £9.75 ($20) adults, £7.75 ($16) seniors, £5.75
($12) children 5–15, £28 ($56) families (2 adults, 3 children). Open: Apr–Oct daily 
9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar daily 10 a.m.–3:30 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 Donning a kilt: Thinking of sizing yourself for a kilt? The Highlander’s
dress used to be a 5m-long (16-ft.) plaid scarf wrapped around and
around to make a skirt, with the excess thrown across the chest and
up over the shoulder. After an 18th-century ban on the wearing of
such traditional clan tartans, kilts became a fierce symbol of Scottish
pride, and an industry was born. Today, a handmade kilt with all its
accessories can run you well upwards of £500 ($1,000), but even if a
tartan scarf or tie is more your stripe, the Tartan Gift Shop, 54 High
St. (% 0131-558-3187), can help you identify your clan (or one close
enough) and match you to one of its traditional tartans.
 Visiting a few old Edinburgh haunts: The most entertaining walks
around the city are led after dark by the “dead” guides working for
Witchery Tours (% 0131-225-6745; www.witcherytours.com).
Each guide wears a costume representing an officially deceased
Edinburgher whose ghost haunts this city. Your spirit guide leads
you on a sometimes spooky, often goofy, and occasionally educa-
tional 90-minute tiptoe around the city’s key historical and leg-
endary spots. Called “Ghosts and Gore” and “Murder and Mayhem,”
the tours cost £7.50 ($15) for adults, £5 ($10) for children, and must
be reserved in advance.
 Witnessing the penguin parade at the zoo: From April to September,
at 2 p.m. daily, the Edinburgh Zoo, 134 Corstorphine Rd. 
(% 0131-334-9171; www.edinburghzoo.org.uk; Bus: 12, 26, or
Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 177

31), herds the largest penguin colony in Europe out of its enclosure
to run a few laps around a grassy park. Don’t miss the gorillas,
either (or the great view that stretches to the Firth of Forth).
 Sampling the city’s pubs and nightlife: Edinburgh is an unsung
nightlife capital, with a lively performing arts and theater scene
year-round. More nighttime fun can be had at dance clubs, such 
as the always-trendy Buster Browns, 25 Market St. (% 0131-226-
4224), and the Bongo Club, 37 Holyrood Rd. (% #0131-558-7604).
The city is saturated with pubs and bars, especially in the Old
Town around Grassmarket (Black Bull, no. 12; % 0131-225-6636),
Candlemaker Row (Greyfriars Bobby’s Bar, no. 34; % 0131-225-
8328), and other university-area streets. In New Town, the slightly
run-down Rose Street has a good row of pubs (try Kenilworth, no.
152; % 0131-226-1773). Toss back a pint of bitter or set up your
own tasting marathon of wee drams of single-malt Scotch whisky —
the night is yours.
For a more archetypal Scottish evening, you can either go with the
hokey or the traditional. A bagpipe-playing, kilt-swirling Scottish
Folk Evening is staged at big hotels such as the Carlton Highland or
King James. A less forced ceilidh (kay-lee — a folk-music jam ses-
sion) happens nightly at the Tron Tavern, on South Bridge, or at
any of the musical pubs listed in the Gig (available at newsstands
and in pubs).
 Attending the famous Edinburgh festivals: Every August, Scotland’s
capital celebrates two to three weeks of theater, opera, arts, dance,
music, poetry, prose, and even traditional culture (the bagpiping
Military Tattoo parade uses the floodlit castle as a backdrop) during
the Edinburgh International Festival, headquarters at The Hub on
the Royal Mile on Castlehill (% 0131-473-2000 or 0131-473-2001;
www.eif.co.uk).
The festival has also spawned multiple minifestivals, including cele-
brations that center on jazz, film, television, and books, and the
famous Fringe Festival, headquartered at 180 High St. (% 0131-
226-0026; www.edfringe.com), also held in August and offering
hundreds of new plays and theater acts in every conceivable space
around the city.
Guided tours
Lothian Buses (% 0131-555-6363; www.lothianbuses.co.uk) runs a
fleet of double-deckers around the major Edinburgh sights; a full-day
ticket for the Edinburgh Tour lets you hop on and off at any of two dozen
stops. You can get tickets (valid for 24 hours) for the tour bus — £9
($18) adults, £8 ($16) seniors and students, £3 ($6) children — at the
starting point, Waverley Station. The same prices apply for the City
Sightseeing Tour (% 0131-220-0770; www.guidefriday.com), which
covers much the same ground, year-round, on a 60-minute tour. You can
hop on at Waverley Bridge, Lothian Road, Royal Mile, Grassmarket, or
Princes Street.
Part III: The British Isles 
178

But perhaps the best way to see Edinburgh with a guide is to join one of
the walking tours described in the “More cool things to see and do” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this section
offers some tips for building your own Edinburgh itineraries.
If you have one day
Start your early morning admiring Old Masters and Scottish Impression-
ists in the National Gallery of Scotland. Cross The Mound and climb
Lawnmarket/Castlehill to glowering Edinburgh Castle. Tour the bits you
like, and then start making your way down the Royal Mile, popping into
the sights and shops that catch your fancy and stopping for a late
Scottish lunch at Witchery by the Castle or, if your purse strings are
tighter, Deacon Brodie’s Tavern. Finish up with the Royal Mile in time 
to meet the Witchery Tours guide for 90 minutes of “Ghosts & Gore.”
Spend the evening hopping from pub to pub, with a pause to dine at 
Le Sept.
If you have two days
Begin Day 1 exploring Edinburgh’s single greatest sight: Edinburgh
Castle. After you have your fill of medieval battlements and royal his-
tory, head to the National Gallery of Scotland for a spell of art apprecia-
tion or to the Museum of Scotland. In the afternoon, hop in a cab or take
a bus to Leith to visit the Royal Yacht Britannia. Dine at Witchery by
the Castle or the Atrium.
Take Day 2 to enjoy the bustle, shopping, atmosphere, and some of the
modest attractions found along the Royal Mile. Start from the top end at
Edinburgh Castle and work your way down to the 16th-century royal
Palace of Holyroodhouse anchoring the other end. In Holyrood Park,
behind the palace, you can clamber up Arthur’s Seat for the sunset.
Finish off the day with a pub-crawl through the Old City and the
University district.
If you have three days
Spend the first two days as discussed in the previous section and take
Day 3 to get out of town, either to track down the Loch Ness Monster or
get funky in Glasgow. (Both excursions are described in the next section.)
Traveling beyond Edinburgh
If you have a day or so to spare, consider heading out of town. We rec-
ommend either traveling north to enjoy the spectacular scenery of the
Highlands (and perhaps catch a glimpse of that fabled sea monster) or
Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 179

going west to Glasgow, currently being reinvented as a splendid museum
and shopping town.
On Nessie’s trail: Inverness and Loch Ness
Many first-time visitors to the Highlands view Inverness — ancient seat
of the Pictish kings who once ruled northern Scotland — merely as a
steppingstone. Their real quest is for a glimpse of that elusive monster
said to inhabit the deep waters of Loch Ness, a long finger of water
stretching southwest from Inverness. The largest volume of water in
Scotland, the loch is deeper than it looks — it’s only 1.6km (1 mile) wide
and 39km (24 miles) long, but at its deepest, it plunges 210 to 240m
(700–800 ft.).
In truth, the Highlands hold more beautiful and rewarding spots, but no
one can deny the draw of Loch Ness and its creature. Visiting the loch in
a single day from Edinburgh is tough, but it can be done. Take the early
train to Inverness, tour the loch in the late morning and early afternoon,
and then bus back to Inverness to spend an afternoon seeing a few
sights before boarding a late train back to Edinburgh or the overnight
train to London.
Getting there
Seven trains daily connect Edinburgh and Inverness, and the trip is 
31⁄2 hours long. From Inverness, buses run hourly down the loch to
Drumnadrochit (a 30-minute trip). To find the bus station, turn right 
as you exit the train station and then right again on Strothers Lane.
The Inverness Tourist Office (% 01463-234-353; Fax: 01463-710-609;
www.visithighlands.com), at Castle Wynd off Bridge Street, can help
you with the basics of Nessie-stalking and other loch activities ranging
from lake cruises to monster-seeking trips in a sonar-equipped boat for
around £10 to £25 ($20–$50).
If you just want a quick spin to Nessie’s lair, Highland Experience, 
2 Stoneycroft Rd., South Queensferry in Edinburgh (% 0131-331-1889;
www.highlandexperience.com), offers a full-day Loch Ness Tour by
bus that includes an hour-long lake cruise, a lunch stop at Spean Bridge,
a stop at Glencoe, and a drive through the scenic countryside where
Rob Roy, William “Braveheart” Wallace, and other cinematic icons of
Scottish history made their names. The tour leaves daily from Waterloo
Place in Edinburgh at 8 a.m. and costs £33 ($66) for adults and £31 ($62)
for seniors 61 and older and children 15 and younger.
In Inverness, Jacobite Coaches and Cruises, Tomnahurich Bridge on
Glenurquhart Road (% 01463-233-999; www.jacobitecruises.co.uk;

Visitor Centre (% 01456-450-395; www.lochness-centre.com), runs
hourly Nessie-hunting cruises on the loch for £10 ($20) adults, £6 ($12)
children, Easter to New Year’s, weather permitting.
Seeing the sights
Despite being one of the oldest towns in Scotland, Inverness has been
extensively rebuilt over the past century and a half and consequently
looks rather modern. The castle looks old and impressive, but it was
built between 1834 and 1847.
A short distance to the east of Inverness, on Auld Castlehill of the Craig
Phadrig, is the most ancient area in town. This rise was the original site
of the city castle, one of several Scottish sites that lay claim to the dubi-
ous distinction of being the place where Macbeth murdered King Duncan
in 1040. Next to the castle sits the free Inverness Museum and Art
Gallery (% 01463-237-114; www.invernessmuseum.com), which gives
you the lowdown on the life, history, and culture of the Highlands.
Across the river are the Victorian St. Andrew’s Cathedral (% 01463-
225-553; www.invernesscathedral.co.uk) on Ardoss Street (check out
the Russian icons inside) and the excellent Balnain House, 40 Huntly St.
(% 0463-715-615), whose exhibition of Highland music displays include
instruments (bagpipes, fiddles, harps) you can play and a great CD and
gift shop. They also sponsor fantastic jam sessions Thursday nights year-
round. Farther west lies Tomnahurich, or the “hill of the fairies,” with a
cemetery and panoramic views.
If you’re driving around the lake, you have to make a choice: the main A82
along the north shore, passing such monster haunts as Drumnadrochit
and Urquhart castle, or the more scenic southern shore route of natural
attractions — pretty woodlands and the Foyers waterfalls. On a quick trip,
the A82 offers more memorable scenery.
About halfway (23km/14 miles) down the A82 from Inverness is the
hamlet of Dumnadrochit, unofficial headquarters of Nessie lore. You
find two museums here devoted to Nessie. The Loch Ness Exhibition
Centre, in a massive stone building (% 01456-450-573; www.lochness.
com), is a surprisingly sophisticated look at the history of the loch (geo-
logical as well as mythological) and its famously elusive resident. The
show takes a strict scientific view of the whole business of Nessie-hunting,
really doing more to dispel and discredit the legends and sightings than
to fan the flames of speculation. Admission is £5.95 ($12) adults, £4.50
($9) seniors, £3.50 ($7) children, and £17 ($33) families.
The older and simpler Original Loch Ness Monster Exhibition (% 01456-
450-342; www.lochness-centre.com), is more of a believers’ haunt,
running down the legend of the monster with a hackneyed old film, a lot
Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 181

of “What is it?” photographs, accounts of Nessie sightings (along with
other mythological creatures throughout the world, such as unicorns
and Bigfoot), and a big ol’ gift shop.
Almost 3km (2 miles) farther down the road (a half-hour walk), the ruins
of Urquhart Castle (% 01456-450-551; www.historic-scotland.gov.
uk) sit on a piece of land jutting into the lake. This castle holds the
record for the most Nessie sightings. The 1509 ramparts encompass
what was once one of the largest fortresses in Scotland, blown up in
1692 to prevent it from falling into Jacobite hands. When not packed
with summer tourists, the grassy ruins can be quite romantic, and the
tower keep offers fine loch views. The castle is open daily year-round
from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Oct–Mar until 5 p.m.). Admission is £6.50 ($13)
adults, £5 ($10) seniors, and £3.25 ($6.50) children.
Where to stay and dine
One of the nicest places to stay in Inverness is the Glen Mhor Hotel 
(% 01463-234-308; Fax: 01463-713-170; www.glen-mhor.com), on the
River Ness, with great views and excellent Scottish cuisine in its restau-
rants. Small doubles go for £65 to £115 ($130–$230). Steaks, seafood, and
pizza can be had at the modern, laid-back Irish music pub Johnny Foxes
Part III: The British Isles 
182
Nessie, the monster of the loch
The legend started in the sixth century after St. Colomba sent a monk swimming across
the loch and a giant creature attacked him. After a harsh scolding from the saint, the
monster withdrew. The legend, however, lives on.
Is Nessie the Loch Ness Monster that surfaced from the dark waters in the 16th cen-
tury, slithering to shore, knocking down trees, and crushing three men with her tail?
Or is she Nessitera rhombopteryx, a vestigial survivor from the age of the dinosaurs?
Her basic description sounds like that of a plesiosaur — then again, it also kind of
matches some species of sea snake.
No one knows for sure, but one definite fact is that the monster sightings increased
in number after 1933, when the A82 road was built by blasting lakeshore rock. Shortly
thereafter, innkeepers Mr. and Mrs. Spicer thought they saw something break the sur-
face of the waters one night. The incident was reported on a slow news day in the
local paper, and the rumor spread like wildfire.
In the end, the monster may be no more than the collective effect of faked photo-
graphs, water-surface mirages brought on by too much whisky, a few unexplained
lake phenomena, and a string of lochside villages whose economies are based on
spinning tall tales to visitors. Sonar soundings and a host of keen-eyed watchers have
not yet managed to prove, or disprove, Nessie’s existence, and that is more than
enough reason for 200,000 visitors annually to come, cameras and binoculars in hand,
to search for the monster of Loch Ness.

(% 01463-236-577; www.johnnyfoxes.co.uk), on Bank Street at Bridge
Street. If you want to stay immersed in monster tales, shack up in
Drumnadrochit at the Polmaily House Hotel (% 01456-450-343; Fax:
01456-450-813; www.polmaily.co.uk) for £65 ($130) per person, includ-
ing breakfast.
Glasgow: A Victorian industrial city discovers culture
Glasgow was an Industrial Revolution powerhouse, the “second city of
the British Empire,” from the 19th to the early 20th century. With its
wealth came a Victorian building boom, the architecture of which is only
beginning to be appreciated.
A civic and mental makeover in the 1980s turned Glasgow from a
depressed slum into a real contender for Edinburgh’s title of cultural and
tourist center of Scotland. With friendlier people and more exclusive
shopping than the capital, and a remarkable array of art museums,
Glasgow has made a new name for itself. Spend at least one night to
drink in its renewed splendors.
Getting there and around
Half-hourly trains arrive in 50 minutes from Edinburgh; the eight daily
trains (four on Sun) from London take almost six hours to arrive in
Glasgow. Throughout the day, CityLink (www.citylink.co.uk) runs
buses from Edinburgh to Glasgow. Glasgow’s helpful tourist office
(% 0141-204-4400; www.seeglasgow.com) is at 11 George Sq.
The old section of Glasgow centers around the cathedral and train 
station. The shopping zone of Merchant’s City is west of High Street.
Glasgow grew westward, so the finest Victorian area of the city is the
grid of streets known as the West End. All these areas are north of the
River Clyde. The city has a good bus system and an underground
(subway) that swoops from the southwest in an arc back to the north-
west. The £1.90 ($3.80) Discovery Ticket allows you one day’s unlimited
travel on Glasgow’s underground after 9:30 a.m. Monday through
Saturday (Sat tickets include Sun for free); it’s the cheapest way to get
around.
Seeing the sights
As far as sightseeing goes, Glasgow offers art, art, and more art. Luckily,
admission to almost all of Glasgow’s attractions is free. You’ll find addi-
tional information about many of the museums listed in this section 
at www.glasgowmuseums.com. Make sure you fit in at least the
Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, on Argyle Street in the West End
(% 0141-287-2699), which is strong on Italian and Dutch Old Masters,
such as Botticelli, Bellini, and Rembrandt, as well as the moderns —
Monet, Picasso, van Gogh, Degas, Matisse, Whistler, and Ben Johnson. A
whole horde of Scottish artists is represented, too, with works dating from
the 17th century to the present. Take your time perusing the collections of
Chapter 11: Edinburgh and the Best of Scotland 183

sculpture, ethnological artifacts, arms and armor, natural history, decora-
tive arts, and relics of Scotland’s Bronze Age. After a major refurbishment,
the museum reopened in 2006.
The other great gallery of Glasgow is the Burrell Collection (% 0141-
287-2550), about 6km (4 miles) southwest of the city center in Pollok
Country Park. The huge assortment of art and artifacts was once a pri-
vate collection. The collection is global and spans from the Neolithic era
to the modern day, with special attention to ancient Rome and Greece,
as well as paintings by Cézanne, Delacroix, and Cranach the Elder. Also
in the park is the 18th-century mansion Pollok House (% 0141-616-
6410), with a fine series of Spanish paintings by El Greco, Goya,
Velázquez, and others.
The Hunterian Art Gallery, University Avenue (% 0141-330-5431;
www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk), controls the estate of the great artist
James McNeill Whistler (born American, but proud to be of Scottish
blood). The gallery is housed in a painstaking reconstruction of Charles
Rennie Mackintosh’s home, an architectural treasure designed and built
by the Art Nouveau innovator, the original of which was demolished in
the 1960s.
Across the street from the Hunterian Art Gallery is the Hunterian
Museum (% 0141-330-4221; www.hunterian.gla.ac.uk), which has a
unique archaeological collection, ranging from dinosaur fossils to Roman
and Viking artifacts — enough relics to give the kids a break from all those
paintings. You can also see an exhibit on the travels of Captain Cook.
The kids — and certainly history buffs — may also get a kick out of the
People’s Palace and Winter Gardens (% 0141-554-0223) on Glasgow
Green (Britain’s first public park). Beyond a lush greenhouse filled with
palms and a tearoom, the museum contains an assortment of artifacts
from the Middle Ages and pertaining to Mary Queen of Scots, but the
main collections focus on the life of an average Glaswegian in Victorian
times.
Where to stay
The huge Quality Hotel Central, 99 Gordon St. (% 0141-221-9680; Fax:
0141-226-3948; www.qualityhotelglasgow.co.uk), near the central
station, provides a tatty turn-of-the-last-century charm for £64 to £125
($128–$250) per double; the tourist office can also help you book a room.
Where to dine
Revitalized Glasgow has plenty of refined international eateries these
days, and the best of the lot has to be oddball Rogano, 11 Exchange Place,
Buchanan Street (% 0141-248-4055; www.roganoglasgow.com) serving
pricey traditional seafood in an atmosphere intended to re-create the
Deco styling of the Queen Mary; you can also dine in the less-expensive
bar or cafe.

money, so you may find three completely
different designs for each note, in addition
to regular British pounds. All different cur-
rency designs are valid.
The rate of exchange used to calculate the
dollar values given in this chapter is $1 =
50p (or £1 = $2). Amounts over $10 have
been rounded to the nearest dollar.

Dublin and the Best 
of Ireland
In This Chapter
 Getting to and around Dublin
 Exploring Dublin’s neighborhoods
 Discovering Dublin’s top hotels, restaurants, and attractions
 Heading into the Irish countryside for excursions and overnight trips
C
alled the Emerald Isle with good reason, Ireland is a lush, green land
with a deep history. Ancient ruins and medieval monasteries, struc-
tures once inhabited by Celts, Vikings, Normans, and the English, dot the
countryside. Ireland is the renowned home to literary giants, Irish
whiskey, and a rich musical tradition.
The city of Dublin has exquisite museums and a thriving nightlife. But
even more appealing is the beautiful, rural landscape and charming
small towns that await you. Give Dublin two or three days and then take
off to the Irish countryside.
Getting There
You can fly to Dublin from London in just one hour, making that by far
the most convenient way to get to town — especially in light of the plod-
ding train-to-overnight-ferry-to-commuter-rail alternative. But the follow-
ing sections include your many options.
Arriving by air
Dublin International Airport (% 01-814-1111; www.dublin-airport.
com) lies about 13km (8 miles) or 30 minutes north of the city. Inside the
arrivals hall are multiple ATMs and a cellphone rental shop. The Tourist
Information Centre (% 01-605-7700) can help with hotel reservations
and assist you in planning your itinerary. It’s open daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Aircoach (% 01-844-7118; www.aircoach.ie) runs to and from Dublin’s
City Centre every 15 minutes between 5 a.m. and midnight, and every

hour between midnight and 5 a.m. The one-way fare is 7 ($11); round-
trip is 12 ($19). You can buy a ticket onboard. Dublin Bus’s Airlink serv-
ice (routes 747 and 748; % 01-873-4222; www.dublinbus.ie) also runs
between the airport and City Centre. The 747 stops at O’Connell Street
or the Central Bus Station; the 748 stops at the same bus station and at
Heuston Rail Station. One-way fare is 6 ($9.60) adults, 3 ($4.80) chil-
dren. The buses run from about 5:45 a.m. to about 10:50 p.m. depending
on the day of the week.
Taxis line up outside the terminal for a quick, easy trip into town; fares
average 17 to 27 ($27–$43).
Finally, several car-rental options are available at the airport. If you’re
staying in Dublin, however, we don’t recommend renting a car.
Arriving by land
CIÉ (www.cie.ie) is a great place to find out about bus and train service
across Ireland.
Most trains (from the west, south, and southwest) arrive at Heuston
Station (% 01-703-2132), on the west end of town. Those from the north
pull into the more centrally located Connolly Station (% 01-703-2358).
Buses arrive at the Busaras Central Bus Station (% 01-836-6111) on
Store Street near Connolly Station. For information, contact Irish Rail
(% 1-850-366-222; www.irishrail.ie). For bus information, contact
Bus Éireann % 01-836-6111; www.buseireann.ie).
Arriving by sea
For information on getting to Ireland by ferry, check out www.irish
ferries.com, www.stenaline.com, or www.poirishsea.com.
If you arrive in Dún Laoghaire by ferry, you can take DART into town
(trains run from about 6 a.m. to roughly midnight). If your ferry arrives
at dawn, take bus no. 46A; it runs from the ferry docks to Parnell Square
West from 6:25 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
Orienting Yourself in Dublin
The city of Dublin is sprawling, but many of its sights are concentrated
in the city center near the Liffery River. Most sights lie on the south side
of the River Liffey, though several interesting sights exist on the north
side around Parnell Square.
Introducing the neighborhoods
North of the Liffey, the main thoroughfare is called O’Connell Street. On
the north side, O’Connell Street leads up to Parnell Square. O’Connell
Street crosses a bridge of the same name to the south side, where it

Ireland
Chapter 12: Dublin and the Best of Ireland 189
becomes a large traffic circle in front of the grand campus of Trinity
College. The street then narrows again into the pedestrian Grafton
Street. Grafton Street continues south to spill into St. Stephen’s Green,
which is something between a square and a gorgeous city park. Off the
northeast corner of this square is a complex of huge buildings that
house the government and various national museums and libraries. To
the east of St. Stephen’s Green lie several elegant Georgian Squares,
including Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square. Farther to the south-
east is the fashionable embassy and hotel-filled neighborhood of
Ballsbridge.

Back at that traffic circle in front of Trinity College, College Green leads
due west past the impressive Bank of Ireland building and becomes
Dame Street. Temple Bar, Dublin’s always fun pub-, club-, and restau-
rant-filled district lies between Dame Street and the Liffey. (Temple Bar
is connected to the north side of the Liffey by the picturesque span of
the Ha’penny Bridge.) Dame Street changes names regularly as it moves
west, passing Dublin Castle before reaching Christ Church Cathedral on
the edge of the city center.
Finding information after you arrive
Dublin Tourism (% 01-605-7700; www.visitdublin.com) operates two
tourism centers throughout the city plus one in nearby Dún Laoghaire.
In addition to the desk at the airport (see “Getting There,” earlier in this
chapter), you can find information at the main office in the former
Church of St. Andrew on Suffolk Street (Open: July–Aug Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–
7 p.m. and Sun 10:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; June and Sept Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–
7 p.m. and Sun 10:30 a.m.–3 p.m.; Oct–May Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m. 
and Sun 10:30 a.m.–3 p.m.); in Dún Laoghaire Harbour (Open: Mon–Sat
10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 2–6 p.m.); and at 14 Upper O’Connell St. (Open:
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m.)You can also get good information from Tourism
Ireland (% 800-223-6470 in the U.S.; www.discoverireland.com/us).
Getting around Dublin by foot
The heart of Dublin is small, and with so many garden squares to stroll,
it’s eminently walkable.
Getting around Dublin by bus
Dublin’s green double-decker buses (% 01-873-4222;
www.dublinbus.ie) can transport you all over the city and suburbs. To
take a bus, hop on, say where you want to get off, and pay the driver
(you must have exact change, and bills are not accepted). Your fare is
calculated by the distance traveled and runs from about 0.95 to 2.50
($1.50–$4), except late at night when the rate is a flat 5 ($8) fare. A
Rambler Ticket is valid for one, three, five, or seven days of unlimited
travel on the bus system, and costs 6 ($9.60), 12 ($19), 19 ($30), and
23 ($37), respectively. For a ticket that combines travel on the bus and
DART systems, see the following section. You can purchase Rambler
Tickets online or at the bus depot at 59 Upper O’Connell St.
Getting around Dublin by DART (light rail)
The speedy Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) electric train (% 01-
703-3504; www.dart.ie) is really for commuters, with only five stops
you may need to know: three in the city center (Connolly, Tara Street,
and Pearse), the Lansdowne Road station in Ballsbridge, and the Dún
Laoghaire station at the ferry docks. It’s usually not worth it to take
DART within the city center because the stops are within such close
Part III: The British Isles 
190

walking distance to one another. DART tickets cost about 1.50 to about
5 ($2.40–$8). A one-day pass is 7.60 ($12) for DART only and 9.30
($15) if you want to ride the buses as well. A three-day pass is 16 ($26),
or 18 ($29) including bus travel.
Getting around Dublin by car
There is absolutely no need to drive in the walkers’ paradise of Dublin
City, and it will usually prove to be a nuisance because parking is scarce,
especially around tourist attractions. If you do decide to drive in Dublin,
remember to avoid parking in bus lanes or along curbs with double
yellow lines — these are easy ways to get your tires clamped by parking
officials. To park on the streets in Dublin, buy a parking disc at one of
the black vending machines along the street and display it in the window
of your car.
Getting around Dublin by Luas (tram)
Luas (% 1-800-300-604; www.luas.ie) is Dublin’s sleek, shiny tram
system. You probably won’t need it if you’re spending time in the center
of the city, which is easily walkable. However, check out the map if
you’re traveling outside of the city center. It’s also useful for moving
between Connolly and Heuston stations. One-way fares run between
1.50 ($2.40) and 2.20 ($3.50), depending on your destination.
Getting around Dublin by taxi
Do not try to hail a taxi as it whizzes by you on the street. Instead, line
up at one of the city’s many ranks (stands), where taxis wait for their
fares. You’ll find ranks outside all the major hotels and transportation
centers as well as on the busier streets, such as Upper O’Connell Street,
College Green, and the north side of St. Stephen’s Green.
You can also call a taxi. Try A to B Cabs (% 01-677-2222), Castle Cabs
(% 01-831-9000), or City Cabs (% 01-873-1122). The starting fare for
the first kilometer ( 2⁄3 mile) is 3.80 ($6.10) by day and 4.10 ($6.55) at
night. For the next 14km (82⁄3 miles), the fare is 0.95 ($1.50) per kilome-
ter by day, 1.25 ($2) by night, rising to a maximum of 1.65 ($2.65) per
kilometer. It costs an extra 2 ($3.20) if you order a cab by phone.
Staying in Dublin
You can find a lot of breathtaking, expensive hotels in central Dublin, 
but you can also find some great values if you look hard enough. A great
alternative is to seek out one of the number of hotels housed in historic
Victorian and Georgian buildings, or something funky — such as the
Temple Bar neighborhood’s Oliver St. John Gogarty (% 01-671-1822;
www.gogartys.ie) — listed as a pub under “More cool things to see 
and do,” later in this chapter — which has converted its upper floors

$40–$64 per person in the dorms) and a set of self-catering apartments
(140–200/$224–$320).
Many areas outside Dublin’s city center have bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs),
which generally offer inexpensive lodging in a friendly, small-inn atmos-
phere. Dublin Tourism (% 01-605-7777; www.visitdublin.com) can
help you find a B&B room for a 5 ($8) fee; the agency books rooms in
traditional hotels as well (see “Finding information after you arrive,” ear-
lier in this chapter). The embassy-filled residential area of Ballsbridge, a
short DART ride from downtown, is one of the nicest (and safest) neigh-
borhoods to stay in if you want to stay outside of the city center.
Note that Dublin hotels often quote their prices per person, not per
room. The prices listed in this chapter are per room double occupancy,
but wherever you stay, double-check the hotel’s pricing policy so that
you won’t be in for any surprises when you check out.
For general tips on booking and what to expect from European accom-
modations, see Chapter 7.
Dublin’s top hotels
The Clarence
$$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
This high-class hotel has a lot to offer, including a terrific location at the
doorstep of the lively Temple Bar area, an elegant modern look, and supe-
rior service. It’s even touched by fame: The hotel is partly owned by Bono
and The Edge of the Irish rock band U2. You may not want to leave your
enormous bed, where you can bliss out to CDs on the room’s stereo. Décor
is simple and chic, with vivid colors gracing each room. The classy
Octagon Bar, the wonderful Tea Room restaurant (reviewed in the “Dining
in Dublin” section later in this chapter), and the full-service Therapy Spa
are downstairs. The Clarence is among the city’s top hotels — not as
supertrendy as the Morrison, but just plain classy.

Grafton Guesthouse
$$
Old City, Dublin 2
This guesthouse is an incredible value, offering bright, cute, decent-size
rooms at ridiculously low prices (by Dublin standards). Rooms are deco-
rated with kitschy touches, such as wallpaper with bright flowers and mod
lamps, and free WiFi is available for those who can’t live without their
Internet. The kicker is that this place is in a central location, on hip Great
Georges Street, right near Grafton Street and Trinity College. Service is a

version of the traditional Irish breakfast, complete with nonmeat sausages.

Jurys Inn Christchurch
$$
Old City (near Temple Bar), Dublin 8
You can’t beat Jurys for value if you’re traveling as a family: This hotel
group is one of the few in Ireland that doesn’t charge extra if more than
two people share a room. The rooms here are large and modern, with the
standard hotel décor of floral fabrics. There’s a lively pub downstairs, and
the hotel offers baby-sitting services. The hotel is centrally situated at the
top of Dame Street, right near Christ Church Cathedral and Dublin Castle
(ask for a room with a view of the cathedral).

Kilronan House
$$$
St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2
This small family-run hotel, with only 15 rooms, is one of the best places
to stay if this is your first visit to Dublin. Terry Masterson, the hotel’s
friendly proprietor, makes a point to sit down with each guest to help plan
an itinerary and to field questions about the city. Located on a quiet street
within a ten-minute walk of St. Stephen’s Green, the Georgian town house
features many original details, such as beautiful ceiling molding, large bay
windows, Waterford chandeliers, and hardwood floors in the public areas.
The spacious rooms are modern, brightly painted, and filled with natural
light — ask for one with a skylight. An excellent full Irish breakfast is
served in the elegant dining room.

Number 31
$$$
St. Stephen’s Green, Dublin 2
You know how guidebooks always say that certain hotels are “an oasis in
a busy city”? Well, Number 31 really is. Designed by Sam Stephenson, one
of Ireland’s most famous modern architects, this guesthouse is tucked
away behind a vined wall on a peaceful little lane about a ten-minute walk
from St. Stephen’s Green. The style inside is a marriage of modern design
and country chic. The spacious rooms have intentionally weathered white
wood country furniture and cozy quilts, plus little modern surprises such

as a burnished gray mirrored wall and a sunken bathtub created with
turquoise mosaic tiles. Sitting in the glass-walled conservatory; munching
on homemade granola and delightful hot breakfast dishes; and chatting
with Deirdre and Noel Comer, your warm hosts, you may want to move in
permanently. Be sure to say hi to Homer, the resident Golden Labrador.

Stauntons on the Green
$$$
St. Stephen’s Green
Although less than 20 years old, this hotel on Dublin’s central square has
a historic feel — thanks in large part to the fact that it occupies a series of
three 18th-century Georgian town houses. The windows are tall, ceilings
high, and furnishings traditional, with fireplaces blazing in the public
rooms. You see green every way you look; the back rooms open onto
Iveagh Gardens.

Temple Bar Hotel
$$$
Temple Bar, Dublin 2
This hotel has everything: a terrific location in the heart of Temple Bar, a
welcoming and helpful staff, an airy Art Deco lobby, and a nice restaurant
serving light fare under the glow of skylights. In fact, the only drawback
to the hotel is the small size of the bedrooms, which feature mahogany fur-
niture, deep green and burgundy colors, and firm double beds. Ask for a
room away from the street if you’re a light sleeper.

This moderately priced hotel
is right across the street from the Bus Éireann station, close to Dublin’s
main shopping area and a mere five-minute walk from the city center. The
building is a restored wine warehouse, and much of the original brickwork
is still visible, giving it a lot of character. Rooms are modern and tastefully

are filled with amenities, including a state-of-the-art sound system. The
service is pampering and flawless. Though the Morrison is located on the
less-happening north side of the Liffey, it’s within easy walking distance of

Dining in Dublin
If you think of shepherd’s pie, Irish stew, and mashed potatoes when you
think of Irish cuisine, you’re right. But that’s only half the story: In the
past few decades, Ireland has seen huge changes on the food scene. A
stroll down a row of restaurants is like paging through a book about the
world’s cuisines. Especially in larger towns and cities, you can find every-
thing from Italian restaurants that would make The Sopranos proud, to
Indian restaurants serving fiery curries, to minimalist temples to sushi.
Along with these ethnic eateries is a bevy of restaurants creating innova-
tive dishes that showcase the best of Ireland’s sparkling fresh produce
and incorporating international influences. Typical dishes? How about
fresh Irish salmon served with wasabi-infused mashed potatoes or local
free-range beef with a Thai curry sauce?
If you’re in the market for traditional Irish dishes, your best bet is a pub,
where you find hearty offerings such as Irish stew, thick vegetable
soups, and ploughman’s lunches (cheese, pickles, and bread). Pub grub
Chapter 12: Dublin and the Best of Ireland 197

hasn’t escaped the influences of the last few decades. The dishes are
better than ever, many chefs use as much local produce as possible, and
international influences are found in many dishes. (Who knew that chili
jam would go so well with Gubbeen, a West Cork cheese?) And you’d
better sit down for this next bit: Many traditional pubs now squeeze
salads and other healthy options onto the menu.
If you want something quick and inexpensive, try a pub or head for one
of the loads of small cafes and lunch counters that offer soups and sand-
wiches. Even more plentiful are chippers and take-aways, fast-food places
where you can get, among other things, traditional fish and chips.
You can’t discuss Irish cuisine without mentioning beer. The Irish say
that drinking Guinness from a can or bottle rather than enjoying a fresh
pint drawn straight from the tap is like eating canned peaches rather
than a ripened peach fresh off the tree. Guinness’s lager is called Harp,
and don’t miss out on the Guinness rival from Cork, the dark Murphy’s.
Kilkenny’s Smithwicks is the best when it comes to ales. For a break from
the brew, quality hard cider is also on tap.
The Irish invented whiskey: The legend pins it on a sixth-century monk.
Old Bushmills (established in 1608) is the oldest distillery in the world.
The e isn’t the only difference between Irish whiskey and Scotch or
English whisky; the unique Irish distillation process gives the stuff a
cleaner, less smoky flavor. Other brands to sample include John
Jameson, Powers, Paddy’s, Tullamore Dew, Murphy, and Dunphy. The
Irish drink their whiskey neat — straight out of the bottle at room tem-
perature. A few decades ago, they started dumping Irish whiskey into
coffee, mixing in sugar, topping it off with whipped cream, and serving it
to arrivals at the Shannon airport (hence, Irish coffee). This concoction
may be touristy, but it’s very, very tasty.
If you have your heart set on eating at a posh restaurant in one of the
larger cities during the summer or on a weekend (or on a summer week-
end!), make reservations. For the poshest of the posh restaurants, it’s a
good idea to make reservations no matter what time of year it is.
Dublin’s restaurants often add a service charge of 10 percent to 17 per-
cent to your bill, so when you’re calculating a tip, double-check the bill
to see if it’s already been done.
Beshoff

Trinity Area, Dublin 2
FISH AND CHIPS
The fish here, and there’s quite a variety (cod is the classic), is as fresh as
can be, its juices sealed in by a fried golden-brown crust; the chips (fries)
are cut fresh each day and are thick and deliciously dense. If you like 
salt and vinegar to begin with, you’ll love how they complement fish and
chips, so ask for them. Beshoff has seating, so you can pick up your food
downstairs and then climb the stairs to find a table overlooking busy

This popular Dublin restaurant serves innovative dishes made with some
of the freshest, most flavorful ingredients around. The menu changes 
seasonally, offering the likes of Irish Angus rib-eye steak with sage-and-
mustard mashed potatoes and garlicky beans; yellowfin tuna with plum
tomatoes, capers, mint, and wasabi mayonnaise; and a salad of asparagus
and quail eggs with shaved Parmesan and greens. The crowd is always
buzzing and chic; businesspeople descend on the restaurant at lunch,
while dinner sees more couples and small groups. The surroundings are
cozy and modern, featuring contemporary art, white wood walls, high-
backed pine chairs, and solid pine tables. Save room for the unbelievable
desserts, including pecan pie served with maple ice cream.

BAKERY/CAFE
If you lived near this bakery and cafe, you might weigh about 900 pounds,
and that would be tragic, because then you might not be able to fit through
the door to sample more of their incredible desserts. Savory lunch tarts
(such as a goat cheese, tomato, olive, and pesto combo), salads, sand-
wiches, and toothsome homemade soups attended by a thick slice of
brown bread are served in a cheerful, casual yellow room. But the excel-
lent lunch fare is just the opening act for the glorious desserts, including
a tangy blackberry-and-apple crumble offset by sweet cream.

Dublin 2
New Irish
The Winding Stair is the best new restaurant in Dublin, giving you the best
of both worlds: traditional Irish ingredients presented with impeccable
modern cooking skills. The chefs are obsessed with finding the top sources
for their local ingredients, from the Irish Aberdeen beef (which is accom-
panied by sticky onions, garlic butter, and homemade French fries) to the
fromage heaven that greets you on the Irish Cheese Board. And don’t miss
the desserts, especially the unbelievable sticky pear and ginger cake. The
setting is casual and airy, with views over the River Liffey through ceiling-
high windows. You may find yourself elbow-to-elbow with your fellow
patrons, but with the good spirits, laughter, and transcendent food, you
should hardly mind.

Dublin’s top sights
Chester Beatty Library
Dublin 2
The Chester Beatty Library is one of those gems that often gets overlooked
in favor of the flashier attractions of Dublin. But this extensive collection
of books, artwork, manuscripts, and religious objects from around the
world is worth at least a couple of hours of precious vacation time. On the
first floor, you find an exhibit called Arts of the Book, an awe-inspiring and
diverse collection of ancient books, from Egyptian Books of the Dead to
medieval illuminated manuscripts. Narrated videos of craftspeople at work
are found throughout the gallery, illuminating crafts such as bookbinding,
papermaking, and printmaking. The second floor is dedicated to books
and objects from many of the world’s religious traditions. A beautifully cre-
ated audiovisual explores religious practices and belief systems around
the world. The treasures on this floor are numerous, including a Hindu cos-
mological painting from 18th-century Nepal; a standing Tibetan Buddha;
and some of the earliest New Testament and Gospel texts, including the
Gospel of St. John, written on Greek papyrus, circa A.D. 150 to 200. If you’re
hungry, the Silk Road Café offers terrific Mediterranean food.

Christ Church Cathedral
Dublin 8
Christ Church Cathedral, an Anglican/Episcopal church, has existed in var-
ious forms in this spot for almost a thousand years. The Vikings built a
simple wood church at this location in 1038. In the 1180s, the original foun-
dation was expanded into a cruciform, and the Romanesque cathedral was
built in stone. The church you see today is the result of restoration and
rebuilding on the 1180s building during the 1870s. The cathedral provides
an informative self-guided tour brochure when you enter. Don’t let all the
soaring architecture above you make you forget to look down at the beau-
tiful tile floor. On your way to the Peace Chapel of Saint Laud, check out the

Dublin Castle
Dublin 2
This is not your typical storybook castle. It was built in the 13th century,
but many additions were made over the following 800 years. Today, the
castle looks like an encyclopedia of European architectural styles, from
the 13th-century Norman Record Tower to the Church of the Holy Trinity,
designed in 1814 in Gothic style. The castle now hosts official state func-
tions, such as the president’s inauguration, and the clock tower is home to
the excellent Chester Beatty Library (reviewed earlier in this section).
Forty-five-minute guided tours take you through many of the impressively
furnished State Apartments, including the Drawing Room, which features
a breathtaking Waterford crystal chandelier; the Throne Room, which
holds what is believed to be an original seat of William of Orange; and
Patrick’s Hall, which boasts the banners of the knights of Saint Patrick and
historical ceiling paintings. Don’t miss the Church of the Holy Trinity, with
its beautiful carved-oak panels and stained-glass windows.

Dublin Writers Museum
North of the River Liffey
Ireland has produced a multitude of great writers — the short list includes
Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Roddy Doyle, and
Nobel Prize winners George Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats, and Samuel Beckett.
This 18th-century house commemorates Ireland’s famed scribes with first
editions, letters, memorabilia, portraits, busts, and photos. Exhaustive and
interesting text on the walls relates the biographies of the writers and
explains Ireland’s literary movements. The 30-minute audio tour gives brief
descriptions of the writers and includes snippets of text read by actors
and music appropriate to the display that you’re looking at. (Don’t be
cowed by the listening device — it takes everyone a few minutes to master
it.) Only true literary types need apply.

Guinness Storehouse
Dublin 8
Though the actual Guinness Brewery is closed to the public, the Guinness
Storehouse fills you in on everything you’ve ever wanted to know about
“black gold.” This temple to Guinness is housed in a 1904 building that was
used for the fermentation process (when yeast is added to beer). The core
of the building is a recently created seven-level, pint-shaped structure that
could hold approximately 14.3 million pints of Guinness. The Storehouse
explores every facet of Ireland’s favorite beverage, from the ingredients
that go into each batch to the company’s advertising campaigns to the role
of Guinness in Irish culture. Though the whole attraction evokes a sense
of unabashed propaganda, the exhibits are beautifully done in a cool,
modern design. With a lot to see, you’ll definitely want to make time for
the ingredients exhibit, which features a veritable beach of barley and a
waterfall of Irish water; the intriguing exhibit about Guinness and Irish
pubs around the world (did you know that the first Irish pub in Abu Dhabi
opened in 1995?); and the fascinating display of Guinness advertisements
through the years. Also don’t miss the opportunity to pull your own pint
of Guinness. The top-floor Gravity Bar is (literally) the Storehouse’s crown-
ing glory, offering 360-degree views of Dublin through floor-to-ceiling glass
walls, and dispensing a free pint of black stuff to every visitor over the age
of 18. Allow about two hours for your visit.

5 p.m. (until 7 p.m. July–Aug).
St. Patrick’s Cathedral
Dublin 8
St. Patrick’s Cathedral, the national cathedral of the Church of Ireland,
derives its name from the belief that, in the fifth century, Saint Patrick bap-
tized converts to Christianity in a well that once existed on this land.
Though there have been churches on this spot since the fifth century, the
glorious church that stands today was built in the early 13th century, with
restorations to the west tower in 1370 and the addition of a spire in 1749.
Volunteers provide an informative map pamphlet that guides you through
the church, explaining the highlights of the interior. Be sure to visit the
moving memorial of author and social critic Jonathan Swift. Beautiful
matins (Sept–June Mon–Fri 9:40 a.m.) and evensongs (Mon–Fri 5:45 p.m.
and Sun 3:15 p.m.) are sung here. Allow 45 minutes for a visit.

Trinity College and the Book of Kells
Dublin 2
Trinity College, founded in 1592 by Elizabeth I, looks like the ideal of an
impressive, refined, old-world college, with Georgian stone buildings and
perfectly manicured green lawns. The campus sits in the middle of the busy
city, but within its gates, everything is composed and quiet. As you wander
the cobbled paths around Trinity, you can imagine the days when former
students Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, Jonathan Swift, and Bram Stoker (a
great athlete at Trinity) pounded the same pavement on their way to class.
The jewel in Trinity College’s crown is the Book of Kells, along with its
attending exhibit, housed in the Old Library. This manuscript of the four
gospels of the Bible was painstakingly crafted by monks around A.D. 800.
The gospels are written in ornate Latin script, and the book is filled with
stunning, vivid illustrations, including intricate Celtic knots and fantastical
animals. The engaging exhibit that leads to the Book of Kells (and three
other ancient Irish religious texts) explains the historical context in which
the books were created and reveals the techniques used in their creation.
You get to see only one page of the Book of Kells on each visit (they turn
a page each day). Be sure to check out the upstairs Long Room after you
go through the exhibit. Allow 21⁄2 hours for your visit.
If you’re a longtime science lover, check out the new Science Gallery (see
description later in the next section) while you’re on the Trinity Campus.

More cool things to see and do
 Spending an evening in the pubs and clubs of Temple Bar: The
eclectic, hopping Temple Bar area is a favorite with many visitors.
This area, a few streets along the Liffey, is packed with pubs, shops,
bars, cafes, galleries, theaters, and outdoor markets. The neighbor-
hood has its own tourist office at 27 Eustace St. (% 01-677-2397;
www.visit-templebar.com). In summer, ask at the tourist office
about “Diversions Temple Bar,” an arts and culture program that
includes movie screenings, dance performances, and Irish music
and storytelling sessions. Events are free of charge, but tickets
(available at the Temple Bar tourist office) are required.
Strolling about is the best way to visit Temple Bar. Proper pub-
hopping here includes Flannery’s, 48 Temple Bar (% 01-478-2238);
Farringtons, East Essex Street (% 01-671-5135); and Oliver St.
John Gogarty, 58–59 Fleet St. (% 01-671-1822), and its catty-
cornered neighbor Auld Dubliner, Temple Bar and Anglesea

streets (% 01-677-0527). Lillie’s Bordello, Adam Court off Grafton
Street (% 01-679-9204), is still one of the hottest Dublin clubs after
ten years, with a lipstick-red interior and the members-only (you
can pay to be a member) “Library” room. Renards, 35–37 S.
Frederick St. (% 01-677-5876), pulls in celebrities and locals alike,
with three floors of bars, dancing, and frequent live jazz. Ri-Rá,
1 Exchequer St. (% 01-671-1220), fills up every night with dancers
getting down to funk, jazz, and other grooves. No need to pub-hop
just in Temple Bar, though. Make sure you also hit Dublin’s oldest
and greatest pub, the Brazen Head, west of Temple Bar at 20 Lower
Bridge St. (% 01-679-5186), as well as the Victorian Doheny and
Nesbitt, 5 Lower Baggot St. (% 01-676-2945), the literary Davy
Byrnes, 21 Duke St. (% 01-677-5217), and two musical bars, The
Cobblestone, 77 North King St. (% 01-872-1799), and O’Donoghues,
15 Merrion Row (% 01-676-2087). Officially, Dublin’s pubs are gen-
erally open from 10:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (until 12:30 a.m. Fri–Sat).
Some pubs are licensed to stay open later on weekends.
 Tapping your feet on a musical pub crawl: The Musical Pub Crawl
(% 01-475-3313; www.discoverdublin.ie) is a fabulous experi-
ence for anyone even remotely interested in Irish music. Two excel-
lent musicians guide you from pub to pub, regaling you with Irish
tunes and songs; cracking many a joke; and filling you in on the
instruments used in Irish music, the history of the music, and the
various types of tunes and songs. The nightly tour begins in the
upstairs room at Oliver St. John Gogarty’s pub at the corner of
Fleet and Anglesea streets in Temple Bar. Show up at 7:30 p.m.
nightly April through October, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
nights in February, March, and November.
 Researching your Irish roots: Forty million Americans have some
Irish in them. Hundreds of Americans come to Ireland every year to
seek out their ancestors here, and the Irish are much obliged to help
(sometimes for a modest fee). First, the freebie services. The National
Library (% 01-603-0200; www.nli.ie) and the National Archives
(% 01-407-2300, or for Northern Ireland, % 020-8876-3444; www.
nationalarchives.ie, or for Northern Ireland, www.national
archives.gov.uk) are great places to start your search. The Office
of the Registrar General in County Roscommon (% 01-663-2900;
www.groireland.ie) retains all the records on births, deaths, and
marriages in the Republic of Ireland. The Web sites of commercial
(for-a-fee) ancestor-research firms Irish Genealogy (www.irish
genealogy.ie) and Irish Roots (www.irishroots.net) both have
good links lists to lots of local resources.
 Discovering literary and theatrical Dublin: If the Dublin Writers
Museum (see “Dublin’s top sights” earlier in this chapter) isn’t
enough, immerse yourself in literary Dublin by checking out the
definitive James Joyce Centre, 35 N. Great George’s St. (% 01-
878-8547; www.jamesjoyce.ie), and the Abbey Theatre, 26 Lower
Abbey St. (% 01-878-7222; www.abbeytheatre.ie).
Chapter 12: Dublin and the Best of Ireland 205

One of the most fun ways to visit the Dublin of books is to take the
Literary Pub Crawl (% 01-670-5602; www.dublinpubcrawl.com), a
popular guided walking tour that meets at the Duke Pub at 9 Duke St.
(Apr–Oct Mon–Sat 7:30 p.m., Sun noon and 7:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar
Thurs–Sat 7:30 p.m., Sun noon and 7:30 p.m.). Or try the James
Joyce Dublin Walking Tour (% 01-878-8547; www.jamesjoyce.ie),
offered through the Joyce Centre.
Another great experience is seeing a play at the Abbey Theatre,
26 Lower Abbey St. (% 01-878-7222; www.abbeytheatre.ie),
founded by W. B. Yeats and Lady Gregory in 1904 (plays are per-
formed Mon–Sat at 8 p.m.), or the more avant-garde Gate Theatre
(% 01-874-4045; www.gate-theatre.ie).
 Immerse yourself in the history of Dublin: On the Original History
Tour, nicknamed the “Seminar on the Street,” Trinity history stu-
dents and graduates give a relatively in-depth account of Irish his-
tory as they guide you to some of the city’s most famous sites,
including Trinity, the Old Parliament House, Dublin Castle, City Hall,
Christ Church, and Temple Bar. This tour is likely to thrill history
buffs and anyone interested in the details of Irish history, and may
bore anyone looking for short anecdotes. Tours cost 12 ($19) and
are given daily May through September at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., April
and October daily at 11 a.m., and November through March Friday,
Saturday, and Sunday at 11 a.m. Contact Historical Walking Tours
(% 01-688-9412; www.historicalinsights.ie) or just show up at
the front gates of Trinity College a bit before the tour begins.
 Exploring an artsy Science Gallery: Trinity College’s new Science
Gallery, Trinity College at Pearse Street (% 01-896-4091), hosts
hands-on exhibits that blur the lines between art and science. A
recent exhibit about light featured offerings ranging from a life-size
playable Pong game projected on an old building across the street
to an interactive artistic rendition of the Northern Lights.
Shopping
This is the country that invented duty-free, so you’d be remiss not to
purchase a few items of local craft and tradition, from tweeds and tin
whistles to Waterford crystal, woolen sweaters, and whiskey. Dublin has
several “anything and everything Irish” stores, which are like depart-
ment store–size gift shops that cater exclusively to travelers. Several
have high quality control and are great if you’re on a tight time schedule
(all but one of the following are on Nassau Street, across from the south
flank of Trinity College). Head for House of Ireland, 37–38 Nassau St.
(% 01-671-1111; www.houseofireland.com), or the nearby Kilkenny
Shop, 5–6 Nassau St. (% 01-677-7066). You don’t have to go all the way
to the Aran Islands to pick up thick Irish woolen sweaters. Blarney
Woollen Mills, 21–23 Nassau St. (% 01-451-6111), has everything from
traditional sweaters to kilts, shawls, and scarves. For trendy Irish styles,
you can’t beat Avoca, 11–13 Suffolk St. (% 01-677-4215).

bus.ie) operates a very good, 75-minute hop-on/hop-off Dublin City
Tour that connects 23 major points of interest, including museums, art
galleries, churches and cathedrals, libraries, and historic sites. The tour
departs from the Dublin Bus office at Cathal Brugha Street, but you can
pick it up at any of the 23 stops. Fares are 15 ($24) adults, 6 ($9.60)
children 13 and under, and 13 ($21) seniors and students; the ticket is
valid for 24 hours. The bus operates daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this section
offers some tips for building your own Dublin itineraries.
If you have one day
If you just have one day and really want to pack the sightseeing in, take
the Dublin Bus “Hop-On Hop-Off” tour so that you can see as many
attractions as possible in the most efficient way.
Take in Trinity College and the Book of Kells first, and then wander
around the excellent shopping areas of Grafton Street and Nassau Street.
Grab lunch and picnic in Merrion Square. In the afternoon, visit the
nearby National Museum.
Treat yourself to a delicious dinner at the Winding Stair before meeting
up with the Musical Pub Crawl.
If you have two days
If you have two days, follow the itinerary for Day 1. On the morning of
the second day, take the Historical Walking Tour. Then head over to the
Chester Beatty Library to gaze at the gorgeous books and art housed
within.
Eat lunch at a pub, and then head out to see St. Patrick’s Cathedral and
the Guinness Storehouse. Drop into the Queen of Tarts, 4 Corkhill,
across from Dublin Castle (% 01-670-7499), for an afternoon treat on
your way back to Temple Bar.
Stroll Temple Bar, and splurge for dinner at Tea Room before joining up
with the Jameson’s Literary Pub Crawl.
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as described in the preceding section, and take
Day 3 to tour the prehistoric mound tombs, north of Dublin, or the
Wicklow Mountains and Glendalough, to the south (both covered in
the following section).
Chapter 12: Dublin and the Best of Ireland 207

Traveling the Irish Countryside
Lovely as Dublin is, you should really see a bit of Ireland’s famed coun-
tryside. Scenic drives abound, and the excursions in this section take
you past ruined churches and impressive mansions, along rocky shore-
lines, and through rolling, verdant landscapes dotted with sheep. The
best way to explore the countryside is by car.
North of Dublin to passage tombs 
and ruined medieval abbeys
Prehistoric sites and ruined abbeys draw visitors to the area around the
Boyne River Valley, north of Dublin. If you plan a tightly packed day, you
can easily visit all the sights below on a long day trip.
Getting there
The most convenient base for the region is the town of Drogheda, which
has regular rail and bus links with Dublin. The tourist office here is
located on Mayoralty Street (% 041-983-7070; www.drogheda.ie). The
prettiest area in the region is Carlingford, which is about 45km (28 miles)
north of the Boyne Valley attractions.
Mary Gibbons Tours (% 01-283-9973; www.newgrangetours.com)
offers an excellent bus tour of Meath from Dublin.
Seeing the sights
Top honors for sightseeing go to Newgrange and Knowth, Ireland’s most
famous and most accessible passage tombs. Newgrange is an 11m-high
(36-ft.) burial chamber made of stones — some weighing up to 16 tons.
It’s a watertight engineering triumph built well over 5,000 years ago,
before Stonehenge or the Egyptian pyramids were even contemplated.
You can take part in a guided visit down the 18m (60-ft.) passage to the
center of the tomb. There, you’ll be greeted with a beautiful surprise.
Knowth is a tomb of similar size to Newgrange, used from the Stone 
Age through the 1400s. Tours do not begin at Newgrange but at the 
Brú Na Bóinne Visitor Centre, south of the river Boyne on the L21, 3km
(2 miles) west of Donore (% 041-988-0300; www.heritageireland.ie),
and some distance from Newgrange itself.
The center is open daily year-round, but hours vary: March, April, and
October, it’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; May and the last 
two weeks of September, it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; June
through mid-September, it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and
November through February, it’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
last tour is offered 90 minutes before closing; the last admission to the
visitor center is 45 minutes before closing. The center restricts the
number of people visiting the site, so expect to spend about an hour
viewing the center before your 45-minute tour of Newgrange. Admission
to the center and Newgrange is 5.80 ($9.30) adults, 4.50 ($7.20) 
Part III: The British Isles 
208

seniors, 1.60 ($2.55) children and students, and 11 ($18) families. 
The addition of Knowth to your tour will cost about 2 ($3.20) more.
Located 10km (6 miles) northwest of Drogheda are the remains of the
monastery Monasterboice, now represented mainly by its quiet, 
monumental cemetery. Here you can see plenty of Celtic high crosses,
including the best preserved in Ireland, Muiredeach’s High Cross, a 
5m-tall (17-ft.) example from A.D. 922 (look at the beautifully preserved
“Taking of Christ” panel just above the base). Nearby are the ruins of
Mellifont Abbey (% 041-982-6103), a 12th-century religious community.
Monasterboice is open daily during daylight hours and is free. Mellifont
Abbey is open May through September daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission
is 2.10 adults ($3.35), 1.30 ($2.10) seniors, and 1.10 ($1.75) children
and students.
Where to stay and dine
You can stay in Drogheda at the Ballymascanlon House Hotel (% 042-
935-8200; www.ballymascanlon.com). If you opt to stay in charming
Carlingford, up north a ways, you won’t want to miss the welcome at
Shalom House, on Ghan Road (% 042-937-3151; www.jackiewoods.
com), and the baked goods at Georgina’s Bakehouse and Tea Rooms, 
on Castle Hill (% 042-937-3346).
South of Dublin: Mansions and monasteries 
in County Wicklow
Just an easy 15-minute drive south of downtown Dublin gets you to the
gardens of County Wicklow. The sights south of Dublin can easily be vis-
ited on a day trip.
Getting there
Dublin’s tourist office has information on County Wicklow; otherwise,
you’d have to drive all the way through the region to Wicklow Town 
and the area tourism office (% 0404-20-173; www.wicklow.ie) on
Fitzwilliam Square. You can see the best of this area by car, but if you’re
not renting a car, you can catch a ride with Bus Eireann (% 01-836-6111;
www.buseirann.ie), which takes busloads of travelers from Dublin to
the major sights year-round. If you don’t have a car and you want to see
Glendalough, make a reservation for the fun, daylong Wild Wicklow Tour
(% 01-280-1899; www.wildwicklow.ie).
Seeing the sights
A few miles south of Dublin on the N11, just past the town of Enniskerry,
you’ll find Powerscourt Gardens (% 01-204-6000; www.powerscourt.ie).
These gardens are the finest in Wicklow County, which is saying a lot,
because the county is known for its abundance of exceptionally beautiful
gardens. First laid out from 1745 to 1767, the gardens were redesigned in
Victorian style from 1843 to 1875. The gardens have many different facets,
among them a wooded glen graced with a stone round tower that was
Chapter 12: Dublin and the Best of Ireland 209

modeled on Lord Powerscourt’s dining-room pepper pot, a magical moss-
covered grotto, a formal Italianate area with a circular pond and fountain
presided over by sculptures of winged horses, and a walled garden
where blazing roses cling to the stone. About 6km (4 miles) on is the
120m (400-ft.) Powerscourt Waterfall, the tallest in Ireland. The gardens
are open year-round from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. during the summer and
9:30 a.m. to dusk in the winter.
The old Military Road (R115) slices through the wildest heights of the
Wicklow Mountains. This eerie peatscape, covered with heather and red-
dish scrub, looks as if it belongs somewhere on Mars, with only the Sally
Gap pass and Glenmacnass waterfalls breaking up the moody boglands.
At Laragh, detour west to visit one of the most magical of Ireland’s
ruined monastic sites, Glendalough (% 0404-45-325), which is filled
with high crosses, round towers, pretty lakes, and medieval stone build-
ings. During the summer, the tour buses can be frequent. Glendalough is
open daily mid-March to mid-October from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. The rest of
the year, it’s open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Driving rings around County Kerry
To partake in Irish culture at its best, check out County Kerry. Irish tradi-
tions flourish here, from music and storytelling to good pub craic (a
Gaelic word that, roughly translated, means “a great vibe”). In addition,
you can find several of the country’s few remaining Gaelic-speaking
pockets here. The 177km (110-mile) Ring of Kerry, a scenic route cir-
cling the Iveragh Peninsula, is Ireland’s most famous — and most tour
bus–engulfed — drive.
Because this area is heavy with tour buses, most visitors take the Ring
counterclockwise from Killarney, which makes the heavy traffic easier to
manage. The only thing less fun than driving on the left side of a twisty,
narrow two-lane road along a cliff and sharing it with a constant stream
of giant buses much too wide for their lane is doing the same thing with
all those buses coming directly at you.
You can visit the Ring in a long day, but give the whole area two or three
days in order to take some trips off the beaten path on the Iveragh
Peninsula and to spend time on the less-visited Dingle Peninsula.
Getting there
Frequent daily train and bus service arrives from Ireland’s big cities into
Killarney, the region’s main town and tourist center. Killarney also houses
the region’s main tourist office (% 064-31-633; www.killarneyonline.
com) in the Town Hall off Main Street.

Seeing the sights
Driving the Ring in County Kerry, a stretch of route N70 with plenty of
signage, is by far the most popular activity in this region. The winding
route provides thrilling, dramatic views of the sea and the high inland
mountains, and passes through a succession of charming villages, each
with its own unique points of interest. Highlights include the Kerry Bog
Village Museum at Glenbeigh (thatched cottages re-created for tourists),
Cahirciveen (the main town), Staigue Fort (a well-preserved, Iron Age,
drystone fortress), the town of Sneem (cottages in festive colors), and
the charming, picturesque town of Kenmare, where you’ll enjoy fine
hotels, restaurants, shopping, and pubs.
About halfway around the Ring, you can detour onto Valentia Island,
connected to the mainland by a bridge and home to the Skellig
Experience Centre (% 066-947-6306), where exhibits introduce you to

the endangered natural habitats and medieval monastery of the dra-
matic Skellig Islands off the coast. The center offers weather-dependent
cruises around the islands.
Though the Ring of Kerry is justifiably popular, the less frequented circu-
lar drive around the Dingle Peninsula, one inlet to the north of the
Inveragh, is even more scenic. Dingle’s tourist office (% 066-915-1188)
is on the Quay in Dingle Town, the main town. Dingle is also home to
Fungie, the resident dolphin of Dingle Bay. To arrange a swim with
Fungie (he’s not in captivity, so there’s no guarantee that he’ll show up),
call % 066-915-1967.
Another gem in Kerry is Killarney National Park (% 064-35-960), a
beautiful area full of lakes, waterfalls, castles, woodlands, bogs, and the
manor house, gardens, and romantically ruined abbey of Muckross.
Where to stay and dine
You may feel as though you’re staying in a friend’s house at Blackstones
House (% 066-976-0164; www.glencar-blackstones.com), a cozy
farmhouse B&B located off the Ring of Kerry in the mountains, next to a
rushing river. Packies, Henry Street, Kenmare (% 053-41-508), a hip,
cheerful restaurant, serves up delectable dishes that range from tradi-
tional Irish to modern, internationally influenced fare.

elcome to Central Europe, the home of some of the
most romantic cities in the world. There’s dreamy
Prague, the “new” showcase city of Eastern Europe, and chic,
sophisticated Paris — where ﬁne food, high fashion, and great
art are part and parcel of everyday life. In atmospheric
Amsterdam, you can cruise the 17th-century canals, discover
museums crammed with Rembrandts and van Goghs, have a
peek at the infamous Red-Light District, and visit the house
where Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis. In
Munich, you can explore a city that revels in all the oompah-
band cheeriness of Bavaria and offers all the reﬁnements of a
great cultural center. Fascinating Vienna, a city renowned for
its musical heritage, offers a roster of fabulous cultural enjoy-
ments. In the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland, you can scale
the Alps on thrilling gondola rides, visit ice palaces carved
into glaciers, and marvel at the soaring mountaintop vistas.

Paris and Environs

 Getting to Paris
 Checking out the neighborhoods
 Discovering the best places to sleep and eat
 Exploring the highlights of the City of Light
 Side-tripping to Versailles and Chartres
A
ll clichés are based in truth and those about Paris are no different:
Paris is the City of Light. It’s a moveable feast. It’s the world capital
of romance, birthplace of bohemians and Impressionists, muse to
Hemingway and Gertrude Stein (who coined the term Lost Generation),
and the high temple of haute cuisine. You can (and probably will) grow
faint from so much great art at the Louvre, cruise the Seine past one of
the world’s most famous cathedrals, and gaze at the prison where Marie
Antoinette spent her last days. You can sip a pastis in a neighborhood
cafe, dine stupendously in a tiny bistro, or steal kisses while taking in
the view from the Pont des Arts footbridge.
Romanticizing this city is easy — just as it’s easy to belittle it. Even
Parisians seem to be losing a little heart. No doubt friends have regaled
you with their best rude-French stories, and you’ve heard that the muse-
ums are crowded, the traffic is horrendous, the pollution vile, the
Champs-Elysées has become a commercialized strip mall, and every-
thing is too expensive.
Don’t let these obstacles keep you from having a good time. Prepare
yourself for residents’ wariness of visitors, and you’ll be pleasantly sur-
prised when they show you how warm they can be. To beat the museum
crowds, go early. To avoid traffic, take the Métro (subway), one of the
most reliable and convenient transportation systems around. Or ride one
of the many bikes for rent around the city in Mayor Bertrand Delanoë’s
continuing quest to cut down on pollution and make Paris greener.
Sure, fast-food joints have mushroomed and movie multiplexes now
dominate the Champs-Elysées, but you can find elegant, authentic Paris
elsewhere, even a block away from the tourist crowds. And although you
can spend all your cash in Paris, there is no city with more great values
on everything from meals and hotels to shopping and museums. You

have to be willing to search those bargains out, and this chapter helps
you find some of them.
Finally, although those positives and negatives exist, they are by no means
the sum of the city. Paris strikes a lively balance between the vibrant,
modern metropolis of the 21st century (where residents can talk on cell-
phones in subway cars) and the majestic, historic city of Napoleon. It’s a
city of hip nightclubs, cutting-edge cuisine, and the highest fashion, as
well as one of venerable museums, legendary cafes, and sweeping 18th-
and 19th-century grandeur. This balance keeps Paris intriguing and addic-
tive, and visitors and faithful admirers return year after year.
Getting There
Getting to the center of Paris is easy whether you’re arriving by plane or
train. Getting around the city is a breeze, too, thanks to the efficient
Métro subway system.
Arriving by air
Most international flights land at Charles de Gaulle Airport (% 01-48-
62-22-80; www.adp.fr), also known as Roissy, 23km (14 miles) northeast
of the city. Most of the big-name transatlantic airlines arrive at terminals
1 and 3; Air France and its affiliates, intra-European carriers, and airlines
serving the rest of the world arrive at Terminal 2. Several ATMs are
located in the arrivals halls of the terminals.
If you aren’t overloaded with baggage and/or small children, the RER B
(commuter train) line runs into the center of Paris for 8.20 ($13)
adults, 5.80 ($9.30) children. The train is easy, cheap, and convenient,
and you can ride to and from the airport from 5 a.m. to midnight daily.
Free shuttle buses connect terminals CDG 1 and CDG 2 to the RER ticket
counter and train station. (Look for illustrated signs showing a bus, or
get directions from English-speaking personnel at the information desks
located on every arrivals-level floor.)
Buy the RER ticket at the RER ticket counter and hang onto it in case of
ticket inspection. (You can be fined if you can’t produce your ticket for
an inspector.) In any case, you need your ticket later to get off the RER
system and into the Métro (where you must buy a subway ticket to
enter). Individual tickets cost 1.50 ($2.40), but if you plan on staying a
few days, a carnet (pack of ten) costs only 11 ($18). A ticket counter
and ticket machines are at each Métro entrance.
Depending where your hotel is located, you exit the subway either on
the Right Bank or the Left Bank. From the airport station, trains depart
about every 15 minutes for the half-hour trip into town and stop on the
Right Bank at Gare du Nord and Châtelet–Les Halles, and on the Left
Bank at St-Michel, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, and Denfert-Rochereau,
before heading south out of the city.

Métro stations such as Châtelet–Les Halles have numerous stairways
and long corridors; you’ll want to avoid taking the RER if you have a lot
of baggage.
If you aren’t in a hurry to get into Paris proper, another cheap way to get
to town is by the bus service run by Air France. Les Cars Air France will
drop you off near such central Paris locations as the Arc de Triomphe,
Gare Montparnasse, Gare de Lyon, and Invalides. Buy your ticket
directly from the driver for 14 ($22) from Charles de Gaulle, 10 ($16)
from Orly (a 15 percent discount is given to groups of four or more). It
takes about an hour, sometimes more, from Charles de Gaulle, about 

45 minutes from Orly, depending on traffic. Look for signs on the arrivals
level for the gates where the bus is located, or go to www.airfrance.com
before your trip.
Another option is taking a taxi, but it’s not cheap: Around 50 ($80)
from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. and about 15 percent more at other times.
Some charter flights, as well as many national flights, land 14km (81⁄2
miles) south of town at Orly Airport (% 01-49-75-15-15; www.adp.fr).
French domestic flights land at Orly Ouest, and intra-European and inter-
continental flights land at Orly Sud. Shuttle buses connect these termi-
nals, and other shuttles connect them to Charles de Gaulle every 30
minutes or so. ATMs and information desks are located in the arrivals
hall of both terminals. A taxi from Orly to central Paris costs around 40
($64) and takes anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour. You can also take
one of two commuter trains. If you’re staying on the Left Bank, take the
RER C line by catching a free shuttle bus from Exit G, Platform 1, at Orly
Sud, or Exit G on the arrivals level at Orly Ouest, to the Rungis station,
where RER C trains leave every 15 minutes for Gare d’Austerlitz (near
the Jardin des Plantes, in the 13th arrondissement (municipal district);
see “Orienting Yourself in Paris,” below, for details about Paris’s
arrondissements). A one-way fare is 6 ($9.60). The trip into the city
takes 40 minutes, making various stops along the Seine on the Left Bank.
If you’re staying on the Right Bank, you can take the Orlyval/RER B line
to Antony Métro station. You connect at the Antony RER station, where
you board the RER B train to Paris. Hold onto the ticket because you’ll
need it to get into the Métro/RER system. A trip to the Châtelet station
on the Right Bank takes about 50 minutes and costs 9.30 ($15).
Arriving by rail
Paris has many rail stations, but most international trains arrive at one
of four places. The Gare du Nord serves northern Germany, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Denmark, and London. It’s the destination for both 
the Eurostar direct train that uses the Channel Tunnel (or Chunnel) — 
a dozen trains daily for a three-hour trip, four hours with the time
change — as well as trains arriving on the last leg of the old-fashioned
and highly not recommended route: London to Dover by train; Dover to
Calais by ferry; and Calais to Paris by train (101⁄2 long hours for the trip).
Trains from the southwest (the Loire Valley, Pyrénées, Spain) arrive at
the Gare d’Austerlitz. Those from the south and southeast (the Riviera,
Lyon, Italy, Geneva) pull in at the Gare de Lyon. Trains coming from
Alsace and eastern France, Luxembourg, southern Germany, and Zurich
arrive at the Gare de l’Est. The Gare Montparnasse serves as the point
for all trains from western and southwestern France, including Bordeaux
and Chartres. All train stations connect to Métro stations with the same
name. All Paris train stations are located within the first 15 arrondisse-
ments, and are easily accessible.

Orienting Yourself in Paris
The Seine River divides Paris between the Rive Droite (Right Bank) to
the north and the Rive Gauche (Left Bank) to the south. The city of
Paris’s origins date back thousands of years to the Ile de la Cité, an
island in the Seine that is still the center of the city and home to
Cathédrale de Notre-Dame.
The city is divided into 20 numbered arrondissements (municipal dis-
tricts). The layout of these districts follows a distinct snail-like pattern.
The first (abbreviated 1er for premiere) arrondissement is the dead
center of Paris, comprising an area around Notre-Dame and the Louvre.
From there, the rest of the districts spiral outward, clockwise, in ascend-
ing order. The lower the arrondissement number, the more central the
location. The last two digits of the postal code denote the actual
arrondissement, so an address listed as Paris 75003 is in the third
arrondissement, and 75016 is in the 16th.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Traditionally people consider the Right Bank to be more upscale, with
Paris’s main boulevards such as avenue Montaigne and rue du Faubourg-
St-Honoré, and museums such as the Louvre. The old bohemian half of
Paris is on the Left Bank, with the Latin Quarter around the university.
Among the major arrondissements (for visitors) on the Right Bank is the
3e. Called Le Marais, this bustling neighborhood manages to remain gen-
uinely Parisian amid the swirl of tourism in the city center, but sadly,
super-chic boutiques are chasing out Paris institutions such as Jo
Goldenberg, the venerable Jewish deli. The 4e includes most of Ile de la
Cité and its posh neighbor, Ile St-Louis; the Beaubourg pedestrian zone;
and the Centre Pompidou modern-art complex.
The 1er includes the Louvre neighborhood and the tip of Ile de la Cité.
The 8e — a natural extension westward of the 1er — is Paris’s most
upscale area, consisting of ritzy hotels, fashion boutiques, fine restau-
rants, and upscale town houses. The 8th arrondissement centers on the
grandest boulevard in a city famous for them: the Champs-Elysées. The
sidewalks of this historic shopping promenade were recently cleaned up
and widened. Now no more than a string of international chain stores
and movie theaters, the Champs-Elysées has become merely a shadow
of its former elegant self. For expensive boutique shopping, walk directly
north of the Champs to Rue Faubourg St-Honoré, where you’ll find
Pierre Cardin, Chanel, Yves St. Laurent, and Christian Lacroix, among
others.
From Place de la Concorde — an oval plaza at the western end of the
Louvre complex, where French royalty met the business end of a guillo-
tine during the Revolution — the Champs-Elysées beelines east–west to
the Arc de Triomphe. The Arc is one of the world’s greatest triumphal

arches, a monument to France’s unknown soldier and to the gods of car-
insurance premiums (surrounding the Arc is a five-lane traffic circle
where, it seems, anything goes). From the top of the Arc running in a
straight line, you can see its counterpart, the 110m-high (361-ft.) Grande
Arche de la Défense, in neighboring St-Denis.
Still echoing with the ghosts of Picasso’s Paris, in the northerly reaches
of the Right Bank lies Montmartre, topped by the fairy-tale gleaming
white basilica of Sacré-Coeur, and trampled by tourists. The neighbor-
hood is so distinct and (despite the numerous visitors) charming that it
gets its own write-up under “More cool things to see and do,” later in
this chapter.
Left Bank arrondissements include the 5e, the famous old Latin Quarter,
named for the language spoken by students attending the Sorbonne who
gave it its once-colorful atmosphere. These days, the quarter is another
sad Parisian shadow of former glory, its bohemia replaced by gyro
stands, souvenir shops, and hordes of tourists wondering why the Latin
Quarter was ever famous.
The adjacent 6e retains some of its counterculture charm. The students
of Paris’s Fine Arts School help liven up things here, especially in the
now highly fashionable but still somewhat artsy St-Germain-des-Prés
neighborhood of cafes, brasseries, and restaurants. Tucked into a wide
arc of the Seine, the 7e intrudes a bit on the St-Germain neighborhood,
but its major features are the Musée d’Orsay, the new Musée du Quai
Branly, the Tour Eiffel (Eiffel Tower), and the Musée Rodin.
Finding information after you arrive
The city’s tourist information office, L’Office du Tourisme et des
Congrès de Paris (www.parisinfo.com), maintains two full-service wel-
come centers. Both offer basic information about attractions in the city,
help with last-minute hotel reservations, make booking for day trips, and
sell transportation and museum passes — but for a small fee. The first,
in Gare du Nord (Métro: Gare du Nord), beneath the glass roof, is open
daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The second, the Opéra-Grands Magasins
Welcome Center, 11 rue Scribe (Métro: Opéra or Chaussée d’Antin), is
open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Several auxiliary offices, or welcome centers, are scattered throughout the
city. The office in Gare de Lyon (Métro: Gare de Lyon) is open Monday
through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The welcome center in Gare du
Nord is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. There are two offices in
Montmartre: one at 21 place du Tertre (Métro: Abbesses), open daily 
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the other on the median strip facing 72 bd.
Rochechouart (Métro: Anvers), open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The wel-
come center in the Louvre (Métro: Palais Royal or Musée du Louvre) is
open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., while the nearby Pyramides office, 25 rue
des Pyramides (Métro: Pyramides), is open June through October daily
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and November through May daily from 10 a.m. to 
Part IV: Central Europe 
224

6 p.m. Paris’s convention center, Paris Expo (Métro: Porte de Versailles),
has an information desk open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. during trade fairs.
Getting Around Paris
Paris has an extensive public-transportation system that makes it easy
for you to get around without having to rent a car. Transport tickets are
good on the Métro, bus, and RER lines. Individual tickets cost 1.50
($2.40), but a carnet (pack of ten) costs only 11 ($18).
Two types of cards offer unlimited travel on all forms of public trans-
portation: the “tourists’” Paris Visite and the locals’ Carte Orange
Hebdomadaire (Weekly Card Orange). You won’t find mention of the less-
expensive Carte Orange on the English-language version of www.ratp.
fr, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get the same savings a Parisian can;
you just have to ask for it.
The Carte Orange costs 16 ($26) for zones 1 and 2 and 22 ($35) for
zones 1, 2, and 3. You’ll need to provide a passport-size photo (or snap
one at photo booths in major train and Métro stations). Make sure you
get the hebdomadaire (weekly) and not the mensuel (monthly). The card
is valid Monday through Sunday and on sale Monday through Wednesday
of the same week, and Thursday through Sunday for the following week.
Avoid buying the card on Wednesday, the last day it’s on sale for the
week in which it’s valid, because you won’t get your money’s worth.
Buy the Paris Visite (the regular pass covers zones 1–3, which include
all of central Paris and many of its suburbs) if you’re in Paris for only a
day or two. At 8.50 ($14) for one day or 14 ($22) for two days (chil-
dren 4–11 pay half-price; children 3 and under ride free), you’ll still beat
the price of the Carte Orange. However, the three-day 19 ($30) and the
five-day 28 ($45) Visites are a waste of money.
More comprehensive Visite passes covering zones 1 through 6 (all the
’burbs, including Disneyland Paris) cost almost, or more than, twice as
much, depending on the duration of your pass.
Don’t pay for passes that carry you beyond zone 3; most of the interest-
ing monuments lie within zones 1 and 2.
By Métro (subway) and RER
The Paris Métro (% 32-46 within France, for information in English at
0.34/55¢ per minute; www.ratp.fr) is one of the best subways in
Europe, a clean, efficient, and well-interconnected system. Using a Métro
map (there’s one on the inside front cover of this book), find which num-
bered line you want to take and the name of the last station in the direc-
tion you want to go. In the Métro tunnels, follow signs for that line and
that last station to get on the train going the right way.
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 225

You may have to transfer to another line to get to your destination
(although usually not more than once per trip). When transferring,
follow the signs labeled CORRESPONDENCE to the next line. Don’t follow a
SORTIE sign, unless you want to exit. You can make unlimited transfers on
one ticket as long as you don’t exit the system — although you may
often find yourself walking long distances in the tunnels that connect
some transfer stations.
Most of the lines are numbered, but some are assigned letters. The let-
tered lines (A, B, C, and D) are technically not the Métro but are part of
the overlapping RER network. This high-speed commuter light-rail
system services only major stops within the city and extends much far-
ther out into the suburbs. The RER uses the same tickets as the Métro
(except when you’re traveling way out into the ’burbs, for which you
have to buy a separate ticket), and you can transfer freely between the
two systems.
The wait for arriving RER trains can be longer than the wait for a regular
subway train, so consider this before using the RER within the city.
Some RER lines are particularly useful; the C line, for instance, follows
the left bank of the Seine closely (no Métro line does this) and also
heads out to Versailles. Both ends of all RER lines split off like the frayed
ends of a rope as they leave the city, so make sure the train you board is
heading out to the numbered fork you want (for example, the C line has
eight different end destinations, C1 through C8). Maps on the platforms
show you the routes of each fork, and TV displays tell you when the next
half-dozen trains will be arriving and which number each one is.
By bus
Some people automatically discount the bus system in Paris because the
congested traffic conditions make the ride generally less efficient than
the Métro system (and, if you take it during rush hour, quite crowded).
However, if you’re tired of wandering around underground tunnels, the
bus system provides a dual service: transportation and a very cheap
sightseeing tour of Paris. Almost every bus line makes a trip along the
Right Bank of the Seine, giving passengers a glimpse of Ile St. Louis,
Notre-Dame, and often the fortified walls of the Louvre. The bus you’re
on may also pass any number of the beautiful avenues, fountains, or
sculptures that make Paris a beautiful city. Although the bus is not
always as quick as the Métro and can get caught in rush-hour traffic, it
stops in places that the Métro cannot and provides a refreshing and
sunny alternative. Buses use the same tickets as the Métro, but a single
ticket is only good for two sections to reach your destination, which can
make bus trips expensive. If you’re traveling through three or more sec-
tions, you need to punch two tickets.
You can find separate maps for each bus route posted at bus stops, and
each map has a blue-and-red bar running along the bottom. You can also
find maps and information online at www.ratp.fr. The stops that
Part IV: Central Europe 
226

appear directly above the blue section of this bar are within that stop’s
two-section limit. For stops appearing above the red section(s) of the
bar, you need to use two tickets. When the number of a bus route is writ-
ten in black on a white circle, it means that the bus stops there daily;
when it’s written in white on a black circle, it means the bus doesn’t stop
there on Sundays or holidays.
By taxi
Because cabs in Paris are scarce, picking up one at a stand may be
easier than hailing one in the street. Be careful to check the meter when
you board to be sure you’re not also paying the previous passenger’s
fare, and if your taxi lacks a meter, make sure to settle the cost of the
trip before setting out. Calling a cab to pick you up is more expensive
because the meter starts running when the cab receives the call, but if
you need to do it, call Alpha Taxis (% 01-53-60-63-50).
The initial fare for up to three passengers is 2.20 ($3.50) and, between
10 a.m. and 5 p.m., rises 0.86 ($1.40) for each kilometer. Between 5 p.m.
and 10 a.m., the standing charge remains the same, but the per-kilometer
charge rises to 1.12 ($1.80). An additional fee of 1 ($1.60) is imposed
for luggage weighing more than 5kg (11 lbs.) or for an extra bag. A fourth
passenger incurs a 2.85 ($4.55) charge.
By foot
Paris is a wonderful city for walking. Tourist attractions are spread
throughout the city, but many areas — along the Seine, in the cemeter-
ies, across the Pont Neuf — make for lovely strolls. Don’t expect to take
the Métro to the Eiffel Tower and then duck back underground quickly;
you’ll want to savor the scene.
On Sundays and public holidays, many Paris streets are closed to traffic
and open to pedestrians. The Paris Respire initiative includes the Seine
expressway on the Left Bank, between the Eiffel Tower and the Musée
d’Orsay; the expressway on the Right Bank, between Place de la
Concorde and Pont Charles de Gaulle; and the streets just south of
Jardin de Luxembourg. Also included are two areas beyond Paris’s ring
road: the Boie de Boulogne and Boie de Vincennes. These areas are ter-
rific venues for running, inline skating, or just ambling.
Staying in Paris
Paris has more than 2,200 hotels — chains, deluxe palace-like accommo-
dations, hotels that cater to business travelers, budget hotels, and mom-
and-pop establishments — so you’re sure to find a bed. The general
assumption, still holding true (but tenuously) these days, is that the
Right Bank has more upscale hotels, while the bohemian Left Bank
boasts more inexpensive options. On your first visit, you may want to
stay pretty close to the center of town, but don’t fret if the only room

you can find is out in les boondocks. Getting to the Louvre by Métro from
the 16e only takes a few minutes longer than it does from the Latin
Quarter. Besides, most repeat visitors find themselves drawn away from
the tourist center in favor of a more authentic Parisian neighborhood.
For a price, you can find that authenticity as close by as the Marais or
St-Germain-des-Prés.
In addition to the November-to-February low season, July and August
are also slow in Paris, and you can bargain for good rates. Multiple trade
fairs during May, June, September, and October tend to book up the
city’s four-star and luxury hotels.
The tourist offices (see “Finding information after you arrive,” earlier in
this chapter) will book a room for you, and they also broker last-minute
rooms that upper-class hotels have a hard time moving, so you may luck
into a deep discount on a posh pad.
Paris offers additional options for lodging — renting an apartment, for
example. Nothing beats living in Paris as a Parisian. In your own apart-
ment, you can cook with fresh produce from the local markets, taste fine
wines that would be too expensive in a restaurant, and entertain new
friends. Although the daily rate can be higher than a budget hotel, the
room will be larger, you can save money on meals, and in the end, you
may end up paying the same rate you would for room and board at a
hotel — or less. Companies offering attractive apartments at reasonable
prices are Apartment Living in Paris (www.apartment-living.com),
which is run by French real estate brokers, and Lodgis.com (www.
lodgis.com). Paris Vacation Rentals (www.rentals-paris.com) is an
agency that deals in short-term rentals of upscale apartments at very
good prices.
Paris’s top hotels
Grande Hôtel Jeanne d’Arc
$
The Marais (4e)
Located right in the heart of the charming Marais district off the pretty
Place Ste-Catherine, this hotel is often booked up to two months ahead of
time by regulars. Rooms are small to decent-sized with large windows,
card-key access, and large bathrooms, but storage space is a bit cramped.
Other room features include direct-dial telephones, cable TV, and bedside
tables. Some rooms don’t have a view, so if this is important to you, make
sure to request a view when you reserve. The hotel can be a little noisy, but
you’re near the Musée Picasso, place des Vosges, and the Bastille; the fab-
ulous Au Bistro de la Place is just one of the charming restaurants in the
square next door.

Hôtel d’Angleterre
$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
The high-beamed ceilings of this 18th-century Breton-style inn offer a slice
of U.S. history: When this was the British Embassy in 1783, the papers rec-
ognizing American independence were prepared here. Some rooms have
exposed stone walls and four-poster canopy beds, and all boast period fur-
nishings, carved-wood closet doors, and silk wall hangings. The “apart-
ments,” with two bedrooms, are ideal for families. The homey common
lounge has a piano, and in summer you can breakfast in a small lush court-
yard. Check the Web site for specials.

Hôtel de la Bretonnerie
$$
The Marais (4e)
This cozy hotel in the heart of the Marais boasts classic French style in
each of its rooms with unique décor, from Empire divans or Louis XIII
chairs to Napoleon III tables. The nicest are the chambres de charme, some
with canopy beds, some country-style with heavy beams and floral-print
walls. Classique rooms are smaller but still have nice touches, such as the
occasional four-poster bed. The snug duplexes are defined by beamed ceil-
ings and huge curtained windows. The vaulted stone breakfast room with
a pastel fresco adds a nice touch.

Hôtel de L’Elysée
$$$
Champs-Elysées (8e)
Wallpaper of stamped 18th-century etchings, built-in closets, half-headboards,
stuccoed ceilings, and a cozy sitting room with a fireplace just off the lobby
give this hotel close to the Champs-Elysées a homey feel. The wonderful
but small mansard suite no. 60 features wood beams overhead and sky-
lights set into the low, sloping ceilings, which provide peek-a-boo vistas of
Parisian rooftops and a perfectly framed view of the Eiffel Tower. All fifth-
and sixth-floor rooms enjoy at least rooftop views, the former from small
balconies. Note: You must climb an additional 15 steps to the top-floor
rooms after the elevator lets you off — a consideration for those with a lot
of luggage.

Hôtel de Lutèce
$$$
Ile St-Louis (4e)
The Lutèce is located on a street lined with restaurants and shops, just a
five-minute stroll from Notre-Dame, and occupies a converted 17th-
century house accented with rustic details such as wood-beam ceilings
and terra-cotta floors. It has comfy rooms that are large for such a central
(and chic) location, even if a few bathtubs could use curtains (many
Europeans would scoff at such a luxury). Des Deux-Iles (% 01-43-26-
13-35), a sibling hotel, is a few doors down at no. 59; between the two of
them, there’s a pretty good chance you can get a room.
See map p. 228. 65 rue St-Louis-en-l’Ile (on the main drag of the island). % 01-
43-26-23-52. Fax: 01-43-29-60-25. www.paris-hotel-lutece.com. Métro: Pont-
Marie. Rack rates: 189 ($302) double. Breakfast 11 ($18). AE, V.
Hôtel du Jeu de Paume
$$$$
Ile St-Louis (4e)
This is one of Paris’s more unusual hotels, an impressive, airy, three-story,
ancient wood skeleton inside a former jeu de paume (a precursor to tennis)
court. Scoop, a friendly Golden Retriever welcomes you to an interior that
seamlessly weaves modern and ancient, incorporating public lounges,
indoor and outdoor breakfast terraces, and a glass elevator. Most accom-
modations are on the snug to medium size, but the simplicity of the styl-
ishly modern décor under hewn beams keeps rooms from feeling cramped.
The three standard duplexes with spiral stairs are roomier, but if you’re stay-
ing five days or longer and want true bliss, check into one of the hotel’s two
apartments. The three-bedroom apartment is a duplex, with two bedrooms
and a living room below and a bedroom above, two bathrooms, and a pri-
vate terrace overlooking the small stone garden rimmed with flowers, where
guests — it can accommodate five people — can breakfast in nice weather.

Le Relais Christine
$$$$$
St-Germain-des-Pres (6e)
Passing through the cobbled courtyard to enter this early 17th-century
building, you feel less like you’re checking into a hotel and more like a
baron or baroness arriving at your own country manor house, with a cor-
dial staff to match. Many of the largish rooms are done in a contemporary
relaxed style, with such added touches as antique desks or chairs; the
grandest has a Louis XIII décor. Most suites are duplexes, with sitting areas
downstairs, marble bathrooms sporting double sinks, and a lofted bed-
chamber. The basement breakfast room, formerly a kitchen with a mas-
sive fireplace for show, is installed under the low rough vaulting of a
13th-century abbey founded by Saint Louis himself. A tranquil garden filled

with flowers makes this hotel a true haven from the yuppie bustle in the
neighborhood outside.

Pont Neuf). % 01-40-51-60-80. Fax: 01-40-51-60-81. www.relais-christine.com.

Port-Royal Hôtel
$
Latin Quarter (5e)
Although this hotel, owned by the same family since its creation in 1930,
is on the far edge of the Latin Quarter, the Métro stop down the block
keeps you only minutes from the city’s center. Its incredible rates come
with surprisingly nice and clean rooms. You have to pay a nominal fee for
showers (unless you have a bathroom en suite), but they’re modern and
don’t run out of hot water. In short, it’s a decent and completely unshabby
hotel at hostel prices.

Caron de Beaumarchais

The Marais (4e)
Caron de Beaumarchais is a boutique hotel at budget
rates, with an antiques-laden salon in place of a reception area and rooms
outfitted like those of an 18th-century Marais town house — wood ceilings
and a touch of gold around the carved filigree of curving chair backs and
mirror frames. Rooms in the front are largest. See map p. 228. 12 rue Vieille-

Hôtel Chambellan Morgane
$$$
Trocadéro (16e)
This small yet elegant hotel is comfortable and
has standard contemporary furniture and trim. Located in a quiet bour-
geois neighborhood, its location gives close and easy access to the Arc de
Triomphe, the Champs-Elysées, and the Eiffel Tower. See map p. 228. 6 rue

This hotel is no longer the flophouse
where Oscar Wilde died in 1900. In fact, in 2007, Harper’s Bazaar voted it
the best urban hotel in the world. It’s a funky velvet-and-marble monument,
with 20 smallish, carefully decorated rooms and furnishings ranging from
Louis XV and Empire styles to Art Nouveau. Customer service can be a bit

Montalembert
$$$$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (7e)
Montalembert is one of Paris’s top
hotels, with a unique meld of contemporary design, Art Deco fashion, and
French tradition (and amenities such as in-room VCRs, fax machines, and
modem lines). Deluxe bedrooms are Louis-Phillipe style, with heavily lac-
quered chestnut and gold Art Deco furnishings; junior suites are located
on upper floors and offer superb views of Paris, some of them from beneath
mansard roofs. Check the Web site for “long-stay” specials for three or more
nights. See map p. 228. 3 rue de Montalembert (off rue de Bac, behind the church of
St Thomas d’Aquin). % 01-45-49-68-68. www.montalembert.com.
Quai Voltaire
$$
St-Germain-des-Prés (7e)
The Quai Voltaire has clean and simple
midsize rooms. The dreamy Parisian view that overlooks the Seine to the
Louvre across the way comes with a price: traffic noise from the quai that
even the double-glazed windows don’t quite drown out. See map p. 228. 19

Timhotel Le Louvre
$$
Louvre (1er)
Two blocks from the Louvre, this was once a writers’ and
artists’ crash pad, but has been relentlessly renovated into cookie-cutter
blandness by a chain selling itself to the business set. Good value, but serv-
ice can be frosty. See map p. 228. 4 rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs (off rue St-Honoré,
2 blocks east of the Palais Royal). % 01-42-60-34-86. www.timhotel.com.
Dining in Paris
Yes, Paris—and the rest of the country—is a feast. Traditional haute 
cuisine — a delicate balance of flavors, sauces, and ingredients blended
with a studied technique — includes such classics as blanquette de veau
(veal in an eggy cream sauce), pot-au-feu (an excellent stew of fatty beef
and vegetables), coq au vin (chicken braised in red wine with onions and
mushrooms), bouillabaisse (seafood soup), and that hearty staple boeuf
bourguignon (beef stew with red wine).
But when people started thinking healthy a few decades back, buttery,
creamy, saucy French cuisine quickly found itself on the outs. So the
French invented nouvelle cuisine, which gave chefs an excuse to concoct
new dishes — still French, mind you, but less fattening because they use
fewer heavy creams and less butter and serve smaller portions.
When the nouvelle trend lost steam (in part because of its miniscule por-
tions), people began spinning off more healthful and/or more creative
cooking styles. Add to these styles the mix of French regional restaurants
and the many ethnic dining rooms, and you’ll never want for variety.
Part IV: Central Europe 
234

A French economic crisis in the 1990s forced many restaurants to lower
their prices, and some top chefs found opportunity in the downturn by
opening up baby bistros, small, relaxed eateries with menus designed by
the biggest names in the business and prices up to 75 percent below
what you’d pay in these chefs’ flagship restaurants. Wildly popular, most
baby bistros are still going strong a decade later.
Your waiter or the restaurant’s wine steward should be able to pair your
meal with an appropriate vintage wine. Or better yet, check out Wine For
Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed McCarthy and Mary Ewing-Mulligan (Wiley
Publishing, Inc.). Ordering wine by the bottle can jack up the cost of
your meal in no time, so be careful. Table wine by the liter carafe or demi
(half a liter) is always cheaper. The top reds are produced in Bordeaux,
Burgundy, Beaujolais, and the Loire and Rhone valleys. Great whites 
hail from Alsace, the Loire, Burgundy (if you can afford it, Meursault is
simply a wonder), and Bordeaux. And don’t forget that sparkling white
wine from the vineyards east of Paris called Champagne.
Some people may be intimidated by the idea of sitting down to what
many consider the most refined food on the planet. Don’t sweat it. The
only people with a need to impress anyone are the chef and kitchen
staff. Have your waiter suggest some dishes, and then just sit back and
enjoy the flavors.
If you’re looking for a meal in a hurry, try Paris’s greatest street food,
crepes, sold at sidewalk stands and from store windows. They’re best
when cooked fresh on the spot for you, but in touristy areas, crepe
stands often make up stacks in advance and merely reheat them on the
griddle when you approach.
You can visit a supermarket or gourmet store for your picnic supplies,
but shopping at the little local food stores and street markets is more
fun. Pick up a baguette at the boulangerie (bakery), cured meats and the
like at a charcuterie, and other groceries at an épicerie. Top it all off with
some fruit, pastries from a pâtisserie, a bottle of wine, and you’re set.
Au Bascou
$$
Le Marais (3e)
BASQUE
In a simple and softly lit rustic interior, some of the best Basque dishes in
Paris can be found here. (The Basque region is the corner of southwestern
France, resting along the Spanish border, and is known for its distinct
dialect and the excellent culinary skills of its citizens.) Consider starting
with a pipérade basquaise (a light terrine of eggs, tomatoes, and spices)
before moving on to roast wild duck or rabbit in a red-wine sauce. A bottle
of Irouléguy, a smooth red Basque wine, makes a nice accompaniment to
meals. The service, though friendly, at times can leave a lot to be desired.
You may want to save this place for a night when you don’t want to linger
over dinner.

Bofinger

Bastille (4e)
ALSATIAN
Parisians like to joke that the clientele at this famous restaurant near the
Bastille is made up of tourists and elderly locals. But Bofinger, which first
opened in 1864, continues to pack them in, with waiters in long white aprons
delivering hearty cuisine, much of it based on the Franco-Germanic cook-
ing of the Alsace region — lots of choucroute (sauerkraut, usually served
with sausages or other cuts of pork). The downstairs dining room is ornately
decorated with Art Nouveau flourishes and a glass-domed ceiling. Upstairs
is cozier with wood paneling. It’s owned by the Flo brasserie chain, which
means that you’ll see similar menus in the chain’s other restaurants, which
include Julien and Brasserie Flo. Service can be whirlwind. Brasseries are
good for off-hours dining, tending to stay open until 1 a.m.

Trendy artist types, musicians, and locals have been packing the house for

Brazil to Lebanese parents, and his menu not only shows it but attracts a

the Limoges porcelain and Riedel stemware created for the restaurant. The
sumptuous and inventive cuisine is served by the perfect wait staff. Diners
may start with an eggplant risotto, with a carpaccio of cèpes (mushrooms)
from Sologne, served with black truffles, and then continue with milk-fed
Pyrenées lamb roasted in sesame and mint cream. For dessert, a Manjari

L’Epi Dupin is still perhaps the best of the baby bistros (see the introduc-

fine modern bistro cuisine with an antique French setting of hewn beams
and stone walls (though tables are quite close together). The food, which
Pasteau buys fresh daily at the Rungis green market, runs to traditional
rural French, with lighter, modern alternatives such as salmon carpaccio
or endive tatin with goat cheese. Service, though friendly, can be seriously
rushed as staff scramble to accommodate three seatings a night.

St-Germain-des-Prés (6e)
MODERN BISTRO
William Ledeuil opened this hip and sophisticated place in 2002 near the
trendy Les Bookinistes, where he previously worked as chef. It is indeed
an art gallery and kitchen: the walls of the spacious and spare dining room
feature as their only decoration artwork that changes every three months.
The innovative, Asian-inspired menu, created from a tiny windowed
kitchen at the far side of the room, changes every five weeks. The menu is
broken down into categories of soups, pastas, and grilled (à la plancha)
items. Starters may include a soup of snail and conchiglie pasta, flavored
with a horseradish-parsley emulsion, or duck ravioli with Thai herbs.
Mains may be grilled milk-fed lamb served with a spicy teriyaki and orange
condiment, or grilled sea scallops with lemongrass and kumquat confit
and a coriander-flavored potato croquette. Because portions are small,
you’ll more than likely have room for dessert, which may include tasty
ginger-orange cake served with a blood-orange sorbet.

Exploring Paris
By far Paris’s best buy is the Paris Museum Pass, formerly known as the
Carte Musées et Monuments (www.parismuseumpass.fr). This card
lets you into most Parisian sights free (the only notable exceptions are
the Eiffel and Montparnasse towers and the Marmottan museum). 
It’s offered in three versions: a two-consecutive-day pass (30/$48), a
four-consecutive-day pass (45/$72), and a six-consecutive-day pass
(60/$96). The biggest benefit is that you don’t have to wait in line at
Part IV: Central Europe 
238

most museums and monuments! You just saunter up to a separate
window, and they wave you through. You can buy the pass at any branch
of the tourist office, at most museums and monuments, and at any Fnac
store (a French chain store selling electronics and music), one of which
is conveniently located at 74 Champs-Elysées.
Paris’s top sights
Cathédrale de Notre-Dame (Notre-Dame Cathedral)
Ile de la Cité (4e)
“Our Lady of Paris” is the heart and soul of the city. The Gothic church
constructed between the 12th and 14th centuries dominates the Seine and
the Ile de la Cité, as well as the history of Paris. Notre-Dame is a study in
Gothic beauty and gargoyles, at once solid, with squat, square facade
towers, and graceful, with flying buttresses around the sides. It’s been
remodeled, embellished, ransacked, and restored so often that it’s a
wonder it still has any architectural integrity at all (during the Revolution,
it was even stripped of its religion and rechristened the Temple of Reason).
A circular bronze plaque in the cathedral marks Kilomètre Zéro, from which
all distances in France have been measured since 1768. And in many ways,
Notre-Dame is the center of France. Crusaders prayed here before leaving
for the holy wars. Napoleon crowned himself emperor here, and then
crowned his wife Josephine empress. When Paris was liberated during
World War II, General de Gaulle rushed to this cathedral to give thanks.
Visiting Notre-Dame takes a good hour to 90 minutes out of your day. The
highlight for kids will undoubtedly be climbing the 387 narrow and wind-
ing steps to the top of one of the towers for a fabulously Quasimodo view
of the gargoyles and of Paris (set aside at least 45 minutes for this, more
during high tourist season — and note that the entrance to the towers is
outside the cathedral on the left side of the facade on rue du Cloître-Notre
Dame). However, if you plan to visit the tower, go early in the morning.
Lines stretch down the square in front of the cathedral during the summer.
If you do find yourself caught in a line, you have a chance to admire the
Bible stories played out in intricate stone relief around the three great por-
tals on the facade. Much of the facade was (poorly) restored once in the
18th century and then again (as well as could be done) in the 19th. If you’re
keen to see some medieval originals, the upper tier of the central portal is
ancient, and much of the sculpture on the right-hand portal has also sur-
vived from 1165 to 1175.
The main draw, however, is the three enormous rose windows, especially
the 69-foot diameter north window (left transept), which has retained
almost all its original 13th-century stained glass. Save Notre-Dame for a
sunny day to see the best light effects.
One last thing you shouldn’t forget to do is to walk around the building.
Those famous flying buttresses at the very back, holding up the apse 
with 50-foot spans of stone strength, are particularly impressive. Around
the south side and the back are gardens in which to rest and enjoy the
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 239

structure, as well as a small playground. Cross the Seine to admire 
the entire effect from the quay on the Left Bank. Free guided tours in
English are on offer Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday (donations are
appreciated).
At the opposite end of the square (about 60m/200 ft.) from the cathedral’s
front door, a flight of steps leads down to the Archaeological Crypt (% 01-
55-42-50-10), a 260-foot gallery extending under Notre-Dame’s square. This
excavation includes the jumbled foundations, streets, and walls of a series
of Parises, including the medieval and Roman cities. You can even see a
house from Lutèce — the town built by the Celtic Parisii tribe that flour-
ished on the Ile de la Cité over 2,000 years ago. The crypt is open Tuesday
through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission is 3.30 ($5.30) adults,
1.60 ($2.55) students 14 to 26, free for children 13 and under.

Centre Pompidou
The Marais (4e)
Brightly colored escalators, elevators, air-conditioning, and tubular pas-
sages resembling a giant gerbil habitat run along this building’s facade, but
the inside is a wonderfully spacious haven in which to view, touch, or
listen to modern art and artists. The Pompidou is Paris’s homage to 20th-
century creativity. Aside from the gallery of modern art, see exhibits on
industrial design, music research, photography, and the history of film.
Even if you don’t want to spend an hour or two with the exhibits inside,
come by to shake your head at the wildly colorful and controversial trans-
parent inside-out architecture — which was outrageously avant-garde in
the 1970s, but by 1998 had deteriorated so badly they had to shut it down
for 18 months of repairs — and to watch the street performers on the slop-
ing square out front.

Musée de l’Orangerie des Tuileries
Jardin des Tuileries (1er)
Since spring 2006, visitors have been delighting in the newly renovated
Musée de l’Orangerie, which underwent repairs for close to a decade. The
Part IV: Central Europe 
240

highlight of the Orangerie is its two oval rooms wrapped nearly 360
degrees with Monet’s Nymphéas, the waterlily series he painted especially
for the Orangerie, and these rooms were the primary focus of the renova-
tions. The immense and awe-inspiring murals simply pop from their spot-
less cream-white walls, lit brightly enough to accentuate all the beautifully
emotional colors. But don’t make the waterlily paintings your sole reason
to visit. Since 1984, the museum has also housed the remarkable John
Walter and Paul Guillaume art collection, comprising works by Cézanne,
Renoir, Rousseau, Matisse, Modigliani, Dérain, Picasso, and Soutine, among
other artists.

Musée d’Orsay
St-Germain-des-Prés (7e)
In 1986, this brilliantly renovated train station opened to the public, giving
the world one of its greatest museums of 19th-century art with an unsur-
passed collection of Impressionist masterpieces. Many of the works are
so widely reproduced that you may wander through with an eerie feeling
of déjà vu. Degas’s ballet dancers and l’Absinthe; Monet’s women in a
poppy field, his Rouen Cathedral painted under five different lighting con-
ditions, and his giant Blue Waterlilies; van Gogh’s Restaurant de la Siréne,
self-portraits, peasants napping against a haystack, and Bedroom at Arles;
Whistler’s Mother; and Manet’s groundbreaking Picnic on the Grass and
Olympia, which together helped throw off the shackles of artistic conser-
vatism and gave Impressionism room to take root.
Give yourself three hours, including a lunch break in the museum’s gor-
geous, turn-of-the-20th-century Musée d’Orsay restaurant on the middle
level, or the Café des Hauteurs with a great view of the Seine through the
enormous clock window. Check the Web site for combined admission with

Musée du Louvre (Louvre Museum)
Louvre (1er)
The magnificent Louvre palace evolved during several centuries, first open-
ing as a museum in 1793, and it would take you a month of visits to see the
more than 35,000 treasures it houses. But a visit to the Louvre doesn’t have
to be overwhelming. The museum is organized in three wings — Sully,
Denon, and Richelieu — over four floors, exhibiting art and antiquities from
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 241

Oriental, Islamic, Egyptian, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, European, and North
and South American civilizations, and sculpture, objets d’art, paintings,
prints, drawings, and the moats and dungeon of the medieval Louvre
fortress.
When you’re in a hurry, but you want to do the Louvre on your own, do a
quick, “best of the Louvre” tour on either Wednesday or Friday when 
the museum is open until 9:45 p.m. Start with Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona
Lisa (Denon wing, first floor); on the same floor nearby are two of the
Louvre’s most famous French paintings, Géricault’s The Raft of Medusa and
Delacroix’s Liberty Guiding the People. Next, visit the Winged Victory and
Michelangelo’s Slaves (both Denon wing, ground floor) before seeing the
Venus de Milo (Sully wing, ground floor). After that, let your own interests
guide you.
You can take three steps that will help your Louvre experience be an enjoy-
able one. First, buy your tickets in advance. If you’re in the United States
or Canada, you can purchase tickets online from www.ticketweb.com
(don’t be put off by the “Paris, CA” location denoted on the Web site; this
is the Louvre in Paris, France) and have them delivered to your home
before departure. Others can use www.fnac.com or www.ticketnet.com.
(All online ticket outlets charge a service fee.) If you happen to be strolling
on the Champs-Elysées before you visit the Louvre, you can visit the Fnac
location at 74 Champs-Elysées and buy your ticket in person there. Second,
grab a free map of the Louvre at the information desk under the pyramid,
get a free guide, and look for the brochure for visitors in a hurry. The Virgin
bookstore in the Carrousel du Louvre sells many comprehensive guides
and maps in English, as well as the guidebook, The Louvre, First Visit. And
third, take a guided tour. You can try a 90-minute tour by a museum guide
(% 01-43-20-53-17) that covers the most popular works and gives you a
quick orientation to the museum’s layout. Times and prices vary. Ask at
the information desk inside the Louvre beneath the pyramid. Also, before
you leave for your trip, access the museum’s terrific comprehensive Web
site, www.louvre.fr. A self-guided tour of the masterpieces of the Louvre
is already mapped out for you.
I. M. Pei’s glass pyramid is the main entrance to the museum; pregnant
women, visitors with children in strollers, and those with disabilities have
priority. Avoid this entrance and its long lines by using the 99 rue de
Rivoli/Carrousel du Louvre entrance; take the Métro to the Palais Royal-
Musée du Louvre stop, which deposits passengers into the Carrousel; or
take the stairs at the Porte des Lions near the Arc du Triomphe du
Carrousel (the arch resembling a smaller Arc de Triomphe). Those who
already have tickets or have the Paris Museum Pass can use the special
entrance to the Louvre at the passage Richelieu, between rue de Rivoli
and the courtyard.
Tickets are valid all day, so you can enter and exit the museum as many
times as you prefer. Admission is reduced after 6 p.m. on Monday and
Wednesday, and free the first Sunday of each month.

Musée du Quai Branly
St-Germain-des-Prés (7e)
This is the newest art museum in Paris, just a block from the Eiffel Tower,
opening in June 2006 to much fanfare. Designed by Jean Nouvel, who also
designed the Fondation Cartier and the Institut du Monde Arabe, there is
plenty of glass to let in light. Housed in four spectacular buildings, with a
garden walled off from the quai Branly, the art, sculpture, and cultural
materials of a vast range of non-Western civilizations are separated into
sections that represent the traditional cultures of Africa, East and South-
east Asia, Oceania, Australia, the Americas, and New Zealand. The pieces
come from the now-defunct Musée des Arts Africains et Océaniens, the
Louvre, and the Musée de l’Homme. Temporary exhibits are shown in
boxes all along the 180m (600-ft.) exhibition hall. Tribal masks of different
cultures are among the most impressive. Allow two hours for a full visit;
also take a stroll in the carefully manicured garden, or refresh yourself in
the small cafeteria across from the main building. There are numerous
entrances to the museum grounds from the area near the Eiffel Tower, but
the main entrance is on quai Branly.

Musée Picasso (Picasso Museum)
The Marais (3e)
This museum, in a historic hôtel particulier, or mansion, in the Marais, was
created in 1973 by Picasso’s heirs, who donated his personal art collec-
tion to the state in lieu of paying $50 million worth of outrageous inheri-
tance taxes. You can pay a visit to the Musée Picasso on each trip to Paris
and see something different each time because the works are rotated in
this space, which isn’t, unfortunately, large enough to house everything.
The spectacular collection includes more than 200 paintings, nearly 160
sculptures, 88 ceramics, and more than 3,000 prints and drawings. Every
phase of Picasso’s prolific 75-year career is represented. A visit here is well
worth the trip; make sure to walk around the neighborhood afterward to
shop the trendy boutiques and fill up on falafel from one of the numerous
stands on and around rue des Rosiers.

Musée Rodin (Rodin Museum)
Les Invalides (7e)
After the critics stopped assailing Rodin’s art, they realized that he had
been the greatest sculptor since Michelangelo, and the studio where Rodin
worked from 1908 until his death in 1917 was opened as a museum to
house some of the artist’s greatest works. Among the museum’s 2,000 rose
bushes in its gardens you can see The Thinker, The Gate of Hell, The Burghers
of Calais, and Balzac. Inside are many famed sculptures — The Kiss, The
Three Shades, The Hand of God, Iris — along with some of Rodin’s draw-
ings and works by his friends and contemporaries, such as his lover
Camille Claudel. You can view all the works in 45 minutes. Or, if you don’t
want to go inside, pay the 1 ($1.60) admission to visit just the gardens.
Check the Web site for combined admission with Musée d’Orsay.

Sainte-Chapelle
Ile de la Cité (4e)
Save Sainte-Chapelle for the early afternoon of a sunny day, because the
effect of its 15 perfect stained-glass windows soaring 50 feet high to a star-
studded vaulted ceiling is purely kaleidoscopic. Each of the 1,134 stained-
glass scenes depicts a biblical story. Louis IX had this Gothic chapel, which
is actually two chapels, constructed one on top of the other; built between
1246 and 1248, it housed the Crown of Thorns he purchased for an exor-
bitant sum. Some evenings the upper chapel becomes a venue for classi-
cal music concerts, and the effects of the chandelier lights dancing off the
windows is magical.

Tour Eiffel (Eiffel Tower)
Les Invalides (7e)
Did you know that the Eiffel Tower’s usefulness as a transmitter of 
telegraph — and later, radio and TV — signals saved it from demolition?
Part IV: Central Europe 
244

Designed as a temporary exhibit for the Paris Exhibition of 1899, Gustave
Alexandre Eiffel’s tower rises 317m (1,056 ft.) above the banks of the Seine,
and Eiffel managed to rivet together all 7,000 tons of it (with 2.5 million
rivets) in less than two years.
Critics of the day assailed its aesthetics, but no one could deny the feat of
engineering. The tower remained the tallest man-made structure in the
world until the Chrysler Building stole the title in 1930, and its engineer-
ing advances paved the way for the soaring skyscraper architecture of the
20th century. The restaurants and bars on the first level are pricey but not
bad. The view from the second level is an intimate bird’s-eye view of Paris;
from the fourth level, you can see the entire city spread out below and, on
a good day, as far out as 68km (42 miles). Visibility is usually best near
sunset; pausing for vistas at all levels takes about 90 minutes.
Some advice: Six million people visit the Eiffel Tower each year. To avoid
loonnnggg lines, go early in the morning or in the off-season. If this isn’t
possible, allow at least three hours for your visit: one hour to line up for
tickets and another two just to access the elevators on levels one and two.
If you must eat at the tower, food is available at the Altitude 95 restaurant
on the first floor, which is simply gorgeous but overpriced for the quality
of its meals, and there are a first-floor snack bar and second-floor cafete-
ria, also not the best of values. The best food at the Eiffel Tower is also its
most expensive: The Michelin-starred Jules Verne, one of Paris’s most cel-
ebrated restaurants, is on the Eiffel Tower’s second level.

More cool things to see and do
 Squandering the day away in a cafe: Many European cultures have
a third place, between home and work, where citizens play out
their lives. In Paris, it’s the cafe, a sort of public extension of the
living room; after all, they don’t have nearly as much space as
North Americans with our vast fruited plains and purple mountain
majesties. In the cafe, you can sit all day reading the paper over a
single cup of coffee or order a light meal or a glass of regional wine.
Ensconce yourself indoors or stand at the bar (this is cheaper!),
but most people choose to sit outside — in a glassed-in porch in
winter or on the sidewalk in summer — because one of the cafe’s
biggest attractions is the people-watching — and all without the
harsh scent of cigarettes. A law that banned smoking in most public
places was passed in February 2007; cafes and restaurants had 11
more months to get with the program. Many cafes now have out-
side dining year-round (with the help of heat lamps), where diners
can comfortably eat and smoke without feeling much cold.
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 245

Here are some classic cafes: Les Deux Magots, 6 place St-Germain-
des-Prés (% 01-45-48-55-25; www.lesdeuxmagots.fr), established
in 1914, was the haunt of Picasso, Hemingway, and Sartre, who
wrote a whole trilogy holed up at a table in its neighboring Café de
Flore, 172 bd. St-Germain-des-Pres (% 01-45-48-55-26; www.cafe-
de-flore.com), a Left Bank cafe frequented by Camus and Picasso
and featured in Gore Vidal novels. The Champs-Elysées may no
longer be Paris’s hot spot, but Fouquet’s at no. 99 (% 01-40-69-
60-50) is an institution with good past reviews by such legends 
as Chaplin, Churchill, FDR, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
Henry Miller had his morning porridge at La Coupole, 102 bd. du
Montparnasse (% 01-43-20-14-20), a brasserie that also hosted 
the likes of Josephine Baker, John Dos Passos, Salvador Dalí, and 
F. Scott Fitzgerald. Finally, you can make a pilgrimage to the Art
Nouveau interiors of La Rotonde, 105 bd. du Montparnasse (% 01-
43-26-48-26), risen like a phoenix from the ashes of its namesake
that once stood here. In The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway writes of
the original, “No matter what cafe in Montparnasse you ask a taxi
driver to bring you to . . . they always take you to the Rotonde.”
 Paying homage to the cultural giants at Cimetière du Père-
Lachaise (Père-Lachaise Cemetery): Though it’s well off the beaten
path, visiting this small city of the dearly departed is well worth 
the trip. Chopin, Gertrude Stein, Delacroix, Proust, Rossini, Oscar
Wilde, Georges Bizet, Ingres, Isadora Duncan, Pissaro, Molière,
Edith Piaf, Modigliani, and The Doors’ Jim Morrison — you couldn’t
imagine most of these people getting together in life, but they fit
well together in death. Pick up the map of the graves and spend a
morning under the trees of this vast and romantic cemetery of
rolling hills and historic tombs. To get there, take the Métro to
Père-Lachaise.
 Strolling through Montmartre, the original bohemian ’hood:
Although inundated by tourists these days, Montmartre, an old
artists’ neighborhood crowning a hill at Paris’s northern edge (the
18e), still has an intriguing village flavor. The Abbesses Métro stop
is in Montmartre itself, but get off one stop early at Pigalle.
Here you’re on the northwest edge of Paris’s red-light district, cen-
tered on the sex shop–lined boulevard de Clichy, which features
such hangers-on as the Moulin Rouge at no. 87 (% 01-53-09-82-82;
www.moulinrouge.com), which has been packing in audiences
since 1889 with its bare-breasted can-can, and the surprisingly
quasi-tasteful Musèe de l’Erotisme (Museum of the Erotic) at no. 72
(% 01-42-58-28-73), which is open from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m.; admis-
sion is 8 ($13).
Work your way uphill to the Basilique du Sacré-Coeur (% 01-53-
41-89-00; www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com), the domed white
neo-Byzantine basilica built from 1876 to 1919 that towers over the
city. Climb the dome for a vista that, on clear days, extends 56km
(35 miles).
Part IV: Central Europe 
246

Some of Montmartre’s quirkiest sights include a pair of windmills,
visible from rue Lepic and rue Girardon, and Paris’s only vineyard,
on rue des Saules. Next-door to the latter, at rue St-Vincent 12, is
the Musèe de Vieux Montmartre (Museum of Old Montmartre; 
% 01-49-25-89-37), dedicated to the neighborhood in a house that
was at times occupied by van Gogh, Renoir, and Utrillo.
Pay your respects to the writers Stendhal and Dumas, the com-
posers Offenbach and Berlioz, and the painter Degas at their graves
in the Cimetière de Montmartre on avenue Rachel. Finish the
evening at 22 rue des Saules in Au Lapin Agile (% 01-46-06-85-87;
www.au-lapin-agile.com) — called Café des Assassins in Picasso
and Utrillo’s day. The cover, including first drink, is a steep 24
($38) adults, 17 ($27) for students with a valid school ID.
 Window-shopping with the best of them: Paris is a world shopping
capital. On boulevard Haussmann rise Paris’s two flagships of shop-
ping, the department stores Au Printemps (no. 64) and Galeries
Lafayette (no. 40). Au Printemps is a bit more modern and
American-styled, and Galeries Lafayette is more old-world French,
but both are very upscale and carry the ready-to-wear collections
of all the major French designers and labels. Or try the Left Bank’s
only department store, the exquisite Le Bon Marché, which carries
international designers and wonderful cosmetics and has one of
Paris’s best grocery stores, Le Grand Épicerie, next door.
If you prefer to shop designer boutiques, the best concentrations of
stores are in the adjoining 1er and 8e. No single street offers more
shops than the long rue du Faubourg St-Honoré/rue St-Honoré and
its tributaries. Even if you can’t afford the prices, having a look is
fun. Big fashion houses, such as Hermès (no. 24), hawk ties and
scarves, Au Nain Blue (no. 406) has one of the fanciest toy empori-
ums in the world, and the prices at La Maison du Chocolat (no. 225)
are as rich as the confections.
Some of the best food shopping is concentrated on place de la
Madeleine, 8e, home to Fauchon (at no. 26), Paris’s homage to the
finest edibles money can buy (although it faces serious competition
from neighbor Hediard, no. 21). Jewels glitter on place Vendôme,
1er, at Cartier (no. 23), Chaumet (no. 12), and Van Cleef & Arpels
(no. 22). Stink like the best of them with discounts on French per-
fumes at Parfumerie de la Madeleine, 9 place de la Madeleine, 8e.
 Having a flea market fling: If the prices at Cartier, Hermès, and
the like set your head to spinning, you may have more luck at the
Marché aux Puces de St-Ouen/Clignancourt, the city’s most
famous flea market (closed Sun). It’s a group of several markets
comprising almost 3,000 stalls, along avenue de la Porte de
Clignancourt and rue des Rosiers. Ignore the stalls that begin pop-
ping up at the Porte de Clignancourt underpass and selling cheap
junk, and turn left onto rue des Rosiers. Be alert for pickpockets. At
press time, ATMs were few, so make sure to carry enough money in
a safe place.
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 247

Usually, Monday is the best day to get a bargain, because the crowds
are fewer and vendors are anxious for the dough. Keep in mind,
though, that you can get a better price if you speak French and show
that you’re serious about and respectful of the merchandise.
Hours vary with the weather and the crowds, but stalls are usually
up and running between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. Take the Métro to
Porte de Clignancourt; from there, turn left and cross boulevard
Ney, and then walk north on avenue de la Porte de Clignancourt.
 Cruising the Seine: Is there anything more romantic than slipping
down the current of one of the world’s great rivers past famous
cathedrals, museums, palaces — and the prison where Marie
Antoinette spent her last days? Well, perhaps killing the canned PA
sightseeing commentary and getting rid of all the other camera-
clicking tourists would help the romantic mood, but if it’s mood
you’re after, you can always take a more refined, though wildly
expensive, dinner cruise.
The classic Bateaux-Mouches float down the Seine is offered by sev-
eral companies, the biggest being Bateaux Parisiens (% 01-46-99-
43-13; www.bateauxparisiens.com), which departs from quai
Montebello or from pont d’Iena at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, and
Les Vedettes du Pont-Neuf (% 01-46-33-98-38; www.vedettes
dupontneuf.com), which leaves from Pont Neuf on the Ile de la
Cité. Vessels depart every half-hour (less often in winter). Regular
one-hour trips with multilingual commentary cost 10 ($16) adults,
5 ($8) children 3 to 12, free for children 2 and under. Departure
intervals and fares are the same for both companies listed here.
After dark, the boats sweep both banks with megapowered 
floodlights — illuminating everything very well, but sort of spoiling
the romance. These tend to be touristy, too, as are the more refined
luncheon or dinner cruises, which are more expensive — 52 to
72 ($83–$115) for lunch and 95 to 150 ($152–$240) for jacket-
and-tie dinner cruises — and the food is only so-so. The setting,
however, can’t be beat.
A cheaper, and less-contrived, alternative to the daytime tour is 
the Batobus (% 08-25-01-01 [0.15/25¢ per minute for the call];
www.batobus.com), a water taxi with no piped-in commentary that
stops every 25 minutes at eight major points of interest: the Eiffel
Tower, the Musée d’Orsay, St-Germain-des-Prés, Notre-Dame,
the Jardin des Plantes, Hôtel de Ville, Louvre, and the Champs-
Elysées. A day ticket costs 12 ($19) adults, 6 ($9.60) children 15
and under. Batobus runs mid-March through May and September
through the beginning of November every 25 to 30 minutes from 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 9:30 p.m. June–Aug); from November
through January 8 and from February 3 through mid-March,
Batobus runs every half-hour from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

 Paying a visit to le Mickey: Contrary to popular belief, more 
visitors head to Disneyland Paris (% 407-934-7639 in the U.S.,
01-60-30-60-53 in Paris; www.disneylandparis.com) than to 
the Louvre. The theme park, a slightly Europeanized version of
California’s Disneyland, with both familiar and new versions of
rides and those contrived cultural areas, has been a fantastic suc-
cess and inundated with guests since its opening day. The early
financial troubles that occurred when more people than expected
stayed in Paris rather than in the Disney hotels have been reversed.
To get there, take the A line RER from such central Paris RER/Métro
stops as Châtelet–Les-Halles, Nation, or Gare de Lyon to Marne-la-
Vallée/Chessy, within walking distance of the park. The RER station
is in zone 5 of the public-transport system, so the cheapest way
there (and back again) is to buy a single-day Mobilis pass good
through zone 5, which costs 13 ($21). Admission to the park from
April through November is 57 ($91) adults, 49 ($78) children 3
to 11, free for children 2 and under. The hours of Disneyland Paris
vary with the weather and season, so call before setting out. In gen-
eral, however, the park is open daily from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. It some-
times opens an hour later in mid-May, mid-June, and September
and October.
Guided tours
The top tour-bus company in town is Grayline’s Cityrama (% 01-44-55-
60-00; www.cityrama.com), which has a 11⁄2-hour, top-sights tour daily at
10 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.; the cost is 20 ($32) adults, 10 ($16)
children 4 to 11, free for children 3 and under. Cityrama also offers vari-
ous full-day tours of Paris from 78 to 100 ($125–$160), and three- and
four-hour historic- and major-sights tours starting at 48 ($77). The
four-hour “Seinorama” tour (daily at 2:15 p.m.) includes a drive up the
Champs-Elysées, a one-hour cruise on the Seine, and a stroll to the
second floor of the Eiffel Tower. It costs 48 ($77) adults, 24 ($38)
children 11 and under.
Cityrama also offers a variety of Paris by Night tours with bus trips
around the illuminated city and perhaps a dinner and Seine Cruise start-
ing from 27 ($43); more deluxe packages include a show at the Moulin
Rouge or Paradis Latin or dinner in the Eiffel Tower (prices start at
98/$157). Cityrama offers free pickup from some hotels, or you can
meet at its office at 2 rue des Pyramides (Métro: Pyramides), between
rue St-Honoré and rue de Rivoli (across from the Louvre).
L’Open Tour (www.ratp.fr) offers three hop-on/hop-off routes for 29
($46) for a one-day pass or 32 ($51) for a two-day ticket. Use your Paris
Visite card to get the one-day ticket for 22 ($35).
Paris Walks (% 01-48-09-21-40; www.paris-walks.com) is a popular
English-language outfit offering fascinating two-hour guided walks with
such themes as Paris during the Revolution, Hemingway’s Paris, the
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 249

Marais, the Village of Montmartre, Chocolate Tour, the Latin Quarter,
and the Two Islands. Call for tours being offered during your visit and 
for where and when to meet — usually at a Métro station entrance at
10:30 a.m., and again at 2:30 p.m. Tours cost 10 ($16) adults, 8 ($13)
students 24 and under, and 5 ($8) children. They also offer weekend
jaunts to places such as Fontainebleau or Monet’s Gardens at Giverny
or Normandy landing beaches by car.
Or try Paris à Pied (% 800-594-9535 in the U.S.; www.parisapied.com),
which is geared toward first-time visitors to Paris. The three-hour tours
are especially good: The Heart of Old Paris, the Latin Quarter, Montmartre,
and the Marais. Tours cost $59 (guides prefer to be paid in dollars) and are
made up of no more than six people.
Take a fun bike tour with Fat Tire Bike Tours, 24 rue Edgar Faure, 15e
(% 01-56-58-10-54; www.fattirebiketoursparis.com). Friendly
American guides take you on day or night bike tours of the city, with
much irreverent though knowledgeable commentary. The tours last
three to four hours. Day tours are April through October at 11 a.m. and 
3 p.m., and November through March at 11 a.m. (closed Dec 25). Night
tours, which are beautiful (especially the ride past the Grand Pyramid
through the courtyard at the Louvre), take place April through October
nightly at 7 p.m.; March nightly at 6 p.m.; and November and February
15 to February 28 on Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday at 6 p.m.
Reservations are optional for day tours but required for night. The day
tour costs 24 ($38) adults, 22 ($35) students; the night tour runs 28
($45) adults, 26 ($42) students. You can combine both tours for 44
($70) adults, 48 ($77) students. Look for the yellow meeting-point sign
in front of the Pilier Sud (South Pillar) of the Eiffel Tower (PILIER SUD is
spelled out above the ticket booth) for the bike tour. Bike rental is also
available at 2.50 ($4) per hour, 15 ($24) for 24 hours. Cash, check, or
credit card deposit of 250 ($400) per bike is required.
In 2007, Mayor Bertrand Delanoë launched the Vélib bicycle rental pro-
gram, bringing 10,000 bikes into the city, placing them in specially built
bike racks in high-pedestrian destinations, and charging a nominal fee
for their rental (1/$1.60 for the first hour). The program was so suc-
cessful, especially after 1 a.m. when the Métro closes, that 10,000 more
bikes were ordered and more bike racks constructed.
Suggested itineraries
If you’d rather organize your own tour and you have a limited amount of
time to sample the sights of Paris, try these recommendations for hitting
the highlights.
If you have one day
Paris in a day? Better start out as early as possible and wear your most
comfortable shoes: Be at Cathédrale de Notre-Dame when it opens at 
8 a.m. Spend an hour poking around inside and climbing its tower
Part IV: Central Europe 
250

(entrance to the towers is outside on the left side on rue du Cloître-
Notre Dame) before hustling across the river to visit the Musée du
Louvre at a dead trot. You only have time for the top stuff here; pay your
respects to Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo and have lunch in the cafe-
teria. Cross the Seine again to pop into the Musée d’Orsay and spend
two hours or so admiring its horde of Impressionists and other French
greats. As the sun sets over your full day in Paris, head to the Eiffel
Tower to toast the City of Light from its heights. Descend and treat your-
self to a first-class dinner to celebrate your day in one of the world capi-
tals of cuisine.
If you have two days
Plunge right in on the morning of Day 1 with the Musée du Louvre.
Lunch in the food hall, and by midafternoon, trot over to the Eiffel
Tower before sunset to get your requisite picture and drink in the
panorama of Paris. Have a classy dinner in a fine Parisian restaurant, or
dine intimately at a tiny bistro.
Be at Cathédrale de Notre-Dame early (8 a.m.) on Day 2 to beat the
crowds, and then clamber up the cathedral towers after they open to
examine the famed gargoyles up close. Notre-Dame affords a much more
intimate view across Paris than the Eiffel Tower does. When you get back
to ground level, cross the square in front of the cathedral and descend
into the Archaeological Crypt to puzzle out Paris’s earliest origins.
Continue to the far end of the square for the jewel-box chapel of Sainte-
Chapelle, hidden amid the government buildings. Grab some lunch on
your way to the Musée Picasso. Don’t stay too long with the works of this
20th-century master (leave by no later than 2:30 p.m.) because one of
Paris’s biggies lies ahead: the Impressionist treasure-trove of the Musée
d’Orsay. Stay there as long as possible before heading off to dinner.
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as described in the preceding section. Day 3 is
day-trip time. Catch the RER out to Versailles to spend a day exploring
the palace to end all palaces, where a string of kings Louis held court 
in the powdered-wig exuberance of the 17th century. Take at least one
guided tour, and save time to wander the acres of gardens.
Return to Paris by late afternoon so you can take the Métro out to the
original bohemian quarter of Montmartre to watch the sun set from the
steps of Sacré-Coeur. Wander the streets, peek at windmills and vine-
yards, or people-watch and write postcards at a classic Parisian cafe
where you can rustle up some dinner.
Traveling beyond Paris
The day trips from Paris are as impressive as the in-town attractions.
Among the many nearby destinations are two that exhibit the France of
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 251

old in royal and religious splendor — the palaces at Versailles and the
marvelous cathedral at Chartres.
Versailles: Palace of the Sun King
Versailles, with its extravagant 17th-century palace and gardens, is
Paris’s best and easiest day trip. Versailles takes up at least a day and 
in summer is packed by 10 a.m. Go seriously early (the grounds open at
9 a.m.) or wait to go late — after 3:30 p.m. you pay a reduced fare, and
the tour buses have cleared out. In summer especially, this strategy
gives you plenty of time to tour the emptying palace and, because the
grounds are open until sunset, the extensive gardens as well. In fact, you
may want to visit late afternoon on a day when Versailles hosts one of its
evening concerts; for a schedule go to www.chateauversailles.fr and
look for Palace of Versailles shows.
Getting there
You can zip out to Versailles from Paris in half an hour on the RER C line
(you want the C5 heading to Versailles–Rive Gauche station). Versailles
is in zone 4 of the public-transport system, so the Mobilis one-day pass
will run you 9.30 ($15) — covering not just there and back but also
your Métro ride to Rive Gauche. Keep in mind that it’s free if you have a
Eurail pass. From the train station to the palace is a 15-minute stroll, or
you can take a shuttle bus.
Seeing the sights
What started in 1624 as a hunting lodge for Louis XIII was turned by
Louis XIV into a palace of truly monumental proportions and appoint-
ments over his 72-year reign (1643–1715). The Sun King made himself
into an absolute monarch, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the
Caesars, and he created a palace, which is more like a small city that he
believed to be befitting of his stature.
You can wander the State Apartments, Hall of Mirrors (where the
Treaty of Versailles ending World War I was signed), and Royal Chapel
on your own (or with an audio tour), but taking one of the guided tours
is much more informative and gets you into many parts of the palace not
open to the casual visitor. These tours are popular and fill up fast, so
your first order of business should be to head to the tour reservations
office and sign up for one. You may have to wait an hour or more, so
book an even later tour and use the intervening time to explore the mag-
nificent gardens.
Le Nôtre (who designed Greenwich Park in London and the Vatican
Gardens in Rome) laid out the hundreds of acres of palace grounds in
the most exacting 17th-century standards of decorative gardening. The
highlights are the 2⁄3-mile-long Grand Canal, once plied by a small war-
ship and Venetian gondolas; the Grand Trianon, a sort of palace away
from home for when the king wanted a break from the main château; and
the Petit Trianon, a jewel of a mansion done in fine neoclassical style.
Part IV: Central Europe 
252

Nearby is Marie Antoinette’s fairy-tale Hameau, or hamlet, created so
Her Majesty could enjoy a cleaned-up version of peasant life. Here the
queen fished, milked the occasional cow, and watched hired peasants
lightly toil at the everyday tasks she imagined they did in the country —
she even had a little “house in the faux country” built here, sort of a
thatched mansion.
Versailles has complicated hours and admissions. The château (% 01-
30-84-76-18) is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
(until 5:30 p.m. Nov–Mar). Your best bet is to buy the one-day all-access
pass, which allows entry to the palace, Grand and Petit Trianons, gar-
dens, and estate of Marie Antoinette, as well as audio-guide tours of the
palace and gardens for 20 ($32) weekdays and 25 ($40) weekends
March through October (16/$26 weekends Nov–Feb). The park and
gardens are open year-round, from 8 a.m. in summer and 9 a.m. in winter
until sunset. Admission to the park and gardens is free. Admission is free
for all venues for children under 18.
On Sundays in May through October, there is a weekly fountain water
show, called Les Grandes Eaux Musicales, which is accompanied by classi-
cal music and costs 8 ($13) for adults and 6 ($9.60) for students, chil-
dren 17 and under, and people with disabilities. Also in summer, special
nighttime displays of fireworks and illuminated fountains take place, usu-
ally on Sundays for 19 ($30) and 15 ($24). For more information on the
summer spectacles, visit www.chateauversailles-spectacles.fr.
You can buy your tickets online at www.chateauversailles.fr; e-ticket
holders can use a special express line and skip the long wait for tickets.
You can also buy a Forfait Loisirs Chateau de Versailles pass at any
French national rail station (Gare Montparnasse, Gare du Nord, Gare de
l’Est, and so on). The pass provides round-trip transportation by RER
and Métro to Versailles, “queue-skipping” entry to the chateau and the
Grand and Petit Trianons and other attractions, as well as entry to
evening musical spectacles (Les Grands Eaux Musicales). It costs 22
($35) on weekdays, and 26 ($42) on weekends April through November.
Look for TRANSILIEN signs or ask personnel at the information booths in
the train stations to direct you to the correct ticketing agent.
Five to nine guided visits are offered (a few are in French only, and the
tour of the garden’s groves runs only in summer). Standard tours of the
château book early; go directly to the information booth in the South
Minister’s wing of the palace upon your arrival to book a space. If you’re
interested in a more in-depth and themed tour, call % 01-30-83-77-89 or
visit www.chateauversailles.fr to see what’s scheduled. Tours vary
in price.
Chartres Cathedral: A Gothic masterpiece
The French sculptor Rodin dubbed this building “The Acropolis of
France.” Upon laying eyes on this greatest of High Gothic cathedrals,
Napoleon declared, “Chartres is no place for an atheist.” Perhaps the
Chapter 13: Paris and Environs 253

would-be emperor had been moved by the ethereal world of colored
light that fills the cathedral (still the fourth-largest church in the world)
on a sunny day, streaming through an awe-inspiring 2,500 sq. m (27,000
sq. ft.) of 12th- and 13th-century stained glass, turning the church walls
into quasi-mystical portals to heaven. Budget three-quarters of a day for
Chartres, returning to Paris for dinner.
Getting there
You can see all this for around a 26 ($46) round-trip train ticket from
Paris’s Gare Montparnasse, less than an hour’s ride away. The tourism
office (% 02-37-18-26-26) is right on the place de la Cathédral.
Seeing the sights
The first cathedral (% 02-37-21-75-02; www.diocese-chartres.com)
was built in the fourth century atop a Roman temple. Many historians
hold that the site was religious even before the Romans invaded Gaul
(Celtic France), and there’s evidence that Druids worshipped in a sacred
grove here centuries before Christ.
You can spend hours just scrutinizing the charismatic 12th-century
sculptures adorning the main Royal Portal, and their 13th-century
cousins around to the north and south sides of the church as well. The
Royal Portal is part of the west facade, which, along with the base of the
south tower, is the only part of the Romanesque church to survive an
1194 fire.
The cathedral was quickly rebuilt in the 13th century, and the rest
remains an inspiring tribute to High Gothic architecture. Tear your 
eyes from the stained glass inside for at least long enough to admire 
the 16th- to 18th-century choir screen, whose niches are filled with stat-
uettes playing out the Life of the Virgin.
You can take an excellent guided group tour in English for 10 ($16)
Monday through Saturday at noon or 2:45 p.m. (as long as there is no reli-
gious service, including funerals) with Malcolm Miller, who has been
doing this for more than 40 years and has even written a book on the
cathedral. No need to reserve; just meet inside the cathedral at the gift
shop. Miller also gives private tours for groups up to 15 at 10 to 15 per
person. ($16–$24) Call % 02-37-28-15-58, or e-mail millerchartres@
aol.com for more information. The cathedral is open daily from 
8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Climb the tower for gargoyle close-ups Monday through Saturday from
7:30 a.m. to noon and from 2 to 7 p.m., and also on Sunday from 8:30 a.m.
to noon and from 2 to 7 p.m.; admission is 6.20 ($9.90) adults 26 and
over, 4.20 ($6.70) adults 18 to 25, free for children 17 and under. Note that
the stone stairs are steep and winding and the climb isn’t for everyone.
Make time to explore the cobbled medieval streets in the Vieux Quartier
(Old Town) and visit the 16th- to 19th-century paintings in the Musée des
Beaux-Arts de Chartres, 29 Cloître Notre-Dame (% 02-37-90-45-80).

American Express
The full-service office at 11 rue Scribe 
(% 01-47-14-50-00) is open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
(until 7:30 p.m. May–Sept). The bank is also
open Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but
the mail-pickup window is closed.
Area Code
France’s country code is 33. Calling any-
where within the country’s borders requires
dialing a ten-digit phone number (it already
includes the city code) even if you’re calling
another number from within Paris. To call
Paris from the United States, dial 011-33,
and then drop the initial 0 of the French
number and dial just the remaining nine
digits. Some calls beginning with 08, usually
to information lines, cost money.
Currency
The French franc gave way to the euro ()
in 2002. The euro is divided into 100 cents,
and there are coins of .01, .02, .05, .10, .20,
.50, 1, and 2. Paper-note denominations are
5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 euros. The
exchange rate used in this chapter is 1 =
$1.60. Amounts over $10 have been rounded
to the nearest dollar.
Doctors and Dentists
SOS Médecins (% 01-47-07-77-77) recom-
mends physicians. SOS Dentaire (% 01-
43-37-51-00 or 01-42-61-12-00) will locate a
dentist for you. The U.S. Embassy also pro-
vides a list of doctors.
Embassies and Consulates
The embassy of the United States, 2 av.
Gabriel, 8e (% 01-43-12-22-22; france.
usembassy.gov; Métro: Concorde), is
open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. Passports are issued at its consulate
at 2 rue St-Florentin, 1er (% 01-43-12-22-22;
Métro: Concorde), Monday through Friday
from 9 a.m. to noon. The consulate is open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m. and 1 to 3 p.m.; it’s closed on 
all French and U.S. holidays.
Emergency
Dial % 17 for the police (gendarmerie). To
report a fire or if you need an ambulance,
call % 18 (Sapeurs-Pompiers) or % 15 for
SAMU (Service d’Aide Medicale d’Urgence),
a private ambulance company.
Hospitals
Both the American Hospital of Paris, 63 bd.
Victor-Hugo in Neuilly-sur-Seine (% 01-46-
41-25-25), and the Hertford British Hospital,
3 rue Barbes in Levallois-Perret (% 01-46-
39-22-22; Métro: Anatole France), are
staffed by English-speaking physicians.

Where to stay and dine
If you decide to make a night of it, rest your weary head for 98 to 
124 ($157–$198) per double at the Hôtel Châtelet, 6–8 Jehan-de-Beauce
(% 02-37-21-78-00; Fax: 02-37-36-23-01; www.hotelchatelet.com),
within walking distance of the cathedral. Many of the antique-styled
rooms have panoramic views of the cathedral. When hunger strikes,
head to 5 rue au Lait for modern French cuisine at La Vieille Maison, a
celebrated restaurant in a 14th-century building, complete with Louis
XIV furnishings (% 02-37-34-10-67).
Fast Facts: Paris

(www.parisinfo.com), maintains two
full-service welcome centers. Both offer
basic information about attractions in the
city, help with last-minute hotel reserva-
tions, make booking for day trips, and sell
transportation and museum passes — but
for a small fee. The first, in Gare du Nord
(Métro: Gare du Nord), beneath the glass
roof, is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The
second, the Opéra-Grands Magasins
Welcome Center, 11 rue Scribe (Métro:
Opéra or Chaussée d’Antin), is open
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to
6:30 p.m.
Several auxiliary offices, or welcome cen-
ters, are scattered throughout the city. The
office in Gare de Lyon (Métro: Gare de Lyon)
is open Monday through Saturday from 
8 a.m. to 6 p.m. The welcome center in Gare
du Nord is open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
There are two offices in Montmartre — one
at 21 place du Tertre (Métro: Abbesses),
open daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and the
other on the median strip facing 72 bd.
Rochechouart (Métro: Anvers), open daily
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The welcome center in
the Louvre (Métro: Palais Royal or Musée du
Louvre) is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
while the nearby Pyramides office, 25 rue
des Pyramides (Métro: Pyramides), is open
June through October daily from 9 a.m. to 
7 p.m., and November through May daily from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Paris’s convention center,
Paris Expo (Métro: Porte de Versailles), has
an information desk open 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
during trade fairs.
To reserve tickets for shows, exhibitions, or
theme parks, visit www.ticketnet.fr or
call % 08-92-392-100 (0.34/55¢).
Internet Access and Cybercafes
There is no single chain of Internet cafes in
Paris, so the best way to find one is to
wander around the streets in the Latin
Quarter, home to the Sorbonne and other
colleges, which is the best thing to do while
in Paris anyway. Rates start at around
1.50 ($2.40) for the first ten minutes. Most
hotels now have wireless Internet (Wi-Fi) or
free or low-cost computer access in the
salon or lobby area.
Maps
The tourist office map is not bad at all, and
even the Métro maps give you a pretty good
idea of where you’re going in terms of big
monuments in Paris. But, if you want to be
absolutely sure of where you are in the
maze of streets near Place St. Michel or the
Marais, buy a Paris Pratique, a thin, dark-
blue street atlas with big and clear pages
that many Parisians rely on to find their
way. You can find them at any French book-
store after you arrive, or at Monoprix, the
Target-like all-in-one stores you find all
over Paris. Also popular, though its maps
are much smaller, is the red-covered Plan
de Paris.
Newspapers and Magazines
Paris has a terrific events/nightlife/
sightseeing weekly called Pariscope (www.
pariscope.fr), sold at every newsstand
for 0.40 (65¢). A competitor is L’Officiel
des Spectacles, costing a mere 0.35 (55¢).
You may also want to pick up the free
English-language Paris Voice (http://
parisvoice.com), which is widely avail-
able at hotels and English-speaking venues.
Pharmacies
All pharmacies sport green neon crosses,
and one in each neighborhood remains
open all night. Check any pharmacy door
for a list of those open at night, or try the
24-hour Pharmacie Les Champs, 84 av. des
Champs-Elysées, 8e (% 01-45-62-02-41;
Métro: George-V), in the Galerie des
Champs-Elysées shopping center. A Left
Bank option is Pharmacie des Arts, 106 bd.
du Montparnasse, 14e (% 01-43-35-44-88;
Métro: Vavin), which is open until midnight
Part IV: Central Europe 
256

Monday through Saturday; on Sunday, it
closes at 9 p.m.
Police
Dial % 17 for the police.
Post Office
The most convenient post office (www.
laposte.fr) is at the Louvre, 52 rue du
Louvre (% 01-40-28-20-00), open 24 hours.
All other Paris post offices are open Monday
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday
from 9 a.m. to noon.
Safety
Paris is a relatively safe city with little 
violent crime, but there is plenty of petty
theft. Around popular tourist sites, on the
Métro, and in the station corridors lurk 
pickpockets — often children — who aren’t
afraid to gang up on you, distract you by hold-
ing or waving an item near your face, and
then make off with your wallet. It only takes
seconds, so hold onto your wallet or purse
and yell at or push away your attackers —
don’t hold back just because they’re children.
Look out for thieves around the Eiffel Tower,
the Louvre, Notre-Dame, Montmartre, and
other popular tourist sites.
Taxes
In France, a 19.6 percent value-added tax
(VAT) is figured into the price of most items.
Foreign visitors can reclaim a percentage
of the VAT on major purchases of consumer
goods (see Chapter 4).
Taxis
See “Getting Around Paris,” earlier in this
chapter.
Telephone
Public phone booths in Paris seem to be
going the way of the dinosaur since the
advent of cellphones. You may find a coin-
operated phone in a cafe or restaurant, but
most public phone booths are equipped to
take cartes à puces (European credit cards
or other cards with a microchip that are
inserted directly into the phone) or cartes à
code, which have a code you dial before
dialing a number. If you don’t have a cell-
phone with you, the cartes à code will be
the most convenient because you can use
the card on the phone in your hotel. Cartes
à code start at 7.50 ($12) for about an
hour’s worth of phone access. You can buy
them at any tabac. For directory assistance,
dial % 12. To make international calls, dial
% 00 to access international lines.
To charge your call to a calling card or call
collect, dial AT&T at % 0-800-99-0011; MCI
at % 0-800-99-0019; or Sprint at % 0-800-
99-0087. To call the United States direct
from Paris, dial 00 (wait for the dial tone),
and then dial 1 followed by the area code
and number.
Transit Info

chapter, or call % 32-46 (0.34/55¢ per
minute) for information in English, or con-

F
ew cities have such an eclectic mix of sights as Amsterdam, from the
basest of pleasures to the most somber reflections on human cruelty,
taking in sublime art along the way. Spanning from the Renaissance to the
modern period, the Dutch presence and strength in the fine arts is an
obvious tourist draw — how could it be otherwise, with Rembrandt, Frans
Hals, Jan Vermeer, Vincent van Gogh, and Piet Mondrian among the names
on its roster? Visitors also come to shop for diamonds, to drink Dutch
beers such as Heineken and Amstel in brown cafes (so-called because the
best of them are stained brown from years of smoke), or to see the tulip
fields and the windmills.
A tradition of encouraging high art and tolerance while discouraging
prudish morality laws has endowed Amsterdam with some of its greatest
attractions. The cityscape is one of the most beautiful anywhere, with 
its 300-year-old town houses lining well-planned and scrupulously mani-
cured canals. Dutch leniency toward drugs and prostitution has grown
into a huge tourism industry, luring students and other hip, mellow types
to the city’s “smoking coffeehouses,” and visitors of all stripes who giggle
and gawk at the legal brothels in the (in)famous Red-Light District.
To really appreciate Amsterdam, you should plan on spending at least
three days here.
Getting There
Thanks to Amsterdam’s continuing popularity with visitors who are
eager to sample its free-for-all lifestyle, getting to Amsterdam by air or
rail couldn’t be easier.

Arriving by air
Amsterdam’s ultramodern, single-terminal Schiphol Airport (% 0900-
0141 from inside Holland or 31-20-794-0800 from outside; www.schiphol.
nl), 13km (8 miles) southwest of the center city, is served by interna-
tional airlines from across the Atlantic and around Europe and the
world.
The Holland Tourist Information desk in Arrivals Hall 2 is open daily
from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. There you can get help making last-minute accom-
modations reservations. You can also buy train tickets for Amsterdam

Centraal Station. Also in the arrivals hall is a communications point for
Internet and e-mail and a bunch of ATMs.
Regular trains provide a connection from Schiphol Airport to Centraal
Station in about 20 minutes for 3.80 ($6.10). Or ask your hotel if it 
has its own shuttle bus or is on the route served by the Connexxion
Schiphol Hotel Shuttle that can whisk you straight to many hotels and
close to others — for 12 ($19). If convenience is your priority, the easi-
est way to transport yourself and your luggage from the airport to your
hotel is to wait in line for a taxi, for a steep 40 ($64).
Arriving by rail
Trains from Brussels, Paris, Berlin, and other points around Europe
arrive in Amsterdam at Centraal Station, built in the 19th century on an
artificial island in the IJ channel that separates the center city from the
northern district. Stationsplein, the square in front of the station, has a
VVV Amsterdam tourist office (a second office is inside the station) and
a tram and bus terminal. You can take a tram to your hotel, or pick up a
taxi from the taxi stand outside the station.
Load up on transit information and maps, and purchase transit cards at
the GVB Tickets & Info office (see “Getting Around Amsterdam,” later 
in this chapter), right next to the VVV office outside the station.
Orienting Yourself in Amsterdam
Infiltrated by canals, Amsterdam is like Venice. On a map, it looks like
half of a spider web, with the canals as the threads radiating out from
the center in tight, concentric arcs. Here, you’ll find it easier to think in
terms of the canals and six major squares as opposed to addresses,
compass directions, and streets.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Try to remember a few street names, starting with Damrak. Think of
Damrak as the backbone of the Centrum (Center), a neighborhood made
up of a few straight canals and a tangle of medieval streets. Damrak runs
from Centraal Station at its north end straight down to the Dam, the
square in the heart of the city where the first dam was built across the
Amstel River (hence the city’s original name Amstelledamme, later to
become Amsterdam).
Out the other end of the Dam, Damrak changes to Rokin, which curves
down to the square and busy transportation hub of Muntplein. East of
Muntplein, on the Center’s southeast corner, is Waterlooplein, home 
to one of the city’s premier performance venues and a flea market.
Part IV: Central Europe 
260

Next is the Grachtengordel (Canal Belt), wrapped around the Centrum in
a big arc. This zone is a series of three concentric canals — Herengracht,
Keizersgracht, and Prinsengracht — laid out with 17th-century regularity.
The earlier Singel canal can be considered the inner edge of this belt, and
the Singelgracht canal forms an outer boundary to the neighborhood. 
To the south lies Museumplein, where you find the city’s three greatest
art museums (one is currently partially closed for refurbishment and
another has moved its collection out while refurbishment proceeds — in
both cases until 2009), the finest shopping, and some of the best small
hotels.
The Jordaan, a grid of small streets between Prinsengracht and
Singelgracht, at the northwestern end of the Canal Belt, is a blue-collar
neighborhood that has grown fashionable but hasn’t been destroyed by
gentrification; it has a roster of good restaurants. On the other side of
the Canal Belt southwest of Muntplein is Leidseplein, the bustling,
throbbing center of Amsterdam’s liveliest quarter of restaurants (few 
of them A-list), nightclubs, and theaters. Nearby is Pieter Cornelisz
Hooftstraat, known locally as “the P. C. Hooft,” Amsterdam’s most fash-
ionable shopping street, and so small as to give some idea of the posi-
tion fashion holds in the city’s list of priorities.
The watery arc of Singel/Amstel River/Oude Schans canal surrounds 
the oldest part of the Center and runs from Centraal Station south to
Muntplein, with the Dam in the middle. This area is where you find the
Rosse Buurt (Red-Light District).
The most upscale residential district (of interest to upwardly mobile
Amsterdammers but not so much to visitors) is Amsterdam-Zuid
(South). Amsterdam-Oost (East), east of the Center, is a fairly pleasant,
residential working-class and immigrant neighborhood, with attractions
such as Artis Zoo and the Tropical Museum. Across the IJ waterway
from Centraal Station lies Amsterdam-Noord (North), a district that has
been a dull “dormitory” suburb up until now, though there are signs that
this is beginning to change for the better.
Finding information after you arrive
In the Netherlands, tourist offices are indicated by the letters VVV — for
Vereniging voor Vreemdelingenverkeer, if you must know — usually in a
blue-and-white triangle sign. Amsterdam’s main VVV office is just out-
side Centraal Station at Stationsplein 10. There’s also an office in the 
station itself at Platform 2b, and a branch in the heart of town, in a kiosk
facing Stadhouderskade 1. Call for tourist info at % 0900-400-4040 from
inside Holland, which costs 0.40 (65¢) per minute, and 31-20-551-2525

Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 261

Getting Around Amsterdam
The best way to see Amsterdam is to travel on foot, by tram, or on a
bicycle. Amsterdam’s efficient trams (streetcars), buses, and Metro
(subway) trains make getting around the city exceedingly simple. Public
transportation begins around 6am and the regular service ends around
midnight. After that, there are infrequent night buses.
By 2009, all public transportation in the Netherlands should be using an
electronic stored-value card called the OV-chipkaart in place of the old
tickets. There are three main types of OV-chipkaart: personal cards that
can be used only by their pictured owner; anonymous cards that can be
used by anyone; and throwaway cards. The personal and anonymous
cards, both valid for five years, cost 7.50 ($12) and can be loaded and
reloaded with up to 30 ($48). Throwaway cards, which are likely to be
the card of choice for short-term visitors, cost 2.50 ($4) for one ride
and 4.80 ($7.70) for two rides. Reduced-rate cards are available for sen-
iors and children. Electronic readers on Metro and train-station plat-
forms and onboard trams and buses deduct the correct fare; just hold
your card up against the reader at both the start and the end of the ride.
Keep in mind that inspectors, sometimes undercover, may demand to
see your card at any time. If you haven’t paid, you’ll be fined 37 ($59)
on the spot, plus the fare.
Maps showing the city’s transit network are posted at most tram/bus
shelters and all Metro stations. A free transit map is available from 
VVV tourist offices and from the GVB Amsterdam Tickets & Info office
(% 0900-9292; www.gvb.nl) on Stationsplein, in front of Centraal
Station. You can buy transit cards from this office, from sales points and
automats at Metro and train stations, and from some bus and tram driv-
ers and conductors.
By tram, bus, and subway
Ten of Amsterdam’s 16 tram lines begin and end at Centraal Station 
(and one more passes through). The Dam, Muntplein, Leidseplein, and
Museumplein are the other main tram connection points. This is also
true for buses.
The doors on trams and buses don’t open automatically; you have to
press the DEUR OPEN button. On some lines you board at the back of the
tram and deal with the conductor, not the driver; on others you have to
get a card ahead of time. If all else fails, keep in mind that Amsterdam is
a city made for walking.
The city’s four Metro (subway) lines — 50, 51, 53, and 54 — don’t serve
most areas you’ll likely want to visit. But from Centraal Station you can
use Metro trains to reach both Nieuwmarkt and Waterlooplein in the
central zone.
Part IV: Central Europe 
262

By foot
The ring of canals making up the center city are not only easy to get
around on foot, they also make for some of the most lovely walking in 
all of Europe — but watch out for bicycles! Amsterdammers really tear
down those bike lanes, and tourists unused to this system are con-
stantly getting knocked over. Just pretend the bike lane is the same as a
street filled with cars, and look both ways before you cross. The muse-
ums and parks of Museumplein are quite a hike from Damrak; you’ll
probably want to take a tram (or, more scenically, a canal boat) to get
there.
By bike
So you’d rather see Amsterdam as an Amsterdammer would? Why not
rent a pedal-bike and tool around the canals? See “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter for information.
By car
Don’t drive in Amsterdam, for several reasons: The city is a jumble of
one-way streets, narrow bridges, and trams and cyclists darting every
which way. Tough measures are in place to make driving as difficult as
possible. No-parking zones are rigorously enforced and the limited park-
ing spaces are expensive. And if all that’s not bad enough, car break-ins
are common. Outside the city, driving is a different story and you may
want to rent a car to tour.
By taxi
Taxis are easy to find at the stands in front of most major hotels and at
Leidseplein, Rembrandtplein, and Centraal Station. To call for a taxi, dial
% 020-777-7777. Initially, the charge (which includes service) is 3.10
($4.95) and then 1.90 ($3.05) per kilometer (2⁄3 mile).
Staying in Amsterdam
Many of those picturesquely tall, gabled houses lining canals and his-
toric streets have been converted into hotels, but be forewarned: Dutch
staircases give new meaning to the word steep. The older the building,
the more difficult it is for a hotel to get permission to install an elevator
(and the more costly it is to do it), so if stairs present a problem for you,
be sure to ask before booking.
A room with a canal view costs more, but it’s often worth it for the
atmosphere; plus, these rooms are often better outfitted and sometimes
larger than the rooms without views.
All the places that we suggest are located in pleasant, safe neighbor-
hoods. For July and August, you want to make hotel reservations well in

eager to test Amsterdam’s legendary lenient drug policy.
The Amsterdam tourist office (see “Fast Facts: Amsterdam,” at the end of
this chapter) will reserve a room for you for a 15 ($24) fee if you contact
them ahead of time at % 0900-400-4040 or, from outside the Netherlands,
31-20-551-2525 (Fax: 020-201-8850; www.amsterdamreservations.nl;
reservations@atcb.nl). There is no fee if you book online. The office will
also reserve a last-minute room for you on the spot at one of their offices
in the city for a 4 ($6.40) fee, plus a refundable room deposit.
Amsterdam’s top hotels
A 5 percent city tax applies to rooms at all Amsterdam hotels. Some hotels
include this tax in the room rate; others add it to the rate. Be sure to check
this when reserving.
Acro Hotel
$
Near Museumplein
One of Amsterdam’s not-so-secret bargains, the Acro has bright, clean, and
well-kept small rooms close to the city’s major museums and P. C.
Hooftstraat’s shops. With a shower in every room, a full Dutch breakfast
included in the rates, and the hopping Leidseplein restaurant quarter just
across the canal, what more could you ask for?
See map p. 264. Jan Luijkenstraat 44 (near the corner with Honthorststraat). % 020-
662-0526. Fax: 020-675-0811. www.acro-hotel.nl. Tram: 2 or 5 to Hobbemastraat.

Avenue Hotel
$$$
Center
The Avenue has all the bland, standardized charm of any international
chain. But for solid, reliable comfort (if smallish rooms), American-style
amenities at a great price, and a safe location near the rail station, you can
do no better. The full Dutch breakfast adds local color.

few minutes’ walk from Centraal Station). % 020-530-9530. Fax: 020-530-9599. www.

Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken
$$$
Near Museumplein
Nestled in a trio of 19th-century buildings between the city’s top museums
and P. C. Hooftstraat’s shops, this boutique hotel, boasting refined ameni-
ties and personalized service, is a good splurge option. You get the best of
both worlds here: an intimate inn with comfortably furnished bedrooms
(though some are smaller than you might reasonably expect) and compli-
mentary afternoon tea in the lounge — and a pricey hotel with business

Rembrandt Centrum

Canal Belt
In the center of canal land, the Rembrandt Centrum has many canal-side
rooms. Whether you stay in the main 18th-century house or one of the
small 16th-century homes lining the Singel out back, you have a good
chance of getting a canal view. The rooms are more modern than their 
settings: They have a full complement of amenities, almost all are of a gen-
erous size, and the odd wood beam or fireplace is a reminder of the build-
ing’s history.

RHO Hotel
$$
Center
This hotel in a former gold-company building is one of the most conve-
niently located in Amsterdam — on a quiet side street off the Dam. The Art
Nouveau lobby hints at the hotel’s origins as an early-20th-century theater.
Unfortunately, the rooms are thoroughly modern and functional. The hotel
provides all the amenities and is an excellent price for this level of comfort.

Canal Belt
With its antique elegance in two side-by-side buildings dating from 1617
on a posh stretch of canal, this family-run boutique hotel, completely
restyled in 2008 by local interior design guru Wim van de Oudeweetering,
is justifiably considered one of Amsterdam’s “hidden treasures.” The style
varies from room to room, going from understated elegance, via plush
Italianate, to something that comes perilously close to resembling a classy
19th-century bordello — but with a whirlpool bathtub.

Dining in Amsterdam
As the capital of a trading nation and former imperial power in the
Caribbean and Far East, Amsterdam has a good selection of restaurants
serving all sorts of cuisines, from Dutch to Indonesian. Traditional Dutch
cuisine tends to be hearty and rather uninventive, but it’s still good and
filling (and it has been joined by a more inventive, fusion local style).
Traditional specialties include Hutspot (beef rib stew) and pannekoeken,
massive pancakes that can be eaten topped with sugar or fruit as a
dessert or with meats and cheeses as a main course. Consider a Dutch
beer such as Heineken, Grolsch, or Amstel (all light pils brews), or a
Belgian white or dark beer to complement your main dish.
Part IV: Central Europe 
268

If you’re looking for something more exotic, the dish to try is the
Indonesian feast called rijsttafel. This “rice table” smorgasbord consists
of 17 to 30 tiny dishes, offering you a taste of some of the best food the
former Dutch colony has to offer — Amsterdam is famous for its excel-
lent Indonesian restaurants.
Small sandwiches called broodjes are the traditional snack of Amsterdam.
They’re available everywhere, but the best are at the specialty brood-
jeswinkel Eetsalon Van Dobben, at Korte Reguliersdwarsstraat 5–9, off
Rembrandtplein (% 020-624-4200; www.vandobben.com), or Broodje
van Kootje, at Leidseplein 20 (% 020-623-2036). You can buy ultrafresh
picnic supplies at the market on Albert Cuypstraat, at the health-foody
Boerenmarkt Farmers’ Market at Noordermarkt, or in Albert Heijn super-
markets (there’s one at the corner of Leidsestraat and Koningsplein).
Bordewijk

FRENCH
Against a starkly modern setting, the food is richly textured and tastefully
French, with modern accents and Italian and Asian twists. The food is
accompanied by attentive, but not overbearing, service. The constantly
changing menu may include rib roast in a Bordelaise sauce or red mullet
with wild spinach. An outdoor terrace on the square makes dining alfresco
even more attractive.

DUTCH/FRENCH
One of the best deals in the city, this tiny neighborhood place is so popu-
lar for its inexpensive brown cafe–style food that tables fill up fast. In a
17th-century canal-side house, Dutch and French dishes are expertly pre-
pared at remarkably low prices. This is one of your best bets for an oppor-
tunity to mix with the locals. It’s also open late — the kitchen closes at

The name says it all: This canal-side joint does one thing only — 
pannekoeken — and it does it great. One of these disks topped with Cajun
chicken or curried turkey and pineapple may be your dinner. For dessert,
fruit compotes, syrups, and ice cream are typical pancake stuffings. Its
décor is simple and slightly rustic, but in summer join the crowds (and the
syrup-seeking bees) at the long tables outside with a canal view.

Amsterdam’s top sights
Amsterdams Historisch Museum (Amsterdam Historical Museum)
Center
Housed in a 17th-century orphanage building, and with exhibits that cover
700 years of city history, this fascinating museum gives you a better under-
standing of everything you see as you explore Amsterdam. Gallery by
gallery, century by century, you learn how a fishing village became a major
world trading center. The main focus is on the city’s 17th-century Golden
Age, a period when Amsterdam was the richest city in the world, and some
of the most interesting exhibits are of the trades that made it rich. You can
also view many famous paintings by Dutch masters. Next to the museum
is the Schuttersgalerij (Civic Guard Gallery), a narrow chamber bedecked
with 17th-century group portraits of city militiamen; the open hours for
this gallery are the same as for the museum, and admission is free.
See map p. 264. Kalverstraat 92, Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal 357, and Sint-Luciënsteeg

Anne Frankhuis (Anne Frank House)
Canal Belt
As 13-year-old Anne Frank began her diary in July 1942, she dealt with the
usual problems of adolescence, including feelings about her family and the
boy next door. She also included the defining fact of her life: She was
Jewish and had just moved into a hidden apartment with seven other
people, comprising two families and a family friend, as the Nazis occupied
Amsterdam. Anne lived here for two years, with only a crack in the window
and some pictures of movie stars on the wall to remind her of the outside
world.
The Franks and their companions were betrayed eventually, and they all
were deported to concentration camps. Anne went first to Auschwitz, and
then was moved to Bergen-Belsen when the Nazis retreated. She died of
typhus just weeks before the camp was liberated. Of the eight people who
Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 271

lived in the attic, only her father, Otto, survived. His model of the rooms
as they looked in those years of concealment and Anne’s photos on the
walls are all that adorn the small apartment hidden behind a swinging
bookcase. A photograph downstairs details the Holocaust in Amsterdam,
and the bookshop carries copies of Anne’s remarkable diary in dozens of
languages. Half a million people come to pay their respects here every
year, so expect crowds and arrive early, or, in summer, late.

Joods Historisch Museum (Jewish Historical Museum)
Waterlooplein
To dig deeper into the history of Amsterdam’s Jewish population, visit this
vast museum in what was the heart of the Jewish district. It chronicles the
400 years of Jewish history and culture in the city. Ever a tolerant country,
the Netherlands welcomed hundreds of mainly Sephardic Jews fleeing per-
secution in Spain and Portugal in the 15th and 16th centuries. Although at
first restricted to certain trades such as diamond-cutting, by 1796, Jews in
Amsterdam were granted full civil rights (unheard of in that era in Europe),
a position they enjoyed until the Nazi occupation.
Across the street at Mr. Visserplein 3, the Portuguese Synagogue, built in
1665, is the only still-functioning temple to survive from that period.

9 p.m. Thurs); Jan 1 noon to 5 p.m. Closed Rosh Hashanah (2 days, usually in Sept),
Yom Kippur (usually in late Sept or early Oct).
Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder (Our Lord in the Attic)
Center
In the heart of the Red-Light District, this tiny, well-preserved baroque
church spreads across the connected third floors of three 17th-century
homes. Today Amsterdam is famed for its tolerance, but in the 16th and 17th
centuries, the practice of any religion except for the official Calvinist Dutch
Reformed Church was forbidden. To worship, Jews, Mennonites, Lutherans
(for a time), and, in this instance, Catholics, had to go underground — or
aboveground, as the case may be — and hold services in secret. One of the
houses below the church has been restored for visitors — it’s the oldest
house in Amsterdam open to the public.

17, 24, 25, or 26 to Centraal Station. Admission: 7 ($11) adults, 5 ($8) students, 1
($1.60) children 5–18. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sun 1–5 p.m. Closed Jan 1, Apr 30.
Rosse Buurt (Red-Light District)
Dutch pragmatism and tolerance has led to the establishment of the best-
known, safest, and cleanest prostitution zone of any Western city. The
Rosse Buurt’s sheer openness has made the district one of Amsterdam’s
major sightseeing attractions. Amsterdam never presumed to have the
capability to stop the world’s oldest profession, so it decided to regulate
prostitution and confine the licensed brothels to the old city streets sur-
rounding the Oude Kerk (Old Church).
These houses of ill repute display their wares behind plate-glass windows.
The storefronts of some of the prettiest 17th-century homes in Amsterdam
are occupied by women half-naked or wrapped in leather watching TV,
darning socks, reading books, and otherwise occupying themselves until
a customer comes along. At such time, they either close the blinds or aban-
don the window for the privacy of an inner room. Prostitutes pay their
taxes, and the state ensures that they have regular medical checkups and
health coverage.
The district is mostly frequented by five types of people. Three are harm-
less: lots of giggling and gawking tourists, darty-eyed career guys in suits,
and the age-old sailors. Two other types can be scary and tragic: unli-
censed prostitutes strung out on heroin and trolling the streets, and packs
of shifty, seedy men who look as though all they do is indulge in drugs and
brothels.
Come prepared to be provoked or saddened by the sight of scantily clad
women behind glass, who manage to look bored and provocative at the
same time — and be even more careful and aware than usual. Don’t take
any pictures — they don’t want their faces recorded, so you could find
your digital camera being pitched into one of the canals. You’ll be pretty
safe here during the day, but by night either steer clear entirely or stick
only to the main streets if you’re alone (this is doubly good advice if you’re
female) — and leave your valuables at the hotel.
Surprisingly, for all of the flesh trade’s dominance, the district is still inhab-
ited by its share of “real” people who take their kids to school, walk their
dogs, shop at local stores, and eat out in a plethora of international restau-
rants. In recent years, the city government has cut the number of red-light
rooms by a third and is moving to shut down some of the live sex shows.
Boutiques and other small businesses are being encouraged to move in,
with the general aim of “raising the tone” of the neighborhood — and cur-
tailing its links to organized crime and human trafficking.
See map p. 264. The Red-Light District fills the streets around the northern half of the
canals Oudezijds Achterburgwal and Oudezijds Voorburgwal. Tram: 4, 9, 14, 16, 24,
or 25 to the Dam, and then duck behind the NH Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky.

Rijksmuseum
Museumplein
Although it doesn’t get as much publicity as the Louvre or the Uffizi,
Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum is one of the top museums in Europe. Not sur-
prisingly, it houses the largest collection of Dutch masters in the world.
Rembrandt is the star of the show, with a couple of self-portraits, the grue-
some Anatomy Lesson, the racy The Jewish Bride, and his masterpiece,
The Night Watch, which is the defining work for the Golden Age of Dutch
painting.
But note that most of the Rijksmuseum is closed through 2010 for massive
renovations. In the meantime, a “mini-Rijksmuseum” remains open in the
Philips Wing, comprising some 400 masterpieces, while other elements of
the collections have been split up among temporary exhibits all over the
Netherlands (including ten masterpieces, by the likes of Jan Steen and
Rembrandt, at the Rijksmuseum’s Schiphol Airport annex) or lent out to
traveling shows.
Frans Hals is well represented, with The Merry Drinker being one of his best
portraits. You find party scenes courtesy of Jan Steen, Pieter de Hooch’s
intimate interiors, still lifes by Hans Bollongier, and four Vermeer paintings,
including the famed Woman Reading a Letter and The Kitchen Maid.

adults, free for children 18 and under. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 8:30 p.m. Fri).
Closed Jan 1.
Stedelijk Museum CS
Near Centraal Station
For modern art from Impressionism to the present, spend a morning at the
Stedelijk. The permanent collections and regularly staged exhibits high-
light many movements and styles of the past century. Of particular inter-
est are Gerrit Rietveld’s Red Blue Chair and paintings by Mondrian — two
major forces in the Dutch abstract De Stijl movement, which prefaced the
Bauhaus and modernist schools. You also find a large collection by the
Russian Kazimir Malevich, who experimented with supersaturated color in
a style he called Suprematism. Picasso, Chagall, Cézanne, Monet, Calder,
Oldenburg, Warhol, Jasper Johns, and Man Ray are featured artists. The
Stedelijk is currently being housed in a modern business high-rise on the
east end of the same island as Centraal Station, but its real home — closed
for major renovations until sometime in 2009 (or even later) — is a 1895
northern neo-Renaissance structure at Museumplein.

Van Gogh Museum
Near Museumplein
The most famous modern artist of the Netherlands died an underappreci-
ated, tormented genius who sold only one painting in his lifetime — to his
brother. Bouts of depression landed him in an asylum at one point and at
another led him to hack off his own ear after an argument with the painter
Gauguin. Yet even while the artistic establishment was virtually ignoring
him, van Gogh managed to carry the freedom of Impressionism to new
heights, and he created an intensely expressive style all his own.
This monument to the artist offers a chronological progression of his
works, including 200 paintings and 500 drawings, alongside letters and per-
sonal effects (some of which are featured in the paintings on display). A
few of his more famous canvases here include The Potato Eaters, Sunflowers,
The Bedroom at Arles, Gauguin’s Chair, Self Portrait with a Straw Hat, and
The Garden of Daubigny. At the end of the exhibit hangs the powerful Crows
over the Cornfield, one of the last paintings van Gogh completed in 1890
prior to committing suicide at the age of 37.

More cool things to see and do
 Cruising the canals: Amsterdam has 165 canals spanned by more
than 1,280 bridges, so your trip won’t be complete until you take a
canal cruise on a glass-roofed boat with multilingual commentary
(recorded or live). This is the best way to get a feel for the city and
see its gabled houses, humpback bridges, busy harbor, and some
unforgettable sights. These sights include the unlikely Cat Boat, a
temporary home for dozens of furry felines who are supposed to
detest being anywhere near water. Most canal-boat tours depart
from Damrak or near the Rijksmuseum or Muntplein and last an
hour. Tours run every 15 to 30 minutes in summer (9 a.m.–9:30 p.m.),
every 45 minutes in winter (10 a.m.–4 p.m.), and cost around 9
($14) for adults, and 6 ($9.60) for children 4 to 12.
Similar tours are operated by nearly a dozen other companies,
though two of the biggest are Holland International (% 020-625-
3035) and Rederij Lovers (% 020-530-1090). Romantics should try
one of the two-hour night cruises with wine and cheese, cocktails,
tapas, or some other option, or a two- or three-hour dinner cruise.
The snack-type cruises cost around 30 ($48); dinner cruises
around 75 ($120). Reservations are required.
 Tramping to the sex museums: These places are as squeaky clean
as their subject matter allows and are full of giggling tourists. Of
the two, the Sexmuseum Amsterdam, Damrak 18 (% 020-622-
8376), has more of a carnival-like atmosphere, with a section 
of antique porn photographs that border on being of historical
Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 275

interest and a room of everything you either do or don’t want to
know about deviant sexual practices. Admission is 3 ($4.80); the
museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. The Erotisch
(Erotic) Museum, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 54 (% 020-624-7303),
is more clinical and adds some mock-ups of an S&M “playroom”
and a re-created alley from the Red-Light District in the good old
days. Admission is 5 ($8); the museum is open daily from noon 
to midnight.
 Drinking beer in a brown cafe, gin in a proeflokaal: When the
Dutch want to go to the proverbial place where everybody knows
their name, they head to the neighborhood bruine kroeg (brown
cafe — so-called because they’re stained from decades of smoke).
This is the best place to try Dutch beer, where glasses drawn extra
frothy from the tap are beheaded by a knife-wielding bartender. You
can find hundreds of these cafes throughout the city, but here are a
few of the best: Café Chris, Bloemstraat 42 (% 020-624-5942), has
been around since 1642 and plays opera music on Sunday nights;
Gollem, Raamsteeg 4 (% 020-626-6645), has over 200 beers to offer;
Hoppe, Spui 18–20 (% 020-420-4420), is an always-crowded classic
from 1670; touristy Reijnders has some great people-watching on the
Leidseplein at no. 6 (% 020-623-4419); and De Vergulde Gaper,
Prinsengracht 30 (% 020-624-8975), is another good place for
people-watching, with terrace tables and an atmospheric interior.
After you’ve become familiar with the local beer, try the hard liquor
the Dutch made famous. Visit a gin-tasting house, or a proeflokaal,
which looks like a brown cafe but is usually owned by the distillery
itself. It’s customary to take the first sip no-hands, slurping it from
the brim-filled shot glass as you lean over it. Try Brouwerij ’t IJ,
Funenkade 7 (% 020-320-1786 or 020-622-8325), in a now-defunct
windmill near the harbor (good beers from its own brewery, too);
minuscule Café ’t Doktertje, Rozenboomsteeg 4 near Spui (% 020-
626-4427), which has lots of antiques and tasty fruit brandies; or
the 1679 Wijnand Fockink, Pijlsteeg 31 (% 020-639-2695), where
they’ve already heard all the English jokes about their name. They
also display a series of liqueur bottles painted with portraits of all
the city’s mayors since 1591.
 Hanging out with hemp: It really wouldn’t be Amsterdam without
its fascination with intoxicating weeds (see the nearby sidebar,
“Lighting up”). In the Red-Light District, the Hash Marihuana &
Hemp Museum, Oudezijds Achterburgwal 148 (% 020-623-5961;
www.hashmuseum.com; Tram: 4, 9, 14, 16, 24, or 25 to the Dam), will
teach you everything you ever wanted to know, and much you
maybe didn’t, about hash, marijuana, and related products. The
museum does not promote drug use but aims to make you better
informed. In a cannabis garden on the premises, plants at various
stages of development fill the air with a heady, resinous fragrance.
Some exhibits shed light on cannabis’s medicinal use and on
hemp’s past and present uses as a natural fiber. Among several 
artworks is David Teniers the Younger’s painting, Hemp-Smoking
Part IV: Central Europe 
276

Peasants in a Smoke House (1660). Admission is 5.70 ($9.10)
adults, free for children 12 and under (when accompanied by an
adult). The museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. (closed
Jan 1, Apr 30, Dec 25).
 Spending an afternoon in the tropics: In East Amsterdam, the
Tropenmuseum, Linnaeusstraat 2, at Mauritskade (% 020-
568-8200; www.kit.nl/tropenmuseum; Tram: 7, 9, 10, or 14 to
Mauritskade), investigates the indigenous cultures of the country’s
former colonies in India, Indonesia, and the Caribbean. The best
exhibits are set up as typical villages you can wander through.
They’re so realistic that you almost wonder where all the inhabi-
tants went. This place may be a good bet when the kids’ (or your
own) interest in Dutch Old Masters starts flagging and you need a
change of pace. Admission is 7.50 ($12) adults, 6 ($9.60) seniors
and students, and 4 ($6.40) ages 6 to 17. The museum is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 3 p.m. Dec 5, 24, and 31; closed 
Jan 1, Apr 30, May 5, Dec 25).
 Cycling around Amsterdam on two wheels: The Dutch are avid
bicyclists: The country is home to 15 million people . . . and 12 mil-
lion bikes. The streets are divided into lanes for cars, lanes for
pedestrians, and lanes for bikes (each even has its own stoplights).
Renting a bike is one of the best ways to explore Amsterdam away
from the tram routes and major sights (quiet Sun are best). The
only hills are the humps of the bridges over scenic canals. For
rentals, try MacBike, Stationsplein (% 020-620-0985), at Centraal
Station. Prices start at 9.50 ($15) per day and 31 ($50) per week.

Lighting up
We officially can’t condone this, but we also can’t write about Amsterdam without men-
tioning the special class of “coffeehouses” in town, where the drug of choice isn’t caf-
feine. Under pressure from the European Union, the Netherlands is cracking down on
drugs, but the country is still lenient with marijuana. Contrary to popular belief, weed
is illegal here, but police unofficially tolerate possession of a small amount — less than
5 grams — for personal use. These venerable establishments are allowed to sell small
amounts of grass and hash — they even have marijuana menus! They can also sell
joints (rolled with tobacco) and various hash products, coffee, tea, and juice, but no
food. The most famous smoking coffee shop is Bulldog, the main branch of which is at
Leidseplein 17 (% 020-625-6278) in — get this — a former police station, but almost any
other one will have more of a typically Amsterdam, ahem, atmosphere.

(% 020-420-4000). A typical one-hour city tour costs around 16 ($26);
a two-hour tour, around 20 ($32).
Mike’s Bike Tours (% 020-622-7970; www.mikesbiketoursamsterdam.
com) offers half-day tours around the canals in town, and a ride outside
the city to see windmills and a cheese farm and clog factory (touristy,
but fun). The cost is 22 ($35) adults, 19 ($30) students, and 15 ($24)
kids 11 and under; there’s a discount of 5 ($8) if you bring your own
bike. Meet daily at 12:30 p.m. (except May 16–Aug 31, when there are
two tours, at 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m.) near the reflecting pool behind the
Rijksmuseum (Tram: 2, 3, or 5). December through February, you have
to book in advance (minimum three people).
And don’t forget about touring Amsterdam from the canals’ point of view;
see “More cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter. Amsterdam’s
most innovative tour has to be the Canal Bus (% 020-622-2181; www.
canal.nl), a trio of color-coded boats that stop near most of the city’s
museums and attractions, including all those mentioned in this chapter.
The full-day fare — valid until noon the next day — is 18 ($29) adults,
12 ($19) ages 12 and under, and includes discounts on admissions for
some museums. The boats leave every half-hour from Centraal Station.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re pressed for time and prefer to organize your own tour, this sec-
tion offers tips for building your own Amsterdam itinerary.
If you have one day
Start off the day early with a canal cruise at 9 a.m. Get to the
Rijksmuseum “The Masterpieces” when it opens and spend about an
hour enjoying the Rembrandts and Vermeers. Then pop down the block
for another hour in the company of Holland’s towering master mod-
ernist at the Van Gogh Museum. Head to the Pancake Bakery for a
quick canal-side lunch, and then stroll up the street to pay your respects
at the Anne Frankhuis.
Because Amsterdam attracts all types, we leave the late afternoon up to
you: Explore the town by bike, titillate at one of the sex museums, stroll
the canals, or make the rounds of the brown cafes (or the other kind of
cafe). In the early evening, take the requisite shocked spin through the
Red-Light District — before sunset if possible (that is, before the seedy
night elements come out, but while the ladies are putting their best, er,
feet forward for the businessmen who stop by on their way home). Cap
the day off with an Indonesian feast at Kantjil & de Tijger.
If you have two days
Start off Day 1 with the ol’ canal cruise — the best intro to the charming
side of Amsterdam that money can buy. Head to the masterpieces in the
Rijksmuseum next and spend two hours or so perusing the Old Masters.
Part IV: Central Europe 
278

After lunch, pay homage to The Earless One at the nearby Van Gogh
Museum. Head back up to the Centraal Station neighborhood to check
out the modern art Stedelijk Museum CS before wandering back down
to Damrak to spend the early evening visiting the Red-Light District.
Settle in for a thoroughly Dutch dinner at Restaurant d’Vijff Vlieghen.
Begin Day 2 indulging in a favorite Dutch pastime: Rent a bike and tool
around on your own, or take one of Mike’s excellent guided bike tours.
Lunch at the Pancake Bakery before seeing the Anne Frankhuis, and
then head across to the old part of town to see the Oude Kerk and the
church Ons’ Lieve Heer op Solder (Our Lord in the Attic), hidden inside
a canal-side mansion. Spend the early evening hopping between brown
and gin cafes, and then poke around the Leidseplein district for a funky
little Indonesian restaurant (Bojo, at Lange Leidsedwarsstraat 51, is a
decent budget bet) for dinner.
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as outlined in the preceding section, and take
Day 3 to visit the re-created folk village of Zaanse Schans in the morning
and Haarlem in the afternoon, or — especially if you’re in town for the
spring flower season — Haarlem in the morning, followed by a drive,
bike ride, or train trip through the flower-bedecked Bollenstreek. Find
out more about these sights in the next section.
Traveling beyond Amsterdam
Several interesting destinations are an easy day trip from Amsterdam —
among them the tulip region near Haarlem, the traditional museum-
village of Zaanse Schans, and the Vincent van Gogh paintings galore at
the Kröller-Müller Museum in the Hoge Veluwe National Park.
Discovering the other Haarlem
Haarlem makes perhaps the most pleasant day trip from Amsterdam,
offering a much more laid-back and less hectic version of a tidy Dutch
city. Haarlem boasts a great museum, too.
Getting there
Every half-hour or so, a train makes the 20-minute jaunt to Haarlem from
Amsterdam. The local VVV tourist office (% 0900-616-1600 or 31-23-
616-1600 from outside Holland; www.vvvzk.nl) is just outside the sta-
tion at Stationsplein 1.
Seeing the sights
The town’s pretty central square, Grote Markt, is anchored by the late-
Gothic church Sint-Bavokerk, better known as the Grote Kerk. Inside are
artist Frans Hals’s tombstone and a cannonball that embedded in the
wall during the Spanish siege of 1572 to 1573. The church also houses
Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 279

one of the world’s great organs, a 68-stop, 5,068-pipe beauty built by
Christian Müller from 1735 to 1738 — Handel, Liszt, and a ten-year-old
Mozart all came to play it. From about mid-May to late October, you 
can enjoy free, hour-long organ recitals; these are generally Tuesdays 
at 8:15 p.m. and Thursdays at 3 p.m., with occasional specials on other
days. On the church’s south side, 17th-century shops and houses nestle
together like barnacles. These were built so that they could be rented
for additional income to help with the church’s upkeep.
Haarlem’s biggest attraction is the Frans Hals Museum, Groot Heiligeland
62 (% 023-511-5775; www.franshalsmuseum.nl), set up in the home for
retired gentlemen where the painter spent his last days in 1666. Frans
Hals’s works make up the bulk of the collections, but many Dutch
painters from the 16th century to the present are represented as well.
The works are all displayed in 17th-century-style rooms that often bear a
striking resemblance to the settings in the works themselves. Admission
is 7.50 ($12) adults 25 and over, 3.75 ($6) ages 19 to 24. It’s open
Tuesday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon
to 5 p.m. (closed Jan 1, Dec 25).
Where to stay and dine
Hotel Carillon (% 023-531-0591; www.hotelcarillon.com) has clean
80 ($128) doubles in the heart of town at Grote Markt 27. Close by, the
tiny restaurant Dijkers, Warmoestraat 5–7 (% 023-551-1564), serves
hearty lunches such as Thai green curry and lighter fare such as club
and toasted sandwiches.
Stopping to admire the tulips
Believe it or not, tulips aren’t even Dutch! They came to the Netherlands
from Turkey in the 1590s. By 1620, tulips gained popularity and growers
couldn’t keep up with the demand. By the year 1636, rare tulip bulbs
were being sold for their weight in gold. Bulbs have come down in price
since then, but the Netherlands is still one of the world’s largest produc-
ers of flowers.
The Bollenstreek is Amsterdam’s bulb belt, home of the tulip. It’s
located between Haarlem and Leiden and stretches across a 19-mile
strip of land. These lowlands along the North Sea are fields of gladioli,
hyacinths, lilies, narcissuses, daffodils, crocuses, irises, dahlias, and the
mighty tulip for miles as far as the eye can see. January is when the earli-
est blooms burst into color, and the floral show doesn’t slow down until
the end of May. Mid-April, though, is the Time of the Tulip.
Getting there
Haarlem is just a quick 20-minute ride by train from Amsterdam. Buses
run between Haarlem and Leiden to service the region.
Part IV: Central Europe

Seeing the sights
If you’re here between around March 20 and May 20, rush to the
Keukenhof Gardens in Lisse (% 0252-465-555; www.keukenhof.nl), 
to see its 8 million-plus bulbs in full bloom over 32 hectares (80 acres).
These are perhaps the top floral gardens on Earth. Open daily from 
8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., there are cafeterias on-site so you don’t have to miss
any of the surrounding chromatic spectacle. Admission is a steep 14
($22) adults, 13 ($21) seniors, 6 ($9.60) children ages 4 to 11. Take
bus no. 54 from Leiden.
One of the bulb-field region’s chief attractions is just 10km (6 miles)
south of Amsterdam at the Bloemenveiling (Flower Auction) in Aalsmeer
(% 0297-393-939; www.flora.nl). Nineteen million cut flowers daily
(and two million other plants) are auctioned at a speedy pace. As you
watch from the visitors’ gallery, giant dials tick down rapidly from 100 
to 1 — as the numbers count down, the price drops — and the first
bidder to buzz in on that lot stops the clock at that price and gets the
bouquet. Because only one bid gets the goods, it’s like a huge game of
chicken. The auction runs Monday through Friday from 7 to 11 a.m. (try
to show up before 9 a.m. for the best action). Admission is 5 ($8) adults,
3 ($4.80) children ages 6 to 11. Bus no. 172 heads to Aalsmeer from out-
side Amsterdam’s Centraal Station.
Tilting at windmills
Luckily, when the Dutch paved the way for progress, they also set aside
space for preservation. As industrialization of the countryside north of
Amsterdam started during the first half of the 20th century, people real-
ized that a way of life and mode of architecture was rapidly disappear-
ing. In the late 1950s, dozens of local farms, houses, and windmills
dating from that ever-popular 17th century were broken down, carted
off, and reassembled into a kind of archetypal “traditional” village called
Zaanse Schans, where the Dutch 17th century lives on.
Getting there
Zaanse Schans is about 16km (10 miles) northwest of Amsterdam, just
above the town of Zaandam, to which there are numerous daily trains
from Amsterdam (a 12-minute ride). Bus no. 91 departs about hourly
from outside central Station to Zaanse Schans, a 30-minute ride. The
tourist office (% 075-616-8218; www.zaanseschans.nl) is in the ultra-
modern Zaans Museum, at Schansend 7.
Seeing the sights
Although Zaanse Schans is a little bit of a tourist trap, it’s not just a
sightseeing attraction — people actually live in most of the cottages and
houses, doing their daily tasks in as much an early 18th-century way as
possible. The grocery stores and the like are truly from a different era,
and a few of the buildings are museums for the public, including the four
working windmills. Three of the town’s windmills are open to visitors for
Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 281

2.50 ($4) each for adults, and 1.50 ($2.40) children ages 6 to 12, but
they keep widely varying hours — roughly 9 or 10 a.m. to 4 or 5 p.m.,
with shorter hours November through March (go to www.zaansemolen.
nl for details). The little Molenmuseum (Windmill Museum) in the vil-
lage is open Tuesday through Friday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is 3.50 ($5.60) adults, 3 ($4.80) seniors,
free for children 17 and under. Short cruises on the Zaan River are also
popular.
If you’d like to see some more impressive windmills, head 106km (66
miles) south of Amsterdam to the Kinderdijk region below Rotterdam
(% 078-691-5179; www.kinderdijk.org). Nineteen functioning, old-
fashioned windmills built from 1722 to 1761 dot the landscape like 
sailboats, turning their 13m-long (42-ft.) sails slowly in the wind on
Saturdays from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. in July and August. For the rest of the
year, they just sit there looking picturesque. The visitor’s mill is open 
to the public April through September, daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Take the train from Amsterdam’s Centraal Station to Rotterdam, and
then the metro to Zuidplein, and then bus no. 154.
Biking to the Kröller-Müller Museum
One of the Netherlands’s top modern-art museums and Europe’s largest
sculpture garden is the Kröller-Müller Museum, set in the middle of 
the Hoge Veluwe, a 5,500-hectare (13,750-acre) national park of heath,
woods, and sand dunes. This is a great Dutch excursion and can easily
be done as a day trip from Amsterdam.
Getting there
Trains scheduled twice hourly run from Amsterdam to Arnhem in 65
minutes. From Arnhem’s station, hop on bus no. 12, which stops in the
park both at the museum and at the visitor center/cafeteria (% 0318-
591-627), where you can pick up maps of the park.
Before taking that bus in Arnhem, do some advance reconnoitering by
popping into the city’s VVV tourist office (% 0900-112-2344; www.vvv
arnhem.nl) at Stationsplein 45 outside the station to pick up park info
and maps.
Seeing the sights
Biking is the primary form of transportation in the Hoge Veluwe
National Park (% 0900-464-3835; www.hogeveluwe.nl); grab a free
white bike by any entrance or at the visitor center — just drop it off
before you leave. As you bike through the calm, lush greenery of the
park, you may catch glimpses of red deer, foxes, wild boar, or badgers.
Under the visitor center lies the Museonder, a series of displays and tun-
nels dedicated to underground ecology, open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(until 6 p.m. Apr–Oct). The park itself is open daily November through
March 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., April 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., May and August 8 a.m. to 
9 p.m., June and July 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., September 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and

Currency
The currency of the Netherlands is the euro
(), divided into 100 euro cents. There are
coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, and 1
and 2 euros. (Holland does not use the 1-
cent and 2-cent coins, but rounds prices up
or down to the nearest 5 cents.) Paper-note
denominations are 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200,
and 500 euros. The exchange rate used in
this chapter is 1 = $1.60. Amounts over $10
have been rounded to the nearest dollar.
Doctors and Dentists

can reach the giant Academisch Medisch
Chapter 14: Amsterdam and Environs 283
October 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission to the park is 7 ($11) adults, 3.50
($5.60) children ages 6 to 12.
The Kröller-Müller Museum (% 0318-591-241; www.kmm.nl), within the
park, displays paintings from radically different artists and eras, all side-
by-side like wallpaper. The museum displays a rotating selection of its
278 (!) works by van Gogh. Other featured artists include Picasso,
Mondrian, Seurat, Monet, and Braque.
The 11-hectare (27-acre) sculpture garden behind the museum features
work by Rodin, Oldenburg, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Mark di
Suvero, and Lipchitz. Jean Dubuffet’s enormous Jardin d’Emaille is an
interactive artscape of the sculptor’s patented white with black lines,
raised above ground level, so you have to climb a set of stairs. This
enables you to wander around on the art (which should make it interest-
ing for kids). The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; the sculpture garden closes a half-hour earlier. Admission to
the museum is another 7 ($11) adults, 3.50 ($5.60) children ages 6 to
12, on top of the park fee.

Zuidoost. Also see “Doctors,” earlier in this
section.
Information
Amsterdam’s main VVV tourist office is just
outside Centraal Station at Stationsplein 10.
You also find an office in the station itself,
and an agency branch at the Canal
Company kiosk on Stadhouderskade, at
Leidseplein. Call for tourist info on % 0900-
400-4040, or go to the Web site www.
amsterdamtourist.nl. You can find 
an information desk covering all the
Netherlands in Schiphol Plaza at the 
airport.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Many hotels offer Internet access. The Mad
Processor, Kinkerstraat 11–13 (% 020-612-
1818; www.madprocessor.com), is open
daily from noon to 1 or 2 a.m.; access is 2
($3.20) per hour.
Maps
Though the tourist office hands out a
decent enough freebie map, it pays to pick
up a more detailed one from any newsstand
or bookstore.
Newspapers and Magazines
The tourist office publishes a 1.95 ($3.10)
monthly magazine called Amsterdam Day
by Day (in English) covering events and
exhibitions alongside the usual attractions,
museums, shopping, and restaurant info.
Pharmacies
An apotheek is a pharmacy that fills pre-
scriptions; a drogerji sells toiletries. The
most central apotheek is called Dam
Apotheek, Damstraat 2 (% 020-624-4331).
For a list of the local pharmacies whose 
turn it is to stay open at night or on week-
ends, check the door of any apotheek; a
sign will direct you to the nearest late-night
pharmacy.
Police
Call % 112 for the police.
Post Office
The main TNT post office, Singel 250 
(% 076-527-2727), is open Monday through
Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and
Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.
Safety
Although violent crime is rare, the Dutch
tolerance of drugs invites drug-related
crime. Protect yourself against pickpockets
in all tourist areas, on public transportation,
and around Damrak, the Dam, and the 
Red-Light District. The Red-Light District
becomes less than savory after dark, par-
ticularly as the evening wears on and
tourists have returned to their hotels. Avoid
this area at night; we recommend that you
don’t wander the district alone or call atten-
tion to yourself. If you simply must walk
through this area late at night, at least make
sure you’re in a group of people.
Taxes
In Amsterdam, a value-added tax (BTW) is
figured into the price of most items. As a
visitor from outside the European Union,
you can reclaim 13.75 percent of the BTW
on consumer goods, as long as you spend
at least 50 ($80) in a single participating
store in a single day (see Chapter 4).
Taxis
See “Getting Around Amsterdam,” earlier in
this chapter.
Telephone
Almost all pay phones in the Netherlands
accept only phone cards, which are sold at
Part IV: Central Europe 
284

newsstands, post offices, tobacconists, and
train stations — confusingly, different types
of cards are required for the orange-and-
gray phones in train stations than for the
green phones everywhere else. While talk-
ing, watch the digital reading: It tracks your
decreasing deposit, so you know when your
card is out. For directory assistance, call
% 0900-8008.
To charge a call to your calling card, dial
AT&T (% 0800-022-9111), MCI (% 0800-
023-5103), or Sprint (% 0800-022-9119). To
call the United States from the Netherlands
direct, dial 00-1 followed by the area code
and number.
Transit Info
Amsterdam’s public transportation system
is operated by GVB Amsterdam (% 0900-
9292; www.gvb.nl). You can visit the GVB
Tickets & Info office on Stationsplein, in
front of Centraal Station.

M
unich (München, pronounced Mewn-shin, in German), the capital
of Bavaria, is a town that likes to celebrate. Oktoberfest, which
yearly draws some seven million revelers, starts in September and lasts
for 16 days. From January through February, the city goes into party
mode again and celebrates Fasching (Carnival), a whirl of colorful
parades, masked balls, and revelry. Throughout the year, people gather
in the giant beer halls and beer gardens to quaff liters of beer, listen to
the oompah bands, and have a good time.
Oom-pah-pah aside, Munich is also a rich, elegant, sophisticated city,
with an unparalleled array of artistic and cultural treasures. World-class
museums, palaces, concert halls, and theaters are part and parcel of life
in the Bavarian capital. If you believe the polls, Munich is the Germans’
first choice as a desirable place to live. Many Germans — especially the
1.5 million people who live in Munich — think of the city as Germany’s
secret capital. Munich offers so much to visitors that we recommend
you give yourself at least three days here.
Getting There
With one of the most modern airports in the world and one of the largest
train stations in Europe, Munich’s status as a major travel hub means
that you’ll have no trouble finding your way there.
Arriving by air
The ultramodern Flughafen München (Munich Airport; % 089-97-500;
www.munich-airport.com) is 29km (18 miles) northeast of Munich. At
the information desks on levels 3 and 4 of the main concourse, you can
make hotel reservations for Munich and the surrounding area. The desks

are open daily from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. A 24-hour Internet point is in the
airport’s center area, and ATMs are located throughout the airport.
Near Terminal 1 or Terminal 2 you can catch the S8 S-Bahn (light-rail
train), which leaves the Flughafen (airport) stop every ten minutes for
the 45-minute trip to Munich (8.80/$14). The Lufthansa Airport Bus
(% 089-323-040) runs between the airport (the stop is in front of the
Central Area) and Munich’s main train station; the trip takes about 
40 minutes and costs 10 ($16).

Arriving by train
Trains to Munich arrive at the Hauptbahnhof, on Bahnhofplatz near the
city center. It’s one of Europe’s largest train stations, with a hotel, restau-
rants, shopping, and banking facilities. A train information office, on the
mezzanine level, is open daily from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Connected to the rail
station are the city’s extensive S-Bahn light-rail system and the U-Bahn
subway system.
For help or tickets, skip the lines and head to the private EurAide
agency (www.euraide.de), a travel agency staffed by English-speakers
and geared toward helping rail-pass holders by selling tickets and 
supplements and helping you plan rail journeys from Munich (Room 3
next to Track 11). The office is open June through October 3 daily from
7:45 a.m. to noon and 1 to 6 p.m.; in winter, hours vary.
Orienting Yourself in Munich
Munich’s major sights are not confined to its Altstadt, or old center, as
in many European cities. Cultural attractions are spread across town.
Introducing the neighborhoods
The Altstadt is an oval-shaped pedestrian-only district on the west bank
of the Isar River. Munich’s Hauptbahnhof (main train station) lies just
west of the Altstadt. Marienplatz, the Altstadt’s most important square,
is where you find several important churches, the Residenz (former
royal palace), the National Theater, and the Viktualienmarkt, a wonder-
fully lively outdoor market. Between Marienplatz and the National
Theater is the Platzl quarter, famed for its nightlife, restaurants, and the
landmark Hofbräuhaus, the most famous beer hall in the world.
Odeonsplatz, to the north of Marienplatz, is Munich’s most beautiful
square. Running west from Odeonsplatz is Briennerstrasse, a wide shop-
ping avenue that leads to Königsplatz (King’s Square). Flanking this
large square, in an area known as the Museum Quarter, are three neo-
classical buildings constructed by Ludwig I and housing Munich’s antiq-
uities collections. Another triad of world-famous art museums — the
Alte Pinakothek (Old Masters Gallery), the Neue Pinakothek (New
Masters Gallery), and the Pinakothek Moderne Kunst (Gallery of
Modern Art) — also lie in the Museum Quarter, just northeast of
Königsplatz.
Ludwigstrasse connects the Altstadt with Schwabing, a former artists’
quarter located north of the Altstadt and known for its cafes, restau-
rants, and nightlife. Olympiapark, site of the 1972 Olympics, is north-
west of Schwabing. The sprawling park known as the Englischer Garten
is located east of Schwabing. Theresienwiese, site of the annual
Oktoberfest, and Schloss Nymphenburg (Nymphenburg Palace), one of
Germany’s most beautiful palaces, are both located west of the Altstadt.

Finding information after you arrive
The main tourist office, Fremdenverkehrsamt (% 089-2339-6500; www.
muenchen.de), is at the Hauptbahnhof at the south exit opening onto
Bayerstrasse. Open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and
Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., it offers a free map of Munich and a hotel
booking service (% 089-2339-6555). You can also get tourist information
in the town center on Marienplatz inside the Rathaus Monday through
Friday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Getting around Munich
Munich is a large city and the best way to explore is by walking and using
the excellent public transportation system. Subways (U-Bahn), trams
(Strassenbahn), buses, and light-rail lines (S-Bahn) make getting anywhere
in the city easy. In the Altstadt, you can walk to all the attractions — in
fact you have to, because the Altstadt is a car-free zone. For information,
call the public transportation authority, MVV, at % 089-210-330, or visit
them on the Web at www.mvv-muenchen.de.
Buses, trams, S-Bahns, and U-Bahns all use the same tickets, which you
buy at machines marked FAHRKARTEN in S-Bahn/U-Bahn stations; the
machines display instructions in English. You can also buy tickets in the
tram or from a bus driver. Tickets must be validated in the machines
found on platforms and in buses and trams: Stick your ticket into the
machine, which stamps it with the date and time. A validated ticket is
good for two hours. You can transfer as often as you like to any public
transportation as long as you travel in the same direction.
Munich has four concentric fare zones. Most, if not all, of your sightsee-
ing will take place in Zone 1, which includes the city center. A single
ticket (Einzelfahrkarte) in Zone 1 costs 2.20 ($3.50). (If you have a
Eurail pass, you can use it on the S-Bahn.) A day ticket (Tageskarte) for
unlimited trips within the inner zone costs 5 ($8); a three-day ticket
costs 13 ($21).
By U-Bahn and S-Bahn (subway and light rail)
The S-Bahn is a state-run commuter train line that covers a wider area
than the U-Bahn and is often aboveground; the U-Bahn runs mostly under-
ground as a city subway. In the center of Munich, they’re both subways,
providing visitors with an overlapping, interchangeable set of networks.
The major central U-Bahn/S-Bahn hubs are Hauptbahnhof, Karlsplatz,
Marienplatz, Sendlingertor, and Odeonsplatz. The most useful of the 
U-Bahn lines (U3 and U6) run north–south through the city center and 
stop at Sendlingertor, Marienplatz, and Odeonsplatz before going to
Schwabing.
By tram and bus
Trams and buses are great for getting to a few areas within the Altstadt
and for traveling out into greater Munich, but they’re less effective at
Chapter 15: Munich and Bavaria 289

getting you where you want to go in the center of town. Tram no. 19 runs
along Maximilianstrasse and the northern part of the Altstadt before
heading to Hauptbahnhof. Tram no. 18 trundles from Hauptbahnhof
through Sendlinger Top and Isartor right to the Deutsches Museum.
By taxi
With Munich’s efficient public transportation system, you don’t need to
take taxis — and at their steep prices, you probably won’t want to. The
initial charge is 2.70 ($4.30) and then 1.60 ($2.55) for each kilometer
up to 5, 1.40 ($2.25) per kilometer for kilometers 5 through 10, and
1.25 ($2) for each kilometer over 10. You’re charged an extra 0.50
(80¢) per bag for luggage. You can hail a cab on the street if the rooftop
light is illuminated, or you call a taxi to pick you up by dialing % 089-
21-610, 089-19-410, or 089-450-540, but you’ll pay 1 ($1.60) more for the
convenience.
Staying in Munich
Munich has a healthy supply of hotel rooms that serve a large tourist
population, as well as a commercial and industrial trade. Unfortunately,
year-round demand keeps prices high.
Rates in Munich rise when a trade fair is in town, during the summer
tourist season, and during Oktoberfest. You’ll want to book a room well
in advance for the city’s big keg party, or you’ll pay high prices or end
up a long way from the center — or both.
If you arrive in town without a hotel, the tourist office can land a room
for you. Call them at % 089-2339-6555, or see “Finding information after
you arrive,” earlier in this chapter, for locations.

Dining in Munich
Munich is a city that loves to eat, and eat big. Homemade dumplings are
a specialty, as are all kinds of sausages and Leberkäse, a large loaf of
sausage eaten with freshly baked pretzels and mustard. Schweinbraten,
another Bavarian specialty, is a braised loin of pork served with potato
Part IV: Central Europe 
294

dumplings and rich brown gravy. Filling the city are all kinds of fine
restaurants, small cafes and bistros, and beer halls that serve food.
Inexpensive sausages, soups, and snacks are sold from outdoor stalls all
around the Viktualienmarkt, too.
Wurstel (sausages) come in many shapes, sizes, and stuffings. Look for
Bratwurst (finger-sized seasoned pork), Frankfurter (the forerunner of hot
dogs), Blütwurst (blood sausage), Leberwurst (liver), and, Munich’s spe-
cialty, Weisswurst (veal, calf brains, and spleen, spiced to mild delicious-
ness and boiled). The proper way to eat Weisswurst is to cut it in half, 
dip the cut end in mustard, and suck the filling out of the casing in one
fell slurp.
Another word you may see on menus is Knödel, which means “dumpling.”
Knödel may be made of Semmel (bread), Leber (liver), or Kartoffel
(potato). You can usually get these specialties in a beer hall tavern,
where people sit communally at big tables. The outdoor Biergarten is a
wonderful Munich tradition. For more on this, see “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter. If you want a refreshing nonalcoholic
drink, served everywhere, ask for Apfelsaftschorle, apple juice mixed with
sparkling water.
Now about that beer. Munich is one of the world’s beer capitals, and if
you’re a beer drinker, you’ll definitely want to try light beer (light refers
to the color, not the calories). You can get light beer in a giant liter-size
mug called ein Mass. At Oktoberfest tents, if you order ein Bier, you usu-
ally get a half-liter; if you want the giant one, you need to order it by
name.
Munich beer types include: Weissbier (made with wheat); Pils (ale);
Dunklesbier, Bock, or Dopplebock (all dark beers); and the beer-and-
lemonade spritzer called Radlermass. All beers are made under the
strictest quality guidelines and almost never contain preservatives.
Helles means light-colored beer; dunkles is dark beer.

DELICATESSEN/CONTINENTAL
In business for almost 300 years, Alois Dallmayr is the most famous deli-
catessen in Germany, and one of the most elegant. Downstairs you can buy
fine food products; upstairs in the dining rooms you can order a tempting
array of dishes, including herring, sausages, smoked fish, and soups. A

less expensive than the dressier restaurant.

Boettner, with its famous wood-paneled interior and inspired international
cuisine, remains one of the most popular restaurants in town. The food
here has a lighter but still rich touch, mixing seafood and truffles into the
general Franco-Bavarian mélange of ingredients. Fresh asparagus, avail-
able in the spring, is a noteworthy entree. It’ll be difficult, but try to save
room for dessert; your taste buds will thank you.

dive for it). An accordion player makes the atmosphere feel that much
more Bavarian.

attractive presentations. Red wine, not beer, is the beverage of choice in
this upscale eatery.

This place is our choice for best traditional Munich beer-hall grub. You
can’t get any more Bavarian than rustic dark-wood tables and carved
chairs and tin plates full of wurstel. Since 1893, this place has served up
the finger-size sausage specialty of nearby Nürnburg. A platter of assorted
wursts, a pretzel, and a tankard of Augustiner Bollbier or Tucher Weissbier
make the perfect meal.

Exploring Munich
If you’re planning to visit two or three of Munich’s famous art museums,
you’ll save money with a two-day combined ticket, available Monday
through Saturday for 9 ($14) adults, 6 ($9.60) seniors and students.
The ticket gets you into both the Alte and Neue Pinakothek, as well 
as the Pinakothek der Moderne of 20th-century art, Barerstrasse 40 
(% 089-2380-5360; www.pinakothek.de/pinakothek-der-moderne),
which otherwise charges 9.50 ($15) admission. On Sundays, admission
to several of Munich’s top museums is reduced to 1 ($1.60).
Munich’s top sights
Alte Pinakothek (Old Masters Gallery)
Pinakothek means “painting gallery,” and the nearly 800 paintings on dis-
play in this enormous building represent the greatest European artists of
the 14th through the 18th centuries. You’ll find paintings by Italian
Renaissance artists Giotto, Filippo Lippi, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci
(Madonna and Child), Raphael (Holy Family), Titian (Christ with the Crown
of Thorns is one of his most mature works), and Tintoretto. The Dutch and
Germans are well represented here, with Albrecht Dürer’s Self Portrait
(from around 1500) acting as the centerpiece of the collection. Many
artists before Dürer painted themselves into the background or crowds in
large works as a kind of signature, but Dürer was the first to make himself,
the artist, the star of the show. Prior to this portrait, full frontal portrai-

The museum is so immense that you could easily spend several days
exploring. To make the most of your time, pick up a museum guide at the
information desk, decide which paintings you particularly want to see, and
then spend at least two to three hours. A free audio tour in English is avail-
able in the lobby, and free tours highlighting various parts of the vast col-
lection take place on Monday at 3 p.m. and Wednesday at 6:30 p.m.

Bayerisches Nationalmuseum (Bavarian National Museum)
This museum contains three vast floors of sculpture, painting, folk art,
ceramics, furniture, and textiles, as well as clocks and scientific instru-
ments. The objects on view are among Bavaria’s greatest historic and artis-
tic treasures. A major highlight is the Riemenschneider Room, which
contains works in wood by the great sculptor Tilman Riemenschneider
(1460–1531). The museum also contains a famous collection of Christmas
Nativity cribs from Bavaria, Tyrol, and southern Italy. Give yourself at least
an hour just to cover the highlights.

Deutsches Museum (German Museum of Science and Technology)
Located on the Museumsinsel, an island in the Isar River, this is the largest
science and technology museum in the world and one of the most popu-
lar attractions in Germany. Its huge collection of scientific and technolog-
ical treasures includes the first electric locomotive (1879); the first electric
generator, called a dynamo (1866); the first automobile (1886); the first
diesel engine (1897); and the laboratory bench at which the atom was first
split (1938). This hands-on, kid-friendly museum has interactive exhibits
and an English-speaking staff to answer questions and demonstrate glass
blowing, papermaking, and how steam engines, pumps, and historical
musical instruments work.
The Automobile department in the basement is noteworthy, with a col-
lection of luxury Daimler, Opel, and Bugatti vehicles. On display in the
Aeronautics section is a biplane flown by the Wright brothers in 1908, the
first airliner (1919), and an assortment of military aircraft. Spending half a
day here is easy.
The Deutsches Museum is one of the few museums in Munich that is open
on Monday.

Marienplatz
This large pedestrian-only square (see map p. 292) in the heart of the
Altstadt is also the old heart of Munich. Chances are, you’ll return here
again and again, because many of the city’s attractions are clustered in the
vicinity. On the north side of Marienplatz is the Neues Rathaus (New City
Hall), built in 19th-century neo-Gothic style and famous for its Glockenspiel,
the mechanical clock that performs a miniature tournament several times a
day (daily at 11 a.m., noon, and 5 p.m. Mar–Oct). You can take an elevator
to the top of the Rathaus’s tower for a good view of the city center (open
Apr–Oct daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Nov–Mar Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m.); admission
is 4.50 ($7.20) adults, 0.75 ($1.20) children 6 to 18. To the right of the
Neues Rathaus stands the Altes Rathaus (Old City Hall), with its plain, 15th-
century Gothic tower. Inside is the Spielzeugmuseum (% 089-294-001), a
historical toy collection (open daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.); admission is 2.50
($4) adults, 0.50 (80¢) children.

Neue Pinakothek (New Art Museum)
Housed in a postmodern building cross from the Altes Pinakothek, the
Neue Pinakothek showcases 19th-century German and European art, start-
ing right around 1800. Artists whose works are on view include Thomas
Gainsborough, Joshua Reynolds, William Turner, Francesco Goya, Caspar
David Friedrich, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin, among many others.
A tour of the highlights takes a couple of hours; an audio tour in English
is free with your admission.

Residenz Palace
This magnificent building was the official residence of the Wittelsbach
family, the rulers of Bavaria, from 1385 to 1918. Added to and rebuilt over
the centuries, the palace is a compendium of various architectural styles,
including German and Florentine Renaissance, and Palladian. Artisans
painstakingly restored the Rezidenz, which was almost totally destroyed
in World War II. The must-sees are the Residenz Museum, with arts and
furnishings displayed in some 130 rooms; the Schatzkammer (Treasury),
with three centuries’ worth of accumulated treasures, including the
Bavarian crown jewels; and the Altes Residenztheater, a stunning rococo
theater. You enter both the Residenz Museum and the Schatzkammer from
Max-Joseph-Platz on the south side of the palace. On the north side of the
palace is the Italianate Hofgarten (Court Garden), laid out between 1613
and 1617.
Chapter 15: Munich and Bavaria 299

The Residenz is so big that they open separate sets of rooms in the morn-
ing (10 a.m.–2:30 p.m. for Circular Tour I) and the afternoon (12:30–4 p.m.
for Circular Tour II).
Around the corner is the beautiful Cuvilliés Theater, named after its archi-
tect, a former court jester who became one of southern Germany’s most
important architects. Enjoy concerts and opera here in summer; Mozart’s
Idomeneo premiered here in 1781. It’s also called the Residenztheater.

Schloss Nymphenburg
Schloss Nymphenburg, the Wittelsbach family’s summer residence, is one
of the most sophisticated and beautiful palaces in Europe. Begun in 1664,
the palace took more than 150 years to complete. In the first of its four
pavilions you come to the Great Hall, decorated in a vibrant splash of
rococo colors and stuccowork. In the south pavilion, you find Ludwig I’s
famous Gallery of Beauties with paintings by J. Stieler (1827–1850). The
beauties include Lola Montez, the raven-haired dancer whose affair with
Ludwig caused a scandal.
To the south of the palace buildings, in the rectangular block of low struc-
tures that once housed the court stables, is the Marstallmuseum, where
you find a dazzling collection of ornate, gilded coaches and sleighs, includ-
ing those used by Ludwig II. The Porzellansammlung (Porcelain Collection;
entrance across from the Marstallmuseum) contains superb pieces of 18th-
century porcelain.
A canal runs through the 500-acre Schlosspark, stretching all the way to
the far end of the formal, French-style gardens. In the English-style park,
full of quiet meadows and forested paths, you find the Badenburg
Pavilion, with an 18th-century swimming pool; the Pagodenburg, deco-
rated in the Chinese style that was all the rage in the 18th century; and the
Magdalenenklause (Hermitage), meant to be a retreat for prayer and soli-
tude. Prettiest of all the buildings in the park is Amalienburg, built in 1734
as a hunting lodge for Electress Amalia; the interior salons are a riot of
flamboyant colors, swirling stuccowork, and wall paintings. From central
Munich, you can easily reach the palace by tram in about 20 minutes. You
need at least half a day to explore the buildings and grounds.
A factory on the grounds of Schloss Nymphenburg still produces the
famous Nymphenburg porcelain. Porzellan-Manufaktur-Nymphenburg,
Nördliches Schlossrondell 8 (% 089-179-1970), has a sales room and exhi-
bition center open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

More cool things to see and do
 Eating lunch at a Biergarten: Bring your own food, and order mugs
of beer. Biergartens are generally open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. or mid-
night. They usually offer simple sandwiches, and pretzels and other
snacks are always available. Try these Biergartens: the Biergarten
Chinesischer Turm (% 089-383-8730), in the heart of the Englischer
Garten Park beneath a Chinese pagoda; the Augustinerkeller,
Arnulfstrasse 52 (% 089-594-393; www.augustinerkeller.de), sev-
eral long blocks past Hauptbahnhof; and the Hirschgarten (% 089-
172-591; www.hirschgarten.de), in Nymphenburg Park, the world’s
largest beer garden, with room for 8,000 guzzlers.
 Spending an afternoon in the Englischer Garten: Munich’s famous
city park is one of the largest (373 hectares/922 acres) and most
beautiful city parks in Europe. Established in 1789, the Englischer
Garten is also the oldest public park in the world. You can wander
for hours along the tree-shaded walks, streams, and lake, and admire
the view of Munich’s Altstadt from the round, hilltop temple called
the Monopteros, constructed in the 19th century. The banks of the
Eisbach, the stream that runs through the park, are popular nude-
sunbathing spots. A giant beer garden occupies the plaza near the
Chinesischer Turm (Chinese Tower).
Guided tours
Gray Line Tours (% 089-5490-7560; www.grayline.com) offers two

About Oktoberfest
For about three weeks starting in mid-September, tens of thousands of people con-
verge on Munich to partake of the legendary Oktoberfest (www.muenchen.de).
What is it, exactly? Well, sort of a giant keg party with oompah bands, food, and
drunken revelry that’s not always pretty to watch. Some 5 million liters of beer are
reputedly quaffed during Oktoberfest, which started in 1810 as a celebration for Prince
Ludwig’s marriage to Princess Therese. Most of the action centers on the
Theresienwiese park fairgrounds, southwest of Hauptbahnhof, but the whole city has
a distinct party air (just follow the smell of the beer). You must reserve a hotel room
months in advance.

eight languages; departures are every 20 minutes daily until 5 p.m. (until
4 p.m. Nov–Mar).
The longer 21⁄2-hour, 18 ($29) Grand Circle tour offers the same hop-
on/hop-off privileges but goes farther afield to Schloss Nymphenburg
and the Olympic Area, where you can climb its 292.6m (960-ft.) Olympic
Tower. Gray Line also runs half- and full-day guided tours to the castle of
Neuschwanstein.
Munich Walk Tours (% 0171-274-0204; www.munichwalktours.de), con-
ducted in English, are a great way to acquaint yourself with Munich’s his-
tory and architecture. The company offers several options; the meeting
point for all walks is the Neue Rathaus, directly under the Glockenspiel 
on Marienplatz. No need to reserve; you pay the guide (identifiable by a
yellow sign). The 21⁄4-hour City Walk Tour starts daily at 10:45 a.m., with 
an additional walk at 2:45 p.m. daily from May through mid-October and
Friday and Saturday year-round. The cost for each tour is 10 ($16).
Perhaps the most enjoyable way to see town is with the English-speaking
ex-pats at Mike’s Bike Tours (% 089-2554-3988 or 0172-852-0660; www.

mid-April and September through November 10; from mid-April through
August, they depart daily at 11:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. All tours meet 15 min-
utes before setting off, under the tower of the Altes Rathaus on
Marienplatz.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who likes to strike out on your own, this section offers
tips for building your own Munich itinerary.
If you have one day
Start the day off with a tour of the Residenz Palace, the most impressive
downtown palace in Europe. Visit the Old Masters paintings in the Alte
Pinakothek before heading down to Marienplatz around noon to take 
in the clock-tower show and enjoy a late lunch in a beer hall or (if it’s
summer) the Biergarten in the middle of the Viktualienmarkt.
Enjoy the displays in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum after lunch, and
then set off for what everyone really comes to Munich for: drinking enor-
mous tankards of beer. Have dinner downstairs in Nürnberger Bratwurst
Glöckl am Dom — or just nibble on wurstel as you crawl from beer hall
to beer hall.
If you have two days
Spend Day 1 as described in the preceding section. On the morning of
Day 2, head out to Schloss Nymphenburg for more royal splendor. In 
the late afternoon, stroll the Englischer Garten (look for the modern art
Part IV: Central Europe 
302

galleries that ring its southern edge), or investigate the scientific won-
ders of the Deutsches Museum.
If you have three days
Spend Days 1 and 2 as described in the previous sections. On the morn-
ing of Day 3, head out of town, either to the somber concentration-camp
museum at Dachau or, if you get an early start, to see Mad King Ludwig’s
fantastical Neuschwanstein castle. Depending on what time you get
back into town, wind down with one last stein of beer at one of the
Biergartens mentioned earlier in this chapter.
Traveling beyond Munich
The Bavarian Alps is a region of spectacular scenery; any trip from
Munich into the surrounding countryside is bound to be unforgettable.
In addition to the excursions mentioned here, Munich is just two to
three hours away from Innsbruck by train. Innsbruck is covered as an
excursion from Vienna, Austria, in Chapter 16.
Neuschwanstein: Mad King Ludwig’s fairy-tale castle
Ever wonder where Walt Disney got the idea for Cinderella Castle at his
theme parks? He drew direct inspiration — and even consulted some
original blueprints — from Bavaria’s storybook castle, Neuschwanstein.
King Ludwig II — in many ways the epitome of a 19th-century German
Romantic — built or renovated many a castle for himself. But the only
project that would completely satisfy his restless, reckless nature was to
create a castle that looked like something from a story by the Brothers
Grimm.
Neuschwanstein was the result and is still a stunning, dreamlike sight,
perched halfway up a forested mountain near a waterfall. The structure
features slender towers, ramparts, and pointy turrets done in pale gray.
Sadly, the castle was never quite finished, and the king got to live in his
half-completed fantasy for only 170 days before his mysterious death.
(Some say he committed suicide; others say that he was murdered.)
Getting there and buying tickets
From Munich, you can visit Neuschwanstein in a day, but you may find 
it more relaxing to stay overnight in the nearby town of Füssen and trek
to Neuschwanstein from there. As Bavaria’s biggest tourist draw,
Neuschwanstein is packed by 9 a.m., and the crowd doesn’t thin out
until 4 p.m. or so. (In summer, you may have to wait a couple of hours
just to take the 35-minute tour.) You can’t avoid the crowds, but you can
take a late train into Füssen the night before in order to arrive at
Neuschwanstein with the first tourist wave.
Chapter 15: Munich and Bavaria 303

This trip is most easily made by car, but you can also use public trans-
portation from Munich. Take one of the nearly hourly trains to Füssen 
(a two-hour trip), from which hourly buses make the ten-minute trip to
the castle parking lot. A much easier way to get there is by the 101⁄2-hour
Linderhof/Neuschwanstein bus tour offered by Gray Line Tours (% 089-
5490-7560; www.grayline.com), which leaves Munich daily April through
October at 8:30 a.m. and costs 49 ($78) plus admission to the castles
(Linderhof is another of Ludwig’s castles).
When driving into this castle complex (Neuschwanstein and the adja-
cent castle of Hohenschwangau are usually referred to on road signs as
Königsschlösser, or “Royal Palaces”), you have your choice of parking
lots in Schwangau, that little tourist center by the lake. Park in Lot D for
the quickest (but steepest) walk up to Neuschwanstein (20–30 minutes).
Go farther down the road to the big lot on the right if you want to take
the longer (but less steep) paved road up (30–45 minutes). It’s a fairly
strenuous hike either way.
A ticket office (% 0836-930-830) near the parking lot of the castles sells
tickets for both Hohenschwangau and Neuschwanstein. You can see the
castles only on guided tours, which last about 35 minutes each. Tours in
English are available throughout the day. A combined “Kings Ticket”
lets you visit both castles for 17 ($27) adults, 15 ($24) seniors and
students. Individual tickets are 9 ($14) adults, 8 ($13) seniors and 
students, free children 17 and under. You can order tickets online at
www.ticket-center-hohenschwangau.de. Neuschwanstein is open
April through September daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., October through March
daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Hohenschwangau closes a half-hour earlier.
For the easiest route from the ticket office up to Neuschwanstein’s
entrance, take the shuttle bus that leaves from near Hotel Lisl, over-
shoots the castle, and stops at Marienbrücke, a bridge across the gorge
above Neuschwanstein (2/$3.20 uphill, 1/$1.60 downhill, or 3/$4.80
round-trip). This lets you walk (steeply) back downhill in ten minutes to
the castle and gives you a great view of the castle with Alpsee Lake in
the background. Horse-drawn carriages leave from the Müller Hotel
(5/$8 uphill, 2.50/$4 downhill).
Seeing the sights
The tour of Neuschwanstein (www.neuschwanstein.de) shows 
you some of the castle’s most theatrical details, including the king’s 
bedroom — almost every inch covered in intricately carved wood — 
his neo-Byzantine-Romanesque Throne Room, and the huge Singers 
Hall, covered with paintings that refer to the work of composer Richard
Wagner.
Ludwig was enthralled by Wagner’s music; he supposedly convulsed and
writhed in such bliss to the strains of the composer’s operas that his
aides feared he was having an epileptic fit. Ludwig bailed Wagner out of
debt and poured money into whatever project the composer desired.
Part IV: Central Europe 
304

This was the sort of thing that earned Ludwig II the moniker “Mad King
Ludwig,” but the monarch probably wasn’t certifiable. Although beloved
by his subjects as a genial and well-meaning ruler, Ludwig’s withdrawal
into his fantasies caused him to lose touch with his court and the politi-
cal machinations in Munich. In 1886, he was deposed in absentia, and a
few days later his body was found drowned, under suspicious circum-
stances, in a few feet of water at the edge of a lake.
At the bottom of Neuschwanstein’s hill is the tiny village/parking lot of
Schwangau, which serves as a lunch stop for tour-bus crowds. Across
the road and up a short hill is Hohenschwangau (% 08362-930-830;
www.hohenschwangau.de), a sandy-colored castle restored in neo-
Gothic style by Ludwig’s father (Maximilian II). By comparison to
Neuschwanstein, it’s almost ordinary, but tours (usually in German,
unless enough English speakers show up) can prove interesting. Ludwig
made his home in Hohenschwangau for 17 years.
The Nazi concentration camp at Dachau
In 1933, in a little town outside Munich called Dachau, SS leader Heinrich
Himmler set up Nazi Germany’s first concentration camp. Between 1933
and 1945, 206,000 prisoners were officially registered here, and countless
thousands more were interned without record. Spending an hour or two
at Dachau is a sobering experience, to say the least — here you confront
the darkest side of Germany’s history.
Getting there
To get to Dachau from Munich, take a 20-minute ride on the S2 S-Bahn
train from Marienplatz. From Dachau station, bus no. 724 or 726 takes
you to the camp. For information on the town, visit www.dachau.info;
for information on the concentration-camp memorial site, call % 08131-
669-970 or visit www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de. Gray Line Tours
(% 089-5490-7560; www.grayline.com) in Munich leaves from the
Bahnhofplatz at Herties Department Store for a 41⁄2-hour tour of Dachau
(25/$40) from mid-May through mid-October on Saturdays at 1:30 p.m.
Seeing the sights
The taunting Nazi slogan Arbeit Macht Frei (Work Brings Freedom) is
inscribed on the gate where you enter. Allied troops razed the 32 prison-
ers’ barracks to the ground when they liberated the camp in 1945, but
two have been reconstructed to illustrate the squalid living conditions.
Each barrack was built to house 208 people; by 1936, they accommo-
dated up to 1,600 each.
In 2002, parts of the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial were
redesigned to focus on the fate of the prisoners and to integrate the 
still-existing historic buildings into the reworked permanent exhibition.
Visitors now follow the route of the prisoners, enter rooms in which citi-
zens were stripped of all their belongings and rights, and where, after
disinfecting, they were given a striped prison uniform. Inscribed boards

The former kitchen is now a museum with photographs documenting
the rise of the Nazis and the persecution of Jews, communists, Gypsies,
homosexuals, and others. You can watch a short documentary film (the
English version usually shows at 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.).
The ovens of the crematorium and a gas chamber disguised as showers
are at the back of the camp. No prisoners were gassed at Dachau (though
more than 3,000 Dachau inmates were sent to an Austrian camp to be
gassed); this room was used for beatings and cruel interrogations.
Although Dachau, unlike other camps such as Auschwitz in Poland, was
primarily for political prisoners and not expressly a death camp, more
than 32,000 people died here, and thousands more were executed. The
camp is scattered with Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant memorials.
The camp is open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admis-
sion is free; 21⁄2-hour guided tours (3/$4.80) are conducted in English at

more than 450 terminals across from the
main train station at Bahnhofplatz 1. It’s
open daily from 6 a.m. to 1.a.m.
Maps
The center of Munich is pretty small, so the
map the tourist office gives out should serve
you just fine.
Newspapers and Magazines
The tourist office hands out a monthly
events calendar called Monatsprogramm.
You may also want to pick up the ex-pat
magazine Munich Found (www.munich
found.de) — full of events, news, 
and articles of interest to foreigners in
Munich — on newsstands.
Pharmacies
Apotheke (pharmacies) in Munich rotate
the duty of staying open nights and week-
ends. For the location of the nearest 24-
hour pharmacy, check the sign in the
window of any pharmacy. The International
Ludwigs-Apotheke, Neuhauser Strasse 11
(% 089-1894-0300), is open Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Police
Call the police at % 110.
Post Office
A large post office is at Bahnhofplatz 1 
(% 089-599-0870; www.deutschepost.
de), across from the train station, and is
open Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to
8 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., and
Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Safety
You probably don’t have to worry about vio-
lent crime, but you should be alert to possi-
ble pickpockets or purse-snatchers in
popular areas such as the Marienplatz 
and around the Hauptbahnhof, especially 
at night.
Taxes
In Germany, a 16 percent value-added tax
(VAT) is figured into the price of most items.
Foreign visitors can reclaim a percentage
of the VAT on purchases of 25 ($40) or
more in a single store (see Chapter 4).
Taxis
See “Getting Around Munich,” earlier in
this chapter.
Telephone
Pay phones in Munich take phone cards,
which are available in various denomina-
tions from newsstands. To charge your call
Chapter 15: Munich and Bavaria 307

to a calling card, you can call AT&T 
(% 0800-225-5288), MCI (% 0800-888-

Vienna and the 
Best of Austria

M
ore than any other European city, Vienna maintains a link with 
the past. In attitude, architecture, and interior décor, Vienna still
reverberates with the stately elegance of the Hapsburg Dynasty, which
ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the 18th and 19th centuries. The
city on the Danube is pure refinement: Its imperial palaces and art muse-
ums delight, its rococo churches and ornate beer taverns excite, and its
nostalgic cafes and awe-inspiring concert halls thrill.
Vienna lays claim to one of Europe’s richest and most varied musical
heritages. The birthplace of the waltz, it’s home to the likes of Mozart,
Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, the Strauss family, Brahms, Mahler, and
the Vienna Boys’ Choir. Plan for at least two or three days in Vienna —
or slightly longer to take in all the sights and give yourself time just to
walk, sample delectable pastries, and people-watch in a fantastic capital
that stands at the crossroads of Europe.
Getting to Vienna
Vienna lies a brief five-hour train ride from both Munich and Prague,
making the city a convenient destination to reach by air or rail. Once
here, you’ll find that most attractions are concentrated in a small part of
the city center.
Arriving by air
Wien Schwechat airport (% 01-70-070; www.viennaairport.com) is
19km (12 miles) southeast of the city. If you’re traveling with your own

laptop, you’ll be able to take advantage of several wireless hot spots
throughout the airport. The information desk is located in the arrivals
hall, where there are also two ATMs.
The City Airport Train (% 01-25-250; www.cityairporttrain.com)
connects the terminal with Wien Mitte train station in just 16 minutes for
8 ($13). Buses (% 01-930-000) cost 6 ($9.60), leave every 20 minutes,
and stop in the center at Südtiroler Platz (20 minutes), Südbahnhof (25
minutes), and Westbahnhof (35 minutes). The S7 S-Bahn service is the
cheapest (3/$4.80) but also the slowest (35 minutes or more). It leaves
every 30 minutes for stops at Wien Mitte and Wien Nord.
Arriving by rail
By train, you arrive in Vienna at Westbahnhof from northern Europe or
Südbahnhof from southern Europe (central Europe arrivals are split
between the two). Trains from Prague and Berlin occasionally arrive at
the northerly Franz-Josef Bahnhof, and if you’re coming from Prague or
Part IV: Central Europe 

the airport, you may disembark at Wien Mitte/Landstrasse on the east-
ern edge of the city.
The U-Bahn (subway) and tram system runs between these stations and
the center of town — except Südbahnhof, from which you can catch the
D tram to the center. (Look for the tram in a terminal on the station’s
east side, not right out in front near the other tram stop.)
Orienting Yourself in Vienna
Vienna’s inner city is the oldest part of town and home to the most spec-
tacular sights and almost all the hotels and restaurants recommended in
this chapter.
When you’re trying to figure out a Viennese address, remember that 
the building number comes after the street name. A number before the
name, especially a Roman numeral, indicates the bezirk (city district) in
which the address resides. (The inner city is “I bezirk.”)
Introducing the neighborhoods
The Ringstrasse, or Ring Road, encircles the inner city with an elegant,
tree-lined thoroughfare. This boulevard follows the outline of the
medieval city walls of yesteryear. The road is studded with many of
Vienna’s most prized gems: churches, palaces, and museums. Although
the Ring is a continuous stretch of road, its name changes often. Just
remember this: Any road whose name ends in -ring (such as Opern Ring
or Kärntner Ring) is part of this avenue.
Forming the northeast border of the old city is the Danube Canal (the
actual famed river, which isn’t really blue, is farther northeast). The
northward-running shopping boulevard Kärntnerstrasse begins where
Kärntner Ring becomes Opern Ring at the Staatsoper opera house. This
avenue bisects the inner city to Stephansplatz, the epicenter of town
and home of St. Stephan’s Cathedral.
The only place you’re likely to venture outside of Vienna’s Ring is the
refined neighborhood of Karlsplatz (just southeast of the Staatsoper),
with its namesake church, history museum, and major U-Bahn (subway)
junction. You may also head west of the Ring a bit to the Naschmarkt, a
fresh produce market, and maybe a touch farther beyond that to
Mariahilferstrasse, the wide shopping street that runs from the Opern
Ring to Westbahnhof train station.
Finding information after you arrive
Vienna’s tourist office is an excellent resource. You’ll find it behind the
Staatsoper, at Kärntnerstrasse 38 (% 01-24-555; www.wien.info).
Hours are daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Chapter 16: Vienna and the Best of Austria 311

Getting Around Vienna
You use the same ticket for all Viennese public transportation. Tickets
are available at Tabak-Trafiks (tobacco/newsstands), automated
machines at major stops and U-Bahn stations, and on trams (though
they cost 0.50/80¢ more onboard). A single (one-ride) ticket costs
1.70 ($2.70), which is also the price of two rides for a child. Kids five
and under ride free. A one-day pass for 5.70 ($9.10) and a three-day
pass for 14 ($22) are also available.
A potential cost-saving option, if you’re going to be doing lots of sight-
seeing, is the 19 ($30), 72-hour Vienna Card (see the introduction to
“Exploring Vienna,” later in this chapter, for details).
By U-Bahn (subway)
Although inner-city Vienna is ideal for hoofing it, you need public trans-
portation for some of the longer hauls. To get where you want to go 
as quickly as possible, the U-Bahn (subway) is your best bet. The U3
heads from Westbahnhof station through the center of town, stops at
Stephansplatz, and then proceeds on to Wien Mitte/Landstrasse station.
The U1 cuts north to south through the center of town, stopping at
Karlsplatz, Stephansplatz, Swedenplatz (near the Danube Canal), and
Praterstern/Wien Nord (at the Prater city park). The U2 curves around
the Ring’s west side to Karlsplatz, where it ends, and the U4 continues
circling around the Ring’s eastern half before heading north to the
Friedensbrücke stop (the closest to Franz-Josef Bahnhof).
By tram or bus
For a more scenic way to get about town, try the tram. Lines include 18
(Südbahnhof to Westbahnhof), D (hedging around much of the Ring
before veering off to Südbahnhof), and 1 and 2 (circling along the Ring —
1 goes clockwise, 2 goes counterclockwise).
You can also take buses that crisscross the center of town (1A, 2A, and
3A) or head out to the ’burbs.
By taxi
Although you can see most of the major sites in Vienna on foot, you may
prefer the comforts of a taxi for trips from the airport or train station to
your hotel. Be aware that taxis won’t cruise the streets of Vienna looking
for you. Instead, you need to hire taxis at stands located throughout the
city, or call % 31-300, 60-160, 81-400, or 40-100 (a 2.50/$4 charge is
added onto your fare when you call a cab).
The basic fare for one passenger is 2.50 ($4), plus 1.09 ($1.75) per
kilometer for the first 4km, and then .90 ($1.45) for each kilometer after
that. You pay a 1 ($1.60) surcharge for luggage and a 0.10 (15¢) sur-
charge between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. and on Sundays and holidays (and
Part IV: Central Europe 
312

the per-kilometer rate goes up to 1.31/$2.10). Each additional passenger
costs 1 ($1.60) more. Rides to the airport (% 676-380-5797) also cost
extra, or you can get a taxi for a flat rate, around 35 to 45 ($56–$72).
Staying in Vienna
If you’re on a shoestring budget, you can find a concentration of cheap,
plain hotels around Westbahnhof, a short tram ride from the center of
town. This area is usually safe at night, except as you near Karlsplatz, a
pretty plaza that junkies claim after dark. Vienna’s popularity booms in
late spring and late summer, and rooms can get scarce, so reserve ahead.
The tourist office (see “Finding information after you arrive,” earlier in
this chapter) can help you find lodging in a hotel or private home.
Vienna’s top hotels
Hotel Astoria
$$$$
Near the Staatsoper
Recapturing the twilight days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, this classic
hotel has a frayed but cared-for elegance. Its location is prime for shop-
ping and visiting the opera house and the cathedral. Avoid the dark and
cramped interior rooms, and try your luck at getting one of the front rooms
(outside, Kärntnerstrasse is pedestrian-only, so you won’t be disturbed
much at night). Although hard to snag, the large, light-filled “superior”
corner rooms, featuring lovely marble fireplaces, stucco wall decorations,
and 19th-century furnishings, are definitely worth asking about (however,
as the staff laments, “we have only so many corners”). Check the hotel’s
Web site for the cheapest rates and special packages; lower rates are avail-
able for stays of two nights or more.
See map p. 314. Kärntnerstrasse 32–34 (entrance actually on side road Führichgasse,

Hotel Kärntnerhof
$$
North of Stephansdom
Take just a few minutes’ walk north of the cathedral to find this comfort-
able hotel, modest but not spare, with pricing right for most budgets. The
near-modern accommodations are a bit worn and frayed at the edges (an
overhaul of some of the older bathrooms would be welcome), but the facil-
ities are sparkling clean. If you’re traveling with a group or family, ask
about the three roomier apartments, each of which has two bedrooms
joined by a short hall.

Hotel Mercure Secession Wien
$$
Just southeast of the Ringstrasse
A favorite of entertainers, this modern hotel is redone with contemporary
modular furnishings every few years. Art lovers appreciate the location
behind the Academy of Fine Arts and near the Kunsthistoriches Museum.
The Mercure’s comfortable apartments, which feature small kitchenettes
(a nearby produce market can help you take care of the details), are suit-
able for families and groups. The main street is noisy, so light sleepers
should request a room in the rear. Only a few rooms have air-conditioning,
so be sure to ask for it.

($22). AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Royal
$$$$
Near Stephansdom
At the intersection of two prestigious streets on a corner of the cathedral
square, this hotel offers good value at a great location. Don’t miss the
piano in the antiques-filled lobby — it was once owned by Wagner. You
don’t stay at the Royal for history, however; this place was built in 1960.
For the best accommodations, choose one of the corner rooms, which
have spacious foyers and balconies overlooking the Stephansdom.

rates: 150–255 ($240–$408) double. Rates include breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Wandl
$$$$
Near Stephansdom
Halfway between the cathedral and the Hofburg, this inn has been run by
the same family for generations. Pleasant, good-size rooms feature func-
tional furniture. Only one doesn’t have a private bathroom, which means
that you can save big-time if you choose that one, and you don’t even have
to share the bathroom down the hall — it’s yours alone. Be sure to ask for
a room with a view of St. Stephan’s steeple.

Pension Altstadt Vienna
$$$
Near Kärntnerstrasse
This is an undiscovered gem for those who like their hotels small and
charming. The premises were converted from a century-old private home
in the mid-1990s by noted connoisseur of modern art, Otto Wiesenthal.
The comfortable, cozy rooms are reminiscent of a stately English home.

Dining in Vienna
Viennese cooking is varied and palate-pleasing — with German, Swiss, and
Italian influences, as well as more eastern-tinged Turkish, Hungarian, and
Balkan flavors. Far and away, Vienna is most famous for being the birth-
place of Wiener schnitzel, a simple, flat cutlet of pork or veal, breaded and
fried (traditionally in lard), which is then tucked into a roll as a sandwich
or served on a plate that can barely contain it.
Tafelspitz is another delicious (and dyed-in-the-wool) Viennese dinner-
time meal. This boiled beef dish, served with applesauce topped with
horseradish shavings, has been popular for centuries — in fact, Emperor
Franz Joseph was noted for eating it daily. From Hungary (the other half
of the Austro-Hungarian Empire), the Viennese pantry has several spicy
influences; look for paprika popping up in a variety of dishes, especially
in the flavorful pork or beef stew called goulash.
The Ottoman Turks besieged Vienna frequently throughout the 16th and
17th centuries and in the process introduced the city to a beverage that
would eventually become one of Vienna’s passions — kaffee (coffee).
(For a preview of the best Viennese cafes, head to the section “More
cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter.) And of course, mouth-
watering pastries are a necessity with any cup of kaffee. Vienna’s world-
renowned baked goods include strudel, which comes with numerous
tempting fillings (apfelstrudel with apple is still the reigning pastry king).
Other irresistible choices include gugelhupf (cream-filled horns) and
rehrucken (chocolate cake encrusted with almonds).
Ready to overload on chocolate? Set your sights on sampling some
Sachertorte, the original chocolate lover’s delight (made unique by 
a touch of apricot jam). The Hotel Sacher, Philharmonikerstrasse 4 
(% 01-514-560; www.sacher.com), was the birthplace of this tempting
creation in 1832, but found itself engaged in a long legal battle with Café
Demel, Kohlmarkt 14 (% 01-535-17170; www.demel.at), during the
1960s over the right to call its dessert delight the “Original Sachertorte.”
Although the Hotel Sacher won, your taste buds will be hard-pressed to
tell the difference, so sample the sweets at both.
Top Austrian beers include lighter fare such as Gold Fassl, Kaiser, and
Weizengold (a wheat beer). Or, if you prefer richer brews, try Gösser
Spezial and Eggenberger Urbock (the latter dates back to the 17th cen-
tury and is one of the world’s most powerful beers).
Part IV: Central Europe 
318

When it comes to enjoying the best of Austria’s wines, you’ll find that
whites dominate. Although the pinnacle white is the fruity Grüner
Veltiner, the country’s dry Rieslings are also celebrated, along with sev-
eral fine chardonnays and Pinot Blancs. Also, keep your palate open to
sample some Eiswein, a special Austrian dessert wine made from grapes
that are allowed to ripen on the vine until after the first frost hits. This
unusual growing process freezes water in the grapes and concentrates
the fruit’s alcohol level and taste. And don’t forget about schnapps,
delightfully flavored liqueurs distilled from various fruits.

Österreicher im MAK Gasthof & Bar
$$
Near Bahnhof Wien-Mitte
VIENNESE
This deeply respected culinary destination occupies a pair of rooms on
the street level of the Museum der Angewanten Kunst (MAK). One is an
enormous and echoing room capped with one of the most elaborate cof-
fered and frescoed ceilings in town; the other is a smaller, postmodern,
glass-sided room with a ceiling that rolls back during clement weather for
a view of the sky. There’s also a garden terrace. Since 2006, the culinary
inspiration behind all this is Helmut Österreicher, a chef who has helped
to redefine the tenets of modern Viennese cuisine — a lighter reinterpre-
tation of what dining with the Habsburgs really meant. The menu is divided
into two categories, one featuring “classical” and the other “modern”
Viennese cuisine.

Exploring Vienna
If you’re going to be in town for few days, pick up the Vienna Card,
which gives you three days of unlimited public transportation plus dis-
counts at 30 city sights and museums (as well as on a load of restau-
rants, shops, bars, nightlife venues, tours, and other attractions). The
card costs 19 ($30) and is available at the tourist office, hotel desks, 
or U-Bahn stations.
Because several museums fall under the purview of the Kunsthistoriches
Museum, you can get several combination tickets. The 23 ($37) Bronze-
ticket covers the main Kunsthistoriches Museum and the Schatzkammer
and Neue Burg at the Hofburg (all reviewed in this section). The 26 ($42)
Silberticket takes in those plus the Austrian Theater Museum. The 28 ($45)
Goldticket covers all that, plus the Lipizzaner Museum and Wagenburg.

Hofburg Palace
A wonder of connective architecture, the palace of Hofburg (actually 
the Hapsburgs’ winter home) is a jumbled complex that was added on to
from 1279 to 1913. It spreads out over several blocks and features numer-
ous entrances, but the main entrance on Michaelerplatz ushers you into
the majestic courtyard that leads to the Imperial Apartments, or
Kaiserappartments (% 01-533-7570; www.hofburg-wien.at). Here you’ll
also find the Imperial Silver and Porcelain Collection containing 18th- and
19th-century Hapsburg table settings, and the Sissi Museum dedicated to the
beloved 19th-century empress Elisabeth.
The Schatzkammer (Imperial Treasury) is another choice attraction at the
Hofburg (% 01-533-7931; www.khm.at). Head left from the In der Burg
courtyard and enter through the Swiss Court. The treasury, Europe’s great-
est, houses a collection of historic gems and jewelry likely to impress even
the most jaded of tourists.
The Neue Burg (New Castle) is yet another section of the palatial estate
worth visiting (% 01-525-240; www.khm.at). Constructed in the early 20th
century, the building’s elegantly curving exterior houses several collec-
tions. Collections include (in descending order of interest): historical musi-
cal instruments (many used by famous composers; try the audio tour even
though it’s in German — it features wonderful snippets of period music);
arms and armor; and classical statues (mainly from the Greco-Turkish site
of Ephesus). An entrance next door (closer to the Ringstrasse) leads 
to the Museum für Völkerkunde (Museum of Ethnology), featuring the
only intact Aztec feather headdresses in the world (% 01-525-240; www.
ethno-museum.ac.at). At press time, this museum was closed for 
renovation.
See map p. 314. The palace takes up many square city blocks, but the main entrance
is on Michaelerplatz. Each section has its own phone number and Web site, which
are listed in the preceding description. U-Bahn: Herrengasse or Stephansplatz (walk

Kunsthistoriches Museum (Museum of Fine Arts)
An amazingly diverse art collection awaits you in this 100-room museum.
Start with ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman art, work your way through
the Renaissance, and then move on to the Flemish, Dutch, and German
masters such as Memling, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, and especially Breughel
the Elder (the majority of his known works are here).
Masterpieces include Dürer’s Blue Madonna, Vermeer’s The Artist’s Studio,
and works by Italian masters Titian, Raphael, Veronese, Caravaggio, and
Giorgione. Top ancient works consist of a Roman onyx cameo of the
Part IV: Central Europe 
322

Gemma Augustea, and a roly-poly blue hippopotamus from 2000 B.C. Egypt
(which also serves as the museum’s mascot). Also check out Archimboldo’s
idiosyncratic and allegorical still lifes–cum-portraits, in which the artist
cobbles together everyday objects to look like a face from afar. Craggy,
wooden-faced Winter is really Francis I of France, and flame-haired Fire may
be Emperor Maximillian II himself.

MuseumsQuartier
Installed in former Hapsburg stables, MuseumsQuartier is one of the largest
cultural complexes in the world. It’s like combining the Guggenheim
Museum in New York with that city’s Museum of Modern Art. Toss in the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, a children’s museum, an architecture and
design center, lots of theaters and art galleries, along with video 
workshops — and much more — and you’ve got it. There’s even a tobacco
museum.
Our favorite attraction here is the Leopold Museum (% 01-525-700; www.
leopoldmuseum.org) with its brilliant collection of Austrian art. We’d visit
it for no other reason than it contains the world’s largest treasure-trove of
the works of Egon Schiele (1890–1918), ranked by some critics right up
there with van Gogh and Modigliani. Schiele died at the age of 27, but
Leopold has more than 2,500 drawings and watercolors along with 330 oil
canvases. There’s so much more, including works by Gustav Klimt.
Of almost equal importance is the Kunsthalle Wien (% 01-521-8933; www.
kunsthallewien.at), a showcase for both classic modern art and con-
temporary cutting-edge paintings. Every artist from Picasso to Andy
Warhol is represented here — yes, even Ms. Yoko Ono, not the world’s
greatest painter, although she married well. From Expressionism to cubism
to abstraction, the art is magnificently spread across five floors.
A final attraction, Museum of Modern Art Ludwig Foundation (MUMOK;
% 01-525-000; www.mumok.at) presents one of the most outstanding col-
lections of modern art in central Europe, even American pop. The museum
features five exhibition levels (two of which are underground). From
cubism to surrealism, major art movements are grouped together. The
fabled names of the 20th century, including Jasper Johns and Roy
Lichtenstein, are on ample display.

Schloss Schönbrunn (Schönbrunn Palace)
You have to travel about 4 miles from Vienna’s center to experience this
palace — but it’s definitely worth the effort. Schloss Schönbrunn was the
baroque playground of Empress Maria Theresa and served as the Hapsburgs’
summer palace after its completion in the mid-18th century. Only 40 of the
sprawling palace’s 1,441 rooms are open to visitors.
Two different self-guided tours lead the way through state apartments that
brim with gorgeous chandeliers and old-world detail. The basic Imperial
Tour guides you through 22 rooms; the Grand Tour includes 40 rooms,
including 18th-century interiors from the time of Maria Theresa. (Be sure
to call ahead for tour costs and times; summertime tours leave as fre-
quently as every 30 minutes.)
Your visit is not compete without a jaunt through the extravagant rococo
gardens, complete with faux “Roman ruins” and a baroque coffeehouse
that overlooks the gardens (a fantastic photo op). If imperial coaches are
your thing, don’t miss the Wagenburg carriage museum.

Staatsoper (State Opera House)
One of the world’s greatest opera meccas, the regal Staatsoper has a mar-
velous musical heritage dating all the way back to its 1869 opening with a
performance of Mozart’s Don Giovanni. Mahler and Strauss — among
other classical musical titans — have served as its musical directors. Take
a short 40-minute tour during the day or, even better, catch a thrilling per-
formance in the evening (see “More cool things to see and do,” later in this

More cool things to see and do
 Spending a night at the opera: Vienna’s Staatsoper is a truly world-
class theatrical venue, and you don’t want to miss experiencing 
a performance, even if you don’t consider yourself an opera afi-
cionado. The season runs September through June, and you can get
tickets at a variety of prices (5–254/$8–$406) at the box office
one month in advance (% 01-514-442-606), the day after the season
opens (% 01-514-44-2421), or on the Web (www.staatsoper.at).
You can save money and try your luck by purchasing last-minute
tickets the day of a performance, or you can show up at least three
hours before the performance to get in line for standing-room-only
space — it costs only 2 ($3.20), or 3.50 ($5.60) for the Parterre.
Bring a scarf and tie it around the railing at your standing spot —
that’s all you need to do to save your place. Then wander through
the glittery rooms and circulate among the black-tie crowd until the
performance begins.
When the summer heat chases the company out of the State Opera
House, get your opera fix at open-air concerts — from Mozart and
the Vienna Boys’ Choir to Lenny Kravitz and David Bowie — at
Schloss Schönbrunn. The Schloss itself also stages musical concerts
year-round; call for info (% 01-8111-3239; www.imagevienna.com).
 Drinking java, eating strudel, and people-watching at a Kaffeehaus:
Legend has it that Vienna’s first coffeehouse was established in 1683 —
and certainly, they’ve been a vibrant part of Viennese culture ever
since. One of the grandest places, the chandeliered Café Landtmann,
Dr. Karl Lueger Ring 4 (% 01-241-000; www.landtmann.at), was
once a fave of Freud’s.
The granddaddy of all Viennese cafes is Café Demel (% 01-535-
17170; www.demel.at), which moved to Kohlmarkt 14 in 1888 and
hasn’t changed its ornate décor since. You can enjoy your kaffee
in a variety of ways, the most popular being schwarzer (black),
melange (mixed with hot milk), or mit schlagobers (topped with
whipped cream).
Chapter 16: Vienna and the Best of Austria 325

 Seeing the Vienna Boys’ Choir: Dating all the way back to 1498,
this Viennese institution has been the training ground for many 
talented musicians, including Joseph Haydn and Franz Schubert.

to Christmas) at 9:15 a.m. in the Hofburg’s Burgkapelle, with
accompanying members of the Staatsoper chorus and orchestra.
You can pick up tickets at the box office the preceding Friday from
5 to 6 p.m. Get in line early — this is one of the few times you find
people shelling out 5 to 29 ($8–$46) to go to church. The boys
also warble at a weekly afternoon concert somewhere in town (the
venue and times vary), and in summer often put on evening con-
certs at the Schloss Schönbrunn (for info on that last one, visit
www.theviennaboyschoir.com). Contact them at % 01-216-3942
or go to www.wsk.at to see their upcoming concert schedule
(these kids travel a lot).
 Riding the Riesenrad in the Prater: Courtesy of Johann Strauss, Sr.,
in 1820, this former imperial hunting ground on the Danube Canal 
is the birthplace of the waltz. Aside from the lovely grounds, visit
the Prater Park to experience its year-round amusement park/fair
that’s bursting with restaurants, food stands, and a beer garden.
Also, take a spin on the Riesenrad — at 67m (220 ft.) and 100 years,
one of the world’s oldest (and slowest) operating Ferris wheels
(www.wienerriesenrad.com), open daily from 10 a.m. until at least
8 p.m. (to 10 p.m. Mar, Apr, and Oct; until midnight May–Sept).
Admission is 8 ($13) adults, 3.20 ($5.10) children 3 to 14, 20
($32) families (two adults, two kids).
 Watching the horse ballet at the Spanische Reitschule (Spanish
Riding School): You don’t have to attend a show to see the world-
famous Lipizzaner horses strut their stuff. The Hofburg’s school
teaches complicated baroque horse choreography, based on 16th-
century battle maneuvers. The horses and riders practice regularly
(Feb–June 19, Aug 30–Oct 16, and Dec 2–29 Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–1 p.m.).
You can purchase training session tickets from your travel agent or
at the door for 15 ($24) adults, 12 ($19) seniors, 8 ($13) chil-
dren. Get them in advance at the visitor center on Michaelerplatz 1,
or at the door at Josefsplatz, Gate 2.
However, if only the full, 80-minute show will do (Mar–June and
Sept to mid-Dec most Sun 11 a.m.; plus Sat 11 a.m. Apr–May; and Fri
6 p.m. May and Sept), reserve a ticket as far in advance as possible
by visiting www.spanische-reitschule.com. Tickets run 35 to
160 ($56–$256) for seats, 20 to 28 ($32–$45) for standing room.
(Children 2 and under not admitted, but children 3–6 attend free
with adults.) Hour-long dressage training sessions to classical
music sometimes take place during the show season Fridays at 
10 a.m., and you can observe for 25 ($40), though tickets are lim-
ited and tend to sell out quickly.
Part IV: Central Europe 
326

 Taking a heuriger crawl in Grinzing: Heuriger is the name of both
Viennese new wines and the country taverns that serve them. Most
heuriger are centered around the fringes of the famous Vienna
Woods, just a 15-minute tram ride northwest of the city center. The
tradition’s capital is Grinzing, home to about 20 taverns (take tram
no. 38 from the underground station at Schottentor, a stop on the
U2 U-Bahn, and tram nos. 1, 2, and D).
Because of the rising popularity of heuriger crawling, the village
works hard to maintain its medieval look. Stroll down Cobenzigasse
and sample the wine at heuriger along the way while you enjoy the
sounds of accordion and zither music.
Guided tours
You find plenty of city orientation tours, but why pay $20 when a tram
ticket and a good map gets you the same thing minus the stilted com-
mentary? Buy an all-day ticket, step onto the no. 1 or 2 tram, and ride it
all the way around the Ring, hopping on and off at sights where you want
to spend time. The whole ride only takes half an hour if you don’t get off.
After you’re oriented, you can abandon the tram to visit the sights off
the Ring, such as the Hofburg Palace and Stephansdom. The tourist
office has a brochure called Walks in Vienna that can fill you in on
other, more organized guided tours.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this section
offers some tips for building your own Vienna itineraries.
If you have one day
Be at the Hofburg Palace and in the Kaiserappartments at 9:15 a.m. to
admire the excesses of the Hapsburgs, and in the Schatzkammer around
10 a.m. for its impressive medieval crown jewels and other royal artifacts.
Exit the Hofburg by the main Michaelerplatz entrance and start strolling
up Kohlmarkt, pausing to indulge in a coffee and snack or early lunch
amid the 19th-century elegance of Cafe Demel. Turn right on the Graben
to arrive at Stephansdom. Tour the cathedral, climb its south tower for
a city panorama, and then start waltzing your way down the main pedes-
trian drag, Kärntnerstrasse. Settle into the ground-floor cafe of the Hotel
Sacher for a sinfully delicious Sachertorte.
Continue to the end of Kärntnerstrasse where it hits the Ring. Admire the
Staatsoper exterior and, unless you’ll be getting standing-room-only tick-
ets (for which you’ll return here shortly), stop into the box office to pick
up discounted day-of-performance tickets for tonight’s opera. Then hop
tram no. 1, 2, or D heading west/clockwise (left) around the Ring, go one
stop, and get off at Burgring for the Kunsthistorisches Museum and an
hour and a half to two hours of exquisite paintings and ancient statues.
Chapter 16: Vienna and the Best of Austria 327

If you got tickets to the opera, get right back on tram no. 1 or 2 and ride
it clockwise halfway around the Ring road, past the greatest glories of
Viennese architecture. Get off at Schwedenplatz and transfer to the U1;
go two stops north, getting off at Praterstern. Enjoy the city park–cum-
carnival of Prater by taking a late-afternoon spin on the Reisenrad
(Ferris wheel) and tossing back a few tall cold ones in the Biergarten
before returning to the Staatsoper half an hour before the performance
begins. You can also stop for dinner along the way, or just have some
schnitzel in the Prater. If you have plenty of time to make it to the opera
at your leisure, get off the U1 at Schwedenplatz again and simply get
back on tram no. 1 or 2 to continue all the way around the Ring to the
opera house. If you dallied too long in the Prater, stay on the U1 all the
way to Karlsplatz, 2 blocks south of the Staatsoper. If you’re still hungry
after the proverbial fat lady sings, stop at nearby Augustinerkeller,
which stays open until midnight.
Fans of standing-room-only tickets need to plan their evening like so:
Depending on the hour when you get out of the museum, you either
have time (half an hour) to ride tram no. 1 or 2 clockwise almost all the
way around the Ring Road (getting off back at the Staatsoper), or you
can just mosey the 2 long blocks back (counterclockwise) to the opera
house. You need to pick up a snack to eat while waiting in line at the
opera house — be there by 5 p.m. for the best spots. Have dinner late at
Augustinerkeller, after the performance is over.
If you have two days
Spend Day 1 as outlined in the preceding section. That’s a pretty packed
day, so take Day 2 to relax at Vienna’s suburban sights. Head out in the
morning to Schloss Schönbrunn for even more imperial excess than you
saw at the Hofburg. After marveling at Hapsburgian opulence and taking
a spin through the gardens, return downtown on the U4, transferring at
Karlsplatz to the U2 toward Schotten Ring. Get off at the Schottentor
stop and hop tram no. 38 out to Grinzing for an afternoon of heuriger
(country tavern) crawling, snacking, and drinking your way through
Vienna’s specialty foods and white wines. If you’re in town during the
season (and booked tickets long before you left on this trip), get back to
town by 6:30 p.m. so you can take in the 7 p.m. show of the Lipizzaner
horses at the famed Spanische Reitschule.
If you have three days
Days 1 and 2 in the preceding sections give you all the best Vienna has
to offer. Take Day 3 for a big day trip out to the lovely Austrian village of
Innsbruck. For information about Innsbruck, see the next section.
Traveling beyond Vienna: Innsbruck
Although Innsbruck is technically in Austria, traveling there from
Munich, Germany (see Chapter 15), is much faster and more convenient.
Part IV: Central Europe 
328

This section provides directions from both Munich and Vienna, and it’s a
perfect excursion to do en route from one to the other.
Innsbruck, famous for hosting the Winter Olympics as well as the impe-
rial family of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, is a sleepy little gem of a
town, bordered by the stupendous Alps and a milky white river. The 
village is a good starting point for hiking, skiing, and scenic driving.
Getting there
Ten daily trains arrive at Hauptbahnhof from Vienna (five hours away),
passing through Salzburg (two hours away); 14 trains arrive from
Munich daily (one-and-a-half to two hours away).
The tourist office is at Burggraben 3, a road that rings the Altstadt at the
end of Maria Theresien Strasse (% 0512-598-500; Fax: 0512-598-50107;
www.innsbruck-tourism.at). It’s open Monday through Friday 8 a.m.
to 6 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to noon.
If you’ll be doing heavy-duty sightseeing, purchase the Innsbruck Card
to get free access to all city sights and free public transportation. The
tourist office sells cards for 25 ($40) for one day, 30 ($48) for two
days, or 35 ($56) for three days. Children get a 50 percent discount.
Seeing the sights
Walking the Maria Theresien Strasse, you pass through a triumphal arch
and reach the rustic, souvenir shop–lined Herzog Friedrich Strasse. The
Stadtturm tower (% 512-58-7113) is at the end of the street, offering
panoramic views of the surrounding Alps. The tower is open June
through September daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., October through May
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 3 ($4.80) adults, 2.50 ($4)
seniors and students, or 1.50 ($2.40) children 14 and under.
The street ends in a wide spot, which the Goldenes Dachl (% 0512-581-
111) overlooks. The structure is basically an overblown imperial bal-
cony erected and gilded for Emperor Maximilian I in the 16th century as
a box seat for the festivities on the square below. Admiring it from below
is enough, although its Maximilian-oriented museum is open October
through April Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 
2 to 5 p.m., May through September daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Admission is 4 ($6.40) adults, 2 ($3.20) children, 8 ($13) families.
Turn right on Universitätsstrasse, and then left on Rennweg for a half-
hour tour of the exuberant, curving baroque stylings of Maria Theresa’s
Hofburg Palace (% 0512-587-186), open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Admission is 5.50 ($8.80) adults, 4 ($6.40) seniors, 3.65 ($5.85) 
students, 1.10 ($1.75) children 14 and under. Next-door is the equally
rococo Dom (cathedral). Across from the Hofburg at no. 2 Universitäts-
strasse is the Hofkirche (% 0512-584-302; www.hofkirche.at), con-
taining a massive, statue-ridden monument to Maximilian I. It’s open

The main post office is at Fleischmarkt 19
(% 01-5138-3500; www.post.at); it’s open

Safety
Vienna has its share of purse-snatchers
and pickpockets, so be especially cautious
in crowded, touristy areas, especially
Kärntnerstrasse between Stephansplatz
and Karlsplatz. You should also be careful
when taking out your wallet or opening your
purse in public areas; many pitiable chil-
dren who beg for money are accompanied
by adult thieves who snatch wallets and
run. The only central area that can become
somewhat scary after dark is Karlsplatz,
which is frequented by heroin addicts.
Taxes
In Austria, a value-added tax (VAT) is fig-
ured into the price of most items. Luxury
items such as jewelry are taxed 34 percent,
while clothing and souvenirs are taxed 
20 percent. As a foreign visitor, you can
reclaim a percentage of the VAT if you
spend more than 75 ($120) in a single
shop (see Chapter 4).
Taxis
See “Getting Around Vienna,” earlier in this
chapter.
Telephone
All public phones take coins. Some phones
take prepaid phone cards called Wertkarte,
which you can purchase from post offices,
newsstands, and tobacconists.

credit card, insert a nominal fee into the
pay phone and dial % 0-800-200-247 for
AT&T, % 0-800-999-762 for MCI, or

Chapter 17
Bern and the Swiss Alps
In This Chapter
 Finding your way to Bern and the Swiss Alps
 Exploring the neighborhoods of Bern
 Discovering Bern’s best hotels, restaurants, and attractions
 Finding the best of Switzerland’s other great cultural capitals: Zurich and
Basel
 Heading into the alpine countryside and the Bernese Oberland
T
he Swiss capital of Bern is a fine place to visit and — unlike
Switzerland’s larger cities — still has an almost medieval, Swiss-
village feel. But the real attractions of this country are those mighty,
snow-covered Alps. In this chapter, we cover Bern fully, hit the cultural
highlights of Basel and Zurich, and then head south into the Bernese
Oberland, a region that encompasses the legendary 4,092m (13,642-ft.)
peak of the Jungfrau, Queen of the Alps.
Getting There
Bern has direct rail connections to the surrounding countries. This
includes service via a high-speed rail line from France, making the train
a quick and scenic option. The city itself is compact enough that after
you’re here, navigation is a breeze.
Arriving by air
The tiny Bern-Belp Airport (% 031-960-2111; www.alpar.ch), about
9.7km (6 miles) south of the city, receives flights from several major
European cities. A shuttle bus runs from the airport to the city’s train
station, where you can find the tourist office. The 20-minute trip costs
14F ($14). A taxi from the airport to the city costs about 60F ($60). Most
European and transatlantic passengers fly into Zurich’s Kloten Airport
(www.zurich-airport.com), from which one to two trains per hour
make the 90-minute trip direct to Bern. The cost for a one-way ticket is
82F ($82).

Arriving by rail
Bern’s Hauptbahnhof train station (% 031-328-1212; www.sbb.ch) is at
the west end of the Altstadt (Old Town). Ticketing, track access, and
lockers are in the basement. Luggage storage and train and tourist info
are on the ground floor. For national rail information, visit www.sbb.ch,
call % 0900-300-300 (1.19F/$1.19 per minute), or use the computers in
the SBB train info office (across from the tourist office) to look up and
print out your itinerary.
If you leave the train station from the exit nearest the tourist office,
you’ll be facing south; turn left to head into the Altstadt, or Old Town.
Orienting Yourself in Bern
The Aare River is Bern’s defining geological feature. It makes a sharp, 
U-shaped bend around the Altstadt, with the Hauptbahnhof (train station)
at the open (western) end of the U. From here, you can follow the
Spitalgasse east into the heart of the Altstadt. The street’s name soon
changes to Marktgasse, the main road of the Old Town.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Bern’s medieval section, the Altstadt, is small and easily navigable on
foot. Tucked into a sharp, U-shaped bend of the Aare River, the Altstadt
is made up of five long, arcaded streets (whose names change at every
block), two large squares (Bärenplatz Waisenhausplatz/Bundesplatz
and Kornhausplatz/Casinoplatz), and a dozen cross streets. Lots of
shop-lined passageways, not shown on most maps, cut to buildings from
one main drag to another. Just south of the Altstadt, across the Aare, are
several museums and the embassy district (take the Kirchenfeldbrücke
Bridge to get here).
Finding information after you arrive
The Bern Tourist Office (% 031-328-1212; Fax: 031-328-1277; www.
berninfo.com) is in the Hauptbahnhof. It’s open June through
September daily from 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; October through May, it’s open
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. A smaller info station is inside the building at the Bear Pits 
(offering a free 20-minute multimedia show called Bern Past and Present);
it’s open June through September daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., October and
March through May daily 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and November through
February Friday through Sunday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Getting Around Bern
You can buy two types of public-transit tickets (accepted for both buses
and trams): the 2F ($2) version, which is good to travel up to six stops

and valid for 45 minutes, and the 3.60F ($3.60) version for longer rides
over six stops and for up to 90 minutes. You won’t need more than six
stops to get to any of the hotels, restaurants, or attractions in this chap-
ter, so always get the cheaper ticket. Buy your ticket from the machine
at each stop. You can purchase a daily ticket for 12F ($12), but you’d
have to make five or more trips a day (unlikely) to save any money.
By tram and bus
Bern’s bus and tram system (% 031-321-8844; www.berninfo.com) is
extensive, but the Altstadt is small enough to cover on foot. However, if

you’re visiting the Bear Pits, you may want to take bus no. 12 on the way
back uphill toward the city center and station. Most buses and trams
begin and end their routes around the Hauptbahnhof, and many on
Bubenbergplatz just to the station’s south.
“Moonliner” night buses (www.moonliner.ch) run Thursday through
Saturday three or four times between midnight and 4 a.m. (Thurs usually
just at 12:30 a.m.), and cost 5F ($5). The most useful is the M3, which
runs from the train station to the Altstadt, across the river past the Bear
Pits, and returns via the casino. Several others are designed specifically
to get partiers from outlying clubs and dance clubs back to the central
train station.
By taxi
If you’re only sightseeing in Altstadt, you can see it all on foot. If, how-
ever, you want to take a taxi to your hotel, you can catch a cab at 
the train station, Casinoplatz, or Waisenhausplatz; or you can call 
% 031-371-1111, 031-331-3313, 031-311-1818, or 031-301-5353.
By foot
The compact historic center of Bern is only a few blocks wide — and a
joy to wander. Most of the sights listed here won’t take you too far from
that walkable center.
Staying in Bern
Bern is small for a national capital, and conventions and international
meetings overbook it regularly. For this reason, this section features
some of the town’s larger hotels to try to maximize your chances of find-
ing a room. No matter when you plan to visit, make reservations far in
advance.
The folks at the Bern tourist office (% 031-328-1212; Fax: 031-328-1277;
www.berninfo.com) will book you a room for free, or you can use the
big hotel board and free phone just outside the tourist office (at the top
of the escalators down to the train tracks).

This is the hippest, savviest, and most sophisticated hotel in town, with a
flair for elegance. Guests appreciate the panoramic view of the medieval
town center of Bern and the Swiss Alps. That’s reason enough to check 
in — that and the fact that this is the best-rated hotel in town for comfort
and a sense of grace. Set just across the river from the town’s historic core,

Altstadt
This massive hotel is popular with diplomats and business travelers who
are drawn to its modern rooms and large selection of in-house restaurants.
Rooms facing the streets are bigger and brighter than those opening onto
the small inner courtyard. The cheaper rates apply during weekends and
holidays. Children under 16 stay free in their parents’ room (or at a 20 per-
cent discount in a separate one).

Hotel National
$$
Near Hauptbahnhof
The prices are low at this imposing 1908 castle-in-the-city, but it’s a bit life-
less. The elevator doesn’t make it up to the fifth floor, where the bath-
rooms and furnishings are newer and the modern double-glazed windows
more efficient at blocking traffic noise from the boulevard below.
Accommodations are larger than most in Bern, with patterned rugs atop
the carpet and a hodgepodge of faux antique and modular furnishings. The
hotel incorporates the popular South American–themed Shakira bar.

Jost Troxler runs his hotel and restaurant with care (see the “Dining in
Bern” section, later in this chapter, for a review of the latter), and keeps the
prices low for an inn just “99 steps” from the clock tower. The modular fur-
nishings are beginning to show wear but remain sturdy. Rooms on the back
overlook a medieval Bern sweep of rooftops and are the quietest (except
for the charming hourly chimes of the nearby bell tower).

nicer furnishings. See map p. 337. Wyttenbachstrasse 22a (north of the Aare River).
% 031-332-4135. www.marthahaus.ch.
Dining in Bern
Switzerland has taken culinary influences from the surrounding coun-
tries of Germany, France, and Italy, giving Swiss cooking a very interna-
tional flavor. Cheese is a holey Swiss ingredient. There are about 100
varieties besides the sour, hole-riddled Emmentaler we generically refer
to as “Swiss cheese.” Emmentaler and Gruyère, along with white wine,
garlic, and lemon, often get thrown together in a melting crock and car-
ried to your table — fondue, one of the country’s specialties.
Another national specialty is raclette, created when half a wheel of
cheese is held over an open fire. As the exposed surface begins to melt,
the wheel is rushed over to you, and a melted layer is scraped off on
your plate. The dish is eaten with hunks of brown bread.
To go with your cheese, the Swiss offer the omnipresent and delicious
rösti (a sort of hash brown), lake fish, or sausages. Another typical
Bernese dish is the Bernerplatte, a plate of sauerkraut or beans, piled
with sausages, ham, pigs’ feet, bacon, or pork chops.
An excellent way to wash all this down is with one of Switzerland’s fine
white or light red wines or a handcrafted local beer. Swiss chocolates
are some of the world’s finest (Nestlé is a Swiss company). Although
some locals eat chocolate at breakfast, many Americans find that a bit
too rich so early in the morning.
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 339

Cheap cafes and restaurants line Bern’s two main squares, Bärenplatz
and Kornhausplatz. Lining the arcaded streets of the city are kiosks sell-
ing donner kebab (pita stuffed with spicy lamb and a hot sauce), various
Asian nibblers, pizzas, pretzel sandwiches, and Gschnätzltes (a Bern spe-
cialty of fried veal, beef, or pork; order yours sur chabis, with sauer-
kraut).
For a variety of quick-bite options, head to the indoor marketplace
Markthalle, Bundesplatz 11, which features lots of small food booths
hawking prepared specialty foods to take away or to enjoy at a small table.
The hours are Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Thurs),
and Saturday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The supermarkets Migros (Marktgasse 46/
Zeughausgasse 31) and Coop (in the Ryfflihof department store on
Neuengasse) sell fresh picnic ingredients, and both have inexpensive cafe-
terias where meals generally cost less than 20F ($20). They’re both open
Monday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.; Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday 8 a.m. to 
6:30 p.m.; Thursday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.; and Saturday 7 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Altstadt
SWISS
This creaky local legend, housed in a building from the 1500s, has been
around for more than a century. The low-ceilinged, wood-paneled rooms
are cozy and inviting; the service is friendly and furious. The staff weaves
expertly among the large, crowded tables to bring the abundant portions
of ravioli and lamm-médaillons (tender lamb medallions in a rich sauce)
with Swiss efficiency. If you feel like loosening your wallet straps (and your
belt), splurge on the local specialty Bernerplatte, an enormous platter of
grilled meats served over beans and kraut — it’ll cost 45F ($45) but will
probably tide you over for two meals. Most regulars prefer the jovial
tavern atmosphere on the ground floor to the fancier, more sedate dining
room upstairs.

This starched-tablecloth restaurant is a bit pricey (the laid-back brick-

ice and excellent meat dishes, this is one of the best splurge deals in town
for a quiet, understated dinner. The Oberlander rösti (cheesy rösti layered
with bacon and topped by a fried egg) is a house specialty.
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 341
More Bern museums
Bern’s only truly great museum is the Kunstmuseum, although the Bernisches
Historisches Museum is also worth a visit. (You find listings for both of these museums
under “Bern’s top sights,” earlier in this chapter.)
The best of the rest is the Schweizerisches Alpines Museum (Swiss Alpine Museum),
Helvetiaplatz 4 (% 031-350-0440; www.alpinesmuseum.ch), explaining all you ever
wanted to know about the Alps via maps, do-it-yourself slide shows, and a whole col-
lection of scale relief models of alpine regions, some dating from 1800. Admission is
10F ($10) adults, 7F ($7) seniors and students, and 3F ($3) children 6 to 16; hours are
Monday 2 to 5 p.m. and Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed from noon
to 2 p.m. mid-Oct to May).
Others that may pique your interest are the Naturhistoriches Museum (Natural History
Museum), Bernastrasse 15 (% 031-350-7111; www.nmbe.unibe.ch), not the best
of its kind, but you can pay your respects to Barry (1800–1814), the most famous of the
old rescue Saint Bernards (he saved more than 40 people before retiring to Bern at
age 12), and the Museum für Kommunikation (Museum of Communication),
Helvetiastrasse 16 (% 031-357-5555; www.mfk.ch), covering everything from stamps
to cellphones. The admission for the Museum of Communication is 9F ($9) for all
comers; the Natural History Museum charges 7F ($7) adults and 5F ($5) students. Both
keep hours roughly Tuesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; the Natural History
Museum opens at 9 a.m. weekdays and is also open Mon 2–5 p.m.

only at lunch).
Exploring Bern
Bern’s historic center is scenic and walkable, with low-key sights such 
as a dozen statue-topped fountains dating back to the 1500s and the
Zytgloggeturm (Clock Tower), on Kramgasse at the corner with
Bärenplatz, which for more than 460 years has treated Bern to a 
mechanical puppet show four minutes before every hour. May through
October, there’s a 45-minute tour of the clock’s inner workings daily at
11:30 a.m. (July–Aug also at 4:30 p.m.); admission is 10F ($10) adults, 5F
($5) children.
The BernCard is good for unlimited travel on the local trams and buses,
25 percent discounts on city and clock-tower tours, and free entry to
most city sights and museums. It costs 20F ($20) for one day, 31F ($31)
for two days, or 38F ($38) for three days, and is sold at the tourist offices
and major museums.
Bern’s top sights
Bernisches Historisches Museum (Bern Historical Museum)
South of the Altstadt
Switzerland’s second-largest historical museum is housed in a fanciful
faux-medieval castle from 1894 and contains a rich collection of artifacts.
Here you find a bit of everything, from Burgundian suits of armor, fur-
nishings and decorative arts, and Flemish tapestries to the original 15th-
century carvings from the cathedral’s Last Judgment portal and dioramas
of everyday life in Bern over the past three centuries. The Oriental col-
lection (mostly Islamic), is rendered all the more fascinating by its post-
industrial display cases.

A young German dreamer named Albert Einstein was working in the Bern
patent office in 1905 when he came up with E = mc2. While living in this

tionized 20th-century science. The modest museum consists mainly of
photos and photocopied letters, most translated into English.

Kunstmuseum (Fine Arts Museum)
Altstadt
This museum preserves the world’s largest collection of paintings and
drawings by Bern native Paul Klee, offering a unique insight into this early-
20th-century master’s skill with color and expression. Although the gal-
leries also have a smattering of pieces by the likes of Fra Angelico, Duccio,
and Delacroix, the museum’s particular strength is late-19th- and early-20th-
century art: a few works each by the best Impressionists and Surrealists,
along with paintings by Kandinsky, Modigliani, Matisse, Picasso, Léger,
Pollock, and Rothko.

Münster (Cathedral)
Altstadt
On Münsterplatz, with its 16th-century Moses fountain, is Bern’s Gothic
cathedral from 1421, with enormous stained-glass windows and an elabo-
rate Last Judgment carved over the main door (most of it is reproduction;
the originals are in the Bernisches Historisches Museum). The biggest
draw of the cathedral is its 90m (300-ft.) belfry, the highest in Switzerland,
which offers a panoramic view across Bern and its river, with the Alps in
the distance.
See map p. 337. Münsterplatz. % 031-312-0462. Bus: 12. Admission: Cathedral free;
belfry 3F ($3) adults, 1F ($1) children 7–16. Open: Easter Sun–Oct Tues–Sat 10 a.m.–
5 p.m. and Sun 11:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov to the day before Easter Tues–Fri 10 a.m. to
noon and 2–4 p.m., Sat 10 a.m. to noon and 2–5 p.m., and Sun 11:30 a.m.–2 p.m. The
belfry closes 30 minutes before the church.
More cool things to see and do
 Floating down the Aare: Unlike most capital cities, Bern has a river
so unpolluted that the locals actually swim in it regularly. In warm
weather, join the Bernese for a short hike up the river and then a
leisurely float down the Aare to a free public beach just below the
Altstadt. (Make sure you get out at the beach, because a
dam/waterfall is the river’s next stop.)
 Feeding the bears: Bern’s unique sight is the Bärengraben (Bear
Pits), just on the other side of Nydeggbrücke Bridge from the
Altstadt. Here you find up to 12 well-fed live examples of Bern’s
civic symbol roaming around. The city has had bear pits since at
least 1441 — formerly on the square still named Bärenplatz, here
since 1875. The bears are out daily 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 5:30 p.m.
in summer); the keeper sells 3F ($3) baggies of fruit to feed them —
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 343

these hairy fellows ham it up to get you to drop them a piece of
apple or carrot. Remember: They’re strict vegetarians. To the Bear
Pits’ left, a long path leads up the hillside to a ridge planted with
Bern’s fragrant Rosengarten (Rose Garden), with killer views over
medieval Bern.
 Observing how a federal government can operate on just $5 per
citizen per year: Switzerland began as a confederation of three
forest cantons (states) in 1291. Today’s 23 cantons retain a remark-
able degree of autonomy and governmental powers, making this one
of the West’s least centralized democracies. The federal chambers
meet only four times a year for three-week sessions to debate leg-
islative issues and foreign treaties. If you’d like a glimpse into 
such a lean federal machine, you can tour the 1902 Bundeshaus
(Parliament), Bundesplatz (% 031-322-8522; www.bundeshaus.ch),
the dome of which was modeled loosely on that of Florence’s cathe-
dral. Free tours are given Monday through Saturday at 9 a.m., 10
a.m., 11 a.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., and 4 p.m. (except when Parliament is in
session, at which time you can observe from the galleries).
 Shopping ’til you drop (chocolates, watches, and Swiss army
knives): Bern has almost 4 miles of virtually continuous shopping
arcade running down its three parallel main streets, with even more
shops crowding the alleys and corridors connecting them.
Switzerland is home to Nestlé, Lindt, and those triangular
Toblerone chocolates. You can get these famous factory-made
chockies at Merkur, Spitalgasse 2 (% 031-322-3080; www.
merkur.ch). If you want handmade sweets from a traditional con-
fectioner, head to Confiserie Abegglen, Spitalgasse 36 (% 031-
311-2111; www.confiserie-abegglen.ch), or Confiserie Tschirren,
Kramgasse 73 (% 031-812-2122; www.swiss-chocolate.ch) and in
the Markthalle at Bubenbergplatz 9.
If you’re in the market for a fine watch, the shop with the most rea-
sonable prices is Columna, Spitalgasse 4 (% 031-311-0975). If
you’re using this guide mainly to save enough to afford that 4,200F
($4,200) Rolex (that’s the cheapest model), put on your best and
head to the burnished wood shrine of Bucherer, Marktgasse 38 
(% 031-328-9090; www.bucherer.ch).
You can find knives, watches, cuckoo clocks, and a little bit of
everything Swiss (or imagined to be Swiss) at general souvenir
shops such as Swiss Plaza, Kramgasse 75 (% 031-311-5616), or
Boutique Regina, Gerechtigkeitgasse 75 (% 031-311-5616).
Guided tours
The Bern Tourist Office, in the Hauptbahnhof (% 031-328-1212; Fax:
031-328-1277; www.berninfo.com), sponsors a two-hour bus tour of the
center and major sights with a multilingual guide. The tour costs 40F
($40) adults and 15F ($15) children 16 and under; it runs daily at 11 a.m.
(Nov 2–Apr, Sat only).
Part IV: Central Europe 
344

A 90-minute walking tour of the Altstadt costs 18F ($18) adults, 9F ($9)
children 16 and under; it leaves at 11 a.m. daily from June through
September (plus daily in Apr at 2:30 p.m.). June through September, you
can also see the city from below via a 90-minute raft tour daily (55F/$55
adults, 30F/$30 children 16 and under); this is a genuine rubber-raft deal,
not a cruise-type river boat, meaning you help paddle and need to bring
a swimsuit. You have to contact the tourist office to see when these are
running — they require a minimum of four people to sign up before it’s a
go — but they tend to float around 5 p.m.
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this section
offers some tips for building your own Bern-centered itineraries.
If you have one day
You can do the best of Bern easily in a day. First thing, head to the
Kunstmuseum to commune with the works of Paul Klee and other old
and modern masters. At 11 a.m., take a tour of Bundeshaus. Then just
head up to Marktgasse and start strolling downhill toward the far end of
the Altstadt, taking in the ambience of the city, with its soft gray stone
buildings with their coats of arms and red-tiled roofs and the cobbled
streets with their statue-topped fountains. Pop into the Einstein Haus
before having lunch at Klötzlikeller.
After lunch, mosey across the river to visit the bears at the Bärengraben
and climb up to the Rosengarten for a beautiful vista across Bern. Head
back into the Altstadt and detour left up Junkerngasse to visit the
Münster after the cathedral reopens at 2 p.m., and climb its tower for
another great cityscape. If you have time left, cross the river to the south
to check out the Bernisches Historisches Museum before it closes at 
5 p.m. End with a traditional Swiss dinner at Della Casa.
If you have two days
Spend Day 1 as the one-day itinerary, but save the Bernisches
Historisches Museum for the morning of Day 2. On Day 2, after the his-
torical museum and before lunch, check out the Schweizerisches
Alpines Museum, plus any of the others that catch your fancy. After
lunch, head up to Bern’s mini-mountain, the Gurtenkulm, or spend the
afternoon shopping downtown. If you have only two days for all
Switzerland, forget all that and spend Day 2 in the Alps (see “Visiting the
Bernese Oberland,” later in this chapter).
If you have three days
You’ve covered all of Bern’s major sites (see the preceding sections), so
on Day 3, get up early and splurge 240F ($240) on a round trip to the
Jungfraujoch, Europe’s highest train station, slung 3,400m (11,333 ft.) up
between two of the mightiest Alps (see “Visiting the Bernese Oberland,”
later in this chapter).
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 345

Traveling beyond Bern
The two excursions in this section take you to nearby urban 
destinations — Zurich, the banking capital of Europe, and Basel, a col-
lege town with an amazing repository of art. For trips into the country-
side, see “Visiting the Bernese Oberland,” later in this chapter.
Zurich: Swiss counterculture meets high finance
Switzerland’s largest city and banking capital, Zurich is the prettiest of
the country’s big cities. Its oldest quarter is spread over the steep banks
on either side of the swan-filled Limmat River, which flows out of the
Zürichsee (Lake Zurich).
Zurich has always been a hotbed of radicalism and liberal thought. The
Swiss Protestant Reformation started here in the 16th century, and the
20th century has drawn the likes of Carl Jung, Lenin (who spent World
War I here, planning his revolution), Thomas Mann, and James Joyce,
who worked on Ulysses in Zurich and returned a month before his death
in 1941. Joyce’s grave in Friedhof Fluntern cemetery (take tram no. 2) is
near those of Nobelist Elias Canetti and Heidi author Joanna Spyri.
Your best bet is to spend a relaxing 48 hours in Zurich, but you can get a
surprisingly good feel for the city in just a day.
Getting there
Zurich is well connected with Europe’s major cities and is only 75 to 120
minutes from Bern by train. Trains arrive at Hauptbahnhof (the main
train station) on the riverbank at the north end of town. The tourist
office (% 01-215-4000; Fax: 01-215-4044; www.zuerich.com) is at the
train station, Bahnhofplatz 15.
From the station, the tree-shaded shopping street of Bahnhofstrasse
runs south, paralleling the Limmat a few blocks away, all the way to the
shores of the Zürichsee. Running off to the left of this street is a series of
medieval alleys that lead down to the river. Several bridges cross the
river to the wide Limmatquai Street. Narrow side streets lined with
shops lead to the other half of the old city.
You need to hop a tram or bus (www.zvv.ch) for some of the outlying
sights and hotels, even though you can get to most of central Zurich on
foot. The cost is 6F ($6) for rides up to one hour, and 7.80F ($7.80) for a
Tageskarte, a 24-hour ticket.
The ZürichCARD (www.vbz.ch) costs 33F ($33) for 24 hours, 34F ($34)
for 72 hours, and covers all public transport and free admission to 43
museums (plus a free “welcome drink” at two dozen local restaurants).
Part IV: Central Europe 
346

Seeing the sights
The 13th-century St. Peter’s Church at St. Petershofstaat 6 has the
largest clock face in Europe — 9m (29 ft.) across with a 4m (12-ft.) minute
hand. Nearby is one of Zurich’s top sights, the Gothic Fraumünster
church, with five 1970 stained-glass windows by artist Marc Chagall.
From here, cross the Münsterbrücke over the Limmat River to reach
Zurich’s cathedral, the twin-towered Grossmünster. Founded on a site
said to have been chosen by Charlemagne’s horse (he bowed his head
on the spot where a trio of third-century martyrs were buried), its con-
struction ran from 1090 to the 14th century. Swiss artist Alberto
Giacometti designed the stained glass in 1933. Climb the tower (3F/$3)
from March 15 to October 31 for a great city view.
A long walk up Kirchgasse from the church and a left on Seiler Granben/
Zeltweg takes you to Heimplatz and the Kunsthaus (% 01-253-8484;
www.kunsthaus.ch), Zurich’s fine-arts museum. The main collection
starts with the Impressionists of the late 19th century and runs to con-
temporary times, featuring works by Monet, Degas, Cézanne, Chagall,
Rodin, Picasso, Mondrian, Marini, and especially the Swiss-born
Giacometti. Admission is 12F to 18F ($12–$18) for adults, 8F to 16F
($8–$16) for students (free for children 15 and under) — more when one
of the frequent special exhibits is on — and it’s closed Monday (you can
also take tram no. 3 here). Wednesdays, admission is free to all.
Zurich’s cheapest sight is the park lining the mouth of the Zürichsee. You
can stroll the west bank of the lake up and down the General Guisan quai
(at the end of Bahnhofstrasse), which leads to an arboretum. Also at the
base of Bahnhofstrasse are the piers from which dozens of steamers
embark for tours of the lake. A full-length tour of the lake costs 23F ($23)
in second class and 38F ($38) in first class. A shorter boat ride on the
northern third of the lake costs 7.80F ($7.80). For more information, con-
tact the Zürichsee Schiffahrtsgesellschaft (% 01-487-1333; www.zsg.ch).
Where to stay and dine
Zur Oepfelchammer, Rindermarkt 12, just off the Limmat (% 01-251-
2336), serves up reasonably priced Swiss and French cuisine in a
friendly, atmospheric setting. Although pricey at 550F to 850F
($550–$850) double, the romantic Hotel zum Storchen, Am Weinplatz 2
(% 01-227-2727; Fax: 01-227-2700; www.storchen.ch), is the best bet in
town — a 640-year-old inn right on the river in the center of Zurich’s
Altstadt. The tourist office can help you find someplace cheaper or
other rooms if you can’t find a room here.
Basel: Three, three, three countries in one!
The Swiss answer to Four Corners, USA, is Basel, a university city that fea-
tures a pylon on the Rhine River where you can walk in a circle and move
from Switzerland into Germany, then France, and back into Switzerland
(the spot’s called Dreiländereck). Basel’s number of museums (27) makes
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 347

it an art capital of Switzerland, and the city claims Hans Holbein the
Younger (along with thinker Friedrich Nietzche) among its famous past
residents. Non–art lovers needn’t bother visiting, but give the city at least
a day or two if you’re a fan of modern and contemporary art.
Getting there
Half-hourly trains make the 60- to 75-minute trip from Bern and arrive at
SBB Hauptbahnhof. A small branch of the tourist office can be found in
the train station, but the main office (% 061-268-6868; Fax: 061-268-6870;
www.baseltourismus.ch) is on the Rhine at Schifflände 5, just past the
Mittlere Bridge (take tram no. 1). Basel’s compact, historic center lies
mainly on the south bank of the Rhine River.
Seeing the sights
Although the elaborately carved face of the impressive 14th-century
Münster (cathedral) is the pride of Basel, this city is really about muse-
ums. Top honors go to the eclectic collections of the Kunstmuseum
(Fine Arts Museum), St. Alban Graben 16 (% 061-206-6262; www.kunst
musumbasel.ch). This museum has everything from Holbein the Younger
and Konrad Witz to van Gogh, Picasso, Klee, Chagall, Rodin, and
Alexander Calder.
Next door is the Museum für Gegenwartskunst (Museum for
Contemporary Art; % 061-206-6262; www.kunstmuseumbasel.ch), with
art ranging from the 1960s to the present day by the likes of Bruce
Nauman, Joseph Beuys, and Donald Judd. Admission (covering both
museums) is 18F ($18). Nearby you can also find the Kunsthalle,
Steinenberg 7 (% 061-206-9900; www.kunsthallebasel.ch), whose
changing installations by contemporary artists are advertised on ban-
ners throughout town. Admission is 10F ($10). Most Basel museums are
closed on Monday.
The city also has the Basler Zoologischer Garten, Binningerstrasse 40
(% 061-295-3535; www.zoobasel.ch), a world-renowned zoo just a
seven-minute stroll from the train station, with 600 species represented.
Open daily May through August 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., March through April
and September through October 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and November through
February 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; admission is 16F ($16) adults, 14F ($14) sen-
iors, 12F ($12) students 17 to 25, and 6F ($6) children 6 to 16.
Where to stay and dine
The restaurant Gasthof zum Goldenen Sternen, St. Alban-rheinweg 70, at
the Rhine’s edge (% 061-272-1666; www.sternen-basel.ch), has served
up a good, inexpensive medley of French-accented Swiss and Continental
dishes since 1421. Art aficionados with shallow pockets will want to stay
just across the river from the main part of town at the Hotel Krafft am
Rhein, Rheingasse 12 (% 061-690-9130; Fax: 061-690-9131; www.hotel
krafft.ch), overlooking the Rhine. The setting is 19th century, and the
rooms are modern and comfy. Rates are 250F to 310F ($250–$310) double.
Part IV: Central Europe 
348

Visiting the Bernese Oberland
The triple peaks of the Eiger (3,908m/13,025 ft.), Mönch (4,035m/13,450
ft.), and Jungfrau (4,093m/13,642 ft.) dominate the Jungfrau region. A
trip to the area can be a thrilling, scenic ride on trains that hug (or
punch through) cliffsides and ski-lift gondolas that dangle high above
mountain glaciers.
The gateway to the Bernese Oberland is Interlaken, a bustling resort
town in the foothills of the Alps that is flanked by a pair of lakes and is
just a one-hour train ride from Bern. Interlaken itself doesn’t have too
much to hold your interest, but it makes an optimal base for forays into
the Bernese Oberland.
The Alps are scattered with tiny villages and quaint resort towns. One of
the most visitor-friendly of these is Mürren, where we recommend a few
restaurants and hotels. The region calls for at least three or four days,
but on the tightest of schedules you can take an overnight train to
Interlaken, switch for a train up to Jungfraujoch to spend the day, and
make it back to Interlaken by evening for another overnight train out —
but that’s pushing it.
Getting there
Two trains per hour run between Bern and Interlaken (a 50- to 60-
minute ride), some requiring a change in Spiez. Get off at Interlaken’s
Westbahnhof station for the main part of town, or disembark at
Ostbahnhof station to transfer to trains into the Jungfrau region.
Finding information after you arrive
For information on the Bernese Oberland and the Alps, the Tourist Office
of Interlaken (% 033-826-5300; Fax: 033-826-5375; www.interlaken.ch)
is the unofficial central information bureau, with maps and advice on get-
ting around the region. It’s a seven-minute walk from Westbahnhof train
station, in the Hotel Metropole at Höheweg 37. The tourist office is open
May through October Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to noon and 1:30 to 
6 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. (open through the midday break in May,
June, and Oct); July through September, hours are Monday through Friday
8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to noon
and 5 to 7 p.m. You find Mürren’s Tourist Office in the Sportzentrum 
(% 033-856-8686; Fax: 033-856-8696; www.muerren.ch).
General info on the Bernese Oberland is available at www.berner
oberland.ch. Timetables for the major trains and cable cars are 
supplied in English at www.jungfraubahn.ch.
Learning the lay of the land
Interlaken lies on the brief stretch of the Aare River (the same river that
runs to Bern) that connects two lakes, Lake Thun and Lake Brienz —
hence the city’s name, which means “between the lakes.” Its busiest
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 349

tourist area stretches between the two train stations along the Aare. The
road that connects the stations is Bahnhof Strasse, which becomes the
parklike Höheweg.
Now about the Alps: The Bernese Oberland is large, but the information
in this chapter concentrates on the western half — it’s the most popular
and the easiest to reach from Interlaken. Imagine you’re standing in
Interlaken and looking south toward the Alps. Low mountains lie directly
in front of you. Behind them, to the east, is a trio of enormous peaks
called Eiger, Mönch, and, the most famous, Jungfrau.
Farther off to the west (right) is the slightly more modest peak of the
Schilthorn. Running south from Interlaken between the Jungfrau and
Schilthorn is a wide valley called the Lauterbrunnen; this is where the
area’s main train line leads to various alpine destinations. (Halfway up
the valley in the town of Lauterbrunnen is a station where you may
transfer trains frequently.)
Scattered throughout the upper reaches of this valley are many small
resorts and alpine towns, such as Mürren (at the base of the
Schilthorn) and Wengen (halfway to the Jungfrau). Between Interlaken
and Lauterbrunnen town, a valley that branches off to the east from
Lauterbrunnen Valley interrupts the Alpine foothills. Train tracks lead to
here to the village of Grindelwald.
Getting around the Bernese Oberland
Unfortunately, the various scenic and private rail lines — not to mention
funiculars, ski lifts, and cable cars — that connect the peaks and towns
are ridiculously expensive. Rail passes, such as Swissrail or Eurail, only
get you a 25 percent discount at most. Always ask about discounts for
children, seniors, students, and so on. For each of the sights in this
chapter, we give directions and some idea of the frequency of trains and
connections.
Traveling around the Bernese Oberland means plenty of train changes,
but this usually turns out to be kind of fun (if pricey). The wait between
connections is most often five to ten minutes. Because trains tend to run
hourly, it’s fairly easy to hop off at any station, go see whatever town
you’re in, and pick up the transfer an hour or two later.
The tourist office in Interlaken has Bernese Oberland transportation
maps (get one if you plan to explore) and schedules of the whole system.
The staff is usually very good at helping you work out an itinerary. A
summer Bernese Oberland Regional Pass (www.regiopass-berner
oberland.ch) gets you seven days of travel (three days for free, four
days at 50 percent off) for 267F ($267), or 15 days (five days free, ten
days at 50 percent off) for 322F ($322), but again the pass gets you only a
discount on the Jungfraujoch and Schilthorn rides.

Staying in the Bernese Oberland
At Interlaken and Bernese Oberland resorts, you receive a “guest card”
from your hotel for significant discounts on everything from the
Jungfrau train to adventure outfitters. If your hotel doesn’t give you
one, be sure to ask for it.
Interlaken certainly doesn’t lack hotels, but it also doesn’t lack visitors
to fill them. If you’re having trouble finding a room, check out the hotel
billboards at each train station, or visit the tourist office (at the Hotel
Metropole), which can book you a room for free. The tourist offices of

Mürren and other Bernese Oberland towns can help you find rooms as
well, but these burgs are so small that you can do just as well by follow-
ing one of the many hotel signs as you exit the station.
The Bernese Oberland’s top hotels
Hotel Alpenruh
$$$$
Mürren
One of Mürren’s top choices is this alpine-cozy but fully accessorized hotel
next to the cable-car station, with an excellent restaurant and private
sauna. Best of all, the staff gives you a free voucher for a morning ride up
to the Schilthorn where you can breakfast in style — already a 48F ($48)
per-person savings. The hotel stays open year-round, although the restau-
rant closes in November.

Dining in the Bernese Oberland
Most hotels in Bernese Oberland resort towns either require or offer
some meals in their own restaurants — and, in fact, there aren’t enough
non-hotel restaurants to go around. But don’t despair. The hotel food is
usually quite good. However, if possible, try not to sign up for full board;
that way, at least one meal a day you can try the food at other hotel
dining rooms in town.
For a primer on Swiss foods, see “Dining in Bern,” earlier in this chapter.
In Interlaken, you can fill your daypack for picnics and hikes at Migros
supermarket, just to the right of the Westbahnhof, or at the huge co-op
supermarket center across from the Ostbahnhof. You also find a co-op
market in Mürren.
Hirschen
$$$
Matten
SWISS
There has been a Gasthaus Hirschen here since 1666, an oasis of old-
fashioned flavors and alpine hospitality in touristy Interlaken. The low
wood-paneled ceilings and overdressed tables strike an odd balance some-
where between rustic and fussy, but you’ll be glad the fussiness spreads
to their exacting standards in the kitchen — this is by far the best Swiss
dining in town. Try the Hirschen Platte for two, a platter of grilled meats
with rösti and a salad.
Hauptstrasse 11 (in Matten, the southerly neighborhood of Interlaken). % 033-

To cap off an idyllic trip to the Swiss Alps, dine in Europe’s most stratos-

you can tear your eyes away from the view for a moment, sample the
hearty Hungarian goulash or sirloin steak. This place is also a good place
to have a high-altitude breakfast if you catch the first cable car up.

Exploring the Bernese Oberland
Prepare for the unique climate of the skyscraping Alps before you get on
that train to the top of the world. A warm sunny day in Interlaken may
still be sunny atop the Jungfrau, but the wind can bring temperatures
deep into negative territory, so bring a heavy jacket. The sun reflects
strongly off all that snow, and UV rays are more concentrated, so be sure
to wear sunglasses and sunscreen. The highest peaks poke into a very
thin atmosphere (about 30 percent less oxygen than at sea level), so
overexerting yourself into dizziness and hyperventilation is easy.
Check the weather conditions and forecasts before you set off into the
mountains. An overcast day can make an excursion to the panoramic
terraces of Jungfrau or Schilthorn a moot point, and avalanche warnings
may crimp your skiing or hiking plans. Displayed on TVs at train sta-
tions, tourist offices, and hotel rooms are the live Webcam video feeds of
the Jungfraujoch, the Schilthorn, and the Männlichen peaks — which
are also live-linked at www.swisspanorama.com. In addition, the Web
site for Interlaken (www.interlakentourism.ch) links to several local
weather-forecasting sites — most in German, but pretty easy to figure
out. Real-time forecasts are also available by phone at % 162.
The queen peak at Jungfraujoch
The most spectacular and rewarding excursion in the region is to
Jungfraujoch, where at 3,400m (11,333 ft.) — the highest rail station in
Europe — your breath quickens from the stupendous views and the
extremely thin air. An elevator takes you up from the station to the even
higher Sphinx Terrace viewpoint to look out over Europe’s longest gla-
cier, the 25km (16-mile) Great Aletsch, whose melt-off eventually makes
its way to the Mediterranean.
The view goes on seemingly forever — on a clear day, you can even see
as far as Germany’s Black Forest. One of the popular attractions is the
Eispalast (Ice Palace), a warren of tunnels carved into a living glacier
and filled with whimsical ice sculptures, including a family of penguins
and a sumo wrestler. You can eat at a mediocre restaurant (25F/$25
fondue) or a cafeteria up top if you didn’t pack a lunch.

Trains run half-hourly from Interlaken’s Ostbahnhof (two-and-a-half
hours; 172F/$172). You change once in Lauterbrunnen (% 033-
828-7038), pause in Wengen, and change again in Kleine Scheidegg
(% 033-828-7623) before making the final run to Jungfraujoch station
(% 033-828-7901). This popular route has run since 1894, so the trans-
fers are smooth.
Four of the last six miles of track are in tunnels, but the train pauses a
few times to let you peer out to windows in the rock at the glaciated sur-
roundings. On your way back down, you can change trains at Kleine
Scheidegg to detour west to Grindelwald. For more information, con-
tact the Jungfraubahnen directly at % 033-828-7233 or on the Web at
www.jungfraubahn.ch.
A bit of Bond history atop the Schilthorn
A favorite excursion is to take a ride from Mürren — home to a fabulous
Sportzentrum sports complex, with an indoor pool, outdoor skating
rink, squash, tennis, curling facilities, and more — up the dizzying cable
car to the 2,941m (9,804-ft.) peak of the Schilthorn. The trip takes you
across the Lauterbrunnen Valley with views of the Big Three peaks, so
you get a great panorama of the Alps’ poster children. The summit
shares its scenic terrace with the Restaurant Piz Gloria (see “Dining in
the Bernese Oberland,” earlier in this chapter).
When the financiers building Europe’s most spectacularly sighted
restaurant atop the Schilthorn went over budget, James Bond came to
the rescue. A film company used the half-finished structure to play the
role of “Piz Gloria,” headquarters of evil SPECTRE leader Telly Savalas in
On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. George Lazenby (filling in for 007
between Sean Connery and Roger Moore), fought bad guys while hang-
ing from the cable-car lines (and on skis, and in a bobsled . . .). After
shooting wrapped, the film company helped pay for the restaurant’s
completion and, because the movie provided such great advance public-
ity, the restaurant decided to take its stage name.
Trains run every half-hour to Mürren from Interlaken’s Ostbahnhof,
with a change at Lauterbrunnen (60 minutes; 16F/$16). When the funicu-
lar-train line from Lauterbrunnen to Mürren is snowed in, take the
hourly Postbus (15 minutes; 4F/$4) to Stechelberg and the half-hourly
Schilthornbahn cable car (% 033-826-0007; www.schilthorn.ch) up
to Gimmelwald (first stop) and then on to Mürren (10 minutes; 15F/$15).
Half-hourly cable cars from Mürren get you to the top of the Schilthorn
in 20 minutes (96F/$96 round-trip total from Stechelberg — 66F/$66
round-trip from Mürren — with a 25 percent discount if you take the
“early-bird” run before 7:30 a.m.; discounts for various rail- and ski-pass
holders). If you’re up for a workout, you can hike up in a rather demand-
ing, but exhilarating, five hours (a 1,309m/4,363-ft. climb).
Mürren’s Tourist Office is in the Sportzentrum (% 033-856-8686; Fax:
033-856-8696; www.muerren.ch).
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 355

Skiing and other outdoorsy stuff
If you came to Switzerland hoping to log a few miles of Alpine skiing,
you can’t do better than Wengen, a resort under the looming Jungfrau
trio and near the Lauterbrunnen Valley with some 23 lifts (from cable
car to T-bar) and access to most of the region’s major ski areas (Wengen,
Männlichen, and Kleine Scheidegg). There are half-hourly trains here
from Interlaken’s Ostbahnhof, with a change in Lauterbrunnen (45–55
minutes; 13F/$13). Those arriving by car have to leave their wheels in
the garage down in Lauterbrunnen (% 033-855-3244) and take the train
up to car-free Wengen.
The tourist office (% 033-855-1414; Fax: 033-855-3060; www.wengen-
muerren.ch) can help you make sense of the multitude of trails, some 20
lifts (both cable car and chair), and more than 7 miles of cross-country ter-
rain. They can also point you toward rental outfitters and the local branch
of the famous Swiss Ski School (% 033-855-2022; www.skiwengen.ch).
Less intrepid sports enthusiasts can skate or curl in town.
When there isn’t much snow, Wengen sports more than 310 miles of
hiking trails (most open in summer only, but 31 miles open in winter,
too). One of the most popular is a fairly flat jaunt along the wide ridge of
the Männlichen massif, from the top of the Männlichen cable-car station
(% 033-854-8080) to Kleine Scheidegg (90 minutes; descending gradu-
ally about 167m/555 ft.). A bit more of a workout, but wonderfully scenic,
is the steady uphill walk from Wengen to Kleine Scheidegg, with a
panorama of the Jungfrau group (two-and-a-half to three hours;
778m/2,594-ft. climb).
Even more spectacular hikes are available in Lauterbrunnen Valley
(Lauterbrunnen town is 15 minutes by train or 90 minutes by foot 
below Wengen). From Lauterbrunnen, take the hourly postal bus or
walk, in 45 minutes, to Trümmelbach Falls (% 033-855-3232; www.
truemmelbach.ch), actually ten stair-stepped waterfalls in one, created
by glacial melt-off from the surrounding mountains, thundering down
the deep crevice of a gorge at 20,000 liters per second. April through
November, you can ride an elevator up the inside of the cliff to stroll
behind the cascades daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (July–Aug 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.);
bring a raincoat. Admission is 11F ($11) adults and 4F ($4) children 6 to
16. Also near Lauterbrunnen, Staubbach Falls is a 300m (1,000-ft.)
ribbon of water plunging straight down the valley’s cliffside at the edge
of Lauterbrunnen town.
Hikes in the hills from Grindelwald
Cars can reach Grindelwald, so this resorty village in the eastern alpine
foothills gets more crowded than its less-accessible neighbors. However,
the village is also one of the best bases for hiking. Half-hourly trains
from Interlaken’s Ostbahnhof take 36 minutes and cost 9.80F ($9.80). Be
sure you’re on the right car; the train splits in half at Lauterbrunnen
Part IV: Central Europe 
356

The Tourist Office (% 033-854-1212; Fax: 033-854-1210; www.grindelwald.
travel/de/welcome.cfm) has trail maps covering everything from easy
scenic rambles to rock climbing up the sheer eastern face of Mount
Eiger. Or Grindelwald Sports (% 033-854-1280; www.grindelwald
sports.ch) can organize guided hikes of all degrees of difficulty, from
glacier-climbing lessons to an easy, three-hour guided romp along the
foot of Mount Eiger.
An hour’s hike up to Milchbach brings you to the base of the Obere
Gletscher glacier, whose milky white runoff gives the spot its name. If
you continue 45 minutes up the side of the glacier, you’re treated to the
Blue Ice Grotte. Glacial ice turns a deep, resonant blue as you get down
into it, and you can take a spin inside a slowly creeping glacier here for
6F ($6) mid-May through October daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. A postal bus can
run you back down to town in 15 minutes.
Fast Facts: Bern
Chapter 17: Bern and the Swiss Alps 357
Area Code
Switzerland’s country code is 41. Bern’s city
code is 031. If you’re calling Bern (or any
other Swiss destination) from beyond
Switzerland’s borders, drop the city code’s
initial 0. To call Bern from the United States,
dial % 011-41-31 followed by the phone
number.
Currency
Switzerland has so far opted out of adopting
the euro. The basic unit of currency is the
Swiss franc (we abbreviate it F, though some-
times you’ll see it as CHF), which is com-
posed of 100 centimes. At press time, the
Swiss Franc and the U.S. dollar were trading
at par (i.e., 1F = US$1). Although this specific
ratio can and probably will change by the
time you get to Switzerland, we advise that
you use the conversions within this chapter
only as a rough guideline for a situation that
most experts define as economically volatile.
Doctors and Dentists
For a list of doctors and dentists, visit the
U.S. consulate (see the following listing) or
call the national English-speaking tourist
hot line at % 157-5014 (2.13F/$2.13 per
minute).
Embassies and Consulates
The U.S. Embassy, Jubiläumsstrasse 93 
(% 031-357-7011; http://bern.
usembassy.gov; Bus: 19), is open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Emergency
Dial % 117 for the police; % 144 for an
ambulance; % 118 to report a fire; and 
% 140 (not a free call) for car breakdown.
Hospitals
For emergency care, go to the 650-year-old
Insel Hospital, Freiburgstrasse (% 031-
632-2111; www.insel.ch).
Information
The Bern Tourist Office (% 031-328-1212) is
in the Hauptbahnhof (train station). For
specifics on it, and on other offices, see
“Finding information after you arrive,” near
the beginning of this chapter.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
The traveler’s best bet in Bern is the BZ Café,
Zeughausstrasse 14 (% 031-327-1188). Run
by Berner Zeitung, the local daily paper, the

cafe lets you use the half-dozen computers
with lightning ISDN access for free. (Yes, it’s
popular, but they even have some Sega game
systems for you to play while you wait.)
Maps
The map handed out for free by the tourist
office is more than adequate for ambling
about the tiny town center.
Newspapers and Magazines
Aside from the local daily Berner Zeitung
(German only), there’s no particular maga-
zine or newspaper for visitors in the city,
but the tourist office has scads of pam-
phlets and announcements on current
events, shows, concerts, and the like.
Pharmacies
Central-Apotheke Volz & Co.,
Zeitglockenlaub 2 (% 031-311-1094;
www.central-apotheke-volz.ch),
staffs English-speaking attendants. Located
near the Clock Tower, it’s open Monday 
9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., Tuesday through Friday
7:45 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 7:45 a.m.
to 4 p.m.
Police
Dial % 117 for the police.
Post Office
Bern’s main post office (% 031-311-1094;

(behind the train station), open Monday
through Friday 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 
8 a.m. to 4 a.m., and Sunday 4 to 9 p.m.
There are several branches throughout the
Altstadt.
Safety
With the exception of the park that sur-
rounds Parliament, where heroin addicts
roam after dark, you should feel comfortable
on the streets of central Bern, day or night.
But take the same precautions you’d take in
any city to protect yourself against crime.
Taxes
Switzerland’s value-added tax (VAT) on
consumer goods is 7.6 percent. Foreigners
who spend more than 400F ($400) at one
store can reclaim it by requesting the nec-
essary forms at the store.
Taxis
See “Getting Around Bern,” earlier in this
chapter.
Telephone
A local call in Bern costs 0.80F (80¢).
Switzerland’s phone system is highly
advanced — most booths contain digital,
multilingual phone books — and few
phones accept coins anymore. You can use
your major credit cards in most pay phones,
or buy a Taxcard (prepaid phone card) in
denominations of 5F ($5), 10F ($10), and 20F
($20) from the train station or any news-
stand, gas station, or post office. For direct
dialing internationally, you may want the
Value Card versions for 20F ($20) or 50F
($50). Dial % 111 (not free) for directory
assistance.
To charge your call to a calling card (or
make an operator-assisted call), dial the
appropriate number: AT&T (% 0-800-
890-011), MCI (% 0-800-890-222), or Sprint
(% 0800-899-777). To call direct from Bern
abroad, dial 00 followed by the country
code (1 for the United States), the area
code, and the number.

Prague and Environs
In This Chapter

 Discovering the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions
 Exploring beyond Prague
P
rague emerged from behind the Iron Curtain in 1989 to shine once
again as a world-class city. Cobbled streets weave past baroque
palaces, lively beer halls, glowering castles, and light-infused cathedrals.
In summer, some of the best street musicians in Europe play on elegant
bridges spanning the swan-filled river.
When the Communist Bloc disintegrated with the Soviet Union’s
breakup, a group of Czech activist writers and artists, led by Václav
Havel, encouraged Czechoslovakia to make a peaceful transition from
communism to democracy. The movement, which many called the
“Velvet Revolution,” also peaceably redrew the ancient dividing line
between the Czech and Slovak republics. Prague became the hot new
destination, a “Paris of the ’90s” for Gen-Xers imitating Hemingway’s
expat routine. But because of rapid expansion, the city’s magic was
doused by skyrocketing prices and tainted by the influx of Western cul-
ture. But Prague has finally revived itself.
In summer, backpackers and bus-tour groups flock to the city — if you’re
looking for a romantic setting, pick another season. And you may hear
more English than Czech spoken on the streets of the Old Town. In the
fall and winter, the crowds are gone, and Prague is all yours. Look for the
magic, and spend several days of your trip here to fully capture the
city’s dreamy flavor. The skyline is dotted with spires, steeples, and
towers, and Prague becomes a fairy-tale place at sunrise and sunset.
With a little practice, you can pronounce tongue-twisting Czech words
with ease. Vowels are usually short, but any accent makes them long.
Consonants are pronounced more or less as in English, except slightly
roll your r’s, and c sounds like ts, c sounds like ch, ch sounds like k, j
sounds like y, r sounds like rsh, s sounds like sh, w sounds like v, and z
sounds like the slurred zh sound in azure or pleasure. Pronounce 

consonants followed by an apostrophe (d, n, t) as if there were a y fol-
lowing them. For example, dekuji (thank you) is pronounced dyeh-koo-
ee; chci (I would like . . .) is spoken ktsee; and námestí (square) is
pronounced naah-mee-stee.
Getting There
To get to your hotel, you can pick up a bus or taxi at the airport; train
stations are connected to the subway lines. Although subway stations
abound in central Prague, the best way to explore the city is on foot.
Arriving by air
Prague’s small Ruzyne airport (% 220-113-314; www.prg.aero), is
19km (12 miles) west of the city center. Inside the manageable arrivals
hall is an information desk that doesn’t hand out city maps but will tell
you how to get downtown. Several ATMs are located throughout the hall.
From the airport, a half-hourly CEDAZ (% 220-114-296; www.cedaz.cz)
shuttle bus runs every 30 minutes to námestí Republiky, for 120Kc
($7.45). City bus no. 100 is an express heading right from the airport to
the Zlicín Metro stop (west end of the B line) in 15 minutes; bus nos. 119
and 254 zip to the Dejvická stop (western terminus of the A Metro line)
in 20 minutes. A ticket on any technically costs 18Kc ($1.10), but
because you’ll want to hop on the Metro after you get there, buy the
transfer ticket, which costs 26Kc ($1.60) — annoyingly, you’ll also have
to buy a 13Kc (80¢) ticket for each piece of luggage.
A taxi from the airport downtown should cost around 650Kc ($40). You
can line up for a taxi at the curb, but you’re more likely to get a fair deal
and a lower rate if you call one of the radio taxi companies listed under
“By taxi,” later in this chapter (though you’ll have to wait ten minutes 
or more).
Arriving by rail
Trains arrive in Prague either at the Hlavní Nádrazí (Main Station) on
the east edge of Nové Mesto, or, from Berlin and other northerly points,
at the smaller Nádrazí Holesovice (Holesovice Station) across the river
to the north of the city center.
Both train stations, especially the main one, which has recently under-
gone a massive reconstruction, are seedy and chaotic. Dozens of hote-
liers practically assault you the instant you step off the train, trying to
sell you a hotel room — very annoying. Just ignore them and push
ahead. If you want a reputable accommodations agency, see the “Staying
in Prague” section, later in this chapter.

Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 361
Orienting Yourself in Prague
Central Prague is divided into four main neighborhoods that straddle
both sides of the Vltava River, which flows through the city from the
south and then curves off to the east. Staré Mesto (Old Town) is tucked
into a bend of the river (on the east bank), hemmed in by the Vltava on
the north and west and by the continuous arc of streets Národní/
28.Ríjna/Na Príkope/Revolucní on the south and east.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Staré Mesto, which means Old Town, is Prague’s center. You find meander-
ing streets dating back to the Middle Ages and wide boulevards from
more-recent centuries. Filled with restaurants, cafes, and gorgeous Gothic
and baroque architecture, the area is a great place to spend most of your
time. Within Staré Mevsto is Josefov, the famed old Jewish quarter. The
focal point of the Old Town is Staromestské námestí (Old Town Square).

Surrounding the Old Town on all but the riverside is the Nové Mesto (New
Town). Much less interesting than the Old Town or the Malá Strana dis-
trict (described later in this section), New Town is comprised mostly of
office and apartment buildings. Still, you may enjoy the National Theater
here, and the hotels are generally less expensive than those in Old Town.
In the center of Nové Mesto is Václavské námestí (Wenceslas Square), a
4-block-long divided boulevard sloping gradually up to the dramatic neo-
Renaissance National Museum. The strip down the middle (for pedes-
trian traffic) is lined on both sides with sausage stands and neoclassical
and Art Nouveau buildings. (This area has been called New Town since
its 1348 founding; the fact that much of that medieval neighborhood was
replaced in the 19th and 20th centuries by an even newer New Town is
just a coincidence.)
You cross a statue-lined Karlu most (Charles Bridge) from the Old Town
into the Malá Strana, the “Little Quarter” on the west bank of the Vltava
River. Above the Malá Strana is the small Hradcany, the “Castle District,”
which houses Prazsk; Hrad (Prague Castle), the city’s major sight. Over
the centuries, many palaces (several now housing museums) and
monasteries have gathered around this traditional seat of government.
Beyond Prague’s four traditional neighborhoods, the city has sprawled
outward in every direction. One outlying neighborhood that you may
want to visit is on the eastern edge of New Town. Vinohrady was named
after the vineyards (owned by the king) that once filled this upscale resi-
dential zone. If Prague has a modern trendy district, Vinohrady is it —
clean, full of shops and restaurants, and just a short hop from the city
center on the Metro line A.
Finding information after you arrive
Prague Information Service (PIS), at Staromestské námestí 1, at the Old
Town Hall (% 12-444; www.pis.cz), is one of the information offices in
town. PIS is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Nov–Mar, it closes at 6 p.m. during the week and
at 5 p.m. on Sat and Sun). You’ll find other branches at Rytírská 31, in the
main train station and (summer only) in the tower over the Malá Strana
end of Charles Bridge.
Getting Around Prague
You can use the same tickets for all of Prague’s public transportation.
The 18Kc ($1.10) neprestupní (“no change”) version is good for 20 min-
utes or five metro stops, but you cannot change to another bus/tram
(you can transfer within the Metro). With the 26Kc ($1.60) prestupní
(“change”) version, you can make unlimited bus, tram, or Metro trans-
fers within the 75-minute time limit (90 minutes 8 p.m.–5 a.m. and on
weekends). There are also one-day (100Kc/$6.20), three-day (300Kc/$19),
and five-day (500Kc/$31) passes available.
Part IV: Central Europe 
362

You can buy tickets from machines at Metro stations, newsstands
marked TABÁK or TRAFIKA, and DP ticket kiosks.
By Metro (subway)
Prague’s Metro (subway) system does a good job of covering the town
with only three lines: A, B, and C. Each line intersects the other two only
once: A and B at M*stek (the north end of Václavské námestí), A and C
at Muzeum (the south end of Václavské námestí), and B and C at Florenc
(a regional bus station).
By tram and bus
The tram system, supplemented by buses, is a more complete network
that effectively covers much of central Prague. In winter, the tram seats
are heated. Beware of tram nos. 22 and 23: Many people call them the
“pickpocket trams” because of the pickpockets who prey on riders. The
lines pass by the National Theater and head through the Malá Strana up
to Prague Castle. Staré Mesto has only a few public trams and buses fol-
lowing its boundary roads. Several lines skirt the riverbank (especially
tram no. 17) to hit Staromestské námestí, which also has a Metro line A
station.
By taxi
You probably don’t want to use a taxi unless your hotel is a great distance
from Prague’s center. The taxi drivers are notorious for ripping off unsus-
pecting tourists. If you must take a taxi, call a radio cab. In a pinch, hail
one on the street, but be careful — you may end up with an unlicensed
mafia cab (mafia here means that you’re likely to be taken for a ride —
financially, that is).
Wherever you get the cab, keep an eye on the meter. The display window
on the left shows your fare; the window on the right should read 1, 2, 3,
or 4, indicating the rate you’re being charged. (The higher the number, the
higher the rate.) Unless you venture far out from the center of town, 
the window on the right shouldn’t read anything but 1 (although the park-
ing lot of the main railway station is zoned 2). The initial charge should 
be 40Kc ($2.50) and then 28Kc ($1.75) per kilometer. If the rate is
increasing by more than that, question it.
Don’t let a taxi driver cover the meter’s displays or change the rate as he
changes gears. Let the cabbie see you making a note of the taxi number
and any other identifying info as you get into the cab, and sit in the front
seat to keep an eye on the driver.
Your chances of getting an honest cabbie are better if you call a radio-
cab company (most Praguers tell you never to hail a cab, especially ones
waiting around tourist sights). Because a radio cab’s trip is logged in an
office, inflating the fare is more difficult for the driver. Companies with
English-speaking dispatchers include AAA Taxi (% 14-014) and
ProfiTaxi (% 844-700-800).
Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 363

Staying in Prague
Prague is an expensive city, probably the most expensive in Eastern
Europe. Prices soared in the years after the fall of the Iron Curtain but
have since stabilized and, in some cases, gone down as competition has
increased. The priciest rooms are in the most desirable neighborhoods:
Staré Mesto and Malá Strana.
The Czech Republic is a member of the European Union (EU). Although
the country has promised to eventually change to the EU’s common cur-
rency, the euro, this won’t happen for several years, until there is even
more convergence in economic strength. In the meantime, things gener-
ally are more expensive as the gross domestic product (GDP) grows.
Even though wider access to better-quality suppliers and the competi-
tion created by it led to lower prices on some goods, luxurious items
and electronics are still more expensive than in Western Europe. On the
other hand, food and services are cheaper and more affordable.
The rapid capitalist invasion has also led to some dubious business
practices. Many hotels charge one price for Czechs and another for for-
eign tourists. It’s annoying but unavoidable. Hotels won’t give you a
good exchange rate from koruna to dollars, so don’t pay your bill in dol-
lars or euros (though most business-oriented hotels still tie their rates
to one of those two stable currencies).
Remember: As soon as you step off the train at the station, you’re
accosted by an army of hotel representatives trying to sell you a good
deal on a room. These deals are almost always a scam. Either the hotels
have an inconvenient location, don’t look anything like the “creative”
photos suggest, or charge hidden extra fees not included in the quoted
rates. If you need help finding a room, go to a legitimate agency instead.
Plenty of these agencies can help you find a hotel room, a pension, or
even a full apartment. The most reputable is AVE Ltd. (www.avtravel.
cz), with desks at the PIS offices (for open hours see “Finding informa-
tion after you arrive” earlier in this chapter) — in the Old Town Hall at
Staromestské námestí 1 (% 224-223-613) — as well as in the arrival

Prague’s top hotels
Betlem Club
$$
Staré Mesto
The Betlem Club is a pleasant enough hotel in a quiet corner of the Old
Town across the street from the church where Jan Hus started his Protestant
revolution. Most of the rooms are done in shades of brown, tan, gray, brass,
and the odd orange splash, but they are immaculately kept. They’re oddly

shaped, but most are of a good size (except for some of the top-floor
mansard rooms, which can be comically cramped).

Hotel Evropa
$
Nové Mesto
You may be impressed by the remarkable, statue-topped Art Nouveau
facade (from around 1903–1905) and classy sidewalk cafe of Prague’s pret-
tiest hotel. Unfortunately, the rooms seem to belong to a different hotel
entirely. They vary widely in size and décor. Most are merely adequate,
and some verge on dingy, but many also have a bit of faded low-rent, turn-
of-the-20th-century style hanging about. The rooms on the high-ceilinged
first two floors make for quite an enjoyable stay.

Hotel Kampa
$$$
Malá Strana
The Kampa is a Best Western affiliate inhabiting a 17th-century armory on
a quiet side street across the river, about a five-minute walk from the
Charles Bridge. The simple, whitewashed, somewhat large rooms are bor-
ingly institutional but comfy enough. Try to get one overlooking the river
or nearby park. The restaurant is a trippy cellar joint outfitted in that faux-
medieval crossed-swords-on-the-wall style.

Hotel Paríz
$$$$
Staré Mesto
This whimsically fantastic Czech Art Nouveau behemoth was built in 1904
at the edge of the Old Town. It is, hands-down, the choice for luxury in
town, with far more character than most Prague business hotels. The large
rooms were overhauled in 1998 and fitted with a modern interpretation of
Art Deco — soft sofas and chairs in a sitting corner and contemporary
prints on the walls. The lobby is flanked by the Café de Paris and the Sarah
Bernhardt, serving French and international delicacies, the ceilings fea-
ture Art Nouveau chandeliers, and the walls are wrapped with aqua and
gold mosaics.

Dining in Prague
Traditional Czech cuisine is usually simple and hearty. Soups are meaty
and frequently flavored with garlic. A favorite is hovezí polévka s
játrov;mi knedlícky (liver dumplings in beef stock). Praguers are fond of
dumplings, called knedlíky, made of potatoes (bramborové) or bread
(houskové) and sliced into discs. Dumplings are side dishes to such
favorites as svícková na smetane, a beef pot roast sliced and served with
a creamy and rich vegetable sauce and a sour cranberry chutney.
Also check out pecená kachna, roast duck with bacon dumplings and
sauerkraut. Game dishes, such as zverina (venison), zajíc (hare), bazant
(pheasant), and husa (goose), are usually roasted. Popular freshwater
fish are pstruh (trout) and kapr (carp). Hungarian gulás (beef goulash) is
a good, cheap standby for quick lunches. The best desserts are ovocné
knedlíky (fruit dumplings), vdolek (jam tarts), and chocolate- or fruit-
filled palacinky (crepes).
Czech pivo (beer) is a great brew. Light-colored beer is svetlé (svyet-lay);
dark beer is cerné (cher-nay). This is the home of Pilsner Urquell, the
Part IV: Central Europe 
368

country’s famed lager (the brewery also makes a smooth, for-local-
consumption-only beer, Gambrinus). If you’re a beer-drinker, you may
also want to try Staropramen (the most common Prague suds), and
Velkopopovick; Kozel (a wonderful dark beer).
By far, the most renowned Czech beer is Budvar, the original Budweiser —
although it’s nothing like the watery, mass-produced American beverage.
(Budvar and Anheuser-Busch have been fighting for years over the name
rights.)
With the exception of some of the better restaurants and the tourist-trap
places nearest the sights, meals in Prague can be very inexpensive. One
of the trade-offs is remarkably poor service, a relic of the Communist
era, when restaurant patrons received their meals only at the extreme
convenience of the server. When service is haughty, ignore it and don’t
tip; when service is scarce, just chalk it up to economic growing pains.
As investors start finer restaurants in Prague, their attention to service
and food presentation should raise the bar for the rest of the industry.
Watch out for these restaurant rip-offs:
 Every item brought to your table may be charged to your bill,
including bread, bowls of nuts, and so on. Often, these small
items turn out to be ridiculously expensive. Make sure that you
know the price of everything before you eat it.
 Examine your bill closely at the end of the meal to make sure it
isn’t padded with items that you didn’t order. Also, some restau-
rants doctor the amount written on a credit-card slip, so you may
want to write the total, in words, somewhere on the slip.
For quick eats, tasty, tiny, open-faced sandwiches called chlebícky are all
the rage at U Bakaláre (Celetná 13). Sidewalk stands hawk klobásy
(grilled sausages) and párky (boiled frankfurters) served with bread and
horcice (mustard).
Bellevue

At Bellevue, one of the city’s finest restaurants, you can enjoy your food
surrounded by live music and, if you scam a window seat, a view of Prague
Castle. The international menu varies from spinach tagliatelle in a salmon
cream sauce to braised rabbit, always well prepared and presented. But
the veggie dishes are less than thrilling. Sunday brunch features live jazz.

CZECH/GAME
This very private and relaxing Art Nouveau–style space is renowned for
its traditional Czech game dishes. The interior contains a series of small
dining rooms with vaulted ceilings and playfully frescoed walls. Service 
is professional and friendly, and the refined cookery manages to rise 
above most “Bohemian cuisine” in town, while still remaining adamantly
Czech — lots of duck and venison alongside salmon, trout, and rabbit (but
you can get beef, pork, and chicken as well).

REFINED CZECH
If you’d like to sample the best of fine Czech cuisine but don’t quite have
the scratch to pay for U modré (preceding listing) or the Vinárna (follow-
ing listing), make reservations at “The Three Blue Balls,” another of
Prague’s excellent, candlelit, cellar restaurants — but one without the airs
(or high prices) of its culinary compatriots. The cooking, though, is top-
notch, as it has been since 1816. The duck breast in cabernet is tender, and
the beef medallions in a honey-wine sauce are absolutely delicious.

apple strudel with ice cream and eggnog is a must for dessert.

Exploring Prague
Although Prague’s classical music and the Czech Republic’s unmatched
beer are reasons to visit, the primary draw for many is simply walking
along the winding cobblestone streets and enjoying the unique atmos-
phere. This section points out highlights to look for along the way.
Part IV: Central Europe 
370

Prague’s top sights
Jewish Prague
Josefov
The Jewish Museum in Prague is the organization managing all the Jewish
landmarks in Josefov, which forms the northwest quarter of Old Town.
Jews lived in Prague before the 10th century, but by the 12th century, they
were confined to a small part of town. At the time, this area was walled off.
Ironically, even though 88,000 of the country’s 118,000 Jews died during
the Holocaust, Nazi occupiers spared this center of Jewish culture. Hitler
planned to put all the scrolls, torahs, and other artifacts he collected while
exterminating Jews across Europe on display in Prague, turning Josefov
into a “museum to a vanished race.”
Most of those seized items were returned in 1994 to the Diaspora from
which they had been taken, but more than 39,000 local items (and more
than 100,000 books) from Bohemia and Moravia stayed here in Prague as
part of the Jewish Museum, its collections split among several synagogues.
You can see Josefov’s highlights in 45 minutes to an hour, but we recom-
mend spending a morning here.
The area has become so insanely popular that it now operates a bit dis-
concertingly like a theme park: You go to a central ticketing office to pick
up your multi-admission ticket, which has timed entries to each of the
neighborhood’s sights, in order.
Your first stop is right next to the ticketing office window at the Klausen
Synagogue (on U Starého Hrbitova), now deconsecrated and containing
the first half of a collection that illustrates the fascinating sociocultural
history of the Czech Jews. The exhibits continue in the nearby Ceremonial
Hall, the cemetery’s former mortuary hall, highlighting the customs and
traditions surrounding illness and death, including a fascinating series of
small paintings depicting all the steps in funeral ceremonies (which, for
some frustrating reason, are no longer hung all together in one room, nor
are they presented in chronological order, rendering it a bit difficult to
make sense of it all).
Next up, behind these buildings, is one of Prague’s most evocative sights:
the Old Jewish Cemetery, off U Starého Hrbitova, behind a high wall. This
Jewish burial ground dates to the 15th century — when Jews couldn’t bury
their dead outside of the ghetto. Within this 1-block plot, they had to find
final resting places for some 20,000 to 80,000 deceased (the exact number
is unknown). Consequently, they stacked the bodies 12 deep in some
places. The shady, overgrown, undulating ground is blanketed with some
12,000 time-worn tombstones lurching and tilting in varying degrees of dis-
repair. The air is melancholy yet serene. This is one sight in Jewish Prague
that you don’t want to miss. The somewhat elaborate sarcophagus is of
the holy man Rabbi Loew, who died in 1609.
Josefov’s most moving sight is next door, the Pinkas Synagogue on Siroká,
built in the flamboyant High Gothic style of the 16th century. From 1950
Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 371

to 1958, Holocaust survivors painted on the inside walls the names of
77,297 Czech Jews who died under the Nazi regime. The Communist regime
closed the synagogue and, claiming that dampness was leading to the dete-
rioration of the walls, had the place replastered. As soon as communism
ended and the synagogue was reopened, the Jews began the meticulous,
four-year task of inscribing those names back on the walls. After Prague’s
disastrous summer 2002 floods filled this low-lying area with water and
mud, they had to break out the paintbrushes yet again and start re-letter-
ing all the names on the lower few feet of the walls. Upstairs are drawings
(from a collection of 4,000) made by Jewish children while interned at the
nearby Terezín Nazi camp (see “Traveling beyond Prague,” later in this
chapter). Of the 8,000 children who passed through there on the way to
concentration camps, only 242 survived.
Two blocks over and down sits the next stop, the 16th-century Maisel
Synagogue, on Maiselova, a renovated space that contains an exhibit of
historical Jewish objects from the 10th to the 18th centuries. Part II of this
collection (18th century to the present) resides several blocks to the east,
up Siroká, in the gorgeous neo-Renaissance/Iberian-styled 1868 Spanish
Synagogue, on Dusní; it was reopened in late 1998 after a decades-long
restoration of its lush, Moorish-inspired decorations.
There’s one other sight in Jewish Prague that’s still an active temple and,
therefore, not part of the Jewish Museum group: the Old-New Synagogue,
at cervená 2, built in 1270 and the only Gothic temple of its kind remain-
ing. The small interior is beautiful, with high ceilings crisscrossed with
five-ribbed fan vaulting. (Gothic church vaulting uses four ribs, but
because those ribs represent the cross, the Jews decided five would be a
bit more appropriate.) Admission to this one is a ridiculous extra 200Kc
($12), paid at a shop across the street from the entrance.
See map p. 366. The ticket window is at U Starého Hrbitova 3a (right in the crook of an
elbow-shaped street between Brehová and Parízská). % 222-317-191. www.jewish
museum.cz. Metro: A to Staromestská. Tram: 17, 18, 51, or 54. Bus: 135 or 207.
Admission: 290Kc ($18) adults, 190Kc ($12) seniors and students. Open: Nov–Mar
Sun–Fri 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Apr–Oct Sun–Fri 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Karl*v most (Charles Bridge)
Between Malá Strana and Staré Mesto
This may be the loveliest and liveliest bridge anywhere in Europe. The
statue-lined Charles Bridge is bustling with people throughout the day and
evening — tourists, musicians, street performers, caricature artists, and
crafts peddlers. The 510m (1,700-ft.) span was constructed in the 14th cen-
tury, but the majority of statues date from the early 18th century. (Actually,
what you see on the bridge are copies; most of the originals have been
moved inside for protection from the weather.)
Two of the earliest statues include the 1629 crucifix near the Old Town end
(great effects during sunrise or sunset) and, halfway across, the haloed
statue of St. John Nepomuk (1683), which honors the holy man tortured to
death by King Wenceslas IV and then tossed off the bridge. A bronze
Part IV: Central Europe 
372

plaque under the statue describes the event; rub the shiny, worn figure of
the plummeting saint for good luck.
Climb the towers at either end for great bridge and city spire panoramas.
Both are open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (sometimes hours change
Nov–Mar).
Prazsk; Hrad (Prague Castle)
Hradcany
Prague Castle, sternly overlooking Prague, is its own tiny city. Work began
in the ninth century and seems never to stop, with constant renovations
taking place. Massive fortifications enclose the castle, which spills over
with churches, palaces, buildings, shops, and alleys that take a full day to
explore properly. (You may be able to make a quick run-through in two to
three hours.) This is Prague’s only truly must-see sight. The massive cathe-
dral is one of Europe’s grandest Gothic churches.
Construction on St. Vitus Cathedral, the castle’s centerpiece, began under
Emperor Charles IV in 1344. After a long interruption, it was finished in the
19th and 20th centuries in a neo-Gothic style that tried to follow the orig-
inal plans closely. The mosaic over the door dates from 1370. The light-
filled interior of the cathedral contains the sumptuously decorated Chapel
of St. Wenceslas (built in the 14th–16th centuries). The sarcophagi of
Bohemian kings are stored in the crypt.
The Royal Palace was the home to kings for more than 700 years, begin-
ning in the ninth century. The vaulted Vladislav Hall is still used for state
occasions, such as the inauguration of the Czech president, but the Czechs
don’t celebrate like they used to. In the Middle Ages, knights on horseback
entered through the Rider’s Staircase for indoor jousting competitions.
St. George’s Basilica was built in the tenth century and is the oldest
Romanesque structure in Prague. Its adjacent convent houses a museum
of Gothic and baroque Bohemian art (% 257-531-644; www.ngprague.cz),
part of the National Gallery museums system and hence subject to a sep-
arate admission fee of 100Kc ($6.20) adults, 50Kc ($3.10) seniors and stu-
dents; it’s open Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The row of tiny houses clinging to the inside base of the castle ramparts
was known as Golden Lane, because they were once home to goldsmiths
and shopkeepers; today the area houses souvenir stands and cafes. Franz
Kafka worked, and perhaps lived, for a time at no. 22. Whether alchemists
practiced their craft of trying to turn lead into gold on this “golden” lane
is a point of debate. Some say yes, but others point to a similar lane off the
left flank of St. Vitus Cathedral as “Alchemy Central.”

Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 373

Staromestské námestí (Old Town Square)
Staré Mesto
A massive memorial to the 15th-century religious reformer and martyr Jan
Hus graces Prague’s most gorgeous baroque square, Staromestské.
Beautiful buildings surround the square, which is perpetually crowded
with street performers, tourists, and the general bustle of the city. Sit at an
outdoor cafe table, and just watch it all for a while.
You can climb the tower in the Old Town Hall (% 724-508-584) for views
across the rooftops, but its most popular feature is the Astronomical
Clock. Rather than tell the hour, this 15th-century timepiece keeps track
of moon phases, equinoxes, and various Christian holidays tied to them.
On every hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., the clock puts on a glockenspiel-style
show of marching apostles and dancing embodiments of evil.
Here’s a grisly tale for you: The architect of the clock, Master Hanus, did
such a good job that the city council feared he might one day build a better
one elsewhere. To ensure that their clock remained superior, they had him
blinded. As the legend goes, Master Hanus, in despair and hoping for
revenge, jumped into the clock’s mechanism, crushing himself and throw-
ing the works off-kilter for a century.
The Church of Our Lady Before T;n stands out with its twin multi-
steepled towers. The structure is mainly Gothic, dating from 1380, and is
the seat of Prague’s Protestant congregation.
See map p. 366. Staromestské námestí. Metro: A to Staromestská. Tram: 17, 18, 51, or
54. Bus: 135 or 207. Admission: Old Town Hall 60Kc ($3.70) adults, 40Kc ($2.50) seniors
and students; plus another 30Kc ($1.85) adults, 20Kc ($1.25) seniors or students to
climb the tower. Open: Old Town Hall Mar–Oct Mon 11 a.m.–6 p.m., Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–
6 p.m.; Nov–Feb Mon 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Sternbersk; palác (National Gallery at Sternberk Palace)
Hradcany
Prague’s main art gallery is housed in a gorgeous late-17th-century palace
near the Castle. The collection spans the 15th to 20th centuries, including
paintings by Rembrandt, Brueghel the Elder, Klee, and Munch. The finest
piece is Dürer’s huge Feast of the Rosary, painted in 1506.
See map p. 366. Hradcanské námestí 15 (across from the main entrance to Prague
Castle). % 233-090-570. www.ngprague.cz. Metro: A to Malostranská or
Hradcanská. Tram: 22 or 23. Admission: 130Kc ($8.05) adults, 80Kc ($4.95) students
and children. Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Strahovsk; Kláster (Strahov Monastery)
Malá Strana
Founded in 1140 by the Premonstratensian monks (an order that still lives
here), this monastery was rebuilt in the Gothic style of the 13th century.
It’s renowned for its libraries, both the collections — more than 125,000
volumes, many of them priceless illuminated manuscripts — and for the
Part IV: Central Europe 
374

long baroque hall that houses the philosophy and theology books. The
ceiling fresco of the Struggle of Mankind to Know Real Wisdom is not to be
missed. Also check out the baroque Church of Our Lady.

and under. Open: Daily 9 a.m. to noon and 1–5 p.m.
More cool things to see and do
 Going concert-hopping: Dozens of classical concerts are offered
every evening throughout town — in churches and concert halls, in
intimate private chambers and large public halls, under street arches,
and in the squares. Many estimate that more musicians per capita live
in the Czech Republic than anywhere else. The Prague Information
Service (see “Finding information after you arrive,” earlier in this
chapter) sells tickets at all its offices via the agency Ticketpro
(% 296-329-999; www.ticketpro.cz), or you can contact Bohemia
Ticket at Na Príkope 16 (% 224-215-031; www.bohemiaticket.cz).
In the city that gave the world the composers Smetana and Dvorák,
and where Mozart wrote Don Giovanni and found greater acclaim
than in his native Austria, you find a smorgasbord of offerings to
choose from: an organ concert in the T;n Church, a chamber
ensemble in a defunct monastery, or the Czech Philharmonic in 
the 19th-century D*m umelc* (Rudolfinum), Alsovo nábrezí 12 
(% 227-059-352; www.rudolfinum.cz).
The Prague Post lists most events around town, or you can just
wander the Old Town, especially around Staromestské Square,
where you find the highest concentration of posters proclaiming
the week’s concerts and venues. If it’s playing, attend Mozart’s 
Don Giovanni in the venue where it premiered, the restored 1783
Stavovské divadlo (Estates’ Theater), Ovocn; trh 1 (% 224-
902-322; www.nd.cz). This theater is the only baroque perform-
ance space preserved just as it appeared in Mozart’s day.
 Making friends in a beer hall: “Wherever beer is brewed, all is well.
Whenever beer is drunk, life is good.” So goes the Czech proverb.
Praguers love their pivo (beer) — they consume 320 pints per year
per Czech — and they love their local hospoda (pub or beer hall).
Beer halls serve as gathering places for almost everyone.
Refer to the “Dining in Prague” section, earlier in this chapter, for
information about the different types of Czech beer. Also note this
beer-hall etiquette:
• Share tables. Always ask Je tu volno (Is this spot taken)?
• Put a coaster in front of you if you want beer. Never wave
down the waiter — he’ll ignore you entirely.
• Nod at the waiter and hold up your fingers for how many
beers you want. He’ll leave a marked slip of paper at your
table with the drinks.
Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 375

The waiter visits you twice (at the most), so when he comes
around again, order all the beer you’ll want for the rest of your stay.
Pay him when he drops off your drinks, or you may have to wait for
hours.
Check out the famous beer hall, U Flek*, Kremencova 11 (% 224-
934-019; www.ufleku.cz), a brewery from 1459 — rather touristy,
but great brewskis, plus there’s a cheesy-but-fun brass band in the
courtyard garden. Or go to the 1466 U Medvídk*, na Perst;ne 7 
(% 224-211-916; www.umedvidku.cz), for real Budvar on tap and
good Czech pub grub. For a real, albeit famous, Praguer’s bar, hit 
U Zlatého tygra, Husova 17 (% 222-221-111), a smoky haunt of
writers and politicians.
 Visiting a park along the river: Letná Park (Letenské sady) is a
wide, flat swath of trees and shrubs on the western bank of the
Vltava River, north of Malá Strana. It has plenty of picnic spots, lots
of paths winding through the trees and along the river, and even a
beer garden in summer on the park’s north side. Walk along the
river tossing bread to, and making friends with, Prague’s famed
mute swans. Tram nos. 1, 8, 25, and 26 get you there.
 Renting a paddle boat: The Vltava is a beautiful river, filled with
graceful swans and spanned by dramatic bridges. You may feel
compelled to become a part of it — but don’t. It’s so polluted that
swimming is out of the question. From March through September,
you can rent paddle boats (80Kc/$4.95 per hour) and rowboats
(60Kc/$3.70 per hour) from P*jcovna at the docks of Slovansk;
ostrov, an island 2 blocks south of the National Theater.
Next door, at Rent-A-Boat “Slovanka,” you can rent a rowboat with
a lantern at the bow in the evenings (until 11 p.m.) and row around
the river under the romantic moonlight and floodlit spires of the
city. This boat costs you 80Kc ($4.95) per hour. Rent-A-Boat also
stays open until October (Nov if the weather holds).
Guided tours
Plenty of outfits run bus tours of the city. Try these for the best reputa-
tion and prices:
 Martin Tour (% 224-212-473; www.martintour.cz) runs a variety
of city tours (general, Jewish Prague, historical, river cruises) last-
ing from 75 minutes to three-and-a-half hours. Tours cost from
250Kc to 750Kc ($16–$47). You can hop on at Staromestské námestí,
Námestí Republiky, Melantrichova, or Na Príkope.
 Premiant City Tour (% 606-600-123 or 224-946-922; www.premiant.
cz) also runs city intro, historical/Jewish Prague, and river cruises
lasting two to three-and-a-half hours. The cost is 250Kc to 850Kc
($16–$53). Hour-long bus tours cost 250Kc ($16). All tours leave from
Na Príkope 23.
Part IV: Central Europe 
376

If you’re interested in a walking tour, try Prague Airport Transfers
(% 222-554-211 or 777-777-237; www.prague-airport-transfers.
co.uk). Tours meet under the Astronomical Clock on Staromestské
námestí (look for the person with the ID badge holding a red umbrella).
Most tours — Prague Castle and the Royal Route (daily 11 a.m.), Old
Jewish Quarter (daily 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.), Undiscovered Prague 
(Mon, Wed, Fri, Sun 11 a.m.), Old Prague — 1,000 years of architecture
(Tues, Thurs, Sat 11 a.m.), and the Ghost Walk (Tues, Thurs, Sat 
6:30 p.m.) — last about 90 minutes to two hours each and cost 300Kc to
400Kc ($19–$25). The Superior Tour of Prague includes lunch, drinks, a
boat cruise, a tram ride, and a Walks of Prague CD (daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.)
and costs 1,000Kc ($62).
Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, read this sec-
tion for tips on building your own Prague itineraries.
If you have one day
Spend a full morning exploring Prazsk; Hrad (Prague Castle) — the
Cathedral, the Royal Palace, St. George’s Basilica, and other sights
nearby. Make your way down to the river, grab an eat-as-you-go lunch
along the way, and cross the remarkable Karl*v most (Charles Bridge)
into the Staré Mesto (Old Town). Take your first left to walk up into
Josefov, and spend the afternoon in the museums, synagogues, and
cemetery of the Jewish quarter.
When evening falls, make your way to the lovely heart of Prague, the
baroque building–lined square Staromestské nám, where dozens of bill-
boards, posters, and ticket hawkers allow you to browse for the best
classical concert to suit your tastes. If you don’t want to leave things to
chance, stop by a Prague Information Service (PIS) office (see “Finding
information after you arrive,” earlier in this chapter) when you get to
town and book tickets in the morning — the best concerts do sometimes
sell out. If it’s summer, you can pick up tickets when you’re crossing the
Charles Bridge around lunchtime — a PIS office/ticket booking center is
in the base of the tower at the Malá Strana end of the bridge.
If you have two days
Spend all of Day 1 in the Malá Strana. Start off at Prazsk; Hrad, but take
a bit more time after seeing the big sights to enjoy some of the tempo-
rary exhibits that rotate through its galleries and halls. Pop into
Sternbersk; palác (National Gallery at Sternberk Palace) afterward for a
dip into Renaissance and baroque art. Then make your way down to
Malostranské nám, exit it on Karmelitská street, and take the first left
down Prokopská, which becomes Nebovidská, to have a Czech lunch at
U Modré Kachnicky.
Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 377

After lunch, continue down Nebovidská to Hellichova, take a right, cross
Karmelitská, and wind your way up through the Seminárská Zahrada
(Seminary Gardens) to the library and frescoes inside the Strahovsk;
Kláster (Strahov Monastery) at the western edge of the gardens. Hop on
tram no. 22 and ride it all the way around to the back side of Prague
Castle to Malostranské námestí again, where you can get off and mosey
on down to Karl*v most, crossing back into the Staré Mesto to rustle up
some dinner and a concert.
Start off Day 2 in Josefov, exploring the sights, synagogues, and culture
of Jewish Prague. If Prague’s Jewish history intrigues you, leave early
enough (by 1 p.m.) to get to Florenc station and grab a bus for the hour’s
ride outside town to the Nazi internment camp at Terezín (see “Traveling
beyond Prague,” later in this chapter). If you’ve had your fill at Josefov,
spend your afternoon wandering the Staré Mesto, popping into its baroque
churches, relaxing with the locals in Staromestské námestí, and browsing
for the evening’s concert. Dine at U trech modr;ch koulí, or just get
some goulash at a pub.
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as outlined in the preceding section, and on Day
3 head out to imposing Karlstejn Castle. If you plan to visit Terezín, defi-
nitely do it on the afternoon of Day 2, because on Day 3, you want to be
back in Prague early enough to engage in a rewarding wander around the
Staré Mesto in the late afternoon. (Be sure to catch the sunset over the
Karl*v most.)
Traveling beyond Prague
Several fascinating destinations lie just a short bus or train ride from the
city center. You can explore a 14th-century castle and a “model” Nazi
internment camp that was designed to mask Hitler’s true motives.
Medieval Karlstejn Castle
This highly picturesque, 14th-century castle perched scenically above
the river is Prague’s most popular day trip. (Tour companies love
coming here, where more than 350,000 people visit annually.)
It takes only a few hours to get here, see the castle, and return to Prague,
but you can stick around for lunch and enjoy Karlstejn’s small-town set-
ting. (But be aware that it’s usually quite crowded.)
Getting there
You can get to the castle by train in about 45 minutes. The trains leave
from Prague’s Smíchov Station (take Metro line B to Smíchovské nádrazí).
Martin Tour (% 224-212-473; www.martintour.cz) does five-hour trips
to Karlstejn Castle Tuesday through Sunday for 950Kc ($59), leaving at

Day Trips from Prague
Chapter 18: Prague and Environs 379
10 a.m. and including lunch; Premiant City Tour (% 606-600-123 or
224-241-072; www.premiant.cz) does it in four hours Tuesday through
Sunday (at 9 a.m., including lunch) for 990Kc ($61). From April through
September, you may want to ride instead with Central European
Adventures (% 222-328-879; http://cea51.tripod.com), whose
680Kc ($42) price includes transportation from Prague (8:30 a.m. at the
Astronomical Clock) to the castle, a guide, plus a 29km (18-mile) round-
trip bike excursion to a nearby cave — but not castle admission. (All
tours run Tues–Sun only.)
This is a one-trick town, so you won’t find a tourism office; just hike up
to the castle and the admissions office for information.
Seeing the castle
The walk uphill to Karlstejn Castle (% 311-681-370; www.hrad
karlstejn.cz) from the train station is a rigorous mile, but the view
from the castle across the fertile river valley makes the climb worth it.

(Unfortunately, no buses are available for those who can’t manage the
walk.) Charles IV built the fortress (between 1348 and 1357) to protect
the crown jewels, which have been moved.
A 19th-century restoration stripped the place of later additions and rebuilt
the castle in line with how folks from the Romantic era thought a medieval
castle should look (close to the original, but a bit fanciful in places). You
can get inside only by guided tour, which takes you through parts of the
South Palace to see the Audience Hall and Imperial Bedroom — both
impressive in an austere, medieval way.
The castle’s most spectacular room, the famed Holy Rood Chapel with its
ceiling of glass “stars,” is only visible on the longer version of the tour —
and because that is limited to 12 visitors per hour, it’s worth calling ahead
to reserve (% 274-008-154) and paying the 40Kc ($2.50) booking fee.
Admission for a 50-minute tour is 220Kc ($14) adults and 120Kc ($7.45)
students; a 70-minute tour is 300Kc ($19) adults, 150Kc ($9.30) students.
The castle is open Tuesday through Sunday, in May, June, and September
from 9 a.m. to noon and 12:30 to 5 p.m.; July and August from 9 a.m. to
noon and 12:30 to 6 p.m.; April and October from 9 a.m. to noon and 
1 to 4 p.m.; and November, December and March from 9 a.m. to noon 
and 1 to 3 p.m. (closed Jan and Feb).
Where to dine
The main road leading up to the castle is littered with souvenir shops
and restaurants. The best food is at Restaurace Blanky z Valois, a cozy
place serving good Czech food with a French twist.
The Nazi camp at Terezín
Terezín was built as a city/fortress in the 19th century. The Nazi camp
here served mainly as a transfer station in the despicable traffic of
human cargo — sending Jews, homosexuals, Gypsies, and political dissi-
dents on to other, more deadly destinations. At least half of the 140,000
people who passed through Terezín ended up in the death mills of
Auschwitz and Treblinka.
Terezín’s infamy is that it was the site of one of the most effective public-
relations deceptions perpetrated by SS leader Heinrich Himmler. In 1944,
the Nazis allowed three Red Cross workers to visit the camp to see
whether the horrible rumors about SS methods were true. Instead, they
found a self-governed modern ghetto with children studying at school,
stores stocked with goods, internees apparently healthy — and none of
the overcrowding that they had suspected. The Red Cross had no idea
that all this was elaborately staged.
Getting there
Terezín is an hour’s bus ride from Florenc station. You need a full morn-
ing to fully explore the camp. Wittmann Tours, Mánesova 8, Praha 2 
Part IV: Central Europe 
380

(% 222-252-472; www.wittmann-tours.com), has by far the best
Terezín tour available; all guides are either survivors of the camp or
experts on it. This seven-hour tour leaves Prague at 10 a.m. (May–Oct
daily; Mar 15–Apr and Nov–Dec Tues, Thurs, Sat, and Sun), includes
lunch, and costs 1,150Kc ($71) adults, 1,000Kc ($62) students. Martin
Tour (% 224-212-473; www.martintour.cz) tours Terezín in five hours
and costs 1,100Kc ($68); Premiant City Tour’s (% 606-600-123 or
224-241-072; www.premiant.cz) visit also lasts five hours and costs
1,150Kc ($71).
The information office (% 416-782-225; www.pamatnik-terezin.cz)
is on the town’s main square, Námestí cs, Armády 84.
Seeing the camp
The Main Fortress (Hlavní Pevnost) houses a Ghetto Museum, detailing
life in this camp and the rise of Nazism. The museum is open daily from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 5:30 p.m. in winter). The prison barracks, execu-
tion grounds, and isolation cells are in the Lesser Fortress, a ten-minute
walk away, open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 4:30 p.m. in winter). In
front is the Jewish Cemetery, where bodies exhumed from Nazi mass
graves were properly reburied. The cemetery is open Sunday through
Friday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 4 p.m. in winter). The Magdeburg
Barracks re-create a Ghetto dormitory. Here you see displays on Ghetto
art and music. The barracks is open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until
5:30 p.m. in winter).
Admission to either the Ghetto Museum or the Lesser Fortress alone is
160Kc ($9.90) adults, 130Kc ($8.05) children. A combined ticket for all
attractions costs 200Kc ($12) adults, 150Kc ($9.30) children.
Where to dine
As you may expect, Terezín doesn’t offer many places to eat. However, in
the main parking lot you can buy snacks and drinks at a small stand.
Inside the Main Fortress, near the museum, is a decent, inexpensive
restaurant with Czech fare.
Fast Facts: Prague

American Express
Prague has two American Express offices.
The main one is at Václavské námestí 56,
Praha 1 (% 222-800-237), and is open daily
from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. There’s another office
at Staromestské námestí 5 (% 224-818-388),
open daily from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Area Code
The country code for the Czech Republic is
420. Prague no longer has a separate city
code. Instead, old numbers have had the
former city code (2) grafted onto the front of
them — if you see any number in outdated
literature presented as “02-213 . . .” just
drop the 0. In other words, to call Prague
from the United States, dial 011-420 fol-
lowed by the number.

Currency
The Czech unit of currency is called the
koruna (Kc) and is divided into 100 hellers.
Roughly, $1 equals 16Kc, or 10Kcequals
62¢. Czech coins include 50 hellers and 1, 2,
5, 10, 20, and 50 koruna. Bills come in
denominations of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000,
2,000, and 5,000 koruna.
Doctors and Dentists
Unicare Medical Center, Na dlouhém lánu
11 (% 235-356-553, or 608-103-050 after
hours; www.unicare.cz), has physicians
in most specialties, as well as dentists;
open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
Saturday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. See also “Hospitals,”
later in this section.
Embassies and Consulates
The consulate services of the U.S. Embassy,
Trziste15, Praha 1 (% 257-022-000;
www.usembassy.cz), are open daily from
9 a.m. to noon. The Canadian Embassy,
Muchova 6, Praha 6 (% 272-101-800), is open
Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
and 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. The U.K. Embassy,
Thunovská 14, Praha 1 (% 257-402-111), is
open Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 
12:30 p.m. and 1:30 to 5 p.m. You can visit the
Australian Honorary Consul, Klimentská 10,
Praha 1 (% 296-578-350) Monday to Friday
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. The Irish
Embassy is at Trziste13, Praha 1 (% 257-
530-061), and is open Monday to Friday 
from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. The 
New Zealand Honorary Consul is located at
Dykova 19, Praha 10 (% 222-514-672), and
visits here are by appointment.
Emergency
In a general emergency, dial % 112. Dial
% 158 to call the police, or % 150 to report
a fire. For an ambulance, call % 155.
Hospitals
In a medical emergency, head to Motol
Hospital’s 24-hour Center for Foreigners, 
V Úvalu 84 (% 224-433-681). If it’s between
7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., try the Foreigner’s
Medical Clinic at Na Homolce Hospital,
Roentgenova 2, Praha 5 (% 257-272-174;
www.homolka.cz).
Information
Prague Information Service (PIS), at
Staromestské námestí 1 (% 12-444;
www.pis.cz), is one of the information
offices in town. For specifics on it, and on
other offices, see “Finding information after
you arrive,” near the beginning of this
chapter.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Bohemia Bagel, Masná 2 (% 224-811-560;
www.bohemiabagel.cz) has dozens of
terminals open Monday through Friday 
7 a.m. to midnight, Saturday and Sunday 
8 a.m. to midnight — plus, great bagels. To
surf for free (three computers; no time limit;
long waits) or get your Wi-Fi on, head to the
pubby restaurant Jáma, V jáme7 (% 224-
222-383; www.jamapub.cz).
Maps
The maps printed in some of the tourist-
office handouts aren’t bad, but you really
should pick up a better one at a newsstand
or bookstore.
Newspapers and Magazines
Newsstands carry an English-language
weekly newspaper, The Prague Post
(www.praguepost.com), packed with
useful information and events calendars.
You can also pick up Culture in Prague, a
monthly bilingual events calendar.
Pharmacies
A Czech pharmacy is called a lékárna.
Several pharmacies remain open 24 hours 
a day, including Palackého 5, Praha 1 
(% 224-946-982), and Lékárna U Andela,
Stefánikova 6, Praha 5 (% 257-320-918).
Part IV: Central Europe 
382

Police
Dial % 158 to call the police.
Post Office
The main post office is at Jindrisská, just off
Václavské námestí (% 221-131-111;
www.cpost.cz), open 24 hours.
Safety
Walking or taking the Metro or trams alone
at night is safe, but always be on the look-
out for pickpockets, especially on Charles
Bridge, around parts of Old Town, and on
public transportation. Václavské námestí
(Wenceslas Square) is a little seedy during
the day and is traveled mainly by prostitutes
at night.
Taxes
A 19 percent value-added tax (VAT) is built
into the price of most goods and services.
You can get a refund on the VAT as long as
you spend more than 2,000Kc($124) in a
single shop (see Chapter 4).
Taxis
See “Getting Around Prague,” earlier in this
chapter.
Telephone
A local call in Prague costs at least 4Kc
(25¢) for 104 seconds of local time or 
35 seconds of long distance (longer after 
7 p.m.). Pay phones accept either coins or
phone cards, sold at post offices, tobac-
conists, or newsstands in denominations
ranging from 150Kcto 500Kc($9.30–$31).
Coin-operated phones do not make change,
so insert money as needed, but use smaller
coins. Here’s something to confuse you: A
Czech dial tone sounds like a busy signal in
the United States; the Czech busy signal
sounds like a U.S. dial tone. For Czech
directory assistance, call % 1180; for inter-
national directory assistance, dial % 1181.
To dial direct internationally, press 052, the
country code, and the number.
To charge a call to your calling card, dial
AT&T (% 00-800-222-55288) or MCI 
(% 00-800-001-112; not accessible from
cellphones). To call the United States direct
from Prague, dial 001 followed by the area
code and number.
Transit Info
Call % 221-111-122 for train info, or go
online to the Czech Railways site at www.
cdrail.cz or see the timetable at
www.vlak.cz. For intercity buses, call 
% 900-149-144 or go to www.vlak-bus.
cz. For the city transport system, call 
% 296-191-817 or go to www.dpp.cz.

Mediterranean
Europe

In this part . . .
A
h, bright and sunny Mediterranean Europe. You can
enjoy winding coastal drives and long moonlit dinners,
gemlike islands and afternoon siestas, and ripe olives and ﬁne
wine. The Mediterranean life runs at a slower pace and is
more laid-back than that of Northern and Central Europe.
Here you can discover the ruins of ancient Greece and Rome.
But a few dusty rocks and chipped columns do not make a
Western civilization. We also guide you to the treasures —
masterpieces by Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello, da Vinci,
Botticelli, and many, many others — that ﬁll the museums
and churches of Rome, Florence, and Venice.
From there, you head to Spain. Madrid boasts its own share
of artistic treasures, but excursions to Toledo and Segovia
give you a taste of the country’s stunning landscape.
Barcelona awaits with its distinctively whimsical architecture
and vibrant, happening nightlife. And ﬁnally, it’s off to the his-
tory surrounding Athens and the warm simplicity and sun-
shine of Santoríni in the Greek Islands.

Chapter 19
Rome and Southern Italy
In This Chapter
 Getting to Rome
 Checking out the neighborhoods
 Discovering the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions
 Side-tripping to Naples, Herculaneum, and Pompeii
T
he Eternal City’s 2,000-year-old ruins — including major sights such as
the Roman Forum, the Pantheon, and, of course, the Colosseum — hint
at Rome’s glorious past. But Rome didn’t stop there: Medieval buildings are
rare because they’ve been swept away by the blooming Renaissance, fol-
lowed by the bursting baroque, which turned churches and palazzi into
magnificent museums filled to the brim with the greatest art by the 
greatest artistic masters — Michelangelo, Raphael, Borromini, Bernini,
Botticelli, and Caravaggio. Modern Rome hasn’t sat on its laurels, and this
bustling city is rich in cultural and artistic events, as well as simpler joys: 
a morning cappuccino, a deliciously hearty meal.
Rome is also the gate to southern Italy: the bay of Naples, beloved by
ancient Romans, welcomes visitors with its riches. Thanks to high-speed
trains, you can now visit Naples, Pompeii, or Herculaneum as a day trip
from the capital.
As one saying goes, it would take a lifetime to see all of Rome, but you
can get a good sampling of its wonderful flavors in three or four days.
Because you won’t see everything before you depart, be sure to toss a
coin into the Trevi Fountain — legend has it that, if you do, you’re des-
tined to return someday.
Getting There
Rome is a perennially popular destination, with plenty of flights available
on a wide variety of international airlines, and trains from all over Europe.
Arriving by air
Most international flights land at Leonardo da Vinci International
Airport, also called Fiumicino (% 06-65951; www.adr.it), 29km 
(18 miles) west of the city. The airport is compact, with three terminals

connected by a long corridor, with departures on one level and arrivals
below. There you’ll find ATMs (one per terminal), as well as 24-hour 
currency-exchange machines, a cambio (change) office (open 8:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m.), a tourist info point, and a help desk for last-minute hotel
reservations. Public transportation — including taxis, and car-rental
shuttle buses — is outside along the sidewalk. The flat rate to hotels in
the historic district is 40 ($64) with a Rome-licensed taxi. (At press
time, Fiumicino-licensed taxis were still charging 60/$96, a quirk that
the administration was working to resolve.) The ride will take between
40 minutes with no traffic, to well over an hour at rush hours.
Beware of Gypsy cabdrivers who approach you as you exit the arrival
gate: They’ll easily charge you double the regulated cab rates. Regulation
taxis are white with a checkered line on the sides, have a meter and a city
license inside, and wait at the regular stand.
The train station is on the second floor of a building attached to the ter-
minal; follow the TRENI signs. You can buy tickets there from the ticket
booth, the tobacconist store, and from vending machines for the
Leonardo Express, a first-class-only express to the main rail station,
Stazione Termini (30 minutes; 9.50/$15). You can also take a local train
every 20 minutes to the Tiburtina or Ostiense rail stations (final destina-
tion marked ORTE or FARA SABINA; 45 minutes; 5/$8) from the same
tracks. The local train fare is included in transportation passes (see
“Getting Around Rome,” later in this chapter).
Many charter and continental flights land at the smaller Ciampino
Airport (% 06-7934-0297 or 06-794-941), 16km (10 miles) south of the
city. Taxis are by far the easiest way to get to town from Ciampino. The
flat rate to Rome’s central hotels is 30 ($48) for the 45-minute trip. You
can also take a shuttle bus: Terravision (% 06-7949-4572; www.terra
vision.it) and Schiaffini (% 06-713-0531; www.schiaffini.com) run
a shuttle service to Termini station for 8 ($13).
Arriving by rail
Trenitalia, the national train service (% 892-021; www.trenitalia.it),
offers cheap, reliable, and frequent service to Rome from every domes-
tic and international destination. The majority of trains headed for Rome
stop at Termini, the main station on Piazza dei Cinquecento (% 800-
431784; www.romatermini.it). A few long-haul trains may stop only at
the Tiburtina station northeast of the center; you’ll find all kinds of
public transportation at either station.
Finding information after you arrive
Rome has established about a dozen tourist info points near popular
sights. See “Information” under “Fast Facts: Rome” at the end of this
chapter for addresses.

Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 389
Getting Around Rome
Although there is much you can do on foot, Rome is quite vast — it’s
Italy’s largest city — and finding your way even just within the historic
district can be a tad complicated. Using a good map will help you figure
out the lay of the land (see “Maps” under “Fast Facts: Rome” at the end
of this chapter).

By taxi
Taxi rates are reasonable in Rome. The meter starts at 2.33 ($3.75) and
adds 0.78 ($1.25) for every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if you’re moving at up to
20kmph (12 mph); for every 141m (462 ft.) if you’re going faster; and for
every 19.2 seconds if you’re stuck in traffic. The night surcharge is 2.58
($4.15), and the Sundays and holiday one is 1.03 ($1.65). Radio taxi
calls have a surcharge of between 2 and 6 ($3.20–$9.60), depending
on the distance from the call center. Taxi rides originating from Termini
train station apply a surcharge of 2 ($3.20). They’re a great resource for
getting to your hotel from the train station and traveling around at night,
after the buses and Metro stop running.
Taxis in Italy don’t cruise, so you usually can’t hail a taxi on the street
unless you happen to find one that’s returning to a stand. If you need a
taxi, call % 06-88177, 06-6645, 06-4994, or 06-5551 for radio taxi service,
or walk to one of the many stations scattered around town at major
squares and stations.
By subway, tram, and bus
You purchase a 1 ($1.60) biglietto (ticket) to ride any public transporta-
tion within Rome. Tickets are good for 75 minutes, during which you
may board the Metro system one time and transfer buses as frequently
as you need — just stamp your ticket on the first bus and the final bus.
You can also buy daily (4/$6.40), three-day (11/$18), or weekly
(16/$26) passes. Look for passes and tickets at tabacchi (tobacconist
shops indicated by a brown-and-white T sign), Metro stations, news-
stands, and machines near major bus stops. Keep your ticket with you
as you travel in order to avoid paying a fine.
Because of Rome’s rich ancient heritage, its Metro system is small and
not especially developed (it seems that whenever the city attempts to
add a new leg to the subway, it encounters ruins that archaeologists
must examine). The Metro’s two lines, the orange A line and the blue B
line, intersect at Termini.
The Colosseum, Circus Maximus, and Cavour stops on the B line don’t
offer full elevator/lift service and aren’t accessible for people with 
disabilities.
Thankfully, Rome has a much more developed bus and tram system; still
they’re very crowded at rush hour, and traffic jams are endemic. The lines
you’ll use the most are the diminutive electric buses that ride in the tiny,
narrow streets of the historical district (116 and 116T from the Gianicolo
hill to Villa Borghese; 117 from Piazza del Popolo to San Giovanni in
Laterano; 118 from Piazzale Ostiense to Appia Antica; and 119 from Piazza
del Popolo to Largo Argentina), as well as 23 (Prati to Aventino), 62
(Castel Sant’Angelo to Repubblica), 64 (Termini to Vatican), 87 (Prati to
Colosseum), 492 (Tiburtina railroad station to Vatican Museums), and 910
(Termini to Villa Borghese). Rome also has a few tram lines; they aren’t as
spectacular as the cable cars in San Francisco, but they’re fun to ride; 
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
390

8 goes from Largo Argentina to Trastevere, and 3 passes by the Basilica di
San Giovanni and the Colosseum. Most buses run daily from 5:30 a.m. to
12:30 a.m., but some stop at 8.30 p.m. After-hours, night lines marked with
an N run hourly, leaving the ends of the line on the hour. For bus informa-
tion, call % 800-431784 or visit www.atac.roma.it.
Staying in Rome
Finding a hotel in Rome has become easier than ever: Many hotels have
been recently refurbished, several new ones have opened, and hundreds
of B&Bs have appeared. On the less bright side, prices have risen
sharply in recent years. Off-season has shrunk to a few weeks in January,
February, August, and November. The best way to get a deal is to plan in
advance; see Chapter 7 for money-saving tips on booking your accom-
modations, and on what to expect from your hotel: globalization may be
here as everywhere, but cultural differences remain alive and well.
If you arrive without a room reservation (something that’s not advis-
able), you’ll find a help desk for last-minute hotel reservations at the air-
port and one at Termini station.

Pantheon
This elegant hotel has an ideal location across from the Pantheon. Guest
rooms are spacious — the suites are palatial — and beautifully furnished,
with antiques and quality reproductions, marble-top tables, and hardwood
floors. The marble bathrooms are huge (for Rome) and nicely appointed.
The terrace has a spectacular view and is perfect for enjoying Rome’s sun-
sets. It has been recently wired for Wi-Fi Internet connection.

Aventino
We love this hotel located in our favorite area of Rome, convenient to most

surrounded by its own garden. Guest rooms are moderate in size but not
cramped, and pleasantly decorated with ornate period furniture, elegant
fabrics, and beautiful wooden floors. Bathrooms are not large, but they’re
modern and with functional showers.

Hotel Hassler
$$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
If money is no object, this luxury hotel is the place to be in Rome, with its
fantastic location up the Spanish Steps and its sophisticated elegance.
The basic double rooms are not as opulent and spacious as their deluxe
doubles, which are basically junior suites, but you enjoy the same top
amenities (including a state-of-the-art health center and free bicycles to
take to nearby Villa Borghese). Furnishings are classic or modern, with
extra-comfortable beds, carpeted floors, and luxury fabrics and linens.
Bathrooms are wonderful, marble-clad retreats. We highly recommend the
hotel’s restaurant Imàgo with splendid views of Rome.
See map p. 392. Piazza Trinita dei Monti 6. % 06-699340. Fax: 06-678-9991. www.
hotelhasslerroma.com. Metro: Barberini, and then take Via Sistina downhill to
your right and walk all the way to the end. Rack rates: 660–935 ($1,056–$1,496)
double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Teatro di Pompeo
$$
Campo de’ Fiori
Located in the lively and historic neighborhood by Campo de’ Fiori, this is
a good, moderately priced choice with plenty of charm. The name of the
hotel refers to the ancient Roman theater, dating from 55 B.C., that lies
beneath the hotel — some of its structure can still be seen in the breakfast
room. The rest of the building is much newer — that is, from the 15th 
century — as you see by the beamed ceilings in some of the rooms. The
rooms are spacious for this ancient area of Rome, and the white plaster
walls, hardwood floors, and simple furnishings give it an old-fashioned
charm. The tiled bathrooms are small but with new fixtures. Three more
rooms are in a nearby annex, on the third floor with no elevator.
See map p. 392. Largo del Pallaro 8. % 06-6830-0170. Fax: 06-6880-5531. www.hotel
teatrodipompeo.it. Bus: 64 to Sant’Andrea della Valle, and then walk east on
Via dei Chiavari and turn right. Rack rates: 210 ($336) double. Rates include buffet
breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Rose Garden Palace
$$$$
Via Veneto
In the exclusive area around Via Veneto, this is a new hotel housed in a
Liberty (Italian Art Nouveau) building from the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury. The eponymous rose garden is a lovely inner garden, perfect for a
private stroll. Charm isn’t the only thing you’ll find here, however; the
amenities are top notch. The marble bathrooms have both showers and
bathtubs; the rooms themselves are large; and the entire hotel is furnished
with very sleek yet inviting modern décor. A new health club and even a
swimming pool are on-site. Check their special Internet rates.
See map p. 392. Via Boncompagni 19. % 06-421741. Fax: 06-481-5608. www.

1 block. Rack rates: 385–440 ($616–$704) double. Rates include buffet breakfast.

Rome’s runner-up accommodations
Bernini Bristol
$$$$
Via Veneto
One of the best hotels in Rome, particularly for its great
position — just at the foot of Via Veneto — it offers impeccable service at
(relatively) moderate rates. Guest rooms are elegant, some in classical and
others in modern luxury style; all have beautiful marble bathrooms. The
best rooms open onto great views over Rome. From the splendid rooftop
restaurant, the Olympus, you can enjoy a 360-degree view over Rome. See
map p. 392. Piazza Barberini 23. % 06-488931. www.berninibristol.com.
Casa Kolbe
$
Near the Forum
If you love archaeology and don’t need too many
amenities, this monastically quiet converted convent may be perfect. On
the little-traveled side street hugging the west flank of the Palatine Hill, it
offers roomy, basic, institutional rooms. See map p. 392. Via S. Teodoro 44. 
% 06-679-4974.
Hotel Capo d’Africa
$$$
Colosseo
This elegant new hotel is located on an atmospheric
street between the Colosseum and San Giovanni, close to most of the
sights of ancient Rome. Known for its excellent service, it offers comfort-
able rooms furnished in a warm, modern-ethnic style. The marble bath-
rooms are good size and nicely outfitted. See map p. 392. Via Capo d’Africa 54.
% 06-772801. www.hotelcapodafrica.com.
Hotel Columbus
$$$
Near the Vatican
Michelangelo’s patron, Pope Julius II, once owned
this lovely 15th-century palazzo — located just blocks from the entrance
to St. Peter’s — and certainly the place feels like a Renaissance castle, com-
plete with oil paintings and tapestries. Guest rooms are fairly simple yet
comfortable. The good restaurant opens into the wonderful garden court-
yard for good weather. See map p. 392. Via della Conciliazione 33. % 06-686-5435.
www.hotelcolumbus.net.
Hotel Parlamento
$$
Pantheon
Steps from Piazza di Spagna, Trevi Fountain, and the
Pantheon, this hotel occupies the third and forth floors of a 15th-century
building and offers good accommodations at excellent prices. Rooms are
bright and spacious, with tiled floors; large beds; and comfortable bath-
rooms, some of them with tubs. Weather permitting, breakfast is served
on the pleasant roof terrace. Air-conditioning is an extra charge of 12
($19) per day (to be booked at the time of your reservation). See map

Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 395

Dining in Rome
Typically, a complete meal in Rome is a multicourse affair that could last
for hours; in today’s faster-paced world, however, this happens less fre-
quently, especially at lunch. Rome offers a great choice, from down-to-
earth trattorie and osterie preparing excellent traditional Roman fare to
elegant restaurants that count among the best in the country. Restaurants
crowd the historical center, with the highest concentration in the area
around Campo de’ Fiori, in Trastevere, and in the Navona/Pantheon and
Trevi areas, in that order.
Traditional Roman cuisine is based on simple food, “poor people fare.” It
may be unsophisticated, but it’s quite good. Among the primi (first
courses), favorite Roman specialties include pasta all’amatriciana (a
tomato-and-bacon sauce with pecorino cheese), and its tomatoless ver-
sion called gricia; pasta all’arrabbiata (tomato sauce with bacon and lots
of hot red pepper); gnocchi (potato dumplings in a tomato-based sauce —
note that these are traditionally served on Thurs only); cannelloni (pasta
tubes filled with meat or fish and baked); and ricotta and spinach ravioli.
Among favorite secondi (main courses) are abbacchio (young lamb) —
roasted with herbs or scottadito (small grilled cutlets) — and saltimbocca
alla romana (veal or beef, stuffed with ham and sage and sautéed in a
Marsala sauce). For the more adventurous, there is trippa alla romana
(tripe Roman style). Desserts are few, mostly gelato (rich, creamy ice
cream), creamy zabaglione (made with sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala
wine), or tiramisu (layers of mascarpone cheese and espresso-soaked
ladyfingers).
The best-known wines of Rome come from the nearby Castelli Romani, 
the hill towns to the east of the city. Worth trying are the white Frascati —
very dry and treacherously refreshing — and the red Velletri.

Trastevere
ROMAN/SEAFOOD
This restaurant will satisfy both gourmets looking for creative dishes and
those after traditional Roman cuisine. The chef claims to have invented
the crudo (“raw” — as in raw fish) Italian style, and keeps researching new
flavors: The ever-changing menu may list millefoglie con mousse di dentice
in salsa al vino bianco (napoleon with local fish mousse in white-wine
sauce) or his revisitation of the classic zuppa di fagioli e frutti di mare
(bean and seafood stew). The tasting menus range from Roman tradition
(50/$80) to the chef’s grand cuisine (84/$134).
See map p. 392. Piazza San Cosimato 40. % 06-581-8668. Reservations recom-
mended. Tram: 8. Main courses: 18–31 ($29–$50). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat
8:30 p.m.–12:30 a.m. Closed 10 days in Jan and 10 days in Aug.

Angelino ai Fori
$$
Colosseo
ROMAN/SEAFOOD/PIZZA
A local favorite, this is another stronghold of Roman cuisine, which may
appear like a tourist trap because of its perfect location across from the
Roman Forum but is actually an authentic traditional restaurant. Highly rec-
ommended are bucatini all’amatriciana, saltimbocca alla romana (sautéed
veal with ham and sage), and — when on the menu — pollo alla Romana
(chicken stewed with red and yellow peppers). It also serves nice fish dishes
that vary with market offerings (check its display by the entrance door).
The terrace is a great plus in the good season, but service may get slow.
See map p. 392. Largo Corrado Ricci 40. % 06-679-1121. Reservations recommended.
Metro: Colosseo. Main courses: 7–18 ($11–$29). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Wed–Mon
noon to 3:15 p.m. and 7–11 p.m. Closed Jan.
Bolognese
$$$
Piazza del Popolo
BOLOGNESE
Elegant and hip, this restaurant serves well-prepared food at moderate
prices in a nicely appointed dining room or, in good weather, on the out-
door terrace. Even Romans admit that Bologna has produced some good
dishes, like the lasagna prepared so well here. The tagliatelle alla Bolognese
(homemade pasta with tomato and meat sauce) and the fritto di verdure e
agnello (tempura of vegetables and lamb tidbits) are mouthwatering. End
with something from the unusually large selection of delicious desserts.
See map p. 392. Piazza del Popolo 1. % 06-361-1426. Reservations required. Bus: 117
or 119. Main courses: 14–29 ($22–$46). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily Tues–Sun
12:30–3 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. to midnight. Closed 3 weeks in Aug.

Trastevere
ROMAN
This traditional trattoria is still faithful to the old Italian-cuisine values of
fresh ingredients and professional service. It even prepares the fish for you
at your table. The bombolotti all’amatriciana is excellent, as are the abbac-
chi scottadito (grilled lamb chops) and the coda alla vaccinara (oxtail stew).
Homemade desserts round out the menu nicely.
See map p. 392. Via Benedetta 10, near Piazza Trilussa. % 06-580-0985. Reservations
recommended. Bus: 23 or 115 to Piazza Trilussa. Main courses: 13–18 ($21–$29).

SEAFOOD
Don’t expect a written menu and a lot of time to make up your mind in this
informal restaurant; you’ll have to listen to the daily offerings and recom-
mendations of your waiter, and then go for it. Don’t worry; you won’t regret
it: The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of the food are out-

standing. The pasta e fagioli con frutti di mare (bean and seafood soup) is
warm and satisfying; the tagliolini alla pescatora (homemade pasta with
seafood), delicate; and the fritto di paranza (fried small fish), delicious.
Also try the grilled daily catch.

Da Giggetto
$$
Teatro Marcello
JEWISH ROMAN
For decades, this famous restaurant has been the destination of Romans
who want to taste some of the specialties of Jewish Roman cuisine. Some
Romans say Giggetto is a little past its prime, but it’s still a good place to
sample such specialties as carciofi alla giudia (crispy fried artichokes), as
well as traditional Roman dishes such as fettuccine all’amatriciana and
saltimbocca alla romana.
See map p. 392. Via del Portico d’Ottavia 21. % 06-686-1105. Reservations recom-

Lunch on the go in Rome
Pizza is a very good choice, both for a quick and inexpensive meal and to make chil-
dren happy; they will love going to one of the ubiquitous pizza parlors (standing up
only) for a quick bite. The best — and most convenient — are Pizza, Via del Leoncino
28 (% 06-686-7757); Pizza a Taglio, Via della Frezza 40 (% 06-322-7116); Pizza,
Via della Penna 14 (% 06-723-4596); Pizza Rustica, Via del Portico d’Ottavia 
(% 06-687-9262) and Via dei Pastini 116 (% 06-678-2468); Il Tempio del Buongustaio,
Piazza del Risorgimento 50 (% 06-683-3709); Pizza Al Taglio, Via Cavour 307 
(% 06-678-4042); and PizzaBuona, Corso Vittorio Emanuele II 165 (% 06-689-3229).
Pizza Forum, Via San Giovanni, in Laterano 34 (% 06-700-2515) is a sit-down pizzeria
with very fast service.
Another good — and cheap — alternative is to have a sandwich standing up at a bar
counter. Of course, you can also sit down if you prefer, and pay the table service 
surcharge.
Finally, in fine weather, you can have great picnics in the Pincio Gardens, Villa
Borghese, and the Gianicolo. For your supplies, try Fattoria la Parrina, Largo Toniolo
3, between Piazza Navona and the Pantheon (% 06-6830-0111), which offers won-
derful organic cheese, wine, and veggies; L’Antico Forno di Piazza Trevi, Via delle
Muratte 8 (% 06-679-2866), where you’ll find superb focaccia and bread, as well as a
variety of other items; and the bakery — both savory and sweet goods — Forno Food
e Café, with several small shops around the Pantheon.

Pantheon
ROMAN/PIZZA
Here we come, as generations of Romans have done before us and keep
doing, for the sympathy of the service and the homemade food, which
includes some of the hard-to-find classics of Roman cuisine. Favorite pasta
dishes include the trofie cacio e pepe (fresh pasta with pecorino cheese and
black pepper) and the spaghetti alla gricia, but many come for the trippa alla
romana (tripe in a light tomato sauce) and the coda alla vaccinara (oxtail
stew). They also serve beans (fagioli, hence the name) prepared in various
manners, and excellent pizza. The restaurant across the street (Il Barroccio;
Via dei Pastini 13; % 06-678-3896) has the same owner and a similar menu.
See map p. 392. Via dei Pastini 123. % 06-678-3896. Reservations recommended on

plus. The seasonal menu may include ravioli di parmigiano e scorza di limone
con riduzione di basilico e pomodorini (Parmesan and lemon zest ravioli with
basil and cherry tomatoes reduction) or carré d’agnello con spuma di sedano
(rack of lamb with celery mousse). Desserts are simple but tasty.

Looking for a gelato break?
Why waste your time — and calories — with industrial ice cream when you can have
handmade gelato? Here are a few of the best in Rome: Giolitti, Via Uffici del Vicario 40
(% 06-699-1243; Minibus: 116), is the oldest gelato parlor in Rome and is reliably excel-
lent. Il Gelato, Piazza Sant’Eustachio 47, near the Pantheon (no phone) is one of the
newest but a highly recommended addition. Pica, Via della Seggiola 12 (%06-6880-3275;
Tram: 8), near Campo de’ Fiori, is another good address. Near Fontana di Trevi, head for
Gelateria Cecere, Via del Lavatore 84 (% 06-679-2060; Bus: 116 or 492). In Trastevere,

furnishings, and the professional service — both kind and discreet — all
add to Chef Heinz Beck’s masterly handling of the best Italian ingredients,
to make for a perfect experience. The tortellini verdi con vongole e cala-
maretti (green tortellini with clams and squid) and triglia su ragout di carciofi
(red mullet served over a ragout of artichokes) are delectable. The tasting
menu is a perfect way to sample several inventions at once (and highly rec-
ommended is a tasting menu of desserts). Finding your way up here by
public transportation would be impressive but laborious; take a taxi.

Rome’s top attractions
Castel Sant’Angelo (Hadrian’s Mausoleum)
San Pietro
This “castle” is a perfect example of recycling Roman style: It began as a
mausoleum to hold the remains of Emperor Hadrian, was then transformed
into a fortress, and is now a museum. Built in A.D. 123, it may have been
incorporated into the city’s defenses as early as 403 and was attacked by
the Goths (one of the barbarian tribes who pillaged Rome in its decline) in
537. Later, the popes used it as a fortress and hideout, and for convenience
they connected it to the Vatican palace by an elevated corridor — the pas-
setto — which you can still see near Borgo Pio, stretching between St.
Peter’s and the castle. Castel Sant’Angelo houses a museum of arms and
armor; you can also visit the elegant papal apartments from the Renaissance,
as well as the horrible cells in which political prisoners were kept (among
them sculptor Benvenuto Cellini). On Saturday, Sunday, and holidays, you
can take an interesting guided tour in English on the prisons inside the castle
for 3 ($4.80); reserve in advance at the phone number below. Count about
two hours for a full visit.

Catacombe di San Callisto (Catacombs of Saint Callixtus)
Park of Appia Antica
These are the best, most impressive catacombs in Rome, with 20km (121⁄2
miles) of tunnels and galleries underground descending as low as 18m (60
ft.) under. (It’s pretty cold down there during the summer, so bring a
sweater.) Early Christians held mass, celebrated their rites, and buried
their dead in underground hideouts; these catacombs were created inside
abandoned quarries and were organized over four levels, with some of the
original paintings and decorations still intact. The visit is led by a guide
who gives an explanatory introduction and then takes you down, without
further ado, for a 30-minute walk; lingering for questions and taking photos
once underground is not allowed.

Colosseum and Palatine Hill
Colosseo
The Colosseum, along with St. Peter’s Basilica, is Rome’s most recogniza-
ble monument. Begun under the Flavian Emperor Vespasian and finished
in A.D. 80, it was named the Amphiteatrum Flavium. The nickname came
from the colossal statue of Nero that was erected nearby in the second
century A.D. The Colosseum could accommodate up to 73,000 spectators
for entertainment that included fights between gladiators and battles with
wild animals. In the labyrinth of chambers beneath the original wooden
floor of the Colosseum, deadly weapons, vicious beasts, and gladiators
were prepared for the mortal combats. (Contrary to popular belief, the
routine feeding of Christians to lions is a legend.) The Colosseum was dam-
aged by fires and earthquakes, and eventually abandoned; it was then used
as a marble quarry for the monuments of Christian Rome until Pope
Benedict XV consecrated it in the 18th century. Next to the Colosseum is
the Arch of Constantine, built in A.D. 315 to commemorate the emperor’s
victory over the pagan Maxentius in A.D. 312. Pieces from other monu-
ments were reused, so Constantine’s monument includes carvings honor-
ing Marcus Aurelius, Trajan, and Hadrian. The Colosseum now houses
special exhibitions as well as performances.
Adjacent to the Colosseum is Palatine Hill. This is one of our preferred
spots in Rome: Huge blocks of brick surrounded by trees and greenery tes-
tify mutely to what was once an enormous residential complex of patri-
cian houses and imperial palaces, built with the grandiose ambitions of
the emperors. This hill is also where Romulus drew the original square for
the foundation of Rome and the first houses were built: Indeed, excava-
tions in the area uncovered remains that date back to the eighth century
B.C. Casa di Livia (Livia’s House) is one of the best-preserved homes.
Housed in what was the Palace of Caesar — later transformed into a 
convent — the Palatine Museum is where the most precious artwork
recovered from the archaeological excavations of the Palatino is

your pace and whether you visit the museum, you should consider spend-

ment of his special guests (Villa Borghese, see “More cool things to see

together the most stunning small collection on view in Italy with sculp-
tures such as Canova’s sensual reclining Paulina Borghese as Venus Victrix

National Roman Museum
Piazza Navona and Piazza della Repubblica
Modern Rome’s huge collection of ancient Roman artifacts has been
spread throughout several locations. Set aside at least an hour to visit the
15th-century Palazzo Altemps, located behind Piazza Navona, which
houses the Ludovisi Collection, one of the world’s most famous former
private art collections. The single most important piece is the Trono
Ludovisi, a fifth-century-B.C. Greek masterpiece, finely carved to depict
Aphrodite Urania rising from the waves on one side; a female figure offer-
ing incense on another; and a naked female playing a flute on yet another.
The remarkable Dying Gaul, depicting a man apparently committing sui-
cide with a sword, was commissioned by Julius Caesar and placed in his
gardens to commemorate his victories in Gaul.
Schedule at least two hours to visit the museum of antiquity, Palazzo
Massimo alle Terme, including — at the upper level — a magnificent col-
lection of floor mosaics and frescoes. Entire rooms from the Villa of Livia
on the Palatine Hill have been reconstructed here, and you can enjoy the
frescoes as they were meant to be. Note: You can visit the fresco collection

Pantheon
Navona/Pantheon
Rome’s best-preserved monument of antiquity, the imposing Pantheon was
built by the Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125 as a temple for all the gods (from
the ancient Greek pan theon, meaning “all gods”). It was eventually saved
from destruction by being transformed into a Christian church in A.D. 609.
Most of the marble floor is original, and the beautiful coffered dome, whose
5.4m (18-ft.) hole (oculus) lets in the light (and sometimes rain) of the Eternal
City, is an architectural marvel which inspired Michelangelo when he was
designing the dome of St. Peter’s, though he made the basilica’s dome 0.6m
(2 ft.) smaller. Inside, you’ll find the tombs of the painter Raphael and of two
of the kings of Italy. Crowds always congregate in the square in front, Piazza
della Rotonda, one of the nicest squares in Rome. A half-hour should be
enough to take in the highlights of the monument, plus another hour to soak
in the atmosphere from the terrace of one of the cafes.
See map p. 392. Piazza della Rotonda. % 06-6830-0230. Minibus: 116. Admission:

Piazza di Spagna and the Spanish Steps
Piazza di Spagna
The piazza and its famous steps are one of the favorite meeting places of
Rome, and sometimes in the good season you can hardly see the floor
because it’s crowded with locals and visitors. The atmosphere is festive
and convivial, though, and especially romantic in spring, when the steps
are decorated with colorful azaleas. The front yard of the Spanish ambas-
sador’s residence in the 16th century, it was then far less hospitable, as
the unwary could be press-ganged into the Spanish army. In more recent
times, the piazza’s most famous resident was English poet John Keats, who
lived and died in the house to the right of the steps, now the Keats–Shelley
Memorial House (% 06-678-4235; open Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–
6 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–2 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.); admission is 4 ($6.40). The steps
lead to the Trinità dei Monti church, whose towers loom above. At the
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 405

foot of the steps, the boat-shaped fountain by Pietro Bernini, father of Gian
Lorenzo, is one of the most famous in Rome.
See map p. 392. Via del Babuino and Via dei Condotti. Metro: Line A to Spagna.
Minibus: 117 or 119 to Piazza di Spagna.
Piazza Navona
Navona/Pantheon
The most beautiful piazza in Rome is also one of the most popular hangouts,
lined with cafes and crowded with craft artists and mimes. Built on the ruins
of the Stadium of Domitian from the first century A.D., where chariot races
were held (note the oval track form), it has kept its public role to these days.
Between the 17th and 19th centuries, the bottom of the square was flooded
for float parades in the summer, and now it’s where the traditional Epiphany
market — a colorful affair full of toys and sweets — is held during the three-
week Christmas period. The piazza is dominated by the twin-towered facade
of Santa Agnese in Agone, a baroque masterpiece by Borromini, and
Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers, with massive figures representing the
Nile, Danube, della Plata, and Ganges — the figure with the shrouded head
is the Nile, because its source was unknown at the time. Built in 1651, it is
crowned by an obelisk, a Roman copy from Domitian’s time. Bernini also
designed the figures of the Fountain of the Moor at the piazza’s south end.
(The tritons and other ornaments are 19th-century copies made to replace
the originals, which were moved to the Villa Borghese lake garden.)
See map p. 392. Just off Corso Rinascimento. Bus: 70 or 116 to Piazza Navona.
Roman Forum
Colosseo
This was the heart of public life in Ancient Rome, with all the main admin-
istrative, religious, and commercial venues. The Forum lies in the valley
between the Capitoline Hill, site of the great Temple of Jupiter, and the
Palatine Hill, where the royal palace and the palaces of the noblest fami-
lies were located. The Forum was built at the end of the seventh century
B.C. in this once marshy area, and a huge drainage and sewer canal was
dug under the forum: the Cloaca Massima, still in use. The main street of
the forum was Via Sacra, the “sacred street,” so called because it led to
the main temples on the Capitoline Hill (today, Piazza del Campidoglio);
you can still walk a stretch of it. Of the few standing buildings, the Arch of
Septimius Severus, built in A.D. 203 to commemorate this emperor’s vic-
tories, and nearby the Curia, an imposing square building where the
Senate once met; many of the walls were heavily restored in 1937, but the
marble-inlay floor inside is original from the third century A.D. Also well
preserved is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina (the Emperor
Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian in A.D. 138), because it was turned
into a church and given a baroque facade (Chiesa di San Lorenzo in
Miranda). The other arch in the Forum is the Arch of Titus who reigned
as emperor from A.D. 79 to 81. Nearby is the hulking form of the fourth-
century Basilica of Constantine and Maxentius, a small corner of what
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
406

were Rome’s law courts. As Rome grew, the Forum became too small to
accommodate the needs of the imperial capital, and it was gradually
expanded by the various emperors; Via dei Fori Imperial was built on top
of the Imperial Fori, but you can visit the impressive ruins (entrance at
Trajan Market, Via 4 Novembre 94; % 06-0608; www.mercatiditraiano.

St. Peter’s Basilica
San Pietro
In 324, Emperor Constantine commissioned a sanctuary to be built on the
site of St. Peter’s tomb. The first apostle was thought to have been buried
here under a simple stone, and excavation and studies commissioned by
the Vatican under the basilica have confirmed that thesis. The original
basilica stood for about 1,000 years, but with its accrued importance and
stability, the papacy decided it was time for renovations. Works begun in
1503 following designs by the architects Sangallo and Bramante. Then
Michelangelo was appointed to finish the magnificent dome in 1547 but he
died — in 1564 — before seeing its work completed, and his disciple
Giacomo della Porta finished the job. The inside of the basilica is almost
too huge to take in; walking from one end to the other is a workout, and the
opulence will overpower you. On the right as you enter is Michelangelo’s
exquisite Pietà, created when the master was in his early 20s. (Because of
an act of vandalism in the 1970s, the statue is kept behind reinforced
glass.) Dominating the central nave is Bernini’s 29m-tall (96-ft.) baldaquin,
supported by richly decorated twisting columns. Completed in 1633, it was
criticized for being excessive and because the bronze was supposedly
taken from the Pantheon. The canopy stands over the papal altar, which
in turn stands over the symbolic tomb of St. Peter. A bronze statue of St.
Peter (probably by Arnolfo di Cambio, 13th century) marks the tomb; its
right foot has been worn away by the millions of pilgrims kissing it in the
traditional devotional gesture to salute the pope. By the apse, above an
altar, is the bronze throne sculpted by Bernini to house the remains of
what is, according to legend, the chair of St. Peter.
To visit Michelangelo’s dome and marvel at the astounding view, you have
to climb some 491 steps. Make sure that you’re ready and willing to climb,
however, because after you’ve started up, you’re not allowed to turn around
and go back down. If you want to take the elevator as far as it goes, it’ll save
you 171 steps, and you’ll pay an additional 1/$1.60). On busy days, expect
to wait in line to get a lift.
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 407

Beneath the basilica are grottoes, extending under the central nave of the
church. You can visit them and wander among the tombs of popes. The
excavations proceed farther down, to the paleo-Christian tombs and archi-
tectural fragments of the original basilica that have been found here, but
you need to apply in writing at least three weeks beforehand to arrange
for a visit. Plan on at least two hours to see the entire basilica.

turies in relative obscurity before it became one of the must-see sights of
Rome, thanks to the film Three Coins in the Fountain. Crowded with thou-
sands of tourists who have their picture taken as they throw a coin into it,
you’ll have to come late at night or early in the morning to have a tranquil
moment to actually appreciate the artwork. The fountain was begun by
Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, but there was a 100-year lapse in the work,
and it wasn’t completed until 1751 by Nicola Salvi. The central figure is
Neptune, who guides a chariot pulled by plunging sea horses. Tritons
(mythological sea dwellers) guide the horses, and the surrounding scene
is one of wild nature and bare stone.
Of course, you have to toss a coin in the Trevi, something all kids love to
do. To do it properly (Romans are superstitious), hold the coin in your
right hand, turn your back to the fountain, and toss the coin over your left
shoulder. According to tradition, the spirit of the fountain will then see to it
that you return to Rome one day.
See map p. 392. Piazza di Trevi. Bus: 62. Minibus: 116 or 119. Take Via Poli to the
fountain.
Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel
San Pietro
This enormous complex of museums could swallow up your entire vaca-
tion, with its tons of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, paleo-Christian,
and Renaissance art. Among the several museums, the Gregorian
Egyptian Museum holds a fantastic collection of Egyptian artifacts; the
Gregorian Etruscan Museum, a beautiful collection of Etruscan art 
and jewelry; the Ethnological Missionary Museum, a large collection of
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
408

artifacts from every continent, including superb African, Asian, and
Australian art; and the Pinacoteca (picture gallery) contains a splendid
collection of medieval and Renaissance masterpieces, from Leonardo da
Vinci’s St. Jerome in Room 9, to Giotto’s luminous Stefaneschi Triptych in
Room 2, to Raphael’s Transfiguration in Room 8.
Also part of the museums are the Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael’s Rooms),
the private apartments of Pope Julius II: four rooms completely frescoed
by the artist, the largest depicting the life of the first Christian emperor,
Constantine, including his triumph over Maxentius and his vision of the
cross. Along the way, you’ll come across the Borgia Apartments, designed
for Pope Alexander VI (the infamous Borgia pope), and the Chapel of
Nicola V, with floor-to-ceiling frescoes by Fra Angelico.
But, of course, it is the Sistine Chapel, Michelangelo’s masterpiece, that is
the crowning glory of the museums. Years after their restoration, conflict
continues over whether too much paint was removed, flattening the fig-
ures. On the other hand, the brilliant color has been restored. The Creation
of Adam and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve are the most famous
scenes. Michelangelo also painted a terrifying and powerful Last Judgment
on the end wall.
Binoculars or even a hand mirror will help you appreciate the Sistine ceiling
better; your neck tires long before you can take it all in. Just think how poor
Michelangelo must have felt while painting it flat on his back atop a tower
of scaffolding!
Visiting all the museums in one day is impossible: Four color-coded itin-
eraries (A, B, C, or D), take you to the highlights of the museums: They
range from one-and-a-half to five hours, and all end at the Sistine Chapel.
Audio guides are essential.
If you booked the two-hour tour (Mar–Oct 10:30 a.m., noon, and 2 p.m.;
Nov–Feb 10:30 a.m. only), which includes museums, Raphael’s Rooms, and
the Sistine Chapel, you’ll need to take the fax confirmation you received to
the Guided Tour desk 15 minutes before your scheduled tour time. (The
line is to the right of the regular ticket-booth line at the main entrance of
the museums.)
The museums are free the last Sunday of each month — and everyone knows
it. Be prepared for huge mobs — or pay your way at another time.

More cool things to see and do
After you’ve covered all of Rome’s musts — and there are plenty —
you’ll have plenty more to choose from, including the following:
 Behind Caracalla Baths, Via delle Terme di Caracalla 52 (% 06-
3996-7700; http://archeoroma.beniculturali.it; open Mon 
9 a.m.–2 p.m., Tues–Sun 9 a.m. to one hour before sunset; ticket
booth closes one hour earlier; closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25)
starts the Via Appia Antica. Admission is 6 ($9.60), and your
ticket is valid for seven days and includes admission to Mausoleum
of Cecilia Metella and Villa of the Quintili in the Appia Antica Park.
Today a public park (% 06-513-0682; www.parcoappiaantica.org;
Bus: Archeobus, 118, 218, or 360) this is a section of the original
ancient Roman road — the Regina Viarum (Queen of Roads) —
which was built in 312 B.C. as the highway between Rome and
Capua. It was on this road that St. Peter, in flight from Rome, had his
vision of Jesus and turned back toward his martyrdom (the spot is
marked by a small church, named Domine Quo Vadis after the words
of Peter to Christ). The street is an archeological paradise, still
paved with the original large, flat basalt stones, and lined with the
remains of villas, tombs, and monuments against the background of
the beautiful countryside. We highly recommend visiting the
Catacombs of San Callisto (see earlier in this chapter) as well as the
Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella (Via Appia Antica 161) and the
impressive Villa dei Quintili (Via Appia Nuova 1092), a huge patri-
cian villa. These last two attractions observe the same hours and
admission as Caracalla Baths. The best way to visit this park’s
attractions is via the hop-on/hop-off Archeobus (see “Guided
tours,” later in this chapter) or by renting bicycles at the park visi-
tor center, Cartiera Latina (Via Appia Antica 42), or at the Bar Caffè
dell’Appia Antica (Via Appia Antica 175). Bikes rent for 3 ($4.80)
per hour or 10 ($16) for the whole day.
 Surrounding the Borghese Gallery (see earlier in this chapter), you’ll
find Villa Borghese, one of Rome’s most beautiful parks. Inside the
park is a romantic small lake where you can rent rowboats, and
Piazza di Siena, a picturesque oval track surrounded by tall pines,
used for horse races and for Rome’s international horse-jumping
event, the Concorso Ippico Internazionale di Roma, in May. The
park connects to the south to the famous Pincio Gardens, with their
panoramic terrace overlooking Piazza del Popolo — another one of
Rome’s wonderful piazze — and offering one of the best views of the
city, particularly striking at sunset. Children play areas and merry-go-
rounds are available in both gardens, as are bike rentals (Via
dell’Uccelliera, near the Borghese Gallery; Piazzale M.Cervantes,
near the zoo; Viale J. W. Goethe, off Viale del Museo Borghese, lead-
ing to the Borghese Gallery; and Pincio Gardens). To the northwest
of the park is Rome’s zoo, called Bioparco (% 06-360-8211;
www.bioparco.it; Open: Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Apr–Sep
daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m., last admission one hour earlier); admission is

8.50 ($14) adults, 6.50 ($10) children 12 and under. Also north-
west of Villa Borghese is the National Gallery of Modern Art 
(Viale delle Belle Arti 131; % 06-3229-8221; www.gnam.arti.beni
culturali.it; Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., last admission
40 minutes before closing); admission is 9 ($14).
 With showrooms of all big names of high fashion, design, and
antiques in the triangle formed by the streets between Piazza del
Popolo, the Spanish Steps, and the Corso, Rome is a shopping para-
dise: Via de’ Condotti has Gucci (no. 68A), Valentino (no. 13),
Fragiacomo (no. 35), Ferragamo (nos. 65, 73–74), Bulgari (no. 10),
and Battistoni (no. 61A). The ever-popular Benetton has locations
throughout Rome but also on Piazza di Spagna (nos. 67–69). Via
Frattina is home to Max Mara (no. 28), Brighenti (no. 7–8),
Anatriello del Regalo (no. 123), and Fornari (no. 133). In Via
Borgognona, you’ll find Givenchy (no. 21), Fendi (no. 36–40), and
Gianfranco Ferré (no. 42B). Via del Babuino offers the relatively
affordable “Emporio” of Armani (no. 140), Oliver (no. 61), Olivi
(no. 136), Alberto di Castro (no. 71), and Fava (no. 180). A bit far-
ther south, where Via Tritone hits the Corso at no. 189, is La
Rinascente, Rome’s biggest and finest upscale department store.
The area on the other side of the Corso is full of nice little shops.
 The ancient neighborhood of Trastevere on the Tiber’s right bank,
has become a favorite with locals and visitors for its artsy-trendy
boutiques and artisan workshops, and bustling nightlife. The neigh-
borhood is fairly bursting at the seams with eateries (both casual
and sophisticated). Its web of tight ancient streets and peppy
piazze offer fun shopping, bars, clubs, galleries, and even an
English-language movie house (the Pasquino, on Piazza S. Egidio).
Guided tours
The French writer Stendhal once wrote, “As soon as you enter Rome, get
in a carriage and ask to be brought to the Coliseum [sic] or to St. Peter’s.
If you try to get there on foot, you will never arrive: Too many marvelous
things will stop you along the way.”
Taking a tour — by bus now — as you first arrive still is an excellent
idea. The local transportation authority Atac offers three excellent hop-
on/hop-off tours (% 06-4695-2252 daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m. for reservations
and info; www.trambus.com/servizituristici.htm):
 110 Open red double-decker buses leave from Piazza dei
Cinquecento (across from Termini railroad station) every ten min-
utes between 8:40 a.m. and 7:40 p.m. for their 11-stop loop around
Rome’s major historic sights (16/$26 adults, 7/$11 children 6–12,
free for children 5 and under).
 Archeobus green buses leave from the same stop every 40 minutes
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. (10/$16, 8/$13 for those with Roma
Pass; see the “Don’t pass up these deals” sidebar, earlier in this
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 411

chapter, for details about the Roma Pass) for a 15-stop itinerary of
ancient Rome taking in the Appian Way Park.
 Roma Cristiana yellow double-decker buses leave from Via della
Conciliazione, across from St. Peter’s, for two different loops that
take in all the major religious sites in Rome: the St. Peter’s loop
(every 25 minutes), and the St. Paul’s Basilica loop (every 50 min-
utes) between 8:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. (15/$24 for one day and one
line, and 20/$32 for two days/two lines); ten of its stops are actu-
ally also near major nonreligious attractions.
A wonderful way to experience Rome is sailing down the Tiber by taking
a boat tour run by Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo, Ponte
Sant’Angelo, across from Castel Sant’Angelo (% 06-678-9361; www.
battellidiroma.it), offering day tours and evening cruises. Prices
range from 12 ($19) for the one-hour tour to 56 ($90) for the candle-
light dinner cruise.
Enjoy Rome, Via Varese 39, 3 small blocks north off Stazione Termini 
(% 06-445-1843; www.enjoyrome.com; open Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.
and 3:30–6:30 p.m., Sat 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m.) offers a variety of three-hour
walking tours, including a night tour that takes you through the histori-
cal center, and a tour of Trastevere and the Jewish Ghetto. All tours cost
26 ($42) adults and 20 ($32) for those 25 and under, including some
admissions.
Suggested itineraries
So much to see, so little time. The following three itineraries offer recom-
mendations on how best to spend your time in Rome.
If you have one day
It’s a tall order to try to see the Eternal City in what amounts to the blink
of an eye. But if you don’t have more than a day to spend here, we rec-
ommend the following: Head to Termini train station early in the morn-
ing and take the 110 Open stop-and-go bus tour. Get off at the Colosseum
for a visit, and then walk through the Roman Forum. You can then take
your bus again and get off at the stop near Piazza Navona to visit this
famous piazza. Then stroll to the nearby Pantheon and have lunch at
Grappolo d’Oro–Zampanò. Enjoy some shopping in the area after lunch
before getting back on your bus. Head to St. Peter’s Basilica, where you’ll
get off to visit the church. After your visit, climb back on the bus and get
off at the stop near the Trevi Fountain for a visit to the world’s most
famous fountain. Continue then toward Piazza di Spagna and Spanish
Steps, enjoying a bit of shopping on your way. Have a special dinner at La
Pergola.
If you have two days
On Day 1, you can begin as in the preceding section, spending more
time visiting the archaeological area, including the Palatine Hill. In the
afternoon, head for Galleria Borghese, where you made your advance
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
412

reservations. After your visit, stroll down through the Pincio Gardens
overlooking Piazza del Popolo, if possible at sunset. Have your aperitivo
here at La Casina Valadier.
On Day 2 follow Day 2 in the next section, but skip the visit inside Castel
Sant’Angelo to squeeze in a pick at Piazza Navona and the Pantheon on
your way to the Spanish Steps. After your visit at Trevi Fountain, have
your last dinner in Rome at La Pergola.
If you have three days
Start on Day 1 as in the “If you have one day” itinerary, and spend your
morning imbibing in ancient Rome. After a nice lunch at Angelino ai
Fori, get back on your bus and finish the tour (it’s a loop) to scope out
the rest of Rome; get off at the stop near Piazza Navona to visit this
famous piazza, and stroll into the Pantheon for a visit. Have dinner at Er
Faciolaro (see “Dining in Rome,” earlier in this chapter).
On Day 2, get up early and head for the Vatican Museums to see the
Sistine Chapel, and continue your visit with St. Peter’s Basilica. You’ll
then be ready for a good lunch at Da Benito e Gilberto. In the afternoon,
see Castel Sant’Angelo and cross the river Tiber over Ponte
Sant’Angelo. You can then walk north along the river and turn right at
Via del Clementino toward the Spanish Steps and Piazza di Spagna.
Stroll to the Trevi Fountain after dinner.
On Day 3, take a boat tour in the morning, and then explore the funky
medieval neighborhood of Trastevere, on the south side of the river
Tiber, having lunch in one of the local restaurants. In the afternoon, head
for Galleria Borghese, where you’ve made your advance reservation.
After your visit, stroll down through the Pincio Gardens overlooking
Piazza del Popolo, if possible at sunset. Have your aperitivo here at La
Casina Valadier, and then head to La Pergola for your last dinner in
Rome.
Traveling beyond Rome
If you can tear yourself away from Rome, consider catching a glimpse of
the splendors of the south, and hop onto a high-speed train for Naples.
Naples: A splendid art city welcoming visitors once
again
Thanks to high-speed trains, Naples is only a little over an hour away
from Rome, making it possible to see its historic district — with its cas-
tles, medieval and baroque churches full to the brim with artworks,
unique museums, and a most romantic waterfront promenade — or the
famed archaeological area of Pompeii or Herculaneum as a day trip from
the capital. If you can, though, take the time to explore this vivid, intense
destination by spending a couple of nights.
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 413

Getting there
The small but well-run Capodichino airport (% 081-789-6259; www.
gesac.it) — 7km (4 miles) from the city center and only 15 minutes away
by public transportation — receives daily flights from Italian and European
destinations, including connecting flights from the United States.
If you’re coming as a day trip from Rome, book yourself on one of the
new high-speed trains (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), and in 87 min-
utes you’ll be in Napoli’s Stazione Centrale (% 081-554-3188) on Piazza
Garibaldi, on the northeastern edge of the historic district; you can also
take one of the frequent regular trains, taking two-and-a-half hours.
Outside the station, you’ll find taxis and public transportation.
You’ll find a small tourist info point inside the rail station (% 081-
268799; open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.), and better ones in Via San Carlo 9,
off Piazza del Plebiscito (% 081-402394), in Via Santa Lucia 107 (% 081-
240-0914), and in Piazza del Gesù (% 081-551-2701), all open Monday
through Saturday 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 7 p.m.
Seeing the sights
Before heading out to explore Naples, consider purchasing an artecard
(% 800-600-601 in Italy, or 06-3996-7650; www.campaniartecard.it),
the area’s most comprehensive sightseeing pass. The pass grants unlim-
ited public transportation and free admission to two attractions and a 
50 percent discount to all other eligible locales out of an extensive list
including all the region’s major museums and archaeological areas. The
Naples-only three-day version costs 13 ($21), and the three-day all-
sites version costs 25 ($40); seven-day and youth versions are avail-
able. You can buy it at the Capodichino airport (a good idea if you’re
planning to use the Alibus bus, which is included), the molo beverello
(harbor), the train station of Napoli Centrale, as well as major hotels,
some news kiosks, and all participating attractions.
We recommend the City Sightseeing hop-on/hop-off bus tour (% 081-
551-7279; www.napoli.city-sightseeing.it), which provides a great
introduction to the city as well as convenient transportation between
major attractions. Its three one-hour itineraries all start from Piazza
Municipio/Parco Castello: Line A travels inland to Museo di Capodimonte
(Apr daily 9:45 a.m.–4:30 p.m., May–Sept daily 9:45 a.m.–5:15 p.m.); Line B
goes along the seaside to Posillipo (Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m.); and
Line C heads up the cliff to the Carthusian Monastery of San Martino on
the Vomero (May–Sept daily 10 a.m.–4:45 p.m.). Check the schedule — it
changes often. You can get tickets onboard for 22 ($35) adults, 11 ($18)
children 6 to 15, and 66 ($106) for families (up to two adults and three
children). Tickets are valid for all lines for 24 hours. You get a 10 percent
discount if you have the artecard (see the preceding paragraph). In the off
season, you’ll move best by taxi.
Then you can wander through the narrow streets of the Città Antica to
the Duomo, Via Duomo 147 (% 081-449097 Duomo and 081-421609
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
414

museum; Metro: Piazza Cavour), Naples’s cathedral decorated with art-
works by great masters including Perugino and Domenichino, and its
mosaic-covered fourth-century baptistery. Admission to the Duomo is
free; admission to its accompanying museum is 10 ($16), but it’s eligi-
ble for a 25 percent discount with the artecard. The Duomo is open
Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 7 p.m., and
Sunday and holidays 8 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 5 to 7:30 p.m. The museum’s
hours are Tuesday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Sunday and
holidays 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Lesser known to foreign visitors than the Uffizi, Naples’s picture gallery, the
Museo di Capodimonte, Via Miano 1 (% 081-749-9111; www.musis.it;
Bus: 24 or R4 to Parco Capodimonte), holds a splendid collection with
works by Mantegna, Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, Botticelli, Masaccio, and
Perugino, among others. You should not miss the royal apartments, full
of priceless objects and artwork, as this was a hunting “lodge” for the
Bourbon kings. Admission is 7.50 ($12), and 6.50 ($10) after 2 p.m.
Audio guides rent for 4 ($6.40). The museum is open Thursday through
Tuesday 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (ticket booth closes 1 hour earlier); it’s
closed January 1 and December 25.
If you’re planning a visit to Pompeii and Herculaneum, make time to 
visit the National Archaeological Museum, Piazza Museo Nazionale 19
(% 081-440166; Metro: Museo or Piazza Cavour), the world’s oldest
antiquity museum and one of the richest. Here you’ll find entire rooms
from Pompeii, Herculaneum, and other nearby sites, reconstructed with
the original frescoes, as well as a treasure-trove of mosaic floors, sculp-
tures, and carved objects. Admission is 6.50 ($10), and audio guides
rent for 4 ($6.40). The museum is open Wednesday through Monday 
9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (ticket booth closes one hour earlier); it’s closed
January 1 and December 25.
Finish your day with an evening at Teatro di San Carlo, Via San Carlo 93
(% 081-400300; Fax: 081-400902; www.teatrosancarlo.it; Bus: R2 or
R3 to Via San Carlo), the world’s first opera house — and one of the
most beautiful — a neoclassical jewel said to have better acoustics than
Milan’s famous La Scala (you can sign up for a guided tour at % 081-
553-4565; open Thurs–Mon 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m., other days by reservation
only). Or stroll along the waterfront promenade of Via Partenope, graced
by Naples’s most famous landmark, Castel dell’Ovo, a picturesque
fortress built on a small promontory projecting into the beautiful harbor.
Where to stay and dine
You’ll be welcome like royalty at Grand Hotel Vesuvio, Via Partenope 
45 (% 081-764-0044; Fax: 081-663527; www.vesuvio.it; Rack rates:
430–440/$688–$704 double, including buffet breakfast). Like one of
the family is the more moderate but still elegant Hotel Miramare, Via
Nazario Sauro 24 (% 081-764-7589; Fax: 081-764-0775; www.hotel
miramare.com; Rack rates: 282–357/$451–$571 double, including
buffet breakfast). Modern Una Hotel Napoli, Piazza Garibaldi 9 
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 415

(% 081-563-6901; Fax: 081-563-6972; www.unahotels.it; Rack rates:
261/$418 double, including buffet breakfast), is a stylish new hotel that
is convenient to the train station.
For a taste of real Neapolitan pizza, head to Brandi, Salita Sant’Anna di
Palazzo 1, off Via Chiaia (% 081-416928; open Tues–Sun 12:30–3:30 p.m.
and 7:30 p.m. to midnight). For local seafood specialties, go to La
Cantinella, Via Cuma 42, off Via Nazario Sauro (% 081-764-8684; open
Mon–Sat 12:30–3:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to midnight; closed one week in
Jan and three weeks in Aug).
Herculaneum and Pompeii: The world’s most famous
ancient Roman archaeological areas
Buried beneath volcanic ash and pumice stone in Mount Vesuvius’s A.D. 79
eruption, the ruins of Pompeii have been easier to excavate than those in
Herculaneum, bringing to light almost the whole town. The huge site —
four times larger than Herculaneum — is impressive. Because it was cov-
ered in hard volcanic mud — and the new town was built over it — only a
small part of Herculaneum has been excavated, but this is highly interest-
ing, having yielded rich and elaborated buildings, as well as woodwork
that only partially burned.
Getting there
From Naples, board the Circumvesuviana railway (Corso Garibaldi; 
% 800-053939; www.vesuviana.it; Metro: Garibaldi). For Pompeii,
take the Sorrento line and get off at the Pompei Scavi stop (the Pompei
stop on the other line is the modern town; don’t take that). The station
is near the entrance of the archaeological area. The 45-minute ride is
2.20 ($3.50). For Herculaneum, take either the Poggiomarino or the
Sorrento line, both of which stop at Ercolano Scavi; outside the station
you’ll find a shuttle bus to the site. The 20-minute ride costs 1.70
($2.70). Trains leave every half-hour on either line.
Seeing the sights
You’ll need water, comfortable shoes, and a hat and sunscreen in
summer to visit these large sights in comfort.
We recommend signing up for an official guided tour, particularly for
Pompeii; you can do so at the entrance or in advance by phone or online
(% 081-857-5347; www.pompeiisites.org), and at www.arethusa.net;
a number of buildings — the most interesting — are accessible by guided
tour only: Casa del Menandro (visits every 30 minutes Sat–Sun 2–4 p.m.);
Casa degli Amorini Dorati and Casa dell’Ara Massima (each daily, every 
30 minutes, 9 a.m.–6 p.m.); and Suburban Baths, a set of private thermal
baths attached to a sumptuous villa set in a splendid, panoramic spot 
by the western town wall overlooking the sea (daily, every 30 minutes,
10 a.m.–1:30 p.m.). Note: At press time, the baths were closed for 
restoration.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
416

Smaller then Pompeii — about a third smaller estimate the experts —
Herculaneum, Corso Resina (% 081-857-5347; www.pompeiisites.org),
was the glitzier seaside resort for VIPs during Roman times. It’s estimated
that, at the time of the eruption, Herculaneum was a town of about 5,000.
Among the most interesting public buildings are the elegantly decorated
thermal baths and the Collegio degli Augustali, lavishly decorated with
marble floors and frescoes. This building had a custodian; he was found
sleeping in his bed, which you can still see in his small room. The best
example of private architecture is the House of the Stags, so named for
the sculpture found inside — an elegant town house overlooking the sea
built around uncovered atriums and terraces, and lavishly decorated. The
House of the Mosaic of Neptune was a merchant’s house, and you can see
his shop lined with cabinets and merchandise still on the counter.
Pompeii was an important commercial town as well as a residential resort,
and its urban fabric was a mix of elegant villas, shops, and more modest
housing. The excavated Archaeological Area, Porta Marina, off Via Villa
dei Misteri (% 081-857-5347; www.pompeiisites.org), is huge — about
44 hectares (109 acres) — representing about two-thirds of the original
town; at the time of the eruption, Pompeii had about 35,000 inhabitants.
Organized around three poles — the Forum, the theater district by the
triangular forum, and the games and sports area with the Palestra and
the Amphitheater — this large town followed the classic Roman grid of
almost perpendicular streets, both residential and commercial, lined with
taverns and shops. Nearest to the entrance is the Forum — covering
5,388 square meters (58,000 sq. ft.) — surrounded by three important
buildings: the Basilica (the meeting hall and the city’s largest single
structure), the Macellum (covered market), and the Temple of Jupiter.
The theater district is farther along, with the beautiful Teatro Grande —
a structure that could hold 5,000 — and the smaller Odeion — for only
about 1,000. Nearby are the Stabian Baths, the finest thermal baths to
have survived from antiquity. Still in good condition, they’re richly deco-
rated with marble, frescoes, and mosaics. At the other end of town are
the Amphitheater — from 80 B.C., it’s the oldest in the world — and the
magnificent Palestra, the sports compound, with exercise areas and a
swimming pool that must have been wonderful: huge and surrounded by
trees, of which you can see the casts of the stumps. Among the best pri-
vate homes, the most elegant is the House of the Vettii, belonging to two
rich merchants, where you can admire a frescoed dining room in the col-
oring that has become famous as Pompeiian red. The largest is the
House of the Faun, so called because of the bronze statue of a dancing
faun that was found there; the house takes up a city block and has four
dining rooms and two spacious inner gardens.
Admission to Herculaneum and Pompeii is 11 ($18) each, and they’re
open daily November through March 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and April
through October 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (last admission is 90 minutes 
earlier). Both sites are also included with the artecard (see “Seeing the
sights” in the earlier section on Naples); alternatively, if you have time to
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 417

visit both Herculaneum and Pompeii, you can get a cumulative ticket for
20 ($32); it’s valid for three days and gives you access to three other
archaeological sites in the Vesuvian area — Oplontis, Stabiae, and
Boscoreale.
Where to stay and dine
We like Hotel Forum, Via Roma 99 (% 081-850-1170; Fax: 081-850-6132;
www.hotelforum.it; rack rates: 120–170/$192–$272 double, including
buffet breakfast), with an excellent location not far from the excavations
and modern, spacious guest rooms.
At Il Principe, Piazza Bartolo Longo, in the center of modern Pompei
(% 081-850-5566; open Tues–Sun 12:30–3 p.m. and Tues–Sat 8–11 p.m.),
you’ll have your chance to try — and, we hope, enjoy — some ancient
Roman concoctions in an “authentic” Pompeian dining room or in the
pleasant outdoors; it also serves well-prepared modern favorites.

(% 06-6988-4466; open Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–
6 p.m.), under the colonnade to the left as
you face the entrance to St. Peter’s Basilica.
For cultural events, the best is the monthly
The Happening City, distributed for free at
the tourist information kiosks. For informa-
tion on restaurants and nightlife, you can
buy the magazines Time Out Rome; Wanted
in Rome, an all-English publication; or
Roma C’è, in Italian but with a section in
English (it comes out on Thurs).
Internet Access
Most hotels in Rome offer free Internet
access to their guests. In addition, Internet
cafes are everywhere. One good chain is
Internet Train (www.internettrain.it)
with locations at Via delle Fornaci 22, near
San Pietro (open Mon–Sat 6:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m.
and Sun 6:30 a.m.–1 p.m.); Piazza
Sant’Andrea della Valle 3, near Piazza
Navona (open Mon–Fri 10:30 a.m.–11 p.m.
and Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–8 p.m.), and Via
delle Fratte di Trastevere 44/b (open daily 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.). Another is Yex, with a per-
fect location off Corso Vittorio Emanuele II, 
only steps from Piazza Navona (Piazza
Sant’Andrea della Valle 1; open daily 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.). Charges usually run
around 5 ($8) for one hour.
Maps
The free tourist-office map is quite good,
but it doesn’t have a stradario (street direc-
tory); you can buy one at any newsstand
and many bookstores.
Pharmacies
Centrally located 24-hour pharmacies are at
Termini station (% 06-488-0019), Piazza
Risorgimento 44 (% 06-3973-8166), Via
Arenula 73 (% 06-6880-3278), Corso
Rinascimento 50 (% 06-6880-3985), and
Piazza Barberini 49 (% 06-487-1195).
Police
Dial % 113.
Post Office
The central post office is in Piazza San
Silvestro 19, off Via del Tritone and Via del
Corso. It’s open Monday through Friday
from 8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Saturday
from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m.
The Vatican also has a post office (under
the colonnades to the right). You’ll have to
use Vatican stamps and post your mail in
the Vatican mailboxes.
Restrooms
Public toilets are few and far apart: outside
the Colosseum on the southeast side;
halfway up the steps from Piazza del Popolo
to the Pincio, on the left side. Facing St.
Peter’s, you can find toilets under the
Chapter 19: Rome and Southern Italy 419

colonnade on the right. Make sure you have
some change to tip the attendant. Your best
bet may be to go to a nice-looking cafe
(though you have to buy something, like a
cup of coffee, to use the restroom).
Safety
Rome is a very safe city; however, petty
theft is common. Pickpockets abound in
tourist areas, on public transportation, and
around crowded open-air markets like the
Porta Portese. Observe common big-city
caution: Keep your valuables in your hotel
safe, don’t be distracted, watch your
belongings, don’t count your money in
public, and avoid displaying valuable jew-
elry and electronic equipment. Rome has
some areas of poverty where a wealthy-
looking tourist with an expensive camera
may be mugged after dark, but those are
way out on the outskirts of the city.
If you’re a woman traveling alone, chances
are that you’ll attract young men’s attention.
Rome has become a cosmopolitan city, and
the way you dress may offend some cul-
tural segments. In general, the dress code
is stricter in Rome than in North America,
and although you’ll see a lot of female skin
displayed, you’ll also notice that these
women always move in company; if you’re
alone, you may want to cover up a bit. Also,
it isn’t a good idea to wander too far from
the beaten path at night if you’re alone; the
area behind Termini station can be unsafe
for women on their own, as can some
deserted, dark, and narrow streets in the
historical center. Just take it easy and, if
you feel harassed, immediately speak up
and don’t hesitate to ask for help from a
passerby or enter a cafe or shop and ask
for the attendant’s assistance.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If smoking
at your table is important to you, call
beforehand to make sure the restaurant or
cafe you’ll be visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
The value-added tax in Italy (called IVA) is a
steep 19 percent and is already included in
the sticker price of any item. Non-EU citi-
zens who spend more than 155 ($248) in a
single store are entitled to a refund. (The
store gives you an invoice that you can
cash in for euros at the airport’s Customs
office as you leave Italy, or you can have
the invoice stamped at the airport by
Customs, and mail it back to the store, for a
check or credit to your charge account.)
Hotel taxes are 10 percent and are also
usually included in quoted prices (except,
oddly, in the most expensive luxury hotels).
Taxis
If you need a taxi, call % 06-88177, 06-6645,
06-4994, 06-5551, or 06-6545 for radio-taxi
service or walk to one of the many stations
scattered around town at major squares
and stations. You’ll find taxi stands near
major landmarks, including Piazza Barberini
(at the foot of Via Veneto), Piazza San
Silvestro, and Piazza SS. Apostoli (both not
far from the Trevi Fountain).
Telephone
To call Italy from the U.S., dial the interna-
tional access code, 011; then Italy’s country
code, 39; and then the local area code fol-
lowed by the telephone number. Area
codes have different numbers of digits —
06 for Rome, 055 for Florence, and so on —
but always begin with 0; cellular lines
instead always have three-digit area codes
beginning with 3 (340, 338, and so on,
depending on the company network). Toll-
free numbers have an 800 or 888 area code,
and some paying services use three-digit
codes beginning with 9. Also, some compa-
nies have their own special numbers that
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
420

don’t conform to any of the preceding stan-
dards and that are local calls from any-
where in Italy, such as the railroad info line
of Trenitalia, % 892021.
To make a call within Italy, always dial the
area code — including 0 if any — for both
local and long distance. Public pay phones
in Italy take a carta telefonica (telephone
card), which you can buy at a tabacchi
(tobacconist, marked by a sign with a white
T on a black background), bar, or news-
stand. The cards can be purchased in dif-
ferent denominations, from 2 to 7.50
($3.20–$12). Tear off the perforated corner,
stick the card in the phone, and you’re
ready to go. A local call in Italy costs 0.10
(15¢).
To call abroad from Italy, dial the interna-
tional access code, 00; then the country
code of the country that you’re calling (1 for
the United States and Canada, 44 for the
United Kingdom, 353 for Ireland, 61 for
Australia, 64 for New Zealand); and then the
phone number. Make sure that you have a
high-value carta telefonica before you start;
your 5 ($8) won’t last long when you call
San Diego at noon. Lower rates apply after
11 p.m., before 8 a.m., and on Sundays.
Using your U.S. calling card may be
cheaper: Some of them offer a toll-free
access number in Italy, so check with your
calling-card provider before leaving on your
trip. You can also make collect calls. For
AT&T, dial % 800-172-4444; for MCI, 
dial % 800-905825; and for Sprint, dial 
% 800-172405 or 800-172406. To make a
collect call to a country other than the
United States, dial % 170. For directory
assistance, dial % 12 for local (free 
within Italy) and % 176 for international.
Remember that calling from a hotel is con-
venient but usually expensive, because 
various surcharges apply.
Transit Info
The local public transportation authority (bus,
tram, and Metro) is ATAC (% 800-431784 
or 06-4695-2027; www.atac.roma.it). 
For railroad information, call Trenitalia 
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it).

Florence and Tuscany
In This Chapter
© Getting to and around Florence

© Discovering the best hotels, restaurants, and attractions
© Side-tripping to Pisa, Siena, and San Gimignano
I
f you’re an art or history buff or enjoy your food and wine, Tuscany is
a must-see destination on your trip to Europe. Your exploration of
Florence may include Brunelleschi’s ingenious cathedral dome and the
Uffizi Galleries — the world’s most esteemed collection of Renaissance
artwork, from da Vinci’s Annunciation to Botticelli’s Birth of Venus. In
Siena, you’ll delight at the Duomo and at the magnificent frescoes inside
the Libreria Piccolomini or in Santa Maria della Scala. The splendid
Tuscan Gothic style dominates in Pisa, with its world-famous Leaning
Tower, while San Gimignano remains a stronghold of medieval times,
dominating the quaint hills of the Tuscany countryside with its towers.
But Tuscany has much more to offer than just centuries-old art. You can
enjoy a sumptuous Tuscan meal, with plenty of Chianti wine from the
countryside, in each of these destinations.
Try to spend at least two days in Florence, three if you can swing it; the
other destinations covered in this chapter are close enough for easy day
trips from Florence, but they could also easily justify longer stays.
Getting There
Located in the heart of Italy, Tuscany and Florence are easy to get to.
Arriving by air
Both Florence’s airport Amerigo Vespucci (% 055-306-1300; www.
aeroporto.firenze.it) and Pisa’s Galileo Galilei airport (% 050-
849111; www.pisa-airport.com) receive flights from a number of
European and Italian cities. Pisa’s is the largest of the two airports, but
both are easy to get around. You can find ATMs, currency exchange
booths, and tourist information points at either airport in the arrivals
concourse. Only flights from countries outside the European Union are

subject to passport control. In most cases, you’ll go directly to luggage
delivery and then Customs. Here you’ll find two gates: one for those who
have something to declare (beyond allowance), and one for those who
don’t: this is where there may be random checks.
Locally called Peretola, from the name of the village nearby, the Amerigo
Vespucci airport is only 4km (21⁄2 miles) outside of Florence, a few min-
utes away by public transportation, which you’ll find just outside the
arrivals concourse. A taxi takes about ten minutes and costs about 20
($32). Otherwise, you can take the Volainbus shuttle bus for 4.50
($7.20); buses leave for the 20-minute trip every 20 minutes between 
5:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m., and hourly after that, and arrive at the Florence’s
SITA bus terminal (Via Santa Caterina 15r), just behind the central rail
station of Santa Maria Novella. You can buy tickets onboard. You can
also get into Florence by regular city bus (no. 62; 1.20/$1.90), which
takes about half an hour and also arrives at Santa Maria Novella.
The Galileo Galilei airport is only 3km (2 miles) south of Pisa — a ten-
minute taxi ride — but 80km (50 miles) west of Florence. The easiest
way to get from Pisa to Florence is to board the dedicated shuttle train
(www.trenitalia.it) from the Pisa airport’s terminal, which arrives
into Florence inside Santa Maria Novella rail station; it makes ten runs a
day, costs 5.20 ($8.30), and takes about an hour.
Arriving by rail
Trains to Florence pull into Stazione Santa Maria Novella (% 055-
288765), which is often abbreviated as S.M.N. You’ll find a luggage 
check at the head of Track 16. A last-minute hotel reservations desk 
and a tourist information point can arrange for and distribute some 
information, such as the free city map; this is also where you can pick up
your reserved tickets for the Uffizi or the Accademia (see “Exploring
Florence,” later in this chapter). Public transportation is just outside 
the station, where you’ll find a taxi stand and a bus terminal with lines 
to basically anywhere in town. Located at the northwestern edge of the
historic district, the station is also within walking distance of most
attractions.
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 423
Street numbering Florence-style
Florence’s tradition of independence is probably behind the towns’ peculiar way of
marking street addresses: Restaurant, office, and shop doors are numbered inde-
pendently from residential and hotel doors. The first set of numbers is usually painted
in red and always marked with the letter r appended to the number (for rosso, “red”);
the second is painted in black or blue. Therefore it can easily happen that no. 1r (office
or business) and no. 1 (private residence — or hotel, which is where it gets confus-
ing) are in different buildings, and maybe a few door numbers apart.

Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
424
Finding information after you arrive
The tourist office (APT, Via A. Manzoni 16, 50121 Firenze; % 055-23320;
Fax: 055-234-6286; www.firenzeturismo.it) maintains three tourist
info points in town: at Via Cavour 1r (% 055-290832; open Mon–Sat 
8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sun 8:30 a.m.–1:30 p.m.); at S.M.N. rail station, Piazza
Stazione 4/a (% 055-212245; open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun 8:30
a.m.–2 p.m.); and at Borgo Santa Croce 29r (% 055-234-0444; open
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m. [until 5 p.m. in winter], Sun 9 a.m.–2 p.m.).
Getting Around Florence
Florence is very safe; the major crime is pickpocketing, an activity that
traditionally occurs in the crowded areas of the historic district.
The free tourist office map is completely adequate for most visitors,
especially if you combine it with the free bus map you can get from ATAF
(see the “By bus” section, later), but if you’re an ambitious explorer and
don’t feel satisfied, you can buy a cartina con stradario (map with
street directory) at any newsstand for about 6 ($9.60).
On foot
Because the historic district is closed to all traffic except for public
buses — no cars, no taxis, and no mopeds — and attractions lie rela-
tively close to each other, walking is the best way to enjoy the town. The
walk between the two farthest attractions in the historic center —
Galleria dell’Accademia and Palazzo Pitti — takes only about one hour at
an average pace, and you’d also pass most of the major sights in town.
By bus
Florence’s bus system is well organized and easy to use. You’ll probably
most use the electric minibuses — identified by letters A, B, C, and D —
which are allowed within the centro storico. They do come in handy
when your feet ache after a long day at the Uffizi or shopping on Via
Tornabuoni. Regular buses are great to move rapidly back and forth
between Oltrarno and the center of town (lines 36 and 37), and to reach
some out-of-the-way attractions such as Fiesole (Line 7).
You can buy bus tickets at the ATAF booth (% 800-424-500) across SMN
train station, and at most bars, tobacconist shops (signed tabacchi or by
a white T on a black background), and newsstands; a single ticket (a
biglietto) costs 1.20 ($1.90) in advance or 2 ($3.20) onboard (exact
fare only, bus drivers don’t make change). It’s valid for 70 minutes on as
many buses as you want. You can save a bit if you get a Carta Agile —
an electronic card worth ten single tickets for the price of eight
(10/$16), or 20 tickets for the price of 16 (20/$32), which can be used
by more than one person if you’re traveling together: Just pass it in front
of the magnetic eye of the machine onboard the bus as many times as
you have passengers in your group; if you want to know how much

money you have left on the card, press the button on the machine
marked INFO and swipe your card. You can also get unlimited-ride passes:
a 24-hour pass costs 5 ($8) and a three-day pass goes for 12 ($19).
At press time, the municipality was about to launch a new 24-hour ticket:
Passpartour, including all public transportation and City Sightseeing
tours (see “Guided tours,” later in this chapter) for 22 ($35) adults,
11 ($18) children 14 and under. They’ll be sold onboard City
Sightseeing buses, at hotels, and at all ATAF ticket vendors. Another
option is the Iris pass, which gives access to all public transportation —
including trains — within the province of Florence and Prato, plus a 
20 percent discount on attractions. It’s available for one day (8/$13
adults, 5/$8 children 14 and under) and three days (23/$37 adults,
12/$19 children 14 and under).
Remember that tickets need to be stamped upon boarding; unlimited-
ride passes need to be stamped only once on your first trip.
Staying in Florence
Florence is a major tourist destination and the choice of accommoda-
tions is large and varied. Still, it may be hard to secure a nice room at a
decent price during high season (May–June and Sept–Oct); depending
on your budget, you may have to settle for a less central location, or else
make sure you reserve well in advance (see Chapter 7 for more about
hotel booking).
If you arrive in Florence without a hotel reservation, your best bet is the
room-finding service run by the tourist info desk at the Santa Maria
Novella rail station. If you’re driving, there are similar services at the
tourist info desks in the Area di Servizio AGIP Peretola (rest area) on
Highway A11 (% 055-421-1800) and in the Area di Servizio Chianti Est
on Highway A1 (% 055-621349).
The top hotels
Grand Hotel Villa Medici
$$$$
Teatro Comunale
This is the best of the luxury hotels if you’re visiting Florence in summer:
Although the beautiful 18th-century palazzo with its splendid salons is
welcoming in any season, the large garden and swimming pool will feel
absolutely heavenly in the town’s heat — a unique plus for a centrally
located hotel. The large, individually decorated guest rooms are tasteful,
if a bit old-fashioned. All have beautiful bathrooms done in Carrara marble.
Rooms on the higher floors have small private terraces and panoramic
views of the city.

Hotel Bellettini
$
Duomo
This reliable, moderately priced hotel is run by two sisters who are very
friendly and helpful. Housed in a 14th-century palazzo just steps from
the Duomo, it is pleasantly old-fashioned and offers simple, clean guest
rooms — some with fantastic views — and one of the best breakfasts in
town for the price, with a buffet that includes ham and fresh fruit. You
can get cheaper rates if you choose a shared bathroom, or you can
splurge on one of the superior rooms in the annex. The latter are more
spacious and come with Carrara marble bathrooms.
See map p. 426. Via de’ Conti 7, steps from the Duomo. % 055-213561. Fax: 055-283551.
www.hotelbellettini.com. Bus: 1, 6, or 11 to Martelli; take Via de’ Cerretani
and turn right on Via de’ Conti. Rack rates: 140 ($224) double. Rates include buffet
breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Calzaiuoli
$$$
Duomo
This centrally located hotel is a good moderate choice in an expensive
town, with a pleasant hall, a nice restaurant, and excellent accommoda-
tions. Guest rooms are spacious and stylish, decorated with care and taste:
pastel-colored walls, stucco moldings, carpeted or nicely tiled floors, and
quality wooden furnishings. Some of the bathrooms are small, but nicely
done in Carrara marble. If you like sleeping with an open window, make
sure you reserve a room at the back; rooms overlooking Via dei Calzaiuoli
get quite noisy with pedestrian traffic, and the double-pane windows won’t
help if you don’t close them.

Hotel Casci
$
Accademia
We love this moderately priced hotel at a great location not far from the
Accademia. Housed in a 15th-century palazzo once owned by the musi-
cian Gioacchino Rossini, and still family-run, it has charm and character.
Public spaces include a pleasant room decorated with original frescoes,
where the excellent buffet breakfast is served. Guest rooms differ in size,
but all are done in similar style, with warm colors, pleasant colored-wood
wainscoting, modern furnishings, tiled floors, and comfortable beds. Most
bathrooms are small but functional and very well kept. The largest rooms
are a good option for families.

Hotel Savoy
$$$$
Piazza della Signoria
This is our favorite luxury hotel in Florence. In-depth renovations have
brought modernity to this landmark hotel — which opened in 1896 —
while respecting the original architecture. The splendid public spaces are
completed by a small but state-of-the-art fitness room and a good restau-
rant-cum-bar. The spacious guest rooms are luxuriously appointed and
done in a refined Italian style: clean and elegant, but also warm and wel-
coming. One of the Savoy’s big draws is its special attention to children,
with games, gifts, and child-sized everything, including slippers and
bathrobes in the rooms.

Santa Maria Novella
A nice addition to the Florence hotel scene, this small lodging is a mix of
charm and modernity. The public spaces are welcoming, with glowing fire-
places in winter and a pleasant rooftop terrace in good weather. Guest rooms
are spacious and uniquely decorated: The four-poster beds, fireplaces,
antiques, and stylish modern furniture make you feel like an aristocrat from
this century — a rare opportunity. Bathrooms are modern and comfortable.

Plaza Hotel Lucchesi
$$$$
Santa Croce
This historic hotel — it opened in 1860 — was completely restored in 2001,
with good taste and attention to detail that have brought it back to its splen-
dor. We like the location at the eastern edge of the historic district. Guest
rooms are spacious and bright, with parquet floors, elegant and comfortable
wooden furnishings, and luxury fabrics that ensure a warm and welcoming
feeling. Some rooms enjoy private balconies and all afford romantic views
over the river or over Santa Croce. Bathrooms are modern and good-sized.

Yearning to be a private collector’s home, this hotel
is housed in a beautiful 14th-century palazzo, once home to the Neri
family. Guest rooms vary in style and size. The antique furnishings, origi-
nal coffered ceilings, inner garden and patio, modern bathrooms (some
with Jacuzzis), and important artworks make this hotel very desirable. The
hotel is accessible for people with disabilities. See map p. 426. Borgo Pinti 27,

This small luxury hotel, housed in the 18th-century
palazzo Ciofi-Jacometti, offers the comfort level of the top hotels in
Florence, with a warm atmosphere and unique style. It combines antique
furnishings and period architectural details — the original frescos are mag-
nificent — with Italian contemporary design. Precious fabrics, elegant wood

Dining in Florence
If enjoyed in traditional fashion, a typical Tuscan meal can take a few
hours to finish. The multiple courses begin with an appetizer, tradition-
ally affettati misti (assorted cured meats) and crostini misti (round toast
with assorted toppings such as liver pâté, mushrooms, tomatoes, and
cheese). Your first course (called the primo) could be a soup — try the
stewlike ribollita (vegetables, beans, and bread) — or pasta, such as 
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
430

pappardelle al cinghiale (wide noodles in a wild boar sauce), or crespelle
Fiorentine (crepes layered with cheese and béchamel sauce). The main
course (secondo) could be stewed or grilled meat, such as the superb bis-
tecca Fiorentina (steak of local Chianina cow, grilled and brushed with
olive oil and herbs). Veggies (contorno) are ordered separately and could
be anything from sautéed greens to patate fritte (french fries) to fagioli
all’uccelletto (stewed white Tuscan cannellini beans) — a local specialty.
Tuscany is famous across the globe for its red wines, from its Chianti
Classico — generally served as house wine at local restaurants — to Vino
Nobile di Montepulciano and Brunello di Montalcino. Its whites include
the Vernaccia di San Gimignano and the sweet dessert wine Vin Santo.
Buca Mario dal 1886

Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE
This historic restaurant serves traditional Tuscan cuisine in a friendly
atmosphere. It’s housed in a cellar (buca in Florentine), with vaulted and
whitewashed dining rooms decorated with dark-wood paneling (the décor
is original). Everything is well prepared, though it doesn’t come cheap. We
liked the classic ribollita and the osso buco, as well as the coniglio fritto
(fried rabbit), a Tuscan delicacy.

Fast food Florence-style
For a cheap but delicious meal that’ll give your wallet a rest, drop by an alimentari (gro-
cery shop) for the fixings for a picnic. You can buy some delicious Tuscan bread, local
ham and cheese, fruit, mineral water, or wine. At Consorzio Agrario Pane and Co., Piazza
San Firenze 5r, at the corner of Via Condotta (% 055-213063; Bus: A to Condotta), you’ll
find a choice of local cheeses and cured meats, including the excellent cinghiale (wild
boar), plus water, wine, and all the rest. You can also get a nice fruit tart or some paste
(cream puffs and other small sweet pastries). Or head for the colorful and noisy Mercato
Centrale, near Piazza San Lorenzo (entrance on Via dell’Ariento), where you’ll find stalls
selling all kinds of edibles, from fruit and vegetables to socks, passing by fragrant Tuscan
bread and tasty local cheeses, and cured meats. For a quick bite Florentine-style, you
can also try the centuries-old fare served at Narbone (stand no. 292 on the ground floor),
a counter with a few tables. Among the offerings: the panino col bollito (boiled beef sand-
wich in its juice) and, if you’re up to it, the trippa alla Fiorentina (tripe with tomato sauce
and Parmesan). If tripe is your thing, try lampredotto (traditional boiled tripe sandwich)
at the street stand in front of the American Express office on Piazza de’ Cimatori. To the
other end of the spectrum, the elegant Cantinetta del Verrazzano, Via dei Tavolini 18r
(% 055-268590), sells focaccia hot from the oven and wine by the glass, and also has a
small self-service lunch counter.

Cantinetta Antinori Tornabuoni
$$$
Santa Maria Novella
FLORENTINE/ITALIAN
Antinori is the family name of the oldest and one of the best producers of
wine in Italy. In this restaurant, typical Tuscan dishes and many special-
ties from the Antinori farms are served to accompany the wine. The can-
tinetta (small wine cellar) occupies the 15th-century palazzo of this noble
family and serves as their winery in town. You can sample the vintages at
the counter or sit at a table and have a full meal. The pappa al pomodoro
is delicious, as is the risotto with prawns.
See map p. 426. Piazza Antinori 3r, off the north end of Via de’ Tornabuoni. % 055-
292234. Reservations recommended. Bus: A, 6, 11, 36, or 37 to Piazza Antinori. Main
courses: 14–25 ($22–$40). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–
10 p.m. Closed 1 week at Christmas and 1 week in Aug.
Cavolo Nero
$$
Piazza del Carmine
FLORENTINE
Cavolo Nero serves great food, prepared with enthusiasm and creativity.
The name of the restaurant refers to the black cabbage (similar to kale)
that is typical of Tuscan cooking. The menu isn’t very extensive, but its
offerings are delicious. We enjoyed the homemade gnocchi with broccoli
and wild fennel, as well as the bass filet rolled in eggplant and served over
a yellow-pepper purée.

Cibreo
$$$
Santa Croce
FLORENTINE
Renowned chef-owner Fabio Picchi changes his menu daily, depending on
the market and his imagination. The backbone of the menu is historic
Tuscan, with some recipes that go back to the Renaissance — but they’re
presented here in a modern way. One hallmark of the place is that you
won’t find pasta of any kind; the other is that dinner is at 7:30 or 9 p.m. If
you choose the first service, you’ll have to be out by 9 p.m. On the menu,
you’ll find soufflés; polenta; roasted and stuffed birds — such as the
superb pigeon stuffed with a traditional fruit preparation — and the much
imitated pomodoro in gelatina (tomato aspic). For a more informal atmos-
phere and lower prices, you can try the trattoria next door (Via de’Macci
122r) or the Caffè Cibreo across the street.
See map p. 426. Via Andrea del Verrocchio 8r. % 055-234-1100. Reservations required

This is our favorite place in Florence: serving genuine Tuscan food all day
long until late at night, with some of the best Tuscan wines by the glass.
And it’s no wonder: This osteria is the urban outpost of Tuscany’s ten best
vineyards, which send a selection of their finest products here regularly.
Featuring a more formal dining room and a casual tavern, this place allows
you to choose between a complete meal or light fare; lunch is also avail-
able in either room. Ribollita, farinata al cavolo nero (thick black cabbage
soup), cinghiale in salmì (wild-boar stew), and a great choice of Tuscan
cold cuts will more than satisfy.

At this cozy, centrally located trattoria, you’ll find ubiquitous Florentine

elaborate main courses. We liked the pasta with a pork and wild-fennel
ragù, as well as the saltimbocca di rana pescatrice con ratatouille di zuc-
chine (sautéed fish and bacon bites with zucchini stew). The restaurant
also offers a tasting menu (30/$48) and many wines by the glass.

The ebullient personality of the chef-owner, Garga, has overflowed onto the

yet laid-back, this restaurant isn’t cheap. The extravagant atmosphere pairs
perfectly with his interpretations of Tuscan fundamentals. Try the famous
taglierini alla Magnifico (angel-hair pasta with a mint-cream sauce flavored
with lemon and orange rind and Parmesan cheese). Or sign up for the great
cooking classes.

Looking for a gelato break?
Ice cream is certainly one of the best treats in Italy, and Florence is famous for its
gelato. Of a different school from the Venetian, the Roman, or the Sicilian gelati,
Florentine ice cream was invented — as were many other Tuscan gastronomic spe-
cialties — to gratify the palates of the Medicis. Alas the Medici family had a very big
sweet tooth, judging from the result: Florentine ice cream is extremely sugary. You’ll
find some of the best in Florence at Gelateria Vivoli, Via Isola delle Stinche 7r, between
the Bargello and Santa Croce (% 055-292334; Bus: A to Piazza Santa Croce), which
is truly a marvel for its zillions of flavors, but also at Coronas Café, Via Calzaiuoli 72r 
(% 055-239-6139; Bus: A to Orsanmichele); Perchè No, Via dei Tavolini 19r, just off Via
Calzaiuoli (% 055-239-8969; Bus: A to Orsanmichele), one of the oldest Florentine gela-
terie; and Gelateria Carabè, Via Ricasoli 60r, near the Accademia (% 055-289476; Bus:
C or 6 to Santissima [SS] Annunziata), where you’ll find excellent Sicilian gelato: The
owner has the ingredients — lemons, almonds, pistachios — shipped from Sicily, and
his ice cream has been rated among the best in Italy.

Exploring Florence
Florence offers precious little in the way of bargains. You might consider
the Iris pass (see “Getting Around Florence,” earlier in this chapter),
which gives you a 20 percent discount on most attractions.
Reservations are not required but we highly recommend them to avoid
the long lines at Florence’s most sought-after attractions: Uffizi and
Accademia. Call % 055-294883 during office hours (Mon–Fri 8:30
a.m.–6:30 p.m., Sat 8:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m.) and pick a time slot (every 
15 minutes during opening hours; see listing later in this chapter); the
English-speaking operator will give you a confirmation number.
Alternatively, make your reservation and buy your ticket online at
www.polomuseale.firenze.it with a credit card. In either case, you
can then get to the museum only a bit before your selected time to pay
(cash only) for the ticket or pick it up. Make sure you don’t line up in the
wrong queue (you need the reserved tickets line, where at the most
you’ll find only the people in your time slot, which is 20; don’t be shy to
ask) and you’ll breeze through. The 4 ($6.40) per ticket reservation fee
is well worth it. You can always make last-minute reservations, but you’ll

Florence’s top attractions
The compact medieval district of Florence is an attraction unto itself,
developing around Piazza del Duomo with its stunning cathedral and,
several blocks to the south, Piazza della Signoria, a statue-filled elegant
square lined with cafes, the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, and the art-
packed Galleria degli Uffizi. The long north–south stretch of Via dei
Calzaiuoli, a wide, pedestrian-choked promenade, links the two piazze
(squares), and leads to the River Arno, bisecting the historic district
east–west. Ponte Vecchio, the only surviving medieval bridge in
Florence, is the most picturesque way to Oltrarno, the neighborhood on
the left bank of the river; included within the walls of Florence “only” in
1173, it has Palazzo Pitti and an artsy and active cultural life.
Bargello Museum
What the Uffizi is to Renaissance painting, the Bargello is to sculpture from
the same period. You can spend 45 minutes here or, if you get really

engrossed, two hours. The collection includes works by Michelangelo,
including his famous tipsy Bacchus, the Madonna of the Stairs, and a Bust
of Brutus that may be a semi–self-portrait. Be sure to see the works by
Donatello, the first great sculptor of the Renaissance. A huge second-floor
room contains some of his masterpieces, including a mischievous bronze
Cupid and two versions of a David — an early marble work and a bronze
that depicts the biblical hero as a young boy.

Duomo (Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore), Baptistery, Giotto’s Bell
Tower, and Museo dell’Opera
The Duomo of Florence is decorated in festive white, green, and pink
marble, with an extravagant neo-Gothic facade from the 18th century, all
capped by a huge brick-red dome that extends nobly into the skyline. The

A bit of Florentine history
The first town to develop in the area was not Florence but Fiesole, up the hill overlook-
ing what was to become Florence. Fiesole began thriving in the ninth century B.C. and
grew to become an important Etruscan center. During Roman rule, though, it lost impor-
tance, and Florence was born on its splendid location by the Arno River. A flourishing but
small village until medieval times, Florence suddenly developed into a town when it grew
to be a great banking center, dominating the European credit market. The town’s wealth
encouraged the development of the arts and of a lively culture: from Dante (born here
in 1265) to Cimabue (Giotto’s teacher), and more when the Renaissance blossomed in the
1300s, despite difficulties such as floods, the black plague, and political upheaval that
deterred it elsewhere.
The 15th century brought the rule of Lorenzo the Magnificent, head of the powerful
Medici clan, and the town reached its apogee. By this point, Florence had become the
leading city-state in central Italy, overcoming the competition of nearby Siena and
Pisa. Artists such as Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael produced amazing works.
After a brief restoration of the republic, in 1537, the Medici family returned to power
in the person of Cosimo I, but it was the end of the Renaissance. The Inquisition began
in 1542, suffocating cultural life, while Italy became the appetizing booty of the suc-
cession wars among royal families in Europe. Florence Gran Duchy resisted as such
and passed to the Lorraine house, which maintained its power and independence
through the 17th and 18th centuries, passing then to the Bourbon. In 1860, the popu-
lation rebelled and was able to join the burgeoning Italian kingdom. Florence was then
made the capital of Italy for five short years, from 1865 to 1870, when the capital finally
moved to Rome.

cathedral is joined on its bustling square by its bell tower, baptistery, and
museum — a group of buildings that together take about four hours to see.
If you’re pressed for time, limit your visit to the baptistery (only open in
the afternoon) and the cathedral’s outside. Climbing either Brunelleschi’s
dome (463 steps) or Giotto’s bell tower (414 steps) takes about an hour.
The largest in the world at the time it was built, the Duomo’s dome is 45m
(150 ft.) wide and 104m (300 ft.) high from the drum to the distinctive
lantern at the top of the cupola. Great Renaissance architect Brunelleschi
had to take over the project where the previous builders left off, unsure of
how to complete the building without having it collapse. His ingenious
solution was constructing the dome of two layers enclosing a space inside,
and having each layer become progressively thinner toward the top, thus
reducing the weight. If you’re up to it, climb the 463 spiraling steps hidden
in the space between the layers to see this architectural marvel from the
inside. In the crypt are the remains of Santa Reparata, the earlier Duomo,
and archaeological excavations going back to ancient Roman times. Be
sure to wander to the back-left corner of the cathedral to admire the
bronze doors to the New Sacristy (by Luca della Robbia). Monday through
Saturday you can enjoy free tours, given every 40 minutes from 10:30 a.m.
to noon and 3 to 4:20 p.m.
To the right of the cathedral is what’s known as Giotto’s bell tower, even
though that early Renaissance painter died after completing only the first
two levels and other architects finished it. The tower became “The Lily of
Florence,” a 277-foot-high marble pillar with slender windows. If climbing
the Duomo’s dome didn’t tire you out, try clambering up this monument,
too — and without the crowds found at the dome. The view’s not quite so
sweeping, but you get a great close-up of the neighboring dome.
The baptistery, across from the Duomo, is the oldest building of the group,
dating back to between the fourth and seventh centuries. Its north and
east bronze doors, covered with relief panels, are the life’s work of Lorenzo
Ghiberti and considered one of the world’s most important pieces of
Renaissance sculpture; Michelangelo once called them “The Gates of
Paradise,” and the name stuck. These large panels show the artist’s skill in
using perspective and composition to tell complicated stories (these are
replicas — the originals are in the Museo dell’Opera; see the following
paragraph). Inside, glittering 13th-century mosaics cover the baptistery,
and a cone-shaped ceiling contains a highly detailed Last Judgment scene
presided over by an enormous Christ.
Definitely worth visiting is the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo (Museum of
Cathedral Works), located right behind the cathedral at Piazza del Duomo 9.
The museum holds all the works of art removed from the outside of the
cathedral, baptistery, and bell tower in order to save them from the ele-
ments. You’ll find Ghiberti’s bronze Gates of Paradise panels from the bap-
tistery and Donatello’s highly realistic sculpture of Habbakuk and his Mary
Magdalene in polychromed wood from Giotto’s bell tower. You’ll also see
one of Michelangelo’s Pietà and Luca della Robbia’s cantoria (choir loft)
facing a similar work by Donatello, offering an example of the diversity of
Renaissance styles.

Galleria degli Uffizi
Housed in the administrative offices of the Tuscan Duchy (uffizi means
“offices”), the gallery is a visual primer on the growth of the Renaissance
from the 13th to the 18th centuries, and one of the world’s best art gal-
leries. You can easily spend all day here, finding room after room of rec-
ognized masterpieces, but you can see the highlights in two hours.
Your exploration of the Uffizi gets off to a fast start in the first room with
a trio of giant Maestà paintings tracing the birth of the Renaissance — from
the rigid, Byzantine style of Cimabue, through Gothic elements from
Sienese great Duccio, to the innovative work by Giotto, who broke paint-
ing out of its static mold and gave it life, movement, depth, and emotion.
From there, you move through rooms featuring the work of early Sienese
masters, such as Pietro Lorenzetti and Simone Martini, and then continue
on to Florentine and other Tuscan virtuosos such as Fra Angelico,
Masaccio, Piero della Francesca, Paolo Uccello, and Filippo Lippi.
Next, you enter a huge room dedicated to Botticelli and focused on his two
most famous works, The Birth of Venus (the woman rising out of a seashell)
and The Allegory of Spring, and his contemporary Ghirlandaio, who taught
a young Michelangelo how to fresco. After this, you can see works by
Signorelli and Perugino; a young Leonardo da Vinci’s Annunciation; and
rooms filled with northern European art from the pre- and early Renaissance
eras (Dürer, Cranach, Hans Holbein the Younger) and Venetian masters such
as Correggio, Bellini, and Giorgione.
After you move to the second corridor, Michelangelo’s colorful Holy Family
signals your entry into the High Renaissance. Michelangelo’s use of star-
tling colors and his attention to detail in the twisting bodies influenced a
generation of artists called mannerists, whose paintings are on display in
the next few rooms. Works by mannerist artists (Rosso Fiorentino,
Pontormo, Andrea del Sarto, and Parmigianino) are mixed with paintings
by such famous names as Raphael, Titian, and Caravaggio. At press time,
work was ongoing on the renovation for the upgrading of the exhibit space,
but visits to the gallery were not affected.

Galleria dell’Accademia (Michelangelo’s David)
Many visitors come to Florence with one question on their lips: “Which
way to the David?” and forget that the Accademia contains many other
works of art, including magnificent paintings by Perugino, Botticelli, and
Pontormo, among others.
In 1501, Michelangelo took a huge piece of marble that a previous sculp-
tor had declared unusable and by 1504 had carved a Goliath-sized David,
a masterpiece of the male nude. David stood in front of the Palazzo Vecchio
until 1873 (a replica is there now); the location inside this gallery makes
the sculpture look a little oversized, giving it an awkward feel. In 1991,
David was attacked by a lunatic with a hammer, so you have to view him
through a reinforced-glass shield (like the Pietà in Rome). The hall leading
to the David is lined with other sculptures, including Michelangelo’s unfin-
ished Slaves — muscular figures which seem to be struggling to emerge
from their stony prisons.
You can pop in and admire David in about 20 minutes, but it takes at least
45 minutes to wander through the rest of the Accademia’s collection.

Palazzo Pitti and Giardino di Boboli
On the south side of the River Arno, this huge palace, once home to the
Medici grand dukes, now houses several museums and an impressive
painting gallery, the Galleria Palatina. These lavish rooms are appointed
to look much the way they did in the 1700s, with works by a mind-boggling
list of late-Renaissance and baroque geniuses such as Caravaggio, Rubens,
Perugino, Giorgione, Guido Reni, Fra Bartolomeo, Tintoretto, Botticelli, and
many more. The selection of works by Raphael, Titian, and Andrea del
Sarto is particularly good. Your ticket to the Galleria Palatina also allows
for admission to the Royal Apartments, the residence of three ruling fam-
ilies — Medici, Lorena, and finally Savoy during the brief time that Florence
was the capital of Italy in the 1870s — a sight to behold with their rich fab-
rics, frescoes, and oil paintings.
As for other sites in the palazzo, the Modern Art Gallery has some good
works by the Macchiaioli school, the Tuscan version of Impressionism.
The Galleria del Costume (Costume Gallery) has some wonderful dresses
that date back to the 1500s. The Museo degli Argenti (Silver Museum) is
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 439

a decorative arts collection that shows off the grand duke’s consistently
bad taste but does have kitsch appeal.
Designed between 1549 and 1656, and located behind the Pitti Palace, the
Giardino di Boboli is the world’s most grandiose example of Italianate
garden. This expanse of 4.5 hectares (11 acres) of gardens features stat-
ues, fountains, grottoes, a rococo kaffehaus for summer refreshment, and
some nice wooded areas to walk in. Take the Viottolone — literally “large
lane” — lined with laurels, cypresses, and pines and punctuated by stat-
ues to Piazzale dell’Isolotto, with the beautiful Fontana dell’Oceano
(Ocean Fountain). In the park, you’ll also find several pavilions, such as
the 18th-century neoclassical Palazzina della Meridiana, and the elegant
Casino del Cavaliere — built in the 17th century as a retreat for the
Granduca and dominating the whole park from the top of the hill. It houses
the Porcelain Museum, including Sèvres, Chantilly, and Meissen pieces as
they were used at the tables of the three reigning families that resided in
the palace.
You’d be hard-pressed to visit all the museums and the Giardino di Boboli
in one day, but if you’re short for time, take two hours to run through the
Galleria Palatina and the Royal Apartments, and reserve an hour for the
gardens.

Santa Croce, Cappella de’ Pazzi, and Museo dell’Opera 
di Santa Croce
This large Franciscan church on the city’s western edge is the Westminster
Abbey of the Renaissance. The church houses the tombs of several house-
hold names: Michelangelo, composer Rossini (Barber of Seville and the
William Tell Overture), political thinker/writer Machiavelli, and astronomer
and physicist Galileo. The church also has a monument to poetic giant
Dante Alighieri, who was exiled from his beloved Florence on trumped-up
charges during a period of political turmoil, and whose bones rest in the
city of Ravenna, where he died just after completing his masterpiece, the
Divine Comedy (of which the famed Inferno is but one-third).
Inside you can also see two chapels covered by the frescoes of Giotto, the
ex-shepherd who became the forefather of the Renaissance in the early
14th century, but they are not well preserved. Near the chapels, a 
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
440

corridor leads through the gift shop to the famed leather school (pricey,
but very high quality).
Admission to the church also gets you into the splendid 15th century
Cappella de’ Pazzi, designed by Brunelleschi, and the Museo dell’Opera
di Santa Croce. This museum houses many of the artistic victims of the
1966 Arno flood, including Cimabue’s Crucifix, as well as several art pieces
taken from the church itself and the cloisters, such as the splendid sculp-
ture of San Ludovico da Tolosa by Donatello. Enter through a door to the
right of the church facade.

More cool things to see and do
 If you’re a fan of Michelangelo, you should not miss the Medici
Chapels, Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini, behind the church of
San Lorenzo (% 055-238-8602), where his sculptures are lavishly
distributed over the Medicis’ monumental tombs in a space that is
considered the founding work of the Mannerist style. Admission is
4 ($6.40). It’s open daily 8:15 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. (ticket booth closes
30 minutes earlier); closed second and fourth Sundays and first,
third, and fifth Mondays of each month, as well as January 1, May 1,
and December 25.
 How are your negotiation skills? Striking a bargain at the outdoor
leather market by San Lorenzo church, with stalls peddling imita-
tion Gucci merchandise, souvenir T-shirts, jewelry, wallets, and lots
of leather might not be easy but could be fun. The carnival of
colors and noise is a welcome, down-to-earth break from all that
art, and you can buy interesting goods at a reasonable price. Just
be alert to pickpockets. The stalls stay open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
(later if business is booming) daily March through October, and
Tuesday through Saturday November through February.
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 441
The birth of opera
The story goes that, in 1589, the Medici organized a wedding reception in the Giardino
di Boboli at the Palazzo Pitti and, of course, wanted something grand. They hired the
best local composers of the time — Jacopo Peri and Ottavio Rinuccini — to provide
musical entertainment. They came up with the idea of setting a classical story to music
and having actors sing the whole thing, as in a modern musical. The show was a great
success and the Medici added another feather at their caps: the birth of opera.

 Florence shares the top spot on the hill of Italian high fashion with
Milan, and shopping on Via de’ Tornabuoni is a great experience,
with the flagship stores of Pucci, Gucci, Beltrami, and Ferragamo
for fashion and Buccellati for jewelry and silver. Other great names
of Italian fashion and design line the nearby streets of Via della
Vigna Nuova and Via Strozzi, from Italy’s fashion guru Armani and
Enrico Coveri for fashion, to Controluce for some beautifully
designed light fixtures.
 You can experience a bit of Tuscan countryside with a ride on
Florence’s no. 7 bus to the village of Fiesole. Older than Florence
and overlooking it from above, this hilltop Etruscan village has a
few sights, cafes on the main square, and best of all, a cool moun-
tain breeze on even the hottest summer days. The combination
ticket Biglietto Fiesole Musei includes admission to all the local
attractions for 10 ($16). A tourist office (Piazza Mino 37; % 055-
598720; www.comune.fiesole.fi.it) is on your right as you step
off the bus in Fiesole. Stop by the 11th-century cathedral, which
contains some delicate Mino da Fiesole carvings, and then go up
(way up) Via San Francesco to the panoramic gardens overlooking
a picture-perfect view of Florence down in the valley. Perhaps the
most popular sight in Fiesole is the ruins of the Roman theater and
baths, Teatro Romano and Museo Civico, Via Partigiani 1 (% 055-
59477; www.fiesolemusei.it), an excavation that has a temple
from the fourth century B.C., a theater from the first century B.C.
(which now hosts summertime concerts under the stars), and a few
arches still standing from some first-century-A.D. baths. Admission
is free, and it’s open October through March Thursday through
Monday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and April through September Wednesday
through Monday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Guided tours
We like the hop-on/hop-off bus tour run by City Sightseeing (% 800-
424500; www.firenze.city-sightseeing.it); 24-hour tickets cost
20 ($32) adults, 10 ($16) children 5 to 15, and are valid on their two
loop lines: A, making 15 stops between SMN train station and Piazzale
Michelangelo (every 30 minutes daily), and B, making 24 stops between
Porta San Frediano in Oltrarno and Fiesole (every hour daily). Tickets
are for sale onboard or are included in the special bus ticket Passpartour
(see “Getting Around Florence” earlier in this chapter).
Suggested itineraries
If you don’t like tour buses and would prefer to discover Florence and
the surrounding region on your own, this section provides some sug-
gested plans of attack.
If you have one day
If you only have one day in Florence, you’ll have to start bright and
early. Head to the Galleria dell’Accademia (where you have made
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
442

advance reservations), strolling on your way through Piazza Santissima
Annunziata — one of Florence’s nicest squares — and maybe stopping
for a gelato at Carabé. If you’re not keen on the David, head instead for
the Bargello Museum, near Piazza della Signoria, Florence’s best sculp-
ture museum. Make your way then to the Duomo, enjoying the sight of
the cathedral and of Giotto’s bell tower, but linger only in the baptis-
tery, since you’re short on time. After your visit, lunch with a sample of
cheeses and cured meats from the Tuscan countryside at Consorzio
Agrario Pane and Co., waiting for your set time for the Galleria degli
Uffizi, where you also made advance reservations. Once you’re satu-
rated with Renaissance paintings, walk around Piazza della Signoria,
taking in Palazzo Vecchio, and then head for Ponte Vecchio on Via Por
Santa Maria, crossing over to Oltrarno, checking some of the shops on
your way. After a nice stroll along the Arno, it’s now time for aperitivo,
and what best then to sample the Florentine invention Negroni? Try it at
Giacosa, Via de’ Tornabuoni 83r (% 055-239-6226; Bus: 6, 11, 36, or 37
to Tornabuoni). For dinner, treat yourself at Cibreo.
If you have two days
Start Day 1 as in the itinerary in the preceding section, visiting also the
Bargello but reserving the Duomo for the next day. Have lunch at Osteria
Ganino. Continue your day at the Galleria degli Uffizidlis where you’ve
made an advance reservation. After your visit, spend the rest of your
afternoon and evening exploring Ponte Vecchio, Palazzo Vecchio, and
Piazza della Signoria.
On Day 2, start off with a visit to the church of San Lorenzo and the
Medici Chapels behind it. You can also stroll through the Mercato San
Lorenzo for some shopping. Have lunch at Le Mossacce before heading
for the Duomo, with Giotto’s bell tower and the baptistery. Continue
with the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. Finish your day with an aperitivo
and dinner as in the preceding “If you have one day” itinerary.
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as indicated in the preceding section. On the
morning of Day 3, head for the Basilica Santa Croce and visit the
Cappella de’ Pazzi and the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce. Don’t
forget to have a look at the leather goods of the Scuola del Cuoio di
Santa Croce in the convent compound. Have lunch at the Osteria del
Caffè Italiano. In the afternoon, head for Palazzo Pitti and the Giardino
di Boboli. End your day with a stroll and dinner in Oltrarno, maybe at
Cavolo Nero.
Traveling Beyond Florence
Several worthwhile sites make easy day trips from Florence, including
Pisa, Siena, and San Gimignano. Each stop has its own unique allure.
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 443

Pisa: The Leaning Tower and more
Pisa is much more than its famous Leaning Tower: Its medieval alleys
and buildings overlooking the curving Arno are little visited yet offer
some of Italy’s nicest riverside views.
You won’t need more than three or four hours to visit Pisa’s most
famous attractions, but you’d miss much: Pisa deserves being explored
and knows how to reward its visitors. If you have the time, try to spend
at least one night.
Getting there
Trains leave Florence for Pisa every half-hour; the trip takes an hour and
costs about 5 ($8). From the rail station, shuttle A (or a 15-minute
walk) takes you across the Arno to the Leaning Tower.
A tiny tourism office sits to the left of the train station exit (% 050-42291),
but the main tourism office is just outside the Porta Santa Maria gate 
on the west end of the Campo dei Miracoli at Via C. Cammeo 2 (% 050-
560464; www.pisa.turismo.toscana.it).
Seeing the sights
You can get a cumulative ticket for your choice of two (6/$9.60) or all
five (10/$16) of the attractions in Campo dei Miracoli (Duomo, Cemetery,
Baptistery, Museo delle Sinopie, Museo dell’Opera del Duomo).
If you’d like to see Pisa via a guided tour from Florence, American
Express (% 055-50981) and SitaSightseeing (% 055-214721) in
Florence both offer tours of Pisa for about 26 ($42).
The Campo dei Miracoli — also called Piazza del Duomo — is Pisa’s
monumental piazza and one of the most picturesque squares in Italy.
Built in medieval times abutting the city walls, it’s covered with shining
green grass — a perfect background for the carved marble masterpieces
in the monumental compound.
Pisa’s Duomo (% 050-560-547; www.opapisa.it) is a magnificent
cathedral from the 11th century, with a 13th-century facade of stacked
colonnades. Make sure that you see the 12th-century bronze doors at
the south entrance, the only set to survive a 1595 fire. The cathedral’s
interior was rebuilt after the fire, but some items from the earlier era
remain — including the Christ Pancrator mosaic and Cimabue’s St. John
Evangelist in the apse, and one of Giovanni Pisano’s greatest carved 
pulpits (1302–1311), a masterpiece of Gothic sculpture. Admission is 
2 ($3.20) adults, free for children 9 and under. The Duomo is open
November through December 24 and January 8 through February 28
daily from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m.; December 25 through
January 7 daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; March 1 through March 13 daily

October daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Sun and holidays open only after 
1 p.m.). Last admission 30 minutes earlier.
The cathedral bell tower, better known as the Leaning Tower, is attrac-
tive enough to draw attention even if it didn’t tilt so curiously. Threaded
with colonnade arches, it is one of the prettiest towers you may ever
see. Because all that marble is too heavy for the sandy soil to support,
the tower started tilting right away in the 12th century. Builders tried to
correct the tilt during construction, giving the tower a slight banana-like
curve. In 1990, engineers determined that the tower’s slant — 15 feet
from center — made it too dangerous for visitors, and the tower was

closed; it sat with steel bands belted around it and ugly lead weights
stacked on one side until 70 tons of soil from the foundation’s high side
were removed so that the tower could gradually tip back. When, in
December 2001, the tower was deemed safe (now only 131⁄2 feet off-
center), it was reopened to the public — but with a new and highly
restricted admissions policy. Guided visits last 30 minutes and are lim-
ited to 20 people. Available slots sell fast, particularly in high season, so
if you’re keen on the climb make your reservations a minimum of two
weeks in advance at % 050-560547 or www.opapisa.it (with an addi-
tional reservation fee of 2/$3.20). Admission is 15 ($24). The tower is
open November through December 24 and January 8 through February
28 daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; December 25 through January 7 daily
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; March 1 through March 13 daily from 9 a.m. to 
6 p.m.; March 14 through March 20 daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; March 21
through June 13 and September 5 through September 30 daily from 
8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.; June 14 through September 4 daily from 8:30 a.m.
to 11 p.m.; and in October daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
There are no elevators in the Leaning Tower, and access is through the
original — and very narrow — staircase. It’s 300 steps to the top — it’s
impossible to stop or turn around — and there are passages in the open
making the climb physically and psychologically taxing. Anybody suffer-
ing from vertigo or claustrophobia or with a heart condition should not
attempt it. Children 7 and under are not allowed in the tower, and chil-
dren 17 and under are allowed only if accompanied by an adult. You’ll
need to hold the hand of your children ages 8 to 12 during the climb.
The other sites on the square are the Camposanto, the Baptistery, the
Museo delle Sinopie, and the Museo dell’Opera del Duomo. The long
wall of Gothic carved marble marks the Camposanto, the monumental
cemetery filled with holy dirt from Golgotha (Calvary) in Palestine —
where Christ was crucified — brought back by Pisan ships after a
Crusade. It was the burial ground for Pisa’s constables, who had their
tombs richly decorated with sarcophagi, statues, and marble bas-reliefs.
Allied firebombs in World War II destroyed most of the dazzling medieval
frescoes that covered the walls, but the few that were salvaged —
including the macabre Triumph of Death — are on display in a side room.
Across the square from the Camposanto, obscured by souvenir stands,

A picnic in Pisa
Whether you want to buy food or not, the food market on Piazza delle Vettovaglie, a
few steps north of Ponte di Mezzo, is a wonderful sight. Located here since the Middle
Ages, it’s a lively affair held Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., where
food producers from the countryside offer their specialties for sale. You can get the
makings for a great picnic, to enjoy perhaps along the riverbanks: fresh produce,
Tuscan bread and cured meats, fruit, and all the fixings.

is the Museo delle Sinopie (temporarily closed for restoration at press
time), which contains the sinopie, or preparatory drawings, of the ill-
fated frescoes. Behind the Leaning Tower is the Museo dell’Opera del
Duomo, preserving many statues and other works that decorated the
Duomo and Baptistery. Admission is 5 ($8) adults, free for children 9
and under. It’s open November through December 24 and January 8
through February 28 daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; December 25 through
January 7 daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; March 1 through March 13 daily 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m.; March 14 through March 20 daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; March 21
through September daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; and in October daily 9 a.m. to
7 p.m. Last admission 30 minutes earlier.
The monuments on Campo dei Miracoli steal the show in Pisa, but the
National Museum of San Matteo, Lungarno Mediceo-Piazza San Matteo,
near Piazza Mazzini (% 050-541865) should not be overlooked and will
give you the opportunity for a stroll along Pisa’s famed Lungarni (river
promenades). The museum holds a stunning collection of Renaissance
art (one of the best in the world). Important masterpieces include the
1426 painting San Paolo by Masaccio, two paintings of the Madonna con i
Santi by Ghirlandaio, the sculpture of the Madonna del Latte by Andrea
and Nino Pisano, and sculptures by Donatello. Consider one or two
hours to visit this museum. Admission is 5 ($8) adults, free for children
9 and under. The museum is open Tuesday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 
7 p.m., Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. It’s closed January 1, May 1, August 15,
and December 25.
Where to stay and dine
The Hotel Relais dell’Orologio, Via della Faggiola 12–14 (% 050-830361;
Fax: 050-551869; www.hotelrelaisorologio.com; rack rates: 350–400/
$560–$640 double, including breakfast), is a historic medieval mansion
only steps from Campo dei Miracoli, which opened as a hotel in 2004. You’ll
be comfortable and stay in style. For terrific Pisan cuisine in a traditional
trattoria setting, head just north of the city walls to Antica Trattoria Da
Bruno, Via Luigi Bianchi 12 (% 050-560818; www.pisaonline.it/
trattoriadabruno; open Mon 12:15–2:30 p.m., Wed–Sun 12:15–2:30 p.m.
and 7:15–10:30 p.m.).
Siena: A departure from the Renaissance
This lovely town in Tuscany is an overgrown medieval hill town, where
you find brick-and-marble palaces and cafes, not museums and bou-
tiques. Siena has its own proud artistic tradition, which relies on emo-
tion, elegance of line, and rich color — a shift from Florence’s precise,
formula-driven, exacting classical painting.
Many people spend only half a day in Siena, but try to spend at least one
night so that you have a good day and a half to absorb its medieval
atmosphere and see its scattered sights.
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 447

Getting there
Siena lies 62km (37 miles) south of Florence. The newly introduced Pisa
Airport shuttle bus from Pisa Airport takes you to Siena in about two
hours. The bus is offered by TRA-IN (% 0577-204246; www.trainspa.it),
costs 14 ($22), and can be reserved in advance at % 800-905183 or
through the Siena tourist office (see the following paragraph). Siena is also
best reached by bus because the bus station in Piazza Gramsci (off the La
Lizza pedestrian gallery) is only steps from the town center. TRA-IN and
SITA (% 800-373760; www.sita-on-line.it) offer regular service from
Florence (from SITA bus station near SMN train station); the trip takes 
75 minutes and costs about 5 ($8), with buses leaving every half-hour.
Siena’s rail station (% 0577-280115) is on Piazza Fratelli Rosselli, about
2.5km (11⁄2 miles) downhill from the town center. The train trip from
Florence takes about 90 minutes and costs about 6 ($9.60). You then 
have to take a taxi or a minibus (Line C to Piazza Gramsci).
The tourist office (% 0577-280551; www.terresiena.it) is at Piazza
del Campo 56 in Siena.
Seeing the sights
The Biglietto Unico Musei covers the main museums in town (Museo
Civico, Pinacoteca Nazionale, Santa Maria della Scala, Duomo and
Piccolomini Library, and State Archives) for 14 ($22). You can purchase
it from the tourist office and from the travel agency Vacanze Senesi
(www.bookingsiena.it).
If you’re planning to see everything in town, the Siena Itinerari d’Arte
(SIA) Pass (including Museo dell’Opera, Baptistery, Oratorio di San
Bernardino and Museum, Palazzo delle Papesse, Santa Maria della Scala,
Museo Civico, and Sant’Agostino) is the ticket for you: It exists in winter
(Nov 2–Feb 28 for 13/$21) and summer (Mar 1–Nov 1 for 16/$26) ver-
sions and is valid for seven days.
Those who are less ambitious, or have less time, can take advantage of
the Biglietto Cumulativo Musei Comunali, which includes entrance to
Museo Civico, Palazzo delle Papesse, and Santa Maria della Scala for 10
($16) and is valid for two days, or the Biglietto Cumulativo Opera
Duomo, which also costs 10 ($16), is valid three days, and includes
admission to the Duomo, Museo dell’Opera, Baptistery, Crypt, and
Oratorio di San Bernardino with Museum.
American Express (% 055-50981) teams with CAF Tours, Via Roma 4
(% 055-283200; www.caftours.com), for an all-day excursion from
Florence that includes both Siena and San Gimignano, described later in
this chapter, for 60 ($96).
At the center of the city is Il Campo, a beautiful, fan-shaped brick area
that slopes down to the Palazzo Pubblico (1297–1310). You can climb the
503 steps of its bell tower, the Torre di Mangia, to get an unforgettable
view over the city’s burnt-sienna rooftops out to the green countryside
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
448

beyond. You can also visit the Museo Civico (% 0577-292226), for a look
at the palazzo’s beautiful frescoes, including the greatest secular fresco
to survive from medieval Europe: Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s Allegory of Good
and Bad Government and Its Effect on the Town and Countryside, wrapping
around three walls and depicting the medieval ideal of civic life. Admission
is 7 ($11) for the museum and 6 ($9.60) for the tower; a combined
ticket is 10 ($16). The museum is open March 16 to October 31 daily 
10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and November 1 to March 15 daily 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
(until 6:30 p.m. Dec 25–Jan 6). The tower is open March 16 to October 31
daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and November 1 to March 15 daily 10 a.m. to 
4 p.m. (closed Dec 25).
Siena’s other grand sight, the Duomo, Piazza del Duomo (% 0577-283048;
www.operaduomo.siena.it), is a huge zebra-striped Gothic structure
with a facade by Giovanni Pisano and an interior with a floor that com-
bines inlaid, carved, and mosaic marble panels (1372–1547). At the right
transept is the Chigi Chapel, designed by the baroque master Bernini.
Nicola Pisano’s best pulpit is at the start of the left transept; the intri-
cately carved Gothic panels (which his son, Giovanni, helped create)
depict the life of Christ in great detail. Off the left aisle is the entrance to
the Libreria Piccolomini, which Umbrian master Pinturicchio filled with
frescoed scenes from the life of Pope Pius II. Just outside this room is a
large marble altar that holds statuettes of Sts. Peter, Paul, and Gregory,
carved by a 26-year-old Michelangelo. Admission to the Duomo is free;
entry fee for the library is 3 ($4.80) except during the exposure of the
floor when admission for the Duomo plus the library is 6 ($9.60). It’s
open March through May and September through October Monday
through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and Sunday and holidays
from 1:30 to 5:30 p.m.; June through August Monday through Saturday
from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday and holidays from 1:30 to 6 p.m.; and
November through February Monday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m. and Sunday and holidays 1:30 to 5:30 p.m. Hours vary during the
exposure of the floor.
If you walk down the steep stairs around the Duomo’s right side and turn
around at the bottom, you see the Baptistery, Piazza San Giovanni, behind
the Duomo (% 0577-283048), which was built under the cathedral. Inside
is a font with bronze panels by some of the early Renaissance’s greatest
sculptors: Donatello, Ghiberti, and Siena’s Jacopo della Quercia. Creative
frescoes from the 15th century (look for the alligator) cover the walls 
and ceiling. Admission is 3 ($4.80), and it’s open November through
February daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; March through May and September
through October daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and June through August
daily from 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (closed Jan 1 and Dec 25).
About 700 years ago, Siena started building an ambitious expansion of its
cathedral that would have turned the present Duomo into just a portion of
the grand new structure, but the Black Death hit in 1348, killing 75 percent
of the town’s population. The Museo dell’Opera Metropolitana, Piazza
Jacopo della Quercia, adjacent to Piazza del Duomo (% 0577-283048;
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 449

www.operaduomo.siena.it), now fills the structure and holds artwork
removed from the Duomo for preservation, such as the splendid statues
that Giovanni Pisano carved for the Duomo’s facade, as well as Pietro
Lorenzetti’s beautiful triptych The Birth of the Virgin. In the museum, you
can climb several worn staircases up onto the wall of the unfinished
nave for great views across the city. Admission is 6 ($9.60); the
museum is open March through May and September through October
daily from 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.; June through August daily from 9:30 a.m.
to 8 p.m.; and November through February daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(closed Jan 1 and Dec 25).
For more art, head across the Duomo to the former hospital of Santa Maria
della Scala, Piazza Duomo 2 (% 0577-224811; http://santamaria.
comune.siena.it), to admire its lavishly frescoed rooms. Admission is 
6 ($9.60); it’s open daily 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (ticket booth closes 
30 minutes earlier).
If you’re eager for a respite from history and art, visit the Enoteca
Italiana Permanente, Via Camollia 72 (% 0577-288811; www.enoteca-
italiana.it), Italy’s official wine-tasting bar, with over 700 labels in
stock. Together with the newly opened restaurant Millevini (open
Mon–Sat noon to 3 p.m. and 7–10 p.m.), it fills the echoing brick halls
and cellars of the 16th-century Fortezza Medicea fortress in Siena’s
northwest corner. Glasses range from 2 to 8 ($3.20–$13), and it’s open
Monday noon to 8 p.m. and Tuesday through Saturday noon to 1 a.m.
Where to stay and dine
The recently opened Grand Hotel Continental, Banchi di Sopra 85 
(% 0577-56011; Fax: 0577-560-1535; www.royaldemeure.com; Rack
rates: 420–560/$672–$896 double), housed in a beautifully frescoed
historic palazzo, is the best in town.
Another of our favorites is Hotel Scacciapensieri, Strada di
Scacciapensieri 10 (% 0577-41441; Fax: 0577-270854; Rack rates: 
195–305/$312–$488 double, including buffet breakfast), a 19th-
century villa a short distance (2.4km/11⁄2 miles) from the historic 
district, and great amenities: the swimming pool is heavenly if you’re
visiting in the hot season.
Good, solid Sienese food is available at Antica Trattoria Papei, Piazza
del Mercato 6, behind the Palazzo Pubblico (% 0577-280894; open
Tues–Sun 12:15–2:30 p.m. and 7:15–10 p.m.). For a truly special experi-
ence, though, head to Le Logge, Via del Porrione 33 (% 0577-48013;
open Mon–Sat 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–10:30 p.m.), a celebrated gour-
met restaurant where you can enjoy wonderful creative Sienese food.
San Gimignano: Hills and towers
Perhaps the most famous of Tuscany’s hill towns, San Gimignano bristles
with 14 medieval towers that are remnants of the days when tiny city-
states such as this were full of feuding families that sometimes went to
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
450

war right in the middle of town. Although no other city in Italy has saved
so many of its towers, what you see today is only a fraction of what used
to be there; San Gimignano sported at least 70 towers in the 13th and 14th
centuries. Although this little town is often packed with day-trippers, you
won’t find any other spot with such a profound Middle Ages flavor.
You can see San Gimignano in two to three hours, but smart travelers
know that all the day-trippers head for their tour buses at dusk, leaving
wonderful medieval towns like this virtually untouched. Those who
spend the night can absorb the ancient village atmosphere and get to
know the locals.
Getting there
The easiest way to reach San Gimignano is by bus from Siena: TRA-IN
(% 0577-204246; www.trainspa.it) offers regular service; the trip
takes about 50 minutes and costs 4 ($6.40). From Florence, you need to
first reach the town of Poggibonsi by train or bus (SITA; Via Santa
Caterina 17, west of the SMN train station; % 800-373760; www.sita-
on-line.it) and then switch to the local bus to San Gimignano — 
possible but laborious. You’re better off joining a guided tour from Florence
(see “Seeing the sights” in the Siena section, earlier in this chapter).
The tourism office (% 0577-940-008; www.sangimignano.com) is at
Piazza del Duomo 1.
Seeing the sights
The small town center consists of two interlocked, irregularly shaped
squares, with a 13th-century well in the center of one and the Collegiata
(main church) taking up one end of the other. If you can’t resist climbing
up one of the looming towers, go to the Museo Civico/Torre Grossa 
(% 0577-990312). After you admire paintings in the gallery by artists
such as Pinturicchio, Gozzoli, and Lippo Memmi (and secular 14th-
century frescoes in an anteroom that show the racier side of medieval
courtship), you can climb the tallest remaining tower in town (54m/
178 ft.), which provides a 360-degree view of the town and the rolling
green countryside just outside its walls. Admission is 4 ($6.40), and 
the museum is open March through October daily 9:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
and November through February daily 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (Dec 24 
10 a.m.–1:30 p.m., Dec 25 and 31 10 a.m.–5 p.m., and Jan 1 12:30–5 p.m.;
closed Jan 31).
The Collegiata, Piazza del Duomo (% 0577-940316) has no bishop’s
seat and, therefore, technically, is no longer a duomo (cathedral), but it
sure is decorated to look like one. The interior walls are completely cov-
ered with a colorful collage of 14th- and 15th-century frescoes. The ones
down the left wall tell Old Testament stories; the right wall features the
New Testament. A St. Sebastian thick with arrows is against the entrance
wall, and near the entrance — high on the interior nave wall — spreads a
gruesomely colorful Last Judgment scene. Off the right aisle is the tiny
Chapter 20: Florence and Tuscany 451

Chapel of St. Fina, which Ghirlandaio frescoed with two scenes from the
young saint’s brief life. Admission is 3 ($4.80). It’s open November
through January 20 and March Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m.
to 4:40 p.m. and Sunday and holidays from 12:30 to 4:40 p.m.; April
through October Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 7:10 p.m.,
Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:10 p.m., and Sunday and holidays from 
12:30 to 5:10 p.m. (closed Jan 21–Feb).
Where to stay and dine
L’Antico Pozzo, Via San Matteo 87 (% 0577-942014; Fax: 0577-942117;
www.anticopozzo.com; Rack rates: 140–180/$224–$288 double,
including buffet breakfast), is our favorite hotel within the town walls. 
La Mangiatoia, Via Mainardi 5 (% 0577-941528; open Wed–Mon 12:30–
2:30 p.m. and 7:30–10 p.m.), has an intimate atmosphere and a hearty
Tuscan menu, and its more imaginative dishes are the best.

cies are Farmacia Molteni, Via Calzaiuoli 7r
(% 055-215472); Farmacia Comunale, inside
S.M.N. train station (% 055-216761); and
All’insegna del Moro, Piazza San Giovanni
28r (% 055-211343).
Police
Dial % 113.
Post Office
The main post office is the Ufficio Postale in
Via Pellicceria 3, off Piazza della Repubblica,
open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Restrooms
Museums have public restrooms; other-
wise, your best bet is to go to a cafe or the
Rinascente Department store in Piazza
della Repubblica.
Safety
The historic district is quite safe; your only
major worries are pickpockets and purse
snatchers because of the huge concentra-
tion of tourists. Avoid deserted areas after
dark (such as behind the train station and
the Cascine Park), and exercise normal
urban caution.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If smoking
at your table is important to you, call
beforehand to make sure the restaurant or
cafe you’ll be visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes

B
uilt on water and marshland, Venice is not just an amazing city —
it’s also a feat of engineering and determination. The city’s famous
canals serve as its main streets, traveled by a variety of boats, including
the famous gondole. Centuries of political stability and wealth allowed
Venice to create a rich urban and cultural landscape (including hun-
dreds of churches such as the Basilica de San Marco) and to nurture
such great late-Renaissance artists as Titian and Tintoretto. Every year,
more than 7 million tourists join the city’s 70,000 residents, and in high
season the crowds can be overwhelming. And yet . . . Canal Grande after
sunset, Piazza San Marco early in the morning, the Gallerie
dell’Accademia, the lagoon, the Canaletto skies, and the stillness
beneath the hubbub are sights you just have to experience. And Venice’s
famous serenity (the republic was called La Serenissima, the “serene
one”) is as seductive as ever.
If you had the time to stay a week in Venice it would be well spent, but
you can see the highlights in two days.
Getting There
Water surrounds Venice, threading its way through every neighborhood,
so arriving in town without hopping on a boat of some sort is nearly
impossible. While in the city, walking is the best way to get around.
Arriving by air
Flights land at the Aeroporto Marco Polo, 10.5km (61⁄2 miles) north of
the city on the mainland (% 041-260-9260; www.veniceairport.it).
You’ll find ATMs and a tourist information desk on the ground floor in
the arrivals hall.

Though fast and convenient, a water taxi (% 041-541-5084) costs
between 98 and 120 ($157–$192) for two to four people depending on
the distance. At Motoscafi Venezia (% 041-522-2303; www.motoscafi
venezia.it) you can book a water taxi or the cheaper water shuttle,
which takes up to ten passengers to drop-off points that are convenient 
to most destinations (you then have to walk to your hotel); they maintain
a desk at the airport, inside the terminal at arrivals. Cheaper but longer
are the larger water shuttles run by Alilaguna (% 041-240-1701; www.
alilaguna.it): 12 ($19) per person for the 50-minute ride to San Marco
and other stops in the historic district. If you’re on a budget, you can take
the ATVO shuttle bus (% 041-520-5530; www.atvo.it), which runs
hourly to Piazzale Roma, Venice’s car terminal on the mainland, for 3
($4.80) per person. The trip takes about 20 minutes, and you can then
take a vaporetto (the local water “bus”; see “Getting Around Venice,” later
in this chapter) or a water taxi to your hotel.
Arriving by rail
Trains pull in at Santa Lucia, Venice’s historic district’s rail station.
Venice’s mainland rail hub is Mestre. Choose a direct train to Santa
Lucia if you don’t want to switch in Mestre to a local shuttle train for the
ten-minute trip to Santa Lucia. Just outside Santa Lucia rail station,
you’ll find the ticket booth for the vaporetto, as well as water taxis.
Finding information after you arrive
The APT (Fondamenta San Lorenzo, Castello 5050, 30122 Venezia; 
% 041-529-8700; www.venicetouristboard.com and www.turismo
venezia.it) maintains tourist info points at the airport, Piazzale Roma,
and Santa Lucia train station, as well as other info centers in town; see
“Information” under “Fast Facts: Venice” at the end of this chapter.
Getting Around Venice
Your only options for getting around in the historic district are by foot or
by boat. No book-size map can give you full details of the narrow calli and
bridges. If you’re planning major exploring, get a good map, such as the
smartly folded Falk map, available at most bookstores and newsstands.
By foot
We’ve seen many a tourist, unprepared for the rigors of walking Venice,
slumped in dismay in front of the steps of yet another bridge. Yet, after
having your own boat, walking is the best way to visit Venice, and you’ll
be doing a lot of it. You only need to remember to keep to your right —
yes, even while walking — to avoid stopping on narrow bridges and
blocking the circulation (a major breech to local etiquette), and to wear
comfortable shoes (perhaps packing a good foot balm, an end-of-the-day
treat for your faithful “wheels”).
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 455

Although it may appear daunting and mazelike, you can’t get lost in
Venice as you would in a regular city. Venice has very few streets and a
canal will always stop you — at worst, you’ll have to backtrack and then
try the next turn. So don’t feel shy about exploring — no matter how
deserted a calle may look — you’re never very far from a crowded spot
where you can ask for directions.
As you wander, look for the ubiquitous signs with arrows (sometimes a
little old, but still readable) that, just like trailblazers, direct you toward
major landmarks, such as FERROVIA (the train station), PIAZZALE ROMA (the
car terminal), VAPORETTO (the nearest vaporetto stop), RIALTO (the
bridge), PIAZZA SAN MARCO, ACCADEMIA (the bridge), and so on.
By vaporetto (water bus)
Public transportation in Venice (% 041-272-2111; www.actv.it) is by
boat: The vaporetto is a water bus — something between a small barge and
a ferry — and can be great fun. One must-do experience is the ride down
the Canal Grande early in the day and by night (see “Exploring Venice,”
later in this chapter). With rush-hour crowds, remember to put your back-
pack down when standing; it’ll be less exposed to pickpockets, and the
locals will appreciate it. A one-hour ticket valid on all lines is 6.50 ($15).
If you plan to use the vaporetto a lot, go for one of the many available
passes, such as a 12-hour pass for 14 ($22), a 48-hour pass for 26
($42), or a 72-hour pass for 31 ($50). These passes give you access to
the whole public transportation system, including the lines crossing the
lagoon to Murano, Burano, and Lido. Transportation passes are included
with the Venice Card and discounted (a three-day transportation pass
for 18/$29) with the Rolling Venice Card (see “Exploring Venice,” later
in this chapter).
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
456
Street smarts: Venetian addresses
Venice doesn’t label its streets and squares like the rest of Italy does. A calle, ruga, or
ramo is a street; a rio terrà is a street made from a filled-in canal; and a fondamenta
or riva is a sidewalk along the edge of a canal. A canale or rio is a canal. A campo or
campiello is a square (but you see exceptions here, including Piazza San Marco,
Piazzetta San Marco, and Piazzale Roma).
Although a street or campo name can be used only once within a Venetian neighbor-
hood, no rule exists against another sestiere (neighborhood) using the exact same
label. As a result, the most popular names (such as Calle della Madonna) are recy-
cled three or four times in Venice, yet refer to streets half a city apart. Because of the
confusing naming conventions, save yourself a headache and know the sestiere along
with any address. (By the way, don’t even try to figure out the street-numbering system
in Venice — it’s devoid of any logic whatsoever.)

By traghetto (ferry skiff)
Just three bridges span the Grand Canal. To fill in the gaps, traghetti
skiffs (oversize gondolas rowed by two standing gondoliers) cross the
Grand Canal at eight intermediate points — San Tomà, Santa Maria del
Giglio, Dogana, Ferrovia, Rialto, San Marcuola, San Samuele, and
Santa Sofia — with boarding at the end of any street named Calle del
Traghetto on your map and indicated by a yellow sign with the black
gondola symbol. The fare is 0.50 (80¢), which you hand to the gondo-
lier when boarding.
By taxi
Though a little expensive, water taxis are the perfect way to get to and
from your hotel with your luggage and to have a taste of luxury. You can
get one by walking to a taxi stand — San Marco, rail station, Rialto — or
calling for pickup (see “Fast Facts: Venice” at the end of this chapter for
numbers). The meter starts at 8.70 ($14) and adds 1.30 ($2.10) every
minute; you’ll also have to pay a surcharge of 5.50 ($8.80) for night
hours, 5.90 ($9.45) for holidays, plus 6 ($9.60) if you call for service,
and 1.50 ($2.40) for each piece of luggage larger than 50 centimeters
(20 inches) per side. Remember that even water taxis can’t reach certain
locations, in which case you’ll have to walk the rest of the way.
Staying in Venice
With the euro climbing sky high and several million fellow tourists to
compete against, landing a moderately priced accommodation in Venice
is quite tricky. Low season is basically nonexistent, and you’ll want to
make your reservations well in advance (the best deals are booked up to
a year early, particularly for Carnival). You’ll get much better rates on
the island of Lido. Another possibility is staying in nearby Padova, a
charming town located a short 30-minute train ride from Venice (see
“Traveling beyond Venice,” later in this chapter). If you arrive without a
reservation, the Hotel Association of Venice (AVA; % 041-522-2264;
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 457
Sinking beauty
Venice has weathered wars, dictators, and conspiracies, and enjoyed more than a
thousand years of democracy. But its most treacherous foe may be the very sea it has
relied on for centuries. The city is literally sinking into the muddy lagoon on which it
was built. In spite of advice from experts all over the world, cement injections, and the
ongoing work of restoration and solidification of the canals, the city continues to sink.
The search for ways to save one of the most beautiful and extraordinary cities ever
built continues, but the increase in the sea levels registered all over the planet in
recent years because of global warming spells doom.

Dorsoduro
At the tip of La Giudecca — a few minutes from San Marco by free shuttle
boat — this hotel offers one of the most romantic experiences in Venice and
some of the highest rates in Europe. Housed in a 16th-century monastery
overlooking the water on three sides, and complete with cloisters, it offers
individually decorated rooms that are sumptuous but not overly ornate.
Even the simplest double rooms with garden views are palatial, with super-
comfortable beds, quality linens, large bathrooms, and views. Public spaces
include gardens and a heated Olympic-size swimming pool filled with filtered
saltwater. With a ratio of two staff members for each room, the service here
is perfect. The hotel’s restaurant, Fortuny, is one of the best restaurants
in Italy.

Castello
This pink 15th-century building, once a convent, is a bargain for the area;
run by two sisters, this hotel offers friendly and expert service. The loca-
tion is nearly perfect, by Riva degli Schiavoni but somewhat quieter. Guest
rooms are elegant and decorated in either Liberty (Art Nouveau) or 19th-
century style, with carpet or wooden floors, comfortable beds, and new
bathrooms. Their three apartments are great for families, decorated in ele-
gant modern style, with comfortable beds and kitchenettes complete with
microwave ovens; the modern bathrooms come with separate showers and
Jacuzzi tubs. The substantial buffet breakfast is served in a rather glitzy hall.

style, with carpeted or wooden floors, comfortable beds, fine fabrics, and
quality reproduction furniture. The staff is attentive and friendly. The hotel
also includes an annex, the Locanda Remedio. Guest rooms there 
are somewhat smaller but perfectly adequate and well appointed, with
wooden floors, period furnishings, and small but nice modern bathrooms.

Castello
We love this hotel: It is one of the few posh hotels on Riva degli Schiavoni
that’s still family run (the others have been bought by American chains),
and the family has managed to keep up the challenge by offering great 
service and quality for your money. This romantic property includes the
chapel where Vivaldi composed the Four Seasons; from its opulent Venetian
baroque interior to its peaceful courtyard garden, this hotel sets itself apart.
Each guest room is spacious and individually furnished with brocades and
luxury fabrics, carpeted or wood floors, comfortable beds, and period fur-
niture that include original antiques; the good-size bathrooms (all with tubs)
are done in marble or mosaic. The restaurant Met is one of the best in Italy;
here, you can get heavenly creative Venetian cuisine in the cozy and luxuri-
ous dining room. The Internet rates are as much as 40 percent off.

Santa Croce
This is your chance to stay in a gorgeous 14th-century palazzo on the
Canal Grande without spending a fortune. Located across from the Ca’
d’Oro and left of the Ca’ Corner della Regina, this was a noble Venetian res-
idence before being turned into a hotel after careful renovation. Guest
rooms are spacious and bright, decorated with original tiled or wood
floors, Venetian plaster on the walls, quality dark-wood or gilded period
furniture with many antiques, some lovely carpets, and large windows. The
best rooms face Canal Grande, others the smaller canal on the side or the
courtyard. The hotel also has a beautiful terrace overlooking the canals.

Dining in Venice
Venice is a tricky place to eat. Not because the local cuisine isn’t good —
it’s delicious, especially if you like seafood — but because so many
eateries in Venice are such tourist traps. When you find the right restau-
rant, though, it’s heavenly: Fish and shellfish from the lagoon and the
Adriatic served on rice, pasta, or polenta (cornmeal) are the staples of
Venetian cuisine, and wine is an important part of the meal. Venice is
small, and restaurants and trattorie are basically everywhere, but good
ones are hard to find. Also, restaurants in Venice are rather expensive;
all will add a coperto (cover) charge to your bill between 1.50 and 5
($2.40–$8), and a 10 percent to 15 percent service charge.
There is no fishing on Sundays, so the fish market is closed on Mondays;
the seafood you’ll eat is from the Saturday before. On Mondays, have
meat or a pizza instead.
Italy is famed for its wines, and the vineyards around Venice produce
some great ones, including the white Soave and two reds, Bardolino and
Valpolicella.

Venetian lunch on the go
Eating in Venice is very expensive, and your purse will welcome a little picnic now and
then. You’ll find many bars selling sandwiches, but you should consider making your
own out of local specialties and freshly baked local bread. You’ll find all the above in
the many bakeries and grocery shops lining Strada Nuova in Cannaregio, together
with some scrumptious sweets. Two other excellent places are Via Garibaldi in
Castello — where you’ll also find Coop, a supermarket with mainland prices — and
around Campo Rialto Nuovo in San Polo, where you’ll find the lively and colorful fish,
produce, and flower markets. Another Coop supermarket is on Rio Terà Santi Apostoli
(4612 Cannaregio), near Strada Nuova. Remember that Piazza San Marco is an open-
air museum and, as such, eating on the premises is forbidden.

several typical delights at Pasticceria Tonolo, San Pantalon, 3764 Dorsoduro (Vaporetto:
San Tomà), or Pasticceria Marchini, Spadaria, 2769 San Marco (% 041-522-9109). Of
course, Venice has many, many other pastry shops. Don’t be afraid to stop and sample —
you’ll rarely find a bad one. Good gelato (ice cream) is more difficult to find: Industrial and
pretend-homemade ice cream is sold at every corner, but it’s a pale imitation of what you
can have in Rome, Naples, or heavenly Sicily. One of the best places for gelato is the hole-
in-the-wall Boutique del Gelato, Salizzada San Lio, 5727 Castello (%041-522-3283), where
everything is made fresh on the premises. Another good address is Gelateria Paolin,
Campo Stefano Morosini (% 041-522-5576), Venice’s oldest, dating from the 1930s.

Exploring Venice
To avoid the long lines at Palazzo Ducale and Accademia Galleries, 
purchase the appropriate pass, card, or cumulative ticket (see the next
paragraph) at one of the less sought-after attractions (the best is Ca’
Pesaro). Buying a pass or card in advance will also allow you to avoid
the lines at the Frari Basilica (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari).
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 467

The Venice Card (% 041-2424; www.venicecard.it) is a good deal,
and though it’s best to buy it online before hitting Venice (because you
get an extra discount), it’s also available for sale all over town: at the air-
port, Piazzale Roma, and train station, as well as at all the tourist infor-
mation offices and most of the Hellovenezia ticket booths (vaporetto and
public transportation). The basic three-day transportation pass costs
38 ($61) at a ticket booth and 34 ($54) online; the three-day culture
and transport pass is 59 ($94) at the ticket booth and 47 ($75) online.
Both passes get you a welcome kit including a good map, and they give
you access to all public transportation, use of the public bathrooms, and
a bunch of discounts; the culture card also includes a Museum Pass and
a Chorus Card (see the following list). For an additional fee, you can
include the airport shuttle boat Alilaguna.
If you’re between the ages of 14 and 29, once you’re in Venice you can
purchase the Rolling Venice Card, which gives you substantial dis-
counts on hotels, restaurants, museums, public transportation (see ear-
lier in this chapter), and shops. You can get the card for 4 ($6.40) by
presenting a photo ID at one of the tourist information points in Venice
or at one of the Hellovenezia ticket booths. You’ll get a kit with a map of
Venice charting the location of all the participating hotels, restaurants,
clubs, and shops, as well as a special guidebook with interesting facts
and smart itineraries.
Alternatively, here are the other deals:
 Museum Pass: Admission to each of the 12 Venice civic museums —
Palazzo Ducale, Correr Museum, Libreria Marciana, Ca’ Rezzonico,
Clock Tower, Palazzo Mocenigo, Carlo Goldoni’s house, Ca’ Pesaro,
Fortuny Museum, Natural History Museum (with Planetarium),
Murano Glass Museum, and Burano Lace Museum — for 18 ($29)
(with Rolling Venice Card only 12/$19). Children 4 and under are
free. The pass is valid for six months, and you can purchase it at
each of the participating museums.
 Family ticket: If you’re a family group of two adults and at least two
children, at all Venice civic museums (see the preceding bullet),
you pay one regular admission and get reduced admission for all
the others in your group. It works for the Museum Pass (you’ll pay
only 12/$19) as well as for single admissions.
 Chorus Card (% 041-274-0462; www.chorusvenezia.org): Access
to 16 churches in Venice — including Frari Basilica (see “Venice’s
top attractions,” later in this chapter) — for 9 ($14). A family ver-
sion, for two adults and two children 11 to 18, goes for 18 ($29).
The pass is valid for one year and is for sale at all participating
churches (avoid buying the pass at Frari, because lines there are
always long) and at the Venice Pavilion tourist office.
 Combination ticket: A ticket for the Ca’ d’Oro, Museo Orientale in
Ca’ Pesaro, and Accademia Galleries is available for 11 ($18); you
can purchase it at the ticket booth of any of the three museums.

Venice’s top attractions
Frari Basilica (Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari)
San Polo
This church is a magnificent example of the Venetian Gothic, built in the
first half of the 14th century and enlarged in the 15th. Beside it is the orig-
inal 14th-century bell tower. Its architecture singles out not only this
church, but also the exquisite artworks it contains, none more so than
Titian’s Pala Pesaro (Pesaro altarpiece) and his Assumption over the main
altar, a glorious composition that combines billowing forms with exquisite
colors and a feeling of serenity. Other stars are Giovanni Bellini’s triptych
Virgin and Child with Four Saints and Donatello’s St. John the Baptist, a rare
sculpture in wood. Be sure to visit the original wooden choir, where monks
participated in Mass — this is the only extant choir of its kind in Venice.
The triangular marble monument dedicated to sculptor Antonio Canova
was actually designed by Canova to be a monument to Titian (Canova’s
followers appropriated the design for their master after he died in 1822).
A bit of trivia: If you look carefully at the walls near the monument, you
see an Austrian bomb that was dropped on the church during World War
I but miraculously failed to explode.

biggies in Venetian painting, from Paolo Veneziano’s 14th-century Coronation
of the Virgin altarpiece, and Giorgione’s strange The Tempest, to Giovanni
Bellini’s numerous versions of Madonna and Child, and Paolo Veronese’s Last
Supper, retitled Feast in the House of Levi after the puritanical leaders of the

Palazzo Ducale and Bridge of Sighs
San Marco
Shimmering after a lengthy restoration, the pink-and-white facade of
Venice’s most beautiful palazzo has been returned to view. Pause to take
in the delicate decorations, expressive carvings, and splendid bas-reliefs
of its columns before entering. Once the private home of the doges (the
doge was leader of the republic, elected for life), as well as the seat of the
government and the court of law, the pink-and-white marble Palazzo
Ducale was the Republic’s heart. In Gothic-Renaissance style, it was begun
in 1173, integrating the walls and towers of the previously existing A.D. 810
castle. The palazzo was enlarged in 1340 with the addition of the new wing
housing the Great Council Room, a marvel of architecture for the size of
the unsupported ceilings. Tintoretto’s Paradise decorates that ceiling; said
to be the largest oil painting in the world, it is not Tintoretto’s best, how-
ever. On the left side of the courtyard is the Staircase of the Giants,
guarded by two giant stone figures and a Renaissance masterpiece. At the
top of these steps, you enter the loggia, from which departs the famous
Scala d’Oro (Golden Staircase), leading to the doge’s apartments and the
government chambers. These were splendidly decorated by the major
artists of the 16th century, including Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, and
Tiepolo. A little-known part of the palace’s collection is a group of paint-
ings bequeathed by a bishop, including interesting works by Hieronymus
Bosch.
From the palazzo, continue your visit on the famous Bridge of Sighs,
which didn’t get its name from the lovers who met under it. The bridge
was built in the 17th century to connect the palazzo — and the Courts of
Justice — to the prisons, and those condemned to death passed over this
bridge (supposedly sighing heavily) both on their way into the prison and
eventually on their way out to be executed in Piazzetta San Marco. The
two red columns on the facade of Palazzo Ducale mark the place where
the death sentences were read out. You can visit both the 16th-century
New Prisons, built when the palace’s limited facilities became insufficient,
and the Old Prisons, also called pozzi, literally “wells” but “pits” would be
a better translation, as they were at and below the ground level, which, in
Venice, means that they’re flooded at high tide.
The Palazzo Ducale is huge, especially when you count the labyrinthine
prison next door, through which you can wander (and shudder at the
medieval conditions — the place was used into the 1920s). You can easily
spend four hours inside, especially if you take one of the special tours.
See map p. 458. Piazza San Marco; the entrance to the palace is from the Porta del
Frumento on the water side. % 041-271-5911. Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marco.

Peggy Guggenheim Collection
Dorsoduro
Housed in the ground floor of a 1749 palazzo that was never completed, at
the elegant Palazzo Venier dei Leoni opening on Canal Grande, this museum
holds one of Italy’s most important collections of avant-garde art. American
expatriate collector Peggy Guggenheim lived here for 30 years; after her
death in 1979, the building and collection became the property of New York’s
Guggenheim Foundation. Peggy G.’s protégés included Jackson Pollock, rep-
resented by ten paintings, and Max Ernst, whom she married. From dada
and surrealism to expressionism and abstract expressionism, the collection
is rich and diverse, with works by Klee, Magritte, Mondrian, De Chirico, Dalí,
Kandinsky, Picasso, and others. The sculpture garden includes works by
Giacometti.

Ponte di Rialto
San Marco/San Polo
The original wooden bridge here started rotting away, and the citizens of
Venice couldn’t decide what to do. Finally, in 1588, they decided to replace
it with the current stone-and-brick, red-and-white marvel. The bridge
opens onto the Rialto district in San Polo, Venice’s main merchant area
since the Middle Ages. Ships arrived here after stopping at the dogana
(customhouse) at the tip of Dorsoduro and discharged their merchandise
in the large warehouses here. Goods were then sold at the general market
surrounding the warehouses. The fish and produce wholesale markets
were moved to the new merchant and marine terminal across Santa Lucia
rail station only in 1998, but the retail markets have survived with their
picturesque flavor. Lined with shops and busy with crowds of tourists, it
is difficult to truly enjoy this splendid bridge’s architecture during the day:
For the best view, try early in the morning or late in the evening, when
shops are closed.

Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to Rialto.
Piazza San Marco
San Marco
Maybe the world’s most famous square, this uniquely beautiful space was
created in the 11th century. Lined on one side by St. Mark’s Basilica (see
the following listing) and on the three others by the porticos and loggias
of the Procuratie buildings, it was and is the heart of Venice, seat of cere-
monies, celebrations, and once also tournaments. The buildings on the
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 471

north side are the Procuratie Vecchie, built in the Renaissance as offices
for the city’s magistracy. Facing the piazza to the south are the Procuratie
Nuove, built to house more offices and, after the fall of the Venetian
Republic at the hands of Napoleon, turned into the Royal Palace. The wing
closing the piazza to the west was added by Napoleon, after demolishing
the church that was there. This last building houses today the Correr
Museum (% 041-240-5211; www.museiciviciveneziani.it), with an
interesting collection that includes some remarkable artworks, such as
Canova’s bas-reliefs; Cosmé Tura’s Pietà from 1460 — a fanciful and in
some ways surreal painting with a red Golgotha in the background — as
well as the famous painting by Carpaccio Two Venetian Ladies (familiarly
called The Courtesans, but now known to be a pair of respectable Venetian
ladies, a fragment from a larger painting).
To the north of the piazza, adjacent to St. Mark’s Basilica, is the Torre
dell’Orologio, a clock tower built in 1496. The clock has two huge quad-
rants — one indicating phases of the moon and zodiac, the other the time
with a complicated mechanism propelling wooden statues of the Magi (the
three kings bringing offerings to Jesus) guided by an angel — and, above,
two bronze Moors striking a bell on the hour. After a lengthy restoration,
the tower is open to visitors (not recommended if you have a heart con-
dition or are claustrophobic, pregnant, or otherwise movement-impaired,
because the climb is steep and narrow) for a guided tour by reservation
only. Tickets are 12 ($19) or 7 ($11) if you already have the Venice Card,
Museum Pass, or Palazzo Ducale ticket.
To the south, St. Mark’s Bell Tower (% 041-522-4064) dominates the piazza.
Used as a lighthouse by approaching boats, this tall belfry — 97m (324 ft.)
high — was originally built in the ninth century and was added to in the cen-
turies that followed. It suddenly collapsed in 1902 but was faithfully — and
solidly — rebuilt using much of the same materials. From atop, you can
admire a 360-degree panorama of the city and the famous piazza below —
and you can do so without climbing hundreds of steps: There’s an elevator!

Behave or be fined!
The whole historic district of Venice is considered a monument, so strict laws apply.
It’s forbidden to sit on a public walkway (sidewalk, bridge, piazza, and so on); have a
picnic (sitting on a small wall, for example); swim in the canals; litter; use bikes or any
other kind of transportation (including scooters and rollerblades); undress in public;
and walk around underdressed (with no shirt or with beachwear). The fine is 50 ($80)
for any violation.

St. Mark’s Basilica
San Marco
The symbol of Venice, it was built in A.D. 829 to house the remains of San
Marco, one of the four evangelists, martyred by the Turks in Alexandria of
Egypt, and the city’s patron saint. The original church was rebuilt after it
burned down in 932, and again in 1063, taking its present shape. Five
domes — originally gilded — top the five portals, while an elegant loggia
opens in between: This is where the doge presided over the public func-
tions held in the square; multilingual audio boxes here give a brief descrip-
tion of the sites you can see around the piazza. The rooms above the loggia
contain the Museo Marciano, which holds the original horses of the
Triumphal Quadriga: the famous gilded bronze horses (the ones outside
gracing the loggia are copies) brought back from Constantinople in 1204
after the Fourth Crusade. Experts have estimated that the horses are Greek
sculptures from the fourth century B.C. You can access the loggia, as well
as the gallery and the museum from a long and steep flight of stone steps
inside the basilica entrance on the right.
Due to the crowds, the visit to the basilica is limited to ten minutes (Pala
d’Oro, Treasury, and Museum are separate); you can make a free reservation
for your time slot at least 48 hours in advance at www.alata.it.
From April through October, Monday through Saturday, the parish offers
free guided tours of the basilica, for which you need to make reservations
in advance (at www.veneziaubc.org or % 041-241-3817).

Scuola Grande di San Rocco
San Polo
San Rocco is Jacopo Tintoretto’s Sistine Chapel. From 1564 to 1587, Tintoretto,
a brother of the school, decorated the Sala dell’Albergo, the lower hall,
and the upper hall with a series of incredibly beautiful paintings depicting
biblical and Christian subjects. The upper hall ceiling alone has 21 paintings
(mirrors are available so that you don’t have to strain your neck). The most
impressive is his Crucifixion, a painting of almost overpowering emotion and
incredible detail (the tools used to make the cross are strewn in the fore-
ground); the painter shows the moment when one of the two thieves’
crosses is raised. The upper hall is also decorated with a fascinating col-
lection of wood sculptures carved by Francesco Pianta in the 17th century;
some depict artisans and the tools of their trade with an amazing realism.
Tintoretto was not the only artist who decorated this scuola: You’ll see also
works by Bellini, Titian, and Tiepolo.

More cool things to see and do
 Yes, we know, gondolas are for, ahem, tourists . . . but really, what can
be more romantic than being rowed in a gondola along off-the-
beaten-path canals? Often dismissed as a tourist trap, a gondola ride
is the best way to admire the city’s architecture and experience
Venice’s unique serenity. It is a luxury that affords a glimpse into a
little known universe: the Venetian sailors and fishermen community,
people who make their living on the lagoon as they did centuries ago
and are the keepers of many Venetian traditions. The tourist office
organizes gondola tours, saving you the hassle of negotiating itiner-
ary and prices with the gondola owner, but you can also organize
your own by going to one of the many gondola stands in town.
The hiring of a gondola adheres to strict rules established by the
local municipality to prevent abuses; the official rate (set by Ente
Gondola; % 041-528-5075; www.gondolavenezia.it) is 80
($128) for 40 minutes and a maximum of six people in the daytime
and of 100 ($160) for nighttime (7 p.m.–8 a.m.). Make sure you use
only authorized gondolas from one of the official gondola stations,
and establish the price, itinerary, and time in advance, before you
get in the boat, to avoid unpleasant surprises. You’ll find gondola
stations at San Marco (% 041-520-0685); San Tomà (% 041-
520-5275); Rialto (Riva del Carbon; % 041-522-4904); Santa Maria
del Giglio (% 041-522-2073); Campo San Moisé, off Calle Larga 22
Marzo (% 041-523-1837); and Riva Schiavoni (across from Danieli;
% 041-522-2254).
You may want to take your tour at high tide — to be more level with
the pavement, instead of the interesting but rather scummy canal
sidewalls. You’ll also want to avoid the Canal Grande, except maybe
in the wee hours: It is so large and busy that it gets very noisy and
choppy and, therefore, can be quite unpleasant in a small boat.
 The word ghetto has been used to name the neighborhood once set
apart for Jews in European cities, but the Ghetto Novo (Venetian
Ghetto) was Europe’s first. It was established in 1516 on a small
island accessible by only one bridge that was closed at night (you
can still see the grooves in the marble sottoportico [portico inte-
rior] where the iron bars fitted). In 1541, when groups of Jews from
Germany, Poland, Spain, and Portugal fled to Venice, the govern-
ment allowed the community to expand into the Ghetto Vecchio
(Old Ghetto), the area between the Ghetto Novo and the Rio di
Cannaregio, which has the two largest places of worship — the
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
474

Levantine and Spanish synagogues (Scola Levantina and Scola
Spagnola). To accommodate the growing population, buildings
were made taller and taller, so that this area has some of the tallest
buildings in Venice. The Jewish Museum, Museo Ebraico, Campo
del Ghetto Novo, 2902/b Cannaregio (% 041-715359; www.museo
ebraico.it; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San Marcuola; open Oct–May
Sun–Fri 10 a.m.–6 p.m., June–Sept Sun–Fri 10 a.m.–7 p.m.; closed
Jan 1, May 1, Dec 25, and Jewish holidays) offers guided tours of
the synagogues in Italian or English every hour beginning at 10:30
a.m. on opening days. Admission is 3 ($4.80) for the museum only,
or 8.50 ($14) with guided tour.
 A visit to Venice isn’t complete without a trip to the lagoon. Murano
(Vaporetto: 41 or 42) is the closest island — actually a cluster of
islands — and the largest. It feels like a small — and much quieter —
replica of Venice (down to its main canal meandering across it) and
is the island of the glassmakers. The industry that was created here
centuries ago is still very active and as famous as ever for the unique
quality of its artistic glasswork (some of the works allow you to sit
and watch glass being blown, most only mornings). You’ll find many
shops selling glass of all kinds — from cheap trinkets and souvenirs
to million-dollar chandeliers. At the Glass Museum, Fondamenta
Giustinian (% 041-739586), you can see a number of splendid
antique masterpieces. Admission is 5.50 ($8.80), and the museum
is open Thursday through Tuesday April through October 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m., November through March 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (ticket booth
closes 30 minutes earlier). If you’d like to see more of the lagoon,
head for Burano, the farthest of the islands and a picturesque fishing
and — once upon the time — lace-making community. It’s still the
seat of the Lace School/Museum, Piazza Baldassarre Galuppi 187
(% 041-730034), a world-renowned center, and the repository of
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 475
Venezia and the gondola
This unique boat was developed to fit the local conditions and is a marvel of engi-
neering: 11 meters (38 feet) long, it weighs up to 600kg (1,320 pounds), yet it is easily
maneuvered by one person with only one oar. It is flat enough to float in a few inches
of water. Its asymmetrical and curved design allows it to go straight under the push
of one oar, and its curve is calculated based on the oarsman weight, so each gondola
is built for its owner! Designed to transport people, it’s decorated with elegance —
gilded edgings, velvet and brocade over comfortable cushions, delicate carvings —
while simpler boats were used for cargo. The gondola is traditionally built in wood,
using eight different essences for the 280 parts that make it. No metal nails are used
for its assembly and the only two pieces of iron are the characteristic ferro, decorat-
ing the bow — originally a balancing weight for the oarsman — and the risso, deco-
rating the stern.

ancient and precious techniques and skills. Admission is 4
($6.40); the museum is open Wednesday through Monday April
through October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., November through March 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Both museums are closed January 1, May 1, 
and December 25.
 Shopping for fine glass, lace, and Carnevale masks is a must in
Venice, but be aware of quality: Many items are machine-produced
elsewhere — sometimes Eastern Europe or Taiwan — even though
they’re presented as handmade. Your best guide is not to worry
about pedigree and simply purchase things you like. However, if
you’re looking for the real deal or you’re buying to build a formal col-
lection, resign yourself to the fact that prices for quality items are
high. For glass, visit Venini, Piazzetta dei Leoncini, just to the left of
St. Mark’s Basilica, 314 San Marco (% 041-522-4045), or Pauly & Co,
Palazzo Trevisan Cappello, Ponte dei Consorzi 4391/A San Marco, off
Calle Larga San Marco (% 041-520-9899), Piazza San Marco 73 
(% 041-523-5484), Piazza San Marco 77 (% 041-277-0279), and
Piazza San Marco 316 (% 041-523-5575). For lace, go to Jesurum,
Mercerie del Capitello, 4857 San Marco (% 041-520-6177), or
Martinuzzi, Piazza San Marco, 67/A San Marco (% 041-522-5068).
For masks, visit the Laboratorio Artigiano Maschere, Barbaria delle
Tole, 6657 Castello (% 041-522310), or Mondonovo, Rio Terà Canal,
3063 Dorsoduro (% 041-528-7344).
Guided tours
The best traditional tours are offered by American Express, Salizzada
San Moisè, 1471 San Marco (% 041-520-0844; Vaporetto: 1 or 82 to San
Marco–Vallaresso). A guide walks you around the sights and keeps you
from getting lost for about 35 ($56) for a two-hour tour.
We also love the special tours organized by the Venice tourist office
(see “Fast Facts: Venice” at the end of this chapter for contact details),
including such unusual offerings as a 20-minute helicopter tour for 220
($352) or an evening tour of the neighborhoods of Castello and
Cannaregio to the discovery of Venetian legends and dark stories. Their
guided tour of Canal Grande for 30 ($48) is excellent (daily at 11:30
a.m. and 4:30 p.m.), but they require a minimum of four people.

Taking care of business
Standard business hours for shops in Venice are Monday through Saturday from 
9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 or 4 to 7:30 p.m.; shops close Monday mornings in summer
and Saturday afternoons in winter. Most grocers close Wednesday afternoons 
year-round.

Suggested itineraries
Time in Venice always seems to fly. Here are a few suggestions on how to
schedule your visits.
If you have one day
If you have only one day in Venice, you definitely want to make the most
of it with an early start. Begin your day on Piazza San Marco with a visit
to the basilica, including the climb to the loggia upstairs, where the
light is at its most beautiful in the morning. You should then have a little
time left for the Doge’s Palace. Have a caffè or cappuccino at the terrace
of one of the two historic cafes — Caffè Florian and Caffè Quadri — on
the piazza: expensive, but oh so romantic. After, have a look at the beau-
tiful Murano glass — and maybe even buy some — in Venini and Pauly
& Co. Then walk toward the Accademia, taking the footbridge over the
Canal Grande and having lunch in the lively area nearby at Osteria da
Fiore or just a snack — for a sweet one, the Pasticceria Tonolo is won-
derful. After lunch, visit the Gallerie dell’Accademia for a tour of sev-
eral hundred years of Venetian art. Have a Venetian aperitivo — a
cicchetto (a glass of dry wine accompanied by some savory tidbits) — in
one of the small bars near the Accademia, or across the Canal Grande at
the Antico Martini. Treat yourself for dinner at Met of the Hotel
Metropole. After dinner, take a magical gondola ride if you want or settle
for a slow ride down Canal Grande on vaporetto line no. 1 to take in its
magical atmosphere, the glorious facades of the palazzi lining it, and the
romantic Ponte di Rialto as you pass under it.
If you have two days
On Day 1, start as in the itinerary in the preceding section, but dedicate
more time to St. Mark’s Basilica. In the afternoon, take a tour of the
Palazzo Ducale and the Bridge of Sighs. After your visits, head to
Antico Martini for a well-deserved aperitivo and maybe dinner.
Afterward, stroll to the Ponte di Rialto.
On Day 2, dedicate your morning to the Gallerie dell’Accademia. Have
lunch at Osteria da Fiore and, after lunch, visit the Santa Maria
Gloriosa dei Frari and the Scuola Grande di San Rocco. Follow the
dinner and after-dinner recommendations in the preceding “If you have
one day” itinerary.
If you have three days
On Days 1 and 2, follow the two-day itinerary in the preceding section.
Dedicate Day 3 to the lagoon, visiting first Murano, with its Glass
Museum and the showrooms of the most famous glassmakers, and then
Burano, with its Lace Museum. End the day visiting Venice’s Ghetto, or
just enjoy wandering the streets and shopping.
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 477

Traveling beyond Venice
For a change of pace, consider leaving Venice for a day in search of qui-
eter (and less touristy) pleasures. A short train ride will lead you to
Padova, a college town with stunning architecture and art galore; a
slightly longer one to Milan, Italy’s capital of fashion and shopping,
which is also hiding some wonderful art.
Padova: Outstanding art and architecture
From its canals to its churches — including the Cappella degli Scrovegni,
with Giotto’s frescoes so breathtaking that they dwarf the other worthy
attractions in town — Padova will not disappoint. You can easily see the
highlights in one day, but spending the night will allow you to fully enjoy
the town.
Getting there
Padova is only 30 minutes from Venice, with trains running as frequently
as every few minutes during rush hours; the fare is about 4 ($6.40).
The tourist office (% 049-875-2077; www.padovanet.it) is at the train
station, as well as at Galleria Pedrocchi, off Piazza Cavour (% 049-
876-7927; open Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.).
Seeing the sights
The Padova Card (% 049-876-7927; www.padovacard.it) is an excel-
lent deal, granting one adult (and one child under 14) free public trans-
portation, admission to the 12 major attractions in town (except the
1/$1.60 reservation fee for the Scrovegni Chapel), and assorted dis-
counts. It’s available in several versions: the 48-hour card costs 15
($24), while the 72-hour card costs 20 ($32); they’re available from the
tourist information desks, some hotels, and the Scrovegni Chapel (pur-
chase online with reservation).
Walking distance from the rail station, or a short bus ride away, the
Cappella degli Scrovegni (Arena Chapel), Piazza Eremitani 8 (% 049-
201-0020; www.cappelladegliscrovegni.it), which Giotto, a master
of emotion and artistic technique, adorned with gorgeous frescoes from
1303 to 1306, is the key attraction in town. Admission is 11 ($18); free
with Padova Card; children 5 and under are free. Mandatory reserva-
tions fees cost 1 ($1.60) per person. It’s open daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
(closed Jan 1, Dec 25, and Dec 26).
The chapel is accessible from the courtyard of the Musei Civici di
Eremitani (% 049-820-4550), a museum housing an archaeological col-
lection on the ground floor, a Giotto Crucifix, and minor works by major
14th-century Venetian painters (including Giorgione, Jacopo Bellini,
Veronese, and Tintoretto).
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
478

Padova’s other great sight is the eastern-looking Basilica di Sant’Antonio,
Piazza del Santo 11 (% 049-878-9722). Admission is free, and the basilica
is open daily 6:20 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. in summer, 6:20 a.m. to 7 p.m. in winter.
Outside, the basilica is all domes and mini-minarets, while altars inside
feature Donatello bronzes. Be sure to see the north transept for the tomb
of St. Anthony and the south transept for a 14th-century fresco of the
Crucifixion. A beautiful bronze sculpture of a man on horseback, called
Gattamelata, also by Donatello, dominates the church’s piazza.
The town has many other interesting attractions, including the extrava-
gantly neoclassical Caffè Pedrocchi, Piazzetta Pedrocchi 15 (% 049-
820-5007; www.caffepedrocchi.it), which has been the main intellec-
tual gathering place since its opening in 1831, with its elegant 19th-
century original furniture on the upper floor. Admission is 3 ($4.80),
and it’s open daily 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 3:30 to 8 p.m. Also highly
recommended is a boat tour: Consorzio Battellieri di Padova e Riviera
del Brenta, Passeggio de Gasperi 3 (% 049-820-9825; www.padova
navigazione.it), offers several itineraries, including a tour of the
Venetian villas along the Riviera del Brenta, which starts in Padova and
brings you to Venice (a great way to get into Venice). Boats run from
March through October.
Where to stay and dine
The best hotel in town is the Majestic Hotel Toscanelli, Via dell’Arco 2
(% 049-663244; Fax: 049-876-0025; www.toscanelli.com; Rack rates:
178/$285 double, including buffet breakfast). Another good hotel is the
Plaza, Corso Milano 40 (% 049-656822; Fax: 049-661117; www.plaza
padova.it; Rack rates: 220/$352 double, including buffet breakfast).
A temple to good wine, Per Bacco, Piazzale Pontecorvo 10 (% 049-
875-4664; www.per-bacco.it; open Tues–Sun noon to 2:30 p.m. and
7:30–11 p.m.), also offers wonderful, creative food. The Osteria Speroni,
Via Speroni 36 (% 049-875-3370; open Mon–Sat 12:30–2:30 p.m. and
8–10:30 p.m.), has simpler but delicious, traditional local fare. And the
Pedrocchi (see the preceding section) now offers an excellent lunch.
Milan: Art viewing and shopping
The fashion and economic heart of northern Italy, Milan is a city of art,
with deep historical roots, and home to several gems — including one of
the best art galleries in Italy — making it well worth a detour. You can
see the highlights in a day, but spend the night if you can spare the time.
Getting there
Milan’s international airport of Malpensa (% 02-7485-2200), 50km (31
miles) north of the city, is a large airport with all the conveniences —
ATMs, tourist info point, hotel reservation service — in the arrival con-
course. The Malpensa Express train takes you to Cadorna rail station at
the west of Milan’s historic district in 40 minutes; you can also take a
shuttle bus (running every 40 minutes) for the 50-minute ride to Milano
Chapter 21: Venice and Environs 479

Centrale rail station, at the north of Milan’s historic district. Count on
70 ($112) for the taxi ride, which, depending on the traffic, could take
you over an hour.
The smaller Linate Airport (% 02-7485-2200) is only 10km (61⁄4 miles)
east of the city and handles some European and most domestic flights.
From there, it’s a 15-minute taxi ride to the center of town; if you have no
luggage, you can take the frequent (every ten minutes) city bus no. 73 to
the M1 subway line.
From Venice, you can easily reach Milano Centrale rail station on 
Piazza Duca d’Aosta in a little over two hours by train; the trip costs
about 18 ($29).
Seeing the sights
Milan is a large city, but its historic district is manageable, dominated by
the Castello Sforzesco, Porta Umberto (% 02-8846-3700; www.milano
castello.it; Metro: M1 Cairoli or M2 Lanza/Cadorna), a real castle with
crenellated walls, underground passages, and towers that you can visit
because it houses a superb sculpture museum (Michelangelo’s famous
Pietà Rondanini, his last — and unfinished — work is here) and a picture
gallery with artworks by such masters as Mantegna and Antonello da
Messina. Admission to the castle is free; museum entry is 3 ($4.80). The
castle is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in summer, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. in
winter; the museum is open Tuesday through Sunday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
(last admission at 5 p.m.; closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25).
The Duomo, Piazza Duomo (% 02-8646-3456; Metro: M1 or M3 to
Duomo), is Milan’s grandiose Gothic cathedral, second in size in Italy
only to St. Peter’s. Admission to the cathedral is free; other entry fees
include the baptistery of St. John at 2 ($3.20), the treasure 1 ($1.60),
and the terraces 5 ($8) to walk and 7 ($11) to access via the elevator.
Hours for the cathedral are daily 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; for the treasure
Monday through Friday 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2 to 6 p.m., Saturday
9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m., and Sunday 1:30 to 4 p.m.; and for
baptisteries and terraces daily 9 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. (until 4:45 p.m.
Nov–Jan). Last admission is 30 minutes earlier.
Head inside Santa Maria delle Grazie, Piazza S. Maria delle Grazie 2, off Corso
Magenta (% 02-8942-1146 for reservations; www.cenacolovinciano.
it; Metro: M1 Conciliazione), to view Leonardo’s painting of the Last
Supper. Admission is 6.50 ($10) plus a mandatory reservation fee of
1.50 ($2.40). It’s open Tuesday through Sunday 8:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. (last
admission 6:45 p.m.).
Reservations are mandatory for The Last Supper, and you need to make
them a minimum of 24 hours in advance.
The Brera Picture Gallery, Via Brera 28 (% 02-722631; www.brera.
beniculturali.it; Metro: M2 to Lanza), is a stunning art collection
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
480

attached to the Art Academy. Among the best paintings are Piero della
Francesca’s famous Pala di Urbino, Raffaello’s Sposalizio della Vergine,
Andrea Mantegna’s Cristo Morto, and Caravaggio’s Cena di Emmaus.
Admission is 5 ($8), and it’s open Tuesday through Saturday 8:30 a.m.
to 7:15 p.m. (last admission 6:30 p.m.).
But shopping is what drives many visitors to Milan, from the elegant
boutiques lining Via Montenapoleone and nearby Via della Spiga and
Via Sant’Andrea, to the many outlets selling discounted items, some-
times off the runways. Try D Magazine Outlet, Via Montenapoleone 26
(% 02-7600-6027), and Biffi, Corso Ganova 6 (% 02-831-1601; Metro:
San Ambrogio), specializing in women’s clothing in the main store and
men’s clothing across the street.
Where to stay and dine
Milan is very expensive. The best hotel in town is the Four Seasons, Via
Gesù 8, off Via Montenapoleone (% 02-77088; Fax: 02-7708-5000; www.
fourseasons.com; Rack rates: 730–860/$1,168–$1,376 double). A
good moderate choice is the Hotel Manzoni, Via Santo Spirito 20 
(% 02-7600-5700; Fax: 02-784212; www.hotelmanzoni.com; Rack rates:

find vaporetto stops. They also sell a good
map for 2.50 ($4). Others are available at
most bookstores and newsstands around
town.
Newspapers and Magazines
Most newsstands in town sell English

tion, available in all major hotels, is Un
Ospite a Venezia, a guide on everything
useful, from public transportation to special
events.
Pharmacies

Safety
Venice is very safe, even in the off-the-
beaten-path solitary areas. The only real
danger is pickpockets, always plentiful in
areas with lots of tourists: Watch your bags
and cameras, and don’t display wads of
money or jewelry.
Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing smok-
ing in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,

at your table is important to you, call
beforehand to make sure that the restau-
rant or cafe you’ll be visiting offers a smok-
ing area.

Madrid and 
the Best of Castile
In This Chapter
 Getting to Madrid
 Finding your way around the city
 Discovering the best hotels and Spanish cuisine
 Exploring an art lover’s paradise
 Getting out of town to Toledo, El Escorial, and Segovia
M
adrid is Spain’s political and cultural, as well as geographic,
center. With a splendid roster of museums, Madrid ranks as one
of Europe’s foremost art centers. And while it’s the home of the Prado
Museum, with its untold masterpieces by Velázquez and Goya, as well as
Picasso’s Guernica, it’s also a city full of other, more down-to-earth
images we’ve come to expect of Spain. Bulls still charge after matadors
and red capes in the hot afternoon sun. Madrid nights still overflow with
tapas joints, wine taverns, flamenco joints, and discos. Madrid thrives
on its reputation as a place where you may find yourself going to bed at
the time when you’d normally get up.
With less than 500 years under its belt, Madrid is one of Europe’s
youngest capital cities. It remained a small medieval town until the 16th
and 17th centuries, Spain’s Golden Age of exploration and wealth. In
1561, at the height of the era, Felipe II moved the court from Toledo to
Madrid.
You can hit the major museums by day, embark upon an impromptu
tapas crawl, and soak up theater, opera, and flamenco by night. The city’s
atmospheric mesones and tascas — cavelike restaurants and taverns —
get the night started. When the sun goes down, you find that Madrileños,
the people of Madrid, are among the most open and gregarious in Spain.
And just beyond the city are the attractions El Escorial, Toledo, and
Segovia, perfect for easy day trips.
Though serious art aficionados could easily spend a week in the capital,
if you only want a taste of Madrid you’ll still need at least a couple of

days to see the Prado and some of Viejo (Old) Madrid and rest up
enough to check out the city’s dizzying nightlife.
Getting There
Madrid is a long, 12-hour train ride from Paris, the closest non-Spanish
city in this book — so unless you’re arriving in Madrid from elsewhere in
Spain, flying here is probably a good idea. You can jump on a quick shut-
tle flight or the new, high-speed AVE train from Barcelona. After you
arrive, you’ll find that Madrid’s local transportation system is efficient
and relatively easy to use.
Arriving by air
Madrid’s recently expanded airport, Barajas (% 902-40-47-04 or
91-305-83-43; www.aena.es), is about 16km (10 miles) outside town. In
the arrivals hall, you’ll find ATMs, banks at which you can change
money, and a post office. High-tech Terminal 4 handles most interna-
tional flights and is a shuttle bus away from the other terminals.
The airport’s tourist information office (Oficina de Información
Turística; % 91-305-86-56) is open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Line 8 of the Metro, or subway (www.metromadrid.es), runs from the
airport to the Nuevos Ministerios stop (12 minutes), and then another 
15 minutes from there to downtown (fare is 2/$3.20). Or you can take a
red city bus no. 200 (www.emtmadrid.es) to Avenida América in the city
center for 1 ($1.60), and then board the Metro for your destination from
there. The ten-trip Metrobus ticket (see “Getting Around Madrid,” later in
this chapter) may be used for both the subway and the airport bus,
although you’ll pay a 1 ($1.60) supplement. A taxi into town is about
25 ($40), plus tip and airport and baggage-handling surcharges. Plan 
on 45 minutes to an hour of travel time from the airport to downtown.
Arriving by rail
If you take the train to Madrid, you’ll most likely arrive at the city’s main
station, Chamartín (% 91-323-21-21), the hub for trains coming from
eastern Spain and France (international train routes come through the
France–Spain border). From Chamartín, in Madrid’s northern suburbs,
you can get downtown quickly on Metro Line 10.
Madrid has two other train stations. Trains to and from southwest Spain
and Portugal come into Atocha (% 91-563-02-02). (Confusingly, two
Metro stops also go by the name Atocha; the one marked ATOCHA RENFE is
the one beneath Atocha train station; the Atocha Metro stop is one stop
north of Atocha RENFE.) Norte, or Príncipe Pío, serves northwest Spain.
RENFE is the name of the Spanish national train service; for information,
call % 902-24-02-02 or visit www.renfe.es.
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 485

Orienting Yourself in Madrid
Madrid has no natural landmarks useful for getting your bearings,
though it does have several major plazas (squares) and elegant boule-
vards linking them, which will help you master the city’s layout. Your
best bet is to orient yourself using the Metro (subway) map, because
most destinations are close to a Metro stop.
You want to spend most of your time in Old Madrid (near the Plaza Mayor)
and Bourbon Madrid (including the Prado Museum and Retiro Park).
Introducing the neighborhoods
Plaza del Sol marks the very center of Madrid (and all of Spain, for that
matter — all distances within the country are measured from a 0km
mark in the plaza’s southwest corner). The nearby Plaza Mayor is more
scenic and is flanked by cafes and colonnades; in the center sits an
equestrian statue of Felipe III. These two plazas constitute the heart of
Viejo Madrid (Old Madrid), an area filled with authentic Spanish restau-
rants and nightlife hot spots. Madrid’s 17th-century district lies south of
Plaza del Sol.
The wide, modern Plaza de España marks the northwest corner of the
city. Calle Bailén runs south from there, bordering the Palacio Real
(royal palace) and marking the city’s western edge. Madrid’s main boule-
vard, Gran Vía, zigzags from Plaza de España across the northern Old
City. Department stores, cafes, movie theaters, and office buildings line
the grand boulevard. North of it are the Malasana and Chueca districts,
both trendy nightlife zones. Chueca in particular has gone from being a
little rough around the edges to becoming perhaps the coolest barrio, as
well as the epicenter of gay life in the capital.
Old Madrid’s east side is bordered by the tree-planted Paseo del Prado,
which runs from north to south from Plaza de la Cibeles through Plaza
del Castillo to the Atocha train station square. Hotels, cafes, and the
city’s major museums line the avenue. Vast Retiro Park lies on the east
side of the Paseo.
Finding information after you arrive
Barajas Airport has an Oficina de Información Turística (% 91-305-86-56),
open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The municipal Centro de Turismo de
Madrid, Plaza Mayor, 3 (% 91-588-16-36; www.munimadrid.es; Metro: Sol),
is open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m.
to 3 p.m. The regional government’s tourism office in Madrid is at Duque 
de Medinaceli, 2 (% 91-429-49-51 or 902-10-00-07; Metro: Banco de España),
open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. The general tourist information numbers are % 902-10-21-12 and
% 010.

Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 487
Getting Around Madrid
Madrid is large and sprawling, but the places that interest most visitors
are in a fairly compact area. In fact, you can walk much of Madrid.
By subway
The Metro (% 012 or 902-444-403; www.metromadrid.es), marked by
red and blue diamond-shaped signs, is Madrid’s subway system, by far
the fastest and easiest way to navigate the city. Stops are near almost
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile

everywhere you want to go. Single-ticket fares are 1 ($1.60). Hours are
daily from 6 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. You can find a handy map (plano del metro)
at Metro stations.
A ten-trip ticket (Metrobus) is available for 6.70 ($11), a nearly half-
price bargain. It pays for itself after just six journeys on the Metro, and
can be used by additional passengers. You’ll use it up in no time, and it
also works on the bus. Also worth considering is the Abono Turístico, a
pass (available for one, two, three, five, or seven days) good for all
public transportation within Madrid; prices range from 4 ($6.40) for
one day to 21 ($34) for the seven-day pass (passes for children 10 and
under are half-price). The passes can be purchased at any Metro station,
Oficina de Turismo, or online (www.neoturismo.com).
By bus
The bus proves a bit complicated for first-time visitors. Conductors gen-
erally don’t speak English, and with all the traffic on the wide avenues
and tiny streets, getting a read on the city from the window of a bus is
tough. Buses run from 6 a.m. to midnight daily; the fare is 1 ($1.60). For
information, call % 012.
By taxi
Authorized taxis are white with diagonal red bands. Few taxi journeys in
town, other than the ride in from the airport, cost more than 8 to 10
($13–$16). You can hail a cab in the street (a green light on the roof
means it’s available) or pick one up where they line up (usually outside
hotels). A slightly higher night rate is charged from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. If
you need to call a cab, call % 91-447-32-32, 91-405-55-00, or 91-371-21-31.
By foot
Except for a couple of easily managed neighborhoods, Madrid is one of
the few European cities where you won’t want to spend much time
strolling around on foot. The wide boulevards are great for getting from
place to place, but most offer relatively little in the way of character.
With a couple of notable exceptions, such as the Plaza Mayor and other
parts of Old Madrid, you won’t miss much by traveling underground on
the Metro or hopping a cab to your destination.
Staying in Madrid
Madrid offers three main types of sleeping accommodations: regular
hotels, which can be anything from deluxe, elegant turn-of-the-last-century
establishments to modern, moderately priced inns; hostales, bare-bones
businesses where travelers usually get good value for their money; and
pensiones, even simpler, less-expensive boardinghouses, often requiring
half or full board (meals taken on premises).
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
488

Many hotels are scattered along the Gran Vía, which isn’t the greatest of
places to be walking after dark, and near Atocha Station. Old Madrid
also has a good selection of accommodations ringing the central squares
Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol. These areas attract their share of pick-
pockets because they’re popular travel destinations, but due to their
proximity to prime dining and sightseeing, they’re also among the most
exciting places to be in Madrid.
The tourism office maintains a Hotel Tourist Line at % 901-300-600.
Most hotel rates don’t include breakfast or IVA, the 7 percent value-
added tax. To ensure the bill doesn’t shock you at the end of your stay,
make sure you ask about these taxes when booking your room.
Madrid’s top hotels
AC Palacio del Retiro
$$$$$
Bourbon Madrid (near Retiro Park)
It would be hard to improve upon the location of this midsize luxury hotel
(50 rooms), which overlooks Retiro Park and is just a few short blocks from
the Prado Museum. Inaugurated in 2004, it also has terrific bones, inhabit-
ing a gorgeous, early-20th-century palace (a National Heritage–protected
structure) that features a gorgeous central staircase, stained-glass win-
dows, and marble columns. Rooms are sleek, respecting the original style
of the building but adding some contemporary flair. The hotel has all the
facilities, including a spa, that make it perfect for business and leisure trav-
elers alike. Although the AC Palacio is definitely a high-end hotel and simi-
lar in character and luxury to Madrid’s mega-splurge, grandaddy hotels,
such as the Palace or the Ritz, it’s quite a bit less expensive than those.

Casa de Madrid
$$$$
Viejo Madrid
This intimate and refined residence, in a late-18th-century town house,
takes the concept of B&B to a level rarely seen. In the center of old
Hapsburg Madrid, near the Opera House and Royal Palace, it’s a unique
place to experience high style and luxury. It’s on a par with Madrid’s very
finest hotels, and though it’s not inexpensive, it is a relatively good deal
given what you’d pay to stay at the Ritz or a super high-end boutique hotel.
The sprawling second-floor apartment has seven rooms decorated with
exquisite, old-world taste, featuring beautiful antiques and themes related
to the owner’s travels. Note that not all rooms have air-conditioning,
though a couple feature kitchenettes. Shockingly, pets are permitted.

Hotel de las Letras
$$$$–$$$$$
Gran Vía
This stylish hotel, in a 1917 Art Deco building on Madrid’s famed Gran Vía,
wears its literary ambitions in its name — “Hotel of Letters” — and on its
walls. The modern, chic, and boldly colored rooms (each floor is a differ-
ent color) feature inscriptions from famous writers and poets, and a library
has comfy couches where guests can curl up with a work of great fiction.
Yet it’s anything but stuffy; it has a young and cool vibe. Other great ameni-
ties include a terrific rooftop terrace, with great views of the city; a small
spa, with a steam room, workout space, and massage rooms; and a hip
cocktail lounge. Good advance deals are available online.

Dining in Madrid
For years, dining in Madrid has meant either big, fancy restaurants where
elegant service is king, charming Viejo Madrileño taverns, or tapas,
which are really eating as an excuse for drinking. With a recently invigor-
ated dining scene, Madrid is trying to catch up to Bilbao, San Sebastián,
and Barcelona, where creativity has been more valued. As the capital, of
course, Madrid has all the regional specialties, a wide variety of interna-
tional cuisines, and fresh seafood flown in from the coasts. While you can
easily find Spain’s trademark dish, paella (a Mediterranean medley of
seafood and rice usually eaten at lunch), locals tend to go for roasted
meats, especially cordero (lamb) and cochinillo (suckling pig). Spain is the
place to be if you like pork; in many restaurants chorizo sausage and salty
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 493

jamón serrano ham hang from the ceiling and literally nearly hit patrons
in the face.
Spaniards maintain a different eating schedule than the rest of the
Continent, and Madrileños eat even later than the rest of their country-
men. Many still find time to eat their biggest meal between 1 and 4 p.m.,
while dinner is usually no earlier than 10 p.m. Some restaurants that try
to attract international travelers serve dinner as early as 8 p.m. (which
technically is still the tarde, or afternoon, in Spain), but Spaniards would
never think of dining that early. Most good, authentic restaurants don’t
even open their doors until 9 or 9:30 p.m.
The city’s tascas (tapas restaurants) and mesones (cavelike taverns) are
ideal places to stop in for a vinito (bee-nee-toe; small glass of wine), jerez
(hair-eth; dry sherry), and a smattering of tapas. Tapas are snacks eaten
in small portions and can be as prosaic as olives or as elaborate as small
meals. Spaniards spend late afternoons and evenings on the tapas prowl,
or tapeo — strolling from tasca to tasca to drink, chat, and chomp.
(You’ll find descriptions of some of the better tascas and some typical
tapas in “More cool things to see and do,” later in this chapter.)
Botín
$$$
Viejo Madrid
CASTILIAN
You want classic Madrid? Botín can serve up the stalwarts of Castilian
cooking: roast suckling pig and roast leg of lamb prepared in ancient wood
ovens. Prepare to meet your neighbors from back home in this crowded
spot, though. Everyone seems to know that Botín has the reputation of
being the oldest continuously operating restaurant in the world (it hasn’t
closed its doors since 1725). A favorite with families who don’t mind the
bustling nature of the place, Botín doubles as a history lesson for kids.
How’s this for pedigree? Francisco de Goya, the legendary painter, was
once a dishwasher at the restaurant Botín. Not good enough? Okay, how
about the fact that Hemingway set a scene in The Sun Also Rises in this
famed restaurant?

Casa Lucío

CASTILIAN
A historic tavern on one of Madrid’s famous night-crawler streets, the Casa
Lucío is a favorite spot for locals to take their foreign visitors. With its cin-
ematic, cavelike ambience and hanging forest of cured hams, it’s the kind
of place that has you considering a sabbatical in Spain before you finish
the first bottle of wine. The famous faces and sharply dressed crowd only
add to the buzz. The food is top-quality comfort food — like the house mer-
luza (hake, a white fish similar to cod), shrimp in garlic sauce, roasted

CREATIVE INTERNATIONAL
Perched like a tree fort in the mini-botanical gardens of the Atocha train sta-

Excellent main courses include beef tenderloin, squid in its ink, and ravioli
stuffed with asparagus. The dark rattan chairs, peaked wooden ceiling and
fans, long wall of red banquets, and tropical greenery flooding your view
evoke a colonial outpost — and may be enough to trick you into believing
that the train you’re about to board is an old steamer rather than a high-
speed rail to Seville.

Exploring Madrid
Madrid has the greatest concentration of important museums in Spain —
and more first-class works by Spanish masters including El Greco,
Velázquez, Goya, and Picasso (among others) than anywhere else. If you
can hit only the top two or three, begin with the newly expanded Prado
and the Royal Palace (which qualifies as a museum of sorts). Allow a full
morning or afternoon for the Prado and a couple of hours for the Royal
Palace. In Viejo Madrid, around the Plaza Mayor, spend a couple of hours
(preferably in the early evening, when tapas crawlers are out and about)
and discover the city’s soul in its cinematic mesones and tascas.
If you’re a serious art lover and are banking on hitting the Madrid’s Big
Three — the Prado, the Thyssen-Bornemisza, and the Reina Sofía muse-
ums, all along a stretch of the Paseo del Prado — within hours of landing in
Madrid, make sure that your visit isn’t on a Monday or Tuesday. The first
two museums are closed on Monday, and the Reina Sofía collection shuts
its doors on Tuesday. None of them closes for lunch, though, and occasion-
ally, lunchtime is the best time to visit (when everyone else takes a break,
from 1–4 p.m. or so). Architecture and art fans should also check out the
newest addition to Paseo del Prado, the brand-new CaixaForum Madrid,
Paseo del Prado, 36 (% 91-330-73-00; www.fundacio.lacaixa.es/
centros/caixaforummadrid_ca.html), a spectacular arts and cultural
center designed by the Swiss team Herzog & de Meuron, that opened in
February 2008. The redesigned building, which was once a power plant,
houses three floors of galleries and a cool restaurant, and it has spurred
some interesting development in the neighborhood Barrio de las Letras,
once famed for its literary connections.
The Madrid Card Billete Turístico — available in one-, two-, and three-
day versions — allows for unlimited travel on the subway (in Zone A),
unlimited travel on the Madrid Visión tour bus, as well as free entry to
more than 40 museums (including the Prado, Thyssen, Reina Sofía,
Palacio Real, Aranjuez, and El Escorial) and a host of additional dis-
counts at restaurants and other places of interest. Tickets, though,
aren’t cheap: 42 ($67) for the one-day ticket; 55 ($88) for the two-day;
and 68 ($109) for the three-day. You can purchase them online, at the
Plaza Mayor and Duque de Medinaceli Oficinas de Turismo, or airport
and train stations. For more information, call % 91-360-47-72 or
902-088-908, or go to www.madridcard.com (discounts available for
online purchase).
Be extremely careful around the Prado and other museum tourist
haunts, where thieves artfully prey upon unsuspecting tourists. If some-
one offers to clean mustard or some other substance off your clothing,
recognize it as a trick and refuse assistance: The thief is the one who put
the mustard there, and he (or an accomplice) will proceed to rob you
after distracting you.

Madrid’s top sights
Museo Nacional del Prado
Bourbon Madrid
Many experts consider the Prado, with more than a dozen of the world’s
most famous paintings in its vast holdings, to rank just behind the Louvre
in Paris among the greatest art museums in Europe. The Prado boasts the
world’s richest and most complete collection of Spanish Old Masters, easily
making the museum one of the top attractions in Spain (in fact, it’s the most-
visited site in the country). Don’t miss it — unless the thought of classical
painting makes your skin crawl. The museum has finally completed a mas-
sive expansion and renovation project, by the celebrated Spanish architect
Rafael Moneo, which doubled the Prado’s exhibition space. The Prado’s
12th- through 19th-century collection of the Spanish school includes mas-
terpieces by Velázquez, Goya, El Greco, Murillo, Ribera, and Zurbarán. The
Velázquez and Goya collections are the star draws; so go directly to the gal-
leries featuring their works if your time or interest is limited. Expect crowds
there, though; as you approach the room where Velázquez’s masterpiece,
Las Meninas (The Ladies-in-Waiting), hangs, you can hear the growing
rumble of guides and groups. The Prado also has extraordinary works by
Italian masters — including Titian, Fra Angelico, Raphael, Caravaggio, and
Botticelli — and Flemish greats Hieronymus Bosch, Peter Paul Rubens, and
Breughel the Elder. The lineup of masterpieces includes Fra Angelico’s
Annunciation (1430); El Greco’s eerie Adoration of the Shepherds (1614); José
de Ribera’s The Martyrdom of St. Philip (1630); Rubens’s fleshy Three Graces
(1739); the freaky triptych The Garden of Earthly Delights, painted by ierony-
mus Bosch (“El Bosco” to the Spanish) in 1516; and Goya’s Naked Maja and
Clothed Maja, as well as his “Black Paintings,” the most disturbing and
famous of which is Saturn Devouring One of His Sons (1823).
To try to beat the crowds at the Prado, enter through the Velázquez door
(facing Paseo del Prado), and go early (9 a.m.) or during the Spanish lunch
hour (2–4 p.m.). To save on admission, go in the evening, when the museum
is free. If you’re an art aficionado, purchasing a room-by-room guide is a
good idea.

Palacio Real de Madrid
Viejo Madrid
Occupying the site of a ninth-century Moorish alcázar (fortress), the Royal
Palace built by Spain’s Bourbon monarchs makes a grandiose statement
about Madrid’s place in the world, around 1750. Each room is an exercise
in megawatt wealth, and taste flies out the window. The huge neoclassical
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 497

palace — it has 2,000 rooms — incorporated the lavish tastes of both
Carlos III and Carlos IV. The official residence of the royal family until 1931,
it’s now used only for state functions, because King Juan Carlos and Queen
Sofía live in more modest digs, the Zarzuela Palace just beyond Madrid.
Allow two to three hours to visit the palace; guided tours are optional but
not really necessary or particularly worthwhile.
Of special note are the Throne Room, with its scarlet wall coverings,
baroque gilded mirrors, and a Tiepolo fresco on the ceiling; the regal Gala
Dining Room, which shows off a spectacular dining table and jaw-dropping
tapestries; and the Porcelain Room, covered floor to ceiling in a garish dis-
play of green, white, and purple porcelain. Check out the old Royal
Pharmacy (near the ticket office), which has Talavera pottery jars and old
recipe books of medications. In the Real Armería is a fine display of arms
and armor. Wander to the edge of the large Plaza de la Armería (Royal
Armory Square) that faces the palace, and you see how abruptly Madrid
ends and the plains begin. Look also for the new temporary exhibits hall,
part of what will eventually become the Museum of Royal Collections (with
a permanent display of carriages, tapestries, paintings, silver, and crystal
belonging to Spain’s long lines of monarchs).
If you visit the Royal Palace on the first Wednesday of the month, you have
a chance to see the ceremonial changing of the guards (at noon for free).
And if you’re carrying a European Union passport, you can get into the
Royal Palace for free on Wednesdays, too.

winter Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun and holidays 9 a.m.–2 p.m.
Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía
Bourbon Madrid
The third address on Madrid’s celebrated Art Avenue — the Paseo del
Prado — is the Queen Sofía contemporary art museum. It boasts major
works from Spain’s 20th-century greats, such as Picasso, Miró, Dalí, and
Julio González, but it’s Pablo Picasso’s dramatic Guernica, the most famous
painting of the 20th century, that dwarfs them all. The massive canvas in
gray, black, and white is a moving antiwar protest. (Picasso painted it after
the Nationalist bombing of a small Basque town during the Civil War.)
The Reina Sofía is especially strong in early-20th-century works by Spanish
artists as well as contemporary international movements such as abstract
art, pop art, and minimalism. The museum underwent a spectacular ren-
ovation and amplification, adding three new buildings by the French archi-
tect Jean Nouvel, in 2004. If you’re a contemporary art lover, you’ll want to
spend almost as much time here as at the Prado; allow a couple of hours
at a minimum for your visit.

Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza
Bourbon Madrid
Across the street from the Prado, the museum with a decidedly un-
Spanish, tongue-twister of a name has quickly become a premier attrac-
tion in Madrid. In 1993, the Spanish government acquired the spectacular
private collection amassed by the Baron Thyssen-Bornemisza and his son,
two generations of German industrial magnates.
The Spanish government renovated the early-19th-century pink Villahermosa
palace to show its new bounty. Begun in the 1920s, the Thyssen collection
comprises 800 stylistically diverse works and aims to be no less than a
survey of Western art, from primitives and medieval art to 20th-century
avant-garde and pop art. Displayed chronologically (starting from the top
floor) and heavy on Impressionism and German Expressionism, the collec-
tion reads like a roster of the greatest names in classical and modern art:
Caravaggio, Rafael, Titian, El Greco, Goya, Rubens, Degas, Gauguin, Cézanne,
Manet, van Gogh, Picasso, Chagall, Miró, and Pollock. Some observers tout
it as the greatest private collection ever assembled, while others criticize it
as a showy collection of minor works by major artists. In 2004, the museum
doubled in size, to accommodate 700 works on long-term loan from the
Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection. By almost any standard, the
museum is a worthwhile complement to the great Prado, a must-see for fans
of classical painting.

Monasterio de las Descalzas Reales
Viejo Madrid
A visit to this former royal palace — and splendid example of Renaissance
architecture — is a retreat from Madrid’s modern madness. Converted into
a convent for women in the mid-16th century, it’s anything but plain. A grand,
fresco-lined staircase takes visitors to an upper cloister gallery with a series
of extravagant chapels. The convent’s collection of religious art by the Old
Masters is exceptional. The highlights are Breughel’s Adoration of the Magi,
Zurbarán’s Saint Francis, Titian’s Caesar’s Coin, and a priceless collection of
16th-century tapestries. Visitation hours at the convent, where a small group
of cloistered nuns still live, are peculiar and not always adhered to.
This small museum has a past as fascinating as its name (Monastery of the
Royal Barefoot Franciscans). The daughter of the Emperor Carlos V, Juana
of Austria, founded the convent of Poor Clares in a noble palace. The
women of noble families that entered the nunnery brought sizable
dowries, mostly great works of art. Nobles also squirreled away their
young, illegitimate daughters here to be reared by the nuns.

Admission to the convent is by 45-minute guided tour (in Spanish) only;
note that hours are rather limited.

More cool things to see and do
 Milling around Viejo Madrid: One of the best ways to absorb the
flavor of Madrid is to stroll the atmospheric streets of the Old City,
where you uncover remnants of medieval Madrid and the city later
built by the Hapsburgs. A good place to start is in the Plaza Mayor.
Along Calle Mayor is Plaza de la Villa, Madrid’s old town square; the
cluster of handsome buildings dates to the 15th and 16th centuries.
The oldest structure is the Torre de los Lujanes, a mudéjar (Moorish
and Christian architectural mix) construction with a tall, minaret-
like structure. Casa de la Villa, on the opposite side of the plaza, was
built in 1640 and once housed both the town hall and city jail. Casa
de Cisneros is a reconstructed 16th-century palace with a splendid
Plateresque facade. South of the Plaza Mayor, beyond Calle Segovia,
is Plaza de la Paja, a pretty and quiet space that was medieval
Madrid’s commercial center. On this plaza is Madrid’s only Gothic
building, the Capilla del Obispo (Bishop’s Chapel). Nearby is the
Moorish-looking 14th-century San Pedro church. Just east is a
jumble of some of Madrid’s most animated streets, full of tapas bars:
Cava Baja, Cava Alta, Almendro, and Calle del Nuncio.
 Sifting through the hidden treasures of the El Rastro flea market:
This busy flea market, a Madrid institution, is one of the biggest in
Europe. Although it’s less full of good and interesting items like
antiques than it once was, you can find almost anything — including
used car parts, paintings, secondhand clothes, and more. Stalls are
open Sunday from dawn to 2 p.m. Take the Metro to La Latina; the
market fills the streets around Ribera de Curtidores and Plaza
Cascorro. Get ready to haggle over prices, and beware of pickpockets.
 Seeing the spectacle of a bullfight: Mixing barbarism with ballet and
viewed as a cross between sport and art form, bullfighting draws the
best and bravest young men (and even a few women) from all cor-
ners of Spain. In Spain, top bullfighters are awarded the celebrity of
movie stars or sports heroes, but their fame can be even more fleet-
ing. One misjudgment, one stray move into the bull’s charge, and
their midsections can literally take the bull by the horns.
If the sight of blood or the thought of animal cruelty sickens you,
don’t even think of attending one, but for the less squeamish or
conflicted, the spectacle of the corridas (bullfights) offers a
uniquely Spanish slice of life.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
500

If you can’t stomach a corrida or you land in Madrid out of season,
you can visit the Museo Taurino (Bullfighting Museum; free admis-
sion), a modest place with portraits of famous matadors, jewel-
encrusted capes and jackets, stuffed bull heads, and Goya etchings.
Don’t miss the bloody traje de luces (suit of lights) that the leg-
endary Manolete was wearing when he was gored to death.
To see the bullring, visit during the bullfighting season (May–Oct) and
choose either a sol (sun) or sombra (shadows) seat. A word of advice:
Spring for the more expensive sombra seat. You can roast like a 
suckling pig in the sol. For tickets to bullfights (4–115/$6.40–$184),
visit the ticket booth at the Plaza de Toros de la Venta, call % 91-
356-22-00 for information, or visit www.las-ventas.com.
 Sampling wines and snacks during paseo: From about 5 to 8 p.m.,
Spaniards young and old participate in a time-honored ritual, the
evening paseo, tiding themselves over until the late 10 p.m. dinner
hour by visiting tapas bars. Just saddle up to the bar and snack on
such Spanish specialties as chorizo (sausage), jamón serrano (salty
ham), tortilla española (wedges of onion and potato omelet), albondi-
gas (meatballs), calamares fritos (fried squid), gambas al la plancha
(grilled shrimp), and queso manchego (sheep’s milk cheese). Eating at
the bar is cheaper than grabbing a table. The best areas are around
the Plaza de Santa Ana, Plaza Mayor, and the Latina/Lavapies neigh-
borhoods, especially the Cava Baja and Cava Alta streets.
• Latina/Lavapies (Metro: La Latina): More than 200 years old,
and a classic of bullfighting ambience, Taberna de Antonio
Sánchez, Mesón de Paredes, 13 (% 91-539-78-26), is as
authentic as they come. It may be the oldest tavern in
Madrid. The name Taberna de Cien Vinos, Calle del Nuncio,
17 (% 91-365-47-04), means “Tavern of 100 Wines,” but it
offers much more than that, including some great tapas, such
as roast beef and salt cod. Casa Antonio, Latoneros, 10 
(% 91-429-93-56), is a Madrid classic with a zinc bar, Moorish
tiles, and bright red doors.
• Santa Ana/Huertas (Metro: Sol/Antón Martín): You find an
excellent assortment of tapas, such as anchovies and home-
made canapés, at the very traditional, tile-lined Taberna de
Dolores, Plaza Jesús, 4 (% 91-429-22-43; Metro: Banco de
Sevilla). Casa Alberto, Calle de las Huertas, 18 (% 91-
429-93-56; Metro: Antón Martín), an 1827 taberna with a front
tapas bar and charming little restaurant in back, is a classic:
Don Quixote’s creator, Cervantes, once lived at this address.
• Plaza Mayor (Metro: Sol): The house specialty at Mesón del
Champigñon, Cava de San Miguel, 17 (% 91-559-67-90), is as
the name implies: garlicky mushrooms that are stuffed,
grilled, salted, you name it. Mesón de la Guitarra, Cava de
San Miguel, 13 (% 91-559-95-31; Metro: Sol), is what you
expect to find in Madrid; it’s almost always hopping with
boisterous patrons, and wine and song flow freely.
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 501

 Rocking to flamenco rhythms: Flamenco is one of Spain’s most
treasured cultural expressions, a hypnotic and rhythmic music of
suffering and eroticism. It evolved in Spain’s unwanted classes of
Jews and Moors during the Middle Ages, and was later appropri-
ated and interpreted through the Gypsy culture of Andalusia. The
finest and most authentic flamenco music and dancing breaks out
spontaneously in bars in the wee hours of the morning, when revel-
ers strum guitars, clap their hands, play castanets, and begin
moving gracefully to the rhythm.
Although lacking in spontaneity, flamenco club performances can be
just as much of a spectacle. Shows usually start at 10:30 or 11 p.m. and
last until 2 or 3 a.m., but many clubs open around 9 p.m. to serve (a
rather expensive) dinner before the show. (A better idea is to eat at a
regular restaurant and then head to the club just for the performance.)
Among the more reliable clubs (performances range from 25–35/
$40–$56, usually include one drink, and can be booked online) are
Casa Patas, Cañizares, 10 (% 91-369-04-96; www.casapatas.com;
Metro: Tirso de Molina); Corral de la Morería, Morería, 7 (% 91-
365-84-46; www.corraldelamoreria.com; Metro: La Latina), one of
the liveliest places in town and around since 1956; and the slightly
less authentic Café de Chinitas, Torija, 7 (% 91-559-51-35; www.
chinitas.com; Metro: Santo Domingo).
 Dancing the night away — literally: It may not have earned the
nickname of the city that never sleeps, but Madrid is the town that
parties determinedly until sunrise. Most Madrileños head to the
clubs and discos around 11 p.m. or midnight, but most don’t really
heat up until 2 or 3 a.m. They don’t empty out until the break of
dawn. Most clubs have an admission charge that ranges from 10
to 20 ($16–$32), which includes your first drink.
The most popular nightclubs and discos change faster than a
supermodel’s wardrobe, but some of the current hot spots include
the sprawling, anything-goes, cross-cultural Kapital, Atocha, 125
(% 91-420-29-06); the loud Joy, in the historic Teatro Eclava,
Arenal, 11 (% 91-366-37-33; Metro: Sol), Palacio Gaviria, a wildly
baroque place, Arenal, 9 (% 91-526-60-69; Metro: Puerta del Sol);
and Pachá, Barceló, 11 (% 91-447-01-28; Metro: Tribunal), the styl-
ish Madrid incarnation of the national chain that first struck a
chord in Ibiza.

program and scheduled visits, or call % 91-588-16-36 or visit www.
descubremadrid.com. Advance booking (a good idea in summer
months, and discounts available) is possible by calling % 902-22-16-22.
Most tours cost 4 ($6.40) adults, 3 ($4.80) children 4 to 12.
Suggested itineraries
If you’d rather organize your own tours, this section offers some tips for
building your own Madrid itineraries.
If you have one day
Begin your day exploring the artistic treasures of the Prado Museum —
which should hold you for several hours, at least until lunchtime. Eat a
light lunch at the Museo del Jamón on Paseo del Prado before jogging
around the corner to pay homage to Picasso’s Guernica in the Centro de
Arte Reina Sofía. That and the other modern masters will keep your
attention for a couple hours more, after which it’s time to head back to
your hotel for a well-earned siesta.
Make sure you take the time to walk through the Plaza Mayor at the
heart of town, perhaps just before setting off on your tapeo in the early
evening. This stroll through the heart of Old Madrid — from tapas bar to
tapas bar, nibbling and imbibing along the way — should last from
around 6 to 8 p.m. Head back to your hotel to rest up until 9:30 p.m. or
so, when you can safely venture out for dinner at Botín.
If you have two days
Spend Day 1 pretty much as outlined above. Start off Day 2 touring the
Palacio Royal. Afterward, head to the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte
Reina Sofía to see Picasso’s legendary, antiwar epic painting Guernica, as
well as other Spanish and international modern masters. Afterwards, you
might pop into the nearby Atocha train station for dinner at Samarkanda.
If these two days in Madrid represent the full extent of your time in
Spain — and if it’s the proper season — try to take in a bullfight at 5 p.m.
If it’s not bullfighting season, tapeo again in the evening. Either way,
catch a flamenco show in the later evening (after dinner).
If you have three days
Spend Day 1 and Day 2 as outlined in the preceding sections, and then
head off on Day 3 for a day trip to Toledo, a commanding hilltop town
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 503

that was once the capital of Spain, home to Christians, Moors, and Jews,
and also the adopted city of the Renaissance master El Greco. Find out
more about Toledo in the next section.
Traveling beyond Madrid: Three Day Trips
One of the highlights of visiting Madrid — oddly enough — is getting out
of town. Just outside the capital are some of Spain’s greatest hits, equal
as a trio to the drawing power of the capital. Each of the following is an
easy day trip from Madrid: Toledo, the one-time Spanish capital; the
imposing 16th-century palace/monastery El Escorial; and Segovia, an
easygoing town that features a castle that’s like something out of a fairy
tale and a gorgeous cathedral.
If you don’t feel like doing the minimal planning (or driving) yourself, and
you don’t mind sticking to a group’s timetable, three major players oper-
ate no-hassle day trips to the major sights outside of Madrid (El Escorial,
Aranjuez, and the Valley of the Fallen), as well as to Toledo, Ávila, and
Segovia. Prices for day tours range from 30 to about 70 ($48–$112).
Prices generally include round-trip transportation, some museum admis-
sions, and a guided tour. Contact Juliatur, Gran Vía, 68 (% 91-571-53-00;
http://netdial.caribe.net/~juliatur; Metro: Plaza de España);
Pullmantur, Plaza de Oriente, 8 (% 91-541-18-07; www.pullmantur
spain.com; Metro: Ópera); or Trapsatur, San Bernardo, 5 (% 91-542-66-66;
www.trapsatur.com; Metro: Santo Domingo).
Holy Toledo! Religious art and architecture
For most visitors interested in art and history, Toledo is probably the
best day trip from Madrid. The town and the surrounding area are desig-
nated as a national landmark, with good reason. Toledo, the capital of
Castile until the 1500s, was home to the painter El Greco and has always
been the religious center of Spain — home to the Primate of Spain and a
one-time host to a thriving Jewish community. You’ll find Toledo worth
the visit for its stunning Gothic cathedral, warren of medieval streets,
and the famous views of the city from across the river (captured on
canvas by none other than El Greco himself).
If you kick into high gear, you can tour Toledo in just a few hours,
making it a long half-day trip from Madrid. You can also spend the whole
day there and return to Madrid in the evening. But your best bet is to
spend the night in Toledo; that enables you to explore the city at a
leisurely pace after the day-tripping crowds and large buses leave.
Don’t plan to visit Toledo on a Monday, when half the sights are closed.
Getting there
Ten trains (% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es) make the journey from
Madrid’s Atocha Station to Toledo every day. The trip takes just 30 
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
504

minutes one-way. When you’re in the station just outside Toledo, bus no.
5 takes you to Plaza de Zocodover in the heart of the old city (a visitor
information kiosk is there).
The Toledo tourist office (% 925-22-08-43) is at Puerta de Bisagra, on
the north end of town (turn right out of the station, go over the bridge,
and walk along the city walls).
Seeing the sights
The immense Gothic Catedral (% 925-22-22-41) is in the center of Toledo,
on Cardenal Cisneros, s/n. Built from 1226 to 1493, the cathedral features a
gigantic carved and painted wooden reredos (screen) on the high altar,
and behind it — illuminated by a skylight — the alabaster and marble
baroque altar. Admission to the church is free, but entry to the treasury —
with its 3m-high (10-ft.), 227kg (500-lb.) gilded 16th-century monstrance
(made from gold brought back by Christopher Columbus) — costs 6
($9.60) adults, 4.50 ($7.20) seniors and students. Summer hours are
Monday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Sunday and
holidays from 2 to 6 p.m.; the cathedral closes an hour later in winter.
Although the cathedral contains works by El Greco, fans of the Greek
painter’s work won’t want to miss Iglesia de Santo Tomé, Plaza del
Conde, 2 (% 925-21-60-98). The small chapel is unremarkable, which is
not a term that could be used to describe El Greco’s masterpiece, the
majestic Burial of Count Orgaz (1586). It is a breathtaking work of art; see
if you can spot the painter himself among the figures. Admission is 1.90
($3.05), free on Wednesdays after 4 p.m.; summer hours are daily from
10 a.m. to 6:45 p.m. (until 5:45 p.m. the rest of the year).
El Greco left his imprint on Toledo to an extent that dwarfs almost any
other painter’s association with a city. Temporarily closed for restoration
is what is touted as his Toledo home, Casa y Museo de El Greco, Samuel
Leví, s/n (% 925-22-40-46), though the artist’s house and studio were
certainly in another location in the old Jewish quarter. For the sake of
tourism, this is the place set up as an El Greco museum. Nobody pre-
tends that the works in the museum are his best stuff; the collection is
primarily small portrait-style paintings of Christ and the apostles, along
with one of his famous views of Toledo. When it reopens, admission will
be 2.40 ($3.85), and hours will be Tuesday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. (until 7 p.m. in summer), Sunday 
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Many visitors are more impressed by the Renaissance-style entrance
and stairs of the Museo de Santa Cruz, Miguel de Cervantes, 3 (% 925-
22-14-02) than by the works inside this former 16th-century hospice.
Amid 15th-century tapestries, jewelry, artifacts, and swords and armor
made from Toledo’s famous damascene steel (blackened and traced with
gold wire), you find lesser works by Goya, Ribera, and the omnipresent
El Greco — who’s represented by the 1613 Assumption, one of his last
paintings. Admission is free. The museum is open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 505

What do you get when a thriving Jewish community is crushed by the
Catholic Inquisition and the local diocese takes over the temples? The
answer: a synagogue named for the Virgin Mary. The Sinagoga de Santa
María La Blanca, Reyes Católicos, 4 (% 925-22-72-57), has been
restored to its Hebrew origins, which were heavily influenced by Islamic
architecture. Built in the 1100s, it is the oldest of Toledo’s eight remain-
ing synagogues and features Moorish horseshoe arches atop the squat
columns of the spare interior. Admission is 1.90 ($3.05), and it’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 7 p.m. in summer).
The 14th-century Sinagoga del Tránsito, Samuel Leví, s/n (% 925-
22-36-65), also blends Gothic, Islamic, and traditional Hebrew motifs.
This synagogue contains a frieze inscribed with Hebrew script and set
with a coffered ceiling. The Museo Sefardí, connected to the synagogue,
preserves ancient tombs, manuscripts, and sacred objects of Toledo’s
Sephardic (Spanish Jewish) community. Admission (temple and museum
together) is 2.40 ($3.85). Hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. (until 9 p.m. in summer), and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The rebuilt Alcázar, Cuesta de Carlos V (% 925-22-16-73), dominates
the town’s skyline. It may not be much to look at now, but this fortress
withstood many a siege. In 1936, it held up during 70 days of bombing
during Spain’s Civil War. It remains closed while awaiting the installation
of the Museo del Ejército (Army Museum). When it reopens, admission
will be 2 ($3.20) adults, free for children 9 and under. Hours are likely
to remain Tuesday through Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Where to stay and dine
The Hostal del Cardenal, Paseo de Recaredo, 24 (% 925-22-49-00; Fax:
925-22-29-91; www.hostaldelcardenal.com), has a very good and rea-
sonably priced Spanish cuisine, such as roast suckling pig. But it’s better
known as one of the most appealing and affordable small hotels in town.
Doubles range from 116 to 150 ($186–$240), with free parking.
Another excellent small inn in the thick of things, right by the cathedral,
is Hostal Casa de Cisneros, Cardenal de Cisneros, 1 (% 925-22-88-28;
Fax: 925-22-31-73; www.hostal-casa-de-cisneros.com), which has
uniquely attractive double rooms for 70 to 80 ($112–$128). For an
excellent meal with stunning views of Toledo from across the river, drop
in on La Ermita, Ctra. de Circunvalación, s/n (% 925-25-31-93). The
open-air bar next door is a great spot for a predinner drink.
El Escorial: A king-size monastery
King Felipe II was nothing if not creative — and zealous. When he
needed a new royal residence in the late 16th century, instead of follow-
ing in the footsteps of his European peers and building a palace, he built
himself a live-in monastery. But not your run-of-the-mill monastery.
Fortress-thick walls enclose San Lorenzo de El Escorial, a frescoed and
tapestried complex of royal apartments, with a giant basilica, terrific art
gallery, opulent library, and Spain’s royal tombs.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
506

Other than the huge monastery, you won’t find much else in the town of
El Escorial; allow two to three hours to tour the monastery.
Getting there
From Madrid, the bus and train trips to El Escorial both take about an
hour. Buses from Madrid’s Moncha Metro station (you can buy tickets at
a kiosk in the station) drop you off right in front of the monastery. About
25 trains leave Madrid’s Atocha Station daily for El Escorial; buses meet
incoming trains to shuttle visitors the remaining mile to Plaza Virgen de
Gracia, a block east of the monastery.
The tourist office (% 918-90-53-13) is at Grimaldi, 2, north of the visitor
entrance to the complex.
Seeing the monastery
Felipe II’s royal apartments in the monastery/fortress of San Lorenzo de
El Escorial (% 91-890-78-19; www.patrimonionacional.es) are as
stark and monastic as a king could get. He was such a devout Christian
that he had his bedroom built to overlook the high altar of the impres-
sive basilica, which has four organs and a dome based on Michelangelo’s
plans for St. Peter’s in Rome. The basilica is also home to Cellini’s
Crucifix. Under the altar is the Royal Pantheon, a mausoleum containing
the remains of every Spanish king from Charles I to Alfonso XII. The
tapestried apartments of the Bourbon kings, Carlos III and Carlos IV, are
more elaborate and in keeping with the tastes of most monarchs.
Paintings such as Titian’s Last Supper, Velázquez’s The Tunic of Joseph, 
El Greco’s Martyrdom of St. Maurice, and works by Dürer, Van Dyck,
Tintoretto, and Rubens are the source of the New Museum’s popularity.
The Royal Library houses more than 40,000 antique volumes under a
barrel-vaulted ceiling frescoed by Tibaldi in the 16th century.
El Escorial is open Tuesday through Sunday and holidays from 10 a.m. to
5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer). Admission is 10 ($16) adults, 6 ($9.60)
seniors and students.
Where to dine
Even though El Escorial is an easy half-day trip from Madrid, you may
want to eat lunch before you return, so try the suitably named Mesón la
Cueva, San Antón, 4 (% 91-890-1516; www.mesonlacueva.com).
Segovia: A tour of Spanish history
Segovia brings to life a cross section of Spain’s history. Still standing are
a 2,000-year-old Roman aqueduct, a Moorish palace, and a Gothic cathe-
dral. With its medieval streets, Romanesque churches, and 15th-century
palaces, Segovia is an enjoyable place to stroll and get a sense of what it
was like to live in a small Castilian city.
Chapter 22: Madrid and the Best of Castile 507

You can easily see Segovia in three to four hours, but if you’re in need of
a break from the capital, it makes a nice place to hang around for an
overnight escape.
Getting there
Trains (% 902-24-02-02; www.renfe.es) leave Madrid for Segovia every
other hour (they depart Madrid from Atocha Station but also pause at
Chamartín en route). The regular regional train takes two hours. From
Segovia’s train station, bus no. 3 runs to Plaza Mayor in the center of
town. The new high-speed AVE train makes the trip in just 30 minutes,
arriving in a new station, Segovia-Guiomar.
The tourist office (% 921-46-03-34) is at Plaza Mayor, 10.
Seeing the sights
The majestic Roman aqueduct runs 818m (2,685 ft.) along the Plaza del
Azoguejo on the east side of town. The aqueduct, much of it two tiers
high, contains 118 arches and is 29m (96 ft.) at its highest point. Built in
the first century A.D. using stone blocks with no mortar, the aqueduct was
one of the city’s major water sources all the way until the 19th century.
The Catedral de Segovia (% 921-46-22-05), Marqués del Arco, s/n, dom-
inates the city’s old quarter. Isabella I (of Ferdinand and Isabella fame)
was named queen on this very spot in 1474. Built from 1515 to 1558,
Spain’s last great Gothic cathedral is all buttresses and pinnacles. Inside,
it overflows with riches, including beautiful stained-glass windows,
which light the carved choir stalls, the 16th- and 17th-century paintings,
and the grille-fronted chapels inside. The attached cloisters were origi-
nally part of an earlier church at the same location. The 17th-century
Capilla de la Concepción is spectacular. The small museum holds paint-
ings by Ribera, Flemish tapestries, jewelry, and manuscripts. Admission
is 3 ($4.80) adults, free for children 13 and under. April through
October hours are daily from 9:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (until 5:30 p.m. the
rest of the year).
Segovia’s commanding Alcázar (% 921-46-07-59; www.alcazarde
segovia.com), a fairy tale of a fortress, anchors the west end of town.
Originally raised between the 12th and 15th centuries, it was largely rebuilt
after a disastrous 1862 fire destroyed many of its Moorish embellishments.
Behind the formidable exterior are some sumptuous rooms, from the
Gothic King’s Room to the stuccoed Throne Room. Clamber up the Torre
de Juan II, built as a dungeon, for panoramic views. Admission is 4 ($6.40)
adults, 3 ($4.80) children 8 to 14; tower access is an additional 2 ($3.20).
Hours are daily from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (until 6 p.m. Oct–Mar).
Where to stay and dine
The tavernlike Mesón de Cándido, Plaza de Azoguejo, 5, right next to
the Aqueduct (% 921-42-59-11), serves hearty Castilian specialties and
is pretty much an obligatory stop in Segovia. You can get an inexpensive
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
508

double room for 64 to 75 ($102–$120) in the Hostal Residencia Las
Sirenas, Juan Bravo, 30 (% 921-46-26-63; Fax: 92-146-2657; www.hotel
sirenas.com), though a considerable step up is the classic Hotel
Infanta Isabel, Calle Isabel la Católica, 1 (Plaza Mayor; % 921-46-13-00;
Fax: 921-46-22-17; www.hotelinfantaisabel.com), right across from
the cathedral. Doubles run 84 to 214 ($134–$342), and many have
views of the Plaza Mayor. The modern Parador de Segovia, Carretera de
Valladolid, s/n (% 921-44-37-37; Fax: 921-43-73-62; www.parador.es), is
a couple of kilometers north of town, but it has a large outdoor swim-
ming pool and splendid distant views of Segovia. Doubles run 148 to
224 ($237–$358).

(% 91-523-15-50; Metro: Sol); and
easyEverything, Calle Montera, 10–12 
(% 91-523-55-63; www.easyevery
thing.com), open 24/7, with more than
200 computers. Prices range from 1 to 3
($1.60–$4.80) per hour.
Maps
A free street map, covering the whole of
Madrid, is available at tourist information
offices at the airport, train stations, and in
the city. The map is sufficient for virtually all
city travel. You should also pick up the
pocket-size map of the Metro subway
system, available free at any Metro station.
Newspapers and Magazines
Most European newspapers are sold on the
day of publication, as are the Paris-based
International Herald Tribune and European
edition of the Wall Street Journal. USA
Today is also widely available, as are princi-
pal European and American magazines. You
can find them at the many kiosks along

other pharmacies. You can call % 098 to
contact all-night pharmacies.

Post Office
The Central Post Office is located at Palacio
de Comunicaciones, Plaza de la Cibeles, s/n
(% 91-396-24-43). It’s open Monday through
Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sundays and holi-
days from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The yellow sign
CORREOS identifies branches of the post
office. Stamps are also sold at estancos
(tobacco sellers). An airmail letter or post-
card to the United States is 0.75 ($1.20).
Safety
Madrid has a reputation of having one of
the highest crime rates in Spain, though
street crime is normally limited to pickpock-
eting and breaking into cars with items left
in the seats. Exercise extra care along Gran
Vía, Puerta del Sol, Calle Montera (known
as a heavy red-light district), the Rastro flea
market, and areas with lots of bars (and
rowdy drunks), such as Huertas and Latina.
The presence of so many people out at all
hours of the night is generally cause for
reassurance rather than fear. Also, be
especially careful of tourist scams near 
the art museums on Paseo del Prado.

The government sales tax, known as IVA
(value-added tax), is levied nationwide on
all goods and services, and ranges from 
7 percent to 33 percent.

you must dial it before all numbers.
International call centers are located at the
main post office, Plaza de la Cibeles, s/n;

The Best of Barcelona
In This Chapter

 Seeing Barcelona’s top sights
B
arcelona has been around since the Romans dubbed it Barcino and
built a sturdy wall around it 2,000 years ago, but it was the 1992
Summer Olympic Games that really thrust this self-assured and cosmo-
politan city onto the world stage. In a flash, Barcelona became one of
Europe’s hottest destinations. And it hasn’t cooled off one bit.
Barcelona is as intoxicating a city as they come. Las Ramblas boulevard
is a pulsating parade of locals, tourists, and cheery hucksters, dressed
up in face paint and costumes like historical statues. The Gothic
Quarter’s narrow, dark alleys resonate with romance and history, as well
as chic restaurants and shops. The Eixample district is a sparkling grid
of Barcelona’s signature modernista apartment buildings. With its palm
trees, sparkling urban beaches, and outdoor cafes, Barcelona has the
languid air of a sultry Mediterranean capital, while its commitment to
eye-popping style and design give it the air of a progressive northern
European city.
Barcelona has a long tradition of embracing visionary artists such as
Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, and Salvador Dalí, but the city’s favorite
eccentric son is Antoni Gaudí, whose wildly imaginative architecture is
an appropriate symbol for this ancient yet cutting-edge city.
Barcelona is the capital of the fiercely independent-minded region of
prosperous Catalonia, which recently was granted more autonomy than
ever before by the central Spanish government. The people of Spain’s
second-largest city are ambitious, pragmatic, and serious about their
Catalan identity, with its unique language and strong ties to the country-
side. Citizens of Barcelona are fluent in both Catalan and Spanish, and
although you’ll likely hear more of the former, you shouldn’t hesitate to
use any Spanish that you know.

Getting There
Getting into the city from the airport is fairly simple, and the train sta-
tion is connected to a subway line. When you’re in town, getting around
by public transportation is also easy.
Arriving by air
Barcelona’s El Prat airport (% 93-478-50-00; www.aena.es) is 12km 
(7 miles) southeast of the city. In the arrivals hall are several ATMs and an
information desk. For flight information, call % 93-298-38-38. Most flights
from North America still fly direct to the capital, Madrid, before continuing
on to Barcelona, but American Airlines (% 800-443-7300; www.aa.com)
recently introduced direct flights from New York to Barcelona.
Trains (www.renfe.es) run every 30 minutes from the airport to Estació
Sants, Plaça Catalunya, and Arc de Triomf; they cost 1.25 ($2). Even
more convenient is the Aerobús (www.grupsarbusb.com), which departs
every 6 to 15 minutes to Plaça de Catalunya, Passeig de Gràcia, or Plaça
Espanya. The trip takes 30 minutes and costs 3.90 ($6.25); there is a 
20 percent discount with the Barcelona Card (see “Exploring Barcelona,”
later in this chapter). Tickets are sold on the bus. A taxi into town is about
17 to 20 ($27–$32), plus tip and supplements for luggage.
Arriving by train
Most trains bound for Barcelona arrive either at the Estació Sants on the
western edge of the Eixample, or at the Estació de França, near the
harbor at the base of the Ciutadella park. Both stations link to the Metro
network. A recently inaugurated (Dec 2007) high-speed AVE train travels
to Barcelona from Madrid in three hours (and will cut the trip to two-
and-a-half hours as soon as the latest version of the European Train
Control System [ETCS] is in place).
Orienting Yourself in Barcelona
A split personality of the city is evident in the contrast between the old
city and the new city. The Ciutat Vella (Old City) is a hexagon of narrow
streets nudged up against the harbor. The massive grid of streets that
makes up the new city, known as the Eixample (occasionally called El
Ensanche in Spanish), surrounds the old one.
The famed street Las Ramblas (Les Rambles in Catalan, but also referred
to in the singular, La Rambla) bisects the Ciutat Vella and runs from the
harbor north to Plaça de Catalunya. Las Ramblas is a wide, tree-shaded
boulevard with street entertainers, flower stalls, cafes, and the bustle of
the city. (The street runs northwest, but all city maps are oriented with
this street pointing straight up and down.) The street degenerated
Chapter 23: The Best of Barcelona 513

during the fascist Franco era early in the 20th century, as did much of
old Barcelona, but it has mostly regained its footing and respectability
as new businesses revive the Ciutat Vella.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Barri Gòtic, the medieval heart of town around the cathedral, lies to the
east of Las Ramblas. Site of the original Roman city, this is, along with the
Ramblas, the most appetizing area for wandering. Lots of shops, muse-
ums, and restaurants fill its narrow streets with old buildings. The Barri
Gòtic’s eastern edge is Via Laietana, and from this wide street over to the
Carrer Montcada is La Ribera and its vibrant adjunct El Born, site of
innumerable bars, restaurants, and chic shops. South of these two dis-
tricts is the scenic, lake-spotted Parc de la Ciutadella. On a triangular
peninsula jutting into the harbor just south of that, the former fishing vil-
lage of Barceloneta teems with activity, seafood restaurants, and tapas
bars. To the east are the Vila Olímpica, an upscale neighborhood created
to house the Olympic athletes in 1992, and the most fashionable beaches.
The Barri Xinés (officially know as the Raval), a historically seedy
neighborhood of prostitutes, beggars, and thieves, is to the west of Las
Ramblas. Though much improved and an area of large gentrification
projects, led by the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA),
it remains a ramshackle neighborhood characterized by populations of
newly arrived immigrants. Only the more adventurous visitors will want
to venture there after dark. Well beyond this, to the city’s west, rises the
hill of Montjuïc, site of the World’s Fair and Olympic parks.
Dividing the old city from the new, the Plaça de Catalunya, at Las
Ramblas’s north end, is the center of Barcelona. The grid of streets
spreading north from this plaza is known as the Eixample, and its chic
shopping boulevard Passeig de Gràcia, home to several of modernisme’s
greatest hits. The main thoroughfare is logically, if prosaically, named
Avinguda Diagonal, as it crosses the grid diagonally. Beyond this, the
largely working-class neighborhood of Gràcia expands to the north,
where Castilian Spanish is heard much less than Catalan.
Finding information after you arrive
The most central and helpful of the several information offices is the
subterranean Turisme de Barcelona, Plaça de Catalunya, 17 under-
ground (% 93-285-38-34; www.barcelonaturisme.com; Metro:
Catalunya), open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. The multilingual attendants
can provide street maps, answer questions, change money, and make
hotel reservations. Other city information bureaus are located on Plaça
Sant Jaume, at the airport, and the Sants train station.
Informació Turística de Catalunya, which provides information on
Barcelona and the entire autonomous region, is located in Palau Robert,
Passeig de Gràcia, 107 (% 93-238-40-00). It’s open Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Getting Around Barcelona
For transit info, call % 010 or check online at www.tmb.net for city
public transport.
By public transportation
Barcelona’s Metro (subway; % 010 or 93-298-70-00; www.tmb.net)
covers the city pretty well. Line 3 runs down Las Ramblas (and to the
Sants-Estació train station), and Line 4 follows Via Laietana, bordering
the eastern edge of the Ciutat Vella. Plaça de Catalunya is one of the
main Metro junctions, with nearby Passeig de Gràcia as another main
transfer station. You can hoof it from most Metro stations to wherever
you’re headed, but occasionally you may find that taking a bus is easier.
Tickets for both the Metro and bus cost 1.30 ($2.10). A one-day Metro
and bus pass costs 5.50 ($8.80), and a T-10 ticket, good for ten rides on
either, is 7.20 ($12). You can also get free rides on all public transport
with purchase of the Barcelona Card (see “Exploring Barcelona,” later in
this chapter).
By taxi
Black-and-yellow taxis are affordable and everywhere. Few journeys cost
more than 7 ($11). In addition to the numerous taxi stands located
throughout the city, cabs cruise the streets looking for fares. Available
cars advertise with LIBRE or LLIURE signs or with an illuminated green sign.
Reliable taxi companies include FonoTaxi (% 93-330-11-00), Barna Taxi
(% 93-357-77-55), and Radio Taxi (% 93-303-30-33); the latter accepts
credit cards.
By funicular and cable car
Funiculars (trams) and cable cars run up some of the hills around the
city, including Montjuïc and Tibidabo. The Funicular de Montjuïc, which
departs from the Paral.lel Metro station, is included in the T-10 multi-
journey ticket. The Montjuïc cable car, which runs from the waterfront
to the top of Montjuïc, costs 5.50 ($8.80) adults one-way, 7.50 ($12)
adults round-trip, and 4.25 ($6.80) children 4 to 12 one-way, 5.75
($9.20) children 4 to 12 round-trip.
By foot
Unlike Madrid, Barcelona is a joy to wander — especially the medieval
alleys of the Barri Gòtic, along the wide pedestrian sidewalk that runs
down the middle of Las Ramblas, and the elegant boulevard Passeig de
Gràcia. To get back and forth between the Ciutat Vella or the waterfront
and the newer part of town, the Eixample, you’ll want to take public
transportation or a taxi.
Chapter 23: The Best of Barcelona 515

Staying in Barcelona
Barcelona’s hotels have risen with the city’s popularity and are now
comparably priced to other large European cities. Barcelona went nuts
building and refurbishing hotels in time for the 1992 Olympics, and,
more than a decade later, new hotels are still sprouting up all over the
city to meet the city’s ever-growing demand. Many cheaper places are
mostly located in areas that are not the most desirable.
Barcelona no longer really has high and low travel seasons; hotel rates
remain relatively constant throughout the year, though some hotels offer
slightly lower prices when Barcelonans escape the city in droves (Easter,
the month of Aug, and Christmas).
Turisme de Barcelona operates a hotel-booking service online and at its
office in Plaça de Catalunya (% 93-285-38-32; www.barcelonaturisme.
com/hotelsbcn). The service concentrates on last-minute (same-day)
bookings.

Ciutat Vella (Barri Gòtic)
At the edge of the Gothic Quarter and just across the street from the water-
front, this handsome, sedate boutique hotel is a great all-around place to
stay. The location is perfect for walks along the Moll de la Fusta prome-
nade and is walking distance from restaurants in the port and La Rambla.
Housed in a meticulously restored 19th-century palace, it’s elegant and
intimate but also welcoming and relaxed. It boasts a bonus feature that
few Barcelona hotels can lay claim to: a large rooftop solarium terrace with
an attractive little pool and commanding views of the waterfront and port.
It also has a very nice full restaurant, another surprise for a small hotel.
Accommodations are luxurious and warm, chic but not coldly “drunk on
design,” as many aspiring design hotels tend to be in Barcelona. Rooms
with sea views are more expensive, while interior rooms are quieter. Check
online for packages and special deals.

An aparthotel with the comforts of a top-flight hotel, the Suiza is perfect
for families and long-term stays. The location, out near the Sagrada
Família, is not as convenient as others in the Eixample, but the amenities
and comfort more than make up for it, especially for families or anyone
needing a little space to stretch out. Apartments in the historic house are
two-bedroom, two-bath, with living rooms and full kitchens; continental

breakfast is included in the price. Incredibly, for a place of this size, the
sophisticated in-house La Cúpula restaurant is overseen by the famed
Catalan chef, Carles Gaig. But best of all, some of the hotel’s profits go
toward a cancer foundation established by the original owner of the house.

Ciutat Vella (La Ribera)
An exciting option in a lively location, near the Born and Santa María del
Mar — and not so far from the waterfront — is this inexpensive but hugely
hip little hotel. Managed by the same people who run the excellent Senyor
Parellada restaurant next door (see “Dining in Barcelona,” later in this
chapter), this place is perfect for people with tons of style but not a huge
budget. Rooms are small but very cool, with a chic monochromatic design.
The suites, located in two nearby buildings, are more independent but
more spacious, and also an equally good deal at 130 ($208). Though the
hotel is very convenient for sightseeing and dining, it’s probably best for
young people and not ideal for anyone who’s averse to crowds and a bit
of noise; particularly on weekend nights, this area is overrun with revelers
spilling out of bars and restaurants.

Eixample
If you’re looking for a dose of Barcelona’s legendary style but at an afford-
able price, this boutique hotel may be the answer. It has just 20 rooms;
although they’re not huge, they’re fashionably sleek and very comfortable,
with leather trim, plush pillows, and sparkling bathrooms. The hotel’s very
nicely located (a short walking distance from Plaça de Catalunya) for the
bargain rates. In essence, it’s like the excellent Prestige Paseo de Gracia
(see the upcoming listing), but on a much tighter budget.

Eixample
Sleek and trendy, but rather affordable for a boutique hotel of its consid-
erable comfort, design, and amenities, this relative newcomer to the
Barcelona hotel scene has quickly become very popular. It occupies a
beautifully renovated, historic building with great flair. The design focus
was on creating a hotel that feels more like an urbane apartment building
than an anonymous hotel. Rooms feature warmly modern lighting, woods

An exquisite new small hotel (45 rooms) smack on Barcelona’s swankest
boulevard, Paseo de Gracia, this chic place exudes cool. The minimalist
rooms have a Zen-like tranquility, and some have their own quiet and beau-
tiful garden bamboo terraces. The hotel plays the by-now-expected
Barcelona design card but does it better than almost any other hotel. It
has soothing bathrooms and a well-thought-out, detail-oriented design
scheme — everything from flowers to intelligent lighting. Extras include
an extremely helpful “Ask Me” information attendant, a hip Zeroom lounge
for listening to music and reading, free wireless Internet in the entire hotel,
and Bang & Olufsen TVs. For this level of style and comfort, the hotel is a
good value, especially given its pricey location.

Dining in Barcelona
Catalans love to eat and love to eat out, and they enjoy one of the best
and most imaginative cuisines in Spain. Barcelona’s stature as a dining
capital has really exploded in the past few years, as a number of highly
creative young chefs have made the city second only to San Sebastián
for fine dining. Expect market-fresh ingredients and Mediterranean
dishes with a flourish. In addition to haute cuisine, you’ll also find the
traditional rustic dishes that have nourished Catalans for centuries.
Most restaurants are in the Ciutat Vella and Eixample, though the most
popular new dining area is along the Waterfront and in the new port.
Although Barcelona natives aren’t quite as addicted to tapas as their
brethren in the Basque country and Madrid, you should spend at least
one evening doing a tapeo, or tapas-bar crawl (see “More cool things to
see and do,” later in this chapter). The best picnic pickings by far are at
the excellent La Boquería market on Las Ramblas — it’s loaded with pro-
duce, meats, fish, and cheeses.
A handful of restaurants feature menus printed only in Catalan, but
increasingly, English-language menus are widely available.

A bright and informally hip place overlooking the beach, Agua is appro-

vegetarian preparations. It has a great outdoor terrace with ocean views

It would be easy to overlook this dark, ancient-looking little restaurant,

pack it for lunch, when it offers a superb fixed-price menu. In warm
weather, tables are set out on the terrace, a perfect place to drink in this
quintessential Barri Gòtic corner.

Cal Pep
$$$–$$$$
Barri Gòtic/Waterfront
SEAFOOD
This tiny, bustling, and even magical seafood restaurant is a classic
Barcelona dining experience. It serves the freshest specials of the day any-
where. The restaurant has no menu, and virtually no tables (just four in
back); everyone sits at the long bar and waits for Pep, the gravelly voiced
owner, to recommend whatever’s fresh off the boats and out of the mar-
kets. Wait patiently for a table and let Pep guide you (something he’s emi-
nently capable of, even if shared language amounts to hand signals).
Though you may be in for a long wait — the place just gets more and more
popular — you won’t be sorry, and prices are pretty reasonable given the
phenomenal quality.

Housed on the first floor of one of Antoni Gaudí’s earliest but still emblem-

rant’s sumptuous white-brick and stained-glass modernista décor alone is
enough to recommend a visit. The welcome surprise is that it’s an excellent
and fairly priced restaurant serving creative Catalan cuisine. Give the Galician
oyster raviolis in champagne a whirl. Dining at Casa Calvet is a great, non-
touristy way to get up close and personal with a modernista classic.

CREATIVE CATALAN/TAPAS
The Born district has exploded with trendy restaurants and bars, but this
spot, which puts creativity and elegance into that Spanish staple, tapas,
continues to be one of the city’s coolest places to dine. The kitchen is the
work of Carles Abellán, who has quickly become one of Barcelona’s hottest
young chefs. Here he’s essentially created tapas de autor, and there’s a
great bit of theater in his preparations. The bold colors and chic stylings
of the restaurant, which feels like an industrial-flavored club (it’s in an old
salting house), lend the perfect backdrop. The theater begins with a series
of “snacks” served in sardine tins. Everything here is worthy of recom-
mendation. Some dishes are playful; others, more traditional.

Inside the recently renovated, wildly colorful and cool Mercat Santa Caterina

market, is this informal place that feels very much a part of its surround-
ings. With soaring beamed ceilings, ficus trees, and long bars and commu-
nal tables, it has just the right amount of commotion. It’s perfect for an
easygoing lunch, late-night snacks, or even breakfast, and there’s something
to please everyone. The menu careens all over the place, but in a good and
fun way, featuring everything from tapas, Thai curries and sushi to great
salads, fresh pastas, vegetarian and Mediterranean dishes, and, of course,
fresh seafood — all at very fair prices. The breakfast and tapas bar is open
daily from 9 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. (until 12:30 a.m. Thurs–Sat), and you even get

This Barcelona institution and national monument, which has seven doors
facing the street (hence the name), has been hosting large dining parties
since 1836. (It was the first place in Barcelona with running water.)
Barcelonans drop in to celebrate special occasions. Set Portes, as it is also

in its own ink. All the paellas are tremendous. Portions are huge and very
reasonably priced. The dining rooms — some semiprivate — are classically
elegant, with beamed ceilings, checkerboard marble floors, antique mirrors
and posters, and plenty of room between tables. The place is hugely popu-

rambunctious at dinnertime) and young people on dates.

décor, as do the extremely fair prices for such fresh preparations — all rea-
sons the restaurant continues to be so popular among both locals and vis-
itors to Barcelona. The authentic Catalan fare features excellent salads and
fish, and a few adventurous choices, such as pig’s trotters in garlic sauce.

Exploring Barcelona
Barcelona has a greater diversity of things to see and do than any other
city in Spain (something folks from Madrid may be loath to admit). When
visiting, concentrate your time on distinct neighborhoods, which is how
we lay out the attractions in this section. The works of Gaudí and his
imaginative modernista cohorts and the lively Ramblas boulevard are
perhaps the city’s most obvious highlights, but the rich medieval Gothic
Quarter, with its Picasso Museum and enticing little corners, and the
newly dynamic waterfront are also huge draws. Apart from those sites,
Barcelona ranks among Europe’s great strolling cities, with secluded
plazas, open-air cafes, tree-lined boulevards, and an inexhaustible
supply of nooks where you can stop and have coffee, a beer, or tapas
during your meanderings.

The top attractions
La Pedrera (Casa Milà)
Eixample
Gaudí’s unfinished church, La Sagrada Família, leaves jaws agape, but the
architect’s most fascinating and inspired civic work — and perhaps the
crowning glory of modernisme — is Casa Milà, named after the patrons
who allowed him to carry through with such an avant-garde apartment
building back in 1910. The masterpiece is known to almost all as La
Pedrera, which means “stone quarry” — a reference to its immense lime-
stone facade.
The massive exterior undulates like ocean waves on Passeig de Gràcia and
around the corner onto Provença; on the roof are a set of chimneys that look
like the inspiration for Darth Vader. On the first floor (near the entrance on
Provença) is a great exhibition space for temporary art shows. The building
received a head-to-toe face-lift in the mid-1990s. The apartments inside had
suffered unspeakable horrors, and Gaudí’s beautiful arched attics had been
sealed up, but the painstaking restoration has revealed its author’s genius
in new ways. The attic floor is now a high-tech Gaudí museum (Espai Gaudí),
with cool interactive exhibits, terrific slide shows, and access to the roof,
where you can hang out with the warrior chimneys (which, according to
some, represent Christians and Moors battling for Spanish turf). Both the
kid-friendly, fast-paced museum and the rooftop will be unqualified hits with
children.
One of the original Gaudí apartments — all with odd shapes, handcrafted
doorknobs, and idiosyncratic details — has now been opened to the
public. The apartment, called El Pis in Catalan, is meticulously outfitted
with period furniture, including many pieces of Gaudí’s design. For the

La Sagrada Família
Eixample
Barcelona’s landmark is Antoni Gaudí’s unfinished legacy and testament
to his singular vision, the art of the impossible. Hordes of people come to
gawk at this mind-altering creation, and it’s not anywhere near comple-
tion. Begun in 1884 after Gaudí took over from another architect — who
was making an ordinary Gothic cathedral — the father of modernisme
transformed the project with his fertile imagination. Even though Gaudí
abandoned all other works to devote his life to this cathedral, which would
be the world’s largest if completed, he knew he could never finish it in his
lifetime. Although he surely intended for future generations to add their
signatures (he left only general plans), he probably didn’t plan on resign-
ing from the project when he did: Gaudí was run over by a tram in 1926.
The eight bejeweled spires (plans called for 12, one for each of Jesus’s dis-
ciples) drip like melting candlesticks. Virtually every square inch of the
surface explodes with intricate spiritual symbols. Love it or hate it, you
can’t deny that the church is the work of a unique visionary. A private foun-
dation works furiously to finish the church, and though a debate once raged
whether it should be completed or left unfinished as a monument to Gaudí,
construction has progressed over the last two decades at a rate few could
have predicted. By 2010 the cathedral will receive a full roof for the first
time, allowing cultural events and religious observations to be held inside.
Completion is now projected for 2025, when the central tower, the 550-foot
Tower of Jesus, will be finished. Not everyone is pleased, of course — in
particular, the Barcelona sculptor Josep María Subirachs’s additions on the
west side depicting the life of Christ have been derided as disastrous kitsch —
but even the staunchest detractors have little choice now but to live with
the notion of a Sagrada Família considerably changed.
The best stuff at La Sagrada Família is what you see on the outside. If you
skip going in and save your 10 ($6), you miss an elevator to the top for

Strolling La Rambla
Victor Hugo extolled Barcelona’s La Rambla as “the most beautiful street
in the world,” and the Spanish poet García Lorca said it was the “only
street he wished would never end.” La Rambla (also referred to as Las
Ramblas) is much more than an attractive street; it’s an interminable
street parade. Many locals practice the fine art of the paseo (stroll)
every day of their lives along this mile-long pedestrian avenue.
Subdivided into five separate ramblas, each of different character and
attractions, are a succession of newspaper kiosks, fresh flower stands,
bird sellers, and mimes (or human statues) in elaborately conceived
costumes and face paint hoping for a few stray euros. La Rambla 
may turn out to be the highlight of your trip to Barcelona (to ensure

Gaudí or gaudy?
Around the turn of the 20th century, Art Nouveau arrived in Barcelona in the form of
modernisme, a particularly fluid and idiosyncratic Catalan version of a larger archi-
tectural revolution. The high priest of modernisme, Antoni Gaudí, apprenticed as a
blacksmith before taking up architecture. Creative wrought-iron patterns became just
one of the many signature details that Gaudí incorporated into his flowing, organic
structures; he was especially fond of creating colorful mosaics out of pieces of
ceramic and mirror.
If you see only a handful of modernisme buildings, make them Gaudí’s most famous
trio: the Sagrada Família (see listing earlier in this chapter); Casa Milà (see listing
earlier in this chapter), usually called La Pedrera (“the quarry”) for its undulating
rocky shape; and the colorful Casa Battló, Passeig de Gràcia 43 (% 93-416-03-06;
www.casabatllo.es; Admission: 17/$27, including audio guide; Open: Daily 
9 a.m.–8 p.m.), with a roof shaped like a dragon’s back and theater-mask balconies.
Two other modernisme architects of note were Domènech i Montaner and Puig i
Cadafalch. To compare them, and to get a handle on Gaudí, walk down the Manzana
de la Discòrdia (“the block of discord”) on Passeig de Gràcia between Carrer del
Consell de Cent and Carrer d’Arago. Here, their interpretations of modernisme com-
pete in the form of apartment buildings. At no. 35 is Montaner’s Casa Lleo Morera, at
no. 41 is Cadafalch’s Casa Amatller, and at no. 43 is Gaudí’s Casa Battló. (For these
and Casa Milà, take the Metro to Passeig de Gràcia or Diagonal, which is closer to
Casa Milà.)
Montaner also designed the gorgeous venue Palau de la Música Catalana, Carrer de
Sant Francesc de Paula, 2 (% 93-295-72-00; www.palaumusica.org), now a
UNESCO World Heritage Site. It’s surely the trippiest music hall you’ll ever see, with a
sky-lit stained glass of the inverse dome in the auditorium; 50-minute guided tours
depart Wednesdays and weekends every half-hour from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. for 9
($14). One of Cadafalch’s other major works is Els Quatre Gats, a restaurant where
Picasso and other artists used to hang out (Montsió, 3, in the Barri Gòtic).

that it is, keep a keen eye on your bag and camera). You can walk the
length of La Rambla in 30 minutes, but allow a couple hours if you
want to make pit stops for refreshments, shopping, and exploring
along the way.
About midway down is one of the highlights of La Rambla, the famous 
La Boquería food market. If you aren’t already suffering from sensory
overload, take a detour in here to see and smell an amazingly lively
scene: the selling, slicing, and dicing of fresh fish, meats, produce, and
just about everything your tummy wants.
At the bottom, facing the waterfront, is the Monument à Colom
(Columbus Monument). Visitors can take the elevator up to Columbus’s
head for good views of the waterfront.
Exploring the Gothic Quarter
Barcelona’s Barri Gòtic (or Barrio Gótico, the Gothic Quarter) — below
Plaça de Catalunya and between La Rambla and Vía Laietana — is the
oldest part of the city. Segments of the original Roman walls that once con-
tained the whole of the city still survive. The district today is an intricate
maze of palaces and treasures from the 11th through 15th centuries. One of
Barcelona’s greatest pleasures is an idle wander among the Quarter’s
narrow streets, along alleys filled with hanging laundry and shouting neigh-
bors, past shops of antiques dealers, and onto stunning little squares.
The cathedral and Picasso Museum (covered later in this section) are
the district’s major sights, but also worth a visit is the noble Plaça del
Rei, the courtyard of the 14th-century palace of the kings of Aragón.
(The Catholic monarchs received Columbus here after his successful
voyage to the Americas.) On your strolls through the Gothic Quarter,
don’t miss the Roman walls at Plaça Nova; Plaça de Sant Jaume, the
heart of the Roman city and today the site of the municipal and regional
governments; Plaça del Pi, the district’s liveliest square, teeming with
outdoor cafes and a weekend art market; peaceful Plaça Sant Felip de
Neri (though walls ravaged by Spanish Civil War shrapnel indicate it
wasn’t always so quiet); and the lovely winding streets Carrer de la
Palla and Carrer Banys Nous, known for their antiques dealers.
Catedral de Barcelona
Barri Gòtic
This Catalonian Gothic cathedral, the focal point of the Old City, is actually
a mix of architectural styles. Though construction began in 1298, most of
the structure dates from the 14th and 15th centuries. The facade was
added in the 19th century. Even with that lengthy birth process, the cathe-
dral is a splendid example of Gothic architecture. Inside, check out the
handsome carved choir and surprisingly lush cloister. With its magnolias,
palm trees, pond, and white geese, the cathedral is a lovely oasis in the
midst of the Medieval Quarter. (In the Middle Ages, geese functioned as
guard dogs, their squawks alerting priests to intruders.) Try to visit at least
once at night, when the cathedral is illuminated and birds soar in the flood-

lights, or head to the rooftop for a view of the surrounding Gothic Quarter.
A half-hour or an hour is sufficient to see the cathedral.

Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya (MNAC)
If you want to get a sense of Catalonia’s unique history, this splendid
medieval art museum — one of the world’s finest, and Barcelona’s preemi-
nent art collection — is a vital stop, presenting more than 1,000 years of art
history. (Sadly, many rushed visitors unjustly overlook it). At the top of the
stairs and fountains leading up to Montjuïc, housed in the domed Palau
Nacional (National Palace), the museum is anything but a stale repository
of religious art. The collection of Romanesque works, salvaged from churches
all over Catalonia, is unequaled. Here you can view superb altarpieces, poly-
chromatic icons, and treasured frescoes displayed in apses, just as they were
in the country churches in which they were found. The museum also holds
paintings by some of Spain’s most celebrated painters, including Velázquez,
Ribera, and Zurbarán. Plan on spending a couple of hours at the MNAC.

Museu Picasso
Ciutat Vella
Pablo Picasso, though born in Málaga in southern Spain, spent much of
his youth and early creative years in Barcelona before making the requisite
artistic pilgrimage to Paris, where he soon became the most famous artist
of the 20th century. Barcelona’s Picasso museum, the second-most-visited
museum in Spain (after the Prado in Madrid), can’t compete with the supe-
rior collection in Paris, but it’s the largest collection of his works in his
native country. Picasso (1881–1973) donated 2,500 paintings and sculp-
tures to the museum, many of them early (and more traditional figurative)
pieces, including several from his blue period. If you’re already a fan,
you’re likely to love the museum, even though few works are considered
among Picasso’s masterpieces; individuals looking for a comprehensive
career-spanning collection may be disappointed. The artist’s loopy series
based on Velázquez’s renowned painting Las Meninas is unusual but it’s
also evidence of Picasso’s playful genius. The Picasso Museum currently
occupies several exquisite 15th-century palaces on a pedestrian-only
street lined with medieval mansions. It’s one of the city’s loveliest streets,
and the museum’s administrators are continuing their expansionist craze,
with plans to take over yet more buildings along Carrer Montcada in the
next several years. Plan on spending at least a couple of hours here.

More cool things to see and do
 Traipsing along on a tapeo: When in Spain, do as the Spanish do:
Indulge in an early evening tapeo (tapas-bar crawl). (For more details
on this most Spanish of activities — tapas rank somewhere between
a snack and a passion — see “Dining in Madrid” in Chapter 22.)
Barcelona may not have the reputation for tapas-grazing that Madrid
has, but it’s a wonderful city in which to eat on the run — or tide
yourself over until those late mealtimes at most restaurants. Among
the best spots are Irati, Cardenal Casanyes, 17 (Barri Gòtic; % 93-
302-30-84), a bustling Basque tapas tavern just off La Rambla that’s
always at standing-room-only capacity; Tapaç 24, Diputació, 269
(Eixample; % 93-488-09-77), an offshoot of the wonderfully creative
upscale restaurant Comerç 24; La Bodegueta, Rambla de Catalunya,
100 (Eixample; % 93-215-48-94), an easy-to-miss, simple step-down
bar that’s ideal for a small snack and a glass of wine or cava; and
Inopia, Tamarit, 104 (% 93-424-52-31), a classic tapas bar with a
boisterous vibe, owned by the brother of the legendary experimental
chef Ferran Adrià. A Catalan specialty is the champagne bar, called a
xampanyería. These bars serve cava (sparkling wine) as well as a
selection of tapas. Not to be missed is the bustling, nearly always
SRO El Xampanyet, Montcada, 22 (% 93-319-70-03; Metro: Jaume I).
 Wading in at the waterfront: Check out Vila Olímpica, an award-
winning neighborhood and medley of conceptual architecture,
where swimmers, baseball players, weightlifters, and other
Olympic athletes were the first to inhabit the apartments, later sold
and rented to the public. Port Olímpic (the new harbor) swims
with bars and restaurants and Port Vell (the old port) is a hyper-
developed entertainment and shopping area, with attractions like
the IMAX Port Vell cinema, Maremágnum mall, and L’Aquarium. The
pedestrian boulevard along the old harbor, called the Moll de la
Fusta, makes for a very enjoyable paseo (stroll); it stretches from
the Columbus statue at the bottom of La Rambla to a giant
Liechtenstein sculpture (Metro: Drassanes, Barceloneta, or
Ciutadella–Vila Olímpica).
 Putting the pieces together at Parc Güell: The whimsical open-air
Parc Güell, Ctra. del Carmel, 23 (% 93-213-04-88; Metro: Lesseps),
another of Gaudí’s signature creations, is north of the Eixample dis-
trict, but still relatively easy to reach (you can take the bus, but vis-
iting by taxi is easiest and quickest). Envisioned as a housing
development, the garden city was never fully realized. Gaudí origi-
nally planned to design every detail of the 60 houses; however, only
one was finished, and Gaudí lived in it as he struggled to complete
the project (it now houses the small Casa-Museu Gaudí). The parts
that Gaudí did finish — in fact, his talented disciple, Josep María
Jujol, executed most of what you see — resemble an idiosyncratic
theme park, with a mosaic-covered lizard fountain, Hansel and
Gretel pagodas, and magically undulating park benches swathed in
broken pieces of ceramics, called trencadis. Gaudí was so intent on
the community’s total integration into nature that he inserted part
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
530

of it into a hill, constructing a forest of columns that look remark-
ably like tree trunks. On clear days, you can see much of Barcelona,
making out the spires of Gaudí’s La Sagrada Família and the twin
towers on the beach. Allow at least an hour to take in the full flavor
of the park. It’s probably best to grab a cab, because it’s a 6-block
walk uphill from the nearest subway stop. Admission to the park
itself is free, though the Casa-Museu Gaudí charges 4 ($6.40). The
Casa-Museu Gaudí is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; the park is
open daily March through April and September through October
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., May through August from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
November through February from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Partying ’til dawn with Barcelona’s pulsing nightlife: Like most of
Spain, Barcelona loves late-night action, be it bar-hopping, dancing,
or just general partying until the wee hours. The most traditional
evening — if you can call it that, given the surroundings — can be
had in the modernisme architectural triumph of the Palau de la
Música Catalana, San Francesc de Paula, 2 (% 93-295-72-00; www.
palaumusica.org), which features year-round classical, jazz, and
pop concerts as well as recitals. Or check out a flamenco bar such
as Tablao Flamenco Cordobés, Las Ramblas, 35 (% 93-317-57-11),
or El Tablao de Carmen in the Poble Espanyol (% 93-325-68-95),
or a jazz club, such as Jamboree (% 93-301-75-64), a soul-oriented
basement venue at Plaça Reial, 17. The historic Sala Apolo, Nou de
la Rambla, 113 (% 93-441-40-01), perpetually “in” City Hall,
Rambla Catalunya, 2–4 (% 93-317-2177); sleek-chic Baja Beach Club,
Passeig Marítim, 34 (% 93-225-91-0); and the fashionable Latin-
flavored dance-club Mojito Club, Roselló, 217 (% 93-352-87-46) are
all good night spots. Or hang out at the outdoor cafes and bars that
keep the neighbors awake in the El Born district. The El Born,
Passeig del Born, 26 (% 93-310-37-27), is just one of many happen-
ing spots in this ultracool neighborhood.

Suggested itineraries
If you’re the type who’d rather organize your own tours, this section
offers some tips for building your own Barcelona itineraries. Two full
days will give you a good taste of what the city has to offer.
If you have one day
Begin early in the morning at the only grand cathedral of Europe still in
the midst of being built, Gaudí’s Sagrada Família. Take an hour or so to
clamber around its spires and admire the whimsical sculpture adorning
its odd hidden corners. Then take the Metro to Avinguda Diagonal for
more modernisme masterpieces in Gaudí’s Casa Milà and the famed
Manzana de la Discòrdia along Passeig de Gràcia.
Hop back on the Metro at the Passeig de Gràcia stop to transfer to the
Jaume I stop so that, after grabbing some lunch at Cuines Santa
Caterina, you can pop into the Museu Picasso, a museum honoring
Barcelona’s other artistic giant of the 20th century. Backtrack along
Carrer de la Princesa, and cross Via Laietana to the square in front of
Barcelona’s massive Gothic Catedral.
As evening draws near, make your way over to the grand promenade of 
La Rambla to watch the street performers and the locals out for their
paseo (evening walk) and to simply stroll one of the greatest pedestrian
boulevards in Europe. Cut out by 6 p.m. or so for the evening tapeo, before
heading back to your hotel to rest up from your full day; get back out there
at 10 p.m. for dinner at Restaurant 7 Portes or Cal Pep in the old quarter.
If you have two days
Begin Day 1 seeing perhaps Barcelona’s greatest sight: La Rambla, the
long, wide, pedestrian boulevard that glides right through the heart of
the old city, from Plaça de Catalunya to the port. Start at the port end, at
the Drassanes Metro stop. Stop into La Boquería market. Pause at the
twittering, tweeting cages of the tiny portable bird market; toss coins to
the performers who pose as statues and only move when a clink of
change hits their plates. Follow Las Ramblas all the way to Carrer de
Portaferrisa and turn right until you get to the Catedral.
After lunch, work your way south through the back streets of the medieval
Barri Gòtic and head over to the Museu Picasso and then stroll the atmos-
pheric neighborhoods of La Ribera and El Born, a great place to stop for
a glass of wine or cava.
Day 2 is the day for modernisme. Start it off by proceeding to Sagrada
Família and the Art Nouveau wonderland of Passeig de Gràcia, where
you’ll find the Manzana de la Discòrdia. Don’t miss a visit to see Antoni
Gaudí’s masterpiece, Casa Milà.
Now, because the last day-and-a-half have been pretty packed (and you’ve
done lots of walking), take the afternoon to relax while still sightseeing.
Either head up (by taxi) to the Gaudí-designed Parc Güell, a wonderful
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
532

place to wander, full of whimsical architectural accents, or take the Metro
down to the waterfront, new port, and revitalized beaches. Have an easy-
going dinner at Agua, which overlooks the beach, or head back to the
Gothic Quarter and perhaps dine at Senyor Parellada.

Safety
The street crime for which Barcelona once
drew unwanted attention has diminished,
due in part to an increased police presence
and new lighting on dark streets in the Old
Town. But with Barcelona’s surging popu-
larity, there are pockets of the city where
thieves prey on tourists. Be careful around
any major tourist sight, but especially: La
Rambla (especially the section closest to
the sea); Barri Gòtic; Raval neighborhood;
and La Sagrada Família. Much of the crime
on La Rambla has moved, with greater
police presence there, to side streets in the
Gothic Quarter and the Raval district, and
you shouldn’t walk alone at night in either
place. Your primary danger is from pick-
pockets and purse snatchers, and all these
areas have earned reputations for frequent
robberies directed at tourists.
Turisme Atenció (Tourist Attention Service),
La Rambla, 43 (% 93-256-24-30; Metro:

who can aid crime victims in reporting
losses and obtaining new documents. The

Greek Islands
In This Chapter

 Locating the best hotels, restaurants, and historical sights
 Side-tripping to the best beaches outside the big city
B
y the fifth century B.C., when the rest of Western civilization was
still in its infancy, Athens was already a thriving metropolis, the
site of the world’s first successful democracy. The city gave birth to
influential schools of art, architecture, literature, drama, and philosophy
that continue to be the touchstones of modern culture.
Four magnificent sights from antiquity are preserved in Athens: the
world’s most famous ancient temple, the Parthenon, perched atop
Acropolis Hill; two outstanding archaeological museums; and the sprawl-
ing Ancient Agorá, the civic laboratory in which contemporary democ-
racy was first developed and tested.
Athens has one of the most important cultural heritages in Europe, but
first impressions are colored by where you stay and go. Athens may be a
study in overdevelopment and chaos (which also has its charms), but
the city also has also pockets of green areas, and long and wide, car-free
streets are located throughout the historic center.
A project completed by the 2004 Olympic Games to unify Athens’s
archaeological sites (Temple of Olympian Zeus, Hadrian’s Arch, the
Acropolis, Filopáppou Monument, the Ancient Agorá, and Ancient
Kerameikós cemetery) on a traffic-free, cobblestone promenade
included upgrading the surrounding areas. Buildings were restored, and
new pockets of activity sprang up along the route. With ever more side-
walk cafes and places to enjoy the atmosphere, the view, visual arts, and
free music performances, the effect has been enchanting, for Athenians
and visitors alike.

Having said that, because Athens is farther from the heart of Europe than
most people realize, first-time visitors to the Continent and those on a
whirlwind trip should consider whether to invest the time it takes to visit
Greece overland. It’s worth the effort, especially if you can fly from another
European city (luckily, new no-frills airlines — see Chapter 6 — now make
this affordable for many travelers). Otherwise, be prepared to spend a full
six days on a train and a ferry just to get from Rome to Athens and back.
Getting There
In addition to the usual options for getting to a major European city —
plane, train, bus, and (for adventuresome travelers) automobile —
Athens offers another mode of entry: ferry. But the marine journey is
long. Flying is still the best alternative.
After you get to Athens, your feet and the Metro are likely to be your
best transportation bets.
Arriving by air
The Athens International Airport Eleftherios Venizelos (% 210-
353-0000; www.aia.gr), 27km (17 miles) east of the city at Spata,
opened in March 2001. As the main southeastern Europe transport hub,
it’s functional but faceless, given its history- and character-rich location.
Check out the on-site museum if you have time to kill.
In the arrivals hall are two airport information desks, three ATMs, a cur-
rency exchange machine (a staffed bureau is at departure level), two
free Internet kiosks, a pharmacy, and a post office. The Greek National
Tourism Organization (GNTO — often abbreviated to the Greek acronym
EOT) has a desk in the arrivals hall, where you can ask about hotels and
transportation into Athens and pick up a map, while the adjacent travel
agencies provide similar info, plus a hotel booking service.
A taxi into central Athens costs about 30 to 50 ($48–$80); not
metered is a 3.40 ($5.45) surcharge for trips to or from the airport,
road tolls, and baggage charges. Drivers may not pick up bags weighing
more than 15kg (33 pounds).
If you decide to take a taxi, ask the driver for an estimate of how much
the journey should cost, and get in or not based on the answer. If the
driver tries to overcharge, do not pay or get out of the car unless you’re
in front of your hotel (despite being in pedestrian areas, all the hotels
listed are accessible by car), and either ask a clerk there for assistance
or ask to be driven to a police station, which should be effective enough.
If you’re taking a taxi to the airport, ask the hotel desk clerk to order it
for you in advance.
The airport is linked to central Athens by both the Metro system (Line 3),
which goes through S;ntagma Square to Egaleo station in western

Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 537
Athens, and the Suburban Rail, which goes to Larissa (railway) Station
and out of the city to Corinth or Kiato, where you change trains if you’re
heading to Patras for a ferry to Italy. Change to Line 1 at Monastiraki sta-
tion for domestic ferries at the port of Piraeus. The suburban rail also
goes to the port, changing at Ano Liosia. Travel time into town is about
45 minutes. One-way tickets on either cost 6 ($9.60); validate (cancel)
the ticket before going to the shared platform.
Buses (% 185; www.oasa.gr) from the airport into the center of town
cost 3.20 ($5.10); purchase tickets at the booth in front of the bus stop;

from the driver only when the bus is en route. Both the X94 and X95 run
to the Ethniki Amyna Metro station on Line 3, but X95 continues on to
S;ntagma Square in the heart of Athens, about a 70-minute trip. Bus X96
stops at the Faliro Metro station (and connects with the tram) before
continuing on to Piraeus Metro station at Athens’s port, southwest of
the city; both those stops are also on Line 1.
Arriving by ferry
Hordes of travelers take the ferry to Greece from Italy. You can leave
from Venice, Bari, Ancona, and Brindisi in Italy, and Igoumenitsa, Corfu,
Cephalonia, Zakynthos, Paxi, and Patras in Greece. Most ferries leave in
the afternoon or evening and take from 10 to 17 hours to Patras on the
mainland. Schedules, ports of departure, and prices change seasonally,
with tickets ranging from 18 ($29) for deck/economy class to 255
($408) for a luxury cabin in August. Eurail pass holders should check
their booklet to determine which operators honor their passes, and then
depart from the relevant port; however, expect to pay port taxes and/or
fuel fees and a season surcharge (20–30/$32–$48). Schedules, rates,
and special offers for small groups are all linked through www.greek
ferries.gr.
To get to Athens from Patras, you can take the bus (% 210-514-7310 in
Athens, 2610-623-887 in Patras) that leaves every 30 to 45 minutes; the
trip takes two-and-a-half hours and costs 16 ($26). You can also take
one of six daily trains that make the trek in three-and-a-half to four hours
and cost 8.80 ($14) or 12 ($19) for the Intercity, with a change at
Kiato to the Suburban Rail (Proastiakos). Or you can catch a bus to
Delphi or to ancient Olympia via Pirgos. Make your connections as
quickly as possible, because the last train and bus of the day usually pull
out soon after the ferry arrives.
Getting from Rome to Athens by ferry takes about three full days. Flying
is likely the easiest and cheapest alternative when you tally all the rail,
ferry, meal, and accommodations costs. Check www.skyscanner.net or
www.flyairone.it/en for e-booking cheap flights from various Italian
cities to Athens, which may not be much more than a deck-class ticket
to Patras; or check at the Rome airport (% 06-65951; www.adr.it) for
some dozen daily flights. You can also find cheap flights in and out of
Athens at www.airtickets.gr.
Arriving by rail
Trains (% 1110; www.ose.gr) arrive at Larissa Station, Athens’s main
train station. A Metro stop (also called Larissa Station) is just out front,
or take Trolley 1 (4:25 a.m.–11:35 p.m.) to S;ntagma Square, Makriyánni,
or Koukáki districts.
Arriving by bus
Regional (KTEL) buses pull into Athens at one of two bus terminals.
Terminal A (for buses from Patras; northern, southern, and western
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
538

Greece; and the Peloponnese) is at 100 Kifissoú St. (% 210-512-4910);
from there, city bus no. 051 runs to Menándrou Street, west of Omónia
Square. Terminal B (for buses from central Greece, including Delphi and
Metéora) is at 260 Liossíon St. (% 210-831-7153; www.ktel.org); from
this terminal, a dozen city buses go to Attiki Metro station, from which
you can catch lines 1 or 2, but the driver usually drops passengers off
near Line 1, before reaching the terminal. Buses to sights in Attica (Cape
Soúnion, Marathon) leave from Aig;ptou Square on Patissíon Street 
(% 210-822-5148), just past the National Archaeological Museum. A
Soúnion-bound bus stop is at central Klafthmónos Square on Stadíou
Street. Buses leave every hour until 5:30 p.m.; the fare is 5.40 ($8.65).
The last bus returns at 7 p.m., so check the time of the renowned sunset
beforehand.
Orienting Yourself in Athens
Athens is a sprawling metropolis with an insatiable appetite for expan-
sion, bordering low mountains and the sea. The center has largely been
redeveloped into one big pedestrian zone, and the main sites are located
here, including the Acropolis. Use a map to navigate narrow streets and
get your bearings. Streets can change names blocks apart, and spellings
rendered in English vary widely. The political and geographical hub is
S;ntagma (Constitution) Square, but the always-lit hill of the Acropolis
is Athens’s “true North.”
Introducing the neighborhoods
From S;ntagma Square, pedestrian- and tourist-friendly Pláka is to the
southwest, one of the most colorful old sections of town.
Pláka’s southwest is bounded by the Acropolis Hill, perched by the
Parthenon. The Monastiráki area, which features cafes along the train
line and a flea market at Avyssinias (Abyssinian) Square, lies north of the
Acropolis and west of Pláka, next to the Ancient Agorá. The neighbor-
hood of Makriyánni, south of the Acropolis, is a tourist bedroom and
residential area.
North of Pláka and S;ntagma, arterial roads lead to Omónia Square,
once the commercial heart of the city. The square still bustles with activ-
ity by day, but at night it becomes grittier.
Northeast of S;ntagma is Kolonáki, the chichi shopping and residential
district. The area around Exárcheia Square, east of Omónia, has hip
shops and is quite lively, given the student (and infamously anarchist)
population living there.
North of Ermoú Street at Monastiráki is Psirrí, with its tanners, shoe-
makers, and tinsmiths by day, a prime dining and entertainment area at
night. More Old Athens craft shops with real experts in their field are
across Athinás Street north of Ermoú, particularly Polyklítou Street.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 539

Pedestrian Ermoú (Hermes) Street, up to S;ntagma Square, is the city’s
shoe-mad “mall.” The area of Thissío, bordering the Ancient Agorá’s
west side, has superb views of the Acropolis and Lykavittós Hill (reach-
able on foot or by cog railway), and overflows with cafes and bars, par-
ticularly along Iráklidon Street.
Finding information after you arrive
The Greek National Tourism Organization (often shortened to the
Greek acronym EOT) offers maps and information. The Information
desk is at 26 Amalías St., at S;ntagma (% 210-331-0392; www.gnto.gr),
and is open Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., weekends and holi-
days 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Getting Around Athens
The best way to sightsee around town is on foot, by Metro, and by hail-
ing the occasional taxi. Except for a visit to the city’s main museum,
you’ll likely spend most of your time in or near pedestrian-friendly Pláka,
Monastiráki, Thissío, and Psirrí.
Drivers are erratic and impatient, rarely heeding right of way at pedes-
trian crossings. Look both ways. Sidewalks are slippery, uneven, and
usually blocked, which is why most people prefer to use the roads. Rent
a car only if you’re planning trips out of Athens.
By Metro (subway)
The Metro (% 210-679-2399; www.ametro.gr) system in Athens is clean
and efficient. Line 1 begins at Piraeus, Athens’s seaport, and runs
through central Athens before terminating north of the city at Kifissiá,
an upscale suburb. Lines 2 and 3 make a large X across the city, meeting
at S;ntagma Square. For tourists, the most useful stops are Akropoli,
Thissío, S;ntagma, and Monastiráki, the latter two of which are centrally
located and offer access to two of the Metro lines.
A single ticket costs 0.80 ($1.30) and is valid for 90 minutes; a 24-hour
day pass is 3 ($4.80); and a weekly ticket is 10 ($16). The tickets are
valid on all modes of public transport within the city. Children 5 and
under ride free. Buy tickets at machines and booths inside the stations,
and cancel them in the validation machines before you reach the plat-
form. Keep your ticket with you — it’s an honor system, but it’s subject
to random checks.
By bus and trolley
Athens has several overlapping bus and bus-trolley networks. Bus no. 200
makes a circle, and can be taken from Kolokotroni Street in Monastiráki
or in S;ntagma, west of Stadíou Street. It’s useful for reaching the
National Archaeological Museum, Exárcheia, and Kolonáki districts.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
540

Bus and trolley tickets, which are sold in the Metro stations, bus ticket
booths, and some kiosks, cost 0.80 ($1.30) and are good on all modes
of public transport for 90 minutes. Make sure you cancel (validate) the
ticket in the machines on the buses (public transport uses the honor
system); otherwise you face a fine.
By tram
You can get from Amalías Street at S;ntagma to the shopping and nightlife
area of coastal Glyfáda and nearby beaches (destination: Voula) by tram
(% 210-997-8000; www.tramsa.gr), or to Flisvos Marina and the port of
Piraeus (destination: SEF). Tickets are 0.80 ($1.30) for all modes of
public transport and valid for 90 minutes. You can also purchase tickets at
machines or booths at certain stations, as well as Metro stations and bus
ticket booths. Trams run from 5 a.m. to midnight (24 hours Fri–Sat).
Upon arrival in the city, and if you want to go beyond the sightseeing
center, pick up transportation maps to help you sort out the routes, or
look online at www.oasa.gr.
By taxi
Taxis are yellow and cheap — if you can avoid getting overcharged. The
rates, normally posted on the dashboard, are 1.05 ($1.70) to start, with
a minimum charge of 2.80 ($4.50), and then 0.36 (60¢) per kilometer
(tariff 1, which shows up on the meter), rising to 0.68 ($1.10; tariff 2) if
you leave the city limits (except the airport), or travel between midnight
and 5 a.m. Other small-change add-ons include going to the airport or
being picked up from a port or bus station.
The meter should be running once you’re in the car, and the driver nor-
mally puts his photo ID in full view on the dashboard. Taxis also regu-
larly pick up other passengers to destinations that are on the way, but
everyone pays separately. This tacit sharing arrangement between driv-
ers and passengers helps to keep the rates down. Check the amount on
the meter when you climb in and pay the difference when you get out,
including the minimum or pickup charge. Taxis can also be difficult to
find around 3 p.m. (shift change) and 11:30 p.m. (waiting till the night
tariff kicks in).
You can hail a taxi on the street or call % 210-341-0553, 210-994-3000, or
210-222-1623, but you pay a surcharge of 3 to 6 ($4.80–$9.60), depend-
ing on the company, for a rendezvous. For airport pickup and tours, try
George the Famous Taxi Driver (% 210-963-7030).
By foot
Most of Athens’s main attractions are in the city center, and districts
such as Pláka, Psirrí, and Thissío are pedestrianized, so expect to see
much on foot. But watch your step, and beware of impatient drivers.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 541

Staying in Athens
Most Athens hotels were overhauled for the 2004 Games — a bonus for
post-Olympics visitors, so things such as air-conditioning and televi-
sions are standard issue in budget hotels. If you want to stay near the
sightseeing and nightlife, the areas around Pláka, Monastiráki, and
Makriyánni are your best bets. The Hellenic Chamber of Hotels, 24
Stadíou St. (% 210-323-7193; www.grhotels.gr), has hotel information
for all of Greece, but you must book yourself or through a travel agency.
The downtrodden Omónia Square zone, including southwest to
Sofokléous Street and Theátrou Square, near the Central Market, is still a
haven for shabby budget inns interspersed with a few good hotels, but
most people find the area too seedy.
Note: Hotels can request a deposit of up to 25 percent of the total for a
multiple-night stay, or not less than one night’s rate. Hotels also offer
considerable discounts: in the off-season, which can be July and August
in Athens; for multiple-night stays; for cash payment; for e-booking; and
so on. The rates quoted in this section are based on rack rates, so by all
means ask.

Makriyánni
This friendly hotel, on a quiet side street just near the entrance to the
Acropolis at the edge of Filopáppou Hill, has small but modern rooms, and
a few even have a view of the Parthenon. If your room lacks one, head up
to the roof terrace, where you can get outstanding Acropolis vistas, espe-
cially at sunset.

The street where this close-to-everything (and hence, busy) business hotel
is located is small and quiet, as are most of the pleasantly modernized
rooms. But book early so that you can snag one (room nos. 603–607) with
a view of the Acropolis. The Cypria’s low season is July and August.

Monastiráki
On busy Athinás Street, plain-but-nice rooms and cheerful service make
the Attalos popular, as does its Metro location, close to Pláka and the
Central Market (agorá). The roof terrace has a snack bar and view to the
Acropolis, as do 37 of the upper-floor rooms, many with balconies. A 2004
renovation brought soundproof windows, hair dryers, in-room safes, and
a Wi-Fi–equipped Internet corner.

Pláka
For the price — and do ask about discounts — you can’t beat this luxury-
category hotel’s prime spot. On higher floors the rooms are smaller but
have bigger balconies, and about 20 of them, including suites, have an
Acropolis view. Rooftop pool, Jacuzzi, and bar are open May to September,
or use the indoor pool, sauna, steam room, Jacuzzi, and gym.

Embassy District
This boutique hotel is suited for those who want to stay “uptown,” where
the Athens Tower, concert hall, and many embassies, museums, hospitals,
and businesses are based. Just east of upmarket Kolonáki and Lykavittós
Hill, a lively bar and restaurant zone is at nearby Ambelokipi Metro station,
and more intimate cafe/bars are at Mavili Square just around the corner.

cal heavyweights. An Acropolis-view rooftop bar/restaurant, the city’s best
spa, and indoor and outdoor rooftop pools are also here.

Dining in Athens
Greeks are more concerned about the quality and freshness of food than
the appearance of where it’s served. Fruits and vegetables still taste of
what they look like, and portions are generous. Look for places that are
full at 10 p.m. — the Greek dinner hour — if you want to eat where the
locals do. Tavérnas (typical Greek restaurants that serve barrel wine)
that cater to tourists are open earlier than the usual 7 p.m. You’ll find
scores of them in Pláka.
Mezédes or mezé, appetizers served before the main course or on their
own, are a key part of the Greek diet, as is the ubiquitous horiátiki saláta,
or village salad, known to you and me as Greek salad. Greeks eat
mezédes with wine at a laid-back tavérna, or with oúzo (a popular anise-
flavored spirit) at an oúzerie (a tavérna where you find oúzo, beer, wine,
and mezédes). The tastiest are tzatzíki (a yogurt, cucumber, and garlic
dip), melitzanosaláta (puréed eggplant), grilled kalamári (squid),
oktapódi (octopus), loukánika (sausage), and krokétes (croquettes), usu-
ally made with potato, cheese, zucchini, or tomato.
Other outstanding dishes served as mezédes are dolmádes (grapevine
leaves stuffed with rice and sometimes minced meat), keftédes (spicy
meatballs), and moussaká (an eggplant, potato, and minced-meat casse-
role with a béchamel and cheese crust), which might also be listed as an
entree. Other entrees are souvláki — shish kebabs of hirinó (pork) or
kotópoulo (chicken) — and dishes made with pork and chicken, as well
as arní (lamb), psária (fish), moskári (beef), and katsíki (goat).
Greek yiaoúrti (yogurt) is creamy and delicious, served as dessert driz-
zled with méli (honey). Baklavá is flaky, thin phyllo pastry layered with
walnuts and soaked in honey; variations include a syrupy fruit or choco-
late center.
Athens’s port city of Piraeus, 10km (6 miles) away, boasts the best
seafood restaurants; freshness is a concern in non-seafood restaurants
in Athens due to overfishing and high prices.
You’ll rarely find pine-resin-flavored retsína (a table wine) these days.
Krasí (barrel wine) is served at most tavérnas and restaurants. Although
most Greeks now prefer whiskey, the national distilled drink is oúzo, a
clear, anise-flavored liqueur that turns milky white when you add water.
For lunch on the run, eat a g;ro (pita bread filled with strips of grilled
spiced lamb, pork, or chicken), a sandwich, or a crepe from one of the
many sandwich shops, or a tirópita (cheese pie) or sweet bougátsa (a
warm, creamy semolina-filled pie) from one of countless holes in the
wall. At a cafe, try a frappé (iced coffee) in summer.

Exploring Athens
The sprawling appearance of Athens today can’t hide the fact that it was
once the center of Western civilization. The world-class sites located
here are a testament to the city’s history, and they mustn’t be missed.
Athens’s top sights
The Acropolis and the Parthenon
The Acropolis Hill in Athens’s heart is where, mythology tells us, the gods
Athena and Poseidon squared off to see who could take better care of the
citizens and, thus, become the city’s guardian and namesake. (Poseidon
produced a saltwater spring from the rock of the Acropolis; Athena pro-
duced the versatile olive tree.)
The Sacred Rock of the Acropolis, topped by the Parthenon temple to
Athena, the parthéna (virgin) goddess, is part of Greece’s identity, a land-
mark that symbolizes the country itself. It is a constant reminder of the
modern city’s ancient heritage.
It is not as difficult a climb as it appears. You enter beside the Beulé Gate,
built by Roman Emperor Valerian in A.D. 267. The attractive Ionic temple of
Athena Nike (built 424 B.C., rebuilt A.D. 1940, and again in progress) is on
your right.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 549

The world has bigger and better-preserved ancient shrines, but even with
the seemingly permanent scaffolding for restoration, the Parthenon
remains the poster child of Greek temples. Between 447 and 438 B.C., the
Athenians spent lavishly to build this shrine to their patron. A 40-foot
statue of Athena (a small Roman copy is in the National Archaeological
Museum) once graced this all-marble temple. The structure is perfectly
proportioned, and a few architectural tricks make it appear flawless to the
naked eye. To compensate for the eye’s natural tendency to create illu-
sions, the horizontal surfaces are bowed slightly upward in the middle to
appear perfectly level, the columns lean slightly inward to appear parallel,
and each is thicker in the middle so it looks like a typical cylinder.
The Parthenon remained virtually intact through the Middle Ages. It became
an Orthodox church in the sixth century, a Catholic church during the
Crusades, and an Islamic mosque when the Ottoman Turks occupied the
region, an occupation that lasted some 400 years. But in 1687 Venetians
attacked the Turkish-ruled city, and lobbed a cannonball at the temple
where ammunition was stored. The explosion blew up the heart of the build-
ing. They left town (along with some major antiquities), within six months.
Although the Parthenon was once covered almost entirely with sculptures
and ornamental carvings, little remains on the temple today. Covetous
travelers and diplomats helped themselves from the rubble in the late 18th
century during Turkish rule, famously (or infamously, depending on your
viewpoint), Britain’s Lord Elgin. After gaining access to the military-con-
trolled Acropolis armed with a permit only to draw Athens’s ancient build-
ings, his foreman and workers hastily set about chiseling out what they
could from the remaining sculpted friezes and pediments on the facade.
Some were destroyed in the process, and the temple was left severely dam-
aged. The Elgin (or Parthenon) marbles were shipped to England from
1801 to 1811 and are now housed in the British Museum. Greece has long
campaigned for their return, but the museum has refused, despite increas-
ing international pressure. Confident of their eventual return, Athens con-
structed the massive and impressive New Acropolis Museum, 2–4
Makriyanni St. (%
210-924-1043 [info only]; www.newacropolis
museum.gr), near the south slope to house the friezes, as well as display
some ten times more than the collection at the old museum on the hill.
Built on stilts over an archaeological site (you can see it floodlit through
the floor), it will fully open by the end of 2008 or early 2009. Some exhibits
can be sneak-previewed before then.
If you look down the Acropolis’s south side, you see the half-moon shapes
of two theaters. The huge one to the east that is mostly in ruins is the
Theater of Dionysos, built in 330 B.C. (entrance on Dionysíou Areopagítou;
% 210-322-4625). Near the entrance to the Acropolis is the Odeum of
Heródes Átticus, built in A.D. 161 and restored in recent decades to stage
concerts during the Athens Epidaurus Festival from June to October. For
information, visit the festival office, 39 Panepistimíou St. (also known as El.
Venizelou; % 210-327-2000 or 210-928-2900; www.greekfestival.gr), or
the Odeum (also known as Iródion; % 210-324-2121 or 210-323-2771).

The Ancient Agorá (Market)
The everyday life of ancient Athenians revolved around the agorá (mar-
ketplace). You have to use your imagination to reconstruct the historic
site today, which extends as an enclosed park from Areopagus (Mars Hill)
into Monastiráki. Broken columns are strewn among ancient foundations
interspersed with olive, pink oleander, cypress, and palm trees. It takes
time to really study the lay of the land, but it’s also a pleasant place just
to sit under a tree and read after a hectic day. Otherwise, you can breeze
through in an hour.
The Hephaisteíon, better known as the Thisseíon, built between 449 and
447 B.C. (and one of the world’s best-preserved Greek temples), and the
reconstructed Stoa of Attalos are the two most remarkable remains. A stoa
was a series of columns spaced evenly apart supporting a long roof under
which shopkeepers set up business, people met, and philosophers held
court in the shade. Stoics were followers of a school of thought that devel-
oped at a stoa.
The Agorá’s museum is in the circa-1950s Stoa of Attalos, the second-cen-
tury-B.C. version rebuilt by the Rockefeller-funded American School of
Classical Studies. The Agorá holds fascinating artifacts that show how the
ancients carried out early democratic processes. Check out the bronze
jury ballots — where jurors voted with a bronze wheel with a solid axle if
they felt the man on trial was innocent and with an empty axle if they found
the defendant’s story as hollow as the rod — and the marble kleroterion
(allotment machine), an early version of our modern lotto machines, used
for selecting citizens for jury duty.

Cycladic tradition, which began in about 3000 B.C. Famed 20th-century
artists such as Brancusi, Henry Moore, Modigliani, and Picasso were all
inspired by these sculptures. The museum’s second floor houses ancient
Greek pieces from the fifth century B.C.

National Archaeological Museum
Museío/Polytechnío
This museum is one of the greatest archaeological museums in the
world — a testament to Greece’s eminence and beauty hundreds of
years before the rise of Rome, and thousands of years before Columbus
set sail for the New World.
You need two hours for the most perfunctory run-through, and much
longer to fully appreciate the staggering collection. A guide would be ideal,
but a printed catalog is also helpful.
Life-size and oversize bronze statues from Athens’s Golden Age (400s B.C.)
are the most striking artifacts, including Poseidon about to throw his (now
missing) trident, and a tiny child jockey atop a galloping horse. Most of
these bronzes were found at the bottom of the sea by divers in the late
19th and 20th centuries, except for the draped and scarved “Lady of
Kalymnos.” Found by a fisherman in 1994, she looks an awful lot like the
Virgin Mary, but is believed to date from the second century B.C.
Representing the sixth and seventh centuries B.C., the museum has stat-
ues of kouri — attractive young men with cornrow hair, taking one step
forward with their arms rigidly at their sides. These figures, adapted from
Egyptian models, set the standard in Greek art until the Classical period
ushered in more lifelike sculpture.
There is also delicate jewelry and pottery, drama masks, and a good col-
lection of what could be contemporary Cycladic figurines dating from 2800
B.C., highlighted in the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympics.
See map p. 544. 44 Patissíon (28th Octovriou St.; several blocks north of Omónia

More cool things to see and do
 Wandering the city in search of less touristy sites: Apart from the
ancient ruins, there is an enormous legacy from other eras, includ-
ing Byzantine, Ottoman, and the 1821 War of Independence that
attracted romantics throughout the Continent, the most celebrated
being the English poet, Byron. Scores of museums and galleries
hold beautifully displayed relics of this vast cultural heritage.
For more antiquities, walk past Hadrian’s Arch (on Amalías
Avenue), through which the Roman emperor marched in A.D. 132 to
dedicate the gigantic Temple of Olympian Zeus (% 210-922-6330).
Built at a snail’s pace between 515 B.C. and A.D. 132, Greece’s one-
time largest temple measures 110m × 44m (360 × 143 ft.). Fifteen of
the original 104 columns are still standing, each 17m (56 ft.) high.
The site is open May through October daily from 8 a.m. to 7:30
p.m., November through April daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It’s
closed December 25 and 26, January 1, March 25, Easter
(Orthodox) Sunday, Ayiou Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in May or June),
and May 1. Admission is 2 ($3.20).
The octagonal Tower of the Winds, also known as Aérides, in the
Roman Agorá (% 210-324-5220 or 210-321-0185) was built in the
first century B.C. by astronomer Andronikos. Now missing its
bronze weather vane, it shows the eight wind deities and once held
a mechanized water clock. In the 18th century, whirling dervishes
did their religious spinning dance here. The site also has a 15th-
century mosque. It’s open May through October daily from 8 a.m.
to 7 p.m., November through April daily from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. It’s
closed December 25 and 26, January 1, March 25, Easter
(Orthodox) Sunday, Ayiou Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in May or June),
and May 1. Admission is 2 ($3.20).
An ancient cemetery, Kerameikós (% 210-346-3552), at the west
end of Ermoú Street, was outside the walls of the ancient city. You
can see some of the old walls here, as well as the ancient city gates.
The site has roads lined with tombs and includes a section of the
Iera Odos (Sacred Way), which still exists just outside the cemetery
and reaches Elefsína (Eleusis), 23km (14 miles) west, where the
ancients worshipped Demeter. Hours are November through April
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., May through October daily from 8
a.m. to 7 p.m. It’s closed December 25 and 26, January 1, March 25,
Easter (Orthodox) Sunday, Ayiou Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in May or
June), and May 1. Admission is 2 ($3.20).
 Seeing the changing of the guard: Two guards wearing traditional
costume at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in front of Parliament
at S;ntagma Square, ceremoniously march back and forth at the
top of the hour, every hour. The more elaborate duty-rotation cere-
mony is each Sunday at 11 a.m.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 553

 Enjoying some Greek nightlife: Apart from tavérnas offering live
bouzoúki music (you’ll find many of these in Psirrí), bouzoúki clubs —
named after the mandolin-type instrument played in them — can give
you a taste of traditional folk music and dancing. The musical styles
include the rebétika and laiká tunes of the urban lower class, or
dimotiká, upbeat country folk music. Don’t expect to smash plates,
however. The practice disappeared as people prospered, and how-
ever fun it was as entertainment, it has also gone the way of the con-
trived village party. You can throw flowers instead.
As you get farther from touristy Pláka, the clubs get more authenti-
cally Greek, but deep pockets are needed, such as to share a bottle
of whiskey over a long night with friends. Some clubs are used to
seeing tourists, and the waiters may teach you some simple
dances. Things really kick off around 11 p.m., but if you want a
good seat, the earlier you arrive, the better.
For good rebétika music, try Rebétiki Istorías, 181 Ippokrátous St.,
Neapoli (% 210-642-4937). From September through Easter, it’s
open Tuesday through Sunday; from Easter through June, it’s 
only open on Friday and Saturday; and it’s closed July and August.
Cover with a drink is 6 ($9.60). (Bus no. 230 runs up here; take 
a taxi home.) Taverna Mostroú, 22 Mnissikléos St., in Pláka 
(% 210-323-5558 or 210-322-5337), is a small dimotiká club (most
are huge halls). It’s open daily from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. (Nov–Apr
Fri–Sun only). A bottle of wine and mezé (to share) will set you
back 75 ($120); a seat at the bar starts at 10 ($16).
You can see folk-dancing in costume at the Dora Stratou Greek
Dance Theater, 8 Scholíou St., Pláka (% 210-324-4395 office, or
210-921-4650 theater; www.grdance.org). Shows take place May
through September Tuesday through Saturday at 9:30 p.m., Sunday
at 8:15 p.m. Sunday (closed Mon) performances are at the open-air
theater on Filopáppou Hill. Tickets cost 15 ($24).
Cinephiles shouldn’t miss a screening at an open-air cinema in a
garden or on a rooftop during the summer. One is the Cine Paris,
22 Kydathinéon St., Pláka (% 210-322-2071).
Guided tours
Key Tours (% 210-923-3166; www.keytours.com) offers morning tours
of Athens that include the Acropolis for 52 ($83), afternoon tours to
coastal Cape Soúnion (Temple of Poseidon) for 40 ($64), and day trips
to Delphi or Mycenae and Epidaurus, site of the acoustically perfect
ancient theater, for 86 ($138). A night tour that includes dinner in Pláka
with bouzoúki and Greek dancing runs 60 ($96).
For organized walking tours, try Athens Walking Tours (% 210-884-7269;
www.athenswalkingtours.gr). The tours, including customized ones,
take three hours, and cost 29 ($46) adults, 19 ($30) students; they’re
free for children 12 and under. Note that you’ll need to pay for admission
to the various archaeological sites on top of the cost of the tour.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
554

For organized bicycle tours or long-term bicycle rentals (7 days or
more), try Pame Volta (% 210-675-2886; www.pamevolta.gr). They
mainly do group tours, but from May through November, two-hour city
tours leave on Wednesdays and Saturdays and cost 40 ($64), including
a coffee break in Thissío. Advance reservations (two to three weeks) are
needed for May, September, and October tours.
Following an itinerary
If you’d rather organize your own tour, this section offers some tips for
building your own Athens itineraries.
If you have one day
If you see only one sight in Athens, it has to be the Acropolis, with its
imposing Parthenon. Spend the morning here admiring the work of the
ancients, their temple, and their theaters. Then visit the New Acropolis
Museum near the hill’s south slope, if it’s open by the time of your visit.
After lunch (grab a souvláki or g;ros to go), and trolley up from
Panepistimíou Street to the incredible National Archaeological Museum,
which houses one of the richest collections of antiquities in the world.
In the late afternoon, go to Pláka to explore the alleyways and have
dinner. If you’re there between May and September, make your way to
Filopáppou Hill to take in a performance of the Dora Stratou Greek
Dance Theater, or see a film at an open-air cinema. Then head to a
Thissío cafe/bar for a nightcap and to gaze at the Acropolis and
Lykavittós Hill.
If you have two days
Spend Day 1 as described in the previous section. On Day 2, start off at
the Ancient Agorá, exploring its ruins and visiting the museum inside
the Stoa of Attalos to see, literally, the machinery of the world’s first
democracy. Then make your way through Monastiráki for an early lunch
at one of its sidewalk tavérnas (Thanasis at Monastiráki station is excel-
lent). Take bus no. 200 at Kolokotroni Street to the Museum of Cycladic
Art in Kolonáki to peruse Cycladic sculptures, and then take bus no. 060
from there to the teleferíque (cog railway) up Lykavittós Hill to admire
the view over the city.
In the late afternoon, go through the National Gardens and Záppeion en
route to the marble Panathinaikó (also known as Panathenian,
Kalimármara) Stadium, site of the first modern Olympics in 1896.
Walk past the Temple of Olympian Zeus and Hadrian’s Arch on your
way to dinner in Pláka (try Platanos Tavérna), or find either a bouzoúki
restaurant in Psirrí or a real bouzoúki club to plant yourself in for an
evening of oúzo and song. Otherwise, head to upmarket Thissío for a
lively or laid-back evening under the stars, or to student-zone Exárcheia
to mingle with Athenian youth at a thumping bar.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 555

If you have three days
Spend Day 3 shopping and exploring Old Athens on both sides of
Athinás Street, between Ermoú and Evripídou (Euripides). Tinware,
shoes, gloves, and bags are still made to order in Psirrí, but this won’t
last for long.
Have lunch at a souvláki joint on Athinás Street opposite the Central
Market, and buy dried herbs to take home. Then go down to
Kerameikós ancient cemetery, ogle at the flea market just across Ermoú
Street if it’s Sunday (before 3 p.m.), and go across Pireós Street to the
fascinating old gasworks at Gázi, now called the Technopolis, to see
what’s on exhibit, or to see if a music festival is taking place.
Late afternoon, come back through Thissío and have a frappé at the
square, with its superb view. If you aren’t tired yet, head up Ermoú
Street toward S;ntagma Square to buy a beautiful pair of leather shoes,
or go into Pláka for souvenirs or intricate gold jewelry at great prices.
Or take a break from shopping and take the bus to Cape Soúnion to see
the sunset at the Temple of Poseidon.
At night, take up what you missed from the evenings on Days 1 and 2, or
head down to the lively small port of Mikrolimáni (Faliro Metro station
or tram) in Piráeus for a seafood blowout.
Traveling beyond Athens
Most visitors come to Greece to see the remains of an ancient culture or
relax on a sun-drenched island. Indeed, archaeology buffs and island-
hoppers alike have seemingly endless choices to consider. Delphi’s inter-
esting artifacts and beautiful mountain setting is a top contender, and
the most visually spectacular island is Santoríni. (Its Greek name is
Thira, but everyone recognizes it by its Venetian moniker.) Even though
Santoríni is the farthest Cycladic island from Athens, its tourist infra-
structure makes it easy for first-time visitors to see. It has interesting
ancient sites, a stunning cliff-top view, as well as quaint seaside villages
and a hopping nightlife — and don’t forget the beaches.
Delphi: The center of the ancient world
If you only have time to visit one archaeological site in Greece, it would
be a hard choice between Ancient Olympia near Patras, site of one of the
Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, with its unique, Games-related
antiquities; Delphi, the site of oracle Apollo, with its amazing setting;
Alexander the Great’s stomping grounds at the foot of Mount Olympus,
Dion, the most enchanting; and, lest we forget, the tombs at Vergina. But
the ancients chose well for the place they considered the center of the
world, and you won’t be disappointed if you choose it, too. Delphi lies
halfway up a mountainside, with the impressive Mount Parnassós sur-
rounding the site and a lush, narrow valley of olive trees stretching
down to the Gulf of Corinth.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
556

You can do Delphi in one long day trip from Athens, but staying the night
will make the trip less hectic. After spending time in the city, you may
welcome Delphi’s small-town beauty and pace.
Getting there
Buses (% 210-831-7096 or 210-880-8080 in Athens, 22650-82-317 or
22650-82-880 in Delphi) make the three-hour trip from Athens six times a
day; the fare is 14 ($22). If you’re taking the ferry to Greece, you can bus
directly from Patras, or else from the northern port city of Thessaloniki if
you’re arriving by train. Both make the journey once a day and arrive via
Amfissa, a well-connected town 20km (12 miles) from Delphi.
Tourist information is available at the town hall, 11 Apóllonos St. 
(% 22650-82-900), usually open Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m.
to 2:30 p.m. The office of the Tourist Police, which also provides infor-
mation, is at 3 Angelos Sikelianoú St. (% 22650-82-220).
Seeing the sights
Delphi is a small town with little side streets connecting the arterial
roads. The bus can drop you off in the town center near the archaeologi-
cal site, or at the west end of town, where it’s then a five- to ten-minute
walk. Many visitors start at the museum on the way to the ruins, but if
you want to beat the heat and the crowds, go straight to the ruins first
thing in the morning, which will also set the stage for the more intellec-
tual experience of examining the museum’s treasures.
The main ruins area is the Sanctuary of Apollo (% 22650-82-312 or
22650-82-346), which extends up the lower slopes of Mount Parnassós.
You follow the Sacred Way, a marble path lined with the ruined treasur-
ies of Greek city-states that tried to outdo each other in their efforts to
offer the greatest riches to the sanctuary. The Athenian Treasury,
located just past the first bend in the Sacred Way, looks remarkably well-
preserved because it was rebuilt in 1906.
The Sacred Way hits a plateau at what was once the inner sanctum of
the Temple of Apollo. Pilgrims from all over the Western world came
here to seek advice or have their fortunes told by a seer, the Oracle of
Delphi, who spoke the wisdom of Apollo. Earthquakes, looting, and land-
slides have pretty much destroyed the temple’s partially underground
chambers.
The fourth-century-B.C. theater at the top of the sanctuary is the best
preserved of its kind in Greece. (The Romans helped, rebuilding it about
2,000 years ago.) Musicians and performers competed here in the
Pythian Games, which emphasized culture more than the Olympic
Games, as they were held in honor of Apollo, god of poets and inventor
of the lyre. The view of the whole archaeological site is fantastic from
the theater, but you can climb even farther up to the long, tree-lined sta-
dium, which dates to the sixth century B.C. and is where the Pythian
Games’ athletic contests took place.
Chapter 24: Athens and the Greek Islands 557

After you leave the Sanctuary of Apollo, if you keep walking down the
main road, you see Delphi’s most beautiful ruins below you. These ruins
are in the Marmaria — so named because later Greeks used the area as
a marble quarry. The most striking sight is the remains of the small,
round temple called Tholos, built in 380 B.C. In the 1930s, three of the
original 20 columns in the temple’s outer shell were re-erected and a sec-
tion of the lintel (the horizontal connecting span) was replaced on top.
The temple is at its most beautiful when the sun sets behind it.
Admission to the ruins is 6 ($9.60), 9 ($14) for both the site and the
museum. The ruins are open in summer daily from 8 a.m. to 7:15 p.m. In
winter (Nov–May), hours are usually from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The site is
closed December 25 to 26, January 1, March 25, Easter (Orthodox)
Sunday, Ayiou Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in May or June), and May 1.
Delphi’s Archaeological Museum (% 22650-82-312; www.culture.gr)
has kouri (stylized statues of youths) from the seventh century B.C. and
gifts that were once part of the Sacred Way’s treasuries, among other
artifacts. Don’t miss the winged sphinx of the Naxians or the bronze
charioteer from 474 B.C. The museum also houses the Omphalós, or
Navel Stone, a piece of rock that marked the spot that the ancient
Greeks believed was the center (belly button) of the world, under the
Temple of Apollo. God of gods Zeus was believed to have released two
eagles simultaneously at opposite ends of the earth (which was thought
to be flat), and the point where they crashed into each other and fell to
the ground marked the world’s midpoint.
Admission is 6 ($9.60), 9 ($14) for both the museum and the site. The
museum is open in summer Tuesday through Sunday from 8 a.m. to 7:15
p.m. and Monday noon to 6:30 p.m. In winter (Nov–May), hours are usu-
ally from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. The museum and site are closed December
25 to 26, January 1, March 25, Easter (Orthodox) Sunday, Ayiou
Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in May or June), and May 1. Note: The ruins nor-
mally close slightly earlier than the museum.
Where to stay and dine
Spend the night at the Hotel Varonos, 25 Pavlou and Frederíkis St.,
Delphi’s main street (%/Fax 22650-82-345; www.hotel-varonos.gr),
where the rooms have spectacular views and doubles run 80 ($128)
with breakfast and air-conditioning in summer. Taverna Vakhos, 31
Apóllonos St. (% 22650-83-186), is a simple but delicious and inexpen-
sive restaurant with great views.
Santoríni: Sun, sea, and . . . black sand
Santoríni (Thíra in Greek) is the farthest in the Cyclades, a “circle” of
isles skirting once-sacred Delos islet in the Aegean Sea. The group of
islands is most famous for the cubic, whitewashed houses. Crescent-
shaped Santoríni’s main attraction is its steep black and red cliffs that
curve around a caldera (volcanic crater) of water and a still-active

volcano; the views from here are sublime. Black-sand beaches, vine-
yards, whitewashed villages, and ancient cities combine to make it a
must-see.
Santoríni’s charms are not a secret; it’s one of the most heavily visited
Greek islands and can seem like one big disco in July and August, a
modern symbol of mythical hedonism. Regardless, it remains well worth
a visit whenever possible.

Some people actually make Santoríni a day trip by plane from Athens, and
passengers stopping for an afternoon cruise break make noon the most
crowded time. Santoríni is worth a two- to four-day stay if you can swing
it, though life winds down considerably from late October through Easter.
Getting there and getting around
Several flights make the easy 50-minute trip from Athens daily. Call
Olympic Airways (% 210-966-6666; www.olympicairlines.com) or
Aegean Air (% 210-626-1000; www.aegeanair.com). Fares are based on
availability and cost from 50 ($80) one-way. Flying even one-way saves
time, especially if you also want to island-hop in the area.
Two to five boats depart daily to Santoríni from Athens’s Piraeus port for
around 35 ($56) one-way in the summer. For information on the ferry
companies and their schedules, visit a travel agent (central Athens has
many), or call the Port Authority in Piraeus (schedules for one week only,
changing on Wed) at % 1441 (English-speaking; phone charges apply), or
210-414-7800 (recording in Greek), or in Santoríni’s main town of Fira at 
% 22860-23-702 or 22860-22-239. The trip takes 5 to 14 hours, depending
on how many stops the ferry makes at other islands along the way.
Buses (% 22860-25-462; www.ktel-santorini.gr) on the island con-
nect Athinios ferry port with Fira a few miles north; there are travel
agencies for booking private transport and accommodations at the port
but not much else.
Buses also connect Fira with the airport, the ruins of Akrotíri, and most
villages and popular beaches. Tickets cost from 1.40 to 2 ($2.25–$3.20),
paid on the bus, and most buses leave every 30 to 60 minutes (schedules
are posted at the depot in Fira). Taxis (% 22860-22-555 or 22860-23-951)
from the airport to Fira should cost around 12 ($19).
Santoríni has no official tourist office, but dozens of private travel agents
distribute free info, including Kamari Tours (% 22860-31-390 or
22860-22-666 in Fira), opposite the landmark Museum of Prehistoric
Thira, and Dakoutros Travel (% 22860-22-958) on the main square.
They can help you get a hotel or book a ferry or plane ticket, and they
also offer tours. For additional information about the island, visit
www.santorini.com or the municipality Web site at www.thira.gr.
Seeing the sights
If you don’t want to make the sightseeing connections yourself, stop by
one of Fira’s travel agencies, which make their living selling half- and full-
day excursions to all the island’s sights, including boat trips to the vol-
cano and hot springs for 18 ($29), and sunset cruises on a schooner for
40 ($64).
A very long set of steps connects Fira to the old port that’s used for
excursions; walk, take a mule, or the cable car that runs every 20 to 30
minutes for 4 ($6.40).
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
560

The island’s best waterfront is Kamári Beach, a 7.25km-long (41⁄2-mile)
stretch of black pebbles and sand on the southeast shore. It gets very
crowded in July and August.
The romantic should go straight to picture-perfect Oía (Ia), 12km 
(71⁄2 miles) north of Fira by bus or 8km (5 miles) on the clifftop road, 
but be warned: The shops and prices are high-end, although rooms can
be reasonable.
Other popular activities include shopping at Santoríni’s many boutiques,
renting scooters to explore the island, and sampling the tasty wine 
produced with the help of mineral-rich volcanic soil. There are many 
wineries; Boutari winery (% 22860-81-011; www.boutari.gr) has wine-
tasting tours running from March through November and costing from
5 ($8). Ask the driver of the bus from Fira to Akrotíri to let you off at
the winery, 100m (328 feet) from Megalohori bus stop.
The impressive ruins of the Minoan city of Ancient Akrotíri (% 22860-
81-366), also referred to as Greece’s Pompeii, are a must-see, if the site is
open. Archaeologists have conducted covered excavations of this 3,700-
year-old town near popular Red Beach, but it’s been closed since 2005
when part of the roof collapsed.
After most of the island was destroyed in a volcanic explosion in the
mid-1600s B.C., a second civilization began. The capital was Ancient
Thíra (900 B.C.–A.D. 150), which lies 1,200 feet above Kamári Beach.
Considerably less is left standing than at Akrotíri, but the site itself,
perched up on a headland, is very impressive. Ancient Thíra is open
Tuesday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. There is no entrance
fee when archaeologists are excavating, but take a little cash with you in
case this changes when you visit, and to buy refreshments or snacks
from the canteen at the top of the paved road. From here, it’s a short but
sharp climb to the ruins.
Get there by taking the bus to Kamári, which lets you off at the bottom
of the steep 4km (21⁄2-mile) switchback road; give yourself an hour to
walk up. If you have your own wheels, a scooter will make it. Kamari
Tours (% 22860-31-390 or 22860-22-666 in Fira) does excursions to the
site for 10 ($16) round-trip by minibus from Kamári. Or take a taxi for
50 ($80) an hour from Fira; expect to spend about an hour there.
Fira’s small but outstanding Archaeological Museum (% 22860-22-217)
near the cable-car terminus, contains artifacts from Ancient Thíra; the
superb Museum of Prehistoric Thíra (% 22860-23-217) holds objects
from Ancient Akrotíri, including Cycladic figurines and beautifully
designed 3,700-year-old pottery. Admission is 3 ($4.80) at each
museum. Both are open Tuesday through Sunday from 8:30 a.m. to 3
p.m. (to 7:30 p.m. July and Aug). Closed December 25 to 26, January 1,
March 25, Easter (Orthodox) Sunday, Ayiou Pnévmatos (Whit Mon, in
May or June), and May 1.

Where to stay
Most hotels are in Fira — but you also hear the most noise and run into
the most tourists. Try to get a room with a view of the caldera, which is
what you get in the 95 to 175 ($152–$280) doubles at Loucas Hotel
(% 22860-22-480 or 22860-22-680; Fax: 22860-24-882; www.loucashotel.
com). Go left at the FRANGO’S sign on the way to the old port to reach it.
If you want to stay on the beach at Kamári, try the Kamári Beach Hotel
(% 22860-31-216 or 22860-31-243; Fax: 2286-32-120; www.kamari
beach.gr). Many of the 100 to 160 ($160–$256) doubles — including
breakfast — have balconies for enjoying the beach and sea view.
In Oía, most studios and hotels are built right into the cliff. Try the
Chelidonia (% 22860-71-287; www.chelidonia.com), which has villas
and studios from 140 to 155 ($224–$248) for a studio.
As on most Greek islands, people who want to rent you a room in their
house greet most ferries. Ask questions, especially about location,
before you head off, and don’t commit until you’ve seen the place. These
private rooms can be your only option if you arrive late and without
reservations in July or August. Most rooms cost from 30 ($48) off-
season, to 80 ($128) or 100 ($160) in summer.
Many hotels on Santoríni are open only from Easter (Orthodox) to late
October. In the off-season, the demand for hotel rooms nose-dives, so
you can get a good deal on a private room.
Where to dine
For light dining in Fira, try Kástro (% 22860-22-503), which attracts scads
of day-trippers because of its location across from the cable-car terminal,
but the beautiful views of the volcanic crater are worth the hassle. For one
of the best meals in Greece, hit much-reviewed Selene (% 22860-22-249;
www.selene.gr) in Fira, known for dishes such as sliced octopus with
white eggplant salad, and baked sea bass with tomatoes and capers
wrapped in fava beans. It opens at 7 p.m. from April through October.
Part V: Mediterranean Europe 
562
The island that blew its top
Santoríni was a circular volcano until an eruption in the 1600s B.C. blew half the island
into the air. This created massive tidal waves, spewed ash all over the region, and
sparked earthquakes that swept the Aegean — an event that may have helped destroy
the Minoan civilization, which was centered on Crete. A wealthy Minoan city called
Akrotíri was on Santoríni, and some historians think that this city’s volcanic destruc-
tion, just at the dawn of recorded history, fueled the mythology about a “lost conti-
nent.” In other words, it could be the basis of the myth of Atlantis.

If you’re at Kamári Beach, most restaurants cater to foreign palates from
the influx of package tourists. Head for tavérnas along the beachfront,
such as Skaramagas (% 22860-32-771), for typical Greek fare and
seafood.
In Oía, best-value meals are at cliffside Skala (% 22860-71-362) and
Thalami taverna (% 22860-71-009), on the main pedestrian road (Nik.
Nomikou) south of the church square.

Safety
Apart from averting a fall on an uneven
sidewalk and giving selfish drivers the right
of way, visitors have only a few minor con-
cerns. Young women may get propositioned
by shopkeepers in tourist areas, and touts
often try to lure single men to unscrupulous
bars with beautiful women or to hotel room
“parties.” The visitor is then forced to pay
the bill for all. Don’t accept offers of food or
water, which may be drugged, from
“friendly locals” at tourist sites, and put
your hand over the keypad at ATMs when
you enter your PIN to avoid “card theft.”
Although Greece has a low crime rate and
you can safely walk the streets well into the
night, pickpocketing, mostly on public
transport during busy times, is a problem.
Motorcycle thieves have also targeted
mainly seniors by pulling up alongside and
pulling off shoulder bags, and often, the
victim. Keep your valuables out of reach
and out of sight.
Taxes
A value-added tax (VAT), normally 19 per-
cent, is included in the price of all goods and
services in Greece, with reduced rates for
items like books and food. Non–European
Union residents can get VAT refunds at the
airport with a form obtained at shops with
TAX FREE or DUTY FREE signs, if they’ve spent a
minimum of 120 ($192). Look for the Tax
Refund booth (% 210-353-2216) at the
Departures level. For more on the VAT, see
Chapter 4.
Taxis
See “Getting Around Athens,” earlier in this
chapter.
Telephone
Many of the city’s public phones only
accept phone cards, available at news-
stands in several denominations starting at
3 ($4.80). The card works for 100 short
local calls (fewer long-distance or interna-
tional calls). Widely available prepaid call-
ing cards (kiosks, exchange bureaus, and
so on) start at 5 ($8) and work out
cheaper. Some kiosks still have metered
phones; you pay what the meter records.
Local phone calls cost 0.03 (5¢) for the
first two minutes or part thereof, and a simi-
lar rate for each additional minute. You can
phone home directly by contacting AT&T
(% 00-800-1311), MCI (% 00-800-1211), or
Sprint (% 00-800-1411).
For telephone assistance in English, dial 
% 139.
Transit Info
For local bus schedules, dial % 185; for bus
schedules in the rest of Greece, call % 210-
512-4910 or 210-831-7153. For train info, call
% 1110. For flight info, call the airport at 
% 210-353-0000. For domestic ship info, call
% 1441 or 210-414-7800 (recording in Greek).

anything useful about them) and explains the history of every

Chapter 25
The Ten Most Overrated
Sights and Attractions 
in Europe
In This Chapter
 Taking a pass on London’s Changing of the Guard and Madame Tussaud’s
 Recognizing the fakery in many of Madrid’s flamenco shows
 Skipping the city of Athens
 Foregoing famed boulevards and beaches
 Bypassing the big-name shopping locales
T
he sights listed in this chapter don’t always live up to their hype.
Nevertheless, we still include some of them in this book, because
they’re too popular to ignore. Plus, this list is subjective. We think these
places and activities are overrated — but you may enjoy the heck out of
them, and that’s okay, too.
Some of the sights listed in this chapter are so unjustly famous that we
simply didn’t include them in the book at all. So if you’re wondering why
the French Riviera is missing, read on and find out.
London’s Changing of the Guard at
Buckingham Palace
On the yawn scale, we give it about an eight out of ten. The changing of
the guard features diffident pomp, halfhearted ceremony, and a clearly
bored marching band. And it’s crowded, too.
If you absolutely must take part in this tourist tradition, see Chapter 10
for the details.

London’s Madame Tussaud’s Wax Museum
Pay $42 to ogle wax portraits (albeit expertly executed) of famous dead
people? Kitschy, maybe. A must-see? Never. This place is only famous
because it has been franchised around the world — sort of a fast-food
approach to culture for a museum that’s only of marginal historical inter-
est in the first place.
If you want to judge for yourself, see Chapter 10 for the details.
Paris’s Champs-Elysées and Rome’s Via Veneto
These boulevards — world-class public living rooms where the rich and
famous went to sip coffee at a sidewalk cafe, to see and be seen — were
the talk of the town into the 1960s.
Now the Champs-Elysées that once welcomed the carriage of Catherine
de’ Medici has become Paris’s main drag for fast-food chains and movie
multiplexes. The Via Veneto of Fellini’s La Dolce Vita (the film that
coined the term paparazzi) has gone from glitterati ground zero to a
string of overpriced, internationally affiliated hotels booked only by
tour-bus companies.
The French Riviera
From a beachgoing point of view, the French Riviera is a disappointment.
Americans are used to vast expanses of glittering sand. In Europe, sand
is a precious commodity, and the beaches — sand, shingle, pebbles, or
outright rocks — are mostly private, crowded, narrow strips of shoreline
with tightly packed regiments of umbrellas and changing cabins. Come
to the Riviera for the casinos or nightlife, if that’s your sort of thing. But
don’t come for the beaches.
Madrid’s Flamenco Shows
The shows given for tourists are often of poor quality and overpriced. In
Chapter 22, you find my recommendations for some of the more authen-
tic flamenco shows, but remember that the real thing (a spontaneous
nighttime ritual) is in Andalusia.
Athens, Greece
Yes, you definitely want to see the Acropolis and the Parthenon, the
Ancient Agorá, and the National Archaeological Museum if you visit
Athens (see Chapter 24), but be forewarned that the city itself is dirty,
crowded, and boring. And getting there is no easy task — you must
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
570

spend three days of your trip traveling by train or ferry if you choose
not to fly. Exploring Greece’s fascinating interior is a much better use of
your time. Or you can island-hop for loads of fun.
Four Shopping Disappointments: The “Big
Names” in London, Paris, Rome, and Florence
Harrods was an incredible, almost unbelievable institution when it first
opened — a block-long, multilevel building packed to the gills with every
imaginable item that you may want to buy (and many that you never
thought of), all in one place. We have a term for that today: department
store. Sure, Harrods is still extraordinarily classy when compared to
even top-end chains such as Macy’s, and it has a nifty food section, but
you can actually find more variety (if not quality) these days at the Mall
of America in Minnesota.
Paris’s rue du Faubourg St-Honoré is, indeed, lined with remarkable
shops and high-end boutiques. But one of the cardinal rules of elite
shopping in Europe is that high fashion costs no less in its country of
origin (France or Italy) than it does in a New York boutique or upscale
factory outlet in the United States. This applies to the other streets men-
tioned in this section, as well as any other street and city in Europe. Yes,
buying that little black dress in Paris or leather shoes in Florence has
cachet, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that you’re coming here
for a bargain — those are found in stock shops and Europe’s outdoor
markets.
Via Condotti, the main shopping drag that shoots like an arrow from the
base of Rome’s Spanish Steps, is now home to a Foot Locker and a
Disney Store. The big names of Italian fashion (not to mention the small
“Made in Italy” boutiques) have slipped around the corners onto the
side streets and parallels of Via Condotti.
Via de’ Tornabuoni in Florence has similar problems (though Florence’s
new Foot Locker and Disney Store are actually located a couple of blocks
over on Via de’ Calzaiuoli). Aside from Ferragamo’s massive medieval
palace/flagship anchoring one end, and the original Gucci store in the
middle of it, most of the best shops — big-name or not — are not on Via
de’ Tornabuoni. Instead, they reside on tributaries and side streets such
as Via della Vigna Vecchia.
Fair warning.

T
his chapter lists ten unforgettable places where you can avoid the
tourists and see some cool sights to boot. Some of these recommen-
dations don’t appear elsewhere in this book, but all are within easy strik-
ing distance from the major cities, and we let you know where to begin
your journey in each case.
Avebury, England
Okay, so it’s not entirely unknown, but compared to Stonehenge, just 20
miles to the north, Avebury (% 01672-539-250; www.nationaltrust.
org.uk) receives perhaps 5 percent the number of visitors. Believe us, a
prehistoric circle of stones feels much more mystical without throngs of
camera-toting tourists posing around it.
But the relative lack of crowds is not the only thing that makes Avebury
so special. The Avebury circle is absolutely huge; you even find a small
village built halfway into it, with a pub, restaurant, and fine little archae-
ology museum. And unlike at Stonehenge, you can actually wander
around amid the stones.
Buses leave regularly from Salisbury station for Avebury. For details on
getting to Salisbury (and Stonehenge), see Chapter 10.
Dingle Peninsula, Ireland
Almost everyone flocking to southeastern Ireland heads out of the main
town of Killarney to ride around the famed Ring of Kerry. Far fewer know
that, just one inlet to the north, the road looping around the Dingle
Peninsula has the same sort of fishing hamlets, village pubs, ancient

ruins, and stunning vistas as the Ring of Kerry, but with almost none of
the crowds.
Getting to Killarney from Ireland’s big cities is easy. For details on visit-
ing Dingle Peninsula, see Chapter 12.
Paris’s Lesser-Known Museums
Everyone piles into Paris’s Louvre and Musée d’Orsay — and with good
reason. But Paris has more than 145 other museums, many of them
unknown to the average tourist. At the beautiful little Musée Rodin, 77
rue de Varenne (% 01-44-18-61-10; www.musee-rodin.fr), castings of
Rodin’s greatest works fill the rooms, while his Thinker ponders in the
lush garden. Or you can search out the Musée National du Moyen Age
(Museum of the Middle Ages), 6 place Paul Painlevé (% 01-53-73-78-00;
www.musee-moyenage.fr), installed in the remains of a bathhouse built
almost 2,000 years ago during the city’s Roman era.
The Marais’s Musée Carnavalet, 23 rue de Sévigné (% 01-44-59-58-58;
www.carnavalet.paris.fr), is dedicated to the history of Paris. The
Musée Marmottan Monet, 2 rue Louis-Boilly (% 01-44-96-50-33; www.
marmottan.com), on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne woods, houses
Monet’s Impression, Sol Levant, the painting the title of which was taken to
coin the term Impressionism. And don’t leave out the Musée Picasso, 5 rue
de Thorigny (% 01-42-71-25-21; www.musee-picasso.fr), or the Musée
de l’Orangerie, just off place de la Concorde (% 01-44-77-80-07; www.
musee-orangerie.fr), with its 360-degree painting of Waterlilies by
Monet. For more about the Musée Rodin and Musée Picasso, see 
Chapter 13.
Hoge Veluwe Park, Netherlands
At this large national park outside Arnhem, you can borrow a bike for
free and ride around the park’s many roads and trails, exploring a micro-
cosm of the many environments of the Netherlands, from sand dunes to
forests to meadows to formal gardens. Make sure that you stop into the
Kröller-Müller Museum, a fantastic and underrated gallery of modern art
in the middle of the park. It features more than 270 works by van Gogh
and hundreds of other works by 20th-century and contemporary artists,
plus one of the most beautiful outdoor sculpture gardens in the world.
For more about the park, see Chapter 14.
The Heuriger of Grinzig, Austria
If you ride Vienna’s no. 38 trolley out to the end of the line, you arrive at
the edge of the fabled Vienna Woods in the wine hamlet of Grinzig. Here,
almost every block is home to a different heurige, a small vineyard that
Chapter 26: Ten Overlooked Gems 573

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
574
produces limited quantities of white wine and will serve some to you,
along with platters of roast sausages, dumplings, goulash, pastries, and
other hearty Austrian dishes. You can enjoy your feast under aged,
wood-beamed ceilings or, in warm weather, in wine gardens crowded by
locals. For more about Austria, see Chapter 16.
Ostia Antica, Italy
At the crack of dawn each morning in Rome, lines of tour buses set out
for a long day trip to Pompeii. Take our advice and sleep late, and then
take the B metro line for a less-than-an-hour trip to another excavated
ancient city called Ostia Antica, near the Italian shore.
In Ostia Antica, the cracked mosaic pavements and crumbling brick
walls of 1,800-year-old houses, shops, and public buildings flutter with
wildflowers; weeds grow in the flagstone roads; and the headless statues
lean nonchalantly amid tall grasses as if simply forgotten. And that’s
what the town was — forgotten — as the empire fell, the coast receded,
and malaria infested the area. Explore it all here: abandoned temples, an
empty theater and amphitheater, windswept streets, and the broken
remains of wealthy villas, simple flour mills, and public bathhouses. For
more about day trips from Rome, see Chapter 19.
Venetian Islands, Italy
Glorious St. Mark’s Basilica, the pink-and-white Doge’s Palace, the
Carnival mask makers — the touristy side of Venice is all fine and well,
but for a more authentic experience — and a slower pace — head to a
series of smaller islands strung throughout the vast Venetian lagoon.
Hop a vaporetto (one of the ferries that serve as Venice’s public buses)
and in half an hour you can chug out to bustling Murano, where the art
of Venetian glass-blowing was born and its main factories still reside.
After wandering its canals and poking into its marvelous Byzantine/
Renaissance churches, continue on to the islet of Burano, a fishing vil-
lage of brightly colored houses and tiny boats bobbing in the little
canals, where lace making is the local specialty.
Another vaporetto leaves from here to carry you to isolated Torcello,
where the earliest lagoon settlement was established (older than Venice
itself). Now all that’s left are a few houses, a scraggly vineyard, and a
Byzantine cathedral with a tipsy bell tower and gorgeous, glittering
mosaics carpeting the apse and the entrance wall. The island is also the
improbable home to Locanda Cipriani, a refined restaurant (same
owners as Venice’s Harry’s Bar) that Hemingway used to frequent.
Headed back to Venice proper on the last vaporetto, the sun setting over
the lagoon, you now know how Venice lives outside the tourist trade.
For more on visiting the islands of Venice, see Chapter 21.

Chapter 26: Ten Overlooked Gems 575
Arena Chapel, Padova, Italy
At the start of the 14th century, Giotto, a shepherd turned Gothic painter,
kick-started the artistic revolution that would eventually flower into the
Renaissance. His famous frescoes in Assisi attract plenty of visitors, but
few people visit this beautiful chapel, covered almost from floor to ceiling
with the master’s vibrant painting, in Padova, just a 20-minute train ride
from Venice. For details on visiting Padova, see Chapter 21.
Spain — All of It
Spain spent much of the last century under a dictatorship, so it didn’t
end up on most tourist itineraries. Although the backpackers are slowly
rediscovering it, and in summer the Brits flock to the coastal resorts,
Spain is still woefully overlooked by most travelers — their loss.
This country’s rich history and heritage of Celtic, Roman, Moorish,
Basque, and other influences make it one of the most diverse and cultur-
ally dense nations in Europe. Madrid is stuffed with museums, and
Barcelona is an eminently livable city where life centers on a parklike
pedestrian boulevard that runs through the very heart of town.
But if you have to pick one region to explore, choose the southlands of
Andalusia (www.andalucia.org), full of genteel Moorish castles,
Christian cathedrals, medieval quarters, Renaissance and baroque
palaces and churches, and whitewashed villages. Bullfights, flamenco
dancing, and fine sherries all hail originally from Andalusia, and there’s
nowhere better to experience life a l’Española than in the cities of
Seville, Granada, and Córdoba; the hill towns northeast of Jerez (home
of sherry); and the beaches of the Costa del Sol around Málaga.
For details on Madrid and Barcelona, see Chapters 22 and 23, respectively.
Medieval Hamlets and Hill Towns
If you want to turn back the clock and see villages and small towns
where the leisurely pace of life has helped keep the winding stone
streets in a veritable time capsule, Europe is the place to go. And many
of these, dare we call them “quaint,” old villages are just a short bus or
train ride outside major cities.
San Gimignano, in Tuscany, bristles with 14 medieval stone towers just
a hop, skip, and a jump from Florence (see Chapter 20). Chartres, with
its glorious Gothic cathedral, is just an hour from Paris on the train (see
Chapter 13). Salisbury and its massive Gothic cathedral is a similar easy
day trip from London (see Chapter 10). Toledo once the capital of
Castille, is today a bright, oversize village full of El Greco paintings that’s
an easy day’s jaunt out from Madrid (see Chapter 22).

The hamlets high in the Lauterbrunnen Valley of the Swiss Alps are 
centuries away in attitude from the grand business-capital cities of
Switzerland, and even from the busy and modernized resort town of
Interlaken at the valley’s mouth (see Chapter 17). And the tidy Tyrolean
town of Innsbruck nestles its medieval alleyways and baroque facades
amid the Austrian Alps, halfway between Vienna and Munich, making for
a perfect stop between the two cities (see Chapter 16).

Ten Ways to Break Out of
the Tourist Mold

S
ometimes it pays to be less touristy when you travel to foreign
countries. We take our inspiration from Michael Palin in his BBC
series Around the World in 80 Days; when he arrived in Venice, he
decided to cruise the canals . . . in a Venetian garbage scow.
To enjoy the “real” Europe, do something other than what all the other
travel books recommend. You’ll be rewarded with a unique experience
that travelers who stick solely to the major sights never have. Here are
our suggestions for finding the road less traveled.
Do as the Locals Do
Find out how the locals live by exploring their neighborhoods. Be the
first on your block to discover the upscale but thoroughly untouristy
17th arrondissement in Paris. Regale your friends back home with tales
from London’s Clerkenwell, where you can still have beer with breakfast
and see the spot where Braveheart was executed outside Smithfield meat
market; or London’s East End, where amid the immigrant families work-
ing to achieve the good life, you can still find pockets of proud working-
class Londoners speaking genuine Cockney. Or wander Rome’s Parioli
district, where you can admire the funky architecture and join the well-
heeled matrons strolling down to the cafe in their de rigueur fur coats.
Drink coffee (or something stronger) with the regulars in the corner bar.
Sit on the edge of one of those seemingly endless daily games of cards,
backgammon, or bocce ball, watching carefully to get an idea of how the
game is played. One of the grizzled old men may eventually gesture you

over, and everyone will get a kick out of trying to pantomime to the for-
eigner the rules of the game as you proceed to lose spectacularly.
Find that local version of Wal-Mart or Target and just wander the aisles,
checking out the daily essentials of the French or the Austrians, for
example; as a souvenir, pick up a brand of toothpaste you’ve never
heard of. If you’re a music fan, wander into a European music store,
most of which have listening stations. Pick up a CD by what seems to be
the hottest native pop group.
Take a Dip in Bern’s Aare River
Few capital cities in the world have river water that’s actually clean
enough for swimming; Bern (see Chapter 17) is proud to be one of them.
On warm summer days, the locals troop partway upstream, jump in, and
let the surprisingly swift current float them downriver into the heart of
town, where a public bathing complex awaits. Upon arrival, they clam-
ber out and relax poolside or hike 20 minutes back up the tree-shaded
path to jump back in the river.
Rent an Apartment or Villa
Instead of staying at several hotels in different cities or towns, pick a city
or region to explore more fully and rent an apartment or villa. If you
choose a small town or a place in the country, rent a car and settle down to
life, European-style. Not only can you save money, but you’ll also become a
temporary native of sorts. Become a “regular” at the cafe on the corner
and the little grocery store down the street. Get to know your neighbors;
maybe they’ll share a family recipe with you. You may enjoy the lifestyle so
much that you find yourself pausing at the windows of local real estate
agents to peruse the offerings and check on property values.
Visit a Small Private Museum
You wouldn’t believe the places you can find where wealthy collectors
left behind dusty old mansions jumbled with valuable bric-a-brac ranging
from Ming vases and Roman reliefs to medieval suits of armor and occa-
sional paintings by Renaissance masters. Although few of the individual
pieces, or the collections as a whole, tend to be first rate, they offer fasci-
nating insights into one man’s or one family’s tastes and styles — and as
often as not these places are preserved exactly as the collector left them
in 1754 or 1892 or whenever, and as such offer a glimpse into the lives
and times of a different era.
And before you pooh-pooh the idea of a private collection, remember
the names of a few larger ones installed in the personal residences of
Europe’s richest past collectors: the Louvre (the French monarchs’ 
collection in their city palace), the Uffizi (the Medicis’ artwork installed
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
578

in their old office building), and the Vatican (the pope’s best heirlooms
in his private digs).
Jog with the Locals
Europeans may not be as exercise-driven as your modern North American
(they walk more and get their exercise as part of their daily lives), but the
concept of a good cardio workout seems to be catching on here. Find out
where the locals jog, and join them for a morning (or evening) run. You
can clear your head, explore a city park or two, and maybe make some
new friends.
Hike in the Countryside
Leave the crowds of the big city behind, and explore the country on foot.
Buy the best, most detailed, small-scale map you can find that shows all
the unpaved roads and trails (if any). The tourist offices of most smaller
towns can help you out with maps, and sometimes even itineraries, or
they can point you toward the local trekking group. A few cities are so
small (Florence comes to mind) that you can start many country walks
right outside your doorstep — or from the end of a local bus line.
Catch a Football (Soccer) Match
In Europe, football (known as soccer in the U.S.) is like packing all the
cheers, joys, agonies, and devoted fandom of American baseball, foot-
ball, basketball, and hockey into one sport and one season. Except for a
few oddball games — cricket in England or hurling in Ireland — this is
the only sport that most Europeans follow, making it a close second to
Christianity as the national religion in each country.
Find out when the big match takes place (often Sun) and where the die-
hard fans of the home team sit in the stadium. Then get a seat near them
and root, root, root for the home team (unless you seem to be seated
amid fans of the opposing team, in which case scream your bloody lungs
out for the visitors). Just avoid any obvious hooligans and any sign that
a brawl’s about to break out.
Pick Grapes or Olives
During harvest seasons, you’re bound to see people out working their
fields or small plots. Often, they’re more than happy to accept any help
you offer, and you can spend a day picking grapes or olives — both of
which are a lot harder on your fingers and, in the case of grapes, your
back, than you may imagine. But the experience can be fun, and you may
even get to pass around the wine bottle with the farmers during breaks.
Chapter 27: Ten Ways to Break Out of the Tourist Mold 579

Watch Some Local Television Programs
Watching TV in Europe doesn’t make you a couch potato. Tell your
friends that you’re having a cultural experience! You may be amazed by
what they put on TV in other countries — a whole lot more nudity, for
one thing. Plus, you get awful slapstick comedies (which are pretty easy
to follow in any language), oddball game shows, and commercials for
chewing gum or spring water — and you can discover that Bart Simpson
is a beloved bad boy in just about every country.
Liberate Yourself from Your Guidebook
Once in a while, stow away this and any other guidebooks you may
have. Check out sights and restaurants without following our advice. If
the bistro is cheap and full of French patrons, chances are, it’s good.
Wander into a church without even checking to see if it’s listed in your
book and admire the baroque altarpiece and paintings for their aesthetic
value alone, not because you know someone famous made them.
Try a dish that your menu translator doesn’t cover. (Okay, that can be
risky, but if the locals are willing to eat it, it probably isn’t poison —
just don’t hold us responsible if it involves more tentacles than you’re
comfortable with.) Enjoy the thrill of discovery! Turn tourism into
travel and your vacation into an adventure. The memories will be 
more than worth it.

Where to Get More Information
National tourist boards exist to help you plan a trip to their country. If
you e-mail or call, they’ll gladly send you a big envelope stuffed with
brochures and information packets. Many of them are helpful enough to
address specific questions and concerns you may have. Even more
useful are their Web sites, which are loaded with country-specific infor-
mation and links to other sites.
That said, take any mailing from a tourist office with a grain of salt. Most
of the material is promotional literature and always puts the best spin
possible on every aspect of the country. Read between the lines and rely
on a quality, impartial, third-party guidebook (like this one!) for the real,
opinionated scoop on the local scene.
For local tourist boards, see the “Fast Facts” sections of Chapters 10
through 24. These offices can also send you tons of useful information —
but again, view these materials with a critical eye.
