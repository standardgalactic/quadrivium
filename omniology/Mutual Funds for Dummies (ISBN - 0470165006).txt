About the Author
Eric Tyson, MBA, is a best-selling author and syndicated columnist. Through
his counseling, writing, and teaching, he teaches people to manage their per-
sonal finances better and successfully direct their own investments.
He has been involved in the investing markets in many capacities for the past
two decades. Eric first invested in mutual funds back in the mid-1970s, when
he opened a mutual fund account at Fidelity. With the assistance of Dr. Martin
Zweig, a now-famous investment market analyst and frequent guest on PBS’s
Wall Street Week, Eric won his high school’s science fair for a project on what
influences the stock market!
Since that time, Eric has (among other things) worked as a management 
consultant to Fortune 500 financial service firms, and earned his Bachelor’s
degree in economics at Yale and an MBA at the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. Despite these handicaps to clear thinking, he had the good sense 
to start his own company, which took an innovative approach to teaching
people of all economic means about investing and money.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of 
the national bestsellers Personal Finance For Dummies and Investing For
Dummies, co-author of Home Buying For Dummies and Taxes For Dummies,
and was an award-winning columnist for the San Francisco Examiner. His
work has been featured and quoted in dozens of national and local publica-
tions, including Newsweek, The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, Kiplinger’s
Personal Finance Magazine, the Los Angeles Times, and Bottom Line/Personal;
and on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN,
Fox News, CBS national radio, Bloomberg Business Radio, and Business Radio
Network. He’s also been a featured speaker at a White House conference on
retirement planning.
Despite his “wealth” of financial knowledge, Eric is one of the rest of us. He
maintains a large inventory of bumble-bee colored computer books on his
desk for those frequent times when his computer makes the (decreasing
amount of) hair on his head fall out.


Dedication
To my wife, Judy; my family — especially my parents, Charles and Paulina;
my friends; and to my counseling clients and students of my courses for
teaching me how to teach them about managing their finances.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Many people contribute to the birth of a book, and this book is no exception.
First, I owe a deep debt of gratitude to James Collins, who inspired me when 
I was a young and impressionable business school student. Jim encouraged
me to try to improve some small part of the business world by being an
entrepreneur and focusing solely on what customers needed rather than 
on what made the quickest buck.
The technical reviewer for this book was Roy Weitz, CPA and founder of
www.fundalarm.com. He helped to improve each and every chapter, and 
I am thankful for that. The prior edition was reviewed by John A. Haslem,
Professor Emeritus of Finance in the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the
University of Maryland in College Park and author of Mutual Funds: Risk and
Performance Analysis for Decision Making (Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2003).
Thanks to all the good people in the media and other fields who have taken
the time to critique and praise my previous writing so that others may know
that it exists and is worth reading. And to those too lazy to open the book
just because of its bright yellow color and title I say, “Don’t judge a book by
its cover!”
And a final and heartfelt thanks to all the people on the front lines and behind
the scenes at Wiley who helped to make this book and my others a success. A
big round of applause, please, for Chad Sievers as project editor and Carrie
Burchfield as outstanding copy editor. Special thanks to Mike Baker. Thanks
also to the Composition, Graphics, Proofreading, and Indexing staff for their
great efforts in producing this book.
P.S. Thanks to you, dear reader, for buying my books.

Introduction
W
elcome to one of America’s most popular and useful resources for invest-
ing in one of America’s most popular and useful investment vehicles —
mutual funds! Whether you’re a regular reader of investing books or this is your
first, Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition, which is completely revised and
updated, provides practical and profitable techniques of mutual fund investing
that you can put to work now and for many years to come.
Mutual funds aren’t literally for dummies — in fact, they’re a wise investment
choice for people at all income and education levels. Mutual funds are invest-
ment companies that pool your money with that of thousands of other people
to create a large pool of assets that can be invested in stocks, bonds, or other
securities. Because your assets are part of a much larger whole, the best
mutual funds enable you to invest in securities that give you low-cost access
to leading professional money managers.
With good money managers investing your nest egg in top-flight investments
that match your financial goals, you can spend your time doing the activities
in life that you enjoy and are best at. Mutual funds should improve your
investment returns as well as your social life!
I practice what I preach. All my investments that I’ve devoted to securities
(stocks and bonds) are invested through mutual funds. Why? For the simple
reason that I’m confident the best fund managers that I recommend in this
book can do a superior job (higher returns, less cost) than I could by
researching and selecting individual stocks and bonds on my own.
I’ve enjoyed successfully investing in mutual funds for more than two
decades. As a financial counselor, writer, and lecturer, I’ve helped investors
make informed investing decisions with mutual funds as part of comprehen-
sive personal financial management. So I know the questions and challenges
that you face when you invest in funds. I wrote this book to answer, in plain
English, your fund-investing questions.
What’s New in This Edition
Life and the investment world change. Although the essence of what makes
mutual funds worthy of your investment dollars hasn’t changed since the last
edition of this book was published several years ago, the fund industry has
certainly seen new developments. In this newly updated fifth edition, here are
the major issues:

 Alternatives to mutual funds — exchange-traded funds, hedge funds,
researching your own stocks and bonds and creating your own fund, 
private money managers, closed-end funds, and so on 
 Opportunities and pitfalls investing in funds online with expanded and
updated coverage of Web sites and software
 New tax laws and their impact on smart fund-investing strategies
 Updates to the funds and resources that I recommend
 New sources for investment advice, especially at the major fund and 
discount brokerage companies
How This Book Is Different
Many investment books confuse folks. They present you with some newfangled
system that you never figure out how to use without the help of a mainframe
computer, several mathematicians, and a Nobel laureate as your personal
tutors. Books that bewilder more than enlighten may be intentional because
the author may have another agenda: to get you to turn your money over to
him to manage or to sell you his newsletter(s). Writers with an agenda may
imply — and sometimes say — that you really can’t invest well, at least not
without what they’re selling.
Going another route, too many investment books glorify rather than advise.
They place on a pedestal the elite few who, during decidedly brief periods in
the history of the world and financial markets, managed to beat the market
averages by a few percentage points or so per year. Many of these books 
(and their publishers) suggest that reading them shows you the strategies
that led Superstar Money Manager of the Moment to the superlative perfor-
mance that the book glorifies. “He did it his way; now you can, too,” trumpets
the marketing material. Not so. Reading a book about what made Michael
Jordan a phenomenal basketball player, Shakespeare a great playwright, or
Henry Kissinger a successful Secretary of State won’t help you shoot a
basket, versify, or negotiate alliances like these famous folks. By the same
token, you can’t discover from a book the way to become the next Wall Street
investment wizard.
Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition, helps you avoid fund-investing pitfalls
and maximizes your chances for success. When you want to buy or sell a
mutual fund, your decision needs to fit your overall financial objectives and
individual situation. Fund investors make many mistakes in this regard. For
example, they invest in funds instead of paying off debt or tucking money
into their employer’s tax-deductible retirement savings plan. It’s also
common for investors to choose funds that don’t fit their tax situation.
2
Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition 

This book also covers pesky issues completely ignored by other mutual fund
books. For novice fund investors, simply finding and completing the correct
application form in the mountain of literature that fund companies send can
be a challenge. And if you invest in mutual funds outside of tax-sheltered
retirement accounts, you’re greeted by the inevitable headache from figuring
out how to report distributions at tax time. This book puts you on the right
path in order to avoid these problems.
The truth is, investing isn’t all that difficult — and mutual funds are the great
equalizer. There’s absolutely no reason, except perhaps a lack of time and
effort on your part, why you can’t successfully invest in mutual funds. In fact,
if you understand some basic concepts and find out how to avoid major 
mistakes that occur for some fairly obvious reasons, you can be even more
successful than most so-called investment professionals.
Foolish Assumptions
Whenever an author sits down to write a book, he has to make some assump-
tions about his audience, and I’ve made a few that may apply to you:
 You’re looking for sensible investments and are considering taking the
mutual-fund route.
 You’ve done some research (or perhaps thought about doing some) on
mutual funds and found the thousands of fund choices to be a bit daunting.
 Your investment portfolio contains or has contained mutual funds, 
and you’re looking for up-to-date information on how changes in the
economy and financial markets can affect the decisions you make.
If one or more of these descriptions rings true, you’re in the right place.
Mutual funds are a huge business, and they can be confusing. Today, thou-
sands of mutual funds account for more than $10 trillion under management.
Although the basic principle behind mutual funds sounds simple enough —
pooled money from thousands of individuals that’s invested in stocks, bonds,
or other securities — you have to understand the different types of invest-
ments, such as stocks and bonds, and the way they work.
Unfortunately, you have too many individual funds from which to choose —
hundreds of mutual fund companies, brokerage firms, insurers, banks, and so
on are selling thousands of funds. Even experienced investors suffer from
information overload. Lucky for you, I present short lists of great funds that
meet different needs.
3
Introduction

And because no investment, not even one of the better mutual funds, is free
of flaws and shortcomings, I explain how to avoid the worst funds — and the
numerous mediocre ones — that clutter the investment landscape. I also help
you understand when investing in funds may not be appropriate for you and
what your best options may be.
How This Book Is Organized
The sections that follow contain a preview, of sorts, of the various sections in
this book and what they cover.
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing 
Risks and Rewards
Part I defines and demystifies what mutual funds are and discusses what
they’re good for. Before you’re even ready to start investing in funds, your
personal finances need to be in order, so I give you some financial house-
cleaning tips. You can also discover the importance of fitting mutual funds to
your financial goals. Part I also covers how to pick great funds, how to avoid
losers (not the people, the funds), where and how to purchase funds, and
how to read all those pesky reports that fund companies tend to produce.
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds
Mutual funds are hardly the only game in town for those folks seeking some-
one to manage their money. In recent years, exchange-traded funds and
hedge funds, for example, have been pitched to many investors. Other
investors believe that they can be their own best stock and bond pickers.
This part discusses all the fund-investing alternatives and more to help you
select which option(s) are best for your situation.
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest
This part explains what makes a fund and fund company worth investing in.
You see how to read and understand common fund documents. I also explain
the best venues and avenues for buying funds and help you think through
whether to enlist the services of an adviser.

Mutual Funds For Dummies, 5th Edition 

Part IV: Establishing a 
Great Fund Portfolio
This part shows you how to build a portfolio of mutual funds to accomplish
your specific financial goals. You start off by exploring the basic strategies 
of portfolio construction. Then for each of the major fund types — money
market, bond, and stock — you get specific fund recommendations. A chap-
ter of sample fund portfolios based on real-life scenarios brings together the
important concepts in this section. Last but not least, I cover how to com-
plete the often-pesky paperwork funds demand of you.
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed
In mutual fund investing, getting started is the hardest part. After you have 
a good fund portfolio up and running, you shouldn’t have to devote much
time to maintaining it. This part covers what you do need to do, including
chapters on how to evaluate your funds’ performance and deal with the tax
consequences of your investing. I also offer some tips on how to minimize
aggravations when you deal with fund companies and discount brokers.
If you’re still not full, you can find out about the scores of individuals, compa-
nies, and publications that rank and predict financial market gyrations. I 
warn you about the bad ones and the dangers of blindly following gurus, and
I reveal which, if any, of them really are gurus. You also discover how to use
the best mutual fund information sources, how to tell the difference between
good and bad newsletters, and where to turn for more information. You may
want to know how to use your computer to track and even invest in mutual
funds online — so this part tells you how to do that, too.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Broaden your thinking with these chapters that offer ten or more ideas about
important fund issues and concepts. I discuss common fund-investing mis-
takes made by investors, ease some fund-investing fears that you may have,
and cover issues to consider before hiring an adviser. In the appendix, you
find the contact information for all the top-notch funds I recommend.

Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you can find friendly and useful icons that enhance
your reading pleasure and flag special types of information. So, when you
meet one of these margin-hugging doodads, consider the following:
This icon points out something that can save you time, headaches, money, or
all of the above!
The warning icon helps steer you away from mistakes and boo-boos that
others have made when investing in mutual funds.
Something around here could really cost you big bucks (maybe even an arm
and a leg!) if you don’t devote your attention to these icons.
This icon denotes Eric’s favorite mutual funds.
Eminently skippable stuff here, but if you don’t read it, you may not seem as
astute at the next cocktail party when mutual fund trivia games begin. Neat
but nonessential stuff — read at your leisure.
Eric’s told me as much as he can, but he thinks that I may need or want to
check it out more on my own before I make a move.
This icon designates something important that I want you to make sure you
don’t forget when you’re making your own fund-investing decisions!
Where to Go from Here
You don’t need to read this book cover to cover. But if you’re a beginner or
you want to fully immerse yourself in the world of fund investing, go for it!
However, you may have a specific question or two today, and you’ll want
some other information tomorrow. No problem there, either. Mutual Funds For
Dummies, 5th Edition, is lighter on its feet and easier to use than other fund
reference books. Use the Table of Contents or the Index to speed your way
toward what you need to know and get on with your life.

Chapter 1
Making More Money, 
Taking Less Risk
In This Chapter
 Defining mutual funds
 Understanding investments
 Weighing your options
 Seeing the big picture: Returns, risks, and risk reduction
I
n my years of work as a financial adviser and a columnist answering many
readers’ questions, I’ve seen the same, avoidable mistakes being made over
and over. Often, these investing mistakes occurred for one simple reason: a
lack of investment understanding. People didn’t know what their investing
options were and why particular options were inferior or superior to others.
By reading this book, you can prevent yourself from making investment mis-
takes. And you can take advantage of an excellent investment vehicle: mutual
funds — the best of which offer you diversification, which reduces your risks,
and low-cost access to outstanding money managers, who boost your
returns. And you do this in the context of your overall financial plans and
goals. This chapter gives you an investment overview so you can see how
mutual funds fit into the overall investment world.
Introducing Mutual Funds
If you already understand stocks and bonds, their risks and potential returns,
and the benefits of diversification, terrific. You can skip this chapter. Most
people, however, don’t really comprehend investment basics, which is one 
of the major reasons why people make investment mistakes in the first place.
After you understand the specific types of securities (stocks, bonds, and so
on) that funds can invest in, you’ve mastered one of the important building
blocks to understanding mutual funds. A mutual fund is a vehicle that holds

other investments: When you invest in a mutual fund, you’re contributing to a
big pile of money that a mutual fund manager uses to buy other investments,
such as stocks, bonds, and/or other assets that meet the fund’s investment
criteria.
Differences in investment criteria are how mutual funds broadly categorize
themselves, like the way an automaker labels a car a sedan or a sport utility
vehicle. This label helps you, the buyer, have a general picture of the product
even before you see the specifics. On the dealer’s lot, the salesmen take for
granted that you know what sedan and sport utility vehicle mean. But what if
the salesman asks you whether you want a Pegasus or a Stegosaurus? If you
don’t know what those names mean, how can you decide?
Mutual fund terms, such as municipal bond fund or small-cap stock fund, are
thrown around too casually. Fact is, thanks to our spending-oriented culture,
the average American knows car models a lot better than types of mutual
funds! In this chapter (and in Chapter 2), I explain the investment and mutual
fund terms and concepts that many writers assume you already know (or
perhaps that they don’t understand well enough themselves to explain to
you). But don’t take the plunge into mutual funds until you determine your
overall financial needs and goals.
Making Sense of Investments
Your eyes can perceive dozens of different colors, and hundreds, if not thou-
sands, of shades in between. In fact, you can see so many colors that you can
easily forget what you discovered back in your early school days — that all
colors are based on some combination of the three primary colors: red, blue,
and yellow. Well, believe it or not, the world of investments is even simpler
than that. The seemingly infinite number of investments out there is based on
just two primary kinds of investments: lending investments and ownership
investments.
Lending investments: Interest 
on your money
Lending is a type of investment in which the lender charges the borrower 
a fee (generally known as interest) until the original loan (typically known 
as the principal) gets paid back. Familiar lending investments include bank
certificates of deposit (CDs), United States (U.S.) Treasury bills, and bonds
10
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

issued by corporations, such as Ford. In each case, you’re lending your
money to an organization — the bank, the federal government, or a 
company — that pays you an agreed-upon rate of interest. You’re also
promised that your principal (the original amount that you loaned) will be
returned to you in full on a specific date.
The best thing that can happen with a lending investment is that you’re paid
all the interest in addition to your original investment, as promised. Although
getting your original investment back with the promised interest won’t make
you rich, this result isn’t bad, given that the investment landscape is littered
with the carcasses of failed investments that return you nothing — including
lunch money loans that you never see repaid!
Lending investments have several drawbacks:
 You may not get everything you were promised. Under extenuating 
circumstances, promises get broken. When a company goes bankrupt,
for example, you can lose all or part of your original investment.
 You get what you were promised, but because of the ravages of infla-
tion, your money is simply worth less than you expected it to be worth.
Your money has less purchasing power than you thought it would. Way
back in the 1960s, for example, high-quality (that is, “safe”) companies
were issuing long-term bonds that paid approximately 4 percent interest.
At the time, such bonds seemed like a good investment because the cost
of living was increasing only 2 percent a year. But when inflation rocketed
to 6, 8, and then 10 percent and higher, those 4 percent bonds didn’t look
quite so attractive.
Suppose that you put $5,000 into an 18-year lending investment that
yielded 4 percent. You planned to use it in 18 years to pay for one year 
of college. Although a year of college cost $5,000 when you invested the
money, college costs rose 8 percent a year; so in 18 years when you needed
the money, one year of college cost nearly $20,000. But your investment,
yielding just 4 percent, would only be worth around $10,100 — nearly 50
percent short of the cost of college.
 You don’t share in the success of the organization to which you lend
your money. If the company doubles or triples in size and profits, the
growth is good for the company and its owners. As a bondholder
(lender), you’re sure to get your interest and principal back, but you
don’t reap any of the rewards. If Bill Gates had approached you many
years ago for money to help make computer software, would you rather
have loaned him the money or owned a piece of the company?
11
Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

Ownership investments: More 
potential profit (and risk)
You’re an owner when you purchase an asset, whether a building or part of a
multinational corporation, that has the ability to generate earnings or profits.
Real estate and stock are common ownership investments.
Ownership investments can generate profits in two ways:
 Through the investment’s own cash flow: For example, as the owner of
a duplex you derive rental income from tenants. If you own stock in a
corporation, many companies elect to pay out a portion of their annual
profits (in the form of a dividend).
 Through appreciation in the value of the investment: When you own a
piece of real estate in an area with a healthy economy or you own stock
in a growing company, your investment should increase in value over
time. If and when you sell the investment, the difference between what
you sold it for and what you paid for it is your (pre-tax) profit. (The IRS,
of course, will eventually expect its share of your investment profits.)
This potential for appreciation is the big advantage of being an owner
versus a lender.
On the downside, ownership investments may come with extra responsibili-
ties. If the heater goes out or the plumbing springs a leak, you, as the prop-
erty owner, are the one who must fix and pay for it while your tenant gets 
to kick back in his recliner watching football games and guzzling beer. And
you’re the one who must pay for insurance to protect yourself against risks,
such as fire damage or accidents that occur on your property.
Moreover, where the potential for appreciation exists, the potential for depre-
ciation also exists. Ownership investments can decline in value. Real estate
markets can slump, stock markets can crash, and individual companies can
go belly up. For this reason, ownership investments tend to be riskier than
lending investments.
Surveying the Major Investment Options
When you understand that fundamentally only two kinds of investments —
ownership and lending — exist, you can more easily understand how a spe-
cific investment works . . . and whether it’s an attractive choice to help you
achieve your specific goals.
12
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Which investment vehicle you choose for a specific goal depends on where
you’re going, how fast you want to get there, and what risks you’re willing to
take. Here’s an inventory of investment vehicles to choose from, along with
my thoughts on which vehicle would be a good choice for your situation.
Savings and money market accounts
You can find savings and money market accounts at banks; money market
funds are available through mutual fund companies. All are lending invest-
ments based on short-term loans and are about the safest in terms of risk 
to your investment among the various lending investments around. Relative
to the typical returns on growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, the
interest rate (also known as the yield) paid on savings and money market
accounts is low but doesn’t fluctuate as much over time. (The interest rate 
on savings and money market accounts generally fluctuates as the level of
overall market interest rates changes.)
Bank savings accounts are backed by an independent agency of the federal
government through Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insur-
ance. If the bank goes broke, you still get your money back (up to $100,000).
Money market funds, however, aren’t insured.
Should you prefer a bank account because your investment (principal) is
insured? No. Savings accounts and money market funds have almost equiva-
lent safety, but money market funds tend to offer higher yields. Chapter 10
provides more background on money market funds.
Bonds
Bonds are the most common lending investment traded on securities mar-
kets. Bond funds also account for about 15 percent of all mutual fund assets
invested. When issued, a bond includes a specified maturity date — the date
when your principal is repaid. Also specified when a bond is issued is the
interest rate, which is typically fixed (meaning it doesn’t change over time).
Bonds, therefore, can fluctuate in value with changes in interest rates. If, for
example, you’re holding a bond issued at 5 percent and rates increase to 7
percent, your bond decreases in value. Why would anyone want to buy your
bond at the price that you paid if it yields just 5 percent and she can get a
similar bond yielding 7 percent somewhere else? (See Chapter 11 for more.)
13
Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

Bonds differ from each other in the following ways:
 The type of institution to which you’re lending your money:
Institutions include state and local governments (municipal bonds), 
the federal government (treasuries), mortgage holders (Government
National Mortgage Association, or GNMA), and corporations (corporate
bonds). Foreign governments or corporations can also issue bonds. The
taxability of the interest paid by a bond is tied to the type of entity issu-
ing the bond. Corporate, mortgage, and foreign government bond inter-
est is fully taxable. Interest on government bonds issued by U.S. entities
is usually free of state and/or federal income tax.
 The credit quality of the borrower to whom you lend your money:
The probability that a borrower will pay you the interest and return your
entire principal on schedule varies from institution to institution. Bonds
issued by less-creditworthy institutions tend to pay higher yields to
compensate investors for the greater risk of losing some or the entire
amount invested.
 The length of maturity of the bond: Short-term bonds mature in a few
years, intermediate bonds in around 5 to 10 years, and long-term bonds
within 30 years. Longer-term bonds generally pay higher yields but fluc-
tuate more widely in value with changes in interest rates.
Stocks
Stocks are the most common ownership investment traded on securities mar-
kets. They represent shares of ownership in a company. Companies that sell
stock to the general public (called publicly held companies) include automo-
bile manufacturers, computer software producers, hotels, Internet compa-
nies, magazine and newspaper publishers, restaurant chains, supermarkets,
wineries, zipper manufacturers, and many types of other (legal) businesses!
When you hold stock in a company, you share in the company’s profits in the
form of annual dividends (although some companies don’t pay dividends) as
well as an increase (you hope) in the stock price if the company grows and
makes increasing profits. That’s what happens when all is going well. The
downside is that if the company’s business declines, your stock can plummet
or even go to $0 per share. Besides occupying different industries, companies
also vary in size. In the financial press, you often hear companies referred to
by their market capitalization, which is the total value of their outstanding
stock. This is what the stock market and the investors who participate in it
think a company is worth.
14
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

You can choose from two very different ways to invest in bonds and stocks.
You can purchase individual securities, or you can invest in a portfolio of
securities through a mutual fund. I discuss stock mutual funds in Chapter 12
and individual securities (and other alternatives to mutual funds) in Part II.
Overseas investments
Overseas investment is a potentially misleading category. The types of over-
seas investment options, such as stocks and bonds and real estate, aren’t 
fundamentally different from your domestic options. However, overseas
investments are often categorized separately because they come with their
own set of risks and rewards.
Here are some good reasons to invest overseas:
 Diversification: International securities markets don’t move in lock step
with U.S. markets, so adding foreign investments to a domestic portfolio
offers you a smoother ride.
 Growth potential: When you confine your investing to U.S. securities,
you’re literally missing a world of opportunities. The majority of invest-
ment opportunities are overseas. If you look at the total value of all
stocks and bonds outstanding worldwide, the value of U.S. securities 
is now in the minority. The U.S. isn’t the world — numerous overseas
economies are growing faster.
Some people hesitate to invest in overseas securities because they feel that
doing so hurts the U.S. economy and contributes to a loss of U.S. jobs. Fair
enough. But I have two counterarguments:
 If you don’t profit from the growth of economies overseas, someone else
will. If money is to be made there, Americans may as well make some of it.
 The U.S. already participates in a global economy — making a distinc-
tion between U.S. companies and foreign companies is no longer appro-
priate. Many companies headquartered in the U.S. also have overseas
operations. Some U.S. firms derive a large portion of their revenue and
profits from their international divisions. Conversely, many firms based
overseas also have operations in the U.S. Increasing numbers of compa-
nies are worldwide operations.

Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

You aren’t unpatriotic if you buy from a company that’s based overseas or
that has a foreign name. In fact, the product that you thought was foreign-
made may be made in the U.S. Profits from a foreign company are distributed
to all stockholders, no matter where they live. Dividends and stock price
appreciation recognize no national boundaries!
Real estate
Perhaps the most fundamental of ownership investments, real estate has
made many people wealthy. Not only does real estate produce consistently
good rates of return (averaging around 8 to 10 percent per year) over long
investment periods, but also it can be purchased with borrowed money. This
leverage helps enhance your rate of return when real estate prices are rising.
As with other ownership investments, the value of real estate depends on the
health and performance of the economy, as well as on the specifics of the
property that you own:
 If the local economy grows and more jobs are being produced at higher
wages, real estate should do well.
 If companies in the community are laying people off left and right, and
excess housing is sitting vacant because of previous overbuilding, rents
and property values are likely to fall.
For investors who have time, patience, and capital, real estate can make
sense as part of an investment portfolio — check out Real Estate Investing For
Dummies (Wiley), which I coauthored. If you don’t want the headaches that
come with purchasing and maintaining a property, you can buy mutual funds
that invest in real estate properties (see Chapter 12).
Precious metals
Gold and silver have been used by many civilizations as mediums of
exchange. One advantage of using precious metals as currency is that the
government can’t debase them. With a paper-based currency, such as the U.S.
dollar, the government can always print more currency to pay off its debts.
(Gold is much harder to make than paper money. Just ask Rumpelstiltskin!)
This process of casually printing more and more currency can lead to a cur-
rency’s devaluation — and to our old friend, inflation.
16
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Holdings of gold and silver can provide a so-called hedge against inflation. 
In the U.S. during the late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation rose dramatically.
This rise depressed stocks and bonds. Gold and silver, however, soared in
value, rising more than 500 percent (even after adjusting for inflation) from
1972 to 1981. Looking back over the last two centuries, however, the change
in the market value of precious metals has just kept up with the rate of infla-
tion. In other words, the rate of return from precious metals has been signifi-
cantly less than that from stocks and bonds in general.
Don’t purchase precious metals futures contracts. Futures aren’t investments;
they’re short-term gambles on which way prices of an underlying investment
(in this case, gold or silver) may head over a short period of time. You also
should stay away from firms and shops that sell coins and bullion (not the
soup, but bars of gold or silver). Even if you can find a legitimate firm (which
isn’t an easy task), storing and insuring gold and silver is costly. You don’t get
good value for your money.
Gold and silver can help to diversify a portfolio, but if you want to invest in
precious metals, you’re wise to do so through mutual funds. For more infor-
mation about determining how these types of funds may fit with the rest of
your investments and how to buy them, be sure to read Chapter 12.
Annuities
Annuities are investment products with some tax and insurance twists. 
They behave like savings accounts, except that they should give you slightly
higher yields, and insurance companies back them. As with other types of
retirement accounts, the money that you put into an annuity compounds
without taxation until withdrawal. However, unlike most other types of retire-
ment accounts — 401(k)s, SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs — an annuity gives you no
upfront tax deductions for your contributions.
Annuities also charge relatively high fees. That’s why it makes sense to 
consider contributing to an annuity after you fully fund the tax-deductible
retirement accounts that are available to you. The best annuities available
today are distributed by no-load (commission-free) mutual fund companies.
For more information about the best annuities and situations for which annu-
ities may be appropriate, be sure to read Chapter 13.
17
Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

Life insurance
Some insurance agents love to sell cash-value life insurance. That’s because
these policies that combine life insurance protection with an account that has
a cash value — usually known as universal, whole, or variable life policies —
generate big commissions for the agents who sell them.
Cash-value life insurance isn’t a good investment vehicle. First, you should be
saving and investing as much as possible through tax-deductible retirement
savings plans, such as 401(k)s, IRAs, and Keoghs. Contributions to a cash-
value life insurance plan provide you no upfront tax benefit. Second, you can
earn better investment returns through efficiently managed mutual funds that
you invest in outside of a life policy.
The only reason to consider cash-value life insurance is that the proceeds
paid to your beneficiaries can be free of estate taxes. Especially in light of
recent years’ tax law changes, you need to have a substantial estate at your
death to benefit from this feature. Under current tax laws, you can pass on $2
million free of federal estate taxes (this amount rises to $3.5 million by 2009).
Through the use of bypass trusts, married couples can pass along double
these amounts. And, by giving away money to your heirs while you’re still
alive, you can protect even more of your nest egg from the federal estate
taxes. (Term life insurance is best for the vast majority of people. Because
this isn’t a book on insurance, please consult the latest edition of my book,
Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley), which has all sorts of
good stuff on insurance and other important personal finance issues.)
Don’t fall prey to life insurance agents and their sales pitches. You shouldn’t
use life insurance as an investment, especially if you haven’t exhausted your
ability to contribute to retirement accounts. (Even if you’ve exhausted con-
tributing to retirement accounts, you can do better than cash-value life insur-
ance by choosing tax-friendly mutual funds and/or variable annuities that use
mutual funds; see Chapters 10 through 13 for the details.)
Limited partnerships
Avoid limited partnerships (LPs) sold directly through brokers and financial
planners. They are inferior investment vehicles. That’s not to say that no one
has ever made money on them, but LPs are so burdened with high sales com-
missions and investment-depleting management fees that you can do better
with other vehicles.
18
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

LPs invest in real estate and a variety of businesses. They pitch that you can
get in on the ground floor of a new investment opportunity and make big
money. Usually, they also tell you that while your investment is growing at 20
percent or more per year, you’ll get handsome dividends of 8 percent or so
per year. It sounds too good to be true because it is.
Many of the yields on LPs have turned out to be bogus. In some cases, part-
nerships propped up their yields by paying back investors’ principals (with-
out telling them, of course). The other hook with LPs is tax benefits. What
few loopholes that did exist in the tax code for LPs have largely been closed.
The other problems with LPs overwhelm any small tax advantage, anyway.
The investment salesperson who sells LPs stands to earn a commission of up
to 10 percent or more. That means that only 90 cents (or less) per dollar that
you put into an LP actually gets invested. Each year, LPs typically siphon 
off 2 percent or more of your money for management and other expenses.
Efficient, no-load mutual funds, in contrast, put 100 percent of your capital 
to work (thanks to no commissions) and charge 1 percent per year or less 
in operating fees.
Most LPs have little or no incentive to control costs. In fact, they may have 
a conflict of interest that leads them to charge more to enrich the managing
partners. And, unlike mutual funds, in LPs you can’t vote with your feet. If 
the partnership is poorly run and expensive, you’re stuck. That’s why LPs are
called illiquid — you can’t withdraw your money until the partnership is liqui-
dated, typically seven to ten years after you buy in. (If you want to sell out to
a third party in the interim, you have to sell at a huge discount. Don’t bother
unless you’re totally desperate for cash.)
The only thing limited about an LP is its ability to make you money. If you
want to make investments that earn you healthy returns, stick with stocks
(using mutual funds), real estate, or your own business.
Reviewing Important Investing Concepts
If you reviewed the beginning of this chapter, you have the fundamental
building blocks of the investing world. Of course, as the title of this book 
suggests, I focus on a convenient and efficient way to put it all together —
mutual funds. But before doing that, this section reviews some key investing
concepts that you continually come across as an investor.
19
Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

Getting a return: Why you invest
An investment’s return measures how much the investment has grown (or
shrunk, as the case may be). Return figures are usually quoted as a rate or
percentage that measures how much the investment’s value has changed
over a specified period of time. So if an investment has a five-year annualized
return of 8 percent, then every year for the past five years that investment,
on average, has gotten 8 percent bigger than it was the year before.
So what kind of returns can you expect from different kinds of investments? I
say “can” because I’m looking at history, and history is a record of the past.
Using history to predict the future, especially the near future, is dangerous.
History won’t exactly repeat itself, not even in the same fashion and not nec-
essarily when you expect it to.
Over the past century, ownership investments like stocks and real estate
returned around 8 to 10 percent per year, handily beating lending invest-
ments such as bonds (around 5 percent) and savings accounts (roughly 4
percent) in the investment performance race. Inflation averaged around 3
percent per year, so savings account and bond returns barely kept up with
increases in the cost of living. Factoring in the taxes that you must pay on
your investment earnings, the returns on lending investments actually didn’t
keep up with these increases. (For comparisons of various mutual funds’
returns, please see Chapter 15.)
Measuring risks: Investment volatility
Obviously, if you read the previous section, you know you should put all your
money in stocks and real estate, right? The returns sure look great. So what’s
the catch?
The greater an investment’s potential return, the greater (generally) is its
risk. But the main drawback to ownership investments is volatility (the size 
of the fluctuations in the value of an investment). Last century, for example,
stocks declined by more than 10 percent in a year, approximately once every
five years. Drops in stock prices of more than 20 percent occurred about
once every ten years (see Figure 1-1). Thus, in order to earn those generous
long-term stock market returns of about 10 percent per year, you had to toler-
ate volatility. That’s why you absolutely should not put all your money in the
stock market.
20
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

In Figure 1-2, you see bonds that have had fewer years in which they’ve 
provided rates of return that were as tremendously negative or positive as
stocks. Bonds are less volatile, but, as I discuss in the preceding section, on
average you earn a lower rate of return.

Chapter 1: Making More Money, Taking Less Risk

Some types of bonds have higher yields than others, but nothing is free,
either. A bond generally pays you a higher rate of interest as compared with
other bonds when it has
 Lower credit quality, which compensates for the higher risk of default
and the higher likelihood that you’ll lose your investment
 Longer-term maturity, which compensates for the risk that you’ll be
unhappy with the bond’s interest rate if interest rates move up
 Callability, which retains an organization’s or company’s right to buy
back (pay off) the issued bonds before the bonds mature
Companies like to be able to pay off early if they’ve found a cheaper way
to borrow the money. Early payback is a risk to bondholders because
they may get their investment money returned to them when interest
rates have dropped.
Diversifying: A smart way to reduce risk
Diversification is one of the most powerful investment concepts. It requires
you to place your money in different investments with returns that aren’t
completely correlated. Now for the plain-English translation: With your
money in different places, when one of your investments is down in value, 
the odds are good that at least one other is up.
To decrease the odds that all your investments will get clobbered at the same
time, put your money in different types or classes of investments. The differ-
ent kinds of investments include money market funds, bonds, stocks, real
estate, and precious metals. You can further diversify your investments by
investing in international, as well as domestic markets.
You should also diversify within a given class of investments. For example,
with stocks, diversify by investing in different types of stocks that perform
well under various economic conditions. For this reason, mutual funds,
which are diversified portfolios of securities, are highly useful investment
vehicles. You buy into the mutual fund, which in turn pools your money with
that of many others to invest in a vast array of stocks or bonds.
You can look at the benefits of diversification in two ways:
 Diversification reduces the volatility in the value of your whole portfolio.
In other words, when you diversify, you can achieve the same rate of
return that a single investment can provide, but with reduced fluctua-
tions in value.
 Diversification allows you to obtain a higher rate of return for a given
level of risk.

and Weaknesses
In This Chapter

 Considering the drawbacks
I
’m not sure where the mutual in mutual funds comes from; perhaps it’s so
named because the best funds allow many people of differing economic
means to mutually invest their money for
 Easy diversification
 Access to professional money managers
 Low investment management costs
No matter where the word came from, mutual funds, like any other invest-
ment, have their strengths and weaknesses that you need to know about
before you invest your money. This chapter discusses the advantages and
disadvantages of mutual funds.
Getting a Grip on Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is a collection of investment money pooled from a lot of people
to be invested for a specific objective. When you invest in a mutual fund, you
buy shares and become a shareholder of the fund. The fund manager and his
team of assistants determine which specific securities (for example, stocks,
bonds, or money market funds) they should invest the shareholders’ money in,
in order to accomplish the objectives of the fund and keep shareholders happy.

Because good mutual funds take most of the hassle and cost out of figuring
out which securities to invest in, they’re among the best investment vehicles
ever created:
 Mutual funds allow you to diversify your investments — that is, invest in
many different industries and companies instead of in just one or two.
By spreading the risk over a number of different securities representing
many different industries and companies, mutual funds lessen your port-
folio’s instability and the chances of a large loss.
 Mutual funds enable you to give your money to the best money man-
agers in the country — some of the same folks who manage money for
the already rich and famous.
 Mutual funds are the ultimate couch potato investment! However, unlike
staying home and watching television or playing video games, investing
in mutual funds can pay you big rewards.
What’s really cool about mutual funds is that when you understand them, 
you realize that they can help you meet many different financial goals. Maybe
you’re building up an emergency savings stash of three to six months’ living
expenses (a prudent idea, by the way). Perhaps you’re starting to think about
saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future educational costs. You may
know what you need the money for, but you may not know how to protect the
money you have and make it grow.
Don’t feel bad if you haven’t figured out a long-term financial plan or don’t
have a goal in mind for the money you’re saving. Many people don’t have
their finances organized, which is why I write books like this one! I talk more
specifically in Chapter 3 about the kinds of goals mutual funds can help you
accomplish.
Understanding families 
and individual funds
Throughout this book, I discuss mutual fund companies, as well as individual
funds. To better illustrate the difference between the two, let me draw an
analogy to a family with parents and children.
Think of mutual fund companies, such as T. Rowe Price and Vanguard, as
parent firms that act as the distributors for a group of funds. The parent com-
pany doesn’t actually take your money. Instead, it’s responsible for distributing
(selling, marketing, and so on) and managing the individual mutual funds — the
kids, if you will, in the family.
24
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

You actually invest your money in an individual mutual fund — one wayfaring
child of the whole family — such as Dodge & Cox’s International Fund or the
T. Rowe Price Balanced Fund. Dodge & Cox and T. Rowe Price are the parent
companies.
As with real families, good parent companies tend to produce better off-
spring. That’s why you should understand the reputation of the parent firm
that’s responsible for overseeing the fund before you ever invest in it. What’s
the parent’s track record with similar funds? How long has the parent been
managing the types of funds you’re interested in? Has the parent had any dis-
asters with similar funds? The specific funds I recommend later in the book
satisfy these concerns.
The sky’s (or the ceiling’s) the limit:
Open-end versus closed-end funds
Open end and closed end are general terms that refer to whether a mutual
fund company issues an unlimited or a set amount of shares in a particular
fund. Check out more specific information:
25
Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses
Financial intermediaries
A mutual fund is a type of financial intermediary.
(Now that’s a mouthful!) Why should you care?
Because if you understand what a financial
intermediary is and how mutual funds stack up
to other financial intermediaries, you’ll better
understand when funds are appropriate for your
investments and when they probably aren’t. A
financial intermediary is nothing more than an
organization that takes money from people who
want to invest and then gives the money to
those who need investment capital (another
term for money).
Suppose that you want to borrow money to
invest in your own business. You go to a bank
that examines your financial records and agrees
to loan you $20,000 at 8 percent interest for five
years. The money that the banker is lending you
has to come from somewhere, right? Well, the
banker got that money from a bunch of people
who deposited money with the banker at, say, 
2 percent interest. Therefore, the banker acts as
a financial intermediary, or middleman — one
who receives money from depositors and lends
it to borrowers who can use it productively.
Insurance companies do similar things with
money. They sell investments, such as annuities
(see Chapter 1), and then turn around and lend the
money — by investing in bonds, for example — to
businesses that need to borrow. (Remember, a
bond is nothing more than a company’s promise
to repay borrowed money over a specified period
of time at a specified interest rate.)
The best mutual funds are often the best finan-
cial intermediaries for you to invest through
because they skim off less (that is, they charge
lower management fees) to manage your
money and allow you more choice and control
over how you invest your money.

 Open-end funds: Open end simply means that the fund issues as many
(or as few) shares as investors demand. Open-end funds theoretically
have no limit to the number of investors or the amount of money that
they hold.
 Closed-end funds: Closed-end funds are those where the mutual fund
companies decide upfront, before they take on any investors, exactly
how many shares they’ll issue. After they issue these shares, the only
way you can purchase shares (or more shares) is to buy them from an
existing investor through a broker. This process happens with buying
and selling stock, too.
The vast majority of funds in the marketplace are open-end funds, and
they’re also the funds that I focus on in this book because the better open-
end funds are superior to their closed-end counterparts. Open-end funds are
usually preferable to closed-end funds for the following reasons:
 Management talent: The better open-end funds attract more investors
over time. Therefore, they can afford to pay the necessary money to hire
leading managers. I’m not saying that closed-end funds don’t have good
managers, too, but generally, open-end funds attract better talent.
 Expenses: Because they can attract more investors, and therefore 
more money to manage, the better open-end funds charge lower annual
operating expenses. Closed-end funds tend to be much smaller and,
therefore, more costly to operate. Remember, operating expenses are
deducted out of shareholder returns before a fund pays its investors
their returns; therefore, relatively higher annual expenses depress the
returns for closed-end funds.
Brokers who receive a hefty commission generally handle the initial sale
of a closed-end fund. Brokers’ commissions usually siphon anywhere
from 5 to 8 percent out of your investment dollars, which they generally
don’t disclose to you. (Even if you wait until after the initial offering to
buy closed-end fund shares on the stock exchange, you still pay a broker-
age commission.) You can avoid these high commissions by purchasing a
no-load (commission-free), open-end mutual fund (see “Funds save you
money and time” later in this chapter for more info on no-load funds).
 Fee-free selling: With an open-end fund, the value of a share (known as
the net asset value) always equals 100 percent of what the fund’s invest-
ments (less liabilities) are currently worth. And you don’t have the cost
and trouble of selling your shares to another investor as you do with a
closed-end fund. Because closed-end funds trade like securities on the
stock exchange and because you must sell your shares to someone 
who wants to buy, closed-end funds sometimes sell at a discount. Even
though the securities in a closed-end fund may be worth, say, $20 per
share, the fund may sell at only $19 per share if sellers outnumber buyers.
26
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Sometimes, a closed-end fund that sells at a discount can be good. You
could buy shares in a closed-end fund at a discount and hold on to them
in hopes that the discount disappears or — even better — turns into a
premium (which means that the share price of the fund exceeds the
value of the investments it holds). You should never pay a premium to
buy a closed-end fund, and you shouldn’t generally buy one without get-
ting at least a 5 percent discount.
Sorry to complicate things, but I need to make one clarification. Open-end
funds can, and sometimes do, decide at a later date to “close” their fund to
new investors. This doesn’t make it a closed-end fund, however, because
investors with existing shares can generally buy more shares from the fund
company. Instead, the fund becomes an open-end fund that’s closed to new
investors!
Why Should I? Opting for Mutual Funds
To understand why funds are so sensible is to understand how and why
funds can work for you. Keep reading in this section to discover their many
benefits. Because mutual funds also have their drawbacks, I cover them in
the section, “Addressing the Drawbacks,” later in this chapter. In Part II of
this book, I compare mutual funds to other investing alternatives so you can
clearly understand when funds are and aren’t your best choice.
Fund managers are well trained
Mutual funds are investment companies that pool your money with the
money of hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other investors. The 
company hires a portfolio manager and a team of researchers whose full-time
job is to analyze and purchase investments that best meet the fund’s stated
objectives.
Typically, fund managers are Chartered Financial Analysts (CFAs) and/or
graduates of the top business and finance schools in the country, where they
study the principles of portfolio management and securities valuation and
selection. In addition to their educational training, the best fund managers
typically have a decade or more of experience in analyzing and selecting
investments.
27
Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses

A mutual fund management team does more research and due diligence than
you could ever have the energy or expertise to do in what little free time you
have. Investing in mutual funds can help your friendships, and maybe even
your love life, because you’ll have more free time! Consider the following
activities that an investor should do before investing in stocks and bonds:
 Analyze company financial statements: Companies whose securities
trade in the financial markets are required to issue reports every three
months detailing their revenue, expenses, profits and losses, and assets
and liabilities. Unless you’re a numbers geek, own a financial calculator,
and enjoy dissecting tedious corporate financial statements, this first
task alone is reason enough to invest through a mutual fund and leave
the driving to the mutual fund management team.
 Talk with the muckety-mucks: Most fund managers log thousands of 
frequent-flier miles and hundreds of hours talking to the folks running
the companies they’re invested in or are thinking about investing in.
Because of the huge amount of money they manage, large fund compa-
nies even get visits from company executives, who fly in to grovel at the
fund managers’ feet. Now, do you have the correct type of china and all
the place settings that etiquette demands of people who host such high-
level folks?!
 Analyze company and competitor strategies: Corporate managers have
an irritating tendency to talk up what a great job they’re doing. In the
worst cases, they fib; often they just want rich investors to feel warm 
and fuzzy about forking over their loot. Some companies may look as if
they’re making the right moves, but what if their products are soon to lag
behind the competition’s? Fund managers and their researchers take a
skeptical view of what a company’s execs say — they read the fine print
and check under the rugs. They also keep on top of what competitors are
doing. Sometimes they discover better investment ideas this way.
 Talk with company customers, suppliers, competitors, and industry
consultants: Another way the mutual fund managers find out if a com-
pany’s public relations story is full of holes instead of reality is by speak-
ing with the company’s customers, suppliers, competitors, and other
industry experts. These people often have more balanced viewpoints
and can be a great deal more open about the negatives. These folks are
harder to find but can provide valuable information.
 Attend trade shows and review industry literature: It’s truly amazing
how specialized the world’s becoming. Do you really want to subscribe
to business magazines that track the latest happenings with ball bearing
or catalytic converter technology? They’ll put you to sleep in a couple of
pages. Unlike popular mass-market magazines, they’ll also charge you an
arm and a leg to subscribe.
28
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Are you, as the investor, going to do all these tasks and do them well?
Nothing personal, but I doubt that you will. Even in the unlikely event that
you could perform investment research as well as the best fund managers,
don’t you value your time? A good mutual fund management team happily
performs all the required research for you, does it well, and does it for a 
fraction of what it costs you to do it haphazardly on your own.
Funds save you money and time
Chances are the last thing you want to do with your free time is research where
to invest your savings. If you’re like many busy people, you’ve kept your
money in a bank just to avoid the hassles. Or maybe you turned your money
over to some smooth-talking broker who sold you a high-commission invest-
ment that you still don’t understand but are convinced will make you rich.

Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses
A (brief) history of mutual funds
Mutual funds date back to the 1800s, when
English and Scottish investment trusts sold
shares to investors. Funds arrived in the United
States (U.S.) in 1924. They were growing in
assets until the late 1920s, when the Great
Depression derailed the financial markets and
the economy. Stock prices plunged and so did
mutual funds that held stocks.
As was common in the stock market at that time,
mutual funds were leveraging their investments —
leveraging is a fancy way of saying that they put
up only, for example, 25 cents on the dollar for
investments they actually owned. The other 75
cents was borrowed. That’s why, when the stock
market plunged in 1929, some investors and fund
shareholders got clobbered. They were losing
money on their investments and on all the bor-
rowed money. But, like the rest of the country,
mutual funds, although bruised, pulled through
this economic calamity.
In 1940, the Investment Company Act established
ground rules and oversight of the fund industry
by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Among other benefits, this landmark fed-
eral legislation required funds to gain approval
from the SEC before issuing or selling any fund
shares to the public. Over time, this legislation
has been strengthened by requiring funds to dis-
close cost, risk, and other information in a uni-
form format through a legal document called a
prospectus (see Chapter 7).
During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, funds grew at a
fairly high and constant rate. From less than $1
billion in assets in 1940, fund assets grew to
more than $50 billion by the late ’60s — more
than a fiftyfold increase. Before the early ’70s,
funds focused largely on investing in stocks.
Since then, however, money market mutual
funds and bond mutual funds have mush-
roomed. They now account for about 40 percent
of all mutual fund assets.
Today, thousands of mutual funds manage
about $11 trillion.

Mutual funds are a cheaper, more communal way to get the investing job
done. A mutual fund spreads out the cost of extensive — and expensive —
research over thousands of investors. How does a mutual fund save you time
and money? Let me count the ways:
 Mutual funds can produce a much better rate of return over the long
haul than a dreary, boring bank account or an insurance company
account. You can purchase by writing a check or calling a toll-free
number. What does it cost to hire such high-powered talent to do all the
dreadful research and analysis? A mere pittance if you pick the right
funds. In fact, when you invest your money in an efficiently managed
mutual fund, the cost should be less than it would be to trade individual
securities on your own.
 Mutual funds manage money efficiently through effective use of tech-
nology. Innovations in information-management tools enable funds to
monitor and manage billions of dollars from millions of investors at a
very low cost. In general, moving around $5 billion in securities doesn’t
cost them much more than moving $500 million. Larger investments just
mean a few more zeros in the computer data banks.
The most efficiently managed mutual funds cost less than 1 percent per
year in expenses. (Bond funds and money market funds cost much less —
good ones charge just 0.5 percent per year or less.) Some of the larger and
more established funds charge annual expenses of less than 0.2 percent
per year.
 Many mutual funds don’t charge a commission (load) to purchase or
redeem shares. Commission-free funds are called no-load funds. Such
opportunities used to be rare. Fidelity and Vanguard, the two largest 
distributors of no-load funds today, exacted sales charges as high as 8.5
percent during the early 1970s. Even today, some mutual funds known as
load funds charge you a commission for buying or selling shares in their
funds. (See Chapter 7 for the complete story on fund fees.)
If you decide that you want to withdraw money from a fund, most 
funds — particularly no-loads — don’t charge you a redemption fee.
(Think about that — some investments require that you pay to get 
your own money back!)
Fund diversification minimizes your risk
Diversification is a big attraction for many investors who choose mutual funds.
Here’s an example of why, which should also explain what diversification is all
about: Suppose you heard that Phenomenal Pharmaceuticals developed a drug
that stops cancer cells in their tracks. You run to the phone, call your broker,
and invest all your savings in shares of Phenomenal stock. Five years later, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denies the company approval for the drug
and the company goes belly up, taking your entire nest egg with it.
30
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Your money would’ve been much safer in a mutual fund. A mutual fund might
buy some shares of a promising, but risky, company like Phenomenal without
exposing investors like you to financial ruin. A fund owns stocks or bonds
from dozens of companies, diversifying against the risk of bad news from any
single company or sector. So when Phenomenal goes belly up, the fund may
barely feel a ripple.
Diversifying like that on your own would be difficult — and expensive —
unless you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to
invest. You’d need to invest money in at least 8 to 12 different companies in
various industries to ensure that your portfolio could withstand a downturn
in one or more of the investments.
Mutual funds typically invest in 25 to 100 securities, or more. Proper diversifi-
cation increases the probability that the fund receives the highest possible
return at the lowest possible risk, given the objectives of the fund.
I’m not suggesting that mutual funds escape without share-price declines
during major market downturns. For example, mutual funds that invested 
in U.S. stocks certainly declined during the October 1987 U.S. stock market
crash. However, the unhappiest investors that month were the individuals
who had all their money riding on only one or a handful of stocks. Some indi-
vidual stock share prices plunged by as much as 80 to 90 percent. During the
early 2000s bear market, many mutual funds declined in value. But again, the
investors who were most harmed were those who held individual stocks that,
in the worst cases, ended up plummeting to $0 as companies went bankrupt
or those investors who loaded up on technology and Internet stocks that
dropped 80 to 90 percent or more.
Although most mutual funds are diversified, some aren’t. For example, some
stock funds, known as sector funds, invest exclusively in stocks of a single
industry (for instance, healthcare). Others focus on a single country (such 
as India). I’m not a fan of such funds because of the lack of diversification 
and because such funds typically charge higher operating fees. It’s also 
worth noting that investors who bought sector funds investing exclusively 
in Internet stocks got hammered in the technology stock crash of the early
2000s. Many of those funds dropped 80 percent or more, whereas broadly
diversified funds fared far better. I talk more about narrowly focused stock
funds in Chapter 12.
Funds undergo regulatory scrutiny
Before a fund can take in money from investors, the fund must go through a
tedious review process by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
After it offers shares, a mutual fund is required to publish in its prospectus
(see Chapter 7) historical data on the fund’s earnings, its operating expenses
and other fees, and its rate of trading (turnover) in the fund’s investments.
31
Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses

But know that government regulators aren’t perfect. Conceivably, a fund
operator could try to slip through some bogus numbers, but I wouldn’t lose
sleep worrying about this, especially if you invest through the larger, rep-
utable fund companies recommended in this book.
You choose your risk level
Choosing from a huge variety of mutual funds, you can select the funds that
meet your financial goals and take on the kinds of risks that you’re comfort-
able with. Funds to choose from include
 Stock funds: If you want your money to grow over a long period of time
(and you can put up with some bad years thrown in with the good),
select funds that invest more heavily in stocks. (Check out Chapter 12
for the complete story on stock funds.)
 Bond funds: If you need current income and don’t want investments
that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider bond funds 
(see Chapter 11).
 Money market funds: If you want to be sure that your invested principal
doesn’t drop in value because you may need to use your money in the
short term, you can choose a money market fund (see Chapter 10).
Most investors choose a combination of these three types of funds to diver-
sify and help meet different financial goals. I get into all that information in
the chapters to come.
32
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 
Are mutual funds too risky?
One of the major misconceptions about mutual
funds is that they all invest entirely in stocks
and, therefore, are too risky. They don’t, and
they’re not. By using mutual funds, you can
invest in a whole array of securities, ranging
from money market funds, bonds, stocks, and
even real estate.
All mutual funds aren’t created equal. Some funds,
such as money market funds, carry virtually zero
risk that your investment will decline in value.
Bond funds that invest in shorter-term bonds don’t
generally budge by more than several percentage
points per year. And you may be surprised to find
out in Chapter 12 that some conservative stock
funds aren’t all that risky if you can plan on hold-
ing them for a decade or more.

Fund risk of bankruptcy is nil
Mutual funds don’t work like banks and insurance companies, hundreds of
which have failed in recent decades. Banks and insurers can fail because
their liabilities (the money customers have given them to invest) can exceed
their assets (the money they’ve invested or lent). When a big chunk of a
bank’s loans goes sour at the same time that its depositors want their money
back, the bank fails. That happens because banks have less than 20 cents on
deposit for every dollar that you and I place with them. Likewise, if an insur-
ance company makes several poor investments or underestimates the
number of claims that insurance policyholders will make, it too can fail.
Such failures can’t happen with a mutual fund. The situation in which the
investors’ demand for the return of their investment exceeds the value of a
fund’s assets simply can’t occur because for every dollar of assets that a fund
holds for its customers, that mutual fund has a dollar’s worth of redeemable
securities.
That’s not to say that you can’t lose money in a mutual fund. The share price
of a mutual fund is tied to the value of its underlying securities: If the underly-
ing securities, such as stocks, decrease in value, so, too, does the net asset
value (share price) of the fund. If you sell your shares when their price is less
than what you paid for them, you get back less cash than you originally put
into the fund. But that’s the worst that can happen; you can’t lose all your
investment in a mutual fund unless every single security owned by that fund
simultaneously becomes worthless — an extraordinarily unlikely event.
You may be interested to know that the specific stocks and/or bonds that a
mutual fund buys are held by a custodian — a separate organization or affili-
ate of the mutual fund company. The employment of a custodian ensures that
the fund management company can’t embezzle your funds and use assets
from a better-performing fund to subsidize a poor performer.
Funds save you from sales sharks
Stockbrokers (also known as financial consultants) and commission-based
financial planners make more money by encouraging trading activity and by
selling you investments that provide them with high commissions — limited
partnerships and mutual funds with high-load fees, for example. Brokers and
planners also get an occasional message from the top brass asking them to
sell some newfangled investment product. All this creates inherent conflicts
of interest that can prevent brokers from providing objective investment and
financial advice and recommendations.
33
Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses

The better no-load (commission-free) fund companies discussed in this book
generally don’t push specific products. Their toll-free telephone lines are
staffed with knowledgeable people who earn salaries, not commissions. Sure,
they want you to invest with their company, but the size of their next pay-
check doesn’t depend on how much they persuade you to buy or trade.
You have convenient access to your money
What I find really terrific about dealing with mutual funds is that they’re set
up for people who don’t like to waste time going to a local branch office and
waiting in line. I don’t know about you, but I enjoy waiting in lines, especially
in places like a bank, about as much as I enjoy having my dentist fill a cavity.
With mutual funds, you can make your initial investment from the comfort 
of your living room by filling out and mailing a simple form and writing a
check. (Computer lovers can open and fund accounts online as I discuss in
Chapter 14.) Later, you can add to your investment by mailing in a check or
by authorizing money transfers by phone or online from one mutual fund
account to another.
Selling shares of your mutual fund for cash is usually easy. Generally, all you
need to do is call the fund company’s toll-free number or click your computer
mouse at your investment firm’s Web site 24/7. Some companies even have
representatives available by phone 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
(Signature guarantees, although much less common, are still sometimes
required by small fund companies.)
Many mutual fund companies also allow you to wire money back and forth
from your local bank account, allowing you to access your money almost as
quickly through a money market fund as through your local bank. (As I dis-
cuss in Chapter 10, you probably need to keep a local bank checking account
to write smaller checks and for immediate ATM access to cash.)
When dealing with a money market fund, in particular, the ease of access is
even greater. Most money market funds also offer check-writing privileges.
These accounts often carry a restriction, however, that your bank checking
account doesn’t have: Money market checks must be greater than a specified
minimum amount — typically $250.
If you like to conduct some transactions in person, some of the larger fund
companies, such as Fidelity, and certain discount brokers, such as Charles
Schwab and TD Ameritrade, have branch offices in convenient locations.

Addressing the Drawbacks
Although I’m a fan of good mutual funds, I’m also well aware of their draw-
backs, and you need to know them, too. After all, no investment vehicle is
perfect, and you need to understand mutual fund negatives before you take
the plunge.
Still, the mutual fund drawbacks that I’m concerned about are different from
the ones that some critics like to harp on. Here’s my take on which mutual
fund drawbacks you shouldn’t worry about — and which ones you should
stop and think about a little more.
Don’t worry about these . . .
If you’ve read some articles or heard some news stories about the downsides
of mutual funds, you may have heard of some of the following concerns.
However, you shouldn’t let them trouble you:
35
Chapter 2: Mutual Funds: Strengths and Weaknesses
Don’t fret about the crooks
Don’t worry about others having easy access to
the money you’ve invested in mutual funds. Even
if someone were able to convince a fund com-
pany through the toll-free phone line or on their
Web site that he were you (say, by knowing your
account number and Social Security number),
the impostor, at worst, could only request a
transaction to occur between accounts regis-
tered in your name. You’d find out about the
shenanigans when the confirmation arrived in
the mail, at which time you could call the mutual
fund company and undo the whole mess. (Just
by listening to a tape of the phone call, which the
fund company records, or a record of the online
transaction, the company could confirm that you
didn’t place the trade.)
No one can actually take money out of your
account, either. Suppose that someone does
know your personal and account information and
calls a fund company to ask that a check be sent
from a redemption on the account. Even in such a
scenario, the check would be sent to the address
on the account and be made payable to you.
The only way that someone can actually take
money out of your account is with your autho-
rization. And there’s only one way to do that: by
completing a full trading authorization or power-
of-attorney form. I generally recommend that
you not grant this authority to anyone. If you do,
make sure that the investment firm makes
checks payable only to you, not to the person
requesting the money from the account.

 The investment Goliath: One of the concerns I still hear about is the one
that, because the fund industry is growing, if stock fund investors head
for the exits at the same time, they may get stuck or trampled at the
door. Mutual funds hold 33 percent of outstanding U.S. stocks. They’re
growing in importance simply because they’re a superior alternative for
a whole lot of people.
 Doing business long distance: Some people, particularly older folks who
grew up doing all their saving through a local bank, feel uncomfortable
doing business with a company that they can reach only via a toll-free
number, the mail, or a Web site. But please recognize the enormous 
benefits of mutual funds not having branch offices all over the country.
Branch offices cost a lot of money to operate, which is one of the rea-
sons why bank account interest rates are so scrawny.
If you feel better dropping your money off in person to an organization
that has local branch offices, invest in mutual funds through one of the
firms that I recommend in Chapter 8. Or do business with a fund com-
pany that’s headquartered near your abode. (See the Appendix for the
main addresses of the fund companies recommended in this book.)
 Fund company scandals: A number of funds (none that were recom-
mended in the previous editions of this book) earned negative publicity
due to their involvement in problematic trading practices. In the worst
cases, some fund managers placed their own selfish agendas (or that of
certain favored investors) ahead of their shareholders’ best interests.
Rightfully, these fund companies have been hammered for such behav-
ior and forced to reimburse shareholders and pay penalties to the gov-
ernment. However, the amount of such damage and reimbursement has
been less than 1 percent of the affected fund’s assets, which pales in
comparison to the ongoing drag of high expenses discussed in the next
section. As I have always stressed, the parent company responsible for
an individual fund should be an important consideration when deciding
which funds to entrust with your money. Avoid fund companies that
don’t place their shareholders’ interests first. (I definitely don’t recom-
mend those companies in this book.)
Worry about these (but not too much) . . .
No doubt you hear critics in the investment world state their case for why
you should shun funds. Not surprisingly, the most vocal critics are those who
compete with fund companies and stand to lose money as increasing num-
bers of investors discover the virtues of fund investing.
You can easily overcome the common criticisms raised about fund investing
if you do your homework and buy the better available mutual funds, which I
show you how to do in this book. Make sure that you consider and accommo-
date these factors before you invest in any mutual fund:
36
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

 Volatility of your investment balance: When you invest in mutual funds
that hold stocks and/or bonds, the value of your funds fluctuates with
the general fluctuations in those securities markets. These fluctuations
don’t happen if you invest in a bank certificate of deposit (CD) or a fixed
insurance annuity that pays a set rate of interest yearly. With CDs or
annuities, you get a statement every so often that shows steady — but
slow — growth in your account value. You never get any great news, but
you never get any bad news either (unless your insurer or bank fails,
which could happen).
Over the long haul, if you invest in solid mutual funds — ones that are
efficiently and competently managed — you should earn a better rate 
of return than you would with bank and insurance accounts. And if you
invest in stock funds, you’ll be more likely to keep well ahead of the
double bite of inflation and taxes.
If you panic and rush to sell when the market value of your mutual fund
shares drops (instead of holding on and possibly taking advantage of the
buying opportunity), then maybe you’re not cut out for funds. Take the
time to read and internalize the investment lessons in this book, and
you’ll soon be an honors graduate from my Mutual Fund University!
 Mystery (risky) investments: Some mutual funds (not those that I recom-
mend) have betrayed their investors’ trust by taking unnecessary risks by
investing in volatile financial instruments such as futures and options (also
known as derivatives). Because these instruments are basically short-term
bets on the direction of specific security prices (see Chapter 1), they’re
very risky when not properly used by a mutual fund. If a fund discloses 
in its prospectus that it uses derivatives, look to see if the derivatives are
used only for hedging purposes to reduce risk instead of as speculation 
on stock and bond price movements, which would increase risk.
 Investments that cost an arm and a leg: Not all mutual funds are cre-
ated equal. Some charge extremely high annual operating expenses that
put a real drag on returns (again, you won’t find such funds on my rec-
ommended lists in this book). I talk more about expense ratios and how
to find great funds with low expenses in Chapter 7.
 Taxable distributions: The taxable distributions that funds produce can
also be a negative. When fund managers sell a security at a profit, the
fund must distribute that profit to shareholders in the fund (dividends
are also passed through). For funds held outside tax-sheltered retire-
ment accounts, these distributions are taxable. I fill you in on taxes and
mutual funds in Chapter 9.
Some people — especially brokers and self-anointed gurus who advocate
investing in individual securities — argue that taxes on mutual fund dis-
tributions are a problem big enough to justify the avoidance of mutual
funds altogether, especially for higher-tax-bracket investors. They don’t
have to be. If you’re concerned about the money you’re investing outside
of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, don’t worry — I have a solution: See
my recommended tax-friendly funds in Chapters 10 through 12.

Chapter 3
Funding Your Financial Plans
In This Chapter
 Covering your bases before investing
 Meeting your goals with the help of mutual funds
Justine and Max, both in their 20s, recently married and excited about
planning their life together, heard about a free financial-planning seminar
taking place at the local hotel. A local financial planner taught the seminar.
One of his points was, “If you want to retire by the age of 65, you need to save
at least 12 percent of your income every single year between now and retire-
ment . . . the longer you wait to start saving, the more painful it’ll be.”
For the couple, the seminar was a wake-up call. On the drive home, they
couldn’t stop thinking and talking about their finances and their future. 
They had big plans: They wanted to buy a home, they wanted to send the
not-yet-born kiddies to college, and they definitely wanted to retire by age 65.
And so it was resolved: A serious investment program must begin right away.
Tomorrow, they’d fill out two applications for mutual fund companies that
the financial planner had distributed to them.
Within a week, they’d set up accounts in five different mutual funds at two
firms. No more 3-percent-return bank savings accounts — the funds they
chose had been returning 10 or more percent per year! Unlike most of their
20-something friends who didn’t own funds or understand what funds were,
they believed they were well on their way to realizing their dreams.
Although I have to admire Justine and Max’s initiative (that’s often the
biggest hurdle to starting an investment program), I must point out the mis-
takes they made by investing the way they did. The funds themselves weren’t
poor choices — in fact, the funds they chose were solid: Each had competent
managers, good historic performance, and reasonable fees.

The following points are the biggest mistakes they made:
 They completely neglected investing in their employers’ retirement
savings plans. They missed out on making tax-deductible contributions.
By investing in mutual funds outside of their employers’ plans, they
received no tax deductions.
 They were steered into funds that didn’t fit their goals. They ended up
with bond funds, which were decent funds as far as bond funds go. But
bond funds are designed to produce current income, not growth. Justine
and Max, looking to a retirement decades away, were trying to save and
grow their money, not produce more current income.
 To add tax insult to injury, the income generated by their bond funds
was fully taxable because the funds were held outside of tax-sheltered
retirement accounts. The last thing Justine and Max needed was more
taxable income, not because they were rolling in money — neither
Justine nor Max had a high salary — but because, as a two-income
couple, they already paid significant taxes.
 They didn’t adjust their spending habits to allow for their increased
savings rate. In their enthusiasm to get serious about their savings, they
made this error — probably the biggest one of all. Justine and Max
thought they were saving more — 12 percent of their income was going
into the mutual funds versus the 5 percent they’d been saving in a bank
account. However, as the months rolled by, their outstanding balances
on credit cards grew. In fact, when they started to invest in mutual
funds, Justine and Max had $1,000 of revolving debt on a credit card at a
14 percent interest rate. Six months later, their debt had grown to $2,000.
The extra money for investment had to come from somewhere — and in
Justine and Max’s case, it was coming from building up their credit card
debt. But, because their investments were highly unlikely to return 14
percent per year, Justine and Max were actually losing money in the
process. No real additional saving was going on — just borrowing from
Visa to invest in the mutual funds.
I tell the story of Justine and Max not to discourage you but to caution you
against buying mutual funds in haste or out of fear before you have your own
financial goals in mind. In this chapter, I explain how to fit mutual funds into a
thoughtful personal financial plan so the mutual funds you invest in and the
other personal finance decisions you make help you achieve your goals.
One thing to remember before you dive in: Don’t become obsessed with
making, saving, and investing money that you neglect what money can’t buy:
your health, friends, family, and exploration of career options and hobbies.

Lining up Your Ducks before You Invest
The single biggest mistake that mutual fund investors make is investing in
funds before they’re even ready to. It’s like trying to build the walls of a
house without a proper foundation. You have to get your financial ship in
shape — sailing out of port with leaks in the hull is sure to lead to an early,
unpleasant end to your journey. And you have to figure out what you’re
trying to accomplish with your investing. Throughout this book, I emphasize
that mutual funds are specialized tools for specific jobs. I don’t want you to
pick up a tool that you don’t know how to use. This section covers the most
important financial steps for you to take before you invest so you get the
most from your mutual fund investments.
Pay off your consumer debts
Consumer debts include balances on such items as credit cards and auto
loans. If you carry these types of debts, do not invest in mutual funds until
these consumer debts are paid off. I realize that investing money may make
you feel like you’re making progress; paying off debt, on the other hand, just
feels like you’re treading water. Shatter this illusion. Paying credit card inter-
est at 14 or 18 percent while making an investment that generates only an 
8 percent return isn’t even treading water; it’s sinking!
You won’t be able to earn a consistently high enough rate of return in mutual
funds to exceed the interest rate you’re paying on consumer debt. Although
some financial gurus claim that they can make you 15 to 20 percent per year,
they can’t — not year after year. Besides, in order to try and earn these high
returns, you have to take great risk. If you have consumer debt and little sav-
ings, you’re not in a position to take that much risk.
I go a step further on this issue: Not only should you delay any investing 
until your consumer debts are paid off, but also you should seriously con-
sider tapping into any existing savings (presuming you’d still have adequate
emergency funds at your disposal) to pay off your debts.
Review your insurance coverage
Saving and investing is psychologically rewarding and makes many people
feel more secure. But, ironically, even some good savers and investors are in
precarious positions because they have major gaps in their insurance cover-
age. Consider the following questions:
41
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans

 Do you have adequate life insurance to provide for your dependents if
you die?
 Do you carry long-term disability insurance to replace your income in
case a disability prevents you from working?
 Do you have comprehensive health insurance coverage to pay for major
medical expenses?
 Have you purchased sufficient liability protection on your home and car
to guard your assets against lawsuits?
Without adequate insurance coverage, a catastrophe could quickly wipe out
your mutual funds and other investments. The point of insurance is to elimi-
nate the financial downside of such a disaster and protect your investments.
In reviewing your insurance, you may also discover unnecessary policies or
ways to spend less on insurance, freeing up more money to invest in mutual
funds. See the latest edition of my book, Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th
Edition (Wiley), to discover the right and wrong ways to buy insurance and
whip the rest of your finances into shape.
Figure out your financial goals
Mutual funds are goal-specific tools (see “Reaching Your Goals with Mutual
Funds” later in this chapter), and humans are goal-driven animals, which is
perhaps why the two make such a good match. Most people find that saving
money is easier when they save with a purpose or goal in mind — even if
their goal is as undefined as a “rainy day.” Because mutual funds tend to be
pretty specific in what they’re designed to do, the more defined your goal,
the more capable you are to make the most of your mutual fund money.
Granted, your goals and needs will change over time, so these determinations
don’t have to be carved in stone. But unless you have a general idea of what
you’re going to do with the savings down the road, you won’t really be able to
thoughtfully choose suitable mutual funds. Common financial goals include
saving for retirement, a home purchase, an emergency reserve, and stuff like
that. In the second half of this chapter, I talk more about the goals mutual
funds can help you to accomplish.
Another benefit of pondering your goals is that you better understand how
much risk you need to take to accomplish your goals. Seeing the amount you
need to save to achieve your dreams may encourage you to invest in more
growth-oriented funds. Conversely, if you find that your nest egg is substan-
tial, given what your aspirations are, you may scale back on the riskiness of
your fund investments.
42
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Determine how much you’re saving
The vast majority of Americans haven’t a clue what their savings rate is. By
savings rate, I mean, over a calendar year, how did your spending compare
with your income? For example, if you earned $40,000 last year, and $38,000
of it got spent on taxes, food, clothing, rent, insurance, and other fun things,
you saved $2,000. Your savings rate then would be 5 percent ($2,000 of sav-
ings divided by your income of $40,000).
If you already know that your rate is low, nonexistent, or negative, you can
safely skip this step because you also already know that you need to save
much more. But figuring out your savings rate can be a real eye-opener and
wallet closer.
Examine your spending and income
If you’re saving enough to meet your goals, you can skip this step and move
ahead. For the rest of you, however, you need to do some additional work. To
save more, reduce your spending, increase your income, or both. This isn’t
rocket science, but it’s easier said than done.
For most people, reducing spending is the more feasible option. But where do
you begin? First, figure out where your money is going. You may have some
general idea, but you need to have facts. Get out your checkbook register,
credit card bills, and any other documentation of your spending history and
tally up how much you spend on dining out, operating your car(s), paying
your taxes, and everything else. When you have this information, you can
begin to prioritize and make the necessary trade-offs to reduce your spend-
ing and increase your savings rate.
Earning more income may help you save more to invest if you can get a
higher-paying job or increase the number of hours you’re willing to work.
Watch out, though: Many people’s spending has a nasty habit of soaking up
increases in income. If you’re already working many hours, tightening the belt
on your spending is better for your emotional and social well-being.
Maximize tax-deferred retirement 
account savings
Saving money is difficult for most people. Don’t make a tough job impossible
by forsaking the terrific tax benefits that come from investing through retire-
ment savings accounts. Employer-based 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans
offer substantial tax benefits. Contributions into these plans are generally
43
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans

federal- and state-tax-deductible. And after the money is invested inside these
plans, the growth on your contributions is tax-sheltered as well. Furthermore,
some employers will match a portion of your contributions.
Some investors make the common mistake of neglecting to take advantage of
retirement accounts in their enthusiasm to invest in nonretirement accounts.
Doing so can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years.
Fund companies are happy to encourage this financially detrimental behavior,
too. They lure you into their funds without educating you about using your
employer’s retirement plan first because the more you invest through your
employer’s plan, the less you have available to invest in their mutual funds.
Determine your tax bracket
When you’re investing in mutual funds outside of tax-sheltered retirement
accounts, the profits and distributions that your funds produce are subject 
to taxation. So the type of fund that makes sense for you depends, at least
partially, on your tax situation.
If you’re in a high bracket, give preference to mutual funds such as tax-free
bond funds and stock funds with low levels of distributions (especially highly
taxed capital gains). In other words, focus more on stock funds that derive
more of their expected returns from appreciation rather than from distribu-
tions. If you’re in a low bracket, avoid tax-free bond funds because you end
up with a lower return than in taxable bond funds. (In Part IV of this book, I
explain how to select the best fund types to fit your tax status.)
Assess the risk you’re comfortable with
Think back over your investing career. You may not be a star money manager,
but you’ve already made some investing decisions. For instance, leaving your
excess money in a bank savings or checking account is a decision — it may
indicate that you’re afraid of volatile investments.
How would you deal with an investment that dropped 10 to 50 percent in a
year? Some of the more aggressive mutual funds that specialize in volatile
securities like growth stocks, small company stocks, emerging market stocks,
and long-term and low-quality bonds can quickly fall. If you can’t stomach big
waves in the financial markets, don’t get in a small boat that you’ll want to
bail out of in a big storm. Selling after a big drop is the equivalent of jumping
into the frothing sea at the peak of a pounding storm.

Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

You can invest in the riskier types of securities by selecting well-diversified
mutual funds that mix a dash of riskier securities with a healthy helping of
more stable investments. For example, you can purchase an international
fund that invests the bulk of its money in companies of varying sizes in estab-
lished economies and that has a small portion invested in riskier, emerging
economies. That would be safer than investing the same chunk in a fund that
invests solely in small companies that are just in emerging countries.
Review current investment holdings
Many people have a tendency to compartmentalize their investments: IRA
money here, 401(k) there, brokerage account somewhere else. Part of making
sound investment decisions is to examine how the pieces fit together to make
up the whole. That’s where jargon like asset allocation comes into play. Asset
allocation simply means how your investments are divvied up among the
major types of securities or funds, such as money market, bond, United
States (U.S.) stock, international stock, and so on.
45
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans
Prioritizing your financial goals
Only you know what’s really most important to
you and how to prioritize your goals. And prior-
itize you must — because your desires outstrip
your ability to save and accomplish your goals.
Now that doesn’t mean that you can’t fulfill your
dreams. With an average income, you can, with
proper planning of course, achieve most of the
financial goals identified throughout this chap-
ter. But you do have to be realistic about how
many balls you can juggle at any one time.
That may mean, for example, that you have to
reduce your retirement plan contributions while
you save for a down payment on a home. Or that
you have to downscale the size of your dream
house a bit if you really want Junior to attend a
pricey, private college.
Again, you’re the best person to decide what
trade-offs to make. However, because of the tax
breaks that come with retirement account contri-
butions, retirement funding should always be near
the top of your priority list. Remember: Making
retirement account contributions reduces your
tax bill, effectively giving you more dollars with
which to accomplish your various goals.
And, as suggested by its name, your emergency
reserve fund should always be a top priority,
especially if your income is unstable and/or you
have no family to fall back on. On the other
hand, if you have a steady job and at least a few
solvent family members, you can probably
afford to build up this fund more slowly and in
conjunction with other savings goals.

Another reason to review your current investments before you buy into new
mutual funds is that some housecleaning may be in order. You may discover
investments that don’t fit with your objectives or tax situation. Perhaps you’ll
decide to clear out some of the individual securities that you know you can’t
adequately follow and that clutter your life.
Consider other “investment” possibilities
Mutual funds are a fine way to invest your money but hardly the only way.
You can also invest in real estate, invest in your own business or someone
else’s, or pay down mortgage debt more quickly. Again, what makes sense for
you depends on your goals and personal preferences. If you dislike taking
risks and detest volatile investments, paying down your mortgage may make
better sense than investing in mutual funds.
Reaching Your Goals with Mutual Funds
Mutual funds can help you achieve various financial goals. The rest of this
chapter gives an overview of some of these more common goals — saving 
for retirement, buying a home, paying for college costs, and so on — that 
you can tackle with the help of mutual funds. For each goal, I mention what
kinds of funds are best suited to it, and I point you to the part of the book
that discusses that kind of fund in greater detail.
As you understand more about this process, notice that the time horizon of
your goal — in other words, how much time you have between now and when
you need the money — largely determines what kind of fund is appropriate:
 If you need to tap into the money within two or three years or less, a
money market or short-term bond fund may fit the bill.
 If your time horizon falls between three and seven years, you want to
focus on bond funds.
 For long-term goals, seven or more years down the road, stock funds are
probably your ticket.
But time horizon isn’t the only issue. Your tax bracket, for example, is
another important consideration in mutual fund selection. (See Chapter 9 
for more about taxes.) Other variables are goal specific, so take a closer 
look at the goals themselves. Throughout the rest of this chapter, I also 
give you plenty of non-mutual-fund-related tips on how to tackle these goals.
Remember: Mutual funds are just part of the overall picture and a means to
the end of achieving your goals.

The financial pillow — 
an emergency reserve
Before you save money toward anything, accumulate an amount of money
equal to about three to six months of your household’s living expenses. This
fund isn’t for keeping up on the latest consumer technology gadgets. It’s for
emergency purposes: for your living expenses when you’re between jobs, for
unexpected medical bills, for a last-minute plane ticket to visit an ailing rela-
tive. Basically, it’s a fund to cushion your fall when life unexpectedly trips you
up. Call it your pillow fund. You’ll be amazed how much of a stress reducer a
pillow fund is.
How much you save in this fund and how quickly you build it up depends on
the stability of your income and the depth of your family support. If your job
is steady and your folks are still there for you, then you can keep the size of
this fund on the smaller side. On the other hand, if your income is erratic and
you have no ties to benevolent family members, you may want to consider
building up this fund to a year’s worth of expenses.
The ideal savings vehicle for your emergency reserve fund is a money market
fund. See Chapter 10 for an in-depth discussion of money market funds and a
list of the best ones to choose from.
The golden egg — investing for retirement
Uncle Sam gives big tax breaks for retirement account contributions. This
deal is one you can’t afford to pass up. The mistake that people at all income
levels make with retirement accounts is not taking advantage of them and
delaying the age at which they start to sock money away. The sooner you
start to save, the less painful it is each year, because your contributions have
more years to compound.
Each decade you delay approximately doubles the percentage of your earn-
ings that you should save to meet your goals. For example, if saving 5 percent
per year starting in your early 20s would get you to your retirement goal,
waiting until your 30s may mean socking away 10 percent; waiting until your
40s, 20 percent; beyond that, the numbers get troubling.
Taking advantage of saving and investing in tax-deductible retirement
accounts should be your number-one financial priority (unless you’re still
paying off high-interest consumer debt on credit cards or an auto loan).
47
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans

Retirement accounts should be called tax-reduction accounts. If they were
called that, people might be more excited about contributing to them. For
many people, avoiding higher taxes is the motivating force that opens the
account and starts the contributions. Suppose you’re paying about 35 per-
cent between federal and state income taxes on your last dollars of income
(see Chapter 9 to determine your tax bracket). For most of the retirement
accounts described in this chapter, for every $1,000 you contribute, you save
yourself about $350 in taxes in the year that you make the contribution. Some
employers will match a portion of your contributions to company-sponsored
plans, such as 401(k) plans — getting you extra dollars for free.
On average, most people need about 70 to 80 percent of their annual prere-
tirement income throughout retirement to maintain their standard of living. 
If you haven’t recently thought about what your retirement goals are, looked
into what you can expect from Social Security (okay, cease the giggling), or
calculated how much you should be saving for retirement, now’s the time 
to do it. My book, Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley), goes
through all the necessary details and even tells you how to come up with
more money to invest and how to do it wisely.
When you earn employment income (or receive alimony), you have the
option of putting money away in a retirement account that compounds with-
out taxation until you withdraw the money. With many retirement accounts,
you can elect to use mutual funds as your retirement account investment
option. And if you have retirement money in some other investment option,
you may be able to transfer it into a mutual fund company (see Chapter 14).
If you have access to more than one type of retirement account, prioritize
which accounts to use by what they give you in return. Your first contribu-
tions should be to employer-based plans that match your contributions. 
After that, contribute to any other employer or self-employed plans that
allow tax-deductible contributions. If you’ve contributed the maximum possi-
ble to tax-deductible plans or don’t have access to such plans, contribute to
an IRA. The following sections include the major types of accounts and
explain how to determine whether you’re eligible for them.
401(k) plans
For-profit companies typically offer 401(k) plans, which typically allow you 
to save up to $15,500 per year (tax year 2007), $20,500 for those 50 and older.
Your contributions to a 401(k) are excluded from your reported income and
are free from federal and state income taxes but not from FICA (Social
Security) taxes.
Absolutely don’t miss out on contributing to your employer’s 401(k) plan if
your employer matches a portion of your contributions. Your company, for
example, may match half of your first 6 percent of contributions (so you save
a lot of taxes and get a bonus from the company). Check with your com-
pany’s benefits department for your plan’s details.
48
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

Smaller companies (those with fewer than 100 employees) can consider offer-
ing 401(k) plans, too. In the past, administering a 401(k) was prohibitively
expensive for smaller companies. If your company is interested in this option,
contact a mutual fund organization, such as T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, or
Fidelity, or a discount brokerage house, such as Charles Schwab or TD
Ameritrade.
403(b) plans
Many nonprofit organizations offer 403(b) plans to their employees. As with a
401(k), your contributions are federal- and state-tax-deductible. The 403(b)
plans often are referred to as tax-sheltered annuities, the name for insurance-
company investments that satisfy the requirements for 403(b) plans. No-load
(commission-free) mutual funds can be used in 403(b) plans. Check which
mutual fund companies your employer offers you to invest through — I hope
you have access to the better ones covered in Chapter 8.
Employees of nonprofit organizations generally are allowed to contribute up
to 20 percent or $15,500 of their salaries ($20,500 for those individuals 50 and
older) — whichever is less. Employees who have 15 or more years of service
may be allowed to contribute more. Ask your employee benefits department
or the investment provider for the 403(b) plan (or your tax adviser) about eli-
gibility requirements and details about your personal contribution limits.
If you work for a nonprofit or public-sector organization that doesn’t offer
this benefit, make a fuss and insist on it. Nonprofit organizations have no
excuse not to offer a 403(b) plan to their employees. This type of plan
includes virtually no out-of-pocket setup expenses or ongoing accounting
fees like a 401(k) (see the preceding section). The only requirement is that
the organization must deduct the appropriate contribution from employees’
paychecks and send the money to the investment company that handles the
403(b) plan. (Some state and local governments offer plans that are quite sim-
ilar to 403(b) plans and are known as Section 457 plans.)
Small business plans
If you’re self-employed or a small business owner, you can establish your own
retirement savings plans. Simplified employee pension individual retirement
account (SEP-IRA) plans require little paperwork to set up. They allow you to
sock away 20 percent of your self-employment income (business revenue
minus expenses) up to a maximum of $45,000 per year. Each year, you decide
the amount you want to contribute — you have no minimums. Your contribu-
tions to a SEP-IRA are deducted from your taxable income, saving you big-
time on federal and state taxes. As with other retirement plans, your money
compounds without taxation until withdrawal.
49
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans

Keogh (profit sharing) plans are another retirement savings option for the
self-employed. They can and should be established through the no-load fund
providers recommended in this book. Keogh plans require a bit more paper-
work to set up and administer than SEP-IRAs do. (I show you the differences
in Chapter 14.) Keoghs now have the same contribution limits as SEP-IRAs —
20 percent of your self-employment income (revenue less your expenses), up
to a maximum of $45,000 per year.
Keogh plans allow business owners to maximize the contributions to which
they’re entitled relative to employees in two ways:
 Keogh plans allow vesting schedules, which require employees to
remain with the company a number of years before they earn the right
to their retirement account balances. If an employee leaves prior to
being fully vested, the unvested balance reverts to the remaining plan
participants.
 Keogh plans allow for Social Security integration. Integration effectively
enables high-income earners (usually the owners) to receive larger per-
centage contributions for their accounts than the less highly compen-
sated employees. The logic behind this benefit is that Social Security
taxes top out when you earn more than $97,500 (for tax year 2007).
Social Security integration allows you to make up for this ceiling.
When establishing your Keogh plan at a mutual fund or discount brokerage,
ask what features its plans allow — especially if you have employees and are
interested in vesting schedules and Social Security integration.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
Anyone with employment (or alimony) income can contribute to Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs). You may contribute up to $4,000 each year
($5,000 if you’re age 50 and older) or the amount of your employment or
alimony income if it’s less than these amounts in a year. If you’re a nonwork-
ing spouse, you may be eligible to contribute into a spousal IRA.
Your contributions to an IRA might be tax deductible. For the tax year 2007,
check out these eligibilities:
 If you’re single and your adjusted gross income (AGI) is $52,000 or less
for the year, you can deduct your IRA contribution.
 If you’re married and file your taxes jointly, you’re entitled to a full IRA
deduction if your AGI is $83,000 per year or less.
If you make more than these amounts, you can take a full IRA deduction if
you aren’t an active participant in any retirement plan. To know for certain
whether you’re an active participant is to look at the W-2 form that your
employer sends you early in the year to file with your tax returns. Little
50
Part I: Mutual Funds: Sharing Risks and Rewards 

boxes indicate whether you’re an active participant in a pension or deferred-
compensation plan. If either box is checked, you’re an active participant.
If you’re a single-income earner with an AGI above $52,000 but below $62,000,
or part of a couple with an AGI above $83,000 but below $103,000, you’re eligi-
ble for a partial IRA deduction, even if you’re an active participant. The size
of the IRA deduction that you may claim depends on where you fall in the
income range. For example, a single-income earner at $57,000 is entitled to
half ($2,000) of the full IRA deduction because his or her income falls halfway
between $52,000 and $62,000. (Note: These thresholds are for tax year 2007.
They’ll increase in the tax years ahead.)
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA account, consider
making a nondeductible contribution to a newer type of IRA account called
the Roth IRA. Single taxpayers with an AGI of $99,000 or less and joint filers
with an AGI of $156,000 or less can contribute up to $4,000 per year to a Roth
IRA ($5,000 for those individuals age 50 and older). Although the contribution
isn’t deductible, earnings inside the account are shielded from taxes, and
unlike a standard IRA, qualified withdrawals from the account, including
investment earnings, are free from income tax.
To make a qualified withdrawal from a Roth IRA, you must be at least 591⁄2 and
have held the account for at least five years. An exception to the age rule is
made for first-time homebuyers, who are allowed to withdraw up to $10,000
toward the down payment on a principal residence.
The white picket fence — 
saving for a home
A place to call your own is certainly the most tangible element of the
American dream. Not only does a home generally appreciate in value, but it
also should keep you dry in a thunderstorm (assuming, of course, that you
have a good roof!). Fortunately, borrowing money to buy a home is relatively
easy in the U.S.; otherwise, few people could ever afford it. Still, to get the
best mortgage terms for a house, you should aim for making a down payment
of 20 percent of the purchase price. (For a $250,000 home, that’s $50,000.) So
unless you have some other sources available (such as a loan from your par-
ents), you have some saving up to do.
If you’re looking to buy a home soon, then a money market fund is the best
place to store your down payment money (see Chapter 10). If your target 
purchase date is in a few years, then consider a short-term bond fund (see
Chapter 11). In the rare case that you start saving a decade or more in
advance, you can choose a balanced mix of stocks and bonds.

Tips on how to afford college
So, how are you going to be able to afford send-
ing your children to Prestige U. or even Budget
Community College? Gain financial aid and plug
the gap between what college costs are and
what you can afford with these tips:
 Fund your retirement accounts first. Self-
centered as it may seem, you’re really doing
yourself and your kids a tremendous finan-
cial favor if you fully fund your retirement
accounts before tucking away money for
college. First, you save yourself taxes. As
discussed in the section, “The golden egg —
investing for retirement” earlier in this chap-
ter, 401(k), 403(b), SEP-IRA, and Keogh plans
give you an immediate tax deduction at the
federal and state level. And after the money
is inside these retirement accounts, it com-
pounds without taxation over the years.
Second, the more money you save and
invest outside retirement accounts, the less
financial aid (loans and grants) your child
qualifies for. Strange as it may seem, the
financial aid system ignores 100 percent of
the money you invest inside retirement
accounts.
 Apply for financial aid. College is expensive
and, unless you’re affluent, you and your
child will need to borrow some money.
Consider these educational loans as invest-
ments in your family. Much financial aid,
including grants and loans, is available
regardless of need, so don’t make the mis-
take of not applying and researching.
The financial aid system examines your
income, assets and liabilities, number of
children in college, and stuff like that. Based
on an analysis, the financial aid process
may determine that you can afford to spend,
for example, $16,000 per year on college for
your child. That doesn’t mean that your
child can only consider schools that cost up
to that amount. In fact, if your son or daugh-
ter desires to go to a $45,000-per-year pri-
vate school, loans and grants may be able
to cover the difference between what the
financial aid system says you can afford
and what the college costs. If you don’t
apply for aid, you may never know what you
and your child are missing out on.
 Investigate all your options. In addition to
financial aid, you may be able to use other
sources to help pay college expenses. If
you’re a homeowner, for example, you may
be able to tap into home equity. The kids’
grandparents also may be financially able
to help out. (It’s better for the grandparents
to hold the money themselves until it’s
needed.)
 Teach your children the value of working,
saving, and investing. If you’re one of the
fortunate few who can pay for the full cost
of college yourself, more power to you. But
even if you can, you may not be doing as
well by your children as you may like to
believe. When children set goals and find
how to work, save, and make wise invest-
ments, these values pay dividends for a life-
time. So does your spending time with your
children instead of working so hard to try
and save enough to pay for 100 percent of
their college costs.
Encourage your children to share in the
cost of their education. They can contribute
in different ways, either upfront or by paying
off some of the outstanding loans after they
graduate. Either way, your children will
appreciate their education more.

The ivory tower — saving for college
A college education for the kiddies is certainly part of the American dream
today — not surprising when you consider that a college degree has quickly
replaced the high school diploma as the entrance bar to the U.S. job market.
Unfortunately, the financial services industry has fully exploited the opportu-
nity to deepen parental anxiety over educational expenses. Although mutual
funds can help send your kids off to college, their specific role may be differ-
ent from what you’d expect.
Saving in your own name
Few subject areas have more misinformation and bad advice than what pro-
fessionals dish out on investing for your children’s college expenses. Some
mutual fund companies, including a few of the better ones discussed in this
book, publish free guides that contain poor advice and scare tactics. Their
basic premise is that, by the time your tyke reaches age 18 or so, college is
going to cost more money than you could possibly imagine. Thus, you’d
better start saving a lot of money as soon as possible. Otherwise, you’ll have
to look your 18-year-old in the eyes some day and say, “Sorry, we can’t afford
to send you to the college you have your heart set on.”
Yes, college is expensive, and it’s not getting cheaper. But what the financial
services companies don’t like to tell you is that you don’t have to pay for all
of it yourself. Thanks to financial aid, most people don’t. By financial aid, I
mean more than just grants and scholarships; I’m also talking about low-cost
loans, which are by far and away the most common form of aid.
What’s really sad about the scare tactics some investment companies use 
is that these tactics effectively encourage parents to establish investment
accounts in their children’s names. The drawbacks for doing so are twofold:
 You limit the amount of financial aid for which your child is eligible.
The financial aid system heavily penalizes money held in your child’s
name by assuming that about 35 percent of the money in your child’s
name (for example, in custodial accounts) should be used toward col-
lege costs. By contrast, only 6 percent of the nonretirement money held
in your name is considered available for college expenses annually.
 You give your child free rein over your hard-earned investment.
When you place money in your child’s name, he or she has a legal right
to that money in most states at age 18 or 21. That means that your 18- 
or 21-year-old could spend the money on an around-the-world junket, a
new sports car, or anything else his or her young mind can dream up.
Because you have no way of knowing in advance how responsible your
children will be when they reach ages 18 or 21, you’re better off keeping
money earmarked for their college educations out of their names.
53
Chapter 3: Funding Your Financial Plans

If you can and want to pay for the full cost of your child’s education, you
have an income tax incentive to put money in your child’s name. Under
what’s known as the kiddie tax system, income generated by investments
held in your child’s name is usually taxed at a lower rate than your own. 
But remember that by saving money in a child’s name, you’re reducing that
child’s chances for financial aid. That’s why I say don’t invest in your child’s
name unless you want to pay for your child’s full college costs yourself.
You get the benefits of tax-deferred growth and professional investment 
management by mutual fund companies through 529 plans. Because the
money in 529 plans is earmarked for college, however, investing in these
plans may have some negative consequences on college financial aid.
Using mutual funds for college cost funding
To keep up with or stay ahead of college price increases (which are rising
faster than overall inflation), you must invest for growth. At the same time,
you have to keep an eye on your time horizon; kids grow up fast (see
“Reaching Your Goals with Mutual Funds” earlier in the chapter.)
The younger your child is, the more years you have before you need to tap
the money and, therefore, the greater the risk. A simple rule: Take a number
between 30 (if you’re aggressive) and 50 (if you’re more conservative) and
add that to your child’s age. Got that number? That’s the percentage you
should put in bonds; the rest should go into stocks. Be sure to continually
adjust the mix as your child gets older.
For a list of good stock and bond funds to invest in, see Chapters 10 and 11.
Pay particular attention to hybrid funds, which invest in both stocks and
bonds and may already reflect your desired mix. If you want to find out more
about getting your finances in order and planning for college costs, read my
book Personal Finance For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley).

nvesting in stocks and bonds via mutual funds is one of several ways to
tap into stocks and bonds. Some investors believe that they don’t need
mutual funds and that they should go and directly invest in their own stocks
and bonds. However, doing so is often much riskier than relying on mutual
funds. This chapter discusses why people choose their own stocks and
bonds and what you need to do if you decide to do so.
Choosing Your Own Stocks and Bonds
According to numerous books, newsletters, Web sites, and articles, mutual
funds aren’t the place to be. They’re boring, conservative, and prone to
mediocre returns. According to the pronouncements of these gurus, you 
can get rich quick by investing in these individual stocks.
Not only do these pundits say that investing in individual stocks provides
Himalayan returns . . .

the paid experts who manage mutual funds, plus have fun in doing it.” —
Peter Lynch, Beating the Street
Do the stock specialists’ claims sound too good to be true? Well, they are.
Beware the claims of stock-picking gurus
It’s easy to dismiss the outrageousness of the claims made by someone like
Wade Cook in the previous section. Even if you don’t know that Cook has for
many years been in trouble with securities regulators and the courts, your
common sense tells you that five- and six-digit returns are well outside the
realm of reasonable expectations for stock performance.
But what about the more believable performance claims, in the range of 20 and
30 percent, that can so easily dupe an investor into thinking they’re true — like
the annualized return of 23.4 percent claimed by the Beardstown Ladies?
The Beardstown investment club’s claim of 23.4 percent annualized returns
made me suspicious. Stocks historically return just 10 percent per year, yet
this club, in their book, was claiming to “. . . have been outperforming mutual
funds and professional money managers 3 to 1.” When the club was unwilling
to document their performance claims, I assumed they were false.
Turns out their claims were indeed bogus. Shane Tritsch, a reporter for
Chicago magazine, wrote a piece entitled “Bull Marketing” in which he
exposed gross inaccuracies in how the Beardstown investment club calcu-
lated its stock market returns. Tritsch was tipped off to potential problems
by a note that was added to the copyright page of the paperback edition of
the Beardstown book that said that the club’s 23.4 percent annualized returns
58
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

were determined “by calculating the increase in their total club balance over
time. Because this increase includes the dues that the members pay regu-
larly, this return may be different from the return that might be calculated for
a mutual fund. . . .”
May be different? Indeed. Using documents from the investment club that
were provided by a Wall Street Journal reporter, a senior research analyst
named Jim Raker, from mutual fund publisher Morningstar, told me that he
calculates that the investment club earned a return of a mere 9 percent per
year — a far cry from the 23-plus percent returns claimed by the club.
Even worse, though, is that the Beardstown investment club underperformed
the market. For the period in question (from 1983 to 1992), while the
Beardstown club actually earned just 9 percent per year, the Standard &
Poor’s 500 index — the widely followed index for the United States (U.S.)
stock market — returned about 16 percent. In fact, if you’d invested in lower-
risk bonds, you would’ve earned nearly 12 percent per year and still outper-
formed the stock picks of the Beardstown club!
Whenever an author, an investment newsletter, or an investment manager
claims to have produced a particular rate of return, especially a market-beating
return, I always ask for proof before I’m willing to put the claim in print myself.
Otherwise, how do I know whether the claims are real or advertising hype?
Some performance claims are so ridiculous that most journalists don’t fall for
them. I reported in my column about how investing seminar promoter Wade
Cook promised attendees that he could teach them to earn 300 percent per
year in the stock market. Although some journalists did report Cook’s decep-
tions and hype, consumers were still flocking to his $4,000 seminars.
As for Peter Lynch, who states in his book that an amateur stock picker 
can easily beat 95 percent of the pros, shame on him! Widely regarded as the
best mutual fund manager ever, Lynch knows more than anyone how much
hard work goes into beating the market. In fact, during the years that Lynch
piloted Fidelity’s Magellan fund, he was known for his workaholic 70- and 80-
hour workweeks. He stated publicly that the primary reason he retired early
was to spend more time with his family. That leaves everyone else to ques-
tion: He worked this hard to do something that he says anyone can do with
ease and that you, as an investor, don’t really need his skills for?
The notion that most average people and noninvestment professionals can
invest in individual stocks with minimal effort and beat the best full-time,
experienced money managers is, how should I say, ludicrous and absurd. 
But it does seem to appeal to some people’s egos — until the returns come 
in (or don’t come in, as the case may be).

Know the drawbacks of investing 
in individual securities
The stock-picking cheerleaders cite plenty of reasons and make hyped claims
to get you to invest in individual stocks. But they’re loath to mention the
drawbacks of selecting and trading individual securities. You won’t buy their
books and newsletters or visit their Web sites if they can’t promise you effort-
less riches, so you may not openly get the following information from the
“stock-picking-is-easy” writers:
60
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 
Following Jim Cramer’s stock picks
If you ever watch CNBC, you’ve likely come
across Jim Cramer, a former hedge fund man-
ager, who now hosts an investment show at the
network and operates a Web site among other
endeavors. If you’ve seen it, he yells and
screams and jumps around while pounding on
various sound-producing buttons.
Cramer rose to fame through his strongly opin-
ionated buy-and-sell recommendations on reg-
ular CNBC stock market programming and his
supposed extraordinary investment returns
from his days running a hedge fund bearing his
name. But there’s a problem: Despite repeated
requests from me, Cramer’s former and current
firms have been unable (and unwilling) to pro-
duce any independently audited tracking of
Cramer’s claimed returns.
Compounding this lack of any proof is a uni-
formly poor to mediocre track record of his
stock picks and pans in recent years. Two inde-
pendent Web sites have tracked Cramer’s stock
buys and sells:
 www.booyahboyaudit.com
 www.cxoadvisory.com/gurus/
Cramer
Both sites show how his stock market predic-
tions have underperformed the broad market
averages.
Also, I had no trouble finding numerous folks
who shelled out $400 yearly for his online
newsletter and were greatly disappointed. One
reader said, “I got caught up in watching his
nightly show and then I paid for his Action Alerts
service. That service sends e-mail alerts every
day telling you what to buy and sell. Well after
nine months, I lost a lot of money, and his port-
folio is currently showing a 1.3% gain for the
year to date (ever notice he doesn’t mention
that on his shows!). I could’ve just purchased
the S&P 500 and would be way ahead. His trad-
ing ideas do not work and his recommendations
to not use mechanical stop loss trades have
resulted in huge losses in my portfolio.”
Another reader states, “It is interesting to note
that Mr. Cramer goes out of his way to bash other
Wall Street pundits for their ‘advice-only-to-line-
my-pockets’ logic while he himself exudes the
same logic. Cramer’s book is full of plugs for his
other investing services (Action Alerts) which
lure you in with a short free trial period, then auto-
matically charge your credit card afterward.”

 Stock picking takes significant research time and expense. Before
buying an individual security (stock or bond), you should know a great
deal about the company you’re investing in. Relevant questions that you
need to answer include
• What products or services does the company sell?
• What are the company’s prospects for future growth and 
profitability?
• How does the company’s performance compare to its competitors’
performances — both recently and over the long haul?
• Are technological changes in the works that might harm or
improve their business?
• How much debt does the company have?
You need to do your homework on these questions, not only before 
you make your initial investment, but also on a continuing basis as long
as you hold an investment. Gathering this information and accessing
quality research on a company takes time and money. And you have to
conduct this legwork for every company that you consider investing in.
That’s how Lynch filled up his marathon workweeks as a fund manager.
Be honest with yourself. If you’re really going to research and monitor
your individual securities, the extra work ultimately will take time away
from other pursuits. In worst-case situations, I’ve seen busy people
spend almost as many hours on the weekend and in the evenings with
their portfolios as they do with family and friends. If you can really
afford the time for this type of hobby, more power to you. But remem-
ber, no one I know of has ever said on her deathbed, “I wish I had spent
more time watching my investments.” You only get one chance to live
your life — once squandered, your time is gone forever.
 Stock trading incurs higher transaction costs. Even when you use a dis-
count broker (described in Chapter 8), the commissions you pay to buy
or sell securities are higher (as a percentage of the amount invested)
than what a fund company pays. Note two exceptions to the rule that
individual security purchases cost too much:
• You can purchase government bonds directly from the Federal
Reserve without charge.
• Deep-discount brokers (see Chapter 8) can be quite cheap for
wealthy investors making large purchases.
 Individual stocks offer less likelihood of diversification. Unless you
have several hundred thousand dollars or more to invest in dozens of
different securities, you probably can’t afford to develop a diversified
portfolio. For example, when investing in stocks, you should hold stock
in companies belonging to different industries, in different companies
within an industry, and so on. Not properly diversifying adds to the risk
of losing your shirt.
61
Chapter 4: Selecting Your Own Stocks and Bonds

 Individual stocks bring more accounting and bookkeeping chores.
When you invest in individual securities outside retirement accounts,
you must keep track of your purchase and dividend history (if you 
reinvest them). Every time you sell a specific security, you must report
that transaction on your tax return.
Even if you pay someone else to complete your tax return, you still have
the hassle of keeping track of statements and receipts. (On the plus side,
however, you control selling decisions with individual securities; with
funds, managers who trade can lead to capital gains distributions for
you. As I discuss in Chapter 9, you can select mutual funds that are tax
friendly for your situation, including funds that are managed, so as to
minimize or even eliminate capital gains distributions.)
Get the facts on dividend reinvestment
plans (DRIPs) for individual stocks
Increasing numbers of corporations have plans (known as DRIPs) that allow
existing shareholders of stock to reinvest their dividends in more shares of
stock without paying brokerage commissions. In some cases, companies
allow you to make additional cash purchases of more shares of stock, also
commission free. This interesting spin on investing may sound attractive, but
it’s often more bother than it’s worth: In order to qualify for most DRIPs, you
must generally have already bought some shares of stock in the company.
Ideally, you bought these initial shares through a discount broker to keep
your commission burden as low as possible.
Although DRIPs reduce your stock commissions on future purchases, they
have their shortcomings:
 Investing in DRIPs is only available and cost-effective for investments
held outside retirement accounts. As I discuss in Chapter 3, most people
should invest as much as possible through the retirement accounts that
are available to them.
 You need to complete a lot of paperwork to invest in a number of differ-
ent companies’ DRIP stock plans. Life is too short to bother with these
plans for this reason alone.
 Some companies that offer these plans are hungry — for whatever
reason. They need to drum up support for their stock. These invest-
ments may not be the best ones for the future.
 DRIP plans don’t eliminate fees. You still pay fees to buy the initial
shares of stock, and many DRIP plans charge nominal fees for additional
transactions and services.
62
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

Taking these shortcomings into account, you’re better off in the long run
using professional money managers, such as those available through the 
best no-load, cost-efficient mutual funds.
Understand the psychology 
of selecting stocks
Some folks just don’t, won’t, or can’t enjoy having all their money tied up in
mutual funds. Some people say that funds are, well, kind of boring. It’s true
that following the trials, tribulations, successes, and failures of a favorite
company can provide you plenty of excitement (sometimes more than you
want). A fund, on the other hand, is a little more abstract. You pour money
into it and don’t have specific corporate dramas to follow.
Over the years, among investors who prefer to have at least some of their
portfolios in individual securities, I’ve noticed some common characteristics:
 The boaster: You enjoy going to parties and telling of your successes in
the stock market. Although the thought has never (hopefully) crossed
your mind of sending copies of a brokerage statement out to friends and
relatives, you’ve been known on more than a few occasions to offer
unsolicited stock tips and investment advice.
 The controller: You hate delegating jobs to others, especially important
ones, because no one does as good a job as you do. Investing much 
or all of your money in mutual funds and leaving all the investment 
decisions to the fund manager won’t make you a happy camper. You
believe that you can sidestep a market slide and get back in before
prices skyrocket.
 The free spirit: You’re the type who says, “I don’t care if there are 
trillions invested in mutual funds. I don’t care if everyone’s using word
processors rather than typewriters.” You like to be just a little bit differ-
ent and independent.
How to Pick Your Own Stocks and Bonds
If you really want to invest in individual stocks and bonds, I suggest that you
limit your purchase of individual securities to no more than 20 percent of the
total money you’ve invested in stocks and bonds (including those you’ve
invested in via mutual funds). Be realistic as to why you’re investing in them.
And before you plunk down too much money in stocks and bonds of your
63
Chapter 4: Selecting Your Own Stocks and Bonds

own choosing, remember the sage words of Jack Bogle, who’s often called the
mutual fund investor’s best friend:
“Attempting to build an investment program around a handful of individual
securities is, for all but the most exceptional investors, a fool’s errand . . .
Specific stock bets should be made, if at all, in small portions, and more for
the excitement of the game than for the profit.”
Yes, Bogle was the founder and former CEO of a large mutual fund company,
Vanguard. But, no, his comments aren’t self-serving: Vanguard also operates 
a discount brokerage company that handles individual securities trades for
customers who want to do them.
In the long haul, you’re not going to earn higher returns than full-time profes-
sional money managers who invest in the securities of the same type and risk
level that you are. As with hiring a contractor for home remodeling, you need
to do your homework to find good fund managers. Even if you think that you
can do as well as the best, remember that even superstar money managers
like Peter Lynch have beaten the market averages by only a few percentage
points per year.
In my experience, more than a few otherwise smart, fun-loving people choose
to invest in individual securities because they think that they’re smarter or
luckier than the rest. If you’re like most people, I can safely say that, in the
long run, your individually selected stocks and bonds won’t outperform
those of a full-time investment professional.
I’ve noticed a distinct contrast between the sexes on this issue. Perhaps
because of differences in how people are raised, testosterone levels, or what-
ever, men tend to have more of a problem taming their egos and admitting
that they’re better off turning the stock and bond selection over to a pro.
Maybe this trait is genetically linked to not wanting to ask for directions!
Before you set out to compete in the investment world, get smarter and
wiser. My book, Investing For Dummies, 4th Edition (Wiley), explains how to
analyze company financial statements and compare and select stocks and
bonds as well as use the best investment research sources such as Value
Line. Also, don’t overlook the opportunity to piggyback from all the research
and knowledge of the best money managers. By using the lists of best funds
recommended in this book, you can use those funds’ reports to figure out
what stocks and bonds some of the most talented money managers in the
world are buying. (Note: The listing of a fund’s portfolio still could be several
months out of date because of the way funds issue their reports.)

Chapter 4: Selecting Your Own Stocks and Bonds
Should you join an investment club?
Investment clubs are a little bit like having your
own hands-on mutual fund. Each club member
chips in some money. Then the group gets
together for periodic meetings to discuss stocks
and to make investment decisions. (Although
investment clubs could, of course, select other
investments, such as bonds, most clubs choose
stocks.)
These groups can be valuable as an educa-
tional forum if you utilize good information
sources. If the group members are somewhat
clueless and the meetings are rambling, these
groups can end up degenerating into the blind
leading the blind.
Investment clubs may have social or hobby
value (which are most clubs’ major benefits),
but they aren’t likely to help your finances much.
In fact, they can hurt your checkbook more than
they help:
 The members of the vast majority of invest-
ment clubs are a bunch of part-time ama-
teurs. You could end up making some real
boneheaded decisions and losing money
(or not making nearly as much as you would
if you’d been in some good mutual funds).
 It’s highly unlikely that everyone in the
group is in the same tax situation. Thus, the
club’s investments may work for some
members’ tax situations but not for others’.
Beware of stockbrokers who’ve been known to
participate in investment clubs and volunteer as
leaders as a so-called business development
tool. Although their participation may be harm-
less, more often than not, these brokers have a
hidden agenda to reel in new clients to whom
they’ve been able to demonstrate their vast
investment knowledge.
Consider forming a financial reading club and
discussion group rather than an investment
club. You can get together and discuss financial
periodicals, books, and investment strategies.
This way, you can advance your level of finan-
cial knowledge, find out about new resources
from others, and enjoy the fun, camaraderie,
and other benefits that come from doing things
in a group.
Better yet, join a bowling league or a softball
team and leave the investing to fund managers!

Exchange-Traded Funds and 
Other Fund Lookalikes
In This Chapter
 Making sense of the hoopla of exchange-traded funds
 Understanding unit investment trusts
 Creating your own customized funds
T
he hallmarks of the investment and economic system are constant
change, innovation, and choice. Index mutual funds, which track a partic-
ular market index (see Chapter 9) and the best of which feature low costs,
have now been around for decades. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) represent 
a twist on index funds — ETFs trade like stocks do and offer some potential
advantages over funds. However, some cheerleaders pitching ETFs gloss over
drawbacks to ETFs and fail to disclose their agenda in promoting ETFs. Some
other fund wannabes compete for your investment dollars too. This chapter
offers the straight scoop on these alternatives.
Understanding Exchange-Traded Funds
For many years after their introduction in the 1970s, index mutual funds got
little respect and money. Various pundits and those folks with a vested finan-
cial interest in protecting the status quo, such as firms charging high fees for
money management, heaped criticism on index funds because they suppos-
edly produced mediocre returns. Investors who’ve used index funds have
been quite happy to experience their funds typically outperforming about 70
percent of the actively managed funds over extended time periods.
In recent years, increasing numbers of financial firms have developed
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs are, essentially, index funds with one
major difference: They trade like stocks on a stock exchange. The first ETF
was created and traded on the American Stock Exchange in 1993 and known

as a Spider (it tracked the Standard & Poor’s 500 index). Now hundreds of
ETFs trade worth about $500 billion — a large sum indeed — but that’s less
than 5 percent of the total invested in mutual funds.
Before you decide to invest in ETFs, take a moment to read this section. It
explains the advantages and disadvantages of investing in ETFs and helps
you wade through the many ETFs to find the best one for you.
Understanding the real ETF advantages
Like index funds, the promise of ETFs is low management fees. I say promise
because when evaluating ETFs, you must remember that the companies 
creating and selling ETFs, such as State Street and Barclays (with one excep-
tion), are doing it to make a nice profit for their firm. Although the best index
funds charge annual fees around just 0.1 to 0.2 percent, the vast majority of
ETFs charge fees much greater than that.
Take a look at Table 5-1 for an analysis that I recently conducted of ETF
expense ratios.
Table 5-1

The vast majority of ETFs have expense ratios far higher than the best index
funds. I compare the best index funds with the best ETFs (which do have low
expense ratios) in the section, “Identifying the best ETFs,” later in this chapter.
68
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

In addition to possible slightly lower expenses, the best ETFs have one possi-
ble additional advantage over traditional index funds: Because ETFs may not
be forced to redeem shares to cash and recognize taxable gains (which can
happen with an index fund), they may be tax friendlier for non-retirement
account investors. (Note: ETFs do have to sometimes sell and buy new hold-
ings as adjustments are made to the underlying index that an ETF tracks.)
If you can’t meet the minimum investment amounts for index funds (which
are typically several thousand dollars), you face no minimums when buying
an ETF. However, you must factor in their brokerage costs to buy and sell ETF
shares, and be sure that those fees don’t greatly boost your costs. For exam-
ple, if you pay a $10 transaction fee through an online broker to buy $1,000
worth of an ETF, $10 may not sound like a lot but it represents 1.0 percent of
your investment and wipes out the supposed cost advantage of investing in
an ETF. Because of the brokerage costs, ETFs aren’t a good vehicle for
investors who seek to make regular monthly investments.
Eyeing ETF drawbacks
Meanwhile, some of the drawbacks to ETFs include the following:
 Three-day settlement waiting period: A possible disadvantage with
ETFs is that like stocks, you have a three-day settlement process when
selling shares. So, for example, if you sell an ETF on Monday, you won’t
have the proceeds to invest into a regular mutual fund until Thursday
(this wouldn’t be a problem if you’re going back into another ETF or
buying a stock — because a purchase order placed on Monday wouldn’t
settle until Thursday). If you’re out of the market for several days, the
market price can move significantly higher, wiping out any supposed
savings from a low-expense ratio.
 Potential fees for dividend and capital gain reinvestments: With a tra-
ditional mutual fund you can without cost reinvest dividend and capital
gains distributions into more shares of the fund. However, with an ETF,
you may have to pay for this service with an ETF or it may not be avail-
able through the broker that you use.
 Disproportionate amount of stocks: One problem with a number of the
indexes that ETFs track (and with some index funds) is that certain
stocks make up a disproportionately large share of the index. For exam-
ple, I don’t care for the Standard & Poor’s 500 index because each of the
500 stocks’ composition in the index is driven by each stock’s portion of
total market value. Check out Table 5-2 that shows the composition of
the index at the end of 1999. This list represented a who’s who of many
overpriced technology stocks that subsequently got clobbered in the
early 2000s bear market.

 Invested segments too narrow: Nearly all of the newer ETFs coming 
out invest in narrow segments, such as one specific industry or one 
foreign country. As with sector mutual funds (see Chapter 12), such
funds undermine the diversification value of fund investing and tend to
have relatively high fees. Morningstar, an investment research company,
says, “. . . ETFs offer new opportunities to sap returns by racking up
transaction costs and/or chasing short-term trends.”
Seeing the pros and cons of trading ETFs
One supposed advantage of trading ETFs is that, unlike the regular index
mutual funds that I recommend in this book, you can trade (buy or sell) ETFs
throughout the day when the stock market is open. When you buy or sell an
index mutual fund, your transaction occurs at the closing price on the day
that you place the trade (if the trade is placed before the market closes).
Sure, the freedom sounds alluring, but consider a few drawbacks:
70
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

 Timing your moves in and out of the stocks: Being able to trade in and
out of an ETF during the trading day isn’t a necessity, nor is it even a
good practice. In my experience of working with individual investors,
most people find it both nerve-racking and futile to try to time their
moves in and out of stocks with the inevitable fluctuations that take
place during the trading day. In theory, traders want to believe that they
can buy at relatively low prices and sell at relatively high prices, but
that’s far easier said than done.
 Paying a brokerage commission every time you buy or sell shares: With
no-load index funds, you generally don’t pay commissions to buy and sell
(although some funds do require you to pay a small transaction fee that
helps offset the trading costs of buying and selling securities). But with
ETFs, because you’re actually placing a trade on a stock exchange, you
pay a commission every time you trade. For example, if you buy an ETF
with a seemingly low expense ratio of 0.1 percent and you pay $10 to trade
the ETF through an online broker, that’s equal to paying two years’ worth
of management fees if you invest $5,000 in the ETF!
 Figuring out if the current price on an ETF is above or below the
actual value of the securities it holds: Because ETFs fluctuate in price
based on supply and demand, when placing a trade during the trading
day, you face the complication of trying to determine whether the cur-
rent price on an ETF is above or below the actual value. With an index
fund, you know that the price at which your trade was executed equals
the exact market value of the securities it holds.
71
Chapter 5: Exchange-Traded Funds and Other Fund Lookalikes
Beware of “financial advisers” in love with ETFs
I began work as a financial adviser in 1990. I was
just about the only practitioner who worked
solely on an hourly basis. Most of the fee-based
advisers at that time managed their client’s port-
folios by using mutual funds. I was struck by the
fact that many advisers didn’t use or recom-
mend low-cost index funds. In speaking with
some of these advisers, I got the sense that they
were somewhat threatened by index funds
because the investing process was so simplified
that clients might question the value in paying
the adviser an ongoing fee of about 1 percent to
manage their money among funds.
Interestingly, some advisers today boast that
they use ETFs as the investment vehicle to
manage their client’s portfolio. Ironically, they
crow about the low cost of ETFs. Why do some
advisers now embrace and tout ETFs when they
didn’t advocate index funds? ETFs are compli-
cated and new enough that advisers feel safer
using them and not worry about having clients
feel that they could do this on their own.
Advisers who charge ongoing management fees
while using ETFs aren’t performing low-cost
investment management. If the ETFs they’re
using average about 0.5 percent in annual fees,
paying the adviser 1 percent per year on top of
that to shift your money around among various
ETFs triples your costs! See Chapter 22 for the
right way to find a good adviser.

Because ETFs trade like stocks, you can use limit order and stop loss orders
as well as sell them short or trade them on margin. I generally don’t recom-
mend these strategies for nonprofessional investors.
Identifying the best ETFs
For the vast majority of investors, you don’t need to complicate your lives 
by investing in ETFs. Only use them if you’re a more advanced investor who
understands index funds and you have found a superior ETF to an index fund
you’re interested in.
Be sure to check whether the ETF you’re considering is selling at a premium
or discount to its net asset value (you can find this information on the ETF
provider’s Web site after the market’s close each business day). I strongly
encourage you to employ the buy-and-hold mentality that I advocate through-
out this book — don’t hop in and out of ETFs. You should also only buy the
ETFs that track the broader market indexes and that have the lowest expense
ratios. Avoid those that track narrow industry groups or single, smaller 
countries. See Chapters 10 through 13 for specific ETFs that I like for specific
situations.
If you’re truly interested in investing in ETFs and you’re a more advanced
investor, make sure that you know which funds are the best ETFs. The best
ETFs, like the best index funds, have low expense ratios. My top picks among
the leading providers of ETFs include the following:
 Vanguard: Historically, Vanguard has been the low-cost leader with
index funds and now has the lowest cost with their ETFs as well. If
you’re interested in finding out more about ETFs, be sure to examine
Vanguard’s ETFs. Vanguard also offers the Admiral Share class for bigger
balance customers ($100K+) of its index funds that match the low
expense ratio on their ETFs. (www.vanguard.com; % 800-662-7447)
 Wisdom Tree: Developed by Wharton business professor Jeremy Siegel,
this new family of indexes is weighted toward stocks paying higher divi-
dends. These ETFs have higher fees but offer a broad family of index
choices for investors seeking higher-dividend-paying stocks. Note: Other
ETF providers do offer a number of value-oriented and higher-dividend-
paying stock funds. (www.wisdomtree.com; % 866-909-9473)
Two additional and large providers of ETFs include the following firms
(beware that many of their ETFs are pricey or too narrowly focused):

Mimicking Closed-End Funds: 
Unit Investment Trusts
Unit investment trusts (UITs) have much in common with closed-end funds
(discussed in Chapter 2). UITs take an amount of money (for example, $100
million) and buy a number of securities (such as 70 large-company United
States stocks) that meet the objectives of the UIT. Unlike a closed-end fund
(and mutual funds in general), however, a UIT does not make any changes to
its holdings over time — it simply holds the same, fixed portfolio. This hold-
ing of a diversified portfolio can be advantageous because it reduces trading
costs and possible tax bills.
With that said, UITs do suffer from the following major flaws:
 Significant upfront commissions: Brokers like to push UITs for the 
same reason that they like to pitch load mutual funds — for the juicy
commission that they ultimately deduct upfront from your investment.
Commissions are usually around 5 percent, so for every $10,000 that you
invest into a UIT, $500 goes out of your investment and into the broker’s
pocket. Although UITs do have ongoing fees, their fees tend to be lower
than those of most actively managed mutual funds — they’re typically in
the neighborhood of 0.2 percent per year. As an alternative, you can buy
excellent no-load funds (see Chapter 7), which, because you’re buying
the fund directly from an investment company and without the involve-
ment of a broker, charge you no commission. The best no-load funds
also have reasonable management fees, and some charge even less than
UITs charge (such as the index funds that I discuss in Chapter 9).
 Lack of liquidity: Especially in the first few years after a particular UIT
is issued, you won’t readily find an active market in which you can easily
sell your UIT. In the event that you can find someone who’s interested in
buying a UIT that you’re interested in selling, you may have to sell the
UIT at a discount from its actual market value at the time.
 Lack of ongoing management oversight: Because UITs buy and hold a
fixed set of securities until the UIT is liquidated (years down the road),
they’re more likely to get stuck holding some securities that end up
worthless. For example, compared to the best bond mutual funds (see
Chapter 11), bond UITs have had a greater tendency to end up holding
bonds in companies that go bankrupt.

Assembling an Online Package:
Customizing Funds Online
On some Web sites, various services pitch that you can invest in a chosen
basket of stocks for a low fee — and without the high taxes and high fees that
come with mutual fund investing. Like most political “Vote for me and not my
opponent” ads, these services misrepresent both their own merits and the
potential drawbacks of funds.
These “create your own funds” services pitch their investment products as a
superior alternative to mutual funds. One such service calls its investment
vehicles folios, charging you $29.95 per month ($299 if paid annually) to
invest in folios, each of which can hold a few dozen stocks that are selected
from the universe of stocks that this service makes available. The fee covers
trading in your folios that may only occur during two time windows each day
that the stock market is open. The folio service claims that orders that are
placed between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. “are processed starting at 2 p.m.;” orders
that are placed between 2 p.m. and 11 a.m. “are processed starting at 11 a.m.”
So, in addition to the burden of managing your own portfolio of stocks, you
have virtually no control over the timing of your trades during the trading
day. (You can place traditional orders at whatever time the market is open
but you’ll be assessed an additional fee of $3.95 per trade.)
The site also says, “Mutual funds impose fees that can be very high — and hard
to calculate.” I agree with that statement. However, without doing too much
homework, an investor can easily avoid high-fee funds. For example, an investor
can invest in the best index funds for an annual fee of 0.2 percent per year or
less. Thus, an investor would need to have in excess of $150,000 invested
through this folio service to come out ahead in terms of the explicit fees.
In addition, you need to be aware of additional fees. One folio service’s Web
site says (in fine print, of course) that it “. . . does charge for certain special
services and does receive payment for order flow.” You must be ready to
shell out the dough if you
 Want to wire money out of your account — $30
 Need a copy of a prior statement or transaction — $5
 Hold any restricted securities (which are subject to SEC Rule 144) — $75
 Close out an account — $50
74
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

The site further warns, “Note: These are today’s prices and fees, which are
subject to change periodically.”
You’re simply not going to get the same level of service (and comfort) 
when dealing with a Web-site-based service as you do when dealing with 
the leading fund companies that I discuss in this book. The companies that I
recommend have trained representatives available by phone. Understanding
and evaluating the performance of self-created funds is difficult, and unlike
mutual funds, these funds have no standards or easily accessible services
that report and track the performance of your customized folio (see Chapter
15 for more information on adjusting your portfolio).
It seems to me that folio services are geared toward those people who want
to hold individual stocks, who trade a lot, and who seek to cap their annual
trading costs. Although I prefer investing in the best mutual funds, you can
invest in stocks of your own choosing — as long as you do so with a long-
term perspective. But if you were going to simply buy and hold individual
stocks, why would you want to pay a Web-site-based service $299 per year?

W
ealthier investors with large amounts to invest (typically well into the
six figures) usually have more choices when it comes to investment
vehicles. Some financial advisers and money management firms pitch alterna-
tives to mutual funds to these folks.
The unbelievably wide variety of mutual funds enables you to invest in every-
thing from short-term money market securities to corporate bonds, United
States (U.S.) and international stocks, precious metals companies, and even
real estate funds. Although funds can fill many investing needs — as I discuss
in Chapter 1 — you may be interested in and benefit from directly investing in
things such as real estate, your own business, and many other investments.
In recent years, hedge funds have been proliferating and promising high
returns with less risk. As with all sales pitches, you must separate fact from
fiction and hype. This chapter can help you do just that if you’re rolling in the
dough. Other types of privately managed investment accounts, such as wrap
accounts, exist that have some things in common with mutual funds. The fol-
lowing sections provide some background that you need to know if you’re
going to consider these fund alternatives.
Hedge Funds: Extremes of Costs and Risks
Hedge funds, historically an investment reserved for big-ticket investors, are
seemingly like mutual funds in that they typically invest in stocks and bonds.
They have the added glamour and allure, however, of taking significant risks

and gambles with their investments. Hedge funds may take risks by purchas-
ing derivatives (see Chapter 2), or they may bet on the fall in price of particu-
lar securities by selling the securities short. (When you short sell, you borrow
a security from a broker, sell it, and then hope to buy it back later at a lower
price.) Some hedge funds even invest in other hedge funds.
This section takes a closer look at hedge funds and gives you a clear idea of
what hedge funds are and what you need to know and do before you consider
investing in one.
Getting the truth about hedge funds
Although hedge funds have recently been the buzz in some investment cir-
cles and some wealthier investors have been dropping money into them, they
may not be the best choice for you. Hedge funds are typically a far riskier
investment than your typical mutual fund. What’s the hidden truth about
these funds? The following list highlights some of hedge fund’s dangers:
Hedge funds have a much higher risk than mutual funds
When a hedge fund manager bets right, he can produce high returns. When
he doesn’t, however, the fund manager can have his head handed to him on
an expensive silver platter. With short selling, because the value of the secu-
rity that was sold short can rise an unlimited amount, the potential loss from
buying it back at a much higher price can be horrendous. And even the most
experienced investing professionals can also lose a pile of money in no time
when they invest in derivatives. Hedge fund managers have also been clob-
bered when a previously fast rising commodity like natural gas or copper
futures plunges in value.
A number of hedge funds have gone belly up when their managers guessed
wrong. In other words, their investments did so poorly that investors in the
fund lost all their money. As I discuss in Chapter 2, the odds of this happen-
ing with a mutual fund — particularly from one of the larger, more estab-
lished companies — are nil.
Hedge funds have much higher fees than mutual funds
Hedge funds charge an annual management fee of about 1 to 2 percent and 
a performance fee, which typically amounts to a whopping 20 percent of a
fund’s profits. Veteran investment observer Jack Bogle said of hedge funds
and the high fees that are extracted and paid to the hedge fund’s managers
(and not their customers), “Hedge funds are a compensation strategy not an
investment strategy.”
78
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

Hedge funds aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny
A Forbes article on the hedge fund industry entitled, “The Sleaziest Show On
Earth” referred to the industry as, “. . . a business rife with exorbitant fees,
phony numbers, and outright thievery.” If that’s still not enough to convince you
from the perspective of one of the nation’s best business magazines that caters
to those affluent enough to invest in such funds, consider this: Forbes went on to
say, “Hedge funds exist in a lawless and risky realm, exempt from the rules gov-
erning mutual funds, equities, and most other investments. Hedge funds aren’t
even required to keep audited books — and many don’t. These risky funds often
are guilty of inadequate disclosure of costs, overvaluation of holdings to goose
reported performance and manager pay, and cozy ties between funds and bro-
kers that often shortchange investors.” For more about insufficient regulatory
oversight of hedge funds, please see the “Investigating hedge funds” section.
Hedge funds have lower returns compared to mutual funds
Interestingly, one tracking index that I’ve found for the industry presents an
unflattering perspective on industry returns. Created in 2003, Greenwich
Alternative Investments has an index of the returns of hedge funds that insti-
tutional investors can invest in. Here’s how the hedge fund returns stack up
for that four-year period versus major mutual fund indexes:
 The Annualized Returns for 2003–2006 for Greenwich Investable 
Hedge Fund Index was 10.7 percent.
 By comparison, over this same four-year period, diversified U.S. mutual
funds returned an average of 15.9 percent per year and diversified for-
eign stock funds returned 23.9 percent per year according to
Morningstar.
If you want riskier investments you can find aggressive mutual funds, or you
can buy mutual funds on margin through a brokerage account, meaning that
you make a down payment but control a larger investment (such as when you
purchase a home with a mortgage). See Chapter 14 for more about the risks
and rewards of buying on margin.
Investigating hedge funds
Unfortunately, hedge funds aren’t subject to the same regulatory scrutiny
from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that mutual funds are.
However, if you go against my advice and consider investing in a hedge fund,
I suggest that you adhere to the advice the SEC offers. The following guide-
lines for evaluating hedge funds can help.
79
Chapter 6: Hedge Funds and Other Managed Alternatives

Read all the important documents
Take the time to read the fund’s prospectus or offering memorandum and all
related materials. Doing so discloses the fees, managers, and overall invest-
ment strategy.
Make sure you understand the level of risk involved in the fund’s investment
strategies and ensure that they’re suitable to your personal investing goals,
time horizons, and risk tolerance. As with any investment, the higher the
potential returns, the higher the risks you must assume.
Understand how a fund’s assets are valued
Funds of hedge funds and hedge funds may invest in highly illiquid securities
(not easily and quickly converted into cash) that may be difficult to value.
Moreover, many hedge funds give themselves significant discretion in valuing
securities. You should understand a fund’s valuation process and know the
extent to which a fund’s securities are valued by independent sources.
Ask questions about fees
Fees impact your return on investment. Hedge funds typically charge an asset
management fee of 1 to 2 percent of assets, plus a performance fee of 20 per-
cent of a hedge fund’s profits. A performance fee could motivate a hedge fund
manager to take greater risks in the hope of generating a larger return. Funds
of hedge funds typically charge a fee for managing your assets, and some may
also include a performance fee based on profits.
These fees are charged in addition to any fees paid to the underlying hedge
funds. If you invest in hedge funds through a fund of hedge funds, you’ll pay
two layers of fees: the fees of the fund of hedge funds and the fees charged by
the underlying hedge funds.
Understand any limitations on redeeming your shares
Hedge funds typically limit opportunities to redeem, or cash in, your shares
(for example, to four times a year), and often impose a “lockup” period of one
year or more, during which you can’t cash in your shares. These should be
disclosed in the hedge fund’s prospectus.
Research the backgrounds of hedge fund managers
Know with whom you’re investing. Make sure hedge fund managers are quali-
fied to manage your money, and find out whether they have a disciplinary his-
tory within the securities industry. You can get this information (and more) by
reviewing the adviser’s Form ADV. You can search for and view a firm’s Form
80
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

ADV by using the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure (IAPD) Web site
(www.adviserinfo.sec.gov/IAPD/Content/IapdMain/iapd_SiteMap.
aspx).
You also can get copies of Form ADV for individual advisers and firms from
the investment adviser, the SEC’s Public Reference Room, or (for advisers
with less than $25 million in assets under management) the state securities
regulator where the adviser’s principal place of business is located. If you
don’t find the investment adviser firm in the SEC’s IAPD database, be sure to
call your state securities regulator or search the NASD’s BrokerCheck data-
base for any information they may have.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions
You’re entrusting your money to someone else. You should know where your
money is going, who is managing it, how it’s being invested, how you can get
it back, what protections are placed on your investment, and what your
rights are as an investor.
The SEC goes on to provide the following comments and suggested protec-
tions for those purchasing a hedge fund:
 Hedge fund investors don’t receive all the federal and state law pro-
tections that commonly apply to most registered investments. For
example, you won’t get the same level of disclosures from a hedge fund
that you’ll get from registered investments. Without the disclosures that
the securities laws require for most registered investments, it can be
quite difficult to verify representations you may receive from a hedge
fund. You should also be aware that, while the SEC may conduct exami-
nations of any hedge fund manager that is registered as an investment
adviser under the Investment Advisers Act, the SEC and other securities
regulators generally have limited ability to check routinely on hedge
fund activities.
 The SEC can take action against a hedge fund that defrauds investors
and has brought a number of fraud cases involving hedge funds.
Commonly in these cases, hedge fund advisers misrepresented their
experience and the fund’s track record. Other cases were classic “Ponzi
schemes,” where early investors were paid off to make the scheme look
legitimate. In some of the cases, the hedge funds sent phony account
statements to investors to camouflage the fact that their money had
been stolen. That’s why it’s extremely important to thoroughly check out
every aspect of any hedge fund you might consider as an investment.
 If you encounter a problem with your hedge fund or fund of hedge funds,
you can send your complaint by using the SEC’s online complaint form
at www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml.

Chapter 6: Hedge Funds and Other Managed Alternatives

Wrap (Or Managed) Accounts: 
Hefty Fees
Brokerage firms (Prudential, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith Barney,
PaineWebber, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter) that used to sell investment
products on commission now offer investment management services for 
an ongoing fee rather than commissions. This change is an improvement 
for investors because it reduces some of the conflicts of interest caused 
by commissions.
Wrap accounts, or managed accounts, go by a variety of names, but they’re the
same in one crucial way: For the privilege of investing your money through
their chosen money managers, they charge you a fixed percentage of the
assets that they’re managing for you. These accounts are quite similar to
mutual funds except that the accounts don’t have the same regulatory and
reporting requirements as do mutual funds.
Wrap accounts management expenses are high. In fact, they’re up to 3 percent
per year of assets under management. Remember that stocks have historically
returned about 10 percent per year before taxes. So if you’re paying 2 to 3 
percent per year to have the money managed in stocks, 20 to 30 percent of
your return (before taxes) is siphoned off. You pay a good chunk of money 
in taxes on your 10 percent return. So a 2 to 3 percent wrap fee actually 
ends up depleting up to half of the profits that you get to keep after you 
pay taxes — ouch!
No-load (commission-free) mutual funds offer investors access to the nation’s
best investment managers for a fraction of the cost of wrap accounts. You
can invest in dozens of top-performing funds for an annual expense of 1 per-
cent per year or less. Many excellent funds are available for far less — 0.1 to
0.5 percent annually.
So why do people purchase these funds if they’re such a poor investment?
Plain and simple. Brokerage firms hoodwink investors into paying so much
more for access to investment managers with clever marketing — slick, seduc-
tive, deceptive, misleading pitches that often include some outright lies.
The following are the key components of the brokers’ pitch for wrap
accounts — and then the real truth behind the pitch:
 “You’re accessing investment managers who normally don’t take money
from small-fry investors like you.”
82
Part II: Evaluating Alternatives to Funds 

Not a single study shows that the performance of money managers has
anything to do with the minimum account size they handle. Besides, 
no-load mutual funds hire many of the same managers who work at
other money management firms. In fact, Vanguard, the nation’s largest
exclusively load-free investment firm, contracts out to hire money man-
agers who typically handle only multimillion-dollar private-client
accounts to run many of their funds. A number of other mutual funds are
managed by private money managers who typically have high entrance
requirements for their individual private clients.
 “You’ll earn a higher rate of return, so the fees are worth it.”
Part of the bait brokers use to hook you into a wrap account is the won-
derful rates of returns that these accounts supposedly generate. You
could’ve earned 18 to 25 percent per year, they say, had you invested
with the “Star of Yesterday” investment management company. The key
word here is “could’ve.” History is history. As I discuss in Chapter 7, in
the money management business, many of yesterday’s winners become
either tomorrow’s losers or its mediocre performers.
You must also remember that, unlike mutual funds, whose performance
records are audited by the SEC, wrap account performance records
include marketing hype. The SEC doesn’t audit wrap accounts. The most
common ploy is showing the performance of only selected accounts —
which turn out to be (you got it) only the ones that performed the best!
The expenses you pay to have your investments managed have an enor-
mous impact on the long-term growth of your money. If you can have
your money managed for 0.5 to 1 percent per year rather than 2 to 3 
percent, you have an enormous performance advantage already.
 “A wrap account is tailored to your personal needs.”
Thousands of different mutual funds are available out there, covering
every possible combination of investments and degree of risk. You can
find a mutual fund and develop a portfolio of funds that meets your
objectives and risk tolerance. Some wrap accounts have only funds that
are managed by a particular brokerage firm, making it impossible for
you to invest in the best from the universe of all funds.
Moreover, if your portfolio ever begins to drift from your objectives,
buying into a new mutual fund is much easier than ending a relationship
with a broker who sold you the wrap account.
 “There’s little difference in cost between wrap accounts and mutual funds.”
The worst and most inefficient mutual funds can have total costs
approaching that of a typical wrap account. But you’re informed, right?
You’re not going to invest in the highest-cost funds. Chapters 10 through
12 detail which mutual funds offer both top performance and low cost.
83
Chapter 6: Hedge Funds and Other Managed Alternatives

Private Money Managers: One-on-One
In the world of money management, added benefits — snob appeal and ego
stroking for many — come with having your own private money manager.
First of all, you generally need big bucks, often $1 million or more, to gain
entrance. A private money management company allows you to sit down and
visit with a personal representative and perhaps even the investment man-
ager. The company may lavish you with attention and glossy brochures. You
hear how your money not only receives individualized and personalized
treatment but also how superb the investment manager’s performance has
been in prior years.
Even if you have big bucks, you probably don’t need a private money man-
ager for two simple reasons:
 The best, average, and worst private money managers earn returns
comparable to their counterparts in the mutual fund business. And as 
I mention earlier in this chapter, some mutual fund firms contract out to
or are themselves private money managers. This gives you the best of
both worlds: the SEC oversight of a mutual fund and access to some
money managers that you may not otherwise be able to use.
 You pay high fees to use these money managers’ services. One bank
CEO, speaking at a banking conference about future sources of revenue
growth, said private money management for the wealthy, along with the
credit card business, are two “high-return, low-risk businesses” in the
financial world. Knowing that you’re getting soaked with high fees like
the average credit card customer shouldn’t make you feel so special
about having a private money manager!
If you’re considering investing through private investment firms, make sure
that you
 Ask to see independently audited rates of return. Private managers’
holdings and performances aren’t subject to the same scrutiny and
reporting as mutual funds are.
 Check many references.
 Compare the performance and costs of the private money manager with
similar mutual funds in this book.
For more ideas about evaluating money managers, see the criteria for select-
ing mutual funds in Chapter 7.

which to conduct your fund investing.

hen you go camping in the wilderness, you can do a number of things
to maximize your odds of happiness and success. You can take maps
to stay on course, good food to keep you nourished, proper clothing to stay
dry and warm, and some first-aid stuff in case something awful happens, such
as an outbreak of mosquitoes. But no matter how much advance preparation
you do, you still may not have the best of times. You may get sick, trip over a
rock and break your leg, or face inclement weather.
And so it is with mutual funds. Although funds can help you reach your 
financial goals, they come with no guarantees. You can, however, use a
number of simple, common-sense criteria to greatly increase your chances 
of investment success. The issues in this chapter are the main ones you
should consider when trying to separate the funds most likely to succeed
from those most likely to perform poorly. The mutual funds that I recommend
in Chapters 10 through 12 meet these criteria.
Evaluating Gain-Eating Costs
The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade association, con-
ducted a survey that asked mutual fund buyers what info they reviewed
about a fund before purchasing it. Fifth on the list, mentioned by only 43 per-
cent of the respondents, were fees and expenses. Therefore, the majority of
fund buyers surveyed — a whopping 57 percent — did not examine the fees
and expenses for the funds that they bought.

Additionally, only 27 percent of fund buyers surveyed bothered to look at
how much of a load or sales charge was levied by the fund. At the other end
of the spectrum, past fund performance was the most cited information
reviewed by fund buyers (with 75 percent considering).
Such survey results don’t surprise me. I’ve witnessed investors looking first —
and sometimes only — at the prior performance of a fund while completely
ignoring fees. Doing so is generally a major mistake.
The charges you pay to buy or sell a fund and the ongoing fund-operating
expenses have a big impact on the rate of return you ultimately earn on your
investments because fees are deducted from your investment returns. All
other things being equal, high fees and other expenses depress your returns.
You can and should examine a fund’s expenses and fees before you buy into
it. In contrast, past performance is actually a relatively poor indicator of a
fund’s likely future returns. (Later in this chapter, I discuss how many of yes-
terday’s star funds turn into tomorrow’s losers or mediocre performers.) You
just can’t know what tomorrow will bring.
Although you have no idea how much of a return you’ll make, you can find
out, before buying a fund, how much the fund is going to deduct in fees from
your account — both upfront (in the form of sales commissions) and ongoing
(in the form of fund operating expenses). Factor these known reductions in
returns into your fund-buying decisions.
Losing the load: Say no to commissions
When the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deregulated brokers’
commissions in 1975, the vast majority — more than 85 percent — of all
mutual funds were sold through brokers. The funds they sold are known as
load funds. Load simply means commission. When you purchase a load fund
through a broker (who often calls himself something other than a broker),
the broker is paid a commission (typically ranging from 4 percent to 8.5 per-
cent) out of the amount that you invest.
Thanks in part to the deregulation of brokerage commissions and to the 
technological revolution that’s taken place over the past generation and its
accompanying explosion of computer equipment, the growth of the no-load
(commission-free) mutual fund industry took off. Technology provided fund
companies with a cost-effective way to handle thousands of accounts for
folks like you who don’t have millions of dollars to invest. This fact also
enabled fund companies to sell no-load funds directly to the investor, bypass-
ing the broker and brokers’ commissions.
88
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Today, no-load funds account for the majority of investors’ mutual fund hold-
ings. Loads deducted from your investment money are an additional and
unnecessary cost when you’re in the market for the best mutual funds. The
best no-load funds are every bit as good, if not better, than the best load
funds. Today, you can stick with the no-load funds and keep more of your
investment dollars working for you.
Not surprisingly, those who have a vested interest in sales loads make a
number of misleading arguments in favor of funds that carry sales loads.
Over the years, I’ve heard quite a number of pitches from brokers. And in
counseling clients who come to me for advice, I frequently hear them repeat
arguments they’ve heard from investment salespeople to get them to pay a
sales charge when buying a mutual fund.
Be wary of brokers or planners pitching house brands — for example, a
Morgan Stanley (used to be called Morgan Stanley Dean Witter) broker rec-
ommending Morgan Stanley mutual funds. The fund industry scandal in the
early 2000s further shined the light on this problematic practice. Salespeople
often get higher commissions by pushing house brands.
Refuting myths about loads
Many brokers have much to say about paying loads, and you should be aware
of the lines they like to use the most. Here are a few examples:
 Don’t concern yourself with commissions — I get paid by the
mutual fund company. It’s true that the mutual fund company pays the
broker’s commission. But where do you think this money comes from?
From your investment dollars — that’s where. Brokers like to imply that
you’re effectively not paying for the commission because it comes from
the mutual fund company. Not so.
 You get what you pay for — load funds have better fund managers.
Bunk! Every objective study that I’ve seen shows that paying a load
doesn’t get you a better fund manager. Remember, loads wind up in the
pockets of the selling brokers and don’t go toward the management of
the fund.
What the studies have shown is that load funds underperform no-loads.
Why? It’s simple: Those commissions paid to the brokers come out of
the fund’s returns, although you may not know that from a fund’s pub-
lished rankings. Some published mutual fund rankings and ratings serv-
ices completely ignore sales commissions in their calculations of funds’
returns (see Chapter 18).
 No-loads have higher ongoing fees. Investment salespeople imply or
state that no-loads have to make it up somewhere if they aren’t charging
you a sales commission. Although this may sound logical, remember
that sales commissions go to the broker, not toward the expenses of
managing the fund. Fact is, the reverse is true: Load funds, on average,
have higher, not lower, annual operating expenses than no-load funds.
89
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Brokers will also say that no-loads have to spend gobs of money market-
ing themselves to investors and that these higher costs, inevitably, are
reflected in no-loads’ supposedly loftier annual operating expenses. This
sounds good from a broker’s perspective, but it’s false. Load funds also
have to spend money to market themselves, both to brokers and to the
investing public like you and me. And the better no-load companies,
such as those recommended in Chapter 8, benefit from the thousands of
investors who call, based on word-of-mouth or other recommendations
(such as through this book!), seeking to invest.
 No-loads have hidden costs. In this case, a half-truth doesn’t make a
whole. Both no-load and load funds incur brokerage transaction costs
when securities are bought and sold in the fund. These costs aren’t
really “hidden.” They’re disclosed in a fund’s Statement of Additional
Information (SAI), which is part of the fund’s prospectus; however,
they’re not included in the calculated annual operating costs for any
type of mutual fund, either load or no-load.
 No-loads are for do-it-yourself types. People who need help buy load
funds. This either/or mentality is trumpeted not only by investment 
brokers but also by some financial writers and others in the media who
sometimes parrot what brokers say to them. If you need advice, you
have other options. (Many brokers want you to believe that they’re your
only option.) One alternative is to hire a financial adviser and pay a fee
for her time to recommend specific no-load mutual funds. No-loads are
hardly just for do-it-yourself types (see Chapter 8 for the different types
of advisers you may hire), although you can see from this book (after
you finish reading it) that you have what it takes to just do it yourself.
 I’ll do a financial plan for you to determine your needs. Try as they
may, investment salespeople can’t perform objective, conflict-free finan-
cial planning. You should never pay for a “financial plan” that an invest-
ment salesperson has produced. Such financial plans end up being
nothing more than sales tools. And even if you get a broker’s financial
plan for free, the advice probably will be detrimental to your wealth.
The problem with sales loads is the power of self-interest (discussed in
Chapter 8). This issue is rarely talked about, but brokers’ self-interest is
even more important than the extra costs you pay. When you buy a load
fund through a salesperson, you miss out on the chance to objectively
assess whether you should buy a mutual fund at all. Maybe you’d be
better off paying debts or investing in something entirely different. But
salespeople almost never advise you to pay off your credit cards or your
mortgage — or to invest through your company’s retirement plan —
instead of buying an investment through them.
I’ve seen too many people get into investments without understanding
what they’re buying and what the risks are. People who sell mutual
funds usually sell other investments, too. And some of those other 
90
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

products — vehicles such as limited partnerships, cash-value life insur-
ance, annuities, futures, and options — hold the allure (for the sales-
people) of high commissions. Salespeople tend to exaggerate the
potential rewards and obscure the risks and drawbacks of what they
sell; they don’t seem to take the time to educate investors.
 I can get you those funds that you’re interested in from the same 
no-load companies, such as Fidelity. Brokers like to imply that they
can sell you basically the same funds that you could buy on your own
through no-load companies. However, top no-load companies, such 
as Vanguard, for example, don’t sell any load funds through brokers.
Fidelity sells a series of load funds, called Fidelity Advisor funds,
through commission-based brokers. These funds carry hefty upfront
sales charges and/or much higher ongoing fees — up to a full 1 percent
more per year — than their no-load counterparts.
In recent years, increasing numbers of brokerage firms are offering their
customers access to some no-load mutual funds through a service
known as a wrap (or managed) account. To get into these funds, you
must agree to pay the brokerage firm an annual investment management
fee on top of the fees the underlying mutual funds charge. (I explain in
Chapter 6 why high-fee wrap accounts aren’t in your best interest.)
 The no-loads won’t call you to tell you when to get out of the market
or switch funds. True. But far from being a disadvantage, not getting a
call to switch funds is actually a plus. Although mutual funds offer daily
liquidity, funds are meant to be a longer-term investment.
As for switching funds, you don’t want a broker telling you when he
thinks it’s the right time. A broker who stands to gain financially when
you trade is hard pressed to be a source of objective advice of when to
trade funds. (In Chapter 15, I explain how to evaluate whether to con-
tinue holding the funds you own by applying the criteria discussed in
this chapter.)
 No-loads are impersonal organizations. When you call a no-load
fund’s toll-free number, you’ll surely get a different representative every
time. Visiting a fund’s Web site is even less personal. If it’s important for
you to have a relationship with someone at these firms, however, some
representatives give you their names and extensions (just ask) so you
can reach them in the future. (Higher balance customers at some fund
companies can be assigned a dedicated representative, so just ask.)
A broker can be a personal contact who asks you about your golf game,
how your family is doing, and . . . by the way . . . “What’s the phone
number of your rich Uncle Johnny?” Independent financial counselors
who charge a fee for their time can serve the same role. Likewise, dis-
count brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, and
Fidelity maintain branch offices that offer a personal, local touch if you
need and want it.
91
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Exposing loads
The only way to be sure that a fund is truly no-load is to look at the prospec-
tus for the fund. Only there, in black and white and absent of all marketing
hype, must the organization tell the truth about its sales charges and other
fund fees. (Check out “Reading Prospectuses — the Important Stuff, Anyway”
later in this chapter for info on how to read one.)
92
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 
Hidden loads in alphabet soup: ABCD shares
Over the years, investors have learned about
the sales loads that are deducted from their
investments in load mutual funds. Perhaps you
just discovered this yourself. Well, the compa-
nies that specialize in selling load funds have,
with the unwitting assistance of government
regulators, developed various types of funds
that make finding the load much harder.
Just as some jewelers flog fake diamonds on
late-night TV commercials, increasing numbers
of brokers and financial planners are selling
funds that they call no-loads, when they’re
really not no-loads. By any other name, these
funds are load funds: The only difference is that,
with these funds, someone has taken the time
to hide the sales commission.
For a given load fund, some fund companies
have introduced different classes of shares,
usually labeled by the letters A, B, C, or D. No
matter what letter they slap onto it, remember
that you’re getting the same fund manager and
the same fund. The only difference is how much
the company’s charging you to own it.
Shares with the traditional front-end load are usu-
ally sold as Class A shares. Class B, C, and D
shares are the classes that the mutual fund mar-
keters deploy tricky techniques such as back-end
loads or ongoing commissions known as 12b-1
fees.These commissions often end up being more
expensive than the old upfront loads.
Take the back-end sales load, for example,
which is the typical technique of Class B shares.
Instead of assessing a load when you purchase
these shares, you’re charged a load when you
sell them. But wait, the broker tells you, the
more years you hold onto the shares, the lower
the sales charge when you sell. In fact, if you
hold onto the shares long enough — usually five
to seven years — the load disappears alto-
gether. This deal sounds a lot better than the
Class A shares, which charge you an upfront
load no matter what. Not so fast. The broker
selling the Class B shares still gets a commis-
sion. The company simply raises the fund’s
operating expenses (much higher than on Class
A shares) and pays the broker commissions out
of that. One way or another, the broker gets his
pound of flesh from your investment dollars.
Remember: You can easily avoid these hidden
loads. Don’t buy funds through salespeople. Buy
no-loads, such as those recommended in this
book.

Figure 7-1 is a sample of a typical fee table from a fund prospectus for a load
fund. Note that the Class A shares have an upfront 6.5 percent sales commis-
sion that’s deducted when you invest your money.

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

The Class B shares don’t have an upfront commission but instead have a
deferred sales charge, which decreases over time. However, note that this
class can charge you up to an extra 1 percent per year (12b-1 marketing
expense fees). Class B shares in this example (as in most real cases) cost you
more in the long run because you pay this cost each year as long as you own
the fund. Check out the “Hidden loads in alphabet soup: ABCD shares” side-
bar earlier in this chapter for even more details on this game of hide the load.
Considering a fund’s operating expenses
One cost of fund ownership that you simply can’t avoid is operating expenses.
Every mutual fund — load and no-load — must charge fees to pay for the
operational costs of running the fund: paying the fund manager and research
assistants, employing people to answer the phone lines and operate a Web
site, printing and mailing prospectuses, buying technology equipment to
track all those investments and customer-account balances, and so on.
Running a fund business costs money! Operating expenses also include a
profit for the fund company. (The brokerage costs that a fund pays to buy
and sell securities aren’t included in a fund’s operating expenses. You can
find this information in a fund’s Statement of Additional Information, which I
cover at the end of this chapter.)
A fund’s operating expenses are quoted as a percentage of the fund’s assets
or value. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge. In the case of
load funds, this fee is in addition to the stated load. You can find this number
in the expenses section of a fund’s prospectus, usually denoted by a line,
such as Total Fund Operating Expenses. Or you can call the mutual fund’s toll-
free number and ask a representative or dig for the information on most fund
companies’ Web sites. I even tell you, for no extra charge, what the operating
expenses are for the funds recommended in this book.
Although all funds must charge operating expenses, some funds charge much
more than others. By picking the right funds, you can minimize the operating
expenses you pay. And minimize them you should: Operating expenses come
right out of your returns. Higher expenses translate into a lower return to you.
Expenses matter on all types of funds but more on some and less on others:
 Expenses are critical on money market mutual funds and are very
important on bond funds. These funds are buying securities that are so
similar and so efficiently priced in the financial markets. In other words,
your expected returns from similar bond and money funds are largely
driven by the size of a fund’s operating expenses. This fact has been
especially true in recent years when interest rates have gotten low.
94
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

 With stock funds, expenses are a less important (but still important)
factor in picking a fund. Don’t forget that, over time, stocks have aver-
aged returns of about 10 percent per year. So, if one stock fund charges
1.5 percent more in operating expenses than another, you’re giving up an
extra 15 percent of your expected annual returns.
Some people argue that stock funds that charge high expenses may be
justified in doing so — if they’re able to generate higher rates of return.
But there’s no evidence that high-expense stock funds do generate higher
returns. In fact, funds with higher operating expenses, on average, tend
to produce lower rates of return. This makes sense because operating
expenses are deducted from the returns that a fund generates.
But how high is high? You should generally shun a money market or bond
fund that charges more than 0.5 percent per year, a United States (U.S.) stock
fund that charges more than 1 percent per year, or an international or spe-
cialty fund that charges more than 1.3 percent per year. Steel yourself against
clever marketing brochures and charming salespeople. Read the fine print
and walk the other way to a better fund if costs are too high.
If a given fund’s expenses are much higher than its peers, one of two things is
usually happening: Either the fund has little money under management — and
therefore has a smaller group of investors to bear the management costs — or
the fund owners are greedy. Another possibility could be that the fund com-
pany is inefficiently managed. (Maybe the company rents high-cost, big-city
office space and its telephone reps spend half the day making long-distance
phone calls to friends!) In any case, you don’t want to be a shareholder of
such a fund.
These high-expense funds have another insidious danger built in: In order 
to produce returns comparable to those of similar funds with lower costs, 
the manager of such a high-cost fund may take extra risks to overcome the
performance drag of high expenses. So on top of reducing a fund’s returns,
higher expenses may expose you to greater risk than you desire.
In some cases, a fund (particularly a newer one that’s trying to attract assets)
will “reimburse” a portion of its expense ratio in order to show a lower cost.
But if (or when) the fund terminates this reimbursement, you’re stuck owning
shares in a fund that has higher costs than you intended to pay.
All mutual fund fees — both loads and operating expenses — are disclosed 
in a fund’s prospectus, which is why obtaining a fund’s prospectus before
you buy it is so important. Reviewing the prospectus is especially critical for
funds pitched to you by brokers or by brokers who masquerade as “financial
planners” and “consultants.” I tell you how to decipher a fund prospectus
later in this chapter.
95
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Oh, one last point about fund expenses: Some people ask me how the
expenses are charged and if they’re itemized on your fund statement. The
answer is that a fund’s operating expenses are essentially invisible to you
because they’re deducted before you’re paid any return. Because these
expenses are charged on a daily basis, you don’t need to worry about trying
to get out of a fund before these fees are deducted.
Weighing Performance and Risk
Although a fund’s performance, or its historic rate of return, is certainly an
important factor to weigh when selecting a mutual fund, investors tend to
overemphasize its importance. Choosing funds on simplistic comparisons 
of performance numbers is dangerous.
As all mutual fund materials tell you, past performance is no guarantee of
future results. Analysis of historic mutual fund performance proves that
some of yesterday’s stars may turn into tomorrow’s skid row bums (as I 
discuss in the next section, “Star today, also-ran tomorrow”).
Realize that funds with relatively high returns may achieve their results by
taking on a lot of risk. Those same funds often take the hardest fall during
major market declines. Remember that risk and return go hand in hand; 
you can’t afford to look at return independent of the risk it took to get there.
Before you invest in a fund, make sure you’re comfortable with the level of
risk the fund is taking on.
Star today, also-ran tomorrow
The mutual fund industry has all too much in common with Hollywood.
There’s always a star of the week — the handsome actor or actress appearing
in the most recent blockbuster with the biggest box office sales. Suddenly,
that actor or actress is smiling from magazine covers at the checkout, sitting
alongside David Letterman, and donning the latest fashion designs at the
Oscars. All that attention, however, has its drawbacks. If your next flick flops,
you have that much farther to fall.
The same is true for mutual funds. Some fund manager has a fabulous quar-
ter or year, ripping up the market with his little growth-stock fund. Suddenly,
his face is plastered across the financial magazines; he’s hailed as the next
Peter Lynch, and then hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of new
investor dollars come pouring into his fund.
96
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Short-term (one year is a short time period) fund performance numbers don’t
mean much — luck can be just as big a factor as skill. Also remember that
earning much higher returns than other similar funds often means that the
manager took a lot of risk. The greater the short-term returns for that fund
and manager, the greater the odds of sharp slump.
The history of short-term mutual fund star funds confirms this: Of the number
one top-performing stock and bond funds in each of the last 20 years, a whop-
ping 80 percent of them subsequently performed worse than the average fund
in their peer group over the next five to ten years! Some of these former
number one funds actually went on to become the worst-performing funds 
in their particular category.
The following sections provide a sampling of the many examples of short-term
stars becoming tomorrow’s also-rans (and in some cases, downright losers).
Fame is fleeting. But the consequences are more serious for a fund manager
than for a Hollywood star: When a fund flops, the manager brings all his
investors down with him.
Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund
With a mere three years of stellar returns under his belt, Garrett Van
Wagoner, manager of the Govett Smaller Companies Fund, decided to cash 
in on his exploding popularity. In late 1995, he left Govett and started his 
own money management firm — Van Wagoner Capital Management. Calling
Van Wagoner the hottest small company stock picker around, several of 
the nation’s largest financial magazines recommended investing in his new
Emerging Growth fund. Investor cash came flooding in — more than a billion
dollars in the fund’s first six months of existence.
The Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund invests in high-flying smaller com-
pany growth stocks. In its first full year of operations (1996), the fund posted
a respectable total return of nearly 27 percent, placing it within the top 20
percent of funds within its peer group.
In the next year, 1997, the fund dropped by 20 percent and dramatically
underperformed its peer group and was among the worst of its peers. Money
flowed out and the fund was largely ignored until 1999 when Van Wagoner
piled into technology stocks, which were zooming to the moon. In 1999, this
fund produced a total return of a whopping 291 percent (making it the year’s
number one stock fund) while assets under management swelled from less
than 200 million to nearly 1.5 billion!
97
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Investors who came to Van Wagoner’s party in 1999 were subsequently
treated to one of the greatest collapses in the history of the fund industry.
Following a drop of 20.9 percent in 2000, the fund posted horrendous losses
in the next two years as well — losing 59.7 percent in 2001 and then 64.5 per-
cent in 2002. In fact, the poor investors who bought in at or near the top
during late 1999 through early 2000 experienced a stomach-wrenching plunge
of more than 90 percent through September 2002. (The fund also had horren-
dous years in 2004 and 2005). See Table 7-1 for how this fund has performed
versus its relevant index — the Russell 2000 Growth Index.

Over the past decade, the fund has returned an average of –8.6 percent per
year versus the average small company growth funds’ return of 8.0 percent
per year. In other words, this fund has underperformed its peer group on
average by 16.6 percent per year! If you invested $10,000 in this fund ten
years ago, your investment would’ve shrunk to less than $4,100; whereas, the
same investment in its average peer would’ve grown to more than $21,500!
Managers Intermediate Mortgage fund
Managed by portfolio manager Worth Bruntjen, Managers Intermediate
Mortgage (MIM) was the darling of the moment for almost every mutual 
fund rating service in 1993. (I talk about rating services in Chapter 18.) 
It earned kudos because, in its seemingly boring investment universe — 
government-backed mortgage bonds — it produced an annual rate of return 
3 percent higher than that of its peers (who came in it at just 10 percent per
year) over the five-year period ending in 1993. By earning 13 percent per year
rather than 10 percent, MIM’s performance was about 30 percent better than
its peers.
98
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

This fund received some of the highest ratings that most mutual fund rating
companies allowed for performance, and, supposedly, MIM had “below aver-
age” risk. It earned Morningstar’s coveted five-star rating. (Partly to its credit,
in its analysis of the fund on January 21, 1994, Morningstar said of MIM, “Its
portfolio is made up entirely of volatile derivative securities,” and went on to
add, “If rates move back up, this fund will find it hard to maintain its great
record.”)
When interest rates finally did rise sharply in early 1994, the fund got clob-
bered. It produced a total return of –22 percent in the first half of 1994. This
little six-month disaster was enough to bring the fund in dead last among 50
other mortgage bond funds for the five-year period ending on June 30, 1994.
And the disaster wiped out the above-average returns that this fund had gen-
erated over the five previous years.
This fund was able to achieve its temporarily high returns by taking a ton of
risk. From where did all the danger come, you ask? The fund invested in com-
plex collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), which are pieces of a mort-
gage. Buying CMOs is like buying chicken parts rather than a whole chicken
at the supermarket. A mortgage gets chopped into the different years of prin-
cipal and/or interest repayments. CMOs are incredibly complicated to under-
stand, even if you surround yourself with computers and investment bankers.
Forbes magazine, which had written a glowing article praising fund manager
Bruntjen on January 17, 1994, admitted that its earlier enthusiasm had been
excessive — a rare and honorable thing for a financial magazine to do. Forbes
said that the magazine had learned from the episode “not to be overly confi-
dent in historical statistics, especially those attached to complex investment
products. In this case, a volatility measure calculated from a mostly bullish
period turned out to be meaningless during a period when the market turned
bearish.”
Matterhorn Growth fund
This aggressive stock fund skyrocketed 184 percent in 1975 — the year fol-
lowing the end of one of the worst declines for the stock market since the
Great Depression. Since the 1970s, however, this fund has been in the dog-
house. It holds the dubious distinction of being the worst stock fund during
the 1980s — one of the best decades ever for the stock market.
As money poured out of the fund, its annual operating expenses as a percent-
age of assets ballooned in excess of 4 percent per year! The fund was finally
put out of its misery when it was merged into the CSI Equity fund in 2006.

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Apples to apples: Comparing 
performance numbers
Remember back in school when the teacher handed back exams and you
were delighted to get a 92 (unless you’re from an overachieving family)? But
then you found out that the average on the exam was a 95. You still may have
been pleased, but a lot of air was let out of your balloon.
Mutual fund performance numbers are the same: They don’t mean much until
they’re compared to the averages. A 15 percent return sounds great until you
find out that the return from the relevant index market average (that invests
in similar securities) was 25 percent during the same period.
The trick is picking the correct benchmark for comparison. Dozens of market
indexes and fund category averages measure various components of the
market. You always want to compare a fund’s returns to its most appropriate
benchmark. Comparing the performance of an international stock fund to
that of a U.S. stock market index isn’t fair, just as comparing a sixth grader’s
test results on a given test to those of a tenth grader taking the same test is
unfair. (See Chapter 15 for a list of benchmarks and an explanation of what
markets they measure.)
Context matters, and mutual fund companies realize this. So in their mar-
keting literature, fund companies usually compare their funds’ returns to 
selected benchmarks. Keep a wary eye on these comparisons. In the great
American advertising tradition, fund companies often pick benchmarks 
that make it easy for their funds to look good. And in like manner, more than 
a few investment advisers who manage money do the same, as I discuss in
Chapter 22.
Here are some examples of the games funds play to make themselves look a
lot better than they really are.
A number of years ago, the Strong Short-Term Bond Fund (subsequently
acquired by Wells Fargo) ran ads claiming to be the number one short-term
bond fund. (I’d show you the ad, but Strong refused to grant permission to
reprint it.) The ads featured a 12-month comparison graph that compared 
the Strong fund’s yield to the average yield on other short-term bond funds.
The Strong Short-Term Bond Fund, according to the graph, consistently out-
performed the competition by 2 to 2.5 percent!
A bond fund must take a lot more risk to generate a dividend yield this much
higher than the competition’s. You should also be suspicious of any bond
100
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

fund claiming to be this good with an annual operating expense ratio of 
0.8 percent. With a yield and expenses that high (as I explain in Chapter 11), 
a fund has to take higher risks than supposedly comparable funds to make 
up for the drag of its expenses. And if the fund’s taking that much more risk,
then it needs to be compared to its true competition — which, in Strong’s
case, are other funds whose investments take similarly high risks. This fund
isn’t a bad fund, but it isn’t nearly as good as the ad would’ve had you think.
This fund was on steroids! The Strong Short-Term Bond Fund wasn’t compa-
rable to most other short-term bond funds because
 A high percentage of its bonds weren’t high quality. About 40 percent
of its bonds were rated BBB or below. (I explain bond credit-quality 
ratings in Chapter 11.)
 Many of its bonds weren’t short-term bonds. The Strong Fund invested
in mortgage bonds that are more like intermediate-term bonds.
Strong’s ad also claimed that its bond fund was ranked number one for 
the year. If a fund takes more risk than the funds it compares itself to, 
then sure, during particular, brief periods, it can easily end up at the top 
of the performance charts. But how strong of a long-term performer is this
“number one” fund? Over the five years before this ad ran, even including 
the year the ad was so proud of, Strong’s fund had underperformed most
short-term bond funds.
Ads for the Warburg Pincus Growth & Income Fund (taken over by Credit
Suisse) similarly trumpeted its superior performance. It claimed to be the
number one growth and income fund for the year and number four out of 
180 funds for the previous five years. Sounds great, doesn’t it? (I’d show 
you the ad, but, like Strong, Warburg Pincus refused to give permission.)
Most growth and income funds invest in U.S. companies, primarily larger
ones. This fund, however, would’ve been more appropriately called the
Warburg Pincus Global Growth Fund because its prospectus showed that 
this fund had invested about 20 percent overseas and 40 percent in small
company stocks.
The average growth and income fund at the time paid dividends of around 
3 percent, whereas this fund was paying only 0.2 percent at the time of its 
ad. Thus, a huge amount of this fund focused on relatively growth-oriented,
rather than dividend-oriented, securities. The fund wasn’t bad, but it was
hardly as superior as the ad implied.
101
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Recognizing the Fund Manager 
and Fund Family Expertise
Much is made of who manages a specific mutual fund. Although the expertise
of the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island unto
himself (or herself — more women are becoming fund managers nowadays).
(And if the fund manager leaves or retires from the company, you’re left 
holding the fund.) Earlier in this chapter (see “Star today, also-ran tomor-
row”), I explain how a star fund can flare for its moment of investor glory 
and then easily twinkle down to become just another average or worse-than-
average fund. Too many of us seem to want to believe that, in every field of
endeavor — sports, entertainment, business — there are superhumans who
can walk on water.
It’s true that in the investment world some people shine at what they do. But
compared to other fields, the gap between the star investment manager and
the average one, over long time periods, typically is small.
If the stocks of large U.S. companies, for example, have increased an average
of 13 percent per year over a decade, the money manager focusing on such
securities may vault to star status if his fund earns 15 percent over the same
time period. Don’t get me wrong: An extra 2 percent per year ain’t nothin’ to
sneeze at — especially if you have millions invested. But a 2 percent higher
return is a lot smaller than what most people think they can achieve with the
best investment managers.
Therefore, the resources and capabilities of the parent company should be
equally important in your selection of which funds to invest in. Different com-
panies have different capabilities and levels of expertise with different types
of funds. Vanguard, for example, is terrific at index funds and money market,
bond, and conservative stock funds, thanks to its low operating expenses.
Fidelity has a lot of experience and success investing in U.S. stocks.
Other excellent mutual fund companies only offer a handful of funds, unlike
such giants as Vanguard and Fidelity. Don’t assume from their smaller size
that they’re newcomers to the world of money management. Firms such as
Dodge & Cox managed money privately for decades before they started offer-
ing funds to the public. In Chapters 10 through 13, I detail which firms have
great reputations in various fund categories. I also recommend individual
funds from these various companies.
Avoid fund companies with little mutual fund management experience and
success. If you need surgery, you turn your body over to a surgeon who’s suc-
cessfully performed the operation hundreds of times, not to a rookie who’s
only seen it on the local cable station. Avoid novelty funds as well. Mutual
funds have been around for many decades. Yet not a week goes by without
some newfangled fund coming out with a new concept. Most of these ideas
102
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

come from the fund company’s marketing department, which in some compa-
nies has too much clout. Instead of coming up with investments that meet
investors’ needs, they come up with gimmicky funds that involve extra risk
and that almost always cost extra in their high annual operating expenses.
Reading Prospectuses — the 
Important Stuff, Anyway
Securities laws require every fund to issue a prospectus, and the U.S. SEC
reviews the details of every single one (which probably keeps plenty of coffee
and eyeglass companies in business). A prospectus is usually written and
edited by an attorney who wouldn’t know a lively and comprehensible sen-
tence if it clobbered him on the head with a law dictionary. You can safely
skip most of what’s said in a prospectus, but be on the lookout for a few
things you should check out.
The most valuable information — the fund’s investment objectives, costs,
and performance history — is summarized in the first few pages of the
prospectus. Read these. Skip most of the rest. The rest only tells you more
than you could possibly want to know about how the fund is administered.
Do you really want to know whether employees are paid monthly or weekly?
Which brand of paper shredders they recently bought for the accounting
department?
If you find prospectuses to be positively lethal in their tediousness, let me
suggest a friendlier alternative: Just jump ahead to the fund recommenda-
tions in Chapters 10 through 13 of this book. I’ve already checked them out
for you, and they meet the criteria for good funds that I list in this book.
However, if you’re going to be assessing funds for purchase other than 
those presented in this book, you need to be able to read and understand 
a prospectus.
In the pages that follow, I walk you through the more useful and relevant
parts of a well-done prospectus for one of Vanguard’s funds, the Wellington
Fund. Remember, the specifics about the fund have since changed, so be 
sure to get a new prospectus if you want to invest in the Wellington Fund.
Cover page
The prospectus is dated (see Figure 7-2) so that you know how recent its
information is. Don’t sweat it if the prospectus is several months old; in 
general, fund companies update prospectuses annually.
103
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

The table of contents is a sure sign that the prospectus is too long — but
then lawyers seldom use 1 word where 50 will do. The table of contents helps
you navigate the prospectus to find whatever information you want. To illus-
trate here, I cover a portion of this prospectus (most of the good stuff is near
the front).
Some prospectuses describe more than one fund in a particular fund family.
(This prospectus covers two different “Share Classes” — “Investor Shares”
and “Admiral Shares,” which are identical except that the Admiral Shares
have far larger initial investment requirements and lower expenses.) This
practice can save a fund company printing and mailing charges when it has
funds with very similar investment objectives and/or funds run by the same
investment management team.

Fund profile
The fund profile pages (beginning with Figure 7-3) contain a synopsis of the
main attributes of the fund, such as a description of the fund’s investment
objectives and the strategies (the types of securities the fund invests in) that
it employs to accomplish its objectives. The Wellington Fund seeks current
income from its investments and modest appreciation. It invests the majority
of its assets in stocks that pay decent dividends (for income as well as appre-
ciation potential) and its remaining assets in high-quality bonds (for income).

Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Here, you also find a list of the main risks that come with investing in this
fund. All funds, especially those which invest in stocks and bonds (as this
one does), come with risk. Don’t let this list scare you away — let it make you
feel better. You’re hiring a knowledgeable and experienced fund manager who
can do a much better job navigating these potential perils than you can.

On the second page of the fund profile section, you find a description of the
fund’s performance chart and table (see Figure 7-4). In the chart, you can see,
the yearly total return that an investor in this fund has earned over the past
decade. (Below the chart is a description of the best and worst quarters —
three-month periods). Because this fund invests in a mixture of bonds and
stocks, you shouldn’t be surprised to see fluctuations — in some years, you see
fairly large positive returns (in some cases more than 20 percent), and in other
years, you see a negative return. The performance information also includes
details on the impact on taxes (which assumes the deduction of taxes at the
highest federal rates) and comparison of the fund to relevant market indexes.

Thankfully, funds are required to present, in a standardized format (see the
next page of the prospectus in Figure 7-5), the costs that you’ll incur for the
privilege of owning a fund. The first list of expenses shows the fees you pay
when you buy and sell shares. These fees are deducted at the time a transac-
tion occurs; unfortunately, they’re rarely itemized. Because a no-load fund
such as the Wellington Fund doesn’t charge any sales commissions, you see
the word None repeated throughout this section.

If a so-called financial adviser pitches a fund, but you’re not sure whether 
she gets paid for selling it to you, always get a prospectus and check out the
fund expense section. That way, you can see if commissions will erode your
returns. In this case, you’d see that if an adviser recommended this fund, she
isn’t paid any commission — a good sign. (Refer to Figure 7-1 for an example
of a typical load-fund fee table.)
Operating expenses are fees charged on a continuous basis by all mutual
funds (see “Considering a fund’s operating expenses” earlier in this chapter);
they cover the expenses of running a fund and include the fund company’s
management fee — out of which it earns its profit. In this case, they total a
reasonable 0.30 percent (even less for the Admiral shares). Because these
fees are deducted from the fund’s returns before your returns are paid to 
you, lower operating expenses translate into higher returns for you.

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

In addition to showing you the fund expenses as a percentage of the amount
an investor has in the fund, the prospectus also shows you the total expense
dollars that an investor will incur over the years by investing a hypothetical
amount ($10,000) in the fund (see Figure 7-5).
Other fund information
The next section of the prospectus (see Figure 7-6) presents you with a hodge-
podge of facts about the fund, some of which may be important to you: when
dividends and capital gains are distributed, who manages the fund, how long
the fund has been in existence, what the fund’s total assets are, whether the
fund is suitable for retirement accounts, and what its minimum initial invest-
ment amount is. You’ll also find the fund’s abbreviated name as it appears in
newspaper listings of daily fund prices, the number assigned to the fund at 
its parent company, and the fund’s trading (or ticker) symbol, which can be
handy to clearly identify this fund when buying it through a discount broker.

The bottom section of this page highlights the important concept of risk and
alerts you to a flag symbol that appears when the prospectus provides more
detail about the fund’s specific risks. The last sentences introduce the next
section on investment strategies.
Investment objectives and risks
This next section on investment strategies explains in detail what the fund is
trying to accomplish and what risks the fund is subject to. In Figures 7-7
through 7-9, I show you the first few pages of this section. The Wellington
Fund seeks both moderate growth of capital and current income. It tries to
accomplish these objectives by investing in stocks that pay decent dividends
and bonds (fixed-income securities). (The Plain Talk sections within this
prospectus — see the shaded boxes — explain important fund-investing con-
cepts. The Plain Talk section isn’t required, and you won’t necessarily find it,
or the equivalent, in every prospectus.)

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

You can think of the investment policies or objectives as a broad set of rules
or guidelines (for example, the major type of securities that the fund invests
in) that the fund operates under when investing your money. This hope-
fully protects you from most major surprises. And if a fund violates these 
guidelines — for instance, if this fund puts all its money into international
stocks — the SEC would spank, reprimand, and penalize Vanguard. Unethical
fund companies may be willing to pay this small price if they can seduce
more people into their funds by showing higher returns that result from
taking poorly disclosed risks.
If you’ve taken the time to look at how much money this fund has made for
investors, you owe it to yourself to understand this fund’s risks, too. This 
section of the prospectus does an excellent job of discussing the Wellington
Fund’s risks, using examples from past decades instead of just from recent
years, which were generally good years for the financial markets.

Investment adviser
This important section (see Figure 7-10) provides background about the
investment adviser — the folks actually managing the investments of this
fund. You can read about the firm (in this case, it’s an outside money manage-
ment company — Wellington Management Company) as well as the specific
individuals (in this case, Bousa and Kaplan) who make the fund’s investment
decisions.
Financial highlights
If you get a headache looking at all the numbers on financial pages, you’re not
alone. Figure 7-11 looks frightening, but this table is just a yearly summary 
of the value of the fund’s shares and the distributions the fund has made (I
cover these subjects in detail in Chapters 15 and 16).

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

The Net Asset Value (NAV) is the price per share of the fund. Tracking this
value is an incomplete, terrible measure of what you would’ve earned in the
fund. Why? Just look at the distributions section, which details all the money
paid out to shareholders each year. This fund has paid out total distributions
(dividends and capital gains) of $7.33 per share over this five-year period.
This per-share figure is an enormous amount when you consider that the
Figure 7-10:
The
investment
adviser
actually
manages
the fund’s
money.
112
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

share price only increased from $28.41 to $33.76 during the period — a 19
percent increase. But if you add in the distributions to the change in share
price, now you’re talking about a 45 percent (or more) increase (if you’d 
reinvested these distributions, you would’ve had an even greater return).
The Total Return represents what investors in the fund have earned histori-
cally. The returns on this type of fund, which invests in stocks and bonds,
bounce around from year to year. You can see how the total investments 
(Net Assets) in the fund have changed over time. Assets can increase from
new money flowing into the fund as well as from an increase in the value of 
a fund’s shares.
This section of a prospectus also shows you how a fund’s annual operating
expenses (Ratio of Total Expenses to Average Net Assets) have changed over
time. They should decrease when a fund is growing. This fund’s expense ratio
of 0.36 percent in 2002 decreased to 0.30 percent four years later. If operating
expenses are high (not in this case) and don’t decrease, their persistent
levels may signal a company that maximizes its profits because of the fund’s
popularity. For funds that are only a few years old, expenses may remain
higher because the fund is building its base of investors.
The line Ratio of Net Investment Income to Average Net Assets shows the
annual dividends, or yield, that the fund has paid. (This figure is especially
important for retired people, who need income to live on.) In this example,
the downward trend merely reflects the overall decline in interest rates
during the period. If you looked at this ratio for a similar fund, you’d see 
the same trend for this period.

Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

The Turnover Rate tells you how much trading takes place in a fund.
Specifically, it measures the percentage of the portfolio’s holdings that 
has been traded over the year:
 A low turnover number (less than 30 percent or so), such as the 
one for this fund, denotes a fund with more of a buy-and-hold 
strategy.
 A high turnover number (100 percent plus) indicates a fund manager
who shifts things around a lot. Rapid trading is costlier and riskier and
may increase a fund’s taxable distributions.
Reviewing Annual Reports
Funds also produce annual reports that discuss how the fund’s been doing
and provide details on the specific investments that a fund holds. Look at the
annual report if, for instance, you want to know which countries an interna-
tional fund is currently invested in.
You can get answers to questions like what countries a fund invests 
in by calling a fund’s toll-free number or by hunting around on a fund 
company’s Web site. (Some fund companies enable you to access their 
fund’s annual reports and prospectuses on their Web site.) Some of the
mutual fund information sources that I recommend in Chapter 18 also 
report this type of information. (Or you could say, “Details, details. Just 
suggest some funds to buy for different needs.” That’s just what I do in
Chapters 10 through 13.)
In this section, I review the pages from the annual report on the Vanguard
Wellington Fund — the same fund whose prospectus I introduce you to in 
the preceding section. In addition to producing an annual report, each fund
produces a semiannual report that (guess what?) comes out halfway between
annual reports. The semiannual reports are usually a bit shorter than the full-
year reports but contain the most up-to-date information on the fund’s cur-
rent investment holdings and performance.
When you call a fund company to ask for applications, specifically request a
fund’s recent annual or semiannual reports. Unlike a prospectus, most funds
don’t automatically send you annual reports.
114
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Chairman’s letter and performance 
discussion
The Chairman’s letter is supposed to explain how well the fund has per-
formed recently and why (see Figure 7-12). In far too many reports, the 
fund’s chief executive uses his or her letter to the stockholders merely 
as an opportunity to overhype how well the fund has done — during good
periods in the financial markets. In tougher times, too many fund execs 
blame subpar performance on the market. It’s like fishing: On a successful
day, you talk about your uncanny casting ability, your brilliant choice of
lures, and your ability to keep still and quiet. When you come home empty
handed, the fish just weren’t biting.

A good annual report like Vanguard’s will detail the performance of the fund
and compare it to relevant benchmarks and comparable funds. You hope that
your fund will meet or exceed the performance of comparable funds (and
perhaps even of the benchmark, too) in most periods. Don’t worry if your
fund periodically underperforms a little. Especially with stock and bond
funds, you invest for the long haul, not just for six months or a year.
Figure 7-12:

115
Chapter 7: Finding the Best Funds

Unfortunately, as I discuss earlier in this chapter, more than a few fund com-
panies use benchmarks (indexes) as comparisons for their funds’ perform-
ances so that their funds look as if they perform better than they really do.
This ruse is similar to a financially savvy adult like, say, me, comparing his
mutual fund selection abilities to those of, say, a child. I’m at something of an
unfair advantage (at any rate, I’d better be). As you review a fund’s annual
report, keep in mind this tendency of some funds to fudge comparisons. In
Chapter 15, I discuss ways you can make sure that you’re comparing a fund’s
performance to an appropriate benchmark.
In addition to discussing the fund’s performance during the year, an annual
report also covers how the overall financial markets were feeling. If you’re
used to a steady diet of the daily news, an overview like this can help you to
better see and understand the big picture (and maybe you won’t be so
shocked that one of your funds lost, say, 2 percent last year when you see
that the benchmark index most relevant to that fund lost 5 percent).
A good annual report is educational and honest. As you can see, Vanguard’s
is both. The report does a nice job of providing a historical context for under-
standing this fund’s performance. It also clearly explains that a surging stock
market the past year propelled this fund’s returns.
The comparisons to competitors help you make sure that you’re comparing
your fund to the Wellington Fund’s true peers — apples to apples. These
comparisons are even more valuable and useful when applied over longer
periods (see Figure 7-13). You can see how the Wellington Fund performed
against its competitors (“average balanced fund”) and the benchmark com-
posite index. The Wellington Fund handily beat the competition and the
benchmark index. (The “Composite Index” is a mythical investment, which
has the advantage of not having any costs deducted from it.)
In the world of stocks and bonds, one year is too short a period to evaluate a
fund. In this section, the chairman also looks forward and prudently reminds
you that the future will likely contain both good and bad periods.
Investment adviser’s thoughts
The “Report from the Advisor” is where the portfolio managers of the fund
(in this case, the Wellington Management Company) explain how the eco-
nomic environment affected the fund’s performance. They also look ahead
and discuss what the future may hold and what investment strategy they
plan to take in the near future (see Figure 7-14). I especially like how this
report highlights not only their successes but also their less-than-stellar
performers.

Performance and its components
The performance page looks like a terrible overload of numbers, but it 
actually contains valuable information (see Figure 7-15).
For example, this table shows you how the Wellington Fund has performed
each year. As you can see in the Cumulative Performance table, although the
fund has produced an average annual return of 9.44 percent per year over the
past ten years, its return varies much from year to year. In 1997 (fiscal year,
which in this case ends November 30), for instance, it returned 18.6 percent,
but its return was –8.1 percent in 2002. If a swing in returns such as this
makes you reach for your motion sickness prescription, you’d better skip
investing in the fund.

Investment holdings
The Statement of Net Assets section lists every investment the fund owns.
Here’s where you get the details that tell you exactly where your money is
invested. You can see here the incredible diversification your money gets in a
mutual fund; you actually own a tiny sliver of each of these securities if you
invest in this fund (see Figure 7-16). For example, in this first section, you can
see that this fund (as of November 30, 2006) was 65 percent invested in
stocks, which are presented here by industry.

Reviewing a fund’s specific investment holdings is important. Sometimes, a
fund’s name is misleading relative to what the fund actually holds; often, the
Objective section of a prospectus doesn’t provide insight into important fac-
tors, such as the sizes of the companies that it owns.
For each security, you also can see how much each investment was worth at
the end of the most recent year. (Do you need to know, should you care, and
will it be on the test? No, no, and no!)
Continuing on in the report, you see more of the investments that the fund
owns. Figure 7-17 shows you some of the bonds the fund owns. These bonds
are listed by issuer (government versus corporate) and the corporate bonds
by industry and specific companies.

Investigating the Statement of
Additional Information (SAI)
The brokerage fees that a fund pays to buy and sell securities for the fund are
not included in the annual operating expense numbers that a fund reports.
Brokerage costs reduce a fund’s returns just the same as a fund’s operating
expenses and are ultimately reflected in the fund’s annual rate of return.
Although fund brokerage costs are typically far less than the fund’s operating
expenses, funds that frequently trade or “turn over” their holdings can 
have significant brokerage expenses. These costs are disclosed in a fund’s
Statement of Additional Information (SAI). Make sure you look for any signifi-
cant brokerage expenses. More trades mean more costs draining your
returns, which may also lead to more taxable distributions.

Buying Funds from the Best Firms
In This Chapter
 Becoming familiar with the best and worst places to buy funds
 Letting discount brokers work for you
 Knowing when hiring an adviser is appropriate
H
undreds of investment companies offer thousands of fund options.
However, only a handful of these fund companies offer many top-notch
funds, so in this chapter, I tell you which companies are the best places for
your fund investing.
Some other good individual funds are run by companies not mentioned in
this chapter. (I recommend specific funds in Part IV of this book.) In addition
to recommending the best parent fund companies, I also recommend the best
discount brokers. Although these guys are slightly more expensive, discount
brokers make buying the best funds from different fund companies and hold-
ing all the funds in a single account a lot easier.
Finding the Best Buys
When studying the different mutual funds companies, you may see a lot of
different funds. Some are better than others. Using the criteria in Chapter 7,
this chapter presents the best buys. In this section, I discuss the best compa-
nies through which to invest in funds directly. Check out the Appendix for
each company’s contact information. Note: In the fund company descrip-
tions, I devote more space to those companies whose funds I recommend 
the most in this book. Some good funds are offered by companies not on this
short list — please see Chapters 10 through 12 for all the specific fund picks.

The Vanguard Group
The Vanguard Group is the second largest mutual fund company in America
(after Fidelity). Vanguard’s significant growth over the past decade has been
somewhat of a vindication for a company that was underrated during the
1980s and early 1990s. (At the time that I wrote the first edition of this book
in 1994, I went on record as saying that Vanguard, overall, was the best
mutual fund company around and wasn’t getting the recognition it deserved.)
One of the reasons for Vanguard’s underrating is the fact that its funds are
almost never at the very tiptop of the performance charts for their respective
categories. As I discuss in Chapter 7, this sign is really good, because many
number-one-performing funds are rarely even above average over the long
haul. Although Vanguard offers a broad spectrum of funds in terms of risk, it
doesn’t take excessive risks with the funds it offers; thus, its funds rarely are
ranked number one over short time periods.
Because of Vanguard’s unique shareholder-owned structure (see the nearby
sidebar “Vanguard’s roots: The Bogle difference”), the average operating-
expense ratio of its funds — 0.20 percent per year for United States (U.S.)
stock funds, 0.35 percent for international stock funds, and 0.14 percent for
bond funds — is lower than that of any other fund family in the industry. In
fact, the average fund family’s expense ratio is a whopping four times higher
than Vanguard’s. Vanguard also offers its Admiral series of funds with lower
expense ratios for higher balance customers and low-cost exchange-traded
funds (see Chapter 5).
Vanguard’s low expenses translate into superior performance. Especially with
money market and bond funds (markets in which even the best fund man-
agers add relatively little value), Vanguard’s funds are consistently near the
head of the class.
Vanguard is best at funds appealing to safety-minded investors — those 
who want to invest in money market, bond, and conservative stock funds.
However, Vanguard also offers aggressive stock funds with solid performance
and low-expense ratios (see Chapter 12 for the list). In managing stock funds,
where performance is supposed to be more closely tied to the genius of the
fund manager, Vanguard’s thriftiness enhances performance.
A pioneer in the field, Vanguard was the first to offer index funds, which are
unmanaged portfolios of the securities that comprise a market index, such as
the Standard & Poor’s 500 (which tracks the stock performance of the 500
largest U.S. companies). Many fund companies have since added index funds
to their lists of offerings. But Vanguard is still the indexing leader with the
broadest selection of index funds and the lowest operating expenses in the
business. (I talk more about the advantages of index funds in Chapter 9.)
124
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Fidelity Investments
Fidelity Investments is the largest mutual fund company in America. (Although
Vanguard is the largest fund company that’s exclusively commission free. See
the preceding section.) A mutual fund Goliath, Fidelity offers hundreds of
funds. As evidence of Fidelity’s enormous buying power, representatives 
from dozens of companies visit its Boston offices every day. Most mutual fund 
managers have to travel to the companies they’re interested in researching; if
you’re a Fidelity mutual fund manager, however, many companies come to you.
Fidelity’s roots trace back to the 1940s, when Edward C. Johnson II took over
the then-fledgling Fidelity Fund from its president, who felt that he couldn’t
make enough money as the head of an investment fund! Johnson’s son, Ned
(Edward C. Johnson III), assumed Fidelity’s top position in 1972 and has
clearly proven that you can make a truckload of money operating mutual
funds: He’s personally worth billions.
If you’re venturing to do business with Fidelity on your own, you have your
work cut out for you. One of the biggest problems novice investors have at
Fidelity is discerning the good funds from the not-so-good ones. (My book
separates the best from the rest and highlights which Fidelity funds are
worthy of your investment dollars.)
125
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms
Vanguard’s roots: The Bogle difference
In the early 1970s when Vanguard was formed,
John Bogle, its founder and former CEO, made
the big decision that to this day clearly differen-
tiates Vanguard from its competition: Vanguard
distributes funds and provides shareholder
administration on an “at cost” basis — that is,
with no markup or profit.
The seed for Vanguard was planted when Bogle
was fired (over philosophical differences) in
1974 from his position as chairman of Wellington
Management Company, an investment manage-
ment firm. However, Bogle was chairman of the
board of directors of the individual funds, who
decided to keep Bogle as the funds’ chairman
despite his termination by the parent company.
Over time, Bogle was given the latitude and
authority to decide how his new fund company
would operate. He insisted that the manage-
ment of most of the stock funds be contracted
out to private money management firms, from
whom Vanguard would negotiate the best deals.
Thus, Vanguard’s mutual fund investors would
own the management company. Contrast this
arrangement to that of traditional fund compa-
nies, in which the parent management company
receives the profits from managing the funds.
Bogle felt that this unique corporate structure
ensured that fund shareholders would obtain
the best deals possible on money managers.
“Funds ought to be run for the benefit of share-
holders, not for the fund managers,” Bogle rea-
soned. History has proven Bogle not only to be
right but also to be a mutual fund investor’s best
advocate.

I specifically advise shunning the following types of funds at Fidelity:
 Bond funds: Relative to the best of the competition, Fidelity’s bond funds
charge higher operating expenses that depress an investor’s returns. Bond
fund management is an area where Fidelity’s fund managers haven’t dis-
played particular investment prowess. If you want bond funds, Vanguard 
is generally a superior alternative. (Note: For larger-balance customers,
Fidelity offers a decent series of bond funds known as Spartan funds that
have lower operating expense ratios — see Chapter 11.)
 Adviser funds: Fidelity sells this family of load funds through investment
salespeople; these funds carry high sales loads or high ongoing fees.
 Sector funds: You should also avoid Fidelity’s sector funds (Select),
which invest in just one industry — such as air transportation, insur-
ance, or retailing. These funds have relatively high ongoing operating
expenses (often in excess of 1.5 percent per year) and have rapid
changeover of managers.
Being industry focused, these funds are poorly diversified and highly risky.
Fidelity, unfortunately, encourages a trader mentality with these funds.

Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 
Funds with branch offices: Even better?
Many mutual fund companies have their offices
in one location. If you happen to live in the town
or city where they’re located and want to do
business with them, you can visit them in
person. However, odds are that, unless you
maintain several homes, you won’t be living
near the fund companies with which you want
to do your fund-investing business.
Some fund companies, such as Fidelity, have
greater numbers of branch offices, which are
located primarily in densely populated and more
affluent areas. You may feel more comfortable
dropping a check off or speaking to an invest-
ment representative face to face instead of
being navigated through an automated voice
message system or mouse-clicking through a
Web site. However, there’s no sound financial
reason that you need to go in person to a fund
company — everything you need to do can be
done by phone, computer, or mail.
In most cases, you pay a cost for doing your
fund investing through firms with branch
offices. Operating all those branch offices in
areas where rent and employees don’t come
cheaply costs a good chunk of money.
Ultimately, firms that maintain a large branch
network need to build these extra costs into
their funds’ fees. Higher fees lower your invest-
ment returns.
A counterargument that fund companies with
many branch offices make is that if the branch
offices succeed in enticing more investors to
use the funds offered by the company, more
total money is brought in. Having more money
under management helps to lower the average
cost of managing each dollar invested.

One of Fidelity’s strengths is its local presence — it operates 100+ branch offices
throughout the U.S. and staffs its phones 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Dodge & Cox
Dodge & Cox is a San Francisco–based firm that has been in the fund busi-
ness since the Great Depression. It’s best known for its conservatively man-
aged funds with solid track records and modest fees.
The only problem has been that since earlier editions of this book have rec-
ommended their funds, over time, Dodge & Cox has closed two of their four
excellent funds to new investors. They did so to keep funds from becoming
too bloated with assets to manage, which could undermine the performance
of those funds. So, if any of their open funds appeal to you, you need to move
quickly to establish an account in case they shut any more of their funds to
new investors.
Oakmark
Harris Associates, which has managed money since 1976, is the investment
management company that oversees the management of Oakmark, this value-
oriented Chicago-based family of funds.
As with the Dodge & Cox funds (see the preceding section), a number of the
best Oakmark funds have closed to new investors, too. However, investors
who establish accounts directly with Oakmark can still buy some of the
closed funds.
T. Rowe Price
Founded in 1937, T. Rowe Price is one of the oldest mutual fund companies —
named after its founder, T. (Thomas) Rowe Price, who’s generally credited
with popularizing investing in growth-oriented companies. The fund company
has also been a fund pioneer in international investing.
T. Rowe Price remained a small company for many years, focusing on its spe-
cialties of U.S. growth stocks and international funds. That stance changed in
recent decades as the company offered a comprehensive menu of different
fund types. It offers 401(k) retirement plans specifically for smaller compa-
nies. The fund company also offers a series of money market and bond funds
called Summit funds. Although the minimum initial investment for Summit
funds is steep ($25,000), the operating expenses, at about 0.5 percent, are
reasonable (although still higher than Vanguard’s — see “The Vanguard
Group” earlier in this chapter).
127
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

TIAA-CREF
This nonprofit organization, whose roots date back to 1918, provides an array
of services to education and to nonprofit research organizations, as well as
offers a solid family of funds to the general public. Their funds have very low
operating expense ratios.
The funds’ low minimums make them a good choice for investors with
smaller sums to invest.
Other fund companies
With so many companies offering mutual funds, the number of them compet-
ing for your mutual fund dollars far exceeds those that are worthy of your
consideration. But here are some additional noteworthy fund companies:
 Artisan: This small family of well-managed stock funds is headquartered
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unfortunately, as the popularity of some of
their funds has grown in recent years, some of them have closed to 
new investors.
 Harbor: Based in Toledo, Ohio, Harbor Funds contracts with outside
money managers who manage money for affluent individuals and institu-
tions. Although Harbor fund managers don’t take great risks, their funds
are expected to — and are generally able to — outperform comparable
market indexes.
 Masters’ Select: The investment advisory firm of Litman/Gregory, which
manages money for affluent individuals and institutions, developed this
unique and small family of funds in 1997. Each of the funds within this
family, which is based in Orinda, California, contracts out the actual man-
agement of the investment dollars to a handful of top fund managers.
 USAA: Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, USAA is a conservative
family of efficiently managed mutual funds (and generally low-cost, high-
quality insurance). Although you (or a family member) need to be a mili-
tary officer, enlistee, or military retiree to gain access to its homeowner
and auto insurance, anyone can buy its mutual funds. USAA also offers
investors, with small amounts to invest (for example, $20 or $50 monthly)
and without several thousand dollars required to meet fund minimum
requirements, the ability to invest via electronic monthly transfers. 
128
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Hundreds of mutual fund companies offer thousands of funds. Many aren’t
worth your consideration because they don’t meet the common-sense selec-
tion criteria outlined in Chapter 7. So if you’re wondering why I didn’t men-
tion a particular fund family, it’s probably because the record shows that its
funds are high cost, low performance, managed in a schizophrenic fashion, or
all of the above. Check them out against the criteria in Chapter 7 to see for
yourself. (Note: In Part IV, where I recommend specific funds in varying fund
categories, I also mention some other funds offered by companies that aren’t
specifically written up in this chapter.)
One of the beauties of all the fund choices out there is that you don’t have to
settle for lousy or mediocre funds. If you’re wondering what to do with such
funds that you already own, please read Chapter 15.
Discount Brokers: Mutual 
Fund Supermarkets
For many years, you could only purchase no-load mutual funds directly from
mutual fund companies. If you wanted to buy some funds at, say, Vanguard,
Oakmark, T. Rowe Price, and Dodge & Cox, you needed to call these four dif-
ferent companies and request each firm’s application. So you ended up filling
out four different sets of forms and mailing them with four envelopes, four
stamps, and four separate checks.
Soon, you received separate statements from each of the four fund compa-
nies reporting how your investments were doing. (Some fund companies
make this even more of a paperwork nightmare by sending you a separate
statement for each individual mutual fund that you buy through them.)
Now suppose that you wanted to sell one of your T. Rowe Price funds and
invest the proceeds at Oakmark. Doing so was also a time-consuming pain in
the posterior, because you had to contact T. Rowe Price to sell, wait days for
them to send you a check for the sale’s proceeds, and then send the money
with instructions to Oakmark. Shopping this way can be tedious. Imagine
wanting to make a salad and having to go to a lettuce farm, a tomato farm,
and an onion farm to get the ingredients. That’s why we have supermarkets!
Not until 1984 did someone — Charles Schwab — come up with the idea to
create a supermarket for mutual funds. Charles Schwab is the discount broker
pioneer who created the first mutual fund supermarket (which other discount
brokers have since copied) where you can purchase hundreds of individual
funds from dozens of fund companies — one-stop mutual fund shopping.
The major benefit of such a service is that it greatly simplifies the paperwork
involved in buying and selling different companies’ mutual funds. No matter
129
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

how many mutual fund companies you want to invest in, you need to com-
plete just one application for the discount broker. And instead of getting a
separate statement from each company, you get one statement from the dis-
count broker that summarizes all your mutual fund holdings. (Note: You still
must maintain separate nonretirement and IRA accounts.)
Moving from one company’s fund into another’s is generally a snap. The dis-
count broker can usually take care of all this with one phone call from you.
Come tax time, you receive just one 1099 statement summarizing your fund’s
taxable distributions to record on your tax return.
You weren’t born yesterday, so you know that all this convenience must have
a catch. Here’s a hint: Because discount brokers serve as intermediaries for
the buying and selling of funds and the time and money spent sending you
statements, they expect to make some money in return. So guess what? It
costs you more to use a discount broker. Discount brokers charge you a
transaction fee whenever you buy or sell most of the better funds that they
offer. Leading discount brokers typically charge a flat fee of just $35 or so.
Buying direct versus discount brokers
Buying funds directly from fund companies versus buying funds through a
discounter’s mutual fund supermarket isn’t inherently better. For the most
part, it’s a trade-off that boils down to personal preference and individual 
circumstances.
Why to buy funds direct
Many reasons exist to buy funds directly from the company. Here are a few:
 You’re thrifty. And you can take that as a compliment. Being vigilant
about your investing costs boosts your returns. By buying direct from no-
load fund companies, you avoid the discount brokerage transaction costs.
 You don’t have much money to invest. If you’re investing less than
$5,000 per fund, the minimum transaction fees of a discount broker will
gobble up a large percentage of your investment. You don’t have to
hassle with transaction fees when you buy direct from a no-load fund
company.
 You’re content investing through one of the bigger fund companies with
a broad array of good funds. For example, if you deal directly with one
mutual fund company (such as Vanguard) that excels in all types of funds,
you can minimize your fees and maximize your investment returns. Given
the breadth and depth of the bigger companies’ fund selections, you
should feel content centralizing your fund investments through one of the
better companies. However, if you sleep better at night investing through
multiple fund companies’ funds, I won’t try to change your mind.
130
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Given the fact that most of the major fund companies, such as Vanguard,
Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price, have discount brokerage divisions offering mutual
funds from companies other than their own, you could use one of these com-
panies as your base and have the best of both worlds. Suppose, for example,
that you want to invest a large portion but not all of your money in Fidelity
funds. By establishing a discount brokerage account at Fidelity, all of your
Fidelity fund purchases would be free of transaction fees; then through that
same account, you could also buy other fund companies’ funds.
Why to buy through a discount broker
Here are the main reasons to go with a discount broker:
 You want to invest in funds from many fund companies. In general, dif-
ferent fund companies excel in different types of investments: You may
want to build a portfolio that draws on the specific talents of various
companies. Although you can buy directly through each individual fund
company, the point eventually comes where the hassle and clutter just
aren’t worth it. The one-stop shopping of a discount broker may well be
worth the occasional transaction fee.
 You hate paperwork. For those of you out there whose disdain of 
paperwork is so intense that it keeps you from doing things that you’re
supposed to do, a discount broker is for you.
 You want easy access to your money. Some discount brokerage accounts
offer such bells and whistles as debit cards and unlimited check-writing
privileges, making it simple for you to tap into your money. (That can be
a bad thing if this tempts you to spend your money!)
 You want to buy into a high-minimum fund. One unique feature avail-
able through some discount broker’s fund services is the ability to pur-
chase some funds that aren’t normally available to smaller investors.
 You want to buy funds on margin. Another interesting but rarely used
feature that comes with a brokerage account is that you can borrow on
margin (take out a loan from the brokerage firm) against mutual funds
and other securities (which are used as collateral) held in a nonretire-
ment account. Borrowing against your funds is generally lower cost than
your other loan options, and it’s potentially tax deductible.
You have a way (that involves hassle) to buy and sell your funds and use a
discounter but reduce the total transaction fees: Purchase your funds initially
from the mutual fund company and then transfer the shares at no charge into
a discount brokerage account. Conversely, when you’re ready to sell shares,
you can transfer shares from the discounter to the mutual fund company
before you’re ready to sell. (See Chapter 14 for details about transfer forms.)
131
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

Debunking “No Transaction Fee” funds
After several years of distributing funds for all these different fund compa-
nies, discount brokers came up with another innovation. Discount brokers
were doing a lot for mutual fund companies (for instance, handling the pur-
chase and sale of funds, as well as the ongoing account recordkeeping and
reporting), but they weren’t being paid for all their work.
In 1992, Charles Schwab & Company negotiated to be paid an ongoing fee 
to service and handle customer accounts by some mutual fund companies.
Today, through Schwab and other discount brokers who copied this service,
you can purchase hundreds of funds without paying any transaction fees (that
is, you pay the same cost as if you’d bought the funds through the mutual
fund company itself). These are called No Transaction Fee (NTF) funds.
On the surface, this idea certainly sounds like a great deal for you — the
mutual fund investor wanting to buy funds from various companies through a
discount brokerage account. You get access to many funds and one account
statement without paying transaction fees.
The no-transaction fee fund is a case of something sounding much better
than it really is. Although some discount brokers say or imply that NTF funds
are free, they’re hardly free. Discount brokers are able to waive the transac-
tion costs only because the participating fund companies have agreed to foot
the bill. In a typical arrangement, the participating fund company shares a
portion of its operating expense ratio with the discount broker handling the
account. But as you know if you read Chapter 7, annual operating expenses
are drawn from the shareholders’ investment dollars. So in the end, you’re
still the one paying the transaction costs.
As a group, NTF funds are inferior to the best no-load funds that you pay the
discounters a transaction fee to purchase because NTF funds tend to
 Have higher operating expenses than non-NTF funds
 Be offered by smaller, less experienced fund companies who may be
struggling to compete in the saturated mutual fund market
You’ll notice that big, well-established fund companies (including the
ones discussed earlier in this chapter, such as Vanguard, Fidelity, and T.
Rowe Price) don’t participate in NTF programs. They don’t have to; the
demand for their funds is high even with transaction costs.
In their rush to sign up more NTF funds, some discounters have ignored the
quality of the NTF funds they offer. Some financial publications encourage
and effectively endorse this lack of quality control by giving higher ratings 
(in articles purporting to review and rate various discount brokers) to those
discounters offering more “free” funds to customers. As with a restaurant
meal, more isn’t always better — quality counts as well!
132
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Whenever you make a mutual fund investment decision through a discount
broker, try not to be influenced by the prospect, or lack thereof, of a transac-
tion fee. In your efforts to avoid paying a small fee today, you can end up
buying a fund with high ongoing fees and subpar performance. If you’re so
concerned about paying additional fees, deal directly with mutual fund com-
panies and bypass the discount brokers and their transaction fees.
Using the best discount brokers
Although I’ve spoken of mutual fund companies and discount brokers as sep-
arate entities, the line between them has greatly blurred in recent years. For
example, Schwab started as a discount broker but later began selling its own
mutual funds. Other companies started selling mutual funds but have now
moved into the discount brokerage business. The most obvious example is
Fidelity, which offers discount brokerage services through which you can
trade individual securities or buy many non-Fidelity mutual funds.
Vanguard and T. Rowe Price have excellent discount brokerage divisions that
offer an extensive array of funds from other leading fund companies and
charge competitive transaction fees. Vanguard charges $35 per trade and $3
for regularly scheduled dollar-cost averaging trades; T. Rowe Price charges
$35 per trade.
The discount brokerage services of Fidelity, Vanguard, or T. Rowe Price make
a lot of sense if you plan on doing the bulk of your fund investing through
their respective funds. Remember, you only have to pay brokerage transac-
tion fees on funds offered by other fund companies. You won’t pay for buying
a Fidelity fund from Fidelity or a Vanguard fund from Vanguard or a T. Rowe
Price fund from T. Rowe Price.
If you’re already wondering how to get in touch with the companies that I 
recommend in this chapter, check out the Appendix, which includes the
phone numbers, Web sites, and mailing addresses for all these companies.
But before you put the cart before the horse, I strongly recommend that you
at least read through Part IV of this book. That’s where I recommend specific
funds and discuss how to assemble a top-notch portfolio of funds.
Places to Pass By
If someone set up what looks like a hot dog stand on the street corner and
started peddling mutual funds, would you buy a fund from that person?
Probably not, because such an outfit wouldn’t seem like a legitimate invest-
ment management company to you. Where are the computers, the telephone
equipment, and the fax machine? In the case of the street-corner stand,
you’re right to trust your instincts.
133
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

But don’t base your investment decisions on your gut: Some mutual fund com-
panies have plush offices and they charge relatively high fees for their funds
(to pay for all their overhead costs) or sell poorly performing funds — or both.
What types of places are likely to make you feel comfortable but lead you
astray? Many people do their fund investing through a list of wrong places:
 The First Faithful Community Bank: Many people feel comfortable turn-
ing their money over to the friendly neighborhood banker. You’ve done
it for years with your checking and savings accounts. The bank has an
impressive-looking branch close to your home, complete with parking,
security cameras, and a vault. And then there’s that FDIC insurance that
guarantees your deposits. So now that your bank offers mutual funds,
you may feel comfortable taking advice from the “investment specialist”
or “consultant” in the branch (and may erroneously believe that the
funds they sell carry FDIC coverage).
Well, the branch representative at your local bank is probably a broker
who’s earning commissions from the mutual funds he’s selling you. 
Bank funds generally charge sales commissions and higher operating
expenses and generally have less-than-stellar performance relative to
the best no-load funds. And because banks are relatively new to the
mutual fund game, the broker at your bank may have spent last year
helping customers establish new checking accounts and may have 
little knowledge and experience with investments and mutual funds.
Remember, if he’s working on commission, he’s a salesperson, not an
adviser. And the funds he’s selling are load funds. You can do better.
 Plunder and Pillage Brokerage Firm: Brokers work on commission, so
they can and will sell load funds. They may even try to hoodwink you
into believing that they can do financial planning for you. Don’t believe
it. As I discuss in Chapter 7, purchasing a load fund has no real benefit;
you have better alternatives.
 Fred, the Friendly Financial Planner: You may have met Fred through a
free seminar, adult education class, or a cold call that he made to you.
Fred may not really be a financial planner at all; instead, he could be a
salesperson/broker who sells load funds. (If you want to hire an objec-
tive planner or adviser for investing in funds, see the next section.)
 Igor, Your Insurance Broker: Igor isn’t just selling insurance anymore.
He now may sell mutual funds, as well, and may even call himself a finan-
cial consultant. (See the remarks above for brokers).
 The Lutheran-Turkish-Irish-Americans-Graduated-from-Cornell-and-
Now-Working-in-the-Music-Business Fund: Hoping to capitalize on the
booming fund business, special interest groups everywhere have been
jumping into the fray with funds of their own. Don’t be surprised if your
church, your alma mater, or your ethnic group makes a passionate pitch
to pool your money with that of like-minded individuals in the hands of a
manager who truly understands your background.
134
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Although something can possibly be said for group solidarity, I suggest
leaving your nest egg alone. Such special-interest funds carry loads and
high operating fees and, because they have relatively little money to
manage, are usually managed by money managers with little experience.
Hiring an Adviser: The Good, 
Bad, and Ugly
Dealing directly with various fund companies or simply selecting funds from
among the many offered through a discount brokerage service may seem
overwhelming to you. But don’t hire an adviser until you’ve explored the real
reasons why you want to hire help. If you’re like many people, you may hire
an adviser for the wrong reason. Or you’ll hire the wrong type of adviser, an
incompetent one, or one with major conflicts of interest. Check out the fol-
lowing sections for the highlights of why you should and why you shouldn’t
hire an adviser and for overall advice.
The wrong reason to hire an adviser
Don’t hire an adviser because of what I call the crystal ball phenomenon.
Although you know you’re not a dummy, you may feel that you can’t possibly
make informed and intelligent investing decisions because you don’t closely
follow or even understand the financial markets and what makes them move.
No one that you hire has a crystal ball. No one can predict future movements
in the financial markets to know which types of investments will do well and
which ones won’t. Besides, the financial markets are pretty darn efficient — a
lot of smart folks are following the markets, so it’s highly unlikely that you or
an adviser can predict what’s going to happen next. Investing intelligently in
mutual funds isn’t that complicated. You bought this book, so read it, and
you find out all you need to know to invest wisely in funds.
The right reasons to hire an adviser
Consider hiring an adviser if
 You’re too busy to do your investing yourself.
 You always put off investing because you don’t enjoy doing it.
 You’re uncomfortable making investing decisions on your own.
 You want a second opinion.
 You need help establishing and prioritizing financial goals.
135
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

Beware of conflicts of interest
The field of investment and financial planning is booby-trapped with land
mines awaiting the naive investor. A particularly dangerous one is the enor-
mous conflict of interest that’s created when “advisers” sell products that
bring them commissions.
If a financial planner or financial consultant sells products and works on com-
mission, he’s a salesperson, not a planner — just as a person who makes
money selling real estate is a real estate broker, not a housing consultant!
There’s nothing wrong with salespeople — you just don’t want one spouting
suggestions when you’re looking for objective investment and financial-
planning advice.
Here are some of the problems created by commission-based advice:
 Investments that carry commissions can pit your interests against
those of the broker selling them. The bigger the commission on a 
particular investment product, the greater the incentive the broker/
planner/adviser has to sell it to you.
 Investments that carry commissions mean that you have fewer dollars
working in the investments you buy. Commissions are siphoned out of
your investment dollars. When it comes to returns, noncommission
investments have a head start over commission ones.
 Investments that carry the highest commissions also tend to be among
the costliest and riskiest financial products available. They’re inferior
products; that’s why they need high commissions to motivate sales-
people to sell them.
 Planners who work on commission have an incentive to churn your
investments. Commissions are paid out whenever you buy or sell an
investment (every time you make a trade). So some commission-greedy
brokers/planners encourage you to trade frequently, attributing the
need to changes in the economy or the companies in which you’ve
invested. Not only does heavy trading fatten the broker/adviser’s wallet
at your expense, but also it’s a proven loser as an investment strategy.
(See Chapter 9 for more about investment strategies and your portfolio.)
 Planners who work on commission may not keep your overall finan-
cial needs in mind. You may want to fund your employer-sponsored
retirement plan or pay off your mortgage or credit card debt before you
start investing. The commission-based and money-managing planner has
no incentive to recommend such strategies for you; that would give you
less money to invest through them.
 Planners who work on commission may create dependency. They may
try to make it all so complicated that you believe you can’t possibly
manage your finances or make major financial decisions without them.
136
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

Your best options for help
You must do your homework before hiring any financial adviser. First, find out
as much as you can about the topic you need help with. That way, if you do
hire someone to help you make investment and other financial decisions,
you’re in a better position to evaluate his or her capabilities and expertise.
Realizing that you need to hire someone to help you make and implement
financial decisions can be a valuable insight. Even if you have a modest
income or modest assets, spending a few hours of your time and a few hun-
dred dollars to hire a professional can be a good investment. The services
that advisers and planners offer, their fees, and their competence, however,
vary tremendously.
Financial advisers make money in one of three ways:
 From commissions based on sales of financial products
 From fees based on a percentage of your assets that they’re investing
 From hourly consultation charges
If you read the preceding section, you already know why the first option is
the least preferred choice. (If you really want to or are forced to work with an
investment broker who works on commission, be sure to read the last section
in this chapter — “If you seek a salesperson.”)
A generally better choice than a commission-based planner is one who works
on a fee basis. In other words, the planner is paid by fees from clients such as
you, instead of from the investments and other financial products that he or
she recommends that you buy. This compensation system removes the incen-
tive to sell you products with high commissions and churn your investments
through a lot of transactions to generate more commissions. However, this
system still has potentially significant conflicts of interest.
Many of the leading discount brokerage and mutual fund companies now
offer advisory services (either in-house or through referrals), which typically
perform mutual fund management for a percentage of assets under their care.
With their in-house asset management, you probably won’t be able to get the
hand-holding, handshakes, and eye-to-eye contact that you would by hiring a
local financial-planning firm. However, if you’re looking at hiring a financial
adviser, I encourage you to consider and interview the advisory divisions of
the firms discussed in this chapter. Just be sure to put them through the
questions that I recommend in Chapter 22.
137
Chapter 8: Buying Funds from the Best Firms

The most cost-effective method is to hire an adviser who charges an hourly
fee and doesn’t sell investment and other financial products. Because he
doesn’t sell any financial products, his objectivity should be greater. He 
doesn’t perform money management, so he can help you get your financial
house in order and make comprehensive financial decisions, including select-
ing good mutual funds.
Your primary risk in selecting a planner, hourly based or otherwise, is hiring
one who’s competent. You can address this by checking references and 
discovering the difference between good and bad financial advice. You have
further risk if you and the adviser don’t clearly define the work to be done
and the approximate total cost before you begin. Don’t forget to set your
parameters upfront.
A drawback of an entirely different kind occurs when you don’t follow
through on your adviser’s recommendations. You paid for this work but
didn’t act on it: The potential benefit is lost. If part of the reason that you’re
hiring an adviser in the first place is that you’re too busy or not interested
enough to make changes to your financial situation, then you should look for
this support in the services you buy from the planner.
If you just need someone as a sounding board for ideas or to recommend
some specific no-load mutual funds, hire an hourly based planner for one or
two sessions of advice. You save money by doing the legwork and implemen-
tation on your own. Just make sure that the planner is willing to give you spe-
cific enough advice that you can implement it on your own. Some planners
will intentionally withhold specific advice and recommendations to create the
need for you to hire them to do more, perhaps even to manage your money.
If you have a lot of money that you want managed among a variety of mutual
fund investments, you can hire a financial adviser who charges a percentage
of your assets under management. Some also offer financial-planning serv-
ices. Some just manage money in mutual funds and other investments.
In the chapters ahead, I give you enough information for you to make wise
mutual fund investing decisions. You owe it to yourself to read the rest of the
book before deciding whether to hire financial help. Also, be sure to pay extra
close attention to Chapter 22, which covers the ten issues to consider and
questions to ask when hiring an adviser to help with mutual fund investing.
If you seek a salesperson
Despite the additional (and hence, avoidable) sales charges that apply when
you purchase a load fund instead of a no-load fund, you may be forced to, or
actually want to, buy a load fund through a salesperson working on commis-
sion. Perhaps you work for an employer that set up a retirement plan with
138
Part III: Separating the Best from the Rest 

only load funds as the investment option. Or your Uncle Ernie, who’s a stock-
broker, will put you in the family doghouse if you transfer your money out of
his firm and into no-load funds. Maybe you really trust your broker because
of a long-standing and productive investment relationship (but ask yourself
this: Is your success because of the broker or the financial markets?).
Protect yourself
If you’re comfortable and willing to pay commissions from 4 percent up to as
much as 8.5 percent to invest in mutual funds, you have a number of ways to
protect your money and well-being when working with brokers:
 Be aware that you’re working with a broker. Unlike the real estate 
profession in which an employee’s title — real estate broker or agent —
clearly conveys how she makes her money, many investment sales-
people today have labels that obscure what they do and how they make
money. Common misnomers include financial planner, financial consul-
tant, or financial adviser as names for salespeople who used to be called
stock, securities, or insurance brokers.
 Make sure that you’ve already decided what money you want to
invest and how it fits into your overall financial plans. This point is
one of the most important things for you to do first if you’re going to
invest through a commission-based investment salesperson. Guard
against being pushed into dollar amounts and/or investments that 
aren’t part of your financial plan.
Make sure you get the best funds
If you’ve optimized the structuring of your finances and you have a chunk 
of money that you’re willing to pay as a sales charge to invest in load funds,
make sure that you’re getting the best funds for your investment dollars. The
criteria to use in selecting those load funds are no different from those used
to select no-load funds:
 Invest in funds managed by mutual fund companies and portfolio man-
agers that have track records of expertise that take a level of risk that
fits your needs, and that charge reasonable annual operating expenses.
 Pay attention to the annual operating expenses that both load and no-
load funds charge. These fees are deducted from your funds’ returns in
much the same way that IRS taxes are deducted from your paycheck,
with one critical difference: Your pay stub shows how much you pay in
taxes, whereas your mutual fund account statement doesn’t show the
fund’s operating expense charges. You need the prospectus for that.
 Never invest in a mutual fund without knowing all the charges — sales
charges, annual operating expenses, and any annual maintenance or
account fees. You can find all these in a fund’s prospectus (see Chapter 7
for the scoop on how to decipher a prospectus).

A
lthough portfolio usually describes a collection of funds, it doesn’t have
to. For certain goals, one or two funds may be all that you need (for
example, a short-term bond fund and a money market fund for a home down
payment). Even for a long-term goal, such as retirement, you may select just
one fund; some mutual fund companies offer funds of funds, which, as the
name suggests, are mutual funds comprised of other mutual funds. (I cover
funds of funds in Chapter 12.) And although a portfolio is sometimes held
inside one account, it doesn’t have to be. The funds that make up your retire-
ment portfolio, for example, could be scattered across various accounts from
different investment companies.
This chapter shows you how to draw up a blueprint for your investing goals
that includes all the key considerations, including asset allocation (how you
divvy up your portfolio among different investments), tax implications (espe-
cially for portfolios held outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts), and
some mutual fund investing strategies. I then help you execute your plan.
Asset Allocation: An Investment Recipe
Asset allocation simply describes the proportion of different investment types
(stocks, bonds, international investments, and so on) that make up your
mutual fund portfolio. So if someone asks, “What’s your asset allocation?” a
typical response may be, “I have 60 percent in stocks, a third of which is in
foreign stocks, and 40 percent in bonds.”

You may hear a mutual fund nerd spout off about his allocation between
large-cap and small-cap stocks, or between growth funds and value funds. Don’t
worry about these terms for now. (Check out Chapter 12 for more info about
these terms.) Even after you finish reading this book and become a mutual
fund hotshot, you should be mostly concerned with the general asset alloca-
tion decisions: namely, allocating between stocks and bonds, and between
United States (U.S.) stocks and international stocks.
Allocating to reduce your risks
You wouldn’t have to worry about asset allocation if it weren’t for a simple
investment truth: The greater an investment’s potential return, generally the
greater the chance and magnitude of a short-term loss. If there were no chance
of loss, you could throw asset allocation out the window. No matter what
your savings goal, you could put all your money into stocks. After all, in com-
parison to bonds and money market investments, stocks should give you the
biggest long-term returns (see Chapter 1 for more details). If you had no
chance of loss when investing in stocks, every dollar you saved would go to
creating wealth in stocks. Your net worth would balloon.
In the real world, stocks are a volatile investment. Although providing the
highest long-term gains, stocks also carry the greatest risk of short-term loss
(compared with putting your money in bonds or money market accounts).
Asset allocation, then, is all about striking the right balance between your
desire for higher returns and your ability to withstand a short-term loss. All
things being equal, all people prefer higher returns. And although everyone
has a different personality and temperament about accepting risk, your real-
istic ability to withstand a loss depends primarily on your time horizon.
Looking toward your time horizon
The time horizon of a financial goal is the length of time between now and
when you expect to need the money to accomplish that goal. If you’re cur-
rently 30 years old and want to retire by age 60, then the time horizon of your
retirement investments is 30+ years from now (even though you’ll begin to
use some of your retirement money at age 60, some of it won’t be spent until
later in your retirement). If you’re saving to buy a home by the time you’re 35
years old, then the time horizon of that goal is five years from now.
The longer your time horizon, the more able you are to withstand the risk of a
short-term loss. For example, if you have a 30-year time horizon for retirement
144
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

investments, then a short-term loss isn’t a big deal — your investments have
plenty of time to recover. Thus, you probably want more of your retirement
dollars in growth investments, such as stocks.
Short-term goals
Asset allocation for goals with short time horizons is quite simple:
 Less than two years: If you have less than two years, you’re generally
best off sticking to money market funds. Stocks and bonds are volatile,
and although you have the potential for earning higher returns in stocks
and bonds, a money market fund offers the combination of terrific safety
and some returns. See Chapter 10 for more on money market funds.
 Between three and seven years: If your time horizon is between three
and seven years, then consider using shorter-term bond funds. (If you
have between two and three years, you can use both money market and
short-term bond funds.) When you’re able to keep your money in an
investment for several years, then the extra potential returns from low-
risk bonds begin to outweigh the risk of short-term loss from possible
bond market fluctuations. See Chapter 11 for more on bond funds.
 Seven or more years: If your time horizon is seven years or more, I think
that you have a long enough time horizon to start investing in stocks as
well as bonds.
Retirement and other long-term goals
Long-term goals, such as retirement and college tuition, require more com-
plex asset allocation decisions than those demanded by short-term goals. If
you plan to retire in your 60s, your retirement portfolio needs to fund your
living expenses for 20 or more years. That’s a tall order. Unless you have vast
wealth in comparison to your spending desires, the money you’ve earmarked
for retirement needs to work hard for you. That’s why a retirement portfolio,
particularly during your earlier working years, should be heavily weighted
toward investments with appreciation potential like stocks.
Your current age and the number of years until you retire should be the
biggest factors in your retirement asset allocation decision. The younger you
are and the more years you have before retirement, the more comfortable
you should be with growth-oriented investments, such as stock funds.
As you approach retirement age, however, you should gradually scale back
the risk and volatility of your portfolio. That’s why, as you get older, bonds
should become an increasingly bigger piece of your portfolio pie. Although
their returns are generally lower, bonds are less likely to suffer a sharp down-
swing in value that could derail your retirement plans.
145
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

Table 9-1 in the next section lists some guidelines for allocating money you’ve
earmarked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. All you need to figure
out is how old you are (I told you investing was easier than you thought!) and
the level of risk you’re comfortable with.
Factoring in your investment personality
In Table 9-1, I add a new variable to the asset allocation decision: your invest-
ment personality, or tolerance for risk. Even if you and another investor are the
same age, and you both have the same time horizon for your investments,
you could very well have different tolerances or desires to accept and deal
with risk. Some people are more apt to lose sleep over their investments, just
as some people are scared by roller coasters, whereas other people get a
thrill from them.

Be honest with yourself and invest accordingly. If you’re able to accept who
you are instead of fighting it, you’ll be a happier and more successful
investor. Here’s my advice for how to categorize yourself:
 Play it safe: Indicators of this investment personality include little or no
experience or success investing in stocks or other growth investments,
fear of the financial markets, and risk-averse behavior in other aspects
of life. You may desire to be conservative with your investments if you
have enough saved to afford a lower rate of return on your investments.
 Middle of the road: Indicators of this investment personality include some
experience and success investing in stocks or other growth investments,
and some comfort with risk-taking behavior in other aspects of one’s life.
 Aggressive: Indicators of this investment personality include past expe-
rience and success investing in stocks or other growth investments —
and a healthy desire and comfort with sensible risk-taking behavior in
other aspects of one’s life. You may also want to be more aggressive if
you’re behind in saving for retirement and you want your money to work
as hard as possible for you.
146
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

What does it all mean, you ask? Consider this example. According to Table
9-1, if you’re 35 years old and don’t like a lot of risk but recognize the value of
striving for some growth to make your money work harder (a middle-of-the-
road type), you should put 25 percent (35 – 10) into bonds and 75 percent
(110 – 35) into stocks.
Divvying up your stocks between home and abroad
Your next major asset allocation decision is to divvy up your stock investment
money between U.S. and international stock funds. This step is an important
one for keeping your portfolio properly diversified. Although some consider
international markets risky, putting all your stock market money into just one
country is even riskier, even if the country is relatively large and familiar, such
as the U.S.
When the U.S. market slumps, some markets do better. Moreover, developing
countries have the potential for greater economic growth and stock market
returns than the U.S. market. Here’s the portion of your stock allocation that I
recommend investing overseas, guided by your investment attitude:
 Play it safe: 20 percent
 Middle of the road: 33 percent
 Aggressive: 40 to 50 percent
So if you’re a 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road type who’s investing 75 percent
of your portfolio in stocks, you’d then put 33 percent of that stock money
into international stock funds. Multiplying 33 percent by 75 percent works
out to be about 25 percent of the entire portfolio. So you’d put 25 percent in
bonds, 50 percent in U.S. stocks, and 25 percent in international stocks.
Gradual change is better than abrupt change. If you’ve had little or no experi-
ence or success investing in stocks, you’re better to start with the play-it-safe
allocation and then work your way to more aggressive allocations as you
develop more comfort and knowledge.
College savings goals
Be careful when investing money for your child’s college education. Doing so
the wrong way can harm your child’s chances of getting needed financial aid
and can increase your tax burden (see Chapter 3 for more info).
The strategy for allocating money in a college savings portfolio can be similar
to that used for retirement money. Assuming that your child is young, the goal
is relatively long term, so the portfolio should emphasize growth investments,
such as stocks. However, as the time horizon decreases, bonds should play a
bigger role. The big difference, of course, between investing for your retirement
147
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

and investing for your child’s college costs is that the time horizon for college
depends not on your age, but on the age of the child for whom you’re investing.
Here’s my rule for investing college money for your kids. To figure how much
money you should put in bonds, take the following numbers:
 Play it safe: 60 + child’s age
 Middle of the road: 45 + child’s age
 Aggressive: 30 + child’s age
The rest of your college investment should go into stocks (with at least a
third in stocks overseas). Use this rule to adjust the mix as your child gets
older. For example, suppose that you have a 5-year-old, and you want to
follow a middle-of-the-road approach when investing her college money. In
this case, you could invest approximately 50 percent (45 + 5) in bonds, with
the remaining 50 percent in stocks, one-third of which you’d invest overseas.
Taxes: It’s What You Keep That Matters
Like asset allocation, tax implications are a fundamental consideration in
portfolio construction. When you’re constructing a mutual fund portfolio out-
side of a tax-sheltered retirement account, Uncle Sam gets to grab a share of
your returns. Part of what makes up a mutual fund’s returns are dividend dis-
tributions and capital gains, which are subject to taxation.
For this reason, when you’re investing outside of tax-sheltered retirement
accounts, you must distinguish between pre-tax and post-tax returns. Think
of it as the business world difference between revenue and profit. Revenue is
what a business collects from selling products and services; profit is what a
business gets to keep after paying all of its expenses, and in the end, that’s
what really matters to a business. Likewise, your after-tax return, not your
pre-tax return, should matter most to you when you invest your money.
Unfortunately, all too many investors (and often their advisers) ignore the tax
consequences and invest in ways that increase their tax burdens and lower
their effective returns. For example, when comparing two similar mutual funds,
most people prefer a fund that earns returns of 13 percent per year on aver-
age to a fund that earns 12 percent. But what if the 13 percent per year fund
causes you to pay a lot more in taxes? What if, after factoring in taxes, the 13
percent per year fund nets you just 9 percent, while the 12 percent per year
fund nets you an effective 10 percent return?
148
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

In the following sections, I help you plan how funds fit in your portfolio, given
your current tax bracket, and how to ensure that the tax bite is as painless as
possible. Check out Chapter 16 for all the ins and outs of accounting for your
funds when filing your tax return.
Fitting funds to your tax bracket
Fortunately, you can pick your funds to minimize the federal and state gov-
ernment’s share of your returns. Some funds, for example, are managed to
minimize highly taxed distributions, and certain government bond funds
focus on investments that generate tax-free income.
Understanding ordinary (marginal) income tax rates
To choose the right funds for your investment purposes, you must know your
marginal tax rate, which is the rate you pay on the last dollar you earn. For
example, if you earned $50,000 last year, the marginal rate is the rate you paid
on the dollar that brought you from $49,999 to $50,000. The government
charges you different tax rates for different parts of your annual income.
You pay less tax on your first dollars of earnings and more tax on your last
dollars of earnings. For example, if you’re single and your taxable income
totaled $50,000 during 2007, you paid federal tax at the rate of 10 percent on
the first $7,825 of taxable income, 15 percent on the income from $7,825 to
$31,850, and 25 percent on income above $31,850 (see Table 9-2). The rate
you pay on those last dollars of income (25 percent) is your marginal rate.
Your marginal tax rate allows you to quickly calculate how much tax you owe
on additional salary and certain types of nonsalary income, such as
 Interest from taxable bonds
 Interest from taxable money market funds
 Short-term capital gains (that is, gains from investments sold after being
held for one year or less)
Suppose that on top of your $50,000 salary you have some bond funds that
pay taxable interest in a nonretirement account that distributed $1,000 of div-
idends. Because you know your marginal tax rate — 25 percent — you know
that Uncle Sam gets $250 of that $1,000 distribution ($1,000 × 25 percent).
Note that states generally also levy income taxes. Table 9-2 shows federal tax
rates for singles and for married couples filing jointly.

Lower tax rates on stock dividends and long-term capital gains
In 2003, a major federal tax bill significantly lowered the tax rate applied to
 Dividends paid by corporations (domestic or foreign) on their stock
 Long-term capital gains (from profits on appreciated investments sold
after being held for more than one year)
For those in the four highest federal income tax brackets listed in Table 9-2
(25, 28, 33, and 35 percent), the tax rate on stock dividends and long-term
capital gains is just 15 percent. Taxpayers in the 10 and 15 percent federal
income tax bracket pay a mere 5 percent tax rate on dividends (in 2008, these
brackets’ dividend tax rate goes to 0).
Although the income paid on bond funds and money market funds is called a
dividend, such income doesn’t qualify for the new, lower federal income rates
on stock dividends. Dividend income that you receive from mutual funds
holding stocks qualifies for the lower dividend tax rate.
Minimizing your taxes on funds
Now that you’re equipped with knowledge about your tax bracket and tax
rates on various fund distributions (if you don’t have a clue and skipped the
preceding section, you may want to visit it before continuing here), the fol-
lowing sections enable you to understand how to select tax-friendly mutual
funds when investing outside of retirement accounts.
Use tax-free money market and bond funds
Certain kinds of money market and bond funds invest only in bonds issued
by governments, and depending on the type of government entity they invest
in, their dividends may not be subject to state and/or federal tax.
150
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Such funds are typically identified by the words Treasury or municipal in their
fund titles:
 A Treasury fund buys federal-government-issued Treasury bonds (also
called Treasuries), and its dividends — although federally taxable — are
free of state taxes.
 The dividends of a municipal bond fund, which invests in local and state
government bonds, are free of federal tax, and if the fund’s investments
are limited to one state and you live in that state, the dividends are free
of state taxes as well.
Because Treasuries and municipal bonds aren’t subject to complete taxation,
the governments issuing these bonds can pay a lower rate of interest than,
say, comparable corporate bonds (the dividends on which are fully taxable to
bondholders). Therefore, before taxes are taken into account, tax-free bond
and money market funds yield less than their taxable equivalents.
However, after taxes are taken into account, you may find that with tax-free
money market or bond funds, you come out ahead of comparable taxable
funds if your tax bracket is high enough. Because of the difference in taxes,
the earnings from tax-free investments can end up being greater than what
you’re left with from comparable taxable investments. If you’re in the 28 per-
cent federal bracket or higher (see Table 9-2), see Chapters 10 and 11 for
details on tax-free money market and bond funds.
Don’t buy tax-free funds inside retirement accounts. Your returns inside a
retirement account are already sheltered from taxation. Ignore the taxability
of funds and go for the highest yields.
Invest in tax-friendly stock mutual funds
Unfortunately, stock mutual funds don’t have a tax-free version like bond and
money market funds do. Unless they’re held inside a retirement account,
stock fund distributions are taxable. However, as discussed in the previous
sections, not all stock distributions and returns are treated equally from an
income tax standpoint. With stock funds, more than any other type of fund,
investors often focus exclusively on the pre-tax historical return, ignoring the
tax implications of their fund picks.
You can invest in stock funds that are tax friendly — in other words, funds
whose investing style keeps highly-taxed distributions to a minimum. Here’s
how stock funds can minimize taxable distributions:
 Buy-and-hold investing: Dividends and capital gains are two types of
stock fund distributions. Capital gains distributions are generated when
151
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

a fund manager sells a stock for a profit; that profit must then be given
out to the shareholders annually. Some fund managers always tinker
with their portfolios, and because of their frequent trading, their funds
tend to produce more distributions. But other fund managers are buy-
and-hold investors. These managers produce fewer capital gains distrib-
utions than their peers who trade frequently.
Index mutual funds tend to produce fewer capital gains distributions
because they hold their securities longer. (For more on indexing, see
“Fund Investing Strategies” later in this chapter, as well as Chapter 12 for
more details on stock index funds.)
 Long-term capital gains: Although no capital gains’ distributions are
best for minimizing taxes, a good manager ultimately sells some stocks
at a profit when he sees better opportunities elsewhere. When a fund
manager does sell stocks at a profit, you pay a far lower tax rate when
these realized gains are long term — from stocks held more than one
year. (See the section “Lower tax rates on stock dividends and long-term
capital gains,” earlier in this chapter.)
 Offsetting gains with losses: If a fund manager sells some stock for a
gain of $10,000 but sells other stock for a loss of $10,000, the capital
gains net out to zero. Some funds, managed specifically to minimize dis-
tributions, employ this offsetting technique to lower their capital gains. I
identify the best of these tax-managed stock funds in Chapter 12.
Watch the calendar
When purchasing stock mutual funds outside of tax-sheltered retirement
accounts, consider the time of year at which you purchase shares in funds.
December is the most common month in which mutual funds make capital
gains distributions. Most funds also make a dividend distribution around that
time as well. (Dividends are also sometimes distributed at other times of the
year, especially on bond funds.)
You don’t want to jump into a fund just before it makes a large distribution.
You’re not reaping any rewards from the capital gains distribution because,
right after such a distribution, the fund’s share price decreases to reflect the
size of the payout. You are, however, effectively making yourself liable for
taxes on gains you didn’t share in.
When making purchases late in the year, find out whether and when the fund
may make a significant capital gains and dividend distribution. Fund compa-
nies can usually tell you, in advance of the actual capital gains and dividend
distribution, approximately how much they expect the distribution to be. A
large December capital gains payout generally happens when a fund has had
a good performance year.
152
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Fund Investing Strategies
In this section, I discuss some of the different investing strategies and philoso-
phies that you can use to direct a mutual fund portfolio, and I also explain
which are best for you and which are best avoided. Having an overarching
strategy is vital for many reasons. Without a clear plan and approach, you’ll
have less success, more anxiety, and more temptation to fall prey to sales
pitches and unsound approaches.
Timing versus buy-and-hold investing
Over the past two centuries, stocks have produced an average return of about
10 percent per year. Some individual years are better, with stocks returning up
to 20 or even 30 percent or more; other years are worse, with stocks losing 20
percent or more in value. But when taken over a period of decades, the up years
and the down years historically net out to returns of about 10 percent per year.
Despite the long-term healthy returns stocks generally produce, it’s discon-
certing to some people to invest their money into something that can decline.
Many newsletters, advisers, and the like claim to predict the future move-
ment of the financial markets. On the basis of such predictions, these folks
advocate timing the purchase and sale of securities, such as stocks, to maxi-
mize returns and minimize risks.
Although market timing sounds good in theory, a wealth of studies and evi-
dence shows that market timing simply doesn’t work in practice. (In Chapter
18, I discuss the historically poor track record of investment newsletters that
attempt market timing.) In fact, those who try to time the markets inevitably
do worse than those who simply buy and hold, because they too often miss
the right times to buy and sell.
Market timing is based on that age-old investment mantra, “Buy low, sell
high.” It sounds so simple and logical; perhaps that’s what makes it such an
attractive concept. One fundamental problem, however, destroys the logic:
Recognizing a low or a high comes only with hindsight; market movements,
especially in the short term, are unpredictable. Telling someone to buy low
and sell high is similar to telling someone that it’s okay to drive his car if he
expects not to have an accident and that he should stay out of his car if he
expects to have an accident!
If buying and holding had an investment mantra, it would be “Buy now, sell
much later.” Instead of betting on short-term market movements, buy-and-hold
investors rely on long-term trends and aren’t so concerned with when to get
153
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

in and out of the market as much as how long they’re actually in there. Buy-
and-hold investors know that if they hang in there through the inevitable
tough times, the good years outnumber the bad, and they come out ahead.
Don’t jump in and out of funds. After you’ve bought into a decent fund, you
have few good reasons to move out of it (see Chapter 15). Not only does buy-
and-hold investing offer better returns, but also it’s less work and hassle.
Active versus index fund managers
Unlike other mutual funds, in which the portfolio manager and a team of ana-
lysts scour the market for the best securities, an index fund manager passively
invests to match the performance of an index. Index funds are funds that can
be (and, for the most part, are) managed by a computer. An index fund man-
ager invests the fund’s assets so as to replicate an underlying index, such as
Standard & Poor’s 500 index — 500 large-company U.S. stocks. An S&P 500
index fund generally buys and holds the same 500 stocks, and in the same
approximate amounts, that comprise the S&P 500 Index.
Index funds are underrated — they don’t get the credit they deserve. Index
funds are a little bit like Jaime Escalante, that Garfield High School math
teacher of poor children in the ghettos of Los Angeles (see the terrific movie,
Stand and Deliver, about him). In a school where kids often dropped out and
were lucky to learn some algebra, Escalante got his kids to master calculus.
In fact, he got entire classes to work hard and pass the college advanced
placement exam for calculus. (The College Board that administers the AP test
couldn’t believe that so many kids from this school could pass this exam, so
the kids were investigated for cheating — that’s how Escalante’s story was
discovered, and he finally got credit for all the great work that he did.)
Low-cost index funds work hard by keeping expenses low, staying invested,
and holding on to a relatively fixed list of stocks. So, like Escalante’s kids,
index funds are virtually guaranteed to be at the top of their class. Over long
periods (ten years or more), index funds outperform about three-quarters of
their actively-managed peers investing in the same types of securities! Most
actively managed funds can’t overcome the handicap of high operating
expenses that pulls down their funds’ rates of return. Because significant
ongoing research doesn’t need to be conducted to identify companies to
invest in, index funds can be run with far lower operating expenses. (See
Chapter 5 for discussion of the exchange-traded funds, which are index funds
you can buy and sell on a stock exchange.)
The average U.S. stock fund has an operating expense ratio of 1.5 percent per
year. (Some funds charge expenses as high as 2 percent or more per year.) That
being the case, a U.S. stock index fund with an expense ratio of just 0.2 percent
per year has an average advantage of 1.3 percent per year. A 1.3 percent dif-
ference may not seem like much, but in fact, the difference is significant.
154
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Because stocks tend to return about 10 percent per year, you’re throwing
away about 13 percent of your expected stock fund returns when you buy a
nonindex fund. If you factor in the taxes that you pay on your fund profits,
these higher expenses gobble even more of your after-tax profits.
Another often overlooked drawback to actively managed stock funds: Your fund
manager can make costly mistakes, such as not being invested when the market
goes up, being too aggressive when the market plummets, or just being in the
wrong stocks. An actively managed fund can easily underperform the overall
market index that it’s competing against. An index fund, by definition, can’t.
Table 9-3 lists the worst-performing U.S. stock funds over the past decade.
Note how much worse these bowser funds performed versus the major U.S.
stock market indexes (the performance of which one could replicate by
investing in an index fund).

When you invest in broadly diversified index funds, you never see your funds
in the list of the top-performing funds — but then you never see your funds in
the list of the worst-performing funds, either. Don’t overestimate your ability
to pick in advance the few elite money managers who manage to beat the
market averages by a few percentage points per year in the long run. And
then don’t overestimate the pros’ ability to consistently pick the right stocks.
Index funds make sense for a portion of your investments, especially when
investing in bonds and larger more-conservative stocks, where it’s difficult
for portfolio managers to beat the market. Index funds also make sense for
investors who are concerned that fund managers may make big mistakes and
greatly underperform the market.
155
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

As for how much you should use index versus actively managed funds, it’s
really a matter of personal taste. If you’re happy knowing that you can get the
market rate of return and knowing that you can’t underperform the market,
you can index your entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the game
of trying to pick the better managers and want the potential to earn better
than the market level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. A happy
medium is to do some of both.
Putting Your Plans into Action
Constructing a mutual fund portfolio is a bit like constructing a house:
There’s a world of difference between designing a plan and executing it. If
you’re the architect, your world is all clean lines on white paper. But if you’re
the general contractor responsible for executing the plan, your circum-
stances are generally messier; you may face such challenges as inclement
weather, unsuitable soil, and undependable construction workers.
Like the contractor, you’re bound to meet challenges in the execution of the
plan — in your case, constructing a mutual fund portfolio instead of a house.
Some of these challenges come from the funds themselves; your personal cir-
cumstances are the source of others. With patience, persistence, and a
healthy helping of my advice, all are surmountable. Investing in funds is
much, much easier than building a house — which is why you can do it your-
self if you so desire.
Determining how many funds 
and families to use
Suppose that you’ve used the discussion earlier in this chapter to nail down
an asset allocation for your retirement portfolio: 25 percent in bonds, 50 per-
cent in domestic stocks, and 25 percent in international stocks. That’s all
quite specific except for the fact that these percentages tell you nothing
about how many funds and how many fund families you should use to meet
these percentages. (I introduce the concept of fund families in Chapter 2).
You could do all your investing through one family of funds, given the sheer
number and quality of funds that the larger and better fund companies, such as
Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity, offer. Centralizing your investments in
one family saves on administrative hassles by cutting down on the number of
applications to complete, envelopes to open, statements to file, tax statements
to deal with, and so on. Plus, you’re more likely to find your way around better
at a company that you spend more of your time interacting with. Consider a
good argument against investing through one family of funds, though: Even the
best mutual fund companies don’t offer the best of every type of fund. By not
156
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

spreading out your funds over different fund families to take advantage of their
particular strengths, you may be sacrificing a little bit of return.
Discount brokerage services offer some of the best of both approaches. You
get one-stop shopping and one statement for all your holdings, but you also
have access to funds from many families. The downside: You pay small trans-
action fees to purchase many of the better funds through discounters. (I dis-
cuss discount brokerage services in detail in Chapter 8.)
You won’t find one right answer to how many fund families to work with and
whether to use a discount brokerage account. Choose the approach that
works best for your needs. I use a combination of these approaches by main-
taining accounts through a large mutual fund company while also using dis-
count brokerage services to buy funds from some of the smaller fund families
that are more of a hassle to work with. This strategy allows me to maximize
centralization while minimizing the transaction fees I have to pay.
As for the number of individual funds to hold in your portfolio, again, there’s
no one correct answer. The typical mutual fund is quite diversified to begin
with, so you needn’t invest in too many. In fact, because some funds invest
across different types of investments (known as hybrid funds) or even across
other funds (known as funds of funds), you may be able to achieve your
desired asset allocation by investing in just one fund.
So the answer to the question, “How many funds?” is based less on science
than it is on what’s practical for you and how much money you have to
invest. At a minimum, own enough funds so you’re able to diversify not only
across the general investment types (stocks, bonds) that you’ve targeted but
also across different types of securities within those larger categories —
bonds of various maturity lengths, stocks of various-size companies. (I
explain these concepts in Chapters 11 and 12.)
As your savings allow, I generally recommend that you invest at least $3,000
to $5,000 per fund. If you’re investing outside of a retirement account, most of
the better mutual funds require an initial investment of this magnitude anyway.
Inside a retirement account, you may invest less — typically only $500 or $1,000
per fund — to start. However, because most retirement accounts annually ding
you about $10 per fund as an account maintenance fee, you should aim to invest
the higher amounts so you don’t have your small investment devoured by high
relative fees. (A $10-per-year fee diminishes a $500 investment by 2 percent each
year.) Some fund companies waive this fee if you keep more than a certain
amount — $5,000, for example — in their funds.
As you have larger sums to invest, it makes sense to use more funds. Suppose
that you have $300,000 and want to divide it equally among bonds, U.S. stocks,
and international stocks. You could put $100,000 into each of three funds: one
bond fund, one U.S. stock fund, and one international stock fund. But with
that much money to invest, why not use at least two of each of the different
types of funds? That way, if the one international stock fund you’ve chosen
157
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

does poorly, all of your money earmarked for overseas investing isn’t doing
poorly in that fund. There’s no reason that you can’t use even three different
funds within each category. The more money you have, the more sense diver-
sifying across two or three funds per category makes.
And one more point: Don’t invest in more funds than you have time to track.
If you can’t find the time to read your funds’ semiannual and annual reports,
that’s a sign that you have too many funds. Extra diversification won’t make
up for a lack of monitoring.
Matching fund allocation 
to your asset allocation
One thing that can trip up your asset allocation plans is the fact that mutual
funds have their own asset allocations. For example, a hybrid fund may
invest 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds. Perhaps you, on the
other hand, want to invest 75 percent in stocks and 25 percent in bonds. How
the heck do you fit that kind of fund into your portfolio?
One option is to shun hybrid funds. Take Thoreau’s advice to simplify your
(investing) life: Avoid funds that invest in different investment types. Buy
purebreds — stock funds that are 100 percent (or close to 100 percent)
invested in stocks, bond funds that invest only in bonds, and international
stock funds that are entirely invested overseas. That way, your asset alloca-
tion calculations stay simple.
Take the desired mix of the hypothetical 35-year-old from earlier in this chap-
ter: 25 percent in bonds, 50 percent in U.S. stocks, and 25 percent in interna-
tional stocks. If she has $10,000 to invest and sticks to purebred funds, figuring
out how much money to put into each kind of fund is a simple matter of mul-
tiplying the desired allocation percentage by the $10,000 total to invest. In
this case, she should put $2,500 in a pure bond fund (25 percent × $10,000),
$5,000 in a U.S. stock fund, and $2,500 in an international stock fund.
If that seems a little too easy, you’re right. Even if they label themselves as pure-
breds, plenty of mutual funds are given leeway in their charters to dabble in
other investment types. Read the annual report of some so-called U.S. stocks
funds and you may find that up to 20 percent of their assets are invested in
bonds or international stocks.
Some hybrid funds are excellent funds, and eliminating them simply to avoid
a math problem seems a bit silly. Although I encourage you to focus on pure-
bred funds, fitting a hybrid fund, or a hybrid disguised as a purebred, into
your portfolio occasionally makes sense.
Let me get back to the example of the 35-year-old investor — the one who
wants a portfolio of 25 percent bonds, 50 percent U.S. stocks, and 25 percent
158
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

international stocks. Suppose that she’s picked out three funds she wants to
buy: a U.S. stock fund (100 percent stocks), an international stock fund (100
percent international stocks), and a hybrid fund (60 percent U.S. stocks, 40
percent bonds). Because the hybrid fund is the only one with bonds, the
investor needs to figure out how much to put into the hybrid fund so that she
ends up with about 25 percent (overall) in bonds. Because 40 percent of the
hybrid fund is invested in bonds, the arithmetic looks like this:
0.4 (40 percent) × Amount to be invested in fund = 0.25
Amount to be invested in fund = 0.25 ÷ 0.4
Amount to be invested in fund = 0.625 (or 62.5 percent)
I like nice, round numbers, so I rounded 62.5 off to 60. Here’s how much
money she should put into each fund to get her desired investment mix:
60 percent hybrid fund (60 percent in U.S. stocks, 40 percent in bonds)
15 percent U.S. stock fund (100 percent in stocks)
25 percent international stock fund (100 percent in international stocks)
Allocating when you don’t 
have much to allocate
If you’re just starting out, you may have little money to allocate. Here you’ve
spent all this time exploring how to design a terrific portfolio, and then,
thanks to minimum initial investment requirements, you may realize that you
only have enough money to buy one of the five funds you’ve selected!
Fear not. This problem has several answers:
 Buy a hybrid fund or a fund of funds (see Chapter 12) whose asset allo-
cation is similar to your desired mix. Don’t sweat the fact that you can’t
find a fund with the exact mix you want. For now, getting close is good
enough. When you’re able to afford it, you can, if you so desire, move
out of the hybrid fund and into the funds you originally chose.
 Buy your desired funds — one at a time — as you’re able to afford them.
I call this little trick diversifying over time, and it’s a perfectly legit.
One twist on this strategy that tests and perhaps improves your mutual
fund investing habits is to start by investing in the type of fund (bond or
international stock, for example) that’s currently doing the most poorly —
that is, buy when shares are on sale. Then the next year, add the fund
type that’s doing the most poorly at that time. (Make sure to buy the
better funds within the type that’s doing poorly!)
For more ideas, see Chapter 13 for sample portfolios for beginning investors.

Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

Investing large amounts: 
To lump or to average?
Most people invest money as they save it. If you’re saving through a company
retirement plan, such as a 401(k), this option is ideal: It happens automatically,
and you’re buying at different points in time, so even the world’s unluckiest
person gets to buy some funds at or near market bottoms.
But what if you have what to you seems like a whole lot of money that’s lolly-
gagging around in a savings or money market fund? Maybe it’s just piled up
because you’re thrifty, or maybe you recently inherited money or received a
windfall from work. You’re discovering more about how to invest this money,
but after you decide what types of investments you’d like to purchase, you
may be terrified at the thought of actually buying them.
Some people in this situation feel a sense of loss, failure, or even guilt for not
making better use of the money than just letting it sit in a savings or money
market account. Always remember one important thing: At least you’re earn-
ing a positive return in the bank or money fund, and it beats the heck out of
rushing into an investment that you don’t understand and in which you may
lose 20 percent or more. Of course, you have every reason to find the best
parking spot that you can for your money. (See Chapter 10 for recommenda-
tions of the best money market funds.)
So how do you invest your lump? One approach is to dollar-cost average it
into the investments you’ve chosen. This means that you invest your money
in equal chunks regularly, such as once a month or per quarter. For example,
if you have $50,000 to invest and you want to invest it once per quarter over
one year, you’d invest $12,500 per quarter until it’s all invested. Meanwhile,
the money that’s awaiting future investment happily continues accumulating
interest in a good money market fund. Take a look at the pros and cons of
this method of investing a large sum:
 Thumbs up: The attraction of dollar-cost averaging is that it allows you
to ease into riskier investments instead of jumping in all at once. The
benefit may be that, if the price of the investment drops after some of
your initial purchases, you can buy some later at a lower price. If you
invest all your money at once and then the financial markets get wal-
loped, it’s human to think, “Why didn’t I wait?”
History has proven that dollar-cost averaging is a great risk-reducing
investment strategy. If you’d used dollar-cost averaging during the worst
decade for stock investors in the last century (1928 to 1938), you still
would’ve averaged 7 percent per year in returns despite the Great
Depression and a sagging stock market.
160
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

 Thumbs down: The flip side of dollar-cost averaging is that if your
investments do what they’re supposed to and increase in value, you may
wish that you’d invested your money faster. Another possible drawback
of dollar-cost averaging is that you may get cold feet continuing to put
money in an investment that’s dropping in value. Some folks who are
attracted to dollar-cost averaging are afraid to continue boarding what
appears to be a sinking ship.
Dollar-cost averaging also can cause headaches with your taxes when it’s
time to sell investments held outside retirement accounts. If you buy an
investment at many different times and prices, the accounting is muddied
as you sell portions of the investment. Also, remember to try not to pur-
chase funds, particularly stock funds that have had a good year, late in the
year because most of these funds distribute capital gains in December.
In my opinion, dollar-cost averaging is most valuable when the money you
want to invest represents a large portion of your total assets and you can
stick to a schedule. Making it automatic is best so that you’re less likely to
chicken out and discontinue investing if your initial investment purchases
have declined in value from when you bought them.
Most mutual fund companies offer automatic exchange services. Pick a time
period that makes sense. I like to do dollar-cost averaging once per quarter
early in the quarter (the first of January, April, July, and October). If you feel
comfortable investing and want to get on with the program, averaging your
money over one year is fine, but it’s riskier. If you have big bucks to invest
and you’re cautious, you may prefer to average the money over two to five
years. (In this case, you can use some CDs or Treasury bills as holding places
in order to get a better return than on the money market fund.)
Sorting through your existing investments
A final question that people who want to start a comprehensive mutual fund
investment program, but who also have existing portfolios, frequently ask me
is what to do with their existing investments. Here are my thoughts:
 Keep the good nonfund investments. Although I’m a fan of mutual
funds, there’s no compelling reason for you to invest all your spare dol-
lars in funds. If you enjoy investing in real estate or securities of your
own choosing, go right ahead. You can account for these other invest-
ments when you tally up your asset allocation. As for evaluating the
mutual funds you may already own, see Chapter 15.
 Get rid of high-fee, poorly performing investments. As you understand
more about the best mutual fund investments, you may come to realize
161
Chapter 9: Perfecting a Fund Portfolio

by comparison how lousy some of your existing investments are. I won’t
stand in your way of dumping them!
 Pay attention to tax consequences. When you’re considering selling a
nonretirement account investment, especially one that has appreciated
considerably since its original purchase, be mindful of taxes. Assets held
for more than 12 months are eligible for the more favorable capital gains
tax rates (see Chapter 16).

B
ack in the days when Richard Nixon was President, people had hun-
dreds of alternatives for safely investing their spare cash — they could
schlep around town and shop among banks, banks, and still more banks.
Although it may seem that safe-money investors had many alternatives, they
really didn’t. As a result, yields weren’t all that great compared with what a
large institutional investor with millions of dollars to invest could obtain by
purchasing ultrasafe short-term securities.
Then in the early 1970s, money market mutual funds were born. The concept
was fairly simple. The money market mutual fund invested in the same safe,
higher-yielding financial instruments (which I discuss in the section
“Grasping what money funds invest in,” later in this chapter) that only those
with big bucks could buy. The money market fund then sells shares to
investors who don’t have vast sums to invest. By pooling the money from
thousands of investors, the fund offers investors a decent yield (after charg-
ing a reasonable fee to cover the operational expenses and make a profit). In
their first years of operation, these “people’s” money funds had little cash
flowing in. By 1977, less than $4 billion were in money market funds. But then
interest rates rose sharply as inflation took hold. Soon, bank depositors
found that the rates of interest they could earn could rise no more, because
banks were limited by federal regulations to paying 5 percent interest.
As interest rates skyrocketed in the late 1970s and investors found that they
could earn higher yields by switching from bank accounts to money market
funds, money flooded into those funds. Within just four years, money market
fund assets mushroomed more than fiftyfold to $200 billion. (Today, more
than $1 trillion resides in retail money market funds).

Money Market Funds 101
Money market mutual funds are a large and unique part of the mutual fund
industry’s offering. Money market funds are the only type of mutual fund whose
share price doesn’t fluctuate in value. The share prices of stock and bond
mutual funds fluctuate from day to day depending on how the stock and
bond markets are doing. Money market funds, in stark contrast, are locked in
at $1 per share. This section gives you the lowdown on these funds.
Comparing money funds 
with bank accounts
You make money with money market funds by earning dividends, similar to
the interest you earn on bank savings accounts. However, the best money
market mutual funds offer several significant benefits:
 Higher yields: What first attracted investors (including me as a young
adult) to money market funds (back when interest rates zoomed up in
the late 1970s and early 1980s) still holds true today. The best money
market mutual funds pay a higher yield than equivalent bank accounts,
despite the deregulation of the banking industry.
 Multiple tax flavors: Besides their lower rate of return, another problem
with bank savings accounts is that they come in one tax flavor: taxable.
There’s no such thing as a bank savings account that pays you tax-free
interest. Money market funds, however, come in a variety of tax-free ver-
sions, paying dividends free of federal or state tax or both. So, if you’re
in a high federal or state (or both) income tax bracket, money funds
offer you advantages that a bank savings account simply can’t.
 Check-writing privileges: Money market mutual funds allow you to
write checks, without charge, against your account. Most mutual fund
companies require that the checks be written for larger amounts — typi-
cally at least $250 — and may limit the number that can be written per
month. They don’t want you using these accounts to pay all your small
household bills because checks cost money to process.
 Convenient access to other mutual funds: After you’ve established a
money market mutual fund at a particular fund company, investing in
other funds offered by that company becomes a matter of placing a
simple toll-free phone call or clicking your computer mouse. (And, as 
I discuss in Chapter 8, if your chosen fund company has a discount 
164
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

brokerage division, you may also be able to invest in mutual funds from
other parent companies.) One centralized account eliminates the need
to complete additional application forms every time and reduces the
ongoing paperwork involved in tracking your funds. Paperwork nirvana!
 No lines and traffic jams: Because you can invest and transact in mutual
funds online, over the phone, and through the mail, you can save your-
self considerable hassle. Even though most banks are becoming more
technologically savvy, some bank transactions, including opening an
account, require you to drive to a bank branch. When you deal with a
fund, you’ve also eliminated the risk of being part of a crime scene, as
numerous bank branches today still suffer from robberies and holdups.
Sometimes, you get put on hold for a short time when you call a mutual
fund company. The better companies (the ones I recommend in this
book) generally won’t leave you hanging for more than 15 to 30 seconds.
If they do, please write me in care of the publisher and let me know so
that together we can hassle them or delete them from the next edition!
Banks have developed money market deposit accounts (MMDAs) that are
money fund wannabes. Banks set the interest rate on MMDAs, and it’s gener-
ally lower than what you can get from one of the better money market mutual
funds. Check writing on MMDAs, if it’s available, is usually restricted to just a
few checks monthly.
As latecomers to the mutual fund business, some banks now offer real money
market mutual funds, including tax-free money funds. Again, the better money
market mutual funds from mutual fund companies are generally superior 
(see my recommendations in the section “Finding the Recommended Funds,”
later in this chapter) to those offered by banks. The reason: Most bank
money market funds have higher operating expenses and hence lower yields
than the best money funds offered by mutual fund companies.
165
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank
How banks get away with paying less
How and why do banks continue to pay less
interest than most money funds? Two reasons:
 Banks have a lot of overhead due to all the
branch offices they operate.
 Banks know that they can get away with
paying lower yields because many of their
depositors, perhaps including you, believe
that the FDIC insurance that comes with a
bank account makes it safer than a money
market mutual fund. I dispel this myth in the
section “I won’t have FDIC insurance,” later
in the chapter.

Finding uses for money funds
The best money market funds are the ideal substitute for a bank savings
account — offering equivalent safety to a bank, but a much better yield.
Money market funds are well suited for some of the following purposes:
 Your emergency cash reserve: Money market funds are a good place to
keep your emergency cash reserve. Because you don’t know what the
future holds, you’re wise to prepare for the unexpected — events such
as job loss, unanticipated medical bills, or a leaky roof. Three to six
months’ worth of living expenses is a good emergency reserve target for
most people (for example, if you spend $3,000 in an average month, keep
$9,000 to $18,000 reserved).
You may be able to get by with just three months’ living expenses if you
have other accounts, such as a 401(k) or family members and close
friends that you could tap for a loan. Consider keeping up to one year’s
expenses handy if your income fluctuates wildly. If your profession
involves a high risk of job loss, and if finding another job could take a
long time, you also need a significant cash safety net.
 Short-term savings goals: If you’re saving money for a big-ticket item
that you hope to purchase within the next couple of years — whether
it’s a fishing boat or a down payment on a home — a money market fund
is a terrific place to accumulate and grow the money. With such a short
time horizon, you can’t afford to expose your money to the gyrations of
stocks or longer-term bonds. A money market fund offers not only a safe
haven for your principal but also a yield that should keep you a step
ahead of the inflation rate.
 A parking spot for money awaiting investment: Suppose that you have
a chunk of money that you want to invest for longer-term purposes but
you don’t want to invest it all at once for fear that you may buy into
stocks and bonds just before a big drop. A money market fund can be a
friendly home to the money awaiting investment as you purchase into
your chosen investment gradually over time. (This technique is known
as dollar-cost averaging, which I explain in Chapter 9.)
 Personal checking accounts: You can use money market funds with no
restrictions on check writing for household checking purposes. Some
discount brokerage services that offer accounts with a check-writing
option downplay the fact that an investor is allowed to write an unlim-
ited number of checks (in any amounts) on his or her account. You can
leave your bank altogether — some money funds even come with debit
cards that you can use at bank ATMs for a nominal fee! Later in this
chapter (in the section “Finding the Recommended Funds”), I point out
specific funds that offer unlimited check-writing privileges.
166
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

 Business accounts: You can also open a money market fund for your
business. You can use this account for depositing checks received from
customers and holding excess funds, as well as for paying bills by means
of the check-writing feature. Some money funds allow checks to be writ-
ten for any amount, and such accounts can completely replace a bank
checking account.
You can also establish direct deposit with most money market funds. You can
have your paycheck, monthly Social Security benefit check, or most other
regular payments you receive from larger organizations zapped electronically
into your money market mutual fund account.
Refuting common concerns
Investors new to money market mutual funds sometimes worry about what
they’re getting themselves into. It’s good to be concerned and educated
before you move your money into securities you’ve never invested in. Most
people don’t worry about the money they keep in the bank. They should — at
least a little. First of all, banks get burglarized and defrauded more than mutual
funds! (A thief created a bogus ID and visited five branches of my bank, posing
as me, and succeeded in withdrawing $400 from my checking account. The
bank covered the loss, but I chose to take my business elsewhere.)
The biggest risk of keeping extra money in a bank savings account is that
inflation erodes your money’s purchasing power because of the paltry inter-
est you’re getting. Remember: The FDIC insurance system is a government
insurance system — not an ironclad, 100-percent safety guarantee. This sec-
tion presents the concerns that I hear about money market funds, and the
reasons I think that you shouldn’t worry about them.
I won’t have FDIC insurance
Some people are nervous about money market mutual funds because they
aren’t “insured.” Bank accounts, on the other hand, come with insurance that
protects up to $100,000 you have deposited (assuming that your bank partici-
pates in the FDIC system). So, if a bank with FDIC insurance fails because it
lends too much money to people and companies that go bankrupt or
abscond with the funds, you should get your money back (up to $100,000).
But consider this: Part of the reason that money market funds aren’t insured
is that they don’t really need to be. Mutual fund companies can’t fail because
they have a dollar invested in securities for every dollar you deposit in their
money funds. Banks, on the other hand, are required to have available just 12
cents for every dollar you hand over to them; that’s why they need insurance.
167
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank

It’s possible that a money market fund’s investments may decline slightly in
value — thus reducing the share price of the money market fund below a
dollar. In a few cases, money market funds have held some securities that
ended up tanking. However, in each and every case (except for one, which I
discuss next), the money market fund was bailed out — that is, cash was
infused into the money fund by the mutual fund company, thus enabling the
fund to maintain a price of $1 per share.
One money market fund, however, did break the buck. A newspaper article
dramatically headlined, “Investors Stunned as a Money Fund Folds,” went on
to say, “The fund’s collapse is the latest blunder to shake investors’ confi-
dence in the nation’s mutual fund industry.” Although such hype may help to
fill readers with anxiety (and perhaps sell more newspapers), it obscures sev-
eral important facts. This particular money fund didn’t collapse; it was liqui-
dated because its investors, who were all small banks, owned the fund, and
they decided to disband it. The fund didn’t hold money from retail investors
like you and me. If it had, the fund company surely would’ve bailed it out, as
other fund companies have done. You should also know that only 6 percent
of the investing banks’ money was lost. Hardly a collapse — and I doubt that
anyone was stunned!
If you have more than $100,000 in one bank and that bank fails, you can lose
the money over the $100,000 insurance limit. I’ve seen more than a few cases
where people had several hundred thousand — in one case, a person who
came to me for advice had nearly $2 million — sitting in a bank account! Now
that’s risk! Since 1980, more than 1,000 banks have failed. In recent years,
because the government has taken a hard line on not going beyond the
$100,000 limit, bank depositors have lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Stick with larger mutual fund companies if you’re worried about the lack of
FDIC insurance. They have the financial wherewithal and the most incentive
to save a floundering money fund. Fortunately, the larger fund companies
have the best money funds anyway.
The check may get lost or stolen
No one can legally cash a check made payable to you. Don’t mistakenly think
that going to your local bank in person is safer — you could slip on some dog
droppings or get carjacked.
If you’re really concerned about the mail, use a fund company or discount
broker with branch offices. I don’t recommend spending the extra money and
time required to send your check by way of registered or certified mail. You
know if your check got there when you get the statement from the fund com-
pany processing the deposit. (In those rare cases where a check does get
lost, know that checks can be reissued.) And when you’re depositing a check
made payable to you, be sure to endorse the check with the notation “for
deposit only” along with your account number under your signature.

Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

I may have trouble accessing my money
Although it may appear that you can’t easily and quickly access your money
market fund holdings, you can, in fact, efficiently tap your money market
fund in a variety of ways (Note: You can use these methods at most fund
companies, particularly the larger ones):
 Check writing: The most efficient way to access your money market
fund is to write a check. Suppose that you have an unexpectedly large
expense that you can’t afford to pay out of your bank checking account.
Just write a check on your money market mutual fund.
 Electronic transfers: Another handy way to access your money (which
may be useful if your money fund checkbook is hidden under a moun-
tain of papers somewhere in the vicinity of your desk) is to call the fund
company and ask them to have money sent electronically from your
money market fund to your bank account or vice versa. (Such transac-
tions can also be done on some fund companies’ Web sites.) Or if you
prefer, you can have the fund company mail you a check for your
desired amount from your money fund.
If you need money regularly sent from your money market fund to, say,
your local bank checking account, you can set up an automatic with-
drawal plan. On a designated day of the month, your money market fund
electronically sends money to your checking account.
169
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank
When the bank or credit union may be better
Although I advocate use of the best money
market funds, I realize that a bank or credit
union savings account is sometimes the most
practical place to keep your money. Your local
bank, for example, may appeal to you if you like
being able to do business face to face. Perhaps
you operate a business where a lot of cash is
processed; in this case, you can’t beat the con-
venience and other services that a local bank
offers. And, if you have only $1,000 or $2,000 to
invest, a bank savings account may be your
better option; the best money market funds gen-
erally require a higher minimum initial investment.
For investing short-term excess cash, you may
first want to consider keeping it in your checking
account. This option may make financial sense if
the extra money helps you avoid monthly service
charges because your balance occasionally
dips below the minimum. In fact, keeping money
in a separate savings account rather than in
your checking account may not benefit you if
service charges wipe out your interest earnings.
Don’t forget to shop around for the best deals on
your checking account because minimum bal-
ance requirements, service fees, and interest
rates vary. Credit unions offer some of the best
deals, although they usually don’t offer exten-
sive access to free ATMs. The largest banks
with the most ATM machines — you know, the
ones that spend gobs of money on advertising
jingles and billboards — usually offer the worst
terms on checking and savings accounts.

 Wiring: If you need cash in a flash, many money market funds offer the
option of wiring money to and from your bank. Both the money market
fund and the bank usually assess a small charge for this service. Most
companies also send you money via an overnight express carrier, such
as Federal Express, if you provide them with an account number.
 Debit cards: Brokerage account money funds that offer debit cards
allow access to your money through bank ATMs.
Chapter 14 explains how to establish these account features. Unlike when
you visit a bank, you can’t simply drop by the branch office of a mutual fund
company and withdraw funds from your account. They don’t keep money in
branch offices because they’re not banks. However, you can establish the
preceding account features, if you didn’t set them up when you originally set
up your account, by mailing in a form or by visiting the fund’s branch office.
Grasping what money funds invest in
Under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, money
market funds can invest only in the most credit-worthy securities, and their
investments must have an average maturity (when the short-term bonds pay
off) of less than 90 days. The short-term nature of these securities effectively
eliminates the risk of money funds being sensitive to changes in (short-term)
interest rates.
The securities that money market funds use are extremely safe. General-
purpose money market funds invest in government-backed securities, bank
certificates of deposits (CDs), and short-term corporate debt issued by the
largest and most credit-worthy companies and the United States (U.S.) gov-
ernment (although that may not be much comfort to some of you). The fol-
lowing sections explain the major types of securities that money funds hold.
Commercial paper
Corporations, particularly large ones, often need to borrow money to help
make their businesses grow and prosper. In the past, most companies need-
ing a short-term loan had to borrow money from a bank. In recent decades,
issuing short-term debt or IOUs — commercial paper — directly to interested
investors has become easier. Money market funds buy high-quality commer-
cial paper that matures typically within 60 to 90 days and is issued by large
companies (such as Boeing, Exxon Mobil, Hewlett-Packard, Home Depot,
Microsoft, and Wal-Mart), banks, and foreign governments.
If you had hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest, you could purchase
commercial paper yourself instead of buying it indirectly through a money
market fund. If you do have a lot of money to invest, I don’t recommend this
170
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

approach. You incur fees when you purchase commercial paper yourself, and
you most likely lack the expertise to know how to evaluate credit risks and
what a fair price to pay is. The best money funds charge a small fee to do all
this analysis for you, plus they offer perks, such as check-writing privileges.
Certificates of deposit
You can go to your local bank and invest some money in a certificate of
deposit (CD). A CD is nothing more than a specific-term loan that you make to
your banker — ranging anywhere from a month to some number of years.
Money market funds can buy CDs as well. The only difference is that they
invest a lot more money — usually millions — in bank CDs. Thus, they can
command a higher interest rate than you can get on your own. Money funds
buy CDs that mature within a few months. The money fund is only insured up
to $100,000 per bank CD, just like the bank insurance that customers receive.
As with other money fund investments, the money fund does research to
determine the credit quality of banks and other institutions that it invests in.
Remember that money funds’ other investments aren’t insured.
Money market funds may hold some other types of CDs. U.S. branches of for-
eign banks issue Yankee CDs. Foreign banks or the foreign branches of U.S.
banks issue Eurodollar CDs.
Government debt
McDonald’s has signs in many locations saying that billions and billions 
have been served. Well, the federal government also serves up trillions and
trillions — of dollars in debt, that is — in the form of Treasury securities. A
truckload of federal government debt is outstanding — about $9 trillion.
Most money market funds invest a small portion of their money in Trea-
suries soon to mature. Money funds also invest in short-term debt issued by
government-affiliated agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, which
provides funds to the nation’s savings and loans, and the Federal National
Mortgage Association, which packages and sells government-backed mortgages.
Government agency debt, which money funds also invest in, unlike
Treasuries, isn’t backed by the “full faith and credit of the U.S. government.”
However, no federal agency has ever defaulted on its debt and such a situa-
tion is unlikely to happen. The folks back in Washington are certain to avoid
the loss of faith in government-issued debt that would surely follow should
such a default be allowed to occur.
As I discuss in more detail later in the chapter, some money market funds
specialize in certain types of government securities that distribute tax-free
income to their investors. Treasury money market funds, for example, buy
Treasuries and pay dividends that are state-tax-free, but federally taxable.
171
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank

State-specific municipal money market funds invest in debt issued by state
and local governments in one state. The dividends on state money funds are
federal- and state-tax-free (if you’re a resident of that state).
Other types of securities
Other types of securities typically make up small portions of a money fund’s
holdings. These types include the following:
 Repurchase agreements (repos) are overnight investments that money
funds send to dealers (banks and investment banks’ securities divisions),
and the money fund receives Treasury securities overnight as collateral.
 Bankers’ acceptances are more complex: They’re issued by banks guaran-
teeing corporation debt incurred from trade. For example, if Sony sends
televisions from overseas to the U.S. by freight but doesn’t want to wait
for its money until the ship comes in and the stores pay them for the tele-
visions, Sony can get paid right away by borrowing from a bank based
on the expected delivery of the televisions. The stores get the televisions
and pay for them, and then Sony’s loan gets repaid.
Choosing a Great Money Market Fund
A money market fund is probably the easiest type of mutual fund to select. To
save you time and make you the most money, the following sections describe
the major issues to consider when selecting money funds.
Why yield and expenses go hand in hand
Within a given category of money market fund (general, Treasury, or munici-
pal), money fund managers are investing in the same basic securities. The
market for these securities is pretty darned efficient, so superstar money
fund managers may eke out an extra 0.1 percent of yield over their competi-
tors but not much more.
However, money funds can differ significantly from one another in yield due
to expenses. For money market funds more than for any other kind of fund,
operating expenses are the single biggest determinant of return. All other
conditions being equal (which they usually are with money market funds),
lower operating expenses translate into higher yields for you.
172
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

For money market funds, you shouldn’t tolerate annual operating expenses
greater than 0.5 percent. Top quality funds charge 0.25 percent or less annu-
ally. Remember, lower expenses don’t mean that a fund company is cutting
corners or providing poor service. Lower expenses are possible in most
cases because a fund company has been successful in attracting so much
money to invest. As I discuss in Chapter 11, fund companies with consistently
low expenses on their money funds also generally offer good bond funds.
Looking at your tax situation
You’ve perhaps heard the expression, “It’s not what you make; it’s what you
keep.” What you keep on your investment returns is what’s left over after the
federal and state governments take their cut of your investment profits. If
you’re investing money held outside of a retirement account and you’re in a
high tax bracket (particularly the federal 28 percent or higher bracket), you
173
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank
Money funds 20 percent off!
Some money market mutual funds aren’t above
resorting to the marketing tricks that retailers
use. Beware of money fund managers running
specials or sales. They try to lure investors by
temporarily waiving (also known as absorbing)
operating expenses. These sales tricks create
money fund yields that are a lot like muscles on
steroids: artificially pumped up. When the fund
managers start thirsting for profits — and with
time they will, because these aren’t charities —
they simply reinstate operating expenses, and
then you can watch the air go out of the yield
balloon. Some bond mutual funds (see Chapter
11) engage in this deceptive practice as well.
Some fund companies run sales because they
know that a major portion of the fund buyers
lured in won’t bother leaving (or knowing) when
the operating expenses are jacked up. To get the
highest long-term yield from money funds, you’re
best off sticking with funds that maintain every-
day low prices for operating expenses. You can
ensure that your fund isn’t running a special by
asking what the current operating expense ratio
is and whether the fund is waiving some portion
of the expenses. You may also discern this status
by checking the annual operating expense ratio
in the fund’s prospectus (see Chapter 7).
If you want to move your money to companies
having specials and then move it back out when
the special is over, you may come out a little
ahead in your yield. If you have a lot of money
and don’t mind paperwork, this strategy may be
worth the bother. But don’t forget the value of
your time, lost interest when a check is in the
mail, and the chance that you may not stay on
top of the fund’s expense changes.

may come out ahead by investing in tax-free money market funds instead of
taxable ones. If you’re in a high-tax state, a state-specific money market fund
(if a good one is available in your state) may be a sound move. (See “Finding
the Recommended Funds” section for specific fund recommendations.)
Tax-free refers to the taxability of the dividends paid by the fund. Don’t con-
fuse this term with the effective tax deductions you get on contributions to a
retirement account, such as a 401(k).
Deciding where you want your home base
Convenience is another important factor in choosing where to establish a
money market fund. For example, if you’re planning on investing in stock and
bond mutual funds at T. Rowe Price, that may be the best place for you to
open up a money market fund as well. Although you may get a slightly higher
money market yield from another fund company, opening up a separate
account may not be worth the administrative hassle, especially if you don’t
plan on keeping much cash in the money fund.
174
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
Determining whether tax-free money 
market funds net you more
If you’re in the highest federal tax brackets (see
the federal tax rate chart in Chapter 9), you usu-
ally come out ahead in tax-free investments.
The only way to know is to crunch the numbers.
In order to do the comparison properly, factor in
federal as well as state taxes. Suppose, for
example, that you call Vanguard, which tells you
that its Prime Money Market fund currently
yields 5.0 percent. The yield or dividend on this
fund is fully taxable.
Suppose further that you’re a resident of
California and that Vanguard’s California Money
Market fund currently yields 3.5 percent. The
California tax-free money market fund pays div-
idends that are free from federal and California
state tax. Thus, you get to keep all 3.5 percent
that you earn. The income you earn on the
Prime Money Market, on the other hand, is
taxed. So here’s how you compare the two:
yield on tax-free fund ÷ yield on taxable fund
.035 (3.5 percent) ÷ .05 (5.0 percent) = 0.70
In other words, the tax-free fund pays a yield of
70 percent of that on the taxable fund. Thus, if
you must pay more than 30 percent (1 – 0.70) in
federal and California state tax, you net more in
the tax-free fund.
If you do this analysis comparing some funds
today, be aware that yields bounce around. The
difference in yields between tax-free and tax-
able funds widens and narrows a bit over time.
Instead of simply comparing the current yield on
a tax-free versus a taxable money fund, com-
pare the two funds’ yields over the past year.

If you don’t mind the extra paperwork, you can go for the extra yield. Calculate
(based on the yield difference) the costs of keeping a lower-yielding money
fund. Every tenth (0.1) of a percent per $10,000 invested costs you $10 in lost
dividends annually.
Keeping your investments close to home
Most mutual fund companies don’t have local branch offices. Generally, main-
taining few offices helps fund companies keep their expenses low and their
yields higher. You may open and maintain your money market mutual fund
through the fund’s toll-free phone line, the mail, and the Internet.
Except for psychological security, selecting a fund company with an office in
your area doesn’t offer much benefit. But I don’t want to downplay the impor-
tance of your emotional comfort level. Fund providers Fidelity, Schwab, and
TD Ameritrade have larger branch networks. Depending on where you live,
you may be near one of the fund companies I recommend. (See the Appendix.)
Considering other issues
Most, but not all, money market funds offer other useful services, such as free
check-writing privileges, fund exchange and redemption via telephone and
the Internet, and automated, electronic exchange services with your bank
account. The fund companies I recommend generally offer these features, so
these shouldn’t be deciding factors when debating among fund options. As I
mention earlier in this chapter, most money funds require that you write
checks for at least $250 or $500. Some funds don’t have this restriction,
which may be important if you want to pay smaller bills out of the account.
Another potentially important issue is the initial minimum investment
required to open an account. Most funds require a minimum investment of
$3,000 or so, although some require heftier amounts. If you drop below the
minimum at most money market funds, it’s no big deal and no charge is
assessed. Some money funds do, however, charge small fees for use of cer-
tain features. I discuss these fees in the next section.
Finding the Recommended Funds
Using the criteria I discuss in the previous section, in this section I recommend
the best money market funds. Vanguard funds dominate the list because they
offer rock-bottom expenses as well as most of the other goodies.
175
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank

Taxable money market funds
Money market funds that pay taxable dividends are appropriate for retire-
ment account funds awaiting investment as well as nonretirement account
money when you’re not in a high federal tax bracket and not in a high state
tax bracket. Here are the best taxable money market funds to consider (call
the fund companies for current yields):
 Vanguard’s Prime Money Market (VMMXX) has a microscopic operating
expense ratio of 0.29 percent per year. Like most Vanguard funds, it
requires $3,000 to open. www.vanguard.com; % 800-662-7447
 TIAA-CREF Money Market (TIAXX) matches Vanguard’s rock-bottom
annual expense ration of 0.29 percent. Minimum to open an account is
$2,500. www.tiaa-cref.org; % 800-223-1200
 Fidelity’s Spartan Money Market (SPRXX) has a much higher initial
investment minimum: $25,000. Its expense ratio is 0.42 percent. Fidelity
Spartan money funds charge $2 per check written (waived if your bal-
ance is greater than $50,000). If you’re seeking maximum money market
returns and don’t keep big balances, Vanguard’s a better choice. www.
fidelity.com; % 800-544-8888
 Fidelity Cash Reserves (FDRXX), which has an operating expense ratio
of 0.45 percent, is for those folks who can’t afford Spartan’s high mini-
mums (see previous bullet). FDRXX offers other taxable fund options:
only a $2,500 minimum initial investment.
 T. Rowe Price Summit Cash Reserves (TSCXX) has a minimum initial
investment of $25,000 and an expense ratio of 0.45 percent per year. If
you’re doing the bulk of your investing through a fund company other
than heavyweights Vanguard or Fidelity, it’s your call whether you should
do your money fund investing there as well. www.troweprice.com; 
% 800-638-5660
U.S. Treasury money market funds
U.S. Treasury money market funds are appropriate if you’re not in a high fed-
eral tax bracket but are in a high state tax bracket. Check out these funds:
 Vanguard Treasury Money Market (VMPXX) has a $3,000 minimum and
0.29 percent operating expense ratio. For big-balance investors who can
handle the $50,000 minimum initial investment requirement, Vanguard
Admiral Treasury Money Market (VUSXX) offers a higher yield, thanks
to this fund’s 0.13 percent annual expense ratio. www.vanguard.com;
% 800-662-7447
176
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

 USAA’s Treasury Money Market (UATXX) has a 0.46 percent operating
cost and a $3,000 minimum initial investment. www.usaa.com; % 800-
531-8181
 Fidelity’s Government Money Market (SPAXX) has an expense ratio 
of 0.42 percent. This fund’s minimum initial investment is $25,000 for
nonretirement accounts. Fidelity Spartan money funds charge $2 per
check written (waived if your balance is greater than $50,000). www.
fidelity.com; % 800-544-8888
You can bypass Treasury money market funds and their operating fees by
purchasing Treasury bills directly from your local Federal Reserve Bank for
no fee. Although you save yourself expenses by going this route, you lose
convenient access to your money. You have no check-writing privileges: If
you need to tap the Treasuries before they mature, it’s a bit of an administra-
tive hassle and will cost you a brokerage fee. With Vanguard’s expense ratios
on their Treasury money funds, it “costs” you $29 per year with a $10,000 bal-
ance; $65 per year with a $50,000 balance in Admiral.
177
Chapter 10: Money Market Funds: Beating the Bank
All-in-one discount brokerage accounts
As I discuss in Chapter 8, some discount bro-
kers offer all-in-one accounts that combine
unlimited check writing with investing. These
accounts can certainly reduce the paperwork
in your life: Everything from your monthly utility
bills to your mutual fund holdings is consoli-
dated on one account statement. These
accounts are usually built around some kind of
hub, a temporary holding place for the money
that’s waiting to be either spent or invested. This
part is the portion of the account you can write
checks against, funnel dividends into, and pur-
chase investments with. You’re usually given an
option on how you want to hold this hub money.
Look at your options carefully, and don’t make
the mistake of leaving your money in the default
option.
With some all-in-one brokerage accounts, the
hub may be called something like your core
account. Your first option for the core account
may be to keep it in cash. Although you do earn
interest on it, that interest is fully taxable and
offers a much lower yield than from a taxable
money market fund.
Especially if you’re in a higher tax bracket, the
better choice may be to use a municipal money
market fund that pays federally tax-free divi-
dends. You also have the option to put your cash
in a state-specific money market fund if you
happen to live in a state in which the account
provider offers such a fund: This strategy
shields your dividends from state as well as fed-
eral taxes.
Of course, money funds outside of the core
options don’t give you features such as unlim-
ited check writing, but you may be able to get a
higher yield. You can always keep a small
amount of money in one of the core options to
cover any check-writing needs.

Municipal tax-free money market funds
Municipal (also known as muni) money market funds invest in short-term
debt issued by state and local governments. Dividends from municipal money
funds are generally free of federal taxes. Those investors who limit their
investing to just one state are generally free of state taxes as well (provided
you live in that state).
You may be saying to yourself that state-specific muni funds are the way to
go. Not so fast. You may not have to worry about shielding your dividends
from state taxes if you live in a state that meets any of the following criteria:
 Doesn’t impose any income tax, such as Florida (you lucky dog)
 Charges a lower income tax (less than 5 percent), such as Michigan
 Has a higher income tax but no decent state-specific money market
funds to invest in
If you live in any of those states and if you’re in a high federal tax bracket,
you may be better off with a national money market funds, whose dividends
are free of federal but not state tax. (Call the fund companies for current
yields.) Check out these funds:
 Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market (VMSXX) has a 0.13 percent
annual expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum initial investment
to open. www.vanguard.com; % 800-662-7447
 T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market (TRSXX) has a 0.45 
percent annual expense ratio and requires a $25,000 minimum initial
investment to open. www.troweprice.com; % 800-638-5660
 USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market (USEXX) has a 0.47 percent annual
expense ratio and requires a $3,000 minimum initial investment to open.
www.usaa.com; % 800-531-8181
State-specific money market funds, whose dividends are free of both federal and
state taxes if you live in the specified state, are appropriate when you’re in a
high federal and state tax bracket. The major fund providers highlighted else-
where in this chapter for having good money funds (Fidelity, USAA, Vanguard)
offer competitive funds for states such as California, Florida, Massachusetts,
Maine, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. If you can’t
find a good state-specific money fund for your state or you’re only in a high
federal tax bracket, you need to use one of the nationwide muni money mar-
kets just described.

Bond Funds: When Boring 
Is Beautiful
In This Chapter
 Defining bonds
 Understanding how bond funds differ from one another
 Knowing when and why to invest in bond funds
 Selecting short-, intermediate-, and long-term bond funds
 Considering CDs, GICs, and other alternatives to bond funds
M
any investors, both novice and expert, think that the b in bonds is for
boring. And they’re partly correct. No one gets excited by bonds —
unless she’s an investment banker or broker who deals in bonds and makes
fat paychecks from them.
But take the time in this chapter to get the whole scoop on bonds. They may
seem boring, but they generally offer higher yields than bank and money
market accounts without the amount of volatility of stocks.
Understanding Bonds
So what the heck is a bond? Let me try to explain with an analogy. If a money
market fund is like a savings account, then a bond is similar to a certificate of
deposit (CD). With a five-year CD, for example, a bank agrees to pay you a
predetermined annual rate of interest — such as, say, 4.5 percent. If all goes
according to plan, at the end of five years of earning the 4.5 percent interest,
you get back the principal that you originally invested.
Bonds work about the same way, only instead of banks issuing them, corpora-
tions or governments issue them. For example, you can purchase a bond,
scheduled to mature five years from now, from a company such as Wal-Mart.
A Wal-Mart five-year bond may pay you, say, 6 percent. As long as Wal-Mart
doesn’t have a financial catastrophe, after five years of receiving interest 

payments (also known as the coupon rate) on the bond, Wal-Mart returns
your original investment to you. (Note: Zero coupon bonds pay no interest
but are sold at a discounted price to make up for it.)
The worst that can happen to your bond investment is that, if Wal-Mart filed
bankruptcy, then you may not get back any of your original investment, let
alone the remaining interest. You shouldn’t let this unlikely but plausible sce-
nario scare you away from bonds for several important reasons:
 Bonds can be safer than you think. Many companies need to borrow
money (and thus issue bonds) and are good credit risks. If you own bonds
in enough companies — say, in several hundred of them — and one or
even a few of them unexpectedly take a fall, their default (failure to pay
back interest or principal on time) affects only a sliver of your portfolio
and wouldn’t be a financial catastrophe. A bond mutual fund and its man-
agement team can provide you a diversified portfolio of many bonds.
 You’re rewarded with higher interest rates than comparable bank
investments. The financial markets and those who participate in them —
people like you and me — aren’t dumb. If you take extra risk and forsake
FDIC insurance, you should receive a higher rate of interest investing in
bonds. Guess what? All the Nervous Nellie savers who’re comforted by
the executive desks, the vault, the guard in the lobby, and the FDIC
insurance logo at their local bank should remember that they’re being
paid less interest at the bank because of all those comforts.
If you like the government backing afforded by the FDIC program, you
can replicate that protection in bond mutual funds that specialize in gov-
ernment-backed securities. (See the section “Eyeing Recommended
Bond Funds,” later in this chapter.)
 Bond alternatives aren’t as safe as you might like to believe. Any
investment that involves lending your money to someone else or to
some organization carries risk. That even includes putting your money
into a bank or buying a Treasury bond issued by the federal govern-
ment. (Although I’m not a doomsayer, any student of history knows that
governments and civilizations fail. It’s not a matter of whether they will
fail; it’s a question of when.)
In the last section of this chapter, “Exploring Alternatives to Bond Funds,” I
discuss some potentially higher-yield alternatives to investing in bond funds.
There, you see that with those higher yields comes greater risk. After all,
there’s no free lunch in the investing world.
Sizing Up a Bond Fund’s Personality
Bond funds aren’t as complicated and unique as people, but they’re certainly
more complex than money market funds. And thanks to some shady marketing
180
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

practices by particular mutual fund companies and salespeople who sell
funds, you have your work cut out for you in getting a handle on what many
bond funds really are investing in and how they differ from their peers. But
don’t worry: I take the time to explain these important details for the good
funds that I recommend later in this chapter.
After you know four key facts about bond funds — maturity, credit rating, the
different entities that issue bonds, and, therefore, the tax consequences on
those bonds — you can put the four together to understand how mutual fund
companies came up with so many different types of bond funds. For example,
you can buy a corporate intermediate-term high-yield (junk) bond fund, or a
long-term municipal bond fund. In the following sections, you see the combina-
tions are many.
Maturity: Counting the years until 
you get your principal back
In everyday conversation, maturity refers to that quiet, blessed state of grace
and wisdom that you develop as you get older (ahem). But that’s not the kind
of maturity I’m talking about here. Maturity, as it applies to bonds, simply
refers to when the bond pays you back — it could be next year, 5 years from
now, 30 years from now, or longer. Maturity is the most important variable by
which bonds, and therefore bond funds are differentiated and categorized.
You should care plenty about how long a bond takes to mature because a
bond’s maturity gives you a good (although far from perfect) sense of how
volatile a bond will be if interest rates change (see Table 11-1). If interest
rates fall, bond prices rise. See Chapter 1 for an explanation of why interest
rates and bond values move in opposite directions.

*Assumes that bonds are yielding approximately 7 percent. If bonds were assumed to be yielding
more, then a 1 percent increase in interest rates would have less of an impact. For example, if
interest rates are at 10 percent and rise to 11 percent, the price change of the 20-year bond is 
–8 percent.
181
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

Bond funds are portfolios of dozens — and in some cases hundreds — of indi-
vidual bonds. You won’t need to know the maturity of every bond in a bond
mutual fund. A useful summarizing statistic to know for a bond fund is the
average maturity of its bonds. In their marketing literature and prospectuses,
bond funds typically say something like, “The Turbocharged Intermediate-
Term Bond Fund invests in high-quality bonds with an average maturity of 7
to 12 years.”
Bond funds usually lump themselves into one of three maturity categories:
 Short-term bond funds: These funds concentrate their investments in
bonds maturing in the next few years.
 Intermediate-term bond funds: This category generally holds bonds
that come due within five to ten years.
 Long-term bond funds: These funds usually hold bonds that mature in
15 to 20 years or so.
The above definitions aren’t hard and fast. One long-term bond fund may
have an average maturity of 14 years while another may have an average of
25 years.
You can run into problems when one intermediate-term fund starts bragging
that its returns are better than another’s. It’s the old story of comparing apples
to oranges. When you find out that the braggart fund has an average maturity
of 12 years and the other fund has a maturity of 7, then you know that the 
12-year fund is using the “intermediate-term” label to make misleading compar-
isons. The fact is, a fund with bonds maturing on average in 12 years should be
generating higher returns than a fund with bonds maturing on average in 7
years. The 12-year fund is also more volatile when interest rates change.
The greater risk associated with longer-term bonds, which suffer price declines
greater than do short-term bonds when interest rates rise, often comes with
greater compensation in the form of higher yields.
Most of the time, longer-term bonds pay higher yields than do short-term
bonds. You can look at a chart of the current yield (“today”) of bonds of vary-
ing length maturities, which is known as a yield curve. Most of the time, this
curve slopes upward (see Figure 11-1). Many leading financial publications
and Web sites carry a current chart of the yield curve.
Duration: Measuring interest rate risk
If you’re trying to determine the sensitivity of bonds and bond funds to
changes in interest rates, duration may be a more useful statistic than matu-
rity. A bond fund with a duration of ten years means that if interest rates rise
by 1 percent, then the value of the bond fund should drop by 10 percent.
(Conversely, if rates fall 1 percent, the fund should rise 10 percent.)
182
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Trying to use average maturities to determine what impact a 1 percent rise or
fall in interest rates will have on bond prices forces you to slog through all
sorts of ugly calculations. Duration is no fuss, no muss — and it gives you one
big advantage, too. Besides saving on number crunching, duration enables you
to compare funds of differing maturities. If a long-term bond fund has a dura-
tion of, say, 12 years, and an intermediate fund has a duration of 6 years, the
long-term fund should be about twice as volatile to changes in interest rates.
Although duration is easier to work with and a better indicator than average
maturity, you’re more likely to hear about average maturity because a fund’s
duration isn’t that easy to understand. Mathematically, it represents the point
at which a bondholder receives half (50 percent) of the present value of her
total expected payments (interest plus payoff of principal at maturity) from 
a bond. Present value adjusts future payments to reflect changes in the cost
of living.
If you know a bond fund’s duration, which you can obtain from the fund com-
pany behind the bond fund you’re interested in, you know almost all you
need to know about its sensitivity to interest rates. However, duration hasn’t
been a foolproof indicator: As interest rates have risen, some funds have
dropped more than the funds’ durations predicted. But bear in mind that
some heavy investing in unusual securities (such as derivatives) was required
to make duration unreliable — so the duration values of the better funds,
which I recommend in this chapter, should work just fine as a guide. Also be
aware that other factors — such as changes in the credit quality of the bonds
in a fund — may affect the price changes of a bond fund over time.

Credit quality: Determining whether 
a bond fund is dependable
Bond funds also differ from one another in terms of the creditworthiness of
the bonds that they hold. That’s just a fancy way of saying, “Hey, are they
gonna stiff me or what?”
Every year, bondholders get left holding nothing but the bag for billions of
dollars when their bonds default. You can avoid this fiasco by purchasing
bonds that are unlikely to default, otherwise known as high-credit-quality
bonds. Credit rating agencies — Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, Duff & Phelps,
and so on — rate bonds based on credit quality and likelihood of default.
The credit rating of a security depends on the company’s (or the government
entity’s) ability to pay back its debt. Bond credit ratings are usually done on
some sort of a letter-grade scale: For example, in one rating system, AAA is
the highest rating, with ratings descending through AA and A, followed by
BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and so on. Funds that mostly invest in
 AAA and AA rated bonds are considered to be high-grade or high-credit-
quality bond funds; bonds of this type have little chance of default.
These bonds are considered to be investment quality bonds.
 A and BBB rated bonds are considered to be general bond funds 
(moderate-credit-quality). Like AAA and AA rated bonds, these bonds 
are known as investment quality bonds.
 BB or lower rated bonds are known as junk bond funds (or by their more
marketable name, high-yield funds). These funds expect to suffer more
defaults — perhaps as many as a couple of percent of the total value of
the bonds per year or more. Unrated bonds have no credit rating because
they haven’t been analyzed or evaluated by a rating agency.
Lower-quality bonds are able to attract bond investors by paying them a
higher interest rate. The lower the credit quality of a fund’s holdings, the
higher the yield you can expect a fund to pay (to hopefully more than offset
the effect of potential defaults).
Issuer: Knowing who you’re lending to
Bonds also differ according to which type of entity is issuing them. Here are
the major options:
 Treasuries: These are IOUs from the biggest debtor of them all — the
United States (U.S.) federal government. Treasuries include Treasury
bills (which mature within a year), Treasury notes (which mature
between one and ten years), and Treasury bonds (which mature in 
184
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

more than ten years). All Treasuries pay interest that’s state-tax-free but
federally taxable.
 Municipals: Munis are state and local government bonds that pay feder-
ally tax-free and state-tax-free interest to those who reside in the state 
of issue. The governments that issue municipal bonds know that the
investors who buy municipals don’t have to pay most or any of the
income tax that normally would be required on other bonds — which
means that the issuing governments can get away with paying a lower
rate of interest. Later in this chapter (in the section “How to obtain tax-
free income”), I explain how to determine if you’re in a high enough tax
bracket to benefit from muni bonds.
 Corporates: Issued by companies such as General Motors and Mattel,
corporate bonds pay interest that’s fully taxable.
 Mortgages: You can actually get back some of the interest you’re paying
on your mortgage by purchasing a bond fund that holds it! Yes, some
bond funds specialize in buying mortgages and collecting the interest
payments. Strange concept, isn’t it — buying a mortgage? The repayment
of principal on these bonds is usually guaranteed at the bond’s maturity by
a government-sanctioned organization such as the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae) or the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae).
 Convertibles: These are hybrid securities — bonds that you can convert
into a preset number of shares of stock in the company that issued the
bond. Although these bonds do pay interest, their yield is lower than
nonconvertible bonds because convertibles offer you the upside poten-
tial of being able to make more money if the underlying stock rises.
 International bonds: You can buy most of the preceding types of bonds
from foreign issuers as well. In fact, international corporate and govern-
ment bonds are the primary bonds that foreign bond mutual funds may
hold. International bonds are riskier because their interest payments
can be offset by currency price changes and may be riskier due to politi-
cal instability and insufficient information.
Management: Considering the 
passive or active type
Some bond funds are managed like an airplane on autopilot. They stick to
investing in a particular type of bond (such as high-grade corporate), with a
target maturity (for example, an average of ten years). Index funds that invest
in a relatively fixed basket of bonds — so as to track a market index of bond
prices — are good examples of this passive approach. And now, exchange-
traded funds (ETFs) are index bond funds that trade on a major stock
exchange. See Chapter 5 for more on ETFs.
185
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

At the other end of the spectrum are aggressively managed funds. Managers
of these funds have significant freedom to purchase bonds that they think
will perform best in the future. For example, if a fund manager thinks that
interest rates will rise, he’ll buy shorter-term bonds (remember that shorter-
term bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than longer-term bonds)
and keep more of a fund’s assets in cash. The fund manager may be willing to
invest more in lower-credit-quality bonds if he thinks that the economy is
going to improve and that more companies will prosper and improve their
credit standing.
Aggressively managed funds gamble. If interest rates fall instead of rise, the
fund manager who moved into shorter-term bonds and cash suffers worse
performance. If interest rates fall because the economy sinks into recession,
lower-credit-quality bonds suffer from a higher default rate and depress the
fund’s performance even further.
Some people think that predicting which direction interest rates and the
economy are heading is fairly easy. The truth is that economic predictions
are difficult. In fact, over long periods of time (ten or more years), meaningful
predictions are almost impossible.
Investing some of your bond fund money in funds that try to be well posi-
tioned for changes in the economy and in interest rates may be a good move.
But remember that if these fund managers are wrong, you can lose more
money. Over the long term, your best bet is efficiently managed funds that
stick with a fixed investment objective — such as holding intermediate-term,
high-quality bonds — and don’t try to time and predict the bond market. If
you or a bond fund manager consistently knew which way interest rates were
headed, you could make a fortune by trading interest-rate futures that lever-
age your investment. But no one knows — so don’t even try!
Trying to beat the market can lead to getting beaten. Some bond funds have
fallen on their faces after risky investing strategies backfired (see Chapter 7).
Interestingly, bond funds that charge sales commissions (loads) and higher
ongoing operating fees are the ones more likely to have blowups. This may be
because these fund managers are under more pressure to try and boost
returns to make up for these higher fees.
Inflation-indexed Treasury bonds
In 1997, the U.S. federal government introduced a new type of Treasury bond
that’s inflation proof: inflation-indexed Treasuries. In theory, these relatively
new Treasury bonds should better meet the needs of inflation-fearing
investors.
186
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

An investor with, say, $10,000 to invest could recently have purchased a ten-
year, regular Treasury bond that yielded 4 percent interest, or about $400,
annually. Now, contrast this regular Treasury bond with its new inflation-
indexed brethren. The ten-year inflation-indexed bonds issued at the same
time yielded about 2 percent. Before you think that this low yield is a rip-off,
know that this is a real (as in not affected or eroded by inflation) rate of
return of 2 percent.
The other portion of your return with these inflation-indexed bonds comes
from the inflation adjustment to the $10,000 principal you invested. The infla-
tion portion of the return gets added back into principal. So if inflation runs
at, say, 2.5 percent, after one year of holding your inflation-indexed bond,
your $10,000 of principal would increase to $10,250.
So, no matter what happens with the rate of inflation, the investor who
bought the inflation-indexed bond always earns a 2 percent return above and
beyond the rate of inflation. If inflation leaps to 10, 12, or 14 percent, or more,
as it did in the early 1980s, the holders of inflation-indexed Treasuries won’t
have the purchasing power of their principal or interest eroded by inflation.
Holders of regular Treasury bonds, however, won’t be as fortunate because at
a continued double-digit annual inflation rate, holders of these 4 percent
yield bonds would have a negative real (after inflation) return.
Because inflation-indexed Treasuries protect the investor from the ravages of
inflation, they represent a less risky security. In the investment world, lower
risk usually translates into lower returns.
Of course, the rate of inflation can and will change in the future. For the ten-
year bonds chosen in my example, inflation needs to exceed 2 percent per
year for the holders of the inflation-indexed bonds to come out ahead of
those holding the regular Treasury bonds. If inflation were running at, say, 3
percent per year, the total return of inflation-indexed bonds would be 5 per-
cent, exceeding the 4 percent on the regular Treasury bonds.
Income-minded investors need to know that the inflation-indexed Treasuries
only pay out the real return, which in the preceding example was just 2 percent.
The rest of the return, which is for increases in the cost of living, is added to
the bond’s principal. Thus, relative to regular Treasury bonds, which pay out
all their returns in interest, the inflation-indexed Treasuries pay little usable
interest. Therefore, they don’t make sense for nonretirement account
investors who seek maximum income to live on.
For recommended inflation-indexed Treasury funds, please see the “Eyeing
Recommended Bond Funds” section, later in this chapter. (Also know that
regular bond fund managers may invest some of their fund’s assets in infla-
tion-indexed Treasuries if they appear attractive relative to other bonds.)
187
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

Investing in Bond Funds
It’s time to get down to how and why you might use bonds. Bonds may be
boring, but they can be more profitable for you than super-boring bank sav-
ings accounts and money market funds. Bonds pay more than these invest-
ments because they involve more risk: You’re purchasing an investment
that’s meant to be held for a longer period of time than savings accounts and
money market funds.
That doesn’t mean that you have to hold a bond until it matures, because an
active market for them does exist. You can sell your bond to someone else in
the bond market (which is exactly what a bond fund manager does for share-
holders who want out of a bond fund). You may receive more — or less — for
the bond than you paid for it depending on what has happened in the finan-
cial markets since then.
As I discuss earlier, in the section “Maturity: Counting the years until you get
your principal back,” bond funds are riskier than money market funds and
savings accounts because their value can fall if interest rates rise. However,
bonds tend to be more stable in value than stocks (see Chapter 1).
Why you might (and might not) 
want to invest in bond funds
Investing in bonds is a time-honored way to earn a better rate of return on
money that you don’t plan to use within at least the next couple of years. As
with other mutual funds, bond funds are completely liquid on a day’s notice,
but I advise you to view them as longer-term investments. Because their
value fluctuates, you’re more likely to lose money if you’re forced to sell the
bond fund sooner rather than later. In the short term, the bond market can
bounce every which way; in the longer term, you’re more likely to receive
your money back with interest.
Don’t invest your emergency money in bond funds — use a money market
fund instead (see Chapter 10). You could receive less money from a bond
fund (and could even lose money) if you need it in an emergency. Avoid using
the check-writing option that comes with many bond funds. Every time you
sell shares in a bond fund (which is what you’re doing when you write a
check), this transaction must be reported on your annual income tax return.
When you write a check on a money market fund, by contrast, it isn’t a so-
called taxable event because a money fund has a fixed share price, so you’re
not considered to be adding to or subtracting from your taxable income
when you sell these shares.
188
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

You also shouldn’t put too much of your longer-term investment money in bond
funds. With the exception of those rare periods when interest rates drop sig-
nificantly, bond funds won’t produce the high returns that growth-oriented
investments such as stocks, real estate, and your own business can.
189
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful
Aren’t higher interest rates better if I need income?
In the early 2000s, after a multiyear drop, inter-
est rates were at what seemed to be rock-
bottom levels compared to those of recent
decades. Intermediate-term bonds were yield-
ing around 4 percent — about one-third of what
rates had been in the early 1980s.
Generally speaking, lower interest rates are
great for the economy because they encourage
consumers and businesses to borrow and
spend more money. But if you were a retiree
trying to live off the income being produced by
your bonds, low interest rates seemed like the
worst of all possible economic worlds.
For each $100,000 that a retiree invested in
intermediate-term bonds, CDs, or whatever
when interest rates were 12 percent, the retiree
received $12,000 per year in interest or divi-
dends. A retiree purchasing intermediate-term
bonds in the early to mid 2000s after the fall in
interest rates, however, received two-thirds
less dividend income because rates on the
same bonds and CDs were just 4 percent. So for
every $100,000 invested, only $4,000 in dividend
or interest income was paid.
If you’re trying to live off the income being pro-
duced by your investments, a 67 percent reduc-
tion in that income may cramp your lifestyle. So
higher interest rates are better if you’re living off
your investment income, right? Wrong!
Never forget that the primary driver of interest
rates is the expected future rate of inflation.
Interest rates were much higher in the early
1980s because the U.S. had double-digit infla-
tion. If the cost of living is increasing at the rate
of 12 percent per year, why would you as an
investor lend your money out (which is what
you’re doing when you purchase a bond or CD)
at 4 percent? Of course, you wouldn’t lend
money at that rate — which is exactly why
interest rates were so high in the early 1980s.
By the early 2000s, interest rates were low
because the inflation dragon seemed to have
been slain (and the economy was in a reces-
sion). So the rate of interest that investors could
earn by lending their money dropped accord-
ingly. Although low interest rates reduce the
interest income, the corresponding low rate of
inflation doesn’t devour the purchasing power
of your principal balance as quickly.
So what’s an investor to do if she lives off the
income from her investments but can’t generate
enough income because present interest rates
are too low? A financially simple but psycho-
logically difficult solution is to use up some of
the principal to supplement the interest and div-
idend income. In effect, this situation is what
happens anyway when inflation is higher — the
purchasing power of the principal erodes more
quickly. You also should educate yourself about
the range of higher-yielding (and quality) invest-
ment options available — this book helps you
do just that.

Here are some common financial goals to which bond funds are well suited:
 A major purchase: But make sure that the purchase won’t happen for at
least two years, such as the purchase of a home. Short-term bond funds
should offer a higher yield than money market funds. However, bond
funds are a bit riskier, which is why you should have at least two years
until you need the money to allow time for recovery from a dip in your
bond fund account value.
 Part of a long-term, diversified portfolio: Because stocks and bonds
don’t move in tandem, bonds can be a great way to hedge against
declines in the stock market. In fact, in a down economic environment,
bonds may appreciate in value if inflation is declining. Different types of
bond funds (high-quality bonds and junk bonds, for example) typically
don’t move in tandem with each other either, so they can provide an
additional level of diversification. In Chapter 9, where I talk about asset
allocation, I explain how to incorporate bonds into long-term portfolios
for goals such as retirement.
 Generating current income: If you’re retired or not working, bonds are
better than most other investments for producing a current income
stream.
How to pick a bond fund with 
an outcome you can enjoy
When comparing bond funds of a given type (for example, high-quality, short-
term corporate bond funds), most people want to pick the one that’s going to
make the most money for them. But be careful; some mutual fund companies
exploit your desire for high returns. These fund firms love to lure you into a
bond fund by emphasizing high past performance and current yield, deflect-
ing your attention away from the best predictor of bond fund performance:
operating expenses.
Don’t overemphasize past performance
A major mistake that novice bond fund investors make is to look at recent
performance and assume that those are the returns they’re going to get in the
future. Investing in bond funds based only on recent performance is tempting
right after a period when interest rates have declined, because declines in
interest rates pump up bond fund total returns. Remember that an equal but
opposite force is waiting to counteract pumped-up bond returns — bond
prices fall when interest rates rise, which they eventually will.
190
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Don’t get me wrong: Past performance is an important issue to consider. But
in order for performance numbers to be meaningful and useful, you must
compare the same type of bond funds to each other (such as intermediate-
term funds that invest exclusively in high-grade corporate bonds) and against
the correct bond market index or benchmark (which I discuss in Chapter 15).
Be careful with yield quotes
A fund’s yield measures how much the fund is currently paying in dividends;
it’s quoted as a percentage of the fund’s share price — say, 5.2 percent. This
statistic certainly seems like a valid one for comparing funds. Unfortunately,
some fund companies have abused it.
Don’t confuse a bond fund’s yield with its return. Dividends are just one part
of a fund’s return, which also includes capital gain distributions and changes
in the bond fund’s share price. Over a given period of time, a bond fund could
have a positive yield but a negative overall return, particularly if interest rates
have increased or the credit quality of bonds in its portfolio has deteriorated.
Some unscrupulous fund companies try to obscure the difference between
yield and return. Forbes magazine once reported on an advertisement sent out
by the Fundamental U.S. Government Strategic Income Fund. In huge type on
the cover of this brochure, the fund boasted of its 11.66-percent yield, an
impressive number because 30-year Treasury bonds were yielding less than 
8 percent at the time. One can only assume that the designers of this promo
piece hoped that you wouldn’t check out the back cover, where the small print
stated that the fund’s total return for the previous year was –15.7 percent.
Bond funds and the mutual fund companies that sell them can play more than
a few games of creative accounting to fatten a fund’s yield. Such sleight of hand
makes a fund’s marketing department happy because higher yields make hawk-
ing the bond funds easier for salespeople. But remember that yield-enhancing
shenanigans can leave you poorer. Here’s what to watch out for:
 Lower quality: You may compare one short-term bond fund to another
and discover that one pays 0.5 percent more and, therefore, looks better.
But, if you look a little further, you discover that the higher-yielding fund
invests 20 percent of its assets in junk bonds (a BB or less credit-quality
rating), whereas the other fund is fully invested in high-quality bonds
(AAA and AA rated). In other words, the junk bond fund isn’t necessarily
better; given the risk it’s taking, it should be yielding more.
 Lengthened maturities: Bond funds can usually increase their yield just
by increasing maturity a bit. (Insiders call this ploy going further out on
the yield curve.) So when comparing yields on different bond funds, be
sure that you’re comparing them for funds of similar maturity. Even if
they both call themselves “intermediate-term,” if one bond fund invests
191
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

in bonds maturing on average in seven years, while another fund is at
ten years for its average maturity, comparing the two is a classic case of
comparing apples to oranges. Because longer-term bonds usually have
higher yields (due to increased risk), the ten-year average maturity fund
should yield more than the seven-year average maturity fund.
 Giving your money back without your knowledge: Some funds return a
portion of your principal in the form of dividends. This move artificially
pumps up a fund’s yield but depresses its total return. Investors in this
type of bond fund are rudely awakened when, after enjoying a healthy
yield for a period of time, they examine the share price of their bond
fund shares and find that they’ve declined in value.
When you compare bond funds to each other by using the information
in the prospectuses (see Chapter 7), make sure that you compare their
total return over time (in addition to making sure that the funds have
comparable portfolios of bonds and durations).
 Waiving of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, waive
a portion or even all of their operating expenses to temporarily inflate
the fund’s yield. Yes, you can invest in a fund that’s having a sale on its
operating fees, but you also have the hassle of monitoring the fund to
determine when the sale is over. Bond funds engaging in expense waiv-
ing often end such sales quietly when the bond market is doing well.
Don’t forget that if you sell a bond fund (held outside of a retirement
account) that has appreciated in value, you owe taxes on your profits.
Do focus on costs
Like money market funds, bond fund returns are extremely sensitive to costs.
After you’ve identified a particular type of bond fund to invest in, expenses —
sales commissions and annual operating fees — should be your number-one
criterion for comparing funds.
For bond funds, you should generally shun funds with operating expenses
higher than 0.5 percent.
The marketplace for bonds is fairly efficient. For any two bond managers
investing in a particular bond type — say, long-term municipal bonds — pick-
ing bonds that outperform the other’s over time is difficult. But if one of
those bond funds charges lower fees than the other, that difference provides
the low-fee fund with a big head start in the performance race.
You can earn a higher return from a bond fund by investing in funds that
 Hold longer-term bonds
 Hold lower-credit-quality bonds
 Have lower operating expenses
192
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Please note that the first two ways of earning a higher bond fund yield —
using longer-term and lower-credit-quality bonds — increase the risk that
you’re exposed to. Stick with no-load funds that have low annual operating
expenses as a risk-free way to boost your expected bond fund returns.
How to obtain tax-free income
Just as money market funds can produce taxable or tax-free dividends (see
Chapter 10), so too can bond funds. In order to produce tax-free income, a
bond fund invests in municipal bonds (also called muni bonds or munis)
issued by state or local governments.
As long as you live in the U.S., generally, municipal bond fund dividends are
federally tax-free to you. Funds that specialize in muni bonds issued just in your
state pay dividend income that’s typically free of your state’s taxes as well.
When you’re investing in bonds inside retirement accounts, use taxable
bonds. If you’re investing in bonds outside retirement accounts, the choice
between taxable versus tax-free depends on your tax bracket. If you’re in a
high tax bracket (28 percent or higher for federal) and you want to invest in
bonds outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, you may do better in a
muni fund than in a bond fund that pays taxable dividends (see Chapter 9 to
determine your tax bracket).

Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful
How bond funds calculate their yields
When you ask a mutual fund company for a bond
fund’s yield, make sure you understand the time
period that the yield covers. Fund companies are
supposed to report the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) yield, which is a standard
yield calculation that allows for fairer compar-
isons among bond funds. The SEC yield reflects
the bond fund’s so-called yield to maturity. This
yield is the best to use when you compare funds
because it captures the effective rate of interest
an investor will receive going forward.
Funds also calculate a yield that only looks at
the recently distributed dividends relative to the
share price of the fund. Funds can pump up this
number by purchasing particular types of bonds.
For just that reason, yield based on recently 
distributed dividends isn’t nearly as useful a
yield number to look at (although some brokers
who sell bond funds love to use it because they
can make particular funds look better than they
really are).

Eyeing Recommended Bond Funds
If you’ve read through this chapter, you now know more about bond funds
than you probably ever imagined possible, so now it’s time to get down to
brass tacks: selecting bond funds for a variety of investing needs.
Using the logic laid out earlier in this chapter, I present you with a menu of
choices. Although thousands of bond funds are available — few are left to
consider after you eliminate the high-cost ones (those with loads and ongo-
ing fees), low-performance funds (which are often the just-mentioned high-
cost funds), and funds managed by fund companies and managers with
minimal experience investing in bonds.
I’ve done the winnowing for you, and the funds I present in the sections that
follow are the best of the best for meeting specific needs. I’ve organized the
funds by the average maturity and duration of the bonds that they invest in,
as well as by the taxability of the dividends that they pay.
Use the following funds only if you have sufficient money in your emergency
reserve (see Chapter 3). If you’re investing money for longer-term purposes,
particularly retirement, come up with an overall plan for allocating your
money among a variety of different funds, including stock and bond funds.
For more on allocating your money, be sure to read Chapter 9.
Short-term bond funds
Short-term bond funds, if they live up to their name, invest in short-term
bonds (which mature in a few years or less). Of all bond funds, these are the
least sensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Their stability makes them the
most appropriate bond funds for money on which you want to earn a better
rate of return than a money market fund could produce for you. But with
short-term bond funds, you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a few per-
cent in principal value if overall interest rates rise.
Short-term bonds work well for investing money to afford major purchases
that you expect to make in a few years, such as a home, a car, or a portion of
your retirement account investments that you expect to tap in the near future.
Taxable short-term bond funds
Bond funds that pay taxable dividends are appropriate for nonretirement
accounts if you’re not in a high tax bracket (no more than 28 percent federal)
and for investing inside retirement accounts. (Call the fund companies for
current yields.)
194
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX) invests the bulk of its port-
folio in high- and moderate-quality, short-term corporate bonds. (The average
credit rating is A to AA.) Typically, it keeps a small portion in U.S. Treasuries.
It may even stray a bit overseas and invest several percent of the fund’s assets
in promising foreign bonds. This fund maintains an average maturity of two
to three years, and duration currently is two years.
Robert Auwaerter has managed Vanguard’s Short-Term Corporate fund since
the early 1980s. All told, this fund invests in more than 700 bonds (imagine
having to keep track of all of them on your own!). This fund maintains a
wafer-thin 0.21 percent operating expense ratio. It has a $3,000 minimum.
(Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register their
accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements and
fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
Note: Many Vanguard funds now offer “Admiral” versions with even lower
operating expenses (and thus higher yields) for big balance customers. For
example, Vanguard’s Short-Term Investment-Grade Admiral shares (VFSUX)
have an expense ratio of just 0.10 percent. However, in order to buy into it,
you need $100,000 to invest. You may qualify to convert your regular shares
(also known as “Investor” shares) in Short-Term Investment-Grade into Admiral
shares if you’ve been a longer-term customer but lack $100,000. If you’ve held
the Investor shares at least ten years, you need a balance of $50,000.
U.S. Treasury short-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds are appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that invests
in U.S. Treasuries (which have the safety of government backing) or if you’re
not in a high federal tax bracket (no more than 28 percent), but you are in a
high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I don’t recommend Treasuries
for retirement accounts because they pay less interest than fully taxable
bond funds. (Call the fund companies for current yields.)
Vanguard Short-Term Treasury (VFISX) invests in U.S. Treasuries maturing
within two to three years — you can’t get much safer than that. Duration cur-
rently is two years. This fund is co-managed by Robert Auwaerter and David
Glocke. Although the fund has that lean Vanguard expense ratio of 0.26 per-
cent annually, don’t forget that you can buy Treasuries direct from your local
Federal Reserve Bank if you don’t need liquidity. The minimum initial invest-
ment is $3,000. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or
register their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of state-
ments and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
Municipal tax-free short-term bond funds
Short-term bond funds that are free of both federal and state taxes are scarce.
However, some good short-term funds are free of federal, but not state, taxes.
195
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

These are generally appropriate if you’re in a higher federal bracket (more
than 28 percent) but in a low state bracket (less than 5 percent).
If you live in a state with high taxes, consider a state money market fund,
which I cover in Chapter 10. (Call the fund companies for current yields.)
Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt (VWSTX) invests in the crème de la crème
of the federally tax-free muni bonds issued by state and local governments
around the country. (Its average credit rating is AA.) The fund’s average
maturity ranges from one to two years, and duration is about one year.
Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt (VMLTX) does just what the short-term
fund does (and has the same manager), except that it does it a while longer.
This fund’s average muni bond matures in two to five years (with a duration
of about three years), although its average credit rating is a respectable AA.
Both the short-term and limited-term funds have a miserly annual operating
expense ratio of 0.16 percent and require a $3,000 minimum initial invest-
ment. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register
their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements
and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
Intermediate-term bond funds
Intermediate-term bond funds hold bonds that typically mature within a
decade or so. They’re more volatile than shorter-term bonds but should be
more rewarding. The longer you can own an intermediate-term bond fund,
the more likely you are to earn a higher return on it than on a short-term
fund, unless interest rates keep rising over many years.
You shouldn’t purchase an intermediate-term fund unless you expect to hold
it for a minimum of three to five years — or longer, if you can. Therefore, the
money you put into this type of fund should be money that you don’t expect
to use during that period. (Call the fund companies for current yields.)
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds
If you invest in these funds in a nonretirement account, be sure that you’re
not in a high tax bracket — more than 28 percent federal.
Dodge & Cox Income (DODIX) is run by a conservative management team at
an old San Francisco investment firm that has been managing money for pri-
vate accounts since 1930 and running mutual funds since 1931. This fund,
which focuses on government securities and high-grade corporate debt, has
an average bond credit rating of AA, an average maturity of five to ten years,
196
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

and a duration of about four to five years. This fund is team managed with
the managers having an average tenure of about 14 years. The operating
expense ratio is a reasonable 0.44 percent: $2,500 is the minimum initial
investment ($1,000 for retirement accounts). % 800-621-3979.
Harbor Bond (HABDX) is a more aggressive intermediate-term bond fund.
The fund invests mostly in corporate bonds, as well as in mortgage bonds
with average maturities of up to ten years (duration is about five years),
depending on fund manager William Gross’s outlook for inflation and the
economy.
Gross, who’s managed this fund since 1987, has three plus decades of experi-
ence managing money in the bond market. He makes relatively wide swings in
strategy and, during periods of rising interest rates, has bulked up the fund
with money market securities to protect principal. At times, Gross has also
ventured small portions of the fund into foreign bonds, junk bonds, and even
a sprinkling of derivatives such as futures and options to slightly leverage
returns. (The fund has an average credit rating of A to AA.) Despite its aggres-
siveness, the fund has had low volatility. Although this fund’s expense ratio is
a tad on the high side (0.58 percent), Gross has delivered high enough long-
term returns to justify the slightly higher costs. The minimum initial invest-
ment is just $1,000. % 800-422-1050.
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX) is an index fund that tracks the
index of the entire bond market, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index.
The fund is managed by Robert Auwaerter, Kenneth Volpert, and a computer.
It uses a sampling to mirror the index so it doesn’t actually invest in every
bond in the index. Investment-grade corporate bonds and mortgages make
up the majority of the fund’s investments; the rest are U.S. government and
agency securities. The fund’s average maturity is about seven years, with a
duration of about five years. (Average bond credit rating is AA.) Annual oper-
ating expenses are a paltry 0.2 percent. To encourage longer-term investors
and discourage trading, the fund charges a $10 annual account maintenance
fee for balances under $10,000. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000
in this fund or register their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic
delivery of statements and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual
fee.) You need a $3,000 minimum initial investment to open. % 800-662-7447.
Vanguard GNMA (VFIIX) invests in residential mortgages that people just like
you take out when they purchase a home and borrow money from a bank.
Like other GNMA funds, this one has very low credit risk. (Its average credit
rating is AAA.) Why? Because the principal and interest on GNMAs is guaran-
teed by the federal government (which makes most people — Americans,
anyway — feel warm and fuzzy). All GNMA funds have prepayment risk. (If
interest rates fall, mortgage holders refinance.) But this GNMA fund has less
risk than most because it minimizes the purchase of mortgage bonds that
197
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

were issued at higher interest rates — and are, therefore, more likely to be
refinanced and paid back early.
This fund is managed by Thomas Pappas and Michael Garrett at Wellington
Management, a private money management firm that Vanguard uses for some
of its other funds. GNMA doesn’t invest in some of the more exotic mortgage
securities and derivatives that are abused by other firms’ bond funds. Like all
other bond funds, this one has interest rate risk, though it’s comparable to
other intermediate-term bond funds despite the longer maturity of most of
this fund’s holdings. Duration is generally around four years and the fund’s
yearly operating expense ratio is 0.21 percent: $3,000 is the minimum initial
investment. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or reg-
ister their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements
and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
Vanguard High Yield Corporate (VWEHX) invests in lower-quality (junk) cor-
porate bonds. These pay more and are for more aggressive investors stretch-
ing for greater yield. Intermediate-term junk bonds are volatile: They not only
are interest rate sensitive, but also they’re susceptible to changes in the
economy. For example, this fund lost more than 10 percent of its principal
value in 1989, 1990, and 1994 and more than 25 percent in the five-year period
from 1998 through 2002.
Unlike other high-yield funds, this fund invests little (if any) of its funds in
lower-rated junk bonds; it invests in the best of the junk (its average credit
rating is BB). The average maturity of this fund is seven years, with a duration
of five years. Earl McEvoy at Wellington Management has managed this fund
since 1984. The fund has been around since 1978 — a degree of longevity that
makes it one of the longest- and best-performing junk bond funds. Yearly
operating expenses are 0.25 percent: $3,000 is the minimum initial invest-
ment. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register
their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements
and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
U.S. Treasury intermediate-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds are appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that invests
in U.S. Treasuries (which have the safety of government backing) and if you’re
not in a high federal tax bracket (no more than 28 percent), but you are in a
high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I don’t recommend Treasuries for
retirement accounts because they pay less interest than fully taxable bond
funds. (Call the fund company for current yields.)
Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury (VFITX) invests in U.S. Treasuries
maturing in five to ten years. (See the description for the short-term 
U.S. Treasury funds for minimum initial investment and expense ratio.) 
% 800-662-7447.
198
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities (VIPSX) fund is a new breed of fund,
which I cover in the “Inflation-indexed Treasury bonds” section in this chap-
ter. With a low operating expense ratio of 0.2 percent, this fund is a good one
for inflation-skittish investors to consider. It has a $3,000 minimum initial invest-
ment. (Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register their
accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements and fund
reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
Municipal tax-free intermediate-term bond funds
Consider federally tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal bracket (28
percent and up) but a relatively low state bracket (less than 5 percent). (Call
the fund company for current yields.)
If you’re in the market for a state and federally tax-free bond fund, the prob-
lem is that the ones available (and there aren’t all that many) have high
expenses. High expenses are always a problem but are especially so in a low
interest rate environment (like has been around for years) because little of a
fund’s yield will be left to pay out. So, if you’re in high federal (28 percent and
up) and high state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets, you’re better off using
the nationwide Vanguard municipal bond fund that I describe at the end of
this section.
Fidelity Intermediate Municipal Income (FLTMX) invests in high-credit-qual-
ity (average rating is AA) municipal bonds that generally mature within ten
years. This fund’s average maturity is usually around eight years, with a dura-
tion of about five to six years. The expense ratio has come down in recent
years to a competitive 0.36 percent, and the minimum initial investment is
$10,000. % 800-544-8888.
Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt (VWITX) does what Vanguard’s
short-term muni funds do, except that it invests in slightly longer-term muni
bonds. (Duration is generally about five years, and the average credit rating
is AA.) The annual operating expense ratio is a mere 0.17 percent; $3,000 is
the minimum initial investment. Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000
in this fund or register their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic
delivery of statements and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.
% 800-662-7447.
Long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are the most aggressive and volatile bond funds around.
If interest rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, the principal value
of your investment could decline 10 percent or more.
199
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

Long-term bond funds generally are used for retirement investing in one of
two situations:
 For investors not expecting to tap their investment money — ideally —
for a decade or more
 For investors wanting to maximize current dividend income and who are
willing to tolerate volatility
Don’t use these funds for investing money that you plan to use within the next
five years, because a bond market drop could leave your portfolio with a bit
of a hangover. (Use intermediate-term and short-term bond funds instead.)
And don’t use the taxable funds in a nonretirement account if you’re in a high
tax bracket — especially higher than 28 percent federal. (Call the fund com-
panies for current yields.)
Taxable long-term bond funds
Bond funds that pay taxable dividends are appropriate for nonretirement
accounts if you’re not in a high tax bracket (no more than 28 percent federal)
and for investing inside retirement accounts. (Call the fund companies for
current yields.)
Vanguard Long-Term Investment-Grade (VWESX) is comprised mostly of
high-grade corporate bonds, but it sometimes holds around 10 percent in
Treasuries and foreign and convertible bonds. (Average credit rating is A.)
Long-term bonds such as these (the fund’s average maturity is 20+ years,
with a duration of 10+ years) can produce wide swings in volatility. For exam-
ple, this fund lost more than 12 percent of its principal value in 1999, its
worst year in a generation. The dividends of 6.3 percent paid that year
brought the fund back to produce a total return of –6.2 percent. Wellington
Management’s Earl McEvoy has managed the fund since 1994, but Wellington
itself has managed this fund since its inception in 1973. It has an annual oper-
ating expense ratio of 0.25 percent, with a $3,000 minimum initial investment.
(Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register their
accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements and
fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.) % 800-662-7447.
U.S. Treasury long-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds are appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that
invests in U.S. Treasuries (which have the safety of government backing) and
if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket (no more than 28 percent), but you
are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I don’t recommend
Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less interest than fully
taxable bond funds. (Call the fund companies for current yields.)

Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Vanguard Long-Term Treasury (VUSTX) invests in U.S. Treasuries with aver-
age maturities around 17 years. Duration is about 10 years. (See the descrip-
tion in the section “U.S. Treasury short-term bond funds” for minimum initial
investment and expense ratio.) Investors are advised to keep at least $10,000
in this fund or register their accounts at Vanguard’s Web site for electronic
delivery of statements and fund reports; otherwise, you pay a $20 annual fee.
% 800-662-7447.
Municipal tax-free long-term bond funds
Consider federally tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal bracket (28
percent and up) but a relatively low state bracket (less than 5 percent). (Call
the fund company for current yields.)
Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt (VWLTX) does what Vanguard’s short-term
muni funds do, except that it invests in long-term muni bonds. (The average
credit rating is AAA.) This fund has an operating expense ratio of 0.16 per-
cent. Another twist on Vanguard’s Long-Term muni fund is the Vanguard
Insured Long-Term Tax-Exempt (VILPX) fund, which also buys long-term
munis, but only those that are insured. (The average credit rating is AAA.)
This fund has an annual operating expense ratio of just 0.16 percent. Both of
these funds have a $3,000 minimum initial investment. Investors are advised
to keep at least $10,000 in this fund or register their accounts at Vanguard’s
Web site for electronic delivery of statements and fund reports; otherwise,
you pay a $20 annual fee. % 800-662-7447.
State and federally tax-free bond funds may be appropriate if you’re in high
federal (28 percent and up) and high state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets.
The fund providers Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and Vanguard offer competitive
funds for states such as California, Connecticut, Florida, Maine, Maryland,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. If you
can’t find a good state-specific bond fund for your state, or if you’re only in a
high federal tax bracket, use the nationwide Vanguard Municipal bond funds I
describe in this section. (Call the fund companies for current yields.)
Exploring Alternatives to Bond Funds
Bond mutual funds are just one way to lend your money and get paid a
decent yield. In the following sections, I discuss the advantages and disad-
vantages of other alternatives, some of which have acronyms that you can
impress your friends and family with — or confirm that you’re an invest-
ments geek. Regardless of which investment type(s) you end up purchasing,
do your big-picture thinking first: What do you plan to use the money for
201
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

down the road? How much risk are you willing and able to take? What’s your
tax situation?
Most of these bond fund alternatives have one thing in common: They offer
psychological solace to those who can’t stomach fluctuations in the value of
their investments. After I tell you more about these alternatives (including
information that you’re not likely to hear in a marketing pitch from the com-
pany or person who’s trying to sell you on them), low-cost bond funds may
look more attractive.
Certificates of deposit
For many decades, bank certificates of deposit (CDs) have been the safe
investment of choice for folks with some extra cash that they don’t need in
the near term. The attraction is that you get a higher rate of return on a CD
than on a bank savings account or money market fund. And unlike a bond
fund, a CD’s principal value doesn’t fluctuate. Of course, you also enjoy the
peace of mind afforded by the government’s FDIC insurance program.
All these advantages of CDs aren’t nearly as attractive as they may seem on
the surface. I start with the FDIC insurance issue. Bonds and bond mutual
funds aren’t FDIC-insured. The lack of this insurance, however, shouldn’t
trouble you on high-quality bonds because these bonds rarely default. Even if
a fund held a bond that defaulted, it probably would be a tiny fraction (less
than 1 percent) of the value of the fund, so it would have little overall impact.
You may believe that there’s no chance you’ll lose money on a CD — but
banks have failed and will continue to fail. Although you’re insured for
$100,000 in a bank, if the bank crashes, you’ll likely wait quite a while to get
your money back — and you’ll probably have to settle for less interest than
you expected, too.
Here’s another myth about CDs: The principal value of your CD doesn’t fluc-
tuate. Sure it does; you just don’t see the fluctuations! Just as the market
value of a bond drops when interest rates rise, so too does the “market
value” of a CD — and for the same reasons. At higher interest rates, investors
expect a discounted price on fixed-interest-rate CDs because they always
have the alternative of purchasing a new CD at the higher prevailing rates.
Some CDs are actually bought and sold among investors — on what’s known
as a secondary market — and they trade and behave just like bonds.
So a lot of those advantages CDs seem to have aren’t as impressive as some
may believe. In fact, compared to bonds, CDs have a number of drawbacks:
 Early withdrawal penalties: Money in a CD isn’t accessible unless you
pay a fairly big penalty — typically, six months’ interest. With a no-load
(commission-free) bond fund, if you need some or all of your money
202
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

next month, next week, or even tomorrow, you can access it without
penalty.
 Restricted tax options: Another seldom-noted drawback of CDs is that
they come in only one tax flavor — taxable. Bonds, on the other hand,
come both in tax-free (federal and/or state) and taxable flavors. So if
you’re a higher-tax-bracket investor, bonds offer you tax-friendly options
that CDs can’t.
 Lower yield: For a comparable maturity, CDs yield less than a high-qual-
ity bond. Often, the yield difference is 1 percent or more. If you don’t
shop around — if you lazily purchase CDs from the bank that you use for
your checking account, for example — you may be sacrificing 2 percent
or more in yield.
Don’t forget about the unfriendly forces of inflation and taxes. They may
gobble up all the yield that your CD is paying, thus leaving you no real
growth on your investment. An extra percentage point or two from a
bond can make a big difference in the long term.
You’ll earn more over the years and have better access to your money in
bond funds than in CDs. And bond funds make particular sense if you’re in a
higher tax bracket and would benefit from tax-free income on your invest-
ments. If you’re not in a high tax bracket and you get gloomy whenever your
bond fund’s value dips, then consider CDs.
CDs may make the most sense if you know, for example, that you can invest
your money for one year, after which you’ll need the money for some purchase
you expect to make. Just make sure that you shop around to get the best inter-
est rate. If what attracts you to CDs is the U.S. government backing that comes
with FDIC insurance, consider Treasuries, which are government-backed
bonds. Treasuries often pay more interest than the better CDs available.
Individual bonds
Maybe you’ve had thoughts like these:
 Why buy a bond fund and pay all those ongoing management fees, year
after year, when I can buy high-rated bonds that pay a higher yield than
that fund I’m looking at?
 I can create my own portfolio of bonds and purchase bonds with differ-
ent maturities. That way, I’m not gambling on where interest rates are
headed, and I won’t lose principal as I may in a bond fund.
Or more likely, you’ve listened to a broker — who was trying to sell individual
bonds to you — make these sorts of remarks. Does the purchase of individual
bonds make sense for you? Although the decision depends on several factors,
I can safely say that most types of individual bonds probably are not for you.
203
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

(Treasuries that you can buy directly from a local Federal Reserve Bank with-
out charge are notable exceptions to my comments that follow.) Here are
some solid reasons why a good bond mutual fund beats individual bonds:
 Mutual funds allow for better diversification. You don’t want to put all
your investment money into a small number of bonds of companies in
the same industry or that mature at the same time. Building a diversified
bond portfolio with individual issues is difficult unless you have a hefty
chunk (at least several hundred thousand dollars) that you desire to
invest in bonds.
 You want to save on commissions. If you purchase individual bonds
through a broker, you’re going to pay a commission. In most cases, it’s
hidden; the broker quotes you a bond price that includes the commis-
sion. Even if you go through a discount broker, transaction fees take a
healthy bite out of your investment. The smaller the amount invested,
the bigger the bite. On a $1,000 bond, the fee can equal up to 5 percent.
 Adjusting bond holdings as percentage of your portfolio is easy. Good
investment management includes monitoring and adjusting your overall
bond/stock mix. Adding to or subtracting from your bond holdings by
using individual bonds, however, can be inconvenient and costly.
 Life’s too short. Do you really want to research bonds? You have better
things to do with your time. Bonds and the companies that stand behind
them aren’t that simple to understand. For example, did you know that
some bonds can be “called” before their maturity date? Companies often
do this to save money if interest rates drop significantly. After you pur-
chase a bond, you need to do the same things that a good bond fund
manager would need to do, such as tracking the issuer’s creditworthi-
ness and monitoring other important financial developments.
In terms of costs, you can purchase terrific bond funds with yearly operating
expense ratios of just 0.2 percent (or less). And remember, a bond mutual
fund provides you tons of diversification and professional management so
that you can spend your time doing activities you’re good at and enjoy. You
can increase your diversification by purchasing bond funds with different
maturity objectives (short, intermediate, and long) or an index bond fund
that covers the range.
If you already own individual bonds and they fit your financial objectives and
tax situation, you can hold them until maturity because you’ve already
incurred a commission when they were purchased; selling them now would
just create an additional fee. When the bond(s) mature(s), think about
moving the proceeds into bond funds if you want to continue owning bonds.
Don’t mistakenly think that your current individual bonds are paying the same
yield as when they were originally issued. (That yield is the number listed on
your brokerage account statement in the name of the bond.) As the market
level of interest rates changes, the actual yield of your bonds fluctuates to
204
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

rise and fall with the market level of rates. So if rates have fallen since you
bought your bonds, the value of those bonds has increased — which in turn
reduces the effective yield that you’re currently earning.
Guaranteed-investment contracts
Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs) are sold and backed by an insurance
company. Typically, they quote you a rate of return projected one or a few
years forward. So, like that of a CD, a GIC’s return is always positive and cer-
tain. With a GIC, you experience none of the uncertainty that you normally
face with a bond fund that fluctuates in value with changing interest rates
and other economic upheavals.
The attraction of GICs is that your account value doesn’t fluctuate (at least,
not that you can see). For people who panic the moment a bond fund’s value
slips, GICs soothe the nerves. And they usually provide a higher yield than a
money market or savings account.
As a rule, the insurance company invests GIC money mostly in bonds and
usually a small portion in stocks. The difference between the amount these
investments generate for the insurer and the amount they pay in interest is
profit to the insurer. The yield is usually comparable to that of a bond fund.
Typically, once a year, you’ll receive a new statement showing that your GIC
is worth more — thanks to the newly added interest.
Some employers offer GICs in their retirement savings plans as a butt-covering
option or because an insurance company is involved in the company’s retire-
ment plan. More and more companies are eliminating GICs as investment
options because of the greater awareness about GICs’ drawbacks. First, insur-
ance companies (like banks) have failed and will continue to fail. Although
failed insurers almost always get bailed out — usually through a merger into
a healthy company — you can take a haircut on the promised interest rate if
your GIC is with a failed insurance company. Second, by having a return guar-
anteed in advance, you pay for the peace of mind in the form of lower long-
term returns.
Mortgages
Another way that you can invest your money for greater dividend income is
to lend your money via mortgages and second mortgages. Mortgage brokers
often arrange these “deals.” They appeal to investors who don’t like the
volatility of the stock and bond markets. With a mortgage, you don’t have to
look up the value every day in the newspaper; a mortgage seems safer
because you can’t watch your principal fluctuate in value.
205
Chapter 11: Bond Funds: When Boring Is Beautiful

What’s amazing is that people who invest in these types of mortgages don’t
realize that they’re getting a relatively high interest rate only because they are
accepting relatively high risk. The risk is that the borrower can default, which
would leave you holding the bag. More specifically, you could get stuck with a
property that you may need to foreclose on. And if you don’t hold the first
mortgage, you’re not first in line with a claim on the property.
If a property buyer could obtain a mortgage through a conventional bank, he
would. Banks offer the lowest interest rates. So if a mortgage broker is offer-
ing you a deal to lend your money at 12 percent when the going bank rate is,
say, 8 percent, that means you’ll be lending money to people that the bank
considers high risk. If a bank, with its vast assets on hand, isn’t willing to lend
money to somebody, ask yourself whether you should. Mortgage investments
also carry interest rate risk: If you need to “sell” the mortgage early, you’ll
probably have to discount it, perhaps substantially if interest rates have
increased since you purchased it.
If you’re willing to lend your money to borrowers who carry a relatively high
risk of defaulting, check out high-yield bond funds, which I discuss earlier in
the chapter (under “Taxable intermediate-term bond funds”). With such
funds, you at least diversify your money across many borrowers, and you
benefit from the professional review and due diligence of the fund manage-
ment team. If the normal volatility of a bond fund’s principal value makes you
queasy, then don’t follow your investments so closely!
When you’re selling some real estate and are willing to act as the bank and
provide the financing to the buyer in the form of a first mortgage, consider
that a viable investment. Be careful to check the borrower’s credit, employ-
ment, and income situation; get a large down payment (at least 20 percent);
and try not to lend so much money that it represents more than, say, 10 per-
cent of your total investments.
Exchange-traded bond funds
In 2007, Vanguard launched four different bond ETFs:
 Total bond market ETF
 Short-term bond ETF
 Intermediate-term bond ETF
 Long-term bond ETF
These funds track respective Lehman Brothers bond indexes. The expense
ratio of these new ETFs is 0.11 percent. Check out Chapter 5 for more infor-
mation on ETFs.

ost stock market investors who make money do so not because
they’re smarter, luckier, or more clairvoyant than anyone else. They
make money by simply being more patient and by using three simple invest-
ment methods:
 Invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks.
 Continue to save money and add to investments.
 Don’t try to time the market.
A small number of extraordinary investors — Warren Buffett being a famous
one who’s frequently in the news — generate exceptional returns. Buffett and
these other elite investors do the above three things and have a talent for
identifying and investing in undervalued businesses before most others see
that value. The good news for you is that you can earn handsome long-term
stock market returns without having Buffett’s talent.
People who get soaked in the stock market are those who make easily avoid-
able mistakes. An investment mistake is a bad decision that you could’ve or
should’ve avoided, either because better options were available, or because
the odds were heavily stacked against you making money. Investment mis-
takes result from the following:
 Not understanding risk and how to minimize it
 Ignoring taxes and how investments fit into overall financial plans

 Paying unnecessary and exorbitant commissions and fees for buy-and-
hold investments
 Surrendering to a sales pitch (or salesperson)
 Trading in and out of the market
Give up the search for a secret code — there isn’t one. Focus on avoiding
major gaffes.
The stock market isn’t the place to invest money that you need to tap in the
near future (certainly not money you need to use within the next five years).
If your stock holdings take a dive, you don’t want to be forced to sell when
your investments have lost value. So come along for the ride — but only if
you can stay for a while!
The Stock Market Grows Your Money
Stocks represent a share of ownership in a company and its profits (for more
information, see Chapter 1). As companies (and economies in general) grow
and expand, stocks represent a wonderful way for investors to share in that
growth and success. Over the last two centuries, investors holding diversi-
fied stock portfolios earned a rate of return averaging about 10 percent per
year, which ended up being about 7 percent higher than the rate of inflation.
Earning such returns may not seem like much (especially in a world with
gurus and brokers claiming returns of 20 percent, 50 percent, or more per
year). But don’t forget the power of compounding: At 10 percent per year,
your invested dollars doubles about every seven years. The purchasing
power of your money growing 7 percent more per year than the rate of infla-
tion doubles about every ten years.
Contrast this return with bond and money market investments, which have
historically returned just a percent or two per year over the rate of inflation.
At these rates of return, the purchasing power of your invested money takes
several decades or more to double.
Your investment’s return relative to the rate of inflation determines the
growth in purchasing power of your portfolio. What’s called the real growth
rate on your investments is the rate of return your investments earn per year
minus the yearly rate of inflation. If the cost of living is increasing at 3 per-
cent per year and your money is invested in a bank savings account paying
you 3 percent per year, you’re treading water — your real rate of return is
zero. (On the top of inflation, when you invest money outside of a tax-shel-
tered retirement account, you end up paying taxes on your returns, which
could lead to a negative real “growth” in your money’s purchasing power!)
208

Be patient
The 10 percent annual historic return in stocks (quoted in the preceding sec-
tion) isn’t guaranteed to be the same in the future. Consider some of the
unexpected storms that hammered the stock market over the past 100 or so
years (see Table 12-1).

*The returns that stock market investors earned during these periods differ slightly from the above
figures, which ignore dividends paid by stocks that mitigate some of the above declines. The
returns also ignore changes in the cost of living, which normally increase over time and make
these drops seem even worse. The Great Depression is the exception to that rule: The cost of
living decreased then.
As you see in Table 12-1, the stock market can sometimes take a beating. But
before you let the chart convince you to avoid the stock market, look at the time
periods during which those great plunges occurred — notice how relatively
short most of them are. During the last century, major stock market declines
have lasted less than two years on average. Some of the 20-percent-plus
declines lasted less than one year. The longest declines (1890–1896, 1909–1914,
1929–1932, 1937–1942, 1946–1949, and 2000–2003) lasted from three to six years.
Table 12-1 tells less than half the story. True, the stock market can suffer major
losses. But over the long haul, stocks make more money than they lose. That’s
209
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

how they end up with that 10 percent average annual long-term return I’ve been
telling you about. Stock market crashes may be dramatic, but consider the pow-
erful advances in Table 12-2 that have happened after big market declines.

These stock market increases more than made up for the previous declines.
In other words, wait long enough, and time will bail you out! (Hence, why
stocks are for long-term investors and long-term goals.) If you’re going to
invest in stocks, you must have the time on your side to wait out a major
market decline. If you don’t, you face the risk of selling your stocks for a loss.
Don’t keep your emergency money in stocks. Only invest money that you
don’t plan on using for at least five years — preferably ten or more.
Add regularly to your stock investments
Although the stock market may be able to double the purchasing power of
your money on average every ten years, the real key to creating wealth with
stocks is investing in them regularly. Put $1,000 into stocks, and seven years
later, you’ll probably have $2,000. But if you put $1,000 into stocks every year
for seven years, you end up with nearly $9,500 — that’s nearly five times
more. Remember the power of combining these two simple but powerful
financial concepts: Regular savings and investing in growth-oriented invest-
ments lead to simply amazing long-term results.
210
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Another advantage of buying in regular chunks (some call this dollar-cost aver-
aging, a subject I cover in Chapter 9) is that it softens the blow of a major
decline. Why? Because you can make some of your stock investments as the
market is heading south; perhaps you may even buy at or near the bottom.
After the market rebounds, you show a profit on some of those last purchases
you made, which helps soothe the rest of your portfolio — as well as your bad
feelings about the decline. If you used dollar-cost averaging during the worst
decade for stock investors last century (1928–1938), you still averaged 7 percent
per year in returns despite the Great Depression and a sagging stock market.
Using Mutual Funds to Invest in Stocks
Mutual funds are the way to go when you want to invest in stocks. The best
stock funds offer you diversification and a low-cost way to hire a professional
money manager. In Chapter 4, I discuss at length why purchasing individual
stocks on your own doesn’t make good financial sense. (If you haven’t read
Chapter 4 yet and you believe that buying individual stocks is the best route
for you to take, please read it.)
Reducing risk and increasing returns
When you invest in stocks, you expose yourself to risk. But that doesn’t mean
that you can’t work to minimize unnecessary risk. One of the most effective
risk-reduction techniques is diversification — owning numerous stocks to
minimize the damage of any one stock’s decline. Diversification is one reason
why mutual funds are such a great way to own stocks.
Unless you have a lot of money to invest, you can only cost-effectively afford
to buy a handful of individual stocks. If you end up with a lemon in your port-
folio, it can devastate the returns of your better-performing stocks. Companies
go bankrupt. Even those that survive a rough period can see their stock prices
plummet by huge amounts — 80 percent or more — and sometimes in a
matter of weeks or months.
Even during the 1990s bull market (a bull market is one in which stock prices
are rising; its opposite is a bear market), certain individual stocks took it on
the chin. A good example is Iomega, a darling of Internet message boards in
the mid-1990s. After zooming to more than $135 per share in 1996, it has since
plunged, and years later it languishes below $5 per share (adjusting for splits).
Of course, owning any stock in a company that goes bankrupt and stays 
that way means that you lose 100 percent of your investment. If this stock
211
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

represents, say, 20 percent of your holdings, the rest of your stock selections
must increase about 25 percent in value just to get your portfolio back to even.
Stock mutual funds reduce your risk by investing in many stocks, often 50 or
more. If a fund holds 50 stocks and one drops to zero, you lose only 2 percent of
the value of the fund if the stock was an average holding. If the fund holds 100
stocks, you lose 1 percent, and a 200-stock fund loses only 0.5 percent if one
stock goes. And don’t forget another advantage of stock mutual funds: A good
fund manager is more likely to sidestep investment disasters than you are.
Another way that stock funds reduce risk (and thus their volatility) is by
investing in different types of stocks across various industries. Some funds
also invest in both United States (U.S.) and international stocks.
Different types of stocks don’t always move in tandem. So if smaller-company
stocks are being beaten up, large-company stocks may be faring better. If
growth companies are sluggish, value companies may be in vogue. If U.S.
stocks are in the tank, international ones may not be. (I discuss these differ-
ent types of stock funds later in this chapter.)
You can diversify into various types of stocks by purchasing several stock
funds, each of which focuses on different types of stocks. This diversification
has two potential advantages. First, not all your money is riding in one stock
fund and with one fund manager. Second, each of the different fund managers
can focus on and track particular stock investing opportunities.
Making money: How they do it
When you invest in stock funds, you can make money in three — count ’em —
three ways:
 Dividends: Some stocks pay dividends. Many companies make profits
and pay out some of these profits to shareholders in the form of divi-
dends. Some high-growth companies reinvest most or all of their profits
right back into the business. As a mutual fund investor, you can choose
to receive your fund’s dividends as cash or reinvest them by purchasing
more shares in the mutual fund.
Unless you need the income to live on (if, for example, you’re retired),
reinvest your dividends into buying more shares in the fund. If you do
this outside of a retirement account, keep a record of those reinvest-
ments because those additional purchases should be factored into the
tax calculations you make when you sell the shares. Thanks to tax law
changes in the early 2000s, dividends are taxed at a far lower income tax
rate than ordinary income. (Find the lowdown on fund investments and
taxes in Chapter 16.)
212
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

 Capital gains distributions: When a fund manager sells stocks for more
than she paid for them, the resulting profits, known as capital gains,
must be netted against losses and paid out to the fund’s shareholders.
As with dividends, your capital gains distributions can be reinvested
back into the fund. Gains from stock held for more than one year are
known as long-term capital gains and are taxed at a low rate — no more
than 15 percent (see Chapter 16).
 Appreciation: The fund manager isn’t going to sell all the stocks that
have gone up in value. Thus, the price per share of the fund should
increase (unless the fund manager made poor picks or the market as a
whole is doing poorly) to reflect the gains in unsold stocks. For you,
these profits are on paper until you sell the fund and lock them in. Of
course, if a fund’s stocks decline in value, the share price depreciates.
Hold the fund for more than one year and you qualify for low long-term
capital gains tax rates when you sell.
If you add together dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation,
you arrive at the total return of a fund. Stocks (and the funds that invest in
them) differ in the proportions that make up their total returns, particularly
with respect to dividends.
Seeing your stock fund choices
Stock mutual funds, as their name implies, invest in stocks. These funds are
often referred to as equity funds. Equity (not to be confused with equity in real
estate) is another word for stocks.
Stock funds and the stocks that they invest in usually are classified into par-
ticular categories based on the types of stocks they focus on. Categorizing
stock funds often is tidier in theory than in practice, though, because some
funds invest in an eclectic mix of stocks. Funds and the stocks that they hold
differ from one another in three major ways:
 Size of the company: You can purchase stock in small, medium, and
large companies. The size of a company is defined by the total market
value (capitalization) of its outstanding stock. Small companies are gen-
erally defined as those that have total market capitalization of less than
$2 billion. Medium-sized companies have market values between $2 bil-
lion and $10 billion. Large-capitalization companies have market values
greater than $10 billion. These dollar amounts are somewhat arbitrary.
(Note: The term capitalization is routinely shortened to cap, as in small-
cap company or large-cap stock.)
Why should you care what size companies a fund holds? Because smaller
companies behave differently than larger companies do. Historically,
213
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

smaller companies pay smaller dividends or none at all, but may appre-
ciate more. Their share prices, although more volatile, tend to produce
greater total returns. Larger companies’ stocks tend to pay greater divi-
dends and on average are less volatile, but they produce slightly lower
total returns than small-company stocks. Medium-sized companies, as
you may suspect, fall between the two. Investing in companies of vary-
ing sizes can generally reduce a portfolio’s risk and volatility.
214
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
What do all those other names mean?
If small and large, value and growth, U.S. and
international haven’t created enough mind-
numbing combinations of stock fund options,
here are a few more names that you’ll come
across.
Start with all the variations on growth. Aggres-
sive growth funds are, well, more aggressive
than the other growth funds. Not only does an
aggressive growth fund tend to invest in the
most growth-oriented companies, but also the
fund may engage in riskier investing practices,
such as making major shifts in strategy and
trading in and out of stocks frequently (turning
over the fund’s investments several times or
more during the year).
Then consider growth-and-income funds and
equity-income funds. Both of these fund types
invest in stocks (equities) that pay decent divi-
dends, thus offering the investor the potential
for growth and income. Growth-and-income
and equity-income are basically one and the
same. The only real difference between them is
trivial: Equity-income funds tend to pay slightly
higher dividends (although some growth-and-
income funds have higher dividends than
equity-income funds!). They may pay higher div-
idends because they invest a small portion of
their portfolios in higher-dividend securities,
such as bonds and convertible bonds.
Income funds tend to invest a healthy portion
(but by no means all) of their money in higher-
yielding stocks. Bonds usually make up the other
portion of income funds. As I explain later in this
chapter, other fund names (such as balanced
funds) designate those funds investing in both
stocks and bonds. Income funds are really quite
similar to some balanced funds.
The term international typically means that a
fund can invest anywhere in the world except
the U.S. The term worldwide or global generally
implies that a fund can invest anywhere in the
world, including the U.S. I generally recommend
avoiding worldwide or global funds that have
just one manager for three reasons:
 It’s difficult for a fund manager to thoroughly
follow the companies and financial markets
across a truly global investment landscape.
(It’s hard enough to follow either solely U.S.
or solely international markets.)
 Most of these funds charge high operating
expenses — often well in excess of 1 per-
cent per year — that drag down investors’
returns.
 The proportion of U.S. and foreign stocks
within a global fund may vary a lot, which
can make it difficult for you to have a set
long-term allocation between foreign and
domestic stocks.
Don’t get bogged down in the names of funds.
Remember that funds sometimes have mislead-
ing names and don’t necessarily do what their
names may imply. What matter are the fund’s
investment strategies and typical investments.
I tell you what these strategies are for the funds
I recommend in this book, and I show you how
to combine great funds together into a portfolio
in Chapter 13.

 Growth or value: Stock fund managers and their funds are further cate-
gorized by whether investments are made in growth or value stocks.
• Growth stocks are public companies that are experiencing rapidly
expanding revenues and profits and whose stocks are relatively
costly in relation to the assets and profits of the company. These
firms tend to reinvest most of their earnings in the company to fuel
future expansion; thus, these stocks pay low dividends.
• Value stocks are public companies that are priced cheaply in rela-
tion to the company’s assets and profits. Such a company could
possibly be a growth company, but that’s unlikely because growth
company stocks tend to sell at a premium compared to what the
company’s assets are worth.
 Geography: Stocks and the companies that issue them are further cate-
gorized by the location of their main operations and headquarters. Is a
company based in the U. S. or overseas? Funds that specialize in U.S.
stocks are (surprise, surprise) called U.S. stock funds; those focusing
internationally are typically called “international” or “overseas” funds.
By putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start
to appreciate all those silly and lengthy names that mutual fund companies
give to their stock funds. You can have funds that focus on large-company
value stocks or small-company growth stocks. These categories can be fur-
ther subdivided into more fund types by adding in U.S., international, and
worldwide funds. For example, you can have international stock funds focus-
ing on small-company stocks or growth stocks.
The Best Stock Funds Worth Investing In
Using the selection criteria outlined in Chapter 7, the following sections
describe the best stock funds worthy of your consideration. The recommended
funds differ from one another primarily in terms of the types of stocks they
invest in. Keep in mind as you read through these funds that they also differ
from each other in their tax friendliness (see Chapter 9). If you’re investing
inside a retirement account, you don’t need to bother with this issue.
Because stock funds are used for longer-term purposes, the subject of stock
funds usually raises another important issue: How do you divvy up your loot
into the different types of investments for purposes of diversification and to
make your money grow? Chapter 9 also answers that very question.
Mixing it up: Recommended hybrid funds
Hybrid funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most com-
monly, they invest in both bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less
215
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

risky and less volatile than funds that invest exclusively in stocks; in an eco-
nomic downturn, bonds usually hold up better in value than stocks do.
Hybrid funds make it easier for investors who’re skittish about investing in
stocks to hold stocks while they avoid the high volatility that normally comes
with pure stock funds. You could place 60 percent of your investment moneys
into a pure stock fund and the other 40 percent into a pure bond fund — but
you can do just that by investing in one hybrid fund that has the same overall
60/40 mix. Because bonds and stocks often don’t fluctuate in unison, move-
ments of one can offset those of the other. Hybrid funds are excellent choices
for retirement account investing, particularly when an investor doesn’t have
much money to start with.
Hybrid mutual funds come in two flavors:
 Balanced funds: Balanced funds try to maintain a fairly constant per-
centage of investment in stocks and bonds. For example, a balanced
fund’s objective may be to keep 60 percent of its investments in stocks
and 40 percent in bonds. (Some balanced funds are exceptions to this
rule and will, like asset allocation funds, adjust their mix over time.)
 Asset allocation funds: These funds adjust the mix of different invest-
ments according to the portfolio manager’s economic expectations.
Essentially, the fund manager keeps an eye on the big picture — watch-
ing both the stock and bond markets — and moves money between
them in an attempt to get the best value.
You should note, however, that most managers have done a dismal job in
beating the market averages by shifting money around instead of staying put
in sensible investments. (See Chapter 9 for more on index funds.)
One of the brighter spots on the mutual fund landscape is the best mutual
funds that invest in a variety of different funds offered by their parent compa-
nies. They’re known as “funds of funds,” and they’re the ultimate couch-
potato way to invest! Later in this section, I discuss Vanguard’s LifeStrategy
funds and Fidelity’s Freedom funds.
Because hybrid funds hold taxable bonds and, therefore, pay decent dividends,
they aren’t appropriate for many investors who’re purchasing funds outside tax-
sheltered retirement accounts. If you’re in a higher tax bracket (federal 28 per-
cent and higher), bonds that you hold outside a retirement account should
probably be tax-free. With the exception of the Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced
Fund (see the sidebar, “A tax-friendly hybrid”), you should avoid the hybrid
funds if you’re in this situation. Buy separate tax-friendly stock funds (which I
cover later this chapter) and tax-free bond funds (see Chapter 11).
216
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

The following sections describe some terrific hybrid funds. They’re loosely
ordered from those that generally take less risk to those that take more.
Higher-risk hybrid funds tend to hold greater positions in stocks and/or make
wider swings and changes in their investments and strategies over time.
Vanguard Wellesley Income
The Vanguard Wellesley Income is among the most conservative and
income oriented of the hybrids. This fund typically has about 60 percent of
its assets in high-quality bonds, with the remaining assets in high-yielding,
large-company stocks. Since its inception in 1970, the majority of this fund’s
returns have come from dividends. Like many of the other conservative
Vanguard funds, this one is managed by Wellington Management and the
dynamic duo of Earl McEvoy and John Ryan, who have more than six decades
of investment experience between them.
This fund is ideal for people who’ve either retired or are on the verge of 
retiring — or anyone else who wants a high rate of current income but also
wants/has some potential for growth from their investments. Its stocks are
value oriented and among the more stable of stocks. Its high-quality bonds,
which tend to be intermediate term, also don’t go through the gyrations that
217
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs
A tax-friendly hybrid
Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced is the one
hybrid fund that’s tax friendly enough to be con-
sidered for investments held outside tax-shel-
tered retirement accounts. Why? Because the
bonds that it holds (typically half of this fund’s
investments) are federally tax-free municipal
bonds. Be forewarned, though, that this fund
has a steep initial minimum of $10,000 and is
intended for investors who can hold the fund for
at least five years. Otherwise, a 1 percent trans-
action fee is charged against your sale pro-
ceeds and paid into the fund. The fund’s annual
expense ratio is a mere 0.12 percent.
The bond portion of the portfolio is managed 
by Vanguard’s bond fund mavens: Robert
Auwaerter and Christopher Ryon. The bonds
are high quality and generally intermediate
term. The stocks in this fund try to replicate the
Russell 1000 index of the 1,000 largest company
stocks in the U.S., although the fund emphasizes
stocks with lower dividends to reduce taxable
distributions. Selling of stocks with capital gains
is also minimized to reduce those taxable distri-
butions as well.
If you live in a high-tax state, instead of buying
this Vanguard fund, you may be better off buying
a state and federally tax-free municipal bond
fund, if a good one’s available for your state (see
Chapter 11 to find out), and pairing it with a tax-
friendly stock fund. Contact Vanguard investor

Vanguard’s funds of funds
A fund of funds is simply a mutual fund that invests in other individual mutual
funds. Although the concept isn’t new, it’s become increasingly attractive to
investors who either are overwhelmed by the number of fund choices out
there or who want to diversify. Vanguard offers some excellent funds of funds.
Begun in 1985 — and thus the oldest of the funds of funds — the Vanguard
Star fund is diversified across 11 different Vanguard funds: 6 U.S. stocks, 2 for-
eign stocks, and 3 bonds. Its targeted asset allocation is about 65 percent in
stocks and 35 percent in bonds. The Star fund’s diversification comes cheap:
The expense ratio of the underlying funds is 0.35 percent. (There’s no addi-
tional charge for packaging them together.) The initial investment require-
ment is just $1,000.
Realizing that in the case of asset allocation, one size doesn’t fit all, Vanguard
introduced the LifeStrategy series of funds in 1994. Although each of the four
LifeStrategy funds draws from numerous Vanguard stock and bond funds, they
differentiate themselves by their target asset allocations. The LifeStrategy
Income fund, the most conservative of the bunch, has 70 to 80 percent in bonds
and 20 to 30 percent in stocks, whereas the LifeStrategy Growth portfolio, at
the other end of the risk spectrum, invests 80 to 90 percent in stocks and 10 to
20 percent in bonds. The asset allocations of the LifeStrategy Conservative
Growth and the LifeStrategy Moderate Growth funds fall somewhere in
between. (If you want a fund that gradually scales back its risk as you get
closer to retirement, take a look at Vanguard’s Target Retirement fund series.
By relying more heavily on index funds than the Star fund does, the LifeStrategy
funds come through with an even lower average expense ratio of 0.26 percent.
Minimum initial investment is $3,000, and these funds charge a $20 annual
low-balance fee for account balances below $10,000 unless you register your
account on Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements and
fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
The Dodge & Cox Balanced fund is one of the oldest and best-balanced
funds, having started in 1931. I recommended it in prior editions of this book
and unfortunately, the fund is now closed to new investors (those in the fund
may add to their positions if they want). Although never at the top of the
fund heap, this fund has had just one down year since 1981 (and that was a
mere 3 percent loss in 2002). Like Dodge & Cox itself, this fund is conserva-
tively run, investing primarily in medium- and large-company U.S. value
218
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

stocks and high-quality, intermediate-term bonds. Typically, it invests about
60 percent in stocks and the rest in bonds.
This fund has always been managed by using a team approach, so if you like
to be able to rattle off the name of a star fund manager who’s investing your
money, this fund isn’t for you (although you can impress others by saying
that the minimum account size that Dodge & Cox normally accepts is several
million dollars). This fund has a low 0.53 percent expense ratio.
Vanguard Wellington
The Vanguard Wellington is the oldest hybrid fund: It dates back to the
summer of 1929 (which means that it even survived the Great Depression!).
This fund typically invests about 60 to 65 percent in larger-company value-
oriented stocks, with the remainder in high-quality, intermediate- to longer-
term bonds. In recent years, approximately 10 to 15 percent of this fund’s
stocks were overseas.
This fund is co-managed by Wellington Management’s Edward Bousa and John
Keogh, who together have more than 50 years of investment management
experience. The fund’s expense ratio is 0.30 percent. Minimum initial invest-
ment is $10,000. The fund charges a $20 annual low-balance fee for account
balances below $10,000 unless you register your account on Vanguard’s Web
site for electronic delivery of statements and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
Fidelity Puritan
One of the company’s oldest funds (it began in 1947), the Fidelity Puritan
fund is managed by Stephen Petersen, who’s been with Fidelity since 1980
and managed this fund since 2000. Puritan typically has about 60 percent in
stocks that tend to be large company and value oriented. In recent years, the
fund has been investing about 10 percent of its stock allocation overseas.
Most of the bonds are intermediate term and a modest portion of them are
junk bonds. The expense ratio is 0.62 percent. Minimum initial investment is
$2,500. The fund charges a $12 annual low-balance fee for nonretirement
account balances below $2,000. % 800-544-8888.
Fidelity’s Freedom funds of funds
Fidelity offers 12 Freedom funds of funds: Freedom Income, Freedom 2000, Free-
dom 2005, Freedom 2010, Freedom 2015, Freedom 2020, Freedom 2025, Freedom
2030, Freedom 2035, Freedom 2040, Freedom 2045, and Freedom 2050. The
Freedom Income fund is the most conservative, targeting 40 percent of its
assets to fixed income funds, 40 percent to money market funds, and 20 per-
cent to equity funds. At the other end of the scale is the Freedom 2050 fund,
the most aggressive, with about 90 percent of its assets in equity funds and
219
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

10 percent in fixed-income funds. The asset allocations of the other funds fall
between these extremes. (The higher the number in the fund title, which is
theoretically the customer’s approximate retirement date, the greater its per-
centage of stock funds.)
All the Freedom Funds draw from a fixed pool of Fidelity funds, such as
Capital & Income, Government Income, Intermediate Bond, Blue Chip Growth,
Disciplined Equity, Equity-Income, Growth Company, Mid-Cap Stock Fund,
OTC Portfolio, Diversified International, and Fidelity Overseas.
In the past, on top of the operating expenses of the underlying funds, Fidelity
tacked on a 0.1 percent management fee for bundling the funds together. This
additional fee has been eliminated. The Fidelity Freedom funds charge a $12
annual low-balance fee for nonretirement account balances below $2,000. 
% 800-544-8888.
T. Rowe Price offerings
T. Rowe Price Balanced invests mainly in large-company stocks within the
U.S. and has about 15 to 20 percent of its stocks overseas and 10 percent of
its bonds in junk. The expense ratio is 0.69 percent. T. Rowe Price Personal
Strategy Balanced is another fine hybrid fund, which typically holds 60 per-
cent stocks of companies of varying sizes and has 20 to 25 percent of its stocks
overseas. The expense ratio is 0.86 percent. Minimum initial investment for
both of these funds is $2,500 ($1,000 for retirement accounts). T. Rowe Price
also has a newer series of target-date retirement funds (for example, T. Rowe
Price Retirement 2040) that are funds of funds with modest expense ratios of
0.76 percent. These funds gradually reduce their stock exposure and risk as
you near the retirement date in the fund’s name. % 800-638-5660.
TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation
This TIAA-CREF fund is another promising fund of funds. This fund invests 
in five TIAA-CREF stock and bond funds. Its allocation is about 60 percent in
primarily large- and medium-company stocks (about 25 percent of which are
international), with the remaining 40 percent in high-grade intermediate-term
bonds. This fund has a low expense ratio of 0.49 percent. The minimum initial
investment amount is $2,500 ($2,000 for IRAs). % 800-223-1200.
Letting computers do the dirty work:
Recommended index funds
Index funds are passively managed — that means an index fund’s money is
invested, using computer modeling, to simply track the performance of a par-
ticular market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500. When you buy into
220
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

an index fund, you give up the possibility of outperforming the market, but
you also guarantee that you won’t much underperform the market either.
Beating the market is extremely difficult; most actively managed funds are
unable to do it. The best index funds, however, have an advantage — the
lowest operating expenses in the business. In Chapter 9, I further discuss the
virtues of index funds and the role they should play in your portfolio.
I believe that Vanguard’s index funds are generally the best stock index funds
available. John C. Bogle, Vanguard’s founder and former CEO, was the first
person to take the idea of indexing to the mutual fund investing public; he’s
been a tireless crusader for index funds ever since. Today, Vanguard contin-
ues to be the index fund leader with the lowest operating expenses (which
directly translates into higher index fund returns) and the biggest index fund
selection around.
The flagship of Vanguard’s index fleet, the Vanguard Index 500 fund invests to
replicate the performance of the popular stock market index — the Standard
& Poor’s 500 index — which tracks the stocks of 500 large companies in the
U.S. These 500 stocks typically account for about three-quarters of the total
value of stocks outstanding in the U.S. market. I don’t enthusiastically recom-
mend this fund because you miss out on medium- and smaller-sized compa-
nies. The expense ratio on this fund is a razor-thin 0.18 percent, and if you
invest $100,000 in the fund, you can use the Admiral share class with its ultra-
low 0.09 percent expense ratio.
A more diversified and tax-friendlier fund than Vanguard’s Index 500 is the
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, which replicates the performance of the
Wilshire 5000 Index. This index comprises the entire U.S. market of large-,
medium-, and small-company stocks. This fund also has a wafer-thin expense
ratio of 0.19 percent and also offers Admiral shares with a 0.09 percent
expense ratio.
Vanguard Total International Stock Index seeks to replicate a combination
of two international indexes: the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index
(which is comprised of established economies) and the Select Emerging
Markets Index. This fund is actually a fund of funds, as it includes Vanguard’s
index funds for Europe, the Pacific, and Emerging Markets. At 0.32 percent,
this fund’s expense ratio is a bargain for an international fund.
The manager behind the computers who directs the investments in all of
Vanguard’s index funds is Gus Sauter, Vanguard’s indexing guru, who’s been
with the company since 1987. For nonretirement accounts, the minimum ini-
tial purchase for Vanguard index funds is $3,000. Vanguard’s index funds
charge a $20 annual low-balance fee for account balances below $10,000
unless you register your account on Vanguard’s Web site for electronic deliv-
ery of statements and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.

Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are index funds that are the newer kids on the
block. ETFs trade on a stock exchange and the best of them have low expense
ratios like Vanguard’s index funds. In fact, many of the best ETFs come from
Vanguard. For more information about ETFs, their pros and cons and which
ones are best and which should be avoided, please see Chapter 5.
Keeping it local: Recommended 
U.S.-focused stock funds
This section focuses on the better actively managed funds that invest primar-
ily in the U.S. stock market. I say primarily because some “U.S.” funds venture
into overseas investments. The only way to know for sure where a fund is
currently invested (or where the fund may invest in the future) is to ask. You
can start by calling the toll-free number of the mutual fund company that
you’re interested in. You can also read the fund’s annual report (which I
explain how to do in Chapter 7). A prospectus, unfortunately, won’t give you
anything beyond the general parameters that guide the range of investments:
It won’t tell you what the fund is currently investing in or has invested in.
Of all the different types of funds offered, U.S. stock funds are the largest cat-
egory. To see the forest amidst the trees, remember the classifications I cover
earlier in the chapter. Stock funds differ mainly in terms of the size of the
companies they focus on and whether those companies are considered
“growth” or “value” companies.
In previous editions, I highly recommend another of the fine but few funds
offered by Dodge & Cox, the Dodge & Cox Stock fund which focuses on large-
and medium-company value stocks, including about 10 to 20 percent in for-
eign shares. Unfortunately, this fund is now closed to new investors but those
with positions in the fund already may add to their holdings.
Unlike most U.S. stock funds today, this fund does little trading, often less
than 15 percent of its portfolio annually. Like the Dodge & Cox Balanced
Fund, this fund is managed by a team and doesn’t try to time the markets. Its
annual expense ratio is a low 0.52 percent.
Fairholme Fund
You may think that a fund that was started in late 1999, right before the peak
of a long bull market and just before stocks in general suffered their worst
losses in more than a generation, was destined for trouble. But, you’d be
wrong in the case of the Fairholme Fund. Fund managers Bruce Berkowitz,
Larry Pitkowsky, and Keith Trauner scour the world stock markets for under-
valued stocks, primarily in medium- and larger-size companies. About 25 per-
cent of its recent portfolio was recently invested internationally. This firm
222
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

started out in the private money management business — Fairholme Capital
Management — in 1997, which required a one million dollar initial invest-
ment. The Fairholme fund’s expense ratio is 1 percent. Initial minimum invest-
ment is $2,500; $1,000 for retirement accounts. % 866-202-2263.
Fidelity Value Fund
Managed by Richard Fentin since 1996, the Fidelity Value Fund invests pre-
dominantly in mid-size value stocks. The fund also invests a small portion
overseas. Annual operating expenses are 0.66 percent. The minimum initial
investment requirement is $1,000 for retirement accounts and $2,500 for
other accounts. % 800-544-8888.
Fidelity Disciplined Equity
Fidelity Disciplined Equity is one of the few Fidelity U.S. stock funds that
actually stays focused on U.S. stocks. It invests in a mixture of mostly large-
and medium-company stocks. These stocks are selected largely by a com-
puter model that identifies stocks seeming underpriced in relationship to a
company’s overall financial picture.
Former fund manager Brad Lewis developed this model, which has since
been refined. Kevin Quinton took over the reins of this fund in 2006. The
fund’s operating expenses are 0.9 percent. The minimum initial investment
requirement is $2,500 for all accounts. % 800-544-8888.
223
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs
Taxes on stock funds
For mutual funds held outside of retirement
accounts, you have to pay income tax on divi-
dends and capital gains that are distributed.
Thanks to recent tax law changes, stock divi-
dends and long-term capital gains are now taxed
at far lower income tax rates relative to ordinary
income (see Chapter 9). If your circumstances
lead you to have money that you want to invest in
stock funds outside of retirement accounts, by all
means do it. But pay close attention to the tax-
able distributions that funds make (especially
short-term capital gains distributions that aren’t
eligible for the lower tax rates). (I’ve indicated in
this chapter which funds are tax friendly.)
In addition to the tax-friendly index and stock
funds I note in the chapter, also check out the
Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation
fund, which invests in the universe of the 1,000
largest company stocks in the U.S. stock
market. (Vanguard actually selects and samples
from among the 1,000 companies.) This fund
seeks to minimize capital gains distributions by
holding on to appreciating stock and, if it needs
to sell some stocks at a profit, offsetting those
sales by selling other stocks at a loss. Vanguard
also offers a Tax-Managed Growth and Income
fund, Tax-Managed Small-Cap fund, and a Tax-
Managed International fund.
You shouldn’t go into the Vanguard Tax-
Managed funds unless you plan to hold your
investment for five years. Why? Because you’ll
get clipped with a transaction fee of 1 percent
for such an early exit. The minimum initial
investment is a hefty $10,000.

Fidelity Low-Priced Stock
The Fidelity Low-Priced Stock fund specializes in investing in small- and
medium-company value stocks. (I recommend this fund in previous editions
of this book, and, unfortunately, it’s now closed to new investors.) As you may
guess from its name, it buys stocks that have low share prices. Lower-priced
stocks tend to coincide with smaller companies, but not always: The price per
share of a stock may bear little resemblance to the size of the issuing company
because companies can “split” their stock and issue more shares, which cuts
the price per share. This fund has been managed since its inception in 1989 by
Joel Tillinghast, an amazing run given the turnover of managers at many funds,
especially at Fidelity. Annual operating expenses are 1 percent. The minimum
initial investment requirement is $2,500 for all accounts. % 800-544-8888.
Masters’ Select Equity
Devised by the firm of Litman/Gregory, publishers of the No-Load Fund Analyst
newsletter (see Chapter 18), the Masters’ Select Equity fund farms out invest-
ment management to six of the best fund management teams around (some
of whom manage top funds that are closed to new investors). Thus, this fund
is similar to a fund of funds discussed earlier in the chapter. Among the all-
star lineup of those who manage portions of this fund are the following:
 Christopher Davis and Kenneth Feinberg have more than 25 years of
investment experience and have managed the New York Venture fund
(large-company growth stocks) since 1995.
 Bill D’Alonzo has three decades of investment experience and has man-
aged the Brandywine fund (medium- and small-company growth stocks)
since 1986.
 Mason Hawkins is a 30-year investment management veteran and has
directed the Longleaf Partners fund (large-company value stocks world-
wide) since 1987.
 Bill Miller has two decades plus of money-managing expertise and has
overseen Legg Mason Value Trust (medium- and large-company value
stocks) since 1982.
 Craig Blum and Stephen Burlingame have a combined 20 years in the
money management business and manage the TCW Galileo Select
Equity fund (medium- and large-company growth stocks).
 Dick Weiss has spent 25 years managing money and has directed Strong
Common Stock, now a Wells Fargo fund, (small- and medium-company
stocks) since 1991.
As you can see, the fund holds an eclectic mix of small-, medium-, and large-
company stocks and invests a small portion overseas. To discourage short-
term traders, the fund levies a 2 percent redemption fee for shares sold
224
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

within six months of purchase. The expense ratio is a tad high — 1.19 per-
cent. Minimum initial investment is $5,000 ($1,000 for retirement accounts).
% 800-960-0188.
In recent years, the small Masters’ Select family has expanded their menu of
U.S. focused stock funds to include Masters’ Select Value, introduced in 2000,
and Masters’ Select Smaller Companies, which debuted in 2003. Like Masters’
Select Equity, both of these newer funds employ several top money managers —
Value currently utilizes four, and Smaller Companies, five. Each of these funds
has produced relatively strong returns, and I have no hesitation in recommend-
ing either of them for investors seeking value or small-company-focused
stock funds.
Vanguard Primecap
Vanguard Primecap is one of the few growth-oriented stock funds that doesn’t
trade its portfolios heavily, trading typically less than 20 percent of its fund per
year. It invests in companies of all sizes and even invests a small portion over-
seas. This fund has been managed since its inception by Howard Schow and
Theo Kolokotrones of Primecap Management, a Southern California investment
management company. Joel Fried was added as a co-manager in 1993; several
additional co-managers were added in recent years. The expense ratio for this
reasonably tax-friendly fund is a competitive 0.46 percent. (Note: This fund is
currently closed to new investors.) Although this fund is closed, you can, how-
ever, still tap into the investment expertise of Primecap Management through
the Vanguard Primecap Core fund ($10,000 minimum, 0.60 percent expense
ratio) and the Primecap Odyssey Growth fund ($2,000 minimum, 0.89 percent
expense ratio). % 800-662-7447 for Vanguard; % 800-729-2307 for Odyssey.
Vanguard Selected Value
James Barrow and Mike Giambrone, who have nearly six decades of investment
management experience between them, are principals in the money manage-
ment firm of Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney, & Strauss, which have managed most
of this fund since 1999. A portion of this fund has also managed by Donald Smith
& Company since 2005. Vanguard Selected Value focuses on mid-size value
stocks and invests a small portion overseas. The fund’s expense ratio is a low
0.44 percent. Unfortunately, Vanguard raised the minimum investment amount
on this excellent fund to $25,000 so those with smaller balances to invest will
need to look elsewhere. % 800-662-7447.
Vanguard Strategic Equity
Using models honed by Gus Sauter and Joel Dickson of Vanguard’s Quantitative
Equity Group, since 1995 this fund has invested in small- and medium-sized
U.S. companies. Although closed for a time, Vanguard Strategic Equity has
reopened (albeit with a higher minimum of $10,000) and is likely to close
225
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

again to new investors so if you like what you see, establish a position before
is shuts for good. Expenses are a low 0.35 percent. % 800-662-7447.
Weitz Value
As its name suggests, Weitz Value invests in value stocks of companies of
varying sizes. Its fund manager, Wallace Weitz, is a three-decade veteran of
investment management. This fund requires a minimum investment of $5,000
The minimum may be different through discount brokers. The fund has an
expense ratio of 1.12 percent. % 800-232-4161.
Loading up the boat: Recommended 
international funds
As I discuss in Part I, for diversification and growth potential, funds that
invest overseas should be part of an investor’s stock fund holdings. Normally,
you can tell you’re looking at a fund that focuses its investments overseas if
its name contains words such as international, global, worldwide, or world.
Generally, you should avoid foreign funds that invest in just one country. As
with investing in a sector fund that specializes in a particular industry, this
lack of diversification defeats the whole purpose of investing in funds. Funds
that focus on specific regions, such as Southeast Asia, are better but are still
problematic because of poor diversification and higher expenses than other,
more-diversified international funds.
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, take
a look at T. Rowe Price’s and Vanguard’s offerings, which include funds that
focus on broader regions, such as Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-
growth emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent in stock fund investing, interna-
tional securities and funds are also influenced by changes in the value of for-
eign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. If the dollar declines in value, the
value of foreign stock funds goes up. Some foreign stock funds hedge against
currency changes. Although hedging helps to reduce volatility a bit, it costs
money to do, so I wouldn’t worry about it if I were you. Remember, you’re
investing in stock funds for the long haul. And in the long haul, your interna-
tional stock funds’ performance will largely be driven by the returns gener-
ated on foreign stock exchanges, not currency price changes.
The following sections offer my picks for diversified international funds that
may meet your needs. Compared to U.S. funds, fewer established international
funds exist, and they tend to have higher annual expense ratios. So I’ve listed
fewer options for you. (Don’t forget the Vanguard Total International Stock
226
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Index fund and the Vanguard Tax-Managed International fund, which I dis-
cuss earlier in this chapter.)
Vanguard International Growth
The Vanguard International Growth fund invests primarily in large compa-
nies with growth potential, mainly in established countries. It also invests a
modest 10 to 15 percent in emerging markets.
International Growth is primarily managed by London-headquartered
Schroder Capital Management, which has research offices around the world
focused on specific countries and has managed this fund since its inception
in 1981. In 2003, James Anderson of Baillie Gifford was added to manage a
portion of this large fund. This fund has a Vanguard-thin expense ratio of 0.55
percent and has been reasonably tax friendly. Initial minimum investment is
$3,000. The fund charges a $20 annual low-balance fee for account balances
below $10,000 unless you register your account on Vanguard’s Web site for
electronic delivery of statements and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
Artisan International
Artisan International invests in growth stocks in companies of varying sizes
in established and emerging overseas economies. Mark Yockey, who has
more than 20 years experience successfully managing money internationally,
has managed this fund since its inception in 1996. Operating expense ratio is
1.2 percent. Initial minimum investment is $1,000 for all types of accounts. 
% 800-344-1770.
Dodge & Cox International
This excellent private money management firm also offers a handful of excel-
lent mutual funds and manages the Dodge & Cox International fund, a for-
eign stock offering, which focuses on larger company, value-oriented stocks.
The fund is managed by seven investment managers, most of whom have
been with the firm for 20+ years. Expenses are a low 0.70 percent. Minimum
initial investment is $1,000 for retirement accounts; $2,500 for other
accounts. % 800-621-3979.
Masters’ Select International Equity
Like its sibling, Masters’ Select Equity (discussed earlier in this chapter),
Masters’ Select International Equity has some of the best fund managers 
(in this case, five), each managing a portion of fund. Some of these top fund
managers manage funds that are closed to new investors. Although each
manager, who’s selected by the research team at the No-Load Fund Analyst
newsletter (discussed in Chapter 18), has a somewhat different investment
orientation, collectively this fund invests in foreign companies of all sizes. It
also invests modest portions in emerging markets. Here’s some relevant
227
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

background on the five managers currently directing the investment of por-
tions of Masters’ Select International:
 David Herro has been in the investment field since 1986 and manages
Oakmark International and Oakmark International Small-Cap funds.
He focuses on value stocks of companies of all sizes.
 James Gendelman focuses on growth stocks and has managed the
Marsico International Opportunities fund since 2000.
 Theodore Tyson (no relation!) has been an investment professional
since 1981, and oversees the Harbor International fund. He invests
mostly in medium- and large-company growth stocks.
 Bill Fries, a three-decade investment pro, manages the Thornburg
International Value fund. He invests in stocks of all size companies
including growth and value.
 Amit Wadhwaney is value stock picker and has managed the Third
Avenue International Value fund since 2001.
Masters’ Select International’s expenses are 1.08 percent. (Unfortunately 
this fund is closed to new investors.) If you sell shares in this fund within six
months of purchase, you must pay a 2 percent redemption fee. Minimum ini-
tial investment is $5,000 ($1,000 for retirement accounts). % 800-960-0188.
During the period when Masters Select International remains closed to new
investors, I recommend that new investors consider some of the funds run by
the leading managers that Masters Select uses, such as Oakmark International,
which has been managed by David Herro since 1992. This fund has a mini-
mum initial investment of just $1,000 and an expense ratio of 1.10 percent.
TIAA-CREF International Equity
TIAA-CREF International Equity, a newer offering from this solid fund family,
is off to a fine start since its inception in 1997. Fund manager Christopher
Semenuk predominantly holds medium- and large-company stocks in estab-
lished countries and economies. Expenses are just 0.50 percent, and the mini-
mum initial investment is $2,500 ($2,000 for retirement accounts). % 800-
223-1200.
Expanding your horizon: Recommended
global stock funds
A select number of stock funds invest globally (overseas as well as in the
U.S.) and do so well and cost-effectively; I detail those funds in this section.
228
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Oakmark Global
The Oakmark Global fund invests in an eclectic mix of companies world-
wide. Oakmark is one of a very short list of fund firms that has successfully
managed a global stock mutual fund. While the fund commenced operations
in 1999, fund manager Clyde McGregor has been with the Oakmark Funds
parent company (Harris Associates) since 1981 and co-manager Robert
Taylor has been with Harris since 1994. Together, McGregor and Taylor have
more than four decades of experience in money management. While
expenses are a little high at 1.18 percent, they’ve been coming down as the
fund’s assets have grown. Minimum initial investment for all account types is
$1,000. % 800-625-6275.
T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth
T. Rowe Price offers a number of good stock funds, both U.S. and interna-
tional, and the Spectrum Growth fund of funds offers a simplified way to
invest in them. The U.S. stock funds in this fund cover the entire range of
company sizes. Spectrum Growth also invests about 25 percent of its assets
overseas.
This fund of funds is managed by regular meetings of a committee made up of
fund managers within the company. Slight changes in allocations among the
different funds are made based on expectations of how particular types of
stocks (for example, growth versus value, larger versus smaller company)
will fare in the future. The expense ratio of the funds in this fund come to
about 0.83 percent, and the company doesn’t charge an additional fee for the
fund’s packaging. Minimum initial investment is $2,500 ($1,000 for retirement
accounts). % 800-638-5660.
Tweedy Browne Global Value
Tweedy Browne Global Value invests in value stocks of companies of all
sizes worldwide, primarily in established countries. Although it can invest in
the U.S., its U.S. holdings are generally 10 to 15 percent of the fund. The
parent company has an excellent reputation, managing money privately since
the 1920s; this fund itself has been in existence since 1993 and has done well.
Operating expenses, consistently lowering as the fund grows in size, are still
a bit on the high side at 1.38 percent. Although recommended in prior edi-
tions of this book, this fund is closed to new investors. Initial minimum
investment is $2,500 ($500 for retirement accounts). % 800-432-4789.
Vanguard Global Equity
This excellent fund is co-managed by three leading private money manage-
ment firms: Marathon Asset Management, Acadian Asset Management, and
AllianceBernstein. U.S. stocks currently comprise about 40 percent of the
229
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

fund. The expense ratio of 0.72 is low for a global fund but a little higher than
some other Vanguard foreign and domestic funds. That’s because this fund’s
asset base is still modest, so expect the expense take to come down as the
fund grows in size. Minimum initial investment is $3,000. The fund charges a
$20 annual low-balance fee for account balances below $10,000 unless you
register your account on Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of state-
ments and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
One of a kind: Recommended 
specialty funds
Specialty funds don’t fit neatly into the other categories that I discuss in this
chapter. These funds are often known as sector funds because they tend to
invest in securities in specific industries.
In most cases, you should avoid specialty or sector funds. Investing in stocks
of a single industry defeats a major purpose of investing in mutual funds —
you give up the benefits of diversification. Also, just because the fund may
from time to time be dedicated to a hot sector (a sector fund or two is often
at the top of short-term performance charts), you can’t assume that the fund
will pick the right stocks within that sector.
Another good reason to avoid sector funds is that they tend to carry much
higher fees than other mutual funds do. Many sector funds also tend to have
high rates of trading or turnover of their investment holdings. Investors hold-
ing these funds outside of retirement accounts may have to turn over a tidy
portion of their returns to the IRS.
The only types of specialty funds that may make sense for a small portion (10
percent or less) of your investment portfolio are funds that invest in real
estate or precious metals. These types of funds can help diversify your port-
folio because they can do better during times of higher inflation — which
often depresses general bond and stock prices. Don’t feel obligated to invest
in these sector funds, however, because diversified stock funds tend to hold
some of these specialty investments.
Utility funds are popular with some investors who want more conservative
stock investments, and I discuss these funds in this section, too.
Real estate investment trust funds
Do you want to invest in real estate without the hassle of being a landlord?
Invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are stocks of companies
that invest in real estate. These funds typically invest in properties, such as
230
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

apartment buildings, shopping centers, and other rental properties. Of course,
evaluating REIT stocks is a hassle, but you can always (you guessed it) invest
in a mutual fund of REITs!
REITs are small-company stocks and usually pay decent dividends (these div-
idends aren’t eligible for the lower dividend tax rates for other stock funds).
As such, they aren’t appropriate for higher-tax-bracket investors investing
money outside of retirement accounts. Most of the larger, diversified U.S.
stock funds that I recommend earlier in this chapter have a small portion of
their fund’s assets invested in REITs, so you’ll have some exposure to this
sector without investing in a REIT-focused fund.
Please note that at the time this book goes to press in 2007, REIT funds have
performed extraordinarily since the late 1990s and by historic valuation mea-
sures appear pricey. Here are some solid REIT funds from which to choose:
 Cohen & Steers Realty Shares has been managed by Martin Cohen and
Robert Steers since the fund began in 1991 (two additional co-managers
have recently been added). The minimum initial investment is steep at
$10,000. Discounters also may offer it without transaction charges.
Annual operating expenses are 0.97 percent. % 800-437-9912.
 Fidelity Real Estate Investment, the oldest REIT mutual fund, is man-
aged by Steven Buller, who’s been with Fidelity since 1992 and managed
this fund since 1998. This fund has expenses of 0.82 percent per year.
Initial minimum investment is $2,500 ($500 for retirement accounts). 
% 800-544-8888.
 Vanguard REIT Index, yet another of Vanguard’s long line of index
funds, has minimal expenses of just 0.21 percent. Although this fund will
never be a star in its category, its low expenses should ensure its long-
term success. Minimum investment amount is $3,000. The fund charges
a $20 annual low-balance fee for account balances below $10,000 unless
you register your account on Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery
of statements and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
Utility funds
Utility funds tend to attract older folks who want to earn good dividends and
not have the risk of most stock investments. And that’s what utility funds 
are good for. But this once-staid industry has been shaken up by increased
competition.
In a sense, utility funds are superfluous. Most diversified stock funds contain
some utilities, and those investors who want income can focus on better
income-producing funds, such as Wellesley Income in the hybrid group and
the value-oriented stock funds that I discuss earlier in this chapter.

Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

Precious metals funds
Over the millennia, gold and silver have served as mediums of exchange or
currency because these metals have intrinsic value and can’t be debased.
These precious metals are used not only in jewelry but also in less-frivolous
applications, such as manufacturing.
As investments, gold and silver do well during bouts of inflation. For example,
during the 1970s, when inflation zoomed up in the U.S. and stocks and bonds
went into the tank, gold and silver company stocks skyrocketed. People were
concerned that our government was going on a money-printing binge.
Over the long term, precious metals are lousy investments. They don’t pay
any dividends, and their price increases just keep you up with, but not ahead
of, increases in the cost of living. Although this is better than keeping cash in
a piggy bank or stuffed in a mattress, it’s historically not been as good as
bonds, stocks, and real estate.
If you want to invest in precious metals, don’t buy the bullion itself; storage
costs and the concerns over whether you’re dealing with a reputable com-
pany make buying bullion a pain. Also avoid futures and options (see 
Chapter 1), which are gambles on short-term price movements.
Vanguard Precious Metals fund, like most gold and precious funds, invests in
mining companies’ stocks worldwide because many are outside the U.S. in
countries such as South Africa and Australia. This fund, which also invests in
other metals such as platinum and nickel, has one of the best track records
among precious metals funds and has been around since 1984. Annual oper-
ating expenses for this tax-friendly fund are 0.40 percent. At the time this
book went to press, this fund was closed but will likely reopen, probably
when this market sector isn’t overheated as it has been recently. Minimum
initial investment is $3,000. The fund charges a $20 annual low-balance fee 
for account balances below $10,000 unless you register your account on
Vanguard’s Web site for electronic delivery of statements and fund reports.
% 800-662-7447.
If you expect high inflation or if you just want an inflation hedge in case you
expect the end of civilization, you could invest in a gold and precious metals
fund. But these funds have wild swings and aren’t for the faint of heart or for
the majority of your portfolio. To illustrate why, consider this: In 1993, the
Vanguard Precious Metals fund rocketed up 93 percent, whereas in 1997, it
lost almost 39 percent. For an alternative inflation hedge, consider investing
in inflation-protected Treasury bonds (which I discuss in Chapter 11).

Matching Morals to Investments: 
Socially Responsible Funds
Socially responsible mutual funds appeal to investors who want to marry their
investments to their social principles and avoid supporting causes that they
feel are harmful. These funds attempt to look at more than a company’s
bottom line before deciding to commit their investors’ capital. Many of these
funds consider such factors as environmental protection, equal employment
opportunity, the manner in which a company’s employees are treated, and
the level of honesty that a company displays in its advertising.
I can certainly understand the desire to put your money where your mouth is;
unfortunately, socially responsible funds fail to bridge the gap between theory
and practice. If you blindly plunk down your money on such a fund, you may
be disappointed with what you’re actually getting. Bear with me as I explain.
Evil is in the eye of the beholder
The biggest problem is that the term socially responsible has different mean-
ing for different people. Sure, most socially conscious investors can agree on
some industries as being “bad.” The tobacco industry, associated with hun-
dreds of thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of healthcare costs, is an
obvious example, and socially responsible funds avoid them. But most indus-
tries aren’t so easy to agree on.
For example, McDonald’s is the world’s largest fast-food (hamburger) com-
pany, as well as a stock that some socially responsible funds hold. McDonald’s
is deemed socially responsible because of its support for children’s charities,
participation in recycling programs, hiring and promotion of women and
minorities, and purchase of hundreds of millions of dollars in goods and ser-
vices from woman- and minority-owned businesses.
But how socially responsible is a company whose business depends on beef?
It’s certainly not the best for people’s health, and raising cattle is tremen-
dously land and water intensive. Moreover, some may also question the
screening and awarding of contracts based on gender and ethnicity. Others
may blame McDonald’s for running small local restaurants out of business
and contributing to the sterile strip-mall culture of our communities.
233
Chapter 12: Stock Funds: Meeting Your Longer-Term Needs

Or consider Toys “R” Us, the giant toy retailer and another stock that’s widely
held by socially responsible funds for many of the same reasons that
McDonald’s is. But this company sells widely criticized violent video games
that keep kids away from homework. Thus, some investors might consider
Toys “R” Us a socially irresponsible company — and that’s before you con-
sider the heaps of plastic (made from petroleum) and the drive toward over-
consumption that the toy industry generates.
Pick any company, put it under a magnifying glass, and you can find practices
that are objectionable to somebody’s (perhaps your) moral consciousness.
Of course, that’s a poor argument for throwing in the towel. I’m simply warn-
ing you that you may be hard-pressed to find a fund manager whose defini-
tion of social responsibility is closely enough aligned to yours. A mutual fund,
by its very nature, is trying to please thousands of individual investors.
That’s a tall order when you throw moral consciousness into the picture.
Even if you can agree on what’s socially irresponsible (such as selling
tobacco products), funds aren’t always as clean as you’d think or hope. We
live in a global economy where it’s increasingly difficult to define a company’s
sphere of influence. Although a fund may avoid tobacco manufacturers, it
may invest in retailers that sell tobacco products, or the paper supplier to
the tobacco manufacturer, or the advertising agency that helps pitch tobacco
to consumers.
Ways to express your social concerns
Some funds that aren’t labeled “socially responsible” still meet many investors’
definitions of socially responsible. These other funds usually carry lower fees
and produce better returns. For example, GNMA bond funds invest in mort-
gages that allow people to purchase their own homes. Municipal bond funds
buy bonds issued by local governments to fund projects that most would
consider good — such as building public transportation, libraries, and
schools. See Chapter 9 for my specific bond fund recommendations.
Among the funds that label themselves as socially responsible, my favorite is
the Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund, which tracks an index of medium- and
large-company stocks that meet socially responsible criteria. Begun in 2000,
this fund boasts a Vanguard-thin expense ratio of 0.25 percent. Minimum ini-
tial investment amount is $3,000 ($1,000 for retirement accounts). The fund
charges a $20 annual low-balance fee for account balances below $10,000
unless you register your account on Vanguard’s Web site for electronic deliv-
ery of statements and fund reports. % 800-662-7447.
234
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

If you consider investing in socially responsible funds, look well beyond a
fund’s marketing materials. When you find a socially responsible fund that
interests you, call the fund company and ask it to send you a recent report
that lists the specific investments that the fund owns. Otherwise, you may be
blissfully ignorant, but not as socially responsible as you may like to believe.
You can always consider alternative methods of effecting social change, such
as through volunteer work and donations to causes that you support. You
can also exercise a means of change that people the world over are dying for,
a means that is guaranteed to all U.S. citizens by the Constitution and is exer-
cised today by only a minority of American adults — the right to voice your
opinion and vote.

T
his chapter is where the rubber hits the road. If you read Chapters 10
through 12, where I discuss the details of money market, bond, and stock
funds and everything in between, the concepts and individual funds may be
swirling around your brain like random pieces of paper in a city alley during a
windstorm. (Chapter 9 covers several important investment selection topics
as well, including asset allocation. If you haven’t read that chapter, please do
so now — otherwise, you may be less able to make use of the guidance in this
chapter.)
In this chapter, I talk through some real live cases. (Of course, the names and
details have been changed to protect the innocent!) This chapter should bring
a lot of things together for you; I at least hope that it calms the whirlwind.
My goal in going through these cases is to illustrate useful ways to think
about investing in funds and to provide you with ideas and specific solutions
to investment situations. You may think that you’ll benefit most from reading
only those cases that seem closest to your current situation, but I encourage
you to read as many cases as your time allows — perhaps even all of them.
Each situation raises somewhat different issues, and your life and your
investing needs will change in the years ahead.
Don’t worry if your circumstances don’t perfectly match one of these cases;
in fact, it probably won’t be a complete match. After all, you’re uniquely you.
However, the principles illustrated here are general enough to be tailored to
just about anyone’s specific situation.

Throughout these cases, I hope to show
 How your investing decisions fit within the context of your overall
finances
 How to consider the tax impact of your investing decisions
 How to recognize situations in which you may need to make other finan-
cial moves prior to (and maybe even instead of) investing in mutual funds
Determine where you stand with regard to your own important financial goals,
such as retirement planning (the fund-related ins and outs of which I cover in
Chapter 3), before you put together your investment portfolio. The examples
in this chapter are arranged from the simpler cases to the more complex.
Getting Started
If you’re just starting to get your financial goals together, you’re hardly alone.
If you’re still in school or otherwise new to the working world, good for you if
you want to get on the right investing road now! Regardless of your age,
though, remember that it’s never too late. Just get started.
Starting from square one: Melinda
Melinda is in her 20s, works as an architect, earns decent money, lives in New
Jersey, and has no debt and no savings yet because she just started her first
job. Financially speaking, she’s a blank slate, but because she made a New
Year’s resolution to get her finances in order, she wants to do something.
Her employer offers her health and disability insurance and a profit-sharing
retirement plan, which only her firm may contribute to, but to which small
contributions have been made in the past. She wants to invest in mutual
funds but doesn’t want hassle in either paperwork or complications on an
ongoing basis.
On a monthly basis, she figures that she can save $600. She wants to invest
for growth. With her money earmarked for long-term future needs, such as
retirement, she sees no need to invest conservatively (even though she does
want some of her investments more conservatively invested). She’s in the 28
percent federal tax bracket now, but as her experience in her field increases,
she expects to earn more.
238
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Recommendations: Melinda should consider investing $4,000 annually in a
Roth IRA (see Chapter 3). In her case, a regular IRA contribution won’t be tax
deductible because her employer offers a retirement plan under which she’s
considered covered and because she earns more than is allowed to make a
tax-deductible contribution to a regular IRA.
Melinda could invest in a fund of funds, such as Vanguard LifeStrategy
Growth, Fidelity Freedom 2050, or T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth (all cov-
ered in Chapter 12), all of which offer the simplicity of one-stop shopping and
reduced annual account fees.
Like everyone else, Melinda should have an emergency source of cash.
Although the mutual funds that she’s investing in outside her retirement
account are liquid and can be sold any day, she runs a risk that an unex-
pected emergency could force her to sell when the markets are hung over.
With family to borrow from if needed, she could make do with, say, a cushion
equal to three months’ living expenses. She could even postpone building an
emergency fund until after she funds her IRA. (Normally, I’d recommend
establishing the emergency fund first, but because she has family she can
borrow from, I believe that it’s okay to go for the long-term tax benefits of
funding the IRA account.) Because she won’t keep a large emergency balance,
she could keep her emergency fund in her local bank account, especially if
the balance helps keep her checking account fees down. Given her current
tax bracket, if Melinda wanted a money market mutual fund, she could invest
in a taxable fund, such as Fidelity Cash Reserves or others described in
Chapter 10.
For longer-term growth, Melinda could invest her monthly savings as follows:
60-70% in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
30-40% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index
(The above funds are reasonably tax friendly, which is important because
she’s investing outside a retirement account and is in a reasonably high tax
bracket.)
These funds generally make low taxable distributions and make especially
low distributions, such as short-term capital gains, that are highly taxed.
They require a $3,000 minimum initial investment, so Melinda needs to save
the minimum before she can invest. After the minimum is met and invested in
each fund, she can have money deducted electronically from her checking
account and invested in these mutual funds.

Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

Silencing student loans: 
Stacey the student
Stacey is a 25-year-old graduate student in psychology with three years to go
before she gets her well-deserved degree. She’s hoping that all this education
will fetch her a solid income when she finally gets out of school.
Her current income amounts to about $19,000 per year. She’s also sitting under
$25,000 of student debt from her undergraduate days. Both of her loans are in
deferment, so she’s not obligated to make payments until she finishes gradu-
ate school: One is incurring interest at 7 percent per year; the other is subsi-
dized (the government is paying the interest until she gets out of school).
Fortunately, Stacey has the starving-student-thing down cold. She’s so savvy
at living cheap that despite her low income she has an extra $150 to play with
at the end of every month. (Stacey has an emergency reserve already in place.)
Stacey wants to be debt free sooner, so her first instinct is to use that money
to start paying down those student loans. But Stacey is also excited about
investing for her future. Because half of her student loan interest is subsi-
dized, she’s wondering if she’d come out ahead by using her extra money to
open and invest in an IRA account.
Recommendations: Stacey should be proud of herself. Living below her
means on such a small income, as well as thinking about her financial future,
is commendable. She’s asking good questions. Her decision comes down to a
comparison of the student loan interest rate to the potential return of her IRA
investments. Because she’ll be investing for retirement, which is decades
away for a 25-year-old, Stacey’s time horizon is long enough to focus largely
or almost entirely on stocks. As I discuss in Chapter 1, stocks historically
have returned about 10 percent per year. Measured against the 7 percent
interest she’s paying on her unsubsidized student loan, Stacey can perhaps
come out a little ahead by holding off on student loan payments and invest-
ing in stocks through an IRA account. (She can deduct up to $2,500 per year
in student loan interest on her tax return; her investment returns would ulti-
mately be taxed).
I say that it’s really Stacey’s call as to which option — paying down the 7
interest student loan or investing in good stock mutual funds through an IRA —
makes her feel more comfortable. Financially, the choice is a tossup. It’s worth
noting, however, that the annual savings of 7 percent that comes from paying
down the student loan is a sure thing, whereas the stock market annual average
returns of 10 percent are an expectation and in no way guaranteed. For this
reason, I’d be inclined to pay down the student loans at 7 percent.
240
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

If Stacey decides to go the IRA route, because she has such a long time hori-
zon, her fund(s) should focus almost entirely on stocks. Ideally, her fund(s)
should be diversified across large-, medium-, and small-company stocks as
well as international investments. Stacey’s situation is ideally suited for a
fund of funds (such as the ones I recommend to Melinda in the preceding sec-
tion). Alternatively, if she wants to get going with investing $150 per month
and not wait to save enough to meet a fund’s minimum, she could invest
monthly in an automatic investment plan (AIP) through a company such as
TIAA-CREF or T. Rowe Price that waives fund minimums if you sign up for an
AIP (see the sidebar “Getting started with just $50 per month”).
Living month to month with debt: 
Mobile Mark
Mark is a 42-year-old renter who says that he has no desire to own a home. He
doesn’t want the feeling of being tied down in case he ever wants to move —
something he’s done a lot of over the years. Currently, he lives in California.
Feeling that he’s hit middle age, Mark wants to start socking away money reg-
ularly into investments. He has a large folder filled with mutual fund ads and

Getting started with just $50 per month
Although most mutual funds’ minimum initial
investment amount of a couple of thousand dol-
lars is quite small compared to that of private
money managers, who have six-figure to sev-
eral-million-dollar entrance requirements, the
amount may still loom large if you’re just starting
to save and invest. You want to get on with the
program, and you don’t want to risk giving in to
the temptation to spend your savings if they’re
sitting around in your bank account until you
can save enough for high-fund minimums.
Here’s a way around the problem. Some fund
companies (for example, TIAA-CREF and T.
Rowe Price) allow you to invest in their funds
without meeting the minimum initial investment
requirements as long as you enroll in an auto-
matic investment program. You can do the trick
with these by having a small amount per month
deducted from your bank account and sent
electronically to the fund company. Call the fund
family’s toll-free number to see if it offers an
automatic investment plan for a fund you’re
interested in.
Also remember that fund retirement account
minimums are significantly lower — often as
low as $50 per month, some even less. A final
strategy is to save for several months until you
have enough for some of the funds recom-
mended in Chapters 10, 11, and 12 that have
lower minimums.

prospectuses but finds most of the material confusing and intimidating. He
has about $5,000 in a bank IRA invested in a certificate of deposit.
Mark feels insecure living month to month and being so dependent on his
paycheck. One of the reasons he’s feeling some financial pressure is that, in
addition to his monthly rent, he has an auto loan payment of about $300 per
month and total credit card debt of $6,000. He also doesn’t have any family
he can depend on for money in an emergency.
Recommendations: Although Mark has the best of intentions, he’s a good
example of someone who’s managed to get his financial priorities out of
order. Mark’s best and most appropriate investment now is to pay off his
credit card and auto loan debt and forget about fund investing for a while.
These debts have interest rates of 10 to 15 percent, and paying them off is
actually his best investment.
Like millions of others, Mark got into these debts because credit is so easily
available and encouraged in our society. Such easy access to borrowing has
encouraged Mark to spend more than he’s been earning. Thus, one of the first
things he should do is figure just where his money goes in a typical month.
By using his credit card statement, checkbook register, and memory of items
he’s bought with cash, Mark can determine how much he’s spending on food,
clothing, transportation, and so on. He needs to make some tough decisions
about which expenditures he’ll cut so that he can pay off his debts.
Like Melinda (the 20-something architect in the first example), Mark should
also build an emergency reserve. If he ever loses his job, becomes disabled,
or whatever, he’d be in real financial trouble. Mark has no family to help him
in a financial pinch, and he’s close to the limits of debt allowed on his credit
cards. Because he often draws his checking account balance down to a few
hundred dollars when he pays his monthly bills, building up his reserve in
his checking or savings account to minimize monthly service charges makes
the most sense for him now. Recently, Mark eliminated about $100 per year in
service charges by switching to a bank that waives these fees if he direct
deposits his paycheck.
By mainly going on a strict financial program — which included sacrifices such
as dumping his expensive new car and moving so that he could walk or bike
to work — within three years, Mark became debt-free and accumulated several
thousand dollars in his local bank. Now he’s ready to invest in mutual funds.
Because his employer offers no retirement savings programs, Mark should
annually contribute $4,000 to an individual retirement account (IRA). Mark
doesn’t want investments that can get clobbered: He thinks that he’s been
late to the saving game and doesn’t want to add insult to injury by losing his
242
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

shirt in his first investments. Being a conservative sort, Mark thinks that
Vanguard makes sense for him. For his IRA, he can divide his money between
a hybrid fund, such as Vanguard Wellington (70 percent), and an international
stock fund, such as Vanguard International Growth (30 percent). In addition
to his new $3,000 contribution, Mark also should transfer his $5,000 bank CD
IRA into these funds. In the event that he isn’t eligible for a tax deduction on
a regular IRA, he should definitely fund a Roth IRA.
Now debt-free, Mark thinks that he can invest about $400 per month in addi-
tion to his annual IRA contribution. His income is moderate, so he’s in the 28
percent federal tax bracket. He wants diversification, but he doesn’t have a
lot of money to start his investing program. He has set up automatic invest-
ment plans whereby each month the $400 is invested as follows:
50% in T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced or T. Rowe Price
Retirement 2030 ($50 per month minimum with automatic 
investment plan)
50% in TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation ($50 per month minimum with
automatic investment plan)
Competing goals: Gina and George
George works as a software engineer and his wife Gina works as a paralegal.
They live in Virginia, are in their 30s, and have about $20,000 in a savings
account, to which they currently add about $1,000 per month. This money is
tentatively earmarked for a home purchase that they expect to make in the
next few years. They figure they need a total of $40,000 for a down payment
and closing costs; they’re in no hurry to buy because they plan to relocate
after they have children in order to be closer to family. (The allure of free
baby-sitting is just too powerful a draw!)
Justifiably, they’re pleased with their ability to save money — but they’re also
disappointed with themselves for leaving so much money earning so little
interest in a bank. They figure that they need to be serious about investments
because they want to retire by age 60, and they recognize that kids cost
money.
George’s company, although growing rapidly, doesn’t offer a pension plan. 
In fact, the only benefits his company does offer are health insurance and a
401(k) plan that George isn’t contributing to because plan participants can’t
borrow against their balances. Gina’s employer offers health insurance, $50,000
of life insurance, and disability insurance — but, like George’s employer, Gina’s
employer doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan.
243
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

Recommendations: Deciding between saving for a home or funding a retire-
ment account and immediately reducing one’s taxes is often a difficult choice.
In George and Gina’s case, however, they can and should do some of both. At a
minimum, George can save 10 percent of his income in his company’s 401(k)
plan. Wanting to be somewhat aggressive and considering his age, George
could invest about 80 percent in stock funds with the balance in bonds
among his 401(k) plan’s mutual fund investment options.
Here are his 401(k) plan options and how he should invest:
0% in the money market fund option
20% in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
20% in Fidelity Contrafund
25% in Dodge & Cox Stock
35% in Oakmark International
0% in a so-called guaranteed investment contract (GIC) that isn’t a mutual
fund but a fixed-return insurance contract (see the sidebar on “Investing
money in company-sponsored retirement plans” for a discussion of these
investment options)
If George contributes the maximum amount through his employer’s 401(k)
and he and Gina still want to invest more in retirement accounts, they can
invest $4,000 each, per year, into an IRA.
Gina shouldn’t worry that, if she and George divorce, George would get all the
money in his 401(k) plan. As with nonretirement account assets, these assets
can be split between a divorcing husband and wife. A more significant con-
cern would occur if, say, George is an isolated dunce and refuses to talk to
Gina about the investment of this money for their retirement and makes some
not-so-smart moves, such as frequently jumping from one fund to another.
(Try discussing this issue with your spouse. If you don’t get anywhere with
your spouse, pay a visit to your local marriage counselor.)
What about their $20,000 that’s sitting in a bank savings account? They should
move it, especially because George is a fan of USAA, having benefited from
their terrific insurance programs as a member of a military family. Initially, he
and Gina can establish a tax-free money market fund, such as the USAA VA
Money Market fund, as an emergency reserve.
Because they don’t plan to need the down payment money for the home for
another three to five years, they can invest some of their savings — perhaps
as much as half — in the USAA Tax-Exempt Intermediate-Term Bond fund.
Even though they’ll pick up a little more yield, they need to know that the
bond fund share price declines if interest rates rise. (For that weighty sub-
ject, see Chapter 11.)

Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

245
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios
Investing money in company-sponsored 
retirement plans
In some company-sponsored plans, such as
401(k)s, you’re limited to the predetermined
investment options your employer offers. In
most plans, the mutual funds are decent and
make you happy that you didn’t have to do the
research. Plans differ in the specific options
they offer, but these basic choices are common:
 Money market funds: These funds offer
safety of principal because they don’t fluc-
tuate in value. But you run the risk that your
investment won’t keep up with or stay
ahead of inflation and taxes (which are due
upon withdrawal of your money from the
retirement account). In most cases, skip
this option.
If you use the borrowing feature that some
retirement plans allow, you may need to
keep money in the money market invest-
ment option. For regular contributions
coming out of your paycheck, money funds
make little sense.
 Bond mutual funds: This option pays higher
yields than money funds but carries greater
risk because the value can fall if interest
rates increase. However, bonds tend to be
more stable in value than stocks.
Aggressive, younger investors should keep
a minimum amount of money in these funds,
whereas older folks who want to invest
more conservatively may want to invest
more money this way.
 Guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs):
Backed by an insurance company that typ-
ically quotes you an interest rate a little
lower than on bond funds, GICs have no
volatility (that you can see). The insurance
company, however, normally invests your
money mostly in bonds and a bit in stocks.
GICs are generally better than keeping 
your retirement money in a money market
or savings account, both of which usually
pay a couple of percent less in yield (see
Chapter 11).
 Balanced mutual funds: Invest in a mixture
primarily of stocks and bonds. This one-stop
shopping concept makes investing easier
and smoothes out fluctuations in the value
of your investments — funds investing
exclusively in stocks or bonds make for a
rougher ride. These funds are solid options
and can be used for the majority of your
retirement plan contributions.
 Stock mutual funds: Invest in stocks, which
usually provide greater long-term growth
potential but also wider fluctuations in value
from year to year. Some companies offer a
number of different stock funds, including
those investing overseas. Unless you plan
to borrow (if your plan allows) against your
funds — for example, for a home purchase —
you probably should have a healthy helping
of stock funds.
 Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs):
Offer employees the option of investing in
their company’s stock (not all companies
make these plans available). Generally, I’d
avoid this option because your future
income and other employee benefits are
already riding on the company’s success. If
the company hits the skids, you may lose
your job and your benefits. You certainly
don’t want the value of your retirement
account to depend on the same factors. If
you expect your company to conquer the
competition, though, investing a portion of
your retirement account is fine if you’re a
risk-seeking sort — but no more than 25
percent. If you can buy the stock at a dis-
count compared to its current market value,
that’s so much the better.

George should get some disability insurance to protect his income. (It turns
out that his employer offers a cost-effective group coverage plan.) Before
Gina becomes pregnant, George and Gina should also purchase some term
life insurance.
If George and Gina had little or no money saved and couldn’t save for both
the home and get the tax benefits of their retirement account contributions,
they’d have a tougher choice. They should make their decision based on how
important the home purchase is to them. Doing some of both (saving for the
home and in the retirement accounts) is good, but the option of not using the
retirement account and putting all their savings into the home down payment
“account” is fine, too.
Wanting lots and lotsa money: 
Pat and Chris
Pat and Chris earn good money, are in their 40s, and live in South Dakota. Pat
is self-employed and wants to sock away as much as possible in a retirement
savings plan. He figures that he can invest at least 10 percent of his income.
Chris works for the government, which offers a retirement plan with the follow-
ing options: a money market fund, a government (big surprise!) bond fund, and
a stock fund that invests in large-company United States (U.S.) stocks only.
Pat and Chris want diversification and are willing to invest aggressively. They
want convenience, and they’re willing to pay for it. In addition to Pat’s retire-
ment plan, they want and are able to save additional money to invest for other
purposes, such as Chris’s dreams of buying a small business and investing in
real estate. They currently own a home that has a mortgage that could easily
be supported by one of their incomes. Neither depends on the other’s income.
Pat also has an $8,000 IRA account, which is currently divided between a
Class B growth stock fund and a Class A total return bond fund (both load
funds). Pat hasn’t contributed to the IRA for six years now. He also owns a
universal life insurance plan, which he bought from the same broker who
sold him the load mutual funds. He bought the life insurance plan five years
ago when he no longer could make tax-deductible contributions to his IRA;
the life insurance plan is better than an IRA, according to Pat’s broker,
because he can borrow from it. The broker told Pat last week that his life
insurance plan is “paid up” (he need not put any more money into the plan to
pay for the $20,000 of life insurance coverage) and has a cash value of $3,300,
although he’d lose $1,200 (due to surrender charges) if he cashed it in now.
Recommendations: First, Pat should get rid of his load mutual funds and his
current broker. The broker has sold Pat crummy mutual funds. The funds
have high fees and dismal performance relative to their peers. He could
transfer his fund monies into something like Vanguard Star.
246
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Pat doesn’t need life insurance because no one depends on Pat’s income.
Besides, it’s a lousy investment. (For the compelling reasons why you’re
better off not using life insurance for investing, see Chapter 1.) Pat should
dump the life insurance and either take the proceeds or roll them over into a
variable annuity (which I explain later in this chapter).
Pat can establish a Keogh retirement savings plan and stash away up to 20
percent of his net self-employment income per year (See Chapter 3 for more
on Keoghs). He could establish his Keogh plan through a discount brokerage
account that offers him access to a variety of funds from many firms. Over
the years, he could divide up his Keogh money as follows:
15% in Dodge & Cox Income or Harbor Bond
15% in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
10% in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
10% in Vanguard Strategic Equity and Fairholme
20% in T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth
15% in Oakmark Global
15% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index
Because Chris doesn’t have international stock funds as an investment
option, Pat can invest more in these than he normally should if he were
investing on his own. In Chris’s retirement plan, contributions could be allo-
cated this way: approximately one-third into the bond fund and the remain-
der in the stock fund.
As for accumulating money for Chris to purchase a small business or to
invest in real estate, Pat and Chris should establish a tax-free money market
fund, such as the Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market fund, for this purpose.
As could George and Gina earlier in this chapter, Pat and Chris can invest in a
short- to intermediate-term tax-free bond fund if they anticipate not using
this money for at least several years and want potential higher returns.
Changing Goals and Starting Over
Life changes, so your investing needs may change as well. If you have existing
investments, some may no longer make sense for your present situation.
Perhaps your investment mix is too conservative, too aggressive, too taxing,
or too cumbersome given your new responsibilities. Or maybe you’ve been
through a major life change that’s causing you to reevaluate or begin to take
charge of your investments. The following sections offer some examples sure
to stimulate your thinking about an investing makeover.
247
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

Funding education: The Waltons
One of the biggest life changes that makes many adults think more about
investing is the arrival of a child or two. And after contemplating all the fear-
mongering ads and articles about how they’re going to need a gazillion dol-
lars to send their little bundles of joy off to college in 18 years, many a parent
goes about investing in the wrong way.
The Waltons — Bill, 42, and Carol, 41, along with their two children, Ted, 3,
and Alice, 5 — live in the suburbs of Chicago in a home with a white picket
fence and a dog and cat. They own a home with a mortgage of $150,000 out-
standing. Their household income is modest because they both teach.
The Waltons have $40,000 in five individual securities in a brokerage account
they inherited two years ago. They also have $20,000 in two of that same bro-
kerage firm’s limited partnerships, now worth less than half of what they paid
for them years ago. Bill and Carol prefer safer investments that don’t fluctu-
ate violently in value.
They have $25,000 invested in IRAs within a load domestic stock fund and
$10,000 in a load foreign stock fund outside an IRA. Bill hasn’t been pleased
with the foreign fund, and Carol is concerned about supporting foreign coun-
tries when so many Americans are without jobs. Both of them like conserva-
tive, easy-to-understand investments and hate paperwork. They also have
$10,000 apiece in custodial accounts for each of the kids, which Bill’s dad has
contributed for their educational expenses. Bill’s dad wants to continue con-
tributing money for the kids’ college expenses.
Bill just took a new job with a university that offers a 403(b) retirement sav-
ings plan, which he can get with many of the major mutual fund companies.
He wasn’t saving through his old employer’s 403(b) plan because, with the
kids, they spend all their incomes. Carol’s employer doesn’t have a retire-
ment savings plan.
Recommendations: First, Bill should be taking advantage of his employer’s
403(b) plan. Though he may think that he can’t afford to, he really can. If need
be, he should dump the individual securities and use that money to help meet
living expenses while he has money deducted from his paycheck for the tax-
deductible 403(b) account. (Always consider the tax consequences if you
consider selling securities held outside of a retirement account. In the Waltons’
case, these securities have only been held for a couple of years and were
worth approximately the amount of their tax cost basis — see Chapter 16 for
more on tax basis.)
248
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

TIAA-CREF would be a fine choice for Bill’s 403(b). He could allocate his
money as follows:
100% in TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation (fund of funds)
or
100% in Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth (fund of funds)
Bill and Carol could hold onto their load domestic stock fund investment that
they have in their IRAs: This fund has a solid track record and reasonable
annual fees of 0.7 percent. Its only drawback is its sales load of 5.75 percent,
which is water under the bridge for Bill and Carol because it was deducted
when they first bought this fund.
Their foreign stock fund isn’t a good fund and has high ongoing management
fees. They should dump this fund and invest the proceeds in some better and
more diversified international stock funds, such as those in Chapter 12. And
regarding Carol’s concerns about supporting foreign companies, many com-
panies today have operations worldwide. If she’s strongly against investing
overseas, I suppose that she can choose not to invest her IRA money overseas,
but her portfolio will likely be more volatile and less profitable in the long
run. Foreign stocks don’t always move in lock step with domestic ones, and
some foreign economies are growing at a much faster rate than our economy.
Regarding custodial accounts, Bill and Carol need to remember that the
amount of financial aid their kids will qualify for decreases as more money is
saved in their names. Bill’s dad should hold onto the money himself or give it
to Bill and Carol. (This latter option has the added benefit of increasing Bill’s
ability to fund his 403(b) account and take advantage of the tax breaks it
offers.) Bill and Carol (and you as well, if you have children) should read
Chapter 3, which has important information you should know before you
invest in funds for college.
The limited partnerships are bad news. Bill and Carol should wait them out
until they’re liquidated and then transfer the money into some good no-load
mutual funds.
Rolling over (but not playing dead):
Cathy
It’s a surprise to her as much as it is to her friends and family: Cathy has a
new job. Although she was happily employed for many years with a
249
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

respected software company, she got smitten with the entrepreneurial bug
and signed on with a well-funded start-up software company. Her 401(k) plan
investment of about $100,000 is invested in the stock of her previous employer.
The company is waiting for Cathy’s instructions for dealing with the money.
It’s been nine months since she got sucked into the vortex of the insane
hours of a start-up company.
Nearing 40, tired but invigorated from those long days at her new company,
Cathy has resolved to make some decisions about where to invest this money.
She’s comfortable investing the money fairly quickly after she thinks she has
a plan. Cathy wants to invest somewhat aggressively: Although she enjoys
working hard, she happily imagines a time when she doesn’t need to work at
all. She likes the idea of diversifying her investments across a few different
fund families. She also wants to minimize her paperwork by setting up as few
accounts as possible while at the same time minimizing transaction fees.
Recommendations: Cathy should sell her stock through her old employer
and transfer cash. This sale will save on brokerage commissions. Having her
retirement money in one company’s stock like this is risky.
For the best of both worlds, Cathy can establish an IRA through Vanguard’s
brokerage divisions, which would give her access to all the great Vanguard
funds, plus access for a small fee to non-Vanguard funds. She could invest the
money as follows:
20% in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
30% in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index
10% in Vanguard Selected Value or Fairholme or Weitz Value
10% in Vanguard Primecap Core
10% in Oakmark Global or Tweedy Browne Global Value
10% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index
10% in Artisan International or Dodge & Cox International
Wishing for higher interest rates: 
Nell, the near retiree
Nell is a social worker. Now 59 and single, she wants to plan for a comfortable
retirement. In addition to owning her home without a mortgage, she has
$150,000 currently invested as follows:
$40,000 in a bank money market account
$75,000 in Treasury bills that mature this month
250
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

$35,000 in an insurance annuity that’s invested in a “guaranteed invest-
ment contract” through her employer’s nonprofit retirement savings
403(b) plan
Nell currently earns $35,000 per year and has received pay increases over the
years that keep pace with inflation. She has $250 per month deducted from
her paycheck for the annuity plan. Her employer allows investments in the
retirement plan through almost any insurance company or mutual fund com-
pany she chooses. She’s also saving about $800 per month in her bank account.
She hates to waste money on anything, and she doesn’t mind some paperwork.
Nell is concerned about outliving her money; she doesn’t plan to work past
age 65. She’s terrified of investments that can decrease in value, and she
knows a friend who lost thousands of dollars in the stock market. She says
that her CDs and Treasuries were terrific in the 1980s when she was earning
10 percent or more on her money. She’s concerned now, though. She keeps
reading and hearing that many large, reputable companies are laying off thou-
sands of workers, but the stock market seems to be once again rising to high
levels. She wishes that interest rates would rise again.
Recommendations: First, Nell should stop wishing for higher interest rates.
Interest rates are primarily driven by inflation, and high inflation erodes the
purchasing power of one’s money (see Chapter 11). The problem here is that
Nell’s portfolio is poorly diversified. All her money is in fixed-income (lend-
ing) investments that offer no real potential for growth and no real protection
against further increases in the cost of living.
Even though she’s planning to retire in six years, she’s certainly not going to
use or need all of her savings in the first few years of retirement. She won’t
use some of her money until her 70s and 80s. Thus, she should invest some
money in investments that have growth potential.
Nell also could and should invest more through her employer’s retirement
savings plan because she’s saving so much outside that plan and already has
a large emergency reserve. In fact, she should invest the maximum amount
allowed under her employer’s plan: 20 percent of her salary. She also can do
better to invest in no-load funds for her 403(b) plan instead of through an
insurance annuity, which carries higher fees. Vanguard and its hybrid funds
(which are far less volatile because they invest in many different types of
securities) are logical choices for her to use for her 403(b). I’d recommend
the following investment mix for Nell’s 403(b):
25% in Vanguard Wellesley Income
25% in Vanguard Star
25% in Vanguard Wellington
25% in Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth
251
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

In addition to putting future money into these mutual funds, Nell should also
decide whether she wants to transfer her existing annuity money into these
funds as well. First, she should check her annuity account statement to see
whether the insurance company would assess a penalty for transferring her
balance. (Many insurance companies charge these penalties to make up for the
commissions they have to pay to insurance agents for selling the annuities.)
If the penalty is high, she might delay the transfer a few years: These penal-
ties tend to dissipate over time (because the insurer has use of your money
long enough to compensate for the agent’s commission). If, however, the
annuity is a subpar performer (a likelihood, given its high fees), she may want
to go ahead with the transfer despite a current penalty. (See Chapter 14 for
how to do proper transfers.)
With the $115,000 in money outside of her retirement accounts, Nell can grad-
ually invest (perhaps once per quarter over two years) a good portion of this
money into a mix of funds that, overall, is more conservative than the mix
she’s using for her 403(b). She can be more conservative because she’d likely
tap the nonretirement money first in the future. She should reserve $25,000 in
Vanguard’s U.S. Treasury money market fund, which pays more than her bank
account. Nell wants to have her emergency reserve in an investment that’s
government backed.
Nell can use taxable funds for the other $90,000 because
 She’s in a low-to-moderate tax bracket.
 She’s nearing retirement.
 Investing solely in tax-friendly funds wouldn’t meet her needs. (The
stock funds would have to be growth oriented — increasing the risk
beyond Nell’s comfort level.)
I recommend that she invest the money as follows:
25% in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
20% in Vanguard Wellington
25% in TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation
20% in T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced
10% in Fidelity Puritan
If you’re older than Nell, you can use a similar but more conservative mix of
funds. For example, if you’re in your 70s, for the 403(b), you could substitute
the Vanguard LifeStrategy Income fund in place of the LifeStrategy Moderate
Growth fund and invest 40 percent in that fund and 20 percent each in the
other three funds (Wellesley Income, Star, and Wellington). For the nonretire-
ment money, you could shift the Fidelity Puritan money to the Vanguard Total
Bond Market Index fund.
252
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Lovin’ retirement: Noel and Patricia
Noel and Patricia, both age 65, are retired, healthy, and enjoying their long
days unfettered by the obligations of work. They take long road trips
together to pursue their hobbies. Noel is an avid fisherman, and Patricia is a
wildlife photographer.
Together, they want about $4,500 per month to live on. Social Security pro-
vides $1,500 per month, and Noel’s pension plan kicks in another $1,500 per
month. That leaves an extra $1,500 per month that must come from their
$400,000 nest egg, currently comprised of
$260,000 in bank CDs
$40,000 in a money market
$100,000 in IRAs, most of it in hybrid funds and bonds
They’re earning about 5 percent per year on these investments and are in a
low tax bracket.
Noel and Patricia have an outstanding $50,000 mortgage at 7 percent interest.
Recommendations: A good portfolio for a retiree must not only provide an
income for today’s expenses but also protect income for the years down the
road. Noel and Patricia are managing to get by on the current income from
their investments, but with only 10 percent of their nest egg invested for
growth in stocks, they’ve left themselves quite exposed to the ravages of
inflation. Their retirement could easily last another 25+ years. Unless they
allocate their assets more aggressively, their nest egg may not last that long.
They can accomplish all their goals if they’re able to boost their portfolio’s
total average annual returns from 6 percent to 8 percent. (You have to crunch
some numbers to figure out where you stand in terms of retirement planning;
see Chapter 3.) Averaging 8 percent annual returns shouldn’t prove difficult;
Noel and Patricia can boost their stock allocation to about 50 percent.
First, however, when the CDs mature, Noel and Patricia should go ahead and
pay off the remaining $50,000 of their mortgage. Even if they invested a bigger
portion of their portfolio in potentially higher returning investments such as
stocks, they can’t easily expect to get an overall return that much better than
7 percent, the interest rate they’re currently paying on the mortgage. True,
the tax deductibility of mortgage interest effectively reduces that interest
rate a bit, but don’t forget that they must pay income tax on investment divi-
dends and profits as well as on retirement account withdrawals, which effec-
tively reduces the rate of return on their investments.
As evidenced by their current investment choices, Noel and Patricia are conser-
vative, safety-minded investors. And although they could be more aggressive,
253
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

Noel and Patricia can’t be too aggressive, given their ages. Thus, paying off
their mortgage, which carries a 7 percent interest rate, makes good sense. In
addition to the psychological satisfaction of owning their home free and
clear, by eliminating their monthly mortgage payment, Noel and Patricia will
reduce their cost of living, taking pressure off their need to generate as much
current investment income.
They can also afford to move quite a bit of money out of their money market
fund into better-yielding bond funds; $9,000 in the money market, enough to
cover six months of expenses together with their Social Security and pension
checks, is plenty.
So, after paying off the mortgage and withdrawing cash from the money
market, they’ll have $241,000 to invest in funds in a nonretirement account.
They could invest it as follows:
20% in Dodge & Cox Income or Vanguard Total Bond Market Index
20% in Vanguard Wellesley
20% in T. Rowe Price Balanced
40% in Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth
With their IRAs, they could keep their financial affairs really simple and use a
fund of funds, such as Vanguard’s LifeStrategy Moderate Growth or TIAA-
CREF Managed Allocation.
254
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
The dreaded d’s: Downsizing, divorce, 
disability, and death
Life isn’t always what we hope it’ll be. Sometimes
it changes suddenly. You lose your job, your
health, or a loved one. Everyone reacts differ-
ently to these events. Some maintain a balanced
and positive perspective. Others get depressed,
panic, and make rash decisions. If you’re making
financial decisions that you haven’t had to make
before, you owe it to yourself to be educated
about your options and the pros and cons of
each. Be especially careful about hiring financial
help because you’re in danger of being too
dependent and blindly following advice.
The only step you should rush to take is to raise
an emergency reserve if you need one. Be care-
ful about selling any investment that you’ve made
a profit on. In one case, a client I had just started
working with got laid off. From his perspective, the
layoff came out of nowhere; it was a complete
shock. He was married, and he and his wife were
raising their two children. They were heavily in
debt, having stretched to buy the most expensive
home they could afford and having leased two
expensive cars. They had decent savings, but all
their money was in the stock market. Luckily for
them, this scenario occurred when the market
was doing well. This guy’s first move was to sell
some of their stock to raise cash to tide them over
if finding a job took a while. This move made sense
and was all that he needed to do immediately. The
rest of their investments could be left alone.

Dealing with a Mountain of Moola
Sometimes the financial forces are with you and money pours your way.
Hopefully, this windfall happens for good reasons instead of due to a negative
event. Regardless, a pile of money may overwhelm you. The good news is
that a lump sum gives you more financial options. The following sections
describe the ways a couple of people handled their sudden wealth.
He’s in the money: Cash-rich Chuck
Chuck is a successful Pennsylvania entrepreneur in his late 30s. Starting from
scratch, he opened a restaurant eight years ago. Today, he’s reaping the fruits
of his labor. After several relocations and remodels, Chuck has built himself
quite an operation, with 40 employees on the payroll. It’s difficult for him to
believe, but his restaurant’s profit is now running at around $500,000 per
year. Not surprisingly, money has been piling up at a fast rate. He now has
about $800,000 resting in his business bank checking account paying next 
to no interest.
He owns a home with a mortgage of about $250,000 but has no money in retire-
ment savings plans. Chuck doesn’t want to set up a retirement savings plan at
his company because he’d have to make contributions for all of his employ-
ees in a plan such as an SEP-IRA or a Keogh (which I cover in Chapter 3).
Chuck has been planning to open another location. He figures that a second
location will cost around $400,000, but, as he says, “You just never know with
construction work what the total tab may be.” He considers himself a conser-
vative investor.
Recommendations: The first thing Chuck should do is get his pile of money
out of the bank and into a safer investment. Bank accounts are federally
insured only up to $100,000 — so if his bank fails (and banks have and will
continue to fail), he’ll have a lot to cry over. Besides, money market funds
pay much better interest than his checking account does.
Chuck has several options for investing his excess money. The first is to pay
for the cost of a second location: With his savings, he can likely buy a second
location with cash. But he faces a couple of drawbacks to using too much or
all of his cash on a second location:
 The issue of liquidity: You can’t write checks on a piece of real estate
(unless you establish a home equity line of credit).
 The issue of diversification: If he doesn’t use all his savings on a second
location, he can invest in things other than his business.

Another option for Chuck is to pay off his home mortgage. Yes, he gets a
decent tax deduction for his mortgage interest on Schedule A of his Form
1040 — although some of the tax write-off is lost because of his high income.
However, because Chuck has all this extra cash, paying off the mortgage
saves interest dollars. That would leave $550,000 in his money fund.
If he paid down his mortgage and didn’t want to pay all cash for his second
restaurant location, he could take out a business loan. However, that loan
would likely be at a higher interest rate than the rate he pays on a mortgage
for his home (because banks consider small-business loans riskier). Because
some of the home mortgage interest isn’t tax-deductible, the options are
close to a financial wash in Chuck’s case. So he could pay off the mortgage
and perhaps use some of his remaining money to pay for part of the second
location, and the rest could be financed with a business loan.
He should keep a good cushion — say, around $200,000 — for operating pur-
poses for his business. Some entrepreneurs, including those who’ve gone on
to achieve great success, have violated these principles — and more — by
not only pouring all their savings into their business but also by borrowing
heavily. I say: To each his own. There’s nothing wrong with going for it if
you’re willing and able to accept the financial consequences. However, if the
going gets tough and you don’t have a safety net (such as family members
who could help with a small short-term loan), be careful.
Because Chuck uses his current bank account for keeping his excess cash as
well as for check writing, he could establish a tax-free money market fund
with check-writing privileges. Some brokerage accounts, such as those
offered by discount brokers (such as Fidelity, Vanguard, and TD Ameritrade),
offer unlimited check writing. (See Chapter 10 for more on money funds.)
Beyond the money market fund, Chuck could begin to invest some money
($100,000 to $200,000) in reasonably tax-friendly mutual funds through
Vanguard:
20% in Vanguard PA Long-Term Tax-Exempt
35% in Vanguard Tax-Managed Capital Appreciation
15% in Vanguard Tax-Managed Small-Cap
15% in Vanguard Tax-Managed International
15% in Vanguard Total International Stock Index
In place of the previously mentioned stock funds, Chuck could use some
exchange-traded funds (ETFs). For example, in place of the two domestic
stock funds, he could invest in Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF. In place of
the foreign stock funds, he could use Vanguard’s FTSE All-World ex-U.S. ETF.

Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Inheritances: Loaded Liz
About a year ago, Liz, who’s in her 40s, came into a significant inheritance when
her mother passed away. She received about $600,000; $150,000 of this sum was
a portfolio of individual large-company, higher-yielding stocks, and the balance
came as cash. The stock portfolio is being managed by an out-of-state adviser,
who charges 1.5 percent per year as an advisory fee and places trades through a
brokerage firm. Despite the fact that the portfolio usually has only about eight
stocks in it, trade confirmations come in about once per month.
Liz currently is a college professor and makes about $50,000 per year. She has
approximately $40,000 invested in the TIAA-CREF retirement plan, with 80
percent in the plan’s bond fund and 20 percent in its stock fund. She’s saving
and investing about $400 per month in the plan because that’s the amount
she can afford. Liz also has $110,000 in a bank IRA CD that will mature soon.
Liz currently owns a home and is happy with it. It has a mortgage of about
$90,000 at a fixed rate of 7.5 percent. She wants to retire early, perhaps before
age 60, so that she can travel and see the world. She’s wary of risk and gets
queasy over volatile investments, but she’s open to different types of funds.
She likes to use many different companies but doesn’t want the headache of a
ton of paperwork. Liz prefers doing business over the phone and through the
mail because she’s too busy to go to an office.
Recommendations: First, Liz should maximize her retirement contributions
even though she thinks that she’s saving all that she can afford. She has all
this extra money now that she could draw upon and use to supplement her
reduced take-home pay if maximizing her retirement contributions doesn’t
leave enough to live on.
This extra cash also affords Liz another good move — getting rid of the mort-
gage. It’s costing her 7.5 percent interest pre-tax (around 5.5 percent after tax
write-offs), and she’d have to take a fair amount of risk with her investments
to better this rate of return.
Liz also needs to invest her money more aggressively, particularly inside her
retirement accounts. All of her IRA and 80 percent of her employer’s retire-
ment plan money are in fixed-income investments. In the TIAA-CREF plan, she
can invest 30 percent in the bond fund, 40 percent in its stock fund, and 30
percent in its global equities fund.
She could transfer her IRA account to a discount broker and invest it as follows:
40% in Vanguard Star
20% in Fidelity Freedom 2030
257
Chapter 13: Working It Out: Sample Portfolios

20% in T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth
10% in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index or ETF
10% in Dodge & Cox International
After paying down the mortgage and keeping an emergency reserve of
$40,000, as well as another $70,000 for remodeling, Liz would have $250,000 in
cash plus the stocks. She should sell the stocks because their dividend
income is taxable and she’s paying 1.5 percent per year (plus commissions)
to have her account managed. The account has underperformed the S & P
500 by an average of 3 percent per year over the past five years. She could
transfer these shares to Vanguard’s discount brokerage division and then sell
them there to save on commissions as well as to have money at Vanguard to
invest in their funds. Then Liz could invest the remaining $400,000 once per
quarter over the next two to three years as follows:
20% Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt
40% Vanguard Tax-Managed Balanced
25% in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index or ETF
15% in Tweedy Browne Global Value or Oakmark Global
Getting Unstuck . . .
Some people feel overwhelmed when they’re making investing decisions. If
you’re one of those people — and if you’re willing to pay the price and put in
the hours to interview and select the right person and firm — you can hire a
financial adviser (see Chapter 22). But if you’re not willing to put in that time
and money, don’t worry — you can still keep things simple (without sacrific-
ing quality). Table 13-1 can help you establish and maintain a simple, yet
solid, mutual fund portfolio by using funds of funds (which I discuss in
Chapter 12).
Table 13-1 assumes that you’re investing money for retirement and that
you’re willing to take on a moderate level of risk. (Remember that, because
funds of funds hold thousands of individual securities, they’re more than
diverse enough to be used “exclusively.”) When investing money in a retire-
ment account (or if you’re not concerned about taxable distributions, in a
nonretirement account), use the recommended mix of funds for your age in
the second column. When investing retirement money that happens to be in a
nonretirement account, you can avoid taxable distributions by using the rec-
ommended selection of funds for your age in the third column.

Applications, Transfers, and 
Other Useful Forms
In This Chapter
 Explaining application basics
 Understanding nonretirement and retirement account forms
 Establishing an automatic investment program
 Asking for help
W
hen you invest money, completing forms is unfortunately a require-
ment. But don’t despair. If you truly detest paperwork and mailing
things, you may be happy to know that you can now complete many applica-
tion forms online. In this chapter, I explain how to fill out fund application
and transfer forms.
Although the subject of this chapter may seem dreary, I explain some extra-
nifty things that perhaps you didn’t know you could do with fund investing.
And, unlike dealing with IRS tax forms year after year, fund paperwork isn’t
unpleasant to deal with. You won’t have much (if any) ongoing paperwork to
do, except for filing the taxes owed on mutual fund distributions held outside
of retirement accounts (the subject of Chapter 16).
Taking the Nonretirement Account Route
As I discuss in Chapter 8, you can purchase most of the excellent mutual
funds that I recommend in this book either directly from the mutual fund
company responsible for them or through a discount brokerage firm. Though
you see many similarities between mutual fund company and discount broker
applications, you also see that brokerage account applications are a different
type of animal than mutual fund company applications. I show you how to
handle both in this chapter.

262
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
Filling in the blanks: Application basics
In years past, prospective customers called the fund company on its toll-free
number and said, “Please send me your account application materials for
your (fill-in-the blank) fund.” Several days later, a packet arrived in the mail-
box with enough density and heft to make a great flyswatter! Most of the con-
tent was marketing propaganda to convince people to send gobs of money.
You had to hunt around for the document that said something like Account
Registration Form or New Account Application or Application.
Thanks to the Internet, now you can open fund accounts online. In the past,
although various fund companies allowed you to access and download
account application forms on their Web sites, you still had to print out the
application, sign it, and drop it in the mail. But today, electronic signatures
exist. E-signatures, as they’re commonly referred to, are now legally equal to
traditional pen-and-ink signatures on paper forms. You don’t literally sign a
form using your computer; you’re simply assigned a code that serves as your
very own e-signature. Fund companies ensure your account’s security by
requiring your Web browser to use sophisticated encryption technology and
by mailing another code to the address that you provide in your application.
Here are the potential benefits of completing an account application online:
 You can get your new account open much faster, which may come in
handy when you face a deadline for opening a particular type of account
(such as a retirement account).
 You can save time completing forms through the same company. Most of
the better fund-company Web sites remember your information when
you’ve completed one form, which allows them to precomplete common
portions of new forms when you come back to open more new accounts.
The following sections explain and show you how to complete the important
portions of a typical new account application for a nonretirement account (I
discuss the nuances of retirement account applications later in the chapter).
Account registration
In the account registration section (which usually comes first on an account
application), you’re asked to choose the appropriate box and enter the name
of the individual or organization that’s registering the account. Here are the
common types of account registrations:

 Individual or Joint Account: Choose this option if you’re opening the
account for yourself or for yourself and someone else jointly. Joint ten-
ants with rights of survivorship is generally the default classification for
jointly registered accounts and establishes the following conditions:
• The person you’ve jointly registered the account with can do
everything that you can do on the account, such as calling and
inquiring about account balances, performing transactions, and
writing checks. Neither party needs the other’s permission
(although it’s possible to establish the account so that both signa-
tures are required for check writing).
• Each account holder has an equal interest in the account.
• If you should die, the entire account balance goes to the other
person registered on the account without the hassles and expense
of going through probate.
A rarely used option is to register the account as tenants in common. To
arrange a tenancy in common, you can have a legal document drawn up
specifying that each tenant owns a certain percentage of the account.
Unlike shares of ownership for joint tenants with rights of survivorship,
the shares for tenants in common need not be equal. If you die, the
account is restricted; your share of the account is distributed to the
person whom you selected to receive it, and the surviving account
holder is required to set up a new account for his share.
If you go to the trouble of setting up the account registration as tenants
in common, just write in the margin in this section of the form that you
want the account set up this way, or attach a short letter that presents
the same request. The fund company doesn’t want or need to see the
legal document (which you should keep with your will) or other impor-
tant personal financial documents.
 Gift or Transfer to Minor: Use this section if you want to open (register)
an account in your child’s name. As the parent, you’re the custodian,
your child the minor. Your state’s name is requested in this section
because two different sets of laws govern custodial accounts: the
Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) and the Uniform Transfer to Minors
Act (UTMA). States allow one or the other. Your child is legally entitled
to the money in the account when she reaches the so-called age of
majority (which is, depending on the state, between 18 and 21). Read
Chapter 3 before putting money into an account in your child’s name.
 Trust: Generally, you know if you have a trust because you’re either the
one who sets it up or you’re the recipient of assets that are part of a
trust. There are many types of trusts. For example, some folks, by the
time they get older, have set up a living trust that allows their assets to
pass directly to heirs without going through probate. If you have a trust
agreement, provide the pertinent details at this point in the form.
263
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

 Corporation, Partnership, or Other Entity: If you want to open a mutual
fund account for your corporation or local Rotary Club, use this section.
You need a taxpayer ID number. If your organization doesn’t have one,
call the IRS at 800-829-3676 (800-TAX-FORM) and request Form SS-4, or
visit their Web site at www.irs.gov.
Your personal information
This part’s easy. You may be wondering why some fund companies ask for
your phone numbers, the name of your employer, and your occupation. The
company wants your phone numbers so they can call you regarding account
issues. The rest of this information is partly required by fund regulators and
partly just desired by the fund company for their own market research; they
want to know about the people who invest in each of their specific types of
funds. If you want to maintain your privacy, you can skip the employment
stuff and the fund company will still happily open your account. (Note: The
fund company doesn’t share this information with the IRS.)
Your investment
The investment section is where you tell ’em which fund you want. But be
careful in this section. Most account applications offer a menu of fund
choices, so you need to double-check that you’ve selected the fund that you
have your heart set on.
To ensure that the money is deposited into the correct fund, check the
account statement that you receive when you open your account. Although it
doesn’t happen often, fund companies (and you!) occasionally make mistakes.
Your method of payment
After you open an account, you’re faced with the task of getting money into
your new account — you need it in order to buy some mutual funds, which is
the reason you opened the account in the first place! You can put money into
your account by mailing the fund company a check, having funds wired or
electronically transferred from an existing bank account, or transferring
funds from an account you previously opened at the fund company.
Generally, you need to send a check to open a mutual fund account. If this is
the case, make the check payable to the fund (if the company numbers its
funds, include the fund number next to the fund company name). Don’t
worry about someone stealing the check or a mail thief cashing it (remember
that you make the check payable to the fund).
After you open a money market fund account, you can do exchanges into
other accounts by telephone. Exchanges save you the hassle of filling out
more application forms every time you open new funds at the same company
264
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

(although different account types, such as IRAs, do require separate account
applications). Make sure that you have another source of cash during the
time it takes for the fund company to open your money fund and send your
first check. Sometimes people send in almost all their money and then, in a
few days, they wish that they’d kept some back.
Dividend and capital gains payment options
Most mutual funds make dividend and capital gains payments. If you’re not
living off this income, it’s usually best to reinvest these payments by purchasing
more shares in the fund. To reinvest, just check the box indicating that you
want to have the fund’s dividend and capital gains reinvested. This strategy
eliminates the hassle of receiving and cashing checks often and then figuring
out where to invest the money (but it doesn’t change the taxability of a fund’s
distributions).
On the other hand, if you’re retired, for example, you may want the distribu-
tions on your fund sent to you so that you can spend it on whoopee cushions
and sports cars. Most fund companies offer you the option of having the
money from distributions sent to you as a check through the mail. Or, even
better, the fund can electronically transfer the money to your bank account.
This method gets you the money quicker and requires less mail to open and
fewer checks to sign and schlep to the bank.
Wiring and automatic investment options
You’re not required to have wiring and automatic investment options on an
account. Wire redemption allows you to request that money be wired to your
bank account. Use this feature if you might unexpectedly need money fast.
Your mutual fund and your bank may charge for wiring services, though, so
don’t use wiring as your regular way to move money to and from your bank.
If you want to make regular deposits into one of your fund accounts, you can
select an automatic investment plan, which authorizes the fund to instruct
your bank to send a fixed amount on a particular day of the month (or some
other time period). You can do the same in reverse by withdrawing money on
a regular schedule, too. The minimum amount should be stated on the form.
Special purchases and redemptions is an electronic funds transfer — it’s like a
paperless, electronic check that allows you to move money back and forth
between your bank and mutual fund accounts. This process usually takes a
full two days to complete because, like a check, the transaction is cleared
through the Automated Clearing House (wiring can typically be done the same
day or next day). The fund and the bank shouldn’t charge for the service
because it’s just like a check (which means that it costs less than wiring).
265
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

To establish these additional services, remember to attach a preprinted
deposit slip or blank check (write “VOID” in large letters across the front of
the check so that no one else can use it).
Check-writing option
Check writing is a useful feature to sign up for on a money market fund. But
most money funds limit check writing to amounts of $250 or more.
I don’t recommend establishing check writing for bond funds because each
time you write a check on a bond fund, you must report the transaction on
your annual tax return (because the price of the bond fund fluctuates, you’ll
be selling at different prices than you bought). Keep enough cash in your
money fund and write your checks from there.
Buying into discount brokerage accounts
As I discuss in Chapter 8, discount brokerage firms and the discount broker-
age divisions of fund companies offer you the opportunity, through a single
account, to invest in hundreds of funds from many fund companies.
Brokerage firms are different from mutual fund companies. The first differ-
ence is that brokerage accounts allow you to hold and trade individual secu-
rities, such as stocks and bonds. This feature is handy if you hold individual
securities and want them in the same account as your mutual fund.
Another difference is that, in addition to offering mutual funds, brokerage
accounts allow you to invest in riskier types of securities and engage in
riskier investing strategies. Many brokerage firms, for example, allow invest-
ing in options (see Chapter 1), which are volatile, short-term, gambling-type
instruments. Keep your distance.
Most of the sections on a typical brokerage application are the same as those
on a mutual fund application, which I describe in the “Filling in the blanks:
Application basics” section, earlier in the chapter. The following sections
explain the main differences that may give you cause for pause.
Borrowing money so you can invest: Margin accounts
Brokers offer (and sometimes encourage) margin trading. Just as you can pur-
chase a home and borrow some money to finance the purchase when you
can’t afford to pay all cash, you can do the same with your investments.
When you buy a home, most banks require that you make a 10 to 20 percent
down payment on the purchase price. When you invest in a brokerage
account, you need to make a 50 percent down payment.
266
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Buying investments on margin isn’t something I recommend because
 You pay interest. Although the rate is competitive — nothing approaching
the worst credit cards — it still isn’t cheap. Typically, the rate is a bit
more than you’d pay on a fixed-rate mortgage on your home.
 If your investments fall significantly in value (25 to 30 percent), you get a
margin call, which means that you need to add more cash to your
account. If you can’t or don’t, you must sell some investments to raise
the cash. Of course, if your securities’ prices increase in value, you earn
money not only on the down payment you invested but also on the bor-
rowed money invested. (That’s called leverage.)
 You can’t invest on margin in retirement accounts, which is where you
should be doing most of your investing (because of the tax benefits).
Borrowing on margin can be useful as a short-term source of money. Suppose
you need more short-term cash than you have in a money fund. Instead of
selling your investments, just borrow against them with a margin loan. This
move makes sense especially if you’d have to pay a lot of tax on profits were
you to sell appreciated investments.
267
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms
Opening multiple fund accounts quickly
Some of the larger fund companies have a
number of good funds, so you may want to
invest in multiple funds at one company.
Through a comprehensive account application
form, most fund companies let you invest in mul-
tiple funds without having to complete a moun-
tain of paperwork. However, not all fund
companies offer these comprehensive account
application forms. You’re supposed to fill out a
separate application for each fund you plan to
invest in, but you don’t need to. Avoid this paper-
work nightmare in several ways:
 Establish a money market fund first. Then you
may do exchanges by phone into any other
funds you want. When you call to order the
money fund materials, ask for the prospec-
tuses for the other funds that you’re inter-
ested in. When you do telephone exchanges,
fund companies are required by the SEC to
ask if you’ve received the prospectus before
they’ll allow an exchange.
 Attach a separate piece of paper to one
application with instructions to the fund
company to open “identically registered
accounts in the following funds” (but first
make sure the company allows this short-
cut). Next to each fund name, list the
amount you want to invest. Don’t forget to
sign the page and attach your check.
 Open a discount brokerage account
through a firm, such as TD Ameritrade or
Fidelity, that allows telephone exchanges
(see the “Buying into discount brokerage
accounts” section).

Getting personal
Brokerage applications ask for financial information that most people con-
sider to be confidential, such as your driver’s license number, income, and
net worth. “Why,” you may rightfully ask, “are they being so nosy? Do they
really need to know this stuff?”
All brokerage firms ask for this kind of information (although different firms
ask different questions) because of the so-called know-your-customer rule
imposed by regulators. Because brokerage accounts allow you to do some
risky stuff, regulators believe that brokerage firms should make at least a
modest effort to determine whether their clients know enough and have a
sufficient financial cushion to make riskier financial investments.
Make your paperwork go faster and your investing less dangerous and skip
this! If you’re not signing up for the risky account features, such as margin
and options trading, the brokerage firm doesn’t need to know this info.
Accessing your cash: Checks and debit cards
Some brokerage accounts offer additional features, such as check writing and
a debit card, that allow more convenient ways for you to access the money in
your account. The only challenge is that you may have to request a different
application for the special type of account that offers these features.
Debit cards look just like credit cards and are accepted by retailers the same
way as credit cards. But, when you use your debit card, the money is gener-
ally sucked out of your account within a day or two. Using debit cards
instead of credit cards may simplify your financial life by saving you from
writing a check every month to pay your credit card bill. However, you give
up the float — the free use, until the credit card bill is due, of the money that
you owe — because debit cards quickly deduct the money owed from your
account. You may also use your debit card to obtain cash from ATMs.
As with a money market mutual fund account, you may obtain checks to
write against the money market fund balance in your brokerage account.
Don’t forget to complete the signature card for check writing.
Some brokerage accounts come with even more features that make organizing
your finances easier, such as unlimited check writing and a bill payment ser-
vice. These services cost more money, and you may have to put more money
into your account, pay a monthly service fee, and/or pay an annual account
fee if you don’t place a specified minimum number of trades per year.
Transferring your dough into a new brokerage account
You may have cash, securities, and most mutual funds transferred into a new
brokerage account that you establish. (If you haven’t opened an account yet,
you also need to complete an account application form.) All you need is an
268
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

account transfer form for the brokerage firm into which you’re transferring
the assets. Using one of these forms saves you the hassle of contacting bro-
kerage firms, banks, and other mutual fund companies from which you want
to move your money. Using this form also saves you the bother and risk of
taking possession of these assets. The following sections contain the info you
need to know to complete a typical brokerage account transfer form.
Information about your (new) brokerage account
Your new brokerage firm needs to know into which account you want your
assets transferred, so in this section you fill in your name as you have it on
your account application or as it’s currently listed on your account, if it’s
already open. If you’re sending in your account application with this transfer
form, you won’t have an account number yet, so just write NEW in the space
for your account number.
Information about the account you’re transferring
Here, you write the name of the brokerage, bank, or fund company that holds
the assets you want to transfer and enter the account number of your
account there. You may see the phrase Title of account; this simply means
your name as it appears on the account you’re transferring.
Brokerage account transfers
In this section, you indicate whether you want to transfer your entire broker-
age account — which makes your administrative life easier by eliminating an
account — or only a part of it. (Another advantage of closing accounts at
firms such as Prudential, Merrill Lynch, and so on is that they generally
charge an annual account fee.)
If you’re doing a partial transfer, you generally just list the assets that you
want to transfer — for example, IBM stock — and the number of shares, such
as “50” or “All.” With partial transfers that include the transfer of mutual
funds, you may have to go through the hassle of completing a transfer form
for each company whose funds you’re moving. You may have to list these
funds in a separate section.
You generally won’t be able to transfer (into your new brokerage account)
mutual funds that are unique (or proprietary) to the brokerage firm you’re
leaving. Funds that can’t be transferred typically include funds such as
Prudential, Merrill Lynch, and so on. If there are no adverse tax conse-
quences, you’re better off selling these funds and transferring the cash pro-
ceeds. Check out Chapter 15, which walks you through the issues to consider
if you’re debating whether to hold or sell a fund.
If you bought some of those awful limited partnerships, check with the dis-
count brokerage firm to which you’re transferring your account to see if
they’ll be able to hold them. Discounters will likely charge you a fee ($25 to
269
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

$50) to hold LPs, but many of the lousy firms that sold them to you in the
first place also charge you for the privilege of keeping your account open
with them. If the costs are about the same, I’d move the LPs to your new
account to cut down on account clutter. Another alternative is to speak with
the branch manager of the firm that sold them to you and ask that they waive
the annual account fee for continuing to hold your LPs there.
Mutual fund transfer forms
As I explain in the last section, you can only transfer certain companies’
funds into a brokerage account. For each fund you’re transferring, you typi-
cally list the fund name, your account number, and the amount of shares you
want transferred or sold.
If you’re transferring the fund as is instead of selling it, tell the new firm
whether you want the fund’s dividends and capital gains distributions rein-
vested. Unless you need this money to live on, I’d reinvest it.
Bank, savings and loan, or credit union transfers
A potential complication occurs when you’re transferring money from a cer-
tificate of deposit. In that case, send in this form several weeks before the CD
is set to mature.
If you’re like most people and do things at the last minute, you may not think
about transferring a CD until the bank notifies you by mail days before it’s
due to mature. Here’s a simple way around your inability to get the transfer
paperwork in on time: Instruct your bank to place the proceeds from the CD
into a money market or savings account when the CD matures. Then you can
have the proceeds from the CD transferred whenever you like.
Attach your account statement!
Don’t forget to attach a copy of a recent statement of the account you’re
transferring as well as your account application if you haven’t previously
opened an account. At this point . . . you’re done! Mail the completed applica-
tion in the company’s postage-paid envelope and the transfer should go
smoothly. If you have problems, see Chapter 17 for solutions.
Heading South: Retirement Accounts
The applications for retirement accounts pose new challenges. The first part
of these applications is just like a nonretirement account application, except
that it’s easier to fill out. Retirement accounts are only registered in one
person’s name: You can’t have jointly registered retirement accounts.
Because mutual fund company retirement account forms are so similar to
brokerage account retirement forms, I cover only the differences here.
270
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

Retirement account applications
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) are among the most common accounts
you may use at a mutual fund company. This section explains what you need
to know to complete an IRA application. I also discuss the unique features of
the other common retirement accounts — SEP-IRAs and Keoghs, which are
used for the self-employed and small business owners. (For a detailed expla-
nation of the various types of retirement accounts, see Chapter 3.)
If you plan to transfer money from a retirement account held elsewhere into
the one you’re opening, before you start, pay attention to two details:
 Make sure that the retirement account type you’re opening (such as a
SEP-IRA) matches the type you’re transferring from (unless you’re
moving money from a 401(k) plan, in which case you’d be sending that
money into an IRA because you can’t open a 401(k) as an individual).
 If you want to transfer individual securities from a brokerage account,
you need a brokerage account application for the type of retirement
account you’re opening, not a mutual fund account application.
Register for an account
Account registration is an easy section to fill out — but make sure that, if
you’re transferring IRA money from another firm into your mutual fund IRA,
you list your name exactly as it appears on the account you’re transferring.
Otherwise, the firm that has your IRA may make a fuss, causing delays and
making you complete yet more forms. Note: Some applications ask for your
employer info. You don’t have to provide this if you don’t want to.
Choose your investment method
With an IRA, you can fund your account through three methods:
 Annual contribution: Select this option if you’re opening up a new IRA
with money previously held outside any kind of retirement account. You
must specify which kind of fund(s) you want to buy, how much you’ll be
contributing (in 2007, up to $4,000; $5,000 if you’re age 50 and older),
which kind of IRA you want to open (traditional or Roth), and which tax
year you’re making your contributions. You have until the time you file
your tax return (the deadline is April 15) to make a contribution for the
previous year.
 Transfer from an existing IRA: If you want to move an IRA from another
investment firm or bank into your new mutual fund IRA, select this
option. You also need to complete an IRA transfer form (which I explain
in the “What to do before transferring accounts” section). This option is
the best way to move an existing IRA because it presents the least hassle
and the fewest possibilities of a tax screw-up.
271
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

 Rollovers: Withdrawing the money from another IRA and sending it
yourself to the new account isn’t a good way to transfer your IRA. The
big danger is that if you don’t get the funds back into the new account
within 60 days, you’ll owe megataxes (income tax plus penalties).
If you’re rolling over money from an employer-sponsored plan, such as a
401(k), you can select the option that’s labeled something like
Traditional Rollover IRA. Tax advisers usually recommend that money
coming from your employer’s plan should go into a rollover account.
This choice allows you to someday transfer the money back into
another employer’s plan. Of course, you can choose investments in your
IRA, so this may sound like a silly reason to use a rollover IRA. An advan-
tage to establishing a contributory IRA, instead, is that you can add to it
with future IRA contributions. You can also merge it with other IRAs.
Don’t request that your employer issue you a check because your
employer must withhold 20 percent for taxes. If you want to roll the full
amount over — a wise move — you must come up with the missing 20
percent when you deposit the money into your IRA. Otherwise, you owe
tax and penalties on it. Establish your IRA and then instruct your
employer to send your money directly to that account.
Select your account service options
Most companies allow you to pick and choose from various service options
that come with your IRA. Some of them, such as telephone/computer
exchange, are automatically available with your account unless you specify
otherwise. You can usually also set up an automatic investment plan; contri-
butions to your IRA can be regularly deducted from either your bank check-
ing account or your paycheck itself. Such plans generally have lower
minimum initial investment requirements.
Designate your beneficiaries
In the beneficiaries section, you specify who gets all this retirement money if
you work yourself into an early grave or haven’t spent all of it by the time
you go. In most cases, people name their spouses, kids, parents, or siblings.
You may also list organizations such as charities that you want to receive
some of your money; providing their tax identification number and address is
a good idea (just include this info on a separate piece of paper).
If your children are under 18, they don’t have access to the money. A
guardian that you identify through your will controls the money. If you die
without a will, the courts will assign a guardian. Your primary beneficiaries
are first in line for the money, but if they’ve all crossed the finish line by the
time you do, your contingent beneficiaries receive the money.
272
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 

What to do before transferring accounts
If you have money in a retirement account in a bank, brokerage firm, other
mutual fund company, or in a previous employer’s retirement plan, you can
transfer it to the mutual fund(s) of your choice. Here’s a list of steps for 
transferring a retirement account. Note: If you’re doing a rollover from an
employer plan, please heed the differences indicated:
1. Decide where you want to move the account.
Check out Chapter 8 for help with this decision.
2. Obtain an account application and asset transfer form.
Call the toll-free number of the firm you’re transferring the money to (or
visit their Web site) and ask for an account application and asset transfer
form for the type of account you’re transferring to — for example, an
IRA, SEP-IRA, Keogh, or 403(b).
You can tell which account type you currently have by looking at a
recent account statement; the account type is given near the top of the
form or in the section with your name and address. If you can’t figure it
out on a cryptic statement, call the firm that currently holds the account
and ask a representative which type of account you have (just be sure to
have your account number handy when you call).
3. Figure out which securities you want to transfer and which you need
to liquidate.
Transferring existing investments in your account to a new investment
firm can cause glitches because not all securities may be transferable. If
you’re transferring cash (money market assets) or securities that trade
on any of the major stock exchanges, transferring isn’t a problem.
If you own publicly traded securities, it’s often better to transfer them as
is to your new investment firm, especially if the new firm offers discount
brokerage services. (The alternative is to sell them through the firm
you’re leaving, which may cost you more.)
If you own mutual funds unique to the institution you’re leaving, check
with your new firm to see whether it can accept them. If not, you need to
contact the firm that currently holds them to sell them.
4. (Optional) Let the firm from which you’re transferring the money
know that you’re doing so.
(You don’t need to worry about this step if you’re rolling money out of
an employer plan.) If the place you’re transferring from doesn’t assign a
specific person to your account, you definitely should skip this step. If
you’re moving your investments from a brokerage firm where you’ve
dealt with a particular broker, though, the decision is more difficult.
Most people feel obligated to let their rep know about the transfer.
273
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

In my experience, calling your representative with the bad news is usu-
ally a mistake. Brokers or others who have a direct financial stake in
your decision to move your money will try to sell you on staying. Some
may try to make you feel guilty, and some may even try to bully you.
Instead, write a letter if you want to let them know you’re moving your
account. It may seem the coward’s way out, but writing usually makes
your departure easier on both sides. With a letter, you can polish your
explanation, and you don’t run as much risk of putting the broker on the
defensive. Just say that you’ve chosen to self-direct your investments.
274
Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
Retirement plan applications for the self-employed
and small business: SEP-IRAs and Keoghs
If you’re self-employed or a small business
owner, consider opening a SEP-IRA or Keogh
plan. Why? Because most self-employed
people can generally make larger tax-
deductible contributions into these accounts
than they can into a regular IRA. (I discuss the
pros, cons, and contribution limitations of SEP-
IRAs and Keoghs in Chapter 3.)
SEP-IRA applications are virtually identical to
IRA applications, so just follow the instructions
for the IRA applications in the section
“Retirement account applications” (in fact,
some firms use the same application form). 
At those firms that use SEP-IRA applications
that differ from IRA applications, you may see
references to “Employer Contribution” as the
main difference. If you’re the business owner,
you, as the self-employed person, are your own
employer. If you have other employees, they
may be eligible for SEP-IRA contributions under
your plan (the maximum waiting period is three
years of service — a year of service is a year 
in which an employee earns $500). When
employees become eligible for contributions,
you set up accounts for them (with their names
on them) — they don’t establish accounts on
their own.
Keogh account applications are more compli-
cated. You must complete more paperwork, par-
ticularly if you set up the combined profit-sharing
and money purchase pension plans that I explain
in Chapter 4.
A few items appear on a Keogh application that
you won’t find on an IRA application. First, you
must supply an employer tax identification
number. If your business has obtained a tax
identification number from the IRS, plug that in.
Otherwise, most small-business owners use
their Social Security number. You also need the
name(s) of the plan administrator, the person(s)
responsible for determining which employees
are eligible in the plan, making contributions
into the accounts, and other tasks. If you’re a
sole proprietor, you’re the administrator. In
larger businesses, the administrator is the busi-
ness owner(s).
The Keogh plan documents also ask whether
your company operates, for tax purposes, on a
calendar year (which ends on December 31) or a
fiscal year (which has some other end date for
the year). Employees are eligible to participate
after they’ve completed two years of service.
Different plans define a year of service differently,
but most use 500 or 1,000 hours as the threshold.

But then again, telling an investment firm that its charges are too high or
that it sold you a bunch of lousy investments that it misrepresented to
you may help the firm to improve in the future. Don’t fret this decision
too much. Do what’s best for you and what you’re comfortable with.
Filling out transfer forms
Transferring retirement accounts generally isn’t too difficult. In most cases,
all you need to do is complete a transfer form. You can use a mutual fund
transfer form to move money that’s in a bank account, in another mutual
fund, or in a brokerage account. You may only use this form to move invest-
ment money that you want liquidated and converted to cash prior to transfer.
You’ll probably need to use one of these retirement account transfer forms for
each investment company or bank you’re transferring IRA money out of. If
you’re transferring individual securities (for example, stocks or bonds) or
want brokerage account features, you need a brokerage account transfer form
(and brokerage application forms). The following sections detail the unique
features that you should know about when completing a transfer form.
Account ownership and address
Be sure to list your name and address as it appears on the account you’re
transferring (look at a recent statement for that account). A discrepancy
between the two accounts often leads to an incomplete transfer.
If you’re transferring an IRA, look at a statement for the account you’re trans-
ferring and see which type of IRA you have. If you can’t figure it out, either
call that company and ask which of the three types you have or just leave it
blank, send it to the mutual fund, and let them figure it out from the state-
ment for the account that you’re transferring!
Where the retirement account funds will be invested
On most applications, you simply list the funds that you want the transferred
money invested in and the percentage of the money that is to go into each
(the percentages must total 100 percent). If you want to divvy up the money
into more funds than the form allows space for, list the additional funds on a
separate piece of paper and attach that sheet to the form.
Account being transferred
In this section of the transfer form, you tell the fund company where the
account you want to transfer is currently held. If it’s in another fund, list the
name of the fund (if you’re transferring more than one fund from the same
company, just squeeze those names into the space provided). If it’s money in
a CD that you’re moving, try to send your transfer form several weeks before
the CD is scheduled to mature.

Part IV: Establishing a Great Fund Portfolio 
Establishing retirement accounts quickly
Okay, so you procrastinate — you’re human.
Perhaps it’s April 14th or 15th and you want to
establish an IRA, but you need to do it, like, now.
You don’t have time to call a toll-free number,
wait for days to get the application in the mail,
and then wait even more days until the fund
company receives your check. All isn’t lost; get
yourself out of your pickle in several proven
ways:
 Visit a branch office: Companies such as
Fidelity and TD Ameritrade have numerous
branch offices. Call them to find the location
of the one nearest you. You may also be
near other companies’ main offices. Check
the Appendix of this book for contact infor-
mation. And believe it or not, some branch
offices are kept open late on tax day (some
larger firms even keep some of their
branches open until midnight).
 Visit a Web site: Most fund companies pro-
vide downloadable account applications on
the Internet — and increasing numbers of
fund providers allow you to complete these
applications online using e-signatures
(which I discuss in the section “Filling in the
blanks: Application basics”). Most likely,
however, you’ll have to print out and mail in
a form. And to get your money into your
newly opened account, you need to wire or
electronically transfer funds (or employ one
of the other strategies that I discuss in this
sidebar).
 Use an express mail service: Although not
a low-cost option, if you have a chunk of
money at stake, an overnight express mail
service may be worth the cost and save you
the time of going to a branch office.
 Go to your local bank: Establish your retire-
ment account in a savings or money market
type of account at the bank. Later, when the
dust settles and you have breathing room,
call your favorite fund company for its appli-
cation and transfer forms to move the
money.
Bank employees will more than likely try to
talk you into a CD or one of the mutual funds
that they sell. Skip the CD, because you’re
looking for a short-term and flexible parking
place for your retirement contribution. Bank
mutual funds tend to be commission-based
(load) funds and aren’t among the best
choices.
 File for a tax extension: If you’re opening a
non-IRA retirement account, such as an
SEP-IRA or a Keogh, consider buying your-
self more time by filing for an extension.
Although you must still pay any outstanding
tax owed by the April 15th deadline, filing for
an extension by using IRS Form 4868 gets
you four more months to file your Form 1040
and establish and fund your retirement
accounts. (Note: This extension doesn’t
apply to normal IRAs; for those, April 15 is
the absolute deadline.) Come the middle of
August and you’re still disorganized or oth-
erwise not ready to get the job done, you
can file for one last extension (Form 2688)
for yet another two months. October 15,
then, is your final deadline for making your
contribution.
If you’re self-employed, be aware that you
need to file the paperwork for a Keogh
retirement account by December 31 — no
extensions are allowed (although, as with
other retirement accounts, you do have
until the time you file your tax forms to fund
the Keogh). You can use the strategies I dis-
cuss in this sidebar to get the job done by
year’s end.

If you don’t get around to sending the form until right before your CD
matures, buy yourself more time by directing your bank to place the CD pro-
ceeds into a money market or savings type account from which you then can
do the transfer.
List the firm where your account is currently being held. You may see the
term custodian, which is simply the term for the company holding your IRA —
for example, First Low Interest Bank & Trust or Prune Your Assets Brokerage.
Some transfer forms ask for a specific department or person who handles
account transfers at your old firm. You probably won’t have a clue as to
which person or department has this responsibility. If you don’t, you can call
the company and try to find out. My advice: Don’t bother. Most funds don’t
burden you with having to find this information out — the funds should
already know from other transfers that they’ve done with that firm. If they
don’t, let them do the work to find out.
List the mailing address and phone number of the company where your
account is currently held, and also list your account number there. Attach a
copy of the statement for the account that you want to move. If you don’t
know the phone number, don’t worry — it isn’t critical.
Authorization to transfer your account
It’s a pain, but some firms that you’re transferring out of may require that you
burn a chunk of your day to go get your signature guaranteed at your local
bank (a notary doesn’t do this). Fortunately, most companies don’t require
this effort — but the only way to know for certain is to call and ask.
Investing on Autopilot
You may have noticed if you were reading earlier in this chapter that I men-
tion that some mutual fund applications include sections that allow you to
establish an automatic investment program. This program allows the fund to
electronically transfer money from your bank account at predetermined
times. You’ll probably need to complete a separate form to establish this ser-
vice if your fund company doesn’t have this option listed on its original appli-
cation, you didn’t fill out that part when you opened the account, or you’re
investing through a discount brokerage firm. (See the explanation in “Filling
in the blanks: Application basics” earlier in this chapter.)
If you have a pile of money sitting in a money market fund and you want to
ease it (dollar-cost averaging) into mutual funds, you can use the services
most fund companies and discount brokers offer for this purpose. They may
have separate forms to fill out or, even better, some companies allow you to
establish this service by phone after your money fund account is open (see
Chapter 9 for a discussion of the pros and cons of dollar-cost averaging).
277
Chapter 14: Applications, Transfers, and Other Useful Forms

If you’re investing outside a retirement account into fund(s) at different
points in time, here’s a hint: For tax recordkeeping purposes, save your state-
ments that detail all the purchases in your accounts. (Most mutual fund com-
panies also provide year-end summary statements that show all the
transactions you made throughout the year.)
If you don’t save your statements, it won’t be the end of the world — as long
as you’re investing through most of the larger and better fund companies,
which are able to tell you your average cost per share when you need to sell.
Average cost isn’t the only or even necessarily the most advantageous
method for you to use in determining your cost basis (see Chapter 16).
Finding Help for a Smoking Brain
If you get stuck or can’t deal with filling out forms — not even with the com-
fort and solace you get from this book — you have two safety nets:
 Call the fund company or discount broker and ask for help. (The
number is usually listed at the top of the first page of the application.)
Providing assistance is one of the many tasks those phone reps are paid
to do. If you get someone who’s impatient or incompetent, simply call
back and you’ll get someone else. (Should this happen with the compa-
nies recommended in this book, please write and let me know!)
If you’re dealing with a problem that can’t be solved during the first
phone call and you’re working with a representative on it, jot down the
person’s name and extension number. And don’t forget to ask which
office location he’s in. Some of the larger fund companies route their toll-
free calls to various offices, so you may not know where your call has
ended up unless you ask.
 Visit a branch office. Accessibility is one of the reasons that branch
offices exist. Not all companies have them (see Chapter 8).

accomplished what millions of people are still thinking about but haven’t
gotten off their blessed behinds to do (probably because they haven’t read

Now that you’ve started investing in funds (or even if you’ve been doing so

cally, you want to know how much return your funds are generating. You may
also be interested in evaluating funds you already owned before you and I
met, wondering if your prior holdings are greyhounds, basset hounds, or
mongrels.
In this chapter, I explain how to evaluate the performance of your funds and
decide what to do with them over time. I also explain why most of the state-
ments you get from fund companies make your head spin and leave you clue-
less as to how you’re doing.

282
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 
Deciphering Your Fund Statement
Every mutual fund company has its own statement design. But they all report
the same types of information, usually in columns. The following sections
present the type of entries you find on typical fund company statements,
along with my short explanations of what they all mean.
Trade date or date of transaction
The trade date (or date of transaction) is the date that the mutual fund com-
pany processed your transaction. For example, if you mailed a check as an
initial deposit with your account application, you can see which date the
company actually received and processed your check. If the fund company
receives your deposit by 4 p.m. EST, it will generally purchase shares that
same day in the bond and/or stock funds that you intended the check for.
Money market funds work a little differently than bond and stock funds. Money
market fund deposits don’t start earning interest until the day after the com-
pany receives your money. The delay is due to the fact that the fund company
must convert your money into federal funds.
Transaction description
In the transaction description column, you find a brief blurb about what was
actually done or transacted. In this column, you’re likely to see a few things:
 Annual maintenance fee charge: You may see this entry, although not
necessarily. (Try to pay these fees outside the account so that more of
your money continues compounding inside the retirement account.)
 Asset transfer: This term refers to a transfer of money into your retire-
ment account from another investment company or bank.
 Capital gains reinvest: Funds pay capital gains, too. In order to satisfy
the IRS, capital gains are specified, for example, as short-term capital
gains or long-term capital gains, for which different tax rates apply. (See
Chapter 16 for the reasons the IRS cares, and the consequences for your
tax return. And check out the “Capital gains distributions” section later
in this chapter for more on the subject.)
 Check-writing redemption: On the statement for a money market fund,
you may see such entries to show the deduction of a check that has
cleared your account (should you use the option of writing checks that
draw from the fund — like a checking account).

 Contribution: Often, new purchases for retirement accounts are referred
to as a contribution (such as 2007 IRA contribution).
 Dividend reinvestment: This term simply means that the fund paid a
dividend that you reinvested by purchasing more shares of that same
fund in your account. (See details in the section “Dividends” later in the
chapter if you’re not sure what a dividend is.)
 Income dividend cash: If you so desire, you may receive your dividends
as cash — the fund company can send a check to you or it can electroni-
cally deposit the money into your bank checking account.
 Phone exchange from so-and-so fund: For example, if you moved
money into a fund from your United States (U.S.) Treasury money
market fund by phone, this item may read phone exchange from U.S.T.
money fund.
 Purchase or purchase by check: If you mailed in a deposit, you may see
this notation.
Dollar amount
The dollar amount column simply shows the actual dollar value of the trans-
action. If you sent in a $5,000 deposit, look to make sure that the correct
amount was credited to your account. Fund companies calculate and credit
the appropriate amount of dividends and capital gains to your account.
There’s really no need to check these distributions. At any rate, I’m not aware
of a fund company making a mistake with these, other than possibly a delay
(a few days beyond the promised deadline) in crediting shareholder
accounts.
Share price or price per share
The share price (or price per share) column shows the price per share that
the transaction was conducted at. When you’re dealing with a no-load (com-
mission-free) fund, such as those that I recommend in this book, you get the
same price that everyone else who bought or sold shares that day received.
Money market funds always maintain a level price of $1 per share.
If you’re concerned that a load was charged, check with the company to see
the buy (bid) price and sell (asked) price on the day you did a purchase
transaction. If a load wasn’t charged, these two prices should be identical. If a
load was charged, the buy price is higher than the sell price, and the pur-
chase on your statement was done at the buy price.
283
Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio

Share amount or shares transacted
The share amount (or shares transacted) column simply shows the number of
shares purchased or sold in the particular transaction. The number of shares is
arrived at by default: The fund company takes the dollar amount of the trans-
action and divides it by the price per share on the date of the transaction.
For example, a $5,000 investment in a bond fund at $20 per share gets you
250 shares. You detail-oriented types will be happy to know that fund compa-
nies usually go out to three decimal places in figuring shares.
Shares owned or share balance
If money was added to or subtracted from your account, the share balance
changes by the amount of shares purchased or redeemed and listed in the
prior section, “Share amount or shares transacted.”
In one unusual instance, the number of shares in an account changes even
though no transactions have occurred: when a fund splits. If it splits 2 for 1,
for example, you receive two shares for every one that you own. This split
doesn’t increase the worth of the investments you own; the price per share in
a 2-for-1 split is cut by 50 percent.
Why do funds split? It’s a gimmick. In the world of individual securities, stock
splits are often associated with successful, growing companies; likewise,
mutual fund splits are usually trying to cash in on positive connotations. The
fund company wants potential buyers to think that the fund has done so well
that the company has split its shares in order to reduce the price; that way,
new investors won’t think that they’re paying a high price. But the high price
doesn’t matter because fund minimum investment requirements, not the
share price, determine whether you can afford to invest in a fund. (Reverse
splits can be done as well to boost a laggard fund’s price per share.)
Account value
Typically, on a different part of the account statement separate from the line-
by-line listing of your transactions, fund companies show the total account
value or market value of your fund shares as of a particular day — usually at
the end of a given month. This value results from multiplying the price per
share by the total number of shares that you own.
284
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Four out of five fund investors care about total account value more than the
other totals (at least, according to my scientific surveys of fund investors
that I work with!). So you’d think that the fund companies would list on your
statement how this value has changed over time. Well, many don’t, and that’s
one of the reasons why examining your account statement is a lousy way to
track your fund’s performance over time.
Some fund companies show how your current account value compares to the
value when your last statement was issued. This comparison sheds some
useful light on your account’s performance, but it still doesn’t tell you how
you’ve done over longer time periods (since you originally invested, for
example). See the later section, “Assessing Your Funds’ Returns,” for how to
determine your funds’ performance.
Interpreting Discount Brokerage 
Firm Statements
Discount brokerage statements may look a bit different from those that
mutual fund companies produce. In a discount brokerage statement, the port-
folio overview (summary of the value of each fund holding) and the transac-
tion details are usually listed in separate sections. This section breaks down
a typical brokerage firm statement.
Portfolio overview
A portfolio overview section on a brokerage account statement lists funds
from your various fund companies. As on a mutual fund statement, the
number of shares (quantity), price per share (latest price), and market value of
the funds held as of the statement date are listed.
Brokerage statements may use terms like long, which simply means that you
bought shares and you’re holding those shares. (You may — although I don’t
recommend it — actually short shares held in nonretirement brokerage
accounts. Shorting shares simply means that you sell the shares first, hope
that they decline in value, and then buy them back.) You may also see the
term cash or the letter C associated with your fund holdings. These items
mean that this fund is a cash holding (as opposed to one purchased with bor-
rowed money).
285
Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio

Account transaction details
An account transaction details section, which summarizes any transactions
occurring on your fund holdings since the last statement, often confuses
people because transactions seem to be repeated. The apparent repetition
occurs because of the silly accounting system of debits and credits that bro-
kerage firms use. For example, you might see a line item for one of your funds
that shows that 5.953 shares of the fund were purchased at $9.80 per share
for a total purchase of $58.34. Where did this odd amount of money come
from for the purchase? The next line on the statement tells you the fund paid
a dividend of $58.34. It’d be logical and more understandable if these two
lines were reversed, wouldn’t it? First the money comes in and then it’s rein-
vested into purchasing more shares!
Assessing Your Funds’ Returns
Probably the single most important issue that fund investors care about —
how much or little they’re making on their investments — isn’t easy to figure
from those blasted statements that fund companies send you. That is, it isn’t
easy to figure unless you know the tricks regarding what to look for and what
to ignore.
If you’ve just started investing in funds — or even if you’ve held funds a long
time — you need to realize that what happens to the value of your stock and
bond funds in the short term is largely a matter of luck. Don’t get depressed if
your fund or funds drop in value the day after you buy them or even over the
first three or six months. When you invest in bond and stock funds, you
should focus on returns produced over longer periods — periods of at least
one year and preferably longer.
Getting a panoramic view: Total return
The total return of a fund is the percentage change in the overall value of your
investment over a specified period. For example, a fund may tell you that its
total return during the year that ended December 31 was 15 percent.
Therefore, if you invested $10,000 in the fund on the last day of December of
the prior year, your investment is worth $11,500 after the year just ended.
This section explains the three components that make up the total return on
a fund: dividends, capital gains distributions, and share price changes. These
are the three ways you can make money in a mutual fund.
286
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Dividends
Dividends are income paid by investments. Both bonds and stocks can pay
dividends. As I explain in Chapter 11, bond fund dividends (which come from
the interest paid by bonds) tend to be higher than stock fund dividends.
When a dividend distribution is made, you can receive it as cash (which is
good if you need money to live on) or reinvest it into more shares in the fund.
In either case, the share price of the fund drops by an amount that exactly
offsets the payout. So if you’re hoping to strike it rich by buying into a bunch
of funds just before their dividends are paid, don’t bother.
If you hold your mutual fund outside a retirement account, the dividend dis-
tributions are taxable income (unless they come from a tax-free municipal
bond fund). When you’re ready to buy into a fund outside a retirement
account that pays a decent dividend, you may want to check to see when the
fund is next scheduled to pay it out. For funds that pay quarterly taxable divi-
dends (such as balanced or hybrid funds), you may want to avoid buying in
the weeks just prior to a distribution (which is usually late in each calendar
quarter).
Capital gains distributions
When a stock or bond mutual fund manager sells a security in the fund, any
gain realized from that sale (the difference between the sale price and the pur-
chase price) must be distributed to fund shareholders as a capital gain. (Gains
offset by losses — so called net gains — are what actually get distributed).
Typically, funds make one annual capital gains distribution in December. Some
funds make two per year, typically making the other one mid-year.
As with a dividend distribution, you can receive your capital gains distribu-
tion as cash or use it to buy more shares in the fund. In either case, the share
price of the fund drops by an amount to exactly offset the distribution.
For funds held outside retirement accounts, all capital gains distributions are
taxable. As with dividends, capital gains are taxable whether or not you rein-
vest them into additional shares in the fund.
Before you invest in bond and stock funds outside retirement accounts,
determine when capital gains are distributed if you want to avoid investing in
a fund that’s about to make a capital gains distribution. (Stock funds that
appreciated greatly during the year and that do significant trading are most
likely to make larger capital gains distributions. Money funds don’t ever make
these distributions.) Investing in a fund that will make a distribution soon
increases your current-year tax liability for investments made outside retire-
ment accounts. About a month before the distribution, fund companies
should be able to estimate the size of the distribution.
287
Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio

Share price changes
You also make money with a mutual fund when the share price increases.
This occurrence is just like investing in a stock or piece of real estate. If your
fund is worth more today than when you bought it, you have made a profit
(on paper, at least). To realize — or lock in — this profit, you need to sell
your shares in the fund. A fund’s share price increases if the securities that
the fund has invested in have appreciated in value.
Tallying the total return
After you’ve seen all the different components of total return, you’re ready to
add them all up. For each of the major types of funds that I discuss in this
book, Table 15-1 presents a simple summary of where you can expect most of
your returns to come from over the long term. The funds are ordered in the
table from those with the lowest expected total returns and share price
volatility to those with the highest.

Focusing on the misleading share price
You probably know someone who’s always got his head buried in the finan-
cial section of a newspaper, the part that reports on share prices of individ-
ual stocks and how much they’ve gone up or down since the day before. He’s
always checking on how his stocks are doing, and he’s either cheering or
groaning depending on the size of the numbers after the plus or minus sign.
Unfortunately, mutual fund share prices are also reported in many newspa-
pers and on various financial Web sites. I say “unfortunately” because all too
many fund investors, perhaps taking a cue from individual-stock owners, look
to daily or other short-term-oriented sources of fund pricing information.
If you follow the price changes in your fund(s) every day, week, month, or
other time period, you won’t know how your fund is doing. Looking at Table
15-1, you can see that share price is but one of the three components that
make up your total return. And to make matters worse for the share-price
hawks, another one of the three components — dividends — directly affects
share price. When a fund makes a distribution to you, you get more shares of
the fund. But distributions create an accounting problem because they
reduce the share price of a fund by the exact amount of the distribution.
Therefore, over time, following just the share price of your fund doesn’t tell
you how much money you’ve made or lost.
289
Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio
How often should I check on my funds?
I recommend that you don’t track the share
prices of your funds every day. It’s time con-
suming, nerve-racking, and can make you lose
sight of the long term. Worse, you’ll be more
likely to panic when times get tough. A weekly,
monthly, or even quarterly check-in is more than
frequent enough to follow your funds. I know
many successful investors who check on their
funds’ performance twice or even just once a
year.
If you do check your funds more often, one day,
usually soon after you talk with a friend and
mention how pleased you are with your fund’s
returns, you’ll receive a rude awakening. “It
dropped $1.21 per share!” That’s what one of my
clients said to me after noticing the price of one
of her international stock funds in December.
Guess what? The fund made a distribution that
reduced the price per share but increased the
number of shares. So she wasn’t losing money
after all.
If you follow your funds through the daily news-
paper and you see such a large price drop, look
again to see if any special letters are printed
after the fund’s name, such as x, which indi-
cates that a fund paid its dividend, and e for
payment of a capital gains distribution.

The only way to figure out exactly how much you’ve made or lost on your
investment is to compare the total value of your fund holdings today to the
total dollar amount you originally invested. If you’ve invested chunks of
money at various points in time, this exercise becomes much more compli-
cated. (Some of the investment software I recommend in Chapter 19 can help
if you want your computer to crunch the numbers. Frankly, though, you have
easier, less time-consuming ways to get a sense of how you’re doing.)
Figuring your total return
As I mention in the “Account value” section earlier in the chapter, fund com-
panies make determining your total return from the information they provide
on their statements almost impossible for you.
Regardless of the time period over which you’re trying to determine your
funds’ total return, here are the simplest ways to figure total return without
getting a headache:
 Call the fund company’s toll-free number or visit its Web site. The tele-
phone representatives can provide you with the total return for your
funds for various lengths of time (such as for the last three months, the
last six months, the last year, the last three years, and so on). Most fund
companies post similar information on their Web sites as well.
 Examine the fund’s annual and semiannual reports. These reports pro-
vide total return numbers.
 Keep a file folder with your investment statements. That way, you can
look up the amount you originally invested in a fund and compare it to
updated market values on new statements you receive. You can make a
handwritten table or enter the figures in the software I describe in
Chapter 19.
 Check fund information services and periodicals. Fund information
services and financial magazines and newspapers carry total return data
at particular times during the year. Some, such as The Wall Street
Journal, carry this info daily. See my favorite Web sites in Chapter 19.
If you’ve made numerous purchases in a fund, you may want to know your
effective rate of return when you also factor in the timing and size of each
purchase. The only way to make this calculation is with software. However,
you don’t need to know the exact rate of return for your overall purchases in
order to successfully evaluate your fund investments. Comparing your funds’
performance over various time periods to relevant performance benchmarks
is sufficient. (I explain how to do just that in the next section.)
290
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Examining online charts of mutual fund prices over time on financial Web
sites provides an inaccurate picture of a fund’s total return. The reason is
that most online charting services fail to correct for the effect of fund distrib-
utions (for example, capital gains and dividends). Take a simple example of a
fund that begins the year at $20 per share and in late December is at $22 per
share. Thus, it has increased 10 percent. However, further suppose it makes a
distribution of $2 per share and thus ends the year at $20 per share. With an
online chart, it would appear that the fund dropped sharply at year-end and
provided no return for the year when in fact shareholders were rewarded
with a 10 percent return. (Charts on fund company sites that show the
change in value of an investment in a particular fund correct for this problem
and do accurately show the returns of a fund over time.)
Assessing your funds’ performance
Whenever you examine your funds’ returns, compare those returns to appro-
priate benchmark indexes. Although many stock market investors may have
been happy to earn about 10 percent a year with their investments during the
1980s and 1990s, they really shouldn’t have been because the market aver-
ages or benchmark indexes were generating about 15 percent per year.
You should compare each mutual fund to the most appropriate benchmark
given the types of securities that a fund invests in. For the bond and stock
funds that I recommend in Chapters 11 and 12, I provide descriptions of the
types of securities that each fund invests in. The following sections offer a
brief rundown of the benchmark indexes you’ll find useful. (I present bench-
marks for the types of funds most people use for longer-term purposes, such
as retirement account investing.)
Don’t get too focused on performance comparisons. Indexes don’t incur
expenses that an actual mutual fund does although, as you may know,
expenses among funds vary tremendously. Remember all the other criteria —
such as the fees and expenses and the fund company’s and manager’s exper-
tise — that you should evaluate when you consider a fund’s chances for gen-
erating healthy returns in the years ahead (see Chapter 7).
Bond benchmarks
A number of bond indexes exist (see Table 15-2) that differ from one another
mainly in the maturity of the bonds that they invest in; for example, short-
term, intermediate-term, and long-term indexes.

Which total return figures are best 
for the long term?
Fund companies typically report fund total
returns in one of two ways. The absolute return
measures the total percentage increase from
the beginning to the end of the time period being
looked at. The annualized return measures the
average increase per year during the specified
time period. Over a five-year period, for exam-
ple, the absolute return of the Blue Chip Stock
fund may be 98 percent, which translates to an
annualized return of about 14.6 percent.
Don’t be fooled by a more impressive-sounding
absolute return. Remember, both numbers are
measuring the same real return. Beware of fund
companies that exploit the eye-catching quali-
ties of absolute return numbers to make them-
selves look good in their marketing literature:
200 percent, 300 percent! Sounds spectacular,
but it doesn’t mean anything unless the time
period and the performance of comparable
funds and benchmarks are taken into account.
If the time period is long enough, just about any
fund’s absolute return figure, especially if it’s for
a stock fund, is impressive looking, even if it’s
actually below average.
Annualized return numbers are much more
useful for comparative purposes. Because a
time factor — per year — is built into the
number, a glance at the annualized return gives
you a much better idea of how a fund has per-
formed and a much easier time comparing that
performance to similar funds for similar time
periods

Many more specialized indexes exist than those listed in Table 15-2; for exam-
ple, indexes for municipal bonds, treasury bonds, and so on. So if you’re look-
ing at these different types of funds, take a look in the fund’s annual report to
see which index they compare the fund’s performance to. But don’t assume
that they’re using the most comparable index.
U.S. stock benchmarks
The major U.S. stock indexes (see Table 15-3) are distinguished by the size of
the companies (large, small, all sizes, and so on) whose stock they’re track-
ing. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index tracks the stock prices of 500 large-com-
pany stocks on the U.S. stock exchanges. These 500 stocks account for more
than 70 percent of the total market value of all stocks traded in the U.S. The
MSCI 1750 index tracks 1,750 smaller-company U.S. stocks. The MSCI Broad
Market index tracks all stocks of all sizes on the major U.S. stock exchanges.

If you’re evaluating the performance of a fund that invests solely in U.S.
stocks, make sure to choose the index that comes closest to representing the
types of stocks that the fund invests in. Also, remember to examine a stock
fund’s international holdings. Suppose, for example, that a particular stock
fund typically invests 80 percent in U.S. stocks of all sizes and 20 percent in
the larger, established countries overseas. You can create your own bench-
mark index by multiplying the returns of the MSCI Broad Market index by 80
percent and the Morgan Stanley EAFE international index (which I discuss in
the next section) by 20 percent, and then adding them together.
International stock benchmarks
When you invest in funds that invest overseas, you gotta use a comparative
index that tracks the performance of international stock markets. The Morgan
Stanley EAFE (which stands for Europe, Australia, and Far East) index tracks
the performance of the more established countries’ stock markets. Morgan
Stanley also has an index that tracks the performance of the emerging mar-
kets in Southeast Asia and Latin America (see Table 15-4).

You should know that emerging markets are volatile and risky. As I discuss in
Chapter 12, diversified international funds that invest in both established and
emerging markets offer a smoother ride for investors who want some expo-
sure to emerging markets. More-diversified funds also aren’t as constraining
on a fund manager who believes, for example, that emerging markets are
overpriced.
If you do invest in the more-diversified international funds that place some of
their assets in emerging markets, remember that it’s not fair to compare the
performance of those funds solely to the EAFE index. So how do you fairly
compare the performance of this type of fund? Well, if an international fund
typically invests about 20 percent in emerging markets, then multiply the
EAFE return in the table by 80 percent and add to that 20 percent of the
Emerging Markets index return. For 1999, for example: 0.27(0.8) + 0.637(0.2) =
0.343, or 34.3 percent. With this computation formula, you can see how any
international fund that invested in emerging markets in 1999 couldn’t help but
look good in comparison to the EAFE index. (The numbers in Table 15-4 also
suggest why you shouldn’t be too impressed with an emerging markets fund
that boasted of a 50 percent return in 1999 — if it did, it was below average!)
The hard part is finding out the percentage of assets a fund typically has
invested in emerging markets. Some international funds don’t report the total
of their investments in emerging markets. For the international funds I recom-
mend in Chapter 12, I provide some general idea of the portion they’ve
invested in emerging markets. Also, you can peek at a fund’s recent annual or
semiannual report, in which the fund managers detail investments held for
each country.

Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio

Deciding Whether to Sell, Hold, 
or Buy More
Many curious investors often ask me, “How do I know when I should sell a
fund?” The answer is relatively simple: Sell only if a fund is no longer meeting
the common-sense criteria (which I outline in Chapter 7) for picking a good
fund in the first place. Stick by your fund like a loyal friend as long as it is
 Generating decent returns relative to appropriate benchmarks and the
competition
(Even one or two years of slight underperformance are okay if the fund’s
five- and ten-year numbers are still comparatively good.)
 Not raising the fees that it charges and not charging more than the best
of the competition
 Still managed by a competent fund manager
The only other reason to sell a fund is if your circumstances change. For
example, suppose that you’re 50 years old and you inherit a big pot of money.
You hadn’t been planning to retire early, but with oodles of money suddenly
at your disposal, maybe now you’re thinking that early retirement isn’t such a
bad idea after all. This change in circumstances may cause you to tweak your
portfolio so that you have more income-producing investments and fewer
growth investments. This section deals with two special situations that
require further thought and reflection.
Handling bear markets
No one enjoys losing money. Most people find it unpleasant and at times
stressful. If you follow my advice in the rest of this book, you know that I
advocate building a diversified portfolio of funds and investing for the long
term, not tomorrow. Eventually, you’ll suffer a down period. Anyone who was
investing in the early 2000s understands firsthand that stocks and stock
mutual funds can drop significantly. So for handling such bear (down) mar-
kets in your funds, here is my advice:
 Don’t watch your funds too closely. Tracking your fund’s prices daily or
even weekly is sure to make you a nervous wreck if you’re doing so
because you fear a market slide. Don’t dwell on daily news reports of the
latest stock market gyrations. Remember that you’re investing for future
years, not next week and next month.
296
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

 See the glass as half full, not half empty. When certain types of funds
that you own decline in value, don’t get depressed. If you’re still feeding
new money into purchases (or perhaps reinvesting distributions),
remind yourself that your next purchases will be at lower prices. If
you’re retired and not making more purchases, you surely have the
wisdom that good days and periods follow difficult ones. Be patient for
improvement.
 Look at your portfolio’s performance, not individual funds. The whole
point of diversifying is so that some of your funds may go up while
others are down. So, when some of your funds do decline, remember to
assess the performance of your entire portfolio, and you may be pleas-
antly surprised that things aren’t as bad as you may have thought.
 Buy value (and different assets) if you dislike volatility. Stock funds
that focus on value-oriented stocks (please see Chapter 12) tend to be
less volatile. You can also dampen the gyrations in your portfolio by
investing in different types of assets (bonds, real estate, and so on).
Dealing with fund company consolidations
The fund industry is increasingly competitive, and some fund companies
(usually those of the larger variety) swallow other (usually smaller) fund
companies. Such mergers can lead to problems, but you can steer clear of
them:
 Financial firms, including fund companies, have been known to put
deposits into the wrong account or to lose track of certain accounts
altogether. During the transition period, be vigilant about ensuring that
your account information, including recent transactions and current bal-
ances, is correct.
 The new parent company in a merger may jack up fees or make other
unfavorable changes to your fund. Use the straightforward criteria 
that I outline earlier in this section to determine what you should do
postmerger.
Tweaking Your Portfolio
Over longer periods of time, you may need to occasionally adjust your port-
folio to keep your investment mix in line with your desires. Unless you experi-
ence a major change in your circumstances, I advocate adjusting your
investment mix every five years (see Chapter 9). Suppose that at the age of
40 you invest about 80 percent of your retirement money in stock funds with
the balance in bonds. By the age of 45, you find that the stock funds now
297
Chapter 15: Evaluating Your Funds and Adjusting Your Portfolio

comprise an even larger percentage (maybe 85 percent) of your investments
because they’ve appreciated more than the bond funds have. You are also
appreciating (in age, that is) and should in fact be reducing your stock alloca-
tion as you get older.
Using the asset allocation guidelines in Chapter 9, you decide that at the age
of 45, you now want to have about 75 percent of your money in stock funds.
The solution is simple: Sell enough of your stock funds to reduce your stock
holdings to 75 percent of the total and invest the proceeds in the bond funds.
Don’t forget to factor in the tax consequences when you contemplate the sale
of funds held outside retirement accounts (see Chapter 16).
Trying to time and trade the markets to buy at lows and sell at highs rarely
works in the short term and never works in the long term. If you do a decent
job upfront of picking good fund companies and funds to invest in, you should
have fewer changes to make over the long haul.
If you have a good set of funds, keep feeding money into them as your sav-
ings allows. As your portfolio value grows, add a new fund or two to broaden
your overall mix. Holding a couple (or several) of each different type of fund
makes a lot of sense. (I cover the common sense of fund diversification in
much depth in Chapter 9.) Don’t end up with 50 funds though — you won’t
keep up with what they’re doing and reviewing their reports.

You invest in mutual funds to make money. But guess who starts licking
his chops when he hears about money being made? That’s right: good
ol’ Uncle Sam. And state governments, too. (In Chapter 15, I explain the differ-
ent ways that mutual funds can make you money: either through distribu-
tions (capital gains and dividends) or through appreciation. If the fund that
made the money is being held outside a tax-sheltered retirement account,
federal and state governments will demand a portion of your fund’s distribu-
tions and of your profits when you sell shares in a fund for more than you
paid for them.)
Once each year, the mutual fund companies or brokerage firms where you’re
holding funds send you one or more tax forms that tell you how much taxable
money you made on your mutual funds held outside of retirement accounts.
(Remember, you don’t need to file anything with funds held inside retirement
accounts.) Come April (or whenever you get around to completing your tax
returns), you must transfer the information on these fund-provided tax forms
to your income tax return, where you calculate how much tax you actually
owe on the money you made from your mutual funds.
If you cringed when you read the words tax forms, you’ve obviously battled
these ugly beasts before. I sometimes wonder if the people who write tax
forms come from another planet — that would perhaps explain their use of
what appears to be a nonhuman form of communication. But don’t despair. I
devote this entire chapter to helping you interpret the hieroglyphics on these
sometimes intimidating documents.

Just for toughing out this chapter, you get a few rewards. I show you how to
use a fund’s tax forms to help you discover whether your mutual fund money
is being invested in the most tax-friendly way. I also give you some tips on
reducing your tax bill if you have to sell some mutual funds.
Mutual Fund Distributions Form: 
1099-DIV
If you’re an employee of a company, you’re probably familiar with IRS Form
W-2, that little piece of paper that comes in late January or early February
and sums up the amount of money your employer paid you over the previous
year. You’re required to report this income on your income tax return.
Form 1099-DIV is similar to a W-2, but instead of reporting income from an
employer, it reports income from mutual funds that you hold outside of
retirement accounts. By income, I mean capital gains and dividend distribu-
tions, which I explain in Chapter 15.
Like the W-2, Form 1099-DIV should arrive in your mailbox in late January or
early February. You should get one for every nonretirement account you held
money in during the tax year. Call the responsible company if you don’t get
one for an account that you think you should. (And if you’re tired of receiving
these forms from so many fund companies, visit Chapter 8, where I explain
the paperwork-friendly benefits of consolidating your mutual fund holdings
into a discount brokerage account.)
Also like the W-2, a copy of each of your 1099-DIVs is sent to the IRS and your
state authorities, so don’t get any ideas about fudging the information on
your tax return.
Figure 16-1 is a sample Form 1099-DIV, which I use to walk you through the
form. First, notice that the distributions are divided into various boxes.
(Actually, most mutual fund companies display this information in columns,
but they’re still called boxes.) This division is done because different parts of
your distributions are taxed at different rates, and the IRS wants to know
what is what.
Jump into these boxes and see what you find. In the following sections, I dis-
cuss the boxes that pertain to mutual funds.

Box 1a: Total ordinary dividends
All types of mutual funds pay dividends, which account for all of a money
market’s return, most of a bond fund’s return, and part of a stock fund’s
return. Thanks to tax laws passed in 2003, dividends paid by stocks are now
taxed at the same reduced tax rate that applies to long-term capital gains,
which I discuss in just a bit. Stock dividends are now termed qualified divi-
dends and reported in Box 1b (discussed in the next section). Thus, Box 1a
only includes dividends from taxable money market and bonds that are held
by mutual funds.
Untrue to its name, however, ordinary dividends also include short-term capi-
tal gains distributions — profits from securities that the mutual fund bought
and sold within a year. These short-term capital gains are lumped together
with your dividend income because they’re both taxed at your ordinary
income tax rate.

Chapter 16: The Taxing Side of Mutual Funds

The distributions reported as ordinary dividends are taxed at your highest
possible rate: up to 35 percent on your federal income tax return depending
on your annual income. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, you don’t want to
see big ordinary dividends. You’d be better off with investments that don’t
produce so much taxable income. (Chapters 10 and 11 explain how to select
tax-friendly money market and bond funds.) For stock mutual funds, if you’re
seeing big ordinary dividends, your fund must be making a lot of short-term
trades. Outside of retirement accounts, regardless of your tax bracket, you
have no reason to own mutual funds that generate a lot of short-term capital
gains. Chapter 12 gives recommendations for tax-friendly stock funds.
Box 1b: Qualified dividends
Qualified dividends include dividends paid by corporations to their stockhold-
ers (stock dividends). If you’re in the 10 or 15 percent federal income tax
bracket, your tax rate for qualified (stock) dividends is just 5 percent. For those
in the higher federal tax brackets, the qualified dividend tax rate is 15 percent.
Box 2a: Total capital gains distributions
Because short-term capital gains are reported in Box 1a, this box would be
more appropriately called “Long-term capital gains distributions,” which are
profits from securities sold more than 12 months after their purchase. Long-
term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than regular income, taxable
money market and bond dividends, and short-term capital gains. The federal
tax rate on long-term gains is 15 percent for those in an ordinary tax bracket
of 25 percent or higher and 5 percent for those in the 10 or 15 percent ordi-
nary tax brackets.
You can count the lower tax rate on long-term capital gains as one more benefit
of the buy-and-hold investing strategy. Not only does this strategy typically
generate higher returns than short-term trading, but also for investments held
outside of retirement accounts, it’s gentler on your tax bill (see Chapter 9). The
tax relief and the potential for higher returns are why mutual funds that tend to
buy and hold their securities are preferable for nonretirement accounts.
Box 3: Nondividend distributions
You rarely see numbers in the nondividend distributions section of Form 1099-
DIV. This box is where funds report if they made distributions during the year
that repaid a shareholder’s original investment. Like the principal returned 
to you if a bond or CD you’ve invested in matures, this chunk of money isn’t
taxable.
302
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

For shares held outside of retirement accounts, these nondividend distribu-
tions factor into your computation of the gain or loss when the shares are
sold. For purposes of calculating any gain, if and when you sell these shares,
you must subtract nondividend distributions from the amount you originally
paid for these shares.
Box 4: Federal income tax withheld
If your funds report that federal income tax was withheld, that can be bad
news. It means that you’re being subjected to the dreaded backup withhold-
ing. If you don’t report all your mutual fund dividend income (or don’t furnish
the fund company with your Social Security number), your future mutual
fund dividend income is subject to backup withholding of 28 percent! To add
insult to injury, in the not-too-distant future, you’ll receive a nasty notice
from the IRS listing the dividends you didn’t report. You end up owing inter-
est and penalties.
Find out right away what’s going on here. Either you or the IRS could’ve made
a mistake. Perhaps you didn’t provide a correct Social Security number or
you’ve been negligent in reporting your previously earned taxable income to
the IRS. Fix this problem as soon as you can. Call the IRS at (800) 829-1040.
Don’t despair about the tax that your fund withheld. The withholding wasn’t
for nothing — you’ll receive credit for it when you complete your Form 1040
on the line “Federal income tax withheld.”
Box 6: Foreign tax paid
If you invest in an international mutual fund, the fund may end up paying for-
eign taxes on some of its dividends. The foreign taxes paid by the fund are
listed on Form 1099-DIV because the IRS allows you two ways to get some of
this money back. You can choose one of the following:
 Deduct the foreign tax you paid on Schedule A (the “Other taxes” line),
as long as you have enough deductions to itemize on Schedule A.
 Claim a credit on Form 1040 (“Foreign tax credit” line).
Because a credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the tax that you owe, the
latter move may save you more taxes — but it may also be more of a
headache because you may need to complete another IRS form, Form 1116,
which is a doozy. However, if the total foreign taxes you pay are $300 or less
($600 or less for a married couple filing jointly), you can claim the credit
directly on Form 1040 without having to fill out Form 1116.
303
Chapter 16: The Taxing Side of Mutual Funds

When You Sell Your Mutual Fund Shares
Besides distributions, the other way to make money with a mutual fund is
through appreciation. If the price of your shares moves higher than the price
at which you bought them, your investment has appreciated. Your profit is
the difference between the amount you paid for the investment and the
amount the investment is currently worth. For investments held outside of
retirement accounts, that profit is taxable.
However, you don’t actually owe any tax on the appreciation until you sell the
shares and lock up your profit. Then you must report that profit on that
year’s tax return and pay capital gains tax on it. Conversely, when you sell a
fund investment at a loss, it’s tax deductible. You should understand the tax
consequences of selling your fund shares and always factor taxes into your
selling decisions.
What’s confusing to some people about this talk of capital gains and losses is
that each year your fund(s) may have been paying you capital gains distribu-
tions (see the preceding section) which you also owed tax on. So you may
rightfully be thinking, “Hey! I’m being taxed twice!”
It’s true that you’re being taxed twice but not on the same profits. You see,
the profits the fund distributed, which resulted from the fund manager selling
securities in his fund at a profit, are different from those profits that you real-
ize by selling your shares.
You have no control over fund distributions. They happen at regular intervals —
at least once a year — whether you like it or not, and you must pay taxes on
them when they occur from nonretirement account holdings. Taxes on fund
appreciation, on the other hand, can be indefinitely delayed if you choose. As
304
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 
Get out last year’s tax return
With all the fuss and muss over mutual fund dis-
tributions, you should note how the rest of your
non-mutual-fund investments are positioned.
Although taxes aren’t everything, you may be
paying much more than you need to.
Look at your Form 1040 to see how much taxable
interest income you had to pay tax on. On Forms
1040 and 1040A, this figure goes on line 8a. If
you filed 1040EZ (don’t you just love that name?),
the figure goes on line 2.
Now find out the rate of interest (percent yield)
paid that generated this interest income. If it
came from money in a bank account, odds are
quite good that you could be earning more in a
money market mutual fund (see Chapter 10).

long as you hold the investment and don’t sell it, the federal and state govern-
ments can’t get their hands on the profit — one more advantage of buy-and-hold
investing. In fact, if you hold an appreciated asset outside of retirement
accounts, that asset can be transferred at your death to your heirs and the capi-
tal gain is eliminated for tax purposes. Of course, the other way to avoid taxes
on mutual fund profits is to hold them inside retirement accounts; then you
don’t owe taxes at all (until, of course, you start taking retirement withdrawals).
Introducing the “basis” basics
Suppose that you sell a mutual fund. In order to compute the taxable capital
gain or the deductible capital loss, you have to compute your fund’s tax basis.
Basis is the tax system’s way of measuring the amount you originally paid for
your investment(s) in a mutual fund. I say investments (plural) because you
may not have made all your purchases in a fund at once; you may have rein-
vested your dividends or capital gains into buying more shares or simply
bought shares at different times by sending the fund company additional
money. For example, if you purchase 100 shares of the It’s Gotta Rise mutual
fund at $20 per share, your cost basis is $2,000, or $20 per share. Simple enough.
But now suppose that this fund pays a dividend of $1 per share (so that you
get $100 in dividends for your 100 shares), and suppose further that you
choose to reinvest this dividend into purchasing more shares of the mutual
fund. The price of shares has gone up to $25 per share since your original
purchase, so the reinvested $100 buys you four new shares. You now own 104
shares, which, at $25 per share, are worth $2,600.
But what’s your basis now? Your basis is your original investment ($2,000)
plus subsequent investments ($100) for a total of $2,100. Thus, if you sold all
your shares at $25 per share, you’d have a taxable profit of $500 (current
value of $2,600 less $2,100 — the total amount invested or basis).
For recordkeeping purposes, save your statements detailing the purchases in
your accounts. Most mutual fund companies provide year-end summary
statements that show all transactions throughout the year. Thanks to their
computer systems, fund companies also should be able to tell you your aver-
age cost per share when you need to sell your shares. As I discuss in the fol-
lowing sections, using the average cost method isn’t necessarily the optimal
method to minimize your taxes.
Accounting for your basis
If you understand the concept of basis for your fund investments (see the
preceding section), you can put that understanding to work. Here I introduce
305
Chapter 16: The Taxing Side of Mutual Funds

you to the different ways that taxpayers commonly use (and that the IRS
approves) to calculate a basis when selling nonretirement account mutual
fund investments.
If you sell all your shares of a particular mutual fund that you hold outside a
retirement account at once, you can ignore this issue. (After reading through
the accounting options that the IRS offers, you’ll probably feel that you have
more incentive to sell all your shares in a fund at once!)
Be aware that after you elect one of the following tax accounting methods for
selling shares in a particular fund, you can’t change to another method for
the sale of the remaining shares. Regardless of the method you choose, your
mutual fund capital gains and capital losses are recorded on Schedule D of
IRS Form 1040.
Regardless of which tax cost accounting method you choose for your fund
sales, be careful not to overpay your capital gains tax when completing your
annual tax return. Remember that the maximum tax rate for long-term capital
gains (investments held more than 12 months) is 15 percent (5 percent if
you’re in the 10 or 15 percent federal tax bracket). Be sure to complete all the
relevant portions of IRS Form 1040 Schedule D.
Specific identification method
The first fund basis option that the IRS allows you to use when you sell a portion
of the shares of a fund is the specific identification method. Here’s how it works.
Suppose that you own 200 shares of Global Interactive Couch Potato fund (you
laugh — but there really was a fund with a name similar to this!), and you want to
sell 100 shares. Suppose further that you bought 100 of these shares ten years
ago at $10 per share, and then another 100 shares two years ago for $40 per
share. (To keep this example simple, I’m assuming that you didn’t make any
other purchases from reinvestment of capital gains or dividends.) Today, the
fund is worth $50 per share. (Being a couch potato has its rewards!)
Which 100 shares should you sell? The IRS gives you a choice. You can iden-
tify the specific shares that you sell. With your Global Interactive Couch
Potato shares, you may opt to sell the last or most recent 100 shares you
bought — or some combination of shares from each purchase that totals 100.
(Selling the most recent shares will minimize your tax bill because you pur-
chased these shares at a higher price.) If you sell this way, you must identify
the specific shares you want the fund company (or broker holding the
shares) to sell. To identify the 100 shares to be sold, use either or both of the
following ways:
 Original date of purchase
 Cost when you bought the shares
306
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

You may wonder how the IRS knows whether you specified shares before you
sold them. Get this: The IRS doesn’t know. But if you’re audited, the IRS will
ask for proof that you identified the shares to be sold before you sold them.
It’s best to put your sales request to the fund company in writing and keep a
copy for your tax files.
Although you can save taxes today if you specify selling the shares that you
bought later at a higher price, don’t forget (the IRS won’t let you) that when
you finally sell the other shares, you owe taxes on the larger profit. The
longer you expect to hold these other shares, the greater your chances of
earning more money when you sell (and thus owing more in taxes). Of
course, you always run the risk that the IRS raises tax rates in the future or
that your particular tax rate rises.
The “first-in-first-out” method
Another method of accounting for which shares are sold is the method the
IRS forces you to use if you don’t specify before the sale which shares you
want to sell: the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO means that the first
shares you sell are simply the first shares that you bought. Not surprisingly,
because most stock funds appreciate over time, the FIFO method leads to
paying more taxes sooner. In the case of the Global Interactive Couch Potato
fund, FIFO considers that the 100 shares sold are the 100 that you bought ten
years ago at the bargain-basement price of $10 per share.
The average cost method
Had enough of fund accounting? Well, unfortunately, we’re not done yet. The
IRS, believe it or not, allows you yet another fund accounting method: the
average cost method. If you bought shares in chunks over time and/or rein-
vested the fund distributions (such as from dividends) into more shares of
the fund, then tracking and figuring which shares you’re selling could be a
real headache. So the IRS allows you to take an average cost for all the shares
you bought over time.
If you sell all your shares of a fund at once, you use the average cost basis
method. You may also prefer this method when you sell a portion of a fund that
you hold. Because many fund companies calculate this number for you, you
can save time and possible fees paid to a tax preparer to crunch the numbers.
Deciding when to take your tax 
lumps or deductions
If funds held outside of retirement accounts increase in value, you won’t want
to sell them because of the tax bite. If, on the other hand, they decline in
value, you may not know whether to sell them and, thus, lock in your losses.
307
Chapter 16: The Taxing Side of Mutual Funds

So how do you decide what to do and what role taxes should play in your
decisions? As I discuss in Chapter 15, several issues can factor into your deci-
sion to sell a fund or hold on to it. Taxes are an important consideration. So,
what do you need to know about them?
Cashing in long-term gains and keeping taxes low
You do need to realize that taxes are important, but don’t let them keep you
from doing something you really want to do. Suppose, for example, that you
need money to buy a home or take a long-postponed vacation — and selling
some mutual funds is your only source of money for this purpose. I say go for
it. Even if you have to pay state as well as federal taxes totaling, for example,
20 percent of the profit, you’ll have a lot left over. Before you sell, however,
do some rough figuring to make sure that you have enough money to accom-
plish your goal. Remember, you pay far lower tax rates when selling at a
profit if you’ve held the fund for more than one year.
If you hold a number of funds, give preference to selling your largest holdings
(that is, the ones with the largest total market value) with the smallest capital
gains. If you have some funds that have profits and some with losses, you can
sell some of each, subject to IRS rules, in order to offset the profits with the
losses.
Selling for tax deductions and the famous wash sale rule
Some tax advisers advocate doing year-end tax-loss selling. The logic goes
something like this: If you hold a mutual fund that has declined in value and
you hold that fund outside a retirement account, you should sell it, take the
tax write-off, and then buy the fund (or something similar) back. (In fact, you
can employ this strategy at any point during the year, not just at year’s end.)
I don’t think that selling solely for taking a tax loss is worth the trouble, par-
ticularly if you plan on holding the repurchased shares for a long time.
Remember that by selling and buying back the shares, you’ve lowered your
basis, which increases the taxable profit after you sell the repurchased
shares (assuming, of course, that they appreciate). To find out about your
basis, see the section “Introducing the ‘basis’ basics,” earlier in this chapter.
Plus, if you sell a fund for a tax loss and buy back shares in that same fund
within 30 days of the sale, you can’t deduct the loss because you violated the
wash sale rule. The IRS won’t allow deduction of a loss for a fund sale if you
buy that same fund back within 30 days. As long as you wait 31 or more days,
no problem. If you’re selling a mutual fund, you can easily sidestep this rule
simply by purchasing a fund similar to the one you’re selling.
308
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Try not to have net losses (losses plus gains) that exceed $3,000 in one year.
Why? Because you can’t claim more than $3,000 in net short-term or long-
term losses in any one year. If you sell funds with net losses that total more
than $3,000 in a year, you must carry the excess losses over to future tax
years. This situation not only creates more tax paperwork, but also it delays
taking the tax deduction.
Looking at fund sales reports: 
Form 1099-B
When you sell shares in a mutual fund, you receive Form 1099-B early in the
following year. This document is fairly worthless because it doesn’t calculate
the cost basis of the shares that you sold. Its primary value to you is that it
nicely summarizes all the transactions that you need to account for on your
annual tax return. This form, which is also sent to the IRS, serves to notify
the tax authorities of which investments you sold so that they can check
your tax return to see if you report the transaction.
If some of the sales listed on your Form 1099-B are from check-writing
redemptions, stop writing checks on those funds! Keep enough stashed in a
money market fund and write checks only from that type of account. Money
market fund sales aren’t tax reportable because a money fund’s share price
doesn’t change. Thus, you get fewer tax headaches!
Getting help: When you don’t know 
how much you paid for a fund
When you sell a mutual fund that you’ve owned for a long time (or that some-
one gave you), you may have no idea of its original cost (also known as its
cost basis).
If you can’t find that original statement, start by calling the firm where you
bought the investment. Whether it’s a mutual fund company or brokerage firm,
they should be able to send you copies of old account statements. You may
have to pay a small fee for this service. Also, increasing numbers of investment
firms (particularly mutual fund companies) automatically calculate and report
cost-basis information on investments that you sell. Generally, the cost basis
they calculate is the average cost for the shares that you purchased.

Retirement Fund Withdrawals 
and Form 1099-R
Someday, hopefully not before you retire, you’ll need or want to start enjoy-
ing all the money that you’ve socked away into great mutual funds inside
your tax-sheltered retirement accounts. The following sections explain what
you need to know and consider before taking money out of your mutual fund
retirement accounts.
Minimizing taxes and avoiding penalties
Although many different types of retirement accounts exist (IRAs, SEP-IRAs,
Keoghs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and so on), as well as many tax laws governing
each, the IRS has declared one rule that makes understanding taxes on with-
drawals a little easier. All retirement accounts allow you to begin withdrawing
money, without penalty, after age 591⁄2. (Why they didn’t use a round number
like 60 is beyond me.)
If you withdraw money from your retirement accounts prior to age 591⁄2., in
addition to paying current income tax on the distribution, you also must pay
penalties — 10 percent of the amount of the taxable distribution at the fed-
eral level and whatever penalties your state charges. (You compute the
penalty on Form 5329 — “Additional Taxes on Qualified Plans [Including
IRAs] and Other Tax-Favored Accounts.”)
Exceptions to the early withdrawal penalty do exist: You’re allowed to make
penalty-free withdrawals before the age of 591⁄2 if any of the following condi-
tions apply:
 You’ve stopped working after you reach age 55 (whether by retirement
or termination).
 The withdrawal was mandated by a qualified domestic relations court
order.
 You have deductible medical expenses in excess of 7.5 percent of your
adjusted gross income.
310
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Early retirement account distributions are also exempted from a penalty if
they’re paid because of death or disability, paid over your life expectancy, or
rolled over to an IRA. Withdrawing money from an IRA for a first-time home
purchase (up to $10,000) or higher education expenses is also permitted.
Of course, you pay current income taxes, both federal and state, when you with-
draw money that hasn’t previously been taxed from retirement accounts. The
one exception is for withdrawing money early from the new Roth IRA accounts
for a home purchase — in this case, you don’t owe any income tax on the with-
drawn investment earnings as long as you meet eligibility requirements.

Issues to consider before making retirement
account withdrawals
Generally speaking, most people are better off
postponing withdrawals from retirement
accounts until they need the money. But don’t
delay if waiting means that you must scrimp and
cut corners — especially if you have the money
to use and enjoy.
On the other hand, if you have other money you
can use, tap those funds first. The longer your
retirement account money is left alone, the
longer it can grow without being taxed.
Suppose that you retire at age 60. In addition to
money inside your retirement accounts, you
have money available outside as well. If you
can, you’re generally better off using the money
outside of retirement accounts before you start
to tap the retirement account money.
If you’re not wealthy, odds are good that you’ll
need (and want) to start drawing on your retire-
ment account soon after you retire. By all
means, do it. But have you figured out how long
your nest egg will last and how much you can
afford to withdraw? Most folks haven’t. It’s
worth taking the time to figure how much of
your money you can afford to draw on per year,
even if you think that you have enough. Many
good savers have a hard time spending and
enjoying their money in retirement. Knowing
how much you can safely use may help you
loosen your purse strings.
One danger of leaving your money to compound
inside your retirement accounts for a long time —
after you’re retired — is that the IRS requires
you to start making withdrawals by April 1 of the
year following the year you reach age 701⁄2. If
you don’t, you pay a whopping 50 percent
penalty on the amount that you should’ve taken
out but didn’t. (Note: This requirement doesn’t
apply to the new Roth IRAs.)
It’s possible that because of your delay in taking
the money out — and the fact that it’ll have
more time to compound and grow — you may
need to withdraw a hefty chunk each year.
Doing so could push you into higher tax brack-
ets in those years that you’re forced to make
larger withdrawals.
If you want to plan how to withdraw money from
your retirement accounts in order to meet your
needs and minimize your taxes, some of the
larger mutual fund companies that I recommend
in this book have resources that can help you
do the calculations. You can also hire a tax
adviser to help. If you have a lot of money in
retirement accounts, as well as the luxury of not
needing the money until you’re well into retire-
ment, tax planning will likely be worth your time
and money.

Making sense of Form 1099-R for IRAs
If you receive a distribution from your mutual fund IRA, the mutual fund com-
pany or brokerage firm where you hold your funds will report the distribution
on Form 1099-R (see Figure 16-2). These distributions are taxable unless you
made nondeductible contributions to the IRA (a situation I cover momentarily).
Here’s a rundown of the relevant boxes on your 1099-R:
 Box 1, Gross distribution: The amount of money that you withdrew
from your IRA. Make sure that this figure is correct: Check to see if it
matches the amount withdrawn on your IRA account statement. This
amount is fully taxable if you’ve never made a nondeductible contribution
to an IRA — that’s an IRA contribution in which you didn’t take a tax
deduction and, therefore, filed Form 8606 (“Nondeductible IRA
Contributions, Distributions and Basis”).
 Box 2a, Taxable amount: The taxable amount of the IRA distribution.
However, the payer of an IRA distribution doesn’t have enough informa-
tion to compute whether your entire IRA distribution is completely tax-
able or not. Therefore, if you simply enter this amount on your tax
return as being fully taxable, you’ll overpay on your taxes if you’ve made
nondeductible contributions to your IRA. If you made nondeductible
contributions, compute the nontaxable portion of your distribution on
Form 8606, which you need to attach to your annual tax return.

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Withdrawing from non-IRA accounts
Retirement account withdrawals from non-IRA accounts — such as 401(k),
SEP-IRA, or Keogh plans — are taxed depending on whether you receive them
in the form of an annuity (paid over your lifetime) or a lump sum. The amount
you fill in on your 1040 tax return is reported on a 1099-R that you receive
from your employer or another custodian of your plan, which may include an
investment company, such as a mutual fund company or discount broker.
If you didn’t pay or contribute to your employer’s retirement plan, or if your
employer didn’t withhold part of the cost from your pay while you worked,
then the amount you receive each year is fully taxable. The amount that you
contributed and for which you received a deduction — such as contributions
to a 401(k), SEP-IRA, or Keogh — isn’t considered part of your cost.
If you made nondeductible contributions to your retirement plan or contribu-
tions that were then added to your taxable income on your W-2, you aren’t
taxed when withdrawing these contributions because you’ve already paid tax
on that money. The rest of the amount you receive is taxable.
For information on how to compute the amount that you owe tax on, pick up
Taxes 2007 For Dummies (Wiley), which I coauthored with Margaret A. Munro
and David J. Silverman.
Understanding form 1099-R for non-IRAs
You report non-IRA retirement account distributions on Form 1099-R, which
is the same one you use to report IRA distributions. Sometimes people panic
when they receive a 1099-R, and they intend to rollover their retirement
account money into a fund from, say, their employer’s retirement plan after
they leave their job. Don’t worry. You received this form because you did do a
legal rollover and, therefore, won’t be subjected to the tax normally levied on
distributions.
The following list highlights how some of the other boxes on distributions for
non-IRA retirement accounts come into play:
 Box 3: If the distribution is a lump sum and you were a participant in the
plan before 1974, this amount qualifies for capital gain treatment.
 Box 4: This box indicates federal income tax withheld. (You get credit
for this amount when you file your tax return.)
 Box 5: Your after-tax contribution is entered here.
 Box 6: Securities in your employer’s company that you received are
listed here. This amount isn’t taxable until the securities are sold.
313
Chapter 16: The Taxing Side of Mutual Funds

 Box 7: Your employer enters a code that explains the type of distribu-
tion you’re receiving and why you’re receiving it. (See the back side of
your Form 1099-R for an explanation of the code.)
 Box 8: If you have an entry here, seek tax advice.
 Box 9a: This amount is your share of a distribution if there are several
beneficiaries.

Common Fund Problems 
and How to Fix Them
In This Chapter
 Dealing with fund company representatives
 Moving money into and out of funds
 Fixing paperwork, online snafus, and other problems
E
stablished fund companies and discount brokerages have hundreds and,
in some cases, thousands of telephone representatives who field phone
calls and process stuff you send them in the mail. Most of the bigger and
better companies recommended in this book do a good job of training their
employees, so you should receive competent assistance. But keep in mind
that these people are human — that is, not perfect. Some are more compe-
tent and service oriented than others at getting the job done right the first
time with the proper attitude. Although I can’t guarantee that this chapter is
a page turner, it can help bail you out and soothe your nerves when you just
don’t know how to get a problem fixed.
Playing the Telephone Game
When you call companies to ask a question or express a concern, you may
end up speaking with someone who doesn’t know how to fix your problem,
gives you the runaround, or worse — gives you incorrect information. Here’s
what you can do to ensure that you get accurate solutions:
 Know the representatives’ limitations. Fund company reps are there to
provide assistance. Don’t depend on them for tax advice. (Most of the
larger fund companies have retirement account specialists who have
more detailed knowledge about tax issues relating to those accounts.)

 Talk to someone else. If you don’t get clear answers or answers that
you’re satisfied with, don’t hesitate to ask for a supervisor. Or you can
simply call back on the toll-free line, and you’re sure to get another rep.
This method is a proven way to get a second opinion to make sure that
the first person knew what he was talking about.
 Take names and notes for thorny problems. If you’re dealing with a
problem that could cost you big bucks if not properly solved, take notes
of your conversation. Write down the name of the representative you
spoke to, the office she’s located in, and her telephone extension. That
way, you have some proof of your good efforts to fix things when you
need to complain to or are summoned by a higher authority (for exam-
ple, a supervisor, the IRS, and so on). E-mail or a written letter can be
effective ways to document your problems and concerns although some
companies don’t provide e-mail addresses.
 Visit the fund company’s Web site. The larger fund companies have
extensive Web sites that are equipped with good search capabilities.
(See the Appendix for the addresses of the fund companies.)
Trouble-shooting Bungled Transactions
With all the sound-alike fund names, you can mistakenly have your money
deposited into the wrong fund at some firms. That’s why it’s a good idea to
look at the statement that confirms your purchase to verify that the deposit
amount and the fund into which the money was deposited are both correct.
If the fund company makes a mistake, they should cheerfully fix the problem.
(They may need to do a bit of research first.) They should be willing to credit
the correct amount to the fund you requested as of the date the money was
originally received.
With increasing numbers of fund investors conducting transactions online,
I’m hearing about more problems with such trades. Don’t get me wrong —
trading online is a fine thing to do and the vast majority of transactions occur
without a hitch. However, accidentally duplicating an online trade is a good
example of a common mistake.
If you make a mistake trading online (or by phone), get on the phone and
request help. Ask for a supervisor if frontline employees are unhelpful. Don’t
accept a response such as, “We can’t correct online trades.”

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Specifying Funds to Buy 
at Discount Brokers
When you invest through most mutual fund companies, their account appli-
cation and other forms allow you to indicate what fund(s) you want to make
your deposit into. Not so at discount brokerage firms.
If you want your deposit to a discount brokerage to be immediately invested
into a particular fund or funds, write out your instructions and send them in
with your deposit. For example, if you mail in $4,000 for an IRA deposit to a
discount brokerage firm and you want the money divided between, say, the
Fairholme Fund (FAIRX) and the Dodge & Cox International fund (DODFX),
Figure 17-1 shows you how to word the letter.
Note the last sentence in the figure is a reference about what to do with divi-
dends and capital gains distributions. Try to be as precise as possible with
the fund names. The ultimate in precision for a broker is the fund’s unique,
five-letter trading symbol (three letters for exchange-traded funds).
Making Deposits in a Flash
Maybe you have an account open and just need to feed it in a hurry. Most
often this happens when you need to fund a retirement account, but this situ-
ation may also happen if you’re on the verge of overdrawing an account by
writing a check.
Dear Sir or Madam:
Enclosed please find a check in the amount of $4,000 that I would like
invested in my IRA account as a 2007 contribution (reference your account
number or specify if new application is attached) as follows:
$3,000 into Fairholme Fund (FAIRX)
Please reinvest dividends and capital gains distributions.
Thanks a million,
$1,000 into Dodge & Co. International (DODFX)

Chapter 17: Common Fund Problems and How to Fix Them

If you need to make a deposit in a flash, you basically have the three following
options:
 Write a check. You can stop by and deposit it at the company’s local
branch office if you’re dealing with a company with a branch location
near you.
 Wire the money from your bank account. If the fund company isn’t in
your neighborhood, don’t despair. However, note that wiring usually
costs money on both ends.
After you’ve set up the wiring feature on your fund account (see Chapter
14), call your fund company to see what info you need to provide to
your bank in order for the wire to be correctly sent. This info usually
includes
• The name of the bank your fund uses for wires
• The bank’s identification number (the nine-digit ABA number)
• The title and account number of the fund company’s account at
that bank
• Your name as it appears on your fund account
• The name of the fund account
• Your own account number
If you don’t have the wiring feature established on your account, estab-
lishing this feature takes some time because you must request, fill out,
and mail a special form.
 Electronically transfer the funds. Electronic funds transfer, which is like
a paperless check, usually takes a day longer than a wire, but it’s free.
Simply call your fund company and say how much money you want to
move. As with wiring, if you don’t have this feature set up, you can
establish it by requesting and filling out a form from the fund company.
Verifying Receipt of Deposits
When you send money to a fund company, how do you know if the fund com-
pany received your money? Unlike when you use a bank ATM, you won’t get a
deposit slip with your transaction — at least, not right away. Fund companies
mail you a statement (usually the day after they receive and process the
deposit) that shows you the transaction. You can keep a log of deposits on
paper or with a computer program and check them off when you receive the
deposit statement, once a month, or quarterly.
318
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

If you can’t wait for the mail, you can call the fund company’s toll-free
number and verify receipt over the phone. Many fund companies have secure
Web sites and automated phone systems that allow you to check on stuff like
this quickly, without waiting for a live person to talk to.
Transferring Money Quickly
For nonretirement accounts, if you have a money market fund with check-
writing privileges, writing a check to get money is quick and simple and costs
nothing. Another option, which you can use on all types of accounts, is to call
the fund company and request a telephone redemption. The day after the next
financial market close, a check should be cut and mailed to you. If you need
the check faster than the mail service can get it to you, you can provide your
express mail company (for example, FedEx, UPS, or DHL) account number.
Some fund companies also allow you to pick up redemption checks at their
headquarters. Call to see whether they provide this service.
Banks and other recipients of checks from your account may annoy you by
placing a hold for a number of days on the funds from your checks. For
checks that you write yourself, the hold is understandable because the check
recipient has no way of knowing whether the money will be in the account
when the check is ready to clear. But if the check was issued by the fund
company, then the money has already been taken from your account, so the
check is almost as good as cash to recipients — they just need to wait a
couple of days for receipt of the funds.
Banks normally place up to a five-day hold on out-of-state checks. (Odds are
that your fund company clears checks through an out-of-state bank.) If a bank
doesn’t make the money available to you quickly, ask to speak to the branch
manager or some other higher-up. Gently remind him that you can move your
bank accounts to a less bureaucratic bank.
Wiring and electronic funds transfers are other alternatives that you may
prefer because you don’t need to wait for a paper check to clear. If you just
realized that you need money to close on a home purchase tomorrow, these
are your best bets. See the section “Making Deposits in a Flash” earlier in this
chapter for how these services work.
For retirement account withdrawals, you need to make requests in writing.
Perhaps you need to withdraw money before the end of December to meet
the IRS’s mandatory withdrawal requirements after age 701⁄2. The good news
here is that you don’t need to have received the funds before the end of the
year. As long as the distribution is made by the end of December, the IRS will
be satisfied.
319
Chapter 17: Common Fund Problems and How to Fix Them

Losing Checks in the Mail
Checks and other stuff can get lost in the mail. If you wrote a check and made
it payable to the fund company, you don’t need to stop payment. If you’re
depositing checks with your fund company that someone else wrote to you,
the check’s issuer may want to stop payment when you report to them that
the check is lost and you want it reissued, if they’re concerned that you
might cash it.
A bigger pain is having to redo account applications that you may have sent
with the check(s). If you do a ton of applications and transfer forms, you may
want to keep copies.
Registered mail and certified mail don’t eliminate the problem of lost mail.
They just indicate whether the mail was received. Don’t waste the money or
the time needed to go to the post office to use these extra mail services.
Changing Options after 
Opening Your Account
Perhaps now you wish you had check writing on your money market fund. Or
you want to establish a regular monthly investment plan so that money is
sent electronically from your bank account to some funds. How do you add
these features after you’ve opened an account?
Although you can add some features over the phone, most features, particu-
larly the ones that require your signature — such as check writing — can only
be set up through short forms that you request by phone. (Some fund compa-
nies allow you to add these account features via their Web sites, as I discuss in
Chapter 14.) Previously established options, such as reinvestment of divi-
dends, can be changed over the phone or via the fund company’s Web site.
Changing the registration of your accounts is more of a pain. A letter is gener-
ally required, for example, if you marry and change your name or want to add
your spouse to the account. A signature guarantee may be required — these
guarantees are provided by banks and brokerage firms. Don’t confuse this
requirement with getting something notarized, which is different.

Making Sense of Your Statements 
and Profits
Can’t understand your fund statement? Don’t know how much money your
fund is making for you? Welcome to a large and nonexclusive club. See
Chapter 15 for the full scoop.
If you want a tax, financial, or legal adviser — or a savvy relative — to help
you keep an eye on your investments, you can ask that she be listed on your
account as an interested party to receive duplicate statements. Simply write to
the fund company and include the accounts you want the interested party to
receive statements for and provide that person’s name and mailing address.
Changing Addresses
Normally, fund companies require that you make a change of address in writ-
ing, but over time more fund companies are establishing security procedures
that allow you to make a change of address by phone or via a Web site. The
safeguards include a requirement that you prove that you’re who you say you
are on the phone (give your mother’s maiden name and all that). The fund
companies also mail confirmations of the changed address to both old and
new addresses and don’t allow money to be transferred out to the address
for, say, 15 days to give the mail sufficient time to deliver confirmation of the
address change to both the new and old addresses.
Finding Funds You Forgot to Move
Every year, people literally throw away hundreds of millions of dollars in
investments, including investments in mutual funds. You may have done this
if you’ve moved around a lot without systematically sending changes of
address to fund companies and placing mail-forwarding orders with the post
office. After fund companies try for a long time to send mail to your old
address, they eventually throw in the towel, and your account becomes dor-
mant. No more statements are sent for a number of years, after which time
your account is considered abandoned!
321
Chapter 17: Common Fund Problems and How to Fix Them

By law, the mutual fund company must transfer your abandoned money to
the treasurer’s office (called escheatment, for you Trivial Pursuit or game
show buffs) of the state in which the fund company does business or the
state in which the last registered address appeared on your account. This
transfer may happen from within a few years to more than a decade after the
fund company loses contact with you. If you don’t claim the money within a
certain number of years after that, the state gets to keep it.
If you vaguely recall that you had funds with a particular fund company way
back when, call the company. You don’t need to remember the specific funds
you invested in. By using your name, Social Security number, old mailing
addresses, and personal stuff like that, the fund company’s computer system
can find your accounts and determine whether they were turned over to the
state. You can also try contacting the state treasurer’s office in the states in
which you’ve lived to see whether they have any of your abandoned
accounts (you can do this as well for recently deceased relatives in the event
you’re concerned that you may have overlooked some of their accounts). If
you find your accounts, please write to me in care of the publisher and let me
know — these successes make me happy!
Untangling Account Transfer Snags
Transferring accounts from one investment firm or bank to another can be a
big pain. Even obtaining the correct transfer paperwork and completing it is a
challenge — that’s why I detail how to do it in Chapter 14.
Problems happen most often with retirement accounts and with brokerage
account transfers. Some firms are reluctant to give up your money and so
they drag their feet, doing everything they can to make your life and the lives
of employees who transfer accounts at your new investment company a
nightmare. The biggest culprits are the supposed “full service” brokerage
firms (for instance, Prudential, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch) that
employ commission-based brokers. They’ve lost a lot of money flowing out to
no-load and discount brokers’ mutual funds, and they do what they can to
hang on. The unfortunate reality is that they’ll cheerfully set up a new
account to accept your money on a moment’s notice, but they’ll drag their
feet, sometimes for months, when it comes time to relinquish your money.
Don’t let this foot dragging on the part of brokerage firms deter you from
moving your money to a better investment firm. Remember that the transfer
should, under securities industry regulations, be done within 30 days. If it’s
not, hammer the villains! Should the transfer not be complete within a month,
get in touch with your new investment firm to determine what the problem is.
322
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

If your old company isn’t cooperating, a call to a manager there may help get
the ball rolling. To light a fire under their behinds, tell the manager at the old
firm that you’ll be sending letters to the National Association of Securities
Dealers (NASD) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if they
don’t complete your transfer within the next week. Then do it.
In addition to uncooperative brokers, certain assets present problems with
transfers. If you purchase any house-branded mutual funds at commission-
based brokerage firms, in addition to buying into what’s likely a relatively
mediocre family of funds, you also can’t transfer their funds as they are. You
must first have them liquidated through the broker whose name is on them so
that the cash proceeds can be transferred. Most annuities work the same way.
Transfer individual securities, such as stocks and bonds, to a discount
broker. That way, if you later decide to sell them, you save on commission
charges. Limited partnerships generally can’t be liquidated, and everybody
levies fees to hold them — another reason not to buy them in the first place.
If you want less account clutter, transfer these to the discount broker you’re
otherwise going to be using.
Eliminating Marketing Solicitations
If you do business with many companies and their marketing folks are driving
you batty, call your fund companies and ask them to code your account on
their advanced computer systems so that you won’t receive anything other
than statements and reports on your funds. Fund companies are required
under SEC regulations to honor such a request. Fund companies are happy to
oblige — they don’t want irritated customers.
As for all the other junk mail you get, send a request not to receive junk mail
(including your name, complete home address) to the Direct Marketing
Association, Mail Preference Service, P.O. Box 643, Carmel, NY 10512. You can
also complete the form on the association’s Web site at www.dmaconsumers.
org; however, the cost can be $5 (isn’t that ridiculous) for making the request
online whereas it doesn’t charge for written requests sent in the mail.
Some fund companies and brokers may call you at home soliciting your pur-
chase of investments. They tend to focus on people with large cash balances
sitting in their accounts. To stop any type of sellers from calling you in the
future, you have the Do Not Call Registry on your side. Register for free either
online at www.donotcall.gov or call (888) 382-1222 from the number you
want to register.

Chapter 17: Common Fund Problems and How to Fix Them

Digging Out from under the Statements
If you’re being buried in paperwork from statements and transaction confir-
mations from too many fund companies, consider consolidating your fund
holdings through a discount broker. Trade-offs do exist — you pay more in
fees for the convenience that these accounts offer (see Chapter 8). Some fund
companies also have ways to consolidate statements, but you may have to
specifically request this service for your statements.
If you truly abhor getting paper statements in the mail, increasing numbers of
fund firms allow you to “turn off” receiving such clutter and view your state-
ments online. Visit your favorite fund company Web sites for details.
Getting Older Account Statements
Perhaps, for reasons of nostalgia or taxes, you need copies of a statement
that’s more than a year old. Most companies should have no problem provid-
ing it (and some have Web sites allowing you to retrieve such history). They
may, however, charge you something like $10 per fund per year requested. So
be choosy. The main reason you’d request a statement is to research how
much you originally invested in a mutual fund held outside of a retirement
account. If you sold or are thinking about selling shares of the fund, you may
have to figure out the fund’s cost basis for tax reporting purposes (see
Chapter 16). In the future, be sure to keep your statements so you don’t need
to ask for copies.
If you’re going to sell all the shares that you hold in a fund, check to see if
your firm can report the average cost of the shares sold. If their accounting
system can do this, you’re golden and you don’t need to bother with getting
the old statements.

 Steering clear of the lousy newsletters
 Getting investment information from the best sources
M
y father loves data and analyzing it. He likes figuring out how things
work. Before he retired, he was a mechanical engineer. (Impressively,
he worked his entire career in one field.) He loves making charts and graphs.
During the months that I wrote the first edition of this book, he was poring
over a veritable truckload of data and information on mutual funds and
investing.
So I wrote this chapter for people like my dad. Even if you’re not an engineer
by training, there may be a bit of a data lover in you. The challenge as you
navigate the landscape of mutual fund data, newsletters, references, and
gurus is discerning the good from the merely mediocre — as well as the
downright useless and dangerous information and advice. Unfortunately,
more of the latter are out there waiting to trip you up.
Avoiding the Bad Stuff
I start with the bad stuff because so much bad investment advice is out there,
and odds are good that you may currently be using some of it or thinking of
using it, or it may be pitched to you in the future. Finding out the tricks of the
trade enables you to better identify the good stuff. But if you’re pressed for
time and can’t bear to see the ugly side of the investment newsletter busi-
ness, skip ahead to the good sources that I recommend later in this chapter.
(I cover software and Web sites in Chapter 19.)

326
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 
Newsletters cost you time and money. Don’t use newsletters for predictive
advice. If these prognosticators were that smart about the future of financial
markets, they’d be successful money managers making a lot more money.
The only types of publications you should consider subscribing to are those
that offer research and information rather than predictions. (I discuss those
publications in the “Getting in on the Good Stuff” section in this chapter.)
Looking into market timing 
and crystal balls
Market timing — even in the form of slick, professional-looking packaging and
claims — is a losing proposition. Many fund investors believe that they can
increase their chances of success if they follow the predictions of certain
gurus. Gurus often say (or imply) that they can tell you when you should be
in or out of the markets or particular investments. Whenever a prognostica-
tor near you treats you to such “wisdom,” just repeat after me:
“No one can predict the future.”
“No one can predict the future.”
“No one can predict the future.”
If you can remember this one simple fact — a fact supported by mountains of
evidence and plenty of good old-fashioned common sense — you’ll dramati-
cally increase your chances for successful investing in funds, and you will
decrease the odds of making major mistakes. And you’ll have a much clearer
vision about which resources to use for further reading and research about
funds. As I explain in Chapter 9, the strategy of market timing is doomed to
failure in the long run.
Take a look at the performance track record of investment newsletters.
According to The Hulbert Financial Digest (see the next section), which looks
at risk as well as return, only a few newsletters have managed to keep ahead
of the market averages over the past 15 years. And these newsletters only
managed to do so by a small margin (and that doesn’t take into account the
cost of subscribing to a newsletter). The worst investment newsletters, on
the other hand, have underperformed the market averages by dozens of per-
centage points: Some would’ve even caused you to lose money during time
periods when the financial markets performed extraordinarily well.
Of course, you’d never know about newsletters’ dismal performances if all
you ever listened to were the claims made by newsletter writers themselves.
Most claim that they told their loyal followers to sell everything just before
the last dozen times that the stock market plunged. They also usually go on
to proclaim that they advocated buying at every bottom in the market.

Newsletters writers don’t know anything that isn’t already reflected in the
prices of securities. If newsletter writers did have a knack for unearthing
information that no one else typically knew, they’d be too busy investing
their own money and making millions off their predictions to waste their time
publishing a newsletter.
Keeping them honest and providing new
fodder: The Hulbert Financial Digest
Mark Hulbert started a useful business in the 1980s. Almost every investment
newsletter was making outrageous claims about the success of its previous
predictions. But how could you, the potential new subscriber, know whether
a newsletter was telling the truth or blowing smoke? Answer: You couldn’t.
Not until Mark Hulbert came along, that is. He tracks the actual performance
of the newsletters’ investment picks. For each newsletter, he creates a portfo-
lio based exactly on the newsletter’s recommendations. So, over time,
Hulbert knows exactly how the newsletters’ picks have done.
Has The Hulbert Financial Digest stopped the outrageous claims of the invest-
ment newsletters? No, but the claims seem to be slowly getting more accu-
rate, thanks to Hulbert’s influence. The problem is that people still believe
the marketing hype of the newsletters and never bother to check with
Hulbert’s service.
Hulbert’s service has created another problem, however. Many newsletters
can claim to be number one by selecting short time periods when they actu-
ally were number one, even though they’ve underperformed the rest of the
time. And some falsely lay claim to the number-one status by simply compar-
ing their performance to all those that are worse, while ignoring the ones that
perform better!
Using bogus rankings, token awards, 
and mystery testimonials
Newsletters also cite rankings from other organizations (such as Timer’s
Digest) in their efforts to justify their claims of numero-uno status. Given
enough time periods and categories of newsletters, many newsletter writers
can claim the coveted number-one spot at some time or another.
327
Chapter 18: Fund Ratings and Forecasters

Newsletters also refer to awards they’ve won from the Newsletter Publisher’s
Association (NPA). My advice: Ignore NPA awards. They’re meaningless. They
have nothing to do with the performance of a newsletter’s advice. And
because the NPA is an association made up of the newsletters themselves,
they’re just giving themselves a pat on the back! Not a very objective way to
dole out awards, eh? (The association isn’t very large and is always doling out
awards, which doesn’t hurt newsletter writers’ chances of winning, either.)
And, of course, you have the inevitable customer testimonials. Curiously,
though, testimonials almost always parrot the promotional material for the
newsletter, and they never include the person’s name. All they provide are
the person’s initials, such as B.S., and good old B.S.’s home, such as Brooklyn,
N.Y. Some of these testimonials are made up — so they really are B.S.!
Pitching a product: Filler and 
ads in newsletter form
Many newsletter writers publish newsletters as a means of drawing people
into their money management business. For some, that’s the only reason they
produce the newsletter. So they don’t really want to teach you too much
about investing; they want to convince you that your money is best off in
their hands — which means that their articles are usually trying to tell you
that investing is complicated and market timing is everything.
Some newsletters that are already short on content plug their money man-
agement service right in the newsletter. One monthly newsletter that sells for
more than $100 per year publishes issues that are 80 percent filler; perfor-
mance numbers for funds are an example of this filler — numbers that you
can get for a few bucks a month by picking up one of the many financial mag-
azines that contain this data. In the four pages of articles in the typical
newsletter, readers often confront a plug for the editor’s money management
business because (according to him) a newsletter’s advice can’t substitute
for the daily oversight of your portfolio.
Don’t believe it. Of course, this claim isn’t what they told you in their market-
ing materials to get you to subscribe to the newsletter. What the newsletter
should’ve said (and what would’ve been accurate) is that the editor nets a lot
less profit by selling a newsletter than he does by landing another client for
his money management business.
Investing newsletter Hall of Shame
The following sections reveal some of the many examples of the really heavy

newsletters. All the examples are drawn from real-world newsletters. However,
I’ve changed the names to keep you focused on the types of misleading prac-
tices that marketing newsletters engage in instead of having you focus on the
particular scoundrels behind each of these disreputable newsletters.
Dwayne Dweeb’s Personal Finance
Dwayne Dweeb’s newsletter marketing materials issue the following procla-
mation about Dweeb, a veteran newsletter writer: “A Millionaire Maker
Outsmarts the Market. Again.” In a glossy, multipage brochure, Dweeb is said
to have “the highest IQ of them all . . . somewhere between Einstein, Mother
Theresa, and an IBM mainframe.” (I’m not making this up!)
His literature goes on to say: “The reason he can expand your money by 30
percent to 50 percent a year is sheer mental horsepower.” You’re also told
that his newsletter is rated number one by “both of the major rating ser-
vices.” Dweeb’s materials assert that he’s developed a brilliant and totally
awesome proprietary model, which he calls the “Numero Uno Indicator.” His
claim is that this model has predicted the last 28 (count ’em, 28) upturns in
the market in a row without a single miss. The odds of doing this, according
to Dweeb, are more than 268 million to 1!
But wait, it gets better. The ad goes on to claim that Dweeb’s “Numero Uno
Indicator” market timing system could’ve turned a $10,000 investment into
$39.1 million in 12 years. That would be a return of 390,000 percent!
Does this claim sound too good to be true? You got it. This outrageous claim,
if not purely fabricated, was based on backtesting, looking back over histori-
cal returns and creating “what if” scenarios. In other words, Dweeb didn’t
turn anyone’s $10,000 into $39.1 million. Much too late after that ad appeared,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally charged Dweeb with
false advertising. Dweeb settled out of court, and a $60,000 fine was imposed.
Here’s the real scoop on Dweeb’s investing ability. In 1991, Dweeb established
a mutual fund. Over the next decade, this fund was one of the worst growth
stock funds around. His fund underperformed about 90 percent of its peers.
Harry Hacker’s Mutual Fund Investing
Steer clear of anyone who claims to be “America’s #1 Mutual Fund Adviser.” I
remember Hacker’s name as if it were my own, because for a while, it seemed,
once a month I’d receive a glossy color brochure more than 20 pages long
from him in the mail. Like Dweeb (see the preceding section), Hacker claimed
to have been rated number one by Hulbert. Hulbert responds, “It is a fabrica-
tion. Mutual Fund Investing is not now, nor has it ever been, rated number one
by my digest.” Hulbert was so incensed by Hacker’s claim that he devoted an
entire column, appropriately entitled “Lies and near lies” to setting the
record straight in Forbes magazine.
329
Chapter 18: Fund Ratings and Forecasters

Soon after Hulbert’s scathing column about Hacker appeared in Forbes, in
Hacker’s next mailing he changed his tune a bit. His 1990s marketing materi-
als displayed a colorful chart showing that his stock and bond fund picks
returned 1,517 percent over a 15-year period — for a nearly 20 percent annu-
alized rate of return, which would’ve outperformed the famous Fidelity
Magellan fund and star fund manager Peter Lynch. This return would imply
that his advice had beaten the average stock fund, which over the same time
period returned just 14.7 percent per year, and the average bond fund, at 9.1
percent per year, by some distance significantly greater than a country mile.
Like many fund-investing newsletter writers, Hacker also said to avoid index
funds — he actually calls them “blind average index” funds because, he said,
they’re “headed for trouble in the 1990s.” Why? Simple: Hacker reasoned that
index funds specialize in stocks of large, well-known companies, the very
firms that made big bucks in the 1980s from corporate mergers and the like.
But as I discuss in Chapter 9, index funds don’t just invest in large-company
stocks, and as the history of the 1990s has shown, Hacker was all wrong
about future performance of index funds. Hulbert’s tracking of Hacker’s rec-
ommendations clearly shows that Hacker’s portfolio returns fell well below
the market averages.

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 
Mutual confusion: Misuse of fund ratings
Rating mutual funds has become a national
obsession. When you check out business and
financial publications, be cautious about fund
ratings. Whether they’re letter grades (ranging
from “A” for best to an “F” for worst or a
number system, fund ratings purport to rank
how good particular funds are. The most
common mistake investors make in using even
the better mutual fund publications is focusing
too much on the ranking of specific funds.
Dan Wiener, editor of The Independent Adviser
for Vanguard Investors newsletter, did an inter-
esting analysis of four major financial maga-
zines lists of best funds. Amazingly, more than
80 percent of the chosen funds appeared on just
one of the four lists and not even one fund made
it on all four lists. Clearly, different publications
have widely varying criteria.
The problem with many fund-rating systems is
that they’re based on history and overweight
the most recent performance of funds. The
mutual fund landscape is littered with plenty of
funds that were yesterday’s stars that have
become today’s losers and has-beens. A prob-
lematic fund rating system is one that
 Ignores the risk of a fund and its costs
 Gives costs little weighting to these two
important factors

Getting in on the Good Stuff
If you want to read more about investments, by all means read more. But read
useful information. Most of the better financial magazines and newspapers,
for example, cost a fraction of the newsletters’ prices, and provide more
useful information.
Many of the major financial publications — Barron’s, Business Week, Forbes,
Fortune, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, SmartMoney, and The Wall Street Journal —
do annual mutual fund roundups. Most newspapers and many large news maga-
zines provide fund coverage as well. Some good newsletters are available, too.
Morningstar Mutual Funds
Morningstar’s mutual fund publication, Morningstar Mutual Funds, is packed
with information. Every square inch of its single-page fund summaries
(printed on 81⁄2-x-11-inch pages) is put to use. The most valuable benefit of
these one-pagers is that they can save you time. If you want a snapshot sum-
mary of a lot of data, as well as some thoughtful analysis about a fund you’re
considering investing in or currently own, Morningstar can’t be beat. Most of
the information summarized on its pages comes from a fund’s prospectus and
semiannual reports. Some of the data it provides for funds may take you hours
to calculate and may require a sophisticated computer software program.
Morningstar Mutual Funds covers load funds (funds that carry commissions)
as well as no-load funds. As I explain in Chapter 7, loads are an additional and
unnecessary cost to buy funds that brokers sell. If you have load funds that
you want to evaluate, Morningstar Mutual Funds can help.
Many public libraries subscribe to Morningstar. A one-year subscription
costs $549; a three-month trial subscription costs $69. (You can take a trial
subscription once every two years.) Morningstar also offers lower-priced ser-
vices through its Web site (see Chapter 19 for details). For more information,
call (866) 608-9570.
Reading a Morningstar bond fund page
Morningstar’s packed pages make some people’s heads spin. The hard part is
knowing what to look at and what to make of the information. In this section,
I highlight some of the more useful features to examine for bond funds that
you may be considering (see Figure 18-1). I jump around their page a bit so
that I can work from the bigger-picture issues toward more of the details.

Morningstar’s Take by Lawrence Jones 03-06-07
We like T. Rowe Price GNMA’s newfound flexibility
and think it’s a solid option.  
     A June 2006 change to this fund’s mandate
provided manager Connie Bavely with added tools
and flexibility. No longer bound exclusively to
issues carrying the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government, she can now invest up to 20% of
assets in mortgage- and asset-backed securities
rated AA or better (with the balance of assets in
plain-vanilla Ginnie Mae pass-throughs). Given that
many of this fund’s Ginnie Mae rivals have had this
kind of flexibility for years, we think it should help
the fund compete more effectively with rivals.  
     The flexibility is particularly useful, given that
Ginnie Mae funds fish from the same relatively
small pond. Now Bavely can expand upon her
attempts to identify mispriced Ginnie Maes by also
looking at the relative valuation between different
segments of her broader market. To be sure, her
team will continue using a variety of prepayment
models to gauge where the market has
misunderstood the risk inherent in these issues.
(Prepayment can hurt mortgage-backed bond
investors, since it tends to occur as interest-rates
decline, forcing investors to reallocate capital at
lower rates.) But Bavely can now move some
assets away from Ginnie Maes when she believes
they are expensive. And since she won’t make
large interest-rate bets, the mandate change is all
the more helpful.  
     Moreover, we’re encouraged by the results
Bavely has delivered to date. Against
intermediate-term government category peers, the
fund’s annualized trailing five-year return of 4.24%,
through March 5, 2007, ranks it in the top 28% of
the group. And the fund has competed well within
the narrower group of Ginnie Mae-focused funds.  
     While the fund continues to face stiff
competition from cheaper rivals, such as Vanguard
and Fidelity, we think its expanded mandate
improves its profile and helps it compete.

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Morningstar’s pages are difficult to read with all their small print. (Although
my wife and I both have good eyesight, when she saw one of their pages she
suggested taking it to a copy shop to enlarge it!) Here’s an outline of the
details by numbered section:
1 Portfolio Manager(s): This section highlights the fund’s managers and
notes the date the manager(s) started managing the particular fund.
2 Strategy: From the prospectus, this section provides a summary of the
general investment objectives and limitations that a fund subjects itself to.
3 Performance: The first section displays the total amount that investors
made or lost (from dividends, capital gains, and share price changes) for
each quarter over the past five years. This section can give you a sense
of the likely volatility of an investment in the fund (remember, though,
that this is history, and the future will differ). If you get queasy looking
at these numbers, don’t invest.
The second section — the trailing returns — shows annualized total
return information over longer time periods. (Total return numbers
don’t account for loads, but you’re not going to pay any anyway, are
you?) The fund’s returns are also compared to benchmark indexes,
which in some cases aren’t so comparable. The Lehman Brothers bond
index used here (the “LB”) is an intermediate-term maturity index. This
type of index isn’t valid for comparing all bond funds, but it isn’t bad for
this fund, which typically invests in intermediate-term bonds. (See
Chapter 15 for more background on benchmarks.)
4 Portfolio Analysis: This data is summarized from a fund’s most recent
reporting. Note the total number of securities this fund holds and the
listing of the top 20 holdings.
The Current Investment Style box shows you which types of bonds the
fund mainly holds at the moment (in this case, high-quality, intermedi-
ate-term bonds). Measures of interest rate sensitivity — average matu-
rity and duration (both of which I explain in Chapter 11) — are provided
here, as well as the average credit quality of the fund’s bonds.
Sector Breakdown quantifies the fund’s current holdings of the major
types of bonds. Composition details the fund’s recent holdings of cash,
bonds, and other securities. Composition is worth looking at to deter-
mine whether a fund really is what it says it is.
The Special Securities section highlights the fund’s holdings in riskier
types of securities, including derivatives (which I discuss in Chapter 2).
All things being equal, it’s best to see zeros here, but some funds use, for
example, options to hedge or reduce the risk of the fund.

Chapter 18: Fund Ratings and Forecasters

5 Analysis: Each fund at Morningstar is assigned an analyst. Analysts use
available information, as well as interviews with fund company man-
agers (and others) and data on the page, to summarize the fund strate-
gies. This section is usually well worth reading, especially if you’re not a
numbers kind of person.
6 History: Here’s a data dump of all sorts of information for the fund over
more than the past decade. Here you can see how the total return, per-
formance versus benchmarks, dividend (income), capital gains, the
fund’s annual operating expenses, and trading (turnover rate) have
varied over the years. (Note: The little style boxes, as explained in
“Portfolio Analysis” bullet, number 4, for each year are so you can see
how the fund’s style has varied, if at all, over time.)
7 Historical Profile: Without a doubt, this section is the most overused
and abused part of the Morningstar page. Funds are given ratings, based
on past performance and volatility, from one (worst) to five (best) stars.
The folks at Morningstar say that “funds with 3, 4, and 5 stars often
make the most sense for many investors.” I think that says it well — you
can’t really say much more about the star rating system than that. More
stars are not necessarily better than fewer and vice versa.
8 Rating and Risk: Here you see more details for the determination of the
ranking and the way the fund rates over different periods.
All sorts of other quantitative measurements of risk are presented here.
One of the more useful is beta, which helps you calibrate the volatility of
a fund compared to relevant benchmarks. The overall bond market
benchmark is assigned a beta of 1.00. Thus, a fund with a beta of 1.2
implies that it’s 20 percent more volatile on average (perhaps because it
invests in longer-term bonds or lower-credit-quality bonds).
9 Tax Analysis: This section provides some insightful measures of a fund’s
tax efficiency or tax friendliness. If you’re investing in a fund inside a
retirement account, ignore this section. If you’re investing outside a
retirement account, the tax-adjusted return column shows what your
effective return would’ve been in this fund over various periods if all the
dividend and capital gains distributions that a fund makes were taxed at
the highest applicable federal tax rate and then reinvested in the fund.
Potential Capital Gains Exposure measures how much, if any, unrealized
profit exists. The larger the number here, the greater the potential risk of
larger distributions in the future, particularly for funds that trade a lot
(that is, that have a high turnover), as this one does. Make sure to exam-
ine historically how much the fund has distributed. (See my discussion
in the “History” bullet, number 6.)
334
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

10 Address, telephone, and other stuff: Here’s where you see how to get in
touch with the fund, how much is required as a minimum investment,
how often it pays dividends, and so on.
Reviewing a Morningstar stock fund page
Morningstar’s stock fund pages carry much of the same types of information
that their bond fund pages carry (see Figure 18-2). I won’t repeat my explana-
tions of the same sections I cover for a bond fund page. (To see what I’d be
repeating if I did talk about it here, skip back to the preceding section.) The
sections of a stock fund page that significantly differ from a bond fund page
include
4 Portfolio Analysis: The summary of a fund’s holdings is the most impor-
tant area of difference between a stock fund page and a bond fund page.
That’s no surprise, though, because stocks are quite different from
bonds.
Similar to the bond fund page, the stock fund page notes the total
number of securities that it holds. A list of the top 20 securities, along
with what portion each stock comprises of the fund’s assets and its
recent return and price-earnings ratio also shows up here.
Current Investment Style classifies a fund’s current stock holdings based
on the size of the company, as well as on whether those stocks tend to
be growth, value, or both. (I cover the difference among these various
types of stocks in Chapter 12.) The page also presents a variety of statis-
tical measures for the stocks that the fund holds. For example, you can
see the average rate of growth in the earnings of the companies that this
fund invests in and how that rate compares to that of other funds in its
category.
Composition is also useful because it indicates whether a fund is holding
major cash positions and whether it invests in securities other than
stocks. Market Cap shows how the fund is allocating its holdings among
stocks of companies of varying sizes. Sector Weightings breaks down a
fund’s stock holdings by industry and compares the fund’s holdings to
those of a relevant index (in this case, the S&P 500 index).
6 History: Note the use of different benchmark indexes suitable for stock
funds. The graph also indicates — with small arrowheads — when one
of the fund’s managers changed.

Governance and Management
Stewardship Grade:
Portfolio Manager(s)
A
This fund has an experienced and deep management team. The
Dodge & Cox equity investment policy committee, which runs this
fund, has nine members. The team is supported by roughly  20
analysts and about 10 research assistants. 
Strategy
This fund’s management team invests in mostly large-cap stocks
that look cheap on a range of valuation measures. It favors
companies with good management, dominant competitive
positions, and good growth potential, but usually doesn’t get
interested until these stocks are under some sort of cloud.
Because management takes such a long-term view, the fund’s
turnover is just a fraction of the large-value category average.

Morningstar’s Take by Dan Culloton 03-16-07
This fund still deserves your trust.  
     Dodge & Cox Stock will have an off year, but
don’t think any less of it when it does. The fund’s
recent returns have been great: It’s routinely beaten
the large-value category, Russell 1000 Value and
S&P 500 indexes since the last time it ended a year
in the bottom half of its peer group in 1998. It will
be hard to keep that pace up, not only because the
firm now runs nearly $150 billion in equity assets in
this fund and others, but also because even
talented investors have fallow periods.  
     If or when a slump occurs, this closed fund will
still be a worthy holding. Its current portfolio looks
a lot different than it did at the start of the fund’s
current run, but its approach hasn’t changed. It uses
rigorous fundamental analysis to find stocks with
prices that don’t reflect their potential over the next
three to five years. It was easier in the late 1990s
when large-growth and technology stocks traded at
once-in-an-era valuations and all else languished.
Then the fund owned old economy stocks.  
     Valuations aren’t as lopsided and opportunities
not as obvious now, but this fund isn’t sitting on
the sidelines. It has been selling energy and
industrial materials stocks, such as Hess and Rio
Tinto, and buying huge companies with defensible
market positions and prices that haven’t kept up
with their earnings. That has included some of the
poster-children of the tech stock boom, including
eBay, which had fallen by 17% in the year ending
March 15. The online auctioneer generates a lot of
cash and has a lower price/sales ratio if you
include the value of the merchandise sold via its
Web site in its revenue like a retailer (eBay reports
only the fees it collects on sales), the managers
say. This fund has made such counterintuitive
moves work before, but it has had to be patient. It
began buying recent winner Hewlett-Packard, for
example, in 2001 when in the words of one of this
fund’s managers, it "was bat guano."    
     This fund has the patience, as well as the skill
and experience, to get the job done in the future.

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

No-Load Fund Analyst
Those people who enjoy doing more reading about funds and the financial
markets should consider the No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter, which tracks a
much smaller universe of the better no-load funds than Morningstar does.
This monthly publication provides commentary and analysis of trends in the
economy, happenings in the fund industry, and fund manager interviews and
profiles. In an industry in which many publications claim that they can
double your money in a snap if you become a subscriber, the No-Load Fund
Analyst is a breath of fresh air — it includes no hype or inflated marketing
claims.
Personal interviews and the tracking of individual fund managers are unique
and valuable aspects of this publication, which tries to identify talented fund
managers at some of the smaller, lesser-known funds. These funds, of course,
are riskier to invest in. Also, because the No-Load Fund Analyst recommends
funds in numerous fund families, as an investor you must be willing to deal
with many fund companies or establish an account at a discount brokerage
firm (see Chapter 8). The editors’ primary business has been their invest-
ment management company. They manage money for institutions and
wealthy individuals in mutual funds — their minimum account size for new
clients is $3 million.
The No-Load Fund Analyst also follows and discusses closed-end mutual
funds, which I cover in Chapter 2. An annual subscription to the No-Load Fund
Analyst costs $600. For $50, you can obtain a sample issue (online only sub-
scriptions are discounted 10 percent) by calling (800) 776-9555 or visiting
their Web site at www.nlfa.com.
The Independent Adviser for Vanguard
Investors
As you may have guessed from its name, the Independent Adviser for
Vanguard Investors is an excellent publication that focuses exclusively on
Vanguard’s extensive family of mutual funds (and now exchange-traded
funds). Editor Dan Wiener, who’s a former financial journalist, also operates a
money management business.
337
Chapter 18: Fund Ratings and Forecasters

What I really like is that Wiener does his research and homework. He’s adept
at sifting through the large number of Vanguard funds and highlighting those
that do the best and are likely to continue performing well. That said, he isn’t
like many other newsletter writers who make predictions about the stock
market and economy. He also shies away from making major shifts in his sug-

Chapter 19
Harnessing Your Computer’s
Power
In This Chapter
 Finding your way around mutual funds with software
 Locating the best mutual fund Web sites
W
hen you invest your money, especially in mutual funds, having a PC at
your disposal to make wise investing decisions and to manage your
portfolio is not necessary nor is it advantageous. In fact, the use of a com-
puter when investing may prove detrimental to your investing success. Why?
My experience with counseling clients, reading letters and e-mails from read-
ers, and instructing students in my courses is that heavy computer users tend
to focus too much on daily price changes and the short-term news and, thus,
they trade too much — losing sight of the important bigger-picture issues. So
if you’re not online yet or don’t own a computer to play around with investing
software or Internet sites, don’t be sad. If you decide to spend money on a PC
or you already own one but don’t know how it can help you invest in funds,
this chapter assists you with finding out how to put it to work.
I divide this chapter into two parts — software and Web sites. Some of the
stuff I discuss does some of both categories. Those that do are generally
placed in the category that they do more of.
Using Computer Software
Most software reviewers can agree that good software must be easy to use.
Software that helps you make mutual fund and other investing decisions
must also provide well-founded advice and information. Not all of it does.

Knowing which software is best for you depends on your goals and level of
investment expertise. The financial software in the marketplace today can
help you with a variety of activities that range from simply tabulating your
mutual fund’s values and getting current prices to researching investment
choices. You can even execute fund trades on your computer.
As I discuss later in this chapter (see the section, “Entering Cyberspace:
Internet Sites”), thanks to technological advances, Web sites are offering fea-
tures that were once the exclusive domain of software programs. Before you
rush out to purchase a specific software program to accomplish a certain
task, check to see what the Internet has to offer in that area.
Getting-and-staying-organized software
Checkbook software programs, such as Quicken and Microsoft Money, help
with checkbook accounting, expense tracking, and bill paying. But checkbook
software is also useful for keeping track of your mutual fund investments. By
remembering your original purchase price, as well as factoring in dividend
and capital gains distributions, checkbook software automatically calculates
your current rate of return, both annualized and cumulative, for each individ-
ual fund, as well as for your entire portfolio.
However — and this is a big however — in order for checkbook software to
keep track of your returns, you must plug in all your transactions, distribu-
tions, and share price changes when you receive your account statements. If
you have a lot of funds at different accounts, this process could be tedious,
depending on how much you like detail work. Some (primarily) larger invest-
ment companies allow you to download your account statement details
directly into your checkbook software program. But even this procedure usu-
ally requires you to work with the downloaded transactions and assign them
to appropriate categories.
Checkbook software can be useful if you have accounts at numerous invest-
ment firms and want to keep tabs on your various accounts and overall per-
formance. But remember that consolidating your investments at a larger
mutual fund company or through a discount brokerage account can accom-
plish the same goals for you — without your having to invest hours in study-
ing software and entering data.
Also keep in mind that one of the most attractive features of checkbook soft-
ware — its ability to track your cost basis — is irrelevant for funds held in
retirement accounts. (See Chapter 16 for more information on cost basis as
used for tax purposes.) Most mutual fund companies in this day and age
track your cost basis for you, too.

Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

Accessing investment research software
Investment research software packages usually separate investment begin-
ners (and others who don’t want to spend a lot of time managing their
money) from those who enjoy wallowing in data and conducting primary
research. The best reason to use research software is to access quality infor-
mation in a way that may be more cost-effective than doing so through tradi-
tional channels. Research software may allow you to peruse more
information more efficiently at lower cost than accessing a paper version
from the same source.
Although these packages can be cost-effective, they’re still expensive. Don’t
jump into one of these programs until you’ve done a careful comparison
between the information it offers and the data you need. Most investment
software packages offer more raw data than you can ever use.
Mutual fund data hounds delight in the software products that Morningstar
offers. However, if you’re an investing and mutual fund novice, don’t expect
an easy time working with these sometimes jargon-laden and costly pack-
ages. Also expect to invest several hours of your time to figure out how to
work with a program. (Morningstar offers more affordable and scaled-down
information through its Web site, which I discuss later in this chapter.) Here’s
my take on Morningstar’s mutual fund software:
 Principia Mutual Funds: This software provides most of the data that’s
provided on Morningstar’s printed reports, which I show you in Chapter
18. You can search and screen for funds that meet the specific criteria
that you enter into the program. The program also comes with a feature
called the Portfolio Developer, which allows you to gather a portfolio of
funds and then view a pie chart of that particular portfolio’s asset alloca-
tion. A monthly subscription is $655 a year; a quarterly subscription is
$535; an annual update is $270. Call (877) 586-5405 for more info.
 Principia Mutual Funds Advanced: The ultimate for the mutual fund
data junkie, its interface is almost identical to Principia Mutual Funds’,
but you get more historical data and features. All the data available on
Morningstar’s printed reports comes with this program, and then some.
For example, each fund has an archive of all the analyst’s reviews of that
fund. The program also lets you print out these reports on your own
printer. The Portfolio Developer allows you to track the performance of
your mutual fund portfolio over time. The price for Morningstar’s first-
class ticket is steep: An annual subscription with monthly updates is
$1,185; quarterly updates are $885, and an annual update is $525. Call
(877) 586-5405 for more information.

Chapter 19: Harnessing Your Computer’s Power

Before plunging into the data jungle, be honest about your reasons for doing
research. Some investors fool themselves into believing that their research
will help them beat the markets. As I say many times in this book, though,
few of even the so-called professional investors ever beat the markets.
Entering Cyberspace: Internet Sites
The Internet is a vast network of computers all over the world that share
information. Just about anyone can plug into the Internet right from home —
all you need is a personal computer and a connection. Fund investors online
have some of the following possible benefits:
 Quick access to info: The Internet can give you faster access to impor-
tant resources than traditional channels allow. Before the Internet,
investors had only one way to get their hands on, say, a fund prospec-
tus: Call up the folks at the fund company, give them an address, and
wait up to a week for the mailman to deliver the goods. With Internet
access, you can log onto the fund company’s Web site and view the
prospectus immediately, and even print it out, if you want to. The same
goes for annual reports, account applications, research reports, account
statements, and so on.
 Interactive features: The best Internet sites are similar to software
programs in that they’re interactive. The phenomenon of retirement-
planning calculators is a good example. The best online calculators ask
you questions, you plug in the answers, and on your computer screen
you see your personalized plan calculated for you, complete with graphs
and charts — sure beats slugging it out with a calculator and pencil over
a fill-in-the-blank retirement-planning workbook.
 Up-to-date info: Information on the Internet can be kept up-to-date, even
up-to-the-minute. Larger companies have entire staffs that are responsi-
ble for keeping their Web sites current. If a prospectus is revised, or a
new tax law affects a retirement-planning calculation, a well-maintained
Web site can reflect these changes the next time you log on. This advan-
tage is one over the traditional print medium and software programs.
Of course, every coin has a flip side. The Internet has introduced plenty of
hazards for mutual fund investors to be concerned about, but here, to steer
clear of the pitfalls, I give you a few tips:
 Free information, at a price: After you’ve paid your toll to get on the
Information Superhighway, many things that you find there have the illu-
sion of being free. Don’t be fooled. Somebody has to pay to put that info
on the Internet, and nine times out of ten it’s a company that’s trying to
sell you stuff that you’re better off not buying. Before you trust a Web
site with information on mutual funds, find out who’s paying the bucks
for the site to be there. (See the sidebar, “Who’s footing the bill?”)
342
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 

 Minutia to fixate on: An advantage of the Internet — its capability to
keep information up-to-date — is also its Achilles’ heel. Too many
Internet sites get so focused on the short term that they lose sight of the
big picture. For example, many Web sites center on up-to-the-minute
investment price quotes and late-breaking financial news: This type of
information doesn’t serve a healthy, long-term investment strategy per-
spective. Don’t let the Internet distract you from your focus on the
investment horizon. Don’t be as enamored with the Internet’s up-to-the-
minute update ability as most Web sites seem to be.
 Too many “experts”: Message boards and chat rooms are a unique
aspect of the Internet. The way that these mediums can facilitate com-
munication between people in various towns, cities, and states is poten-
tially exciting. But message boards and chat rooms are dangerous places
to tread for the naive and too trustful. Remember, you don’t have to take
an entrance exam or have a license requirement for joining a chat room
or posting a message on an electronic bulletin board. The anonymity
makes pretending to be someone you’re not easy. Therefore, participate
cautiously. Never trust any advice you get from a chat room or message
board without verifying it through a reliable independent source. And
never share confidential personal or financial details online.
 Information overload: The possibilities on the Internet are so endless
that they can be overwhelming, and the easiest way to find bad advice is
to be unsure about what you’re looking for in the first place. Knowing
what information you want before you start searching pays. If you enter a
vague term into an Internet search engine — say, “mutual funds” — you’ll
probably end up more lost than you were to begin with. If, on the other
hand, you enter a specific term — such as TIAA-CREF mutual funds —
you’ll probably find the information you’re looking for.
That said, let me speed up your search for good resources on the Internet by
recommending what I think are the best mutual fund Web sites out there.
You’ll recognize some of the names behind these sites because they’re com-
panies I recommend throughout the book. Not surprisingly, the organizations
that demonstrate excellence offline seem to be the ones that do best online
as well.
FundAlarm.com
Fundalarm.com is a fun and informative Web site operated by Roy Weitz, a
CPA and accounting guy by day. In his free time, he keeps this information
updated. He scours many publications and sites for useful, no-holds-barred,
and sometimes quirky news and information about funds and always tries to
inject a sense of humor.
343
Chapter 19: Harnessing Your Computer’s Power

Here’s an example of a recent entry from one of his monthly commentaries:
“If you have several billion dollars to spend, and you’re looking to buy a
mutual fund company, you might want to get in line: Putnam Investments
and MFS Investment Management are both up for sale . . . It’s too early
to know how these deals will play out, but one thing is for sure: At this
early stage, no one is considering, or even giving lip service to, the inter-
ests of Putnam or MFS fund investors . . . ”
344
Part V: Keeping Current and Informed 
Who’s footing the bill?
You need to know that the Internet is primarily
funded by companies’ marketing departments.
Of course, nothing is intrinsically wrong with
this arrangement; magazine articles and televi-
sion programs are also paid for with advertising
dollars. What’s problematic about the Internet,
however, is that the line between advertising
and content is much fuzzier and more blurred
than in other mediums. In fact, some Web sites
obscure the difference between content and
advertising in a manner that could be called
deliberate.
For example, consider a Web site that hypes
itself as the “best independent mutual fund
resource” and even goes on to boldly declare
that “Content is what makes us different.”
However, this content, such as the text that
appears in the site’s “Expert’s Corner,” turns out
to be nothing more than thinly veiled marketing
fodder from financial newsletter writers who
are intent on selling you a subscription to their
wares.
So how can you tell whether the objective con-
tent you’re reading on the Web is really just a
paid advertisement? Begin by thoroughly
checking out the fine print. In the preceding
example, I found this little disclaimer in the
corner: “These articles are sponsored by the
featured experts. . . .” Sponsored means that the
“experts” (newsletter writers) were paying to
put their articles on the Web site.
If the Web page has a button that reads some-
thing like About Us, click it. Sometimes you can
get information on who’s sponsoring the site.
Also click any buttons that say something such
as For Clients Only or How to Join Us. You may
discover that the site only mentions fund com-
panies that pay a fee to be represented.
Keep an eye out for advertisements that spill
over into the content when you read articles on
independent sites. For example, if an article rec-
ommends a fund company whose advertise-
ment appears at the top of the page, consider
surfing elsewhere.
If you can’t find out who’s behind a particular
site, don’t trust it. A Web site that has nothing to
hide has no reason to be evasive. To be safe,
stick with sites that are totally upfront about
who’s paying for them. A site whose Web
address is www.fundcompanyxyz.com is
obviously not trying to fool anybody.

Investment Company Institute
The Investment Company Institute (ICI) is the investment companies’ trade
association; it includes mostly mutual funds but also closed-end funds,
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and unit investment trusts (UITs). This site
has a wealth of industry data that’s of greater use to financial professionals
who enjoy wallowing around such numbers. Check them out online at
www.ici.org.
Be forewarned, however, that the educational materials on this site won’t
show you to avoid load funds or other high-cost investments, such as most
UITs — some ICI members sell them, so telling you to avoid these invest-
ments would be self-detrimental.
Morningstar.com
Morningstar’s site (www.morningstar.com) is one of the better mutual fund
Web resources. You find Morningstar’s well-known research reports on indi-
vidual funds, which feature long-term performance data and graphs, risk rat-
ings, manager profiles, information on fees, and a list of discount brokers
who sell the fund. Compared to Morningstar’s traditional printed report, the
“free” online version is watered down — no analyst commentary and fewer
stats. But it’s hard to complain when you factor in the price tag: The online
reports, unlike their printed brethren, are free. (Surprisingly, considering that
Morningstar was built on the basis of research and no advertising, the mutual
fund companies with their banner advertisements at the top of every page
pay for this Web site.)
The site also features articles on advanced concepts of fund investing and
developments in the fund industry. For $145 per year, a premium member-
ship gives you online access to more fund information and tools.
T. Rowe Price
On this site (www.troweprice.com), you can find some of the best retire-
ment-planning tools available — for individuals saving for retirement, as well
as for those already in or near retirement. Interactive worksheets can help
you determine which type of IRA may be best for you to invest through. This
site also has a good selection of articles on various fund-investing topics as
well as interviews with leading fund managers at the company. Should you
invest in any of T. Rowe Price’s solid mutual funds, the Web site provides con-
venient access to your account information.
345
Chapter 19: Harnessing Your Computer’s Power

Securities and Exchange Commission
Although the government’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Web
site is far from being the most user-friendly one, it contains a truckload of the
required documents that all funds must file with this agency, whose purpose
is to oversee the investment industry. The EDGAR database enables you to
access documents that mutual funds have filed with the SEC at www.sec.
gov/edgar/searchedgar/webusers.htm. To look at a particular fund’s
documents on file with the SEC, simply choose the general-purpose search
option for companies and other filers. The site then provides a few different
ways to search, but the easiest is to enter as much of the fund’s name as 
possible — don’t use abbreviations or acronyms — in the company-name
search box. If the fund name you provide is associated with more than one
particular fund (for example, if you simply type in Vanguard), a list of choices
appears from which you can choose. After you narrow it down to the particu-
lar fund you’re looking for, you get a laundry list of all the documents that the
fund has filed with the SEC in recent years. (The most recent filings will be at
the top of the screen.)
You may find, as I have, that using the SEC’s search engine can be maddening.
As an alternative, visit www.freeedgar.com, which offers a search engine
far superior to the SEC’s that easily enables you to retrieve desired fund 
documents.
Don’t be fooled by the name — freeEDGAR — this service now charges $219
annually for its most basic services and $1,200 for its premium membership.
Vanguard.com
Among the fund company Web sites that I’ve examined, Vanguard’s (www.
vanguard.com) is unsurpassed for educational content. In addition to housing
an extensive online library of brochures on important fund-investing topics,
this site also boasts numerous planning tools. For example, you can calculate
how much to save for retirement or determine whether to convert your regu-
lar IRA into a Roth IRA. Vanguard’s Web site also enables you, if you so desire,
to track and manage your investments in one central location. You can buy
and sell mutual funds from hundreds of fund companies, stocks, bonds, and
many more investments all in one account.

Ten Common Fund-Investing
Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
In This Chapter
 Designing the right plan for you
 Keeping taxes and fund fees in mind
 Staying away from shady advisers and market predictors
F
rom getting your finances in order to selecting funds to maintaining your
portfolio over time, various potholes and dangers can get in your way.
This chapter highlights the ten most common mistakes you’re likely to make
and how you can sidestep them.
Lacking an Overall Plan
Just as you shouldn’t build a house without an overall plan, you shouldn’t
start buying funds until you have your arms and mind wrapped around a
sound financial plan. The plan doesn’t have to be a fancy, professionally or
computer-generated one, but it should include the basics:
 Proper insurance coverages, like health, disability, auto, home, excess
liability if you hold sufficient assets, and life insurance if others are
dependent upon your income
 A plan for paying off consumer debt on credit cards and auto loans, if
you have any
 Savings goals for retirement, buying a home, starting a business, putting
your kids through college, and anything else your heart desires
 An overall asset allocation — what portion of your money should be
invested in different assets, such as stocks (foreign versus domestic),
bonds, and so on

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Failing to Examine Sales
Charges and Expenses
Would you ever buy a car without considering its sticker price? How about
checking out the car’s safety record and insurance costs? Mutual funds are
like cars in one respect — you should check under the hood before you buy.
But the good news is that fund fees are actually a lot easier to comprehend
compared to the various car costs.
Before you consider buying any mutual fund, be sure you understand pre-
cisely any sales charges as well as the fund’s ongoing operating expense
ratio. Over the long term, a fund’s fees are one of the biggest (and most pre-
dictable) determinants of the fund’s likely future returns. This point is espe-
cially true with boring old money market and conservative bond and stock
funds. Please see Chapter 7 for more on fees.
Chasing Past Performance
Before anyone hires a job applicant, he likes to know that person’s track
record. Ditto for professional sports teams seeking new players. Of course,
when hiring a money manager, which is what you’re doing when you invest in
a mutual fund, you should examine that manager’s prior experience.
However, many investors simply throw money at funds currently posting high
returns without thoroughly examining a fund manager’s experience.
More often than not, current hot funds cool off (especially as small funds get
larger and market conditions change) and many underperform in the future.
The reason is quite simple: The market forces that lead to the relatively brief
period of high performance inevitably change. Peruse Chapter 7 for how to
avoid tomorrow’s losers and maximize your chances of picking a consistent
winner.
Ignoring Tax Issues
Do you know your current federal and state income tax brackets? When a
particular type of stock or bond fund makes a dividend or capital gains distri-
bution, do you know what rate of tax you’ll pay on that?
Many fund investors aren’t well informed when it comes to the tax conse-
quences of their fund purchases and sales. Although you don’t want the tax

tail to wag the fund selection dog, you should know how taxes work on your
funds and which funds fit best for your tax situation. Read Chapter 9.
Getting Duped by “Advisers”
Some people want to hire a financial adviser to help them navigate financial
choices. But many so-called financial consultants or advisers have serious
conflicts of interest. Their recommendations and objectivity are tainted by
commissions earned from products that they sell or from their money-
management services.
If you seek to hire a financial planner/adviser, hire someone who’s selling
their time and nothing else. If what you’re really looking for is someone to
manage your money, seek out a money manager. See Chapter 22.
Falling Prey to the Collection Syndrome
Some people buy mutual funds the way they build a clothing collection. Visits
to different stores and articles recommending specific items lead to pur-
chases. Before you know it, you may own numerous funds that don’t really go
together well.
This mismatching is another reason you should develop your overall plan
first. For example, after you decide that you’re going to invest, say, 20 percent
of your retirement plan money into international stock funds, then you can
set out to identify and then invest that amount of money into your chosen
foreign funds. Check out Chapter 9, which provides a guide to putting
together a sound portfolio that matches your needs.
Trying to Time the Market’s Movements
Just as no one enjoys losing a game, who wants to invest in a fund only to see
it fall in value? Sometimes, though, that may happen even though you’ve
done your homework and selected a good fund.
Stock and bond funds fluctuate in value, and you must accept that inevitabil-
ity when you invest. Some people like examining pricing charts online to
guess when a fund is about to turn around and increase in value. Don’t waste
your time on such unproductive and time-consuming endeavors. Identify
good funds, buy into them over time, and don’t jump in and out.

Chapter 20: Ten Common Fund-Investing Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Following Prognosticators’ Predictions
Don’t make the mistake of believing that some supposed expert bold enough
to make financial market forecasts on television, on radio, or in print actually
has any proven talent to do so. Such blustery babblings are merely for the
publicity of a given firm or individual.
Your long-term goals and desire or lack thereof to accept risk and volatility in
your investments should drive your fund selection. Please read Chapter 18 to
discover how to use information, not predictions, in building a winning fund
portfolio.
Being Swayed by Major News Events
You’re human and have emotions. September 11, 2001, was a horrible day for
Americans (and many other people around the world) that caused some
people to panic and sell investments when the financial markets reopened.
Wars, oil price spikes, large corporate layoffs, the latest retail sales and con-
sumer confidence reports, and Federal Reserve meetings and interest rate
changes are but a few of the news reports that can move the markets.
Don’t make your investing decisions based on the news of the day. The only
action you should consider taking if doom and gloom are in the air is to con-
sider using some of your spare cash and buying when a sale is going on.
Comparing Your Funds Unfairly
While teaching adult courses and working with clients as a counselor, I’ve
witnessed many people who were disenchanted with otherwise good funds.
Often this effect was the result of their knowledge that other funds, often
seeming similar on the surface, were doing better. Perceptions changed when
these people found out that the other funds weren’t holding the same types
of securities and that their funds were actually doing fine compared with a
relevant market index (see Chapter 15).
Don’t be quick to assume that your funds aren’t doing well simply because
they’ve gone down recently or are producing lower returns than some other
funds. Compare them fairly over a long enough period (years, not months or
weeks) and then decide.

Chapter 21
Ten Fund-Investing 
Fears to Conquer
In This Chapter
 Avoiding the tendency to predict (and the anxiety that comes with it)
 Learning to relax and watch your investments grow over time
E
xperiencing the thoughts that I identify in this chapter is a sign that
you’re a normal person. But these thoughts are also something I want
you to overcome. When you do, you’re well on your way to avoiding common
painful and costly fund-investing blunders and oversights.
Investing with Little Money
You have to start somewhere. People with less to invest actually benefit more
from mutual funds than investors with heftier balances (although those
investors benefit a lot as well). With just several hundred or a few thousand
dollars to invest, you can’t diversify well or avoid commissions that gobble a
significant percentage of what you have to invest when you buy individual
securities. By investing in mutual funds, you can invest efficiently.
If you invest money for the longer term, especially inside retirement
accounts, start with a hybrid fund or a fund of funds. Some of these funds
have low minimum initial investment requirements of $1,000, and they’ll go
even lower — $50 — if you sign up for an automatic investment plan that reg-
ularly makes electronic withdrawals from your bank account. (See the exam-
ples in Chapter 13.) Invest just $1,000 today in good mutual funds and add
just $50 per month. With funds that average a 10 percent annual return, in 20
years you’ll have about $44,000! Invest over 40 years, and you’ll have about
$336,000. If you can manage $100 per month rather than $50, you’ll have
about $82,000 in 20 years and $628,000 in 40 years!

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Investing in Uninsured Funds
Lack of insurance (think FDIC on bank accounts) isn’t what makes funds
risky. Mutual fund risks are driven by the price changes of the securities,
such as bonds and stocks, that they invest in. Unlike banks and insurance
companies, mutual funds can’t go bankrupt (see Chapter 2). Funds that
invest in municipal bonds may have insurance against the default of the
bonds. Otherwise, insurance isn’t necessary or available for funds.
Don’t overlook other not-so-obvious types of risk. Bank accounts don’t carry
the price risk, or volatility that bond and stock mutual funds do. However,
bank accounts are exposed to the risk that the value of your money may not
grow fast enough to keep ahead of inflation and taxes.
If you don’t like volatility, even with money you’ve earmarked for long-term
purposes, invest more of your money in balanced or hybrid funds. These
funds tend to mask the volatility of their individual stock and bond compo-
nents because they’re all mixed together (see Chapter 12).
Rising Interest Rates
After a lengthy period of declining and stable interest rates, speculation
inevitably surfaces about when interest rates will rise. This spooks not only
some bond investors but also stock investors. Rates rarely rise when they’re
widely expected to and even when they do rise, it’s nearly impossible to
know how significantly rates will increase and what, if any, impact that will
have on the bond and stock markets.
The financial markets tend to lead these sorts of economic changes. The
stock market, for example, often peaks six months to a year before the econ-
omy does. Conversely, stock prices usually head back up in advance and in
anticipation of an actual economic recovery. Interest rates and bond prices
typically have the same kind of interaction. For example, by the time every-
one’s talking about the damage to the bond market from rising interest rates,
the bond market has usually hit bottom.
I’m not foolish enough to think that I can predict future interest and financial
market movements, and you shouldn’t think that you can, either.

Missing High Returns from Stocks
Perhaps you’ve read about how investment legends like Peter Lynch and
Warren Buffett make wise stock picks, so you figure that if you do what they
do, you can, too. (After all, a ton of books out there say that you can.)
Nothing personal, but it isn’t going to happen. You’re probably a part-time
amateur, at best. If you enjoy playing pickup basketball games, it’d be fun, if
somewhat humbling, to play against the great Michael Jordan. But I assume
that you’d play Jordan for the fun of it instead of in an expectation or vain
hope of beating him. Buying individual stocks is the same — don’t do it think-
ing that you’ll beat the better mutual fund managers.
Don’t fool yourself into thinking that you’re an expert just because you know
more than most people about a particular industry or company. Many others
have this knowledge, and if you have truly inside information that a company
is about to be acquired, for example, and you invest your money based on
this insider knowledge, you can end up with a large fine or jail sentence or
both. (See Chapter 4 for a thorough discussion about investing in stocks of
your own choosing.)
Waiting to Get a Handle on the Economy
Although I don’t advocate sticking your head in the sand, the big-picture eco-
nomic issues such as interest rates, employment, corporate profits, trade
agreements, and tax and budget reform are well beyond your (or, really,
anyone else’s) ability to accurately forecast. Besides, investors’ expectations
are already reflected in the prices of securities in the financial markets.
Read about, listen to, and absorb what’s going on in the world. But don’t use
this noise of the day to help make your investing decisions. You should deter-
mine your investment portfolio by considering your financial situation, your
personal goals, and your plans for the future (see Chapter 9).
Buying the Best-Performing Funds
Most people want to jump on board the winning bandwagon. But the best
performers all too often turn into tomorrow’s mediocre or loser funds (see
Chapter 7). Look at what happened in the early 2000s to the high-flying funds
that focused on technology and Internet stocks during the late 1990s.

Chapter 21: Ten Fund-Investing Fears to Conquer

The types of securities that do best inevitably change course. You may actu-
ally increase your chances of fund-investing success by minimizing exposure
to recent hot performers and investing more into fund types that are cur-
rently depressed but otherwise fundamentally sound.
Waiting for an Ideal Buying Opportunity
Some stock market investors like to wait for a big drop before they start
investing. This strategy seems logical, especially coming on the heels of years
of advancing prices. It also fits the philosophy of buying when prices are dis-
counted. The problem is, how do you know when the decline is over? A 10
percent drop? 20 or 30 percent? If you’re waiting for a 20 percent drop and
the market only drops 15 percent before it then rises 100 percent over the
coming years, you’ll miss out. If you’re waiting for a 40 percent decline, will
you really have the courage to invest if that happens?
Especially if you’re just starting to save and invest money, invest regularly so
that, if prices drop, you’ll buy some at lower prices. That way, if prices don’t
decline, you won’t miss out on the advance. If you have a large amount of
money awaiting investment, move it gradually (dollar-cost averaging) — a
portion every month or quarter over a year or two into different types of
funds (see Chapter 9).
Obsessing Over Your Funds
There’s a big difference between monitoring and obsessing. You don’t need to
follow the daily price changes of your mutual funds, which is an incomplete
and often misleading way to discern the amount of return from your fund. In
addition to share price changes, you must take into account dividend and
capital gains distributions when you calculate a fund’s performance (see
Chapter 15).
Tracking and hovering over your funds increases your chances of panicking
and making emotionally based decisions. The investors I know who bail out
when prices are down almost always are the ones who follow prices too
closely. Keep your sights on the big picture — why you bought the fund in
the first place and what financial goal you’re trying to fulfill. To reduce your
risk and sleep soundly at night, diversify.
356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Thinking You’ve Made a Bad Decision
Don’t be so hard on yourself. Invest in the funds that I recommend in this
book and use good selection criteria in picking funds on your own. Then, if
one of your funds goes down, the decline is — 99 times out of 100 — because
the types of securities it focuses on (for example, bonds, United States
stocks, or international stocks) are down.
If, for example, your fund is down about 5 percent over the past year, find out
how similar funds have done over the same time period. If the average com-
parable fund is down more than 5 percent, you have cause to be happy; if
comparable funds are up an average of 20 percent, you have reason to worry.
See Chapter 15 for some ground rules for deciding whether to dump or hold a
laggard fund.
Lacking in Performance
Stop looking at fund performance top-ten lists. Most of these lists completely
ignore risk. Many of these lists rank funds based on short time periods. The
funds on top are constantly changing. And no one knows which ones will be
on next year’s top-ten list.
If a fund is taking so much risk that it’s in the top-ten list, then such a status
also means that it’s risky enough to end up in the bottom-ten list someday.
(See the examples in Chapter 7.) The categories that are used in these types
of lists are also flawed, because many of the funds aren’t really comparable.
Read Chapter 15 to find out appropriate ways to evaluate and track the per-
formance of your funds.

Ten Tips on Hiring a 
Financial Adviser
In This Chapter
 Knowing what services to expect and how much you pay
 Hiring someone you can count on
M
illions of people have successfully invested in mutual funds on their own.
The vast majority of these folks were like you. Investing in mutual funds
isn’t difficult; common sense and an ounce of financial sense is all you need.
You have no compelling reason to hire someone like me or another financial
adviser in order to invest in mutual funds. So if you jumped to this chapter
first, stop! I recommend that you march back to the earlier chapters. You’ll be
better able to understand this chapter after you’ve read the ones that come
before it, not to mention the fact that you’ll be improving your ability to save
yourself possibly thousands of dollars in financial advisory fees. But if you’ve
arrived here because you just don’t want to deal with handling fund-investing
or financial-planning decisions on your own, keep on keepin’ on.
Communicator or Obfuscator?
In your preliminary meetings with a financial adviser, develop a sense and
opinion about the person’s ability to clearly communicate with you. Take
your time and speak with prospective advisers before deciding whom to hire.
Don’t rush yourself or allow an adviser to pressure you into making a deci-
sion before you’re ready and comfortable. Consider these questions: Does he
clearly and patiently explain things or use a lot of jargon and talk down to
you? Is he forthright and candid or evasive?

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Financial Planner or Money Manager?
As you search for help, you’ll confront a variety of people who call them-
selves “advisers” and who’re eager to assist you with investing and other
financial matters. People who claim to be advisers but who derive commis-
sions from the products that they sell are salespeople (Chapter 8). Keep this
warning in mind as you consider the different types of help:
 Financial planner: True financial planners generally provide objective
help with issues, such as retirement planning, using and paying off of
debt, investing, insurance, and even real estate. The charge for these
services should be a fee based on the time involved. A good planner
should help restructure your financial situation before your money gets
invested in funds. If a planner provides specific fund recommendations,
implement them on your own and save yourself ongoing advisory fees.
 Money managers: Money managers or financial advisers who perform
money management invest your money and charge you a fee — usually
expressed as a percentage of assets under management (that’s the
money you turn over to them to manage). Some advisers only do money
management, but increasing numbers of financial planners offer money-
management services as well. Using money managers can make sense
for people who’ve finished their planning and need someone to help
manage their money. Money managers argue that, because they devote
themselves full time to investing, they’re more adept at it.
Planner/money managers may be reluctant to recommend — and, in fact,
have an incentive to ignore — strategies that deplete the money you have to
invest. The more you have to invest, the greater the fees they earn. All the fol-
lowing financial moves result in less money that you can invest, so planners/
money managers may not recommend these often-advisable paths:
 Paying down debt of all types, such as credit cards, auto loans, mort-
gages, business loans, and the like
 Maximizing saving through your employer’s retirement savings plan(s)
 Purchasing more real estate — either through buying a larger primary
home or investing in rental property
 Buying and investing in your own business or someone else’s privately
held business
Another problem with planners who also manage money is that they may
be short on specific advice in the planning process. Sadly, I’ve seen cases in
which people paid planners thousands of dollars for a large boilerplate
computer-generated financial plan and received little, if any, specific financial

planning and investment advice. If you want to invest in no-load funds, the
planner should willingly and happily provide specific fund recommendations
and help you build a portfolio for the fee that you pay her.
Active or Passive Management?
Much of what you’re paying a planner for is the time spent reviewing your
financial situation and matching your needs and goals to a suitable portfolio
of funds. If your needs and situation are relatively stable and you do your
homework right the first time and select good mutual funds, you shouldn’t
need to make frequent changes to your portfolio.
If anything, constant tinkering with a portfolio tends to lower returns. In
Chapter 18, I cover this same issue on the perils of blindly following some
newsletters’ and gurus’ timing advice to switch into this fund and out of that
one. Trading in nonretirement accounts also increases your tax burden.
Who’s in Control?
If you hire a money manager, you should consider if the manager requires
that you turn control of the account over to him. Specifically, you’ll sign or
initial a form, as shown in Figure 22-1. Here’s the outline of the form:
 Line 1: Grants the adviser authority to execute trades in your account —
otherwise known as granting a limited power of attorney.
 Line 2: Gives your adviser power to move money out of your account. I
recommend against giving your adviser this power unless you need to
withdraw money from your account frequently and find it more conve-
nient to have your adviser do it for you.
 Line 3: Allows your adviser to deduct his ongoing fees from the account.
Definitely do not allow this deduction to be taken from retirement
accounts because it diminishes the amount of money that you have
compounding tax deferred. (But, unless you’re already well into retire-
ment and taking plan distributions, paying fees from your retirement
account may be okay — you’re paying with before-tax dollars that would
otherwise be withdrawn and taxed.) For nonretirement accounts, it’s up
to you, although many advisers insist on this feature to make collecting
their fees easier.
 Line 4: Requests the brokerage firm to send duplicate copies of your
account statements and trade confirmations to your adviser. That’s
acceptable and to be expected.
361
Chapter 22: Ten Tips on Hiring a Financial Adviser

Source: Charles Schwab & Company, Inc.
Almost all money managers manage money on what’s called a discretionary
basis — they make decisions to buy and sell funds without your prior
approval. In other words, you’re turning control over to them. You find out
about transactions after they’ve occurred, usually when you receive the trade
confirmations in the mail and through your monthly or quarterly statement.
At a minimum, before you turn control over to the money manager, make
sure that you discuss your investment objectives with him. These overall
goals should drive the way he manages your money.
Fees: What’s Your Advice Going to Cost?
If you hire a planner on an hourly basis, expect to pay at least $100 per hour —
you can easily pay more; planners with the $300+ per-hour billing rates tend to
work exclusively with affluent clients. See this fee schedule example:
Amount You Invest
Fee Percentage
Annual Fee
$1,000,000
1.10%
$11,000
$2,000,000
1.00%
$20,000
$5,000,000
0.90%
$45,000
What’s amazing to me about this type of fee schedule is that, although the
percentage charge declines slightly as the amount you invest increases, look
at how the total charges increase. This firm sends the same quarterly reports
out to the client with $5 million invested, who pays $45,000 per year, as it
does to the client with $1,000,000 invested, who pays $11,000 per year for the
same service. Advisers’ fees are often negotiable. The more you have to
invest, the greater your ability should be to negotiate lower fees.

362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Also, ask what sort of transaction and other fees you have to pay in addition
to the advisory fee paid to the money manager. Most money managers ask
that you establish an account at one of the discount brokerage firms, such as
Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, or with a mutual fund company. Ask who
they use and why. If you’re going to consider hiring a mutual fund money
manager, add up all the costs. Table 22-1 helps you do the job.

this amount because the funds she uses vary 
over time — she can base the calculation on
her current portfolio or the amount she used 
over the past year.)
Transaction and other fees
For example, 0.2%
Total
For example, 2.2%
Over the long haul, a diversified portfolio that’s primarily invested in stocks
has usually returned around 10 percent annually. If you’re paying a total of 2.5
percent to have your money managed, you’re giving away 25 percent of your
expected return. And don’t forget, because the IRS sure won’t, that you’ll owe
taxes on your nonretirement account profits, so you’re giving away an even
greater percentage of your after-tax returns.
How Do You Make Investing Decisions?
Throughout this book, I discuss the good and bad ways people can and have
invested in mutual funds over the years (Chapter 7, in particular). The
process isn’t rocket science — it can be as simple as picking any other prod-
uct or service. You want value — where can you invest in funds that meet
your needs and that are managed by a fund company and fund managers that
have good track records and that charge competitive fees. Most advisers try
to factor their economic expectations and prognostications into their invest-
ment strategies. But this is much easier said than done.
The fundamental problem with some money managers is they try to convince
you that they have a crystal ball. Specifically, some claim (explicitly or implic-
itly) that they can time the markets, that they’ll get you out of the market
before it falls and put your money back in time for the next rise. Over long
363
Chapter 22: Ten Tips on Hiring a Financial Adviser

time periods, beating the markets is virtually impossible, even for acknowl-
edged experts (see Chapter 18). Great investors, such as Warren Buffett and
Peter Lynch, say you can’t time the markets. Believe ’em!
What’s Your Track Record?
Mutual fund companies must have their performance records audited and
reviewed by the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC). Most also provide an independent auditor’s report. Private money
managers face no such SEC requirement. Few provide independent audits. Of
course, you really want to know the performance facts about the money man-
ager who you’re considering for ongoing management of your funds. What
rate of return has he earned year by year? How has he done in up and down
markets? How much risk has he taken, and how have his funds performed
versus comparable benchmarks (see Chapter 15)? These are important ques-
tions. Getting objective and meaningful answers from most investment advis-
ers who manage money on an ongoing basis is difficult.
Money managers play a number of marketing games to pump themselves up.
If all the money managers are telling the truth, 99 percent of them have
beaten the market averages, avoided major market plunges over the years,
and just happened to be in the best-performing funds last year. Money man-
agers pump up their supposed past performance to seduce you into turning
your money over to them through common marketing ploys:
 Select accounts: If you can get the money manager to give you perfor-
mance numbers and charts, too often an asterisk refers you to some
microscopic footnote somewhere. If you have a magnifying glass handy,
you can see that the asterisk states something like select or sample
accounts. What this term means, and what they should’ve said instead is
“We picked the accounts where we did best, used the performance num-
bers from those, and ignored the rest.” (Interestingly, using smaller type
in this way is a violation of SEC regulations.) Advisory firms also may
select the time periods when they look best. Finally, and most flagrantly,
some firms simply make up the numbers.
 Free services: Some money managers will produce performance numbers
that imply that they’re giving their services away. Remember, money man-
agers charge a fee (a percentage of assets) for their services — they
should deduct these fees (according to SEC regulations) from the returns
that you earned to clearly show the amount that you, as an investor using
their services, would’ve made. Because most money managers place their
fund trades through discount brokers who charge transaction fees, they
should deduct these fees from returns as well.
 Bogus benchmarks: Some money managers make their performance num-
bers higher than they really are; some also try to make themselves look
good in relation to the overall market by comparing their performance
364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

numbers to inappropriate benchmarks. For example, money managers
who invest worldwide (including in international stocks) may compare
their investment performance only to the lowest-returning U.S.-based
indexes.
 Switching into (yesterday’s) stars: Money managers don’t want to send
out updates that show that they’re sitting on yesterday’s losers and
missed out on yesterday’s winners. So guess what? They may sell the
losers and buy into yesterday’s winners, creating the illusion that
they’re more on top of the market than they are. (Some newsletters also
engage in this practice.) This strategy, known as window dressing, is
potentially dangerous because they may be making a bad situation
worse by selling funds that have already declined and buying into others
after they’ve soared (not to mention possibly increasing transaction and
tax costs).
What Are Your Qualifications 
and Training?
An adviser should have experience in the investing or financial services field —
generally, the more the better. But also look for someone with intelligence and
ethics who can converse with you in plain English.
Check out credentials but don’t be overly impressed by some, such as the
CFP (Certified Financial Planning) degree. Many planners with this “creden-
tial,” which you can largely earn by taking a self-study course at home, sell
financial products. Other common credentials include
 CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst): This credential means that the
adviser knows how to analyze securities and investments and the funda-
mentals of portfolio management.
 MBA (Master of Business Administration): An adviser with an MBA
should’ve had coursework dealing with investments and finance. Find
out where he earned the MBA and check out the school’s reputation.
 PFS (Personal Financial Specialist): A PFS is a credential conferred on
accountants who pass an exam similar to the CFP. Those folks with the
PFS are less likely to work on commission the way many CFPs do.
 CLU (Chartered Life Underwriter) and ChFC (Chartered Financial
Consultant): These credentials are for insurance and carry little, if any,
value in advising on mutual funds. These credentials may be a red flag
that you’re dealing with a salesperson or with someone who knows
more about insurance than investments.
The term Registered Investment Adviser denotes that the adviser is registered
with the SEC. The SEC doesn’t require a test; however, it does require that the
365
Chapter 22: Ten Tips on Hiring a Financial Adviser

adviser file Form ADV, also known as the Uniform Application for Investment
Adviser Registration. This document asks for specific information from
investment advisers, such as a breakdown of the sources of their income,
relationships and affiliations with other companies, each adviser’s educa-
tional and employment history, the types of securities the firm recommends,
and the firm’s fee schedule. (Many states require passing a securities exam,
such as a Series 2, 63, or 65.)
In a pitch over the phone or in marketing materials sent by mail, an adviser
may gloss over or avoid certain issues. Although it’s possible for an adviser
to lie on Form ADV, it’s likely that an adviser will be more truthful on this
form than in marketing materials. Ask the adviser to send you a copy of his
Form ADV, or visit the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. You can also call them
at (202) 551-8090 or fax your request to (202) 777-1027.
What Are Your References?
Ask other people about how the adviser benefited them. This process is one
way to verify the rates of return the adviser may claim (although you’re
smart enough to recognize that the adviser will refer you to the clients
who’ve done the best with her). Also ask about the adviser’s strengths and
weaknesses.
Virtually all money managers offer a free introductory consultation if you
meet their minimum investment requirements. Planners who work on com-
mission also tend to offer free sessions. So the “free” consultation ends up
being a sales pitch to convince you to buy certain products or services.
Busy advisers who charge by the hour usually can’t afford to burn their time
for a free in-person session. Don’t let this deter you; this fee is probably a
good sign. These advisers should be willing, however, to spend time on the
phone answering background questions free of charge. They should also
send background materials and provide references if you ask.
Do You Carry Liability Insurance?
Some advisers may be surprised by the question of liability insurance or may
think that you’re a problem customer looking for a lawsuit. On the other
hand, if your adviser gets you into some disasters, you’ll be happy you have
the insurance coverage. Financial planners and money managers should
carry liability insurance (sometimes called errors and omission insurance).
This coverage provides you (and the adviser) with protection in case a major
mistake is made for which the adviser is liable.
