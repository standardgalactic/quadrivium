Introduction
T
he term “best of both worlds” has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it? All the
sugary taste without the carbs. A roomy SUV that gets great gas mileage.
An all-in-one-kitchen-knife-bought-from-an-infomercial-for-just-three-easy-
payments that actually works. 
When you think about creating a Web site for yourself or your business, you
undoubtedly want the “best of both worlds” principle to apply here as well.
You want to be able to create a really cool Web site by yourself without being
forced to get a graduate degree in Web programming or computer human
interface design. 
Yahoo! SiteBuilder is a highly popular software tool for people who want to
do just that. Using SiteBuilder, you can create a Web site that looks far more
sophisticated than many low-end, design-in-a-browser alternatives but with-
out diving deep into the nitty-gritty details of something called HyperText
Markup Language (HTML). 
Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies serves as your friendly tour guide to help you
create, design, and manage your SiteBuilder Web site. It gives you just the
information you need to know to create “wicked cool” sites without resorting
to that geeky stuff. 
Using the dynamic duo of Yahoo! SiteBuilder and Yahoo! SiteBuilder For
Dummies, you can make the “best of both words” goal a reality. But why stop
there? I have so many more euphemisms and trite sayings to conquer with
this combo. You’ll have your cake and eat it too. Your rolling stone will start
to gather moss. Your watched pot will actually boil. Your road-crossing
chicken will . . . well, you get the idea.
Conventions Used in This Book
Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies is one book that doesn’t bow to convention
or even bow at conventions (unless free food is involved). But I follow some
usual practices to make life easier for you. 

Text formatting 
I use the following formatting conventions: 
 Italics are used for term definitions.
 Boldface is used to indicate words that you’re supposed to type. 
 Monofont text is used for Web addresses; text that you see on-screen;
and, on very rare occasions, JavaScript or HTML programming code. 
Commands
When referring to a menu item inside of Yahoo! SiteBuilder, I use a shortcut.
For example, I abbreviate the Copy command on the Edit menu to Edit➪Copy.
Also, when I suggest pressing two keys at the same time, such as the Ctrl key
and the C key, I use a plus sign like this: Ctrl+C. 
What You’re Forbidden to Read
In this book, you explore what you need to know to create great-looking Web
sites with Yahoo! SiteBuilder. However, on your first reading of this book, I do
cover some topics that you are absolutely, positively forbidden to read. —
okay, okay, not forbidden, just topics that you can feel free to skip if you want
to. The sections that you have an official waiver for skipping are
 Any text that is marked with the Technical Stuff icon. Paragraphs with
this icon are more technical in nature. It is undoubtedly fascinating infor-
mation, but you won’t miss anything if you gloss over it. 
 Sidebars. The shaded boxes that you see scattered throughout the 
book are like espresso bars you pass on your way home from the office:
Stopping for a cappuccino or two is fine, but your trip home takes a lot
longer if you stop at every one (not to mention how wired you’ll be on
arrival at your house).

Foolish Assumptions
In Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies, I assume that you have basic knowledge 
of how to use Microsoft Windows and get around the Web with a popular
browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, I don’t assume that
you have any prior know-how involving the creation of Web sites when you
start the book. 
How This Book Is Organized
Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies is divided into five parts. 
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder
As you start your tour of Yahoo! SiteBuilder, you get to know the software and
the basics of creating and publishing a Web site. You also focus on how to
design a site so that it looks good and is easy to navigate. I give special atten-
tion to how you can design your Web site effectively using Yahoo!
SiteBuilder’s built-in templates. 
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages
While Part I focuses on the design of your Web site, Part II looks at the con-
tent that goes into your Web pages. You dive into the basic building blocks 
of Web pages: text, links, pictures, tables, navigation bars, and forms. 
Part III: Going Further: Developing
“Wicked Cool” Web Pages
In Part III, you discover how to add cool functionality to your site — such as
Yahoo! Search, Yahoo! Directions, and page effects — but I show you how to
do so without making these features look gimmicky.

Introduction

Part IV: Managing Your Web Site
Designing and creating your Web site may be your major task at the start, but
after you get your site up and running, you need to effectively manage it. Part
IV looks at how to manage your Yahoo! SiteBuilder Web site through the Yahoo!
Web Hosting Control Panel. Finally, you tackle the world of e-commerce, look-
ing at how to turn your Web site into an electronic storefront.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the final part, you get quick tips for effective Web site design and tricks
and techniques for using Yahoo! SiteBuilder. 
About the CD
The CD tucked inside the back cover of this book is loaded with a full version
of Yahoo! SiteBuilder 2.2, along with a complete bundle of SiteBuilder tem-
plates. (Talk about convenient!) For more CD details — including installation
stuff — check out this book’s appendix.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout the book, you’ll be bedazzled with nifty little icons that are
beside important paragraphs. These pictures indicate special kinds of infor-
mation that you’ll find amazingly useful: 
The Tip icon points you to key techniques, tidbits, or shortcuts that can save
you time and effort. 
The Remember icon draws attention to something in the text that is absolutely,
positively, definitively, kind of, sort of important. What’s more, if you have a
photographic mind and love memorizing entire sections of text, I recommend
focusing your mental skills on these particular paragraphs. 
The Warning icon means “Pay attention, buddy! Or you will run into trouble!”
Heed these warnings to save yourself from falling into the pit of Web site
despair.

Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies 

The Technical Stuff icon highlights nonessential but interesting stuff that no
one but geeks and geek-wanna-bes really cares about. 
Where to Go from Here
My guess is that you are so mesmerized by this book’s prose by now that you
want nothing more than to keep reading from cover to cover. If you do, you’ll
find the topics are ordered logically. However, Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies
is designed as a reference book, so you don’t have to read the book from
start to finish. If you have a specific topic that you want to immediately dive
into, consider the following jumping-off points:
 To install Yahoo! SiteBuilder, check out Chapter 1.
 For a basic overview of the Web site publishing process, skip to 
Chapter 2.
 To create a Web site that will make the industry leading designers beg
you for tips, check out Chapter 3 and 16.
 To create a basic Web page, see Chapter 4.
 To use the Yahoo! SiteBuilder Control Panel, check out Chapter 14.

In this part . . .
O
ne of my least favorite activities is to go to a party or
similar gathering in which I know no one. After some
awkward introductions, I typically retreat to the corner by
myself, munching on chips, veggies, and dip, all the while
everyone around me is chatting and happily involved with
others. Many people find learning how to create a Web
site can be much like my social woes. They make an
attempt to do so, but don’t like what happens, and then
become too intimidated to try again. 
Part I helps you eliminate any awkwardness you may have
as you think about creating a Web site by yourself. To do
so, I guide you through how to use Yahoo! SiteBuilder and
the basics of creating and designing a Web site.

eitgeist. Angst. Mercedes. Porsche. I am embarrassed to say that those four
words pretty much composed the extent of my German vocabulary prior 
to a business trip to Zurich a few years back. Because of my lack of knowledge,
I felt nervous, even inadequate, about living several weeks in Switzerland,
Austria, and Germany. Oh, I’d talk to my well-traveled friends, and they’d reas-
sure me that I could learn enough of the language to get by. I even bought a
Learn-German-in-a-Day book and studied en route. But I was still tense stepping
off that plane into the unknown. 
As you start out your journey into Web site building, you may feel much the
same way I did before my European excursion. Perhaps you know a few 
terms — such as URL, domain name, JPG, and hypertext. Maybe you’ve even
talked with friends who’ve had success creating a business or personal Web
site. Perhaps you’ve even created a Web site before with one of those quick
and easy online Web builders out there but are ready for something better. 
This chapter helps you as you “step off that plane into the unknown,” so 
to speak. It helps you get acquainted with what Web publishing and Yahoo!
SiteBuilder are all about and also helps you understand the basics about 
how it all works. 
Discovering How Web Publishing Works 
Before you even start working with SiteBuilder, you should take a moment to
explore the process of Web publishing. You can think of creating, designing,
and publishing a Web site much like a director making a film. For example,
consider Peter Jackson’s well-documented saga of creating The Lord of the

Rings. He and his band of merry troops spent years filming and editing the
Tolkien classics in New Zealand. In the process, they pulled together count-
less clips from the general shoot, CGI effects, and miniature shoots to form a
single, complete film. Then, for each of the three films, an original film was
sent off and copied and then delivered to movie theaters across the world.
Moviegoers then traveled by the millions to their local cinemas to watch the
film Jackson made. 
The Web publishing model has many parallels to making a film — though 
fortunately without Orcs and Gollum trying to mess you up along the way.
You create a home Web site by pulling together information from a variety 
of sources. After you have the site ready, you publish the various parts as a
single unit to a computer that can be accessed worldwide. Then people can
flock by the millions (or the thousands or the tens) to their browsers to visit
the site you made. As you can see, the basic process for Web publishing is
 Create and design in the comforts of your home or office 
 Publish your site and go public 
 Visit your site from anywhere 
 Repeat the process for changes 
Figure 1-1 illustrates the process. I describe each step in the following 
sections. 
Creating and designing on your computer
The first step is to create and design your Web site on your desktop or laptop
computer (which I refer from here on out as your local computer). A Web site
consists of several different kind of files and resources, all of which I conve-
niently describe for you in this section. Your Web site building software, such
as SiteBuilder, then pulls all these pieces together to form a single Web site.

Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Web pages
A Web site contains one or more Web pages. A Web page is written in HTML
(HyperText Markup Language) format and has a filename with an .htm or
.html extension. An HTML file is just a normal text file, but each one con-
tains a lot of information, such as the following: 
 Text you want to display on-screen in a Web browser
 References to images, multimedia controls, and other resources that you
also want to display on a Web page
 Links to other pages
 A set of instructions that tells the browser how to arrange and display
all of this content
You can work with Web pages in two ways — using a “visual” editor that
allows you to create and edit the page visually (in the process hiding all the
complex HTML code from you) or using a “code” editor that enables you to
work directly with the HTML code itself. Some editors, such as Macromedia
Dreamweaver and Microsoft FrontPage, are hybrids and provide support for
both visual and code editing. 
SiteBuilder has a visual page editor (called the Design pane) built into it, free-
ing you from worrying about the yucky complexities of HTML. See Chapters
4, 6, and 8 for details of how to work with Web pages inside of SiteBuilder. 
Images 
The Web may have started out as a text-based world, but it has emerged as
an image-driven medium of communication. Go to any nice-looking site, and
you see all sorts of images scattered around the text. 
You can either use images you created yourself — taken with your digital
camera or drawn using a software program of some kind — or images
received from another source (though, as Chapter 7 discusses, you want to
make sure you can freely use the image). SiteBuilder’s templates, which I
explore in Chapter 5, come with many nice-looking graphical elements for
you to incorporate into your Web site design. 
Today’s Web sites often use navigation bars that incorporate both text and
graphics. Chapter 9 shows you how to create navigation bars in SiteBuilder. 
You don’t create, edit, or manipulate images inside of SiteBuilder. SiteBuilder
hands that job off to another graphics software package, such as Adobe
Photoshop, Microsoft Office Picture Manager, or even Microsoft Paint. After
you have a Web-ready image, you can add it to your Web page inside of
SiteBuilder. Once again, Chapter 7 covers all those details. 
11
Chapter 1: Yahoo! Let’s Go Site Building

Interactive elements
The Web is more than just a giant bulletin board that visitors can browse. A
visitor can also interact with the site, providing feedback, ordering products,
or requesting more information. A Web page can contain form elements, such
as edit boxes, drop-down lists, or buttons, to enable this kind of interaction.
Chapter 10 explores how to create and work with forms inside of SiteBuilder.
And if you’re interested in selling products on the Web, check out Chapter 15. 
Embedded media
While text and images make up the bulk of the content on Web pages, you
can also embed other resources in a Web page. Popular choices are video or
audio clips and Java applets. Chapter 12 discusses how to add multimedia
resources to your Web page. Finally, you can also embed HTML code and
JavaScript scripts (see Chapter 13) in your page to add functionality and 
services not provided inside SiteBuilder — such as a guestbook, news 
headlines, and stock quotes. 
Yahoo! Add-Ons
A major benefit to using SiteBuilder and Yahoo! Web hosting is that you can
incorporate Yahoo! service-oriented add-ons into your Web pages. (Add-ons
let you add neat interactive features such as a Yahoo! Map or Yahoo! Search
box into your page right inside of SiteBuilder. Chapter 11 has more on add-
ons, including how to add features to your Web site. )
Linked resources
A final batch of resources that can be part of a Web site are non-HTML docu-
ments and other files that a visitor can link to. Technically, these files don’t
appear as part of a Web page, but you link to (and open) them from other Web
pages inside of your Web site. Common examples include Adobe Acrobat (PDF)
files, PowerPoint presentations, and Microsoft Word documents. See Chapter 6
for more on how to link to these documents. 
Publishing your site 
After you create and design your site on your local computer, it’s time to go
public and publish your site to the Web. Publishing is nothing more than
copying the Web site files (Web pages, images, and anything else you have)
from your local computer to a Yahoo! computer — the computer that’s going
to act as your site’s Web server.
12
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Visiting your site from anywhere 
After you publish your Web site, it’s available for anyone in the world to
access. A Yahoo! server stores your Web site files somewhere out in cyber-
space for you to access them. Physically, it doesn’t matter where that Yahoo!
server is — it could be a facility in Sunnyvale, California; or Dallas, Texas; or
Atlanta, Georgia — all that matters is that when people type your site’s Web
address in the Address bar of their browser or click a link that goes there,
they’re accessing your Web site on that particular server. 
Repeating the process
As I discuss in Chapter 16, you’ll want to regularly update your Web site to
ensure that it doesn’t grow stale and start to grow mold. When you update
your site, you make the changes and additions in SiteBuilder on your local
computer and then republish the updates, overwriting the files that are on
the Yahoo! Web server. 
Signing Up for Yahoo! Web Hosting
Before you can publish a SiteBuilder Web site, your first step is to sign up for
Yahoo! Web hosting. Do so by following these steps: 
Make sure you have a Yahoo ID before beginning this process. 
1. With your browser, go to smallbusiness.yahoo.com. 
The Yahoo! Small Business home page makes an appearance (see 
Figure 1-2).
2. Click the Web Hosting link to begin the signup process. 
A new page appears in your browser, outlining the various Web hosting
options available to you.
3. Click the Sign Up button for the Web hosting plan that best suits your
needs. 
4. On the next page, enter the desired domain name for your Web site. 
Your domain is a unique name that identifies a Web site, such as yahoo.
com. Domain names have two or more parts separated by dots. The part
to the right of the dot represents the general type (.com, .net, .org);
the part to the left of the dot is meant to be the name that describes or
identifies your site. 
13
Chapter 1: Yahoo! Let's Go Site Building

Keep the following tips in mind: 
• Find a domain name that is unique to and descriptive of your busi-
ness, organization, interest, or yourself as much as possible. 
• Don’t include hard-to-remember abbreviations. I also don’t recom-
mend using hyphens, simply because people easily forget about
them. 
• Be descriptive, but don’t make it toooo long. 
• Above all, make your domain name easy for people to remember.
Yahoo! searches to see if your choice is still available — meaning that
nobody else has registered it before. If it is available, you can continue. If
not, you need to search again. 
5. Continue through the registration process, providing necessary pay-
ment and contact information to complete the order. 
After your order is completed, you first receive a confirmation e-mail of
your order. and then within a few hours, you receive a second e-mail let-
ting you know that your account is active and ready to roll. 
After your account is activated, you can access the Yahoo! Web Hosting
Control Panel, which I discuss in Chapter 14.

Downloading and Installing 
Yahoo! SiteBuilder
After you sign up for Yahoo! Web hosting, your next step is to download and
install SiteBuilder onto your computer. No need to wait for your account to
become active; jump right in by following these steps: 
1. With your Web browser, go to webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/sb. 
The Yahoo! SiteBuilder page displays, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
2. Click the Download SiteBuilder Today link. 
The Download page loads in your browser, at your service.
3. Click the Download link. 
If you’re not signed into your Yahoo! account, you need to enter your
Yahoo! ID and password before downloading SiteBuilder. 
4. Save the download file to an appropriate folder on your computer. 
5. When the download completes, double-click the ysitebuilder.exe
file in your download folder.

Chapter 1: Yahoo! Let's Go Site Building

6. After the Installer launches, follow the directions on-screen to install
and configure SiteBuilder. 
The installer places SiteBuilder into your Program Files directory and
adds an icon on your Windows desktop and Windows Start menu. 
Exploring Yahoo! SiteBuilder 
The rest of this book is devoted to building Web sites using SiteBuilder. But
before getting into the specifics of how to do this or do that, take a moment
to start up SiteBuilder and just get a feel for what the workspace looks like. 
Follow these steps to launch SiteBuilder and take it through its paces: 
1. Double-click the Yahoo! SiteBuilder icon on your Windows desktop. 
The main SiteBuilder window opens, as shown in Figure 1-4.
You can also launch SiteBuilder by choosing All Programs➪Yahoo!
SiteBuilder➪Yahoo! SiteBuilder from the Windows Start menu. 
For the purposes of exploring SiteBuilder, continue with the following
steps. Your focus here isn’t how to create a Web site just yet; you’re
simply exploring SiteBuilder and getting a sense of what the tool is like. 
2. In SiteBuilder, click the Create a New Site link in the Help pane on the
left.
You can use the Help pane to perform several tasks, such as create a
Web site, import a Web site you’ve already created in another program,
or open a Web site you’ve already started. 
3. Click the Start button in the Site Creation Wizard. 
The contents of the Help pane change, starting the wizard. 
4. In the Name of My Web Site box, enter dummysite. 
5. Click the Next button. 
The wizard takes you to Step 2. 
6. Click the A Blank Page option and then click the Next button. 
As shown in Figure 1-5, SiteBuilder creates a blank, single-page Web site,
enough for your exploration purposes.
With a simple site created, you can explore the different features of the
SiteBuilder workspace.
16
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

SiteBuilder panes
Your main work area is the Design pane, the center of the SiteBuilder work-
space. The Design pane enables you to create a Web page in a “point-and-click”
manner by adding different page elements to the page and then arranging them
as you wish. You can have multiple Web pages open, each one of which has a
tab at the top of the editor. See Chapters 4, 6, 7, and 8 for the full details on
working with the Design pane. 
In addition to the Design pane, you can find other panes as part of the 
workspace:
 Site Contents: The Site Contents pane shows you a folder view of your
Web site contents, including Web pages (.html files), clip art graphics,
sounds, and other files you have as part of your site. Chapter 4 shows
you how to use the Site Contents pane to manage all your Web site
resources. 
 Preview: The Preview pane displays the currently selected item in the
Site Contents pane. If nothing is selected, it displays the current page in
the Design pane. 
Figure 1-4:

17
Chapter 1: Yahoo! Let's Go Site Building

 Page Effects: Some effects you can add to your page, such as a bouncing
image or a background sound, don’t display in the Design pane. That’s
because they’re event-based effects that kick in when the page is being
viewed “live” in the browser. Placeholders represent these effects in the
Page Effects pane. Chapter 12 tells you all about how to work with page
effects. 
 Help: The Help panel serves as the go-to place within SiteBuilder, allow-
ing you to access the User Guide and other helpful information. 
SiteBuilder toolbar
Just like in any Windows application, commands are available from the 
top menu, toolbar, contextual menus, and even keyboard shortcuts. In this
book, I refer most often to the toolbar (see Figure 1-6), though you can use
whichever of these options you prefer.

The toolbar contains the commands you use most often during the Web site
building process. These include the following: 
 New Page without Template creates a new blank page. 
 New Page with Template creates a new page based on a template you
specify. 
 New Site launches the Site Creation Wizard. 
 Open Page allows you to open a page in your Web site. 
 Save Page saves changes to the active Web page in your site. 
 Preview in Browser displays the active Web page in your default Web
browser. 
 Properties shows the properties for the active page element in the
Design pane. 
 Cut deletes the selection and places it on the Clipboard. 
 Copy adds the selection to the Clipboard. 
 Paste inserts the contents of the Clipboard into the current page or page
element. 
 Delete removes the selection without adding it to the Clipboard. 
 Undo undoes the last action you made. 
 Redo redoes the action that you undid. 
 Insert Text adds a text element to the middle of the current page. 
 Insert Image adds an image element to the current page. 
 Insert Background adds a background color or image to your current
page and adds a Background icon to the Page Effects pane. 
 Insert Navigation Bar displays a drop-down list of navigation bars avail-
able for your site or an option to create a new navigation bar.

Chapter 2
Publishing Your First Site: 
Around the World (Wide 
Web) in 16 Minutes 
In This Chapter
 Creating a site from scratch and publishing it in minutes 
 Discovering the basic processes of Web site publishing
P
hileas Fogg is so “last century.” (Or was it the century before that?) It
took him 80 days to make his way around the world. That timeframe
may have been impressive in his day, but you and I can take a circumnaviga-
tional supersonic flight around the world in far less than 80 hours, let alone
days. So, too, in the early days of the Web, site builders would have to spend
several hours or days hand-coding their Web pages and then copying these
files onto a server using some geeky FTP tool. In contrast, using SiteBuilder,
you can create a nice-looking Web site presence in a mere 16 minutes. In fact,
I show you how to do that in this chapter. 
Of course, as you work with SiteBuilder on your actual site, you’ll want to
spend much more time and energy thoughtfully designing, producing con-
tent, and fine-tuning your site. But you’ll be glad to know that the mechanics
of creating a SiteBuilder Web site are as quick as reading just a few pages
from a Jules Verne classic. 
In this chapter, I’m your personal valet — or, keeping with the Phileas Fogg
imagery, your Passepartout — to help you make it around the world of Web
site publishing before Big Ben strikes the stroke of midnight. 
Getting Started in Web Publishing
The purpose of this chapter is to get you comfortable with the basic mechan-
ics of Web publishing by introducing you to each of the major steps that you

take in creating and publishing a Web site. I won’t explain these steps in
detail; that’s what the rest of the book is all about! However, I think as you 
go through this exercise in Web publishing, you become better equipped 
to get your hands around exactly what Web site publishing is all about. 
Before starting your little road race, you need to have two steps done (both
of which I tell you about in Chapter 1):
 Signed up for a Yahoo! Web Hosting Plan. 
 Launched SiteBuilder. 
After you do those two tasks, get out your stopwatch, and get ready to let out
the clutch.
Stop #1: Creating a Web Site 
with the Site Creation Wizard
Estimated Time: 4 minutes
Your first stop on your Around the Web Tour is to create a new Web site using
SiteBuilder. SiteBuilder walks you through a step-by-step process using its
Site Creation Wizard. After you finish your process, your Web site pages are
created and ready for editing. 
So go ahead and do the following to get the show on the road:
1. From the Help pane inside of SiteBuilder, click the Create a New Site
link, as shown in Figure 2-1.
The Help pane updates to display the opening page of the Site Creation
Wizard.
2. In the opening page of the Site Creation Wizard, click the Start button
to continue. 
The Help pane updates to show the next step in the site creation
process, as shown in Figure 2-2.
3. Enter My First Site or any other appropriate name in the Name of My
Web Site text box. 
The site you create in this chapter is for instructional purposes only, so
just indicate that in the name you choose. 
4. Click the Next button to continue. 
The Help pane once again updates, ending up with what you see in
Figure 2-3.

Chapter 2: Publishing Your First Site

5. Stick with the default A Template option, and click the Next button. 
The Help pane updates to allow you to select the template of your
choice. (See Figure 2-4. )
The Templates list displays the available templates, both ones that
you’ve downloaded to your computer all ready as well as ones that have
not yet been downloaded. For the Around the Web Tour, choose one that
comes with SiteBuilder. 
6. Select Business from the Template Categories drop-down list. 
7. Select the Consulting – Blue template from the Templates list box. 
Don’t worry if you’re not a consulting company or don’t like the tem-
plate design; you can always change it immediately after this exercise. 
8. Click Next to continue. 
The Help pane updates to display the last page of the wizard, as shown
in Figure 2-5.

Chapter 2: Publishing Your First Site

This screen helps you determine which pages of your site you want
SiteBuilder to create for you at this time. For the Around the Web Tour,
you can narrow it down to just three initial pages: the Home Page, the
About Us Page, and the Contact Us Page.
9. Uncheck the Services Page box. 
If you own a small business, the Services page comes in handy for
describing your company’s services. For this step-by-step example, how-
ever, you don’t need to include this page. 
10. Click the Next button to create your Web site. 
SiteBuilder creates your Web site, opens each page inside the Design
pane, and displays the Web site in the Site Contents pane. Figure 2-6
shows the final results. 
For the full scoop on creating and working with your Web site, see Chapter 3.

Stop #2: Editing Your Pages
Estimated Time: 7 minutes 
Your second stop on the Around the Web Tour is the Design pane, where you
can edit the three pages that SiteBuilder created for you as part of your Web
site. You can do four basic page-building tasks here: editing text, deleting text
elements, adding an image, and creating a link. 
To edit your home page 
1. Click the index.html tab at the top of the Design pane. 
The tabs allow you to move between your open pages. The index.html
page is the home page for the Web site. 
Take a look around at the various elements that appear on the page,
including the text banner, navigation bar, text boxes for descriptive text,
and images. Figure 2-7 shows the page before you make any changes.
2. Click the Your Company Name Here text box to select it. 
Figure 2-7:

3. Select all the text with your mouse. 
Alternatively, if you’re up for it, you can triple-click inside the box to
select all the text. 
4. Type XYZ Creations over the selected text. 
Feel free to use your own company or personal name instead. 
5. Click the topmost text element (box) in the content area of the page to
select it.
6. Overwrite the Page Name Here (Home) text with a welcome message,
such as Welcome to XYZ Creations.
7. Select the Paragraph Title Here (What’s New?) text, and press the
Delete key. Press Delete once more to get rid of the blank line. 
In doing so, you are deleting the extra sample text that you don’t need
for these simple steps. 
8. Overwrite the sample paragraph text with a “coming soon” message,
such as Coming soon. Web site under construction. Check back after I
finish reading Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies. 
9. Remove the rest of the sample text in the text element. 
SiteBuilder provides sample text to help you get started on your home
page. You can delete the extra text elements for this exercise.
10. Select the text box underneath the one you just modified, and press
the Delete key. Repeat this process for the other two elements. 
Your basic vanilla home page is ready. It should look something like
what you see in Figure 2-8. 
To edit your About Us page
1. Click the aboutus.html tab on the top of the Design pane. 
The About Us page makes an appearance. 
2. Double-click the About Our Business text element to edit the text
inside it. 
3. Leave the About Our Business heading as is, and overwrite the
remainder of the text with XYZ Creations is the leading provider of
XYZs in the world.
Or, if you’re describing your actual business, modify the text of this
paragraph as you like. However, because your tour is on a tight sched-
ule, I recommend keeping it to just a sentence or two. 
4. Resize the text element box to fit the amount of text inside of it.
To do so, first click the blue handle on the bottom middle of the text box
and (while keeping your mouse button down) drag the box to the appro-
priate size; then release your mouse button.

See Chapter 6 for more on creating links in SiteBuilder. 
Your Web site is now ready to go. Notice that I ignored talking about the 
navigation bar (a graphical bar of links in your site) on the left-hand side 
of the pages. That’s because SiteBuilder already set up the links for you. 
Before continuing, choose File➪Save All Pages to save all the pages in your
site. 
Stop #3: Previewing Your Site
Estimated Time: 2 minutes 
Your third stop on the Around the Web Tour is a preview of your site before
you publish. SiteBuilder enables you to open your Web site inside your
browser before publishing. This preview feature allows you to catch mistakes
before you actually “go live” with your Web site. 
To preview your site
1. Click the Preview in Browser button on the toolbar. 
SiteBuilder opens the current page shown in the Design pane in your
default Web browser. 
2. Click each of the pages in the navigation bar to view each of them. 
Under normal circumstances, you spend a lot of time going back and forth
between designing your Web site and previewing it and testing it and redesign-
ing your Web site and previewing it and testing it and . . . you get the point. 
Stop #4: Publishing Your Site 
to Yahoo! Web Hosting
Estimated Time: 2 minutes, 59 seconds 
Now that you’ve created your site, edited your pages, and previewed your
site locally, you’re ready for the home stretch of the Around the Web Tour.
And looking at the clock, you’ve not a moment to spare! Follow these steps 
to complete the experience:
1. Choose File➪Publish to Yahoo! Site from the main menu (or just click
the Publish Site button on the toolbar). 
32

2. Enter your Yahoo! ID and password in the Sign In to Yahoo! dialog
box and then click OK. 
The Publish Site dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-14. 
3. Click the Publish All Files option. 
4. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder starts the transfer process and notifies you when the publish
is complete. (See Figure 2-15.)

 Evaluating your site
P
oor Karl Marx; the man was misdirected. He sought revolution through
the political and economic systems when all along, he should have been
a geek and invented the Web. Everybody knows that the Web has become
the great equalizer. (Hmmm, does that make Web surfing “the opiate of the
masses?”) 
Indeed, whether you’re a “mom and pop” shop or a large global conglomerate,
the Web levels the playing field. Yes, the “big boys” can spend megabucks on
advertising, focus groups, and faster servers. But in spite of those advantages,
you don’t need that much to put together a Web site that is every bit as 
effective. 
In this chapter, you explore some of the basic practices you should under-
take as you start to build your Web site. This chapter is all about the upfront
work you should think about before you jump in and use SiteBuilder. Then,
after you have a handle on this preliminary stuff, you’re ready to create
something I call a purpose-driven Web site — one that unifies the visual
design, content, site organization, and messaging to reach the people you
most want to reach. 
Use this chapter in combination with Chapter 16. While I cover the upfront
issues to consider in Web site design here, Chapter 16 explores very practical
tips that you should be aware of as you are in the midst of creating, design-
ing, and publishing your SiteBuilder Web site. 

Creating a Purpose-Driven Site
The single most important factor to keep in mind as you work with
SiteBuilder is to create a site that is driven by a specific purpose. If you just
start creating a site without this upfront effort, your site (and its effective-
ness) can suffer as a result. You don’t have to spend a lot of time and money
in research, focus groups, and the like. Instead, simply carve out a few hours
from your schedule, and devote that time to exploring what you want out of
your Web site. You’ll be glad you put the effort into it. 
As you do so, consider the following issues: 
 Identify a specific purpose: If you’re taking the time and effort to learn
how to use SiteBuilder to create a Web site, you must have a reason.
Identify your purpose and your goals. If you have a business site, are you
trying to attract new customers? Or are you trying to better serve your
existing ones? Or are you trying to provide a balance between the two? 
After you identify your site’s purpose, gear every part of the Web site
toward achieving that purpose — including understanding what your
priorities are, what your messaging should be, and what Yahoo! add-on
features and templates you want. 
 Define your target visitor: Consider who is going to be most interested
in coming to your site. Develop a list of various types of people and then
narrow it down to just one or two archetypes. After you identify the kind
of visitor you expect your Web site to attract, most of the questions con-
cerning what kind of design, content, and services you want to offer
simply fall into place.
Don’t forget to consider the technical expertise and technology-adoption
behavior of the target visitor. Your understanding of the target visitor in
this area is sure to have an impact on your site design. 
Make sure you account for people coming to your site with disabilities. 
 Give a professional feel to your site: As Chapter 16 stresses, one of the
most important objectives is to create a professional-looking Web site.
But unless you’re targeting stuffy old Ivy League professor types, “pro-
fessional” doesn’t mean stuffy and stiff-collared. Instead, professional
simply means “well done.”
 Define a “presence:” After you consider your site’s purpose and target
audience, identify the way in which you want your Web site to appear to
visitors, and develop an aura throughout your Web site that supports
that objective. Consider the following potential “tones:”
• Conservative and traditional 
• No-nonsense and practical 
• Informal and friendly 
• Avant-garde and cutting-edge 
36
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Tailor every visual element on your Web site toward this decision,
including
• The SiteBuilder template you standardize on. (See Chapter 5.) 
• The graphic style. (Photos can convey a more conservative tone,
while clip art and illustrations are effective in creating an informal
aura.) 
• The writing style. 
• The visual elements. (Conservative and friendlier sites need to pro-
vide intuitive labels and navigation, while a cutting-edge site can
have an aura of mystery by taking a more abstract approach.)
 Evaluate competing sites: As you consider your own purpose-driven
site, take a look around the Web at sites that directly or indirectly com-
pete with yours. How effective are they at communicating to a similar
target visitor? What mistakes do they make that you can avoid? 
Bookmark these sites you find, and see how their Web sites evolve over
time. 
Organizing Your Site 
Web sites can be logically thought of as hierarchies or as pyramid-like struc-
tures. Your home page is at the top of the heap, with three to six second-level
sections, and subsections within each of these. Therefore, as you begin plan-
ning your Web site, you need to give forethought to the hierarchical structure
of your Web site. The hierarchy helps you determine which pages to include
on your navigation bar, what pages to bundle together in separate sections,
and how the visitor can navigate through your Web site. 
For example, consider the following structures of two basic sites, shown in
Figures 3-1 and 3-2.

Chapter 3: Building a Purpose-Driven Web Site

Pictures are sometimes worth a thousand words, but now and then the best
way to grasp a concept is to read some solid prose. For some solid ideas on
how best to organize your site, read on to the end of this section.
Mocking up your site structure 
The best way to define your Web site structure is to develop a list of all
potential pages, topics, or services you wish to include. As you brainstorm,
ask yourself what the target visitor should expect to find when arriving at
your home page. 
After you have a working list of ideas, mock up your site, using either a low-
tech or high-tech option: 
 Old-fashioned index cards. Get a stack of 4 x 6 index cards, and write
down these major topics or pages you wish to include in your site. Then
spread them out on a table, look for logical groupings, and begin to orga-
nize them into a hierarchy. A natural hierarchy begins to develop as you
see the various pages and topics presented to you in this manner. 
 Charting software. If you just can’t imagine the thought of doing a cre-
ative task away from your computer, then use any charting software you
may have to create a hierarchical chart. Visio is a popular package, but
that’s really overkill. Instead, if you have Microsoft PowerPoint, use its
built-in Organization Chart tool. This easy-to-use tool (see Figure 3-3)
gives you an ideal visual aid to assist in creating your Web site structure.

Filling in the missing pieces
After you define the basic structure, you want to identify additional Web site
pages or features that may not immediately show up. These include 
 Section pages. As you visually group your pages into clusters, you often
encounter the need for a section-level page — one that doesn’t provide
much content in and of itself but is needed as a centralized starting
point for a subsection. 
 Links. You also want to sketch out the links that you want to include
across your site’s pages. Remember, while Web sites are hierarchical,
links are positively nonlinear. Sketching or printing the site structure
and drawing lines to identify these links is helpful. 
Avoiding deep hierarchies
Be careful not to make the hierarchy too deep. If you have a lot of topics, it 
is better to be broad at the higher level than to have many layers of pages.
Studies have shown that visitors easily get lost when they descend more 
Figure 3-3:
Taking
advantage
of the built-
in charting
tool of
PowerPoint.
39
Chapter 3: Building a Purpose-Driven Web Site

than three layers deep in a site. For example, suppose you have an About Us
section in which you’d like to include the following Web pages: aboutus.html,
companyhistory.html, investors.html, contactus.html, maps.html,
directions.html, and phonelist.html. Logically, the purest hierarchy is
shown in Figure 3-4, but its added layers will make it more difficult for visi-
tors. (I even added two extra grouping pages — background.html and 
visitus.html.) In contrast, Figure 3-5 shows an alternative site hierarchy,
which flattens the structure levels and avoids deep nesting. 
Planning for effective feedback
In addition, you should provide feedback on your Web pages that indicates
where the visitor is on your site. Fortunately, some of the SiteBuilder naviga-
tion bars change the button state of the active page. In this way, visitors can
quickly discern their location. 
Another handy technique is to include a listing of the hierarchy just under
the page header. For example, consider the following heading for a feedback
page: 
Sound Off to Us
Home \ Contact Us \ Sound Off to Us
aboutus.html
background.html
visitus.html
phonelist.html
companyhistory.html
investors.html
maps.html
directions.html
contactus.html
Figure 3-4:

40
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

As you can see, underneath the page header’s Text element is a second Text
element that visually shows where the visitor is in the site’s hierarchy. It even
includes links to each of the pages above the current one. Used in combina-
tion with a SiteBuilder navigation bar, a visitor can never get lost in your Web
site. 
Writing Content for Your Web Site
Many people find developing a site’s structure to be an almost intuitive
process — the pages naturally start to group themselves into a tree-like 
hierarchy. However, to many Web site builders, “intuitive” is not a term 
that comes to mind when you talk about what content should be on a page
and how to best present it. 
Writing content for a page is one of those tasks that you often have to slog
through a few times before you really feel like you got it right. Even if content
development is more “art” than “science,” keep in mind these general princi-
ples as you work your way through this book:
 Write descriptive headings. Make sure visitors can quickly scan the text
heading of your page and instantly know exactly what they can expect
on it. Don’t be cute; be clear. 
companyhistory.html
investors.html
maps.html
phonelist.html
directions.html
aboutus.html
contactus.html

41
Chapter 3: Building a Purpose-Driven Web Site

 Avoid forced scrolls. In general, avoid developing pages that require too
much scrolling. However, in cases where scrolling is possible, you can
still inform visitors what they are going to read on this page rather than
force them to scroll down the page to see it. You can create a mini table
of contents at the top that highlights section headings of a lengthy page.
You can also provide a quick summary that highlights what the visitor
can expect. 
 Place key content at the top. Within the main text on a page, consider
writing the text like a newspaper article — placing the key information
first and then providing details in subsequent sections. This technique
doesn’t force readers to read all the page in order to understand what
you’re trying to communicate. 
 Avoid “link-itis.” As Chapter 6 discusses, links are the primary driver 
of the Web and add power to your Web site. At the same time, if you’re
writing a page that has multiple paragraphs of text, don’t feel obligated
to add a link at every possible place within that content. Too many links
within a body of text can be disruptive to the flow of reading. So use
them, but recognize the trade-offs. Also, placing links at the start or 
end of paragraphs is better for the reading flow. 
 Be concise. Don’t add content just because you feel like you need to
beef up your Web site. As you proofread through your Web site, get rid
of any fluff. Say more with less. Period. End of story. That’s exactly my
point. (Ooops, perhaps I should follow my own advice.) 
 Avoid “pixel cramming.” Along the same lines as the previous point,
make sure you don’t place too much content on a given page. A page
should have plenty of white space and should not — I repeat, should 
not — be cluttered. White space makes for a much more inviting Web
site to come to rather than going to a place that has every pixel of a
page crammed with information. 
 Create an aura of accessibility. If you’re a business trying to sell prod-
ucts and services, make sure you seem accessible to your site visitor in
case of questions or concerns. Provide contact information at the bottom
of each page (an e-mail link or page link to your Contact Us page). Also,
the Yahoo! Presence Indicator add-on (see Chapter 11) is another way to
let visitors know if you are available online for your visitors. 
 Emphasis your trustworthiness. Unless the site visitors know you
already, they’re going to be on guard, wary of buying something from 
an unknown company or even fearful of giving you an e-mail address 
or other personal information. Therefore, in those parts of your site
where a level of trust is needed, such as submitting a feedback form or
purchasing a product, tackle that issue head on, and put your visitors 
at ease. Take a look around at some of the way other sites handle trust
and then come up with a solution that best meets your site’s needs. 
42
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

 Be informative on downloads. If you have any PDF documents,
PowerPoint presentations, large graphics, or software programs that 
visitors can download from your site, be sure to indicate the size of the
download. A major frustration for visitors, particularly those who use a
dialup Internet connection, is to not know the size of a file that they wish
to download. What’s more, if your download requires a program or sepa-
rate reader (such as Adobe Acrobat Reader) in order to access the docu-
ment or file, be sure to inform the readers and provide a link to a Web
site from which they can download it. 
Evaluating Your Site
As you develop your Web site, you should constantly be evaluating it. As you
do so, ask yourself the following questions: 
 Is the purpose of my site clear? 
 Do all the pages of my site focus on that one purpose?
 Am I effectively targeting my audience? 
 Is the content interesting and relevant? 
 Is my site professional looking? Would a visitor know my skill level by
the look of the Web site? 
 Is the content well written and easy to read? Is the content written
appropriately for my target visitor? 
 Do I always know where I am throughout every page of the Web site? Or
do I find myself lost or in a dead end? 
 On a dialup connection, do the pages load fast enough? 
 Is my site accessible to visitors with disabilities? (Test how your Web
site looks when you use extra-large fonts in the browser. Also, print your
Web site in black and white on your printer, and see if it’s readable by
color-blind people.)

y and large, the software programs that you work with on your desktop
or laptop computer are file-based applications. For instance, when work-
ing in Microsoft Word, you’ll edit a document (.doc file); in Excel, calculate a
spreadsheet (.xls file). Or, if you listen to music in iTunes or Window Media
Player, you’ll play .mp3 or .wmf media files. In fact, as if to underscore this
point, open virtually any Windows program, and check out the name of its first
menu. Chances are you see a certain word that rhymes with Gomer Pyle. 
Within this file-based world, SiteBuilder has a different take: You work with
both a group of files (a Web site) as well as individual Web pages (.html
files) with the help of SiteBuilder’s Design pane (where you do most of your
editing). Therefore, from its File menu, you can actually create, open, and
save a Web site as well as a Web page. That might be enough to get Gomer 
to say gollllllly!
In this chapter, you explore how to use SiteBuilder to perform basic tasks
associated with your Web site and individual pages within it. You also dis-
cover how to use SiteBuilder to work with various elements on pages — 
the text, images, and links that make up any decent Web page. 

Working with Your Web Site 
A Web site in SiteBuilder is kind of like the titles of the classic fantasy series
The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. These titles refer to a
series of books, but you never, for example, read a book with those specific
titles. Instead, you read individual books, such as The Fellowship of the Ring
or The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, within that collection. In the same
way, a SiteBuilder Web site serves as an organizing device for a collection of
individual Web pages. You perform basic site-related tasks to organize and
manage the pages, but you never really edit your Web site as a whole. Instead,
you create and edit Web pages within the site. 
In this section, you explore the major tasks you perform when working with
your Web site. 
Creating a new site
In order to build a Web site, you need something to work with. So you either
need to create one from scratch or start with one that you’ve built using
another Web site building tool. (See the “Importing a Web site you’ve previ-
ously created” section, later in this chapter, for more on that course of
action.) Using SiteBuilder, however, you’ll normally want to start from scratch
to take advantage of SiteBuilder’s templates. 
After you start the Site Creation Wizard, you can’t access the SiteBuilder
menu or toolbar. You either need to complete the site creation process or
cancel out of the wizard to enable the full functionality. 
To create a site using SiteBuilder’s templates, follow these steps as you go
through the Site Creation Wizard:
1. Click the Create a New Site link in the Help pane. (The Help pane is
on the left side of the SiteBuilder main window.)
You can also choose File➪New Site from the main menu or press
Ctrl+Shift+N. 
The Help pane updates to display the opening page of the Site Creation
Wizard, as shown in Figure 4-1. 
2. Click the Start button to continue. 
The Help pane updates to show the next step in the creation process.
(See Figure 4-2.)

3. Enter the name of your Web site in the text box provided.
The name you pick never shows up on your public Web site but is used
to name the Web site folder on your hard drive. 
4. If you wish to change the base location in which SiteBuilder stores the
Web site, enter a new folder in the Save My Web Site Folder In box. 
Normally, you’ll want to simply stick with the default location (typically
c:\Program Files\Yahoo! SiteBuilder\sites), because that’s
where SiteBuilder naturally assumes all your stuff is kept — and some-
times old assumptions die hard. 
However, if you are a rebel, then you can create a My Web Sites sub-
folder in your My Documents folder to use as a home base for your 
Web site. 
5. Click the Next button to continue. 
The Help pane once again updates, as shown in Figure 4-3.
6. Determine whether you wish to use a SiteBuilder template for your
Web site design or not. 
If you want to use a SiteBuilder template — the optional resource that
gives you predefined page designs and graphics — then choose the
Template option. 
Figure 4-3:

48
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

If you do not want to use a template at all, then choose the Blank Page
option.
7. Click Next to continue. 
If you chose a blank page, then the Site Creation Wizard ends and your
site, containing one blank Web page, is ready to roll. You can ignore the
remaining steps in this list. 
If you’re using a template, then the Help pane updates to allow you to
select the template of your choice, as shown in Figure 4-4.
8. Select the template that you want to base your site design on. 
The Templates list displays the available templates, both ones that
you’ve already downloaded to your computer as well as ones that are
available but you haven’t downloaded. Downloaded templates have a
check mark beside their name. 
If you select a template that isn’t available on your local computer,
SiteBuilder asks if you want to download the template from the Yahoo!
Web site as you continue the process. (For more on downloading tem-
plates, see Chapter 5.)

Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Picking a template is one of the most important — and long-reaching —
decisions you make when it comes to your Web site. First, your selection
dominates the look of your site, so make sure it’s something you’ll want
to live with on a day in, day out basis. Second, it is also not a decision
you can easily turn back from — switching to another template after you
already create your site is not simply done. Third, the template provides
a starting point for you, but SiteBuilder templates are customizable so
you can make a site that meets your unique needs. Again, check out
everything you need to know about templates in Chapter 5 before
making your final decision. 
9. Click Next to continue. 
If you need to download the template you select, SiteBuilder prompts
you at this point to download it before continuing and gives you the
approximate time it will take to do so. You can continue or cancel the
process.
After the template is ready, the Help pane updates one final time, as
shown in Figure 4-5.
10. On the last page of the wizard, check the boxes beside each standard
page you want in your Web site.

You must include a home page, but you can decide whether you want to
start out with other typical pages, such as an About Us page, Contact Us
page, or a Services page. Checking the Blank Template Page box creates
a page without any starter text, but it still has the overall visual template
style.
If you don’t add these page types now, you can always decide to add
them later on. See the “Creating a new Web page” section, later in this
chapter, for more details. 
11. If you want to add a navigation bar, select the Link Pages Together
with a Navigation Bar radio button. (If not, select the Do Not Create a
Navigation Bar Now radio button.)
As Chapter 9 discusses, the navigation bar provides an easy way for
people to get around on your Web site. 
12. Click the Next button to create your Web site. 
SiteBuilder creates your Web site, opens each page inside of the Design
pane, and displays the Web site in the Site Contents pane. Figure 4-6
shows the final results. (Note that each page now has its own tab at the
top of the Design pane.)

Importing a Web site you’ve 
previously created 
If you’ve never created a Web site before or had an old one that could be a
candidate for the Web’s Ten Ugliest Sites list, then you can simply start from
scratch, following the instructions in the “Creating a new Web site” section.
However, perhaps you are now just turning to SiteBuilder after you’ve already
poured a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into a site that you don’t want to
simply throw away. 
You can import your previous work into SiteBuilder, with two important 
qualifications: 
 Your Web site must be on your Yahoo! Web server. If you have a Web site
that exists elsewhere, you need to transfer it first to your Yahoo! host
and then import it. 
 Importing into any Web site builder is usually an imperfect process, so
don’t expect perfect results. If you did not use SiteBuilder or Yahoo!
PageBuilder to create the site before, your original pages may need
tweaking and redesigning after you import them. Some Web site builders
may use complex formatting techniques that are difficult for SiteBuilder
to interpret correctly. 
My own personal caveat: Importing a Yahoo! Web site into an existing
SiteBuilder Web site is possible. However, because of the potential for confu-
sion and unexpected complications, I recommend you don’t do it. If you still
decide to go through with it, at least be sure you have any opened Web sites
closed before proceeding by choosing File➪Close Site. (This menu item is dis-
abled if you don’t have a site opened.) This ensures that you don’t acciden-
tally import pages into an existing Web site that you are working on.
To import a Web site into SiteBuilder, follow these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Import Yahoo! Site from the main menu. 
A dialog box may display, letting you know what I already told you —
don’t expect perfect results. Click OK to continue. 
If you are not signed in with Yahoo! Web Hosting for this session,
SiteBuilder prompts you for your Yahoo! ID and password. 
You’re prompted whether you wish to import the files into a new or
existing Web site. (See Figure 4-7.)
52
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

2. Click the Create a New Site radio button and click OK. 
The Choose a Name and Location dialog box displays, as shown in
Figure 4-8. 
3. Enter a name for your site in the box provided. 
4. Choose a location on your hard drive to put your imported Web site. 
As the dialog box recommends, you’ll usually want to stick to the default
folder provided. 
5. Click OK in the Choose a Name and Location dialog box to continue. 
The Import Site dialog box, shown in Figure 4-9, displays.

6. Confirm the Import From and Import To locations in the Import Site
dialog box and then click OK. 
SiteBuilder begins the importing process, copying each of the files
located on your Yahoo! host to your new Web site. 
Opening an existing site
Just like Rome wasn’t built in a day, so too you’ll be working on your Web site
in more than one sitting. Therefore, each time you want to work on creating
or update your Web site, you first need to open it. Follow these steps to open
a site you’ve already created: 
1. Choose File➪Open Site from the main menu. 
The Open Site dialog box, shown in Figure 4-10, displays.
2. Select your Web site from the list displayed.
If your Web site is stored in the SiteBuilder Sites folder, then select your
Web site from the list. 
Or, if it is located elsewhere, such as in your My Documents folder, then
click the Standard File Chooser radio button at the top, navigate to your
Web site folder using the Look In box, and then select the root folder of
your site. 
3. Click the Open button. 
SiteBuilder opens up the site.

54
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Saving your site 
You may create, open, and publish a Web site, but SiteBuilder has no equiva-
lent Save Site command. However, you can perform the same task by choosing
File➪Save All Pages from the main menu. 
Closing a site
When you are ready to close your Web site, choose File➪Close Site from the
menu. Before closing, you will be prompted to save any changes you’ve made
to the Web pages. 
Deleting a site
You can delete a site by opening the Open Site dialog box (accessible by
choosing File➪Open Site from the main menu). In the dialog box, select the
Web site and click the Delete button. (Refer to Figure 4-10 for a peek at the
Delete button; it’s at the top right and has an “X marks the spot” look.)
SiteBuilder asks you to confirm the deletion process. 
Previewing your site before you publish
One of the advantages of using a desktop-based Web site builder like
SiteBuilder is that you can preview, test, and debug (fix any problems) the
site on your own computer before you go live with it for the world to see.
When you preview your site locally, SiteBuilder launches your default Web
browser and points to the local file version of your home page. Previewing
allows you to
 See how the design and look of your Web site appears in the actual
browser. 
 Click through the links on your Web site to make sure they work as you
expect. 
 Test page effects and other functionality on your page to ensure their
proper operation. However, not all functionality, such as form process-
ing, is available when you preview your Web site locally. So if you have a
site with a lot of bells and whistles, you probably need to publish to
your Yahoo! host first if you really want to check out every aspect of
your site. 
55
Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Follow these steps to preview your site: 
1. Click the Preview in Browser button on the toolbar. 
Or choose File➪Preview in Browser from the menu. 
2. Test your Web site design and functionality in the browser. 
You don’t need to save your open files before previewing them. This capabil-
ity is handy, enabling you to test different ideas without actually having to
save your changes first. 
Within SiteBuilder itself, you can only preview your Web site using the default
browser. However, if you have more than one browser on your system and
want to preview your site in a nondefault browser, then perform the following
trick: 
1. Preview your Web site in the default Web browser. 
This process ensures that you’ve properly prepared all the site files for
previewing. 
2. In your default Web browser, copy the URL in the Address box to the
Clipboard. 
3. Open your nondefault browser. 
4. Paste the URL into the Address box and press Enter. 
The nondefault browser displays the preview Web site. 
Ready for the Big Leagues: 
Publishing Your Web Site 
After you create, design, and preview your Web site offline on your local com-
puter, you’re ready to “go public” with it. However, before doing so, make
sure your site passes two critical tests: 
 Make sure that you’ve fully debugged the Web site, as I describe in the
“Previewing your site before you publish” section, earlier in this chapter.
Thorough debugging before you go live ensures that your visitors don’t
run into potentially embarrassing problems with your site. 
 Make sure the home page of your Web site is named index.html in 
the Site Contents pane. If not, your published Web site won’t display
properly. 
56
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

You need to be connected to the Internet before starting this process.
Otherwise, you receive an error message from SiteBuilder. 
After you pass these two sanity tests, transfer your files to your Yahoo! Web
server by following these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Publish to Yahoo! Site from the main menu. 
Note: You need to save all your Web pages before you can publish —
otherwise, SiteBuilder can’t copy your latest changes. If all of your files
aren’t saved, SiteBuilder prompts you to save first. 
The Publish Site dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 4-11.
2. Make any necessary changes in the Publish From and Publish To
boxes. (You will rarely need to adjust these default settings.) 
The Publish From box displays your current Web site folder on your
local computer. 
The Publish To box shows the Web site domain that the files will be pub-
lished to. You’ll almost always want to publish to the root domain folder
(the default). However, if you want to publish to a subfolder on your site,
click the Browse button next to the Publish To box and select a different
folder. 
Under most circumstances, you can ignore this step, because you’ll usu-
ally want to publish your Web site to the root folder of your domain (for
example, www.anysite.com). But if you have a Web site that you want
to start from a subfolder (such as www.anysite.com/myothersite),
then change this value before publishing. 
3. Determine which files you want to publish. 
If you wish to update just the files you updated since the last time you
published, click the Only Publish Modified Files radio button. You’ll nor-
mally want to use this option as a timesaver. 
Figure 4-11:
Publishing

57
Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

If you wish to publish or republish all the contents of your Web site,
then click the Publish All Files button. 
4. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder starts the transfer process and notifies you when the publish
is completed. (See Figure 4-12.)
Working with Web Pages
“No sense reinventing the wheel” is what I always say. You’ll soon discover
that you can perform several file-based tasks inside of SiteBuilder that oper-
ate surprisingly like the file-based tasks you’d perform in a word processor
program like Microsoft Word. This section highlights these tasks. 
Creating a new Web page 
When you use the New Site Wizard (see the “Creating a new site” section, 
earlier in the chapter), you begin with a Web site containing a basic set of
four or five pages. Or, if you import a Web site, you start off with the number
of pages transferred from the Web server. However, your Web site doesn’t
stay static. As your needs change, so too do the pages on your site. You add
some, edit others, and remove old ones that you no longer need. 
When you add a new Web page to your Web site, you have two choices. 
You can 
 Add a blank page 
 Add a template-based page 
A blank page is useful if you want to fully customize the design and overall
look of your Web page. Otherwise, you want to choose the template-based
page option. The following two steps of instructions tell you how to add
these two types of new pages.
Figure 4-12:

58
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

To create a new blank page 
1. Click the New Page without Template button on the toolbar. 
Or you can choose File➪New Page➪Without Template from the main
menu or just press Ctrl+N. 
SiteBuilder adds an empty Web page to your site. 
To create a new template page
1. Click the New Page with Template button on the toolbar. 
Or you can choose File➪New Page➪With Template from the main menu
or just press Ctrl+Shift+N. 
The Add New Page dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 4-13. 
2. Select the template you want to use for the new page from the
Template list box. 
Be careful. This is one of those places where Yahoo! gives you too many
choices for your own good. Mixing and matching templates in a single
Web site is always a bad idea. Therefore, avoid the glamour and allure 
of all of those pretty templates, and plunk down the same template you
already picked for the rest of your Web site. If you find yourself so enam-
ored of one of these templates, then consider making that template the
look for your entire site. 
3. Select the type of page you wish to add: 
• Blank Template Page: Provides the basic page design of the tem-
plate but without any canned text. 
• About Us, Contact Us, Home Page, and Services Page: All provide
template-specific versions of these SiteBuilder basic page types.

Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

• Store Products Wizard: Creates an e-commerce products page for
your Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Web site. See Chapter 15 for more
details. 
4. Click the Add Page button. 
A new page named Untitled is added to the SiteBuilder Design pane,
and a new tab is added to the top of the page editor display.
When you create a new Web page, it isn’t officially part of the site itself until
you save it with a real name. After you save it (see the “Saving a Web page”
section, later in this chapter), then it’s added to the Site Contents pane. 
Saving a Web page
As you design and edit your Web page, you should save it periodically inside
of SiteBuilder just like any file-based Windows application. 
Saving an untitled page
The first time you save an untitled page, you’re prompted to both enter a file-
name in the Save As dialog box and specify the location of the file. Normally,
you want to give the file a descriptive name, such as directions.html (for a
Directions page) or news.html (for a Latest News or What’s New page). The
name you choose is the one used on the Web site. For example, if I have a
page called booklist.html on my domain, the URL for accessing that file
would be www.menwithoutchests.com/booklist.html. 
Saving a titled page
If you’ve already titled and saved the file before, simply click the Save Page
button on the toolbar to save your latest changes. You can also choose
File➪Save Page or press Ctrl+S. 
Saving a file with a new name
If you wish to save the Web page with a new name, then choose File➪Save
Page As from the main menu. In the Save As dialog box, enter a new name
and click OK. 
When you save a file with a new name, SiteBuilder adds the new page to 
your Web site but keeps the original file and all its link associations intact. 
In this way, you can think of the Save As process as duplicating your original
Web page instead of renaming it. 
60
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Opening a Web page
When you wish to edit a Web page already in your site, you can open it in var-
ious ways. 
To open the page immediately, double-click the name of the Web page in the
Site Contents pane. (Refer to Figure 4-6.)
To open up a page through the Open dialog box:
 Click the Open Page button on the toolbar.
 Choose File➪Open Page from the main menu. 
 Press Ctrl+O. 
In SiteBuilder, you can open an HTML file on your computer that is not part of
your Web site. However, when you do so, SiteBuilder treats it essentially as a
file import process: SiteBuilder copies the file into your Web site and renames
it untitled. As a result, you are working off a copy, not the original file. 
Closing one or more Web pages
When you are done with a Web page, close it by choosing File➪Close Page.
Or, if you’re through with the whole lot of pages you have open in your
Design pane, choose File➪Close All Pages. SiteBuilder closes them suckers
quicker than you can say “Barney Fife.” 
Deleting a Web page
An old Web page that needs to be put out to pasture. The page design experi-
ment that went horribly awry. A page that you look at and suddenly scream
at the top of your lungs: I am sick of it, and I’m not gonna take it anymore!
When circumstances like these spring up, sometimes you just have to take
drastic measures and delete a Web page from your site. 
To do so, find the doomed file in the Site Contents pane, and press the Delete
key. (Alternatively, you can choose Delete File from the right-click menu.)
SiteBuilder, after asking you to confirm your drastic action, not only removes
the page from your site, but also deletes the file from your computer. 
61
Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Copying a Web page
If you’d like to make a copy of a Web page, you can duplicate it by performing
one of two tasks: 
 Right-click the Web page inside of the Site Contents pane, and choose
Copy File from the contextual menu that appears. Provide a new name in
the Destination box, and click Save As. 
 Choose File➪Save As from the menu. (See the “Saving a file with a new
name” section, earlier in this chapter.) 
Renaming a Web page
You can rename a Web page that you’ve already created by selecting it inside
of the Site Contents pane and pressing F2 (or right-clicking and choosing
Rename File from the contextual menu that appears). You can then make 
a name change inside of the Site Contents pane. Press Enter to save your
changes. 
If the Web page is linked or part of the navigation bar, you’re asked to confirm
your changes. 
Modifying Page Properties 
While most of your time is spent adding, editing, and arranging elements
(such as text blocks, images, and links) on a page, you can also modify cer-
tain attributes of the page as a whole. You can perform these operations 
from the Page Properties dialog box (see Figure 4-14), which you can access
by choosing Edit➪Page Properties from the main menu. 
You can also right-click the page and choose Page Properties from the contex-
tual menu that appears. However, depending on your page layout and tem-
plate, selecting the page as whole with your mouse — rather than just an
image or other element on top of the page — can be tricky. If you don’t see
Page Properties in the right-click menu, it means you’ve selected another
object. 
The following sections discuss how you can work with the Page Properties
dialog box to modify the page. 
62
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

Specifying meta data
Each Web page can optionally contain meta data, a techie term that refers 
to information that is maintained “behind the scenes” of your Web page to
describe the content of the document. Your page’s meta data is accessible
from the top section of the Page Properties dialog box. (Refer to Figure 4-14.)
The three pieces of information include 
 Title: The title provides a descriptive name for the Web page. Most Web
browsers, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, place the title of the Web
page in the title bar of the browser window as well as use it as the name
when a page is saved as an item in a Favorites (or bookmarks) list.
Search engines also use the title when they display results from a
search. 
 Keywords: The words you provide as a comma-delimited list enable
search engines to index your Web page according to these keywords. 
For example, if you ran a travel agency specializing in selling mountain-
climbing adventure travel packages, you could include such words as
travel agency, adventure travel, Mount Everest, Alps, Himalayas, mountain
climbing, adventure tours, extreme sports, and sport tourism. Then, when 
a potential customer uses a search engine to find a travel agency spe-
cializing in alpine adventure packages, your site may pop up as one of
the first hits on the list, due to your excellent choice of keywords.
 Author: The author meta tag is useful for your personal use. It can be
especially helpful if you have multiple people working on your Web site. 
Enter the meta data information that best describes your Web page in the
spaces provided in the Page Properties dialog box.
Figure 4-14:
Modifying
page level
properties. 
63
Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Modifying the page layout 
You can also modify the physical layout of the page from the Page Properties
dialog box. The following sections show you how to make these modifications. 
Resizing a page
The default size of a SiteBuilder Web page has a fixed width of 762 x 3000 —
762 pixels in width and 3,000 pixels in height. (A pixel is the measuring unit of
screen resolutions.) You can tweak the size by changing the values of the
Width and Height boxes in the Page Properties dialog box. 
The width of your page is the most important design consideration in terms
of physical size. Visitors coming to your site will be using a variety of screen
resolutions. The most popular resolution today is 1024 x 768, but other popu-
lar resolutions include 800 x 600 and 1280 x 1024. Given this resolution range,
it is a wise idea to ensure that the width of your page is 790 pixels or less,
guaranteeing that the visitor can view the entire contents of the page width-
wise without needing to scroll horizontally. A few stragglers are still out there
using 640 x 480 resolution, but as Chapter 16 indicates, you don’t need to
design your site for really old technology. 
Specifying page margins
You can specify left/right and top/bottom page margins from the Page
Properties dialog box. A small margin of 5 pixels or less can offset your page
nicely from the browser window. Experiment with a variety of values, and see
what looks best for your Web site. 
If you center your page (see the next section), left/right page margins have
little effect unless the width of the browser window is the same size as or
smaller than the width of the page. 
Centering your page inside of the browser
You can have your page centered inside of the browser window by checking
the Centered check box in the Page Properties dialog box. Therefore, instead
of being left aligned, your page is always centered smack dab in the middle of
the browser window. 
If, for example, your Web page is 762 pixels in width, and you view the page 
at 800 x 600 resolution, you won’t notice much difference. But centering is
especially attractive for visitors coming to your site who use a high resolu-
tion, such as 1280 x 1024. For example, Figure 4-15 shows a noncentered page
at 1280 x 1024, while Figure 4-16 displays the same page with the centered
option turned on.

Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Working with Page Elements
So far in this chapter, you’ve been looking at how to work with the Web site
as individual Web pages. Important work, to be sure, but for the most part it’s
work that involves relatively simple tasks you can take care of rather quickly.
The bulk of the work you actually do on your Web site — the stuff that really
eats up your time — deals with what’s inside your Web pages: its content. In
SiteBuilder, when you talk about content you’re talking about page elements
such as text boxes, images, tables, forms, navigation bars, and all the other
doohickeys you can physically place on a Web page. Most of the remaining
chapters deal with how to work with each of these specific page elements.
For now, though, think of this section — the one you have in your hot little
hands right now — as your (relatively brief) introduction to how you orga-
nize and arrange all these various page elements onto the page itself. Read 
on and become enlightened!
Selecting elements
Inside of the SiteBuilder Design pane, you can select any page element by
clicking inside its borders with your mouse. When you do so, a flashing blue
border displays by default around your selection. When selecting elements,
keep the following in mind:
 To select multiple elements on a page, press the Ctrl key while you click
each element you wish to select. SiteBuilder adds the element you click
to the overall selection. 
 To select all the elements on a page, choose Edit➪Select All from the
main menu. 
 To unselect all the elements on a page, choose Edit➪Select None from
the main menu or click somewhere on the page itself. 
Moving elements 
You can move elements around on your page and place them wherever you
want to. To do so
1. Click the element you want to move, keeping your mouse button
down. 
The element shows a flashing blue border around it.
If you wish to move more than one element at a time, press the Ctrl key
while you select each element with your mouse. 
66
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

2. Drag the page element(s) to the desired new location. 
3. Release the mouse button. 
You can also use your arrow keys to move any page elements you’ve selected
one pixel at a time. This technique is useful when you wish to precisely posi-
tion your element. 
If you want to line up a page element based on x, y coordinates, you can
right-click the element and choose Properties from its contextual menu. Click
the Coordinates tab and adjust the x, y values as desired. Click OK to reposi-
tion the element. 
Other common element-based tasks 
You can perform several other common tasks on any element on your page. If
you’ve worked with Windows applications before, these tasks should be old
hat to you. Select one or more elements and then perform one of the following: 
 Cut: To cut an element, click the Cut button on the toolbar. (Or choose
Edit➪Cut from the main menu or press Ctrl+X.) SiteBuilder moves this
element to the Clipboard. You can then paste it into the current page or
any other page inside your Web site. 
 Copy: You can copy an element by clicking the Copy button on the tool-
bar. Alternatively, you can choose Edit➪Copy or press Ctrl+C. 
 Paste: Once you cut or copy an element, you can paste it into another
page on your Web site by clicking the Paste button on your toolbar (or
choosing Edit➪Paste or pressing Ctrl+V). SiteBuilder inserts it in the
same position (x, y coordinates) that it had when it was cut or copied.
Therefore, if you paste an element onto the same page you copied it, the
new element is on top of the original. 
 Duplicate: If you’d like to duplicate an element, you can perform a two-
step copy-and-paste process. However, you can save a step by choosing
Edit➪Duplicate from the menu. SiteBuilder adds the duplicate copy right
on top of the original. 
Because Duplicate adds elements to the same page, use the traditional
copy-and-paste process if you wish to use the duplicate element on a dif-
ferent page. 
 Delete: To delete an element, click the Delete button on the toolbar (or
press the Delete key or Edit➪Delete). 
67
Chapter 4: Working with Sites, Pages, and Elements

Layering elements 
In the early days of the Web, every page element that you added to a Web
page had its own rectangular sandbox where it could play to its heart’s con-
tent but would throw everyone else out of if they ventured inside of its bor-
ders. The only exception was a background image, which could cover the
entire page regardless of what was on top of it. 
This meant that if you tried to put one image on top of another, the browser
wouldn’t know how to display the combination properly, and so it would
force one image to move downward, outside of the sandbox of the other. But,
in so doing, it would skew the intended look of the page — not exactly what
the doctor ordered.
If you’ve ever needed proof that, every day and in every way, things are get-
ting just a little bit better, the newer browsers allow for you to overlap images
and other page elements, one on top of the other. (Cause for celebration, I
think.)
The vast majority of your Web site visitors will have browsers capable of dis-
playing layered images just as you intended when you designed the page.
However, there are some exceptions. For example, a text element overlapping
a navigation bar doesn’t display properly in the current version of Firefox. In
addition, a few old-time dinosaur browsers may also prove incapable of dis-
playing your page properly. Keep that in mind as you design your site. 
To layer elements, simply drag one element over the rectangular sandbox of
another. As you do so, you see that one of them has to be “on top” of the
other, taking precedence in what’s displayed on-screen. Ultimately, for all of
the elements on your page, there’s a “king of the mountain” — the image or
other page element that is on top of all other elements. Each of the other ele-
ments then fit in somewhere farther down the line. This relative ranking
order among page elements is maintained by SiteBuilder and passed along to
the Web browser for keeping track of the overlapping of page elements. 
Some of the elements are transparent, but other elements may have all of 
its area filled in. For example, a text element with no background color or
graphic will be transparent except for the text that is contained in it. As a
result, any image or element underneath the text element will show through
the transparent regions of the element. 
You can’t layer all page elements. Several of the Add-Ons, such as the Yahoo!
Map Add-On, need their own sandboxes. SiteBuilder displays a flashing red
border around these elements when they overlap with another page element,
letting you know that the page won’t display properly unless corrected.
68
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

As you work inside of SiteBuilder, you can determine where the elements
rank in that list by following these steps: 
1. Select the page element with your mouse. 
2. Determine the relative display order of the selected element to other,
overlapping elements. 
• If you’d like to make it the “king of the mountain” and appear on
top of any other element, choose Arrange➪Bring to Front from the
main menu (or press Ctrl+Shift+F). 
• If you’d like to send it spiraling downward to the bottom of the dis-
play order, choose Arrange➪Send to Back (or press Ctrl+Shift+B).
• If you’d like to move it up one level, choose Arrange➪Bring
Forward. 
• If you’d like to move it down one level, choose Arrange➪Send
Backward.
SiteBuilder then updates the display order based on your choice.

Aligning and spacing page elements
You can move page elements around anywhere you want on the page, but get-
ting all your elements aligned with each other or evenly spaced is tricky. To
align and space multiple page elements, follow these steps: 
1. Select each of the page elements you wish to align.
Remember: To select multiple elements, press the Ctrl key as you make
your individual selections. 
2. Choose Edit➪Align from the main menu. 
If you like keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+Shift+A. 
The Align dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 4-19. 
3. In the Alignment box, select the desired type of alignment. 
Choose one of your six alignment choices (left, vertical center, right, top,
horizontal center, and bottom). Or, if you are going to adjust the other
settings in the dialog box and not the alignment, then choose None.

4. If you wish, check one or both boxes in the Match Largest box. 
The Height box sets the height of each element to be the same size as
the largest selected element. 
The Width box adjusts the width of each element to be the same size as
the widest selected element.
5. If you wish, select the desired spacing option in the Space Items box. 
To space the elements evenly based on your alignment direction, click
the Space Evenly option. 
To arrange the elements flush next to the other, click the Space Edge to
Edge option. 
To keep the spacing as is, click the No Change option. 
6. Click OK to align.

Designers At Your Beck and Call:
Using SiteBuilder Templates
In This Chapter
 Discovering what a SiteBuilder template is
 Avoiding template remorse 
 Downloading more SiteBuilder templates 
 Changing a template look 
 Creating your own custom template page
 Deciding whether to use a template 
You’ve probably seen those “home makeover” shows on TV. The typical
scenario is the following: A professional designer comes into a couple’s
home and transforms it from “this old house” to “this spectacular house.”
Invariably, the homeowners cry in joy at the grand unveiling and thank the
designer profusely for the great work. Perhaps it’s just the ornery side of me,
but I secretly wish, just once, a couple would despise the changes — and
with such a ferocity that they throw the designer into their pool! 
In some ways, SiteBuilder templates are reminiscent of those home makeover
shows. As a Web site builder, you get to utilize the expertise of a professional
designer and have them make over your site. Your Web site look can go from
“drab and dull” to “rockin’ and stylin’.” Best of all, unlike those homeowners,
you don’t have to wait a week before being surprised by the results. You get
to pick and choose the exact style that best fits your needs before you actu-
ally create your Web site in the first place. 
Sound like something you might be interested in? Then read on, for this is the
chapter where you get to explore SiteBuilder templates, those “virtual”
designers always at your beck and call.
If you have your own custom design that you wish to use instead of a
SiteBuilder template, feel free to move on to Chapter 6.

Exploring SiteBuilder Templates
SiteBuilder gives you access to over 380 professionally designed templates
right inside of the product itself. The SiteBuilder template designs are grouped
into over 40 categories, such as Real Estate, Beauty, Baby, Computers,
E-Commerce, Medical, and Wedding. You can either take the time to install 
all these templates right onto your local computer, or you can view thumb-
nail versions of templates online and then download just the ones you need
on demand. 
What is a SiteBuilder template? 
Many software applications that you use every day — applications such 
as Microsoft Word or Microsoft PowerPoint — make use of “templates” or
“master” pages. Yet a template means something different to each of these
applications, and the SiteBuilder templates are no exception. 
SiteBuilder templates are page designs that serve as the backbone for your
Web site. A template includes most or all of the following components, which
combine to create a unified look and feel for your site: 
 A graphical theme, including coordinated graphics, background image,
customized navigation bar, and custom image bullets. 
 Text colors coordinated to match the template graphics. 
 Pre-designed “boilerplate” pages tailored for a specific purpose. The
pages that are available depend on the actual template. 
Business-oriented templates often include About Us, Contact Us, and
Services pages. Real Estate templates include many pages specific to that
vertical market, such as Calculator, Listing Details, and Neighborhoods
pages. Personal- or activity-oriented templates usually include About Us,
Contact Us, Calendar, and Photo Album pages. 
 A predefined layout area on each page to place your content. 
 Clip art specific to the template design. 
Figure 5-1 displays a sample template page with several of these components. 
Avoiding “template remorse”
You select the template you are going to use before you create your Web site.
After you create your site and start adding your own content, you can’t
simply switch over to another template. Instead, you have to start all over
74
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

again and create a new site. Therefore, avoid “template remorse” by making
sure you explore all the possible templates that you may be interested in
before you hone in on one to use:
 Download all the possible templates that you are considering using. (See
the “Need More? Downloading Additional Templates” section, later in
the chapter, for instructions on how to download additional templates.) 
 Create a dummy site for each of these templates. (Chapter 3 gives you
the lowdown on creating Web sites.) You don’t need much, if anything,
on a test site. You just want the basic site created to the get the flavor of
the template. 
 Evaluate each candidate. 
After you narrow your template list and make a final selection, you’re ready
to create your Web site. 
You may not be able to change templates after you create your site, but as
Chapter 3 explains, you can always add new pages based on the template to
your site after the initial site creation.

Need More? Downloading 
Additional Templates 
To minimize the time it takes to download the SiteBuilder program files,
Yahoo! includes just a handful of templates in the initial SiteBuilder installa-
tion. However, you can download additional templates — even all of them, 
if you want — so you can have them ready to go at a moment’s notice. 
You must be connected to the Internet, of course, in order to download
SiteBuilder templates. (Ahh, details, details. . . .) 
The following steps show you how to download a single template “on
demand:”
1. Choose File➪New Site from the main menu. 
The Help pane updates to display the opening page of the Site Creation
Wizard. 
2. Proceed through Steps 1 and 2 of the Site Creation Wizard. 
See Chapter 3 for a complete details on the site creation process. 
After completing these steps, Step 3 displays. (See Figure 5-2.) 
Figure 5-2:
“High

76
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 

3. Select the desired template from the Template list box. 
You have a couple tools that help in your template selection process,
including
• The Template Categories list box, great for filtering templates by
category.
• The View Full Size button, which lets you look at a normal-size pre-
view of the template.
Note: If you’ve all ready downloaded a template, a check mark is beside
its name. 
4. Click Next to continue. 
If you select a template that is not yet installed on your computer,
SiteBuilder downloads the template for you automatically and makes it
available for use. 
5. Proceed through the remaining steps of the Site Creation Wizard.
When your site is created, it’s based on the specified template. 
You can also download a template “on demand” from the Add New Page
dialog box (see Figure 5-4, shown later in the chapter). You access the Add
New Page dialog box by clicking the New Page with Template button on the
toolbar. 
Follow these steps to download SiteBuilder templates in advance: 
1. Click the Download All Templates button on the toolbar. 
The Download More Templates dialog box displays, as shown in 
Figure 5-3. SiteBuilder then contacts the Yahoo! server and retrieves
information on any template packages available for download. If you
have a dialup connection, this process may take a few minutes. 
Figure 5-3:

77
Chapter 5: Using SiteBuilder Templates

2. In the Download More Templates dialog box, check the templates 
you want to download or click the Check All button to download 
all templates. 
3. Click the Download button to start the download process. 
When SiteBuilder is done downloading, you can begin using the tem-
plates and clip art with your Web site. 
You can also view the SiteBuilder Templates Gallery inside your browser —
just go to webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/sb/templates. 
Creating Your Own Template Page
While you cannot make your own SiteBuilder templates, you can create your
own template page and reuse it within your site. 
In some software applications, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, you can make
one change to the “template,” and the changes ripple throughout every page
based on that template. Not so with SiteBuilder: After you create a custom
template page, it no longer contains any “linkages” to the pages that were
created from it. As a result, make sure you are satisfied with the design and
look of your custom template page before you create pages from it. 
You can create and use a customized template page by following these steps:
1. With your Web site open, click the New Page with Template button on
the toolbar. 
The Add New Page dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-4. 
78
Part I: Getting to Know Yahoo! SiteBuilder 
Tweaking a SiteBuilder template 
After you put your template to its intended use —
creating your Web site — don’t hesitate to tweak
the look of the SiteBuilder template elements on
your pages. If you are creative, this kind of
tweaking can help ensure that your Web site’s
design is truly unique and different from other
Web sites that use SiteBuilder. 
For example, suppose you like some aspects of
a given template but want to remove the back-
ground color, change the font from Arial to
Verdana, and set the navigation bar to be verti-
cal instead of horizontal. If so, you could make
these changes on your first page and then
update all other pages to give your entire Web
site the same unique look. 

2. In the Add New Page dialog box, select the template you are using
from the list. 
The current template is selected in the list.
3. From the Select Page to Add drop-down menu, choose Blank Page. 
4. Click the Add Page button at the bottom of the Add New Page 
dialog box.
The new page is added to your Web site. 
5. Within the Design pane, set up the page layout exactly as you want 
it to. 
Continue until you are satisfied with the results. See Chapter 3 for more
on working with pages in the Design pane. 
6. Click the Save Page button on the toolbar.
The Save As dialog box appears. 
7. In the File Name box, give the template page a name that reflects its
usage, such as template.html or basic.html. 
8. Click Save. 
Your custom template page is now ready to go. You can see it in the Site
Contents pane, as shown in Figure 5-5. 
Create a new page based on your custom template with these steps:
1. From the Site Contents pane (refer to Figure 5-5), right-click the tem-
plate page and choose Copy File from the menu that appears. 
The Copy File dialog box displays. 
Figure 5-4:

Chapter 5: Using SiteBuilder Templates

2. Enter the new page name in the Destination box, and click Save As. 
SiteBuilder creates a new page based on your template page. 
Your new page is added to the site and is displayed in the Site Contents
pane. 
Using Templates or Going Solo? 
The site templates that come with many Web site builders are often not too
impressive. They can look tacky, cookie cutter, and give your site a very ama-
teurish look. Not so with SiteBuilder. The templates that are included are
nicely designed and creatively packaged. Therefore, many people who use
SiteBuilder are going to want to simply go with a template to design their
Web site. At the same time, just because you can use templates doesn’t mean
that you necessarily should. Instead, you should consider the advantages
(and disadvantages) of using templates versus striking out completely on
your own.
The advantages to using SiteBuilder templates are
 Templates give you a professional-looking site oriented toward your
business type or interest. 
 You can create a template-based site in SiteBuilder in mere seconds and
be productive with it immediately.

 You can get a well-designed site without needing to know how to use
Adobe Photoshop or any other graphics software. 
 You are freed from doing any design work yourself. As a result, you can
focus purely on the content and messaging of the site. 
The advantages to doing it yourself are 
 You don’t have to base your Web site design on someone else’s ideas.
Your blank page is an open canvas. Whatever you can dream up and pro-
duce visually, you can do. 
 You can rest assured that your design is going to be unique and not used
by another Yahoo! SiteBuilder user. 
In the end, it comes down to three factors: productivity, design skills, and the
level of control you want. Most SiteBuilder users will opt for templates, as
they provide a healthy balance among each of these factors.

Creating “Cool”
Web Pages

In this part . . .
You can create a vanilla, run-of-the-mill Web site 
in many ways. I’m guessing you’re using Yahoo!
SiteBuilder because you want to do something extraordi-
nary, to create a site that looks good and is easy to use. 
If so, check out the chapters in Part II, which cover the
building blocks you need for cool Web pages. You dis-
cover how to work with text, links, pictures, tables, navi-
gation bars, and forms.

T
he underappreciated, not-so-glamorous, yet-oh-so essential sidekick. It
seems like most films with a hero has one. For every Maverick, there’s a
Goose. For every Frodo, there’s a Samwise Gangee. For every Batman, there’s
a Robin. 
This sidekick principle holds true in the Web design world as well. Graphics
and other visual elements are the “Mavericks” of the Web world. They’re the
top guns, the show-offs, and the prima donnas. Heck, some have even wit-
nessed them singing “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling” off-key to other graph-
ics. But even if visual elements are the most glamorous part of a Web page,
text is what makes the Web go round. You use visual elements to create an
atmosphere and paint broad messages for your visitors, but text is what
you’ll use to interact and communicate most information to them. 
In this chapter, you explore how to add the “nuts and bolts” of any page to
your Web site — text and links. But I’ll make a guarantee: After you under-
stand how to work with the various Text and Link tools, your pages won’t
suffer the crash-and-burn fate of poor ol’ Goose. 
Working with Text
When you work with words and paragraphs inside of Yahoo! SiteBuilder, it’s
much different from working within Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, or another

word processor. In a word processor, your document is much like an ever-
expanding container that grows in length as you add more text. The physical
area that the text occupies on a page is defined by its page margins. When
you can add graphics to a page, the word processor usually treats these as
foreign objects that the flow of the document ignores and just wraps around. 
In contrast, Yahoo! SiteBuilder is much more like a desktop publisher, such as
Microsoft Publisher. You don’t work with a single document spread over mul-
tiple pages. Instead, you work with multiple independent pages that you orga-
nize yourself. 
This type of software doesn’t work with words and paragraphs so much as
rectangular objects that contain text, graphics, or video. In terms of page
layout, it wants to know how big these objects are and how to arrange them
on the page. 
In a word processor, when you want to add text to a document, you just start
typing. But in SiteBuilder, you can’t just start typing on a page. You first have
to add a text box on a page and then type in the box you just created. 
In this section, you explore the basic text-editing tasks, including 
 Adding text to your page 
 Copying text from Microsoft Word or another application to your page 
 Editing your text
 Positioning the text where you want it
 Resizing the text container 
Sounds like a lot, I know, but take things a step at a time and you’ll do all
right. Ready to get started?
Adding text to a page
To add text to a page, follow these steps: 
1. Click the Insert Text button on the toolbar. (See Figure 6-1.) 
You can also choose Insert➪Text from the menu or press Ctrl+Shift+T. 
In the smack dead center of the current page, a blue text box is created. 
2. Click and drag the text box to the approximate position on the page
you want. 
86
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

3. Resize the text box to an approximate size that can hold your text.
To do so, position your mouse cursor on top of one of the eight resize
handles — the tiny squares you see spaced along the borders of your
new text box. Click and drag the box boundary to the desired size and
then release your mouse button. 
4. Double-click the blue text box and begin typing.
After you start typing, if you find that you miscalculated on the text box
size, see the “Resizing your text container” section later in this chapter. 
Adding text from another 
source to your page
When you create a Web site, you’ll want to have some original text that is
specifically written for your Web site visitors. However, oftentimes you’ll 
have some information to put on your Web site that you have used for other
purposes — stuff that’s already hanging around somewhere on your com-
puter. Perhaps you have text from a paper brochure you had printed up, or an
e-mail you sent to a customer, or maybe just an old Microsoft Word document. 
Insert Text button
Figure 6-1:

87
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

Rather than retyping it, simply follow these instructions to add it to a fitting
Web page:
1. Open your word processor or other application and copy the desired
text to the Clipboard. 
2. Add a text box to your SiteBuilder page. 
Follow directions in the “Adding text to a page” section, earlier in this
chapter. 
3. Double-click the blue text box. 
A text cursor displays. 
4. Right-click in the text box, and choose Paste from the contextual
menu that appears in order to insert the copied text into the text box.
You can also click the Paste button on the toolbar, choose Edit➪Paste
from the menu, or press Ctrl+V. 
The text is added to the text box at the spot the text cursor is. 
You’ll quickly notice that any formatting that you had assigned to the
text in the other application is stripped when you paste it into
SiteBuilder. Therefore, you need to reformat the text as appropriate. 
Editing text on a page 
To edit existing text on a page, simply follow the steps: 
1. Double-click the text box containing the text you wish to edit. 
The text box you select displays with a flashing blue border around it.
Note: The text cursor shows up right at the location where you double-
clicked. 
2. Modify the text as desired. 
While Yahoo! SiteBuilder is not a word processor, many text editing
capabilities of your word processor are built in for you. See Table 6-1 for
a list of keyboard commands.

Moving text around a page
One benefit of having all your text contained inside text boxes is that moving
big chunks of text around is pretty easy. Just reposition the text box contain-
ing the stuff you want to move, and the content inside the text box dutifully
follows along. Here’s a blow-by-blow account:
1. Click the text box you wish to move, keeping your mouse button down. 
A flashing blue border appears around the selected text box.
2. Drag the text box to the desired new location. 
3. Release the mouse button. 
You can also use your arrow keys to move text boxes one pixel at a time. This
technique is useful when you wish to precisely position your text. 
Yahoo! SiteBuilder allows you to move the text box anywhere on the page —
and I mean anywhere. You can overlap other text boxes, graphics, or what-
ever, so be sure to position your box carefully to avoid unwanted overlap. 
89
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

Resizing your text container 
When you add a text element onto your page, SiteBuilder always sets the rec-
tangular container to a standard size. However, you will usually want to
resize the text box to account for the text you are adding to it. Follow these
steps to resize: 
1. Click the text box you wish to resize. 
A flashing blue border appears around the selected text box.
2. Click one of the blue handles on the outside of the text box, and keep
your mouse button down. 
• If you wish to expand or shrink the width, click a left or right
handle. 
• If you wish to expand or shrink the height, click a top or bottom
handle. 
• If you wish to expand or shrink both the height and width at the
same time, click a corner handle. 
3. Drag the mouse to the appropriate size. 
Figure 6-2 shows a text box being expanded. 
4. Release the mouse button.

Caught Ya: Checking Your Spelling
Win u r tring two preesent yurself professhunally, theerz feeew thinz wurse wers
then havwing splling earors. Fortunately, Yahoo! SiteBuilder comes with a built-
in spell checker, so you can clean out those spelling gotchas before you pub-
lish them to your Web site. You can check your spelling both automatically —
letting SiteBuilder watch your words as you type them — or manually — 
activating the spell checker yourself. 
Automatically alerting you 
of spelling mistakes 
If you use Microsoft Word or WordPerfect, you know what that ubiquitous
squiggly red line means resting underneath a word — Hey, look at me! I’m
spelled wrong! Not to be outdone, Yahoo! went to the U.N. Commission on
Squiggly Red Lines and got permission to include their own squiggly red 
line inside SiteBuilder. Therefore, when Automatic Spell Checking is on,
SiteBuilder lets you know of any spelling problems. By default, Automatic
Spell Checking is enabled. 
To enable or disable the Automatic Spell Checking option: 
1. Choose Tools➪Check Spelling from the main menu to display the Spell
Checking submenu. 
If already enabled, the Automatic Spell Checker option is checked. 
2. Click the Automatic Spell Checker option to toggle the current setting.
The logic that SiteBuilder uses to determine whether a word is or is not mis-
spelled is based on your preferences. See the “Setting spell checking prefer-
ences” section that’s coming up. 
Figure 6-3 shows what you see when a word you enter is marked as being
spelled incorrectly. 
The Automatic Spell Checker feature lets you know that a word is unrecog-
nized, but you can’t use the checker to correct the mistakes themselves —
you can’t simply right-click the misspelled word and see a list of suggested
spellings. If you really want help on how to spell something — rather then
just being notified of a spelling boo-boo — you’re going to need to check your
spelling manually, as I spell out (pun intended) in the next section.
91
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

Checking your spelling manually
You can manually check the spelling of the text on your Web site in a variety
of ranges — checking a selection of text, a page, all the open pages, or your
entire site. 
To manually check your spelling
1. Determine the scope of your spell check and then choose the appro-
priate menu command:
• If you have text selected with your mouse and want to check this
text but not the entire page or site, choose Tools➪Check Spelling➪
Selected Text from the main menu. 
• To check all text on the current page, choose Tools➪Check
Spelling➪Current Page. 
• To check all pages you currently have open in SiteBuilder, choose
Tools➪Check Spelling➪Opened Pages. 
• To check the entire “kit and caboodle,” the whole Web site, then
choose Tools➪Check Spelling➪Entire Site. 
Figure 6-3:
Our little
squiggly red

92
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

The Check Spelling dialog box (see Figure 6-4) appears, with the first
potential spelling error shown in the Unknown Word box. A suggested
replacement word is shown in the Replace By box, along with other pos-
sible choices in the Suggestions list. 
2. Decide what action you wish to take for this flagged word: 
• Replace this instance of the spelling error: To replace the mis-
spelled word with the one shown in the Replace By box, click the
Replace button. 
To choose a different word from the Suggestions list, select the
word with your mouse and then click Replace. 
If SiteBuilder doesn’t suggest the word you need, type the correct
spelling for the word in the Replace By box and then click Replace. 
• Replace all instances of the misspelled word: Misspelling the
same word multiple times is common. For example, I habitually
misspell separate as seperate and calendar as calander. If this hap-
pens to you, you can replace all instances of the misspelled word
in the range you are checking by selecting the word and clicking
the Replace All button. 
• Add an unrecognized word to the Yahoo! SiteBuilder dictionary:
If you have a word that is not understood by the spell checker, but
you’d like to add it to the dictionary, click the Learn button. 
• Ignore misspellings: If you have a word that SiteBuilder doesn’t
recognize but you don’t want to add the word to the dictionary,
you can click the Ignore button (to ignore this single instance of
the word) or Ignore All (to ignore all instances of the word). 
After you take an action, the spell checker moves to the next misspelling
(or punctuation error, if you have that option enabled). 
When you finish, SiteBuilder informs you that the spell check has com-
pleted successfully.

You can also switch spell-checking dictionaries. To do so, click the
Dictionary drop-down box and select the desired language choice. 
3. Click Close to finish spell checking. 
Setting spell checking preferences
The text you have on your Web site may not always be like a high school
English paper. It can contain some words, such as Web addresses, that aren’t
in a standard dictionary but that are proper for the Web nonetheless. Rather
than having SiteBuilder’s spell checker flag lots of items that are perfectly
fine in the world of the World Wide Web, you can set the spell checking pref-
erences in order to limit the number of such “false positives.” Here’s how:
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences. 
The Preferences dialog box makes an appearance. 
2. Click the Spell Check tab. 
The various spell checking options display, as shown in Figure 6-5. 
3. Check or uncheck the desired options. 
See the following descriptions of each option. 
4. Click OK or Apply to save these changes. 
The spell checking options you can set are as follows: 
 Ignore Case: Ignores lowercase words that start a sentence. 
 Ignore Mixed-Case Words: Turns a blind eye to words that have upper-
and lowercase characters, such as WordPerfect, JavaScript, and even
SiteBuilder.

 Ignore Words with Digits: Overlooks words that contain fingers . . .
oops, I mean, numeric digits. 
 Ignore Duplicate Words: Ignores those times where you list the same
word more than once. 
 Ignore URL-Like Words: Bypasses any word that looks, smells, 
behaves, or in some way resembles a URL or a Web address — such 
as http://www.yahoo.com or www.yahoo.com. 
 Check Punctuation: Puts on its English Teacher hat and checks for
simple punctuation errors, such as having a space prior to a comma 
or a period at the beginning of a word, that sort of thing. 
 Allow Hyphenated Words: Ignores two or more words attached by a
hyphen, such as sub-menu or venti-one pump-soy-extra whip-mocha.
 Allow Common File Extensions: Doesn’t flag filenames with common
file extensions, such as .doc, .html, or .zip. 
Tweaking the Look of Your Text
The days of boring monospaced text are long gone — relics of the days of 
the typewriter. People nowadays, whether they read a document you created
or visit your Web site, expect to see spiced-up text that looks attractive and
readable. 
Text formatting in Yahoo! SiteBuilder has three scopes: 
 Character: Character formatting applies to any range of characters —
from individual characters to words to sentences and even to one 
or more paragraphs. The Font, Style, and Text Color settings are all 
character formats. I discuss these in this section. 
 Paragraph: Paragraph formatting is formatting associated with an entire
paragraph — things like justification, lists, and indents. Find my discus-
sion of these settings in the “Stylin’ Your Paragraphs” section later in
this chapter. 
 Text box: Text box formatting is applied to the contents of the entire
text box, whether the text contains one word or several paragraphs. See
the “Formatting Your Text Boxes” section later in this chapter for more
on these settings. 
Deciding which font style to use
The font style (or typeface) that you use is one of the most basic decisions
you’ll ever make when creating a Web page. Chapter 3 describes the specific
95
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

design considerations you’ll want to think about when deciding on which
fonts to use. But in general, remember two rules: 
 Pick a font that you know people will have on their system. When you
create a printed document, newsletter, or Adobe Acrobat file, you can
pick any font you have and be certain that your reader will be looking at
the formatting that you intended. However, on the Web, the font you
define on your Web page may or may not be on the visitor’s computer. If
the font is missing from the system, then the browser looks for a substi-
tute font. However, you don’t always know how the page is going to look. 
Therefore, I recommend picking Arial, Verdana, or Times New Roman as
fonts. You can be fairly confident using Tahoma or Georgia, too, as most
users will have these fonts or at least the browser can substitute a stan-
dard font quite close to these. You can also use Courier New in specific
instances where you want to display a monospaced font. 
 Pick one to two font styles for your site and go with them. You’ll want
to pick a default font style and use it predominately across your site. 
For sans serif (smooth) fonts, use Arial, Verdana, or Tahoma. For serif
(curvy) fonts, stick with Times New Roman or Georgia. 
You may want to have a second font for headings to add some variety.
But if you do so, pick the opposite font style. For example, if you use
Verdana as your primary font, pick a serif font for your headings. Or if
you have Times New Roman as your main font, use any of the sans serif
fonts for your heading text. 
Setting the font style and size 
When you work with a Web site that you created using a template, SiteBuilder
already gives you a recommended font. However, if you’d like to change the
font style, follow these instructions: 
1. Click the text box that contains the text you wish to modify. 
If you wish to change the font style for all the text within the box, then
keep the box selected. Or if you wish to modify a portion of text, then
select just that portion with your mouse. 
2. Select the desired font style or size from the drop-down lists on the
toolbar. 
Your text updates to show the new font setting. 
You can also change the font style or size for two or more text boxes on a
single page. To select multiple text boxes, simply click each text box while
pressing the Ctrl key. Then set the desired font style from the drop-down list
on the toolbar. 
96
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Giving your text some style
You can make parts of your text stand out by assigning the old formatting
bold, italic, and underline standbys to your text: 
 Bold is helpful for headings. 
 Italic is useful for emphasizing certain words or phrases within a 
paragraph. 
 Within the Web world, the underline style has become synonymous with
Web links. Therefore, under most circumstances, I don’t recommend
using underline formatting. You’ll find your visitors clicking the word
assuming it’s a Web link. (To set links, see the “Getting Jumpy: Adding
Links to Your Text” section, later in the chapter.) 
To set a character style for your text, follow these steps: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text you wish to modify. 
2. Select the text you wish to style with your mouse. 
3. Click the Bold, Italic, or Underline button on the toolbar. 
You can also choose Format➪Bold, Format➪Italic, or Format➪Underline
from the menu or use the following key shortcuts: Ctrl+B (Bold), Ctrl+I
(Italic), or Ctrl+U (Underline). 
If you’d like to set a character style for all the contents of a text box, click the
box and then click the appropriate button on the toolbar. 
97
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links
Color me beautiful
You can express colors on computers in differ-
ent ways. SiteBuilder provides support for three
of the most popular methods today:
Hex color codes: Each color is represented
within the Web world with a very techie-looking
hex color code, which is a six-digit code prefixed
with a # sign. For example, black is #000000,
white is #FFFFFF, and bright blue is #0000FF. If you
ever look at the HTML source code for a Web
page, you’ll see the colors expressed as hex
color codes.
HSB values: HSB stands for Hue, Saturation, and
Brightness. Hue values range from 0 to 360
degrees — like points on the circumference of a
large colorized circle. Saturation and Brightness
are percentages, ranging from 0 to 100. 
RGB values: RGB stands for Red, Green, and
Blue. A color is created by combining the Red,
Green, and Blue values — each of which range
from 0 to 255. Many Windows applications, such
as Microsoft Paint and Microsoft Word, support
the use of RGB values. 

In word processors, you can toggle character style formatting on or off as
you type. You can do the same here. You can turn on Bold, Italic, or Underline
by clicking its toolbar button. The toolbar button is darkened to signify its
“on” state. You can then turn it off by clicking the button once more. 
Changing text color 
You can modify the color of your text to any color shade on the color dial.
But SiteBuilder doesn’t stop there: You can also use any color on the color
spectrum, the color wheel, or even the color palette. (Okay, all these terms
mean the same thing, but you get my drift.) 
Follow these steps to change the color of the text: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text you wish to change its
color. 
2. Select the text you wish to color with your mouse. 
3. Click the Text Color button on the toolbar. 
Alternatively, you can choose Format➪Text Color from the menu. 
The Choose Text Color dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 6-6. 
4. Select the color you want to use. 
The Swatches tab displays the common colors, along with a box of the
most recent colors you’ve chosen before. 
Or if you don’t see the exact color you want to use on the Swatches tab,
you can more precisely define the color using the HSB or RGB tabs. (See
the “Color me beautiful” sidebar for a discussion of what these
acronyms mean.)

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

In the past, you wanted to be careful to use only “Web safe” colors,
which are a set of 216 colors common to most browsers. Web safe colors
helped ensure that the colors you picked would display reliably on mon-
itors that display only 256 colors. However, now that the vast majority of
your visitors will be using a monitor with thousands of colors, you can
feel confident using any color. 
5. Click OK to save your settings. 
The text you selected displays with the new color. 
Stylin’ Your Paragraphs
Most text formatting inside of SiteBuilder is done at the character or text box
level. SiteBuilder has just two paragraph-level formats that you can set —
lists and indents. 
Making lists
Whether it is a to-do list, a grocery list, or a list of points covered in a lecture
or sermon, people just seem to think in lists. Lists are popular on Web sites
as well because they enable people to quickly read and process “sound bites”
of information much more quickly than if they were forced to plow through
paragraph upon paragraph of dense text. The designers behind SiteBuilder
recognized that fact and came up with software that allows you to create a
broad spectrum of lists, including bulleted lists, numbered lists, and even
image bulleted lists. 
Adding bulleted and numbered lists
A bulleted list is used to offset a bunch of related sentences or bits of informa-
tion on your Web page. A numbered list is sequential list of steps or other
items that SiteBuilder automatically numbers for you. To add bullets or num-
bers to one or more existing paragraphs, follow these steps: 
1. Double-click the text box containing the paragraph or paragraphs
you’ve targeted for a bulleted or numbered list makeover. 
2. Select one or more paragraphs that you want to transform into a list. 
3. Click the Bulleted List or Numbered List button on the toolbar. 
You can also choose Format➪Bulleted List or Format➪Numbered List
from the menu. 
You can also customize the bullet or number format SiteBuilder uses. See the
“Customizing bulleted and numbered lists” section later in this chapter. 
99
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

Adding image bulleted lists 
If you are sick of the normal round or square bullets that SiteBuilder uses,
you can use your own image as the bullet instead. Image lists are an attrac-
tive and professional-looking alternative to normal bullets. You’ll notice that
many of the SiteBuilder templates use image lists. 
To create an image bulleted list 
1. Double-click the text box where you’re planning to place the image
bulleted list. 
2. Select a paragraph (or paragraphs) to transform into such a list. 
3. Click the Custom List button on the toolbar. 
The Choose Bullet dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-7. 
4. Determine whether you wish to choose a bullet from your own images
or from the SiteBuilder Clip Art library. 
If you wish to use your own image, use the Select Clip Art pane to navi-
gate to the image file.
If you wish to use SiteBuilder Clip Art, click the Clip Art radio button in
the Select From pane and then use the Select Clip Art pane to pick your
bullet. 
Be sure the image you use is 12 pixels or less in height. (And remember,
the point here is to look professional, so no images of Socko the Clown.)
5. Click OK to create the image bulleted list.

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Removing list items 
If you want to remove an item from a bulleted, numbered, or image bulleted
list, simply position the text cursor at the left margin to the right of the bullet
or number and press the Delete key. 
Customizing bulleted and numbered lists
SiteBuilder also enables you to more precisely define your lists using the
Bullets and Numbering dialog box. 
Here’s how to get your list to look exactly like you want it:
1. Double-click the text box that contains the list you are going to 
customize. 
2. Select each of the paragraphs that make up your list. 
3. Choose Format➪Bullets and Numbering from the main menu. 
The Bullets and Numbering dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-8. 
4. Customize the list as desired. 
Use the List Style drop-down menu to choose the bullet or numbering
style you want. 
• For bullets, you can choose Disc (the default), Circle, Square, or
Image. 
• For numbered lists, you can choose normal 1, 2, 3, 4 order or else
jazz it up with roman numerals (I, II, III, IV or i, ii, iii, iv) or use
alphabetical order (A, B, C, D or a, b, c, d). 
• For an indented list with blank bullets, select Blank. 
In the Margins box, you can specify any custom margins for the list.
Usually, the only value you want to modify is the Left margin. 
The Top and Bottom margins can be helpful if you are using an extra-
large image bullet. 
5. Click OK to save changes.

Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

Indenting your text
Indenting moves the left margin for a paragraph several spaces to the right.
You can indent a paragraph within your text box when you want to offset a
specific piece of text for emphasis, including a lengthy quotation, or simply
to make an unnumbered list. 
To indent a paragraph
1. Double-click the text box that contains the paragraph you are going to
indent. 
2. Position your cursor anywhere inside of the desired paragraph. 
3. Click the Increase Indent button on the toolbar. 
You can also choose Format➪Increase Indentation from the main menu. 
4. If you’d like to increase the indentation more, click the Increase
Indent button again. 
You can unindent a paragraph to reverse the indent settings as well by follow-
ing these steps: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the paragraph you are going to
unindent. 
2. Position your cursor anywhere inside of the desired paragraph. 
3. Click the Decrease Indent button on the toolbar. 
Alternatively, you can choose Format➪Decrease Indentation from the
main menu. 
4. If you’d like to decrease the indentation more, click the Decrease
Indent button again. 
When you unindent all the way to a normal paragraph, SiteBuilder
ignores the Decrease Indent command. 
Formatting Your Text Boxes 
Within SiteBuilder, you can apply certain text formatting commands to every-
thing inside of a text box. These include
 Background color
 Justification and alignment 
102
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Changing the background 
color of your text box
While you can’t change the background color of individual pieces of text
within your text box, you can change the background color of the entire text
box by following these steps: 
1. Click the text box whose background you wish to change. 
2. Click the Text Background button on the toolbar. 
You can also choose Format➪Text Background from the main menu. 
A dialog box appears almost identical to the one shown in Figure 6-6,
except this time it’s called the Choose Text Background dialog box. 
3. Select the color you want to use. 
See the “Changing text color” section, earlier in this chapter, for details
on how to change the settings in this dialog box. 
4. Click OK to save your settings. 
The background of the selected text box updates with the new color. 
Resetting the text background
You can call it “coloring remorse” or “backgrounder’s regret.” But whatever
label you want to put on it, sometimes you’ll decide that changing the text
box background wasn’t such a good idea after all. SiteBuilder allows you to
reset the background color with a touch of a button:
1. Click the text box that has the really horrid, awful color scheme that
you can’t stand the sight of. 
2. Click the Remove Text Background button on the toolbar. 
You can also choose Format➪Remove Text Background from the main
menu. 
Whew! The colorizing experiment is over. You’re back to where you
started from. 
But Your Honor . . . I was justified! 
Within the printed world of documentation, paragraph justification is a big
thing. For example, for standard letters, you often right-align the sender’s
103
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

mailing address while left-aligning the rest of the letter. For reports, you usu-
ally center titles on the front page. Within the Web world, justification is used
less often as a formatting technique. By and large, Web designers usually
stick to left-aligned text. It just seems to work better. However, you may have
specific text boxes that need different alignment, such as a page title or the
text inside of a navigation bar. 
Moreover, there’s another level of alignment that isn’t thought about in the
word processing world but is important when working with SiteBuilder’s text
boxes: vertical alignment. Because you’re working with the entire text box,
you may want to align the text vertically within the boundaries of the text box. 
When you need to change the horizontal or vertical justification for a text
box, follow these steps:
1. Click the text box that contains the text you wish to justify. 
2. Click the appropriate justification button on the toolbar. 
For horizontal alignment, click the Left Justify, Center Horizontally, or
Right Justify button. 
For vertical alignment, click the Top Justify, Center Vertically, or Bottom
Justify button. 
Alternatively, you can choose the corresponding command from the
Format part of the main menu. 
The text box alignment updates based on your selection. 
Getting Jumpy: Adding 
Links to Your Text
Links are the backbone of the Internet — the very reason that the Web came
to be what it has become today. A link (also called a hypertext link or hyper-
link) is an element on a Web page that you click with your mouse to jump to
another Web page or another destination. A link can be a bit of text you click,
but it can also be a clickable graphic. (You can explore how to set graphic
links in Chapter 7.) 
In SiteBuilder, you can create links to several different types of resources on
the Web, including
 Another page on your Web site
 A page on another Web site
104
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

 An e-mail address
 A file, such as a Microsoft Word or an Adobe Acrobat document
In this section, you explore how to add links to each of these types of
resources. 
Linking to another page in your site
Probably the most common link that you want to add is a link to another
page on your Web site. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Select the word or words that you want to use as the link text. 
3. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
The Link dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-9. 
4. In the Select the Type of Link drop-down list, keep the default option
(A Page in My Site).
5. Choose a page from the Select a Page from My Site drop-down menu. 
The list displays all the pages that are part of your Web site. 
6. If you wish to modify the hyperlink text, do so in the Enter Text for
Link box. 
7. Click the link inside the Link Preview pane if you wish to test the link
before creating it.
8. Click the Create button. 
Figure 6-9:
Linking to
another

page. 
105
Chapter 6: Nuts and Bolts: Working with Text and Links

You can set the link to open in a new browser window by adjusting the When
Clicked, the Link Will Open In setting. However, for pages within your site,
you almost always want to simply use the same browser window, the default
option. Multiple browser windows can be annoying for users, and so you only
want to use this option if you have a compelling reason to do so. 
Linking to a page elsewhere on the Web
If you want to refer your visitors to another Web site, create an external link
by following these instructions: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Select the word or words that you want to use as the link text. 
3. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
The Link dialog box appears. 
4. Choose the Another Web Site option from the Select the Type of Link
drop-down menu.
The Link dialog box changes its options, as shown in Figure 6-10. 
5. In the Enter the Destination URL text box, enter the URL (Web address)
of the Web page you want to link to. 
To ensure accuracy, I recommend locating the Web page in your browser
and then copying and pasting the URL from your browser’s Address box. 
6. Decide whether you wish to have the destination page open in the
same window (replacing the existing page) or else in a new browser
window. Select the desired option from the When Clicked, the Link
Will Open In drop-down menu. 
Figure 6-10:

106
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

For Web links that take visitors off of your Web site to another destina-
tion, using a new browser window is often a good idea. Otherwise, they
may leave your site and forget to come back. 
7. If you wish to modify the hyperlink text, do so in the Enter Text for
Link box. 
8. Click the link inside the Link Preview pane if you wish to test the link
before creating it. 
9. Click the Create button. 
Linking to an e-mail address
Not only can you link to Web pages, but you can also enable a visitor to send
you an e-mail message by clicking a link on your site. 
To link to an e-mail address, do the following: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Select the word or words that you want to use as the link text. 
This text is usually your e-mail address (such as info@digitalwalk.net)
or perhaps something like Contact Us. 
3. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
The Link dialog box displays. 
4. Choose the An Email Address option from the Select the Type of Link
drop-down menu. 
The Link dialog box changes its options, as shown in Figure 6-11. 
5. In the An Email Address box, enter the e-mail address you wish to 
link to.

Link box. 
7. Click the link inside the Link Preview pane if you wish to test the link
before creating it.
8. Click the Create button. 
Linking to a file
On occasion, you may refer your visitors to a file that is not a Web page.
Perhaps you have a 50-page case study in a Microsoft Word document that
you’d like prospective customers to download. Or perhaps you have a user’s
manual that you created as an Adobe Acrobat (PDF) file that you want visi-
tors to reference. If so, then you can set up a link to these files — make sure
they’re available on your local computer — and SiteBuilder uploads these to
your Web site when you publish. 
To link to a file, follow these steps: 
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Select the word or words that you want to use as the link text. 
3. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
The Link dialog box displays. 
4. In the Select the Type of Link drop-down menu, choose the A File in
My Site option.
The Link dialog box changes its options, as shown in Figure 6-12. 
5. Enter the path of the file you wish to link to into the Select a File in
My Site text box.
Click the Browse button to navigate to the file.

9. Click the Create button. 
Editing and Removing a Link
After you create a link, you can always edit or remove it. 
To edit a link
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Position your text cursor anywhere inside of the link. 
3. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
The Link dialog box displays with the current settings. 
4. Make any changes you wish and then click the Create button. 
To remove a link
1. Double-click the text box that contains the text that you want to use as
the link. 
2. Position your text cursor anywhere inside of the link.

W
ith great power comes great responsibility. Those memorable words are
spoken by Uncle Ben to Peter Parker in the hit film Spider-Man. Yet they
also are a fitting motto to keep in mind when you think about using graphics on
your Web site. The power and effectiveness of images and visual communica-
tion are amazing. Just by glancing at the major sites around the Web, you’ll see
not only large numbers of images, but also the many creative ways in which to
use them. Yet if you’re going to use the power of images on your Web site, you
need to use them responsibly. The reason is that every graphic you use can
“weigh down” your Web page and make it longer to download, especially for
those visitors using dialup access. 
Smart Web site designers take Uncle Ben’s advice and make sure that the
graphics they use on their Web pages both serve an important purpose and
are relatively “lightweight.” This combination smacks of “Spidey Sense:” 
powerful. 
In this chapter, you explore the balance of using the power of graphics 
effectively and responsibly. As you aim for that balanced approach, you
explore the types of graphics you should (and should not) use on your 
Web site. Then you dive into the nitty-gritty of how to work with pictures
inside of SiteBuilder. 
Be Choosy: Why All Graphics 
Aren’t Created Equal
When you begin adding pictures to your Web site, keep in mind these two
important factors that can help you decide what kinds of pictures to use and

what not to use: the type and size of the graphic. Getting a solid grasp of
these issues goes a long way in achieving that “power and responsibility” 
balance for your Web site. 
Choosing the best Web graphic types
Generally, graphic files are identified by their file extension: GIF graphics
have a .gif extension, JPG graphics have a .jpg extension, and PNGs 
have a .png extension. These three formats are popular because they are
compression-based formats — meaning that they take up less space and
require much less time to download than other uncompressed formats, 
such as Windows BMP files. 
JPG and GIF graphics are the two most widely used image formats on the
Web. PNG is a third format that’s becoming popular for Web use, but it still
lags behind in overall support across browsers.
You can think of JPG, GIF, and PNG formats as something like trash com-
pactors. They take a normal-size image and compress all the “extra air” out 
of them so that they take less space. For example, a BMP file of 1.5MB can 
be reduced to a JPG of just 2.4K! 
JPG omelet: A photo’s “breakfast” of choice 
JPG (short for JPEG, or Joint Photographic Experts Group) is an ideal format
for photo-quality and other high-resolution images containing millions of
colors. JPG is what is known as a lossy compression format, because it works
to remove redundant and unneeded graphical data that doesn’t impact the
look of the image. However, as good as JPG is for photo-like images, it doesn’t
do nearly as good a job on simple line graphics, clip art, and text. 
Choosy mothers (with simple graphics) choose GIF
GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) can often be shrunk to a smaller size than
JPG, though its compression ratio is dependent on the colors used in the
image. GIF also supports only a maximum of 256 colors (far less than JPG),
but it provides support for transparency (clear portions of the image) and
animation (which JPG does not). 
GIF is known as a lossless method of compression, meaning that it squishes
the original image but doesn’t throw out any of data in the process. As a
result, simple graphics that include text and line drawings are often ideally
represented in GIF.
112
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

PNG pong
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a third compression format that has
started to become popular over the past few years. It also uses a lossless
method of compression but does so at a higher quality, with more colors, 
and at a smaller size than does GIF. PNG supports transparency (like GIF) 
and opacity adjustment (which neither GIF nor JPG handles). Opacity adjust-
ment is the percentage to which the image is visible relative to image or back-
ground underneath it. A 100 percent value would show the image normally,
but 10 percent would show the image faintly.
113
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect
Understanding bitmap and vector graphics 
You can work with two major types of graphics
on your computer: bitmap and vector graphics.
Understanding their differences is important in
order to know which are useful for the Web and
to better understand how you can use them. 
Bitmap graphics: The most common type of pic-
ture, a bitmap graphic is a pattern of colored
dots (called pixels) that are combined to form an
image. When you take a digital photo or down-
load a wallpaper for your desktop, you are
working with bitmap graphics. If you happened
to magnify these pictures a whole bunch in a
graphics editor, you’d see that the image is
actually composed of thousands of individually
colored dots that form a mosaic. 
Bitmap images are the type of graphics almost
always used on Web pages. And if you down-
load a picture from the Web or receive one via
e-mail from another person, it’s probably a
bitmap. Bitmaps are used for any purpose for
which you need sharp, clear photo-like pictures
and thousands of colors. The disadvantage to
bitmap graphics is that you lose quality the
moment you resize them. You can usually shrink
a bitmap image without much trouble. But the
moment you enlarge a bitmap, you’ll quickly
notice that the quality of the picture suffers. 
The two standard types of bitmap graphics for the
Web are GIF and JPG. PNG is another popular
format, though some older browsers do not sup-
port it. BMP is a popular format for Microsoft
Windows but is not supported across the Web.
(However, as mentioned in the “Deciding the right
format to use” section, SiteBuilder automatically
converts a BMP image to a JPG image.) 
Vector graphics: Vector graphics are composed
of a pattern of lines and curves (called vectors)
that together form the shape of the picture. The
graphic is generated by math calculations (don’t
ask me how) instead of pixels. The result is that
you can shrink or expand all you want, and
those little math geeks inside of the graphic
resize it without any loss in quality. Now, before
you throw up your arms as to why the Web
doesn’t use these geeky graphic types more,
there’s a catch. Vector graphics never look as
realistic or have the detail that bitmaps do.
Instead of looking like photos, they look like
sketches or hand drawings. 
The most common vector file types on Microsoft
Windows is WMF. However, vector graphics
have no standard support in browsers, so don’t
use them. 

Deciding the right format to use
So which format is better? As good as PNG is, the format is still not univer-
sally supported by all browsers, so it’s not the best choice at this time for
your Web site. When you examine the other two, each has advantages and
disadvantages to think about when you’re deciding which format to use.
GIF is often the best option for graphics with text; graphics that require 
transparency; and diagrams, clip art, and other line-based images that have 
a small number of colors. JPG, on the other hand, is top down the best choice
for true color photos, as well as images with shadows or gradations. 
Fortunately, SiteBuilder takes much of this decision making process off your
hands. If you use any other graphics format besides GIF, SiteBuilder automati-
cally converts the image to JPG format for you. As a result, you can even
insert BMP and TIFF images into your Web site. SiteBuilder handles all the
details of conversion. 
Sizing your images appropriately
Choosing the right graphics format is only half the battle. You also need to
consider the file size of the graphic you wish to use. There’s no hard-and-fast
rule concerning the maximum file size, but you should generally aim to keep
each graphic as small as possible. You should work to keep each Web page —
both the text and the graphics on the page — under 80K or less. Therefore, if
you know that you want to use several graphics on a single page, you need to
make sure that your graphics/text combination still fits within that allowance. 
If you find your images “weighing down” your Web page — which could mean
longer download times for your Web visitors — try experimenting on the best
graphic format to use. (See the “Choosing the best Web graphic types” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.) In addition, you can often crop your pictures in 
a graphics program to eliminate unneeded parts of the picture to save down-
load time. 
If you plan on using pictures from a digital camera, keep in mind that most
digital cameras save high-resolution pictures that are far too big for Web 
use — both in terms of screen size (width and height dimensions) and
“weight” (amount of disk space). Therefore, never slap a digital photo 
on your Web site and publish it without shrinking it first. 
In terms of screen size, make sure the picture is 640 x 480 pixels or smaller in
screen resolution. For the photo’s “weight,” most digital cameras use the JPG
format to store digital photos in an uncompressed state. Therefore, if you
have graphics software or a tool such as Microsoft Office Picture Manager,
you can compress the files before putting them on your Web site. You can
114
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

usually shrink a JPG as much as 40 percent and maintain essentially the 
same image quality as before. And you can often shrink a file as much 
as 60 to 80 percent and still have acceptable results. 
Adding a Picture to a Page
If a picture says a thousand words, then you can save a lot of real estate on
your Web page with a well-chosen image. This section explores how to add a
picture to your page. 
Using SiteBuilder clip art
SiteBuilder comes with a variety of stock clip art that you can incorporate
into your Web site. 
SiteBuilder divided its clip art into several categories, including
 Backgrounds: These images serve well as background images. See the
“Turning a Picture into a Background Image” section, later in the chap-
ter, for more on background images. 
 Bars: Separate certain parts of your Web page with vertical or horizontal
lines.
 Bullets: Use these in image bulleted lists, which I discuss in Chapter 6. 
 Buttons: Button clip art enables you to use image buttons on your
forms. See Chapter 10 for instructions on using these images. 
 Frames: Use the Frames images as images that frame your Web page
content. 
 Images: The Images group contains a variety of different types of images:
frame images (sidebars used in conjunction with navigation bars; see
Chapter 9) on the left side of your page and other image varieties. 
 Photos: The Photos group contains a variety of different photos that you
can add to your Web site. 
Follow these steps to add a clip art image to your Web page: 
1. With your Web page open, click the Insert Image button on the 
toolbar. 
The Choose an Image dialog box is displayed. 
2. Click the Clip Art radio button in the Select From pane. 
The Choose an Image dialog box is updated, as shown in Figure 7-1. 
115
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

3. Navigate to the desired clip art image using the Type and Subtype
drop-down menus in the Select Clip Art pane. 
4. Click OK.
The image is added to the center of your open Web page, as shown in
Figure 7-2. 
You can also click and drag the image from the Site Contents pane and
drop it anywhere on your Web page. 
5. Click and drag the image to move it anywhere on the page. 
Keep in mind that not all of the clip art images SiteBuilder supplies are spe-
cific to your template design. Use care to ensure you don’t clash or mix and
match visual designs as you use them.
Using your own images
While the SiteBuilder clip art can be useful for many purposes, you’ll very
likely want to add your own images to your Web site. Perhaps you want to
add your company logo as the header of each page. Maybe you created a pic-
ture in an image software package to be the highlight of your home page. Or
perhaps you took unforgettable digital photos at your sister-in-law’s aunt’s
nephew’s brother-in-law’s wedding. 
Figure 7-1:

116
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Whatever image your sights are set on, here’s how you add it to your Web
page: 
1. With your Web page open, click the Insert an Image button on the
toolbar. 
You can also choose Insert➪Picture from the main menu. 
The Insert dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 7-3.

117
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

2. Navigate to the image you want to add, select it, and then click the
Insert button. 
The image is added to the center of your open Web page. 
3. Click and drag the image to move it anywhere on the page. 
SiteBuilder adds the picture to your Web page and also copies the pic-
ture file to the Images folder of your Web site. You can access the copied
file by expanding the images folder in the Site Contents pane. 
You can also drag an image from your Windows Explorer window and drop it
on top of your Web page in SiteBuilder. This technique is the quickest way to
add an image to your Web site. 
Moving a Picture Around the Page
Moving a picture is just like moving any object on a page. You can do it by fol-
lowing these steps: 
1. Click the picture you want to move, keeping your mouse button down. 
A flashing blue border appears around the selected picture.
2. Drag the image to the desired new location. 
3. Release the mouse button. 
Or, if you want pixel-level precision when you move the image, you have two
alternatives: 
 Press your arrow keys to move the selected picture one pixel at a time. 
 Double-click the picture to display the Picture Properties dialog box and
then click the Coordinates tab. (See Figure 7-4.) Enter new x, y coordi-
nates in the text boxes, and click OK. 
Figure 7-4:

118
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Changing the Properties of Your Picture
Each picture on your page has certain properties — filename, alt text, and
target window, for example — associated with it. You can access and modify
these properties through the Picture Properties dialog box, as shown in
Figure 7-5.
You can access the dialog box in one of three ways: 
 Double-click any image on your page.
 Select the picture and press the Enter key.
 Right-click the picture and choose Properties from the contextual menu
that appears.
The next sections describe the various functions you can perform using the
Picture Properties dialog box, including changing the image, supplying Alt
Text, and setting up a mouse-over effect. You can also set up Web links, resize
the picture, and change its x, y coordinates (which I describe later in the
chapter). 
Changing the image
The Picture text box in the Picture Properties dialog box shows the filename
of the selected image. If you’d like to replace the current picture with
another, click the Browse button, select another image, and click OK. 
Assigning Alt Text 
While visitors to your site will almost always be able to view the images on
your Web site, you need to be prepared to handle the rare occasions in which
images do not display properly. For example, suppose a dialup visitor to your
site has disabled images in her Web browser. 
Figure 7-5:
Tweaking
the
properties
of your
image. 
119
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

The Alt Text (short for alternate text) property allows you to use words to
express the same idea your picture does visually. Add a text-based alterna-
tive for your image in this text box. 
Even more important, Alt Text is used quite extensively by the visually
impaired, who may have systems configured to “read” this text to them.
Specifying a mouse-over image
A mouse-over is the most common visual effect on the Web and, if done effec-
tively and for the right purposes, can enhance the overall experience of your
Web site. A mouse-over involves an image changing to another image when
the mouse pointer moves over it. This technique is usually achieved by using
JavaScript to do the image swapping process. 
You can define a mouse-over image in the Picture Properties dialog box by
entering the filename in the Mouse-Over Picture text box. SiteBuilder adds
the appropriate image swapping code behind the scenes for you. 
Figures 7-6 and 7-7 demonstrate the changes that occur when a visitor hovers
the mouse over the picture. 
If you define a mouse-over image, make sure it is the same dimensions as the
original image to ensure a smooth transition. 
120
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 
Alt Text mistakes
People make two common mistakes when using
Alt Text: 
 Ignoring Alt Text. Some people are confused
about what Alt Text is or why it is needed, so
they simply ignore it. For the vast majority of
visitors, ignoring Alt Text is fine. But when
you have an occasional person who comes
to your site but can’t handle pictures, then
you make it difficult for him or her to navigate
or understand your Web site. 
 Describing your images. Other people use
Alt Text to simply describe the image rather
than provide a text-based substitute. For
example, suppose you have a graphic that
displays your recommended product for the
week. If you simply describe the image, you
might say Photo of Recommendation,
which would be of no help to the text-only
visitor. However, if you instead use Our
Weekly 
Recommendation: 
The
Sunlight Squiggly, by Maple
Stirdale, then you can be sure you are
communicating to all visitors of your site
rather than most of them.

Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

Assigning a Link to Your Picture
While Chapter 6 discusses how to add text-based links to your Web page, you
may also want to use a picture as the jumping-off point to another Web page,
an e-mail address, or other document. To do so, follow these steps: 
1. Double-click the image you want to link. 
The Picture Properties dialog box makes an appearance. (Refer to 
Figure 7-5.) 
2. In the Select the Type of Link drop-down menu, choose the desired
type of link. 
For details on each of these link types, see Chapter 6. 
3. Provide the link specifics for the type of link you’re creating: 
• Another page in your site: Click the Browse button and select the
appropriate file. 
• Another Web site: Enter the URL in the space provided. 
• An e-mail address: Enter the e-mail address. 
• A file in your site — a Word or PDF file, for example: Click the
Browse button and select the desired file. 
4. Choose the desired destination from the Target Window drop-down
menu. 
As Chapter 6 discusses, except for links to other Web sites, you’ll usually
want to keep the link in the same browser window. 
5. Click OK. 
You can also assign a link to your image by right-clicking an image and choos-
ing Link To from the contextual menu that appears (or by pressing Ctrl+L). The
Link dialog box that displays is nearly identical to the text Link dialog box. 
Sizing Up a Picture 
After you have the picture on your Web page, SiteBuilder allows you to
tweak, fiddle, tug, yank, and twist the image so that it fits into the exact space
you have available for it. 
Because you can resize images inside of SiteBuilder, you don’t have to get the
dimensions perfectly right inside your graphics program before adding it to
your Web site. As long as you use a format other than GIF, SiteBuilder auto-
matically creates a new JPG copy of your image sized according to the sizing
122
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

dimensions you specify. Therefore, if you place a large digital photo image on
your Web page and resize it to a smaller size that fits on the page, SiteBuilder
makes a smaller copy of the larger original for you. 
However, you should keep in mind that when you resize an image (primarily
enlarge), you are invariably going to deteriorate the quality to some extent.
(See the “Understanding bitmap and vector graphics” sidebar, earlier in this
chapter, for all the details.) If the size change is proportionally small to the
overall size, then the quality loss very well may be invisible to the human
eye, but the greater the change, the greater the loss in quality. 
Resizing a picture
Okay, if you’ve considered all the caveats about resizing that I outline in the
preceding section, and you still want to do it, here’s how you can do it with
your mouse: 
1. Click to select the picture you want to resize. 
A flashing blue border appears around the selected image.
2. Click one of the blue handles on the outside of the picture, and keep
your mouse button down. 
• To expand or shrink the width, click the left or right handle. 
• To expand or shrink the height, click the top or bottom handle. 
• To expand or shrink both the height and width at the same time,
click a corner handle. 
To ensure that your picture width and height stay in proportion to each
other, be sure to only resize using the corner handles. 
3. Drag the mouse to the appropriate size. 
4. Release the mouse button. 
You can also resize to a precise pixel size by modifying its Width and Height
properties. Here’s how:
1. Double-click the picture to display the Picture Properties dialog box
and then click the Coordinates tab. (Refer to Figure 7-4.) 
2. Edit the Width and Height values and then click OK. 
Returning a picture to its original size
I can be dangerous with resizing. I get a brilliant idea as to how good a pic-
ture will look on a different part of the page, and so I resize the image to fit
123
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

into this new position. But something’s not quite right, so I tweak some more.
When that idea doesn’t pan out, I try a different idea, resizing more and more
and more. But before long, I realize I’ve so screwed up the dimensions of the
image that I don’t know what it should look like or what its original size even
was. 
If you get into a spot like I find myself in frequently, SiteBuilder has just the
tool for you and me. You can reset the picture to its original size with just a
couple of steps: 
1. Right-click the picture to reset. 
2. Choose the Original Size item from the contextual menu that appears. 
SiteBuilder restores your original width and height values. 
Creating a Thumbnail Picture
SiteBuilder enables you to easily create thumbnail pictures on your Web site.
A thumbnail is a small image that is linked to a larger version of the same
image. You can see this technique being used on many real estate sites, in
which you click a small thumbnail image of a house to see the normal-size
picture. But it also comes in handy for product photos, photo albums, and 
so on. 
The major benefit of using thumbnails is that you can pack a lot of pictures
onto a single page that might otherwise spread out over several pages. Yet
when a visitor needs to see the details of one or more of those images, they
can do so with a single click. Neat, huh?
To create a thumbnail
1. Right-click the picture you want to transform into a thumbnail. 
2. Choose the Thumbnail submenu from the contextual menu that
appears and then choose the size of the thumbnail picture: Very
Small, Small, Medium, Large, or Very Large. 
SiteBuilder resizes the picture to the desired size and adds a link to the
full-size image of the original. 
When a visitor clicks the thumbnail image, the image is shown in its orig-
inal size inside of a blank browser window, as shown in Figure 7-8. 
124
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Turning a Picture into 
a Background Image
A background image is one that displays behind everything else on your Web
page. You can use background images to add a finishing touch to your overall
Web site design. 
Keep in mind these considerations when using background images: 
 Tiling effect: No matter the size, the background image is always tiled
behind the page to fill up the entire contents of the browser window. So
if you use a background that shows up once when viewed on a 800 x 600
screen, the tiling effect causes the background to show up multiple
times for a visitor with a high-resolution screen, such as 1600 x 1280. 
 Readability: When you select a background image, make sure that it
doesn’t become a distraction for visitors and doesn’t make the text that
displays on top of the image hard to read. 
Figure 7-8:
Viewing the
destination
of a
thumbnail. 
125
Chapter 7: Picture Perfect

Follow these steps to add a background picture to a Web page open in
SiteBuilder: 
1. Have the picture available inside of SiteBuilder. 
See the “Adding a Picture to a Page” section, earlier in the chapter. 
2. Right-click the image, and choose Set as Background from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
If you’re working with an image inside of the Site Contents pane, you
don’t need to add it to page first. You can right-click the item right within
the pane. 
Two things happen after this step:
• Your image appears as the background on your page.
• A Background placeholder is shown in the Page Effects pane. 
Figure 7-9 shows the results in SiteBuilder.

126
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

After you add the background picture to your Web page, you can’t select 
it inside of the page, as you can with other pictures or other page elements.
Instead, you use the Page Effects pane for modifying or deleting the 
background. 
To modify a background picture
1. Double-click the Background placeholder in the Page Effects pane. 
The Choose a Background dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-10. 
2. Click the Browse button and select the new background image you
want to use, and then click OK. 
To delete a background picture
1. Select the Background placeholder in the Page Effects pane. 
2. Press the Delete key. 
Your background image is removed, quicker than you can say “Green
Goblin.”

T
echnology progress is often overrated, but sometimes innovation just
makes life a heck of a lot easier. Before visual tools such as SiteBuilder
and other HTML innovations came along, table creation was at the very heart
of Web page design; all the page layout had to be done within the invisible
grids of tables. Therefore, in order to arrange text, images, and other page
elements beside and around each other, you had to develop an elaborate,
messy, and wickedly complicated system of tables within tables within
tables. Yucksville! 
Using SiteBuilder, you are indeed fortunate: You have no need to use tables
simply for arranging page elements beside each other, because you can do
that far easier by simply moving page elements around your page with your
mouse. Instead, you’re now free to use tables for what they were designed 
for — stuff such as displaying tabular, spreadsheet-like information, lists, or
side-by-side labels and text boxes in a data entry form. In this chapter, you
explore how to work with tables in SiteBuilder. 
Inserting a Table on a Page
SiteBuilder provides two separate ways of adding a table to your page. You
can add a quick table using the toolbar or set up a table more precisely using
the menu. I discuss both approaches in this section. 

The quick-and-easy approach: 
Using the toolbar
The quickest and easiest way to create a table in SiteBuilder is by using the
toolbar button. Using it, you can add a basic table to your page without wor-
rying about formatting the settings of the table up front. 
If you’ve used Microsoft Word’s Insert Table toolbar button to add a table,
SiteBuilder follows a similar process. 
To add a table using the toolbar, follow these steps:
1. Click the Insert Table button on the toolbar. 
A table grid drops down from the toolbar, as shown in Figure 8-1. 
2. Specify the number of rows and columns of the table by sliding your
mouse to the cell that will serve as the bottom-right cell of your table. 
As you move your mouse to a new cell, SiteBuilder updates the table
dimensions (specified as number of columns x number of rows — 3x5,
for example) inside of the active cell. 
3. When you have selected the desired dimensions of the table, click the
active cell. 
The new table is added to the center of your Web page (see Figure 8-2). 
Figure 8-1:
Adding a
quick table
to your
page.
130
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Your table is now ready to go. 
You’ll want to stretch the table to the appropriate width and height before
adding content. You can resize the table just as you would any other page ele-
ment (see Chapter 3 for resizing).
The detail-oriented approach: Using 
the Create New Table dialog box
You can also set up a table more precisely by using the Create New Table
dialog box. While you specify more formatting property settings up front, 
you can always change them later. (See the “Adjusting the Table Formatting
Properties” section, later in the chapter.) 
Add a table using the Create New Table dialog box with these steps:
1. Choose Table➪Insert Table from the main menu. 
Or, if you have a real love for the Insert menu, choose Insert➪Table. This
command takes you to the same place. 
The Create New Table dialog box makes an appearance, as shown in
Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-2:
Your new
table, made
to order.
131
Chapter 8: Off to the Woodshop: Building Tables

2. Specify the dimensions of the table grid by adjusting the Columns and
Rows boxes. 
3. Specify the amount of spacing (in pixels) that you want to separate
each cell. 
4. Adjust the table and cell border style, width, and color. 
Tinker with the border properties to get the table looking just right. So
start with what you think works; you can always tweak it later. 
5. Click OK. 
The table is added to the center of your page. Resize your table to the
approximate size of your content. 
Filling Your Table with Content
You can add text to a table simply by double-clicking a cell. A text cursor
shows up inside of the cell, ready, willing, and able to help you type some
text. Follow the same procedures I discuss in Chapter 6 for working with text. 
You don’t need to add a text element to a table cell in order to enter text. 
While text is the most common type of content that you can add to a table,
you can also insert other page element types in a cell. To do so, double-click
a cell and then add the desired element as you normally would on the page
itself. For most elements, the cell dimensions are automatically expanded to
fit the contents of the element. However, for image elements, the image
shrinks to fit the size of the existing dimensions of the cell. 
One of the great things about the Design pane is its drag-and-drop-capability.
You can drag any element on a page you’re working on and drop it into a
table cell. 
Figure 8-3:
Creating a
table more
precisely.
132
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Because you can freely position and arrange different page elements inside 
of a SiteBuilder page, you normally don’t need to insert nontextual page ele-
ments inside a table cell. For example, if you want an image to be next to a
paragraph of text, simply arranging a text element and an image element side
by side is the easier way to go, rather than using the table for alignment. 
Adjusting the Table Formatting
Properties
You can adjust the formatting properties of a table to get the borders and
spacing looking exactly as you want them. To do so, follow these steps: 
1. Click a table with your mouse to select it. 
2. Position your mouse cursor over the table border (not inside a cell),
right-click, and then choose Properties from the contextual menu that
appears. 
The Table Properties dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 8-4. 
3. Adjust the Spacing and Border properties as desired. 
4. Click OK. 
Your table updates to reflect your changes. 
When adjusting the properties of an individual cell (such as background
color or justification), you can treat the cell just like a text element. See
Chapter 6 for modifying the properties of text elements. 
Figure 8-4:
Tweaking
the

of your

133
Chapter 8: Off to the Woodshop: Building Tables

Experiment with borderless tables (with invisible table and cell borders), 
distinguishing as needed between rows and columns with background color.
You’ll notice that most of the top sites on the Web never use standard table
borders because they look unprofessional. 
Selecting Table Cells
You can select a single cell simply by clicking it. However, you can select mul-
tiple cells inside your table in two different ways: 
 Click a single cell and then drag your mouse into each of the other cells
you want to select. 
 Click a single cell and then press the Ctrl key while you click each addi-
tional cell you want to select. 
If you’re used to working with tables in Microsoft Word, here’s one difference
between Word and SiteBuilder: You can’t select an entire row or column by
clicking its edge. Instead, to select an entire row or column, you need to click
your mouse in a cell and then drag it across all the other cells in the row or
column to select them. 
Tweaking the Table
Chances are that no matter how you initially configure the dimensions of
your table, you’ll probably need to tweak it once you start adding content.
Perhaps you need to add more rows. Maybe a column needs adjusting. Or
perhaps you want to merge two cells. It’s always something. Not to worry,
though. This section shows you how to adjust the table to fit your needs. 
Inserting a new row
You can insert a new row into a table either at the bottom of the table or
above the currently selected row. You can do so by doing the following steps. 
To append a row to the bottom of the table
1. Click any table border to select the entire table. 
Make sure you don’t click in a cell (see Figure 8-5). 
2. Right-click and then choose Table➪Insert Table Row from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
A new row is added to the bottom of the table, as shown in Figure 8-6.

Chapter 8: Off to the Woodshop: Building Tables

To add a new row above the currently selected row
1. Click in a cell in the row you want to follow the new row. 
Figure 8-7 shows a cell being selected for this process. 
2. Right-click and choose Table➪Insert Table Row from the contextual
menu that appears.
A new row is added above the row you’re working on, as shown in 
Figure 8-8. 
If you have multiple rows selected, the new row is inserted above the
topmost selected row. 
Inserting a new column
You can add new columns either at the end of your table or before the cur-
rently selected column. 
To append a column to the right of the table
1. Click any table border to select the entire table. 
Make sure you don’t click in a cell.

2. Right-click and choose Table➪Insert Table Column from the contex-
tual menu that appears.
A new column is added to the right of the table. 
To add a new column to the left of the currently selected row
1. Click in a cell in the column you want to come after the new column. 
2. Right-click and choose Table➪Insert Table Column from the contex-
tual menu that appears.
A new column is added before the column you’re working on. 
If you have multiple columns selected, the new column comes to the left
of the leftmost selected column. 
Deleting a row or column
If you’ve warned a row or column multiple times, and it’s still acting up, you
have only one choice left as a responsible Web site builder: Delete it. 
Figure 8-8:

To delete a column or row
1. Click a cell in the column or row you want to remove from the digital
face of the earth. 
2. Right-click and choose either Table➪Delete Table Column or
Table➪Delete Table Row from the contextual menu that appears. 
3. Click Yes to confirm the deletion. 
You won’t see that row or column acting up again. However, if you feel
bad and have a change of heart, you can always undo your action and
restore the table piece. 
Merging two cells
You can merge two or more cells to form a single cell inside your table. To do
so, follow these steps: 
1. Click the first cell that you want to merge. 
2. Drag your mouse across the remaining cells to include in the merger. 
Figure 8-9 shows two cells selected for merging.

3. Right-click and choose Table➪Merge Cells from the contextual menu
that appears.
The cells are now unified, solidified, and otherwise morphified into one
(see Figure 8-10). 
Any text in the cells now display inside of separate text elements. You need
to combine them yourself by cutting the text from one text element and past-
ing it into the next. 
Splitting a cell 
If you want to split a cell in your table, you don’t need to go to a biochemistry
lab at your local university. Instead, simply follow these steps:
1. Click the cell(s) you want to split. 
2. Right-click and choose Table➪Split Table Cells from the contextual
menu that appears. 
The Split Table Cells dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-11.

T
he great explorers in history — such as Columbus and Magellan — had it
rough. Back in the 1400s, they risked life and limb as they spent months,
even years, navigating the globe. Yet had they been born 500 years later, they
could have traversed the same distance in mere hours, riding in a climate-
controlled airplane, even enjoying a snack pack of peanuts to boot. 
In the same way, creating a stylish graphical navigation bar for a Web site
used to be a task that took design skills and a lot of hard work. What’s more,
when the Web site layout changed — pages added or taken away — the Web
site builder was forced to redo the whole navigation bar to account for the
modifications. However, as you use SiteBuilder, you can think of yourself as
being among the “jet set” crowd — hopping on board SiteBuilder and letting
it do the hard work for you, designing and maintaining your navigation bar.
Heck, in the time saved, you can even munch on a snack pack of peanuts! 

In this chapter, you explore how site navigation works using SiteBuilder.
Before diving into SiteBuilder itself, however, you begin by looking at some 
of the tricks of the trade on how you should design a navigation scheme 
for your Web site. After you lay that foundation, you look at how to add 
and modify navigation bars to your own piece of Internet real estate.
Navigating Your Web Site
You can divide most books in your local bookstore or library into two 
categories — “read-through” books and “look up” reference books. A read-
through book is anything that you read cover to cover, whether it is Green
Eggs and Ham, a John Grisham novel, or a biography of Dwight Eisenhower. 
A reference book, on the other hand, is a work that you browse but often
don’t read from start to finish; usually, you use the index, table of contents,
page header, or some other navigation aid to quickly look up a tidbit of 
information. 
Web sites are much like reference books. A visitor comes to your site, usually
for a specific purpose, and may browse for a few pages. But no one is going 
to read your whole site in a logical, sequential order. This “click in, browse
around” nature of the Web means that your Web site needs a navigation aid,
much like the ones used by that dictionary or encyclopedia sitting on your
bookshelf. A visitor coming to your site should be able to quickly scan your
home page, identify where to go and how to get there, and then “click in,
browse around.” 
The graphical navigation bar has become the Web-standard way of handling
the “click in, browse around” process. If you were to add this navigation
scheme to your Web site manually, you would assemble button graphics 
you want to use, insert them into your pages, and then add links to them to
create a navigation bar. However, by taking this route, not only do you have
to create or obtain the graphics yourself, but you also are forced to update
the graphics across each page of your site every time your Web site structure
changes. 
Fortunately, as I mention at the start of the chapter, SiteBuilder comes
equipped with a smart navigation bar that does most of this work for you. You
can easily create and drop a SiteBuilder navigation bar onto your pages —
which means you can instantly take advantage of the following three major
benefits: 
 Twenty-eight built-in graphical button styles, so you don’t have to do 
the design work yourself, including buttons that automatically provide 
142
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

a rollover or mouse-over effect. (A rollover is a Web technique in which
the image changes its look when the mouse hovers on top of it.). 
 A navigation bar style that is coordinated with the overall look of the
template. 
 Easily update navigation bars at any time as your site needs change.
What’s more, SiteBuilder manages the navigation bar updates across
your entire Web site. As a result, you can make the change in one place,
and SiteBuilder updates all instances of the navigation bar. 
Effective Navigation Bar Design
As you add navigation to your Web site, make sure you keep in mind these
three design considerations: consistency, placement, and labeling, which I
talk about in the following sections. A well-thought-out navigation bar makes
your Web site much easier to navigate and helps ensure that visitors can
easily find the information they’re looking for. 
Consistency
More than anything else, your navigation should be consistent throughout
your site. If you place a horizontal navigation bar on the top of your home
page, you should stick with top-horizontal orientation throughout your site,
even if you are using multiple navigation bars for different parts of your site.
Otherwise, people can become confused and disoriented, and may simply
leave. 
Navigation bar placement
“Western” people process information in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom manner.
Given that, your navigation bar should be at the top and oriented horizon-
tally or else on the left side and oriented vertically. A secondary text-only
navigation bar at the bottom of the page is an optional feature you may want
to add. (See the “Creating a text-based navigation bar” section, later in the
chapter.) 
Crystal-clear labeling
When naming your labels on your navigation bar, be as clear and lucid as
possible. For most sites, navigation bar labeling is no place to be creative,
143
Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

obtuse, and edgy. For example, if Gilligan Sportswear, Inc., has a page on its
site that provides background information on the company, a good label is
“About Us” or “About Gilligan Sportswear.” Above all, avoid getting cute and
coming up with your own vernacular and labeling it something like “Gilligan’s
Scoop” or “The Locker Room.” Visitors will be clueless as to what the link
sends them to. 
Short, descriptive labeling
The graphical buttons that make up a SiteBuilder navigation bar automati-
cally expand in width based on the text length that you enter for the labels.
While you have that flexibility, aim not to use it; stretched images never look
as crisp as their original counterparts. Try to keep the labels as short as pos-
sible while still being descriptive. Also, while the labels inevitably have some
variance in text length, work to keep them as close in length to one another
as possible. Having their length range wildly makes for a messy looking navi-
gation bar. 
Figures 9-1 and 9-2 contrast the do’s and don’ts of navigation bar design.

144
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Adding a Basic Navigation 
Bar to Your Web Site
After you understand the basic tricks of effective navigation bars, you should
be ready to add your own bar to your Web site in one of two ways: 
 As part of the initial site creation process
 As you design your pages
Adding a navigation bar when 
you create your site
When you create a new template-based Web site using the Site Creation
Wizard (accessible through File➪New Site), you have the option of letting
SiteBuilder build a navigation bar for you automatically, based on the starting
pages of your Web site. (Chapter 4 walks you through the steps of creating a
new site.) You don’t need to do anything more. The navigation bar is waiting
for you on each of your Web pages. 
Figure 9-2:
The Do: a
well-
designed
navigation
bar.
145
Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

SiteBuilder templates use customized buttons for the navigation bar that are —
luckily enough — available for you when you create a navigation bar on your
own. You can find these buttons by browsing ypur way through the clipart. Just
keep in mind that the buttons won’t have the same name as their associated
template. (Darn.)
When SiteBuilder creates a navigation bar through the Site Creation Wizard, it
names the navigation bar as navbar.nav. 
Creating a navigation bar 
after your site is built
Whether you use a SiteBuilder template to create your Web site or work from
a blank set of pages, you can easily add a graphical navigation bar to one or
all pages of your site. If your site has at least two saved pages and if at least
one of your site pages is open, then just do the following:
1. Click the Insert Navigation Bar button on the toolbar. 
If you already have navigation bars created for your site, they are 
displayed in a drop-down list under the button. The final entry is the
Create Navigation Bar item.
2. Choose Create Navigation Bar from the list. 
The Create Navigation Bar dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3:
Laboratory

navigation
bars.
146
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

3. In the Available Pages pane, select a page to include in the navigation
bar and then click the right-arrow button next to the pane. 
As you click the arrow button, the page moves over to the Navigation
Bar Buttons list. 
SiteBuilder displays only Web pages that you have saved before.
Therefore, if you have an untitled page that you added to your site 
but have not yet saved it, SiteBuilder doesn’t display this file in the
dialog box. 
4. Continue selecting and clicking until you place all the pages you want
included as part of your navigation scheme in the Navigation Bar
Buttons list.
5. For each page in your navigation bar, click in the Display Text field
beside the page and enter the text that you wish to appear on the
button.
See the “Effective Navigation Bar Design” section, earlier in the chapter,
for tips on labeling your buttons. 
6. Set the order of the buttons on the navigation bar by selecting a page
from the Navigation Bar Buttons list and clicking the up or down
arrows to the right of the box. 
The page moves up or down the navigation bar order one space each
time you click. 
7. Select the desired style of the button from the Theme drop-down
menu. 
You can choose among approximately 30 built-in navigation bar styles.
As you scroll through the list, the Preview area updates automatically,
showing what the finished navigation bar will look like. 
If you’d like to create a customized button style different from the built-
in styles, see the “Creating Customized Navigation Bars” section, later in
this chapter. 
8. Choose the orientation (Vertical or Horizontal) of the navigation bar
in the Choose Layout area. 
9. Enter a descriptive name in the Navigation Bar Name text box. 
This text doesn’t appear on your Web site. It’s only for use within
SiteBuilder. 
10. Click OK. 
The Add New Navigation Bar appears, as shown in Figure 9-4. 
147
Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

11. Determine where to put the navigation bar: on just the current page
or on all pages that are linked in the bar. 
You can also open the navigation bar in the Advanced Navigation Bar
Editor for more work — such as tweaking individual buttons to adjusting
vertical and horizontal alignment of the label text. However, if you do so,
you can’t use the basic navigation bar editor later. 
12. Click OK. 
As Figure 9-5 shows, SiteBuilder adds your newly created navigation bar
to the current page or all linked pages. You can move this around on
your page to the desired location (usually the top or left of your page).

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Use It Again, Sam: Inserting Your
Navigation Bar into Another Page
After you create a navigation bar, SiteBuilder adds it to your site as an 
available resource. Having the navigation bar available as a resource comes
in handy when you add a new page to your Web site. You can add a new
instance of the navigation bar to this new pages by following these steps:
1. Click the Insert Navigation Bar button on the toolbar. 
A drop-down menu appears, displaying a list of existing navigation bars
available for your site. 
2. Choose the navigation bar you want to insert from the list. 
SiteBuilder adds the navigation bar to the top left-hand corner of your
page. 
3. Click and drag to reposition the navigation bar in the desired 
location. 
Standardizing the Location 
of Your Navigation Bar
Arguably the most important quality of any navigation scheme is consistency.
Therefore, if you are adding a navigation bar to multiple pages of your site,
you want to make sure that the navigation bar appears in the same location
across all the pages. Even if the navigation bar is only a few pixels off, your
Web site can look sloppy when a visitor ends up moving from page to page.
With that it mind, do the following to set the location of all instances of your
navigation bar: 
1. In your current page, precisely position the navigation bar in the loca-
tion that you want it to appear across your Web site. 
2. Right-click the navigation bar, and select Set Location from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
SiteBuilder asks you to confirm your action. 
3. Click Yes to continue. 
SiteBuilder makes the needed updates to your site and then notifies you
when the updates are done. 
149
Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

4. Inspect each page of your site to ensure that the navigation bar fits
correctly on the page and doesn’t overlap any other page elements. 
Make any tweaks as necessary to any overlapping page elements, but
don’t move the navigation bar itself. 
Tweaking Your Navigation Bar
After you create a navigation bar for your site, your needs may likely change
over time, requiring you to adjust your navigation bar. Maybe you added a new
page to your site and want to add it to your navigation bar. Perhaps you decide
to change the label text. Or maybe you just want to tweak the look of the but-
tons. Regardless of what you wish to change, you can do so through the Edit
Navigation Bar dialog box (see Figure 9-6), which is accessible two ways: 
 Within your page, just double-click the navigation bar. 
 From the Site Contents panel, expand the navigation_bars folder; then
right-click the file for the navigation bar you’re using and choose Modify
from the contextual menu that appears. 
You can perform the following modifications using the Edit Navigation Bar
dialog box: 
 Add a page: Select the page from the Available Pages list and click the
right-arrow button.
A page needs to be saved before it shows up in the list. 
Figure 9-6:
Editing your
navigation
bar.
150
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

 Remove a page: Select the page from the Navigation Bar Buttons list and
click the left-arrow button. 
 Button order: Select the page from the Navigation Bar Buttons list and
click the up or down arrow on the right to move the button one spot
higher or lower on the list. Repeat as necessary. 
 Button text: Click in the corresponding Display Text box for the page
and modify as needed. 
 Graphical button theme: Select one of the built-in themes from the
Themes drop-down list. 
 Button font: Click the Customize button. The Navigation Bar Properties
dialog box appears (see Figure 9-7). Adjust the font style, size, and color
as desired, and click OK.
The font that you choose for your navigation bar doesn’t have the same
limitations as the font for your pages. (For more on such limitations, 
see Chapter 6.) SiteBuilder “burns” the text into the buttons, so the text
becomes part of the graphic itself. As a result, you can be assured that
the font looks the same on every machine, even if the visitor’s computer
doesn’t have the font installed. 
 Button and text spacing: If you want to add more spacing between the
text and the borders of the buttons or between the buttons themselves,
click the Customize button. In the Navigation Bar Properties dialog box
(refer to Figure 9-7), enter the number of pixels you’d like to space the
text in the Left/Right Margin and Top/Bottom Margin boxes and the
button spacing value in the Spacing box. Click OK. 
 Button orientation: To switch between horizontal and vertical orienta-
tion, click the appropriate option in the Choose Layout box in the Edit
Navigation Bar dialog box. 
When you have made all the modifications to the navigation bar, then click
the OK button to save your changes.

Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

Creating Customized Navigation Bars
In addition to the standard navigation bars that you can create using the
built-in styles, you can add other types of navigation bars to your Web site,
such as a template-based bar, text-based bar, or one that contains your 
own images. 
Adding a template-based navigation bar 
When you use the Site Creation Wizard to create your Web site, SiteBuilder
asks you whether you want to create a navigation bar at the time. If you do, 
a navigation bar is created using a customized style that coordinates with 
the template you selected. Well and fine, but suppose you do not select that
option at the start and later decide to add one. To do so, simply create a new
page in your site using the same template (see Chapter 3 for details). The
new Web page will have a placeholder for the navigation bar that has the
same template-based buttons. You can then customize the buttons as
desired. 
Creating a text-based navigation bar 
A common technique that many Web sites use is to provide a text-based navi-
gation bar at the footer of each Web page. This feature enables people who
scroll all the way to the bottom of your page an easy way to navigate around
your site without being forced to scroll up to the top of the page. You have
two options for creating a text-based navigation bar inside of SiteBuilder: 
 Text box approach: Add a text box to your page and create a horizontal
set of text links, spacing them evenly apart to simulate a navigation bar.
(Chapter 6 discusses how to work with text and links.) 
 Navigation bar approach: Create a custom navigation bar without speci-
fying graphical buttons. 
The navigation bar approach enables you to take advantage of SiteBuilder’s
built-in navigation bar management. However, this approach does mean that
the labels are not actually text, but text displayed as graphics (though most
visitors probably won’t notice the difference). In contrast, the text box
approach allows you to work with real text links, but because it’s not really a
navigation bar, you have to work with each link manually. 
152
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

However, before you go ahead and click OK in the Create Navigation Bar
dialog box, follow these steps: 
1. Follow Steps 1 through 6 in the “Creating a navigation bar after your
site is built” section.
2. Click the Customize button in the Create Navigation Bar dialog box. 
The Navigation Bar Properties dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 9-7.) 
3. Clear all the contents of the Inactive Image, Active Image, and
Mouseover Image text boxes. 
4. Specify the font settings you want for the text. 
You’ll typically want the font to be the same typeface as your default
font for your Web site, such as Arial or Verdana. 
The typical size for a footer navigation bar is 10 points. 
5. Enter a value of 5 in the Spacing box. 
6. Click OK to close out the Navigation Bar Properties dialog box. 
7. Click the Horizontal radio button in the Choose Layout section of the
Create Navigation Bar dialog box.
8. Resume the steps in the “Creating a navigation bar after your site is
built” section, starting at Step 9. 
Figure 9-8 shows a text-based navigation bar at the bottom of a page.

153
Chapter 9: Adding Navigation Instantly

SiteBuilder doesn’t exactly know how to handle your refusal to use graphics
when creating a navigation bar, so if you edit your text-based navigation bar
again, it automatically sets the style to be the first built-in graphical style.
Therefore, each time you edit the text-based navigation bar, you need to click
the Customize button and clear the image values from the Button Images sec-
tion of the Navigation Bar Properties dialog box. 
Creating a navigation bar 
with your own images 
If you have your own button images that you want to use instead of the built-
in ones provided by SiteBuilder, you can incorporate them into your naviga-
tion bar design. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Follow Steps 1 through 6 in the “Creating a navigation bar after your
site is built” section.
2. Click the Customize button in the Create Navigation Bar dialog box. 
The Navigation Bar Properties dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 9-7.) 
3. Click the Browse button beside the Inactive Image box. 
The Choose an Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-9.
If the button image you choose already has text (see, for example, 
Figure 9-9), you should remove the title from the Display Text box in 
the Edit Navigation Bar dialog box. 
Figure 9-9:

You return to the Create Navigation Bar dialog box. 
7. Repeat Steps 3 through 6 for the Active Image and Mouseover Image
boxes. 
The dimensions for the Active and Mouseover images should be the
same as your Inactive image. 
8. Make any other settings changes in the Navigation Bar Properties

ne-sided conversations are almost always far more interesting for the
person doing the talking. Once in a while, the person doing the listening
would like to get a word or two in edgewise, if only to ask a question that
spurs on another diatribe. Most Web sites are kinda like those one-sided 
conversations: They talk to the visitor but provide precious little opportunity
for the visitor to respond back. Forms can then become an important outlet
for your visitors to get in touch with you — to ask a question, submit a com-
plaint, or request more information. Forms serve as the most common and
user-friendly way in which your site visitors can communicate to you. 
Forms can be complicated stuff when creating a Web site. But SiteBuilder
makes working with forms amazingly easy. In fact, in many cases, you can 
just drop a pre-built form on your site, and it’s ready to roll without any
tweaks or configurations or confusing server settings. 
This chapter explores how you can use pre-built and configuration forms
inside of your Web site. 

How Forms Work: Discovering 
the “Form Factor”
A form on a Web page is part of a mini-system that is designed to take infor-
mation a visitor submits, get that data to you, provide feedback to the visitor
on the form’s processing, and allow the visitor to easily get back to the rest 
of the Web site. Figure 10-1 shows each step in the process. 
In the Yahoo! world, when a visitor clicks the form’s Submit button (see
Figure 10-2), the form is submitted to the Yahoo! Web server for processing.
Yahoo! handles all this processing, so you don’t have to deal with what hap-
pens there. The server then sends all the data that was captured in the form
to the e-mail address (see Figure 10-3) associated with your Yahoo! ID (or
other e-mail address you specify). Finally, you can just leave your visitor at
the Web form page, so the Yahoo! server sends him or her to a confirmation
page (see Figure 10-4) or, in case something went awry in the process, to an
error page (see Figure 10-5).

Instant Forms: Adding Pre-Built 
Forms to Your Page
Forms are great additions to your site, but they can take a while to look just
right — getting all the fields and labels arranged properly, for example — 
on your Web page. SiteBuilder comes to your rescue by allowing you to
instantly add the two most popular forms out there — a Contact Us form 
and a Feedback form. What’s more, SiteBuilder automatically sets up some
basic validity checking (such as checking to ensure that the visitor filled in
required fields) for the form text fields. 
After you drop the forms into your page, they are completely ready to pub-
lish. You don’t need to make any configurations to get them to work for you.
However, while you can check out the layout anytime, you can’t preview the
form’s functionality locally using File➪Preview in Browser. You must publish
them to the Yahoo! Web server in order for them to actually work. 
For both of these pre-built forms, you can add them to your site and then cus-
tomize them as desired. You can remove extra form elements you don’t need.
Or you can tweak the labels as well. 
The Contact Us form 
A Contact Us form is an ideal way to allow visitors to contact you to submit
questions, requests for call backs, or sign up for a newsletter. You can add a
Contact Us form to your Web site in one of two ways: 
 To an existing page: Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Contact
Us Form from the main menu. SiteBuilder adds the form to your current
page in the Design pane. (See Figure 10-6.) 
 To your Web site: Create a new template-based Web page by choosing
File➪New➪With Template. In the Add New Page dialog box, choose the
Contact Us Page option from the Select Page to Add drop-down menu
and then click Add Page. SiteBuilder creates the new page and opens it
in the Design pane. 
The Contact Us form created using both of these commands is identical. The
Contact Us page created using the template simply adds additional text
above the form itself. 
161
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

The Feedback form 
A Feedback form is quite similar to the Contact Us form but is targeted to get
more information from the visitor. To add a Feedback form to an existing
page, choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Feedback Form from the
main menu. SiteBuilder adds the form to your current page in the Design
pane. (See Figure 10-7.)

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Unlike the Contact Us page, SiteBuilder doesn’t have any template-based
Feedback pages, so you need to create one by yourself. 
Made-to-Order Forms: Creating 
a Form from Scratch 
The Contact Us and Feedback forms take care of many basic needs you have
for interacting with your Web site visitors. However, forms have more to
them than simply getting contact and feedback information. You can also use
them to create online surveys and questionnaires or any other data gathering
you need. For these cases, you need to create a blank form and add form ele-
ments and text labels on your own. 
To add a custom form, follow these steps:
1. Activate the page to which you want to add your form in the Design
pane of SiteBuilder. 
2. Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Blank Form from the main
menu.
An empty rectangular element is added to the middle of your page, as
shown in Figure 10-8. The form looks rather lonely, so you better add
something to it. 
3. Resize the form to a size that can hold all the elements you plan to
add to it. 
See Chapter 3 for the basics on resizing page elements in SiteBuilder. 
4. Add the desired form elements for data entry from the Insert➪Forms
and Form Elements menu. 
See the “Working with Form Elements” section, later in the chapter, for
instructions on how to add and work with each of the various kinds of
form elements. 
Alternatively, you can also use the Insert palette, which I discuss in
Chapter 17, to quickly add multiple elements to your form without need-
ing to use the menus for each one. 
163
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

5. Add a text element by clicking the Insert Text button on the toolbar to
each form element. 
You need to include an accompanying text element to serve as a descrip-
tion label.
See Chapter 6 for more details on working with text elements. 
6. Add a Submit and Reset button to your form from the Insert➪Forms
and Form Elements menu.
The Submit button is the form element that provides the form’s 
“power,” telling the form to send the form data off to the Web server 
for processing.
As with the pre-built Contact Us and Feedback forms, you don’t need to do
anything else before they work. They just do. In the same way, you can’t pre-
view your custom form locally using File➪Preview in Browser. You must pub-
lish it to your Yahoo! Web server in order for it to function. 
Figure 10-9 shows a finished custom form in SiteBuilder.

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Working with Form Elements 
Web forms provide a standard set of form elements that are designed to cap-
ture most every imaginable kind of data. These include the following: 
 A text field is for basic text entry, such as name, address, and that sort
of thing. 
 A text area is for capturing data that may span multiple lines of text,
such as comments, questions, essays, and dissertations. 
 A list box provides a list of choices in which the visitor selects one (or
more) of the items from the list. 
 Check boxes capture yes/no or true/false values from the user. 
 Radio buttons are used as another way to allow visitors to select one
option from a series of options. Radio buttons are grouped, and a visitor
can select only one radio button in a group at a time. 
Figure 10-9:
An online

naire.
165
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

Two types of action buttons are associated with forms: 
 Submit button triggers the submittal of the form to the Yahoo! Web
server for processing. 
 Reset button clears all the data entry fields in the form, so the user can
start over with a clean slate, a fresh start, an empty canvas . . . well, you
get the idea. 
Figure 10-10 shows a form with each of these elements. If you’ve spent any
time at all on the Web, you’ve almost certainly filled out forms containing
these kinds of elements. 
The following sections detail how to add each of these elements to your form.

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Adding a text field or text area 
The Text Field and Text Area elements are the elements you want to use for
fill-in-the-blank type information. If the data is one word or a group of words
(such as name, e-mail, or address), then use a text field. If the data involves
sentences or even paragraphs of information, then use a text area. 
You can add either by following these steps:
1. Click in the form to which you want to add the field. 
2. Add a text field by choosing Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Text
Field from the main menu. (If you want to add a text area, use
Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Text Area.) 
The Text Field Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-11.
(The Text Area Properties dialog box looks identical, except the Default
Text box is multi-lined.) 
3. Enter a descriptive name for the field in the Name text box. 
This value is never shown to the visitor but is included in the e-mail you
receive as a way to identify the data that was captured. 
4. If you would like the field to start out with a default value, enter it in
the Default Text box. 
5. If you want to force visitors to add text in this field before they can
submit, then click the Required Field check box. 
Figure 10-11:
Setting up
your text
field.
167
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

6. If you checked the Required Field box, then add a customized error
message in the space provided. 
This text displays to the visitor as an error message in the event that the
field is left blank when the Submit button is clicked. 
7. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder adds the text field or text area to the middle of your form. 
After you add your field, be sure to add a text element to your form as a label
for the text field or text area.
Adding a list box
The List Box element is ideal for allowing a visitor to select one or more
items from a predefined list. 
Each item in the list has two pieces of information associated with it: 
 Text: The text that actually displays in the list box. 
 Value: The text that is sent as part of the e-mail response when the visi-
tor selects this item from the list. 
The text and value are often identical. But by having these as two separate
pieces of data, you have more flexibility. For example, suppose you have sev-
eral free catalogs that a user can select from a list. You could have a list item
presented to the visitor as 2005 Fall/Winter Sports Apparel, while the
data captured and sent to you shows up as 2005-FW-SP-GEN, a catalog
number more useful to you. 
You can set up the list of items and the list box itself by following these steps: 
1. Click in the form to which you want to add the list box. 
2. Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪List Box from the main
menu. 
The List Box Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-12. 
3. Enter a descriptive name for the list box in the Name text box. 
4. Click Add to enter your first item. 
A row is added to the Contents table, and the text cursor is moved to
the first cell in the Text column. 
5. Enter the text for the list item.
Be clear and descriptive in phrasing each item. 
168
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

6. Double-click the Value cell, and enter the text value you want
returned as part of the e-mail response.
7. To have the item selected by default, check the Selected box in the
table row. 
8. Repeat Steps 4 through 7 for each item in your list box. 
As you enter items into the list, note the Remove, Up, and Down buttons.
After you select the item, you can do one of the following: 
• Click Remove to delete an entry from your list. 
• Click Up to move an item up in the list order. 
• Click Down to move an item down in the list order. 
9. You can optionally allow visitors to select multiple items in your list
box. To allow this feature, click the Permit Multiple Selections check
box. 
10. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder adds the list box to the middle of your form. 
Be sure to add a text element to your form as a label for the list box. 
Adding a check box
A check box is the best way to capture information that has a yes/no or
true/false format. You can a quickly add a check box to your form by doing
the following: 
1. Click in the form to which you wish to add the check box. 
2. Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Checkbox from the main
menu. 
Figure 10-12:
Defining a
list of items
in the list
box.
169
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

The Checkbox Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-13. 
3. Enter a descriptive name for the check box in the Name text box. 
4. In the Initial State drop-down box, select the check box’s default state:
Unchecked or Checked. 
5. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder adds the check box to the middle of your form. 
A check box is pretty useless without a text label, so be sure to add a text ele-
ment to accompany it. 
Adding a group of radio buttons
A set of radio buttons resembles those questions on standardized tests you
probably used to take in school. You know what I am referring to — the ones
that required a No.2 pencil and came with dire warnings of marking outside
of the circle. Well, fortunately, with radio buttons, you no longer need to
worry about the consequences of making smudges outside the circle. But the
same principle still applies: You can choose one and only option among a set
of options. 
If you read the “Adding a list box” section, earlier in the chapter, you’ll dis-
cover that each of the items in a list box is defined as part of that same list
box. A group of radio buttons is defined in an opposite manner: Each radio
button in a group is defined separately and then the buttons are linked with 
a common group name. 
Figure 10-13:
There’s no
gray for a
check box.
It’s a yes-or-
no world. 
170
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

Because radio buttons are grouped based on a group name, you can have
multiple groups of radio buttons within the same form. Simply give each set
of buttons a unique group name. 
To create a group of radio buttons, follow these steps: 
1. Click in the form to which you want to add the group of radio buttons. 
2. Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Radio Button from the
main menu. 
The Radio Button Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-14. 
3. Enter a name for your button group. 
You need to use the same name for each radio button so you can associ-
ate them. 
4. In the Value text box, enter the text to submit with the form for the
radio button group when this button is selected. 
5. In the Initial State drop-down box, select the Radio Button’s default
state: Unselected or Selected. 
Only one radio button in your group can use the Selected state. 
6. Click OK. 
7. Repeat Steps 2 through 6 for each radio button you wish to define in
your group. 
Be sure you use the same group name in order for the radio buttons to
function correctly. 
Don’t forget to add text elements for each radio button in your group.
Figure 10-14:
Defining a
radio button. 
171
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

Adding Submit and Reset Buttons
The Submit and Reset buttons don’t capture data. Instead, they’re responsi-
ble for triggering form-related actions. The Submit button sends the form
data to the Yahoo! Web server for processing, while the Reset button clears
any user data from the form. 
Don’t feel obligated to add a Reset button to your form. If you do use one,
make sure you don’t position it in a place where the visitor would naturally
expect to find the Submit button. There’s little more irritating than filling out
a form only to accidentally click the Reset button by mistake and then have
to start all over. (Okay, I can think of a few things in life that are even more
irritating than that, but you get the picture.) 
Follow these steps to add a Submit or Reset button: 
1. Click in the form to which you want to add the button. 
2. Choose Insert➪Forms and Form Elements➪Submit Button (or Reset
Button) from the main menu. 
The Submit Button Properties dialog box makes an appearance, as
shown in Figure 10-15. The Reset Button Properties dialog box looks
identical except for the title of the dialog box. 
3. If desired, modify the text for the button in the Label text box. 
Don’t get cute or creative with button labels for forms. If you change the
text, make sure the action taken when the button is clicked is crystal
clear to visitors. If they are unsure what happens, they probably will
avoid processing the form. 
4. Click OK. 
SiteBuilder adds the button to the middle of your form.

Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

What a Form Response Looks Like
When a form is processed, the data captured from the form is sent to you as
an e-mail. By default, the form is sent to the e-mail address associated with
your Yahoo! ID, although you can specify a different e-mail address. (See the
“Sending the form responses to a different e-mail address” section, later in
this chapter.) 
The e-mail message you receive is based on the following conventions: 
 The From address of the e-mail message is webhosting-userform@
yourdomainname.com (where yourdomainname.com is your domain). 
 The Subject of the e-mail message is Yahoo! WebHosting Email. 
 The text of the e-mail message is structured as name-value pairs:
ElementName=VisitorData. As shown in the “Working with Form
Elements” section, earlier in the chapter, you supply a unique name for
the element. This name is then placed before the value provided by the
user. For example, the following is the e-mail text of a standard Contact
Us form: 
name = Kyle Yoderspenda
email = kyle@yoderspenda.com
phone = 805-555-1212
comments = I’d like to get on your e-mail list. Your products are, like,
really cool!
REMOTE_HOST: 6.111.10.36 
After the Click: Tweaking 
the Form Settings
You can adjust what happens “after the click” from two different places
within SiteBuilder: 
 Right-click a form and choose Properties from the form’s pop-up menu.
The Form Properties dialog box, with the Form Settings tab, displays.
(See Figure 10-16.) 
Select a form either by clicking its rectangular border or any place inside
of the form not taken up by another element. 
 Right-click a form element and choose Properties from the form ele-
ment’s pop-up menu to display its Properties dialog box. The Form
Settings tab of the dialog box shows the same information. 
173
Chapter 10: Giving Your Site More Than Lip Service: Using Forms

For normal uses, you work with only the standard options, which I discuss in
the following sections. 
If you have advanced needs to connect with another Web service, you can
use the Custom Behavior section of the Properties dialog box. 
Sending the form responses to 
a different e-mail address
If you would like to send form responses to a different e-mail than the one
associated with your Yahoo! ID, enter it in the Submit To text box of the 
Form Settings dialog box (refer to Figure 10-16). 
Specifying your own confirmation 
and error page
By default, visitors who submit a form are taken to a Yahoo!-created confirma-
tion or error page, such as the one shown in Figure 10-17. However, I recom-
mend avoiding these standard pages for four reasons: 
 The pages are text-only and look nothing like your Web site. So the visi-
tor is visually removed from your Web site, which can be confusing for
visitors and leave them wondering what happened. 
 The pages can look geeky, which can confuse nontechnical visitors. 
 The page has no links to your Web site. As a result, a visitor is forced to
click the Back button to return to your site.
 The process doesn’t look seamless to the visitor, making the interaction
appear unprofessional. 
Figure 10-16:
The Form
Properties
dialog box. 
174
Part II: Creating “Cool” Web Pages 

For these reasons, be sure to specify your own confirmation and error pages
in the Form Settings dialog box. 
To define custom confirmation and error pages
1. Using the techniques from Chapter 3, create your own custom confir-
mation and error pages with the same look and feel as the rest of your
site. 
• For confirmation pages, you want to let the visitor know that the
form was processed successfully and provide a link to return to
your home page or other part of the Web site. 
• For error pages, inform visitors that something went wrong. Tell
them to try again in a few minutes or to contact you via e-mail if
the problem continues. 
The confirmation and error pages must be located in the same folder as
the page containing the form. 
2. Right-click the form and choose Properties from the contextual menu
that appears. 
The Form Settings dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 10-16.)
3. Click the Browse button beside the Confirmation Page text box, and
choose the custom confirmation page from your Web site. Click Open
to confirm your choice. 
Figure 10-17:

pages.

Web Pages

In this part . . .
E
veryone wants to create a hip, jamming, and wicked
cool Web site. But, in the quest for being innovative,
many people throw gadgets on Web pages that they think
are cool, but only end up looking tacky. In this part, you
explore how to add great add-ons to your site, and still
keep your Web site looking great, not cheesy.

dd-ons. Talk up the add-ons. Back when I was in college, I worked part
time as a waiter. One of the things that my manager drilled into the
serving staff every night was “Talk up the add-ons.” Appetizers, desserts, that
sort of thing. Everyone dining in the restaurant would order a dinner already,
so we waiters were supposed to entice them to order the extra add-ons to
add zest and spice to their meal — as well as a few extra bucks to their total
bill.
In SiteBuilder, you have the basic “meat and potatoes” of your Web site in
text, image, and form elements. However, you also have add-ons that you can
use to add instant interactivity and functionality to your Web site. Best of all,
unlike those fried cheese sticks and brownie pies I used to flog, these add-ons
don’t cost extra; they are simply another part of your Yahoo! Web hosting
plan. In this chapter, you explore how to work with add-ons inside of
SiteBuilder. 

Working with Add-Ons 
Add-ons are specialized page elements that you can add to your SiteBuilder
Web site to provide increased functionality. Ordinary page elements, such as
text, images, tables, or form elements, are generic in nature; they can be used
for thousands of different purposes. In contrast, add-ons have a single pur-
pose to them. When you need your Web site to perform that particular serv-
ice, add-ons become invaluable timesavers for you. SiteBuilder comes with
the following eight add-ons: 
 Counter: Provides a visible counter that shows the number of people
coming to your Web site. 
 Time and Date Stamp: Provides the current time or date as text on your
Web site. 
 Yahoo! Map: Gives you a way to easily add a map to your business, orga-
nization, or other location. 
 Yahoo! Directions: Provides a way to give your visitors an easy way to
get instructions to your business or other location. 
 Yahoo! Search Box: Provides a way for your visitors to do normal Web
searches using the Yahoo! search engine. 
 Site Search: Provides a search box for visitors to find specific content
on your site. 
 Presence Indicator: Lets visitors know whether you are online with
Yahoo! Messenger at that moment or not. 
 Loan Calculator: Enables people to calculate monthly payment amounts
right on your Web page. 
Adding this kind of functionality to your Web site without SiteBuilder’s help
usually means doing a lot of manual coding with HTML and JavaScript. With
SiteBuilder, however, you get all these components put in nice neat packages,
so you can work with them as easily as you can a text element or image. 
I provide you a basic overview and instructions for inserting, previewing, and
editing these add-on elements. 
You can add some Yahoo! add-ons to your Web site — calendars and guest-
books, for example — that are not included inside of SiteBuilder itself. 
These special add-ons are accessible from the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control
Panel (see Chapter 14) and then added to your SiteBuilder Web site as code.
Chapter 12 provides full details on how to add these code-based add-ons to
your site. 
180
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Inserting an add-on 
Choose Insert➪Add-Ons from the menu and then select the desired add-on
from the submenu that appears. You can also click the Insert Palette button
on the toolbar to display the Insert palette, shown in Figure 11-1. In the
palette, click Add-Ons from the left pane and then select the add-on of your
choice. The add-on is added to your Web page. 
For instructions on how to add each specific add-on to your page, see the
sections that follow. 
Previewing your add-on
As you discover in Chapter 4, you can preview your Web site on your local
computer before going live on the Web. To do so, click the Preview in
Browser button on the toolbar (or press F12). The add-ons have different
levels of support for local previews:
 Preview with or without Internet connection. Because they require no
server connectivity, you can preview and test the Loan Calculator and
Time and Date Stamp on your local computer before publishing, even if
you don’t have a live Internet connection. 
 Preview with Internet connection. Other add-ons are fully functional
during preview, so long as you have a live Internet connection. These
include Presence Indicator, Yahoo! Map, Yahoo! Directions, and Yahoo!
Search. 
 Publish only, no functional preview. Not all the add-ons you insert into
your Web pages can be previewed on your local computer. The Personal
Site Search and Counter need to be published to your Yahoo! site to be
fully functional. However, you can see how they look on your page when
you preview the page.

Chapter 11: Yahoo! Add-Ons: Drag-and-Drop Productivity

Accessing the properties of your add-on
Each add-on has properties you can modify. To do so, double-click the add-on
on your page in the Design pane (or right-click and choose Properties from
the contextual menu). The property dialog box that is displayed is the same
as the dialog box that is shown when you first add the add-on to your page. 
Cutting, copying, and pasting add-ons
You can manipulate add-ons just like other elements on your page. You can
cut, copy, paste, and duplicate them by using the toolbar, contextual menu,
or menu commands. For more information on copying and pasting page ele-
ments, check out Chapter 4. 
After you paste an add-on into the active page of the Design pane, you can
move it around and place it where you want within it. 
Inserting a Counter 
Time to move from all these generalities about add-ons to some real specifics.
Case in point: the Counter. A Web page counter is perhaps the most ubiquitous
add-on and one that you’ve probably seen all around the Web. The basic idea
of a counter is that it keeps a running total of the visitors who view your Web
page and displays the number as a graphical counter on your page. 
A counter is a fun feature for personal and other sites in which you don’t care
who knows the total number of visitors who come to your site. However, for
business sites, I don’t recommend using the Counter add-on for two reasons: 
 You may want to keep to yourself exactly how many people visit your site.
If you really want to track this information, use the Site Activity module in
the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel instead. (See Chapter 14.) Not only
is the information for your eyes only, but it also provides more descriptive
information than just a raw number. 
 Some people think visible counters look a tad nonprofessional. Once
again, as Chapter 16 discusses, consider the “Big Boys” test: None of the
major Web sites ever uses counters, so why should you? 
If you’re determined to forge ahead, here’s how to add a Counter add-on to
your Web site: 
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Counter from the main menu. 
The Counter Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2. 
182
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

2. In the Style area, adjust the properties to set the desired look of the
counter:
• Use the Font Color and Background properties in combination 
to determine the right coloring scheme. Keep in mind that the
Transparent background option picks the color of the Web page
itself. 
• The Counter Size property determines whether the counter is
small, medium, or large. 
• The Counter Type property gives you 25 number styles to choose
among. 
• The Number of Characters box enables you to specify the number
of digits. You can specify 1 to 9 digits. Hint: If you need 9 digits, I
think you need more than a standard counter for monitoring your
traffic. 
3. In the Settings area, specify the settings associated with the tally. 
• The Starting Value allows you to use the current setting (starting
with 1) or else start at a number you specify. 
• Select your Time Zone from the list provided. This information is
used only for your behind-the-scenes reporting and doesn’t impact
the visible counter. 
4. Click OK. 
The Counter is added to your Web page, as shown in Figure 11-3. 
In general, you want to move the Counter to the bottom center of your page.

Chapter 11: Yahoo! Add-Ons: Drag-and-Drop Productivity

Displaying a Time and Date Stamp
The Time and Date Stamp add-on displays the current date and time on your
Web page. This add-on comes in handy for occasions when you want your
page to be continually “up to date” with the current date or time. 
The Time and Date Stamp is the one SiteBuilder add-on that is a Java applet.
While you generally don’t need to concern yourself with such technical
details, you should be aware that the visitor needs to enable Java applets 
to run inside the browser in order for the add-on to work as designed. 
To add a Time and Date Stamp add-on to your Web site
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Time and Date Stamp from the menu. 
The Time and Date Stamp Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-4. 
2. Choose the Foreground Color and Background Color. 
3. Select the Font name, style, and size.

Providing a Yahoo! Map 
The Yahoo! Map add-on provides a way to easily link your Web site to a cus-
tomized map from the Yahoo! Maps service. This feature is handy when you
want to provide a way for customers or clients to easily locate your business
location. 
To add a Yahoo! Map add-on to your Web site
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Yahoo! Map from the main menu. 
The Yahoo! Map Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-6. 
2. Enter your address information in the spaces provided. 
3. Add a label in the Description box. 
This text is used as the link text when the add-on uses the Large style
(see next step). 
4. Specify either Small or Large style. 
Figure 11-7 gives examples of both the small and large styles. 
5. Click OK. 
The Yahoo! Map add-on is added to your Web page. 
When visitors click the Yahoo! Maps add-on on your Web page, they’re taken
to a customized Yahoo! Maps map. The large style provides a text link for
clicking. The small style add-on can be clicked anywhere inside of the
graphic.

Creating your own Yahoo! Map link
Suppose you want to offer the same functional-
ity as the Map add-on but need to use your own
text or image. If so, follow these instructions: 
1. In your browser, go to Yahoo! Maps at
maps.yahoo.com. 
2. Enter your address information in the
spaces provided to display the Yahoo! map. 
3. Select the text in your browser’s Address
(URL) bar and press Ctrl+C. 
You are copying the URL for this customized
map to the Clipboard. 
4. In your SiteBuilder Web page, select the text
or image you want to link to the Yahoo! map. 
5. Click the Link button on the toolbar. 
6. In the Link dialog box, choose Another Web
Site in the Select the Type of Link box. 
7. Paste the URL from the Clipboard into the
Enter the Destination URL box. 
8. Pick the target browser window you want
to display the map in the When Clicked, the
Link Will Open In list. 
9. Click the Create Button link. 

When a visitor clicks the Yahoo! Map link, the browser leaves your site as it
jumps to the Yahoo! Maps service. Visitors need to click the Back button in
the browser to return to your site. The only way to have the map display in a
new browser window is to use the technique I describe in the “Creating your
own Yahoo! Map link” sidebar. 
Offering Yahoo! Directions 
Like Yahoo! Map, the Yahoo! Directions add-on provides an easy way to link
to Yahoo! Maps service. However, this add-on allows visitors to enter their
address information and then receive customized driving directions to your
location. 
To add a Yahoo! Directions add-on to your Web site
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Yahoo! Directions from the main menu. 
The Yahoo! Directions Properties dialog box appears, as shown in 
Figure 11-8. 
2. Enter your address information in the spaces provided. 
3. Click OK. 
The Yahoo! Directions add-on is added to your Web page, as shown in
Figure 11-9. 
When visitors enter their address information and click the Show Me the Way
button, they’re taken to a customized page on the Yahoo! Maps Web site pro-
viding step-by-step instructions. 
Like the Yahoo! Map link, the Yahoo! Directions add-on takes the visitor from
your Web page. Visitors need to click the Back button in the browser to
return to your site.

Searching the Web with 
a Yahoo! Search Box 
While the Personal Site Search (covered later in this chapter) allows visitors
to look for content on your Web site, the Yahoo! Search Box enables people to
start a search of the Web from your site. 
You don’t actually have to do much to add a Yahoo! Search Box to your Web
site; just do the following: 
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Yahoo! Search Box from the main menu. 
Unlike most of the other add-ons, the Yahoo! Search Box doesn’t have
any position properties, so it is immediately added to your Web page
without displaying a dialog box. 
A search box like this looks good in the top-left or top-right corner of
your Web page. 
Figure 11-10 shows the Yahoo! Search Box added to a SiteBuilder Web page.

Chapter 11: Yahoo! Add-Ons: Drag-and-Drop Productivity

Just because you can add a Yahoo! Search Box to your Web site doesn’t mean
you necessarily should. The advantage of having a Web search box on your
page is that you can more easily get people to think of your Web site as a
“home base,” so to speak, on the Web. Your site becomes a good home page,
not only because a visitor likes your site, but also because it provides Web
searches. The disadvantage of having a Web search box on your page is that
once the visitor begins a search, he or she is whisked away from your Web
page, maybe never to return. 
Searching Your Site with a Site Search
Perhaps the most powerful of all the add-ons that come inside of SiteBuilder
is the Site Search add-on. Once you add this search box to your Web page,
visitors can use it to find content across your Web site as they search on a
keyword or phrase.

Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Understanding the two 
pieces of Site Search 
The Site Search add-on consists of two parts: 
 The Site Search box: Visitors enter search criteria. 
 The Site Search Results box: Displays the results of the query. You can
specify what kind of page to display the results: 
• A plain page created on the fly. This is the default option. 
• An existing page in your site. This page must be in the same
folder as the page that has the Site Search box, which is typically
the case with Yahoo! SiteBuilder sites unless you do something out
of the ordinary. 
• A copy of an existing page on your site. 
While the default plain page option is easiest — SiteBuilder handles all the
details for you when you stick with the default — the resulting page appears
quite vanilla and plain to your visitors. As a result, I recommend creating a
special results.html page that matches the design and overall look of your
Web site and then identifying that special page as the target for the search
results. See Chapter 4 for more details on how to create a new SiteBuilder
page. 
Inserting a Site Search add-on
You can add a Site Search add-on to your Web site by following these steps: 
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Site Search from the main menu. 
The Site Search Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-11. 
2. Select the Results page option of your choice. (See the discussion ear-
lier in this section for more details on these options.) 
• Click the Use Default Results Page option for a blank search results
page that SiteBuilder handles for you. 
As a result, this page doesn’t show up inside of your SiteBuilder
Web site, so you don’t even have to think about it. 
• If you’d prefer to use a page you’ve already created, click the Use
an Existing Page option and then select the page from the Results
Page drop-down menu. 
191
Chapter 11: Yahoo! Add-Ons: Drag-and-Drop Productivity

SiteBuilder adds a Search Results box to this page. 
• If you’d prefer to use a copy of an existing page, then choose the
Create a Copy of an Existing Page option, select the page to be
copied from the Original Page list, and then enter a new name for
the page in the Page Name box. 
SiteBuilder makes a copy of the original, adds the new page to your
Web site, and adds a Search Results box to it. 
3. Click OK. 
The Site Search box is added to the current page (see Figure 11-12),
while the Search Results box is added to the page you specified. 
As with a Web search box, you often want to place a Site Search box
either in the top-right and top-left corner of your Web page. If you use 
a Yahoo! Search Box, just be sure visitors don’t get confused between
the two. 
4. If you didn’t choose the default Results page, double-click the Results
page in the Site Contents pane if you need to open it in the Design
pane. 
You see the Site Search Results box added to the page, as shown in
Figure 11-13. 
5. Size and position the Site Search Results box as needed. 
Figure 11-14 shows how the site search results display in the specified
Results page.

Chapter 11: Yahoo! Add-Ons: Drag-and-Drop Productivity

Removing the Site Search 
add-on from your site
If you want to delete the Site Search add-on from your site, make sure you
remove both the Site Search box and the Site Search Results box (if you have
a customized Results page). If you delete just the Site Search Results box but
keep the Site Search box, then your search results will be “all dressed up with
no place to go.”
Showing Your Online Persona 
with a Presence Indicator
The Presence Indicator add-on enables visitors to see if you are available to
chat live with them using Yahoo! Messenger. (See messenger.yahoo.com for

more details on Yahoo! Messenger.) This feature can be extremely helpful for
customers who have questions or problems about your products or services.
When you are logged in, the add-on says “I’m Online”; when you are not
signed in, it says “I’m Offline.” 
The Presence Indicator isn’t indicative of your simply being connected to the
Internet. Instead, the add-on tells if you are signed into Yahoo! Messenger
using your Yahoo! ID and enables visitors to send you messages simply by
clicking on it. 
To add a Presence Indicator add-on to your Web site
1. Choose Insert➪Add-Ons➪Presence Indicator from the main menu. 
The Presence Indicator Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 11-15. 
2. Enter your Yahoo! ID in the space provided. 
3. Select the style (size) of the indicator on your page: Small, Medium, or
Large. 
In general, I recommend using the Large style because it is the most
descriptive. Avoid the Small style: If your visitors are not that familiar
with Yahoo! Messenger, they probably won’t understand what the smiley
face signifies. Figure 11-16 displays all three styles. 
4. Click OK. 
In order to receive chat messages from visitors, you need to be logged into
Yahoo! Messenger. Go to messnger.yahoo.com for details.

Keeping an Eye on the Bottom 
Dollar: Loan Calculator
The Loan Calculator add-on is one of those features that is either super-cool
or super-boring, depending on your particular Web site needs. If you have a
personal Web site or have a small business selling erasers, most visitors to
your Web site won’t be thinking about financing. However, if you are a real
estate agent, the Loan Calculator is going to make you feel like a kid in a
candy store. 
Add a Loan Calculator add-on to your Web site by choosing Insert➪
Add-Ons➪Loan Calculator from the main menu. The Loan Calculator add-on
is immediately placed on your Web page, as shown in Figure 11-17. 
The Loan Calculator is not like the other add-ons in two distinct ways: 
 No real Properties dialog box. You can’t double-click the add-on to see
its Properties dialog box. Oh, you can right-click and choose Properties
from the menu. The dialog box that appears is called Loan Calculator
Figure 11-16:
Once, twice,
three styles

add-on. 
196
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Properties, but none of the properties that appear is related to the func-
tionality of the calculator. Instead, these properties are actually form ele-
ment properties, which I discuss fully in Chapter 10. The reasoning is
that the Loan Calculator uses a form element merely as a container for
the add-on.
 You can directly modify the labels inside of the add-on. While the Loan
Calculator has no Properties dialog box to work with, you can adjust the
font style and labeling of the various pieces of the calculator. To do so,
double-click the text to modify and then treat it as a standard text ele-
ment. (See Chapter 6 for more on working with text.) However, you
cannot modify the form text boxes themselves.

The Wow Factor: Adding
Multimedia and Page Effects
In This Chapter
 Adding video and audio media to your site

 Knowing when to use multimedia and page effects and when to avoid them 
I
t’s a bird. It’s a plane. No, it’s a . . . SiteBuilder page effect.
Whether in real life or the world of the Web, people love to be wowed. TV
commercials aim to keep the clicker away by wowing their target audience.
Filmmakers attempt to blast moviegoers with CGI effects that keep them
“oooing and aahhing” for two hours. And Web site builders love to keep visi-
tors at their sites by combining useful information with dynamic effects to
make the Web site come alive. 
In this chapter, you explore how to add multimedia and dynamic page effects
to your Web site. However, as cool as they may be, they can backfire on you if
you’re not careful. So at the end of the chapter, you also examine the issues
involved as you consider whether or not to use them in your Web site. 
Multimedia: Going Beyond Mere Pictures
Text and normal images are the “meat and potatoes” of any Web site. They
are the primary means in which you communicate with your visitors.
However, just as radio and TV proved in the last century, sometimes audio
and video communication can be a better way to share certain messages with

people. Responding to that reality, SiteBuilder enables you to add video and
audio media to your Web pages.
As the “Knowing When and When Not to Use Them” section, later in this
chapter, indicates, using video and audio clips come with a cost — they take
time to download or stream. Therefore, be sure to consider all the factors I
discuss in this chapter before you add multimedia to your page. 
If you rely on video or audio files to communicate to your visitors, I recom-
mend placing a link beside the media clip that takes visitors to the free 
download page of Windows Media Player (www.microsoft.com/windows/
windowsmedia/download), RealPlayer (www.realplayer.com), or
QuickTime Player (www.apple.com/quicktime/download). 
Working with video clips 
SiteBuilder enables you to add several different types of video files to your
Web site, including: 
 Windows Media files (.avi, .wmf, .asf, .mpa, .mpg, .mpeg) 
 RealVideo files (.rm, .rmvb, .ra, .ram) 
 QuickTime video files (.mov) 
When you add a video to your page, it becomes a part of the Web page in a
rectangular container box on your page. The video file is uploaded to your
Yahoo! Web hosting server when you publish your site. Then, when the video
plays (automatically or when the user initiates the play), a media player on
the visitor’s browser — Windows Media Player, RealPlayer, or QuickTime
Player — plays the video inside of a rectangular container. 
Keep in mind that the visitor must have the appropriate player on his or her
computer in order to watch the video. However, all three players are stan-
dard fare for nearly all computers today. 
Add a video to your Web page with these steps: 
1. Choose Insert➪Video from the main menu. 
The Insert dialog box makes an appearance. 
2. Use the Look In pane to navigate to the media file of your choice in
the dialog box. 
200
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

3. Click the Insert button. 
The video media element is added to your page in the Design pane of
SiteBuilder. (See Figure 12-1.)
You can also drag a video file from Windows Explorer and drop it onto
your Web page.
After adding your video to your Web site, you can easily edit how it displays
and plays; just do the following:
1. Double-click the video media element on your page inside the Design
pane. 
You can also right-click the element and choose Properties from the con-
textual menu that appears. 
The Video Properties dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 12-2. 
2. Place a check in the Show Controls check box to display the player
controls (play, rewind, fast forward) inside the Web page. 
If you uncheck this option, the player hides these controls.
Hiding the player controls creates a more seamless look for the video
integrated into your Web page. 
Figure 12-1:
Adding a
video
element to
your Web
site.
201
Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

3. Place a check in the Autostart check box to automatically kick off the
video when the page loads. 
Use this option when you want visitors to always view the video. However,
if the media file is large, be careful about using this option. The visitor
must first download the entire file before browsing your Web page. 
If Autostart is disabled, the visitor can play the video by clicking the
video element on the Web page or by clicking Play if the player controls
are visible. 
4. Place a check in the Loop check box if you want to play the video over
and over and over again. 
5. If you want to switch the media player that plays the file, then choose
a different option in the Player area. 
SiteBuilder determines the initial choice by looking at the video format. I
don’t recommend modifying this setting, because not all three players
support all the various media formats. 
6. Click OK to save changes. 
Figure 12-3 shows a video clip playing inside of a browser without player con-
trols visible. 
Working with audio 
Much like video media, you can add audio files to your Web page. SiteBuilder
supports the following audio media types: 
 Windows Audio files (.mp3, .wav, .wma, .mid, .midi) 
 RealAudio files (.rm, .ram) 
Figure 12-2:
Changing
the way the

inside of the
Web page.
202
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

These audio formats are standard stuff, but the visitor does need a media
player installed that supports the format you’re using. 
Follow these steps to add an audio file to your Web page: 
1. Choose Insert➪Audio from the main menu. 
The Insert dialog box appears. 
2. Use the Look In pane to navigate to the audio file of your choice in the
dialog box.
3. Click the Insert button. 
The audio media element is added to your page in SiteBuilder’s Design
pane, as shown in Figure 12-4. 
After adding your audio file to your Web page, you can modify how the visitor
interacts with it.
Edit the properties of your audio file with these steps: 
1. Double-click the audio media element inside of the Design pane. 
You can also right-click the element and choose Properties from the con-
textual menu that appears. 
The Audio Properties dialog box displays, as shown in Figure 12-5. 
Figure 12-3:

files. 
203
Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

2. Place a check in the Autostart check box to automatically play the
audio file when the page loads. 
As with video media, if the file is at all large, be careful about using this
option. 
If Autostart is disabled, the visitor can play the audio file using the
Player button on the media player. 
3. Place a check in the Loop check box if you want to play the song or
sound in a loop.

204
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

4. If you want to switch the audio player that plays the file, then choose
a different option in the Player area. 
SiteBuilder determines the initial choice by looking at the audio format.
Therefore, in general, don’t modify this setting unless you are certain
that the player supports the file type you are using. 
5. Click OK to save changes. 
Figure 12-6 shows an embedded audio clip showing up inside of a browser. 
Bringing Your Pages to Life 
with Page Effects
SiteBuilder comes packed with several built-in dynamic page effects that you
can drop into your Web pages. For example, you can feature an image moving
around your page border or flying in from the edge of the browser window.
When used effectively, page effects can bring an otherwise dull page to life
and bring a fun-loving aura to your Web site. 
Page effects are different from normal elements you work with on your Web
page. All the other elements drop onto the page of SiteBuilder’s Design pane.
You can then work with them inside the page itself — moving, resizing, and
arranging them alongside the other elements. In contrast, page effects don’t
Figure 12-6:
A sound file
always has

player
controls. 
205
Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

appear anywhere inside the Design pane. Visual effects are shown in the
browser at run time — when the page is being viewed — but don’t display
at design time — when you’re editing the page inside of SiteBuilder. Instead,
the page effects show up as icons inside the Page Effects pane, as shown in
Figure 12-7. 
Viewing the Page Effects pane
If the Page Effects pane is not visible in SiteBuilder, you can perform one of
two actions:
 Choose View➪Show Page Effects Pane from the main menu. 
 Click the up arrow in the blue region of the Page Effects pane to expand
it to normal size. 
Accessing the Page Effects properties
After you add a page effect to your Web page, you can access its properties
by double-clicking its icon in the Page Effects pane. You can also right-click
the icon and choose Properties from the contextual menu that appears.
Figure 12-7:

206
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Cutting, copying, and pasting page effects 
Like all other elements inside of SiteBuilder, you can right-click the page
effects icon to access several functions from its contextual menu, including
Cut, Copy, Paste, and Duplicate. Using these commands, you can copy page
effects between pages or inside the same page. If you need some help on
copying and pasting inside of SiteBuilder, check out Chapter 4. 
Adding SiteBuilder’s Page Effects
SiteBuilder comes with eight built-in page effects that are accessible from the
Insert menu. Use this section to explore both what the page effects do and
how you can add them to your Web page. 
Before you go crazy and add page effects throughout your Web site, be sure to
read the “Knowing When and When Not to Use Page Effects” section, later in
this chapter. It contains several factors to consider before going live with them. 
Dancing with the Border Patrol
The Border Patrol creates an animation effect around the edge of your Web
pages. You can specify an image or set of images to navigate around your
page at various directions and speeds. 
Follow these steps to add a Border Patrol effect to your Web page: 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Border Patrol from the main menu. 
You’ll notice two things happen. First, a Border Patrol icon drops into
the Page Effects pane. Second, the Border Patrol Properties dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 12-8. 
Figure 12-8:
Setting up
the Border

207
Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

2. Choose an image to display for each of the four directions — North,
West, East, and South. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the file you need. 
You can use the same image in all four directions or else use different
graphics on each side. 
3. In the Direction drop-down menu, choose the direction for the Border
Patrol to travel: clockwise, counterclockwise, or random (periodically
switches back and forth). 
4. Determine the size of the margin between the Border Patrol and the
edge of the Web page. Specify the size in the Margin drop-down menu. 
5. Choose the speed at which you want your Border Patrol to move in
the Movement Speed drop-down menu. 
6. Click OK to save the effect. 
You won’t notice any change to the Web page itself inside of SiteBuilder’s
Design pane — everything pretty much stays as is, including the Border
Patrol icon you added to the Page Effects pane in Step 1. 
You can preview the Border Patrol by choosing File➪Preview in Browser
(or simply by pressing F12). Figure 12-9 shows the sample Border Patrol.

Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Jumping with Bouncing Images
If your idea of being “edgy” goes beyond the perimeter walking behavior of
the Border Patrol, you may want to spice things up with the Bouncing Images
effect. The Bouncing Images effect animates one or more instances (actually,
any number between 1 and 50) of an image, making them bounce all over
your page. 
You can add a Bouncing Images effect to your Web page with these steps: 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Bouncing Images from the main menu. 
A Bouncing Images icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and
the Bouncing Images Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 12-10. 
2. Choose an image that you want to bounce around all over your
Web page. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the image file you need. 
3. In the Image Count box, enter the desired number of jumping
instances of your image. 
4. Enter the desired jump settings for the image in the drop-down menus. 
• Gravity indicates the amount of downward pull that the image has
on its jumps. Making it low makes the jumps slower; increasing its
value makes the jumps sharp. 
• Friction specifies the amount of resistance the image has on its
upward jump. 
• Elasticity indicates the amount of bounce that the image has. 
Figure 12-10:

• Initial Height defines the image’s starting point. 
• When at Rest tells what to do with an image that has lost its
bounce — drop from the sky, give it a kick, or let it just sit there. 
5. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Bouncing Images icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect 
settings. 
You can preview the Border Patrol by choosing File➪Preview in Browser (or
simply by pressing F12). Figure 12-11 shows a sample Bouncing Images effect. 
Hitchin’ a ride with the Flyby 
Call me crazy, but SiteBuilder’s Flyby effect always reminds me of the climax
of Hitchcock’s North by Northwest: the classic crop-duster scene. If you recall
the moment, Cary Grant’s character is running and hiding from a plane bent
on mowing him down. The crop-duster does several flybys as it attempts to
encircle its victim but gets a little too carried away and ends up crashing and
burning on the deserted road. Fortunately, when you use the Flyby, you don’t
need to worry about hiding in a cornfield or avoiding a fiery crash, but you do
get an animated image that flies by your Web page — again and again and again. 
Figure 12-11:

210
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

To add a Flyby effect to your Web page 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Flyby from the main menu. 
A Flyby icon drops in the Page Effects pane, and the Flyby Properties
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-12. 
2. Choose an image that you want to fly by your Web page. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the image you wish to use. 
3. Enter the desired flight motion settings for the image in the drop-
down menus. 
• Speed indicates the speed of the image as it performs its flyby. 
• Direction specifies whether you want the flyby to go right or left. 
• Position tells the vertical positioning of the flyby — top, middle, or
bottom of page. 
• Delay indicates how long the image waits after it leaves the browser
before starting the next flyby. You can specify no wait to a wait of
up to 10 seconds. 
• The Offset value is the number of pixels to adjust the position the
flyby relative to the Position value. This value is handy when you
want to precisely position the flyby to a particular vertical location. 
• The Offset Variation indicates the range (in pixels) that the flyby
can occur, relative to the Position value. 
The Offset Variation setting is particularly helpful when you want to use
the Flyby effect but want a certain amount of randomness to the flybys. 
4. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Flyby icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect settings.

You can preview the Flyby choosing File➪Preview in Browser (or simply by

Tagging along with the mouse: 
Text Tail and Image Tail effects 
The Text Tail and Image Tail effects are reminiscent of my clunker of a car in
high school, the one that was always trailing transmission fluid. The Text Tail
effect adds a string of text that follows the mouse when you move it around
on the Web page. The Image Tail effect has essentially the same behavior but
uses an image. 
The following sections show you how to add the Text Tail and Image Text
effects to your site. 
Be prudent in using mouse tailing effects. You are probably going to enjoy
these effects more than the visitor will. 
To add a Text Tail effect
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Text Tail from the main menu. 
A Text Tail icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and the Text Tail
Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-14.

2. Enter the text you want to have as your text tail in the Message box. 
3. Provide the desired settings for the text as it trails the mouse:
• Speed indicates how closely the text follows the mouse movements. 
• Size specifies the size of the text. 
• Spacing indicates the amount of space in between the text 
characters. 
• Style sets the text to be bold or normal. 
• Color indicates the text color. 
4. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Text Tail icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect settings.

To add an Image Tail effect
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Image Tail from the main menu. 
An Image Tail icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and the Image Tail
Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-16. 
2. In the Tail Image box, enter the image filename that you want to use
as the tailing image, the one displayed when following the mouse. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the image you wish to use. 
3. In the Resting Image box, specify the image that you want to display
when the mouse stops. 
Once again, you can use the Browse button beside the Resting Image
box to navigate to the image you wish to use. 
4. Choose the desired settings for the image as it tags along behind the
mouse:
• Position indicates the starting position of the Tail Image when the
effect begins. 
• Tail Length specifies the number of image instances that are shown
as the animated tail. 
• Speed indicates how closely the image follows the mouse. 
5. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Image Tail icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect settings.

Adding random acts of effects 
with Random Apparitions 
In naming the Random Apparitions effect, I wonder if Yahoo! somehow teamed
up with some word-of-the-day dictionary site to include a word in SiteBuilder
that many people may not be familiar with. Well, in case you are in that boat
and don’t know exactly what “apparition” means, let me give you the defini-
tion: An apparition is the appearance of something unexpected or ghostly.
Therefore, the Random Apparitions effect displays images on the Web page
at random locations at random times. It’s all so unexpected! 
Follow these steps to add a Random Apparitions effect to your Web page: 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Random Apparitions from the main menu. 
A Random Apparitions icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and
the Random Apparitions Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 12-18. 
Figure 12-17:

Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

2. Choose an image that you want to appear randomly on your Web page. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the image you wish to use. 
3. Enter the desired number of instances that you want to appear ran-
domly at a given time. 
4. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Random Apparitions icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect
settings.
You can preview the Random Apparitions by choosing File➪Preview in
Browser from the main menu (or simply by pressing F12). 
Staying put with an Edge-Locked Picture
Most of the SiteBuilder page effects are designed to animate an image or
string of text and have it move around on the page. In contrast, the Edge-
Locked Picture effect does just the opposite: It places an image on the edge
of your browser window and then locks up the image and throws away the
key, so to speak. Therefore, even when the visitor scrolls down the page, the
image remains stationed at the exact position in the browser window. 
The Edge-Locked Picture effect is perhaps the most useful of the page effects,
because it can be employed for practical purposes, even on business sites.
However, you must use it carefully and appropriately so that it does not
become a nuisance to site visitors. 
To add an Edge-Locked Picture effect to your Web page: 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪Edge-Locked Picture from the main menu. 
An Edge-Locked Picture icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and
the Edge-Locked Picture Properties dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 12-19.

216
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

2. Choose an image that you want to set as the edge-locked picture on
your Web page. 
You can use the Browse button to navigate to the image you wish to use. 
3. Use the Position drop-down menu to specify the directional position
that you want the picture to display in the browser window. 
4. Use the Offset X and Y boxes to tweak the exact positioning of the text. 
The X and Y coordinates are always relative to the Position value. 
5. Click OK to save the effect. 
The Edge-Locked Picture icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect
settings.
When you display the edge-locked picture in the browser, the picture stays
put even when the page is scrolled. (See Figure 12-20.)

Adding IE Page Transitions 
The IE Page Transitions effect provides animated transitions when you enter
or leave a Web page. If you’ve ever seen transitions used in a PowerPoint
slide presentation, then you have an idea what IE Page Transitions do. 
The caveat, however, is the “IE” you see at the front of the name. IE stands for
Internet Explorer, which means that these effects work only in IE browsers.
Because IE has the vast majority of browser market share, most of your visi-
tors will be able to see them, but you can’t count on it, especially with the
recent surge in popularity of the Mozilla Firefox browser. 
To add an IE Page Transitions effect to your Web page, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Insert➪Page Effects➪IE Page Transitions from the main menu. 
An IE Page Transitions icon drops into the Page Effects pane, and the IE
Page Transitions Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 12-21. 
2. For the transition that kicks in when the visitor enters your page,
choose a transition effect from the Enter Effect list. 
3. Specify the speed of the Page Enter transition in the Enter Time list. 
4. Use the Exit Effect drop-down menu to declare the effect you want to
have kick in when the page is exited. 
5. Specify the speed of the Page Exit transition in the Exit Time list.
6. Click OK to save the effect. 
The IE Page Transitions icon in the Page Effects pane stores your effect
settings.
You can choose among over 25 page transitions. In trying to decide which
ones look best, experiment. To do so, double-click an icon in the Page Effects
pane to display the IE Page Transitions Properties dialog box. Choose a differ-
ent transition effect, and click OK. Then preview the page by pressing F12.
Repeat for as many of these transitions as you wish.

Knowing When and When 
Not to Use Page Effects
Multimedia elements and page effects are a great way to add life to your Web
site and can be a breath of fresh air to an otherwise dull and lifeless Web pres-
ence. However, exactly how much you should use the “Wow Factor” on your
public Web site depends largely on the site’s purposes. 
If you have a personal or family site, go for it. In general, you can be as creative
and artistic as you like for your friends and family who frequent it. If they
become annoyed by anything, they probably know you personally and can
complain about it. However, if you’re designing a Web site for a business or
other organization, you have many more factors to consider. 
Multimedia issues 
A video or audio file can be an effective way to communicate with visitors on
your site. However, multimedia files always are expensive in terms of their size,
so be careful in how you use them. This reality is not always easy to realize
when you test your site on your local machine (where transmission speed is
a nonissue) or if you personally have a high-speed connection to the Internet.
However, always consider the dialup visitor to your site, and be sensitive to
the exponentially longer times downloading any kind of multimedia data takes.
Given that reality, always allow a site visitor to initiate the playing of a large
multimedia file. Frankly, in most situations, unless the file is under 100K, I rec-
ommend not enabling Autostart. 
In addition, you’ll want to avoid automatically playing an audio clip when
the visitor comes to your Web page. Just say no. Cheesy background music
cheapens the impact of the site and probably chases more people away from
sites than any other single annoyance. 
Page effects issues
If you are designing a Web site for your company or organization, you’ll usu-
ally want to steer away from using page effects. Yes, they are fun and can add
pizzazz to your Web site, but they’re almost always inappropriate for normal
business usage. As nifty as they may be, many visitors coming to your site
will find them distracting, annoying, and unprofessional — the online equiva-
lent of plastic gnomes in the middle of your front lawn. And, just as you won’t
find any cute little gnomes in front of the corporate headquarters of Microsoft
or Toyota, you’re not going to find a flyby or page transition at their Web sites.
219
Chapter 12: The Wow Factor: Adding Multimedia and Page Effects

Above all, don’t add Text Tail or Image Tail effects to any site that you wouldn’t
also be willing to put a “we want to annoy you just for the heck of it” banner
on your home page. 
However, some of the effects could be perfectly acceptable for business Web
sites in certain occasions. Suppose, for example, a section of your Web site is
used as a slide-like presentation showing off your products or services —
much like a PowerPoint presentation might look. In this scenario, SiteBuilder
page effects can be an effective, creative way of presenting the information to
the visitor and transitioning between “slides.”

“P
ixie dust” refers to a trail of sparkly, magical material that follows
pixies and fairies. Ancient myth has it that Web geeks have a similar
mysterious trail that follows them, called “geeky dust.” According to the legend,
however, once you get the substance on your hands, you’re done for: you
slowly begin to turn into a geek yourself. Your previous normal life is trans-
formed into one filled with late-night Web programming, chat rooms about
the latest code optimization techniques, and a closet full of Star Wars t-shirts
and comic books. 

In this chapter, you enter geek territory, the “subterranean world” lurking
beneath the surface of your Web site. This techie world is filled with such
terms as HTML, JavaScript, and code — words that can initially seem intimi-
dating. But before you run for cover, allow me to reassure you; I explain only
what you really need to know about this stuff to improve your Web site. If you
follow my steps, you can discover how to add HTML and JavaScript to your
SiteBuilder Web site and get through the process unscathed — emerging at
the end of the chapter 100 percent free from any geeky dust residue. 
Looking Behind the Curtain: 
HTML and JavaScript
I’ve not often spoken of it, but as you work with various aspects of SiteBuilder
to create your Web site, you are actually adding and editing HTML markup
code and occasionally even JavaScript scripts to create your Web pages. As
Chapter 1 discusses, HTML is the “language of the Web” — the coded instruc-
tions that tell the browser what to display and how to display it. JavaScript is
a script programming language that allows you to add interactivity to your
pages.
Letting SiteBuilder get its 
hands dirty, not yours 
The great thing about SiteBuilder is that it allows you to create and work with
Web pages using the handy Design pane rather than being forced to code the
pages manually. In this regard, SiteBuilder acts much like a translator, taking
the design that you create inside the visual domains of SiteBuilder and turning
it into code that the browser can display. For example, consider the Web page
shown in Figure 13-1, created using SiteBuilder. Listing 13-1 shows portions of
the actual HTML and JavaScript code that displays this page. (Please note
that major portions of the code are actually missing, because the complete
file listing ran for over 13 pages. Aren’t you glad you don’t have to type all
this stuff in??!!)

Okay, now that you are probably feeling itchy all over for fear of geeky dust
contamination, don’t fear. You never need to look at your document like this
using SiteBuilder. Instead, when you need to dip inside of HTML, you can do
it through a much simpler manner, which I discuss in the “Peeking into the
HTML Behind Your Web Page” section, later in the chapter. 
Yup, you can “do code,” but why? 
For nearly all page-building tasks, SiteBuilder allows you to ignore, bypass,
and simply forget all about that yucky code lurking underneath the surface.
In this way, you can create, design, and edit in peace without fear of being
exposed to geeky dust. However, you may wish to incorporate some advanced
features and functionality into your Web site — features that aren’t directly
supported inside of SiteBuilder itself, including
 Yahoo! add-ons that are available from within the Web Hosting Control
Panel. 
 JavaScript scripts that provide additional functionality, such as image
effects. 
 Any HTML markup that you want to add to your site, such as special meta
information and code for integrating with a third-party Web service.
Peeking into the HTML Behind 
Your Web Page
Any HTML file is divided into two main parts: head and body. The head con-
tains behind-the-scenes information about the Web page, and none of the
contents of the head actually display inside the browser. You can place the
227
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

page’s title, search engine keywords, and author information in the head
(though SiteBuilder does this automatically for you via the Page Properties
dialog box). The head is also a common catchall place to enter JavaScript
scripts. The body contains all the text and markup instructions that tell the
browser what to display and how to display it. 
The Head section is enclosed in a <head> and </head> tag pair, while the
Body section is surrounded by a <body> and </body> tag pair. 
SiteBuilder gives you three separate ways to access this world of HTML: 
 The HTML element
 The HTML item on the right-click contextual menu of the page (see
Figure 13-2)
 The HTML item on the right-click contextual menu of several page ele-
ments, such as Text or Image
Figure 13-2:
The HTML
item on the
contextual
menu allows
you to add
HTML or
JavaScript
code. 
228
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

In each of these ways, SiteBuilder opens a dialog box that enables you to add
HTML or JavaScript code. SiteBuilder doesn’t provide a page editor for work-
ing with the entire HTML code of your Web page, such as what you see in
Listing 13-1. That’d be full-fledged geeky dust territory! 
Instead, SiteBuilder opens up “portals” into specific parts of the Web page.
Exactly where you add HTML and JavaScript code is critical to its correct dis-
play and operation. Therefore, before you add code to your Web pages, be
sure you understand the differences in these locations — an understanding
that will magically come to you if you read the next sections. 
HTML element 
SiteBuilder has an HTML element that you can add to your Web page. This
element serves as a container for HTML code that you wish to add to your
page. Follow these steps to add an HTML element: 
1. Choose Insert➪Code Elements➪HTML from the main menu. 
The HTML Code dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-3. 
2. Paste any HTML code you may have received from elsewhere, or type
your own code into the box provided. 
3. Click OK.
The HTML element is added to your Web page, as shown in Figure 13-4. 
Figure 13-3:
The home
base for
geek
wannabes in
SiteBuilder. 
229
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

Keep in mind the following in terms of size and positioning on the page: 
 The underlying HTML code uses the top-left corner of the HTML element
as the starting point for its display. You can move the HTML element
around on your page like any other page element in SiteBuilder to posi-
tion it appropriately.
 The dimensions of the HTML element have no bearing on the amount of
space that the HTML code inside of the element uses for displaying itself.
Therefore, I recommend resizing the HTML element in SiteBuilder’s
Design pane after you preview the page in a browser. Doing so enables
you to approximate the real estate being used by the HTML inside of
your SiteBuilder page. 
You can also edit the HTML code inside of an HTML element by double-
clicking it. 
Figure 13-4:

element, a

230
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Page level HTML
If you right-click the page itself and choose HTML from its contextual menu,
the page-level HTML Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 13-5, makes an
appearance. 
As Figure 13-5 makes abundantly clear, the HTML Properties dialog box has
three locations where you can add code: 
 HTML Head: Any markup code that you add here goes inside of the
Head section. 
Place any JavaScript scripts that impact the whole page here. 
 HTML Inside Body Tag: Code you insert here is added inside the
<body> tag. 
Given that, the code must be in the form of a name-value pair, such as
marginheight=”0” or bgcolor=”#ffffff”. 
 HTML After Body: Any code you add here is placed at the end of the
Body section, just inside the </body> tag.

Page element HTML 
The HTML element and the page-level locations for adding code can generally
handle nearly all your needs. However, on occasion, you may need to add
HTML code either before or after another on-screen element that you have.
For these situations, right-click the page element itself and then select HTML
from the contextual menu that appears in order to access a slightly different
dialog box. (See Figure 13-6.)
In the HTML Properties dialog box for the element, you can add code in any
of the following three places: 
 HTML Before: Code added inside this box is placed before the element
you’re modifying. 
 HTML Inside: For code added inside this box, SiteBuilder adds it into
the tag itself. As a result, format the code as a name-value pair, such as
font=”Arial”.
 HTML After: The code that you add in this box is placed just after the
element you’re modifying.

Adding Yahoo! HTML Add-Ons 
to Your Web Site
As Chapter 11 discusses, SiteBuilder has several Yahoo! add-ons — the
Yahoo! Map and Counter, for example — built right into the product itself.
However, Yahoo! also has several more add-ons that aren’t inside SiteBuilder.
You can access these by going to your Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel
(accessible from Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the menu). Once
there, click the Create & Update tab and then click the Add-Ons link. The
Add-Ons page displays, as shown in Figure 13-7. 
Figure 13-7:
The Add-
Ons page in
the Yahoo!
Web Hosting
Control
Panel.
233
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

On this Web page, you can choose among several add-ons, but some of the
most noteworthy include
 News Headlines: Incorporates news or sports headlines into your
Web page. 
 Stock Quotes: Displays the latest stock quotes. 
 Weather: Lists the weather forecast from one or more cities around
the world. 
 Pull-Down Menu: Adds a drop-down menu to your site as an alternative
navigation tool to a navigation bar. 
 Guestbook: Allows visitors to leave you messages. 
All you need to incorporate these add-ons to your Web site are a few simple
steps, which I show you in the following sections. 
You’ll notice that some add-ons featured on this page (Counter, Yahoo!
Map, and Site Search) are the same as the ones provided already inside of
SiteBuilder. Ignore these add-ons on this page: Working with these add-ons
within SiteBuilder itself is much easier. 
Adding News Headlines, Stock 
Quotes, or Weather
The News Headlines, Stock Quotes, and Weather add-ons follow a similar 
procedure for adding them to your site. Use the following instructions for
adding any of these add-ons to your page. I focus on the process for the News
Headlines add-on, but you can follow these same general instructions for the
other two as well. 
In order to use these add-ons, you need to go through a three-step process: 
1. Configure your add-on using the Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. Activate the add-on as a way of telling the Yahoo! Web server that you’re
using the add-on on your Web site. 
3. Copy the add-on HTML code from the Web Hosting Control Panel and
paste it into an HTML element on your Web page. 
To add news, stock quotes, or weather to your Web site, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the menu. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and takes you to your
Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel. 
234
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

2. In the Quick Links list located on the top-right of the page, choose
Add-ons and then click the Go button. 
The Add-On page displays. 
3. From your Web Hosting Control Panel’s Add-On page, click the News
Headlines, Stock Quotes, or Weather link on the Add-Ons page. 
4. Navigate through the configuration process specific for the add-on
that you selected. 
Each service has various options that you need to configure. The News
and Weather add-ons take you through a few pages to select the informa-
tion you want to display. The Stock Quotes add-on provides everything
in a single page. 
5. When you configure all your options, click the Generate Code button. 
The HTML code for the add-on displays in a text box in your browser.
Figure 13-8 shows the HTML code provided for the News Headlines 
add-on. The Weather add-on provides a similar-looking page. 
Note: The Stock Quotes add-on generates the code and displays it in
Step 6. 
Figure 13-8:
HTML code
for an 
add-on.
235
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

6. Select all the HTML code provided in the text box and choose
Edit➪Copy from the browser menu. 
For each of these services, the next step shown is a Go To File Manager
button. Ignore this step! Because you are using SiteBuilder, you don’t
need to use the File Manager. 
7. Click the Activate Headlines, Activate Weather, or Activate Stock
Quotes button. 
8. Return to SiteBuilder. 
9. Choose Insert➪Code Elements➪HTML from the menu. 
The HTML Code dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 13-3.)
10. Click the Paste button or right-click and choose Paste from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
The add-on code from the Web Hosting Control Panel is pasted into the
dialog box. 
11. Click OK. 
The HTML element is added to your Web page. 
12. Click and drag to position the HTML element in the desired location
on your Web page. 
These add-ons do not function when you perform a local preview. Therefore,
you need to publish your Web page in order to see how the add-on displays.
Figure 13-9 shows the News Headlines add-on included on a Web page. 
What’s more, when you activate a new add-on service, you may need to wait
a few minutes for the service to become active for your Web site. Therefore, if
the add-on does not work correctly immediately after activating it, wait a few
minutes and try again. 
Incorporating a pull-down menu
A pull-down menu — also known as a drop-down menu — is a space-saving
alternative to a navigation bar to enable people to quickly go from one part
of your site to the next. Or, if you have a large Web site, you could use it in
combination with a navigation bar: The navigation bar could provide access
to the major sections of the site, while the pull-down menu provides a list of
the most frequently requested pages of your site. (However, for smaller Web
sites, I don’t recommend using both.) 
236
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

To add a pull-down menu add-on to your page, do the following:
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the menu. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and takes you to your
Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. In the Quick Links list located on the top-right of the page, choose
Add-Ons and then click the Go button. 
The Add-On page is displayed. 
3. From your Web Hosting Control Panel’s Add-On page, click the 
Pull-down Menu link.
The Pull-down Menu page appears, as shown in Figure 13-10, with a
sample pull-down menu displayed. The Step 1 box contains the HTML
code to display this particular menu. 
Figure 13-9:
Your Web

237
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

4. Scroll down in the text box and locate the menu item code. 
Look for this code: 
<option value=”http://www.yahoo.com”>Yahoo
<option value=”http://webhosting.yahoo.com/”>Yahoo! Web Hosting
<option value=”http://shopping.yahoo.com/”>Yahoo! Shopping
<option value=”http://travel.yahoo.com/”>Yahoo! Travel
Each of these items contains two pieces of information: (a) the URL that
is navigated to when the item is selected and (b) the text that displays
inside the menu drop-down list.
5. Edit the first line of menu item code to point to a Web page on
your site:
• Change the URL inside the quotation marks to point to a page on
your site. Make sure that your URL remains enclosed in quotation
marks. 
• Change the text after the > mark to create a label for the list item.
Figure 13-10:

238
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

If you don’t know the URL for a Web page of your site you want to link
to, publish your site and then navigate to the page in your browser.
Copy the URL from the browser’s Address box and then paste the URL
into the Edit box. 
6. Repeat as necessary for each item you want to include in your pull-
down menu:
• To add more items, use Copy and Paste from the right-click menu. 
• To remove items, simply select the item line text and press Delete. 
7. Select the entire contents of the Step 1 text box and choose Edit➪Copy
from your browser menu. 
8. Return to SiteBuilder. 
9. Choose Insert➪Code Elements➪HTML from the main menu. 
The HTML Code dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 13-3.)
10. Click the Paste button or right-click and choose Paste from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
The add-on code from the Web Hosting Control Panel is pasted into the
HTML Code dialog box. 
11. Click OK. 
The HTML element is added to your Web page. 
12. Click and drag to position the HTML element in the desired location
on your page. 
You can preview the pull-down menu locally by clicking the Preview in
Browser button or pressing F12. Figure 13-11 shows a pull-down menu
inside of a Web page. 
If your pull-down menu doesn’t display properly, double-click the HTML ele-
ment in the SiteBuilder Design pane, and check for mistakes in the menu item
HTML code — a mistyped URL, for example. If you feel like you screwed up
the code and can’t figure out how to fix it, simply start the process over and
try again. 
Opening a Guestbook
A Guestbook is a powerful add-on you can add to your Web page to increase
interaction between visitors and yourself. Visitors can send you a message
using the Guestbook. You can decide whether you want to have the message
simply e-mailed to you or whether you want to also display the response
either publicly or privately. 
239
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

Unlike the other Yahoo! add-ons included as part of your Web page, the
Guestbook displays in separate pages from your Web site and is only inte-
grated into your Web site through standard Web links. An integrated
Guestbook consists of three parts: 
 A Sign Guestbook page that enables visitors to submit information
through your customizable Guestbook form. 
 A View Guestbook page that displays the information that people have
submitted to you. This information can be public or private, depending
on how you set up the Guestbook. 
 Links from your Web site to the Sign Guestbook and View Guestbook
pages, as well as links from the Guestbook pages back to your Web site. 
Guestbooks are designed for a particular purpose and are not the same as
general-use Web forms. Check out Chapter 10 for full details on Web forms.

Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Use these instructions for adding a Guestbook to your Web site:
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the menu. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and takes you to your
Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. In the Quick Links list located on the top-right of the page, choose
Add-ons and then click the Go button. 
The Add-On page is displayed. 
3. From your Web Hosting Control Panel’s Add-On page, click the
Guestbook link.
4. On the Guestbook page, click the Guestbook Setup link to configure
the add-on. 
The Guestbook Setup page appears, as shown in Figure 13-12. 
Figure 13-12:
Setting
up your
Guestbook.
241
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

5. Enter a name of the Guestbook in Step 1. 
6. Customize the font and background in Step 2. 
Keep in mind that the Guestbook pages are separate from your Web site
pages and not embedded in them. Therefore, you need to try to customize
the look of these pages to get as close as possible to your SiteBuilder
Web site look. 
7. In the Step 3 box, enter any opening instructions or text that you want
to provide. 
Because the Sign Guestbook is on its own page, you want to be sure that
people understand where they are and what they are signing. 
8. In Step 4, enter the type of information you wish to gather from the
visitor:
• In the Question column, enter the Field Name or question text for
each type of information you’re collecting from the visitor. 
• In the Entry style column, select Text Entry for one-line text entries
or Comment Box for multi-line text entries. 
You can enter up to eight questions. 
9. In Step 5, edit the label for the Submit button. 
10. In Step 6, select 5, 10, or 15 for the number of entries that you want to
display on your View Entries page. 
11. Also in Step 6, choose a separator to insert between each of the
Guestbook entries. 
You can choose from a few graphical lines, a gray horizontal line, or you
can specify your own (by clicking the Browse button and navigating to a
image of your choice). Whatever you choose, make sure that it’s consis-
tent with your overall SiteBuilder Web site design. 
12. In Step 7, determine where you want the visitor to return to after sub-
mitting a Guestbook entry. 
• Click the Return Page button and enter a URL to specify a specific
page on your site, such as your home page. 
• Click the Link to Refer Page button to return to the Sign
Guestbook page. 
13. In Step 8, choose the desired options for handling Guestbook 
submissions. 
If you only want Guestbook submissions viewable by you, make sure you
click the Private (Only You Can View) option. 
242
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

14. Click the Preview or Finished button to continue. 
The Preview button takes you to a preview screen. This option is partic-
ularly helpful when tweaking the look of the Guestbook and getting it to
look consistent with your overall Web site design. 
When, after finishing the configuration and preview process, you duti-
fully click the Finished Editing button, a page that provides the HTML
code for linking to the Guestbook appears, as shown in Figure 13-13. 
The URL for viewing your Guestbook is provided at the top of the page.
Bookmark that page so you can refer to it later. 
15. Select the HTML code in the Step 1 box and choose Edit➪Paste from
your browser menu.
16. Return to SiteBuilder. 
17. Choose Insert➪Code Elements➪HTML from the main menu. 
The HTML Code dialog box appears. (Refer to Figure 13-3.) 
Figure 13-13:
Setting
up your
Guestbook.
243
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

18. Click the Paste button or right-click and choose Paste from the contex-
tual menu that appears. 
The add-on code from the Web Hosting Control Panel is pasted into the
HTML Code dialog box. 
19. Click OK. 
The HTML element is added to your Web page. 
20. Click and drag to position the HTML element in the desired location
on your page. 
The HTML code displays the links for your Guestbook. 
Rather than set these Guestbook links as HTML code, you can re-create
these links as normal Web links inside of your Web page. But if you do
so, you do risk getting some geeky dust on your hands. 
To do so, open up the HTML element dialog box by double-clicking it.
Select the URL that is provided inside of the first href=”” attribute
and copy it to the Clipboard. Press Esc to exit the dialog box and then
create a link (based on instructions in Chapter 6). Paste the URL into
the Destination URL in the Link dialog box. Repeat this process for the
second link. After you’ve done that for both, you can delete the HTML
element. 
Using Third-Party Scripts 
in Your Web Site
Many third-party and community-based sites on the Web provide free down-
loadable JavaScript and Dynamic HTML (DHTML) scripts. These scripts can
provide functionality that isn’t available inside SiteBuilder. Each script is going
to have unique instructions concerning how and where to add the code to your
Web page. However, keep in mind that you usually place these scripts either
in your page-level Head section or inside of an HTML element on your page. 
Two recommended sites I’ve used in the past include
 www.dynamicdrive.com
 www.javascript-fx.com
244
Part III: Going Further: Developing “Wicked Cool” Web Pages 

Adding Iframes to Your Web Page
An iframe (short for inline frame) is something like a Web page within a Web
page. It is a region of your Web page whose content is filled from another
URL. Iframes have several practical uses, although perhaps the two most
noteworthy include
 The ability to display scrollable content within a confined area of
your page. For example, suppose you have a Latest News area on your
home page that may contain a variable amount of text. However, you
don’t want to always redesign your page based on the number of news
blurbs. You can use an iframe and define a standard rectangular area for
the news. If the news needs more space, then a visitor can simply scroll
down using scroll bars. 
The iframe is particularly helpful when you’re using some of the
SiteBuilder templates that have fixed regions for displaying context.
Using an iframe, you can be sure that your content always fits inside
of these areas. 
 The ability to update content on your page without updating the entire
Web page. Imagine, for example, that you get your home page design
perfected and would rather not even mess around with updating content
on it. Using an iframe, you could update a separate text-only page that
contains the updatable content (weekly sales, latest news). Then, when
you publish the iframe page, the results display within the unchanged
home page. 
Iframes are particularly helpful if multiple people update your Web site:
The design-challenged individual can update the iframe page without the
resident designer freaking out about changes. 
You can add an iframe to your Web page by following these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Code Elements➪iframe from the main menu. 
The Iframe Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-14. 
Figure 13-14:
Setting up
the iframe.
245
Chapter 13: Adding HTML and JavaScript Code to Your Pages

2. In the drop-down list, select the source of the iframe Web page:
Another Web Site or A Page in My Site. 
3. In the http:// text box, enter the source URL or filename. 
• If the source is from another Web site, then enter the URL. 
• If the source is from your site, then click the Browse button, select
the filename from the list, and then click Open. 
4. Check the Frame Border box if you want to visually separate the
iframe content from the “parent” Web page with a boxed frame.
Uncheck if you want the separation to be seamless. 
5. Click OK. 
6. Size and position the iframe as desired. 
Figure 13-15 shows the iframe element inside of the Design pane.

T
he sheer number of manager jokes tells you that, in

in this book, whether you’re a manager by trade or some-
one who works for one doesn’t matter: Everyone becomes

W
hen you consider your Yahoo! SiteBuilder Web site, you can think of it
much like a small-town doughnut shop. The owner makes the dough-
nuts in a back room kitchen, puts them on trays for display, and then sells
them at the front counter. You may not be creating jelly-filled Web pages, but
how you work with the Web site is much the same way — and far better for 
a low-carb diet! Using SiteBuilder, you create your Web site in a back room,
office, or really anywhere you can put a computer. When you’re ready, you
publish your files to a Yahoo! Web server. Your visitors then come to your
“front counter” — the home page — and browse away. 
In addition, not all tasks performed by the owner in his doughnut shop are
done so in the kitchen. He creates the doughnuts in the back, but then deals
with other matters — such as cash receipts, doughnut displays, and menus —
in the front. Similarly, you create and design your Web site in SiteBuilder. But
the actual maintenance and administration of your site are done online via
the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel. 
In this chapter, you explore the basics of administering your Yahoo! SiteBuilder
Web site. So wipe those doughnut crumbs off your keyboard and discover what
becoming a Webmaster is all about. 

Connecting Major Tom to Ground Control
You use Yahoo! SiteBuilder for creating, designing, and editing your Web site,
but it hands off the responsibilities of administering the Web site to its online
cousin, the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel. 
The Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel is your online command and control
center. You can use it to access any administrative task you want to perform,
such as viewing the number of visitors you’re getting, adding or removing
site files, and promoting your Web site. 
If you ever get confused on whether to make a change in SiteBuilder or on the
Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel, follow these rules: 
 Use SiteBuilder if the change relates to the look or content of the site
and how it’s organized. 
 Use the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel for finding information about
the site’s usage, managing the Web server files, and working with other
online services, such as those dealing with e-commerce or promoting
your site.
When you want to access the Control Panel, make sure you’re online and
then follow these steps: 
1. Within SiteBuilder, choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from
the main menu. 
2. If needed, enter your Yahoo! ID and password in the Sign In to Yahoo!
dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-1. 
If this is the first time you’ve accessed the Control Panel this session,
then you need to supply this information. Otherwise, SiteBuilder skips
this step. 
SiteBuilder then launches your default Web browser and takes you to
the Web Hosting Control Panel, shown in Figure 14-2. 
Figure 14-1:
Signing in to
Yahoo! to
begin your
session. 
252
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

You can also access the Control Panel outside of SiteBuilder by going to
smallbusiness.yahoo.com/services. 
From this Web page, you can access anything related to your Web site.
However, most of your needs focus on the following features: 
 Site Activity module: Your site activity — how many people are visiting
your site — displays on the main page, though you may need to scroll
past the Getting Started box to see it. 
 Site Status module: Your site status (including information like the
amount of bandwidth or disk space you are using) is shown in the
bottom box on the page. You can also find service announcements. 
 Manage tab: The Manage tab takes you to the main area for managing
your files and other resources. 
 Promote tab: The Promote tab displays a list of optional promotional
services that are designed to drive Web traffic to your site. 
The modules in the Web Hosting Control Panel are collapsible and expand-
able. For example, if you no longer need to view the Getting Started module,
click the down arrow beside the Getting Started text to collapse the whole
box. This technique enables you to see the Site Activity module without
needing to scroll down on the page. (See Figure 14-3.) You can click the 
arrow again to expand the module to its original size. Yahoo! saves the state
of your panels for future visits. 
Figure 14-2:

253
Chapter 14: Becoming a Webmaster: Administering Your Site Online

In addition, to get rid of the Getting Started module permanently, click the
Delete Module button inside of the module area. 
You can return to this main page of the Control Panel anytime by clicking the
Home tab. 
Viewing Site Activity 
Perhaps the most fascinating feature of the Control Panel is the Site Activity
Statistics section. You can know exactly how many people are coming to your
site and when they are coming, as well as discrete pieces of information
about your visitors. 
The Site Activity module on the main page of the Control Panel (refer to
Figure 14-3) provides a summary view of recent page views at your site. (Page
views are the number of times visitors have looked at your Web pages.)
You can drill down and get more detailed information by clicking the Site
Statistics link in the Site Activity module. When you click this link, the Site
Statistics feature appears, as shown in Figure 14-4. 
Figure 14-3:
Customizing
the look of

Panel. 
254
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

The Site Statistics page displays a directory view of your Web pages. You can
use this interface to find a specific page you are interested in viewing infor-
mation for. 
To view the statistics for a given page, click the Stats link to the right of the
filename. To view your home page statistics, for example, you want to view
the details for the index.html page. The Summary Report page displays for
the requested page, as shown in Figure 14-5. 
For each given page, you can click the links in the Page Reports box and get
more detailed reports, including
 Page views: Explore the total page views and unique page views (dupli-
cate sessions by a visitor aren’t counted) in hourly, daily, weekly, and
monthly views. 
 Visitor profile: Discover the kind of software and other equipment your
visitors are using to view your site. You can view the type of browser,
operating system, screen resolution, color depth, and support for
JavaScript and Java.

255
Chapter 14: Becoming a Webmaster: Administering Your Site Online

This information is extremely helpful to help you make certain design
decisions. For example, if you know that 95 percent of your visitors view
your site with an 1024 x 768 monitor, then you can feel comfortable that
you can make your page size up to 1024 pixels in width and it’s still view-
able by the vast majority of your visitors without needing to scroll. 
Alternatively, if for some crazy reason your Web site attracts a majority
of visitors who are using computers from the Stone Age and who have
monitors that view just 256 colors, then you want to redesign your site
with that information in mind, rather than assume that everyone is view-
ing your site with the photo-realism you expected. 
 Referrer: The Referrer Report displays how your visitors come to your
site — from a search engine, from another Web page, or by a user typing
in your Web address directly into the browser. 
The Referrer Report is an excellent way to determine if people are dis-
covering your site from search engines or ads or links you placed on
other Web sites. 
If you set your Web site’s home page as the home page for your browser, your
visits will be counted in the Yahoo! Site Statistics. 
Figure 14-5:
Activities of
a page. 
256
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

Checking Your Site’s Status
I recommend keeping an eye on the Site Status module on the main page of
the Control Panel from time to time, just to make sure your Web site is within
the disk space and data transfer allowance that Yahoo! allows on a monthly
basis. 
 Disk Space Usage is the amount of storage capacity that your Web site
takes up on the Web server. If your Web site contains just Web pages and
normal-size images, the total amount of space probably is fairly small.
The size grows rapidly, however, if you’re putting up multimedia or
other application files for people to download. 
 The Data Transfer Usage is the total amount of bandwidth, or informa-
tion downloaded from your Web site by visitors. If you have a normal
amount of visitors viewing a normal Web site (one that doesn’t have 
lots of really large files people are downloading), then this statistic is 
a nonissue. However, if you have a huge amount of traffic or large files
that many people are downloading, then this usage figure can climb. 
If you exceed your limit, you may want to purchase more disk space or band-
width from Yahoo!. 
Working with the File Manager 
If you know your way around Microsoft Windows at all, you probably are
used to working with Windows Explorer or the My Computer window. These
are views of the files on your hard drive organized into various folders, such
as Program Files or My Documents. 
In the Control Panel, your Web site is similarly arranged into folder views and
is displayed in the File Manager. 
Follow these steps to access the File Manager: 
1. From any Web Hosting Control Panel page, click the Manage button in
the top tab bar. 
2. Click the File Manager link inside of the Tools for Managing Your Site
module. 
The File Manager page displays, as shown in Figure 14-6. 
257
Chapter 14: Becoming a Webmaster: Administering Your Site Online

Alternatively, you can save a step and go directly to the File Manager by
choosing File Manager from the Quick Links box in the top-right corner of
the Web page. 
One of the advantages to using SiteBuilder is that it takes care of the behind-
the-scenes stuff for you. You don’t have to get your hands dirty worrying
about the names of your Web page files, copying your files to the server using
FTP, or creating subdirectories to place your files. Therefore, you may never
need to even visit the File Manager section of the Control Panel, because you
can handle much of this functionality inside SiteBuilder. Having said that, you
need to know how to perform a couple of tasks using the File Manager,
including uploading a file and deleting a file. 
Uploading a file 
Normally, you’ll upload files associated with your Web site inside of
SiteBuilder itself (see Chapter 6). However, if you have a need to manually
copy the file to your Web site online, you can do that as well. 
Figure 14-6:

258
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

Follow these steps to upload a file: 
1. From the File Manager page, click the Upload Files link. 
The Easy Upload page appears, as shown in Figure 14-7. 
You can also use the Quick Links drop-down box and go directly to the
Easy Upload page. 
2. On the Easy Upload page, click the Browse button beside the top file-
name box and select the file to upload. 
As the site warns, make sure you don’t have spaces in the filenames
(such as Rich Favorite Document.doc). Rename your file if neces-
sary (Richfav.doc). 
3. If you have more than one file to upload, continue adding your files
using the boxes. 
4. Click the Upload Files button. 
Your files upload to the root folder on your Web site located on the
Yahoo! Web server.

that is. 
259
Chapter 14: Becoming a Webmaster: Administering Your Site Online

Deleting a file
You may need to manually delete a file from your Web site on a couple of
common occasions: 
 Suppose you delete a page from your Web site inside of SiteBuilder. 
It’s removed from within the Site Contents pane of SiteBuilder, and you
never see it again. But the HTML file that was published to your Web 
site stays there, forever orphaned. Now, a file or two won’t hurt any-
thing, but once you start getting a bunch of orphaned files, then you’re
needlessly taking up space on your Web site. 
 Suppose you upload one or more MP3 files, multimedia videos,
PowerPoint presentations, or other large files on your Web site. After
you no longer need them, deleting them is a good idea to make sure 
you don’t fill your Web site storage with large, unused files. 
When you need to delete a file, follow these instructions:
1. From the File Manager page, click the check box beside the file or
files you want to delete. 
If the file you want to get rid of is in a folder, then click the folder to view it. 
Figure 14-8 shows the check box checked beside a Word document that
is no longer needed on the Web site. 
Figure 14-8:

site.

Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

2. Click the Delete Files button to confirm that you want to get rid of the
file(s) 
The Delete Files confirmation page displays, as shown in Figure 14-9. 
You’re taken to the File Manager, with a message indicating that the files
were deleted. 
Have a Snafu? Recover an Earlier 
Version of Your Web Site
I promise it’s gonna happen at some point or another. Everything is going
along fine with your Web site, and then you mess it up. Perhaps you get a
great idea on how to reorganize the site or are inspired to redo the home
page. Or maybe you simply make a mistake and type the wrong prices on
your sale page. But a day later, you visit your site and realize that your reor-
ganization is confusing, your home page design looks awful, or your sale
prices are all marked down to $.05. What’s a person to do? Your first step 
Figure 14-9:
Confirming
that you are
serious
about this

deed. 
261
Chapter 14: Becoming a Webmaster: Administering Your Site Online

is usually simply restoring one or more files to the way they were before you
made changes. When (notice I say when, not if ) this happens, you have two
options: 
 Keep backup versions of your SiteBuilder sites on your hard drive so
you can simply open up a backed-up site and then republish it. 
 Use the Snapshot Backups feature in the Control Panel. 
To restore a Web site using the Snapshot Backup
1. From any Web Hosting Control Panel page, click the Manage tab. 
2. Click the Snapshot Backups link inside of the Tools for Managing Your
Site module. 
The Snapshot Backups page displays, as shown in Figure 14-10. 
3. Click the snapshot you want to retrieve. 
The view for that particular snapshot appears, as shown in Figure 14-11. 
You can restore one or more files within a given folder. 
Figure 14-10:
Restoring
your Web
site. 
262
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

4. Click the Restore link beside each file. 
Each page you choose is restored from this snapshot. 
Keep in mind that the version you are reverting to is on the published
Web site only. When you reopen the site inside of SiteBuilder, your
recent changes are still there. If you wish to use the snapshot copy
inside of SiteBuilder, then import the Web site (see Chapter 4 for details
on importing) and use this version as your new working Web site.

A
s the other chapters in this book have explored, your Web site can revo-
lutionize the way in which you communicate and interact with people.
If you own a business, you can use your Web site to better serve your existing
customers or reach new ones. If you have a nonprofit organization, you can
better communicate your mission and programs to potential sponsors and
donors. Or, if you have a family or hobby site, you can correspond with friends,
relatives, or fellow enthusiasts. 
However, if you have a business that sells products, you may wish to go to
the next step beyond mere communication and actually transact business
from your Web site. If you decide to take this next step, SiteBuilder can lead
you through the often confusing world of e-commerce. 
In this chapter, you explore how you can enable your SiteBuilder Web site to
sell products on it. You explore the simplest way — through PayPal buttons —
as well as the more involved Online-Store-and-Shopping-Cart route using
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions. 
You can use the PayPal buttons with any Yahoo! Web hosting plan. However, in
order to use the online store and Catalog Manager, you need to upgrade your
hosting plan to a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions plan. 

Working with PayPal Buttons
The easiest way into the world of e-commerce is through PayPal. PayPal is
an online payment service that acts as a middleman between the purchaser
and seller of a product. PayPal is a popular option for online transactions on
Web sites such as eBay where the seller doesn’t have the need for a full-scale
e-commerce solution. PayPal charges a small fee to the seller for each trans-
action made using its service. 
For complete details on paying fees, receiving payments, and establishing an
account, go to www.paypal.com. (Note that PayPal is neither owned by nor
affiliated with Yahoo!.) 
SiteBuilder provides support for PayPal through Buy Now and Donations 
buttons: 
 Buy Now: Visitors can purchase an individual item using PayPal. 
 Donations: Visitors can send donations to your nonprofit organization,
charity, church, or fundraising campaign using PayPal. 
When a visitor clicks a Buy Now or Donations button, he or she goes to a secure
PayPal Web site to enter order information and complete the transaction.
After PayPal processes the order or donation, the visitor is sent to a confir-
mation page you specify. Or, if the visitor cancels out before completing the
transaction, then he or she is sent to a cancellation page supplied by PayPal
or yourself. 
Keep in mind the following capabilities of the PayPal buttons: 
 Each Buy Now button is linked to a specific product, and each Donations
button is associated with a specific fundraising campaign. Therefore, if
you have five different types of chili you wish to sell on your Web site,
you would need five different Buy Now buttons, each linked to a particu-
lar item. In the same way, if you operated a Web site for a world hunger
program and allowed visitors to choose between giving for an African
famine campaign or Asian Tsunami relief campaign, you would need two
different Donations buttons. 
 While each button is linked to a single item or campaign, you can have
multiple buttons on your Web site that point to the same product or
campaign.
 For Buy Now e-commerce, there is no PayPal “shopping cart” per se,
in which you gather various products into a single order. But you can
optionally allow customers to purchase more than one of the same prod-
uct in a single order. 
266
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

Adding a PayPal Buy Now button 
You can add a PayPal Buy Now button by following these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪PayPal Buttons➪Buy Now from the main menu. 
The Buy Now Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-1. 
2. Enter the e-mail address that is associated with your PayPal account
in the Email Address text box. 
3. Enter the product name in the Item Name text box. 
PayPal uses this information in the transaction details of the purchase. 
4. If your products have a unique ID associated with them, enter this
value into the Item ID text box. 
5. Enter the price for the product in the Amount text box and specify the
unit of currency in the adjoining drop-down menu. 
6. Enter the shipping charge per item in the Shipping text box. 
This per item cost is added to the order for each item purchased. If cus-
tomers can purchase more than one of this item in a single order, this
cost is charged for each item. 
7. Enter the handling charges for the order in the Handling text box. 
This cost is added to the order. Unlike the shipping charges, which are
per item, this handling charge is a flat rate regardless of the number of
items in the order. 
8. Click the Browse button beside the Button text box and select the
desired button image from the Choose an Image dialog box. 
Figure 15-1:
The Buy
Now
Properties
dialog box.
267
Chapter 15: From Rags to Riches: Selling Products on Your Site

9. Click the Advanced tab to continue. 
The Buy Now Properties dialog box updates, as shown in Figure 15-2. 
10. Specify the page you would like the customer to go to after a purchase:
Default (a page created and provided by PayPal showing transaction
details), A Page in My Site, or Another Web Site. 
The default PayPal page provides details of the transactions but doesn’t
have the look and feel of your Web site. In contrast, if you specify your
own confirmation page, you need to provide a generic “we’re processing
your order” message. You can’t provide specific details about the current
order in your Web page. 
11. Specify the page you would like the customer to go to if he or she 
cancels out from the ordering process: Default (a page created and
provided by PayPal), A Page in My Site, or Another Web Site. 
12. If you’d optionally like a Note field to be provided on the PayPal
order form, choose Accept Note from the Accept Note from Buyer
drop-down menu. 
The Note field could be a place in which customers provide special
requests. 
13. If you chose the Accept Note option, enter the title of the note in the
Title of Note text box. 
Make sure this text fully explains the Note field to the customer. 
14. If you have a product logo or picture that you want to display on the
PayPal payment page, enter the image name in the Logo Image text box. 
Click the Browse button to select an image from your local computer or
from SiteBuilder clip art. 
Figure 15-2:

268
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

The image must be 150 pixels wide and 50 pixels in height or smaller. 
If you plan on using a logo image, make sure you place it inside an SSL-
protected folder in your Web site. See the “Adding your logo image to
an SSL-protected folder” sidebar for details. 
15. Set the Shipping Address field to one of the following values: Prompt
for Address, Don’t Prompt for Address, or Requires Address. 
If have a physical product you ship, make sure the shipping address is
required. 
If you have a digital product that is for downloads only, choose Don’t
Prompt for Address. 
16. If you want the customer to be able to order multiple copies of the
same item within a single order, select the Allow Multiple Purchase
from the Purchase Multiple drop-down menu (the default). 
17. Click OK. 
The Buy Now button is added to your Web page. Reposition the button
to the appropriate position. 
269
Chapter 15: From Rags to Riches: Selling Products on Your Site
Adding your logo image to an SSL-protected folder
If you use a logo image, you need to add a spe-
cial Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)-protected folder
to your Web site and then place your image file
inside it. If you don’t, customers or donors receive
a message indicating that some parts of the
PayPal payment page are not secure, a warn-
ing that can frighten some customers from com-
pleting the process. To provide a secure PayPal
logo, do the following steps: 
1. Specify your logo image in the Buy Now
Properties or Donations Properties dialog
box. (See the “Adding a PayPal Buy Now
button” and “Adding a PayPal Donations
button” sections in this chapter.) 
The image is automatically added to the
images folder of your Web site. 
2. In the Site Contents pane, right-click the
root node and choose Create New Folder
from the contextual menu. 
A new folder is added to your Web site. 
3. Name the folder ssl. (Make sure you use all
lowercase characters.) 
4. Expand the images folder and select your
logo image. 
5. Drag the logo to the ssl folder. 
Yahoo! treats the ssl folder as an SSL-
protected folder. 

Adding a PayPal Donations button
You can add a PayPal Donations button to your Web page to help your char-
ity or nonprofit organization in fundraising. To do so, follow these steps. 
1. Choose Insert➪PayPal Buttons➪Donations from the main menu. 
The Donations Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-3. 
2. Enter the e-mail address that is associated with your PayPal account
in the Email Address text box. 
3. Enter a description of the campaign or organization in the Description
text box. 
PayPal uses this information in the transaction details of the donation. 
4. Click the Browse button beside the Button text box and select the
desired button image from the Choose an Image dialog box. 
5. Click the Advanced tab to continue. 
The Donations Properties dialog box updates, as shown in Figure 15-4. 
6. Specify the page you would like the donor to go to after a donation:
Default (a page created and provided by PayPal showing transaction
details), A Page in My Site, or Another Web Site.

Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

As with the Buy Now process, the default PayPal page provides details
of the transactions but doesn’t have the look and feel of your Web site.
In contrast, if you specify your own confirmation page, you need to 
provide a generic “Thanks for the donation. We’re processing it now.”
message. You can’t provide specific details about the current donation
in your Web page. 
7. Specify the page you would like the donor to go to if he or she cancels
the donation process: Default (a page created and provided by PayPal),
A Page in My Site, or Another Web Site. 
8. If you have an organization or campaign logo that you want to display
on the PayPal payment page, enter the image name in the Logo Image
text box. 
Click the Browse button to select an image from a local computer or
from SiteBuilder clip art. 
The image must be 150 pixels wide and 50 pixels in height or smaller. 
If you plan on using a logo image, make sure you place it inside an SSL-
protected folder in your Web site. See the “Adding your logo image to an
SSL-protected folder” sidebar for details. 
9. Click OK. 
The Donations button is added to your Web page. Move the button to
the desired location. 
Building an Online Store with 
Yahoo! Merchant Solutions 
If you have a Yahoo! Merchant Solutions hosting plan, you can create a full-
scale online store, complete with shopping cart and credit card transactions.
Who knows, maybe you’ll have eBay and Amazon squirming in their shoes in
no time! 
The process of creating an online store is relatively straightforward when you
use SiteBuilder in combination with the Yahoo! Merchant Solutions Catalog
Manager. Here are the nine steps: 
1. Add a new field to the online product catalog for handling your
SiteBuilder store. 
2. Enter product information in the Catalog Manager, part of the online
Yahoo! Store Manager. 
271
Chapter 15: From Rags to Riches: Selling Products on Your Site

3. Publish your catalog. 
4. Enable your product catalog to be accessible by SiteBuilder. 
5. Import your catalog into SiteBuilder. 
6. Add a store page to your Web site. 
7. Add a View Cart button to your page. 
8. Complete the final steps online.
9. Publish your site and go live. 
You must be enrolled in the Yahoo! Merchant Solutions plan if you want to
create an online store. If you have a normal Web Hosting plan, you can’t uti-
lize the services. However, if you want to upgrade to a Merchant Solutions
account, go to smallbusiness.yahoo.com/services and click the Change
or Cancel Plan link. 
Adding a new field to the product catalog 
In order to use SiteBuilder with your online product catalog, you first need
to add a new field called Product-url to the catalog. The Product-url links
a Web page on your site to the product record in your Catalog Manager.
(It’s also used in the shopping cart after the product has been added.)
In addition, if you plan to list your products on Yahoo! Shopping, you must
have this field for integration into it. You can add this field by following these
steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the main menu. 
You may be asked for your Yahoo! ID if you’ve not established a Yahoo!
session yet. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and displays the Yahoo!
Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. Click the Store link in the top-right-hand corner of the Web page. 
You’re taken to your online Store Manager (see Figure 15-5), the home
base for all things e-commerce. 
3. Click the Catalog Manager link in the Edit section. 
The main Catalog Manager page displays, as shown in Figure 15-6. 
4. Click the Manage Your Tables link.
The Tables page displays (see Figure 15-7).

5. Click the default-table link. 
The Edit Table page displays (see Figure 15-8). 
6. Click the Edit button in the Shopping Fields section. 
You may need to scroll down the page to find this section. 
The Edit Table — Shopping Fields page now displays. 
7. From the Select Field drop-down menu, select Product-url from the list
and click Add Field. 
The Product-url is added to the Shopping Fields list, as shown in
Figure 15-9. 
8. Enter your domain name in the Default Value box. 
This step makes your data entry process easier, especially if you have
many products to enter in your catalog. The text you enter here is auto-
matically entered in the Product-url field when you enter a new item in
the Catalog Manager. 
9. Click Update. 
You return to the Edit Table — default-table page. 
10. Click the Save button to make your changes permanent. 
Yahoo! returns you to the main Tables page (refer to Figure 15-7).

Adding products to your product catalog 
Your next step in preparing your product catalog is to enter your product
information into the online Catalog Manager. You can do so by following
these steps: 
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the main menu. 
You may be asked for your Yahoo! ID if you’ve not established a Yahoo!
session yet. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and displays the Yahoo!
Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. Click the Store link in the top-right-hand corner of the Web page. 
You’re taken to your online Store Manager (refer to Figure 15-5). 
3. Click the Catalog Manager link in the Edit section. 
The main Catalog Manager page displays (refer to Figure 15-6). 
Yahoo! provides you with a default table for entering basic product infor-
mation. I focus on using this table. If your needs are more advanced, click
the Manage Your Tables link and modify the fields of the default table or
else create your own new table. 
4. Click the Manage Your Items link.
The Items page displays (see Figure 15-10). 
5. Enter a new product entry into the table by clicking the Add Item
button.
The Add Item page displays, as shown in Figure 15-11. 
6. Populate all the fields you need for this record. 
The default-table contains a set of fields that captures information about
your individual product. Yahoo! requires some of these fields to be filled
out for its usage (these fields are marked with an asterisk beside them),
but others are optional and need only be used if you plan on displaying
this information on your Web page. 
Although you may have many of these fields that you wish to include as
part of your product listings, the basic fields you will almost always want
to display on your SiteBuilder Web page include Name, Price, Image, and
Caption. 
Upload a product image by clicking the Upload button beside the Image
field. Yahoo! prompts you for an image file located on your local com-
puter. After you send the image and upload it to the Yahoo! server, you
can use it as part of your product listing.

Chapter 15: From Rags to Riches: Selling Products on Your Site

If you have questions about the purpose of a field, click the blue ques-
tion mark button beside it to display Help. 
For each product entry, enter a value in the Product-url field. (You may
need to scroll down the page to see this field.) You’ll want to use your
domain name and a page name for the product. 
If you display all of your products on the same page, such as products.
html, then you can use the same Product-url value for each entry in your
table. 
If you use a separate Web page for each product you sell, I recommend
incorporating the product ID in its filename. For example, suppose I
have a domain named www.mmlean.com and have a sweater that I am
going to sell with an ID of D3003. I’d enter the following value into the
Product-url field: 
www.mmlean.com/D3003.html
If you have several products, you may wish to place all your product
pages in a separate products subfolder. See Chapter 4 for more on 
creating subfolders on your Web site. 
7. Click the Save and Add Another button to save the current record and
fill out the next.
8. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 for each product in your catalog. When you have
entered the last product entry, click the Save button. 
Figure 15-12 shows a product catalog table.

The Publishing page displays. 
5. Click the Publish Catalog button to make your changes take effect. 
Enabling your product catalog 
for use with SiteBuilder 
While your product catalog is available from your Yahoo! Catalog Manager,
you need to enable it so that SiteBuilder can retrieve this information and
use it inside your Web site. You can do so by performing the following steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel from the main menu. 
You may be asked for your Yahoo! ID if you’ve not established a Yahoo!
session yet. 
SiteBuilder opens your default Web browser and displays the Yahoo!
Web Hosting Control Panel. 
2. Click the Store link in the top-right-hand corner of the Web page. 
You are taken to your online Store Manager (refer to Figure 15-5). 
3. Click the Search Engines link in the Promote section. 
You may need to scroll down to see this link.
The Promote Your Site on Search Engines page displays, as shown in
Figure 15-13.

10. In the Advanced Settings section, adjust the amount of horizontal and
vertical spacing between product listings. 
11. Click the Next button. 
The Products pane displays; see Figure 15-19. 
12. For each entry in the Products grid, select the products you want
to include from the cell’s drop-down menu and place them in the
desired order. 
The cell’s drop-down menu is populated with the product items from
your store catalog. 
13. Click the Finish button. 
SiteBuilder creates a new products page for you (see Figure 15-20) and
displays the products from your catalog. 
Each product is contained in a product module, a SiteBuilder page element
that is used for housing your store data. Each module contains store tags,
which you can move around and tweak. A store tag is a placeholder for a
field from your product catalog, such as description, price, and image.

14. Click the Save button. 
The Save As dialog box displays. 
15. Save the file as products.html or another filename. 
Adding a Shopping Cart button
After you create your Store Products page and add product modules to the
page, your final step is to add a Shopping Cart button to your page. A Shopping
Cart button enables visitors to view the products that they’ve added to their
Shopping Cart when they click the order button for a product. 
The shopping cart displays in a page managed and created by Yahoo! and is
not one that you specify as a page in your SiteBuilder Web site. To adjust the
look and feel of your e-commerce shopping cart, visit the Store Editor, which
is available from the Store Manager (refer to Figure 15-5).

To add a shopping cart button to your page, perform the following steps: 
1. Click the Insert Store Tags button from the toolbar. 
The button displays a drop-down menu. 
2. Choose View Cart from the drop-down menu. 
The View Cart Properties dialog box is shown (see Figure 15-21). 
3. If you wish to change the default shopping cart button, click the
Browse button and navigate to the desired button. 
4. Click OK in the View Cart Properties dialog box. 
The shopping cart button is added to your products page. 
5. Reposition the button to the desired location for visitors. 
Completing the final merchant 
requirements 
Before your store is ready to accept orders from customers, you need to set
up a merchant account with a bank (which enables you to perform credit
card transitions from your Web site) and complete an Open for Business
order form. See help.yahoo.com/help/us/store/store-08.html#step6
for full walkthrough details.

Publishing your site
After you complete all the necessary requirements established by Yahoo!,
you’re finally ready to open your Web site for business. At that time, you
can publish your Web site, adding your online store pages during the update.
See Chapter 4 for full details on how to publish your Web site. 
Additional Store Catalog Tasks
After you have your store up and running, you can perform several additional
store catalog tasks, such as adding another product, deleting a product, and
refreshing your catalog. I discuss how to do such maintenance chores in this
section. 
Adding a product module
A product module is the page element you add to your Web page that contains
your store’s product items. In addition to using the Store Products Wizard
(see the “Creating a store page” section, earlier in the chapter), you can add
individual product modules to your Web page by performing the following
steps:
1. Click the Insert Store Tags button from the toolbar. 
The button displays a drop-down menu. 
2. Choose Product Module from the drop-down menu. 
The Insert Store Product dialog box appears (see Figure 15-22). 
Figure 15-22:
Inserting
a product
module into

286
Part IV: Managing Your Web Site 

3. Click the Refresh button if you’ve made changes to the catalog. 
SiteBuilder downloads the latest version of the catalog available on the
Yahoo! server. 
4. Select the product you want to add from the Product section.
5. Choose the desired layout design from the Product Layout section. 
6. Check the fields that you want to include in the module from the list
of available fields shown in the Product Fields section. 
7. Click OK. 
The new product module is added to your Web page. 
Adding store tags 
Store tags are placeholders that you add to a product module to display data
from your product catalog. You can add individual store tags to product mod-
ules by following these steps:
1. Click the product module to which you’d like to add a store tag. 
2. Click the Insert Store Tags button from the toolbar. 
The button displays a drop-down menu. 
3. Choose the desired store tag from the menu. 
The store tag is added to the selected product module. 
4. Reposition the store tag to the desired location. 
Viewing product module properties
You may have instances where you’d like to switch which product from your
catalog that a product module is pointing to, such as in the case of reorganiz-
ing your products into a different order. You make this switch through its
Properties dialog box. 
Like all other page elements in SiteBuilder, you can right-click a product
module to display its contextual menu. Choose Properties, and the Product
dialog box displays (see Figure 15-23). 
If you’d like to switch the product to which the module points to, select
another product from the Product pane. 
287
Chapter 15: From Rags to Riches: Selling Products on Your Site

Refreshing your catalog information
The product catalog that is imported as part of your SiteBuilder Web site on
your local computer is a “point in time” image of your catalog. Therefore, when
you make changes to the online catalog, you need to refresh your products
catalog inside SiteBuilder to ensure your Web site is up to date. You can do
so by performing the following steps: 
1. Choose Tools➪Store Catalog➪Refresh from the main menu. 
The Import Store Catalog dialog box (refer to Figure 15-14) displays. 
2. Click OK to perform the update. 
SiteBuilder retrieves a fresh version of the product catalog from the Yahoo!
server and copies it to your local computer. Your pages update to reflect
any changes. 
Deleting your catalog 
If you would like to remove your product catalog from your Web site, you can
do so by following these steps:
1. Choose Tools➪Store Catalog➪Delete from the main menu. 
A Warning message box displays, asking whether you really want to
delete your catalog. 
2. Click Yes to delete the catalog. 
Your product modules and store tags no longer work.

I
n the world of “bricks and mortar,” the only way a small business can put
up a storefront that rivals the “Big Boys” is to sink millions of dollars into
the effort. Okay, I suppose technically you could also move in on a holiday 
to the headquarters of a major corporation, place your own company logo 
on top of theirs, and become a squatter. However, I wouldn’t recommend 
that option. 
Yet as Chapter 3 details, the Web is the great equalizer. No squatting is even
needed! You can run a business out of your basement and create an economi-
cal, do-it-yourself Web site that, for all intents and purposes, is as attractive
and effective as a Fortune 500 company’s Web site. 
If your goal for your Web site is to look as professional and impressive as the
large companies, consider the following ten tips. 

Don’t Reinvent the Wheel 
When you are looking to design your Web site, make sure you have a list of
trend-setting corporate Web sites that you can turn to for ideas. For example,
suppose you’re trying to determine the best font to use for your navigation
bar. Check out what Honda, IBM, or Microsoft are using (and what they’re not
using) on their sites. You can bet they’ve probably spent a lot of bucks
researching that very issue. 
Don’t get me wrong: I am not recommending that you steal ideas from another
Web site and directly duplicate them on your site. In fact, I’ve seen others that
provide mirror replicas of Amazon, Microsoft, or Apple. Instead of looking
impressive, these sites look just like a bunch of copycats!
Without stealing, you can get many ideas from the “Big Boys:” 
 Look at how “crisp and clean” their Web sites are. 
 Notice the unity and amount of colors that they use. 
 Notice how often white is used as a background color. This color choice
is not by accident: White generally looks crisper and more professional.
In fact, very few commercial-quality Web sites use dark background
colors, and none uses “loud” or distracting background graphics. 
Finally, check out a variety of larger sites — car makers, computer and soft-
ware makers, media outlets, e-commerce centers, trendy design Web sites,
and companies related to your business. These can give you a variety of 
perspectives and ideas of how to construct your Web site. 
Eliminate Counters, Clichés, 
and All Things Cute
Because I can. That’s the response I get when I ask most people why they
added a cute little gadget, such as a counter or stock ticker, to a Web site.
With SiteBuilder, you can easily add a lot of neat stuff to your Web pages, 
but that doesn’t mean you always should
Visit, for example, the Web sites of Toyota, CNN, or Macromedia. They may
have a Flash or ActiveX multimedia controls, but probably only one, and the
actual size is quite small. But you won’t see much else “cute” on their sites.
292
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Before adding something to your Web page, always ask yourself: Would I see
this on one of the “Big Boys” Web sites? If so, consider it. If not, you better
have a much better reason to add it than “because I can.”
With that in mind
 Most animated GIFs and scrolling messages look cheesy. Avoid them
unless they’re really professional looking. 
 Avoid those cute construction signs if part of your site is not completed.
Instead, add some descriptive text. 
 I know, SiteBuilder enables you to easily add these, but for your business
site, avoid page fade-in or fade-out effects anyway. There’s absolutely no
reason for it other than “because you can.” In fact, if you can find a “Big
Boy” site that uses fade-in effects, I’ll treat you to a Tuscan holiday. 
 Avoid using a visible page counter. The number of visitors should be like
a James Bond case: For Your Eyes Only. Do you, for example, really want
to tell the world that you’ve only had 50 people come to your site since
last year? Instead, if you really want to capture this info, do so with a
behind-the-scenes solution, which I discuss in Chapter 15.
 Not a gadget, but it is a cliché: Don’t say anywhere on your site “Web
site of,” “Home of,” “Online home of,” or any derivation thereof. A visitor
already knows it’s your Web site. What else could it be? 
 Using Flash or Java is normal, but beware of using nonstandard plug-ins.
Unless it is a plug-in, such as Flash, that 99.9 percent of your visitors
probably already have, you almost never want a visitor to be forced to
download a plug-in to view content on your Web site. 
Don’t Let Your Site Grow Mold
You don’t have to act like a CNN.com or Amazon.com and update your site
hourly or daily, but you should regularly provide new information on your
site to keep visitors coming back. For example: 
 Consider having a What’s New or Latest News box or page so that
people can check out any new stuff you may have added. 
 Make sure your Web site doesn’t date itself: 
• Don’t keep up old news. For example, if you’re announcing a
Christmas sale, don’t keep that information up there through 
St. Valentine’s Day in February. 
293
Chapter 16: Ten Design Tips to Rival the “Big Boys”

• Check your copyright date. If you have a copyright notice in the
footer of your Web pages, make sure it is updated to the current
year. Nothing looks more dated than a Web site with copyright
notices from two years ago. 
• Only have a Last Updated date on your Web site if you update the
site at least once a month. Otherwise, let visitors think you may
have actually updated it, rather than knowing that you’ve not
touched the thing in six months. 
 Consider revising your overall site design at least once a year to keep
things looking fresh. 
Hobbit-Size Your Pages 
The “Big Boys” are fanatics on keeping the size of each page to a bare mini-
mum, particularly the home page. You need to be, too. With that in mind
 No matter how much it hurts, keep your home page at around 50K in
total size. On a sublevel page, you have slightly more leniency, but you
should aim for 80K or less on nearly every page. 
 Pictures are critical to a well-designed site, but avoid using too many. 
 If you are using JPG files, see how much you can squeeze out of the com-
pression before the quality of the image degrades too much. (See
Chapter 7 for more details.) 
I have a site that I like to frequent occasionally that has a navigation bar built
using Flash. Bless their hearts, but the silly thing takes so long to load for
each page that I’ve only seen it load fully on one occasion. All other times, 
I go to the site, check out the info I need, only to leave before the Flash pre-
sentation loads. 
Hey, They’re Free: Test 
with Multiple Browsers
While today’s generation of browsers are mature and show 95 percent of Web
pages identically, the browsers have differences that you simply have to be
aware of and test for. Therefore, make sure that your Web site has an identi-
cal look and functionality on all the major browsers, including
294
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Microsoft Internet Explorer: If you use Windows, having Internet Explorer
is a given. Even if you use another browser, you’ll have this one on your
system for testing. 
 Mozilla Firefox: Firefox is an up-and-coming browser that is gaining a lot
of interest and a growing community of enthusiastic users. Make sure
your site works well with it. Visit www.mozilla.org to download. 
 Netscape: Also built with the Mozilla browser engine like Firefox,
Netscape still maintains a Web browser that you should test with. 
Go to www.netscape.com for a free download.
 Opera: The Opera browser has a very small market share, but it is a
good idea to test with it. Visit www.opera.com for a free download. 
Don’t Forget About the Text
I’ve been talking all along about the look and design of your Web site, but
don’t forget another key component of your overall presentation: the text!
Many people spend all their time and energy on their Web site design and
end up throwing up text that wouldn’t pass a tenth-grade writing assignment.
Keep in mind the following tips: 
 Separate text writing from your Web design process. Consider writing
the text in your word processor first and then copying and pasting the
text into your SiteBuilder page. When you write text inside of SiteBuilder,
you can easily become distracted with how the text is going to look on
your page rather than the text itself. 
 Check your spelling and grammar. The “Big Boys” do. 
 Communicate in a friendly but professional tone. Don’t chit-chat. Save
your “personal touch” for the phone or in person. 
See also Chapter 3 for more on writing content for your Web site. 
Take the Ten-Second Test-Drive 
When you’re designing a Web site to which you want to attract more and
more visitors, do your best to check it out as a first-time visitor would. Within
5 to 10 seconds, the home page should communicate the gist of what your
company or organization does, what kind of products you’re selling, or per-
haps the hobby you’re showing off. If not, your visitor may get itchy and go
295
Chapter 16: Ten Design Tips to Rival the “Big Boys”

on. Above all, never force the user to click to another page to understand
who you are or what you’re trying to communicate. 
If you are selling a product or service, having a catchy slogan or a picture
that communicates through metaphor is fine. But somewhere on your home
page, plainly state what you are or what you do. 
Your goal: Make your message brain-dead easy. 
Design for Technology Laggards, but
Leave Behind the Stone Age
If you have a brand-new computer and broadband Internet connection, it is
easy to assume that everyone else in the world can view your Web site using
the same technology as you do. Big mistake. Many of your visitors will lag
behind in technology; this reality must impact how you design your Web site.
This is particularly important in three areas: 
 Screen resolution: Design for 800 x 600 screen resolution, though most
people by now are at 1024 x 768. 
 Browser version: Design for Internet Explorer 5.0 and higher and
Netscape 6.0 and higher.
 Internet connection speed: Design for the dialup user. 
At the same time, don’t feel obligated to account for the 5 percent of people
who are still in the Stone Age, using really old equipment or software. If some-
one is using Netscape Navigator 2.0, every site on the Web will give him fits. 
Publishing Your Text as an Image
If you have access to graphics software, such as Adobe Photoshop or Paint
Shop Pro, use it for some of your text. Most graphics software worthy of the
name enables you to anti-alias your text, which gives it a much crisper and
cleaner look than simply adding normal text. Anti-aliased text works great for
headings and other title text, and can definitely get your site looking more
like the “Big Boys.” 
296
Part V: The Part of Tens 

However, don’t go hog wild and convert all your text to graphics. Not only
does that make your Web pages much bigger, but it also ends up looking like
“brochureware” rather than a lively Web site. 
Never, Ever, Ever, Ever Assume 
You probably remember that silly little saying about what “assume” means?
Well, keep that in mind as you design your site to rival the “Big Boys:” 
 Never assume all your visitors are on high speed. Many will not be and
won’t think your super-size Flash control or Java applet is fun to down-
load, no matter how cool it is. 
 Don’t assume that your visitor has the latest browser or latest plug-in.
Many users stick with whatever was installed on their PC and the time of
purchase. 
 When you get a new 21-inch monitor for Christmas with 1280 x 1024
screen resolution, don’t assume all your visitors received the same gift.
Some will still try to come to your Web site with a puny 14-inch 800 x 600
monitor and expect to have the experience that you have.

Ten SiteBuilder Tips You 
Really Need to Know
In This Chapter
 Using SiteBuilder more productively 
 Making your Web building more enjoyable
I
love my dad, but the way that he uses his computer reminds me of 
someone who knows how to drive a car well but never bothered to take
the time to learn how to turn on the stereo or open the trunk. (Sorry, Dad!)
In other words, for the tasks he knows how to perform in Windows, he’s an
expert. But the moment he gets outside of that box, I get a phone call. In fact,
if the phone ever rings past 11 p.m. in my household, I’ll invariably answer,
“Hi, Dad. What’s happened?” 
For the first 16 chapters of this book, you’ve been focusing your attention
on “driving the car” — using SiteBuilder to build Web pages. However, in this
chapter, you back up a little and look at the car . . . errr . . . SiteBuilder itself.
As you do so, you explore ten tips about using SiteBuilder that can either
help as you build your site or simply make your “driving” experience more
productive and enjoyable. 
Using the Insert Palette 
The Insert palette, shown in Figure 17-1, is a handy tool for inserting any kind
of element into a Web page in SiteBuilder, from a basic text element to a Site
Search add-on to an iframe. If you can add it to your Web page, you can find it
in the Insert palette. 

To access the Insert palette, click the Insert Palette button on the toolbar. 
You never have to use the Insert palette, because all its functionality is available
by using the standard menu or toolbar commands. However, it’s particularly
useful if you are adding several elements to a page at once or are wanting to
simply look at what’s available to add to your Web site. 
The Insert palette is nonmodal, a techie term that simply means that you can
leave the dialog box open while you’re working with your Web page. Therefore,
you can move the Insert palette off to the side while you design your page yet
still have it available for you when you need to add new elements. Figure 17-2
shows how I use the Insert palette in this manner.

Insert
palette

design envi-
ronment.

one inserter.
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

To insert an element using the Insert palette, follow these steps: 
1. Click the Insert Palette button on the toolbar. 
The Insert palette displays (refer to Figure 17-1). The elements are
grouped by categories. 
2. Select the desired category on the left to display the elements within
that grouping. 
3. Double-click the element icon to insert it into the center of the active
Web page in the Design pane. 
Alternatively, if you want to position the element in a particular spot,
you can drag the element icon from the palette window and drop it on
a particular location on your page. When you release the mouse button,
the element is inserted. 
Avoiding the Pain When 
Working with Panes
As Chapter 1 discusses, SiteBuilder divides its working environment into sep-
arate panes: 
 A Design pane, for displaying the open pages you are working on
 Supporting panes, including the Help pane, Site Contents pane, Preview
pane, and Page Effects pane
While the supporting panes are useful, you probably don’t want to display all
of them at the same time; they can take up a lot of space you might like to
have for designing your Web page. Try the following techniques to get the
workspace the way you like it: 
 Collapse and expand a pane: Each supporting pane has a blue region
on its border, as shown in Figure 17-3. By clicking this region with your
mouse, you toggle the visibility of the pane: An expanded pane collapses,
while a collapsed pane expands. The arrow on the blue region indicates
whether the pane is expanded or collapsed. 
 Manually resize a pane: While the blue region on the border is for
expanding and collapsing a pane, you can resize it by dragging another
part of the border and then releasing the mouse. 
 Restore the panes to their default position: SiteBuilder saves the current
state of the panes when you close the application. Normally, the saved
state is helpful, because you can configure the environment exactly as
you want it and have it stay that way. However, if you ever want to return
the SiteBuilder environment to its original state, choose View➪Restore
Default View. 
301
Chapter 17: Ten SiteBuilder Tips You Really Need to Know

Automatically Saving Your Work
Bad things can happen when you’re working on your computer. A lightning
storm kills the power. A bratty nephew is obsessed with your computer’s
Reset button. A buggy music player freezes your whole Windows session
when you’re in the middle of designing your site. To help prevent losing
unsaved work when situations like these arise, I strongly recommend using
the Automatic Save feature of SiteBuilder. 
The Automatic Save feature is for emergency use only. SiteBuilder saves a
background copy of your files for use only when SiteBuilder closes down
unexpectedly. For normal use, you still need to save your files as you nor-
mally do. 
To automatically save your work, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from the main menu. 
2. Click the Automatic Save tab in the Preferences dialog box. 
The Automatic Save tab appears, as shown in Figure 17-4.

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 

3. Check the Enable Automatic Save box. 
This option is normally on by default, so you should simply need to con-
firm that the box is already checked. 
4. Enter the desired interval of time (in minutes) between autosaves you
want SiteBuilder to work with in the box provided. 
I recommend using 5 minutes or less. 
5. Click OK to save your preferences. 
Working with Multiple Pages Open
By default, as you work inside SiteBuilder, the open pages you have display
one at a time, with separate tabs shown in the Design pane for each open
page. However, you can work with the pages in a side-by-side manner if you
wish. To do so, click the Restore/Maximize button at the top right of the
SiteBuilder window (shown in Figure 17-5). 
After you enter the Restore mode, each page displays in its own window. You
can move and resize these windows as you want within the SiteBuilder envi-
ronment, as shown in Figure 17-6. 
The most useful aspect of side-by-side view is that you can move a page 
element from one page to another simply by dragging it from one page and
dropping it into another. This procedure is an alternative to the typical cut-
and-paste operation.

To return to the normal tabbed view, click the Restore/Maximize button on
any of the page windows. 
Automatically Restoring Your Session
While SiteBuilder automatically loads your last opened site when you launch
it, you can also have SiteBuilder reload the pages you had open during your
previous SiteBuilder session. To enable this option, follow these steps: 
1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from the main menu.
The Preferences dialog box appears with the General tab active, as
shown in Figure 17-7.
2. Check the Reload Open Pages on Startup box.
3. Click OK.
Managing Multiple Sites
If you’re working with more than one Yahoo! Web site and Yahoo! ID, you may
occasionally find you need to sign into Yahoo! and SiteBuilder with a different
Yahoo! ID. 
The typical scenario is when you have published or interacted recently with
the Yahoo! server with one Yahoo! ID and then go to open up another Web site
that is managed using another Yahoo! ID and want to publish it in the same
SiteBuilder session. 
Figure 17-7:

305
Chapter 17: Ten SiteBuilder Tips You Really Need to Know

When this occurs, you’ll want to change user IDs within SiteBuilder by follow-
ing these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Change User from the main menu. 
The Sign In to Yahoo! dialog box appears. 
2. Enter the desired Yahoo! ID and password. 
3. Click OK. 
Your new Yahoo! ID is active through the remainder of the SiteBuilder
session. 
Quick Access to the Yahoo! 
Web Hosting Control Panel
As Chapter 14 discusses, the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel is your
online “command and control center” for your Web site. The only downside
is that you have to leave SiteBuilder in order to work with it in your browser.
SiteBuilder at least enables that handoff to be seamless by providing access
to the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel through a menu command. 
To access the online Control Panel, choose Tools➪Web Hosting Control Panel
from the main menu. SiteBuilder asks you to sign in Yahoo! using your Yahoo!
ID and then opens up the Yahoo! Web Hosting Control Panel in your default
browser. 
Embracing Gridlock
A key part of the page design process in SiteBuilder is the arrangement and
organization of the elements on your page. However, because you are free to
move and arrange elements anywhere you please on the page itself, some-
times being exact in your positioning is hard. Often, you end up eyeballing
your Web page in SiteBuilder, and you think everything looks fine, only to
have the elements be a pixel or two off here and there when you see it in
your browser. 
306
Part V: The Part of Tens 

SiteBuilder optionally displays gridlines on your pages to enable you to pre-
cisely position elements on them. It’s kind of like overlaying your Web page
with that graphing paper you used to use in geometry class. 
Gridlines show up on blank pages or pages with backgrounds. However, non-
background graphics do cover up the gridlines. Therefore, if you’re using a
SiteBuilder template that uses graphics to cover most of the page area, you
may not see the gridlines. 
Turning gridlines on and off
To turn on gridlines, choose Arrange➪Show Grid from the main menu. Fig-
ure 17-8 shows a page with the gridlines visible. A check box is added beside
the menu item indicating its visible state. After the gridlines have been turned
on, they remain on until you turn them off by choosing Arrange➪Show Grid
again.

Chapter 17: Ten SiteBuilder Tips You Really Need to Know

Snapping to the grid
By default, you can move elements one pixel at a time anywhere on your
page. However, if that’s too wide open for you, and you’d rather have a little
more control over where to position elements, use the Snap to Grid feature.
When this feature is activated, you can only position elements on a gridline.
Therefore, when you move an element, it goes from one gridline to the next,
bypassing the pixels in between. 
To turn this feature on or off, choose Arrange➪Snap to Grid from the
main menu. 
Adjusting the grid size
By default, the grid is divided into 15-x-15-pixel squares. You can adjust the
size of the grid squares by choosing Arrange➪Grid Size from the main menu.
In the Grid Size dialog box, specify the desired number and click OK. 
Changing the Look and 
Feel of SiteBuilder
When I visit my parents once a year over the holidays, I sit down at my
father’s computer at some point. When I do so, I invariably realize that his
Windows desktop looks the exact same way that it did the year before.
In contrast, my Windows desktop looks different at least twice a week. 
If I back up a little bit and look at all computer users, I suspect that my dad and
I represent two different camps: the defaulters and the tweakers. The default-
ers don’t care about personalization or customization. They care only about
using the computer for productivity purposes. In contrast, the tweakers love
to personalize and customize their working environment to be more produc-
tive or fun.
If you fall into the tweaker camp, you will be glad to know that SiteBuilder
allows you to personalize the look of the product itself, To adjust the look
and feel, follow these instructions:
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 

1. Choose Tools➪Preferences from the main menu. 
2. Click the Look and Feel tab in the Preferences dialog box. 
The Look and Feel tab makes an appearance, as shown in Figure 17-9. 
3. In the Interface drop-down menu, specify whether you want a more
traditional Microsoft Windows look or a Metal look. 
4. Enter the default font style and size for SiteBuilder. 
This font setting is not for your Web pages; it’s only for the SiteBuilder
interface. 
5. If you chose Metal, then you can also specify the color theme in the
Theme box. 
Choose Steel, Amethyst, Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Strawberry Skies,
Smoke, or Custom. 
The Preview area on the right updates to display the active theme look. 
6. Click OK to save your changes. 
Previewing with Multiple Browsers
When you preview your Web site (by clicking the Preview in Browser button
on the toolbar or by pressing F12), SiteBuilder opens the current page in your
default Web browser. However, suppose you have the two major browsers —
Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox — both installed on your 
computer and would like to preview your page in each to ensure consistency. 
Figure 17-9:
What kind

are you in
today?
309
Chapter 17: Ten SiteBuilder Tips You Really Need to Know

Because SiteBuilder doesn’t provide built-in support for local preview with
multiple browsers, use this workaround instead: 
1. In SiteBuilder, click the Preview in Browser button on the toolbar or
press F12. 
The page displays in your default browser. 
2. In the browser’s Address bar, select the URL and copy it to the
Clipboard. 
3. Open your secondary browser. 
4. Click in the Address bar in your secondary browser and paste the URL. 
5. Press Enter to navigate to the preview page. 
I recommend keeping the secondary browser open and pointing to the preview
page. In this way, you can simply click the Refresh button each time you wish
to preview the page.

System Requirements
Make sure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements
shown in the following list. If your computer doesn’t match up to most of
these requirements, you may have problems using the software and files on
the CD. For the latest and greatest information, please refer to the ReadMe
file located at the root of the CD-ROM.
 A PC with a 400MHz Pentium II or faster processor (1GHz Pentium III 
recommended) 
 Microsoft Windows 98 or later (Windows ME/2000/XP recommended) 
 At least 64MB of total RAM installed on your computer; for best perfor-
mance, at least 128MB
 A CD-ROM drive 
 A monitor capable of displaying at least 800 x 600 screen resolution 
 At least 50MB of hard drive space (250MB needed to install all optional
SiteBuilder templates) 
 A modem with a speed of at least 14,400 bps
If you need more information on the basics, check out these books published
by Wiley Publishing, Inc.: PCs For Dummies, by Dan Gookin; Macs For Dummies,
by David Pogue; Windows 98 For Dummies, Windows 2000 Professional For
Dummies, Microsoft Windows ME Millennium Edition For Dummies, or Windows
XP For Dummies, all by Andy Rathbone.

Using the CD with Microsoft Windows
To install from the CD to your hard drive, follow these steps:
1. Insert the CD into your computer’s CD-ROM drive.
Normally, a window appears with a button to install Yahoo! SiteBuilder. 
If no window appears, open the CD drive in Windows Explorer and
double-click the ysitebuilder.exe file. 
2. Click the Install Yahoo! SiteBuilder button.
3. In the Yahoo! SiteBuilder Setup dialog box that appears, click the Next
button to begin installation. 
4. Follow the instructions provided in the setup wizard.
What You Find on the CD
The CD contains the full version of Yahoo! SiteBuilder 2.2, along with a com-
plete bundle of SiteBuilder templates. For more information, visit the Yahoo!
SiteBuilder Web site at http://webhosting.yahoo.com/ps/sb/index.php.

Troubleshooting
I tried my best to compile programs that work on most computers with the
minimum system requirements. Alas, your computer may differ, and some
programs may not work properly for some reason.
The two likeliest problems are that you don’t have enough memory (RAM)
for the programs you want to use, or you have other programs running that
are affecting installation or running of a program. If you get an error message
such as Not enough memory or Setup cannot continue, try one or more
of the following suggestions and then try using the software again:
 Turn off any antivirus software running on your computer. Installation
programs sometimes mimic virus activity and may make your computer
incorrectly believe that a virus is infecting it.
312
Yahoo! SiteBuilder For Dummies 

 Close all running programs. The more programs you have running, the
less memory is available to other programs. Installation programs typi-
cally update files and programs; so if you keep other programs running,
installation may not work properly.
 Have your local computer store add more RAM to your computer. This
is, admittedly, a drastic and somewhat expensive step. However, if you
have a Windows 98 PC, adding more memory can really help the speed
of your computer and allow more programs to run at the same time.
This may include closing the CD interface and running a product’s instal-
lation program from Windows Explorer.
If you have trouble with the CD-ROM, please call the Wiley Product Technical
Support phone number at (800) 762-2974. Outside the United States, call

granted herein.

rights relating thereto remain with WPI and its licensers.

gram for a speciﬁed period of time, the user must pay a registration fee or discontinue use.

tions for these individual programs that are detailed in the “What’s on the CD” appendix and
