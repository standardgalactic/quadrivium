INTRODUCTION 
Notwithstanding 
its title, the reader will not find in this book a systematic 
account of this huge subject. Certain classical aspects have been passed by, 
and the true title ought to be “Various questions of elementary combina- 
torial analysis”. For instance, we only touch upon the subject of graphs 
and configurations, but there exists a very extensive and good literature 
on this subject. For this we refer the reader to the bibliography 
at the end 
of the voiume. 
The true beginnings of combinatorial 
analysis (also called combina- 
tory analysis) coincide with the beginnings of probability 
theory in the 
17th century. For about two centuries it vanished as an autonomous sub- 
ject. But the advance of statistics, with an ever-increasing demand for 
configurations as well as the advent and development of computers, have, 
beyond doubt, contributed to reinstating this subject after such a long 
period of negligence. 
For a long time the aim of combinatorial 
analysis was to count the 
different ways of arranging objects under given circumstances. Hence, 
many of the traditional 
problems of analysis or geometry which are con-

character. Today, combinatorial analysis is also relevant to problems of 
existence, estimation and structuration, like all other parts of mathema- 
tics, but exclusively forfinite 
sets. 
My idea is here to take the uninitiated reader along a path strewn with 
particular problems, and I can very well amagine that this journey may 
jolt a student who is used to easy generalizations, especially when only 
some of the questions I treat can be extended at all, and difficult or un- 
solved extensions at that, too. Meanwhile, 
the treatise remains firmly 
elementary and almost no mathematics of advanced college level will be 
necessary. 
At the end of each chapter I provide statements in the form of exercises 
that serve as supplementary 
material, and I have indicated with a star those 
that seem most difficult. In this respect, I have attempted to write down 

X 
INTRODUCTION 
these 219 questions with their answers, so they can be consulted as a kind 
of compendium. 
The iirst items I should quote and recommend from the bibliography are 
_’ 
the three great classical treatises of Netto, MacMahon 
and Riordan. The 
bibliographical 
references, all between brackets, indicate the author’s 
( name and the year of publication. 
Thus, [Abel, 18261 refers, in the 
1_,\ 
bibliography of articles, to the paper by Abel, published in 1826, Books are 
indicated by a star. So, for instance, [*Riordan, 19681 refers, in the biblio- 
r 
gruphy of books, to the book by Riordan, published in 1968. Suffixes a, b, 
c, distinguish, for the same author, different articles that appeared in the 
same year. 
Each chapter is virtually 
independent of. the others, except of the 
fist; but the use of the index will make it easy to consult each part of the 
book separately. 
I have taken the opportunity 
in this English edition to correct some 
printing errors and to improve certain points, taking into account the 
suggestions which several readers kindly communicated to me and to 
whom I feel indebted and most grateful.

VOCABULARY 
OF COMBINATORIAL 
ANALYSIS 
In this chapter we define the language we will use and we introduce those 
elementary concepts which will be referred to throughout 
the book. As 
much as possible, the chosen notations will not be new; we will use only 
those that actually occur in publications. We will not be afraid to use 
two different symbols for the same thing, as one may be preferable to 
the other, depending on circumstances. Thus, for example, K and CA

tion of A and B, etc. For the rest, it seems desirable to avoid taking 
positions and to obtain the flexibility 
which is necessary to be able to 
read different authors. 
1.1. SUBSETSOFASET;OPERATIONS 
In the following we suppose the reader to be familiar with the rudiments 
of set theory, in the naive sense, as they are taught in any introductory 
mathematics course. This section just defines the notations.

complex numbers, respectively. 
We will sometimes use the following fogicul abbreviations: 
3 (= there 
exists at least one), V (= for all), * (=implies), 
-E (=if), 
o (=if and 
only if). 
When a set 52 and one of its elements o is given, we write “oEQ” 
and we say “w is element of a” or also “0 belongs to 0” or “w in 52”. 
Let n be the subset of elements o of Sz that have a certain property 
9, ll c s2, then we denote this by : 
Clal 
n:= {co I OEi-2, P’>, 
and we say this as follows: “n 
equals by definition 
the set of elements 
w of 52 satisfying 9”‘. When the list of elements a, b, c, . . ., I that constitute

together AI, is known, then we also write: 
n:= 
(a, b, c ,..., I>. 
If N is a finite set, IN1 denotes the number 
of its elements. Hence 
INI =card N=cardinaZ 
of N, also denoted by 8. 
‘Q(N) is the set of all subsets of N, including 
the empty set; Tp’(N) 
denotes the set of all nonempty subsets, or combinations, 
or blocks, of N; 
hence, when A is a subset of N, we will denote this by Ac N or by 
AE~(N), 
as we like. For A, B subsets of N, A, Bc N we recall that 
AnB:=(xIxA,x&}, 
AuS:= 
{x I XEA 
or 
xEB}, 
(the or if net exclusi-qe) j+$-h _-- *I.- --a- ---

B. It sometimes will happen somewhere that we write AB instead of 
AnB, for reasons of economy. (See, for example, Chapter IV.) For each 
family 
S of subsets of N, S: = (A&t, 
we denote: 
n 
A, := {x I VIEI, 
XEA,},

U AI:={x13z~I,x~A,}. 
IEJ 
The (set theoretic) difference of two subsets A and B of N is defined by: 
WI 
A\B:=(xlx~A,x@). 
The complement of A (c N) is the subset N\A 
of N, also denoted by A, 
or CA, or &A. 
Th e operation which assigns to A the set A is called 
i3~3phit3iii. 
Cieariy :

A\B=AnB. 
p(N) 
is made into a Boolean algebra by the operations U, n and 0. 
Such a structure consists of a certain set M (here = !# (N)) with two oper- 
ations v and A (here v =u, 
A =n), and a map of Minto 
itself: a+a’ 
(here A -+ A= c A) such that for all a, b, c, . . . EM, we have: 
[ld] 
(I) 
(avb) 
vc=av 
(bvc), 
(II) 
(u A b) A c= a A (b A c) (associatiuity 
of v and 
A ). 
(III) 
avb=bva, 
(IV) 
a A b = b A a (commutativity 
of v and A ). 
(V) 
There exists a (unique) 
neutral element denoted by 0, for 
v: 
avO=Ova=a. 
(VI) 
There exists a (unique) 
neutral element denoted by 1, for 
h:ahl=lAa=a. 
(VII) 
a A (b v c) = (a A b) v (a A c) (distributivity 
of 
A 
with 
respect to v ). 
(VIII) 
a v (b A c) = (a v b) A (a v c) (distributivity 
of v with 
respect to A ). 
(IX) 
Each aeM 
has a complement denoted by a such that 
aAd=&

interrelations between the operations u,

are the following:

1.2. PRODUCTSETS 
Let be given m finite sets Ni, 1 < i<m, 
and recall that the product 
set 
n;l= i Ni or Cartesian product of the N, is the set of the m-tuples (y): = 
=(Y19Yzr..., 
y,), where y,eN, for all i= 1,2,. . ., m. The product set is 
also denoted by N1 x Nz x ... x N,,, or by N,N,N, 
. . . N,,, if there is no 
danger for confusion. We call yr the projection 
of (y) on NI, denoted by 
P’i (Y), 
If Ni = N2= ... = N,,,= N, the product set is also denoted by N‘“; the 
diagonalA 
ofNm is hence the set of the m-tuples such that yi =y2 = .a* =ym. 
THEOREM. 
The number of elements of the product 
set of a jinite 
number

COMBINATORICS 
of finite 
sets satisfies: 
q In fact, the number of m-tuples (y 1, y 2, . . . . y,) is equal to the product 
of the number of possible choices for y, in N,, which is lN1l, by the number 
of possible choices of y2 in N,, which is lN21, etc., by the number of 
possible choices of ym in N,,,, which is lN,,,l, because these choices can be 
done independently 
from each other. 
n 
Example. 
What is the number d(n) of factors of n, with prime decompo- 
sition n =p”‘p”’ 
1 2 . . .pp? To choose any factor pt’p’$. . .pp of n is the same as 
to choose the sequence (6,, 82, . . . 
=(O, I,2 ,..., a,), 
, 6,) of exponents such that 6+:A,:= 
i=l,

1.3. MAPS 
Let g(M, N) or NM be the set of the mappings f of M into N: to each 
XE M, f associates a ye N, the image of x by f, denoted by y= f (x). We 
write often f:Mw 
N instead of fE3 (M, N). As M and N are finite, 
m = IMI, n= INI, we can number the elements of M, so let M= {x1, x2,. . . , 
x~}. It is clear that giving f is equivalent to giving a list of m elements 
of N, 
say (YI,Y,, 
. . . . y,,,), written in a certain order and with repetitions 
allowed.

1 <i<m:y,=f 
(xi). In other words, giving f is equivalent 
to giving an 
m-tuple EN”, also called an m-selection. 
In this way we find the jus- 
tification for the notation NM for g(M, N). Taking [2a] into account, 
we also have proved the following. 
THEOREM A. The number of maps of M into N is given by 
[3a] 
ls(M, 
N)l = lN”l = lNll”l. 
For each subset A c M, we denote: 
[3b] 
f(A):= 
{f(x) 
I x~A}. 
In this way a map is defined from ‘$J (M) into !$ (N), which is called the 
extension off 
to the set of subsets of M. This is also denoted by f.

For all YEN, the subset of M: 
PI 
f-‘(Y):={xIf(X)=Y}, 
which may be empty, is called the pre-image 
or inverse image of y by f.

B. The number of subsets of M, the empty set included, is given by : 
I31 
pp (M)I 
= 2’4. 
m Let N be the set with two elements 0 and 1. We identify 
a subset 
ACM 
with the mapping f from M into N defined by: f (x)= 1 for XEA, 
and f (x) = 0 otherwise (f is often called the characteristic 
function). 
In 
this way we have established a one-to-one correspondence between the 
sets !p(M) 
._.-- _. 
ancl NM, ~SICP, by [-?a], ‘Q(M) 
has t!le same number of 
elements as NM, which is lNll”l 
=21”1. 
For computing un,=Ip(M)I, 
we can also remark that there are just 
as many subsets of M that do not contain a given point x as there are 
subsets containing it, namely u,,,...~ in both cases. Hence u,=u,,-r 
+ 
+u,,-I =2~,,,-~, which combined with uO= 1 gives ~,,,=2~ indeed. 
n 
We recall that feNM 
is called injective (or is said to be an injection) if 
the images of two different elements are different: x1 #x2 ?f 
(x1) # f (x2); 
f is called surjective 
(or is said to be a surjection) 
if every elemenl of N 
is image of some element in M: Vye N, !lx o M, f (x) = y ; finally f is called 
bijective (or is said to be a bijection) if f is surjective as well as injective; 
in the last case the inverse or rec@rocal of-f, denoted by f -‘, is defined 
by y=S -’ (x), if and only if x=f(y), 
where xeM, 
YEN. 
To count a certain finite set E, in other words, to determine the size, 
consists in principle of constructing a bijection of E onto another set F’, 
whose number of elements is known already; then [El = IFI. 
EXAMPLE. 
Let E be the set of all subsets of N with evelz size, and F 
the set of the others (with odd size). We can choose XEN and build a 
bijection f of E into F as follows: f (A)=Au{x} 
or A\(x) 
according to 
x$A or XEA. Thus, IEl= IFI = (+)I‘$ (N)I =2”-i.

{I, 2, .a., k) = the set of the first k integers 2 1.

COMBINATORICS 
DEFINITION 
A. A k-arrangement 
a of a set N, 1 < k g n = 1 N 1, is an inject ive 
map u from 
[k] into N (formerly called ‘variation’). 
We will denote the set 
of k-arrangements 
of N by ‘91k (N). 
Giving such an a is hence equivalent to giving first a subset of k elements 
of N: 
B = a(Ckl) = {a(l), a(2), . . . . a(k)}, 
and secondly a numbering 
from 1 to k of the elements of B, so finally, a 
totally ordered subset of k elements of N, which will often be called a 
k-arrangement of N too (not quite correct, but quite convenient). 
We introduce now the following notations: 
WI 
n..- 
t*- fi 
i = 1.2.3 . . . . . n, 
if 
n>l; 
O!:=l. 
i=l

l?dl 
<njk:=th 
(n+i-l)=(n(:kl):)! 
=n(n+l)...(n+k-I), 
;f 
k>l;(n),:=l. 
n ! is called n factorial; 
(PI)~ is sometimes called falling 
factorial 
n (of 
order k), and (n>r is sometimes called rising factorial 
n (of order k), or 
also 
the Pochhammer 
symbol. So, (n), = (1)” = n !, (n)k = (n + k - l)k, 
(nX=<n-k+ 
I),. etc. These notations are not vet +pA ~XJJ~ The use of 
, -.. -.I.. 
.I -11. 
(nx in the sense indicated, is inspired by formula [Sal (p. 8) that as- 
sociates the symbols (r~)~ and 
0 
i 
with each other in a symmetrical way, 
both using parentheses. The symbol (IZ)~ that we introduce here for lack 
of any better is not standard, and if often written (n)k in texts on hyper- 
geometric series. For the reader familiar with the r function: 
I?4 
n! = r(n + l), 
(n)k=I’(n+l)/P(n-k+l), 
(TI>~ = r (n + k)/T (n) . 
Besides, for complex z (and k integer 2 0), (z)~ and <z)~ still make sense: 
PI 
(z)~:= z(z - l)... (z-k 
+ l), 
(z)e:= 1 
Pkl 
(z),:=z(z+l)...(z+k+), 
(z),,:=l,

n There are evidently IZ choices possible for the image a(l) of 1 (~[k]); 
after the choice of a (1) is made, there are left only (n - 1) possibilities for 
a (2) because 01 is injective, so c( (2) #cc(l); 
similarly, there are left for 
~(3) only (11-22) possible choices, because c~(3)#a(2) and LX(~)#CC(~), 
etc.; finally, for a(k) there are just (n- kf 1) possible choices left. The 
number of a is hence equal to the product of all these numbers of choices.

DEFINITION 
A. A k-combination 
B, or k-block, of a finite 
set N is a 
nonempty subset of k elements of N: BcN, 
lGk=IBlGn=INI. 
Zf one 
does not know in advance whether k > 1, one says rather k-subset of N (k 20). 
We denote the set of k-subsets of N by &(N). 
A k-block is also called a combination 
of k to k of the n elements of N. 
Pair and 2-block are synonymous; similarly, triple or triad and 3-block, etc. 
Next we show three other ways to specify a k-subset of N, INI =IZ. 
THEOREM 
A. There exists a bijection 
between <q,(N) 
and the set of func- 
tionscp:N-+(O,

or which the sum of the values equals k, xpEN~( y) = k.

THEOREM C. Giving a BE Sp, (N) is equivalent 
to giving a distribution 
of k 
indistinguishable 
balls in n distinct boxes, each box containing 
at most one 
ball. 
q For Theorem A it is sufficient to define for each BE?&(N) 
the 
characteristicfunction 
q=~~ 
by q(y)= 
1 if DEB and =0 otherwise. For 
Theorem B we number the elements of N from 1 to II, N = ( y, , y2,. . ., y,,} ; 
for each BEAM 
we define xr=xi(B) 
by xi= 1 if yiEB and =O other- 
wise. Finally, for Theorem C each box is associated with a point YEN; 
to every BE!Q~(N) 
we associate the following 
distribution: 
the box 
associated with y contains a ball if yeR and no ba!! if y#,~.

THEOREM D. The mrmber 
of k-subsets of N, 0 <k d n = [N 1, denoted by 
equals : 
n. I 
=k!(n-k)!= 
We will adopt the notation 
L 
0 
, used almost in this form by Euler, and 
fixed by Raabe, with the exclusion of all other notations, as this notation 
is used in the great majority of the present literature, and its use is even so 
still increasing. This symbol has all the qualities of a good notation: 
economical (no new letters introduced), 
expressive (it is very close in 
(lZ)k 
appearance to the explicit value -~ -), typical (no risk of being confused 
k! 
with others), and beautiful. In certain cases, one might prefer (n, b) in- 
stead of 
a+b 
( 
> 
a 
(see pp. 27 and 28), so that (a, b) = (b, a) is perfectly 
symmetric in a and b. We recall anyway the ‘French’ notation Ci, and 
the ‘English’ notation “C,. 
l 
We prove equality (*); Ihe others are immediate consequences. If 
k=O, (11)~j0!= 1 [4b, c] (p. 6), and I$(N)I=l 
because q,(N) 
con- 
tains only the empty subset of N. Let us suppose k> 1. With every ar- 
rangement cre&(N), 
we associate B=f(a)=(a(I), 
x(2),..., 
a(k)}~ 
E S(N) 
(P. 7). f is a map from Y&(N) into 5&(N) 
such that for all 
BE’!&(N) 
we have: 
L-W 
1-f-l (B)j = k!, 
since there are k ! possible numberings of B (= the number of k-arrange- 
ments of 13). Now the set of pre-images f-‘(B), 
which 
are 
rnutualiy 
disjoint, covers ‘&(N) 
entirely as B runs through 2&(N). 
Hence, the 
number of elements of Z&(N) equals the sum 
of all If -‘(@I, 
where 
BE&(N), 
which is CSc, (*)I. 
Hence; by [4h! (p. 7) for equality (**), 
arId by [5b] for (***): 
hence 1&(N)I=(rz),/k!.

[se, f] can be verified by substituting 
the values [5a, d] for the binorn-

method 
works (a generalization 
is found 
at 
the end of Exercise 30, p. 169). 
As an example, 
we will also give combinatorial 
proofs of [se, f. g]. 
For [Se], let US choose a point 
XGN, \NJ=n, 
and let .Y and .7 re- 
spectively 
be the system of k-blocks 
of N that contain 
or not contain 
respectively 
the point x. Clearly, 
9’nF=0, 
so: 
PiI 
I(Pkw= 
1-q + v-l. 
Now 
every BBY 
corresponds 
to exactly 
one B’E $3 (N\(x)), 
namely 
B\(x), 
hence: 
C31 
191 = I9-h (N\ (#I = (: I i). 
Also, 9 = vk(N 
- ix}); 
hence: 
[:5k] 
,F\ =(“k’). 
Finally, 
[Si, j, k] imply [se]. 
For [5f], 
let us take the inlerpretation 
of 0 L 
as the number 
of distri- 
butions 
of balls 
in boxes (Theorem 
C, p. 8). We form 
all the 
distributions 
successively. Then we need in total k i 
0 
0 i 
balls. The 11 boxes 
play a symmetric 
role, so every box receives 
(l/n). 
k i 
0 
times a ball. 
Now, 
every distribution 
that gives a ball to a given box, corresponds 
to

ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
Abelian words. One can also give a more abstract definition 
of the 
concept of combination with repetitions, which is important 
to know. 
Let X be a nonempty set, the alphabet: we denote the set of finite sequences 
f of elements of X (also called letters) by X*. We denotef=(x,,&,,= 
= ( xi,, Xii, . . . . x1,), where r is a variable integer > 1. Such a sequence f 
is also called an r-arrangement 
with repetition 
of 3. Hence, when Xc’1 
has the meaning given on p. 4, and when we make the convention to 
let the empty set 0, denoted by 1, also belong to X*, then we have: 
x*:= 
(1) u (,V1 XL”). 
The sequence f = (xll, xi2, . . . , XJ will be identified with the monomial 
or word xlIxj,. . . x!~. In this formj the integer t is cal!ed the &gr~e of the 
monomial or the iength of the word f. By definition, the length of 1 is 0. 
In thecasexisfinite, 
3 : ={xl, 
x2, . . . . x,}, we can denote by a, the number 
of times that the letter Xi occurs in the word f, ai>O, iE[n]; 
in that case 
we often say that f has the specification 
(al, a2, a3,. . ., a,). For example, 
for X:=(x,y}, 
Xc31 consists of the following 8 words: xxx, xxy, xyx, 
yxx, xyy, yxy, yyx, yyy. These can also be written: x3, x’u, xyx, yx’, 
xy’, yxy, y’x, y3. The specifications are then (3,O) (2, 1), (2, 1), (2, 1) 
(1,2), (1,2), (1,2), (0,3), respectively. 
The set X* is equipped with an associative composition law, theproduct 
by juxtaposition, 
which associates with two words f =Xi,x12 . . . Xi, and 
B = Xj$j, 
* - * XI.9 the product 
word :4 =xG.xr- 
..L IL... xkrqsT where 
xk.yxi, 
if 
t,<r, and xk,=xjt-, 
if t >r. One also says that fg is the concatenation 
of 
f and g. This composition law is associative, and has the empty word 1 
as unit element. In this way X* becomes a monoid (that is to say a set 
with an associative multiplication, 
and a unit element), which is called 
the free monoid generated 
by X. Furthermore, when we denote the set of 
words of length n by Xc”], we identify Xcl’ with 3, so XcX*. 
We introduce an equivalence relation on 3*, by defining two wordsf 
and g to be equivalent if and only if they consist of the same letters, up 
to order, but with the same number of repetitions. 
The equivalence class 
that contains f, is called the abelian class off, or also the abelian 
word f. 
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the abelian classes and 
the maps II/ from X into N that are everywhere zero except for a finite 
number of points. In fact, if we index the set E of the VEX where J/(y) > 0, 
VOCABULARY

in such a way that E={y,, 
y2,... y{}, then we can bijectively associate 
with II/ the abelian class of the word: 
y~‘Yl’y~‘Y2’*** 
yf(Yl):= 
~ YlYl... l s 
.a. 
q? (yl) times $ (yZ) times * (x) times 
If X is finite, X=N, 
it is clear that an abelian word is just a combina- 
tion with repetitions, of N (Definition, 
p. 15). 
The set of abelian words Z* can also be made into a monoid, when we 
consider it as a part of N*; this last set is equipped with the usual addition 
of functions I/I. In this way we define the free abelian 
monoid generated 
by X. 
1.8. SSTBS14TS 
OF [n 1 , RANDOM WALK 
Let N be a finite totally prdered set (Definition 
D, p. 59), with n ele- 
ments, which we identify with [n] 
: = { 1, 2,. . . , n). We are going to give 
several interpretations to the specification of a subset p c [n], of cardinal 
p (= [PI). We introduce moreover: 
q:= If’\ = ICPI = it - p. 
(1) To give a PC [n] is equivalent 
to giving an integer-valued 
se- 
quence x(t), 
defined by:

One can represent x(t) by a broken line, which is straight between the 
points with coordinates (t, x(t)). 
Th us, Figure 4 represents the x (t ) 
associated with the block: 
Pbl 
P = (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12} c [12].

Evidently, p+q=n 
and x(n)=(x(n)-x(/z- 
l))+...+(x(2)-x(l))+ 
+x(l)=P-q; 
hence: 
[8c] 
~=3(n+x(n)), 
q=3(n-x(n)). 
This way of determining PC [n] suggests a process, if we imagine that 
t represents successive instants 1, 2,. . ., n. 
(2) Giving PC [n] is also equivalent to giving the results of a game of 
heads or tails, played with n throws of a coin, if we agree that 
x(t)-x(t- 
l)= 
1 e the t-th throw is tails 
(t E [n]) . 
The numbers p, q of [8c] are then the numbers of tails and heads ob- 
tained in the course of the game, respectively. Because of this interpreta- 
tion, the sequence x(t) 
is often called rundom 
walk: ,it translates the 
(stochastic) movements by jumps of + 1 of a moving point on the x-axis, 
whose motion occurs only at the times t= 1,2,. . . n (a kind of Brownian 
movement on a line). 
Giving Pc[n] 
is also equivalent to giving the successive results of 
drawing balls from a vase, which contains p black and q white balls, and 
agreeing that x(t)-x(t- 
I)= 1 -z+ the t-th ball drawn is black (I~[IZ]). 
(3) One often prefers in combinatorial 
analysis to represent PC [zz] by 
a polygonal line V which joins the origin (0,O) with the point B with 
coordinates (p, q) such that the horizontal sides, having lengths one and

sides correspond to the points of the complement of p. Thus, Figure 5 
represents the subset p defined by [Sb]. Such a polygonal line may be 
called ‘minimal 
path’ joining 0 to B (of length n =p + q). (In fact, there 
does not exist a shorter path of length less than n, which joins 0 to B, 
Fig. 5. 
consisting of unit length straight sections bounded by points with integer 
coordinates.) 
(4) Finally, giving PC [n] is also equivalent to giving a wordf with two 
letters a and b, of length n, where the letter a occurs p times, and the letter 
b occurs q times, p= IPI (see p. 18). Thus, the word representing P of 
[8b] is bbabaaaabaaa. 
Now we treat two examples of enumerations in [IZ].

which candidates B and.9 receivep andq votes respectively 
(so 9 is elected), 
then the probability 
that candidate 22 has constantly rhe majority 
during the 
countins of the votes is equal to (q -p)((q 
+p). 
This is the famous ballot problem, 
formulated by [Bertrand, 18875; we 
give the elegant solution of [Andre, 
18873. Desire Andre, born Lyon, 
1840, died Paris, 1917, devoted most of his scientific activity to combina- 
torial analysis. A list and a summary of his principal works are found 
in PAndre, 
19101. See also Exercises 11 and 13 pp. 258 and 260. 
n We first formulate the principle 
of reJlection, which essentially is due 
to Andre. Let be given a line D parallel to the line x=y, and two points 
A, B lying on the same side of D (for instance above, as in Figure 6). The 
number of minimal 
paths (the adjective minimal will be omitted in the 
sequel) joining A with B that intersect or touch D, is equal to the number

Fig. 6. 
of paths joining 
B with the point A’ which lies symmetric to A with 
respect to D. In fact, when Zstands for the first point that V has in common 
with D, going from A to B, we can let the path V=(A, 
Z, B) correspond 
to the path Q’= (A’, Z, B), which is just the same as % between Z and B, 
but with the part A’Z just equal to the image by reflection with respect to 
D of the part AZ of V. 
Now let C(A, B) be the set of paths joining A (xTA, yA) with B(x,, yD), 
O<X,,<X~, O<y,<y,. 
Clearly, the number of paths joining 
A with B 
equals :

23 
because giving a path is equivalent to choosing a set of (x, -x~) horizontal 
segments among (x,-f- ye - xA-yA) 
places (the duration of the walk). 
Let us call a suitable path one that satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 
B. The number of suitable paths, which is the number of paths joining 
W(0, 1) with B(p, q) without intersecting the line x= y, is hence, by the 
principle of reflection equal to IC( IV, B)I - IC( V, B)I (Figure 7); which 
means, by [8g], equal to (p+p4-1)_(pp+;l), 
hence the result, after 
simplifications.

The probabilistic interpretation 
supposes that every path EC(O, B) is 
equally probable, so that the probability 
we look for is the quotient of 
the number of suitable paths (which we found already), and the total 
number of paths joining 0 with B, which is 1C (0, B)J = (“) : we find that 
\P/ 
the probability is (q-p)/(q+p), 
as announced. Every step represents avote, 
the horizontal ones being for B and the vertical ones for d.

Let N be a finite set of n points placed on a circle with equal distances

with 
which we can associate the circular word bbaabaaaabbaaabb, where the 
i-th term equals a or b according to whether IEP or #P, O<i,<n - 1. 
We show now an example of enumeration in [ii].

PC [ii] with th e o

(that means on each of the two open arcs VW of the circle on which we think 
[ii] situated) there are at least l( Z 0) points of [ii] that do not belong to 
P. Then: 
n When JY stands for the set of the Pc[ri] 
that satisfy the condition 
mentioned in the theorem, [I] : = (0, 1,. . ., I?

DEFINITION 
A. Let JZ be a finite (ordered) sequence of subsets, distinct 
or not, empty or not, of a set N: 
.A:= 
(A,, 
A,, 
. . . . A,), 
AlCN, 
iE[m], 
in 3 1. 
We say that .M is a division of N (confusion with partition 
(Definition C, 
p. 30) should be avoided), or m-division if we want 
to specify 
of how 
many subsets it consists, if the union of the Ai, ie[m] is N, and if these A, 
are mutually disjoint. We denote: 
[lOa] 
N=A,+A,+***+A, 
or 
N=i$IAi, 
(notation of [*Neveu, 19641, p. 3) as one wishes. 
For example, with N={a, b, c,d,e}, AI:=O, 
A,:={b,d), 
A3:=0, 
A,:= 
= {a, c, e}, the ordered set d:=(A,, 
AZ, A,, A4) is a 4-division of N. 
For each division, the nonempty subsets are evidently different and mutu- 
ally disjoint, and between their cardinalities the following relation exists:

Many identities are only the consequence of [lob]: 
one counts a set 
in two different ways, which gives a combinatorial proof of the identity 
which is to be examined. 
Examples. 
(1) Let E be the set of nonempty subsets of A : = { 1, 2,. . ., 
m + 11, and let us call E, (c E) the set of subsets of A for which the greatest 
element isj( > 1). Evidently, E=xim=+: Ej. Now, IEI =2”‘+l- 
1 and lEjj = 
=2’-’ 
(the number of subsets of { 1,2, ..,,j- 
1)). Then, by using [lob] 
we obtain* 2m+‘-l=l+2+22+~~~+2m. 
More generally, for any in- 
. 
tegers x, y, ma 1, we could prove by a strictly combinatorial 
argument 
the well-known identity: 
X m-k-1 - ym+l =(x-y)(x”+xm-1y+xm-2y2+...). 
(2) Let Z=X+ 
Y be a division of the set Z, x: = 1x120, y: =I YI 20. 
We denote E for the set of all A CZ such that I,41 =n (E= ‘!&(Z)), and Ek

Until recently one said that JZ was a permutation 
with repetition 
of aI 
elements of N, a2 elements of N, etc. Notation [IOc’] which we introduce 
here and whose virtues we wish to recommend now, is not standard yet, 
but seems to become more and more in use. Anyway, it has the qualities 
of a good notation (cf. p. 8) and it is hard to imagine a simpler one. 
Moreover, 
it has the advantage over [IOc] of being coherent 
with the 
classical notation of the binomiuI coefhcients. In fact, if we use [lOc] for 
the case of binomial coefficients, we get the notation (k&k) 
for (;)’ 
which is undesirable. On the contrary, it seems good to extend the usual 
notation for the binomial coefficients in the case of 
with x a real or 
complex variable, by the following notation:

by Theorems B and

the summation taking place over all systems 
of integers (a,, a2, . . . . a,,,) that occur as exponents of the terms on the 
right-hand side of [ 1 Og]. Obtaining x”,lxy . . . xf” in the expansion of the 
product PIP:, . . . is equivalent to giving a division of the set (PI, P,, . . ,, P,} 
into subsets A,, AZ, . . . . A,,, such that IAil =ai, iElm]. This we do with the 
understanding that this division corresponds to multiplying 
the ‘x1’ of 
the a, factors P,EA~ by the ‘x2’ of the a2 factors PI~A2, etc. (if ai=O, 
then one just multiplies by 1). Hence, on one hand: 
Cl OhI a, f a2 -t-e..+ a, = n, 
aieN, 
ie[m] 
; 
on the other hand, the number of terms x;lxF . . ., where the ai are fixed 
such that [ lOh] holds, is equal to (a,, a2, . . . , a,,,), by [ IOc’]. 
n 
Thus, (x,+x~+~~~+x,,,)~=~~~:= 
x~,+~~~~~~,~,,,x~x~; 
because the 
solutions of a,-!-...+-a,,,=2 
are of the form: (I) aL=2, al=0 if ifk, 
in 
which case [lOc] = 1; (II) al=aj=

Moreover, 
the number of c’s in the expansion of 
(x1 +x2 + . ..)” is exactly p(n), the number of partitions of n, p. 94. (See 
also Exercise 28, p. 126, and Exercise 9, p. 158.) Multinomial

enjoy congruence properties, analogous to [6g, g’] p. 14, the proof being 
very similar:

DEPIN~ION C. A non-ordered (finite) 
set B of p blocks of N (=p-system 
of N, cf. p. 3), 9’~ ‘p’ (N), is called a partition 
of N, or p-partition 
if 
one wants to specryy the number of its blocks, if the union of all blocks of 
B equals N, and if these blocks are mutually 
disjoint. 
Hence in a partition, 
as opposed to a division (1) no ‘subset’ is empty; (2) 
the ‘subsets’ are not labelled. 
Similar to [lOa], we denote for such a partition, in order to express 
the fact that B, B’&=>BnB’=@: 
NeBT/Y 
VB0, 
IBI 2 1. 
Evidently there is a bijection between the set of equivalence relations of 
N and the set of partitions of N: we just associate with every equivalence 
relation d the partition whose blocks are the equivalence classes of b. 
TKEOREM D. Let f be a map of M into N, fEN”.

f -l(y),

called the partition induced by f on M. 
This is evident. It follows in particular, for each f E N M that:

1.11. BOUND 
VARIABLES 
It is well known that a finite sum of il terms x1, x2, . . . , x,, real numbers, 
or, more generally, in a ring, is denoted by x1 +x,+.e. 
-tx, (such a way 
of writing, of course, does not mean at all that n>3), or eveu better: 
[lla] 
i 
xke 
k==l 
We generalize this notation. Let m be an integer > 1, and f a real-valued 
function (or, more generally, with values in a ring) defined for all points 
(=m-tuples) 
c:=(cl, 
c2,..., c,,,) of a product set: 
[lib] 
E:=E, 
x E, x-.*x 
E,. 
(Frequently we will have E1 = E, = ... =E,,,=N.) 
If f is only defined on 
61 (cE), 
it will be extended to the whole of E by 0, in most cases. Let us 
consider a finite set I’cE. 
The expression S, denoted in any of the fol- 
lowing four ways:

f(c)

(Cl, c2, .*., c,), 
equals by definition 
the finite sum of the values off in each point c of r, 
which is called the summation 
set. If I’nE=@, 
we give S the value 0. 
L-1

EMPTY SUM 
CONVENTION:

f(c):

Sometimes we qualify S by saying that it is a multiple 
sum of order m. 
ForIn=l,2, 
3 ,..., one says usually simple, double or triple sum. 
It is clear that the value [ 1 lc] of S is completely determined by r and 
f. Thus, S does not depend on c=(cl, cd, . . . . c,), even though it occurs in 
formula [l lc]. For this reason, the letters c or (cl, c2, . . . . c,) are called 
bound variables of the summation (dummy or dead are also used synon- 
ymously for bound). It is useful to note the analogy with the notation 
I= Stf (x) dx of the integral, in which x is also a bound (real) variable, 
while Z only depends on a, b and f. 
Usually, the summation set r is defined by a certain number of condi- 
tions or restrictions, %‘,, V,, . . . . V, on the c,, c2, . . . . c,; these conditions

If the expression for the pi is not very simple, it is better to avoid 
writing it underneath or on the side of the summation sign C, but following 
it. In that case one uses a phrase like “the summation takes place over all 
c such that . . .“. 
Quite often one needs some letters different from cl, c2,. .., say d,, d,, . . . . 

32 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
in the detailed description of the conditions E4,. It is important to distin- 
guish these from the bound variables, especially in the case that we wish 
to use notation [lie]. 
Therefore we introduce the 
Wsl 
DOT CONVENTION: 
every letter with a dot underneath 
stands for 
a bound variable. 
Of course, we do not have to dot every bound variable: in [l If], for 
example, there is but one possible interpretation. 
We must try to limit 
the dots to the cases where there is possible danger of confusion or am- 
biguity (examples follow). Furthermore, each variable needs only to be 
pointed once, and not every time it appears in the conditions Vi, V,, . . . . 
In general, however, we are not at all embarrassed by excesses, as far as 
this is concerned. The use of dots under the bound variables is imposed 
upon us by our total and absolute rejection of the notation by repeated 
c signs (which is still commonly used), for any multiple sum of order m 
(Theorem B below). 
Before demonstrating the preceding by examples, we still put the

SERIES

General remarks 
The concept of formal power series is a generalization 
of polynomial. 
We think the best is to sketch here the outlines of the theory, following 
Bourbaki 
([*Bourbalci, 
Algebre, 
chap. 4, 5, 19591, p, 52-69; see also 
[*Dubreil

19641, p. 124-31, [*Lang,

[*Zariski, 
Samuel, II, 19601, p. 129); we will refer to this author for 
proofs and more details. 
In this section, each small Greek letter represents ajrlite 
sequence of k 
integers 20, where k is an integer 2 1, which is given once and for all. 
Such a sequence is sometimes also called a multi-index. 
Thus, if we write 
k:=Ntk1,inwhich[k]:={l,2 
,..., k},thenaokmeansthata=(a,,a,

ak), where aioN.

c, : = c LI,,(12,

We will consider the case of formal series in k variables over a field 
C (often C=R or C). 
DEFINITION 
A. A formal power series $ in k indeterminates (or variables) 
t,, t2, . . ., . .., tk over C is a formal 
expression 
of the following 
type: 
@W 
f = f(t) = f (11, 
t29 . . ‘9 fk) = C,,e,i a$ 
= p,,II*;Pk,O 
Qwz . . . . . s*w!? 
*. * t? 3 
where ap = a,,,, p2 ,.... IIk, the coefficients off, form 
a multiple series of order 
k with values in C. Each expression 
a/ 
=aP, ,1(2 ,... , Iry t f’ . . . tl” is called 
a monomial off. 
As the pl, pz,. . . , pk are bound variables, 
they can have a 
dot underneath. 
We denote C[[ti, 
t2, . . . . tk]], or even better 
Ck[[t]], 
which is called the set of formal 
series f. 
f is a polynomial if all coefficients except a finite number of them equal 
zero, which is usually formulated by saying “almost 
all ar are zero”. In

simple cases we sometimes avoid to write [12b] by using an ellipsis mark, 
three consecutive periods, especially if there is only one indeterminate. 
For example :

n;. ~“ERI [Cdl = R CL-t11 - 
Every power series in several variables, which is convergent in a certain 
polydisc, can be interpreted as a formal series. Conversely, with every 
formal series in several indeterminates can be associated with a power 
series that perhaps converges in the point 0 only. The following expansions: 
C12cl

can be as well considered as functions in their radius of convergence as 
well as certain formal series, which are called respectively: formal

iognrithrii,

2nd form). Moreover, for [12e’] we have also, if x is an integer 
> 1: 
(1 -t)-qx>.(y) 
t”. Furthermore, the series [12e, e’] canalso be 
interpreted as series in two indeterminates t and x. 
From now on, in the sequel of this book, each power series must be con- 
sidered as a formal 
series, unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
As in the case of polynomials, 
C,[[t]] 
becomes an integral domain, 
if we provide it with addition and multiplication 
as follows: for every

The constant term off 
is a,=f,,,, 
also denoted by f (0). The order 
off (which we suppose different from the series 0, all whose coefficients 
equal zero), is the smallest integer n 2 0, such that f (“I # 0. For example, 
w(tlt2 + (tIt2)’ 
+ .*+)=2. Clearly, o (fg)=w 
(f) 
+u(g). 
The series I is the 
series all whose terms are zero except the constant term, which equals 1. 
For example, by [12e, e’], we have formally: 
(l+t)“(l-tt)--“=l, 
which results from the same property for the associated convergent ex- 
pansions.

Mult@licable 
families 
of formal 
series 
DEFINITION 
C. A family 
of formal 
series ( fJIEL 
is called multiplicable 
if 
for 
almost 
all (p. 38) IEL, firstly 
the constant term of fi 
equals 1, sec- 
ondly the coeficient 
al,p of tll in fi equals 0, for 
each sequence pi li such 
that 1~12 1. The product g =‘&EL 
b,tP of this family 
is then defined by: 
[12k] 
b,: = the coe@cient of tp in thejnite 
product 
nfi, 
where 
/EL, 
and w (fl -fi 
(0)) S 114 . 
We denote g=nlELfi. 
For L =N, (fJ is multiplicable if the order w ( fi -fl (0)) tends to infinity, 

40 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
when 1 tends to infinity. For example&: = (I+ trt:) is multiplicable. Every 
finite family is evidently multiplicable, and we get back definition [ 12g] 
for the product. Explicitly, for one single variable t and One sequence ( f,) 
of formal series, i= 1,2,. ..,fr: =&c 
a,~“, 
we have, if we write out the 
bound variables n, completely in (*): 
where the last summation makes sense, because it contains only a finite 
number of terms (cf. Definition C). (On this subject, see also p. 130.) 
(IV) 
Substitution 
(also called composition) 
of formal 
series 
THEOREM C. Let (gdt.t,,l 
be p formal 
series ECq[[t]] 
without constant 
terms: o(g,)> 
1. We can ‘substitute’ 
gi for ui, iE[p], 
into every formal 
series f=~,.+z#‘~Cp[[u]]. 
In th is way we obtain a new formal 
series, 
called the composition off 
and g, and denoted f (gl, g2, . . . . gP) or fog, 
which belongs again to C,[[t]]. 
By dejinition, 
fig 
equals the sum of the 
summab~efami~ya~,....,~~(g~)~‘...(gp)l(P,where~=(~1,~2,...,~p)4(=L). 
For example, using [12c, d], it can be verified that 
log (exp t) = t , 
exp(log(1 
+ t)} = 1 + t. 
Now we want to find the formal expansion of h : = (1 + tl + t, -l- ..a + 
+-tcl)X~Rg[[t]]. 
Applying 
Theorem C, with f :=(I +u)Z~Rr[[u]], 
g := 
=t, +t2+-+t,ER,[[t]], 
we get by using [12e] (p. 37) for equality 
(*) and [lOf] (p. 28) for (*a):

series 
With every formal series f =xnaO a$’ in one indeterminate 
t, we can 
associate the formal 
derivative, 
denoted by:

Df 
= dq 
= “z. na,t”-’ 
= “go (n f 1) a,+ltn,

and also the formal 
primitive:

All the usual properties hold: DPf =f, D(fg)= 
(Df ). g +f. (Dg), etc. 
The iterates of these operations can easily be found. For the derivation 
we have: 
D”f = c (n)k antn-k

and for the primitivation 
we have:

These concepts can be generalized without difficulties to more

where E and 1 t 1 are sufficiently small, so that f (x, y) is regular for 1x1 <E

contains all the poles off (z, t/z) that tend to 0 when t tends to 0. For 
instance, forf(x, 
Y)=C,,,~ (m, n) xmyn=(l-~-y)-i,

Laurent 
series 
These series are written analogously 
to the preceding, [12b] (p. 36), 
but here the indices and the exponents pl, /12,. .., pk can take all integer 
values $0, with the condition that the coefficients afl,,...,Pr that contain 
at least one index ~0, are almost 
all zero. For example: 
(1) With one single indeterminate t: (t2+t3+~~~)-1=(t2(1-t)-1)-1 
=t-2-t-l 
(2) With *two indeterminates 
t, and t, : c t:‘tp, 
pr </!2 <2pl + 10, 
where the integers ,u~, ,uZ can be negative as well as positive or zero. 
All the preceding: operations, summable families, derivation, etc., can 
be easily done for such series.

19611) 
Let X* stand for the free monoid generated by X (see p. 18) and let 
f:ut3ap 
be a map from 3* into a certain ring A (,u is a word over X). 
If we write f as a formal series: f:=CpEX.

maps f becomes an aigebra, caiied the monoid aigebra

words such that xil=p, in the sense of the juxtaposition 
product of p. 18. 
If X is finite and if one considers the Abelian words of X, then the ordinary 
formal series studied above are found back again.

The most interesting case is that where (at least) one of the entire series 
[13a] has a positive nonzero radius of convergence R, and converges 
for It\<R 
to a composition 
of elementary known functions; 
in this 
case the properties of these functions can be used to give new information 
about the a,. (For a detailed study of the relation between a, and their 
GF, the reader is referred to any work on difference calculus; for example 
[*Jordan (Ch.), 19471 or PMilne-Thomson,

Moreover, if we let ljxll denote the integer closest to x (x not supposed

The Fibonacci numbers have a simple combinatorial meaning: F,,, is 
the number of subsets of [n] = (1,2,. . ., n} such that no two elements are 
adjacent (Subsets with 0 or 1 element are convenient). In fact, according 

46 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
to [8d] (p. 21), the number F,+, of such subsets equals C, (“+‘-p‘l. 
Hence, it follows that Fn+i = $;~;)+$;“)=Fnml 
+tp.‘ (b;&, 
p. 10) and F. = Fl = 1. Thus, the sequences F. and & coincide, because they 
satisfy the same defining recurrence relation. (See also Exercise 13, p. 76, 
and Exercise 31, p. 86.) It can also be shown that the number G, of subsets 
of [ti] (p. 24) such that any two points are not adjacent, equals F, + F,- z 
(subset 4 is convenient), in other words G, =a” +/I”, G, = G,- r -t G,-, 
and ~naoG,,t”-(t+2tZ)(1

More 
generally, defining

proved that F(n+l, 
I) is the number of subsets BC [n] such that any two 
elements of B are always separated by at least Z( > 0) elements of C B. 
For subsets Bc [fi] with the same property, 
the number is G(n, I) 
where (t+(Z+l)t”‘)(l-~t-~~‘~)-‘:=~,~~G(n,Z)t”. 
(11) Multiple 
sequences 
The concept of GF can be immediately generalized to multiple sequences. 
We explain the case of double sequences. The three most used GF are 
the following formal series: 
qt, u) := 1 a”$“uk, 
“,k,O 
Y(t,u):= c a”,k;i;;, 
n,k,O 
. 
. 
@(t, u):= c a,,$$ uk, 
n,k30 
the last one, 0, being especially used in the case of a triangular 
sequence 
(*a,,,k=O, 
if not O<k<n). 
We now investigate the double sequence of 
binomial coefficients, a,,&: = i 
, as an example:

’ is the modified Bessel function of order 
0; because this function is complicated, Y (t, u) is not considered very 
interesting. 
(III) 
General remarks on generating functions 
We return to the case of a simple sequence a,. 
(1) If the power series f(z) =CnaO a,z” converges for all complex 2 
(of 
(z) is an entire function), then the Cauchy integral theorem gives: 
[13i] 
a,, =zai 
s 
f(z) 
z-“-l 
dz, 
where the integral is taken over a simple curve enclosing the origin, and 
oriented counterclockwise. Usually, when f (z) is ‘elementary’, [ 13i) can 
very well be used for estimating a, for great n by the Laplace method or 
the saddlepoint method (see, for instance, [*De Bruijn, 19611). In the 
case that the radius of convergence off 
(z) is finite, a Darboux type 
method can be used (see p. 277). 
(2) Of course one can associate with the sequence still others than 
those of [13a]. For example: 
WI 
~io=“xoa”~

which are called respectively ‘factorial 
GF’ (mostly studied by YNijrlund, 

48 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
1924]), ‘Lambert GF’ ( see Exercise 16, p. 161), and ‘Newton GF’ (see 
Exercise 6, p. 221). 
(3) Among the several GF defined in [13a, j, k, l] are all kinds of rela- 
tions that allow us to pass from one to the other. We cite for example: 
@(l/z)=z jg e-“’ Y(t) dt (called the Laplace-Carson transform of Y), 
a(z)= 
j; t’-‘@(l-t) 
dt.

The Eulerian numbers A (n, k) (not to be confused with Euler numbers 
E,, p. 48) are generated as follows: 
l34tl 
2~(t,u):=-&~uz:=I+I<~~~A(n.k)~~uk~1.

It is easily verified that: 
(2~-u2)~+(tu-1)~+21=0,

from which follows, if we put the coefficient of uk-‘t”/n! 
in this partial 
differential equation equal to 0, the following recurrence relation: 
[14u] 
A(n + 1, k) = (n- 
k+2)A(n, 
k- 
l)+ 
kA(n, k), 
n20, 
k>2, 
with initial conditions: A(n, l)=l 
for n>O and A(0, k)=O if k>2. An- 
other GF, denoted by !?I1, is sometimes easier to handle:

We will treat in some detail these famous examples of the use of CF. 
(I) 
Catalan problem 
Consider a product P of n numbers XI, X,, . . . X,, in this order, P = X,X, 
. . . 
X,. We want to determine the number of different ways of putting brackets 
in this product, each way corresponding to a computation of the product 
by successive multiplications 
of precisely two numbers each time ([Cata- 
lan, 18381). Thus, a2 = 1, as - -2 and a4 = 5, according to the following list 
of bracketings : 
WI 
(X1X2> 
(X3X4>, 
i(XlX2>

WI 
(X2X3)) 
X4,

* 
One could also suppose that the sequence, or word, S:= XI, X, ..*, X,, 
is taken from a set with a multiplicatively 
written composition law, which 
is neither associative nor commutative; then a, is the number of correct 
ways of putting brackets, also called well-bracketed 
words, in S. One can 
also reason from a single element XeE, and observe that a,, is the number 
of ways we can interpret a product all whose n factors equal X in E. For 
n--4 we get then for the list in [lSa] the following: 
[15b] 
X2.X2, 
(X’.XjX, 
(X.X2)X, 
X(X2.X), 
X(X.X’). 
Notations [15a, b] become quickly clumsy and difficult to handle, but 
we observe that any nonassociative product also can be represented by 
a bifurcating 
tree. Figure 9 (corresponding to n=4) 
shows what we 
mean. The height of the tree is the number of levels above the root R (it

Let us Anally mention two other representations of Catalan bracketings. 
(1) Triangulations 
of a convex polyon (see also Exercise 8, p. 74). The 
following example clearly explains the rule:

((X,X,,X,,X~ 
cx,cx*x,))x~

X,CX,cX,X,)) 
(2) Majority 
paths (from Andre, p. 22). Every path joins A (0, 2) to 
B(n - 2, n) with the following convention : any opening bracket ( signifies 
a vertical step and any letter different from X,-t and X, a horizontal step. 
Using Theorem B (p. 21), with p = n - 2, q = n, we easily obtain [ 15e].

X2, b, =2, because (X2.X)X=(X.

If one prefers, one can also consider b, as the 
number of binary trees, two trees being considered identical if and only 
if one can be transformed into the other by reflections with respect to 
the vertical axes through the nodes. Thus, Figure 10 shows that b, =3:

We return to the noncommutative

of bracketings of X1, X,, se., X,, where we allow this time in each bracket 
an arbitrary number of adjacent factors. For example, for n = 4, we must

For a recurrence relation we consider again the last multiplication: 
this

I1 factors consist of one letter, I, of two letters, etc. Hence:

I1 + 21, +a--+ 
(n - 1) l.-1 + nl, = n,

to arrange these I factors of the last operation, because the choice of a 
particular 
sequence of these 1 factors just means giving a ([r , I,, . . . , I,)- 
division of [I] (cf. p. 27). Hence:

Hence, when we consider K(t) as a function of t, we get: 
c(t)=+(l+t-,/i-66t+t2). 
If we expand the root (I+ u)rj2, a= -6t+

the Taylor coefficients of any algebraic function ([Comtet, 
1964]), the 
coefficients being polynomials in n. In the case of CC(t), which is clearly

DEFINITION 
A. An al-ary relation % between m (22) 
sets N,, N,, . . . . N,, 
isa (possibly empty) subset of theproduct 
set Nl x N, x .a. x N,,,. An m-tuple 
( Xl, 
X2,“‘, 
x,) 
is said to satisfy 3, if and only if (x1, xt, . . . . x,) 
E’%. If 
I 
N, = N, = .” = N,,, = N, then % is called an m-ary relation on N, ‘3 c N”. 
The case that is most interesting for us, is the case of the binary (m=2) 
relations on N, %IcN~. In this case we denote u!Ru [or not u%u] if 
(a, O)E% [or if (u, u)$%]. For N finite, a good visualization 
of ‘3 is 
obtained by numbering the elements of N, N: = {x,, x2, . . . . x,} and then

make a rectangular lattice consisting of n vertical lines Vi, each corre- 
sponding to an x*EN, ie[n] and n horizontal lines Hj, each corresponding 
as welI to an X/EN (in Figure 12, n=7). The points of the intersections 
of V, and H, represent the points of N2, and each point of % is indicated 
by a little dot l . For instance, in Figure 12, x2%x5, not x,%x,. 
The points 
(xi, xi), ie[n] 
are the points on the diagonal 
A (see p. 3). The lattice 
representation thus introduced can also be applied to any relation between 
two sets N1 and N,, if we think of N1 as the ‘abscissa’, and of N, as the 
‘ordinate’. 
Another 
representation, 
called matrix 
representation 
of ‘SC N1 x 
x N,, IN11 =nl, lNZl =n2, consists of associating with this relation 
an 
n, x n2 matrix of 0 and 1, defined by a,, j= 1 if (xi, x~)E% and 0 otherwise, 
called the incidence matrix of %.

DEFINITION 
B. Let ‘3 be a binary relation on N, % c N’. (I) The reciprocal 
or inverse relation 
of !)I, denoted ‘3-l 
is defined by x%-‘y-=-y’3ix 
(the 
lattice image of Xi-’ 
is hence obtainedfrom 
the lattice image of %, by re-

with respect to the diagonal 
A). (II) % is called total or complete, 
if and only if for all (x, y)~ N2 x%y or y’Rx( o%u%?~’

which is not total, is called partial. (III) 
% is called reflexive, if and only

section of 
% along x is the subset (x 1 ‘%) of N consisting of the YEN such that x%y. 
Similarly, 
the second section, or horizontal 
section (!R 1 y), YEN is the set 
of HEN satisfying x%y. If ‘8 is symmetric, 
then (x 1 3) = (3 1 x). (VIII) 
The first projection of % on N, denoted bypr,‘% 
equals {x I XEN, 3ytzN, 
x%y}. Similarly, 
the second projection is pr,%: = (y I YEN, IxEN, 
x%y}. 
Finally, we recall the two most important binary relations. 
DEFINITION 
C. An equivalence relation ‘33 on N is a binary relation, 
that 
is rejexive, 
symmetric 
and trunsitive. 
Then we say that x and y are equiv- 
alent, ifandonly 
ifx%y. 
The section (x 1 3) = (‘3 I x) is called equivalence 
class of x: this is the set of y that are equivalent 
to x. 
The number a(n) 
of equivalence relations on N, INI =n, in other words, 
the number of partitions of N will be extensively studied (see p. 204). 
DEFINITION 
D. An order relation % on N is a binary relation 
on N, which 
is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. Often x<y 
is written instead of 
x%y. A set is said to be ordered, if it has been provided 
with an order 
relation; 
if, moreover, 
for all x, YEN, x=$y or y>x, 
then the set is called 
totally ordered. The section (x I %2> = (u I x< u} is called the set of upper 
bounds of x and the section (‘3 I y) =(u 
I u<y) 
is called the set of lower 
bounds of y. For x, YEN the segment [x, y] is the set of ZEN 
such 
that 
x < z < y. x < y means x < y and x # y. A chain with k vertices (and length 
k- 
1) connecting x, YEN is afinite 
set zl, z2, . . . . zk such that x=zl 
<z, < ..a 
... <z, = y. A lattice is an ordered set N such that for each pair 
(x, y) of 
elements of N there exist: (1) an element bEN, 
often denoted by xv y, 
which is the smallest element of the set of upper bounds for both x and y 
(also called least upper bound), 
in the sense that x< b, y < b and x< v, 
JJ < v *b 
< V; (2) an element aE N, often denoted by x A y, the largest lower 
bound of both x and y (also called greatest lower bound), 
in the sense that 
a<x, 
a<y 
and u<x, 
u<y*u<a. 
The number d. of the order relations on N, IN 1 =n, equals the number of 
T,-topologies 
of N ([*Birkhoff, 
1967, p. 1171) and the existence of a 
simple explicit formula seems completely impossible; even asymptotic

Though we do not want to study graphs, we will sometimes use a little 
of the language of graph theory, hence this and the next section. We 
have to make a choice among the various current names of certain con- 
cepts, since in this field, the terminology is not yet completely standardized. 
Actually, this situation has some advantages, as it compels each publica- 
tion on this subject to define its terms carefully. Any book on graphs 
can be used as a first introduction to graph theory. (For example [ *Berge,

Let N be a finite set. We recall that a pair B of N is a 2-block of N 
(=2-combination, 
or subset of two elements, p. 7); BE‘$~ (N). 
DEFINITION 
A. A graph (over 
N) 
is a pair 
(N, 9), in which 3 is a set 
(possibly empty) of pairs of N, $9~ 1J2 (N). 
The elements of N are called 
tile nodes or vertices of the graph, and the pairs (ES) are called edges of 
the graph. One often says “the graph 9” rather than “the graph (N, 9)“, 
when the set N is given once and for all. 
THEOREM 
A. Giving a graph 9 on N is equivalent 
to giving a binary relation 
I 
on N, $c N2, which is symmetric and antireflexive, 
called incidence 
relation associated with 9. 
W Define Y by xXy-=-{x, 
y}ES n 
A convenient plane representation of a graph consists in drawing the 
nodes as points and the edges as straight or curved segments, and ignoring 
their intersections. Figure 13 represents N: = {a, b, c, . . . . k, Z} and 9: = 
: = {{a, b}, {b, 4, {c, 4, 
{c, f 1, {d, e>, id, s>, {e, k), {e, f>, If, 
s>, {f,jl,

DEFINITION 
B. Let y(~5J.3~ (N)) 
be a graph over N. (I) An edge con- 
taining a node X(E N) is called incident with x, and 9(x) 
designates the 
set of these edges. The number 1% (x)1 of edges inciderzt with x, also denoted 
by 6 (x), is called the degree of x. Two nodes x and y are called adjacent, 
if {x, y> E 3. Similarly, 
two edges are called adjacent if they have a node 
in co~~~~~ro~l. 
A node is called an end point or terminal node, 
if its degree 

62 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
equals 1; the edge adjacent 
to x (which is unique) is also called terminal. 
An isolated node is one with degree 0. (II) (N’, S’) is a subgraph of (N, 3) if 
N’cN, 
g”cS, 
+?‘cv, 
(N’); 
it is called a complete subgraph (or a 
clique), with support N’ if Y= !JJZ (N’). An independent set L (cN) 
in 
u graph ‘9 is a set such that q, (L) n 9 = 0; hence is a complete subgraph 
of the complementary graph, which is the graph g: = !& (N) - 3. (III) 
A path or chain connecting 
a and b(EN) 
is a sequence 
of adjacent 
edges 
{al, x1}, {x1, x2} ,..., {-cl, 
b}; 
this path 
{a, x1, x2,..., x1-l, 
b} 
is said to have length I (multiple points may occur, as in the case of the 
path { j, f, c, d, e, f, g} of Figure 13). A cycle or circuit is a closed 
path. (For instance, {c,f, g, d, c} in Figure 13.) An Euler circuit 
is a 
circuit 
in which all edges of 9 occur precisely 
once. A Hamiltonian 
circuit isa circuit thatpasses exactly once through every node. (IV) A graph is 
called connected if every two nodes are connected by at least one path. 
(V) A tree is a connected acyclic (= without 
cycles) graph. 
The distance 
between two points in a tree is the number of the edges in the (unique) 
path 
joining 
a with b (no repetitions 
of edges allowed to occur in this path). 
We indicate now a way to draw a tree .Y of N. We choose a node x0 (EN). 
From x0 we trace the edges connecting x,, with the adjacent nodes (those 
who have distance 1 to x0), say xlwl, x1.2, . . . . We arrange these on a 
horizontal line (Figure 14). From these points, we trace the edges that 
connect them with the points situated at distance 2 from x0 (hence ad- 
Jacent to xi,1 and not equal to x0), etc. A tree in which such a special

point x,,, the root, has been chosen, is also called rooted tree. The preceding 
construction proves Figure 14. 
THEOREM 
B. Each tree has at least two endpoints, 
and for na3, 
at least 
two terminal 
edges. 
Another characterization of trees is: 
THEOREM 
C. Any two of the following 
three conditions 
(I), 
(2) and (3) 
imply the third, and moreover, 
imply that the graph 9 over N, 1 N 1 =n is 
a tree: (1) $9’ is connected; (2) 9 is acyclic; (3) 9 has (n- 1) edges. 
R (I), (2)* (3). In other words, by Definition 
B (V), any tree with n 
vertices has n- 1 edges. This is true for n=2. We prove the statement by 
complete induction, and we suppose it to be true for all trees having up 
to (n- 1) edges. In a tree B with n nodes, we cut off one of the terminal 
nodes and its incident edge. The new graph obtained in this way is evi- 
dently a tree, hence it contains (n- 1) nodes, so l?Y’l =n-2 
according to 
the induction hypothesis; hence 191 =n- 
1. 
(l), Pb-(2). 
w e reason by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that there 
exists (N, Y), INI=n, 
Igl=n-I, 
which is connected, and with at least 
one cycle V. We break the cycle V by omitting one edge. Thus we obtain 
a new graph (N, gl), still connected, with 19, I =n -2. We repeat this 
operation until there are no cycles left, so we have a connected acyclic 
graph (N, S,), with n- 1 -i edges, for some i> 1, which contradicts the 
statement that (I), (2) imply (3). 
(2), (3)+(l). 
If not, there exists (N, g), INI=n, 
I+Yl=n-1, 
with two 
nodes a, bEN not connected by a path of 3. If we connect a and b by a 
new edge {a, b}, we obtain a new graph (N, gl), which is still acyclic, 
with I+711 =n. Repeating this procedure, we finally obtain a connected 
acyclic graph (N, S,) with n - 1 + i edges, for some i>, 1, which again 
contradicts that (I), (2) imply (3). n 
Let us now prove the famous Cayley theorem ([Cayley, 18891). 
THEOREM 
D. The number of trees over N, INI =n, equals n*- ‘. 
There are many proofs of this theorem. One kind, of constructive type,

establishes a bijection between the set of trees over [n] and the set [n] [“- ‘I 
of @I - 2)-tuples of [n], (x1, x2,. . ., x,,-~), Xi~[~]. ([Foata, Fuchs, 19701, 
[Neville, 19531, [Priifer, 19181, and, for a generalization to k-trees, [Foata, 
19711. See also p. 71.) Others follow the path of obtaining the various 
enumerations suggested by the problem. ([Clarke, 19581, [Dziobek, 19171,

[Riordan, 
1957a, 1960, 1965, 19661, [RCnyi, 19591.) We give here the 
proof of Moon, which is of the second type. 
THEOREM E. Let T=T(N; 
d,, d,,..., d,) be the set of trees over

[17a] 
T(n;

=(d,-l,d2-1 
,..., d,--1). 
(We use here the notation for the multinomial coefficients introduced in 
[lot’], 
p. 27.) 
It is clear that T(n; d,, d,, . . . )=Oifd,+d,+...#2(n-l),becauseevery 
tree over N has (n- 1) edges (Theorem C., p. 63). We first prove three 
lemmas. 
LEMMA 
A. Let integers bi> 1, iE [s], be given such that cf= 1 bi = m. Then: 
[17b] 
(b, ,..., b,)=k$I(b,,b,

(So, this formula is a generalization 
of the binomial relation 
(6, c)= 
=(b-1, 
c)+(b, 
c-l), 
[se] p. 10.) 
n Let be given a set M, [MI =m. 
The left-hand member of [17b] 
enumerates the set p of divisions 8= (B,, B?, . . ., B,) of 121, where 1 Bil = 
=bi, ic[s] (p. 27). Now we choose an XEM and we put pli={g

then [17b] follows from the fact that:

To finish this section on graphs, we discuss the Hasse diagram of an 
order relation over N. This graph is obtained by joining a and b if and 
only if a<b 
and a<c<b*c=a 
or c=b 
(eb 
covers a). In this case b is 
placed over a. For example, Figure 15 is the Hasse diagram of the order 
relation 4 on N= {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j> defined by a< b, a<d, 
b < c, 
d<e, 
d< f, e d c, f < c, g <i, g d h. If one wants to avoid, in this diagram, 
the difficulty of putting every point on different heights, then one must 
orient the edges; in this case one obtains a transitive 
digraph, as in

Digraphs 
in general 
We call a 2-arrangement (x, y) of N an ordered pair, that is a pair in 
which we distinguish a first element, (x, JJ)E~I~ (N), (see p. 6). 
DEFINITION 
A. A digraph (N, 9) or directed graph (over N) is a pair, is 
such that 9 is a (possibly empty) set of orderedpairs 
from 
N, 58~ 21, (N). 
The elements of N are then called the nodes or vertices of the digraph, and 
the ordered pairs are called the arcs. One often says “digraph 
Q”, rather 
than “digraph 
(N, 9) “, in case the set N is given once and for all. 
Most of the concepts introduced in the previous section have their anal- 
ogue in digraphs. For instance, the outdegree of x (o N), denoted by ad(x) 
is the number of arcs leaving x; the indegree, 
denoted by id(x) is the 
number of arcs entering x. An oriented cycle is a cycle on which the 
orientation 
of the arcs is such that of two consecutive arcs always the 
first one is entering their common node, and the other is leaving it (or 
vice versa). Other definitions are adapted in the same manner. 
THEOREM 
A. Giving 
a digraph 
9 over N is equivalent 
to giving 
an anfi- 
rejexive 
binary relation J on N, J c N ‘, called the incidence relation of 9. 
n Define J by: xJyo(x, 
y)oS3

There is again a plane representation, analogous the one introduced 
on p. 61, but with arrows added. Figure 17 shows a digraph and its 
associated relation. If the relation was not antireflexive, we had to in- 
troduce loops into the digraph. But digraphs with loops permitted and 
relations are the same.

DEFINITION 
B. A tournament (over N) is a digraph 9 such that every pair 
6% Xi> a2 
W) is connected by precisely one arc. If the arc xixj belongs 
to 2, we say that Xi dominates xi. The score si of xi is the number of rdm 
xJ 
that are dominated 
by xi. Usually, the nodes ( EN) 
of 9 
are 
numbered 
in such a way that: 
[18a] 
(OG) 
s,<s,<-.-<s, 
(<n-l). 
The n-tuple (st, s2, . . ., s,)EN” 
is then called the score vector of 9. 
The relation f (the incidence relation on N) associated with 9 is hence 
total, antireflexive and antisymmetric. Figure 18 represents a tournament 
in whichsI=s2=1, 
s3=sq=2.

DEFINITION 
C. A dgraph 
over N is called functional 
if the outdegree of 
every 
node equals 0 or 1 : t1.x~ N, ad(x) f I. 
There exists a bijection between the set NN of maps q of N into itself and 
the set of such digraphs 9. 
III fact, we may associate 9 with q by 
(x,Y)E~-=cp(x)= 
y, y # x. In this case 9 is called the ‘functional digraph 
associated with cp’. Figure 19 corresponds to a q~[[22]r~~~. 
Fig. 19. 
The map ‘p will be a permutation if, moreover, 
for all XE N, id(x)< 
1. 
THEOREM 
C. The relation 
6 on N defined by: x&‘ye-Jp~N, 
3qEN 
such 
that q”(x)= 
cpq(x) is an equivalence 
relation, 
The restriction 
of cp to each 
class of d has for 
associated digraph an oriented cycle, to which (possibly) 
some 
trees are attached. 
Such a digraph 
is sometimes called an ‘excycle’ 
(Weaver). 
The classes of G are the connected components of 9. In the case of 
Figure 19, there are 5 excycles. In this way each map (CENT can be 
decomposed into a product of disjoint excycles, this result being analogous 
to the decomposition of a permutation into cyclic permutations.

other properties of NN see, for example, [Dines, 1966, 19681, [Harary, 
1959b],[Hedrlin, 
1963],[Read, 19611, [Riordan, 1962a],[Schiitzenberger, 
19681. For the ‘probabilistic’ 
aspect see [Katz, 19551, [Purdom, Williams, 
196811.) 
DEFINITION 
D. A map (~E:N~ is called acyclic if each of its excycles is a 
rooted tree. In other words, giving cp is equivalent 
to giving 
a rooted forest 
over N, i.e. a covering 
of N by disjoint rooted trees. 
For instance, the map rp of Figure 19 is not acyclic, but the following is: 
+(i):=i+l 
for ie[21] 
and $(22):=22. 
THEOREM 
D. The number 
of acyclic maps of N into itself, that is, the 
number of rootedforests 
over N, IN 1 =n, equals (n + I)“-I. 
I 
We adjoin a point x to the set N, and we let P:={x)uN; 
IPl=n+ 
1. 
Each tree T over P becomes a rootedforest 
if we chop off the branches 
issuing from x. We call this rooted forest q(T). Its roots are just the nodes 
adjacent to x in T. This map establishes, evidently, a bijection between 
the rooted forests over N and the trees over P, hence by Theorem D 
(the Cayley theorem) (p. 63), JP~~P~-2=(n+l)n-1.

Coding functions

$rst leaf (terminal node x of the digraph, such that idx= 0, odx= 1, with 
the smallest label), we construct a word w1 which is the path joining this 
leaf to llJo, leaf excluded, 
root included, but written from 
root 
to leaf. 
Here the first leaf being 3, we have w1 =x2x8. The same operation applied 
to the second leaf (here 4) with the path joining it to w~)D~ gives a word 
1112 (here x22>. The third leaf (12) would introduce w3 =x6x1 and so on. 
Finally, we define x=x(~):=w~~v~w~w~....

Of course, no leaf is re- 
resented in X, and the first repetition in x ends the cyclic part off. So, 
it could be easily shown that x establishes a bijection between [n][“] 
and 
the set [IZ]* of words with II letters (or n-arrangements, p. 18) on the 
alphabet {x,. x2, . . . . x”}.

EXERCISES 
(As far as possible we follow the order of the sections.) 
1. npoints 
in a plane. Let N be a set of n points or nodes in the plane 
such that no three among them are collinear. Moreover, we suppose that 
each pair among the n 
0 2 straight lines connecting each pair of points is 
intersecting, and also no three among these lines have a point in common 
other than one of the given nodes. Show that these 
0 
2” lines intersect 
each other in 9 n (n - 1) (n-2) 
(n - 3) points different from those in 
N, and that they divide the plane into & (n- 1) (a” -5n’ + 18n- 8) 
(connected) regions, including n (a - 1) unbounded regions. 
*2. Parfilions 
by lines, pIatzes, hyperplanes. 
(1) Let be given n lines in the 
plane, each two of them having a point in common but no three of them 
having a point in common. These lines divide the plane into f (n” -t n f 2) 
regions. [Hint: 
Show that the number a,, which is asked satisfies the 
relation a n =a,,-, +n, al =2.]

be the number of regions with k sides in 9. Clearly, x:=2

It is anopenproblem

(For more information 
about this problem see PGriinbaum, 
19671, pp. 390-410, and C*Griinbaum, 19721.) 
3. Circles. 
tt circles divide the plane into at most n2 -tz+2 
regions. The 
I1 
0 3 circles that are the circumscribed circles of all triangles whose vertices 
lie in a given set N of n points (in general position) in the plane, intersect 
each other in a2 (tz)5 (2n- 1) points different from those of N. 
4. SI~heres. n spheres divide the 3-dimensional 
space into at most 
II (122 - 312 + 8)/3 regions; n great circles divide the surface of a sphere into 
at most n2 - tz + 2 regions. More generally, n hyperspheres divide Rk into 
at most (“i, 
l)+xFZO(:‘> 
regions. 
5. Convex polyhedra. 
F, V, E stand for the number of faces, vertices and 
edges of a convex polyhedron. To show the famous Euler formula F-i- V= 
= E+ 2 [Hint: 
For any open polyhedral surface the formula F+ V= Et- 1 
can be shown to hold by induction on the number of faces] ([*Gri.inbaum, 
lY67] gives a thorough treatment of polytopes in arbitrary dimension d, 
with an abundance of bibliography 
and of open problems. See also 
[“Klee, 19661.) 
6. Inscribed 
and escribed spheres of a tetrahedron. 
Let be given a tetra- 
hedron T, and let A,, A,, A3, A, be the areas of its four faces. To show 
that the number of spheres which are tangent to all four planes that 
contain the faces of- I’ (inscribed and escribed) is equal to 8-s, where s

8. Some enumeration problems related to convex polygons. Let A,, A,, . . . , 
A, be the n vertices of a convex polygon P in the plane. We call diagonal 
of P, any segment A,A, which is not a side of P. We suppose that any 
three diagonals have no common point, except a vertex. (I) Show that 
the diagonals intersect each other in n 
0 4 interior points of the polygon, 
and in & n(n-3) 
(n-4) 
(n-5) 
ex erior points. (2) The sides and the 
t 
diagonals divide the interior of P into ii (12 - 1) (n -2) (tz2 -3n -t 12) 
convex regions (in the case of Figure 20, we have 11 such regions), 
and the whole plane into 1Q(n4--6n3+23n2-26n+8) 
regions. 
(3) The number d. of ways to cut up the polygon P into (n-2) 
triangles 
by means of n-3 nonintersecting diagonals (triangulations 
of P) equals 
(n- l)-l(~;‘>, 
_ 
the Catalan number a,,-, of p. 53; so, this number is 
that of well-bracketed words with (n- 1) letters. (The heavy lines in 
Figure 20 give an example of such a triangulation.) 
[Hint: 
Choose a 
fixed side, say A,A,; 
from each triangulation, 
remove the triangle with 
A,A, as side; then two triangulated polygons are left; hence d, =d2dnG1 + 
+dJdn-2+..p+dn-ld2; 
then check the formula, or use [ISc] of p. 53.1

Finally, there are n2”- ’ triangulations

with a- 1 diagonals that do not intersect in the interior of the polygon 
([Prouhet, 18663). (5) Th ere are 6]! (n)s (n 3 + 1 8n2 + 43n + 60) triangles in 
the interior of P such that every side is side or diagonal of P. (6) Suppose 
n even. The number of graphs with n/2 edges that intersect each other 
outside of the polygon, equals (n + l)-’

corresponding to n=6 are pictured). (See [*Yaglom, 
19641 I, p. 14.) (7) 
The number of broken open lines without self-intersections (= the number 
of piecewise linear homeomorphic images of the segment [0, l] contained 
in the union of P with its diagonals) whose vertices are vertices of P, 
equals 112~~‘. (In Figure 20, BCAED 
is an example of such a line.)

This

can be refined 
as follows. 
We put, for

M(d):

Clearly, 
O<y(M)<m, 
and y(M)= 
m if the a, are not relatively 
prime, y(M)= 
1 
if each two among a, are relatively

= 0 if the Ui equal 1. 
Show then that the number

CHAPTER11 
PARTITIONS 
OF INTEGERS 
The concept of partition of integers belongs to number theory as well as 
to combinatorial 
analysis. This theory was established at the end of the 
18-th century by Euler. (A detailed account of the results up to ca. 1900 
is found in [*Dickson, II, 19193, pp. 101-64.) Its importance was enhanced 
by [Hardy, Ramanujan, 19181 and [Rademacher, 1937a, b, 1938, 1940, 
19431 giving rise to generalizations, which have not been exhausted 
yet. We will treat here only a few elementary (combinatorial 
and alge- 
braical ) aspects. For further reading we refer to [*Hardy, Wright, 19651, 
[*MacMahon, 
1915-161, [Andrews, 
1970, 1972b], [*Andrews, 
19711, 
[Gupta, 
19701, [Sylvester, 
1884, 
18861 (or Collected 
Mathematical 
Papers, Vol. 4, l-83), and, for the beautiful asymptotic problems, to 
[*Ayoub, 
19631 and [*Ostmann, 19561. We use mostly the notations of 
the tables of PGupta, 
19621, which are the most extensive ones on this 
matter. 
2.1. DEFINITIONS 
OF PARTITIONS 
OF AN INTEGER 
II 
DEFINITION 
A. Let n be an integer >, 1. A partition 
of n is a representation 
of n as a sum of integers > 1, not considering the order of terms of this 
sum. These terms are called summands, or parts, of the partition. 
We list all partitions of the integers 1 through 5: 1; 2 = 1 + 1; 3 =2 -!- 1 = 
=1+1-t-l; 
4=3+1=2+2=2+1+1=1+1+1+1; 
5=4+1=3-i-2= 
=3+1+1=2+2-t-1=2+1+1+1=1+1+1+1+1. 
It is important to distinguish clearly between a partition 
of a set (p. 30) 
and a partition of an integer. But in the first case as well as in the second 
case, the order of the blocks and the order of the summands respectively does 
not play a role, and no block is empty, just like no summand equals zero. 
L&p(n) 
be the number of partitions of n, and let P(n, m) be the number 
of partitions of n into m summands. Thus, by the preceding list, p (1) = 1, 
p(2)=2, 
p(3)=3, 
p(4)=& 
p(5)=7 
and P(5, l)=P(5,4)= 
P(5,5)= 
I,

P(5, 2)=P(5, 
3)=2. 
Clearly, p(~?)=r~=, 
P(n, m) and, since the order 
of the summands does not matter, we have: 
DEFINITION 
B. Each partition 
of II into m summands can be considered as 
a solution with integers yi> 1, irz[m], 
(the summands of the partition) 
of: 
With such a partition, 
we can associate a minimal increasing path (in 
the sense of p. 20) starting from W(0, 1), with m horizontal 
steps and 
with area contained under its graph equal to n. Figure 24’ clarifies this 
idea for the partition 1 -I- 3 + 3 + 5 of 12. But the interpretation 
related to 
Ferrers diagram (p. 100) will turn out to be more rewarding.

If the partition 
has m summands, 
we must add to [lb] 
the following 
condition: 
i?cl 
x1 +x2 +-e.+ x, = m 
(alsodenotedbyx,

corresponding partition “the partition with specification i;’ iy . . .“, omit- 
ting the exponents x, which equal 1. Written in this way, the partitions of 5 
become 5, 14,23, 1’3, 12’, 132, 1’. 
We write p(n, m) for the number of partitions of M with at nlost m 
summands, or also ‘distribution 
function’ of the number of partitions of 
n with respect to the number of summands, p (n, m) =cr= 1 P(II, k), 
P(n, 
m)=p(n, 
m)-p(n,

tion function will be noted.)

n p (n, m) is the number of solutions of [ 1 b] that satisfy x1 +x2 f *.* < nz

tions of [lb] 
that also satisfy x1 +x2 + .+a <m - 1; there are p (11, in -

of these; then the solutions of [I b] which also satisfy x1 +x,-k ..* =nz; 
these are just the solutions of x2+2x3 + ... = n - m and x2 +x3 + ..* <m 
(since x120); 
hence there are p(n-m, 
m) of these. n 
The following table shows the first values of p (n, m) (boldface printed:

that the number of summands has the property PI, and the value of 
each summand has the property 8, ; we indicate by a star * the absence 
of a condition (notations from [*Ayoub,

partitions 
of n, that satisfy B, and B, in the sense above, and whose

summandszI, z~,..., which is called the conjugate partition of the partition 
with summands y, , y2, . . . . In the case of the figure shown, the conjugate 
partition 
is 6+5+3+3+3+ 
I. 
Certain 
properties 
of a partition 
Yl+Yz+**- 
have an immediate translation into terms of the conjugate 
partition. Thus we have: 
THEOREM 
A. The number of partitions 
of n into at most (or exactly) 
m 
summands is equal to the number of partitions 
of n into summands that are 
all 4 m (or whose maximum 
is m), in other words, the number of parlit ions 
of n f m whose maximum 
summand equals m. 
THEOREM 
B. The number 
of partitions 
of n into unequal 
odd strmrnonds 
equals the number of ‘self-conjugate’ 
partitions 
of n (that 
is, whose dia- 
gram 
is symmetric with respect to the line x = y) .

Theorem A is evident. For Theorem B, we associate with

whose diagram is obtained by ‘folding’ the rows of the original diagram

and fitting them then one by one, beginning with the largest, into each

type technique to various other problems.) 
II Let qo=qo(n) 
(or q, =ql 
(I?)) be the set of Ferrers diagrams of the 
partitions of 12 into an even (or odd) number of unequal summands. For 
each diagram D (Figure 27a) we denote the ‘northernmost’ 
horizontal 
line of D by n=lr(D) 
(quite possibly In\ = 1); we denote by e=e(D) 
the ‘easternmost’ line that makes an angle of 45” with the horizontal 
direction ((el2 1). Now we define D’=‘p(D) 
as the diagram which is 
obtained by sliding it down to the east, if /itI < lel (Figure 27a) or by 
transporting e to the north, if InI> le( (Figure 27b). This transformation 
(p is defined in q,uq,, 
except if jrtnel= 
I, with 
litI= 
lel (Figure 28a) 
or with Iit1 = lel+ I (Figure 28b). Let a, and b, (or a, and b,) be the 
set of DEAL 
(or qI) corresponding to the case of Figures 28a and b.

with k: = lel = the number of summands of D. 
Hence (zO, b,, ul, b1 equal 0 except a, (or a,) = 1, if n = (3k2 - k)/2 and 
k even (or odd), and 6, (or b,) = 1, if n = (3k2 + k)/2 and k even (or odd). 
This implies [4a] if we substitute these values into [4b]. 
H 
The concept of a Ferrers diagram can be generalized easily to higher 
dimensions. We call a d-dimensional partition of n, for d>2, 
any set F 
containing n points with integer coordinates > 1 in the euclidean space 
Rd that satisfies the condition 
that (a,, a,, . . ., ~,)EF 
implies that all 
points (x1, x2, . . . . xd), where 1 <xi <a, with iE[d], 
also belong to F. 
tit p,, (PI) be the number of these sets F. Clearly p2 (n) =p (n). A beautiful 
result of MacMahon 
states ([I*MacMahon,

but the proof is very difficult ([Chaundy,

GF for d84 
is known. ([Atkin, 
Bratley, Macdonald, 
Mackay, 
19671. 
See also [Gordon, Houten, 19681, [*Stanley, 19721, [Stanley, 1971a, b], 
[Wright, 1965a].) 
2.5. SPECIALIDENTITIES;'FORMAL~ 
AND 
‘COMBINATORIAL'PROOFS 
First we prove two typical identities, which may serve as sample of many 
others. 
THEOREM 
A. The formal 
series introduced 
in [2a, c] (p. 97) also satisjy:

In the literature, often 1= q and u = x (in honour of the elliptic functions); 
hence the name of ‘q-identity’, 
often given to this kind of identity. (See 
also Exercise 11, p. 118). 
n Formal 
proof 
(also called ‘algebraic’ proof). We expand @((t, U) in 
to a formal series in U: 
C5cl 
@(t,u)= 
1 cmum, cm = Cm(t). 
l?I30 
The evident 
functional 
relation 
@(t, tu)= (I- 
tu)@((t, u), which 
is 
satisfied by @(t, u)=II,~~(I 
--ut ‘)-‘,gives, 
when [5c]issubstitutedintoit:

hence:

c,-, = __.___. 
f-,- 
cnv2 =.., 
(1 - t”) (1 - t” ‘) 
” 
= (1 - t”) (1 - P-1; . . . (1 - t2) (1 - t)’ 
which, by [SC], proves [Sb]. By putting u= 1 we get [5a]. 
Combinatorial 
proof. As an example we prove [5a]. By [3j] (p. 99), 
the coefficient of tk in {(l-t) 
(1-t2)e..(l-tr)-’ 
equals p(k 1 *,<Z), 
which is the number of partitions of k into summands smaller or equal to 
1, here denoted by s(k, I). Hence, for proving [5a], we just have to 
verify that the coefficients oft” 
on both sides are equal; this means that 
we must prove that: 
WI 
p(n)=s(n-l,l)+s(n-2,2)+*... 
By Theorem A (p. 98) s(k, I) equals the number P(k+l, 
1) of partitions 
of k+Z whose largest summand equals 1. So [Sf] is equivalent to p (II)= 
=i(n, 
l)+F(n, 
2)+... 
and this last equality follows from the division of 
the set ofpartitions 
of n according to the value of the largest summand. 
n 
THEOREM 
B. (Sometimes called ‘pentagonal 
theorem’ of Euler). We have 
the following 
identity 
[Sg] 
between 
formal 
series and the recurrence 
relation 
[5h] between the p(n):

and thus [5g (*)I f o II ows from [4a]. For [Sh], 
substitute [5g] into [Si] 
(which is equivalent to [2a], p. 97): 
and by observing that the coekient 
of t” (na 1) of the left-hand member 
equals 0, we obtain the result. n 
THEOREM

equals the number of partitions 
of II-

[5j] 
Q (II, m) - p (n - (“~ 2’ ‘> , m) 
II 
Formal 
proof. 
This is carried out by a method analogous to tile 
method used in the formal demonstration 
of Theorem A (p. 103), but 
this time the functional relation Y (t, u)= (1 + tu) Y (t, tu) is used. We get: 
[=I 
Y (t, II) = 1 + 1 $‘,. Q (n, 111) 
~“d” = ipl (1 -i- Ut’) = 
. . 
I 
J: 
‘1

(1 - t) (1 - t2).- (1 - t”)’ 
Hence, Q (n, m) equals the coefficient of tn-(“il) 
in ((1 -t) 
(1 -t ‘)*.* 
. ..(I -t”)}-1, 
hence equal to p (n - 
( * GM), because of [3j] p. 99, 
A (p. 100). 

106 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
Combinatorial 
proof. The number of solutions of 
is evidently 
equal to Q(n, m). We put zr : =yi -yZ - 1, . . ., z,-I : =

-Ym -1, 
z,:=y,-1. 
Hence 
y,= 1 +z,, 
ym-r =2+2,-i 
+ 
+z,,..., 
y, =m + zr + z2 + .a. + z,. Then equation [Sl] is equivalent to :

Now, the number of solutions of [5m] is clearly equal to the number of

by Theorem A (p. 100).

Both sides of [5n] have a generalized formal series in u, with positive and 
negative exponents: the theory of such series is easily developed, as on 
p. 43. We give here the ‘formal’ proof of [Andrews, 
19651. A beautiful 
‘combinatorial’ 
proof is found in [Wright, 1965b]. See also [*Hermite], 
Oeuvres, Vol. II, pp. 155-56, and [Stolarsky, 19691.)

The natural setting for identities such as [5n] is actually the theory of

among others, [Alder, 19691, [Andrews, 1970, 1972b], and [*Bellman, 
19611.) We mention here, pro memori, the famous Rogers-Ramanujan

2.6. PARTITIONSWITHFORBIDDENSUMMANDS;DENUMERANTS 
Now we consider 
partitions 
of n whose summands 
are taken (repetitions 
allowed) 
from 
a sequence of integers (aj:=(a,, 
a2,...), 
1 <a, <a,<.... 
As in Theorem 
A (p. 95), giving 
such a partition 
is equivalent 
to giving 
a solution 
of 
Bl 
alxl 
+ a2x2 + a3x3 + ..a = n, 
Xi integer 2 0. 
In other words, 
the matrix 
‘?I= [[a*, j]l (p. 98) is such that ei, j= 1 for 
icz(a), for all j>O, 
and CQ, j=O 
otherwise, 
except that CQ~= 1. From 
Theorem 
B (p. 98) (or by direct 
computation) 
it follows 
immediately 
that: 
THEOREM

generating 
function

the

D (n; (a))=

of n lvith 
respect to the sequence (a), equals: 
WI 
B(,)(t) 
:= 1 + .F1 D(n; 
(a)) t” = *PI (1 - f”)-l. 
/ 
For (a)={l,2, 
3 ,... }, we find back [2a] of p. 97. 
For example, in the money changing problem, 
one has as many coins of 
5,10,20 
and 50 centimes as one needs. In how many ways can one make 
with these a given amount of, say, 5 francs? (1 franc= 
100 centimes). This 
is equivalent 
to finding 
the number 
of integer solutions 
of 5x, + 10x2 + 
+20x3 + 50x, = 500, or equivalently, 
of x1 + 2x, +4x, + 10x, = 100. The 
solution 
is hence D(100; 
1, 2, 4, lo), which is 2691 (see p. 113). 
Another 
example: 
it is immediately 
clear, by [5b] p. 103 and [6b] that 
C6b’l 
D (n; 1, 2, 3, . . . k)=P(n+k,k)=Q(n+k(k+1)/2,k). 
We investigate 
the case of a fit&e 
sequence 
(a): = (a, a,, . .., a,), 
PARTITIONS 
OF INTEGERS 
109 
I <a,<a,< 
. ..<a.(~a,=O, 
if l>k). 
The GF [6b] 
is then a rational 
fraction: 
[6b”] 
Q,(t) 
= 1 + c D (n; (a)) t” = fi 
(1 - P-l. 
n>l 
i=l 
A first method 
for computing 
the denumerant 
D(n;(ajj 
is provided 
by a decomposition 
of the rational fraction 
[6b”] 
into partial fractions. 
For instance: 
which gives as coelticient 
of t”: 
[6cl 
D(n;1,2)=+{2n+3+(--1)“). 
Similarly, 
for 
~,,,2,3,(tj={(l--f)(l--t2)(1-~3j}-1 
we 
have 
two 
decompositions. 
(The first one, called the first 
type, is a decomposition 
into ordinary 
partial 
fractions; 
the second one is called the second type 
or HerscheNian 
type. See [Herschel, 
18 181.)

the

by (d,, d,, . . . . dTMl j per T, (per

For each x(ER) such that (x-3) 
is not integer, we put: 
Ff1

By [SC] we find:

D(n;1,2)=

A similar formula using 11. . . 11 for D (n; 1,2,3) 
can be found as it 
follows. We transform [se’] by grouping first the two cr’s, then replacing 
(n+l) 
(n+5) by (n+3)2-4: 
D (n; 1,2, 3) = & ((rr + 1) (rr + 5) + (7,0, 3,4, 3,0) cr6,} 
=&{(n+3)2+(3,-4,-1,0,-1,-4)cr6,}. 
Now, 4+):=&(3,

satisfies lrp(n)l<&=+<+. 
Hence, 
[W] 
D (n; 1,2,3) = Ili%n + 3)‘ll. 
This way of writing by means of (1 ..a II is not unique. In the same way one

where eO=I, er#ej for i#j,

Necessarily, n 1, n 2 . . . <k, because every root of taJ- 1 =0 is simple, so 
a multiple root of order s of P(t)=0 
must come from s different factors 
(1 -faJr), IE[s], wheres,<k. Now wedecompose therationalfraction

For example, to calculate D (n; 1,2,4): = D(n)

It is then verified that:

D (n; 1,2,4) = ll{(n + 2) (n + 5) + (- 1)” n}/1611. 
We now show, by two examples, an eflcbzt 
practical use of Theorem 
B, without 
decomposition of rational 
fractions into partial fractions, 
which works particularly well if the LCM A of (a,, CI~, a3, . . .) is not large. 
We abbreviate x,, = (1 - th)-’ 
and we use a point (for saving place) to 
denote the center of symmetry of any reciprocal polynomial. (Examples: 
1+t+t2+...= 
1+t+t2+t3+ts, 
1+2tf...=1+2t+2tZ+t3). 
(I) We return to D(n; 1,2, 3) [6d] (p. 109). We have

=(I 
+t+2tZ+3t3+4t4+5t5+4fj+5t’+...)C 
Hence, identifying 
the coefficients in the first and last member, we get: 
D(6m+B;

whose k vertices

let Sp 
be a polyhedral

each face may or may not belong

[Hint: 
First treat the case of a simplex.] For example, if 9 is the open 
polygon 
in RZ whose vertices are A, =(O, 0), Az(l, 0), A, = (4, +), 
A4=(0, 
l), 
we have (~r=a~=u~=l, 
a3=6. 
Hence ~n~OZ(n)t”= 
=P(t) 
(1-t)-3(1-t6)-1, 
degP<8. 
(2) The rational fraction 9(t) 
can 
be simplified so that the exponent of the factor (1 - r ) in the denominator 
is <d+ 1. For theprecedingexample 
we then get 9(t)=P, 
(t) (1 -t)-’

can be determined by Z(O), Z(l), Z(2), . . . . Z(7)= 
=l, 0, 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 13, 18, respectively, 
which we obtain 
by direct 
inspection. Hence P1(t)=l-2t+t2+t3+t4+t5-f6+3t7. 
From this, 
it follows that Z(n)= Iln(Sn- 14)/1211+ 1. [Hint:

order of Z(n) when Al+ co.] (3) Use the preceding to prove the following

tableaux. 
Each Ferrers 
diagram 
representing 
a certain 
partition 
of II can be considered 
in the obvious 
way as a ‘descending 
wall’ 
M, or ‘profile’. 
Figure 
29 represents 
the wall associated 
with the 
diagram 
of Figure 25 (p. 100). The ‘stone’ (i,j) 
is the one with ‘abscissa’ 
i and ‘ordinate’ 
j. We are interested 
in the number 
v(M) 
of different 
ways in which 
M can be built 
up by piling 
stones one by one on top 
of each other, in such a way that at every stage the already 
constructed 
part is a ‘descending 
wall’. Figure 
30 gives a permissible 
numbering 
of 
the stones, thereby 
defining 
a so-called 
‘standard’ 
tableau, 
also called 
Young tableau. 
For a given 
wall M we write 
on each stone (i,j) 
the 
number 
of stones situated 
above 
and to the right 
of it, itself included. 
The table of numbers 
z(i, j), 
obtained 
in this way, is represented 
in 
Figure 
31. Hence 
the number 
of 
standard 
tableaux 
v(M), 
equals

generalization to the case that part of the wall, say M’, already exists, 
that is, it will be incorporated into M. See also [*Berge, 19681, pp. 49-59. 
We remark that the generalization to higher dimensions, in the sense of 
p. 103, is still an open problem.) 
27. Perfect partitions. A perfect partition of an integer n > 1, is one that 
‘contains’ precisely one partition 
of each integer less than II. In other 
words, if we consider the partition as a solution of xi +2x, + ... = II, we 
call it perfect if for each integer i<n there exists a single solution of 
t,+2t,+--= 
I, where 0~ ti <xI, i= 1, 2,. . . . So a perfect partition 
rep- 
resents a set of weights such that each weight of I grams, 1 <I< n, can 
be realized in exactly one way. 
Show that the number of perfect partitions of n equals the number of 
ordered factorisations 
of n+ 1, omitting unit factors. Thus, for n = 7, 
we have 8 =4.2=2.4=2.2.2, 
hence there are 4 perfect partitions, 
l’, 
134, 123, 124. 
28. Sums of multinomial coeficients. Let us write A(n) for the sum 
of the multinomial 
coefficients which occur in the expansion 
of 
x,+x,+-*+x,)“. 
For 
example since (xi +x2 + ... + ,Y,,,)~ =C x: -t 
+~~x,x~+~~X~X~X, 
(see p. 29) we have A(3)=1+3+6=10.

EXPANSIONS 
This chapter is basically devoted to various results on formal series. The 
relation with counting problems is clear: for a sequence of integers with 
combinatorial 
meaning, the existence of a ‘simple’ formula is most 
frequently equivalent with the existence of a ‘simple’ generating function.

because if not, then both members of [la] equal zero. We number the 
elements of M 
and iV, M:= 
{x1 x2, . . . . x,}, N:= 
{yl, y,, . . . . y,}. 
If 
‘3 =M x iV, then the first member of [la] 
can be written as ny= i 
C;= 1 u(xi, vi)+ This is a product of m sums: The choice of a term 
in each of the m factors gives one term of the expansion, and two different 
choices give rise to two differently written terms. Now, any such choice is 
just a map cp from M into N; hence [la]. 
If ‘%#MxN, 
then u(x,y) 
can be extended to the whole of M x IV by defining u (x, y): =0 for 
(x, y)$ ‘3. Then we can apply the preceding result, observing that the cp 
whose graph is not contained in ‘3 give a contribution 
zero to the second 
member of [la]. 
n 
Using [la], 
the binomial and multinomial 
identities can easily be 
recovered. 
We now show a deep generalization of the binomial identity. 
THEOREM 
B. (Abel 
identity 
[Abel, 
18261). For a21 x, y, z WC have: 
[lb] 
(x + y)” = j0 
(;) 
x (x - k~)~-’ (y + /?z)“-~. 
(In a commutative ring, for instance. But [ 1 b] also can be considered as an 
identity in the ring of polynomials in three indeterminates x, y, z.) For 
z=O we recover the binomial identity [6a] (p. 12). 
n First proof (Lucas). We introduce the Abel polynomials 
PC1 
~~(x,z):=x(x-kz)~-~/k! 
for 
k>l, 
a,:=l. 
We have, successively, 
& ak (x, z) = {(x - kz)k-l 
+ (k - 1) x(x - kz)k-2}/k 
-1 = 
=akml(x-z,z) 
2 
~~~k(X,Z)=~~““-‘(x-z,z)=ak-2(X-2z,z) 
Cldl 
g- jak(x, z)=ak-j(x-jz, 
z). 
Now, for fixed z, the ak (x, z) form a basis of the set of polynomials in x, 
because their degree equals k (=O, 1, 2, . . .). Hence, every polynomial 
P (x) can be uniquely expressed in the formP (x) = &a0 +&a, + /Z,a, + ..., 
where the lj only depend on z. Now, with [Id] for (*): 
p”‘(x)=~~p(,)=CIk~~akX~j+Ij+,a,(x-~z,z)+.” 
k 
which gives 1 j= P(j) ( jz), by putting x=jz. 
So finally, for every poly- 
nomial P (x) we have: 
[lel 
p

= 
kFo 
ak 
(X, 
Z) 
pck’

, 
/ 
from which [I b] follows by putting P (x)=(x 
+ y)“. 
n 
We still observe that if we apply [le] to P (x)=a, (x+y, z), then we 
get the convolution

19681, p. 18-27, [Robertson, 19621, and [Sal@ 19511, who gives a large 
bibliography. 
n Second proof 
(Francon). 
All the notions of p. 71 concerning the 
Foata coding of [n][“’ 
will be supposed known. Let EC [n+2][“+‘] 
be 
the set of functions 
of [n+2]:={1,2,...,n,n+l,n+2} 
such that 
elements (n+ 1) and (n+2) 
arefixedpoints. 
So, T-E=tn+ltn+2(~;_f: 
ti)“. 
Now, consider for any set xc [n] the set E (x) c E of functions whose 
excycle containing the element (n + 1) has A, : =x + {n + l} as set of nodes. 
Obviously, the factorization 
E(x)=E,E, 
holds, where E, is the set of 
acyclic functions acting on A, with the root (n+ 1) only, and E, is the 
set of functions acting on [n + 2]\A, 
and having the element (jr+ 2) as a 
fixed point. 
Then 
.9- E(x)=~~l.~-E*=t,2+1(fn+l+Ciex 
ti)‘W’-‘.t,+2.(tn+2+Cifx

But we have the division E=x,,,,, 
E(x). Therefore, .YE=~xcrnl 
YEo+. 
In other words, after cancelling tn+ltn+2:

Of course, considering more than 2 fixed points, or other sets of func- 
tions, would give interesting other results (see Exercise 20, p. 163). 
The following is an equivalent formulation 
of the Abel identity [lb], 
which generalizes [ le].

such that: 
We want to express g. as a function

The simplest method

where F, G are matrices 
consisting 
of a single (infinite) 
column, 
and P

So, P-r is the same as P, except that signs - appear in a chessboard 
pattern. (Because P is triangular, [Gd] also holds, if the matrices are 
cut off at the n-th line, and thus turned into finite matrices.) Finally, if 
we take into account that G=P-‘F:

We now show that the matrix s:= [~(n, Ac)~J”,~~~ consisting of the 
Stirling numbers of the first kind, is the inverse of the matrix S:=

kTO 
of the Stirling numbers of the second kind; this means, 
like in the preceding case of the binomial coefficients:

Now, using [14s] (p. 51) for (*), and using the notation:

denoted byf(“), 
and defined as follows: 
PaI 
f(l> =f, 
fC2) zz fOf , **+, f’“> 
= fOf@‘). 
We now want to define the iterate (analytical or fractionary) 
of order a 
off, also denoted by f Ca), for any a from the field of the coefficients off; 
in the case we consider, this will be the field of the complex numbers 
(this constitutes no serious loss of generality). In this section every formal 
series f is supposed to be of the form: 
I31 
f = “Ix1 WY9 
where Q,, L?,, . . . is a reference sequence, given once and for all, 52, = 1, 
L?, # 0 (p. 44); in this way we treat at the same time the case of ‘ordinary’ 
coeflicients of f (-On= 
I), 
and the case of ‘Taylor 
coefficients 
(-s-R,= l/n!). 
With every series j we associate the infinite lower iteration

Thus, the matrix of the binomial coefficients is the iteration matrix for 
f=t(l-t)-‘$,=I, 
and the matrix of the Stirling numbers of the second 
kind S(n, k) is the iteration matrix forj=e’- 
1, IR,=l/n!. 
THEOREM A. For thee 
sequences f, g, h 
(written 
as in [7b]) 
h=f 
ag is 
equivalent 
to the matrix 
equality: 
r?l 
B(k) = B(g).B(f). 
([Jabotinski, 
1947, 1949, 19631. If we transpose the matrices, we get 
h= fogo’B(h)=‘B(

.‘.’ 
from which [7e] follows if we collect the coefficient of O,t” at both ‘ends’ 
of [7f]. 
n 
If we consider in [7e] the first column of B(h) only, we obtain again 
the formula of Faa di Bruno ([4i] p. 139), if we take 52, = l/n!. More 
generally, if we have a seriesf<,>,fC,>, . . . . f<,+ then [7e] gives the matrix 
equal 
B ( fca> ~~..0f~2)0f~l))=B(f(l)) 
B(fc2))...B(fc,)). 
In 
other 
words, if we consider again the first column only, we obtain a generalized 
Faa di Bruno formula for the n-th derivative of the composite of a 
functions (again, we must take Q, = l/n!). Similarly, B (f ‘“‘) = (B (f ))’ 
for all integers a> 1, which leads to an explicit formula for integral order 
iterates ([Tambs, 19271). 
Now we suppose that the coefficient of t in f equals 1, fi = 1; shortwise, 
we say that f is unitary. Furthermore, we assign values to B”= (B (f ))“, 
a complex, in the following 
way: denoting the unit matrix by I, and 
putting A?:=B-I 
(which is B with all l’s on the diagonal erased), we 
define : 
In other words, between the coefficients of B”, denoted by BJ,“i (n is the 
row number and k is the column number), and the coefficients of gj, 
denoted by [@In, k, the following relation holds :

Remark. 
The correspondence 
between a formal 
series and its iteration 
matrix 
was already used when we inverted 
the Stirling 
matrix 
S (p. 144): 
we took the inverse function 
off 
(t):=e’- 
1, whose iteration 
matrix 
was 
S (with respect to Q,= l/n!) 
Applications 
(I) 
The most classical example 
is undoubtedly 
that of computing 
the 
coefficients 
of the inverse 
function 
f (-I) 
(t) for the case f(t) 
= te-‘. 
By 
[Sb] (p. 148), k = 1, we get: 
Hence f <“)(t)=~nrl

(See also Exercise 
18, p. 163.) 
(II) 
For 
given 
fixed 
complex 
z, what 
is the ‘value’ 
of the series 
F(t): =CnrO 
ri) 
t”? Since 
F(t)= 
c 
t”C,“(l 
-I- ,y, 
II>0 
we can apply [8d] with f (t): = t (1 + f)-’ 
and Y(t) = 1. After 
simplifica- 
tions, we obtain 
F(t)=(l+u) 
{l-(z-l)u}-I, 
where 
u:=f 
<-l)(t) 
is 
the reciprocal 
off 
(t). (F or z= 2 we find back (1) of Exercise 22, p. 8 1.) 
(III) 
Calculate the n-th derivative 
of an implicit function. 
We consider 
a 
Taylor 
formal 
expansion in two variables: 
f (x, y) = c,,, n f,,, .x”‘y”/(m!n!), 
where 
fo,o=O, 
fo,I#O. 
Therefore, 
f (x,y)=xn,l 
(~“(x)y”/n!, 
with 
‘p.(x)=C,,, 
f,,.x”/m!. 
We want to find a form’al series~=C+~ 
y,x”/n! 
such that f (x, y)=O 
(the problem 
of ‘implicit 
functions’). 
For that, we 
solve Ens, qo,y”/n! = - ‘pO by the Lagrange 
formula, 
where the variable 
is 
-qo, 
the unknown 
function 
is y, all the cpl, q2, (p3, _.. being temporarily 
considered 
as constants, and collect afterwards 
the terms in Y/n! 
in the 
expression 
of y just found, 
where 
cpo=‘po (x), ‘pl =‘pI (x), etc. Putting

Solve the equation

SUMMATION 
ITORMULAS 
Now we want, in the simplest cases, to express a sum A: =I:= 
1 a(k) 
by 
means of an explicit 
(or closed) formula, 
called a summation 
formula, 
that is an expression 
in which 
the summation 
sign c does not occur 
anymore 
(neither 
little dots!). 
Example 
1. Slzo,~ that A:=~~=, 
t 
=2”. 
In fact, A=(l+l)“, 
be- 
cause of the binomial 
formula.

Example 2. Compute

(See Exercise 38, p. 90.) More 
generally, 
we have the convolution 
identity of Vandermonde: 
[9a] 
?($(;I?$=($, 
k,mGn, 
which follows from p. 26 or [13c] on p. 44, or also, as before, from: 
0 i = C&l

+ t)” (1 + t).-,. 
In other cases, A= A(n) =s= 
1 p(k) and a summation formula ex- 
presses now that A=z;“,, 
b(l), 
where b(Z) is another sequence. If 
m <II, we save making additions in this way. More generally, a summation 
formula is an equality between two expressions, one of which contains 
one or more summations. A summation formula is interesting if it 
establishes a connection between expressions which are built up from 
known or tabulated expressions. 
Example 4. Use the Bernoulli polynomials ([14a], p. 48), to compute 
for each integer r 20: 
Pbl 
Z=Z(n,r):= 
C 
k’= 
1’+2’+...+n’. 
tq<n 
For this we consider the formal series: 
f.(f):=rFO{Z(n,r)t’+l/r!}.

We get, by [14a] (p. 48), for (*):

A,) of p subsets of a set N, whose mutual relations are some- 
how known, compute the cardinal of each subset of N that can be formed 
by taking intersections and unions of the given subsets or their comple-

In the sequel, we will denote the intersection of A and B by AB as 
welI as by An B, similarly the complement of A by A of CA. Each 
subset of [p]:={l,

4.2. THE 
'PROBLBME 
DES RENCONTRES' 
DEFINITION. 
A permutation 
(De$nition 
B, p. 7) c of N, INI =n, is called 
a derangement, 
if it does not have a fixed 
point, 
or rencontre, 
or co- 
incidence, 
in the sense that for all XE N, o(x) # x. 
For example, the permutation 
crl : = 
abcde 
( 
> 
cedab 
does not have a coincidence, 
while 
ts2:= 
abcde 
( 
> 
dbace 
has 2. The 
famous 
‘probleme 
des rencontres’ 
([*Montmort, 
1708)) consists of computing 
the number 
d(n) of derange- 
ments of N, n=INI. 
THEOREM 
A. ‘The number d(n) of derangements 
of N, n = IN 1, equals:

d(n) 
= IIn! e-‘II 
(Because of [2a], 
Chrystal 
has suggested the name n antifactorial 
for 
d(n), and the notation 
nl). 
n If we identify 
N with 
[n] : = { 1, 2, . . . . n}, we denote 
the set of per- 
mutations 
of [fr] by S[In], 
and the subset of 6 [n] consisting 
of per- 
mutations 
g such that a(i)=& 
ie[n], 
by Gi=G,[n], 
and the set of 
derangements 
of [n] by 33 [n]. Clearly 
6 [n] = 3 [n] + lJy= 1 6i. Hence, 
by Theorem 
B (p. 7) for (*): 
Pbl 
n!‘z’lG[n]l 
=d(n)f 
I u 
nil. 
lCi<n 
Now 
the Gi, &,... 
6, 
are interchangeable 
(Definition 
p. 179) 
since 
giving a bE~;il~iz 
. . . Gi, is equivalent 
to giving 
one of the permutations 
of [n]-(iI, 
i2,..., ik}, whose total 
number 
is (n-k)! 
(i,<i,<...<i,). 
Thus, [2a] follows 
from 
[II] 
applied 
to llJi=,, 
Gil in [2b]. 
Finally, 
for 
[2a’], 
use in (*) the well-known 
inequality 
that relates the rest of an 
alternating 
series to the first neglected term: 
Iln! e-l 
- d (n)ll = n! 
1 
-!(n+= 
J-s,. 
n 
n+l 
In particular, 
[2a] 
shows that limn+m {d(n)/n!}= 
l/e. The 
way the 
number 
e intrudes 
here into 
a combinatorial 
problem 
has strongly 
appealed 
to the imagination 
of the geometers 
of the 18-th century. 
In 
more colourful 
terms, if the guests to a party leave their hats on hooks 
in the cloakroom, 
and grab at good luck a hat when leaving, 
then the 
probability 
that nobody 
gets back his own hat is (approximately) 
l/e. 
Another 
method 
of computing 
d(n) 
consists of observing 
that the 
set GK [n] of permutations 
of [n] for which K( c [n]) is the set of fixed 
points, has for cardinality 
d(n- 
(K(). So: 
k=O

d(n-k)=C;l’,O

[2a] follows by the inversion formula [6a, e] (p. 143).

of [n] has for generating

[2d’] 
d(n+l)=n{d(n)+d(n-1)).

the derivative 
of e-‘=(l-t)g, 
we get -e-’ 
‘2 
--Q+ 
+(l-

obtain [2d], and in (**) to obtain [2d’] ( combinatorial 
proofs are also 
to find !).

We discuss now a natural generalization of the ‘problkme des rencontres’. 
A (k x n)-Zatin rectangle will be any rectangular matrix with k rows and 
n columns consisting of integers E [n], and such that all integers occurring 
in any one given row or column are all different (k < II). We suppose that 
the first row is (1, 2, 3, . . . . n} in this order (and we say that the rectangle 
is reduced then). We give an example of a (3 x 5) latin rectangle: 
SIEVE 
FORMULAS 
183 
The number K, of (reduced latin) (3 x n)-rectangles satisfies several 
recurrence relations (see, for instance, [Jacob, 19301, [Kerawala, 19411, 
[*Riordan, 
19581, p. 204) and today there are asymptotic expansions 
known for it ([*Riordan, 
19581, p. 209). The first values are (taken from 
tables of Kerawala, II < 15): 
No known recurrence relations exist for the number L(n, k) of 
(k x n)-rectangles, k>4, 
but a nice asymptotic 
formula 
is known 
([Erdiis, 
Kaplansky, 
19461, [Kerawala, 
1947a], [Yamamoto, 
19511): 
L(n, k)-(n!)‘exp(-(t)), 
for k < n1f3 -e and E > 0 arbitrary. As far as 
the number of latin n-squares (n x n-rectangles) is concerned, only the 
first 8 values are known precisely; if I, stands for the number of normalized 
latin squares (first row and column consist of { 1, 2, . . . . n}, in this order)

an extremely difficult combinatorial problem. 
4.3. THE 
‘PROBLBME 
DES MANAGES' 
This is the following 
problem: What is the number of possible ways one 
can arrange n married 
couples (=m&ages) 
around a table such that men 
and women alternate, 
but no woman sits next to her husband. (Posed, 
solved and popularized by [*Lucas, 18911. See also [Cayley, 1878a, b] ; 
[Moser, 19671 gives an interesting generalization.) 
We suppose the wives already placed around the table (2.n! 
pos-

sibilities). 
We number 
them 1, 2, . . ., n in the ordinary 
(counterclockwise) 
direction, 
starting 
from 
one of them: E,, E,, . .., E. (Figure 
34, n = 6). 
We assign to every husband 
the number 
of his wife: M,, M,, . . . , M,, and 
to every empty seat the number 
of the wife to the right: 
S,, S,, . . ., S,. 
The problem 
consists of counting 
the number 
of possible 
admissible 
assignments 
of seats to husbands. 
Such an assignment 
is tantamount 
to 
giving a permutation 
0 of [n] = { 1,2, . . ., n}, where a(i) stands for the seat 
number 
assigned to husband 
Mi, 
in [H]. This number 
should satisfy:

a(i) 
# i, 
a(i)#i+l 
for 
iE[n-I], 
a(n) 
# n, 
a@)# 
1. 
Let ,u(n) be the number 
of permutations 
such that [3a] 
holds; 
this is 
usually called the ‘reducednumber 
of m&ages’. 
The total number 
it* (n) 
of placements 
of m&ages 
is hence equal to 2.n!p 
(II), if we take into 
account the 2.n! possibilities 
of arranging 
the wives. We concentrate 
now 
on computing 
p(n). 
The main idea consists of connecting 
this problem 
with the theorem 
on p. 24. To carry this out, we put: 
[3b] 
Aziel 
:= {al a(i) 
= i}, 
iE[n]; 
Azi:= 
{al a(i) 
= i + l}, 
iE[n

A Zn:={61~(n)=1}.

elements of the ‘circle’ 
(1, 2, 3, . . . . 2n, 1). In the opposite 
case,

! and, according 
to the Theorem 
on p. 24, such p 
happen g1 (211, k) times ; k!nCe: 
p(n) 
= 
k$o 
(- 
1)” 
(II- 
k)! 
g1 
(24

Finally, 
we obtain :

problem, 
defined above, equals:

not the best 
for 
the actual 
computation 
of the /c(n):

As for polynomials, 
it is sometimes

to interpret 
any 
Boolean 
function feb (d) as a purely formal expression of the ‘variables’ 
(Al,Az,...,

an equivalence 
relation 
on the set of 
these expressions by putting f-g 
when g can be obtained 
from f by the 
rules of computation 
in any Boolean 
algebra 
(see p. 2). For example, 
f:=CA,ucA,wg:=C(AInA,)

to [4e], it suffices to prove 
[4j] for each complete

Then, 
the cardinal

the

(1) Replace in [4k] the Aj by 1 - Aj. 
(2) Expand the new form,

(3) Replace every monomial

this rule by computing 
the cardinal

DEFINITION 
B. The measure space (N, S??, 
f ) is said to be a probability 
space, if f(N)= 
1. In this case f is called a probability 
measure, or 
probability, 
and will often be denoted by P. Each set B&3 is coiled an 
event. N is the certain event, mostly denoted 52. Each point o E Q is called a 
sample. 
DEFINITION 
C. An atom of the Boolean algebra b (&) 
generated by 
.w’=(A~, Az,..., At,) (Definition A, p. 185) is a nonempty completeproduct

by a(.ti). 
THEOREM 
A. A probability 
measure f on a(&) 
is completely determined 
by the values (>O) off on each atom Cca (-pP) (the set of values off on the 
atoms is only subject to the restriction xCE. c&j f (C)= 1). 
n This follows from the fact that a(&‘) is a partition 
of N, and that 
every subset BE b (@‘) is a union of disjoint atoms (Theorem A, p. 186). H

supporting atom, for which g (Co) = 1. Here, Co runs through a(&). Then 
for every sequence of I real numbers say (b,, bz, . . ., b,), and every sequence

Let B:=[b4,i~4,rm~,je~nl 
be a rectangular matrix

The permanent of B, denoted by per B, equals, by definition:

per B = ..Fr”, 
b,, a(r$z, a(2) -1. bm, a(m) 9

m 
where the summation is taken over all m-arrangements of

For example, per 5 o 4

Hence there are (n), terms in the summation [Sal. If m=n, the terms 
of per(B) are, up to sign, those of det (B), and for tbe permanent there 
are properties similar to those of the determinants; however, per(AB)#

per B = f (N, (&>I. 
To this expression we will 
apply 
now 
[8a] 
(p. 195). Let x:=

where $ stands for the set of maps of [in] into [II] --x. Hence, by 
Theorem A (p. 127), and the notation of [9b]: 
PI 
f (At) = w (B (bl - 4). 
Then [9c] follows by putting 4: = [n] -y in [9i] and [8a] (p. 195). Since 
[9c] is true for all b,,j>O, it is also true in a commutative ring, since the 
term-by-term expansion [9a] is the same in both cases. n (For other 
expressions of per B, see PCartier, 
Foata, 19691, p. 76, [Crapo, 
19681, 
[Wilf, 1968a, b]). 
If perB can be directly computed, then [9a] gives, together with 
[9c, d, e], a ‘remarkable’ identity. For example, when B is the square 
matrix of order n consisting entirely of 1, b,, I = 1, then clearly per B = rz ! ; 
hence by [gel: n!=~~tl(-l)“-’

if all b, equal 0, except bl,l=b2,Z=...=bn,n=;

p is a prime number, and where p 1 n means ‘p divides n’. It is a general-

iE [ml, jE [n]. 
Show that the number

Let n boxes contain

ity cannot be generalized to more than three subspaces; but we always 
have: 6(A1Az . . . A,)<6(C;=,

*15. Miibius function. 
Let P be a partially ordered set, in other words, 
there is an order relation < given on P (Definition 
D, p. 59). Moreover, 
P is supposed to be locally$nite, 
in the sense that each segment [x,y] : = 
: = {U I x< udy} is finite. A stands for the set of functions f (x, y), x, YEP, 
real-valued, which are zero if x$y 
(0 not x<y). 
(1) We define the 
(convolution) 
product h off by g, denoted by h = f *g, by: 
Show that with this multiplication, 
A becomes a group, with unit element 
6 defined by 6 (x, y): = 1 for x= y, and : = 0 otherwise. (2) The zeta 
function 
c of P is such that [ (x, y): = 1 if x< y and : =0 otherwise. The 
inverse p of [, which satisfies p * [ = [ *p = 6, is called the Miibius function 
of P. If we suppose that P has a universal lower bound denoted by 0, 
verify the following ‘MGbius inversion formula’ for f, gcA:

(3) Let P:={l,

quotient equals p,pZ . . . pk, where the prime numbers pi are all d@erent; 
~(x, y)=O in the other case. Hence p (x, y)=,?(y 
1 x), where ~(PZ) is the 
ordinary arithmetical MGbius function (Exercise 16, p. 161). What does 
the inversion formula (#) give us in this case? (4) We order the set 
P: = !J3 (N) of subsets of a finite set N by inclusion. Then /c(x, y) =

STIRLING 
NUMBERS 
Let us give a survey of the three most frequently 
occurring 
notations:

of the first kind = s (n, k) (Riordan, 
and also this book, . . .) = S,” 
(Jordan, 
Mitrinovit,

Hagen, . ..).

of the second kind=S(n,

(k, n-k). 
5.1. STIRLING 
NUMBERS 
OF THE 
SECOND 
KIND 
S(%

AND 
PARTITIONS 
OF SETS 
DEFINITION 
A. The number S(n, k) of k-partitions 
(partitions 
in k blocks, 
Definition 
C, p. 30) is called Stirling 
number 
of the second kind. Hence 
S(n, k)>O for l<kGn 
and 
PaI 
S(n,k)=O 
if 
l<n<k. 
Wept 
S(O,O)=l 
andS(O,k)=Oforkal. 
In other 
words, 
S(n, k) is the number 
of equivalence 
relations 
with k 
classes on N. It is also the number 
of distributions 
of n distinct balls into 
k indistinguishable 
boxes (the order of the boxes does not count) such thar 
no box is empty. 
On p. 206 we will prove that the S(n, k) are indeed 
the number 
pre- 
viously 
introduced 
on p. 50. 
THEOREM

number of the second kind S(n, k) equals:

(1 <k

[lc] 
and the formula 
is still true for k>n(*S(n, 
k)=O, 
[la]). 
H For the proof 
of [lb, 
(*)I 
we apply 
the sieve method of p. 177. Let 
STIRLING 
NUMBERS 
205 
E be the set of maps of N into [k]:= 
{1,2, . . . . k} and let F be the subset 
of E consisting 
of the surjective 
maps: 
Cl4 
IEI’&“, 
IFI( 
k! S(n, k), 
(0) follows 
from [3a] (p. 4) and (00) from 
the fact that any fE:F corre- 
sponds to precisely 
one partition 
of N, namely 
the partition 
consisting 
of the k pre-images 
f -I (i), ie [/cl (p. 30), together 
with 
a numbering 
of this partition. 
Let now 
B, be the set of f EE that do not have i in 
their image: VXEN, f (x) #i. Evidently 
F=BIB,... 
8k and for the inter- 
chanpahle 
system of the Bi (p. 
I79), 
we have 
1 Bi,B,*... 
Bi,l = IB, B,*** 
-Ejl=l[j+

k! S(n, k) = )Fl = I&8, 
. ..I = 
!~IEI - (t) 
IBIS+ 
(“2) p,B,I 
-*.*=CQFD. 
As far as [lb(**)] 
is concerned, 
this is formula 
[bf] 
(p. 14). Finally, 
if II < k, then IFI is clearly equal to 0 and the sieve formula 
can still be 
applied, 
hence [lc]. 
q 
Thus 
we 
find 
S(n, l)=l, 
S(17,2)=2”-‘--l,S(n,3)=(3”-‘+ 
1)/2- 
2*-l,... 
. Another 
way to prove 
[lb] 
would 
be to observe 
that 
any 
mapf(EE) 
is surjective from N onto I: =f(N).

In other words, the Stirling 
number 
of the second kind S(n, k) is the sum 
of all products 
of n-k 
not 
necessarily 
distinct 
integers 
from 
[k] = 
= (1, 2, . . . . 
n-l 
k} (there are 
k-

(

such products). 
For 
instance, 
S(5,2)=13+12.2+1.22+23=15. 
Thus 
the 
numbers 
S(n, k) are the symmetric 
monomial functions 
of degree (n-k) 
of the first 
k integers 
(Exercise 
9, p. 158). This is the same thing 
as expanding 
(1 + 2 + a.. + k)“-k 
by the multinomial 
theorem 
and afterwards 
suppress- 
ing 
every 
multinomial 
coefficient. 
(This 
procedure 
applied

Wronski

Let ,YGN be a fixed point, and let M:=N-

We partition 
the set s=s(N,

of N into s’ and s”, s’, is the set of 
partitions

5.4. THE 
NUMBER 
w(n) 
OF PARTITIONS 
OR EQUIVALENCE 
RELATIONS 
OF ASET 
WITH 
n ELEMENTS 
The number w(n) of all partitions of a set N, often called exponential 
number or BeN number ([Becker, Riordan, 
19481, [Touchard, 
19561) 
apparently equals, by Definition 
A (p. 204): 
WI 
44 = ,<;<” S(n, a 
n>,l 
x.x 
So it is also equal to the number of equivalence 
relations on N. 
THEOREM A. The numbers w(n) 
have the followving 
GF: 
I31 
~~Ow(n)$=exp(e’-l), 
w(O):= 
1. 
They satisfy the recurrence 
relations ([Aitken, 
19331): 
PC1 
w(n+l)= 
C 
0 
; 
w@), 
1120, 
OC~<ll 
and they can be given in the form of a convergent series ([Dobinski, 
18771). 
(II > 1, [6f] p. 110) 
I 
Taking into account [4a], the first member of [4b] equals @(t, I), 
then, by [2b] (p. 206) the result follows. 
For [4c], as for [3a], there are two ways again. Analytically, 
identify 
the coefficients of t”/n! 
in d@(t, l)/dt=e’@(t, 
1). Combinarorialfy, 
let 
s(P) be the set of all partitions of P, IPJ =n + 1 and let XEP be a fixed 
point, N:=P- 
{x}, INI =n. For KcN, 
let +(p) 
be the set of partitions 
of P such that the block containing x is {x} u K. Then we have evidently 
a bijection between s(N-K) 
and E+(P). Hence, by virtue of the division 
s(P)=sm 
K 
s (P) and by passage to the cardinals, we have: 
w (n + 1) = Is (I’ll = .C, 1s~ (PII = .C, Is (N - K)I = 
c 
c 
Finally, for [4d], we identify the coefficients of r”/n! in the first and last 
member of [4e] in which the series are power series converging for each 
complex number t:

See [Rota, 1964a] and its bibliography. 
(For the asymptotic study of 
w(n) see [Moser, Wyman, 1955b], [Binet, Szekeres, 19571, and [*De 
Bruijn, 19611, pp. 102-8. See also Exercise 23, p. 296.) A table of w(n) is 
found on p. 310. 
We show now a method of computation 
of the m(n) without using 
the S(n, k). 
THEOREM 
B. ([Aitken, 
19331). In the sense of p. 14 we have: 
m(n)=d”m(i). 
I 
In fact, by [SC] (p. 13) (h ere, x=1) 
for (*), and by [4c] (p. 210) 
for (**) we have: 
where 
A(n, j) = 1 (- l)n-k

n 
More generally, the same method enables to prove that the polynomials 
S,(x):=& 
S(n, k) xk satisfy xS,(x)=d” 
Si (X) (a(n)=&(l)). 
In 
practice, the computation of the w(n) by way of this property proceeds 
as in the table shown. One goes from left to right, upward under an

angle of 45”, starting 
from 
the table obtained 
for m(n- 
1). Then, 
after 
having 
arrived 
at the value of W(IZ), it is brought 
down to the bottom 
of 
the first column, 
and one starts again. In the table is shown the computa- 
tion of w (6), starting from the table obtained 
by computing 
w (5): 52 +

of the S(rr, k), [6f] 
(p. 144):

The s(n, k) are not all positive, 
their 
sign is given 
by: IS(II, Ic)l = 
=(- 
l)k+” s (n, k), which follows from [5a], if one replaces t, II by - f, - II. 
On p. 235 we will give the combinatorial

5.6. RECURRENCE

THEOREM 
A. The Stirling

of the first

‘triangular’ 
recurrence relation: 
[W 
s(n,k)=s(n-l,k-l)-(n-l)s(n-l,k), 
n,k>l; 
s(n,O)=s(O,k)=O, 
except 
s(O,O)=l. 
For the unsigned numbers, this can be written 
C6a’l 
s(n,k)=s((n-l,k-l)+(n-l)s(n--1,k). 
This is a means for a quick computation 
of the first values of the 
s(n, k) (see table on p. 310 and Exercise 16, p. 226); particularly: 
lI6bl 
s(n, 1) = (- l>.-l

5.7. THE 
VALUES 
OF s(n,k) 
According 
to [lb] 
(p, 204) the Stirling number of the second kind 
s(n, k) can be expressed as a single summation of elementary terms, that 
is, which are themselves products and quotients of factorials 
and powers. 
There does not exist an analogous formula for the numbers of the first 
kind, the ‘shortest formula’ [7a, a’] below being a double summation of 
elementary terms. Shortwise, we will say that S(n, k) is of rank one and 
that s(n, k) is of rank TWO. 
THEOREM 
A. ([Schlbmilch 18521). The ‘exact’ 
value of s(n, k) is: 
n We use the Lagrange formula 
(p. 148). Let f(t):=e’-1 
and its 
inverse function f(-l> 
(t)=log(l+t). 
We get, by [5b] (p. 212), for 
(I), [8b] (p. 148), for (II), [5h] (p. 142), for (III) 
and [2a] (p. 206), for 
STIRLING 
NUMRERS 
217 
hence [7a] follows after simplifications. 
If we substitute the exact value 
[lb] 
(p. 204) into [7a], we obtain [7a’]. 
For small 
values of k, [7a, a’] is perhaps less convenient than expres- 
sion C7b] below. 
THEOREM 
B. We have: 
I31 
S(n+ 
l,k+ 
‘)=;;Y&(l),- 
1!5.(2),2!5,(3),...), 
where Yk stands for Ihe Bell polynomial 
(complete exponential, 
[3b, c] 
(p. 134), tabulated on p. 307) and C,,(s): =x7= I j-‘. 
n In fact, by [Sj] (p. 214) for (*):

5.8. CONGRUENCE 
PROBLEMS 
It is interesting 
to know 
in advance 
or to discover 
some congruences 
in any table of a sequence of combinatorial 
integers. This is a rapid way 
of checking 
computations, 
and an attractive 
connection 
between Com- 
binatorial 
Analysis 
and Number 
Theory. 
We show two typical examples 
in this matter. 
Let two polynomials 
be given: 
f(x)=Takxky 
g(x)=Fbkxk 
with integer coefficients, 
a,, 
k 
b EZ. We often write, when a,= 
b, (modnl) 
for all k: 
C84 
fb>=g(x) 
(modm) 
and we say ‘f congruent g modulom’. 
THEOREM 
A. (Lagrange). 
For eachprimep, 
we have in the sense of [Sal : 
I31 
(x)p:= x(x - l)~~~(x-p+l)~xp-x 
(modp). 
In other words, the Stirling 
numbers of the first kind satisfjt: 
PC1 
s(p, k) = 0 (modp), 
except s (p, p) = 1, and (Wilson 
theorem) 
IWI 
s(p,l)=(p-l)!=-1 
(modp). 
n Forp 
tied, 
we argue by induction, 
on k decreasing from p - I. By [6b] 
(~.214),for(*),andTheorem 
C(p. lS)for(**),[8c] 
is true when k=p- 
1: 
’ 
s(P,P-+-

Assume 
that [8c] is true, thus, s(p, I)=0 
(modp) 
for (3<)

Then, 
[se] implies, by Theorem 
C (p. 14) for (*):

(modp); 
hence, sinces(p, 
l)=(-l)p-l(p-l)!,

(p - l)!

Put x=a 
in [Sb], then (a),=0 
(modp), 
because, among p consecutive 
integers, at least one is a multiple 
ofp. 
THEOREM 
B. For each prime number p, the Stirling 
numbers of the second 
kind satisJy: 
I34 
S(p, k) = 0 
(modp), 
except 
S(p,l)=S(p,p)=l. 
II 
111 fact, by [I b] (P. 205), for (*), [8f] for (**), and Example 2 (p. 153), 
for (***), 
we have for k32: 
k! S (p, k)‘z’C

Thus p divides 
k!S(p, 
k), hence S(p, k) ,when k<p- 
1, because then p 
is relatively 
prime with respect to k!

Note. One can prove 
this also by induction,

of Theorem

3. The lattice of the partitions 
of a set. Let be given two partitions P’, Y 
of a set N. Then we say that Y is finer 
than Y or that P’ is a sub- 
partition 
of Y, denoted by P’<Y, 
if and only if each block of Y is 
contained in a block of Y. Show that this order relation on the set of 
partitions of N makes it into a lattice (Definition D, p. 59).

of the Bernoulli numbers B,, [14aJ (p. 48), in the form: 
Show that Bn=x;=O

Use this to obtain 
the 
value of B,, expressed as a double sum. Show also, by substituting

(c(k - Uj) for k < 1. Prove then the multiplication

Use this to recover the formulas of Exercise 29 (p. 167). 
7. Associated Stirling 
numbers of the second kind. For r integer 2 1, let 
S,(n, k) be the number of partitions of the set N, INI =IZ, into k blocks, 
all of cardinality z r. We call this number the r-associated Stirling number

if, moreover, no 
box is allowed to be empty (Theorem C., p. 15). (3) Suppose the 
boxes are all different, and the balls of equal size, but painted in different 
colours. Balls of the same colour are supposed to be not distinguishable. 
In this way we define a partition of the set N of balls. If there are in this 
partition 
c, i-blocks, i= I, 2, 3, . . . . then the number of distributions 
is 
equal to (:)“(“~‘)“(“~‘~...,

The

al, a2,... be integers 20. Show that B,, k (a,,a, . ..) equals the number 
of partitions of N, INI =n, into k blocks, the i-blocks being painted with 
colours taken from a stock Ai, given in advance, and with ai colours in 
the stock ,4i, i= 1, 2, 3 ,.... (It is not compulsory to use all colours of 
each stock!) (2) We denote the value of the n-th derivative in the point 
x=a of F(x) [or G(x)] 
by f, [org.]; 
fo, g,,=F(a), 
G(a). Suppose that 
x=a 
is a multiple root of order k of G(x)=O, 
and that F(x)/G(x) 
has 
the singular part c”,= 1 yp(x-a)-P.

([Schrbder, 18701. See also [Carlitz, Riordan,

of the (Bell)

number. 
Modulo 
p, we have m(p) = 2, ZD (p + 1) = 3 and, more generally, 
m (JI” + h) = urn (11) + m (h -I- 1). Modulo 
p2, we have ra (2~) - 2m (p + 1) -

The following 
solves, for partitions 
of a set, a problem 
anaIogous 
to the problem 
for partitions 
of integers, 
which 
is solved 
by Theorem 
B (p. 98). Let % be an infinite

PERMUTATIONS

PERMUTATIONS 
We denote the group of permutations of N (with composition of maps 
as operation) by 6 (N). This group is also called the symmetric group of 
N. The unit element of this group is the identity permutation, 
denoted 
by c:‘v’x~N, E(x)=x. 
Evidently, IG(N)I=n! 
(p. 7). 
6.1. THE 
SYMMETRIC 
GROUP 
We recall some notions about permutations oeG(N). 
We recall that a permutation 0 of a finite set N, IN I= n, is a bijection of N 
onto itself. 
Actually, as N is finite, we could as well have said ‘surjection’ or ‘in- 
jection’ instead of ‘bijection’. 
A permutation (r can be represented by writing the elements of the set 
N on a top row, and then underneath each element its image under the 
mapping Q. Thus 
represents a o&(N), 
where N: = {a, b, 
c, 4 e, f, s}, o(a)‘= c, a(b)La, 
u(c)=e, 
u(d)=d, 
o(e)=b, 
a(‘)=g, 
Q)=f. 
Another way of representing G consists of associating with it a digraph 
9 (p. 67), where it is understood that an arc 3 is drawn if and only if 
y =a(~), yf x. Figure 37 corresponds in this way with the above per- 
mutation. 
abcdefg 
Fig. 38. 
One can also represent g by a relational 
lattice, as on p. 58. Then 
Figure 38 corresponds with the permutation 
of Figure 37. Clearly a 
binary relation on N is associated with a permutation in this way if and 
only if all its horizontal and vertical sections have one element. 
Finally, Q can be represented by a square matrix, say B = [b,, ,], defined 
by bi,j=l 
ifj=,(i), 
and b,,j= 0 otherwise. Such a matrix is called a 
pcrrwtation 
matrix. 
The orbit of x(eNj 
for a permutation B is the subset of N consisting 
of the points x, o(x), a*(x), . . . . ok-‘(x), 
where k, the length of the orbit, 
is the smallest integer 2 1 such that c~(x)=x. 
If k= 1, 0(x)=x, 
then x 
is a$,yeci point of (T (See p. 180). 
Let -Y,, x2,..., xk be k different points of N, l,<k<rt. 
The cycle y= 
= t x1, x2,... , xk) is the following permutation: 
y (x1) =x2, y (x2) = .‘cj,. . ., 
Y(-Yk-,)=-Ykr r(+yk)=. x, and y (X)-X if x#xi. 
We say that y has length k 
(also denoted by Iyl) and has the set (x1, x2, . . . . xk) for domain (or orbit). 
Evidently, there are (11)&,/k cycles of length k because each cycle (x1, x2, . . . . 
xk) is given by any one of the following k-arrangements: (x,, x2, . . . . xk), 
(x2, 
x3, 
. ..? 
xk, 
$), 
(xk, 
x1, 
..., xk-l), 
and only by these. 
A circular 
pernwtation 
is a cycle of length II (=INI). 
So there are 
(n),/n=(n-- 
I)! such permutations. A transposition 
t is a cycle of length 
2: in other words, there exist two points a and b, a# b, such that t(a) = b, 
z (1)) = a. There are exactly 
0 
“2 transpositions of N. 
We recall that each permutation can be written as a product of cycles, 
with disjoint domains, this decomposition being unique up to order. For 
example, the permutation of p. 230 can be written as (a, c, e, b) (f, g) (d) = 
=(a, c, e, 6) (f, g) (the cycles of length 1 are often omitted). Similarly, 
& = (x,) (X2).’ * (x,). 
c urrently, the cycles in the sense of graphs (p. 62) and 
cycles in the sense of permutations will be identified, as in Figure 37. Each 
cycle is product of transpositions; 
in fact, (x1)=(x1, x2) (x2, x1) and 
(x1, 
x2,..., 
xk)=(xl, 
xk) (x1, xk-l)“‘(xl, 
x2) for k>2. 
Hence, this holds 
for each permutation, because they are products of cycles. 
It follows that the set S=%(N) 
of transpositions of N, I%(= 
0 
i , en- 
erates the group G(N). In fact, 6 (N) can be generated by a much smaller 
set of transpositions. To make this more precise, let us associate with 
every set of transpositions 
LIcZ 
the graph g(U) defined as follows: 

232 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
{x, u} is an edge of g (Uj if and only if the transposition (x, yj~u. 
THEOREM. 
A set U (c Zj 
of (n - I) transpositions 
of N generates 
6 (Nj 
if and only if g (U) is a tree (DeJinition 
B, p. 62). 
~ n If g (Uj is a tree over N, then for all a, beN, afb there exists a unique 
path ~~(=a), 
x2,..., x,(=bj 
such that {xi, x~+~} is an edge of g (Uj; 
hence the transposition (xi, x~+~)EU, iE [k- 
11. Now it is easily verified 
that the transposition 
(a, b) can be factored as follows in the group 
G(N): 
(a, b) = (Xi, Xkj = (h-1, 
Xkj (G-2, xk-lj*~*(xl~ 
x2> x 
x (x2, X3)-.(%-2, 
%-I) 
(%-I, 
4. 
Thus, as each (a, ~)EZ is generated by U, 6(N) 
is too (cf. p. 231). 
Now we suppose conversely that U generates 6 (Nj, but that g (11) is 
not a tree. Because g (U) has (n - 1) edges, there exist a and b not con- 
nected by a path (Theorem C, p. 63); this implies that the transposition 
(a, bj is not equal to any product of transpositions belonging to U, etc. W 
(For other properties related to representing a set of permutations by a 
graph, see [DCnes, 19591, [Eden, Schtitzenberger, 19621, [Eden, 19671, 
and [*Berge, 19681, pp. 117-23.) 
For two decompositions into a product of transpositions of a given 
permutation, u =cpl ‘pz . . . cps = J/1 $2 . . . $r, the numbers s and t have the 
same parity. This can be quickly seen by observing first that the product 
7~ of the transposition 
7 = (a, bj and a permutation (T with k cycles is a 
permutation with k+ 1 cycles if a and b are in the same orbit, and with 
k- 1 cycles if CI and b are in different orbits of 0’. Hence it follows that 
‘pt ‘pz*** cps and $1 ti2 . . . tit have a number of cycles equal to 1 Ih 1 + I+ 
+~~~fl,(s-l)times~1,andlIf:l+l+~~~+l,(t-ljtimes~1,respect- 
ively. The equality of these two numbers implies the above-mentioned 
property. (This is the proof by [Cauchy, 18151. See also [*Serret, 18661, 
II, p. 248.) 
A permutation is called eveIt (respectively odd) if it can be decomposed 
into an even (respectively odd) numbers of transpositions. Suppose O= 
= YtY2 *-a yk, a product of k cycles. The parity of 0 is equivalent to the 
parity of the integer n-k 
(=C(jvJ 
- 1)) because of the decomposition 
of each cycle of length I into I- 1 transpositions (see above). Thus, a 
PERMUTATIONS 
233 
permutation is even (respectively odd) if it has an even (respectively odd) 
number of cycles of even length. 
The sigrt x (cj of a permutation cr is defined by x (cj = + 1 (- 1 respect- 
ively) if cr is even (respectively odd). From the decomposition into trans- 
positions it follows immediately that for each two permutations (T and 0’: 
x@J’> =x(4 
x(Q. 
The alternating 
subgroup of G (Nj consists of the even permutations of N. 
The order of a permutation 
cr is the smallest integer k> 1 such that 
&=E. This is clearly the LCM of the system of integers consisting of 
lengths of the cycles occurring in the decomposition of 6.

DEFINITION. 
Let c,, c~,,.., c, be integers 20 such that: 
I24 
Cl + 2c, + ... + nc, = n . 
A permutation 
a~6(N), 
INI =n is said to be of type [cl] = [cl, c2, . . . c,j 
if its decomposition 
into disjoint cycles contains exactly ci cycles of length 
i, i= 1, 2, 3,. ., n. In other words, the partition 
of N given by the orbits of 
o is of type [cl, c2, . .] (Definition 
B, p. 205). 
THEOREM 
A. A permutation 
ae’G(Nj 
of type [cl is even (or odd) if and 
only if c2 + c4 + c6 + .+a is even (or odd). 
w We have already seen this on p. 23 1. H

n Giving such a permutation of type 1~11 is equivalent to giving first a 
diGon 
of N into the ci orbits of length i of the permutation, 
with i= 1, 
2, 3,. . . ; then to erasing for all i the order on the set of ci orbits of length i, 
and finally to equipping each orbit with a cyclic permutation of its own.

INI=n, 
of 
type 
[[cl, CD...], 
w h ose total number of orbits (=number 
of 
cycles in the decomposition) equals k, c, + c2 + .a. = k. Then we have the 
following GF in an infinite number of variables t, u, x,, .x2,. . . :

THEOREM D. The number of permutations of N with k orbits (whose decom- 
position has k cycles) equals the unsigned Stirling number of the first kind 
5 (n, k). 
n The required number, say a(n, k), equals the sum of the ~(n, k; cl, 
c2,. . .), taken over all systems of integers cl, c2,. . . such that cl + c2 + a** = k 
and c1 +2c, + ... =n. Hence, by [Zc] :

Hence a(n, k)=s(n, 
k) by [5a, d] (p. 212).

6.3. MULTIPERMUTATIONS 
We show now an immediate generalization of the concept of permutation, 
suggested by the matrix notation of p. 230. For each integer k>O, a 
relation !,R will be called a /c-permutation (of [n]) when all vertical sec- 
tions and all horizontal sections all have 1~ elements. Let P(n, k) be the 
number of these relations. Evidently, P(n, k)=O if k>n, and otherwise 
P(n, k)=P(n, 
n-k). 
We have P(n, O)=P(n, n)=l 
and we recover the 
ordinary permutations for k= 1: P(n, l)=P(n, 
n- l)=n! 
THEOREM 
A. Let k,, k,, . . ., k, and II, 12, . . . . I, be 2n integers, all 20. The 
number 
of relations % such that the i-th vertical section has k, elements, 
and the j-th horizontal section has lj elements, is given by the following 
coeficient:

n It suffices to expand the product in [3a], and to observe that the coeffi- 
cient under consideration is the number of solutions with Xi,,=0 
or 1 
of the system of 2n equations: 
in other words, the number of relations we want to find.

We now investigate the number P(n, 2) of bipermutations, short nota- 
tion P,.

about P(n, k) 
except the asymptotic 
result P (n, k) N (kn)! (k!)-2”

PERMUTATIONS 
237 
It is often convenient 
to represent 
a permutation 
a~6 [n] by a polygon 
whose sides are segments Ai, Ai+r, 
in [lz- 1] such that A, has i for ‘ab- 
scissa’ and u(i) 
for ‘ordinate’. 
The heavy line in Figure 39 represents the 
polygon 
of OEG [7], defined by the cycle (1,3,5,2), 
in the sense of p. 231; 
hence, the points 4, 6,7 are fixed points.

DEFINITION. 
An inversion 
of a permutation 
0~6 
[I?] is a pair 
(i,j) 
such 
that 1 <i<j<n 
and a(i)>a(j). 
In this case we say that 0 has at! inversion 
in (i,j). 
Hence, 
in the associated 
polygon, 
an inversion 
‘is’ a segment 
AiAj, 
1 <i< j< tt, with negative 
slope. The permutation 
which 
is represented 
in Figure 
39 induces 
5 inversions, 
whose 
corresponding 
segments are 
indicated 
by thin lines. 
Let Z, be the number 
of inversions 
of a&[n].

which interchanges a and 6, 1 <a < b <n, can be read off from the polygon

hence q(z)=

arbitrary oeG[n]

BY 
NUMBER 
OF RISES; 
EULERIAN 
NUMBERS 
DEFINITION. 
A permutation 
a~6 [IZ] induces a rise [or a fall] 
in iE [IZ - I] 
ifu(i)<a(i+

l)].

Thus, in Figure 40 the 5 rises [4 falls] of a permutation 
of [lo] 
are in- 
dicated by a heavy [thin] 
line. 
Let A, be the number 
of rises of 0, in other words, the number 
of sides 
with positive 
slope of the associated polygon. 
Clearly, O<A,<n- 
1, and 
A,=OoViE[n], 
a(i)=n-if 
I, and A,=n-leViE[n], 
o(i)=i. 
More- 
over, the number 
offalls 
of 0 is evidently 
equal to: 
[5al 
n-l 
-A,. 
THEOREM 
A. TIze number a(n, k) of permutations 
of [n] with k rises satis- 
jies the followizzg recurrejzce relatiorzs: 
t-5bl 
a(n,k)=(n-k)a(n-l,k-l)+(k+l)a(n-1,k) 
for II, k 2 1 , with a(/?, 0) = 1 for n>,O, arzd a(0, k)=O for k 2 1. 
n Let a(n, k) be the set of permutations 
of [In] that induce k rises. The 
number a (n, k) = la (n, k)j is also the number 
of permutations 
of [n] that 
induce k falls, which can be seen by associating 
with GE G [n] the per- 
mutation 
il-ra(n-i+ 
I). Hence: 
[5cl 
a (II, k) = a (n, n - k - I ) . 
Now we define the map g of a(n, k) into G[n- 
I] by:

It is clear that c’Ea(n- 
1, k) in the case of Figures 41a+ b, and that 
cr’Ea(n- 1, k- 1) in the case of Figures 4lc, d. 
Conversely, if rr’~a (n - 1, k), some reflection shows that 19-l (cr’)I= 
= the number of rises of (T’ (see Figure 41 b) + 1 (see Figure 41 a) = k + 1; 
if rYEa(n-1, 
k- 1) we have, similarly, with [Sal for (a): jg-i ( 
=the 
number of falls of CT’ (see Figure 41~) + 1 (see Figure 41d)Y { (n - 1) - l-

THEOREM 
B. Let A (n, k) denote the Eulerian number (introduced in [ 14t], 
p. 51) then we have: 
I31 
a(n,k-l)=A(n,k)‘z’A(n,n-k+l). 
m In fact, if we put K(n, k):=a(n, 
k-l), 
then the recurrence relation 
[5b] becomes exactly [14u] (p. 51), where A (n, k) is replaced by A(n, k), 
including the initial conditions. Hence A(n, k)=A (n, k). Equality [se] (*) 
follows then from [SC]. n 
Evidently, xLA (n, k)=n! and, by [5b], 
[se’] 
A(n, k) = (n - k+l)A(n-l,k-l)+kA(n-1,k).

of permuting

I, c2 numbers 
2 ,..., c, numbers 
n, c,+c,+c,+

1965, 1966 b, 19671, 
[*Riordan, 
19581, p. 216; cf. Exercise 21, p. 265.) In more concrete 
terms, one draws from 
a set of 52 playing 
cards all cards, one by one, 
stacking them on piles in such a way that one starts a new pile each time 
a card appears that is ‘higher’ 
than its predecessor. 
In how many ways 
can one obtain k- 
1 piles? (here c1 =c2 = .a. =c13 =4).

(I) 
An example 
In order to clarify the aim of this section consider the following problem. 
In how many ways can one paint the six faces on a cube in at most c colours, 
it being understood that two colourings will not be distinguished 
if they can 
be transformed 
into each other by a rotation 
of the 
cube. In the last case 
the colourings are called equivalent. 
The class of colourings that are all 
equivalent to a given one, is called a model or a conjgurafion. 
For example, 
in the case of two colours, white and blue, c = 2, the colourings {blue: E, F, 
white: the rest} and {blue: A, C} are equivalent (Figure 44), but these 
two are not equivalent to the colouring {blue: A, B). Direct counting

Statement of the problem 
Let D and R be two finite sets, InI =d, IRI =r, and let Q be a group of 
permutations of D. F=RD is the set of maps 
of D into R, and 3 is the 
partition of F consisting of the - equivalence classes on F defined by: 
I34 
f-g-+%tEQ, 
9 = f(a), 
which means: VxcD, g(x) =f (a(x)). 
This is an equivalence indeed, because (i)f=f 
(E), (11) g =f (a)=j= 
=g(a-‘), 
(III) 
g=f(a), 
h=g(j?)=-h=h 
(a/3). Each class fes is called 
a model. 
Fig. 46. 
Let also A be a commutative ring, and w a map from R into A, called 
weight. We define the weight of feF by: 
WI 
w(f) :=gD e-(4), 
and the inventory 
of each subset F’cF, 
denoted by W(F’), by: 
PI 
W):=,C, 
w(f). 
E ’ 
It is easy to see, by [7a, b], that: 
WI 
.f-93 
lY(f)= W(9); 
thus we can define the weight 93(f) 
of a mode2 fgs 
by: 
Fe1 
a(f):= 
W(f), 
where

(f is an arbitrary representative of the equivalence class f). Like in [7c], 
the inventory 
YB((‘) 
of each S’tB 
is defined as follows: 
C 7fl 
mv=fgNf)- 
The problem 
now is to compute %3 (5). 
In the case of example (I), D is the set of the faces of the cube, R is the 
set with two elements, ‘blue’ and ‘white’. The weight function ~tris defined 
by w (blue) = t, w (white) = U; A is the ring of polynomials in two variables 
t, u. 0 is the group of permutations of the faces of the cube, which we 
studied already on p. 248; F is the set of colourings of the fixed cube, 
and 3 is the set of models of colourings. If W( f ) = tPuq, this means, by 
[7b], that the colouring f is of type (p, q) in the sense that f contains p 
blue faces and q white faces, p + q= 6. Hence, we have: 
I%1 
m(5)= 
c 
m(f)= 
c v(P,q)tPUq=P(t,u), 
f’E 
P. 4 
where v(p, q) is the number of models of type (p, q). The total number 
of models is then equal to: 
[W 
C v(p, 4) = P(L 1).

Theorem of Pdlya. ([Pblya, 
19373, and in other form [Redfield, 
19271. We follow the exposition of [De Bruijn, i964j. j Let Zjx,, x2, . . . . 
x,J be the cycle indicator 
polynomial 
of the group of permutations

of 3: 
I31

=~(~~~wcY,.~~~Rz(Y)....~~~~wd(Y)). 
where m, w, 3, f, R are defined in the previous 
section. 
n Let F, be the set of thefcF for which W( f ) = t. It appears that we can 
consider 8 as a group of permutations of F, (the verification 
is easy), 
when we define g( f ), for a&, 
feF<, by:

PERMIX-ATIONS 
253 
It follows that the conditions of Theorem B(p. 249) are satisfied, if we 
take N instead of F,, and if we change N,(a) into: 
I31 
F&):=(f 
I feF<,cf 
= fj 
(here of=f 
means that VaeD, f (~(a))=f 
(a)). The number of models 
( = orbi ts) f whose weight is <, fEF{, is hence equal to (using [Cj], p. 249): 
Thus, by [71] for (*), and by [7k] for (*a): 
In other words, if SJ=(B1, B,, ..,, Bk) is the partition of D consisting of 
the orbits of g (in the sense of Definition 
D, p. 248), the last summation 
of [7m] can be taken over all f that are constant on each of these blocks 
B,E.@‘. Giving such a function f is hence equivalent to giving a map g 
of .%Y into R, gE R@. Under these circumstances, choose biEBi, 
irz [k], 
and then apply Theorem A (p. 248) in (*) to obtain the expansion of a 
product of sums : 
Thus we recognize the term of Z(X,, x2, . . . . 3cd) corresponding with the 
permutation 
g, [SC] (p. 247). In this term, x1 should be replaced by 
CyeR W(Y), x2 bY ,&I 
MJ~(~), etc. Hence [7i] using [7m (**)I.

(IV) Application 
to the cube 
We return to the cube of (I) with at most 2 colours. With the weight w

as defined on p. 252, we have CyER wk(y)=tk+uk; 
hence by [bf] (p. 248) 
and [7g, i]:

+ 11~)~) 
= t6 + A4 
+ 2t4u2 + 2t3u3 + 2t2u4 + tu5 + u6. 
For instance, by [7g], the number of colourings with 4 blue faces and 
two white faces is equal to the coefficient of t4u2 in [70], hence 2. More 
generally, if there are c colours, then we have in [7i] CgER ,v’(Y)=~:+ 
i-t:+-,+tt, 
where I,, t, . . . . t, are c variables. Hence, by notation of 
Exercise 9 (p. 158), for the monomial symmetric functions:

P(h, 
f2, *-a, tc) = &{(t1

For instance, there are 15 models of the cube that use 5 given colours 
for the faces (hence one colour is used twice). The total number v, of 
models of cubes with at most c colours is obtained by putting 
t1 = I, =

Two graphs 3 and 9’ over N are 
called equivalent,

if there exists a permutation 
a of N, which 
induces a map from the set of edges of 3 onto the set of edges of 9’. In

class, thus obtained, 
is called an urzlabeledgraph, 
abbreviated 
UG (graphs 
as we have seen on p. 61 are called labeled graphs, to distinguish 
them 
from 
the UG; their vertices are distinguishable). 
For instance, there are 
three UG’s with 4 nodes and 3 edges: gl,

of X, (abbreviated RA) is a word of X (p. 18). 
More precisely, a (cl, c 2, . . . . c,)-RA of X, say f, is a word in which the 
letter xi occurs ci times, c,>O, ie [n]. We say also ‘RA of x;‘sC; . . . xz,

CHAPTER 
VII 
EXAMPLES 
OF INEQUALITIES 
AND 
ESTIMATES 
In the preceding 
chapters 
we have established 
explicit 
formulas 
for 
counting 
sets. The sets we wanted 
to count were of the following 
type: 
a finite set N with n elements is given, and then we studied sets of com- 
binatorial 
objects bound 
to N that satisfied some additional 
conditions. 
If these conditions 
are not simple, then the explicit formula 
is usually not 
simple either, 
difficult 
to obtain, 
and little efficient. 
It can often be re- 
placed advantageously 
by upper and lower bounds. Evidently, 
the closer 
these bounds fit, the better. 
In most of the cases we want to determine 
conditions 
in the form 
of 
inequalities 
between 
certain 
parameters 
(integers) 
that guarantee 
the 
existence or non-existence 
of configurations 
between 
these parameters. 
The search for such inequalities 
has the charm of challenging 
problems, 
since there is no general rule for obtaining 
this kind of results. 
In this chapter we give also an example of the use of probabilistic 
lan- 
guage, and, moreover, 
an asymptotic 
expansion 
of the most easy kind. 
7.1. 
CONVEXITY 
ANC 
UNIMODALITY 
OF 
COMiiiNA’lURlAL 
SBQUENCES 
Just as in the case of functions 
of a real variable, 
it is interesting 
to know 
the global behaviour 
of combinatorial 
sequences of integers ok: monotony, 
convexity, 
extrema; 
this is a fertile source of inequalities, 
which are par- 
ticularly 
useful in estimates. 
In this respect we recall some definitions. 
I. A real sequence vk, k = 0, 1,2, . . ., is called convey on an interval 
[a, h] 
(containing 
at least 3 consecutive 
integers) 
when: 
Cl4 
v,+‘ki(v,p1+vk+l), kE[a+l,b-1-j. 
It is called concuve on [a, b] if, in [la], 
< is replaced 
by Z. In the case 
where the inequalities 
are strict for all k, ok is called strictly 
convex or 
strictly 
concave. [la] 
is equivalent 
to A2v~:=vk+2-2vk+I 
-I-Q>O

and with 
a plateau 
in k=(n+ 
1)/2 if )I is odd. 
111. A real 
sequence 
/lk>O, 
k=O, I,2 ,..., 
is called 
logarithtnically 
convex in [a, b] if: 
[lcl 

270 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
It is called logarithmically 
concave if, in [ lc], < is everywhere 
replaced by 
2. In the case that the inequalities 
are strict for all k, vk is called strictly 
logarithmically 
convex (or concave). 
The terminology 
adopted 
here originates 
from 
the fact that [lc] 
is 
equivalent 
to saying that w,: = logv, is convex. 
THEOREM A. Each sequence u,J>,O) which is logarithmically 
concave OIZ 
its interval 
of dejinition, 
say [a, b], is there either nondecreasing 
or non- 
increasing or u&nodal. 
Moreover, 
in the fast case, if vk is strictly logarith- 
mically concave, then v, has either a peak or a plateau 
with 2 points. 
n v~>v,-~v~+~ 
can be written 
as v,lv,-, 
>v~+~/v~, 
which 
proves 
that 
Z,.- * -v&-~ 
is decreasing on [a+ 1, b], where a and b are supposed to be 
integers without 
loss of generality. 
If z,,> 1 (or z,,+~ < l), v, is increasing 
(or decreasing) 
on [a, b]. If z,+ 1 > 1 and zbc 1, ok is evidently 
unimodal. 
In the last case, if z, decreases strictly, then there is at most one value of k 
such that z,= 1, which gives then a plateau of 2 points. 
n 
THEOREM B. If the generating 
polynomial: 
I31 
P(x):= c VkXk, vp# 0, 
OSkQp 
ef a-finite sequence v~( 2 0): 0 <k < p: has only real roots (,< Ol

(this is one form 
of the Newton 
inequalities, 
[*Hardy, 
P6lya, Littlewood, 
19521, p. 104); hence uk is unimodal, 
either with a peak or with a plateau 
of 2 points. 
n Let us first suppose that all the vk > 0. Applying 
the theorem 
of Rolle, 
the polynomial 
Q(x, y) = Ckp, 0 vkx ’ y p-k has only roots with real y/x, so 
the polynomials 
cYQ/c?x and ~?Q/ay also have this property; 
inductively 
we 
find then that this is true for all aa+“Q/axOayb, 
a+ b<p- 
1. This holds 
particularly 
for 
the second-degree 
polynomial 
aP-zQ/axk-‘ayP-k-l, 
whose discrimant 
is consequently 
20, hence [le]. 
Now, if there does exist 
EXAMPLES 
OF

AND

271 
an I such that u~=O, 061 <p - 1, then all the roots of P(x)=0 
are zero, 
since these are numbers 
< 0 whose (p - I)-th elementary 
symmetric 
func- 
tion is zero: so finally, 
v,=O, 
O<k<p- 
1, hence [le] 
follows 
again. 
n 
Now we have a powerful 
tool for proving 
unimodality 
of certain com- 
binatorial 
sequences. 
THEOREM 
C. The sequence of the absolute values of the Stirling 
numbers of 
the first 
kind, z, (17, k), n jixed 
(Z 3), k variable 
(in) 
is unimodal, 
with a 
peak or plateau 
of 2 points. 
In fact, only the peak exists, [Erdiis, 
19531; for estimates of its abscissa, 
see [Hammersley, 
19511, [Moser, 
Wyman, 
1958b].) 
n In fact, the ‘horizontal’ 
polynomial 
([Sf], 
p. 213) xL5(~z, k) xk= 
=x(x+ 
l).*.(x+n- 
1) has only real roots, and we can apply Theorem. 
B. 
H 
THEOREM 0. The sequence S(n, k) of the Stirling 
numbers 
of the second 
kind, n fixed (> 3), k variable 
(6 n), is unimodal 
with a peak or plateau 
of 
2poi~ts.

Applyingthe

The number 
s(n)= Is(N)1 of Sperner systems (unordered 
systems with- 
out repetition, 
in the sense of p. 3) is just, up to 2 units, the number 
of 
elements of a free distributive 
lattice with 11 generators, 
or, the number 
of 
monotone 
increasing 
Boolean 
functions 
with II variables. 
Since [Dede-

efforts have been made to compute or estimate this 
number

ASYMPTOTIC

THE 
NUMBER 
OF 
REGULAR 
GRAPHS 
OF 
ORDER 
TWO 
ON 
N 
(1) Graphical 
and geometrical 
formulation 
of the problem 
A regular 
graph of order r (integer 
20) 
is a graph on N, INI =II, 
such 
that there are r edges adjacent 
to every node XEN. 
Let G(n, rj be the 
number 
of these graphs. Evidently 
G(n, Oj= 1. For computing 
Gjrz, 1 j, 
observe 
that giving 
a regular 
graph 
of order 
1 is equivalent 
to giving 
a 
partition 
of N into disjoint 
pairs (the edges). Hence G(2m+ 
1, lj=O 
and 
G(2m, 1) = (2n1)!/(2”m!j. 
W e investigate 
now G(rz, 2)=g,. 
First, we give 
a geometric 
interpretation 
to these numbers 
([*Whitworth, 
19013, p. 269, 
Exercise 100). 
Let be given a set A of II straight 
lines in the plane, a,, 6,, . . . . 6,, lying

COMBINATORICS 
in generalposition 
(no two among them are parallel, and no three among 
them are concurrent). Let P be the set of their points of intersection, 
PI= 
“2 
0 
. We call any set of n points from P such that any three different 
points are not collinear, a cloud. An example is shown in Figure 52, for

the case n=4, {a, b, d, e}. Let S(d) stand for the set of clou& of A, then 
we have: 
Pal 
N&(A)~NcP; 
lNl=n; 
({a,b,c}cP, 
SEA) =+(a, b, c} Q S. 
Giving a cloud is hence equivalent to giving a regular graph of order 2: 
it suffices to identify the lines a,, a,, . . . . 6, with the nodes x1, x*, . . . . X, 
of N, and each point of intersection 
bin 6, with the edge {xi, Xji. 
For example, with 3 points, we can get only 1 cloud; with 4 points, we 
have 3 clouds, since the clouds in {6,, 6,, d3, S,} (Figure 52) are the sets 
{a, b, 4 e,}, {Q, c, 4.f) 
(6 c, e, f >. The problem 
is to determine 
the 
number g.= IS(A)1 of clouds of A.

(Figure 54) is obtained in one way only:

M#M’=d(M)n@(M’)#O. 
But in this way Y(n) is not completely obtained, because there exist 
singular clouds N of A that do not belong to any @ (M), for instance, the 
cloud shown in Figure 55. Let .Y be the set of singular clouds of A. Giving 
a cloud E,Y’ is evidently equivalent to giving a pair {u, u} among the 
(II - 1) points of 6,. and to giving a cloud on the (II - 3) lines di that do not

We will use the ‘method of Uarbolrx’

We apply this theorem to the function g(z), defined by [3g]; the only

7.4. RANDOM 
PERMUTATIONS 
We take for probability 
space (Q, a’, P) the following: 
fi = G[n] 
(the set 
of all permutations 
of [n] = (I, 2,. .., n}), B= v(6[n]) 
(the set of all sub- 
sets of ‘.Z[II]), 
and for probability 
measure P that for which all permuta- 
tions have equal probability: 
PaI 
ulEG[Cn] * P(w) = 1.. 
Iffl 
it !’ 
Ac6[n]*P(A)= 
;T. 
(Definitions 
A and B, p. 189; we observe that the probabilistic 
termin- 
ology used in this section is defined 
in Exercise 11, p. 160). 
We are now interested 
in the sequence of RV (random 
variables) 
y,,: 
~Lc, N defined by:

According 
to Theorem 
D (p. 234) and to [4a] above for (*), we obtain 
the following 
distribution 
for the C,: 
IN 
(*) 5 (n, k) 
p,(k):=P(C,=k)= 
7, 
where the ~(11, k) are the unsigned Stirling numbers 
of the first kind. Con- 
sequently, 
the GF of the probabilities 
of C, becomes, using [Sf], 
p. 213, 
for (**): 
WI 
g (u) = gc, (u) = -$ pn (k) uk = ; ‘$$ 
uk = 
(*=*I l, II (21 + 1) ‘.. (I1 + 12 - l),

(

We expand [4e] using [2a] (p. 206) for @); then we obtain: 
and by identifying the coefficients of tm/m! 
in [4f]. 
THEOREM 
A. The cumulants of the RV C, defined by [4b] equal: 
k31 
*#?I 
= *~(C.)=l~~~mi(-l)L-l(~-l)!S(n~,~)i”(I)}, 
. 
where S(m, 1) is the Stirling 
number of tlze second kind and 
Thus, by passing to the moments: 
pi = E (C,) = xl = c,(l); 
Pi1 
~Z=varC,=DZ(C,)=x,=5,(1)-5,(2). 
For studying the behaviour of the limit of C,, we state the central limit 
theorem (in very general form due to [Lindeberg, 19221; see, for instance, 
[*Renyi, 
19661, p. 412-21, for a proof): 
THEOREM 
B. Let X,, z be a double sequence of R V, defined for 
n E N and 
(1 < ) i <k,, 
where k, are given integers > 0. We suppose tJzat the variables 
x n, i9 n fixed, 
i variable, 
iE[k”], 
are independent, 
which is fornzula- 
red by saying ‘the X,, i are row-independent’. 
If we define new RV S, and 
Yn,i by:

TJze conclusion [4m] still lzolds when E(S,) and D(S,) are replaced 
by 
eqzrivalent ones, wlzen n + 00. 
The role of the RV S, will be played by C,, [14b], for our application. 
Thus, we have to interpret C, as a sum [4j]. To do this, we define the 
sequence X,, 1 of ro#~-irldepenr~ezzt RV, 1 <i <I?, by: 
[IAnI 
P(X,,i= 
l)= 
l/i, 
p 
Cxn, 
i =O)= 
l- 
l/i. 
The GF of the probabilities 
of’ the X,,i equai yx,,,(uj=(i-- 
! I z)/‘z. 
Thus we get, by [4d] for (*), and by the row-independence for (**ii 
from which follows: 
Furthermore, we show that condition [41] is satisfied by the X,. I. Because

a number 
of orbits 
between 
logn+aJlogn 
and logn+/?Jlogn, 
a<B, 
equals approximately 
n!{@(p)-

We give, rapidly, 
another 
example of RV associated with random 
per- 
mutations. 
We will deal with Z,=Z,(w), 
the number 
of inversions 
of the 
permutation 
w (p. 237). The GF of the probabilities 
is ([lrh],

7.5. THEOREM 
OF RAMSEY 
The Ramsey 
theorem 
generalizes 
the ‘Dirichlet 
pigeon-hole 
principle’: 
If n+ 1 objects are distributed 
over n pigeon holes, at least one pigeon 
hole contains 
at least two objects. It introduces 
a sequence of numbers 
whose computation 
and estimation 
are still among the most fascinating 
problems 
of combinatorial 
analysis.

to colouring

(II) 
Some special values of p(b; p, q) 
First, it is clear that the roles of p, %? and q, 9 are symmetric; 
so:

p(b; P, 4) = p(b; w). 
We also show:

Finally,

I 
We first prove that each finite set N such that II= IN I2q 
is Ramsey- 
(b;p,

there are two

such that %‘=0 to 
see (by !?,?,(N)=(J) 
that N cannot be Ramsey-(0;

H 
Taking 
into account 
[5e, f, g] we suppose from now on that: 
II5111 
l<b<p,q. 
(III) 
Choice of the induction for p(b; p, q) 
Let R(b) 
be the table of the values of the double 
sequence p(b; p, q), 
p, q> 1, bfi,xed > 1, extended by p(b;p, 
q)=O if not 1 <b<p, 
q. We know 
already 
R(l), 
according 
to [Sf]. 
To prove 
the existence of p(b;p, 
q), 
I <c < b - I, we suppose the existence of all the tables R(c) where b is fixed 
32 (-existence 
of all the p(c; p, q), with c< b- I, p, q), as well as the 
existence of: 
PI 
p’:=p(b;p-1,q) 
and 
q’:=p(b;p,q-1) 
in the table R(b). From 
these induction 
hypotheses 
we will deduce now 
the existence of p(b;p, 
q), and simultaneously 
also: 
I31 
P(b;p,q),<l+p(b-l;p’,q’), 
in other words [Sd], because of [Si]. 
WI 
n = INI 2 1 + p(b - 1; p’, q’) 
is Ramsey-(6; 
p, q) (p’, q’ defined in [Si]). 
Let N be such that [5k] holds, and choose XEN, and let M: = N- 
{x}; 
then, by [Sk]: 
[511 
IMI = n - 1 z p (b - 1; p’, q’). 
Now we associate with the division 
%Y+g= 
p,(N) 
the division 
%“+g’= 
=Pbel(M), 
defined 
by: 
[5m] 
V’:= 
(C\(x) 
I CE%?], 
g’:= 
{D\(X) 
I DEg3j. 
According 
to [51], M is Ramsey-(b- 
1; p’, q’), which implies for g 
and

two statements 
is true: 
I31 
There exists an X such that 
X E VP, (M), 
‘$.$,-i (X) 
c %“. 
[501 
There exists an Y such that 
Y E ‘p,, (M), 
!J.&- i (Y) c 9’. 
We suppose now that we are in the case [5n]. 
Because 1x1 =p’:= 
p(b; p-l, 
q), the set Xis 
Ramsey-(b; 
p-l, 
q); hence, we have for the 
division 
V” +.C@” = vPa(X), defined by 
C5Pl 
W:=Vn 
(pb(X), 
W:=Bn

at least one of the following 
two possibilities:

There exists a P’ such that

There exists a Q such that

In the case [Sr], evidently

because XcN; 
hence qb(Q)cg’, 
since 9”c.9, 
[5p]. 
So we have proved 
[5b]. 
In the case [5q], we will show that the set P: = P’u 
{x} satisfies [5a] 
indeed, in other words, that Qb(P)cV. 
We put: 
C5sl 
J,:={BIBEy*(P),x#B}, 
x1 := {B I BEyb(P),xEB}. 
Hence : 
C5tl 
%P)

Wehave&cV; 
this followsfrom: 
(I) &,cq,(P’) 
by definition 
[5s] of 
X,; (2) ‘$3b(P’)cV, 
[Sq]; (3) V’cV, 
[5p]. Similarly 
Xi c%‘, because all

because of [Sq], !@36-1(P’)~~b-1(X); 
hence, by [5n], 
pb-i(P’)cV’; 
consequently, 
by [5m, 
s], KcV. 
Finally, 
[5t] 
implies 
p*(P)cg, 
in 
other words [5a]. 
A similar 
argument, 
mutatis mutandis, 
is carried 
out in the case [50]. 
For the computation 
and the properties 
of the Ramsey numbers, 
we 
refer to several authors who have worked 
on this problem 
([Erdos, 
1947, 
1957-58, 
19641, [Giraud, 
1968a, b, 1969a, b], [Graver,

19681, [Krieger,

7.6. BINARY(BICOLOUR)RAMSEY 
NUMBERS 
In this section we deal with the numbers 
~(2; p, q), [SC] (p. 284) which 
we will denote in the sequel by p(p, q), 2<p, 
q. We give a new definition 
of these numbers 
in terms of graph theory (p. 61). 
Giving 
a division 
into two sets g+S@= q,(N) 
is equivalent 
to giving a 
graph 
9 on N, if we make the convention 
that %?= 9 and g= 
9= 
= !Q2(N)- 
3. Th is is also equivalent 
to painting 
the edges of the complete 
graph $J2(N) 
in blue and white colours, 
that is, painting 
blue the edges 
in Ce, and white the edges in 9. This explains why the numbersp(2; 
p, q)= 
= p(p, q) are called bicolour 
numbers. 
Fig. 56. 
With every graph 
9 on N, we associate the following 
two numbers: 
(I) The number 
c(g), 
which is equal to the maximum 
number 
of elements

number 
of eiements of independenr 
sets % (i.e. compiete subgraphs 
of C?). 
Let now be given two integersp, 
q>O. We say that ‘?? is a (p, q)-graph 
if 
c(g)<p 
and i(S) <q. This means that c?? [or S] does not contain 
a 
complete 
subgraph 
of p elements [or q elements]. 
Hence, the negation 
of [5c] (p. 284) 
can be written: 
16al 
there exists a (p, q)-graph 
9 c $JJz (N) o INI + 1 < p (p, q) , 
and the problem 
becomes that of constructing 
(p, q)-graphs 
with 
the 
largest number 
of vertices, 
thus providing 
a constructive 
procedure 
for 
obtaining 
lower bounds 
for the Ramsey numbers 
p(p, q). 
We will illustrate 
this with the computation 
of ~(3, 3). Inequality 
[5d] 
(p. 284) combined 
with [Sf] (h=2) 
gives: 
[6bl 
P(Pd7)~P(Pdl--1)+P(P- 
194).

This gives, together with p(2,3) =p(3,2) = 3 and [Sg] : 
l&l 
p(3,3) < 6. 
On the other hand, the graph %’ of Figure 56 over N, 1 N I = 5, whose edges 
are indicated by full lines, does not contain any triangle (=complete 
sub- 
graph of 3 elements); the complementary graph neither does (9 is in- 
dicated by dotted lines). Hence, by [Sal: 
[6d] 
p(3,3)>6. 
Together, [6c, d] imply ~(3, 3)=6. 
Below the first values of p(p, q) that are either known or for which 
bounds are known. The table should be completed by symmetry (cf. 
[se], p. 284). For ~(3, 8), f or instance, 27-30 means 27 < p(3,8)<30.

7.7. SQUARES

RELATIONS 
Let A4 be a finite set and a an integer, 1 <a,<m= 
lM[. Determine the 
> 
smallest integer f = f(m, a), such that each k-relation 
% on M, % c M2 
(=M 
xM), 
I%[=k>I , , contains at least one a’-square ([Zarankiewicz, 
19511). This is a product set of the form AA’=,4 
x A’, where A, A’cM, 
IAl =IA’I=a. 
In other words, when %7=2?(a) is the set of a’-squares 
of Ml:

where ‘$3,(M)*: = p,,(M)

Evidently a2 < f<m*. 
We transform [7a] by introducing for each a’-square AA’& 
the set 
of r&4’) 
of the k-relations on M that contain AA’. Hence [7a] is equiv- 
alent with: 
I31 
k 3 E (m, a) - Pk (M’) = (A A ,Uv (M) r (A, A’). 
,‘E.

This will provide us with a lower bound for f.

We define a random 
tournament 
(cf. p. 68) 
Y=Y(o) 
over 
N, INI =n, 
by making 
random 
choices for 
each pair 
(xi, X~}E VP,(N), 
the arcs X~j 
and 
zi 
being 
equiprobable, 
and 
the 
n 
0 2 
choices independent. 
(1) Let C,= C,(w) 
be the number 
of 
3-cycles of Y(w) 
(f or example, {x1,x2, x3}, Figure 18, p. 68, is a 3-cycle.

observe then that E(Xi, j,k)=

(2) More generally, 
let C, be the number 
of k-cycles of Y, then we have

*23. Random partitions 
of a set, mode of S(n, k). With every finite 
set 
N, INI =n, we associate the probability 
space (Q, a, P), where Q is the 
set of partitions 
of N, a:=!@(Q), 
and P(o)= 
l/1521 = l/m(n) 
(p. 210) for 
each partition 
o~sZ. We are now interested 
in the study of the RV 
B,=Bn(w), 
the number of blocks of o. (1) P(B, = k) = S(n, k)/w(n), 
where 
s(n, k) is the Stirling 
number of the second kind (p. 204). The GF of the 
probabilities 
is hence equal to P,(u)/w(n), 
where P,(u): =& 
S(n, k)zlk.

of B, equal:

(4) We have the following 
asymptotic 
result ([Moser, 
Wyman,

[Binet, 
Szekeres, 19571, [*De 
Bruijn,

19721) 
for ReR=n-+co: 
This allows us to verify 
condition 
([41], p. 281) of Lindeberg 
and to apply 
the central limit theorem. 
Deduce from 
this an estimate for sup,S(n,

and for the corresponding 
‘abscissa’ (the ‘mode’)

*24. Random lvords. 
Let X: = {x1, x 2r . . . . x,} be a finite set, or a/phabet, 
1x1 =n. At every epoch t = I, 2, 3 ,..., we choose at random 
a letter from 
3E, each letter having 
the probability 
l/n, and the choices at different 
moments are independent. 
In this way we obtain an infinite 
random 
word 
f, and the section consisting of the first t letters is calledf(t). 
In the sequel 
of this text, T = T(B) is the RV which equals theJrst 
epoch that a certain

(2) The matchboxes 
of Banach. 
A certain 
mathematician 
always carries two matchboxes 
with him. Both contain 
initially 
k matches. Each time he wants a match, 
he draws 
a box at 
random. 
Certainly 
a moment 
will come that he draws an empty box. Let 
R be the RV equal to the number 
of matches left in the other box. Show

If the I letters of g are different, 1 <I <n, then E( T)=l

In the 
general case the ‘periods’ of g play a role ([Solov’ev, 
19661). 
*25. Similarly 
loaded dice. (1) Show that it is not possible to load simi- 
larly two dice in such a way that the total score will be an equidistributed 
RV (on the values 2,3,. . ., 11, 12.) [Hint: 
In the contrary case, use the 
GF of the probabilities to show the existence of x,,, x1, . . ,, xs such that 
(x,t+~,t~+~~~+x.$~)~=K(t~+t~+~~~+t~~+t’~)....] 
(2) The follow- 
ing is a more difficult question (see [Clements, 19681) suggested by the 
preceding. Let x=(x,,, 
x1, . . . . X,)E Rmfl and r an integer >/ 1. We define

questions when the two dice may be independently 
loaded. 
*26. Multicolour 
Ramsey numbers. Let be given integers b, pl, p2,. . . , pk 
such that 
lBb<p,,p,,...,

(b;p,,p,,...,

V,, q2, . . . . V, of

there exists an integer ie[k]

*21. Convex polygons 
who,se vertices form 
a subset of a given poitzt set of 
the plane ([Erdiis, Szekeres, 19351, expIained in [*Ryser, 19631, p. 43, 
and [*Dembowski, 
19651, p. 30). Let N be a finite set of points in the 
plane such that no three among them are collinear, N is general, for 
short. An m-gon extracted from N will be the following: 
a closed poly- 
gonal line .P, not necessarily convex, whose vertices are different and 
belong to N. Such a polygon B is considered as a set of pairs of N (its 
sides), Bc ‘$\Z(N). (1) F rom every general set A, IAl = 5, we can extract a 
convex quadrilateral. 
(2) Let M be a general set, [ M( 24, such that for 
each Q CM, IQ1 =4, one of the three quadrilaterals whose vertex set is Q, 
is convex. Then, there exists a convex m-gon extracted from M, 1 MI = m. 
[Hilrr: 
If not, the convex hull of M would be spanned by less than nz 
points, consequently there would exist a Q whose three quadrilaterals are 
not convex.] (3j Deduce from (1,2j the fo!lowing theorem: For every 
integer m>O there exists an integer f(m) 
such that from every finite 
general set containing at least f(m) points of the plane, a convex m-gon 
can be extracted. [Hint: 
We have f(3) = 3, f(4) = 5; for nt 2 5, apply the 
theorem on p. 283, p--f m, q -+ 5, CR-t-.9= q4(N),

For all integers 11, k>,l, 
we 
put r(h, k): = (/I - l)(k- 
1)-t 1. Let N be a subset with IZ elements of X, 
NcX, 
INI = II, and let q be a map of N into R. We first suppose that 
II= r(h, k). Show that there exists either a subset Hc N, H= 11~1, 
on which 
the restriction of v, is increasing (not necessarily strictly), or a subset 
Kc N, IKl=k, 
on which cp is decreasing (not necessarily strictly). [Hinf:

its degrees exceeding or equalling k (VXEN, 19(x)1 >/ k, p. Gl), contains 
a complete subgraph with p nodes is k > n(p - 2)/(p - 1) ([Turin,

Show that

first observe that the maximum occurs in an interior point of E.] 
*32. Systems of distinct

Let Y:= 
(BI, B,, . . . . B,,} be a 
system of blocks, not necessarily different from N, Bi c N, iE [III]. A block 
M=(xI,xz,..., 
x,,,} c N is called a system of distinct 
representatives, 
abbreviated SDR, if and only if XtEBi for all ic [w]. A necessary and 
sufficient condition that Y admits a SDR is that for every subsystem 
Y’cY 
we havelu 
BEYfB( > I.Y’I. (The preceding statement, due to [Hall 
(P.), 19351, answers in particular the ‘marriage 
problem’: 
m boys know 
a certain number of girls; under what conditions can each boy marry a 
girl he knows already? (One girl may be acquainted with several boys! . . . .) 
See also [Halmos, Vaughan, 19501, [Mirsky,

Argue by complete induction on m, using

If no sub- 
system is critical, take one point XEB,, and remove it from each of the 
blocks B,, I?,,... 
(if it occurs there). Thus we obtain a new system 
B;, B;, . . . . BL,, which can be handled by the induction hypothesis. If there 
exists a critical system, then there exists a largest integer lc such that (after 
changing the indices) I B, u B, u ... u Bkj = k( < 1~) and then we can choose 
a SDR for B,, B2,..., B,, say A,. Then we show next that the system

so has also a SDR, say A,. Hence the required SDR is A,uA1.]

if any two of them are not disjoint. Show 
that the number 191 of blocks of such a system is less than or equal to

Let Y* be the 
system of complements of the blocks of 9, then we have, in the sense of

system (or Kolmogoroff 
system or 
T, system) of N is any system Yc(V’(N) 
such that for all x and yoN, 
x#y, 
there exists either an A such that XEAEYI, 
y$A, 
or a B such that 
~EBEY, 
x$B 
(not exclusive 
or). Compute 
or estimate 
the number 
of 
separating 
systems of N, INI =n. 
*42. Geometries. 
A geometry 
(or 
linear 
system) 
of 
N 
is a system 
.Y’c!B’(N) 
whose blocks, called lines, satisfy the following 
two condi- 
tions: (1) Each pair A c N, IAl =2, is contained 
in precisely one line; (2) 
each line contains at least two points. The following 
are the known values 
of g(n), which is the number 
of geometries 
of N, INI =II, and the numbers 
g*(tt), 
which are the number 
of nonisomorphic 
ones:

Compute:xd

(for n> 10, we have 2”<g*(n)< 
ig(n)<2(“3), 
these inequalities 
and their numerical 
values being due to 
[Doyen, 
19671.) 
*43. S/c/her triple systems. A Steiner triple 
system over N or simply a 
‘triple 
system’, is a set Y’ of triples of N, Y’E !Q3(N), 
such that every pair 

304 
ADVANCED 
COMBINATORICS 
of elements of N is contained in exactly one triple. In the sense of the 
previous exercise, this is a ‘geometry’ in which every line has three points. 
We suppose N finite, INj =n. (1) A necessary and sufficient condition for 
the existence of a triple system is that n is of the form 6k + 1 or 6k + 3. 
(2) Let s(n) denote the number of triple systems (of N), and s*(lr) the 
number of nonisomorphic ones. The known values are:
