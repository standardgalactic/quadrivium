Praise for Lean IT
“A great read on how to apply Lean principles to IT. These tools really work to improve IT’s perfor-
mance and credibility.”
— Niel Nickolaisen, CIO Headwaters, Inc.; co-author of Stand 
Back and Deliver: Accelerating Business Agility
“A groundbreaking synthesis, examining IT operations, project management, software devel-
opment, and governance through a Lean lens. Taut, subtly reasoned, and laced with the kind of 
brilliant insights that only come from practicing masters. Required reading for IT executives, archi-
tects, and project managers.”
— Charles Betz, author of Architecture and Patterns for IT Service Management, 
Resource Planning, and Governance, and practicing Fortune 20 enterprise architect
“A superb primer for anyone interested in learning about Lean.  Their work will help business lead-
ers understand the arcane machinations of IT while giving IT professionals a common language to 
talk to the business.”
David Almond, Administrator, Office of Transformation for the Department 
of Administrative Services; former CIO, Oregon Department of Revenue
“Do most IT organizations waste effort?  They do.  Can this book transform your thinking and 
jumpstart your efforts to eliminate waste and optimize the business value of IT?  You bet!”
Kurt Milne, Executive Director, IT Process Institute
“Finally! A practical Lean transformation blueprint that includes information systems and the IT 
organization, while addressing the essential element of human engagement across the enterprise. 
You can easily digest their lessons and learn how to adapt and apply to your specific organization. 
This is the key to business alignment the IT industry has been searching for.”
Andrew Rome, Talent & Organizational Performance executive 
of an 80,000-person global IT Management firm
“A deft application of Lean concepts and techniques to a central challenge we all face: how to 
increase effectiveness of investments in IT people and systems and the value they bring to enterprise 
processes. Current and aspiring business and IT leaders and managers at all levels of the organiza-
tion will benefit from their in-depth knowledge and broad perspective.”
John Pierce, Vice President, Information Systems, Tripwire, Inc.
“Lean IT is an idea whose time has come, especially now that applications like electronic medical 
records may soon revolutionize health care. Bell and Orzen blend creativity and practicality as they 
show how to improve both information quality and ease—all the while acknowledging that more is 
not always better.”
Naida Grunden, Author, The Pittsburgh Way to Efficient Healthcare: 
Improving Patient Care Using Toyota Based Methods
“This book is long overdue. The IT world needs tools and concepts to be structured in their language 
and approach so they can join the productivity push that manufacturing has already experienced. “
Bill Baker, co-author, Winning the Knowledge Transfer Race

“This book is a must read for not only IT professionals, but business executives as it aligns informa-
tion and information systems throughout the enterprise and supply chain, which improves organi-
zational performance and agility.”
Beth Cudney, Ph.D., Missouri University of Science and Technology; 
author of Using Hoshin Kanri to Improve the Value Stream
“This work integrates the Lean work over the past century and brings it to focus on the IT organiza-
tion to eradicate the very drivers of IT wastes, replacing them with a value driven approach based 
on Lean principles.  This comprehensive book should be required reading for all levels in the IT 
organization.” 
Mark Swets and Tim Schipper, Lean Coaches, Steelcase; 
co-authors of Innovative Lean Development
“From software development to help desk management, business leaders, IT professionals, and 
improvement teams finally have clear and concise answers to the question, ‘Yes, but, how does Lean 
apply to IT?’ Supported by compelling case studies, this outstanding book goes far beyond theory. 
Karen Martin, co-author of The Kaizen Event Planner: Achieving Rapid 
Improvement in Office, Service, and Technical Environments 
“Lean IT takes the game to a new level, particularly in the field of Lean Healthcare, where effective 
information systems are vital.  I suppose I will have to buy multiple copies of this book -- So many 
IT managers in need of Lean education; so little time.”
Tom Jackson, author of Hoshin Kanri for the Lean Enterprise: Developing Competitive 
Capabilities and Managing Profit, winner of the 2007 Shingo Research Prize
“Read it! Learn it! Do it! These pages are meant to be dog-eared, high-lighted, and coffee-stained. 
Within these pages are the keys to unlocking the value of information and information systems.”
Dennis E. Wells, Lean Evangelist, Oregon Department of Human Services
“The authors clearly articulate and demystify the overwhelming challenge of enabling IT processes 
and organizations to embrace rapid change demanded by Lean transformation. Lean IT represents 
an important body of work Lean practitioners desperately need to break through the plateau of 
unending point improvements into sustainable system wide improvements impacting the bottom 
line.”
Rajesh Solanki, Corporate Director for Continuous 
Improvement, RTI International Metals, Inc
“Nearly every week, IT leaders ask me to help clarify their roles in their organizations’ process 
improvement efforts. This book not only answers how and why, it also gives great examples showing 
that it can be done in your organization too!”
Steve Hoeft, Lean Six Sigma Director, Altarum Institute; Lead Instructor, 
Univ. of Michigan Lean Manufacturing, Lean Product Design and Lean 
Healthcare Certification courses; and author of Stories From My Sensei.
“The gap from the implementation of Lean in production processes to office practices now has a 
bridge! Orzen and Bell are visionary showing the value of a fully integrated lean enterprise.”
Elizabeth M. King, Executive Director Organizational Effectiveness, ESCO 
Corporation; Association for Manufacturing Excellence, Director

ἀis book is dedicated to Morton and Rickie Orzen, and Bob and Betty Bell, 
our incredible parents who molded us with their unconditional love.
We also dedicate the concepts and practices within this book to the count-
less dedicated community volunteers, and aid workers with nonprofit and 
nongovernmental organizations around the world. We believe that Lean IT 
not only offers benefits to the industrialized countries, but to the billions of 
individuals in this world living at the bottom of the pyramid, who must do 
more with much less. We hope that Lean IT can help these compassionate 
individuals to harness the power and breadth of low-cost information tech-
nologies to raise the standard and quality of living for all.

Introduction
Today’s IT organization faces a clear imperative: reduce costs while improv-
ing service levels. At the same time, it must assume an active leadership 
role to drive change—continuous improvement, innovation, and agility—
throughout the enterprise, enabling efficient yet flexible business processes 
that create value and establish preference in the eyes of each customer.
How can these potentially competing objectives be satisfied with limited 
resources? For the answer, we turn to the lessons learned from Lean, which 
emerged in manufacturing during the 1950s and has since been embraced 
across every industry. It is now the time for IT to adopt Lean thinking as 
well.
This is the first definitive and comprehensive text on the Lean IT body of 
knowledge, demonstrating how the various aspects of Lean can be applied 
to the continuous improvement of information and information systems 
in order to enable and sustain the Lean enterprise. Written by Lean IT 
pioneers Steve Bell and Mike Orzen, this book distills over 40 years of 
experience in applying Lean principles, systems, and tools to information 
technology across many industries.
This book was written to help you—whether you are a business execu-
tive, manager, IT professional, or member of an improvement team—to 
proactively improve, integrate, align, and synchronize information and 
information systems to enable breakthrough performance and agility.
What Is Lean IT?
Is business process improvement part of Lean IT? What about best prac-
tices and benchmarking? Is agile software development a Lean IT practice? 
What about IT operational excellence and the ITIL service management 
framework? How about performance management dashboards and score-
cards? Is applying Lean techniques to project management considered a 
Lean IT practice? And is cloud computing relevant in a Lean IT world? 

xviii  •  Introduction
The answer to all these questions is yes. But Lean IT is much more than 
just a set of tools and practices; it is a deep behavioral and cultural trans-
formation that encourages everyone in the organization to think differ-
ently about the role of quality information in the creation and delivery 
of value to the customer. Lean IT enables the IT organization to reach 
beyond alignment toward fundamental integration, cultivating an insepa-
rable, collaborative partnership with the business.
Whether you are new to Lean, or a seasoned veteran, in this book you 
will find new insights into the power of Lean and the critical impact of an 
integrated IT function. In this book, Bell and Orzen explore all aspects of 
Lean IT within two primary dimensions:
	
1.	Outward-facing Lean IT: Engaging information, information sys-
tems, and the IT organization in partnership with the business to 
continuously improve and innovate business processes and man-
agement systems
	
2.	Inward-facing Lean IT: Helping the IT organization achieve opera-
tional excellence, applying the principles and tools of continuous 
improvement to IT operations, services, software development, and 
projects
These two dimensions are not separate but complementary, two sides of 
the same coin. They serve the ultimate objective of Lean transformation: 
creating value for the enterprise and its customers.
We begin in Part 1 by exploring the foundations of Lean, and how they 
apply to information, information systems, and the IT organization. Part 
2 then explores the various outward-facing aspects of Lean IT applied to 
business process improvement, supported by an effective Lean manage-
ment system that links strategy with daily work. Part 3 explores inward-
facing issues: how Lean IT improves the performance of IT operations 
and services, software development, and project management, while con-
sidering the implications of a shift toward cloud computing. Part 4 brings 
it all together, with a comprehensive perspective on Lean management 
and governance, offering a Lean IT roadmap to help readers on their own 
transformation journey.
The book concludes with case studies from several Lean leaders: Barry-
Wehmiller, Con-way, Group Health, Ingersoll Rand, Steelcase, Toyota, 
and Virginia Mason Medical Center. Each offers, in their own words, a

practical example of how Lean IT can enable and sustain the Lean enter-
prise transformation.
An ancient proverb says that the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. 
The next best time is right now. So let’s get started.


Section I
Foundation 
What Is Lean IT and 
Why Is it Important?

Why Does Lean IT Matter?
Quality information and effective information systems are vital to the success 
of the modern enterprise. But the magnitude of IT spending on ill-conceived 
or poorly implemented IT projects is staggering. And the dire consequences 
of unstable and inflexible systems, failed projects, and chronic misalignment 
of IT activities with business strategy are unacceptable—and unsustainable.
The portion of the global economy spent on IT is substantial. For exam-
ple, banking and finance enterprises in 2008 spent an average of 6.9 per-
cent of their revenue on IT; this figure is a staggering 4.7 percent in health 
care.1 If you begin with a conservative assumption that just 20 percent of 
these investments do not add significant value to the customer, the num-
bers add up quickly. And beyond the direct waste of IT dollars spent that 
don’t return expected benefits, even more staggering are the consequences 
of poor-quality information and ineffective information systems on the 
productivity and general health of each organization, and by extension to 
the global economy as a whole.
Much is at stake here—clearly IT and the business must significantly 
improve the way they work together toward shared outcomes if they’re 
going to produce ongoing order-of-magnitude improvement. Aligning IT 
with the business has become an all-too-familiar slogan. But what does 
alignment really mean? And what are the consequences when alignment is 
lacking? Let’s hear from both sides.
The Business View
Business responds to change every day. Customers increasingly want more 
choice, speed, and quality, all at a lower total cost, while competitors wage a

perpetual battle to steal market share. In order to succeed in such a dynamic 
and demanding world, business processes and supporting information 
systems must be both stable and responsive to change, always focused on 
delivering value to the customer. Unfortunately they often fall short.
Business perceptions of IT and the IT organization often include the 
following concerns:
•	 Complexity: Information systems are often difficult to use, costly, 
and resistant to change.
•	 Speed: The IT organization is often perceived as slow moving and late 
in responding to high-priority requests.
•	 Misdirection: The IT organization is focused on technical issues 
rather than on solving business problems.
•	 Foreign language: IT speaks a language that business people don’t under-
stand, and IT often doesn’t understand the language of the business.
•	 Information overload: IT generates an overabundance of informa-
tion; many workers suffer from data, e-mail and document waste, 
losing countless productive hours each week.
•	 Project failure: IT projects are sometimes costly, time-consuming, 
late, and disruptive, while failing to deliver expected benefits.
•	 Fragmentation: There are often many disparate, disconnected sys-
tems involved in each business process.
•	 Poor data quality: Data and information are often inaccu-
rate, unreliable, inconsistent, untimely, or, in the worst cases, 
counterproductive.
•	 Inadequate decision support: Users are often frustrated by having too 
much data but not enough useful information, at the right time and 
in the right format, to support informed decisions.
•	 Systems anarchy: Many users attempt to control their own information 
with workarounds, spreadsheets, and homegrown systems, further 
contributing to data fragmentation, redundancy, and poor quality.
•	 Cost focus: IT is often perceived as a back office cost center, not an 
enabler of value creation or a catalyst for innovation.
•	 Unclear return on investment (ROI): The business is often unable to 
measure the ROI of information systems investments, and evaluate 
the quality and effectiveness of IT performance. This uncertainty 
leads to a vague understanding of IT’s true value to the business, 
which in turn leads to uninformed investment decisions.

The IT View
Now let’s consider the other perspective: the IT organization is often 
overloaded, and reactive crisis management behavior is all too common. 
Constant change, shifting priorities, new releases and upgrades, and the 
need to balance existing and emerging technologies, all contribute to an 
untenable mixture of complexity and volatility. There is usually more 
work than IT could ever complete; some companies report three to five-
year backlogs. And through it all, IT is tasked with keeping information 
systems, and the business, up and running at all times, while rigorously 
controlling costs. This often creates the atmosphere of a no-win scenario 
within IT.
Common IT concerns and challenges include:
•	 Endless “firefighting”: The amount of unplanned work often exceeds 
planned work, which is unsatisfying, exhausting, and ultimately 
not sustainable.
•	 Unclear system requirements: End users can’t always articulate what 
they want and often ask for more than they need.
•	 Conflicting priorities: Business stakeholders are often unable to agree 
on priorities, so IT is caught in the middle with unclear goals, bud-
gets, and timelines, having no choice but to pragmatically make 
important priority decisions based on incomplete information.
•	 Lack of engagement: IT is often brought into projects after important 
strategic and tactical business decisions have already been made.
•	 Resource thrashing: Due to unpredictable demand, magnified by 
unclear and shifting priorities, IT staff are frequently switched 
between projects, causing changeover costs, lost productivity, qual-
ity problems, frustration, and fatigue.
•	 Excessive automation: Rather than eliminating or at least simplify-
ing wasteful processes, they are often automated, creating additional 
layers of system complexity and increasing total cost of ownership.
•	 Poor data quality: This creates additional errors, rework, and 
other downstream consequences, and is often caused by lack of 
end user training and documentation, and inadequate process 
design and controls.

6  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
•	 Scheduling of shared resources and services: A constant challenge, 
since specialized resources (human and other assets) are often 
shared among multiple projects and operations, each with compet-
ing priorities, causing bottlenecks and scheduling delays.
•	 Regulatory requirements: These can add layers of non-value-adding 
activity. The business often focuses on after-the-fact reporting and 
control measures, rather than creating high-quality, consistent, and 
naturally compliant processes to begin with.
•	 Outsourcing: The business may believe that outsourcing administra-
tive processes and IT services will reduce costs. However, decision 
makers may not fully understand the distinction between commod-
ity processes and those that offer competitive differentiation and 
strategic advantage, nor realize that outsourcing may have unin-
tended consequences by restricting agility.
•	 Budget constraints: There is a natural tendency to focus on IT cost 
cutting, rather than waste reduction—emphasizing value creation, 
innovation, and enterprise performance improvement.
What Causes IT and Business Misalignment?
The business and IT organization each have a long list of concerns and 
challenges—pain they feel every day. While Lean thinking stresses that 
every problem is an opportunity for improvement, business and IT stake-
holders often have difficulty finding common ground, or even speaking 
a common language. As a result, over the years we have observed that IT 
organizations are often not aligned or synchronized with the business in 
supporting the continuous improvement of business processes. In fact, IT 
organizations can become isolated from the business operations they sup-
port, losing trust and respect.
Furthermore, because of the complex, volatile, and often risky informa-
tion systems environment, traditional IT change management moves at a 
slow pace. System changes are deployed in carefully planned test-and-release 
cycles in an effort to prevent unplanned downtime and business disruption. 
This cautious approach to change inhibits business agility, and hinders the 
rapid, iterative, and continuous improvement of business processes.

Why Does Lean IT Matter?  •  7
What is at the heart of this disconnect between IT and the business? In 
our experience, the lack of integration and synchronization between the 
business and IT is caused by unnecessary complexity.
The world is becoming increasingly complex, and large enterprises 
have been drawn into ever more intricate circumstances. Global supply 
chains, the Internet, intense competition, business combinations, regu-
lation, and security have led to increased necessary complexity. Small 
and medium-sized businesses are not immune to this trend, as they 
are often drawn into these same global business networks. Their busi-
ness processes are often no less complicated than those of their larger 
counterparts, yet they often lack the IT sophistication and budgets to 
address them.
Beyond the challenge of necessary complexity, there is an enormous 
amount of unnecessary complexity—self-inflicted pain—arising from the 
inappropriate design of business processes and supporting information sys-
tems. Lean practitioners call this the waste of overprocessing: excessive work 
where cost and complexity exceed the benefits. The human mind has a natu-
ral tendency to make things more complicated than they need to be. While 
business processes and supporting information systems are naturally com-
plex to some degree, if stakeholders do not deliberately and continuously 
simplify and improve them, they naturally degenerate over time, becoming 
more and more complex, costly to maintain, and difficult to use. 
Overdesign is often the result of a predisposition toward technology and 
automation, rather than exercising the discipline to first simplify and stan-
dardize underlying business processes. This tendency becomes magnified 
when system designers are eager to deploy the latest technology, or enthu-
siastically develop elaborate solutions to potentially simple problems. The 
problem is further aggravated when unnecessarily complex information 
systems are applied to unnecessarily complex business processes; a com-
pounding effect of waste (muda squared)* results. In this perfect storm, the 
unnecessary complexity of processes and their non-value-adding automa-
tion feed on each other—fueling a self-perpetuating cycle that can only be 
broken when business process owners and members of the IT organiza-
tion work together as partners to simplify and improve processes before 
applying technology interventions.
*	 Muda is a common Lean term, the Japanese word for waste, and represents any non-value-adding 
activity or obstruction to the smooth flow of work processes.

8  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Seasoned Lean practitioners know, often through firsthand experience, 
that many transformation efforts fail to sustain themselves over time, 
as organizations gradually fall back on old habits and familiar medioc-
rity. For a variety of reasons, the IT organization is often not proactively 
included in the Lean transformation process. Due to the interdependent 
nature of process improvement and IT change management, and because 
the execution of business processes frequently relies on technology, the 
lack of IT involvement in Lean initiatives is a common contributing factor 
for the deterioration of many otherwise sustainable improvements. Put 
another way, how could an enterprise successfully transform itself without 
addressing the role of quality information systems, and the active partici-
pation of the IT organization?
For this reason, we believe the next evolutionary step for many organi-
zations, and the next frontier of Lean across all industries, is the advance-
ment of Lean IT practices to enable and sustain enterprise transformation.
How Lean IT Encourages Alignment 
and Creates Value
A Lean enterprise should empower teams to simplify, then when appro-
priate, automate routine tasks. Process improvement frees up capacity, 
providing individuals with more time and better information to exercise 
problem solving, creativity, and innovation in situations that are not rou-
tine. Early in the transformation effort, teams are often exhilarated when 
they realize they can streamline or even eliminate a frustrating process—
one that has always been justified by saying, “That’s just the way we’ve 
always done it.”
Once improvement efforts gain momentum and the low-hanging fruit 
has been harvested, business and IT stakeholders work together to address 
the tougher issues that align strategy with daily activity throughout the 
organization. This naturally encourages the development of enterprise 
alignment in three dimensions:
	
1.	Vertically aligning strategy up and down the hierarchal organiza-
tion—from the boardroom through each geographic region, division, 
location, and department so everyone understands how their daily 

Why Does Lean IT Matter?  •  9
activities support the shared mission, strategy, goals, and objectives 
of the organization.
	
2.	Horizontally aligning stakeholders across every functional silo, pro-
cess, and project—emphasizing the flow of value to the customer, 
rather than suboptimization of the individual process steps within 
traditional department or workgroup boundaries.
	
3.	Vertically and horizontally aligning information systems—both 
manual and computerized—ensuring that IT enables the organiza-
tion’s strategy and adds value to business processes, projects, and 
management systems. Synchronized vertical and horizontal align-
ment is the balance point for IT-enabled process improvement.
While opportunities for alignment may arise spontaneously during 
kaizen (continuous improvement) activities, orchestrating and sustaining 
alignment require a disciplined and systemic approach—a Lean manage-
ment system, a topic we will describe and explore throughout this book. 
According to Womack and Jones in their classic Lean ἀinking, “Our 
advice, based on years of experience, is that every organization should 
carefully team a system builder with each of its revolutionary change 
agents in order to sustain results.”2
More important than process improvement tools, lasting transforma-
tion requires effective management systems that prioritize work and align 
daily activities with those goals and objectives that are most important 
to the organization. In Lean, the focus of management is to create stable 
processes and standardized work which consistently deliver value to the 
customer. For a Lean management system framework to be effective, it 
must be simple to understand and execute, providing guidance while not 
getting in the way. It cannot be too controlling or rigid; otherwise, it will 
suppress creativity and learning, hindering improvement and innovation. 
And finally, an effective Lean management system must be supported by 
quality information.
Lean IT and sustainable Lean enterprise transformation are the result of 
collaborative problem solving guided by strategic intent. How is this lofty 
aspiration achieved? Let’s start with a working definition of Lean IT that 
we will build upon throughout this book:
Lean IT engages people, using a framework of Lean principles, systems, 
and tools, to integrate, align, and synchronize the IT organization with the 

10  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
business to provide quality information and effective information systems, 
enabling and sustaining the continuous improvement and innovation of 
processes. Lean IT has two aspects: outward facing, supporting the con-
tinuous improvement of business processes, and inward-facing, improving 
the performance of IT processes and services.
Moving Forward
For many years, Gartner (a global IT research firm) has been asking chief 
information officers (CIOs) to identify their top priorities. As you can 
see in Figure 1.1, businesses want IT to drive growth and value through 
alignment. But now, in the increasingly fast-paced and competitive global 
economy, organizations are turning to the IT organization as partners in 
change leadership.
Information, information systems, and the IT organization are tightly 
interwoven within the fabric of virtually every business process of the 
modern organization. IT does matter in the never-ending, always chang-
ing race for competitive advantage.
This is especially true as many IT infrastructure and commodity ser-
vices shift to a scalable, low-cost, cloud-computing model. In this approach 
to information systems delivery, with utility-based infrastructure and ser-
vice-based applications, the business will begin paying for functional util-
ity rather than infrastructure. This will shift a significant portion of annual 
IT funding from the capital budget to variable expenditures, potentially 
making each investment decision more aligned with the business process 
it serves. Along with this shift, the business will expect change capability

to be more rapid, less disruptive, and at a lower cost. The IT organiza-
tion must therefore cultivate a clear focus on business process leadership, 
maintaining the appropriate balance between efficiency and flexibility … 
also known as agility.
Sustainable information systems improvement and innovation can-
not be achieved with a focus on technology alone. The Lean IT journey 
depends on continuously improving people, process, and technology, in that 
order. Eiji Toyoda, who retired as chairman of Toyota in 1994, sponsored 
Toyota’s legendary Lean transformation beginning in the 1950s. He suc-
cinctly explained the relationship of people, process, and technology in 
the Lean journey:
Society has reached the point where one can push a button and be imme-
diately deluged with technical and managerial information. This is all very 
convenient, of course, but if one is not careful there is a danger of losing 
the ability to think. We must remember that in the end it is the individual 
human being who must solve the problems.4*

which emerged in post World War II Japan—for a more comprehensive timeline of continuous 
improvement evolution see Chapter 2. At the time of this publication, Toyota is under intense 
public scrutiny for quality and safety concerns. In late 2009, just as this issue found its way into 
the public spotlight, the new President, Akio Toyoda, admitted that Toyota had lost their way in 
the late 1990s. Their focus on quality and customer satisfaction gave way to ambition for growth, 
global market share and profitability. Throughout this book we focus on Lean principles, systems, 
and tools that helped Toyota through their 50-year ascendancy in the global auto market. These 
same principles and tools have helped many companies in other industries as well. It is clear that 
even the venerable Toyota cannot violate their own principles without consequences.

Foundations of Lean
Chapter Objectives
To create a shared foundation for our discussion of Lean IT, in this chapter 
we will:
•	 Review a brief history of business process improvement, culminat-
ing in Lean.
•	 Establish the foundational principles of a lasting transformation of 
culture and performance.
•	 Explore the concepts of value and waste in relation to Lean problem-
solving tools, concepts, and terminology.
A Brief History of Continuous Improvement
Since its beginnings at the turn of the twentieth century, business pro-
cess improvement has focused on solving problems to improve effi-
ciency, productivity, and quality. We view the evolution of process 
improvement as occurring in three distinct stages: scientific manage-
ment, engagement, and integration.
The Age of Scientific Management: 1890–1940
Beginning in the late 1800s, business pioneers Frederick Taylor, Frank and 
Lillian Gilbreth, Henry Ford, and others ushered in an era of efficiency and 

14  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
productivity by introducing standardized manufacturing methods, simpli-
fied work, and division of labor. Beginning in 1918, Walter Shewhart pio-
neered the use of statistical control to improve quality. During this era, 
emphasis on output drove significant gains in productivity—for instance, 
Taylor at Midvale Steel Company (1878–1890) achieved gains greater than 
300 percent—but also left workers uninspired with tedious, repetitive tasks.
During these early process improvement efforts, workers were consid-
ered to be property and treated as such. Command and control was the 
established management system, in which workers were seen as inter-
changeable resources, hired for their hands, not their minds. Those in 
management positions solved problems and were paid to think, while 
workers were expected to follow orders and meet output quotas.
The Age of Engagement: 1940–1995
World War II necessitated a massive shift in industrial productivity that 
could not be achieved using the existing system of management or the 
prevailing methods of process improvement. The U.S. Department of 
War introduced an innovative program, Training within Industry (TWI), 
which promoted worker participation, productivity-driven problem 
solving, supervisor training, work process documentation, and ongoing 
improvement programs that accelerated output and enhanced quality.
During this period, the ideas of W. Edwards Deming, Joseph Juran, and 
Armand Feigenbaum broke new ground introducing respect for work-
ers, quality at the source, employee development, team problem solv-
ing, and listening to customers to define value. The Quality Movement, 
as it became known, shifted the primary focus of process improvement 
from productive efficiency to delivering value to the customer. After the 
war, Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo at Toyota, and others in Japan, 
embraced the ideas of quality and continuous improvement and devel-
oped the Toyota Production System—laying the groundwork for mod-
ern-day Lean.
The 1980s were a time of competing methodologies as organizations 
experimented with various methods of continuous improvement. Six 
Sigma was introduced during this time and quickly became the poster 
child of process improvement, with successes at Motorola, Allied Signal, 
GE, and many other companies. Six Sigma applied statistical rigor to 
improvement processes and emphasized the quantification of results in

terms of dollar savings. With the publication of ἀe Goal by Eli Goldratt in 
1992,1 the Theory of Constraints also became popular, demonstrating that 
bottlenecks could be exploited to pace production, focus improvement 
efforts, and significantly boost throughput. Then in 1990, ἀe Machine 
ἀat Changed the World was published by Womack, Jones, and Roos at 
MIT.2 This book examined the Toyota Production System and introduced 
the term Lean. (For a detailed discussion of how Six Sigma and Lean can 
effectively work together, see Appendix B.)
Reengineering the Corporation,3 published in 1993, popularized busi-
ness process reengineering (BPR) emphasizing process improvement and 
encouraging companies to abandon outdated systems, methods, and pro-
cesses that no longer serve their purpose. While this was well intentioned, 
instead of engaging workers, it often was misunderstood and misapplied 
to justify  downsizing. While the Age of Engagement experimented with 
the central idea of engaging people to drive continuous improvement, we 
still have a long way to go to achieve Deming’s vision as too many compa-
nies still do not engage the hearts and minds of their people.
Note to the reader: For the remainder of this book, unless otherwise 
stated, we will use the term continuous improvement to embody all 
improvement disciplines, including Lean, Total Quality Management, Six 
Sigma, the Theory of Constraints, and the Toyota Production System.
The Age of Integration: 1996–Present
By the mid-1990s, companies around the globe were beginning to apply 
Lean, Six Sigma, and other improvement methods beyond the factory 
floor to office and administration, supply chain, accounting, and software 
development. Nonmanufacturing industries quickly discovered that Lean 
manufacturing techniques could produce significant results. Trading 
partners were enlisted to develop integrated processes throughout the 
supply chain. Advances in computing functionality, speed, and cost 
further supported the integration of business systems and communica-
tions. In 1996, Lean ἀinking4 was published, emphasizing integration of 
improvement across value streams, unleashing the current age of integra-
tion of improvement methods across all functions of the business, and in 
all industries, including health care, insurance, banking, and nonprofits.
For an in-depth discussion of the history of continuous improvement, see 
Appendix A. For a timeline of continuous improvement, see Figure 2.1.

Lean Principles
Many companies and individuals implementing Lean make the mistake 
of becoming preoccupied with specific tools. When properly applied, 
tools are performance enablers, but it is the principles embedded within 
the culture of an organization that compel long-term behavioral change. 
Without a clear grasp of Lean principles, focus on Lean tools is like sail-
ing a ship without a rudder. Companies that fail to anchor their continu-
ous improvement efforts with principles rather than tools may experience 
short-term localized results, but will not achieve the broad acceptance 
needed for sustained improvement. The Shingo Prize for Operational 
Excellence* emphasizes this primacy of principles over tools:
As organizations begin a Lean transformation, it is usually at the Tools 
& Techniques level in specific areas of the organization. Ideally, the Lean 
journey then proceeds to the Systems level, creating a more integrated 
and sustained improvement model. Eventually all employees throughout 
all business processes develop a deeper understanding of principles (the 
*	 In 1988, the Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence was established to acknowledge Shigeo 
Shingo’s contribution to continuous improvement, promote awareness of Lean concepts, and rec-
ognize companies that achieve world-class status in Lean manufacturing and business processes. 
The philosophy of the Shingo Prize is that world-class performance for quality, cost, and delivery 
can be achieved through consistent application of Lean principles and tools in all business pro-
cesses. See www.shingoprize.org.

‘know why’), empowering the organization to develop and deploy specific 
methodologies and practices unique to the organization.5
Principles are timeless, whereas tools evolve as needs change. 
Organizations which emphasize principles over tools significantly increase 
the likelihood of a successful transformation. By contrast, organizations 
that fall in love with certain tools (e.g., 5S and value stream mapping) 
may fail to establish the principles that form the bedrock of sustainable 
Lean performance. Eventually, the initial enthusiasm for Lean subsides, 
improvements become more challenging as the remaining problems get 
tougher, and there is nothing to fall back on to sustain long-term change.
In Principle-Centered Leadership, Dr. Stephen Covey stresses the need 
for organizations to embrace core principles which serve as a compass, 
providing constancy of purpose and alignment of organizational goals 
and actions. According to Covey, the most successful companies estab-
lish objective, steadfast principles which reflect timeless values that guide 
behavior and foster a unique culture.6 When principles are borrowed from 
another company, they are easily discarded as soon as they become incon-
venient to live up to. Companies should develop their own principles based 
on shared values and beliefs, and nurture them as consistent attitudes 
and behaviors. The following ideas are a compilation of central tenets we 
have seen successfully applied in support of lasting Lean transformations. 
Our discussion of Lean principles begins at the base of the pyramid (see 
Figure 2.2), laying a solid foundation. Experience has shown three ele-
ments that support a strong social structure for a Lean enterprise.
Constancy of Purpose
•	 ἀeme: Leadership provides the direction and clarity we need to focus 
on the things that matter most—what Deming called “Constancy of 
Purpose,” maintaining clarity on important long-term objectives. 
This is the cornerstone in the principles pyramid because it provides 
the persistent direction needed to influence behavior. When daily 
behaviors change, culture also changes.*
*	 See Out of the crisis by W. Edwards Deming.

18  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
•	 ἀe issue: In many organizations, there is a lack of clarity concern-
ing what matters most. We like to ask various people at our client 
sites, “What are the goals of the company, and how do they influ-
ence your daily work?” We typically receive a variety of answers. 
Two important issues often become apparent: (1) there is a wide 
range of understanding of company goals, and (2) goals are at best 
indirectly aligned with the concerns and actions of individuals and 
workgroups. This manifests as a lack of coordination within depart-
ments and between various functional areas, accompanied by coun-
terproductive or conflicting performance measures and incentives. 
Activity is often mistaken for productivity and is not necessarily 
effective in supporting the organization’s strategy or adding cus-
tomer value.

responsibility that cannot be delegated. Management should adopt a 
visible and active role in supporting change. As people are encour-
aged to challenge the way we do things around here and begin to 
perceive difficulties as opportunities for improvement, collabora-
tive problem solving, and ownership of process quality starts to take 
root.
	
	
At this critical time, the way management reacts to setbacks 
either reinforces proactive behavior or discourages it. Effective lead-
ers embrace an essential truth: poor processes—not people—are the 
cause of most problems. For most of his career, Deming put forth the 
85/15 rule, suggesting that 85 percent of problems were inherent to 
process design and not controlled by the people doing the work. He 
later revised the estimate to 96 percent.
A clear understanding that Lean is about fixing processes, not peo-
ple, creates the tone for fact-based improvement. In this atmosphere, 
people move out of their comfort zones, and actively seek out problems 
as opportunities to make things better. Every successful Lean trans-
formation we have witnessed has been led by a champion who pro-
vided the focus, enthusiasm, and drive that inspired others to move 
beyond business as usual. This role can be filled by an executive spon-
sor, a program manager, or any person in your organization who pos-
sesses credibility and respect. Early successes inspire others to become 
involved and build momentum. Gandhi said it best: “Be the change 
you wish to see.”
To be effective, leadership should be balanced with employee-driven 
participation. In a process known as strategy deployment,* leaders estab-
lish objectives (top-down) and employees determine how to best accom-
plish and measure them (bottom-up).
Some organizations often manage in a hierarchal, top-down manner 
with management at the top of the pyramid, issuing commands down-
ward. Lean inverts this pyramid, as shown in Figure 2.3. At the very top 
are customers and business partners, since they define value and create 
demand pull signals that trigger work to be performed. Next are the work-
ers, who most frequently interact with those customers, vendors, and 
*	 Strategy deployment (also known as policy deployment, hoshin kanri, and hoshin planning) is a 
management system to align daily work with strategy. See Chapter 6.

trading partners and are, thus, in the best position to directly identify 
those actions that add the most value.
Management’s role is to translate and communicate purpose, strategy, 
and goals throughout the organization to teams and workers. Prioritization 
of improvements and consensus is achieved through a back-and-forth dia-
logue between management and employees that aligns strategy and action 
at each level, reconciling action plans with available resource capacity. 
Rather than being told what to do, the people closest to the customer and 
the work develop and implement ideas for improvement based on a clear 
understanding of how their actions support company objectives.
Summary: Executive leadership’s responsibility is to define strate-
gic goals and create a constancy of purpose. Management’s role 
is to eliminate barriers to success, stabilize processes, and sup-
port employees to develop problem-solving skills, so they can take 
ownership of their work and assume responsibility for continuous 
improvement. When considering potential areas of improvement, 
the alternatives are almost endless, so an important enabler of effec-
tive leadership is a formal decision-making framework. This estab-
lishes clear priorities and ensures consistent choices are made when 
selecting improvement projects. Alignment and prioritization are 
consistent themes throughout this book, and we’ll revisit constancy 
of purpose in Chapter 10.

Respect for People
•	 ἀeme: The second foundation principle is respect for people. All 
individuals possess a unique collection of experience and insight, 
and can make a distinctive contribution when they participate in 
process improvement. Cross-functional problem solving can only 
occur when respect for people is consistently applied throughout 
all levels of the organization. Respect drives employee development, 
encourages participation, and improves supplier, customer, and 
community relations.
•	 ἀe issue: When people sense that their input is disregarded or 
not respected, they tend to withdraw their support, concern, and 
active participation. Even worse, they may become cynical or 
even confrontational from having been left out of the dialogue. 
If leaders don’t engage the people doing the work with genuine 
respect, change for the better has little chance of succeeding. This 
is because those who have the knowledge and ability to create last-
ing improvement have no stake in the final outcome. Worse yet, 
organizations lose the creativity and innovative potential each 
person offers.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? Respect for people 
unlocks personal excellence and creative potential. In a collabora-
tive learning environment, people know their ideas are valued and 
appreciated. Those individuals actually doing the work see potential 
improvement opportunities at a deeper level than anyone else in the 
organization. They hold the insight, understanding, and passion to 
add value and drive daily improvement. In some workers, these skills 
are dormant from lack of use.
Good leaders tap into this inexhaustible resource by mentoring, 
coaching, and collaborating with their associates, seeking their opin-
ions and respecting differing points of view. Lean transformation 
requires the input, support, and active participation of everyone in the 
organization. Lean organizations cultivate collaborative problem solv-
ing where people become scientific thinkers, learning from successes 
as well as failing forward from mistakes and setbacks. Questioning the 
way we’ve always done it is not only accepted, but also respected and 
positively acknowledged.

Humility is a very effective catalyst for a culture of continuous improve-
ment, embodied in the Japanese term hansei, meaning mindfulness and 
self-reflection. Everyone in the organization must feel safe about sharing 
ideas and taking experimental risks, confident of not being ridiculed. 
Experimental risk is feeling comfortable enough to try new ways of doing 
things—approaching them as a means to validate new ideas, understand-
ing, and predictions. Experiments never fail because they provide new 
evidence, clues to be used to develop further improvements! When we 
come to accept that every process can be improved, and that everyone 
brings a unique set of life experiences and perceptions to the table, people 
begin to appreciate that a good idea can come from anyone and that ideas 
have no rank.
Summary: Respect for people taps into an unlimited reserve of creativ-
ity by treating every individual with consideration and regard. Give 
your people a good reputation to live up to.
Continuous Improvement and the Pursuit of Perfection
•	 ἀeme: The final building block in our foundation is the continuous 
pursuit of perfection. Today’s solutions, while they may be adequate, 
are at best temporary. Change is relentless, and new ideas are needed 
whenever current standard work no longer produces acceptable 
results. In a Lean culture, workers embrace change as inescapable 
(and even desirable), proactively meeting challenges. Every individ-
ual should see his or her job as having two inseparable components: 
daily work and daily improvement.
Changing social norms and daily behavior involves shifting the tone 
of the workplace from reactive firefighting (a deeply ingrained reflex 
often based on emotion) to proactive problem solving (methodical 
rational behavior).
•	 ἀe issue: We are all creatures of habit and naturally territorial. 
Most people like change, but they don’t like being changed. Effective 
change is usually disruptive and uncomfortable. Left to our own 
human nature, we fall into patterns of thinking and behavior that 
actually avoid change and stifle creativity and innovation. When 

Foundations of Lean  •  23
Lean is perceived as a program or project (with a beginning and an 
end point), people may assume it is just another management fla-
vor of the month that will blow over. They may then decide the best 
course of action is to keep your head down and ride low in the middle 
of the pack until the storm passes. Without active engagement and 
constant reinforcement, we naturally fall back on old habits of think-
ing and behavior.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? When we collectively 
recognize that if we are not improving we are falling behind, our 
understanding of daily work undergoes a radical shift. This realiza-
tion breathes fresh ideas and energy into the organization, inspir-
ing us to continually reinvent ourselves. With a constant focus on 
improvement, we avoid falling into patterns of stagnation in our 
daily behavior.
In ἀe Fifth Discipline,7 Peter Senge uses the term learning organization 
to describe an environment where people continually develop their abilities 
to understand complexity and improve shared understanding. Setbacks 
and failures are treated as opportunities to reflect and learn. Perhaps 
most importantly, learning organizations encourage systems thinking—
the ability to comprehend and focus on the whole while understanding 
the interrelationship of the parts. Each individual must begin identifying 
with the organization’s overall purpose and mission as well as individual 
department, workgroup, project, and process-level goals. The pursuit of 
perfection requires companies to become learning organizations where a 
trial-and-discovery method of process improvement is embraced without 
fear of reprimand or ridicule.
The pursuit of perfection is often misunderstood—it’s an aspiration, but 
one that is never achieved. Voltaire said, “The perfect is the enemy of the 
good.” With Lean, whether in the factory, the office, or the IT organiza-
tion, we should avoid over-automating or striving for the hyper-efficiency 
of a “perfect solution”—these ultimately create waste and rigidity, and 
resist further cycles of improvement.
Summary: The endless quest for excellence stimulates everyone in the 
organization to make things better. People no longer see a difference 
between performing the work they do, improving the work they do, 
and improving themselves.

Proactive Behavior
•	 ἀeme: Building on our foundation, proactive behavior means tak-
ing the initiative, assuming personal responsibility for the quality of 
our work and work environment. Being proactive means seizing the 
opportunity to make a difference every day.
•	 ἀe issue: Why do the vast majority of companies fail to achieve a 
sustaining Lean transformation? Perhaps one reason is that many 
people in the business world tend to be seasoned firefighters but 
poor police officers. Stereotypically, firefighters react to problems* 
by rushing into burning buildings and attacking everything that 
may be an issue (flames and smoke). They live on adrenaline dur-
ing periods of intense focus until the crisis passes, and accept (even 
sometime enjoy) emergencies as part of normal operations. Police 
officers, by contrast, are methodical proactive problem solvers who 
walk the beat investigating the current situation to determine root 
causes of problems. Their focus is long term, systematic, preventa-
tive, and disciplined. They ask lots of questions and shoot only when 
necessary.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? In ἀe 7 Habits of 
Highly Effective People, Dr. Stephen Covey introduces a model called 
the Time Management Matrix, dividing work into four quadrants 
based on importance and urgency. He points out that the highest 
value-added work lies in the Important but Not Urgent quadrant, 
where proactive planning, prevention, preparation, learning, and 
development occur. Unplanned work focuses on issues that are 
either Important and Urgent (reactive firefighting) or Not Important 
and Urgent (deceptive activities that seem important due to their 
urgency). In either case, they steal time and resources that should be 
used to proactively address Important but Not Urgent work.
*	 Our hats go off to real firefighters, some of the bravest and most proactive thinkers we know. In 
this example, we are talking about the common label of firefighting as a behavior.

Foundations of Lean  •  25
Established culture often reinforces reactive firefighting at the cost of dis-
ciplined problem solving. Because firefighting is highly rewarded, some 
firefighters become very good arsonists. This unconscious behavior cre-
ates a never-ending cycle of interruptions and interventions which intro-
duce more instability. Cultural DNA8 strongly influences organizations 
to revert to reactive behavior when problems arrive and the pressure is 
on. Ironically, reactive behavior usually introduces waste and creates more 
problems than it solves—actually preventing sustained progress.
As shown in Figure 2.4, Lean shifts the emphasis away from unplanned 
work to proactive continuous improvement. This approach is effective 
because it feeds itself: as more time is invested in process improvement 
efforts, less unplanned incidents occur, which frees additional time to 
work on more proactive improvements.
Summary: Deming described quality as “pride of workmanship.” 
Proactive behavior requires both personal and team pride combined 
with discipline. We then take responsibility for solving problems and 
strive for quality at the source.

The next level in our pyramid addresses awareness, with three essential 
perspectives embraced by the Lean enterprise: voice of the customer, qual-
ity at the source, and systems thinking.

Tinking
•	 ἀeme: Lean thinkers always ask, “What does the customer value, 
want, and need?” By understanding how customers and information 
system users define value, they position themselves to begin with the 
end in mind.
•	 ἀe issue: It is imperative that organizations develop a clear under-
standing of what customers care about most. Often they assume they 
know what customers desire, and as a result deliver products and 
services that fail to address real customer needs.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? Most processes have 
both internal customers who receive work output and external 
customers (trading partners and end users) who receive products, 
services, and information. To clearly understand the voice of the 
customer, you must engage with your customers, whoever they are. 
Use customer segmentation, interviews, focus groups, surveys, sales 
and service data analysis, and point-of-use observation to develop 
critical-to-quality requirements. Then return regularly to the cus-
tomer to ensure improvements and innovations deliver what the 
customer values most.
Summary: Consistently listening to the voice of the customer ensures 
you are focusing on the right issues and making improvements that 
will be valued by your current and future customers. Understanding 
customer needs and desires more clearly than your competition will 

Foundations of Lean  •  27
enable you to be more responsive and agile, creating competitive 
advantage and market leadership.
Quality at the Source
•	 ἀeme: Quality at the source means doing it right the first time, 
every time: imperfect work is not sent to the next operation or to the 
customer.
•	 ἀe issue: The we’ll fix it later approach is accepted in many orga-
nizations due to time pressure, inadequate training, and a lack of 
understanding of the entire process. The best time to solve a prob-
lem is at the time it occurs because evidence is fresh, workers are 
engaged, and it prevents the release of additional defects until the 
root cause of the problem is corrected. The focus of daily work should 
be producing quality at the source. Solely focusing on quickly work-
ing through the backlog results in the same problems reemerging 
time and time again. Time-consuming corrections, clarifications, 
and completions become necessary when quality is poor, creating 
interruptions and delays which increase costs and aggravation.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? In a Lean environ-
ment, there is an obligation to stop and fix problems, and a shared 
commitment to avoid passing known defects downstream toward 
the customer. By applying standardized work, training, and error 
proofing, every effort is made to ensure the problem or defect is pre-
vented the next time. People assume responsibility for the quality of 
the work they pass on, regardless of where the problem originated. 
This fundamental change in attitude reduces waste and frustration. 
More importantly, problems become the evidence used to detect root 
causes and prevent their recurrence.
Summary: When quality at the source takes hold, more time is avail-
able to do the work customers are paying for, which in turn improves 
productivity, cost, quality, and morale.
Systems Thinking
•	 ἀeme: The third element of awareness is systems thinking—the 
ability to view the interconnected processes that make up the entire 

28  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
value stream while being aware of the cause-and-effect interdepen-
dencies that either add value or create waste. A value stream is com-
prised of all processes, tasks, and activities used to bring a product 
or service from concept to customer, and includes all information, 
work, and material flows.
•	 ἀe issue: To avoid solutions that create localized optimization 
and silo behavior, Lean thinking requires an awareness of the 
simultaneously integrated and interdependent nature of all busi-
ness functions and underlying information flows. This is not the 
way our minds and our organizations naturally work; we tend to 
focus on specific pieces of a puzzle rather than the entire picture. 
Inappropriate measures and incentives often reinforce this narrow 
focus.
•	 How does the principle address this challenge? When problem solv-
ing is founded on a clear understanding of the overall value stream 
and the customers it serves, companies avoid the common error of 
making local improvements which often transfer inefficiencies and 
waste from one area to another. Cross-functional teams provide the 
breadth of understanding required for systems thinking, spanning 
the value stream by connecting the expertise and understanding of 
each team member.
The holistic perspective needed here may be unfamiliar to many pro-
fessionals because they have spent their careers honing skills in a special-
ized area (e.g., engineering, IT, finance, and human resources). A systems 
mind-set stimulates the creative potential of employees by broadening 
their horizons and challenging the breadth of their perception. To make 
improvements that impact external customers, a value stream must be 
viewed as a system. Value stream mapping and systems thinking are 
complementary, helping people to view business processes in a new con-
text: flow.
Summary: Systems thinking enables us to see the whole, creating a 
smooth flow of value to the customer.

Flow/Pull/JIT
•	 ἀeme: The next level of the pyramid focuses on flow—the unin-
terrupted progression of materials, services, and information. As 
Jeffrey Liker emphasizes in ἀe Toyota Way, “Flow where you can, 
pull where you must.”9 Allow work to flow whenever you can; when 
flow is interrupted, use pull signals to initiate work.
•	 ἀe issue: Poor flow of work manifests as interruptions, delays, rework, 
and cost. Deficient information flow causes even more irregular flow 
of materials, work in process, and finished work inventory where it 
is common to have too much (overstock) or too little (shortage). In 
an office environment, inventory is usually composed of paper and 
electronic documents, including e-mail. Work in process is all work 
started but not finished plus work queued up for the next process. 
As a general rule, the more work in process there is, the less work is 
able to flow, and the more slowly work is completed. Work in process 
inventory causes congestion, confusion, and delays; hides problems; 
must be managed and tracked; often becomes obsolete; and is often 
reworked or discarded. This in turn creates further interruptions, 
delays, rework, and cost.
•	 How does the principle address the issue? Flow is achieved through 
eliminating delays and interruptions throughout the entire value 
stream. Value stream mapping is an effective tool for identifying, 
quantifying, and eliminating waste. The smooth flow of informa-
tion produces the transparency and visibility needed to coordinate 
efficient flow of work. When information is used to level demand, 

30  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
balance capacity, and improve quality, flow is improved and value is 
delivered to the customer sooner.
When there are no interruptions in a series of tasks, work flows smoothly. 
Typically, work will flow until it encounters a barrier that prevents it from 
continuing (e.g., physical or electronic transportation to another location). 
When work cannot be designed to flow, it needs to be connected to the 
next series of tasks that do flow using a pull mechanism.
Pull removes the opportunity for overproduction* and supports flow by 
regulating work activity. In a pull system, all work is performed just-in-
time triggered by a customer demand signal (kanban). The sequence of the 
pull signals establishes clear priorities, the receiver of the signal is directly 
accountable, and the signal itself provides visibility.
As overproduction decreases, work-in-process inventory decreases and 
flow is improved; work stoppages and delays happen less frequently, fur-
ther reducing work in process, response time, and backlogs.
Summary: As flow improves, information and work product are received 
earlier by both internal and external customers. Flow releases pent-
up, committed time and resources, effectively increasing an organi-
zation’s capacity to respond to change with limited disruptions. This 
translates to better quality, response time, customer service, inven-
tory turns, and ultimately cash flow.
Culture
•	 ἀeme: The capstone on our principles pyramid is culture, which 
represents an organization’s shared beliefs and values, manifested as 
attitude and behavior. Culture is an outcome of behavioral change. 
(See Figure  2.5) A Lean culture of continuous improvement cre-
ates a shared capability which enables people to proactively seek out 
and solve problems, resulting in superior performance, competitive 
advantage, and bottom-line financial results.
•	 ἀe challenge: Sustained Lean transformation is only possible when cul-
ture evolves to reinforce new behaviors. The vast majority of companies 
*	 Overproduction was considered the most harmful form of waste by Taiichi Ohno because it gener-
ates other additional forms of waste (inventory, transportation, etc.).

Foundations of Lean  •  31
that have embarked on a journey of continuous improvement (Lean, 
Six Sigma, or another discipline) have not realized long-term break-
through results—having failed to transform their daily behavior and 
culture. The hearts and minds of their people are not engaged nor 
committed.
•	 How does the principle address the issue? We are often asked, “How 
do we create a Lean culture?” Our belief is that a Lean culture is 
developed over time by changing the way people perceive their roles 
and perform their daily work. In Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance? 
Lou Gerstner, former CEO of IBM, emphasizes the importance of 
culture:
I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect of the 
game—it is the game. In the end, an organization is nothing more than the 
collective capacity of its people to create value.10

The evolution of a Lean culture often begins with the adoption of con-
tinuous improvement tools, followed by the formation of behavior-driven 
systems, guided by shared values and principles. Tools provide structure 
and capability, systems* develop common practices and procedures, and 
principles provide a foundation which reinforces cultural standards and 
daily behaviors. (See Figure 2.6.)11
It’s one thing to create a mission statement and clever slogans articu-
lating strategic objectives of the organization, and an entirely different 
thing to have a deeply shared vision and constancy of purpose by all 
employees. Shared beliefs are reflected in self-created social systems 
that become the way we get things done around here. As organizations 
evolve, certain behaviors become the norm and are reinforced by daily 
actions.
When it is customary for people to take personal responsibility for the 
quality of their work, actively solve problems in a collaborative spirit, 
and give their very best, the energy and excitement of the workplace are 
palpable. The satisfaction of being part of an effective team accomplish-
ing clear objectives is contagious. When actions are aligned with the 
principles we’ve discussed, they reinforce the strategic direction of the 
*	 Systems, in this context, are collections of tools and procedures which form a standard way of 
doing things. Examples of Lean systems include kaizen process, A3 thinking, standard work, 5S, 
level loading, measurement, the visual workplace, and strategy deployment.

organization while creating a constancy of purpose in support of unre-
lenting improvement.
Summary: Aristotle said over 2,000 years ago, “We are what we repeat-
edly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” Shared values 
and principles will serve as a compass throughout your Lean jour-
ney. Develop a solid foundation of main beliefs that inspire respect, 
proactive behavior, innovation, and constant learning, and you will 
be well on your way toward sustainable operational excellence.
The Central Concepts of Value and Waste
The principal focus of Lean is problem solving for the primary purpose of 
delivering value to the customer, achieved by the systematic elimination of 
waste throughout the value stream. While many people we meet feel they 
understand these concepts, often we discover their grasp of these terms 
varies greatly. Let’s begin by defining value stream, value, and waste.
Value Stream
A value stream is composed of all the life cycle processes required to bring 
services, products, and information from concept to customer. This includes 
all current activities, whether or not they create value, carried out for internal 
and external customers. Value stream improvement requires a cross-func-
tional perspective, drawing individuals, workgroups, and departments away 
from local optimization and silo thinking. Systems thinking enables people to 
see the whole process and understand value from the customer’s perspective.
Value
Value is what the customer wants and is willing to pay for. Intuitively, we 
all know some activities add value for the customer while others do not. 
Surprisingly, value stream mapping analysis reveals that, for most value 
streams, processes add value only 5 percent of the time it takes to deliver 
the product, service, or information to the customer. To put it another 
way, no value is created at least 95 percent of the time!

34  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Value-Added Work: VA, NVA, and NNVA
All components of work can be characterized as value-added (VA), 
non-value-added (NVA), or necessary but non-value-added (NNVA) 
work. The assessment process of whether an activity is adding value is 
straightforward but not always easy to answer: if they knew about it, 
would customers be willing to pay for it? Alternatively, would the cus-
tomer judge the product or service as less valuable if the task was not 
performed?
NNVA work includes tasks the customer may not choose to pay for but 
the company is legally or ethically compelled to do (e.g., filing tax returns, 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act [SOX] compliance, supporting the local community, 
and other acts of corporate social responsibility).
The Three Ms
Wasteful practices can be divided into three categories known as the three 
Ms: mura, muri, and muda. The differences and similarities among these 
terms lead to a deeper understanding of the impact of wasteful practices 
and the need for their methodical elimination.
Unevenness: Mura
Unevenness and variation (mura in Japanese) represent inconsistency in 
the flow of work, caused by changes in volume (uneven demand), mix 
(variation), and quality. Customers desire variety and flexibility, but these 
should be achieved while avoiding unnecessary complexity and chaotic 
behavior. It is the responsibility of management to minimize the impact of 
variation by encouraging standardized product and process design, level-
ing demand, and introducing flow, pull, and just-in-time production con-
trol and delivery systems.
Overburden: Muri
Overburden (muri in Japanese) represents placing unrealistic work-
loads on people and equipment, which leads to stress, mistakes, rework, 
and poor morale. It is the job of management to remove overburden by 

Foundations of Lean  •  35
making use of work design,* training, standardized work, and demand 
management† to support a smooth flow of products, services, and 
information.
Waste: Muda
Waste (muda in Japanese) is any NVA work (defined earlier). In the 
mid-1950s, Taiichi Ohno introduced the concept of systematic elim-
ination of waste at Toyota. This evolved into the Toyota Production 
System’s seven wastes found in production (see also Chapter 3 and 
Appendix C):
	
1.	Overproduction: producing more or sooner than is needed by the 
customer (this contributes to the other wastes)
	
2.	Inventory: having more than the minimum levels of raw materials, 
work in process, and finished goods required to support flow and 
pull (excess inventory disguises other wastes)
	
3.	Waiting: stopping or slowing down for work to arrive
	
4.	Transportation: movement of work product, information, and 
materials
	
5.	Overprocessing: excessive or unnecessary work
	
6.	Motion: unnecessary physical movement
	
7.	Correction: reworking defects and mistakes, inspection, and scrap
Often an eighth major waste is included in the list: unused human cre-
ativity and potential. Recently many Lean practitioners have also begun 
to add environmental waste to the list. Every type of waste mentioned is 
found in all business environments, not exclusively manufacturing.
By learning to see those activities that consume time, materials, and 
effort while failing to add value, individuals and teams identify and remove 
muda from the value stream. While simple in theory, it requires practice 
to develop beginner’s mind—the ability to look at a familiar process as if 
for the first time and really see what is happening.
*	 Work design centers on creating work procedures and environments that support efficient execu-
tion of tasks and smooth throughput of work by focusing on the difficulty of tasks, job stress, and 
employee satisfaction.
†	Demand management is the practice of matching available capacity to a prioritized backlog of 
work to support an even flow of attainable work. See Chapter 5.

36  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
The Power of the Three Ms
The three Ms bring a comprehensive perspective to waste reduction and 
reinforce a cycle of continuous improvement.
Managers are responsible for addressing the systemic conditions of mura 
and muri. Variability (mura) reduction is achieved through selecting mar-
kets, product design, and pricing, which supports level demand. Overburden 
(muri) reduction focuses on designing processes for workflow and consis-
tent quality, standard work, cross-training, and balancing resources to cre-
ate stable capacity conditions that support the smooth flow of information 
and work. When management reduces the systemic wastes of variability 
and overburden, levels demand, and frees capacity, workers then have the 
time, energy, and focus to continuously improve their activities to eliminate 
waste (muda), while simultaneously engaging in their daily work.
Lean Tools Overview
Lean offers a wide variety of problem-solving tools which provide structure 
and consistency to identify and quantify NVA tasks, analyze problems, 
discover root causes, develop countermeasures, implement improvements, 
and measure results. In this section, we provide a brief description of the 
most commonly used Lean tools.*
A tool is anything that enables us to accomplish a task more easily and 
effectively. We discovered long ago that, if you start out with just a handful 
of tools and then hone your process improvement skills, you will be in a 
much better position to learn and apply additional tools as you need them.
A3 Thinking, the Scientific Method, and PDCA
At the heart of Lean is the A3, a single piece of paper used to summarize the 
definition, scope, discovery process, findings, proposed countermeasures, 
*	 For an in-depth discussion of Lean tools, see Pascal Dennis, Lean production simplified (New 
York: Productivity Press, 2007); John Bicheno and Matthias Holweg, ἀe Lean toolbox, 4th rev. ed. 
(Johannesburg, South Africa: Picsie Books, 2008); and Chet Marchwinski and John Shook, Lean 
lexicon (Cambridge, MA: Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008). For an in-depth review of Six Sigma 
tools, see Thomas Pyzdek and Paul Keller, ἀe Six Sigma handbook, 3rd ed. (New York: McGraw-
Hill, 2009).

Foundations of Lean  •  37
and results of a problem-solving exercise. A3 is an international paper size 
approximately 11 × 17 inches (297 × 420 millimeters), suggesting that a 
person or team be able to communicate the essential elements of a prob-
lem-solving effort summarized on a single sheet of paper.
An A3 can also be employed as a proposal or status report. But the A3 
is much more than a form; A3 thinking is a mental framework used to 
reinforce the scientific method of solving problems: Plan-Do-Check-Act 
(PDCA*). The scientific method is a structured approach to problem solving 
which includes observation, development of a tentative description of cause 
and effect (hypothesis), prediction, testing, and evaluation. More often 
than not, attempts at problem solving lack structure and method. People 
naturally jump to solutions, focusing on symptoms instead of root causes, 
and failing to fully understand, let alone solve, the problem at hand.
Benefits from applying A3 thinking include fact-based decision making, 
consensus building, clearly documented assumptions, defined targets, 
faster results, and follow-up to ensure that improvements are sustained.† 
Although there are many different formats for an A3, the specific form 
design is not important—but the disciplined A3 thinking process is. For 
an example of an A3, see Appendix D.
Value Stream Mapping
Many people have experience with process mapping (as shown in 
Figure 2.7), which provides a detailed view of the tasks and decisions con-
tained in a specific process. While process mapping is very effective at 
providing a detailed step-by-step view of a specific procedure, it does not 
attempt to capture information about flow, elapsed time, cost, or quality 
at the value stream level.
Value stream mapping visually depicts the flow of information, mate-
rials, and work across functional silos with an emphasis on quantifying 
wastes, including time and quality. As shown in Figure 2.8, however, a 
value stream map can also illustrate a lower level of detail. Typically, the 
focus is at a more macro level than process mapping and does not include 
individual tasks and decisions.
*	 In healthcare this is commonly known as PDSA, Plan-Do-Study-Act.
†	For an in-depth example of A3 thinking and PDCA, see John Shook, Managing to learn 
(Cambridge, MA: Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008).

40  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Beyond the physical map itself, the activity of value stream mapping helps 
to bring a multidisciplinary team together to see the whole process from a 
work and information flow perspective. When a cross-functional team is 
assembled (ideally including a representative from IT) to map a process, 
a picture of the current state emerges through rounds of discussion and 
discovery. Once the team agrees that the current-state value stream map 
accurately depicts the situation, they are in a position to make data-sup-
ported predictions on which improvements will yield the greatest results. 
Developing a current-state value stream map brings a shared understanding 
and consensus to the cross-functional team, representing stakeholders—
including in-house resources, internal and external customers, vendors, 
and suppliers—from various parts of the organization that may seldom 
otherwise interact. As the team reaches agreement on the current state of 
the process and the waste it contains, they create a baseline for developing 
a future blueprint of the improved value stream, in order to highlight gaps 
between the current and target future state, prioritize activities, and estab-
lish metrics.* Maintaining an updated current and future-state value stream 
map keeps the team focused, enabling targeted continuous improvement 
that delivers meaningful and quantifiable results.
Kaizen
Kaizen† (Japanese for continuous improvement) is a systematic improve-
ment methodology that is central to Lean. Kaizen involves many small 
incremental improvements and provides structure to process improvement.
System and Process Kaizen
There are two kinds of kaizen: system (also called flow) and process 
(Figure 2.9). System kaizen attempts to improve the overall value stream 
by enhancing material and information flow, and is the focus of man-
agement. Process kaizen, performed by teams and individuals, concen-
trates on reducing waste in specific focus areas within the value stream. 
Improvement in one type of kaizen positively impacts the other.
*	 See Beau Keyte and Drew Locher, ἀe complete Lean enterprise: Value stream mapping for admin-
istrative and office processes (New York: Productivity Press, 2004); and Mike Rother and John 
Shook, Learning to see (Cambridge, MA: Lean Enterprise Institute, 1999).
†	See Masaaki Imai, Kaizen: ἀe key to Japan’s competitive success (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1986).

Foundations of Lean  •  41
Kaizen Events, Projects and Daily Improvement
The duration of kaizen activity ranges from a few minutes to several 
months. The degree of rigor and formality varies with the nature of the 
undertaking. Kaizen events are focused short-term improvement efforts 
that usually involve a cross-functional team and last from three to five 
days. Although the Kaizen event lasts just a few days, preparation can take 
place over several months prior to the activity.
Some Lean efforts require more time to plan and execute; these kaizen 
projects last from several weeks to up to three months. To maintain focus 
and deliver improvements as quickly as possible, we recommend that no 
kaizen activity last longer than 90 days. If the scope is larger than that, 
decompose the project into smaller phases (see Lean Project Management 
in Chapter 9).
For Lean to become a part of daily culture, every individual should be 
inspired to drive improvement on a daily basis. Daily kaizen (a form of 
process kaizen also known as a kaizen blitz) is spontaneous improve-
ment performed as a need is identified. For example, when a problem is 
encountered, an individual or small group stops working to identify the 
problem, analyze it, develop potential countermeasures, select the most 
promising solution, make the improvement, and assess the impact. In a 
Lean enterprise, the highest proportion of problem solving occurs at the 
daily kaizen level.

Kaikaku
Organizations also take on strategic breakthrough initiatives. Kaikaku, 
typically initiated by senior leadership, is system kaizen focused on 
achieving radical improvement, as contrasted with kaizen which is grad-
ual and continuous. Kaikaku is strategically focused and represents a leap 
forward, not incremental change. Wisdom and experience suggest an 
organization should undertake only a few kaikaku projects at one time.
Standardized Work
Standardized work defines and documents the most effective method 
to accomplish a task. There are usually a variety of ways to perform the 
same work, depending on who is doing it. Variation in work practices cre-
ates variation in time, quality, and cost. First a team establishes a current 
standard to which they all agree to adhere. As work improvements are 
developed, tested, approved, and implemented (PDCA), they become the 
newest version of standardized work.* As variation and waste are reduced, 
process quality and stability are enhanced, and cost reduction is often a 
natural by-product.
Rather than being dictated by management, standard work is estab-
lished and owned by the people performing the work, converting tribal 
knowledge known only by a few to a documented method consistently 
performed by all. Shared understanding of how work is done also sup-
ports rapid learning, skills transfer, cross-training, and load balancing.
Standard work also applies to managers, supervisors, and team 
leaders. Using a Lean management system, leaders combine standard 
work, visual controls, gemba walks, daily accountability, and disci-
pline to support their people and generate measurable results. Gemba 
is Japanese for “real or actual place” and highlights the need to leave 
the comfort of your office or cubicle and go where the internal or exter-
nal customer is using the product or service to witness what is really 
occurring and verify your understanding. There is no substitute for 
personal observation.
For some people, the word standard implies rigidity and inflexibility—
barriers to innovation. But in fact, the process stability created by standard 
*	 For a comprehensive study, see David Mann, Creating a Lean culture: Tools to sustain Lean conver-
sions (New York: Productivity Press, 2005).

Foundations of Lean  •  43
work encourages innovation. Why? It is virtually impossible to improve 
a process that is unstable or not consistently performed. As work proce-
dures are standardized, employees experience stable work processes upon 
which they can build.
5S and the Visual Workplace
5S is a workplace organization method. Roughly translated to English 
from Japanese, 5S stands for “Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and 
Sustain.”* 5S provides a systematic approach for cleaning up, organizing, 
and maintaining an orderly workplace. Disorganized work environments 
encourage wasteful business practices and hide underlying problems. 
They also create mental clutter and chaos. Companies often begin their 
Lean journey with 5S, not only to establish a foundation of order, but also 
to raise awareness of business processes, sources of waste, and opportuni-
ties for improvement (see the Con-way Virtual 5S case study).
5S also lays the groundwork for the visual workplace,† eliminating visual 
and mental noise—creating an environment where the status of work is 
so self-apparent that emerging problems call attention to themselves. By 
actively displaying the information that needs to be shared, the visual 
workplace provides people with the information they need to know with-
out having to ask for it. A great deal of time is wasted on interruptions to 
answer questions such as “What is the status of …?” Most status inquiries 
are no longer necessary in a visual workplace, since the answers to such 
queries are constantly displayed, updated, and accessible to all.
Let’s Get Started!
We have established our foundation, discussing the central principles and 
tools of Lean. In the next chapter, we build on these ideas by describing Lean 
IT and its importance in creating and sustaining a Lean transformation.

The Lean IT and Business Partnership
Chapter Objectives
Having established the fundamentals of Lean, we turn our focus to informa-
tion and information systems as an often untapped source of value. We will:
•	 Explore why IT has traditionally been overlooked in Lean initiatives.
•	 Search for IT’s “burning platform” for change.
•	 Consider information wastes and their consequences.
•	 Explore how Lean tools apply to information and information systems.
The most important, and indeed the truly unique contribution of manage-
ment in the 20th century was the fifty-fold increase in the productivity of 
the manual worker in manufacturing. The most important contribution 
management needs to make in the 21st century is similarly to increase the 
productivity of knowledge work and knowledge workers. 
—Peter Drucker
We can all agree that quality information is an essential business asset that 
guides behavior and supports good decisions.
Every business process relies on quality information and effective informa-
tion systems, whether manual or electronic, as the flow of information sup-
ports the flow of work and the creation of value. And most organizations in 
this modern age have no choice but to rely heavily on electronic information 
systems due to the volume, complexity, or global reach of their activities.

46  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Many IT organizations have gone beyond traditional business process 
improvement, investing in self-service applications, enabling their cus-
tomers to help themselves, and improving speed, quality, and customer 
satisfaction, all while reducing operating costs.
And beyond the improvement of processes, some organizations are learn-
ing to differentiate themselves through innovative information value incorpo-
rated within, or delivered through, their products and services. For example:
•	 In 2008, 70 percent of BMW’s production was made to customer 
order, and each one of those customers was invited to watch their 
car’s assembly on the factory floor through an interactive website, 
creating an exciting customer experience even before they climbed 
into the driver’s seat.
•	 GE Healthcare provides abundant information on their advanced 
medical products (MRI, radiography, molecular imaging, etc.) help-
ing health care providers use these sophisticated devices more effec-
tively to improve the health and quality of life for their patients.
•	 Years ago Amazon.com redefined the role of a bookseller, and now they 
(along with Barnes & Noble, Apple, Microsoft, and many others) hope 
their electronic books and tablet PCs will redefine the traditional book.
•	 Many providers now offer outsourced information-oriented services, 
from accounting to medical chart review and IT services, around 
the globe.
The possibilities seem endless, with new innovations appearing daily. 
Skillful and innovative application of information and information sys-
tems can add value—speed, quality, cost, differentiation, customer inti-
macy, and more—to the enterprise and its customers.
Why Hasn’t IT Been a Focus of Lean?
Despite its clear importance, however, IT* has received little atten-
tion from the Lean community. In our opinion, the IT organizations’ 
*	 The term “IT” is used broadly throughout this book, but it can mean many things:  information, 
information systems, the IT organization, the tangible, intangible and intellectual assets, policies 
and procedures related to information and information systems management

historical disengagement from Lean efforts is one of the root causes 
behind the failure of many enterprises to achieve a sustainable Lean 
transformation.
In fact, IT associates often have a better understanding of the company’s 
processes and current limitations than the users, because it’s their job to 
grapple with the intricacies of maintaining and supporting the underly-
ing systems. But their ability to improve the system may be constrained by 
countless factors.
While preparing for a Lean IT workshop for a large global enterprise, we 
were presented with a list of questions the participants asked us to address, 
asking “How can IT …
•	 Work in partnership with the business on improving process and 
system effectiveness?
•	 Drive faster and more dramatic improvement and innovation for 
the business?
•	 Improve its ability to deliver projects on time, within budget, with 
desired results?
•	 Place creativity before capital, process improvement before sys-
tem investment?
•	 Help simplify IT operations and improve time, quality, and cost of 
our services to the business?
•	 Become more engaged to seek out and solve root causes of problems?
•	 Achieve greater employee engagement and satisfaction through 
Lean thinking?”
This list, their voice of the customer, was on their collective minds that 
week, and nicely frames the essential value proposition we will explore 
throughout this book. Clearly, if Lean IT can address these issues, it will 
be a tremendous catalyst for positive change, overcoming inertia and 
resistance that has prevented many organizations from advancing further 
in their journey of continuous improvement.
But as we all know, such breakthrough change is often disruptive, 
threatening, and uncomfortable. Most individuals and organizations need 
a compelling reason to change, a burning platform from which they have 
no choice but to jump.

What Is IT’s Burning Platform 
for Transformation?
We once heard that managing an IT organization is like juggling alligators 
and chain saws—this may not be far from the truth. Business require-
ments are constantly changing. End users are often unable to articulate 
exactly what they need, yet they often seem insistent about what they don’t 
want … once they see it.
Software, hardware, and Internet technologies are constantly changing, 
becoming more complex, and the interdependencies among multiple sys-
tems make the change, upgrade, or replacement of any single component a 
risky proposition. The cost of complexity is not linear but exponential, and 
it eventually comes to dominate all other costs in most software systems.1 
Combine this complexity and volatility with resource and capacity manage-
ment challenges, conflicting priorities, and frequent interruptions, and IT 
leadership has more than a few alligators and chainsaws to contend with.
The number of distinct business software applications used in a mid-
sized company can easily measure more than 100, and in a large global 
enterprise, thousands of applications may be in play, causing tre-
mendous integration and software life cycle management challenges. 
Changes to this loosely woven fabric of software and data are espe-
cially risky and potentially disruptive to the business when they impact 
enterprise-wide, mission-critical systems like enterprise resource plan-
ning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), or customer relation-
ship management (CRM).
The Standish Group has been conducting surveys on IT projects since 
1994. Their annual CHAOS Report reveals that roughly 20 percent of 
IT projects fail,* 50 percent of projects are challenged, and only 30 per-
cent succeed. Over the years, the survey results have improved slightly 
(Figure 3.1), which is somewhat encouraging. Nevertheless, if any other 
department within an organization consistently produced similar results, 
the managers would be updating their résumés.
*	 The Standish Group defines success as on time, on budget, and meeting the specifications. There is 
some debate whether these are useful and measurable guidelines—for example, a cancelled project 
may be an indication of good governance rather than faulty project management, and a successful 
project may not add value if the specifications don’t properly address customer requirements or 
business problems at the root cause.

The Lean IT and Business Partnership  •  49
But IT is not like other departments; managing this degree of com-
plexity, volatility, and risk requires a balance of professionalism, techni-
cal know-how, artful prioritization, and a little magic. And through it 
all the business must keep running, so the IT staff is charged with main-
taining order, stability, and performance, while steadfastly preventing 
unplanned downtime.
Lean versus Traditional IT: A Natural Tension?
Perhaps there is a conflict arising from the very nature of traditional IT 
and Lean practices, as suggested by the table in Figure 3.2.
As you can see from this comparison, traditional IT organizational 
practices typically move slowly and carefully to avoid instability and busi-
ness disruption, while Lean encourages every individual to notice and fix 
problems by making small improvements each and every day. This dif-
ference creates a tension that permeates the daily activities and interac-
tions among business and IT associates. We are not suggesting these are 
irreconcilable differences leading to constant conflict and confrontation, 
though that seems to happen within some organizations. We are simply 
calling attention to natural tendencies that, left unaddressed, may create 
friction, causing the IT organization to disengage or even resist the ongo-
ing improvement of business processes.

Legacy Systems
A common example of ineffective IT and business coordination is the 
existence of a significant legacy information system—homegrown or 
extensively modified software that remains in place long past its useful life 
cycle. A legacy system may persist for a number of reasons, among them: 
unique or unusual business processes are dependent upon it, it may rely 
on obsolete or obscure technology, those who designed and built it have 
long since left the company, and the system has been patched repeatedly 
but the changes are poorly documented. As a result, most IT associates are 
reluctant to tinker with a legacy system unless it’s absolutely necessary.
Legacy systems are like organizational scar tissue—they form around 
injuries in the business processes, building layer upon layer of hardened 
procedures, and limiting flexibility of the process while causing pain. 
And each time business requirements change, a new layer of reactive 
changes and patches are added. Over the years the legacy system becomes 
increasingly fragile, the user workarounds more contrived, and the busi-
ness processes more ineffective and resistant to change. This degenera-
tive process causes the accumulation of technical debt, a liability that 
extracts daily payments in the form of waste and inefficiency, until the 
debt is liquidated.
For example, one client was replacing a 20-year-old legacy system that 
had been extensively customized to fit their unique requirements, like 
a well-fitting but worn-out old glove. Over the years the 100-year-old

company had devised elaborate pricing agreements with many customers. 
Some of these agreements predated the legacy system and were very dif-
ficult for both the company and its customers to administer.
There is no doubt that renegotiating these pricing agreements would 
have been difficult. On the other hand, the impending system replace-
ment provided a golden opportunity to revisit the customer relation-
ships, and re-assess their value proposition, standardizing delivery 
services and pricing structures. Instead, the executives decided to trans-
fer the existing agreements to their new ERP system. This created mil-
lions of distinct pricing records in the database. The added complexity 
caused countless errors and exceptions, while requiring two full-time 
employees to maintain the system and chase the problems. No value 
was added here.
Removing layers of systemic scar tissue can be uncomfortable, requiring 
discipline and effort, so it is often neglected. As a result, entangled systems, 
inflexible users, and overly complex designs can smother an improvement 
effort. In such cases, members of the IT organization may feel like they 
are the scapegoat for deeply rooted problems within the overall enterprise 
that are beyond their control.
What about Process Maturity Models?
IT professionals are naturally process-oriented, structured thinkers. So 
it’s no surprise that over the years they have participated in the develop-
ment of an alphabet soup of process maturity models to guide the evolution 
of the process-oriented enterprise. Popular models include CMM, ISO, 
ITIL, and SCOR.*
However popular these models may be, often they are not effectively 
implemented or sustained. For example, over the past two decades or more, 
ISO 9000 resulted in many compliance-driven implementations that didn’t 
improve the fundamental behavior or performance of the organization.†
*	 Acronym alert! CMM: Capability Maturity Model; ISO 9000, 14000, 22000, 27000 and oth-
ers: International Standards Organization standards for quality management systems; ITIL: 
Information Technology Infrastructure Library; and SCOR: Supply Chain Operations Reference 
Model.
†	The same can be said for many other compliance-driven improvements across many industries, 
including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for publicly traded companies, The Joint Commission (JCAHO) 
for health care, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Good Manufacturing Practices, 
and so on.

52  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
These process models provide general frameworks for industry best 
practices (or at least acceptable practices), describing the target state of key 
processes. In other words, these process models usually describe the what 
but not the how. This approach is typically a top-down process, where lead-
ership selects a model, an implementation methodology, and perhaps an 
outside consulting firm to drive the implementation.
This authoritative approach can be rapid but may result in superficial 
adoption of new practices, while lacking employee buy-in and the sub-
tle nuances that accommodate the company’s culture. This in turn may 
lead to resistance, and the inability to sustain the improvements without 
constant management oversight and arm twisting. Under these circum-
stances, compliance often appears, and only temporarily, soon before the 
auditors are scheduled to arrive
By contrast, consider a bottom-up approach, where cross-functional teams 
identify and solve problems and improve processes as a natural evolu-
tion. Each incremental step is defined according to the teams’ perspectives 
and priorities. While this results in individuals and teams driving process 
improvement and innovation through hands-on problem solving, it may also 
create a slow and somewhat random approach to achieving strategic goals of 
the enterprise.
The ideal approach to using a process model may be found as a hybrid 
of top-down and bottom-up. Teams apply A3 thinking, solving problems 
according to the specific circumstances and culture of the organization, 
while the general future-state direction is guided by strategic input from 
leadership, supported (in some situations) by a mature process model or 
framework, such as ITIL (see Chapter 7). In this way, the organization 
leverages industry practices to envision and target a desired future state. 
In doing so, the organization can adopt best practices for supporting pro-
cesses (see Chapter 4), focusing its creative energy on innovative practices 
that will provide distinction and competitive advantage.
What Is Information Waste?
Data is of course important, but I put greater emphasis on facts.
—Taiichi Ohno, Toyota

The Lean IT and Business Partnership  •  53
The many benefits of electronic information systems are often offset by 
the waste they generate. Too many times we have witnessed Lean teams 
attempt to improve a process, but the moment they return to their key-
boards, they’re forced to act out the same old familiar and wasteful prac-
tices in their daily work. Information waste produces many harmful 
consequences, including lost productivity, costly delays and errors, and 
unnecessary complexity. Often manifesting as confusion and frustration, 
information waste is felt by everyone who interacts with the organization.
Excess Information Inventory Waste
In an office or manufacturing context, excess inventory is a highly visible 
symptom, a beacon to illuminate the search for root causes of wasteful 
activity. From a Lean IT perspective, what is excess information inven-
tory? It is too much virtual stuff … in your inbox, your local hard drive, 
shared drives, intranet sites, and data warehouses. Excess information 
inventory is work backlog waiting to be done, unnecessary e-mails in 
your inbox, unused features in software applications, local spreadsheets 
impeding the flow of work as a process skips across departmental bound-
aries, and so on. Excess information inventory causes congestion, delays, 
inefficiency, errors, and rework. Everyone in the enterprise struggles 
against info-glut.
Most people naturally hoard inventory; it’s a primal instinct that goes 
back to our hunting-and-gathering days. Having too much stuff buffers 
you from variability, since you always have enough even when your sup-
ply runs out for a while. For this reason, excess information inventory is 
important to seek out because it indicates that the process itself, the flow of 
work that the information supports, is unreliable. More information (e.g., 
additional data, better software, and more automation) alone is unlikely 
to fix the problem.
Just like excess physical inventory is stored in warehouses, excess data 
and documents are stored in data warehouses and repositories throughout 
the organization. The effort required to capture, store, search, and man-
age these data just in case they might be needed is wasteful, even if stor-
age space is abundant and inexpensive. This waste is compounded by data 
fragmentation, version control challenges, excessive security controls, and 
other flow inhibitors caused by excess information inventory.

54  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Information Overprocessing Waste
Another form of information waste is overprocessing, of doing more work 
than necessary. A common form of overprocessing is the overdesign of a 
software application, creating unnecessary navigation, keystrokes, and 
other forms of complexity. Less than half of software features are typically 
used, but once implemented, they must all be maintained and supported. 
This non-value-added effort creates a burden for users and IT staff alike.
Unnecessary transactions are another common form of information 
overprocessing, including unnecessary approval steps, and excessive data 
capture to feed calculations and reports that don’t support efficient work-
flow or effective decision making.
Multitasking is a pandemic form of overprocessing waste in the business 
world. At one time we all considered multitasking a virtue to be cultivated, 
but now we realize that constant interruptions and task switching are unpro-
ductive. In the Harvard Business Review article “Manage Your Energy, Not 
Your Time,” Tony Schwartz and Catherine McCarthy suggest that,
Distractions are costly: a temporary shift in attention from one task to 
another—stopping to answer an e-mail or take a phone call, for instance—
increases the amount of time necessary to finish the primary task by as 
much as 25 percent, a phenomenon known as “switching time.” It’s far 
more efficient to fully focus for 90 to 120 minutes, take a true break, and 
then fully focus on the next activity.4
Most people require about 15 minutes to productively resume a chal-
lenging task when they are interrupted even by something as innocuous 
as an e-mail alert, scientists at Microsoft Research and the University of 
Illinois found in a 2007 study.5 While 15 minutes may not seem like much 
time, if interruptions occur several times a day, this can add up to serious 
performance degradation … or worse.
Interruptions seem to be a fact of life, but they are costly in terms of 
time, concentration, and quality. Awareness of this fact can, over time, 
lead to changing work patterns and communication practices, and setting 
aside uninterrupted time and space to tackle difficult tasks. In our expe-
rience, especially in the office environment, many interruptions are for 
simple status inquiries such as “Where is this?” “When will that be done?” 
and “What do you need from me now?” The effective use of simple visu-
als to communicate status and priority of work can significantly reduce

interruptions, improving the quality and efficiency of work while creating 
a more enjoyable workplace.
Poor Data Quality Waste
Yet another type of information waste is poor data quality. Often a sleep-
ing giant within the databases and spreadsheets spanning the enterprise, 
poor data quality is both a cause and a consequence of poor process design 
and operational execution.
The Lean principle of quality at the source means that data quality is 
everyone’s responsibility. Ideally, data should be captured once at the 
source, with the appropriate time and effort invested in getting them 
right the first time. Ultimately, the process owners (not the IT organiza-
tion) should take responsibility for data quality, establishing standard 
work and error-proofing methods, accompanied by supportive measure-
ments. High-volume transactional processes with data quality problems 
are often well suited for the rigorous analytical techniques emphasized 
by Six Sigma (see the Ingersoll Rand Case Study).
As you can see from this brief exploration, there are many forms of 
information waste—see Figure 3.3, and for a more comprehensive listing 
see Appendix C. More importantly, once individuals and teams begin to 
understand the many forms that information waste can take, how do they 
methodically identify, quantify, prioritize, and eliminate it?
Learning to See Information Waste
To learn to see waste you must first understand clearly the degree to which 
a process creates value from the customer’s perspective. Any Lean journey 
must begin with this simple question: “What does the customer define as 
value?” So from the IT organization’s perspective, who is the customer?
In our experience, kaizen teams are often surprised at how many cus-
tomers they have and how little they understand what each really val-
ues. Every step of every process has at least one customer—the recipient 
of the work flow, the next downstream step. In most business processes, 
activities are primarily performed by internal resources, serving down-
stream internal customers. This is the case with internal functions such 

56  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Health Care Information Quality
Perhaps no industry suffers greater information fragmentation than 
health care. One registered nurse described 33 separate forms she 
completed by hand each time she admitted a patient into home 
care services. Each form contained overlapping information such 
as patient name, address, medical condition, and so on. Not only 
does this waste scarce nursing time (an hour to complete the forms 
while visiting the patient in the home), but also consider the impli-
cations of 33 distinct information systems that interface with this 
single process of admitting a new patient. And the chances are high 
that at least some data will be captured incorrectly into at least one 
of these systems, causing not only redundancy but also incorrect and 
conflicting information. This not only causes many forms of down-
stream waste, but also in some cases may endanger the health of the 
patient.
     The solution to such fragmentation? Electronic Medical Records 
(EMR) may help, but they’re not enough—and if improperly imple-
mented experience and research* have shown they may even make 
matters worse. From a clinical perspective, integrated medical teams 
are learning to facilitate shared assessment findings,  resulting in 
improved overall care for the patient and family. From a process 
perspective, interdisciplinary systems thinking, enabled by A3 prob-
lem solving and value stream mapping, have become popular within 
health care organizations in both business and clinical settings. 
Cross-functional teams of physicians, nurses, administrators, and 
other stakeholders come together to identify and solve problems, 
with a focus on value to the customer: time, cost, patient health and 
safety. Over time, as processes are simplified, redundant applica-
tions can also be simplified, normalized, integrated … and eventu-
ally eliminated.

as Human Resources, the IT Service Desk (help desk), or the employee 
cafeteria, processes that rarely touch the ultimate end customer of the 
business.
External processes, such as the customer order processing–to–bill-
ing cycle, involve external customers when they request a quote or 
submit an order, and again when they receive an invoice as the final 
process output. But most of the work in between is still performed by 
internal resources serving their internal customers. Any of these steps 
that do not add value to the external customer (and are not manda-
tory for compliance) should be targeted for elimination, rather than 
improvement.
Since the focus of Lean is adding value to the customer (internal and 
external), improvement activity should include a voice-of-customer (VOC) 
exercise focusing the team on who the customers are and what they value. 
Figure 3.4 shows a simple VOC brainstorming exercise format focusing on 
information value.
Once a team understands what the customer values, it has a basis for 
assessing the severity of the waste it discovers, evaluating its impact 
on the value stream, and prioritizing its elimination. To eliminate a 
particular wasteful activity, the team then determines the underlying

causes, conditions, assumptions, and habitual behaviors that perpetu-
ate it. Lean offers many tools and techniques to get to the root cause—
brainstorming, cause-and-effect diagrams and the perennial favorite: 
the five whys—where after someone suggests the cause of a problem, 
keep asking, “Why?” This persistent inquiry usually leads to some inter-
esting places, as you probe for underlying causes to explain why things 
really happen the way they do. This technique is explored in Chapter 9.
During a kaizen event aimed at identifying and aligning IT value 
streams,* Con-way Enterprise Services developed the cause and effect 
(fishbone) diagram shown in Figure 3.5. While this diagram illustrates 
the underlying complexity of information waste, this is just the begin-
ning—for each contributing factor identified on this diagram, another 
“Why?” awaits.
Value stream mapping is an essential tool for identifying and measuring 
the impact of information waste on process outcomes. According to Mike 
Rother and John Shook, who introduced value stream mapping, “Material 
and information flow are two sides of the same coin. You must map both 
of them.”6
In a value stream map, work and supporting information flows are 
illustrated and quantified, so sources of waste may be prioritized and 
targeted for elimination based on their impact to overall process per-
formance. Quantification of the impact of waste (time, quality, and 
cost) in the current-state map, compared to the intended outcome in the 
future-state map, provides measurement-based justification for change 
and investment proposals.
It is not uncommon, particularly in an office environment, for there to be 
more information boxes than process boxes on a value stream map (shown 
in Figure 3.6). Information proliferation and fragmentation (disintegra-
tion) across the enterprise are common causes of waste, and inhibitors to 
workflow. With spreadsheets on every desktop and data repositories in 
every department, fractured and incorrect data slip between the cracks 
as the process is handed off from one siloed workgroup to the next. Data 
fragmentation and process misalignment lead to overprocessing, delays, 
process rigidity, errors, rework, worker frustration, and ultimately cus-
tomer dissatisfaction.

Lean and Green IT
In this age of global environmental consequences, it’s important to empha-
size the role that the IT organization can play in reducing environmental 
waste. Lean IT and Green IT are certainly complementary; in fact, many 
environmental benefits are realized simply as by-products of ongoing Lean 
IT improvement efforts.
When concentrating on green improvements, the issue that most 
IT associates consider first is the environmental waste caused by IT 
operations:
	
1.	Data center energy efficiency*
	
2.	End user computing energy efficiency
	
3.	Toner and paper consumption
	
4.	Ethical handling of electronic waste†
Additional environmental waste reduction opportunities can often be 
found in business operations improvement, which can be enabled or 
enhanced by use of technology. In fact, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (www.epa.gov/lean/toolkit)  promotes kaizen activity and value 
*	 EPA reports data centers consumed 1.5 percent of total US energy consumption in 2006, this 
demand is expected to grow by 12 percent each year.

stream mapping to focus attention and action on energy and environmen-
tal impact.
Significant environmental improvements are often achieved by evaluat-
ing the overall flow of materials and transportation from source to cus-
tomer. For example, United Parcel Service’s (UPS) investment in package 
flow software improved the performance of their fleet of 95,000 trucks 
(including the amount of time they spend idling in left-hand-turn lanes), 
and UPS reported an annual reduction of 28.5 million miles from their 
delivery routes, saving 3 million gallons of gas and reducing CO2 emis-
sions by 31,000 metric tons.8
Then there is the ability of information systems to provide feedback 
on the effectiveness of environmental sustainability initiatives through-
out the enterprise. This includes not only reporting on direct envi-
ronmental improvement initiatives, but also accumulating data from 
process improvements where environmental benefits are a by-product;* 
this requires a reporting system that can reach into a variety of inter-
nal and external data sources (such as internal ERP systems, external 
supply chain systems, and regulatory agency websites), sifting through 
large volumes of data, and building aggregated views and reports of 
cost reductions and environmental outcomes that are used as feedback 
to guide ongoing activities.†
Such a reporting system would offer the additional benefit of automat-
ing much of the data collection and reporting overhead that will likely 
be required by various regulatory agencies for cap-and-trade and other 
environmental programs. And the existence of such a reporting system, 
to measure and provide direct feedback on a company’s carbon footprint 
and other environmental consequences, would add value to support the 
company’s fact-based decision making on environmental issues (see Green 
Intentions by Brett Wills).9
Lean IT is in a strong position to support green initiatives as companies 
extend their focus to the triple bottom line: people, planet, and profits. 
*	 One client, during a kaizen to improve a customer billing and collection process, discovered 
they could avoid printing and archiving billing documents. This eliminated the printing of 
over 100,000 pages per year, plus the storage space (plus the electricity for heating and lighting) 
required to archive these documents for several years.

While not a central theme of this book, we encourage the reader to explore 
all potential direct and indirect benefits to the environment that may 
result from Lean waste reduction, both within IT operations and through 
technology-enabled business process improvement.
The Tools of Lean IT
In Chapter 2, we explored the basic tools of Lean; now we’ll revisit several 
of these tools, highlighting their relevance to Lean IT. We will continue to 
explore these tools in various IT contexts throughout this book:
•	 A3 thinking: While IT professionals are natural system thinkers and 
problem solvers, they are usually under intense time and budget pres-
sure. As a result, they often jump to quick workaround solutions that 
do not address root causes, creating a technical debt: a continuing 
liability of inefficiency and frustration. Lean offers tools that help IT 
and businesspeople slow down and take the time to assess a situation 
properly. In the realm of Six Sigma, problem solving often includes 
rigorous collection and analysis of data.
•	 Go look, go see (genchi genbutsu, go to gemba): People should make 
decisions by fact, not by feeling, so every team must go to gemba 
(where the work is performed) to see the situation for themselves. 
Gemba can be a physical place, or a virtual space such as a business 
intelligence system that represents the inputs and outputs of a trans-
actional process. Ultimately, though, gemba means the people and the 
place where the work is done, not the data that represent this work.
•	 Teamwork: In order to align business and IT activities and invest-
ments, they must work together as partners—solving problems and 
simplifying processes first, then carefully applying information sys-
tems as appropriate (people, process, and technology—in that order).
•	 Value stream mapping: As we explored earlier in this chapter, value 
stream mapping can help to identify and quantify information waste 
within every value stream and supporting process.
•	 Standardized work: Work standards are developed, documented, 
and continuously improved by the team members, providing input 
for software requirements, documentation, training, testing, and 

64  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
support. Knowledge management tools serve to standardize, dissem-
inate, and manage standard work instructions across the enterprise. 
The work of the IT organization itself should also be standardized to 
encourage quality and consistency, avoiding pockets of specialized 
knowledge that create a dependency on specific individuals.
•	 Measurement: The keys to a sustainable Lean transformation are 
standardized work, accompanied by good measures that provide 
feedback to ensure the continuing effectiveness of currently defined 
processes, and to identify new opportunities for improvement. 
Reporting and analyses are derived from data generated by the orga-
nization’s manual and electronic information systems, so IT asso-
ciates are often called on to assist with the design of measurement 
systems.
•	 Workplace organization (5S): Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, 
and Sustain your IT assets: storage, hardware, software, licenses, 
workspaces, processes, data, knowledge, and intellectual property.
•	 Visual workplace: Make IT process and project flow and status vis-
ible to everyone, calling attention to impending problems and avoid-
ing status inquiry interruptions. Visual process measures and alerts 
are often automated, providing proactive notification of exceptions 
to identify problems and initiate immediate corrective and preventa-
tive action.
•	 Cellular organization: People and equipment supporting all or part 
of a process are co-located (either physically or virtually using online 
tools) to encourage smooth workflow, collaborative problem solving, 
knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement.
•	 Demand management: IT organizations commonly have back-
logs that are years long, and are often lacking clear prioritization 
or decision-making processes. Chaotic demand (mura)—variation 
from sudden spikes, frequent interruptions, and priority changes—
contributes to overburden (mura), which leads to wasteful activity 
(muda). By working with the business to manage priorities and cre-
ate level demand, matching it to available capacity to create a steady 
pace of work (flow), an IT organization can become more responsive, 
giving customers exactly what they want, when they want it.
•	 Strategy deployment (also known as hoshin kanri): Articulate strat-
egy and align daily work through all levels and dimensions of the 
organization, ensuring that process improvement and supporting 

The Lean IT and Business Partnership  •  65
information systems deliver meaningful and measurable results. 
Skillful application of information systems can aid in the deploy-
ment of an effective strategy deployment system (see the Toyota elec-
tronic hoshin kanri case study).
How Do We Do Lean IT?
Lean IT enables a manageable, synchronized pace for business process change 
throughout the organization, focused on delivering value to the customer.
Lean IT is accomplished through people, process, and technology—in 
that order. People (working in cross-functional teams) identify the prob-
lems and their root causes, which are often found in the process itself and 
not the technology. When the process is improved (and often simplified), 
the people may find that the supporting systems can also be streamlined 
or removed altogether. And when system changes are required to sup-
port the process improvement, the future state of the process (defined by 
the team) helps to articulate system requirements, while the team guides 
their design, selection, development, implementation, maintenance, and 
support.
Lean IT thus encourages team-driven, iterative, small, and rapid changes 
to business processes and the supporting information systems. IT and 
business associates work together, orchestrating change and rigorously 
applying A3 thinking to every situation.
Throughout the rest of this book, we will systematically explore the many 
aspects of Lean IT. We will focus inward, exploring how Lean techniques 
can help improve IT operational excellence. And we will focus outward, 
exploring how the IT organization can integrate, align, and synchronize 
with the business, supporting (and playing a leadership role in) process 
improvement and innovation. Then in the final chapters we will bring it 
all together, providing leadership guidance and a Lean IT transformation 
roadmap, showing the way to a sustainable enterprise transformation.

Lean IT and Business 
Process Improvement
Chapter Objectives
In this chapter we discover how an expanded role for an IT organization 
that embraces Lean can support and promote business process improve-
ment. We will:
•	 Establish IT’s role as a catalyst of business process improvement, 
leading the way in bridging functional silos.
•	 Consider the unintended complexities created by the reengineering 
trend of the 1990s.
•	 Explore the convergence of strategic alignment, information sys-
tems, Lean thinking, and the lessons learned from enterprise-wide 
system implementations.
•	 Examine how a Lean IT organization can deliver agility, best prac-
tices, and effective measurements throughout an organization.
•	 Consider the role of strategy in clarifying priorities, aligning effort, 
and driving innovation.
The command–and-control organization that first emerged in the 1870s 
might be compared to an organism held together by its shell. The corpora-
tion that is now emerging is being designed around a skeleton: information, 
both the corporation’s new integrating system and its articulation.1
—Peter Drucker

70  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
The power of Lean IT includes knowing when not to use technology, 
because the vast majority of problems are caused by faulty processes, 
not people or technology. Unfortunately, organizations often lead with 
a technology solution prior to improving processes, all but guaranteeing 
the installation of new technology on bad processes. Michael Hammer,2 
a pioneer of business process reengineering, called this “paving cow 
paths.” People should initially focus on root causes, creatively improv-
ing processes before considering investments in information systems.
Because existing technology can entrench bad practices, it may even be 
appropriate to remove rather than add technology as a first step. Applying 
creativity before capital eradicates the habitual crutch of rushing to buy 
or build big bang solutions, encouraging ingenuity and resourcefulness 
from within. If the team eventually discovers that a major investment in 
technology is needed, a sound business case can be made based on their 
assessment, lessening internal resistance to change.
At Toyota, the introduction of new technology is considered only after 
processes have been fine-tuned by cross-functional teams. Technology 
interventions are evaluated on their ability to support work processes 
while not distracting attention from value-added activities. In ἀe Toyota 
Way, Jeffrey Liker explains the value of a team-based approach:
Once Toyota has thoroughly gone through this process, it will quickly imple-
ment the new technology. Because of this painstaking process, Toyota will 
typically implement the new technology smoothly without the employee 
resistance and process disruption that other companies often experience.3
People, process, and technology—in that order. Although managers 
and stakeholders are not always comfortable with the patience and disci-
pline required, applying the tools and principles of Lean IT mitigates the 
risks and challenges of enterprise systems. When cross-functional teams 
(including IT participants) define system requirements, they share owner-
ship and the resulting systems are more likely to succeed.
The Coordinating Function of 
Information, IT, and the Lean Office
Most organizations struggle to coordinate behavior throughout the enter-
prise. In the past, management directed workers, assigned specific tasks, 

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  71
controlled activities, and checked results. As workers have become more 
knowledgeable and organizations more complex, this approach has failed 
to consistently deliver productive outcomes.
Today, many companies employ a blend of top-down management and 
bottom-up participation to engage the workforce and address the intrica-
cies and rapid pace of change in modern business. All organizations are 
composed of core functional areas (usually structured as departments) 
that work with one another to deliver a service or product to their custom-
ers. Organizational effectiveness, which often varies dramatically from 
one company to the next, is determined by the degree of coordination and 
alignment of its parts—the greater the coordination and alignment, the 
greater the likelihood that targeted results will be achieved and sustained.
The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence endorses a transformational 
model that characterizes the enterprise as five business systems. Customer 
relations, product and service development, operations, and supply all 
directly create value for the customer. These four functional areas execute 
business processes and provide supporting infrastructure which create 
the organization’s value streams. These functional segments comprise the 
components of a value stream but often function in silos. Management, 
the fifth business system, though not directly creating value to the exter-
nal customer, orchestrates the activities of the other four groups.
From a Lean IT perspective, we view information and information sys-
tems as encompassing this network, because information integrates and 
enables all value streams and supporting processes. Figure  4.1 shows 
information and information systems as a framework, a collection of 
shared and integrating services bringing together the parts to make a 
whole. Information systems play a critical role enabling the coordination 
of activities throughout the enterprise, synergistically providing the means 
by which information and knowledge are collected, processed, stored, 
secured, analyzed, accessed, and shared. The IT organization serves as a 
catalyst for change, an agent that enables, accelerates, and facilitates com-
munication and coordination. Note that we describe IT as an enabler, 
one that enables another to achieve a specific end. It is a misperception 
to think IT “owns” information, when in fact business owners themselves 
are responsible for data quality, and for determining what information is 
needed to run the business.
Beyond these five basic functional groups, the typical enterprise is com-
posed of many more dimensions: business units, divisions, regions, shared 

72  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
services, as well as ad hoc teams formed for projects and improvement 
initiatives. Figure 4.2 illustrates this more complex set of interrelation-
ships supporting enterprise value streams. The degree to which functions 
and shared services are synchronized directly impacts the performance of 
the value streams. Management and associates, equipped with actionable 
information, coordinate functions to create value which flows to the cus-
tomer. Lean IT, the discipline of Lean applied to information, information 
systems, and the IT organization, enables organizational performance by 
improving information quality, flow, and accessibility.
Figure 4.2 can be used to illustrate the basic function of any organi-
zation, in any industry: finance, health care, hospitality, and so on. In 
manufacturing supply chain organizations, information supports the flow 
of work—usually in the form of physical materials. But for many service 
organizations (e.g., insurance and banking) as well as some office func-
tions within manufacturing supply chain organizations, information

is the work product. In any case, because information enables behavior, 
there is direct bottom-line impact from improvements made to informa-
tion systems when these changes reinforce appropriate behaviors.
The Intangible Nature of 
Information Value and Waste
In today’s economy, profitability and market share are driven in large 
part by intangible (often intellectual) assets: information. As Baruch Lev 
explains in Intangibles: Management, Measurement, and Reporting,
Corporate success today is not based any more on production facilities, 
financial capital and ownership, but on invisible and untouchable values—
intangible assets—such as relationships with business partners, brands, 
ideas, business processes, corporate culture, know-how and innovation 
force.4
The intangible nature of information presents unique challenges for 
Lean, particularly in the office. Information waste is less apparent than pro-
duction waste, where errors manifest as increased inventory, wrong parts 
made, increased scrap, and other physical problems. In an office, informa-
tion mistakes are often invisible even as they create the hidden costs of 
corrections and rework. Waste is often disguised as useful, normal  work.
When communication (electronic, written, or verbal) is not clear, com-
plete, and correct (the three Cs), work and the supporting information 
must flow backward to its source for clarifications, completions, and cor-
rections. Correcting information mistakes steals precious time, robbing 
attention from the work at hand and disrupting flow. In many organiza-
tions, however, people have become so accustomed to correcting mistakes 
that they no longer question them or seek their root cause—plodding 
through their days in quiet frustration. There is a painful truth to the old 
adage, “We never have time to do it right the first time, but we always make 
the time to fix the problem later.” However, the downstream consequences 
of a single information defect can proliferate widely throughout the enter-
prise and its information systems, and often cannot entirely be identified 
and corrected.

When kaizen teams perform value stream mapping, they often discover 
that over 95 percent of the time, no value is added to products and services 
as they move through the value stream. Information waste* is frequently 
discovered to be a major cause. While some complexity is inherent to the 
nature of business processes, much complexity is unnecessary and self-
imposed. We believe much of the unnecessary complexity is an outcome of 
the reengineering trend of the 1990s. While significant productivity gains 
were achieved during this period, the relentless pursuit of hyper-efficiency 
and automation in some cases introduced overdesign and over-processing. 
Aggressively pursuing automation limited flexibility and ability to change. 
Over time, new products, services, and their supporting systems gener-
ated a seemingly endless collection of intricately interwoven processes and 
software, resulting in layers of non-value-adding activity. The psychologi-
cal inertia that was created remains very strong and resistant to change.
For example, during a kaizen project to improve information flow, one 
client discovered that its billing department used a seven-part invoice 
which required an elaborate physical filing system. The team asked when 
the invoicing system was implemented and why. They were surprised to 
learn that the elaborate paper-shuffling system had been in use for 15 
years to fulfill a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) 
record-keeping requirement, but that NASA had not placed an order in 10 
years. As this story illustrates, wasteful processes are often indistinguish-
able after becoming entrenched as tribal knowledge: the unexamined way 
things have always been done around here.
IT Brings Systems Perspective to Business Process Improvement
Responsibility for coordinating process improvement efforts lies with pro-
cess owners: those individuals accountable for process outcomes. Ideally, 
process owners have the authority and ability to make necessary changes. 
However, they aren’t always authorized to oversee improvements at a pro-
cess level because traditional silo organization structures often fail to sup-
port matrix management, that is, management that creates a horizontal 
flow of authority by drawing people from different functional disciplines 
to support department-spanning processes without removing them from 
their respective positions.5
*	 Various forms of information waste are discussed in Chapter 3 and Appendix C.

76  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Local optimization of departmental goals rarely, if ever, lead to systemic 
value stream improvements that impact end customers. For example, 
reducing the error rate in an insurance claim intake process seems to be a 
worthy goal, at least to those in the claims department. However, if down-
stream processes (damage estimates, appraisals, settlements, etc.) are not 
taken into account, the impact of improving the intake process alone may 
not be realized by the customer in terms of time, quality, or cost.
Although people understand that process improvements should span 
functional boundaries, most organizations naturally operate in functional 
silos focusing on localized objectives. Measurements are the primary rea-
son for this shortsightedness, since they create incentives that influence 
localized perspective and behavior. “Look at my numbers. My area is OK, 
so it must be you!” is an indication that silo thinking is alive and well. 
When measures center on departmental financial performance, efficiency, 
and cost control, people shift their focus away from what counts most to 
the customer: performance of the entire value stream. To sustain Lean 
improvement, existing measures and incentives must be revisited with a 
systems thinking perspective and a focus on customer value.
To make matters worse, process owners may not have the experience 
or point of view to see information waste and assess information flows. 
IT professionals, equipped with the principles and tools of Lean IT, bring 
a systems perspective to problem solving, and an understanding of the 
underlying information system functions and interrelationships that 
are hidden from most users. IT associates can thus contribute to process 
improvement by providing a systems perspective on business problems, 
and participating in seemingly nontechnical improvement activities, 
while informing the team of technical considerations.
A clear understanding of roles is necessary for overall value stream 
improvement. By working in cross-functional teams and creating value 
stream maps which reveal the entire process, all participants learn to see 
how their individual functions support (or hinder) the flow of value to the 
customer. The IT organization, as a shared service playing a supporting 
role, sits outside the functional silos, possessing a bird’s-eye perspective 
that enables it to see information flow from end to end. IT staff are there-
fore in a unique position to understand the interdependencies, complexi-
ties, redundancies, and inefficiencies of information flow and information 
systems—understanding the weaknesses of the current state is the first 
step to improving a process.

Enterprise Software Applications and 
the Ghosts of Projects Past
Given the volume and intricacy of transactions in a typical office envi-
ronment (consider procurement, accounting, and customer service), elec-
tronic information systems have been developed to address the effective 
management of information throughout the enterprise. Common enter-
prise systems include enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer rela-
tionship management (CRM), and product lifecycle management (PLM). 
Many industries have their own specialized core information systems, 
such as healthcare information systems (HCIS), banking and insurance 
transactional systems, hospitality reservation systems, and airline ticket-
ing and scheduling systems. When successfully implemented, such large-
scale, integrated, enterprise-wide systems enable continuous improvement 
by automating and error-proofing routine tasks, centralizing data, and 
supporting the smooth and uninterrupted flow of information and work 
across all dimensions of the enterprise. Such applications are the operating 
system of the organization.
However, the benefits of enterprise-wide systems come at a price. Such 
massive software applications are inherently complex, expensive, risky, 
and resistant to change. When poorly implemented, organizations expe-
rience a frustrating drain of energy and focus from wrestling with the 
system and expending precious creativity on workarounds. In fact, studies 
show* that the majority of large-scale software implementations fall short 
of delivering anticipated benefits and return on investment (ROI). This 
happens for many reasons: lack of leadership involvement, misalignment 
of objectives, poorly designed processes, resistance to change, extensive 
customization, and poor project management, just to name a few. One 
organization invested over $50M in a global ERP system only to discover 
after going live that process improvement efforts had become significantly 
more difficult due to the inflexibility of the new system. In fact, staff had 
to be hired to support additional data entry requirements!
When witnessing the aftermath of ERP and other enterprise-wide 
implementations, we often discover an underlying assumption that the 
new system would deliver best practices and effectively address broken or 
missing processes. Some mistakenly expect these applications to be a silver 
*	 See the CHAOS report, Figure 3.1

bullet that will remedy years of undocumented processes, workarounds, 
and fragmented information systems. As a result, they lead with a technol-
ogy solution before defining and improving core processes—a recipe for 
disaster. Ironically, during implementation many companies can’t resist 
the temptation to customize the new enterprise system to mimic old pro-
cedures, repeating the old bad practices.
So what is the correct approach? Our first experience with the conver-
gence of strategic alignment, information systems, and Lean thinking 
came nearly 15 years ago, with our involvement in ERP selection and 
implementation projects, reaching a crescendo during the Year 2000 
(Y2K)* market frenzy. Popular software selection methodologies led many 
companies to pursue ERP software suppliers with excessively detailed 
“request for proposal” documents followed by exhaustive demonstrations 
which often explored every system capability, regardless of their relevance. 
The most qualified vendors and consultants were already quite busy, and 
this wasteful approach would often just scare them away.
Without a solid grasp of specifically targeted outcomes, or a clear under-
standing of the strategic intent of the new system, selection teams were 
susceptible to choosing the most persuasive sales presentation, rather than 
the best match to their requirements. The resulting systems were often 
unnecessarily complex, highly customized, and eerily similar to the legacy 
systems they had just replaced. This was because selection teams rarely left 
their comfort zones, and so their selection requirements were incremen-
tal enhancements, based on mental models of their current system. As a 
result, many of these very expensive, large-scale systems failed to deliver 
breakthrough improvements; these organizations settled for new systems 
that were only slightly better than those they replaced. Unfortunately, 
these new systems often cemented current business processes into place 
for many years to follow.
Early in our practice we engaged cross-functional teams in improve-
ment of key enterprise processes, emphasizing a critical differentiators 
approach, helping the company to identify a handful of key issues (stra-
tegic drivers) that would successfully guide the selection among dozens 
of ERP candidates. Not only did this streamline the selection process, 
making it less time-consuming and costly, but it also helped the team

entrenched legacy systems prior to January 1, 2000, for fear these systems would fail.

focus on the critical drivers for success, what the system would do dif-
ferently to actually improve the performance of the company in ways 
that really mattered. Strategic objectives, when understood by the team, 
naturally began to blend with enterprise software selection and imple-
mentation practices.
The Efficiency–Flexibility Trade-Off: Agility
The necessity to operate efficiently is a given, but it’s also important to be 
responsive and adaptive as customer needs change and new opportuni-
ties emerge. Organizations should strive for agility: an appropriate bal-
ance between efficiency and flexibility. Efficiency means performing work 
well without wasted effort (using fewer resources), while flexibility entails 
responding to change quickly with limited disruption. This relationship is 
illustrated in Figure 4.3.
At one end of the continuum is efficiency, where Lean focuses on waste 
reduction, visual management, standard work, and ongoing process 
improvement. At the other end of the continuum is flexibility, where Lean 
applies the voice of the customer, demand management, just-in-time, level 
scheduling, small lot sizes, mixed model production, cross-training, and 
other techniques to create flow (see Chapter 5). Efficiency minimizes costs, 
while flexibility creates value by maximizing responsiveness; agility is the

balance point between these two capabilities. In Business Agility, Michael 
Hugo explains,
Efficiency provides us with basic products and services at the lowest price. 
Responsiveness wraps those products and services in a blanket of value-
added services that customize them to our particular needs, and in doing 
so, makes them more valuable to each of us.6
IT professionals, as well as all process owners and knowledge workers, 
should be aware of this trade-off between cost and value when improving 
processes, in order to sustain the appropriate balance. Another useful way 
of looking at the efficiency–flexibility continuum is through the distinc-
tion between process and practice.
Process versus Practice
At its core, Lean IT supports process improvement by providing the right 
information, at the right time, in the right format, to the right audience. 
The usefulness of information is determined by the nature of work being 
performed. In this regard, it’s helpful to differentiate work as either pro-
cess or practice to better understand what type of information is needed. 
Throughout this book, we use the term process to describe a series of 
actions or operations supported by structured information. Processes are 
activities that are generally repetitive, well-defined, routine, controllable, 
and standardized. In contrast, practices are nonroutine, highly variable, 
loosely defined, and require a degree of judgment and experience to carry 
out.
To illustrate the distinction, consider a visit to your doctor. The nurse 
visits you first and performs standard, routine procedures (takes your 
blood pressure, temperature, etc.)—this is process work. When the doc-
tor arrives, she reviews your chart and asks how you are feeling. Then she 
proceeds to examine, diagnose, and prescribe based on your symptoms 
and medical history, supported by her experience and professional judg-
ment—this is practice work. Society tends to describe professions (such as 
legal, accounting, and medical) that depend on a great deal of education, 
judgment, and unstructured information processing as practices.
The difference between process and practice influences how improve-
ments should be approached and what type of information best supports 

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  81
the work. In Product Lifecycle Management, Michael Grieves explains the 
important difference, as well as a common pitfall that leads to hyper-effi-
ciency at the expense of flexibility:
The information requirements are different for practices than those of pro-
cesses. With processes, the focus is on the movement from state to state 
as quickly as possible. With practices, the focus is on collecting data and 
information at each state in order to build a pool of information to improve 
the recognition of patterns in the future. However, when processes and 
practices are both part of a task or procedure that is being automated, the 
information goals of the practice often get minor attention.7
The better defined a process is, the more efficiently it can be exe-
cuted. Process standardization creates efficiencies, and information 
systems should be designed to reinforce explicitly defined procedures. 
Efficient processes are fortified when information systems automate 
routine tasks, such as mistake-proofing data entry, and providing feed-
back for ongoing improvement. Applying the 80/20 rule, simplifying 
and automating the 20 percent of core processes that account for 80 
percent of the volume and burden can make a significant and immedi-
ate impact on efficiency, freeing up human capacity for practices that 
require experience and judgment
On the other hand, information used in practice work is typically 
unstructured, difficult to define, and often experiential. When improv-
ing practices, the focus is on supporting a learning organization through 
an accessible collection of knowledge of past experiences to enable situa-
tion-specific decision making. To support practice work, knowledge man-
agement systems should be designed to manage both unstructured data 
(searchable content, documents, and images) and structured data (infor-
mation in transactional databases, drilldown reports, trend analyses, etc.). 
They may also provide access to collaborative social networks, forums, 
blogs, wikis, and other sources of free-form knowledge sharing.
Over time, some of the elements of practice work may be simplified and 
standardized into processes, effectively creating more efficiency without 
sacrificing agility. Successful organizations attempt to achieve an optimal 
balance between process and practice which has been described as mass 
customization: the ability to produce products and services with the flex-
ibility to meet a wide range of customer needs while maintaining mass 

82  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
production efficiency (discussed in Chapter 5). With a clear understand-
ing of the differences between process and practice, IT associates (work-
ing with the business) are better able to provide appropriate information, 
contributing to the evolution of business processes and practices.
What Processes and Practices Are “Best”?
Individuals and organizations need clear targets to focus improvement 
efforts, assess progress, and motivate change. The term best practice is 
often used to describe what companies are seeking from process improve-
ment and information systems. But what are best practices, and how are 
they applied to effectively guide ongoing improvement? In Winning the 
Knowledge Transfer Race, Michael English and William Baker define 
a best practice as one that “fully satisfies customers, produces superior 
results in one operation, performs as reliably as any alternative, and can 
be adopted elsewhere.”8
A common misperception is that best practices create competitive 
advantage. In fact, best practices create parity among organizations as 
they conform to the same standards. Competitive advantage comes from 
differentiating your organization through continuous learning, improve-
ment, and innovation.
The majority of knowledge is stored typically inside the minds of work-
ers and not explicitly documented, causing everyone to perform the same 
work differently. Inconsistent behavior, by definition, cannot be consis-
tently improved, since there is no established stable baseline from which 
to start. When process and practice knowledge belongs only to certain 
people, outcomes remain inconsistent, and knowledge is lost when they 
leave. But once tribal knowledge becomes stabilized, standardized, docu-
mented, and shared with others, processes can be continuously improved 
and meaningfully measured. As organizations purposely identify core 
processes, assess their effectiveness, and document procedures, they make 
knowledge management a natural part of work. As best practices are 
documented, they secure the value of the organization’s intangible, intel-
lectual assets. These are process assets that consistently add value to the 
customer and create a foundation for continuous improvement and inno-

vation, providing distinction, competitive differentiation, and advantage 
to the organization.
The Capability Maturity Model (CMM),9,* shown in Figure 4.4, helps 
an organization assess how well processes are defined and systemati-
cally improved. The model provides a framework for assessing process 
capability, progressing from unpredictable process outcomes to stable, 
continuously improving processes.
Benchmarking: No Need to Reinvent the Wheel
Learning organizations are constantly searching for ways to do things 
better (continuous improvement) and to do better things (innovation). 
Rather than reinventing the wheel, they often look internally as well 
as externally for best practices they can readily apply. Benchmarking 
identifies and evaluates best practices within the organization as well 
*	 Originally developed in the field of software development and introduced in 1989 by Watts 
Humphrey in Managing the software process, the Capability Maturity Model can be applied to 
assess the quality and impact of business processes in any discipline or industry.

as across other organizations and industries to assess performance and 
set improvement targets and long-range goals. As companies embark 
on an ongoing search for better ways of doing work, they develop inno-
vative future-state possibilities and targets. The basic steps of bench-
marking include:
	
1.	Understand your current processes in terms of effectiveness (mea-
sures and current levels of performance) and maturity (use value 
stream mapping to identify waste and determine where to focus 
improvement efforts).
	
2.	Set your focus by determining what business process you are 
investigating.
	
3.	Identify what organizations and industries have similar processes 
and are potential leaders.
	
4.	Research and contact leading companies to identify best practices 
and performance metrics (through the American Productivity and 
Quality Center [APQC], the Global Benchmarking Council, trade 
journals, conferences, and so on).
	
5.	Collaborate with these organizations to share best practice informa-
tion. (This works best when companies agree to exchange informa-
tion beneficial to all parties within a benchmarking group.)
	
6.	Identify gaps and opportunities for improvement, feed these ideas as 
suggestions and potential countermeasures into the kaizen process.
	
7.	Implement improved business practices with realistic metrics, goals, 
and targets applying PDCA.
Internal benchmarking involves assessing operations from within the 
organization (e.g., business units in different countries or other divisions). 
These groups are often more accessible and willing to share proprietary 
information. And if practices are adopted across the same organization, 
there may be less resistance to change. However, the best innovations 
often come from exploring the best practices of seemingly unrelated 
industries; organizations can use benchmarking to break out of their 
industry paradigms to discover breakthrough ideas. For example, an 
airline might benchmark a leading hotel chain to discover best practices 
regarding check-in and baggage-handling procedures. A hospital could 
investigate a leading restaurant franchise to gain knowledge of order-pro-
cessing best practices. And a surgical team could observe a NASCAR pit 

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  85
crew to gather best-practice ideas relating to speed, accuracy, safety, and 
economy of motion. External benchmarking can help a team break away 
from existing assumptions and thought patterns to discover entirely new 
ways of approaching work.
Using Measurement Effectively
Tracking actual performance against planned targets, workers preemp-
tively respond to potential problems by applying management by fact—
basing priorities and future improvement initiatives on quantifiable, 
objective outcomes. Although we all know measurements are important, 
organizations often struggle to find good measurements that influence 
desired behavior. Michael Hammer described seven common, deadly 
sins10 of performance measures (paraphrased below):
	
1.	Measuring only what you are good at
	
2.	Measuring departmental process, not the entire process
	
3.	Measuring corporate goals, not customer satisfaction
	
4.	Not investing adequate effort to determine what should be measured
	
5.	Measuring only small pieces of the process
	
6.	Not considering the impact of measurements on behavior
	
7.	Not taking measurements seriously
We’ve all heard the saying, “Show me how you’ll measure me and I’ll 
tell you how I’ll perform.” Effective measurements focus people’s atten-
tion on the right things. Sustained improvement requires appropriate 
performance measures, monitoring, and management. Without appropri-
ate measures and the actionable information they provide, it’s just a mat-
ter of time before behaviors revert to the old ways of getting work done. 
Measures guard against backsliding by focusing improvement efforts as 
well as daily activities, emphasizing targeted results.
Often measures are taken, posted, and filed, but not utilized to drive 
behavior. Effective organizations use constant goal setting supported by a 
continuous measurement feedback loop to reinforce daily behavior which 
drives positive change. If measurements do not enable people to move the 

86  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
dial, they become a burden and detract from value-added work, and are 
ultimately rejected.
Measures play an essential role in the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, provid-
ing the check with which teams act and adjust based on process results. 
When used properly, they serve as an early warning system, notifying the 
right people when course corrections and adjustments are required before 
serious problems occur, often triggering the next cycle of improvement 
activity.
Measurements also validate whether process improvements have gener-
ated expected results. Because of their influence on daily behavior, we sug-
gest using 30-, 60-, and 90-day post-kaizen reviews to make certain that 
process improvements have delivered as expected, and to prevent back-
sliding to old patterns of behavior.
Organizations often focus on results measures to assess performance 
and guide decision making. These are often strategic and track end-of-pipe 
outcomes such as revenue and customer satisfaction. While important, 
results measurements provide lagging indicators of performance, offering 
little predictive value. Exclusively using results measures is like driving 
forward while only looking through the rearview mirror. Process mea-
sures are leading indicators which focus on tactical activities that directly 
or indirectly influence results measures. Figure 4.5 shows some examples 
of process and results measures.
Teams should develop an appropriate balance between process and 
results measures for each value stream. They should also give attention to

what is measured. Many companies focus predominantly on revenue and 
operating expenses. While these are important, revenue and expenses are 
indirectly controlled by other factors. The balanced scorecard framework* 
emphasizes a healthy balance of internal and external perspectives, apply-
ing financial and operational performance, customer satisfaction, and 
employee development and innovation measures.
The IT organization plays a key role, helping the rest of the organiza-
tion to access data, summarize information, and present measurements, 
providing clear feedback to the individuals and teams responsible for 
performing and improving business processes. IT associates provide the 
enabling tools and access to data sources, working with the organization’s 
knowledge workers so they can develop meaningful measurements and 
analytics (see Chapter 6).
Compliance: A Special Form of Measurement
The burden of complying with regulations can be overwhelming, espe-
cially in heavily regulated industries such as banking, health care, insur-
ance, and transportation. In many organizations, compliance represents 
necessary but non-value-added activity that consumes massive amounts 
of resources and mindshare. In their attempt to quickly conform to 
regulatory requirements, companies often build a maze of stand-alone 
“end-of-pipe” solutions, each with a unique results focus exclusive to a 
functional silo of the business.
While these point solutions monitor certain activities and compliance 
data, they seldom address root causes of compliance problems, and thus 
do not enable continuous improvement. Compliance of this sort delivers 
marginal and temporary value at best, while adding layers of complex-
ity and non-value-added work; this reduces agility, making the processes 
more resistant to improvement.
Dr. W. Edwards Deming, perhaps the most influential quality pioneer 
of our time, used to say that “you can’t inspect quality into a process,” 
knowing that quality must instead be built into a process. In the same way, 
you can’t inspect sustainable compliance into a process; you must stabilize 
and improve processes so that compliance is a natural outcome. The tools 
and principles of Lean enable organizations to take control of business 
*	  See Robert Kaplan and David Norton, ἀe balanced scorecard: Translating strategy into action.

88  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
processes, adopt best practices, and develop process maturity, ensuring 
compliance with standard work and regulatory requirements.
Lean provides a framework for managing change and controlling 
operations—foundations of compliance. The financial officer of one 
client, a global, publicly traded company, referred to Lean as “the Holy 
Grail of Sarbanes-Oxley.” In his opinion, every hour and every dollar 
spent chasing compliance should be refocused on improving processes.
Business Process Management (BPM)
As process improvement expands throughout the enterprise, an orga-
nization may reach a point where the scale and complexity of business 
processes and improvement activities require a formal business process 
management approach. Without a structured approach and supporting 
tools, the difficulty and overhead of managing the intricate interdepen-
dencies of enterprise value stream and information system improvements 
can be daunting. This is particularly true in larger organizations with 
multisite and multi-division operations.
A holistic enterprise process viewpoint is not easily achieved, due to 
the multidimensional nature of enterprise value streams and support-
ing processes, shared services, projects, resources, and stakeholders. 
However, if an organization is unable to identify its value streams, its 
supporting processes, and their interrelationships, it will be unable to 
make valid fact-based prioritization decisions on process improvements 
and IT investments.
Business process management is as much a philosophy of how to man-
age process improvement as it is a collection of technology-based tools. 
Nevertheless, as a Lean transformation matures beyond the early, low-
hanging-fruit improvements, such a framework is often necessary to guide 
improvement efforts and align enterprise priorities.
Though an organization may not need an elaborate BPM software 
system, it will need a good infrastructure approach, with a sound 
schema to identify and categorize processes, manage ownership and 
team composition, track improvement activities and results, and con-
trol changes to process maps, documentation, and other artifacts. A 
disciplined approach is also helpful to organize metrics, dashboards, 

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  89
and scorecards into a coherent enterprise-wide measurement system. 
Such process management and measurement information systems are 
often internally developed, and adapt over time to meet the evolving 
needs of management and the Lean Center of Excellence. Larger orga-
nizations will need a database to manage the many value streams and 
supporting processes, and their information system interdependencies, 
since tracking on a spreadsheet can be labor intensive and error-prone.
There are several categories of tools and systems that can help an orga-
nization manage its process information:
•	 Value stream and process mapping software– such as Visio and eVSM
•	 Process management repositories and systems
•	 Workflow technologies with rules engines—available as stand-alone 
applications and built into many ERP systems
•	 Process simulation tools—available as stand-alone applications and 
integrated with BPM systems
•	 BPM systems—integrated systems supporting mapping, data 
repositories, workflow, simulation tools, and interfaces to ERP 
applications
While we mention these applications to shed some light on how organi-
zations may automate the complexity of process management, it’s impor-
tant to note that an organization should be careful not to invest heavily 
in technology and automation at first, but rather focus on the social and 
management systems issues. Hammer suggests:
The critical elements in success with process are executive leadership, cre-
ativity to come up with new ideas, the management of change, and the 
management of complex implementation. None of these have much to do 
with software tools. Yes, BPM software can help … but it’s not the differ-
ence between success and failure.11
Whatever systems an organization employs to manage its business 
process infrastructure, it should stress simplicity, transparency, and 
manageability.

Prioritizing Process Improvement with Strategy
Consistent and continuous focus on strategic drivers and critical differ-
entiators helps the business develop a clear understanding of how each 
process adds value, so trade-off and investment decisions (including but 
not limited to IT investments) will optimize strategic outcomes.
One way to achieve this clarity is to separate processes into two catego-
ries: supporting and innovating.
Supporting Processes
Supporting processes are those that are necessary for the business to oper-
ate, but do not create differentiation in the eyes of the customer. These 
include many repetitive or transactional accounting and administrative 
activities, as well as many inwardly facing IT operations.
Efficiency should be the primary goal for supporting processes; thus, 
they should be rigorously stabilized, simplified, standardized, automated—
and ideally eliminated whenever possible. We are often astonished at how 
Lean companies think outside the box, eliminating many long-standing 
supporting functions that are so common they are assumed to be neces-
sary. For example, we have seen cases where procurement and payment 
processes were eliminated, applying just-in-time and kanban approaches, 
so that receiving a shipment instantly triggers release of supplier payment. 
No invoice is ever printed, mailed, received, handled, matched, entered, or 
archived by the accounts payable department, eliminating countless trans-
actions, errors, paper, time, and other wastes traditionally associated with 
the process.
Year-on-year reduction of supporting process operating costs, with-
out sacrificing service levels, often requires investment in automation. 
This in turn can necessitate a move toward flexible service-oriented 
architectures and low-cost utility cloud computing (whether internally 
or externally hosted) and the potential for selective outsourcing. But 
here we strongly caution not to simplify, automate, or outsource sup-
porting processes when they can be eliminated altogether. Nor should 
companies create overly complex, hyper-efficient, automated processes 
which result in near-term cost savings at the expense of long-term 
agility.

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  91
An example of significant reduction in supporting process costs can be 
found with Bechtel, one of the world’s largest engineering firms. Bechtel 
made dramatic improvements through data center consolidation, server 
virtualization, and private (internally hosted) cloud computing. In 2005, 
more than 2,000 IT employees staffed approximately 20 datacenters, where 
server utilization averaged between 2 and 3 percent. In 2009, a department 
of 1,100 employees operates just three datacenters, where server utilization 
averages 60–70 percent.12
While projects like this can yield significant positive results for the 
enterprise, if not managed properly they can also spread fear throughout 
the IT organization. Even the perception of potential layoffs will throw 
a wet blanket on a Lean effort; few will enthusiastically support process 
improvement if they fear losing their job as a result. Herein lies a funda-
mental distinction between a focus on cost-cutting and an emphasis on 
adding value through waste elimination, which naturally results in cost 
reduction over time. A focus on cost reduction through rapid headcount 
reduction is like losing weight by giving blood—while it works quickly, 
it isn’t very healthy. The key to Lean success in a cost-cutting world is to 
understand waste reduction as an opportunity to free up human capacity 
and capability for value-added work.
While waste elimination naturally reduces many costs in the short term, 
it also adds long-term value by unleashing potential for growth and inno-
vation. Most companies do not have a shortage of good people with good 
ideas; these people are just buried under a mountain of wasteful activity 
disguised as daily work. Every time we free up people’s time, emancipating 
them from unnecessary and often frustrating work, we enable them to apply 
their experience and creativity to perform new value-adding activities: these 
include improving, innovating, and spending quality time with the cus-
tomer (see the Virginia Mason Medical Center case study). Underutilized 
human potential is the gold mine hidden within every company.
Successfully retraining and reassigning IT associates quickly, so they 
can become productive in a new function or area of the company, is accel-
erated by the tools and methods of Lean transformation. Once an indi-
vidual develops proficiency with A3 thinking and problem solving, for 
example, he or she can quickly get to the heart of any process and confi-
dently start contributing to its improvement.
As IT infrastructure and applications continue their inevitable migra-
tion toward a low-cost cloud computing model, the emphasis of the IT 

92  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
organization must quickly shift toward process leadership and innovation, 
concentrating on the strategic drivers within each value stream. And it is 
this freed-up human capacity and potential that will fuel the transition.
Innovating Processes
Innovating processes reinvent the business and establish differentiation in the 
eyes of the customer. Innovating processes may include the development of 
new products, services, markets, and partnerships; information systems often 
play a direct and vital role. For example, e-commerce and social-networking 
applications deliver self-service value (choice, convenience, speed, knowledge, 
community, etc.) directly into the hands of the customer.
Over their life cycle, innovations often evolve into standard products, 
services, and processes—and, at some point, their ability to create compet-
itive advantage diminishes. According to Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, 
in their Harvard Business Review article “Strategic Intent,” the essence of 
strategy lies in creating tomorrow’s competitive advantages faster than 
competitors mimic the ones you possess today.13 In Nike’s case, for exam-
ple, in the highly competitive athletic garment industry, some product life 
cycles are less than 90 days. In general, the toughest competitors often 
discontinue a product family before its life cycle goes into decline, causing 
their competitors to forever chase their next product release. Innovation 
can never rest.
As organizations learn to distinguish critical differentiators in their 
processes, they can invest their IT dollars more effectively. For exam-
ple, many manufacturing companies are focusing their investments 
on operating technologies within core value streams, such as product 
life cycle management (PLM) and manufacturing process management 
(MPM), directly enhancing their ability to design, produce, and deliver 
their products and services.14 This is accompanied by a correspond-
ing de-emphasis on necessary but non-value-adding (NNVA) business 
processes and supporting IT assets, such as many of the supporting 
processes performed by back-office ERP systems. Other industries 
are following suit, directing less attention on NNVA and emphasiz-
ing direct, end-customer-facing operating processes (e.g., bank loan 
approvals, insurance claim processing, and medical laboratory order 
scheduling). In fact, in many information-intensive industries, such as 
banking, insurance, and often health care, the operating information 

Lean IT and Business Process Improvement  •  93
system is the production process, and information is the work product 
delivered to the customer.
This trend illustrates how IT innovation and differentiation are driven 
by awareness of customer value. If the IT organization is going to play an 
even greater role in the improvement and automation of mission-critical, 
customer-facing operational processes, then IT–business–customer col-
laboration is essential.
Innovating processes are often practices, different from standardized, 
repeatable processes as we discussed earlier in this chapter, requiring 
more human interaction, experience, insight, and judgment, supported by 
accessible structured and unstructured information. Innovating processes 
break new ground and often require multidisciplinary cooperation both 
within and across traditional boundaries of the enterprise. A new idea can 
come from anyone, anywhere, anytime. Thus innovating processes benefit 
from innovative information systems* which facilitate open communica-
tion and knowledge sharing, enabling continuous and rapid learning.
Let’s be clear—information and information systems do not drive inno-
vation; they support and enable it. There is only one thing that ultimately 
drives value through innovation: the voice of the customer. So we must 
learn to listen carefully, engaging all our senses, which can be extended 
and amplified through our digital nervous system.
IT process leaders and business process owners must together under-
stand the distinction between supporting and innovating processes, 
illustrated in Figure 4.6. With this understanding, accompanied by a con-
stancy of purpose, IT leadership can guide the enterprise toward efficient 
supporting processes, while simultaneously enabling innovating processes 
to create new, differentiating, revenue-generating value for the customer.
The IT Organization’s Contribution
Throughout this book we explore the goal of alignment between IT and 
the core business in which IT and the business start thinking and acting as 
one, with a common purpose: to support the strategy of the organization.
*	 Some examples include collaboration tools, project management, product lifecycle management, 
business intelligence, market research and analytics, online surveys, social networking, design, 
modeling, and visualization tools.

94  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
But alignment is an ambiguous word and doesn’t convey the full picture. 
IT and the business must work side by side as partners: learning, prioritiz-
ing, planning, executing, and measuring the results of process improve-
ment and innovation initiatives. For such a tightly woven relationship we 
prefer the term integration. But no matter what you choose to call it, how 
you go about achieving it is the real challenge.
Quality information and effective information systems connect, sup-
port, and enable process improvement throughout the enterprise. Because 
information is the essential lifeblood that coordinates the flow of work 
and creation of value to the customer, the contribution of the IT organi-
zation is pivotal to the ultimate success of the organization and its value 
streams. In the end, organizational effectiveness is about each individual 
doing the small things well—seamlessly blending daily work and ongoing 
improvement.

In a Lean enterprise, cross-functional teams work in partnership with 
IT practitioners to improve business processes. In doing so, the IT orga-
nization becomes a partner and enabler of process improvement, shifting 
a large part of its focus from supporting activities to innovative solutions 
development in collaboration with the business.

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean 
Manufacturing: Flow and Pull
Chapter Objectives
Looking back on the last five decades of Lean’s evolution, we find many 
important lessons learned that have a direct applicability to Lean IT, what-
ever the industry. We will:
•	 Examine flow, pull, and visual signals and contrast their simplicity 
and clarity with the complexity of material requirements planning 
(MRP), a popular manufacturing push-scheduling technique.
•	 Explore kanban, heijunka, and mixed model production and under-
stand their impact on stability, efficiency, and flexibility (agility).
•	 Propose a step-by-step process for creating an effective IT demand 
management decision-making process.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
—Leonardo da Vinci
Factories are complex and chaotic places where events rarely go as planned. 
When not approached with caution, software intervention can amplify the 
existing complexity and chaos. Lean manufacturing practitioners have 
learned to simplify their production processes, aligning, balancing, and 
reallocating resources so work will flow along value streams, orchestrating 

98  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
activity through pull signals and visual cues. Work is pulled by customer 
orders rather than pushed by a forecast-driven schedule. At the start of the 
transformation process, Lean practitioners focus on customer value and 
the value stream. Lean practitioners eliminate as waste the obsolete, the 
unnecessarily complex, and the ineffective, including counterproductive 
information systems. Technology is not reintroduced until the underlying 
processes have been simplified and stabilized.*
Since Toyota’s production, product development, and management 
systems laid the foundation for Lean practice, it seems natural to ask 
about their approach to IT to inform our own efforts. There is a com-
monly held misconception that Toyota is reluctant to use information 
technology. Toyota is in fact a significant IT investor and innovator; 
however, they do not lead with technology solutions. They first focus 
on business solutions, with emphasis on stabilizing and improving 
processes through relentless problem solving, supported by appropri-
ate data. Electronic information systems are then carefully deployed to 
automate standard work, reduce the potential for errors, and support 
effective measurement.
Looking beyond Toyota to other large, global, manufacturing and supply 
chain enterprises, Nike’s growth could not have occurred without exten-
sive reliance on pioneering information technologies; their IT organiza-
tion includes nearly 1,500 staff in 60 countries. Over the last decade, Nike 
has made significant investments in a sophisticated technology infrastruc-
ture for product development and supply chain management (not without 
some expensive learning experiences along the way),1 which enables them 
to continuously innovate while improving operating efficiency.
Now that the essential technology framework is in place, Nike has 
turned its focus toward business process improvement as a driving force 
in IT strategy. In fact, the chief information officer (CIO) of Nike reports 
to the chief operating officer, ensuring an operational focus throughout 
all IT initiatives. As an indication of transformation in their culture, the 
globally renowned “Just Do It” company has rebranded their IT depart-
ment as Lean Business Solutions (NikeLBS).
According to Lean Enterprise Director Steve Castellanos, “At Nike, we 
turned our Lean focus toward the enterprise some years ago and as we did 
*	 For more on Lean IT in a manufacturing environment, see Lean enterprise systems, using IT for 
continuous improvement, Chapters 4 and 5, by Steve Bell

it became evident that our information technology delivery model was out 
of sync with the business processes that they were designed to support. This 
realization was the driver behind the organizational changes that brought the 
former IT and Process Excellence organizations together into what we now 
call Lean Business Solutions. With this structure our intent is to position LBS 
against enterprise-wide opportunities in an aligned and synchronized way.”2
Another global supply chain organization, Tesco, has been on their Lean 
journey for over a decade, with a particular emphasis on essential infor-
mation systems. The fourth-largest global retailer drives growth through 
innovation with small, local stores selling fresh and innovative products. 
By simplifying and standardizing their business processes and informa-
tion systems, Tesco is able to open new stores quickly, while adapting to 
local market conditions and consumer preferences.
Tesco’s supply chain systems operate by Lean replenishment rules that 
issue pull signals directly to suppliers on a daily basis. Unlike traditional 
retail models, this system does not rely solely on forecasts of consumer 
purchases. Daily consumption and replenishment signals help reduce 
inventory, handling, shrinkage, and stockouts, helping Tesco to ensure 
variety and freshness, while quickly spotting new trends and emerging 
problems. It’s interesting to note that Taiichi Ohno’s early inspiration for 
just-in-time inventory replenishment came on a visit to the United States, 
where he observed refrigerated products being replenished from behind as 
they were pulled off the shelves of supermarket coolers. So, in Tesco’s case, 
Lean has come full circle.
But even with Tesco’s strategic focus on market growth and advanced 
supply chain technology, it’s clear that it has internalized the primary 
focus of Lean: customer value. According to Mike Yorweth, Tesco’s group 
technology and architecture director, “We’re such a big business and it’s … 
complex. So you’ve got to make everything as simple as you possibly can, 
and standardizing makes things simple for people. If their jobs are easier 
to do, it means they can focus on customers. Ultimately that’s what we’re 
here for.”3
Toyota, Nike, Tesco, and countless other innovative manufacturing and 
supply chain organizations around the world have successfully leveraged 
IT capabilities with their Lean practices in a variety of ways. But it’s not 
just about big companies; the efficiency and lower costs of Lean operations 
and information systems create opportunities for small, agile companies 
to compete with larger ones.

Push versus Pull: What Went Wrong with MRP?
One of the key IT lessons learned from decades of Lean manufacturing is 
to keep processes and supporting information systems simple. Nowhere is 
this more evident than in the history of material requirements planning 
(MRP), a method used to calculate what needs to be purchased and built 
based on routings, bills of materials, inventory levels, and other planning 
information.
In the 1960s computers started tackling many of the most complex chal-
lenges that business had to offer, including material planning and control. 
After all, if we could put a man into space, why couldn’t we control what 
happens on a factory floor? Operations managers adopted a mechanistic 
view, creating the discipline of MRP. George Plossl, one of the founding 
fathers of MRP, describes these times as full of hope and promise, as well 
as unrealistic expectations:
Operations researchers were intrigued by the problem of determining 
“optimum” work sequence in complex manufacturing environments. MRP 
program designers, obsessed with the potential power of computers and 
software, attempted to build into MRP capabilities to cope with every even-
tuality in manufacturing, and to include every known technique, however 
little use these would be.4
In simple terms, MRP combines customer orders and forecasted customer 
demand for each finished goods item, then explodes it into time-phased 
component-level requirements to guide purchasing and production deci-
sions. MRP calculations determine what needs to be manufactured at each 
workcenter and when, creating a never-ending stream of production sched-
ules and dispatch lists—detailed marching orders for the shop floor. This 
is push scheduling, where every factory operation is planned in advance—
much like a football coach calling all the plays before the game begins.
The problem is that the plan is never exactly right. First of all, it’s mostly 
based on a forecast, and forecasts are just sophisticated guesses. Plus, 
conditions on the factory floor are always changing—machines break 
down without notice, sudden rush orders delay others, defects unexpect-
edly consume scarce materials, and so on. Although powerful computers 
and MRP software are able to rapidly recalculate each time something 
changes, frequent changes cause the schedule to become jittery or nervous. 

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean Manufacturing: Flow and Pull  •  101
Constant interruptions and shifting priorities, when communicated to 
the shop floor, cause workers to spend more time and energy chasing the 
schedule and performing costly machine changeovers (often making them 
jittery and nervous, too). So planners attempt to compensate by buffering 
with excess inventory, stocking more than is necessary in order to ride out 
variability while making fewer changes to the production schedule.
But as companies offer more options to their customers, as supply chains 
become more complex and geographically extended, and as customers 
continue demanding shorter lead times, the amount of excess inventory 
needed to buffer increasing uncertainty inevitably reaches a tipping point. 
Taiichi Ohno of Toyota identified excess inventory, and the overproduc-
tion (non-just-in-time) that created it, to be the primary causes of waste. 
Furthermore, excess inventory hides other forms of waste, hindering their 
identification and elimination.
Even the most powerful computers and sophisticated software can’t 
solve this fundamental problem: the more we strive to control complexity 
through forecasting and push scheduling, the more the laws of uncertainty 
and chaos push back. So to many Lean manufacturing practitioners, MRP 
is perceived as the enemy of simplicity, agility, and flow.
But there are situations where MRP and other sophisticated planning 
and scheduling software tools are useful in Lean manufacturing and supply 
chain operations, as long as they are applied judiciously, with awareness of 
their limitations. The enemy is not the technology, but our assumption that 
we can somehow control complexity by throwing more complexity at it.
What is the key limiting factor in this scenario? Time! The further into 
the future an organization forecasts, the more uncertainty it must antic-
ipate and buffer against, buying and building more inventory ahead of 
time. And when customer preferences suddenly change, or the economy 
takes a turn, the organization is burdened with this excess inventory. The 
solution is to shorten the planning horizon, to the point where produc-
tion is driven not by a forecast but by actual customer orders. The more 
production is driven by customer pull signals, the less waste is created 
throughout the supply chain.
Just-in-time production is simple to describe, but difficult to achieve. Just 
as products, services, and processes differ from one company to another, 
so do their planning and scheduling requirements. By understanding 
these differences, Lean practitioners in any industry, and IT organizations 
in particular, can understand how to apply Lean flow techniques.

Flow, Balance, and Agility
In 1979, two Harvard Business School professors described a pair of 
continua: a product life cycle based on maturation from individual-unit 
customization to standardization, and a process life cycle describing the 
various methods of production.5 Combining these two continua results 
in a diagonal (Figure 5.1) which describes the progression of manufactur-
ing types: engineer to order, make to order, assemble to order, and make to 
stock—commonly known by the acronyms ETO, MTO, ATO, and MTS.
At the ETO end of the continuum are unique products, individu-
ally designed and custom-made to exact customer specifications. On 
the other end of the continuum, MTS, highly standardized products 
are mass-produced in large quantities to forecast, and are stocked in a 
distribution channel for the customer to buy off the shelf. ETO empha-
sizes flexibility, while MTS emphasizes speed and cost. At this point 
the reader may recall the efficiency–flexibility continuum explored in 
Chapter 4 (see Figure 4.3).

Over the years, manufacturers have developed a variety of tactics to 
provide customers with flexible, configurable products built upon stan-
dard, modular options that can be delivered quickly to customers’ specific 
requirements. This approach, called mass customization, is covered by the 
central region of the diagonal. While some speed and flexibility are sacri-
ficed, and marginal cost is added, the result is agility: the ability to quickly 
respond to changing market conditions and customer demand, based on a 
standard set of configurable products and processes, with minimal inven-
tory in the pipeline.
The full expression of this approach is called mixed model production, 
where each unit flowing on a production line may carry different speci-
fications. At an automobile manufacturer, for example, a red sedan with 
leather interior may be followed immediately by a blue passenger van with 
cloth interior, flowing down the same line at a steady pace. The right mix 
of materials is ready at the point of use, replenished by kanban (discussed 
shortly), and production activities are supported by visual communica-
tions. At any moment a worker discovering a defect may stop the line to 
quickly identify and correct its cause (quality at the source), improving 
process stability and product quality along every step of the process.
Many Lean manufacturers are moving toward this sweet spot of mass 
customization where an agile enterprise can respond to varying customer 
requirements with short lead time and relatively low cost. With a little 
creativity, Lean practitioners in nonmanufacturing applications (includ-
ing IT) find they can apply the diagonal sweet-spot metaphor to their 
own products and services, since it represents an agile balance of effi-
ciency and flexibility.
Let’s try it now. Think of an office process in your company (e.g., process-
ing a medical laboratory order, handling an insurance claim, or making 
a hotel reservation) where most of the time everything is normal and the 
process flows smoothly. But every now and then, a variable is introduced 
that slows the process down. Suddenly the associate doesn’t know exactly 
what to do and has to stop what he or she is doing to search for materials or 
information. Flow is suddenly interrupted—not just for this one transac-
tion, but also for all work queued up behind it.
While it is certainly not easy to make a process flow, there are several 
basic issues to consider. First, think about how you would identify all the 
common variations (options, configurations) in the product or service that 
the customer would value. How might you standardize and categorize them 

104  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
so anticipated variation is handled smoothly? What sort of materials, infor-
mation, training, and support should be provided so associates can handle 
these variations without interrupting flow? How would the physical and vir-
tual workspace be organized to require minimal movement, transportation, 
and delay, while creating a visual line of sight across the entire process?
There are many benefits to flow, among them:
•	 Work flows smoothly, without interruption, congestion, or bottle-
necks, enabling just-in-time response to customer requests.
•	 The pace of activity is based on demand signals, so no excess inven-
tory is created, and no excess work is performed.
•	 Associates are able to spot and solve problems quickly, improving 
quality and process performance.
•	 Production time is stable, so customer service–level agreements 
(time and quality) can be consistently promised and met.
And, most importantly for the topic of Lean IT,  flow simplifies the 
information requirements of a process. Since the pace of work is stable, 
sophisticated scheduling and control software is often not necessary. 
And because process problems quickly call attention to themselves, they 
are self-regulating, so invasive monitoring, data capture, and analyses 
also become unnecessary. That is not to say that it is not important to 
identify key metrics or key performance indicators (KPIs). And there is 
still value in collecting and analyzing some data, seeking to understand 
process variation and its relative impact on flow, in order to support 
continuous improvement.
Kanban Is an Information System for Pull
Kanban is a signaling device that pulls the flow of work through a process 
at a manageable pace. Kanban has several purposes:
	
1.	Triggers work only when ordered by the customer: When a kanban 
signal is received by a work center, it causes work to begin. Working 
only to demand signals (just-in-time) directs resource allocation and 
prevents overproduction and excess inventory.

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean Manufacturing: Flow and Pull  •  105
	
2.	Indicates the specific work to be done: Kanban signals contain a 
description of the work to be done next, which clarifies the sequence 
of work priorities for supervisors and associates.
	
3.	Controls the amount of work in process: By regulating the quantity of 
kanbans within a process, inventory is limited.
	
4.	Buffers interruptions: By keeping a small, carefully calculated buffer 
of safety stock between operational steps (also called a supermarket), 
the downstream operation is not starved by a temporary interrup-
tion from an upstream operation.
	
5.	Orchestrates the pace of work: Since each operation is only working 
according to pull signals, the work flows at a natural cadence. A sud-
den interruption is easily spotted, and workers quickly converge and 
troubleshoot the problem in order to restart the process flow.
While kanban is simple to describe, the variations are limited only by 
the creativity of the team designing the system. In a manufacturing set-
ting we have seen kanbans implemented using cards, bins, pallets, colored 
golf balls, flashing lights, and other clever devices.
It’s important to keep kanbans physical and visual whenever possible, but 
sometimes electronic kanban communications are appropriate. Electronic 
kanban signals include on-demand printed kanban cards with bar cod-
ing, overhead or kiosk electronic displays at each work center, roaming 
wireless devices, e-mail messages, and other computerized methods. The 
rapid communication of supplier replenishment over long distances can 
significantly reduce supply chain inventories and delays. Electronic data 
interchange (EDI) messages (demand signals) are often sent to suppliers 
(external vendors, as well as internal suppliers within an extended enter-
prise) to trigger replenishment, reducing labor costs, while preventing 
delays and data entry errors. Rather than an MRP system sending peri-
odic release messages on a push-scheduled basis, however, electronic kan-
ban pull signals should be triggered in real time by workflow events.
Electronic supplier kanban can be surprisingly simple. Years before web-
cams became popular and inexpensive, Boeing deployed a clever supplier 
replenishment visual kanban system. First, they organized the raw mate-
rial storage location, using shelving and tape. It was very easy to view this 
area and quickly determine when replenishment was needed. After estab-
lishing min/max levels with their supplier, Boeing trained a web camera 
on this space. Boeing provided the supplier with a secure link so it could 

106  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
remotely observe inventory levels several times each day. The supplier was 
authorized to initiate the replenishment order as needed.
Though kanban was first developed in a manufacturing setting, it 
translates easily into the office environment. Imagine an office setting 
where each step of a process is performed in someone’s cubicle. Outside 
each cubicle hangs a rack, and each slot on the rack can accept a lim-
ited number of folders containing work (loan applications, lab orders, 
patient charts, insurance claims for review, etc.). Each slot represents a 
standard unit of work, pacing production flow while limiting the buildup 
of excess work-in-process inventory. Each participant in the process now 
has line of sight to the entire process and visual signals to indicate how 
well the process is flowing. An empty slot sends signals upstream to pro-
duce more work. And if there are too many, or too few, empty slots at a 
particular position, it visibly signals that somewhere a flow interruption 
has occurred —a silent call for assistance. This arrangement is illustrated 
in Figure 5.2.
We have witnessed kanban effectively drive out waste in virtually every 
industry, and it can apply to any form of work, material, or informa-
tion flow. For example, Naida Grunden, author of ἀe Pittsburgh Way to 
Efficient Healthcare,6 describes the use of kanban in the pathology lab of 
a Pittsburgh-area hospital, where color-coded cards hanging on key rings 
signal for a replenishment order. When an item is low, anyone can take a

laminated card and hang it on a plastic hook on the bulletin board right 
next to the phone, where the order entry person will see it. Once this sys-
tem was implemented, staff labor dedicated to order placement plummeted 
from eight hours per week to 10 minutes per day. Inventory was reduced 
by about half, stockouts all but ceased, and the investment in an expensive 
new information system was avoided.
Just like a factory, when an office value stream extends across a distance 
(such as several buildings in a campus setting, or around the globe), there 
is limited physical visibility to kanban status without electronic commu-
nications. Thus electronic workflow and backlog/inbox management rules 
may be designed to follow simple kanban logic, with automated escalation 
alerts calling attention to exception and error conditions.
Creating a Level Schedule
Once a process is made to flow, it’s important not to overload it. While kan-
bans regulate the internal load balancing of a process, a scheduling mecha-
nism is still needed to prevent too much work from accumulating at the front, 
and to regulate a steady release sequence of work. An excessive or improperly 
sequenced backlog causes an unreliable schedule, which leads to frequent 
expediting and rule breaking, ultimately causing flow to fail—chaos.
Heijunka (Japanese for level scheduling), working with kanban, estab-
lishes a simple-to-understand visual schedule that releases work at a 
steady cadence, while responding quickly to change. Kanban signals can 
be physical cards in a physical heijunka box or electronic signals on an 
electronic heijunka box.
Figure 5.3 continues our office kanban example, showing the function 
of a level schedule. In this example, the pace is established at five work 
units every two hours. When people submit new work (demand), they can 
look at the daily backlog and instantly determine how loaded the process 
is, and when they should expect their work to be completed. This visibility 
prevents countless interruptions for schedule status information, which 
would otherwise interrupt flow and hinder productivity.
If the new work has a higher priority than what is already in the queue 
(a high-priority customer request), with proper authority (preestablished 
decision rules are important here) the work unit can be moved nearer to

the front of the queue. The remaining work shifts to a later slot, but since 
this work has not yet been released, its reprioritization does not disrupt 
the flow of work already in process. Once work is released it flows quickly 
(just-in-time) to completion and on to the customer, so expediting is 
unnecessary.
With a little creativity, level scheduling and kanban methods can be 
applied to any product or service process in any industry. In Chapter 8, we 
explore how these methods have been applied to Lean software develop-
ment (also known as agile).
By simplifying process, product, and service design, and through the 
creative use of kanban and level-scheduling methods, the information-
processing requirements of many processes can be simplified. This stabi-
lizes the environment, helping to maintain service-level agreements with 
customers, while avoiding the investment and complication of sophisti-
cated software and the cost and chaos it often creates.
IT Demand Management: The 
Foundation for Flow
Plans are useless, but planning is indispensible.
—General Dwight D. Eisenhower
No matter how well a process flows, it is essential to manage the demand 
feeding it, creating a prioritized queue of work that is clearly aligned with 
customer demand and business objectives. Otherwise, it is possible that all 
you have accomplished (with pull and a level schedule) is to cause nonpri-
oritized (and potentially non-value-adding) work to flow more efficiently 
to your customers. More likely, however, introducing non-value-added 
work into the backlog will result in sudden interruptions and unplanned 
changes once the customer sees the results.
IT demand management is essential to ensure the right work is intro-
duced to development and then production at the right time. From the IT 
perspective many organizations live with a crushing backlog, often two 
years or greater in length. When a backlog grows this large, it becomes 
virtually impossible to effectively manage. As business decision makers 

110  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
lose visibility to the workload, they are unable to make informed trade-off 
decisions regarding the best use of already constrained resources.
Also, when a clear decision-making process does not exist or is inef-
fective, customers tend to treat every new task as a rush job, so priorities 
are ephemeral, shifting by the moment. This leads to frequent juggling 
and thrashing of IT projects, and interrupting and task-switching of well-
intended IT staff, causing widespread inefficiency, poor quality, frustra-
tion, and decreased morale.
When people become overloaded, they tend to shift into a reactive, fire-
fighting mode: attacking symptoms and providing quick fixes rather than 
identifying root causes and implementing lasting solutions. This behavior 
only digs the IT organization into deeper turmoil, since every impulsive 
response adds to the growing technical debt of patches, workarounds, and 
legacy systems that must some day come due.
From the business perspective, IT is often branded as unreliable—
consuming endless streams of capital, while delivering projects that are 
chronically late and over budget, and that ultimately underdeliver.* In 
their struggle to establish priorities, many organizations devolve into a 
pattern of battlefield decision making, a process depending less on facts 
and business priorities and more on assumptions, influence, and persua-
sion. This in turn creates unhealthy zero-sum gaming behavior among 
managers and business units competing for limited IT resources. Often 
prioritization is unduly influenced by the requestor’s rank or favors owed, 
rather than logical coordination of strategically aligned activities.
As such undisciplined behaviors become the norm, the IT organization 
is relegated to the role of order takers—a drive-through IT services win-
dow (although the typical fast-food drive-through yields higher customer 
satisfaction scores). In the end, the IT organization just does what they’re 
told, and the business forgoes the process perspective, insight, and leader-
ship that IT professionals have to offer.
In other cases, when priorities aren’t clear, or are even contradictory, 
IT is forced by looming deadlines to make important prioritization and 
trade-off decisions by default, without clear business guidelines, and 
everyone suffers the consequences.
*	 In this section we focus on the demand management. Later in this book we’ll explore related 
issues, including requirements definition, project portfolio management, strategic alignment, and 
governance. In Part 4, we’ll bring all these pieces together into a holistic approach for a Lean man-
agement system. 

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean Manufacturing: Flow and Pull  •  111
The result of this dysfunctional behavior is the haphazard alignment of 
IT activities with business goals, and the squandering of IT resources and 
investments. This all but guarantees dissatisfied customers, in both IT and 
business, who see the chaos and learn to game the system to get what they 
think they require, and hope the situation will somehow remedy itself. This 
often leads customers to ask for more than they need, sooner than they 
need it, in an attempt to compensate for unreliable and inconsistent deliv-
ery performance. Backlog sandbagging creates even more overload and lost 
accountability, making matters even worse—and the cycle begins anew.
Such haggling and arm-twisting cause demoralization and loss of trust 
within the ranks of IT and across the organization, reminiscent of the 
old adage to just keep whipping the horse harder to make him run faster. 
Ultimately the best people leave for greener pastures (or, worse, for medi-
cal reasons), perpetuating chronic IT underperformance.
Perhaps we’ve exaggerated a bit, painting an overly grim picture? But 
then again, perhaps we haven’t. According to the CIO Magazine article “A 
New Model for IT Demand Management,”
Demand management is clearly the missing link in most IT departments. 
Far from being the rational and structured process we would like it to be, 
[IT] demand management is usually a nebulous combination of decibel 
management [whoever yells the loudest gets the attention] and organiza-
tional politics, significantly amplified in international organizations when 
country politics and cultural differences are thrown into the mix.7
While some IT organizations have developed good demand management 
practices, in our experience they are the exception, not the rule.
Only Three Choices When Demand Exceeds Capacity
Quite simply, the business faces three choices when its demand for IT ser-
vices exceeds its capacity to deliver them:
	
1.	Do nothing: The most common practice, no intentional action to 
address the situation, is a de facto choice to live with the frustra-
tion and ineffectiveness, which continues to worsen over time. The 
result is that projects are often prioritized by management edict or 

112  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
IT default: while this may be expedient, ultimately command-and-
control prioritization of IT activities does not yield optimal results.
	
2.	Add capacity: This is costly, and not a viable long-term solution, often 
creating a deepening cycle of waste and confusion that temporarily 
masks the real problem.
	
3.	Manage demand and balance capacity with a disciplined decision-
making process: Clearly this is the only viable choice if an organiza-
tion hopes to achieve IT operational excellence.
Most IT planning efforts focus on the supply side, emphasizing project 
management, scheduling, problem escalation, and equipment and human 
resources management. But without a deliberate focus on the demand 
side (balancing prioritized demand with capacity), IT risks doing many 
things efficiently, but not necessarily those things which deliver value to 
the customer. IT proactively positions itself to take responsibility for a 
backlog greater than its capacity, including projects that may not be stra-
tegically aligned.
The IT Demand Management Cycle
Senior managers are responsible for establishing management systems 
that balance macro-level demand and supply, reducing systemic vari-
ability (muri)* and overburden (mura). In the world of manufacturing, a 
methodology called Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP)† has evolved 
to address this requirement in production operations. A similar approach 
can be used to balance IT demand with available capacity. Illustrated in 
Figure 5.4, demand management is a periodic, closed-loop feedback sys-
tem that over time learns, adjusts, and becomes self-regulating.
Demand Planning
Using the traditional S&OP monthly cycle as a foundation, we will walk 
through a suggested IT demand management process. We recommend 
starting with a regular monthly cycle, standardizing and synchronizing 
the pace of organizational decision making. 
*	 Muri and mura are described in Chapter 2.

114  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
During the first week of the month, the demand planning team gath-
ers updated information on new demand, as well as changes to existing 
demand: backlog and work in process, including newly discovered in-
process demand (e.g., scope additions, new challenges encountered, and 
unplanned work). New demand includes new projects and services, and 
changes to existing service-level agreements. It also includes unplanned 
ongoing operational commitments for new systems (maintenance, sup-
port, upgrades, etc.) that were not accounted for in the original imple-
mentation project budgets—an unfortunate but common occurrence. 
Unexpected changes to existing demand are investigated to spot trends 
and emerging problems, identifying root causes of those problems, which 
are used to improve the accuracy of the ongoing estimating and planning 
process (PDCA).
Unlike supply chain organizations that have abundant transactional data 
(customer orders, sales history, seasonality, and other trends) to support 
their demand planning, IT relies largely on anticipated demand requested 
by the business.* These requests are often informal and unstructured, and 
thus unreliable. Demand planning is a collaborative process where ser-
vice provider value stream and process owners meet with the internal and 
external customer stakeholders that identify and prioritize demand for IT 
activities. During this time, the business case is developed, demand iden-
tified, and the demand-planning process continuously improved.
Flow Simplifies Demand Planning
Lean flow naturally simplifies demand planning. When delivery cycles 
become faster (approaching just-in-time), the planning horizon becomes 
shorter. At a certain point, operations are based on what the customer 
needs (pull signals) rather than what we (and they) think they might need 
sometime in the future. This in turn extends an invitation for frequent 
communication with the customer.
This interaction also creates an opportunity to modify the custom-
ers’ “buying habits” to create a more level, stable demand. For exam-
ple, customers of Lean manufacturers are often motivated to submit 
*	 With larger organizations, and those with complex demand and capacity scenarios, process and 
software tools beyond spreadsheets (such as Project Portfolio Management software) may be nec-
essary to facilitate the demand management process. However, this section will focus on the pro-
cess, not the tools.

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean Manufacturing: Flow and Pull  •  115
more frequent orders for smaller quantities, creating a level pace of 
demand to the supplier, while reducing supply chain inventory. The 
same approach applies to IT demand planning, whether in the itera-
tive, synchronized steps of a software development project, or the 
rapid execution of small, operational steps. When customers develop 
confidence that they can request something important and receive it 
soon afterward, they begin requesting changes in smaller increments 
over a shorter time horizon, which makes their requirements more 
precise. This creates a smooth flow of smaller work requests, which 
can be managed by a level schedule.
Capacity Planning
During the second week of the month, IT department and project manag-
ers, and IT value stream owners, review the various IT project and value 
stream loads to determine available capacity. When determining available 
resource capacity, the question often arises about how to plan for ordinary 
time commitments such as meetings, e-mail management, breaks, and 
ongoing kaizen participation. The simplest approach is to allocate a per-
centage of total work time for such activities. Critical capacity constraints 
should also be clearly identified and addressed.*
The distinction between value streams and IT projects is important:
	
1.	Value streams are relatively permanent groups of resources, often 
physically or virtually co-located, that perform similar ongoing 
activities. For example, a value stream may support the processes 
of a particular line of business, a domain of IT operations such as 
security or communications, a specific software application, or 
an enterprise application integration infrastructure. With dedi-
cated value stream resources, the scheduling challenges of shared 
resources are avoided. Teams are cross-trained and internally load 
balance, enabling a stable pace of workflow. While the assignment of 
resources to individual value streams usually results in an incremen-
tal increase in total enterprise resources, long ago Lean manufactur-
ers discovered that this trade-off was worthwhile, since flow reduced 
total operating costs, improved stability, quality, and productivity; 
*	  See the Theory of Constraints.

116  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
and enabled agility. Since value streams are designed for flow, the 
determination of capacity is relatively simple: the capacity of a value 
stream is the processes’ maximum rate of flow, and (like demand) 
can be measured in estimated hours, work units, or points (for dis-
cussion of points, see Chapter 8).*
	
2.	IT projects are teams temporarily assembled for a specific event or 
deliverable. Multiple simultaneous projects may share resources, 
causing contention and scheduling challenges among them; shared 
resources are a primary cause of flow interruption. The demand and 
capacity balancing of IT projects can be chaotic, because of their 
temporary nature, frequent scope changes, and resource sharing. 
Capacity is calculated as the number of available work hours by skill 
set, and tracking availability is challenging because scarce resources 
often move unpredictably among multiple projects.
Balancing
During the third week of the month, all stakeholders representing IT 
demand and capacity gather in a series of collaborative sessions to clarify 
priorities, manage constraints, and identify trade-offs.
Because of the challenges of shared resources, large groups of IT proj-
ect stakeholders must meet together, because changes in one project often 
cause a ripple effect of compromises and trade-offs in others. This assumes 
visibility across all projects—a key element of portfolio management (see 
Chapter 9). On the other hand, the demand and capacity balancing ses-
sions for dedicated IT value streams are more focused, and usually simpler 
and faster. In fact, IT value stream teams often adopt daily standup meet-
ings to maintain stable flow conditions, so current demand and capacity 
are always known and more visible.
During balancing sessions, priorities are established, and the backlog 
is updated. Note that there is a subtle but important difference between 
prioritization and sequencing. Prioritization indicates the urgency of 
the deliverable needed by the requestor. Sequencing of individual tasks 
or elements is usually a production consideration, where a lower prior-
ity task might be completed first, because there is a dependency from a 
*	 For an example of IT value stream organization, see the Con-way case study; and for an example 
of IT demand and capacity planning, see the Group Health case study. 

Lean IT Lessons Learned from Lean Manufacturing: Flow and Pull  •  117
higher priority element. Demand management is concerned primarily 
with prioritization of loading the backlog. Furthermore, backlogs must 
be kept to a reasonable duration. Many organizations impose a finite 
length, such as six months or one year. Requests that do not make the 
backlog should not be kept on an informal back burner list to be slipped 
into the backlog by sleight of hand. Resubmitted requests should pass 
the same rigorous qualification process as new requests.
Summary materials are then prepared for the executive review session. 
The strategic and financial impact of each issue is considered at this time. 
When decisions requiring management authorization are needed (such as 
significant investment for new resources, new equipment, or a new partner 
relationship), alternative scenarios and recommendations are prepared for 
the executive session. If consensus on a particular trade-off decision can-
not be reached, then justifications and supporting information should be 
prepared to inform an executive decision.
Executive Review
This brief (target two-hour) meeting should occur late in the third week 
of each month, allowing the organization time to prepare for the follow-
ing month’s activity. The meeting agenda should be standardized, concise, 
and tightly facilitated. The root cause of any significant deviation from 
the meeting agenda (often due to lack of preparation, unclear recommen-
dations, or excessive detail) should be investigated and prevented from 
recurring in future cycles (this is PDCA applied to effective meetings).
The executive review is much more than just a rubber-stamp session; it 
may be the only time when non-IT executives get to look deep inside the 
engine room to understand IT concerns and their impact on the enter-
prise. This monthly session aligns tactical operational IT activities with 
strategic objectives. Information should be presented at a high level, but 
assumptions and recommendations must be clearly documented, and 
stakeholders should be prepared to instantly drill down to the underlying 
details when requested. Meeting notes should be recorded, capturing firm 
decisions and open issues (parking lot) to be investigated.
The monthly demand management cycle is a good example of a manage-
ment system (explored in the next chapter), where management is account-
able for standard, repeatable performance, creating an environment of 
stability throughout the enterprise. In the dynamic world of IT demand 

118  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
and capacity, fluid balance is maintained and communicated, continu-
ously adjusting to new facts and circumstances.
As manufacturers learned years ago, once the monthly planning cycle 
is functioning smoothly, the organization will evolve the discipline and 
preparedness to call an ad hoc planning session if a serious situation sud-
denly arises. And because the demand management process is being rigor-
ously practiced and continuously improved with each passing month, the 
required effort decreases while the quality of the information improves, 
supporting informed decision making and reinforcing the alignment and 
agility of IT performance.
Lean IT Lessons Learned from the Shop Floor
Many simple but profound lessons have been learned from Lean manufac-
turing and applied effectively to other industries. The same guiding princi-
ples, tools, and systems have also proven effective to the IT organization.
Perhaps the highest accomplishment in Lean is to achieve value stream 
flow. So here are our simple (but not necessarily easy) guidelines for creat-
ing Lean IT flow:
•	 Position and evolve each value stream toward your competitive sweet 
spot; maintain a fluid balance between flexibility and efficiency in 
every process and practice. Stay light on your feet; keep your focus 
moving in the direction of competitive advantage as the market and 
your competitors evolve.
•	 Strive for simplicity and stability in every process before investing in 
electronic information systems: apply people, process, and technol-
ogy—in that order.
•	 Listen to your customers often, and proactively manage demand to 
support just-in-time operations
•	 Flow every process where you can. Keep a simple line of sight (physi-
cal or virtual) along the entire length of every value stream and 
supporting process, so they become self-regulating, leveraging the 
creativity and problem-solving capability of every participant.

Lean Management Systems
Chapter Objectives
In this chapter we will explore the following elements of a Lean manage-
ment system that are typically supported by IT shared services and discuss 
how a Lean IT approach can make them more effective:
•	 Communication
•	 Knowledge management and collaboration
•	 Performance measurement and business intelligence
•	 Strategy deployment
•	 Lean accounting
So much of what we call management consists of making it difficult for 
people to work.
—Peter Drucker
Most Lean transformation efforts are unable to sustain themselves 
over time as organizations lose momentum and regress to familiar, 
wasteful behaviors. This failure is often attributed to abstract notions 
such as “lack of leadership support” or the “inability to create a Lean 
culture.” While these explanations may sound plausible, what exactly do 
they mean, and more importantly, how can we avoid falling into these 
common traps?

122  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
While localized, short-term gains are often achieved with the initial, 
enthusiastic application of Lean tools, lasting change requires the trans-
formation of collective behavior—which happens neither quickly nor by 
accident. This points to the need for effective and deliberate management 
systems to spread, guide, and sustain change throughout all levels of the 
organization—aligning daily work with strategy.
In Creating a Lean Culture, organizational psychologist David 
Mann suggests that as an organization changes the way work is done, 
it must also fundamentally change the way it manages that work. He 
describes the behaviors necessary to create an effective Lean manage-
ment system:1
•	 Leader standard work: Explicit, interlocking managerial tasks ensure 
continual focus on the process, as well as the outcomes
•	 Visual controls: The performance of processes is visually apparent at 
all times, immediately calling attention to abnormalities
•	 Daily accountability: Brief, structured meetings focus on perfor-
mance, with follow-ups to close gaps between actual results and 
expected performance
•	 Discipline: Consistent behavior reinforces good work habits and pro-
cess stability, establishing a culture of quality and accountability
The success of a Lean management system relies on collaboration and 
the smooth flow of quality information. The ideal information system is a 
manual one, where the information is experiential: visible, accurate, and 
meaningful—clearly tied to immediate actions and consequences. In such 
an environment, participants intuitively understand the situation and are 
able to solve their own problems.
But in most modern organizations, value streams cross many bound-
aries—departments, workgroups, project teams, functional silos, build-
ings, time zones, and countries. The span of managerial responsibility 
is also great, so face-to-face interaction and hands-on information are 
usually not sufficient for an enterprise-wide Lean management system.
Microsoft’s Bill Gates chose the phrase digital nervous system to describe 
the role of a distributed business information system. Similar to the func-
tion of a biological nervous system, a digital nervous system provides a 
constant flow of feedback essential to the organization’s survival:

Lean Management Systems  •  123
You always are alert to the most important things, and you block out the 
information that’s not important. And companies really need to have that 
same kind of thing: the information that’s valuable getting to the people 
who need to know about it.2
Clearly, a well-designed framework of shared information system ser-
vices is necessary to enable an effective Lean management system. It is dif-
ficult to imagine getting a day’s work done without e-mail, shared drives, 
collaborative workspaces, and reporting and analysis tools. But each of 
these alluring “productivity-enhancing” tools can also potentially distract 
our focus, causing us to mistake activity for productivity.
Communication
Few will argue that e-mail and meetings are out of control in many 
organizations. Office workers often report a large part of each day is spent 
wading through e-mail or trapped in ineffective meetings, diverted from 
their value-adding work.
When does e-mail add value? The answer to this question in part depends 
on the nature of the work each individual performs. The further people are 
removed from the hands-on operational activity of the business, the less 
structured work and communications they perform. So we should expect 
a larger part of managers’ and executives’ daily activity to include com-
munications by e-mail, phone, and meetings.
Furthermore, organizations on the Lean journey usually experience more 
cross-functional interaction as they practice systems thinking, breaking 
down organizational silos and concentrating on value streams. This natu-
rally causes additional email traffic and increased meeting frequency.
While such less-structured communications are important, excessive 
or inappropriate e-mail traffic, endless conference calls, and back-to-back 
meetings leaving no time for reflection or follow-up can cause significant 
waste. These wastes include waiting (high-value-added work is delayed 
because the person is distracted by low-value activities), unused human 
potential (frequent e-mail and instant messaging interruptions sap cre-
ativity and energy), and overprocessing (reading the same e-mail thread 
multiple times before acting on the situation, or attending redundant, 
unproductive meetings).

124  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Worse yet, when individuals become habituated to these distractions 
and interruptions, they may lose a sense of cadence and flow with their 
standard work. They may also fail to recognize subtle process exceptions 
and problems, missing valuable opportunities for process improvement. 
So e-mail, instant messaging, social networking, and other forms of 
unstructured communications should be scrutinized with the same cri-
teria of waste, value, and standardization as any other business activity.
Much has been written about how to conduct effective meetings, yet 
poorly run meetings remain a chronic time-waster in many organizations. 
When standard work is effectively practiced, and meetings are properly 
facilitated, group interactions become more purposeful and structured; 
many unnecessary meetings are eliminated, while those that remain 
become more productive. Particularly effective are standup meetings, 
where a team gathers (physically or virtually) around visual status boards 
for a brief daily meeting or to focus on a sudden problem.
Concerned with reducing the time, cost, and environmental impact of 
unnecessary travel, many organizations are investing in remote-meeting 
capabilities. At the same time, organizations must also learn how to man-
age these meetings properly. How many of us have mentally checked out, 
distracted by e-mail or other interruptions, during a poorly facilitated or 
uninteresting electronic meeting or webcast? Remote meetings require 
discipline and engaged participation, supported by standard work or else 
they too can become monumental time wasters.
Knowledge Management and Collaboration
In a learning organization, the whole of knowledge gained through dia-
logue and problem solving is greater than the sum of the contributions 
from individual team members. Learning is therefore both a technical and 
a social process. In ἀe Fifth Discipline, Peter Senge describes knowledge 
as a natural result of human interactions:
Knowledge is social. Collaboration is the flip side of knowledge manage-
ment. So, to manage knowledge you need to address collaboration and 
tools that help people collaborate.3

Lean Management Systems  •  125
Knowledge management and collaboration systems offer many oppor-
tunities for individuals and teams to virtually gather and share knowl-
edge across an enterprise and beyond. But their flexibility also threatens to 
spread information chaos and waste. Unless an organization deliberately 
establishes a discipline of workplace organization and standard work, elec-
tronic document waste can threaten the value and security of an organiza-
tion’s intellectual assets.

A great deal of structured information exists in databases, used by applica-
tions to automate business processes; however, this represents only a small 
fraction of the overall knowledge of the organization. A much greater 
amount is stored as unstructured repositories of documents (spreadsheets, 
text, diagrams, photos, videos, etc.) scattered throughout an organiza-
tion’s hard drives. But the majority of knowledge (80 percent, according to 
a 2002 study)* is stored deep inside people’s heads.
Baby boomers will soon retire, threatening to take much of their knowl-
edge with them. This knowledge (undocumented procedures and insights) 
must be captured and standardized, or else the intellectual capital and 
competitive advantage of many organizations will be at risk. This loss of 
knowledge is especially serious when the work involves more practice than 
process (see Chapter 4).
Harnessing collective knowledge is an extension of the empowerment 
that personal computers first brought to knowledge workers, and there 
is a historical parallel here worth considering. In the late 1980s, personal 
computers became increasingly powerful and software more capable—
perhaps some readers remember the impact of Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect, 
and Novell networks? During the 1990s departmental networks and cli-
ent/server systems proliferated, displacing (and often duplicating) the 
functions of centralized mainframe and minicomputer systems. This 
unplanned and ungoverned information expansion and accessibility cre-
ated endless challenges for IT managers.
In much the same way, abundant departmental shared drives, web-based 
repositories, and social networking systems are a double-edged sword.

Research.

On the one hand, they enable individuals and teams to take ownership 
of information, gathering and sharing knowledge quickly and easily. But 
on the other hand, they often violate standards for security, data quality, 
version control, change management, and compliance. To IT managers 
who experienced the dawning of the personal computer age, this tension 
between flexibility and control may seem familiar.
In the years since the study illustrated in Figure 6.1, many organizations 
have implemented document and content management systems, attempt-
ing to store and access shared information quickly and securely. Yet these 
efforts are not always successful, often because of the lack of standard 
work and discipline; many document repositories have become sophisti-
cated junk drawers . . . with unlimited capacity.
Experts estimated that in 2008 an additional 487 exabytes of data were 
created in the “digital universe”—an exabyte is a million billion megabytes. 
They also predict that, with the growing popularity of various forms of 
digital content, in 2012 five times as much digital information will be cre-
ated.4 The content management challenge has suddenly become much 
more complex. With the rapid evolution of social networking capabili-
ties—blogs, wikis, online videos, and whatever is coming next—more of 
what was once inside our heads is quickly becoming universally accessible 
information. We see IT organizations investing heavily in these areas—
but their resources are often exhausted simply by chasing these rapidly 
evolving technologies, rather than proactively managing them.

On the one hand, organizations should leverage the creative power that 
these new technologies offer. But on the other hand, security, risk, and 
other basic governance concerns must be addressed. There is no simple 
answer to this challenge, but Lean offers an approach to restore order from 
the mounting chaos.
In our experience, the 5S method of workplace organization can be 
effectively applied to knowledge management. Given time, coaching, and 
specific guidelines (policies that must be adhered to), teams will develop 
creative approaches to managing knowledge—and then they will make 
them stick, because they own the solution. Most importantly, by focusing 
on the fourth and fifth S, standardize and sustain, teams themselves (not 
just by management edict but also through peer pressure, motivated by a 
sincere desire to improve) will enforce standard work to ensure everyone 
follows the mutually agreed upon rules.* And the teams will innovate and 
adapt to the continuously changing technology landscape.
Collaborative Workspaces
Collaborative workspaces offer a group of virtually co-located individ-
uals the ability to share knowledge and maintain visual awareness of 
project status. Like the traditional project “war room” (also known in 
Lean as the obeya room, see Chapter 9), a virtual collaborative work-
space helps distributed teams work in unison, tightly coupling learning 
with action.
Simple implementations of collaborative workspaces provide capabili-
ties such as document management, communications, reports, task lists, 
and portals linking to external sites and content. Sophisticated imple-
mentations may include group calendars and scheduling, project and 
resource management, automated status alerts, dashboards, and score-
cards. When the team includes members outside the organization, spe-
cial consideration should be given to security and intellectual property 
protection.
We often see a special form of collaborative workspace dedicated 
to Lean transformation. Lean is truly a team sport, and at the core of 
the team are the internal facilitators who support the Lean Center of 
Excellence (CoE)—those employees who coach and facilitate kaizen

The Evolution of a Lean Intranet Site
One client describes their journey:
“Lean learning is a lifetime journey, and nearly everyone takes a 
unique path, making for a rich web of knowledge exchange, materi-
als and information. Our organization employees over 30,000 people 
in over 30 countries, including 400 lean coaches who actively facili-
tate the transformation. Because of our global size and reach, we rec-
ognized the need early on to create a commonly shared intranet site 
to eliminate waste from the learning and knowledge management 
process.
“Our first release was based on a simple intranet site targeting sup-
port just for our lean ‘pioneers’, the early adopters who were experi-
menting and learning at a fast pace. Our transformation was moving 
so quickly that six months later we began the development of the 
next generation, a more complete site targeting a broader audience. 
The front page promotes the lean program with examples of kaizen 
activity and the benefits realized, while the rest of the site provides an 
events calendar, kaizen report-out summaries, and a document repos-
itory for sharing best practices.
“We are now planning the third generation site, a portal design that 
will allow us to incorporate higher levels of engagement, knowledge 
sharing and connectivity through social networking tools, blogging, 
and video streaming. Of course, the more features we implement the 
more improvements we discover are needed to support our customers.
“We began measuring site performance with a target around num-
ber of visitors each week. We are currently reaching an average of 
nearly 700 visitors per week, with 70 new visitors a week on average. 
On weeks when we run lean promotions we approach 1,500 visitors 
per week and we have an end of year target of 2,000. This measure 
has helped us to drive focus into our improvement efforts, identifying 
problems quickly to better understand what works and what does not. 
We are now exploring a metric connected to purpose, proficiency and 
how people use the site to create value for the company.
“So far we’ve seen many benefits from this site, as our lean pro-
gram has expanded worldwide:

Lean Management Systems  •  129
activity throughout the organization. In our experience, the most effec-
tive facilitators come from the trenches, since they have a deep under-
standing of the organization and its customers, business processes, 
problems, and culture.
Developing a CoE and a team of internal facilitators requires a signifi-
cant investment in training, coaching, and experiential learning over time. 
What better opportunity could there be to create an online community 
for sharing knowledge? In fact, many organizations invest in a collabora-
tive site for this purpose, with information, contact lists, schedules, lessons 
learned, training, articles, links, online videos, book reviews, templates, 
and more.
IT Service Desk (Help Desk)
Service desk is an often underappreciated job, the Rodney Dangerfield 
of the IT world—they don’t get much respect. However, an effective IT 
customer service function* can provide a leading indicator of emerg-
ing trouble throughout the company—the canary in the IT coal mine. 
In fact, the service desk can become a fertile source of improvement 
ideas. With effective teamwork and mentoring, the service desk can 
also be an effective onramp for new IT employees, where they can 
learn the inner workings of the organization, and its people, teams, 
and processes.
*	 See Chapter 7 for more on IT service desk operations, ITIL, and continuous improvement, and 
Appendix D for an example of an A3 for improving service desk performance.
•	 Our measures indicate a growing number of people in all areas 
looking for ways to engage and learn.
•	 Best practices are being shared across our businesses and 
regions at a faster pace.
•	 Learning materials are centralized and standardized, enabling 
our knowledge base to grow quickly and efficiently.
•	 Everyone shares their accomplishments, spreading knowledge 
and enthusiasm, creating a sense of pride and ownership.
•	 Shared learning is helping to redefine our cultural DNA: who 
we are as an organization and how we work.”

130  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
The service desk is a knowledge hub—continuously processing new 
technical information from vendors as products are released and updated, 
disseminating information to help individuals troubleshoot (and hope-
fully prevent) problems, while gathering new information during each 
call. Effective management of a support knowledge base, and the ability 
to provide self-service access to this knowledge, can improve service desk 
performance and end user satisfaction.
In one service desk 5S kaizen event we facilitated, over 30 percent of 
the documents in the support knowledge base were found to be obsolete, 
and many more lacked standard search keywords. In some cases, because 
documents were hard to find, duplicate documents had been created, often 
with conflicting information. Since knowledge wasn’t shared evenly, pock-
ets of specialized resources evolved, leading to silos of technical support 
and dependencies on particular individuals.
As a result of the kaizen, within just a few weeks the number of docu-
ments in the knowledge base was reduced by 20 percent. Standard work 
ensured that documents were properly stored, easily located, and regu-
larly updated. During this short time, successful search results increased 
by nearly 50 percent, dramatically improving first-call problem resolu-
tion. Mentoring and cross-training were also instituted, helping to spread 
knowledge and avoid overspecialization. Best of all, the improvements to 
the existing processes and system proved that a new and expensive service 
desk application was not needed.
Education and Training
eLearning utilizes the rich capabilities of the Internet to provide a standard-
ized education and training experience to a large number of individuals. 
eLearning can be as simple as individual online sessions delivered on demand, 
or as sophisticated as live facilitated online classes, with links to research and 
reading material, collaborative exercises, and interactive discussion forums. 
eLearning can also provide online testing and assessment, with the ability to 
track individual learning activity and performance—identifying individual 
strengths to be leveraged and weaknesses to be addressed.
Digital video cameras now appear regularly during gemba walks and 
kaizen report outs, recording events to be used for educational purposes. 
The ease and low cost of publishing online video provides a new vehi-
cle to record and share standard work instructions, simply by asking an 

Lean Management Systems  •  131
experienced worker to demonstrate and describe a procedure. In this way, 
short, interactive, task-specific training sessions are available to individu-
als online when performing a task that requires demonstration.
In general, eLearning can significantly reduce travel and other training 
costs, while capturing and sharing a significant amount of useful informa-
tion that can be reused and easily updated when necessary. However, we have 
also seen many online learning sessions where attendees become distracted by 
e-mail and other interruptions, so discipline and standard work are important. 
Even though content can be delivered electronically, there is often still value in 
bringing people together in a physical classroom setting for hands-on training 
and exercises. Interaction and shared storytelling can make the learning far 
more experiential and relevant, while developing a sense of teamwork.
Performance Measurement
A sound performance measurement strategy is a critical foundation for suc-
cessful and sustaining continuous improvement. Standardized work creates 
a stable process baseline for improvement, then measurements provide con-
stant feedback on how well those standards are performing, helping teams 
determine where best to focus the next round of improvement activity.
A well-designed measurement system is also essential for an effective 
Lean management system. According to David Mann, “Unlike managing 
in a results-focused system, process focus implies frequent measurement 
against expected intermediate outcomes. As necessary, interventions can 
be started before the end results are affected.”5
In order to respond quickly when corrective intervention is needed, feed-
back should be immediate and visual. Consider the difference between 
push and pull performance measurement. Push performance measurement 
involves periodic reports that may identify problems some time after they have 
occurred. Pull is immediate, event-driven, exception-based feedback, allow-
ing individuals to focus their attention on the problem at hand.* The faster 
*	 One example is the automated publish-subscribe method of asynchronous messaging, which pre-
vents broadcasting unwanted information. Users subscribe to a particular topic, and the system 
publishes information on that specific subject whenever an important event occurs, in various 
formats such as e-mail alerts and exception reports. This is pull, where the user asks the informa-
tion system to “send me what I need to know the moment it happens.”

132  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
an abnormality is detected, the sooner preventative action can be taken—or, 
if damage has already occurred, it can be quickly contained and mitigated. 
And the sooner a team investigates after a problem occurs, the better their 
chances of detecting the root cause and so preventing its recurrence.
According to Steven Spear in Chasing the Rabbit, organizations learn 
to solve problems and build knowledge by signaling, swarming, solving, 
and sharing what they have learned. First, a problem should signal for 
attention, then teams quickly swarm and solve it, sharing what they have 
learned with others. According to Spear,
Swarming a problem is not only beneficial in terms of what is prevented—
an infectious spread of the problem’s impact. It is beneficial in terms of 
what is allowed—the gathering of essential, contextual information that 
would otherwise be lost to fading memory and changing circumstances. 
High velocity organizations insist that the “scientific method” be used in 
a disciplined fashion. High velocity organizations multiply the power of 
their new knowledge by making it available, not only to those who discov-
ered it, but also throughout the organization.6
There are many ways to share information in an organization, and they do 
not necessarily require technology. For example, in a well-designed work envi-
ronment, problems should call attention to themselves visually. According 
to Gwendolyn Galsworth, author of Visual Workplace, Visual ἀinking,7 the 
walls, floors, fixtures, and other physical surroundings in an office or factory 
are often underutilized—“mute.” But they offer great potential to enable flow 
and pull, preventing errors, while visually signaling for assistance when an 
exception, error, or defect occurs.* Process line of sight allows all participants 
to immediately sense (see, hear, or feel) an interruption of flow.
When processes are transactional, spread over long distances and 
time frames, and events are electronic, computers can sift through large 
volumes of data, looking for abnormalities or trends indicating a poten-
tial arising abnormality. This can be achieved with common business 
intelligence tools such as database alerts and after-the-fact exception 
reporting, and through more sophisticated techniques such as real-
time performance monitoring, data mining, and predictive analytics.
*	 Exceptions are process abnormalities that do not necessarily cause errors but their root cause 
should be investigated for their impact on standard work; errors are mistakes that do not necessar-
ily cause defects; and defects are flaws in the work product that must be corrected before they are 
passed downstream to the customer.

Lean Management Systems  •  133
In this way, computers can generate highly effective, proactive leading 
indicators of emerging issues, signaling workers and managers where 
attention is needed so they can swarm the problem for preventative and 
corrective action. This creates a virtual line of sight, where participants 
have constant visibility to the entire process. For measurements to add 
value they must lead to effective action: teams must understand what 
they’re measuring, how they’re measuring it, and how frequently, how 
status will be communicated (visual is preferred), and how they will 
respond to deviations.
Lean Business Intelligence
The IT world offers many sophisticated and fascinating business intel-
ligence tools: dashboards, scorecards,* statistical analyses, data mining, 
predictive analytics, visualization, and more. And enterprise databases are 
overflowing with potentially useful information. From a Lean perspective, 
a simple business intelligence approach used effectively is far better than a 
sophisticated tool used improperly.
For example, accuracy and timeliness are more important than preci-
sion. In fact, data can be extremely precise (e.g., to six decimal places), 
supported by sophisticated analyses and visuals. Yet it can be inaccu-
rate, untimely, and irrelevant, giving a false sense of significance to the 
viewer.
In Performance Dashboards: Measuring, Monitoring and Managing Your 
Business,9 Wayne Eckerson describes three levels of performance mea-
surement dashboards (shown in Figure 6.2) that work together to support 
a healthy environment for continuous improvement.
Operational dashboards: Monitor operational activity, often in real 
time. This is virtual gemba, providing process line of sight.† 
*	 Dashboards and scorecards are both visual measurement and feedback systems. The two terms 
are often used interchangeably, although dashboards provide immediate performance feedback in 
near real time, whereas scorecards display trends and progress toward goals over time. Dashboard 
and scorecard views can be mixed in the same user interface, further blurring their distinction.
†	It’s important to remember that virtual gemba should ultimately lead to actual gemba, since no 
software can replace human interaction. For example, we recently heard a doctor say, “I hope 
somebody does a study of the quality of interaction when electronic medical records are intro-
duced. The nurses and doctors tend to have more eye contact and interaction with the computer 
screen than with the patient.”

134  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Automated alerts notify individuals to conditions that may indi-
cate an emerging problem or condition requiring immediate 
attention. Operational dashboards often use visual displays (dials, 
thermometers, flashing lights, etc.) to display status, and are 
typically in plain view using electronic signboards, kiosks, wire-
less devices, and even electronic andons (e.g., lights or sounds) 
to attract attention. High-level indicators are often able to drill 
down, displaying additional detailed data as needed to assist in 
problem solving.
Tactical dashboards and scorecards: Provide managerial views of opera-
tional processes, projects, and kaizen activity. They typically identify 
exceptions and provide analysis capabilities—both simple self-ser-
vice analytics, as well as sophisticated tools for specialized analyses 
(e.g., forecasting, modeling, and predictive statistics). For example, 
overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) measures are a good applica-
tion for tactical dashboards, since they summarize volumes of opera-
tional data helpful for total productive maintenance (TPM) activities.* 
Visual project and process status indicators can significantly reduce 
interruptions by supervisors and managers. And, as many managers 
are always on the move, these systems are often capable of sending 
alerts and visuals to smartphones and other handheld devices.
*	 OEE is a set of metrics used to measure availability, performance, and quality of a tool or process; 
TPM is a preventative maintenance program where the operator or team is responsible to monitor 
and care for their equipment.

*	 In this table, tactical scope indicates a departmental focus. From a lean perspective, this should be 
expanded to include a cross-functional value stream and supporting process perspective.

Lean Management Systems  •  135
Strategic scorecards: Provide consolidated views of underlying measures 
to track progress against strategic objectives, and key performance 
indicators (KPIs) to monitor important enterprise-level processes. 
Executive scorecards often employ balanced scorecard and strategy 
deployment methodologies (more on Strategy Deployment later in 
this chapter).
The three integrated levels of performance measurement (operational, 
tactical, and strategic) create a tiered, interlocking structure necessary 
for linkage and alignment of a Lean management system. A well-crafted 
performance measurement system provides custom alerts and self-service 
access, so an executive, manager, supervisor, or associate can monitor 
areas of interest and drilldown to more detail as needed. But these sophis-
ticated systems should not replace going to gemba—where the work is per-
formed, managing by walking around—“go look, go see, ask why.”
IT organizational involvement in deploying a performance measure-
ment system becomes especially important in multisite situations, and 
particularly when each site uses different operational information systems. 
In such a case, IT participants must be intimately involved in understand-
ing the processes and data structures of each site and the systems they use, 
so a centralized, integrated, coherent set of consolidated information can 
be presented.
Companies that invest in sophisticated business intelligence (BI) sys-
tems at first often deploy more metrics than necessary, over time reducing 
the number until they arrive at a limited set of KPIs that can be used to 
effectively guide decisions and identify exceptions. This excess is waste-
ful and distracting, and can limit the acceptance and eventual utility of 
the BI system investment. Organizations beginning the journey to inte-
grated business intelligence should move slowly and carefully, identify-
ing information requirements as they go and designing new reports based 
on their immediate usefulness for process monitoring and improvement, 
rather than on a desire to utilize the tools in order to justify the technology 
investment.
Rapid Acquisition and Integration
Our discussion on performance management naturally leads to the brief 
mention of a related topic, the merging of several companies into a single 

136  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Lean enterprise. Naturally, the acquiring and acquired companies seek 
to quickly and efficiently assimilate and share their collective knowledge 
and best practices. Ideally, when this synthesis is achieved, the value of the 
combined entity is greater than its individual parts while the individual 
distinction and competitive advantage of each entity are preserved.
The lessons of Lean are useful here. Standardized work may be applied 
to the technical integration process itself, with templates, checklists, and 
the use of data integration and business intelligence tools that can unite 
diverse enterprise software systems into consolidated financial and opera-
tional views. Standardized work may also be applied to the normaliza-
tion of business processes, management systems, and information systems 
(processes, data structures, reporting and analysis, and knowledge man-
agement) across consolidated entities.
A good example of this approach is Danaher Corporation, whose leg-
endary success with rapid acquisition and integration is in part due to 
a disciplined focus on IT standardized work. Using business intelligence 
and data integration tools, and providing templates, checklists, and a pre-
defined framework for rollup and reporting of operational and financial 
data with their global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, within 
30 days of a new acquisition Danaher often achieves a consolidated view 
of customers, operations, and financials. Their standard approach also 
encourages the rapid assimilation of the Danaher Business System best 
practices within the acquired company, while allowing a degree of contin-
ued local autonomy.
It has been said that the greatest synergy of a business combination is 
either realized or lost within the first six months. If this is so, then a rapid 
and standardized (Lean) approach to IT and business process integration 
drives significant value and competitive advantage for the entire enterprise.
Strategy Deployment
A Lean enterprise continuously strives to align itself, engaging in systems 
thinking, reaching beyond localized improvements to achieve a holistic 
and sustaining transformation. Peter Senge stresses that “empowering the 
individual when there is a relatively low level of alignment worsens the 
chaos and makes managing the team even more difficult.”10 Once aligned, 

Lean Management Systems  •  137
the energy of chaos is converted into synergy, and the organization is able 
to direct its activities toward shared goals.
There are two dimensions of alignment: vertical and horizontal.
Vertical alignment: Ensures all stakeholders from the board room to 
operations, through the layers of management interaction, goal set-
ting, and review, can trace their activities and objectives back to the 
strategic goals of the company.
Horizontal alignment: Ensures that cross-functional stakeholders of 
each value stream, supporting process, project, and kaizen, share 
common objectives, making appropriate prioritization and resource 
allocation decisions that add value to the customer.
In a Lean enterprise, alignment is shaped and guided through the prac-
tice of strategy deployment (also known as hoshin kanri). Strategy deploy-
ment emerged in Japan in the 1950s and has continued evolving to this day. 
In Value Stream Management: Strategy and Excellence in the Supply Chain, 
coauthor Dan Jones (who also coauthored ἀe Machine ἀat Changed 
the World and Lean ἀinking)11 and other researchers at Cardiff’s Lean 
Enterprise Research Centre identified strategy deployment as the first of 
four pillars behind high-performance supply chain organizations. The sec-
ond pillar, the formalization of cross-functional management, is the orga-
nizational structure through which strategy deployment is executed.
Strategy deployment is often overlooked as organizations plan their Lean 
transformation. This is in part, explain Jones et al., because “of all the Japanese 
management techniques, the [strategy] deployment system is the most 
‘invisible’ within the factory and less easy to distinguish or emulate than those 
‘visible’ elements of the Japanese production systems such as kanban.”12
Those techniques that are easier to identify and emulate are usually 
tactical, not strategic, in nature. Strategy deployment begins with a set 
of specific objectives to support the strategic direction of the organiza-
tion. Strategy deployment drives kaikaku, or breakthrough improvement 
(described in Chapter 2), throughout the enterprise and guides the many 
incremental kaizen priority decisions made each day.
An iterative communications process known as catchball (Figure 6.3) 
cascades through successive levels of the organization, guiding improve-
ment efforts and resource assignments to achieve vertically and horizon-
tally aligned targets which support the overall strategic objectives. These 

138  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
catchball discussions center on the A3, which helps focus thinking and 
clarify communications.
Regular meetings at each level establish a steady cadence of interaction 
and feedback, essential to leader standard work and daily accountability. 
Teams then assess cause-and-effect relationships and develop appropriate 
countermeasures and action plans to achieve established targets. In addi-
tion to the regular pace of standard meetings, ad hoc dialogue occurs spon-
taneously whenever a problem is identified that requires managerial input.
At the operational level of the strategy deployment hierarchy, a team or 
individual is able to clearly relate how their actions and initiatives support 
the strategic goals of the organization. Strategy deployment thus provides 
an internal governance mechanism, guiding priorities so resources are con-
sistently targeted across every level and dimension of the organization.
Strategy deployment decentralizes decision making, shifting problem 
solving from traditional functional heads to teams that are closer to the

work and to the customer. Strategy deployment in particular, and a Lean 
management system in general, empowers all departments, teams, and 
individuals to make fact-based decisions in support of strategic goals, and 
to understand their purpose and contribution to overall success.
By now, you may have noticed the similarity between the levels of the 
strategy deployment management system and the levels of performance 
measurement scorecards and dashboards: operational, tactical, and stra-
tegic. To be effective, each level of strategy deployment management must 
be supported by effective measurement. The strategy deployment man-
agement system and the tiered performance measurement system should 
evolve in parallel so they are intuitive and mutually reinforcing.
The Role of Information Systems in Strategy Deployment
Strategy deployment relies on a set of cascading A3 documents, along 
with supporting documents (text, photos, and other artifacts) data, and 
measurements. In time, computer assistance (while carefully avoiding 
unnecessary complexity or overautomation) may be necessary to provide 
a strategy deployment infrastructure. Specific reasons for this investment 
may include:
•	 Geography: If the planning process spans large distances, a web-
based system can facilitate access.
•	 Change control: The system can prevent changes to targets, history, 
baselines, and other control data while recording changes made to 
dynamic information over time.
•	 Security: Sensitive information can be controlled.
•	 Data types: Electronic A3 documents are often implemented with 
spreadsheet-style user interfaces, providing the user with familiar 
functions, including text, tables, calculations, and graphics.
•	 Standardization: User-friendly templates and instructional tools 
facilitate iterative and cascading communications, data-gathering, 
problem-solving, reporting, and decision-making processes.
•	 Scalability: Organizations often begin with spreadsheet-enabled 
A3s in a document repository offering version control and secu-
rity, moving to website and database-enabled applications later as 
the sophistication and scale of the strategy deployment process 
evolve.

140  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
We are not suggesting that a strategy deployment system must be 
deployed using sophisticated software. In fact, strategy deployment should 
first be implemented manually, in a pilot mode, to ensure the process and 
framework suit the requirements and culture of the organization.
However, the potential benefits of technology should not be overlooked, 
as an organization strives to establish the foundation of a Lean manage-
ment system that will help to align and sustain enterprise-wide continu-
ous improvement. To that end, we direct you to the Toyota case study later 
in this book, where you will learn why this Lean pioneer chose to automate 
their hoshin kanri management system, the lessons they learned along the 
way, and the benefits they have realized.
Measuring Value: Lean Accounting
It was not enough to chase out the cost accountants from the plants. The 
problem was to chase cost accounting from my people’s minds.
—Taiichi Ohno
Now that we’ve explored the role that information, information systems, 
and the IT organization play in a Lean management system, we conclude 
this chapter with a brief exploration of why financial decisions are often 
misinformed—and what we can do to change this.
To frame this discussion, let’s briefly explore an important, yet often 
misunderstood, discipline: Lean accounting.* Why is this subject so 
important? If you’ve eliminated waste, reduced inventory, cut cycle times, 
and increased throughput by applying Lean, but have not changed your 
accounting views or thought processes, you may be running your business 
with potentially misleading information and burdening operations with 
wasteful data collection.
Standard cost thinking does not compel Lean behavior; Lean account-
ing reflects operational and cash flow reality. If the fundamentals of Lean 
accounting are not clearly understood, the CEO, CFO, and shareholders 
can quickly kill a Lean transformation, just as it is beginning to take hold. 
*	 Our focus here is on accounting for Lean results, not applying Lean techniques to improve the 
efficiency of accounting operations (accounting for Lean, not Lean for accounting).

Lean Management Systems  •  141
In a manufacturing environment this is because Lean accounting causes a 
sudden shift of previously absorbed overhead expenses (contained within 
inventory stockpiles) from the balance sheet to the income statement.
Similarly, using standard cost-accounting assumptions in an IT environ-
ment, decision makers can also make misinformed decisions on many impor-
tant issues, including IT investments and the provisioning of IT services. This 
is because traditional indirect cost allocation and chargeback practices often 
obscure the true cost, value, and capacity of IT shared services.
Standard cost-accounting practices are not only misleading but poten-
tially counterproductive. According to Brian Maskell and Bruce Baggaley, 
authors of Practical Lean Accounting:
Traditional accounting, control and measurement systems  … motivate 
people to use non-Lean procedures. Traditional systems are wasteful. 
Standard costs can harm Lean companies because they are based on prem-
ises grounded in mass production methods. The methods are complex and 
confusing to generate, they provide a misleading understanding of cost, 
and they lead to wrong management decisions on important issues, such as 
make/buy, profitability of sales orders, rationalization of products or cus-
tomers, and so forth.13
Traditional standard cost accounting captures many transactions in 
order to allocate costs to specific products and services—these unnec-
essary transactions themselves are information waste (Figure 6.4). 
Furthermore, the allocation of indirect costs distorts financial informa-
tion. In Real Numbers, authors Cunningham, Fiume, and Adams explain 
the fallacy of traditional cost accounting: “Many companies have armies 
of cost accountants poring over variance reports after month end, try-
ing to determine their reason for variances. The problem is … it is virtu-
ally impossible to trace an unfavorable variance to its root cause. The role 
of cost control in a Lean environment is to reduce cost by eliminating 
waste.”14
Many individuals, teams, and departments invest their valuable time 
and energy chasing abstract concepts such as labor efficiency, cost allo-
cations, and variances, distracting attention from the focus of Lean: 
proactive waste reduction and value creation. Carefully monitoring and 
regularly measuring activities (inputs and their direct outcomes) helps 
everyone do things a little better each day.

At the heart of Lean accounting is value stream costing, where there is 
no allocation of overhead (indirect costs) to activities. Shared costs (such 
as indirect labor, rent, utilities, and IT shared services) are treated as direct 
costs of multiple value streams only when they can be easily identified and 
tracked (e.g., the direct, variable costs of an application used only for certain 
product or service lines). This results in simple financial information that 
can be clearly understood to support sound business decisions consistent 
with Lean.
Lean accounting reinforces a culture of accountability, emphasizing the 
overall performance of the value stream and not the optimization of any 
particular asset or activity within it. Simple measures and reports provide 
information that is easy to understand, relevant, and actionable, helping

Focus on Creating Value, Not Cost Reduction
Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be 
counted counts.
—Albert Einstein
Controlling cost has always been high on the CIO’s agenda, but after the 
high-tech bubble burst in 2001, the resulting crisis of confidence in IT 
caused many organizations to begin holding IT accountable to more rig-
orous cost-cutting measures. To many chief financial officers, running a 
“Lean” IT budget implies weight loss—reducing costs and resources as a 
primary objective.
Lean practitioners clearly understand that a primary focus on cost 
reduction, rather than value creation, is hazardous. Leading with a cost 
focus can cause an organization to continue doing the wrong things more 
efficiently. Worse yet, across-the-board mandated cuts may inflict irrepa-
rable injury to the long-term performance and health of the organization, 
losing valuable knowledge.
Shigeo Shingo said, “The four goals of improvement must be to make 
things easier, better, faster, and cheaper.”15 Note the sequence of this list; 
Lean focuses on adding value and eliminating waste through simplifi-
cation, quality improvement, and lead time reduction; cost reduction is 
a natural outcome. According to Gartner, “One of the biggest mistakes 
companies make with Lean is focusing too heavily on driving cost out 
of the business. If you approach Lean with that attitude, you’re bound to 
fail. Building a huge data center may give you great economies of scale, for 
example, but it may also reduce agility and flexibility.”16
Nevertheless, there is often a relentless emphasis on IT cost reduction, 
especially during economic downturns. While many organizations (and 
their shareholders) focus primarily on financial measures, this can lead 
to short-term thinking at the expense of long-term value. For example, 
when an employee wastes 10 hours each week performing non-value-

144  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
added work, and this activity is suddenly eliminated, that employee can 
then focus his or her skill, experience, and creativity on adding value else-
where. But since this does not lead to a reduction in salary expense, or 
any direct impact to the financial statements, this improvement often goes 
unrecognized, or is characterized as a soft savings. The same argument 
can be made for a kaizen that reduces floor space or the need for existing 
equipment, creating the potential that these assets can be redeployed to 
add more value elsewhere.
Few people will argue that these improvements don’t create value, but 
when it comes to prioritizing improvements, there is nevertheless a strong 
bias toward hard cost reduction—those improvements that go right to the 
bottom line. This creates a predisposition toward short-term improvements 
that have quantifiable cost reduction or avoidance, but many strategically 
significant improvements are long term and not easily measured (consider 
improvements to flow, quality, and customer satisfaction). To mitigate this 
bias, organizations may use hard- and soft-value categories when assessing 
the impact of kaizen activities, so whether or not there is a direct financial 
impact, they are acknowledging overall value contributed.
To ensure sound decisions are made for the health of the overall enter-
prise, IT professionals must help the business clearly discern and measure 
the true value of each IT service, and its contribution to customer value.
The Importance of the Lean Management System
In the end, a successful Lean transformation requires the aligned, cooper-
ative behavior of executives, management, and individuals. This is enabled 
by strategy deployment, and supported by communications, knowledge 
management, collaboration, and performance measurement systems 
that focus on value creation. Good decisions and effective, aligned action 
require simple, understandable, and actionable information.
A Lean management system communicates quality information 
throughout the organization, accompanied by the steady cadence of leader 
standard work. By decentralizing problem solving and decision making, 
and encouraging everyone to take responsibility for Lean performance, an 
organization cultivates a sustaining Lean culture.

Lean IT Operations: ITIL 
and Cloud Computing
Chapter Objectives
This chapter provides an introduction to Lean concepts applied to IT 
operations, and the delivery of IT services to your organization and cus-
tomers. We will:
•	 Discuss how Lean IT creates a foundation for sustained IT opera-
tional excellence. 
•	 Explore how the Information Technology Infrastructure Library 
(ITIL), a best practices framework for IT service management, com-
plements Lean IT.
•	 Speculate on the future of cloud computing and its implications for 
the IT organization, from a Lean IT perspective.
The IT organization is like a black box to many business executives and 
managers. Computers are everywhere, and our employees and custom-
ers depend on them virtually every minute of the day. When IT services 
are functioning properly, IT operations are transparent—we don’t notice 
them. However, there is often an underlying fear of the unknown, of cat-
astrophic failure, so organizations invest large sums of money and effort 
in business continuity plans and disaster recovery preparedness—though 
often not effectively addressing the root causes of potential failure.

150  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
More insidious, what we often don’t realize or measure is the impact 
of countless small failures on every desktop each day. Temperamental 
computers and software steal incalculable hours each week from other-
wise productive employees. An incomprehensible error message suddenly 
appears on a screen, a printer stops working, a software application hangs 
up, a document is lost … calls to the help desk eventually fix the immediate 
problem, but only after delays and frustration. So we continue on with our 
day, holding our collective breaths until the next time.
At best, minor interruptions sap the vitality of the organization. At worst, 
chronic instability may cause anxiety, workarounds, and underutilized IT 
investments. We once overheard a CEO refer to his IT organization as “a 
necessary evil.” Another CEO lamented that his company was “held hos-
tage” by intractable information systems. In fact, many executives harbor 
a deep concern about the dependability of their essential systems, feeling 
powerless to take effective action. Meanwhile, in many IT organizations, 
technical specialists dash about maintaining order and stability, keepers 
of secret knowledge and skills that are hard to understand, and even more 
difficult to standardize, measure, and manage.
Quality Is Free
Chronic information system instability, when it exists, is unacceptable. 
And often, even when systems are stable, there is the perception of 
instability and excessive cost, born from lack of comfort and under-
standing about how the IT operations function. In any case, IT opera-
tional excellence, and confidence in their performance, is necessary if 
we are to trust information and information systems to support our 
businesses.
In 1979 Philip Crosby published Quality Is Free, arguing that every dol-
lar invested in quality is returned in profitability.1 Although Crosby was 
addressing manufacturing at the time, the very same methods may be used 
to ensure quality, consistency, reliability, and peace of mind when deliver-
ing IT services. After all, IT operations are a business, and they should be 
run and measured like one. In the opening paragraph of Measuring ITIL, 
author Randy Steinberg poses a challenge:

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  151
Much has been written lately about how IT needs to be “run like a busi-
ness.” A stronger statement is that IT needs to “act like a business.” While 
technology is certainly important, IT needs to inject much better business 
management practices by operating services instead of technology silos, 
measuring the quality and effectiveness of those services and taking timely 
actions to make sure those services are delivered in line with business 
needs.2
For most organizations, the cost of basic IT operations represents the 
majority of the total IT budget—just to keep the lights on, the servers 
running, and the applications working. In 2009 PricewaterhouseCoopers 
reported that “operational expense is typically more than 80 percent of 
the IT budget. And everyone has a story about IT not fulfilling requests 
quickly enough. Business agility is definitely constrained by a lack of IT 
agility.”3
Clearly, IT operations and the delivery of shared services represent a sig-
nificant investment for the business, one that in many companies often fails 
to deliver expected results. To ensure value, the business drivers behind IT 
costs should be clearly understood by business and IT stakeholders, sup-
porting well-informed decisions on IT investment priorities. And once 
these investments are made, the IT organization must deliver services that 
balance complexity and manageability, so the business stakeholders can use 
systems properly and with confidence. At the same time, IT must deliver 
these services while adapting to constantly emerging and maturing tech-
nologies. Furthermore, this technological complexity and flux are expected 
to be hidden from the end users, who simply want the services to meet their 
current needs, while anticipating future growth and innovation.
To achieve these lofty objectives, the IT organization must manage itself 
in a way that reduces uncertainty and variability, providing uninterrupted 
quality services to its customers. At the same time, they must maintain an 
inward focus on morale and on attracting, retaining, and cultivating the 
best talent. After all, notwithstanding the sophisticated technology, IT is 
essentially an intellectual capital endeavor.
At the bottom line, the business wants to see year-on-year cost reduc-
tions and improvement of IT service effectiveness, achieved in a manner 
that supports continuous improvement of business processes, and in a way 
that encourages innovation and positively differentiates the business from 
its competition. Is all that too much to ask?

152  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Functional Silo or Value-
Adding Service Center?
Traditional IT organizations structure themselves around technical 
domains and skill sets. This approach aims to reduce cost through econ-
omies of scale, where specialized resources are concentrated, and the 
cost of centralized systems and services are shared across many custom-
ers. According to the assumptions of mass production, which have been 
ingrained since childhood, this approach is commonly accepted as effi-
cient and cost-effective.
Lean manufacturing pioneers discovered that the functional grouping 
of machines causes many challenges as intersecting value streams com-
pete for shared resources and specific skills, resulting in large or rapidly 
shifting backlogs, excessive work in process inventory, unclear and shift-
ing priorities, frequent interruptions, quality problems, cost overruns, and 
delays.
In the case of IT operations, the overspecialization and concentration of 
shared resources can cause:
•	 Flow interruptions as distinct subgroups focus on internal schedule 
optimization and resource utilization, causing uneven batch-and-
queue workflow.
•	 Risk of excessive dependence on overburdened individuals with spe-
cial skills, who have neither the time nor the motivation to share 
their knowledge with others.
•	 Communication breakdowns as essential information is not shared 
across value streams.
•	 Tendency for specialists to overemphasize technical issues rather than 
business processes, leading to unnecessarily complex and wasteful 
solutions that are often resistant to change.
And finally, a functional organization presents a disjointed view of 
IT services to the customer, particularly when a service is interrupted 
and multiple groups have to be contacted separately. This is where the 
finger-pointing cycle often begins: each group troubleshoots separately, 
focusing on its own localized issues rather than the overall problem from 
the customer’s perspective. Not only can this situation be frustrating, but 

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  153
also this fractured approach obscures the true cost and perceived value 
of the services. As a result, the IT organization is often shrouded in an 
aura of unpredictability and mistrust, creating a perception of an out-of-
control cost center rather than a value-adding service center.
Some IT leaders have therefore begun organizing their resources around 
a portfolio of the services required by their customers. These services are 
often grouped in categories, such as:
Application services:
•	 Application Delivery
•	 Communication and Collaboration (E-mail, Voice, Video, etc.)
•	 Document and Image Management
•	 Service Desk (help desk)/Application Support 
Component technology services:
•	 Application and Data Hosting
•	 Network and Telecommunications
•	 End User Devices (Desktops, Laptops, Handhelds, etc.)
Professional services:
•	 Business Technology Strategy Consulting
•	 Application Selection and Implementation
•	 Application Development
•	 System and Application Integration
•	 Portfolio/Program/Project Management
•	 Training 
Each category usually includes several distinct services and service-level 
agreements (SLAs) with a fabric of underlying processes to deliver them. 
Furthermore, each underlying process may support multiple service cat-
egories (such as application hosting processes which also impact systems 
integration services) creating a cross-functional, process-oriented web of 
interdependency, responsibility, and accountability.*
*	 More specifically, within a formal IT Service Management Framework, Service Level Agreements 
(SLA) are generally established with business customers who use the IT services (primarily soft-
ware application services) to support business processes; these are outward facing agreements. 
Operational Level Agreements (OLA) are inward facing agreements established among the vari-
ous technical and professional services (hosting, storage, security, telecom, consulting, etc.) to 
enable and support the outward facing services. This web of interdependent service elements 
(OLAs and SLAs) are published in the service catalog, which documents combinations of service 
elements as predefined service offerings based on predictive customer demand patterns. From a 
Lean IT perspective this represents a comprehensive framework of IT service value streams for 
designing, delivering, measuring, and continuously improving IT Services

154  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Rather than emphasizing specialized skills development, resource 
utilization, and task efficiency, the collective focus of process-oriented 
teams shifts from economies of scale to economies of flow. This perspec-
tive unites business and IT stakeholders toward increasing the value of 
IT services, emphasizing their contribution to the organization’s goals, 
rather than exclusively reducing the cost of delivery. For example, cross-
functional teams will be more inclined to eliminate non-value-adding 
IT activities altogether, rather than simply make them more efficient. 
This emphasis on value over cost is underscored in the Shingo Prize for 
Operational Excellence guidelines:
A process focus naturally leads to flow thinking. Flow—producing one item 
or performing one service component a step at a time and in a series of con-
tinuous steps flowing toward the customer (rather than batching products 
or service steps)—is the best driver to make processes easier, better, faster, 
and cheaper. A cost focus is particularly dangerous, when it creates perverse 
incentives and budget manipulations incidental to actual improvement.4
Gartner describes the same phenomenon from an IT perspective in Six 
Steps to Process-Based IT Organizational Design:
Traditional IT service delivery and organization models achieved effi-
ciency at the expense of effectiveness. When resources are orchestrated 
in silos, many such silos become involved in delivering an IT service. 
None, however, possesses the insight, visibility or accountability for 
anything other than its own small part of a delivery chain. To the extent 
that business operations are dependent on repeatable, reliable IT ser-
vice delivery, a process organization and culture are required. Although 
technical skills will always be required, the optimized process-based 
organization is horizontally focused on outcomes, not vertically ori-
ented around skills.5
Many natural impediments resist this process-based reorientation, and 
perhaps none is greater than basic human nature. Humans are territo-
rial creatures, especially when they have cultivated specialized skills that 
become part of their personal identity and sense of pride. If we are going 
to ask our IT associates to share their skills with others, to focus their 
attention on specific services (rather than the constant adrenaline rush of 
smoke jumping from one crisis to the next), and to even move their desks 

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  155
(gasp!) to a cellular organization more conducive to service-based collabo-
ration and flow, we’d better have a compelling reason.
That reason is found in the hazards of shared resources—people or 
equipment with unique capabilities that are spread across multiple value 
streams. Shared resources are difficult to schedule and are subjected to 
frequent interruptions, creating a migratory bottleneck that can suddenly 
disrupt the flow of any process.
Lean offers many approaches to mitigate a shared resource.* First of all, a 
constrained resource (bottleneck) should avoid doing work that an uncon-
strained resource can perform instead. Second, the organization should 
reduce its dependency by encouraging knowledge capture and cross-train-
ing. Ultimately the IT organization should focus on simplifying processes, 
tools, and components, reducing the need for specialized resources. For 
many years software designers have emphasized standardization, reus-
ability, and component-based, service-oriented architectures—these same 
principles should be extended to the design of IT services themselves, and 
to the organization of resources which support them.
Cellular organization is a useful Lean method, where the people and 
equipment supporting all or part of a value stream are grouped together to 
encourage workflow. Multiskilled workers can move about to lend a hand 
where and when it’s needed. Constant daily interaction, coaching, cross-
training, visual measurements, and knowledge sharing within the cell 
build capability and flexibility, while encouraging standardization and 
small improvements every day. IT workcells may be physically or virtually 
co-located, so demand, status of workflow, and issues requiring attention 
are quickly and visually communicated among team members. For more 
on how remotely co-located teams can be supported by Lean approaches 
and virtual collaboration tools, see also Chapter 6.
Fundamentally, once resources are aligned so that value streams can 
flow, it is far simpler to balance demand and capacity for each IT service 
(see Chapter 5 on IT demand management). Service-oriented teams are 
also intuitively better able to see and reduce waste across the entire value 
stream (systems thinking), delivering more value to the customer. Cost 
reduction is a natural by-product of this reorientation.
*	 For more on mitigating bottlenecks, see the ἀeory of Constraints; while it may not be practical for 
an IT organization to eliminate all technical specialization, and the one-off systems and technolo-
gies that give rise to them, identifying and mitigating these constraints is an important first step.

ITIL: A Lean Approach to IT Services Management
The Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is a widely 
used IT service management framework that is consistent with many Lean 
IT principles and tools. The creation of ITIL is commonly attributed to the 
United Kingdom Office of Government and Commerce in the mid-1980s 
(which has trademarked the name), and it has since been adopted in many 
businesses and governments worldwide.
The fundamental value proposition of ITIL is simple yet profound: without 
effective change management, the break-fix response to IT problems is ran-
dom, time consuming, and costly. Over 80 percent of system downtime is self-
inflicted, caused by people and process failures rather than technology failure. 
Furthermore, over 80 percent of the time and effort required to restore service 
is spent tracking down the changes that were made and determining how they 
caused the system failure so effective corrective action can be taken.6 From a 
Lean perspective, such reactive, unplanned activity is waste.
At the core of ITIL is continuous improvement, using the scientific 
method (PDCA) for identifying, correcting, and preventing problems. By 
establishing standardized work methods that regulate system changes, 
capture and correct failures when they occur, and rapidly diagnose their 
root causes to prevent future failures, performance can be clearly mea-
sured and the system reliability improved. As a result, the percentage of 
unplanned work (firefighting and reactive workarounds) performed by the 
IT staff is significantly reduced, and replaced with planned work which 
adds value to the business. Time, quality, and cost of IT operations mea-
surably improve; systems stabilize; and morale improves. Everyone wins.
Auditors are also pleased with ITIL since quality is built into each pro-
cess, resulting in documented procedures and a more stable environment 
with less business risk. This quality at the source approach reduces the cost 
of compliance, an important consideration with the increasing burdens of 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other governance and regulatory compliance 
obligations.
One of the most significant long-term benefits of ITIL is the creation of 
a common language for IT services. This enables the business and IT com-
munities to agree upon services provided by the IT organization, setting 

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  157
clear expectations for their performance and establishing meaningful mea-
surements against those expectations. One of the essential components of 
this common language is a service catalog, describing the value-added ser-
vices the IT organization provides to its customers. A service catalog should 
describe standard service offerings and how they are ordered, delivered, and 
charged for, with explicitly measurable service-level agreements that define 
performance and customer satisfaction—the voice of the customer.
An effective communication, measurement, and feedback framework 
encourages adaptation and innovation, where customers can describe, 
in meaningful terms, new services they desire and are willing to pay for. 
This framework should also allow for the request of nonstandard ser-
vices as required, such as research and development activities. Service 
catalog offerings form the basis for IT resource planning, staffing, skills 
development, and management, aligning service capacity with customer 
demand.
The ITIL framework is also useful in collaboration with suppliers and 
external customers, describing and defining service catalog offerings to 
provide dependable supply chain infrastructure and integration services, 
while creating a baseline for evaluating future supply chain technology 
investments.
Over time, as IT and the business learn the common language and 
deploy a standard framework of IT services, chronic system instability 
disappears, replaced with teamwork, dependability, and trust.
ITIL Is a Set of Integrated Processes
Over the past two decades, ITIL has evolved to support greater business 
alignment—the ITIL Version 3 library (introduced in 2007) has a greater 
emphasis on service delivery, service life cycle management, and con-
tinuous improvement. According to Manoj Garg of Virtual Information 
Executives, the evolution of ITIL demonstrates the transition from a tech-
nical focus toward the continuous improvement of processes:
ITIL version one was focused on managing systems and technical silos. 
Version two added a process dimension, but it did not offer guidelines for 
how to implement those processes. Version three not only helps the IT 

158  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
organization and the customer work together to define a meaningful bun-
dle of services and performance measures, but also uses PDCA to moni-
tor and continuously improve the fit and quality of those services. This 
approach is especially important because the customer understands and 
defines the services they are agreeing to purchase, and is actively involved 
in their definition, delivery and measurement.7
The ITIL Version 3 service life cycle model consists of five stages, shown 
in Figure 7.1:
	
1.	Service strategy: Developing a clear vision and plan for service port-
folio design, demand management, and IT financial management
	
2.	Service design: Developing appropriate and innovative IT services, 
including their architecture, processes, policy, and documents with 
the goal of satisfying current and future business requirements
	
3.	Service transition: Deploying new services, managing service 
changes, and the knowledge related to those services
	
4.	Service operation: Delivering services to clients at the agreed level of 
service, while managing the applications and underlying technology 
to support their delivery
	
5.	Continuous service improvement: Sustaining and improving value 
to the customer, collaborating on design improvements and service 
modifications

How ITIL Emphasiz es Quality at the Source
The diagram below depicts the ITIL Service Support and Service 
Delivery functions (version 2) and is useful to illustrate the inter-
relationships of several key functions:
•	 The customer has a problem and seeks assistance through 
access to a self-service knowledge base or by logging the issue 
with Incident Management (e.g., service desk or help desk)
•	 Service Level Management tracks service desk performance 
against customer expectations as established in Service Level 
Agreements (SLAs)
•	 Incident Management coordinates with Problem Management 
to establish if the issue is a known problem, and with Knowledge 
Management to determine if there is a known resolution
•	 Problem Management interacts with Change Management and 
Release Management, since most problems are typically caused 
by past changes and releases, and future changes are planned as 
releases to address known problems
•	 Configuration management tracks the current known state of 
all systems (configuration, software, settings, etc)

All ITIL functions and processes across the five life cycle stages are 
interdependent; thus, feedback from one stage drives improvement in 
another (see sidebar). This is system kaizen, where improvements in one 
area of a process are felt throughout the entire value stream, creating 
value for the customer.
How ITIL Supports Lean IT
Though ITIL appears to have evolved independently from Lean practice, 
by understanding the similarities ITIL can be integrated with the enter-
prise-wide Lean IT transformation.
A3 Problem Solving
Problem solving is at the heart of ITIL. Beyond the philosophy of scien-
tific problem solving and Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA), ITIL teams find 
A3 problem solving can provide an essential step-by-step guide to help 
them focus on solving a problem without wasted time or effort.
Voice of the Customer
Voice-of-customer (VOC) techniques help determine what the customer 
needs, and what elements of the service catalog are required to satisfy 
those needs, guiding the development of SLAs to define how they are 
delivered, measured, and valued. VOC is the why, service catalog is the 
Since roughly 80% of problems are typically caused by changes, 
proactive Change Management (interacting with Release and 
Configuration Management) is the key to improving quality and 
stability. By understanding the root cause and effect interrelation-
ships among configurations, changes, and releases, new incidents 
are quickly addressed, and underlying problems can ideally be 
prevented—this is the Lean principle of Quality at the Source in 
action.

Lean Thinking Applied to Security 
and License Management
Two areas where Lean thinking has proven effective are software 
license management and security management. These two domains 
share common characteristics: they are complex, are constantly 
changing, expose the enterprise to great cost and risk, and touch vir-
tually every desktop in the organization.
License management: Organizations usually pay too much, or not 
enough (often at the same time for various license agreements), in 
part because they have difficulty identifying currently installed and/
or used software applications. Not only does this complicate IT oper-
ations, since there is no reliable record of installed configurations, 
but it also exposes the organization to potentially significant legal 
liability. Tracking licenses has become more difficult in recent years, 
due to the variety of platforms supported (servers, laptops, host-
ing, software as a service, etc.) and the variety and endless details of 
licensing agreements offered by vendors. In our experience, the only 
way to get a handle on this growing challenge is through a cross-
functional effort involving IT operations, service desk (end user sup-
port), finance (asset tracking and compliance), and legal (contract 
negotiation and review), as well as representatives of all stakeholders 
that use software within the organization. This is fundamentally a 
workplace organization challenge, so the 5S methodology is useful—
sorting, organizing, and validating assets in place, then establishing 
standards to sustain recordkeeping. Sustaining measures ensure that 
assets are properly licensed and configuration changes are tracked in 
a timely manner, reducing audit costs and eliminating unnecessary 
license fees and compliance risks.
Security management: Many service desks report their largest call 
volume is the response to lost password and reset requests. Security 
threats are tenacious and widespread, affecting virtually every aspect 
of IT and business operations, causing tremendous waste, disruption, 
cost, and risk. And the more critical a business process is, the more 
extensive the gauntlet of security defenses usually surrounding it; 
thus, the most critical processes often suffer the most security waste. 
(For an interesting perspective, see Security Kaizen.)8 Because of its 

162  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
what, and SLA is the how. Conversations with customers should focus on 
the what—too often businesspeople want to define the how, and it can 
either be contentious or lead IT efforts down the wrong path. The Lean IT 
organization should encourage regular engagement and feedback with all 
customers to define and improve services and service-level agreements.
Quality at the Source
ITIL problem management establishes a discipline of root cause analy-
sis followed by corrective and preventative action. ITIL change manage-
ment prevents abnormal conditions from occurring. Lean tools that may 
assist include error proofing of processes and user interfaces, and visual 
measurement of process performance with leading indicators of defects 
or problems, all aimed toward helping to design quality into IT services.
Standard Work
IT associates are often rugged individualists, very smart people who like 
to do things their own way—and that is often the fastest and newest way. 
IT professionals and business end users alike are often guilty of want-
ing the latest software and equipment—but this causes an endless churn 
of new systems and configurations that must be supported, resulting in 
unnecessary variability (muri), leading to pockets of technical specializa-
tion and chronic instability.
Many of the greatest challenges of IT operations are caused by lack of 
standardized work, particularly the lack of standard hardware, periph-
erals, software, and system configurations. When standard hardware 
models and configurations are encouraged throughout the enterprise, 
this not only reduces purchase and support costs but also reduces spare 
pervasive nature, specific kaizen activities should focus on security 
issues across organizational boundaries, processes, and applications. 
And all IT-related kaizen activities should deliberately consider the 
security implications of every change, clearly identifying when secu-
rity measures add value, and when they do not. Rigorous A3 think-
ing thus provides an effective foundation to address the constantly 
changing landscape of security risk and waste.

parts inventory and service response time, improving the stability of 
the environment.
Resistance from IT staff is common; the thrill and adrenaline rush of 
crisis response are self-perpetuating and strangely rewarding to many. So 
while IT staff may initially view the emphasis on standard procedures as 
mundane and unsatisfying, in the long run a more stable environment 
supports true innovation and value creation. Culture changes only when 
basic behaviors change; this is a team effort, and everyone must learn to 
play well together.
Measurement
ITIL measurements have been well defined in recent years, with each mea-
sure focused on producing actionable results,* providing feedback to drive 
continuous improvement:
•	 Ratio of planned to unplanned IT work: Provides a good gen-
eral measure of the stability of the environment. Although this 
requires an investment to track unplanned work time, the data 
are then useful as inputs for problem categorization and root 
cause analysis.
•	 Mean time between failure (MTBF): The average time between ser-
vice interruptions. This is commonly used to measure hardware fail-
ure, but it can be equally effective with service failure.
•	 Mean time to repair (MTTR): The average time to restore service 
after an interruption.
•	 Availability: The availability of a resource, which includes planned 
and unplanned downtime.
•	 Percentage of successful changes: This refers to changes that do not 
result in downtime or unplanned work, requiring the correlation of 
incident report data and change management data.
•	 Server to system administrator ratio: Measures staffing levels required 
to manage systems, indicating the degree of standard work, avail-
ability, and manageability of systems.
*	 Many of these measures are familiar to practitioners of Total Quality Management (TQM), Total 
Preventative Maintenance (TPM), and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).

164  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
•	 Percentage of effort deployed early in the change–release cycle: A good 
leading indicator that the scientific method is being followed: more 
Plan means less Do-Check-Act.
Lean IT in the Cloud
Cloud computing is suddenly threatening to disrupt many traditional IT 
organizations and practices. Let’s explore, from a Lean IT perspective, 
what this relatively new practice could mean for the future of the IT orga-
nization and its value proposition for the business.
Many companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, are invest-
ing in enormous global data centers to provide Infrastructure as a Service 
(IaaS), moving many functions of IT operations into a utility model. These 
are true computing factories, providing IT services at massive economies of 
scale: low cost (an order of magnitude lower than most companies can pro-
vide for themselves), with virtualization, engineered redundancy and fault 
tolerance, and automation for high availability and hands-off management.
Going further, many companies (Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Salesforce, 
SAP, Oracle, and many others) are providing software as a service (SaaS) 
business application components and platforms using a service-oriented 
architecture (SOA) to provide standardized and interchangeable parts 
needed to assemble (and reassemble as needed) enterprise-class applica-
tions over the Internet with lower change and management costs. This shift 
resembles the gradual transition of manufacturing from custom engineer-
ing to mass customization (see the diagonal shift explored in Figure 5.1).
It may take years for most companies to significantly transition their 
applications strategy in this direction. And cloud computing won’t be 
appropriate for every situation; indeed, it could make some issues, such as 
security and compliance, more challenging than ever. Nevertheless, cost 
will inevitably drive many IT services into a utility model, whether inter-
nally or externally sourced. The coming of the cloud will not eliminate the 
IT organization, but we expect that it will dramatically change its role and 
approach toward value delivery to the business.
In the short term, we expect that IT organizations will invest in the stan-
dardization and continuous improvement of infrastructure and related ser-
vices, improving stability and reducing operation cost; this is where ITIL 

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  165
can play an important role. Over time, as some organizations move sig-
nificant elements of their infrastructure and application ecosystem to the 
cloud, this transition will create competitive pressures for other organiza-
tions to move into the cloud as well.
The adoption of cloud computing will undoubtedly cause a shift in 
IT operations staffing, but it clearly won’t eliminate the need for highly 
skilled internal resources—although many services will be provided from 
the outside, the relationships and interfaces to the business must still be 
skillfully managed. But we expect there will be an even more significant 
and positive shift in emphasis toward business process improvement for 
the IT organization. According to the CIO Magazine article “The Tech 
Jobs That the Cloud Will Eliminate,” there will be “[a] gradual movement 
of the IT profession away from the nuts and bolts of technology toward 
the business end of the organization. The cloud is accelerating that move-
ment of technology into the business with business-process-level expertise 
becoming more important than ever.”9
In his provocative book Does IT Matter? Information Technology and the 
Corrosion of Competitive Advantage, Nicholas Carr argues that with increas-
ing standardization and commoditization of computing resources, like the 
shift from localized to centralized electricity generation in the late 1800s, 
computing will no longer be a source of competitive advantage since it is 
available to everyone at a low cost. While Carr makes many good and subtle 
arguments, we disagree with the fundamental assertion for a simple reason: 
the low cost and accessibility of a resource do not ensure that everyone will 
utilize it equally well. In fact, it may be that with the lower cost of IT services, 
more companies will be at risk of making unwise decisions leading to poorer 
use of IT capabilities, creating more unnecessary complexity than ever before. 
While the cloud may change the cost structure of IT services, competitive 
advantage will still go to those who are able to use IT effectively to support 
the business. And the key to this? IT process leadership, supporting the con-
tinuous improvement and innovation of business processes—Lean IT.
Lean Tips for Successful IT Services Adoption
Now that we have explored ITIL within the context of Lean IT, we must 
remember that while a singular focus on tools may yield significant short-

166  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
term benefits in isolated areas, sustained enterprise-wide behavioral and 
cultural transformation will only occur when actively supported by man-
agement and founded upon deeply held principles. Perhaps the greatest 
cultural challenge with ITIL and Lean IT, and with developing an IT 
service management mind-set in general, is leaving behind what might 
be called a cowboy or hero culture, transitioning to an environment that 
encourages cross-functional teamwork, disciplined problem solving, man-
agement by fact, and responsible change management. Some individuals 
may feel that change management implies non-value-added bureaucracy, 
and often this occurs temporarily as the IT organization overcompensates 
to stabilize an out-of-control environment. But over time the processes, 
and the stakeholders responsible for those processes, should become self-
regulating. As Stephen Katz, former chief information security officer of 
Citibank, once said, “Controls don’t slow the business down. Like brakes 
on a car, controls actually allow you to go faster.”10
From a senior leadership perspective, the service orientation and common 
language of ITIL provide an opportunity for developing clear and measur-
able goals for the IT organization. This is useful in aligning IT service activi-
ties to the business operations and strategy, and for establishing effective IT 
operating and governance policies and procedures. Executives and business 
managers must be involved in charting the course, establishing clear process 
ownership, service-level expectations, and accountability for each IT service.
As we mentioned in Chapter 3, ITIL is a framework upon which to build 
your own best practices. While ITIL offers a set of useful characteristics 
or attributes, it is not a prescription, checklist, or methodology for imple-
mentation. The ITIL volumes describe a comprehensive but generic future 
state which must be adapted to the idiosyncrasies and culture of a particu-
lar IT organization and the business that it serves. ITIL is not a project or 
implementation; like Lean IT, it is an ongoing journey of discovery and 
experimentation. Like any Lean initiative, IT leadership must ensure that 
all stakeholders understand and buy in to the discipline and long-term 
commitment that are required. Successful IT service management trans-
formation is thus more social and cultural than it is technical, and should 
develop from within rather than be imposed from the top-down or the 
outside-in.
As you have learned in this chapter, ITIL naturally encourages reorgani-
zation away from a functional, silo-based structure, to one aligned accord-
ing to IT service-based processes that support the customer—from the 

Lean IT Operations: ITIL and Cloud Computing  •  167
Lean perspective, this is value stream orientation. This suggests a change 
in roles and responsibilities; each process should have an owner who is 
responsible for its performance, directed by service-level agreements 
established with the customers.
A service management framework thus naturally aligns core processes 
with the needs of the customer, rather than traditional inward-facing per-
formance measures. At every step of the transition, it is therefore impor-
tant to establish understanding and consensus among team members and 
customers, supported by a transparent decision-making process coupled 
with effective feedback mechanisms. Respect for every individual’s con-
cerns and ideas is essential—their hearts, and not just their minds, are 
needed for a lasting transformation.
Then there is the issue of operations outsourcing; selection of a partner 
should consider their willingness and ability to genuinely participate in 
continuous improvement activities. This begs the question of how they are 
compensated—on the basis of activity or value delivered? For example, an 
outsourced call center paid on the number of calls is not incented to address 
the root causes that drive higher call volume, thus creating a disincentive 
for continuous improvement. Consider operating-level agreements that 
recognize the value of effective problem solving and continuous improve-
ment, which requires an explicit commitment of the partner’s time and 
resources.
This consensus and transparency must also extend to customers, since 
they should understand the relationship between what they request and 
how much it costs. Cost chargebacks act as pricing signals to the busi-
ness, naturally driving behaviors—whether effective or ineffective. The 
common language of ITIL, with clearly defined service-level agreements 
and IT resources aligned by service rather than function, makes it much 
easier to develop direct and clearly understood costing methods that drive 
desired behavior and IT investments (see the Lean accounting discussion 
in Chapter 6).
All stakeholders involved in the request and delivery of IT services 
should come together to define value and determine how it is created. 
We recently asked ITIL authority Steve Bittinger, Gartner’s director for 
government research, “Does a team-based, continuous improvement 
approach to problem-solving accelerate and sustain the adoption of ITIL, 
when compared to a top-down, command and control ITIL effort driven 
by management and external consultants?”

168  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
His response is good advice to any IT organization attempting, whether 
through specific ITIL best practices or general Lean techniques, to improve 
IT operations performance:
Failure to take a continuous improvement approach is one of the core 
problems that many organizations experience during an ITIL implementa-
tion. The challenge is to identify a series of improvements that are practical 
(feasible/achievable), will create tangible benefits, that matter to the busi-
ness, and can be done in a relatively short time. ITIL implementation then 
becomes a series of these improvement projects, each paying its own way 
through the benefits delivered, and collectively contributing to fleshing out 
the over-arching ITIL process architecture. It is a very dynamic process 
that requires thinking strategically, and acting tactically.11
Though the terminology and best practices framework of ITIL are spe-
cific to the IT operations domain, it should be clear to the reader that the 
fundamental principles of ITIL and Lean share many of the same themes: 
alignment of value-added services based on customer-defined value, stan-
dardized work, PDCA problem solving, and continuous improvement 
that, over time, creates sustainable business results.

Lean Software Development
Chapter Objectives
In this chapter we will explore Lean software development, also known as 
Agile. We will:
•	 Continue our examination of waste versus value, this time specifi-
cally in terms of software development.
•	 Explore the importance of rigorous voice-of-customer techniques 
when defining software requirements.
•	 Demonstrate how many of the standard principles and tools of Lean 
can trim waste and build flexibility into the software development 
life cycle.
•	 Examine how Lean manufacturing approaches such as kanban and hei-
junka (level) scheduling, along with demand management and a focus 
on problem solving, revolutionize software development practices.
In 2001 a group of 17 visionaries signed the Agile Manifesto, establish-
ing a simple set of principles:
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and help-
ing others to do it. Through this work we have come to value:
•	 Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
•	 Working software over comprehensive documentation
•	 Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
•	 Responding to change over following a plan1

170  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Over the past two decades Lean software development has gone by many 
names, most commonly agile (an umbrella term often used to describe 
the collection of techniques), scrum, and extreme programming. Behind 
these names are many Lean tools and methods that have been adapted to 
software development, revolutionizing practices in the software industry. 
It is difficult to determine which Lean software development tools and 
systems were developed independently and which were derived from both 
the Lean manufacturing and Lean product development disciplines.* In 
any case, the lessons learned from Lean are useful to guide the continuing 
evolution of Lean software development.
The adoption of the term Lean software development is more than a 
name change. While agile is a set of development and life cycle man-
agement tools and methods focused on the just-in-time development of 
quality software, Lean software development addresses a larger context: 
the environment within which the software operates, the value streams 
of the enterprise. For example, in a business application, properly func-
tioning software is viewed as a supporting element of the business process. 
In an embedded software application (such as the operating system of a 
smartphone or the control systems of a jet aircraft), the software is part 
of the overall product design and value proposition to the customer.
Lean emphasizes seeing the whole through the eyes of the customer, not 
its component parts through the eyes of the designer or developer. “Lean 
software development views all Agile methods as valid, proven applica-
tions of Lean thinking to software,” says Jeff Sutherland, a signer of the 
Agile Manifesto. “It goes beyond Agile, providing a broader perspective 
that enables Agile methods to thrive.”2 In the words of Mary and Tom 
Poppendieck, “A Lean organization optimizes the whole value stream, 
from the time it receives an order to address a customer need until soft-
ware is deployed and the need is addressed. If an organization focuses on 
optimizing something less than the entire value stream, we can just about 
guarantee that the overall value stream will suffer.”3
We have witnessed many skilled agile practitioners fall into the common 
Lean trap: focusing on tools and techniques rather than solving problems 
and eliminating waste. Lean software development expands agile’s focus 
from optimizing the software development process toward improving 
*	 See The Toyota Product Development System: Integrating People, Process And Technology by 
Jeffrey Liker and James Morgan.

entire value streams. Thus, Lean software development must integrate and 
synchronize with all business processes, management systems, and kaizen* 
activity, supporting the Lean transformation of the overall enterprise.
The Challenges of Traditional 
Software Development
In the early 1980s, the U.S. government (the world’s largest software cus-
tomer) conducted a study to improve software quality, resulting in the 
Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which became a requirement for 
government contractors. CMM defines requirements for software devel-
opment and creates a framework for process improvement, ensuring a 
degree of standardization and measurability, and thus it has been widely 
adopted. Despite CMM’s benefits (it imposed a degree of standardization 
on a characteristically haphazard industry), it further entrenched a mass 
production mentality, introducing significant administrative overhead, 
while in many cases making it difficult for organizations to adopt innova-
tive methodologies such as agile.
In 1999, the President’s Information Technology Advisory Committee 
reported that the unreliable and costly nature of software development, com-
bined with the government’s enormous reliance on software for defense and 
administration, had become so severe that it was potentially harmful to the 
United States’ national interests. The committee recommended additional 
funding for research programs in software development methodology.
Waste abounds in software design—only about 20 percent of the features 
and functions in typical custom software are used regularly and around 
two-thirds are rarely used.4 In our experience, IT professionals generally 
agree that at least 50 percent of software capabilities in general, whether 
or not they are used, are not adding value to the business process they 
support; this unnecessary complexity hinders the usefulness of the appli-
cations, and requires additional training and support. Furthermore, these 
excess features must be designed, built, and maintained, wasting develop-
ment team effort which could otherwise be directed toward value-adding 
activity. In Lean terms, this is the waste of overprocessing— doing more 
than the customer values— shortly, we’ll discuss why this occurs.
*	 Kaizen is the continuous improvement of business processes described in Chapter 2.

172  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Then there’s the concern over software quality, the waste of errors and 
the defects they cause. On average, professional developers make 100 to 
150 errors in every 1,000 lines of code they write, according to a multiyear 
study of 13,000 programs by Carnegie Mellon. As a result, software projects 
often devote 80 percent of their budgets to repairing flaws they themselves 
produced.5 In addition to this astonishing level of rework are the time, frus-
tration, and disruption inflicted upon the business and its customers, and 
the effort required to provide support while problems are corrected.
The Cost of Change Curve (Figure  8.1) illustrates the impact of this 
dilemma. Originating with the Total Quality Management movement, the 
cost of change shows that the cost of fixing errors increases exponentially 
the later they are detected in the development life cycle. This suggests that 
not only must we detect and eliminate errors as early as possible, but also, 
more importantly, we must prevent errors and unnecessary features from 
being introduced into the life cycle in the first place. This is the quality at 
the source Lean principle applied to the software development life cycle.*
*	 Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) deserves mention here, a discipline that has evolved through the 
application of Six Sigma techniques to the development of new products and processes. DFSS 
practitioners describe the cost of change as a lever—the earlier in the life cycle that potential errors 
and defects are prevented, the greater the cost/benefit impact on the end result, and thus more 
leverage.

Why do these extraordinary wastes of unnecessary complexity, errors, 
delays, and cost overruns consistently result from traditional software devel-
opment? Waste is often embedded in a mass production mentality, shown 
in Figure 8.2 as the waterfall approach6,* where the time between initial 
customer request and delivery of the software is so great (months or even 
years) because large batches of changes are grouped into carefully planned 
and controlled releases. This is analogous to the wasteful batch and queue 
approach to mass production that is addressed by Lean manufacturing.
As large amounts of incomplete and untested code accumulate (work-
in-process inventory), undetected errors proliferate throughout the sys-
tem. Since the project duration is so long, developers (especially those with 
scarce skills in great demand) may be shared across several projects and 
production support incidents, causing frequent interruptions, switching 
costs, bottlenecks, and more errors. On top of it all, this approach involves 
significant project management overhead: detailed project schedules, 
*	 See the original 1970 IEEE paper by Dr. Winston W. Royce, Managing the Development of Large 
Software Systems, calling attention to the risks of the waterfall, suggesting an iterative approach. 
It is important to note that the diagram shown here is an extreme oversimplification; in Royce’s 
visionary paper he called for a sophisticated iterative approach that was a forerunner to agile 
thinking. However, many software development organizations have designed their life cycle pro-
cesses according to an overly simplified approach represented by this diagram, with the undesir-
able outcomes we describe in this section.

status reports, and resource management challenges are discussed at 
endless meetings by teams attempting to manage complexity, competing 
priorities, and scarce resources while trying to keep multiple projects on 
track. These are similar to the challenges that drove the transformation 
from push to pull in Lean manufacturing over 50 years ago.
Testing is the final step prior to release, where customers finally get to see 
what they asked for. Commonly, though, what customers initially asked for 
may not be what they really needed. And because of the long delay, their 
requirements are likely to have changed (requirements churn) causing sig-
nificant rework, additional cost, delays, and customer dissatisfaction.
This unreliability of customer requirements is due, in part, to customers 
protecting themselves from long development lead times. When a devel-
opment request is submitted, customers may include everything they can 
think of in the requirements list, since they’re afraid their next opportu-
nity won’t come around for months or years—if ever. Then, since the scope 
is so large, there is a tendency for planners to buffer the estimate for uncer-
tainties. As the gamesmanship and sandbagging pass through several lev-
els of estimating and planning, customer requirements are distorted and 
the cost and time proposed become far greater than necessary.7,*
These extended project life cycles sacrifice agility: the ability to respond 
quickly to changing circumstances and requirements. Because software 
is developed in such a linear and monolithic fashion, it becomes overly 
complex and inflexible, increasingly resistant to change. In Lean software 
development terms, such a system has accumulated technical debt, a lia-
bility of complexity and obsolescence that must be repaid at a later time. 
In the broader context of Lean enterprise transformation, dysfunctional 
software development practices inhibit business process improvement 
efforts that often depend on those small, frequent software changes.
Lean Software Development Basics
Lean software development begins with a simple premise: identify the 
20 percent of the code that provides 80 percent of the value, and deliver 
*	 This is similar to what is known by Lean manufacturing and supply chain planners as demand 
amplification, where estimated demand becomes distorted as it passes through multiple layers of 
a supply chain; see the infamous MIT Sloan School of Management, “Beer Game,” http://web.mit.
edu/jsterman/www/SDG/beergame.htm.

Lean Software Development  •  175
it just-in-time. Lean software development emphasizes pull rather than 
push scheduling, engaging the customer with requirements definition 
and testing at every iteration. This approach is reinforced by the popu-
lar phrases “Write less code” and “Test early, learn rapidly, and fail 
fast.”
According to Tom Poppendieck,
[T]he real problem with the cost of change curve [Figure 8.1] is that it fails 
to separate workflow (the sequence of activities) from scheduling (what do 
we do when). The curve is fairly flat when we do one feature at a time, it gets 
exponential when we do all of one activity before beginning the next. The 
underlying mental model behind these mistakes is thinking of software 
development as a kind of production (input-process-output) rather than as 
a problem-solving/learning activity.8
An effective software development methodology must therefore nurture 
an environment where discoveries and ideas unfold quickly and natu-
rally, deferring design commitment to the last practical moment. Lean 
software development does not follow a rigid prescriptive model (a check-
list-driven, command-and-control push schedule) but an iterative and 
adaptive approach where team members quickly learn and solve problems. 
Consistent with the Agile Manifesto, collaboration, experimentation, and 
feedback are more important than designing the right solution* the first 
time.
Paradoxically, adopting a strict zero-defects mentality too early in the 
life cycle discourages creativity, continuous learning, and experimenta-
tion. According to Dr. Christoph Steindl of IBM Global Services, “[W]hen 
a (traditional) organization has software development challenges, there 
is a tendency to impose a more disciplined process on the organiza-
tion, with more rigorous sequential processing; this generally makes a 
bad situation worse.”9 So rather than a lengthy waterfall with rigorous 
project management, Lean software development relies on rapid itera-
tions (sprints) where each cycle is an opportunity for the team (including 
the customer) to make new decisions based upon the results from the

problem and cherry-pick the best elements from each prototype. While this might appear to be a 
waste of resources, it can be a very effective way to quickly deliver high-quality, innovative prod-
ucts that customers want.

previous cycle. Each iteration* is a complete Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) 
cycle of problem solving.† The transformation of the traditional waterfall 
to iterative development is illustrated in Figure 8.3.
Fine tuning the development process to support just-in-time releases usu-
ally drives improvements (speed, quality, cost, and flexibility) throughout 
the value stream; this is analogous to the transformation which naturally 
results over time as a manufacturer shifts from large to small batch sizes, 
moving toward one-piece flow. For example, delays and changeover costs 
from one iteration to the next can be dramatically reduced. Techniques 
such as setup time reduction‡ and continuous integration§ can fundamen-

‡	Introduced by Shigeo Shingo at Toyota, this technique seeks to reduce the setup time of each 
batch, making it more economical to produce smaller batches.
§	Continuous integration is a rapid PDCA cycle where each member of the development team inte-
grates his or her code frequently, leading to multiple integrations each day. This approach detects 
problems early, reducing rework, delivery time, cost, and risk.

tally change the installation and upgrade process, making it possible to 
rapidly apply small changes efficiently and with no business disruption.
Perhaps the most widely experienced example of one-piece flow in Lean 
software development is demonstrated by Google, whose customers around 
the world have learned to appreciate (dare we say expect?) frequent, smooth, 
and surprising innovations, often released on a daily basis. Google associ-
ates are encouraged to invest up to 20 percent of their time pursuing new 
ideas and product inventions, similar to engineers in the highly innovative 
manufacturing company 3M. This investment of time has proven to be a 
strategic driver of rapid product innovation and market share growth.
Google designers observe daily usage behavior, guiding future development 
based on evidence of popular features and functions (voice of the customer). 
These small, customer-driven innovations are often released in a matter of 
days or weeks with little fanfare, and with few service interruptions.
Lean Software Development Life Cycle
Organization and Approach
The role of product manager* is responsible for the overall vision, design, 
delivery, return on investment (ROI), and strategic alignment of the soft-
ware that is being developed. This individual rarely has direct authority 
over the entire team, in this matrix management role. The product man-
ager guides the life cycle, owns the backlog, and balances customer require-
ments and production capabilities, often managing several teams—each 
developing individual software components toward a consolidated prod-
uct. He or she participates in daily standup team meetings and weekly 
synchronization meetings across multiple teams.
Collectively, product managers are the primary linkage with the enter-
prise, synchronizing the pace of software development with changing 
business requirements and continuous improvement activities. Each 
product manager (and their delegates) should participate in enterprise-
wide kaizen efforts, coordinating IT involvement for his or her particular 
software product with each business process owner.
*	 Other titles include product owner, on-site customer, and active stakeholder.

178  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Each development team should be assisted by a facilitator* skilled in Lean 
software development techniques, and with an objective perspective of the 
project. Teams should be kept as small as possible,10,† while representing a 
balanced voice of all customers and stakeholders. These multidisciplinary 
teams should be composed of individuals with complementary skills, 
where every person on the team has something to share and something to 
learn from the others.
In the spirit of concurrent development, the entire team (representing all 
stakeholders, including the customer) should operate in close proximity,‡ 
in a space designed to encourage team collaboration and workflow. This 
is the application of Lean work cell design, where teams are aligned with 
value streams and supported by pull signals and visual indicators. The 
organization should avoid shared resources across teams whenever practi-
cal, for reasons we explored in Chapter 5. In the case of distributed teams 
where physical co-location is not practical, virtual collaborative workspaces 
may be used, but occasional face-to-face meetings are helpful to maintain 
cohesion and overcome communication blocks. In all cases, team mem-
bers should make regular trips to where the customer work is performed 
(gemba) to reinforce their understanding of customer requirements.
Communications and measurements should be kept as immediate and 
visual as possible.§ Visual displays of demand, customer stories, schedules, 
project status, priorities, issues, and problems limit interruptions, keeping 
the team focused on the essentials with minimal communications over-
head. Electronic dashboards may be necessary with distributed teams, but 
in our experience nothing beats the energy of a standup meeting in front of 
a wall filled with storyboards, butcher paper, and overflowing with colorful 
sticky notes, index cards, and discount pizza coupons.
Requirements Definition
The voice of the customer is an essential element in Lean software devel-
opment, as the customers’ definition of value guides all activity. In this

case, customer requirements guide the actions of the software development 
team. The term customer requirements might be interpreted to suggest 
that the customer controls software design decisions, and that there is a 
separation between the problem, the design of the software, and its imple-
mentation. Consider instead the term design choices, which suggests that 
the customer and software designers collaborate to understand the prob-
lem and develop countermeasures, which may or may not involve software 
changes—this is problem solving versus solutions thinking.
First of all, who is the customer? This may be an internal customer, 
someone within the enterprise who is processing transactions as part of 
an internal workflow. In other cases, the application is used by external 
customers, either to support their business relationship with the enterprise 
(e.g., order processing or status inquiry) or as a commercially licensed 
software product. In all cases the software development organization must 
partner with internal customers, and/or representatives of external cus-
tomers, ensuring all requirements are clearly understood and collabora-
tively addressed.
The old adage “The customer is always right” doesn’t necessarily apply 
to Lean software development, at least not early in the life cycle. This is the 
essential reason for the discipline of A3 thinking, since the immediately 
apparent “solution” often addresses symptoms, but not the root causes. 
The team should therefore respectfully assume that customers may not 
initially know what they need, for several reasons:
•	 Customers may have strong opinions based on an incomplete under-
standing of the situation. They often don’t see or understand the 
entire process, which includes the complexity hidden behind the user 
interface and buried deep in the database, and the interdependencies 
with other processes and systems. Comprehensive requirements are 
thus uncovered by cross-functional teams using tools such as value 
stream mapping, where the process is understood by everyone. Start 
by asking not what the customer wants, but what the problem to be 
solved is; this is A3 thinking.
•	 Despite their dislike for the old system that is being replaced, the 
customers’ mental model of how the job is done, and how the overall 
business process works, is based on their familiarity with the current 
design. To many business users, the system is the process, and they 
may have a difficult time separating the two in their minds. They may 

180  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
also have a comfort level with the old system, however distasteful and 
dysfunctional it may be, and the fear of change may subconsciously 
distort how they visualize and articulate a new approach. The team 
must help customers transcend their current mental model; otherwise, 
the new application may end up behaving much like the old one.
•	 Different customers think differently; for example, a manager and 
an operator may request something entirely different from the same 
application. Similarly, expert users may require different capabilities 
from mainstream and novice users; it is often the expert users and 
managers who are the most outspoken about the system require-
ments, and mainstream users are left to struggle with unnecessary 
complexity in their daily work. The team facilitator should ensure 
balanced input while gathering requirements.
•	 The most important knowledge is often tacit: customers don’t realize 
what they know. The team must go to gemba, carefully detecting the 
customers’ intent and needs, but not necessarily their initial words. 
It is often only through conversation, observation, and experimen-
tation that customers realize what problems must be solved; this is 
how breakthrough improvement and innovation often emerge.
The team may use a variety of information-gathering techniques to 
discover the voice of the customer, in both qualitative and quantitative 
terms. These techniques range from simple brainstorming sessions and 
interviews to questionnaires, focus groups, and elaborate studies such as 
the Kano method and quality function deployment (QFD).11,* Value stream 
maps and other outputs from kaizen activity also provide essential guid-
ance to software development requirements and priorities.
In order to translate customer requirements into software specifications, 
the team gathers customer-generated use cases, stories, and scenarios,† 
which describe desired user behavior rather than technical requirements. 
In fact, the test case design process often helps customers clearly under-
stand what they really need, helping them to visualize the new application 
in the context of their daily work rather than theory. Thorough testing is 
also essential to mistake proofing, since it challenges the customer to ask,

and Sutton, part 2.

“What can go wrong here?” Test scenarios are also important artifacts 
that support documentation, training, and the iterative improvement of 
the code long after initial release.
Demand Management
The product manager is responsible for managing the backlog, which is 
a catalog of stories that identify discrete components queued for devel-
opment, and the amount of time and effort they are expected to require. 
Early in the process, T-shirt size rough estimates are often used (S, M, 
L, and XL) to indicate the relative work content of each story. To bal-
ance customer demand with development capacity, each component 
is assigned a capacity requirement estimate through a standardized 
points system. Each point roughly indicates a standard unit of develop-
ment duration.
There are many unknowns and variables to consider when estimating 
points: degree of difficulty and complexity, interdependencies, skills of the 
team members, and so on. At first, the product manager and the team may 
struggle with estimating points, but after several cycles of feedback and 
problem solving, their accuracy usually improves.
Each iteration period has a limit to the number of capacity points it may 
be assigned, according to the team cadence (other names include velocity, 
pace, and drumbeat). These are similar to a concept in Lean manufactur-
ing known as takt time, where the pace of production varies according 
to the rate of demand. However, with software development there is usu-
ally more backlog than capacity. So instead of speeding up and slowing 
down according to a changing rate of demand, the team should develop 
a cadence that is comfortable and sustainable over time. This results in a 
level pace and a stable allocation of capacity points for each period.
When determining cadence, the team should agree upon available work 
time, deducting downtime for regular meetings, training, preventative 
maintenance, vacations, and other planned activities. Unplanned activi-
ties should not be factored into available work time; each interruption 
should be investigated to identify the root cause to prevent reoccurrence. 
A slack factor should also be deducted from available work time; this factor 
should be in the range of 15–20 percent of available work time.12 Sustained 
resource utilization above 80 percent is harmful to agility and produc-
tivity in general. Queuing theory and Lean manufacturing practice have 

182  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
proven that there must be slack or else thrashing and quality problems 
inevitably result.13 ἀe slack factor is not excess capacity or wasted time—it 
is intentionally unallocated time, a reserve to be used wisely, giving busy 
teams and individuals a little breathing room to do the right things, and 
do them right the first time.
The number of points that may be achieved for each sprint cycle is deter-
mined by the team based on this demonstrated cadence, not assigned 
by managers. This is pull based on capacity, not push based on demand, 
enabling the team to naturally maintain a level schedule where the work-
load is stable without disruptive peaks and valleys (mura)* over time. 
With a level schedule, the team develops a steady work rhythm, avoiding 
periods of overload (muri) that cause poor quality, low morale, burnout, 
and turnover.
To maintain level demand, the development team and the customer 
work together to prioritize the components to be included in the next 
iteration. Negotiation is often necessary, and the product manager 
should facilitate trade-off decisions among competing priorities, also 
balancing technical considerations with customer requirements (see 
also Chapter 5 on demand management). The team must also decide 
how much time to allocate for defect correction—bug fixes and rework 
looping. The severity of the issue and the service-level agreement status 
should be considered when prioritizing corrections. During the back-
log negotiation process, unnecessary features are also culled out; oth-
erwise, they may remain on the backlog for endless cycles yet never 
make it to production. The customer must decide when stories should 
be removed from the backlog, but the product manager should encour-
age discipline—features left in the queue that will never get built are 
waste.†
A requirement may be identified and prioritized, but there may be a low 
degree of certainty in its work content, or how many capacity points it will 
consume. Work should not be released to production until the significant 
unknowns are clarified; otherwise, they will likely cause errors and delays, 
which are catastrophic to just-in-time performance. According to Jeff 
Sutherland, “[T]here are only two stable states: ready and done. The team 
*	 Mura and muri are described in Chapter 2. 
†	The product manager may keep a backburner list of potential changes that are reviewed periodi-
cally, but should strive to keep the active backlog uncluttered, representing a limited number of 
iterations.

Lean Software Development  •  183
shouldn’t let anything that’s not ready into the flow, and let nothing escape 
that’s not done.”14 Additional analysis should be performed prior to inclu-
sion in the backlog if points cannot be reasonably estimated. Fortunately, 
if a component is deferred for more analysis, it doesn’t have to wait long 
for the next iteration to come around. This is a key benefit of just-in-time: 
the production cycles are very short, so work is inserted as needed into 
the next iteration. If at the last minute work is resequenced, the cadence of 
production is not affected, which explains how high-quality software may 
be created with astonishing speed, and according to a customer’s immedi-
ate and changing requirements, while causing no disruption to the smooth 
pace of development.
The disciplined ongoing process of planning, prioritizing, and sequenc-
ing the backlog is essential to maintaining a level schedule. The team, 
facilitated by the product manager, should dedicate a significant amount 
of effort to making sure the right decisions are made; backlog grooming 
and subsequent sprint planning may require as much as 10–15 percent 
of the total available work time for the product manager and some team 
members. Placing the emphasis on more P (Plan) at the front end of each 
cycle ensures less DCA (Do, Check, Act) is needed later—less development 
time spent chasing half-baked solutions.*
Execution and Test Iterations
Once work is pulled into production (development and testing), it should 
flow swiftly to completion without delays, interruptions, or defects. Lean 
manufacturing practitioners have evolved flow into a fine art, even with 
highly complex and variable products and processes—just like software 
development. Here we will focus on two specific tools: kanban and hei-
junka, which we introduced in Chapter 5.
Kanban is a signal causing work to begin or to move to the next step of 
production. Kanban pulls workflow by demand, rather than being pushed 
by a predetermined schedule. In a factory where work is tangible, kanban 
signals are often physical: cards, containers, flashing lights, or other sig-
nals. In Lean software development, kanban is usually implemented with a 
*	 For a broader perspective on IT services demand management see Chapter 5; for an example of the 
alignment of software releases with company strategy using Strategy Deployment (Hoshin Kanri)

184  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
wall-mounted board and note cards or sticky notes, with each card repre-
senting a component or story. A kanban board indicates the demand and 
activity on a single team or project, so a development organization usually 
has several kanban boards, each located near its team. Daily team standup 
meetings center around the team boards (including the kanban and other 
visuals), which also serve as a spontaneous gathering spot whenever a 
question or issue arises. Daily discipline is required to keep the visuals 
current, or else they quickly become useless and even counterproductive.
There are two types of kanban boards most commonly used in Lean 
software development (Figure 8.4):
	
1.	Backlog: Visually displays queued work, quantifying their relative 
degree of difficulty, effort, and priority. This display provides the 
customer, team, stakeholders, and business at large with the ability to 
visualize priorities and sequence and understand backlog duration.
	
2.	In process: Visually displays all components in development (build 
and test) for the current iteration. While this may appear to be a form 
of waterfall, these steps are tightly integrated and flow very quickly, 
with the entire cycle typically lasting no more than a few weeks. This 
visual display clarifies priorities, and prevents status inquiry inter-
ruptions and other unnecessary communications.
Heijunka (meaning level schedule) is a visual-scheduling tool that 
enforces a steady sequence of work according to kanban pull signals. 
In a factory or office, the heijunka box is a series of sequentially timed 
slots, like a set of post office boxes (see example in Chapter 5, Figure 5.3). 
Each slot represents a scheduled release, and kanban cards representing 
jobs are inserted into the slots. When ready for the next job, the gate-
way (first) workcenter pulls the next card from the slot. This approach 
is helpful when the content of the work being done (whether insurance 
claims, lab orders, or software components) changes from one item to 
the next, since each kanban card may carry individual specifications and 
instructions.
In software development, the heijunka schedule is visualized with the 
“In-Process Kanban Board,” shown in Figure 8.4. Stories in the back-
log waiting for development may be scheduled and sequenced accord-
ing to the cadence, thus providing a basis for the team to estimate 
when the next story will be released to development. The total work

in process is illustrated by the total points on the board, and the flow 
of work through the process may be viewed by the points at each stage 
in the process—excess accumulation of points at a particular stage in 
the process suggests a temporary flow impediment. When work stops 
flowing, the heijunka release schedule falls behind, and kanban pro-
vides a visual sign of where the bottleneck has occurred. These signals 
guide problem-solving efforts to identify and address the cause of dis-
rupted flow: perhaps the scope of work is too large (points/hours under-
estimated), the balance of load and skills needs adjustment, someone 
is interrupted or stalled, or myriad other things that can change or go 
awry on a daily basis.
An alternative heijunka technique may be applied to Lean software 
development, moving from a time-boxed iteration schedule (controlling 
the amount of work released to production in each iteration) toward the 
ideal of one-piece flow. With this approach, the team simply pulls the next 
kanban card from the backlog as they’re ready for it. This works best for 
routine tasks with few interdependencies. By continuously reprioritizing 
the backlog as circumstances change (e.g., a critical bug is suddenly dis-
covered), a steady stream of new work may be pulled into production at 
any time, triggered by available team capacity. In a factory this evolution 
may take years, and in some cases a true one-piece flow is never achieved 
(and sometimes is not practical); nevertheless, one-piece flow is a perfec-
tion target toward which the Lean software development team may strive.
Customer Service and Support
In our experience, customer service and support is a critical element of the 
development life cycle that is sometimes disregarded by both traditional 
and agile software development practitioners. Voice-of-customer informa-
tion is ideally gathered from the field as all customers (not just those repre-
sented on the team) use a deployed application. There is perhaps no better 
place to gather this vital input than through the service desk (help desk)*, 
providing an avenue for customers to identify potential problems, and sub-
mit enhancement requests to be considered in the development backlog.
For example, during the Lean enterprise transformation of one client, 
we discovered an agile implementation where documentation and service

Lean Software Development  •  187
desk activities were still anticipating long, slow change cycles. What should 
have been a closed loop was in fact two disconnected loops that were out 
of phase: service desk staff were never certain of the current deployed state 
of the software, since their documentation and training were often weeks 
behind the agile release schedule. And since they had only limited vis-
ibility to the backlog, they didn’t know which problems and enhancement 
requests had been reviewed by the team, and which had been approved 
and placed in the backlog for development. In addition to causing internal 
chaos, the customers were frustrated, with their problems unresolved, not 
knowing when (or if) they were going to be addressed in the future. This 
is a case where agile focused on the software development life cycle, but 
disregarded the overall value stream.
Figure 8.5 illustrates a complete closed-loop customer feedback cycle 
integrating development, communication and training, support, and ongo-
ing kaizen activity. We know of one large company that requires members 
of the development team to stand duty on the service desk whenever new 
code is released, so they can hear the voice of the customer firsthand.
Measurements
Traditional software development controls and measures focus on 
cost and schedule, reviewed periodically on a very large and complex 
scale. Until development is performed on a scale that supports rapid, 
iterative changes, both of these measures are virtually guaranteed to be 
inaccurate, providing counterproductive guidance during the project. 
And the act of performing these measures, using traditional detailed 
push-scheduling tools, can be arduous and wasteful, leading to many 
long project status meetings, lengthy and complex reports, and heated 
arguments over the validity of the information. And since these tradi-
tional measures are lagging, not leading, indicators, they are of limited 
use—signaling for corrective action to a problem that might have been 
avoided in the first place.
Compared to traditional software development project management, 
Lean software development measures are simple, visual, and immediate. 
Just as in the Lean factory or office, because of small scope and rapid iter-
ations, there should be little overhead spent on monitoring and report-
ing. Problems should call attention to themselves before they are out of 

188  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
control and be addressed during the daily standup meetings (see also 
Chapter 9 on Lean project management).
Ideally, the team should maintain just a few leading indicators (process 
measures) that indicate the functioning state of the process, guiding pro-
active behavior, for example: backlog status, kanban boards, burndown 
charts, and defect trend charts. When a deviation occurs in a leading indi-
cator, the team should apply A3 thinking to solve the problem at the root 
cause level.
The burndown chart is a common tool to keep the team on track, show-
ing all tasks underway and their status, points or hours consumed, and 
work remaining for each component. Ideally, the remaining points or 
hours should represent a realistic estimate for the remaining work to be 
done, rather than the initial estimate of total hours less time invested so 
far, which may misrepresent the amount of remaining work. Significant 
deviations between originally planned and final estimates should trigger 
a root cause analysis in order to continuously improve estimate accuracy. 
The burndown chart is often shown as two trend lines, one displaying the 
planned schedule for the iteration, and the other showing actual progress. 
The gap between the two lines is an effective early warning signal during 
each day’s standup team meeting, helping the team respond quickly with 
corrective and preventative action.

Implementation and Integration 
Lessons Learned
We close this chapter with a few general observations about implementing 
Lean software development.
There is active debate about the ability of Lean software development to 
scale for large or geographically distributed teams, for complex products 
requiring extended development timelines, or where multiple systems 
must be integrated, especially with products developed by outside par-
ties who are not practicing Lean. However the larger and more complex a 
system is, the more capacity for change should be designed into it; other-
wise, the cost of change and its negative impact on business agility will be 
significant. Each case, of course, is different, with its own challenges to be 
addressed. Lean software development is not a one-size-fits-all prescrip-
tive approach, but an iterative cycle of experimentation and learning.
Similar objections have been leveled at Lean manufacturing over the 
years, but the principles, though not necessarily specific tools, have pre-
vailed in every type of situation. For example, the application of Lean 
tools in a repetitive (high-volume, low-mix) production environment is 
quite different from a highly engineered (low-volume, high-mix) factory. 
Nevertheless, using A3 thinking, teams problem-solve their way to create 
flow, often discovering new applications for existing Lean tools and tech-
niques. Similarly, as Lean software development continues to evolve and 
push the envelope of scale and complexity, generations of practitioners will 
apply Lean thinking in new ways, sharing their discoveries with others.
This leads to the most important factor in the evolution of Lean software 
development, as it supports the continuous improvement of the overall 
Lean enterprise. In our experience with common agile practices in the 
field, software development teams often do not receive formal problem 
solving or Lean training, just an introduction to specific agile develop-
ment tools and techniques. Nor are they regularly invited into kaizen 
activities such as value stream mapping and gemba walks, and thus they 
do not see the whole value stream, or the immediate problem to be solved, 
from a business context. Software development teams should regularly 
engage in business process improvement and problem solving alongside 
the business, since most problems are caused by faulty processes, not soft-
ware. This points to a fundamental shift in the traditional way that the IT 

190  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
organization interacts with the business, which we explore throughout 
this book.
Implementing Lean software development (and Lean IT in general) 
comes down to each individual thinking differently about the way he or 
she works, and the business context within which he or she adds value. 
Leadership should anticipate initial resistance to such fundamental 
change in thinking and culture. For example, teams often initially oppose 
co-location within a bullpen setting, which is often perceived as a viola-
tion of their personal space. And there will always be some who challenge 
the Lean approach every step of the way, for a variety of reasons.
In the CIO Magazine article “How to Instill Agile Development Practices 
among Your IT Team,” CIO Jackie Barretta of Con-way sums up the spirit 
of honesty and respect,
I made a rule that every person had to initially follow the practices pre-
cisely. I told them that as they became knowledgeable in the practices 
they could tweak them, and when they really understood them they could 
decide which ones to adopt. So far most people who have experienced the 
practices have decided to adopt them for the long term.15
To effectively implement Lean software development, leadership must 
establish conditions in which trust can develop. For so long, software 
developers have taken the brunt of many jokes, and they are often the 
scapegoats for project failure, complexity, and problems that originate 
from faulty requirements and flawed business processes. Not that soft-
ware development is blameless, of course, but teams must come to the 
table with a spirit of openness, solving problems and improving pro-
cesses while not blaming people. After all, Lean software development 
naturally focuses critical attention upon uncomfortable issues within 
the business processes that many would rather avoid. Honesty and trust 
between the business and the IT organization are essential, or this sim-
ply will not work.
While product managers naturally take the lead role working directly 
with the business, each member of the software development team should 
have an opportunity to participate in kaizen events, going to gemba, 
sharpening their Lean skills while developing a better understanding of 
how the business works. The IT staffing plan must therefore include time 
allocation for participation in ongoing Lean training and kaizen activities.

While this will not be easy, just like maintaining slack in production 
capacity, the investment will ultimately pay off in many ways.
When all stakeholders, including IT, actively participate in kaizen activ-
ity, quality software releases will naturally align and synchronize with the 
continuous improvement of the business processes that need them.

Applying Lean to Project Management
Chapter Objectives
An organization’s project management capability directly impacts the 
pace and success of its Lean transformation. In this chapter we will con-
sider how the principles and tools of Lean can be applied to achieve better 
project results while reinforcing Lean thinking throughout the enterprise, 
as we explore:
•	 The framework and benefits of conventional project management, 
including portfolio management and the Project Management Office.
•	 How Lean principles complement the strengths of traditional proj-
ect management.
•	 How Lean project management specifically applies to IT projects.
•	 The importance of Lean project management competence as it applies 
to Lean enterprise transformation.
The Value of Effective Project Management
Anyone who has tried to lead a project, particularly an IT project,* knows 
they are inherently complex, problematic, and risky. If not skillfully 
*	 For the purpose of this discussion, an IT project is any temporary effort to deliver a technology-
based solution (e.g., software development, application implementation, enhancement, or process 
improvement).

managed, the typical IT project goes on longer than expected, costs more 
than budgeted, encounters unexpected setbacks, and fails to satisfy stake-
holders’ requirements and expectations. Underperforming projects draw 
resources and focus away from daily operations. In most cases, proj-
ect management is the means by which change is implemented—either 
enabling the business or dragging it down.
Effective project management is about successful execution—get-
ting the right work done and delivering value on time and within bud-
get. Effective project management is an essential driver of continuous 
improvement, operational excellence, and lasting change. Let’s be clear: 
this discussion is not an indictment against professional project manage-
ment. In most cases, it is not a failing of project management processes, 
but the failure to apply project management processes properly, that leads 
to failed projects.
Let’s set the stage by describing a hypothetical situation at 
GreatServices, Inc. where a cross-functional team has been formed to 
reduce IT service request delays. The team includes a sponsor, a proj-
ect manager, and eight team members representing various functional 
groups throughout the company. The project goal seems straightfor-
ward: the company’s associates need timely IT support to do their job—
break-fix, technical support, reports, new applications, equipment, and 
so on—and current service request practices do not consistently meet 
expectations.
The project sponsor requests an initial investigation. Using question-
naires and interviews, the team learns that to submit a request, some 
departments rely on e-mail, fax, and phone calls, while others use manual 
or electronic forms. After submitting a request, not everyone gets a con-
firmation that the request has been received. The IT staff explains they 
don’t always know when a request has been submitted. As a result, service 
requests often get lost and deadlines are missed.
Associates describe the process as “a frustrating waste of time.” Some 
say they are occasionally surprised to have their requests met quickly and 
can’t explain why the system works well only some of the time. One asso-
ciate characterized the process as “hit or miss.” It’s clear to the team that 
no standard service request process has been established.
On the supply side, IT service providers say they have no visibility of 
their overall workload or available capacity and, thus, are unable to pro-
vide reliable service delivery dates. One manager exclaimed, “Our hands 

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  195
are tied!” The level of frustration is so high that some departments have 
resorted to contracting expensive outside providers because they have lost 
confidence in their in-house resources.
Based on their findings, the team concludes that service delays occur 
primarily because the company doesn’t have a standard automated service 
request system. Many of the people interviewed suggest that the right soft-
ware system should provide the structure, functionality, and controls that 
are currently lacking. The project manager develops a business justifica-
tion for the purchase and installation of a software application to process 
all IT service requests. The proposal is reviewed and approved by a capital 
expenditures committee. Next, the project manager creates a project char-
ter and project plan with a six-month duration.
Upon project approval, the clock starts ticking (it actually started tick-
ing when the business customers initially became frustrated) and work 
gets underway. The project manager submits weekly status reports to the 
project sponsor that track the budget and task completion, highlight-
ing any setbacks encountered or potential problems detected. A steer-
ing team (composed of the project sponsor, several directors, and the 
project manager) meets every month to review project status and change 
requests.
The project is eventually completed with mixed results, taking four 
months longer to complete than anticipated, while exceeding the origi-
nal budget by almost 50 percent. Although training sessions were held 
and an online tutorial is available, users of the system say it’s user-
unfriendly, overly complex, and packed with features they don’t need. 
In the end, many choose not to use the new system, developing work-
arounds and reverting to old methods. A postmortem is held to discuss 
what went well and what didn’t. At the meeting, the CEO declares, “I 
see this as a qualified win. It could have been much worse; at least the 
system is up and some people are using it!” A final report is completed 
and filed away.
Does this sound familiar? It’s a scenario that plays out every day in 
countless variations. So what went wrong in this case, and what goes 
wrong with projects in general? Simply this: people tend to jump at 
solutions, bypassing the rigor of grasping the situation, identifying the 
real business problems that need to be addressed, and understanding 
root causes. In addition, the unexpected is almost always guaranteed to 
take place. From the first thought that a project may be required to the 

196  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
time the project is completed, myriad events and discoveries occur that 
alter the assumptions and circumstances upon which the project char-
ter and plan were created. Unanticipated events occur throughout the 
life cycle of all projects: new stakeholders, additional requirements and 
expanded scope, delayed decision making, internal politics, constrained 
resources, project delays, and changes in funding. These unforeseen 
changes, occurring suddenly and with little warning, are a major reason 
why projects are often late, are over budget, and produce results that fail 
to meet the customers’ changing requirements (see the CHAOS Report 
in Figure 3.1).
In our experience, the root cause of project failure is the improper appli-
cation of project management methods. In addition, many project teams 
do not examine the value stream context of the problem or opportunity 
being addressed. Thus, they are unable to properly diagnose the current 
state and their “solutions” are predestined to fail. The telltale symptoms of 
doomed projects include:
•	 Poor understanding of stakeholder requirements
•	 Right solution to the wrong problem
•	 Wrong solution to the right problem
•	 No strategic alignment
•	 Conflicting priorities
•	 No consideration of risks or formal risk management
•	 Lack of user buy-in, trust, and resistance to change
•	 Deficient user involvement
•	 Inadequate resources and/or funding
•	 Unrealistic timeline
•	 Poor change/transition management and communication
•	 Ineffective control of scope
•	 Weak or missing user testing and acceptance
•	 Insufficient monitoring and upkeep after go-live
For anyone who has been involved in a large-scale IT project, this list is 
all too familiar. Before we consider how Lean complements and strength-
ens effective project management, let’s briefly explore portfolio, program, 
and project management.

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  197
The Project Management Body of Knowledge
The Project Management Institute (PMI)* has established a foundation of 
practice upon which we can apply Lean thinking to augment project man-
agement practices. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)† 
provides a framework that supports central Lean tenets including align-
ment, standard work, structured problem solving, and effective teams. 
Lean principles and tools apply to all three levels of project management: 
portfolio, program, and project, as shown in Figure 9.1. Organizations 
require competence across all three levels to effectively align, plan, and 
execute projects, allocating limited resources to best achieve strategic 
objectives.
Portfolio Management
Beginning in the upper-right-hand corner of Figure 9.1, portfolio man-
agement focuses on “ensuring that projects and programs are reviewed to 
prioritize resource allocation, and that the management of the portfolio 
is consistent with and aligned to organizational strategies.”1 Its focus is

program, and project management. See www.pmi.org.

senting the foundational concepts and standards that are applied to project management world-
wide. The most recent fourth edition was published in 2008.

strategic, aligning and coordinating all projects and programs to fulfill 
the overarching goals of the organization. In harmony with Lean’s strat-
egy deployment (see Chapter 6), portfolio management takes a holistic 
view of the company’s projects and programs (which represent invest-
ments in people, time, and money), attempting to balance priorities and 
available resources with strategic objectives.
Organizations with ineffective or missing portfolio management capa-
bilities are like an orchestra without a conductor—each section of the 
symphony is playing their part but with no coordination, cadence, or 
synchronization. The collective impact on the business can be disastrous, 
leaving a trail of costly disappointments, conflicting priorities and effort, 
overburdened resources, and poor morale.
Program Management
PMI defines a program as “a group of related projects managed in a coor-
dinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from managing 
them individually.”2 Program management is both tactical and stra-
tegic: tactical in that it focuses on coordinating the interdependencies 
and resource requirements of related projects, and strategic in the sense 
that it supports and directs associated projects toward shared objectives. 
Program management allocates resources based on priorities established 
at the portfolio management level. Organizations without effective pro-
gram management are less equipped to purposefully assign resources to 
those projects aligned with organizational objectives.
Unmanaged complexity and risk from project interdependencies increase 
the likelihood of program failure. Program management addresses inter-
dependencies between projects while ensuring coordination of resources 
aligned with established priorities. Through the Project Management Office, 
standards and best practices are established, giving project managers the 
tools and support they need to effectively manage programs and projects.
The Project Management Office
The Project Management Office (PMO) acts as a Center of Excellence for 
project management expertise and discipline throughout the organization. 
A Center of Excellence provides standard practices, tools, templates, train-
ing, support, knowledge management, measurements, and infrastructure 

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  199
for a particular domain of knowledge and practice such as Lean or project 
management.
Depending on the culture and project management capabilities already in 
place, a PMO sometimes works in a consultative role providing project man-
agement training, tools, and coaching. Alternatively, PMOs may also actively 
coordinate and manage project resources, ensuring project management 
standard practices are followed, monitoring project status, and intervening 
if a project appears to be heading for trouble. Often PMOs assist senior man-
agement with portfolio management and steering team activities as well.
Project managers either are members of the PMO and assigned to func-
tional areas of the business as needed, or they are permanent members of 
the business who look to the PMO for standards, support, and additional 
resources. Figure 9.2 compares each approach. A pool of project manag-
ers reporting to a central PMO strengthens consistency of project man-
agement standards and practices. On the other hand, project managers 
directly assigned to functional areas develop a deeper level of understand-
ing of business operations and stronger relationships with customers. 
Operations which own permanently assigned project managers directly 
control assignments and sometimes develop unique project management 
tools and methods to meet localized needs—a good thing when these best-
practice innovations are then shared with the rest of the organization.
When project managers are centrally located, there is often a challenge 
for the PMO to balance demand and supply of project managers (demand 
management), necessitating enterprise-wide trade-offs. Some would argue 
Is Lean a Program?
We often encounter organizations that refer to Lean and/or Six 
Sigma as a program when describing their efforts to become a learn-
ing organization pursuing ongoing improvement. In our experience, 
labeling continuous improvement a program is a mistake as it sends 
the wrong message to the organization. A program is similar to a 
project: it typically has a beginning, a middle, and an end point. But 
continuous improvement is a never-ending journey of experimen-
tation and learning. Labeling Lean a program is at best misleading 
as some associates may choose to “sit this one out,” anticipating the 
changes to be short-lived. We prefer to call them initiatives, efforts, 
methods, or ways (as in “the Lean way”).

200  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
this is preferable as long as trade-off decisions are aligned with enterprise 
objectives, creating a dynamic, collaborative environment where choices 
are acknowledged.
When project managers are located in functional areas, department 
managers may independently make trade-off decisions when demand 
exceeds supply, at times choosing between organizational goals, localized 
objectives, or individual compensation objectives. In this case, without 
an effective governance mechanism in place, there is a greater likelihood 
that localized decisions may not be aligned with organizational priorities. 
(We’ll address governance in Chapters 10 and 11).
Applying the principles and tools of Lean, the PMO can standardize 
project management best practices across the enterprise, eliminating 
wasteful non-value-adding activities while reinforcing the consistent use 
of A3 thinking, customer-defined value, value stream awareness, and 
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) problem solving. More on this later.
Project Management
PMI defines a project as “a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a 
unique product, service, or result.”3 A project is goal oriented and consists 
of a series of interrelated non-routine tasks. When projects are completed, 
there is usually a handoff to operations.
Project management is defined as “the application of knowledge, skills, 
tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.”4 
PMI’s Project Management Body of Knowledge identifies 42 core project 
management processes spread over five distinct phases (process groups) 
shown in Figure 9.3.

The Disconnect between Strategy and 
Ex ecution: The Role of the PMO
IT organizations face the constant challenge of maintaining existing 
information systems while keeping up with evolving customer require-
ments for information and a changing technology landscape, given 
limited resources and unremitting pressure to control costs. But they 
often lack a standardized approach for prioritizing projects, ensur-
ing adequate capacity, effectively monitoring project performance, 
and making timely corrective actions. These shortcomings are by no 
means exclusive to IT and are often present throughout the enterprise.
Why do so many companies struggle with the strategic alignment of 
programs and projects, and their successful execution? We often dis-
cover a disconnect between portfolio management and project execu-
tion, between strategy and tactics, intention and action. One Fortune 
100 company formed a global project oversight group using state-of-
the-art portfolio management tools. Senior management was pleased 
with their plan for strategic alignment of programs and projects.
However, there were no central oversight measures in place, nor 
had standard project management practices been developed. Each 
functional area (e.g., operations, IT, and procurement) and each geo-
graphic region was left to devise its own project management systems 
and practices. Not only was alignment detached from execution, but 
also every project was run differently. The company had not defined 
standard project management practices, nor created support systems 
to reinforce standardized work.
The consequence to the organization was inconsistent project 
results, with no clear linkage between the defined strategy and 
targeted results. Some projects were thoroughly planned and well 
executed, delivering anticipated outcomes. Others applied informal, 
improvised approaches rendering isolated successes mixed with 
many disappointments and a few colossal failures.
What the company was missing were management systems and 
standard processes to provide oversight and ensure that strategic 
intent was distilled into aligned, prioritized projects that were con-
sistently executed. Applied properly, effective portfolio, program, 
and project management address these issues by providing the 
framework and standard tools to proactively plan for and adjust to 
competing priorities and relentless change. 

202  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
The primary focus of project management is tactical—centered on task 
execution through attention to scope, quality, schedule, budget, resources, 
and risk. Experienced project managers may be familiar with another 
popular definition for project management: having the responsibility to 
create a miracle but not the authority to do so.
Most projects have some disruptive impact on the organization as they 
divert resources and attention away from daily operations. When project 
management is ineffective, the extent of the disruption is even greater and 
expected benefits are often postponed or abandoned. The longer a project 
languishes, the greater the cost in time, resources, and credibility, and the 
more difficult it is to control scope, budget, and resources while maintain-
ing focus on delivering customer-defined value.
In the past, project management concentrated most of its effort on 
maintaining project schedules and budgets, emphasizing the adminis-
trative mechanics of defining tasks, monitoring progress, and reporting 
status. In today’s complex and multifaceted IT projects, while traditional 
project management skills are absolutely necessary, they are not by them-
selves sufficient. And, from a Lean perspective, as much as half of project 
management tasks add little or no value and can be eliminated. Examples 
include detailed status reports, excessive meetings, overly-documented 
conversations, unshared analysis, and other information-gathering tasks 
that do not improve project performance.
Lean principles and tools position the project manager and team for 
success. As organizations seek to become more agile (see Chapter 4) and 
find ways to remove time and cost from projects without compromising 
on quality results, Lean principles and tools represent essential core capa-
bilities. Project managers must see their role as evolving from an exclusive 
focus on efficiency, completing projects on time and within budget, to a 
Initiate

focus on flexibility, quickly delivering incremental value to internal and 
external stakeholders.
Beyond tactical project management skills, project managers must 
develop proficiency in Lean thinking, facilitation, effective team building, 
problem solving, and escalation. Escalation is the ability to sense when 
an insurmountable barrier is approaching and to resolve it skillfully by 
gaining the appropriate level of authority without alienating any stake-
holders. Lean project management, driven by A3 thinking and manage-
ment by facts, supports the art of escalation while minimizing internal 
politics. Lean thinking focuses on problem processes, not problem people, 
to address root causes, often removing resistance and strengthening trust. 
Critical assessments become constructive when people are no longer tar-
geted as part of the evaluation (i.e., shot for being the messenger).
Improving Project Management Results with Lean Thinking
As we’ve discussed throughout this book, organizational effectiveness is 
created and sustained by continuous process improvement. Companies 
that perceive problems (and projects) as opportunities to improve under-
lying processes are able to stay ahead of the competition. Frequently, how-
ever, project teams focus exclusively on the deliverables of the project: a 
system upgrade, new infrastructure, or other tangible investment. While 
these may be valid objectives, when teams fail to see the business pro-
cess improvement opportunity, they miss the path to superior results. By 
implementing a solution before thoroughly understanding problems and 
improving underlying processes, they unknowingly increase the risk of 
project failure. To avoid this common error, rigorous project management 
should be augmented with Lean thinking, a focus on the less tangible 
(but equally important) deliverables of process improvement—creativity 
before capital.
One pragmatic client of ours, a seasoned project manager, observed, “On 
the surface, some projects appear to offer very little process improvement 
content; you just need to crank out the work.” In our opinion, all projects 
are opportunities to work on process improvement while getting the work 
done. Organizations that eliminate the distinction between performing 
the work they do and improving how work is done develop the habit and 
culture of kaizen. We like the motto: do your work, improve your work, 
and improve yourself.

204  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Information system project managers tend to come from technical 
backgrounds and are likely to perceive a project as an implementation 
(e.g., the delivery of an enhancement or new application), not a process 
improvement project (e.g., streamlining the release management process). 
Often IT projects are assigned a project manager but not a Lean facili-
tator, so their focus is primarily on the execution of predefined deliver-
ables. Project management has developed formalized processes to manage 
complex issues and avoid common pitfalls. However, some of the methods 
used by today’s project managers inadvertently introduce inflexibility.
For example, extensive planning, documentation, and stakeholder 
signoffs at the front end of a traditionally managed project can create resis-
tance to change later in the project, suppressing much needed midcourse 
corrections. Formal change control may require extensive documentation 
and authorization. It’s understandable that project managers push back on 
change: it’s additional work to change the plan and obtain another round 
of signoffs. However, such resistance to change can inhibit the iterative 
PDCA process of Lean and prevent a company from becoming a learning 
organization focused on rapid cycles of improvement.
Project teams can become so focused on a fixed end state that they may 
not pause to consider the root causes of problems. “That’s out of scope,” 
they often counter. Such “get’er done” projects must return later to address 
root causes (rework), or, even worse, the organization learns to live with 
suboptimal results—both are wasteful outcomes. In fact, by not addressing 
root causes, the project may introduce new inefficiencies and additional 
layers of wasteful non-value-added work. This is a training and process 
problem, not a people problem. Although they should be, not all project 
managers are familiar with the principles and tools of Lean.
Looking at it from the other side, continuous improvement projects are 
rarely assigned a skilled project manager. Companies often assume that 
the individual leading a kaizen event or Six Sigma project possesses suf-
ficient project management skills. Process improvement coaches facilitate 
A3 thinking, value stream mapping, and iterative problem solving. Their 
primary focus is on discovery and adjusting to new facts. These individu-
als are experienced in applying Lean principles and tools, but that does 
not always translate into good project management skills.
The skills and focus of a seasoned project manager are significantly 
different from those of a process improvement facilitator, including for-
mal management of budgets, resources, risk, and issues escalation. Their 

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  205
primary focus is on control and stability, and their skills are particu-
larly useful when process improvement and IT projects extend beyond 
departmental boundaries, require significant investment, utilize shared 
resources, and introduce risk to the organization. However, many proj-
ect management tools and methods are bloated with waste and add little 
value. Project managers should learn to utilize Lean principles and tools 
to reduce wasteful practices, improving project agility and responsiveness. 
Figure 9.4 compares project management and process improvement skills.
So how does an organization provide effective Lean facilitation and 
sound project management with limited resources? The PMO and the 
Lean Centers of Excellence, through training and coaching, are the ideal 
resources to ensure a suitable balance between control and flexibility. 
In most cases, given adequate training and guidance, two people are 
not necessary to fill the dual roles of project manager and Lean coach. 
All the skills listed in Figure 9.4 can and should be developed in project 
managers. Large, risky, expensive, cross-functional projects should be 
considered for a designated project manager and one or more process 
improvement facilitators.
When we review the performance of IT projects and continuous improve-
ment efforts, often the key differentiator between success and failure is the 
capability and skill of the facilitator (project manager, sensei, black belt, 
coach, etc.). Project management delivers a proven framework for con-
trol, while Lean encourages flexibility and iterative team problem solving. 
Effective organizations combine these competencies to consistently deliver 
superior project results based on the bedrock of continuous improvement.

Lean Project Management
Lean project management applies the core principles of Lean thinking to 
reinforce the effectiveness of project management by emphasizing itera-
tive discovery and problem solving, value delivery, and eliminating waste-
ful tasks, resulting in improved quality, reduced total elapsed project time, 
and reduced project costs. To explore this further, let’s begin by describing 
a conventional project management approach and then apply Lean think-
ing to shift the paradigm.
The Triple Constraints Model
Perhaps the most fundamental concept in project management is the 
triple constraints model, which suggests all projects are limited by three 
elements: time, cost, and scope. The classic adage here is, “We can com-
plete the project quickly, be within budget, and have the deliverables you 
want—pick any two.” Fortunately, the situation is often more malleable 
than the cliché. As shown in Figure 9.5, the project management triangle 
illustrates the principal of project management trade-offs.
If we change project duration, it is likely that costs will be affected. If 
the budget is reduced, we may have to adjust the scope of the project. If we 
increase the work content of the project to support an expanded scope, it 
is likely to impact both time and cost. No element of the triangle can be 
changed without impacting at least one of the other elements.
When managing constraints, the first course of action is to determine 
the primary driver of the project and adjust accordingly. The art of proj-
ect management is to blend these three factors to achieve the most criti-
cal needs of the organization. For example, if time is the most important

aspect of the project, the budget might be increased to support more 
resources and/or scope might be reduced.
Applying Lean Thinking to Project Management
Lean project management focuses on reducing overall elapsed project time 
to break through the seemingly inherent tradeoff of time, cost, and scope. 
Lean project management applies process improvement to both underlying 
business processes and project management methods. As waste is removed, 
the impact of the triple constraints is diminished. Projects that focus on 
reducing total project time (versus individual task time) yield better qual-
ity results, in less time and for less cost, because improved quality trans-
lates into less rework.
The triple constraints trade-off remains but grows weaker as organiza-
tions adopt small, iterative project cycles to achieve targeted objectives. In 
doing so, the organization is choosing what appears to be more time and 
more cost, because more effort is invested in planning (P-DCA). In fact, 
our experience shows that smaller scoped rapid-cycle projects yield better 
results, in less total time and cost. As project work is done in rapid iterative 
learning cycles, deliverables generate value at each cycle’s completion rather 
than only at the end of the project. In addition, there is less work in process, 
allowing simpler coordination of tasks and resources, while improving 
agility and flow of the overall project to ensure early realization of value.
From a Lean perspective, the critical element that drives project suc-
cess lies beyond the triple constraints: effective team engagement in root 
cause analysis and iterative problem solving. A project can have sufficient 
time, adequate funding, an appropriate scope of work identified, and an 
engaged team, but without a team equipped to solve root causes of under-
lying process problems, the most skilled project management expertise will 
not generate sustainable results. Project managers, facilitators, and team 
members with the skills to see the whole value stream and grasp delivery 
of value to customers and stakeholders have a more insightful context in 
which to run the project.
All projects should apply Lean principles to the processes targeted for 
improvement in order to identify the most appropriate course of action. 
When projects start with a predetermined solution (like our GreatServices, 
Inc. story at the beginning of this chapter) without initially examining and 
improving underlying processes, the inevitable outcome is more efficient 

208  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
throughput of broken processes—more unsatisfactory results delivered at 
a faster pace! This is particularly true with IT projects.
Lean should also be applied to remove non-value-added work from all 
phases of portfolio, program, and project management. We typically find 
wasteful practices in many activities throughout the project life cycle, 
including project administration, reporting, expediting, and documenta-
tion. At the project execution level, by eliminating wasteful project man-
agement tasks, more time is available to develop countermeasures, test 
results, and put improvement ideas into action. Wasteful project manage-
ment practices include activities such as lengthy and unproductive project 
status meetings, collection of redundant or useless project data, and docu-
ments (stakeholder requirements, risk analysis, etc.) that are created but 
never referenced during the project.
Two common non-value-added practices are detailed schedule mainte-
nance, which is not used to monitor and make adjustments to the project, 
and the preparation of consolidated weekly status reports, which are dis-
regarded by senior management until a major problem has been flagged. 
Besides introducing non-value-added work, these periodic “push” reports 
create an artificial separation between those controlling project information 
and the team members and stakeholders who need access to one another.
In a Lean environment, the project team would rely on an obeya room to 
communicate project issues on a real-time basis (obeya is Japanese for big 
room). The approach is similar to a project war room used as a central meet-
ing place to co-locate team members for the duration of the project. However, 
the focus here is on collaboration and communication. The walls (physical or 
virtual) of an obeya room are covered with visual charts and graphs depict-
ing project issues, A3s, and other devices communicating actual progress 
versus the plan, burn down status, countermeasures, and other useful infor-
mation. Rather than standard weekly meetings, members of the cross-func-
tional team meet daily, using standup meetings (huddles) to discuss current 
issues and challenges as they arise. The goal of the obeya room is to speed up 
the PDCA cycle by making information accessible to all team members, so 
the team can  detect and solve problems as early as possible.
A3 Thinking
A classic maxim in project management maintains that organizations 
that fail to define project goals and objectives unknowingly plan to fail. 
Project management often begins with predefined objectives and applies 

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  209
a standard methodology to implement the solution. Often these projects 
focus on symptoms rather than root causes. Before contemplating an IT 
project (or any project, for that matter) with a predefined solution, orga-
nizations should take a step back and clearly define the problem they are 
attempting to solve. A3 thinking is about having the awareness and tenac-
ity to move beyond symptoms to take on root causes.
A3 thinking is the consistent application of PDCA problem solving to 
identify the best course of action to address challenges and opportunities. 
A3 thinking guides the team’s activities toward a well-defined problem or 
opportunity and simultaneously builds flexibility into the project. As new 
facts are uncovered, project objectives are modified to meet actual needs 
instead of planned needs. Defining measures of project success up front is 
critical, so everyone can buy into the expected outcome/benefit. However, 
activities and performance targets evolve based on the team’s understand-
ing of how effectively current processes deliver value as defined by the 
customer; this is the essence of agility.
Flexibility in developing solutions based on reflective observation is a 
central principle of A3 thinking. Consider a project to implement a new 
invoice payment system. Applying A3 thinking and PDCA, the team dis-
covers the software application works fine but current procedures include 
excessive steps and redundant authorizations, adding delays and errors 
to the process. It is essential that the project sponsor supports the team’s 
evidence-based decisions as their understanding of the facts changes. 
When the team meets with the sponsor and shares its findings (through 
an updated A3), it is the role of the sponsor to critically challenge—and, if 
convinced, support—the team’s recommended course of action. This may 
mean abandoning the initial “solution,” which can create some pushback 
from stakeholders in the organization. It is the project sponsor who should 
address these issues, allowing the team to remain focused on grasping the 
situation, seeing the flow of quality work, developing countermeasures, 
and making improvements.
Both conventional and Lean project management focus on doing the 
right things (leadership) and doing them right the first time (management). 
Traditional project management creates a detailed work breakdown struc-
ture early in the project for budget and tracking purposes.* In Lean project 
management, work tasks are also assigned, but they are expected to change 
*	 See PMBOK Guide, 4th ed., Section 3.2.

210  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
based on discovery, rather than being entirely predefined. Lean provides 
the tools to support that flexibility. Applying PDCA creates a mechanism 
to do the right things at the right time. Lean project management means 
having the appropriate level of structure and control to enable progress 
toward measurable targets. Work assignments adjust based on the discov-
ered facts. As teams verify that countermeasures produce desired results, 
emphasis shifts from problem solving to solution implementation.
It’s important to note that, unlike a project, continuous improvement 
never ends; it simply begins another cycle. The focus of the next cycle is 
based on the results of the last cycle. If results are less than desired, another 
round of PDCA is started. If the results are satisfactory, sustaining mea-
sures are put into place to monitor performance and warn of deviations. 
Focus then shifts to another round of improvement effort based on the 
organization’s priorities.
In our story at the start of this chapter the predefined objective was to 
improve IT service request response time, and the team’s “solution” was 
to install a software application. Had the team started with A3 thinking, 
seeking to grasp core process problems, they would have discovered that 
process changes were necessary prior to evaluating a new technology inter-
vention. Once consensus had been reached on the problem and improve-
ments had been made to the underlying business processes, a clear and 
accurate determination of appropriate software (if needed) would have 
been possible.
There is tremendous leverage when IT professionals apply A3 think-
ing skills and engage in the entire PDCA process—rather than just the 
D (Do). This shift in focus sounds very simple but is fiendishly difficult to 
accomplish.
Often organizations adopt the A3 form but not A3 thinking. The A3 
form, an example of which is shown in Figure 9.6, is a valuable tool to 
communicate the extent of the teams’ understanding of the situation, 
project objectives, timelines, status, and results. A3 formats vary; how-
ever, the form should be viewed as a representation of the engagement, 
discovery, understanding, and problem-solving process experienced by 
the team or individual. When used to communicate project issues, experi-
enced project managers new to the A3 are often surprised by its simplicity 
and effectiveness. (See Appendix D for a sample completed A3.)
When project managers augment the strengths of established project 
management practices with Lean thinking, project results are realized

more quickly and are better aligned with customer requirements. While 
these principles may not be new to project management, they need to be 
reemphasized. As shown in Figure 9.7, Lean enhances project manage-
ment through its emphasis on alignment, customer-defined value, itera-
tive learning, and agility.
Value Stream Mapping
In our GreatServices, Inc. story, a group of people form a team and 
quickly reach the conclusion that a new software application is required. 
Perhaps the need for a new system was assumed even before they started. 
Without a defined approach to analyze the current situation, teams rely 
on personal experience, bias, isolated incidents, and anecdotes to develop 
an understanding of the problems they are tasked to solve. Team mem-
bers with strong verbal skills and compelling stories may unduly influ-
ence team opinion, inhibiting thorough analysis and discovery. Armed 
with the best intentions, it is only human nature to identify the solution as 
quickly as possible.
Deming said, “Management of a system requires knowledge of the inter-
relationships between all the sub-processes within the system and every-
body that works in it.”5 Value stream mapping graphically depicts the 
interdependencies of processes, providing the insight needed to develop 
innovative countermeasures to address root causes of problems. Mapping 
the value stream enables the team to identify non-value-added (wasteful) 
steps in the process, quality issues, and where work does not flow. Clearly 
understanding what current information systems provide in the context

of value creation is priceless. Value stream mapping also enables the team 
to identify, and potentially quantify, the value of the project deliverables. 
The focus shifts from delivering features to delivering value.
Project teams that use value stream mapping develop a common lan-
guage to describe the problem, building consensus and team chemistry. 
Once the team has a solid grasp of the current state, seeing the whole and 
quantifying the problem from an overall systems perspective, they are 
in position to develop potential countermeasures and prioritize efforts. 
In most cases, project objectives and deliverables should not be finalized 
until value stream mapping has been completed.
Plan-Do-Check-Act, DMAIC, and Project Management
The nature of project management is the timely execution of a solution 
to address a need, opportunity, or problem. All project management 
includes some form of problem solving, usually a great deal, but when 
teams encounter problems, responses range from ad hoc, shoot-from-the-
hip reactions to methodical, structured problem solving.
Project managers should be aware of Lean and Six Sigma tools and 
methods. Figure 9.8 shows the five phases of project management matched 
with Lean PDCA, Six Sigma DMAIC,* and some of the supporting tools. 
The following sections explore this in order of the five phases of project 
management.
Initiate
The Initiate phase corresponds to the Plan stage of PDCA and the Define 
stage of DMAIC. During the initiation of the project, Lean and Six Sigma 
practitioners seek to understand voice of the customer to develop a 
thorough understanding of stakeholder requirements—avoiding a com-
mon source of project failure.
Project managers have always been aware of the importance of stake-
holder requirements—this is not a new idea. The difference with Lean 
project management is the emphasis that is placed on identifying and 
validating customer requirements throughout the project life cycle. 
*	 We discuss PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) in Chapter 2 and Six Sigma’s corresponding DMAIC 
(Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) in Appendix B.

214  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Often stakeholder requirements are defined by the project manager or a 
small part of the project team. Once gathered, a report is created, filed, 
and a checkbox is marked complete. The entire team may not even see 
the final report. Employing voice of the customer, Lean involves stake-
holders and team members at a more intimate level throughout the proj-
ect. With each PDCA cycle, customers are reengaged to further define 
value, validate understanding, and adjust to changing needs. This can 
only be accomplished when teams proactively engage with stakeholders 
and customers.
Far too frequently, teams perform their analysis of the current state 
without leaving the comfort of the team meeting room to talk with the 
people performing the work, those who supply the inputs, and those who 
receive their output. Lean stresses going to gemba, where the work is actu-
ally performed and value created, to witness firsthand the flow of infor-
mation and work, to see what’s really happening. Project teams should go 
to gemba regularly throughout the project to validate facts and develop 
deeper levels of understanding. In IT, this also includes observing users as 
they work with applications and walking through processes with associ-
ates step by step.
In multisite organizations, frequent visits to gemba may be impracti-
cal. The next best alternative is to regularly share the latest A3 and value 
stream map with other sites and follow up with conference calls and vid-
eos of gemba visits. Use technology to stay close to your stakeholders,

deepen your understanding, and hear the voice of the customer. A web-
based obeya room is also effective to communicate issues and project sta-
tus across multiple locations.
Plan
In some organizations, planning is perceived as delaying real project work 
(execution) so we rush through the planning stage in order to get busy. 
The problem with this approach is that we end up mistaking activity for 
productivity. It’s counterintuitive to many, but to speed up a project and 
successfully deliver value, you must first slow down! A common misper-
ception is that the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle is divided into four equal 
quadrants, each taking roughly the same amount of time. The left side of 
Figure 9.9 shows this common understanding, although in many orga-
nizations, planning doesn’t even receive 25 percent of the total elapsed 
project time.
As shown on the right, more time should be invested in planning activi-
ties than in the other three steps combined. Projects have a significantly 
greater chance of success when teams thoroughly grasp the current state, 
go to gemba, understand stakeholder value, gather data, measure activity, 
and develop and test multiple countermeasures (all planning activities).
As the duration of a project increases, the chance of project failure also 
increases. Companies that apply Lean project management divide projects 
into shorter phases (this is also discussed in Chapter 8 as an element of 
Lean software development). To reduce risk, we recommend decomposing 
larger projects into 90-day stages of limited scope and specific milestones.

This simple technique maintains team focus on current problems and 
deliverables, creating a sense of urgency while reinforcing the need for 
effective teamwork.
Shorter projects with a focused scope reinforce iterative learning and 
adjustments based on facts. In the Harvard Business Review article “The 
Truth about IT Costs,” Susan Cramm explains, “Limiting project scope 
makes projects less risky and more likely to succeed. That, in turn, 
increases buy-in for subsequent stages.”6 This is not a Lean project man-
agement invention, but it is Lean in its approach: rapid iterations support 
rapid discovery and superior results.
Organizations need to be aware of cultural implications when adopt-
ing shorter, iterative-cycle projects. Many companies are accustomed to 
using fixed scopes, budgets, and schedules to hold people accountable for 
results. In order to gain buy-in and support, senior management must be 
comfortable with an iterative rapid-cycle approach. While accountability 
is created with smaller scopes and project phases, some cultures are not 
initially comfortable with a more fluid, recursive style. In Lean organiza-
tions, as shorter cycle projects become the norm, the PDCA cycle becomes 
standard practice.
Both Lean product development and Lean software development uti-
lize rapid project cycles. Each development round represents a complete 
PDCA problem-solving cycle. As cycles increase (duration decreases while 
speed increases), so do the learning, understanding of root causes, and 
value generation. For example, Lean software development (also known as 
agile, see Chapter 8) has transformed software development from lengthy, 
broad-scope, big-bang projects lasting many months (or years) to nimble, 
customer-driven, limited-scope, iterative development efforts lasting 
weeks or months.
During the Plan phase, Lean and Six Sigma stress current state measure-
ment and analysis. Root cause analysis directs our focus beyond symp-
toms to systematically address the origins of problems. This is the heart of 
A3 thinking and PDCA, which are reflective in nature; an improvement is 
made, and based on results, the next step is determined. Two of the most 
effective root cause analysis methods are Five Whys and the Fishbone 
Diagram (see sidebar “The Five Whys”).
Value stream mapping plays a central role during the planning phase 
as the team grasps the current situation, builds consensus, and begins to 
develop potential solutions. During mapping the gathering of baseline

The Five Why s
The Five Whys is the simple method of asking, “Why?” repeat-
edly until the root cause of a problem is uncovered. Normally the 
root cause is reached by the time we ask the fifth why. When the 
team believes it has identified a root cause, it works backward using 
“Therefore…” to test its logic and ensure it hasn’t missed a step in the 
sequence. For example, if the team investigating IT service request 
delays would have used the Five Whys, it might have gone as follows:
Service Requests are delayed and cause
 disruption to operations. Why? (#1)
Because IT departments are unable to handle service
requests on a timely and accurate basis; their system
of logging, scheduling, performing, and delivering
services is inadequate. Why? (#2)
Because diﬀerent request formats and delivery systems
are used, this creates confusion, missing information
from requestors, and a lack of visibility for the service
providers. Why? (#3)
Because there is no standard procedure for submitting 
and processing a request. Why? (#4)
Because no standard procedure has been created.

Had the team performed root cause analysis, it may have dis-
covered that there was a need for improving underlying business 
processes and developing standard work before considering technol-
ogy-based solutions (a common theme throughout this book).
The Fishbone Diagram
The fishbone* diagram is an effective tool to identify potential causes 
of a problem. In the following diagram, the goal (improve IT service 
request response time) is analyzed using categories to identify and 
organize inputs and possible causes—in this case, people, process, 
technology, and information. Other categories might include mea-
surements, information, policy, equipment, materials, maintenance,

an Ishikawa diagram or cause-and-effect diagram.

data helps teams to truly understand how information, work, and materi-
als flow to the customer to deliver value. The current and future state value 
stream maps are updated throughout the project as facts are gathered and 
comprehension deepens.
Before project execution, the team gathers baseline data for all targets, 
providing a fact-based starting point from which to assess project gains

suppliers, systems, management, regulation, culture, and environ-
ment. Teams begin with a blank diagram showing only the fishbone 
skeleton and the problem, event, or goal. The team then applies 
brainstorming to fill in the diagram. Brainstorming is a problem-
solving approach where a group defines a problem or goal and then 
captures as many ideas as possible around the potential cause or 
solution. The focus is on collecting ideas with no filtering, criticism, 
or evaluation during the brainstorming session. The power of this 
cause-and-effect analysis is that it sets the context for improvement, 
so technology and automation are not the first reaction.

and accurately apply PDCA. Teams often overlook this step in their excite-
ment to begin making improvements. In our experience, discoveries dur-
ing the collection of baseline data lead to a deeper grasp of the current 
situation, a fine-tuning of the measurements to be used, and ultimately the 
development of more effective countermeasures.
Lean encourages the use of SMART targets, an acronym which stands 
for specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-based. For a mea-
surement to be actionable, the team must have the accountability, respon-
sibility, and authority to make improvements. In the Plan phase, during 
the creation of the A3 (or problem statement within a project charter), the 
team develops project metrics and works with the project sponsor to reach 
agreement on SMART targets.
Many process improvement projects do not require the sophisti-
cated measurements or precise statistical analysis offered by Six Sigma. 
However, when projects involve reducing the variation of a process, 
especially high-volume and transactional processes, statistical analysis 
may be appropriate. For example, returning to our hypothetical project 
to improve IT service request response time, statistical analysis could be 
used to assess such factors as the day of the week the request is made, 
or the type of service requested, to determine how strongly each affects 
response time. By ranking the probability* of the correlation between 
the cause and effect of different variables, teams use statistical analysis 
to isolate root causes and prioritize improvements efforts.
Execute
By the time the team has reached the Execution phase, predictions have been 
made, and potential countermeasures have been developed, tested, and priori-
tized. In addition, baseline data have been gathered and measurements are in 
place to objectively assess the impact of the improvements about to be made. 
During implementation, project teams are constantly responding to change and 
making adjustments. What is often missing is a closed-loop feedback discipline 
to assess the impact of actions taken, validate results, and provide the basis for 
future actions. During these phases, Lean project management employs rapid-
cycle micro-PDCA to accelerate problem solving. Ideally, each successive cycle 
is faster and more focused than the last. Figure 9.10 illustrates this relationship.
*	 Six Sigma uses hypothesis testing to determine the probability that the correlation between 
dependent and independent variables is due to random chance.

220  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Monitor and Control
During the Monitor and Control phase of a project, measurement of 
targets against baseline data collected during project planning pro-
vides invaluable feedback with which to make course corrections and 
adjustments. Lean and Six Sigma provide a rich set of measurement 
techniques ranging from simple observation and checklists to advanced 
statistical analyses.*
To effectively monitor and control the impact of unforeseen events and 
planned change, PDCA is applied at a micro level,† making a complete 
cycle within the project execution phase (see Figure 9.3). Figure 9.11 com-
pares proactive PDCA with the informal reactive system we frequently 
encounter.
*	  See Six Sigma Statistics with Excel and MINITAB, by Issa Bass.
†	 Macro-PDCA refers to the entire process of solving a problem, from problem definition through 
implementation and adjustment. Micro-PDCA loops occur within the testing cycle of each pro-
posed countermeasure—the iterative Do-loops within the macro-PDCA cycle.

The left side of the illustration depicts the reactive approach to unfore-
seen events and the impact of unanalyzed change. Without feedback 
and intentional evaluation, the energy of the team is spent responding 
to unanticipated events. These projects experience a self-inflicted chain 
of reactive activity (unplanned work), distracting the team from deliv-
ering value, causing delays, and increasing costs. Project management 
frequently includes a formal assessment of results, but this is often at the 
end of the project. Our experience suggests that the degree to which proj-
ect teams proactively gather feedback and assess the impact of change 
during the project varies greatly. Lean addresses this issue head-on with 
micro-PDCA.
On the right side, proactive Lean execution, measurement, and control 
are shown. Based on the scientific method, the appropriate next step is 
determined by observed feedback. Simply by closing the loop, reflection 
and learning take place. Projects that apply this rigor stay focused, making 
informed adjustments based on the facts.

The final phase of project management hinges on the acceptance of proj-
ect deliverables by the system users, process owners, customers, and other 
stakeholders. A review meeting usually is held to identify lessons learned—

along the way. Process documentation is updated, and project records are 
completed and archived. Often lessons learned are filed away and never seen 
again. Lean uses lessons learned to make adjustments, applying continuous 
improvement to project management practices— standardized work. Some 
organizations utilize knowledge management systems to share lessons 
learned in order to leverage the experience in other projects and situations.
Lean project management goes beyond lessons learned by applying the 
concept of hansei—Japanese for mindfulness or critical self-reflection. 
From an individual perspective, you could say hansei is personal kaizen. 
Hansei cultivates an awareness of your own behavior, reflection on your 
mistakes, and mindfulness of your impact on others. Hansei is being 
honest with yourself about your own limitations and assuming personal 
responsibility to improve. They say there is no kaizen without hansei—you 
must identify your weaknesses before improvements can be made.
In Lean project management, hansei is performed by the team at key 
milestones throughout the project and should also be done frequently on an 
individual basis. In fact, the most effective project managers practice han-
sei every day, continually learning from both their successes and setbacks.
Lean Project Management Enables 
the Lean Enterprise
At its core, the Lean enterprise is a learning organization. Critical self-
reflection cultivates learning. Hansei also emphasizes humility; a Lean 
enterprise is infused with an organizational humility that moves beyond 
defending individual positions and ownership of ideas, serving the greater 
goals of the team, the organization, and its customers.
Lean IT and Lean project management reinforce Lean thinking and 
behavior through the planning and execution of information systems. 
Waste is removed from information flows, supporting efficient value cre-
ation and the unconstrained flow of value to the customer.
Lean project management is an essential component of Lean enterprise 
transformation. Important not only to large projects, it is a mental disci-
pline necessary for small kaizen events as well. For complex, cross-func-
tional, high-risk projects, sound project management is indispensable, but 
it is not enough.

Applying Lean to Project Management  •  223
Think of a challenged or failed project you have experienced or are 
familiar with. Returning to our list of reasons why projects fail (pre-
sented at the beginning of the chapter), ask yourself how many of 
these hazards could have been avoided if the focus was placed first on 
understanding and solving underlying process problems through the 
routine application of A3 thinking, voice of the customer, PDCA, and 
value stream mapping integrated with sound portfolio, program, and 
project management.
Applying the principles and tools of continuous improvement, Lean 
complements the power of conventional project management. Focusing 
on strategically aligned tactics and value creation, project managers and 
teams leverage Lean thinking to generate superior project results on a 
repeatable basis. Lean project management is a capability that should be 
encouraged across all levels of the organization.

Leading the Lean IT Transformation
Chapter Objectives
In this chapter we will examine the nature of transformational Lean lead-
ership, effective management systems, and the information systems that 
support them. We will:
•	 Examine the importance of clear strategic intent in guiding a Lean 
transformation.
•	 Explore the Lean management state of mind.
•	 Establish the importance of leader standard work, and the essential 
Lean management systems from an IT perspective.
•	 Learn how to focus Lean IT change efforts on those factors that drive 
innovation and competitive advantage.
How to Launch a Lean Enterprise Transformation
So your organization has decided to embark on the Lean journey. Or per-
haps someone in your organization has already started. You’ve probably 
heard the stories of enthusiastic change efforts that somehow lost momen-
tum, gradually slipping back into old habits. You want to avoid this com-
mon fate, doing what it takes to achieve escape velocity, launching yourself 
toward a self-sustaining Lean enterprise transformation.

228  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
So what is it you’re escaping from? Like the relentless pull of grav-
ity, there are many sources of inertia that keep organizations firmly 
entrenched in wasteful behaviors: complexity, complacency, command-
and-control management, silo thinking, and conflicting measurements 
and incentives—backsliding into these old habits is a serious threat to a 
Lean transformation.
In our experience, most transformations begin with a focus on Lean 
tools, to establish new behaviors and demonstrate quick results. Small 
teams are given basic training, then concentrate on pilot projects in 
known problem areas. Led by skilled coaches, these energized teams 
harvest low-hanging fruit. They rapidly establish initial momentum, pro-
moting early successes to build the widespread awareness and support 
necessary to expand the effort enterprise-wide. But following this initial 
launch, an organization must follow along with practical, standardized 
management systems to sustain progress, and with shared values, prin-
ciples, and strategic direction to guide continuous, organic, inside-out 
improvement efforts.
Consistent with our own experience, the Shingo Prize finds that orga-
nizations usually begin a Lean transformation at the tools and techniques 
level (the “know how”) in specific areas of the organization. Ideally, the 
Lean journey then proceeds to the systems level, creating a more integrated 
and sustained improvement model. Eventually all employees develop a 
deeper understanding of principles (the “know why”).1 At this point, the 
organization is learning to see waste across entire value streams, as they 
begin adapting Lean to their own culture.
Experience has taught many Lean practitioners that while tools are rela-
tively straightforward to learn and implement, they alone do not sustain 
transformation. While some companies may eagerly claim early victories, 
declaring themselves Lean by demonstrating proficiency with tools and 
heralding localized successes (islands of Lean in a sea of waste), many 
eventually slip back into mediocrity.
Introducing Lean management and information systems requires dis-
cipline, time and reflection. Lean principles are even more difficult to 
embrace, yet they eventually come to influence behavior throughout the 
enterprise. Values and principles must have time to become internalized 
within the unique culture of each organization. Nonetheless, it is difficult 
to begin with values and principles alone, because they are intangible. In 
order to achieve a sufficient escape velocity and trajectory, an organization 

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  229
should launch with a focus on problem-solving tools, then bounce off the 
atmosphere established by successful pilot projects (see Figure 10.1), giving 
the organization time, momentum, and confidence to develop sustaining 
systems and principles.
Strategic Intent
Research consistently shows that in most companies strategic intent is 
not clearly articulated, and this leads to a disconnect between strate-
gic goals and daily activities. The better an organization communicates 
strategy in clear, actionable, and measurable terms, the more success-
fully the Lean transformation can focus on driving change where it mat-
ters most.
There are many perspectives and approaches to strategy, but it all comes 
down to a few simple questions. How does an organization define and

differentiate itself in such a way that customers prefer it over their compet-
itors? What are the activities the organization must engage in to achieve 
this status? And how do they sustain competitive advantage over time, as 
their competitors constantly try to capture market share?
More important, in our opinion, than the details of an organization’s 
strategy at any point in time is how well everyone in the organization 
understands the strategic intent, and how this understanding guides their 
daily thoughts, behaviors, and decisions.
Strategy and strategic intent are very different. Strategy is often defined 
as a specific plan toward a goal, based on a current-state assessment of 
resources and the opportunities to utilize them to greatest advantage. Two 
commonly noted weaknesses of the traditional strategic-planning process 
are that it generally encourages a top-down perspective, and it is usually 
incremental in nature—next year’s strategy is often overly influenced by 
this year’s challenges. In addition, excessively regimented strategic-plan-
ning and budgeting efforts sometimes stifle the very innovation they hope 
to inspire.
On the other hand, strategic intent is about purpose and resourceful-
ness, based on the collective vision and creative potential of the entire 
organization. Strategic intent harnesses the wisdom of the anthill, the 
idea that shared goals lead to decentralized coordination within an 
organization. Shared goals guide daily decisions, where the entire orga-
nization is capable of coherent, systemic activity and self-guided evo-
lution. Strategic intent catalyzes leadership throughout all levels of the 
organization by creating a shared purpose, pursuing objectives that are 
often below or beyond the horizon of the annual planning and budget-
ing cycle.
Strategic intent is fundamentally allied with the cornerstone Lean prin-
ciple described in Chapter 2: constancy of purpose, which often leads toward 
challenging, even seemingly unattainable goals while inspiring teamwork, 
problem solving, and innovation. For example, constancy of purpose 
enabled Toyota, over decades of relentless effort and focus on unbending 
principles and values, to systematically overtake the U.S. auto industry. In 
1961, President John F. Kennedy established constancy of purpose with a 
measurable target: challenge an entire country to land a man on the moon 
and return him safely to earth within the decade, saying, “In a very real 
sense, it will not be one man going to the moon, it will be an entire nation. 
For all of us must work to put him there.”

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  231
Neither of these efforts seemed possible when the strategic intent was 
communicated, nor was there a detailed plan to get there—that too would 
have been impossible and, in fact, would have inhibited the necessary 
process of experimentation, discovery, and learning. But these challenges 
harnessed and guided enormous, sustained, collective resourcefulness 
toward a shared vision, one small experimental step at a time.
In 1989 Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad published the classic Harvard 
Business Review article “Strategic Intent,” where they declared, “Strategic 
intent is like a marathon run in 400-meter sprints, providing consistency 
to short-term action, while leaving room for reinterpretation as new oppor-
tunities emerge.”2 For a learning organization, strategy is a rapidly moving 
target—which is very difficult to compete against. To support this agility, 
every activity of the enterprise should be reinforced through continuous, 
rapid feedback cycles (PDCA) triggering instant, adaptive responses—the 
essence of an enterprise-wide digital nervous system.
Once an organization formulates its purpose, and effectively communi-
cates this as its strategic intent in terms of long- and short-term goals, it 
must then establish measures that assess progress against those goals, sup-
ported by management systems that quickly signal and address deviations. 
While financial measures are important for many reasons, sole reliance 
upon them is not only incomplete but also harmful. Our recommenda-
tion for a comprehensive measurement approach is based on the Balanced 
Scorecard (discussed in Chapter 6) where performance is measured across 
four complementary dimensions: financial, operational, customer satis-
faction, and employee learning and innovation. For an organization to be 
healthy in the long run, these four dimensions must be kept in balance. 
If any one dimension is neglected, it leaves a flank exposed for the com-
petition to exploit. Especially important to strategy, and challenging to 
measure, are the dimensions of customer satisfaction and employee inno-
vation and learning. These are vital to driving continuous improvement, 
since they represent the voices of your customers, and your organization’s 
ability to listen and respond to them appropriately.
To the extent that an organization can define its strategic intent and 
establish effective measurements, it has the necessary foundation to 
standardize strategic execution. Measures become the targets that direct 
improvement and innovation. They guide IT prioritization decisions in 
particular, and strategy deployment in general, across all dimensions of 
the enterprise.

232  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Leadership Is a State of Mind
Effective management systems depend on effective leadership, and con-
stancy of purpose provides the direction which enables everyone to focus 
on a shared goal. The essence of Lean leadership is to cultivate and coach 
people and teams, while developing management processes and informa-
tion systems that shift problem solving and decision making deeper into 
the organization, into the hands of those on the front lines, and closer to 
the customer.
Senior management must initiate the Lean transformation from the top-
down, demonstrating a commitment to the long-term challenges that true 
and lasting change will pose. But once begun, Lean transformation can-
not be effectively controlled from the executive suite, in a top-down fash-
ion. Nor can it be an outside-in process, driven by external consultants. 
Authentic transformation must grow from the inside-out, and leadership 
should be placed into the hands of everyone in the company.
According to Dr. Stephen Covey, true leadership is not something that auto-
matically happens once a person is given a title. “Leadership is a choice, not a 
position,” he counsels. “Leaders who have to borrow their authority from their 
title will not be as effective.”3 Everyone can practice individual leadership.
Effective leaders create positive energy. Rather than focusing on “What’s 
wrong with where we are?” effective leaders start with “What do we do 
well, and what will it take to get where we want to be?” Always begin-
ning with an emphasis on what they do well, a positive-minded solution 
orientation develops openness and involvement, and an atmosphere best 
suited for generating creative solutions.4 This spirit of hansei—humility, 
mindfulness, critical self-reflection, curiosity, and experimentation—
characterizes an authentic Lean enterprise.
In Good to Great, Jim Collins rigorously analyzed the performance of 
1,435 companies, searching for empirical evidence of a sustained com-
pany transformation that far outperformed the competition over 15 years 
or more.* His team discovered many contributing factors to sustained 
greatness, but most surprising was the nature of extraordinary executive 
*	 Collins and his research team began with 1,435 companies that had at some point been among the 
500 largest, going back to 1965. They then searched for companies that made a shift from good to 
great performance—meaning they generated cumulative shareholder returns greater than three 
times the market average over 15 years. They found 11 companies that met these criteria.

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  233
leadership. This was not the high-profile, often overbearing leadership of 
celebrity CEOs; rather, just the opposite—what they described as Level 
Five leadership—was found to exist in all 11 Good to Great companies.
Collins and his team describe a Level Five leader as one who “builds 
enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and 
professional will.” A Level Five leader is characterized as self-reflective, 
modest, and humble—yet extremely determined, with a nearly fanatical 
will to develop the company and his or her own leadership successors. In 
over two-thirds of the not-so-great companies, the chief competitors used 
for the comparisons, Collins and his team found the presence of a “gar-
gantuan personal ego that contributed to the demise or continued medi-
ocrity of the company.”5
These fundamental human characteristics of humility and self-reflec-
tion must be practiced and nurtured, starting at the very top. Senior man-
agement must consistently walk the talk every moment if they are to set an 
example that influences organizational culture in the desired direction. As 
the coauthor of ἀe Machine ἀat Changed the World (the book that origi-
nally popularized the term Lean), James Womack* regularly visits organi-
zations on the Lean journey. What he often finds are the tools of Lean, but 
not the authentic leadership practices.
For example, he often witnesses traditional management decision-mak-
ing behavior from the top-down, going through rituals and applying habit-
ual remedies to unique problems, which are then cut and pasted into A3 
documents and strategy deployment scorecards, creating the appearance 
of disciplined problem-solving behavior and catchball-driven strategic 
alignment. While these deceptions may not be intentional or conscious, 
they demonstrate how traditional patterns of behavior can become deeply 
rooted in our thoughts and actions.
Womack describes four essential Lean management states of mind that 
must be cultivated for an authentic transformation:
	
1.	The Lean manager eagerly embraces the role of problem solver.
	
2.	The Lean manager realizes that no manager at a higher level can or 
should solve a problem at a lower level—problems can only be solved 
where they live, by those living with them.
*	 James Womack is founder of the Lean Enterprise Institute (LEI), a nonprofit education, publish-
ing, and research organization dedicated to the promotion of Lean thinking worldwide (see www.
Lean.org).

234  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
	
3.	The Lean manager believes that all problem solving is about experi-
mentation by means of Plan-Do-Check-Act.
	
4.	The Lean manager knows that no problem is ever solved forever. 
Indeed, the introduction of a promising countermeasure is sure to 
create new problems at some other point in the organization. This is 
not bad. It is good, provided the critical, probing mind of the Lean 
manager keeps on the case in pursuit of perfection.6
The Lean manager bestows both problem-solving and many decision-
making responsibilities where they belong, closest to the work and the 
customer. At its core, Lean leadership and transformation are thus more 
of a social than a technical process. But beyond this essential leadership 
state of mind, there must be standard work in the form of management 
systems that effectively link goal-setting and decision-making processes, 
with no wasted time, effort, and resources. And we all know how much 
waste plagues the typical management system.
The Importance of Effective 
Management Systems
According to Kaplan and Norton, originators of the balanced scorecard, a 
management system is defined as “the integrated set of processes and tools 
that a company uses to develop its strategy, translate it into operational 
actions, and monitor and improve the effectiveness of both.” They sug-
gest that “breakdowns in a company’s management system, not managers’ 
lack of ability or effort, are what cause a company’s underperformance.”7 
In their Harvard Business Review article “Mastering the Management 
System,” Kaplan and Norton explore elements of an effective management 
system. They explain that successful strategy execution has two basic rules: 
understand the management cycle that links strategy and operations, and 
know what tools to apply at each stage of the cycle. This points to several 
themes familiar to Lean practitioners: cadence, flow, and leader standard 
work.
The cadence of a management system facilitates the smooth flow of deci-
sion making and should match the pace of change in the organization. 

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  235
While some industries are naturally faster moving and more dynamic 
than others, the pace of change has increased for all; today no organization 
is immune to sudden disruption, threats, and opportunities. Thus a Lean 
enterprise relies on the management system’s ability to match decision-
making cadence to the tempo of the market, and of its customers, quickly 
responding to unanticipated events—ideally driving change rather than 
reacting to it. Short cycles of collaboration, problem solving, and decision 
making (PDCA) promote rapid learning and agility.
In our view, there are five essential management systems that guide the 
Lean enterprise transformation: strategy deployment, demand manage-
ment, business process management, and project/program/portfolio man-
agement, all coordinated by sound governance practices.* As you might 
expect, information, information systems, and the IT organization play a 
vital role in their performance.
Strategy Deployment
As we explored in Chapter 6, strategy deployment encourages a holistic 
focus across all dimensions of the organization (the Lean principle of sys-
tems thinking), acting as a compass to align daily activity with strategy. 
Through rapidly iterative goal-setting and review cycles, the catchball 
process encourages proactive two-way communication, rapid fact-based 
learning, and agility. From an organic perspective, strategy deployment 
acts as the organization’s distributed nervous system, continuously scan-
ning the environment for exceptions, problems, threats, and opportuni-
ties. (Figure 10.2)
Strategy deployment may first be established enterprise-wide, starting 
with an articulation of strategic intent and strategic objectives, commu-
nicated throughout the dimensions of the organization as measurable 
targets. On the other hand, progressive IT leaders may first introduce 
strategy deployment from within the IT organization, encouraging its 
integration with other functions of the enterprise over time. In this lat-
ter case, senior IT management must make a special effort to determine 
the strategic intent and goals of the enterprise, and how the IT organi-
zation best serves them—a necessary dialogue in any case.
*	 There are clearly many more management systems required to run a business, but we are focusing 
on those which are central to enabling and sustaining the Lean transformation.

236  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Demand Management
As we explored in Chapter 5, every value stream should engage stakehold-
ers to continuously level demand and balance capacity. The cadence of this 
balancing act should be synchronized with the delivery cycles of the par-
ticular industry, but generally the demand management process occurs on 
a standard monthly cycle. While demand management originally evolved 
in supply chain industries (as sales and operations planning [S&OP]), the 
fundamentals are now being successfully applied across many industries. 
After all, what organization does not need to balance demand from cus-
tomers with their capacity to deliver?
When a disciplined demand management collaboration process takes 
hold, value stream flow is stabilized (mura reduced) and resource over-
load is avoided (muri reduced). Under these conditions, departments and 
teams experience a reasonable workload, so they can focus on the devel-
opment of people and on the design of work processes that flow smoothly 
without interruption (muda reduced). Once the discipline and cadence 
of demand management become routine, organizations can identify and 
respond to changes quickly with limited disruption to operations, suppli-
ers, and customers.
As Lean practitioners learned in the manufacturing world decades ago, 
just-in-time delivery can only be sustained when demand is reasonably

level, without frequent spikes and unplanned disruptions. For this rea-
son, demand management plays a key role, actively engaging with the cus-
tomers of the IT organization to identify and prioritize requirements. By 
minimizing schedule changes so the rate of demand is level (smooth over 
time, matching the capacity and pace of delivery), the backlog is kept at 
a manageable size and delivery of IT services and projects can be rapid, 
responsive, and continuous.
Business Process Management
As we explored in Chapter 4, business process management (BPM) treats 
enterprise processes as vital, intangible corporate assets that embody the 
competitive advantage and intellectual property of the enterprise. A clear 
and relatively uncomplicated logical model of enterprise processes, inter-
relationships, ownership, and measurements helps to establish a necessary 
foundation for prioritization of improvement opportunities so that enter-
prise resources may be utilized to their greatest advantage. Put another 
way, until an organization can describe its portfolio of business processes, 
explain their strengths and weaknesses, and assess their relative impact 
on achieving strategic goals, there is little basis for fact-based prioritiza-
tion regarding their improvement.
In many organizations, simply identifying the portfolio of processes can 
be difficult, since so many regular activities consist of undocumented prac-
tices, tribal knowledge, and habitual behavior, rather than documented stan-
dard work. On top of this, many organizations learn that the most difficult 
part of BPM is not identifying their processes, but determining who owns 
them and what their targets and relative priorities should be. Applying a for-
malized BPM approach* (accompanied by value stream mapping, problem-
solving tools, and clearly defined process ownership) provides a foundation 
that promotes understanding and consensus, leading to sound prioritiza-
tion and decision making. In fact, we can argue that until the enterprise 
process portfolio is defined, the linkages of the strategy deployment process, 
where strategic goals are associated with processes and their targets, are not 
clearly understood (more on this later in the governance section).
*	 As we discussed in Chapter 4, in many cases this should not require a significant investment in 
sophisticated BPM software; focus first on developing a simple, manageable approach to catalogu-
ing your processes.

238  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
The IT organization often plays the natural role of process leaders and 
architects, providing oversight and guidance to enterprise-wide business 
process management. But business stakeholders must play the role of 
process owners, with accountability, responsibility, and authority for the 
continuous improvement and innovation of each value stream and sup-
porting process.
Project, Program, and Portfolio Management
As we explored in Chapter 9, sound project, program, and portfolio man-
agement discipline and practice are essential throughout the enterprise, 
not only to large-scale efforts, but also on the smaller kaizen activities. 
Teams should constantly practice A3 thinking in order to understand and 
address root causes of problems, rather than jumping to solutions and 
focusing on potentially non-value-adding deliverables.
Governance
We are introducing this overarching management system here for the first 
time and will do so only briefly. Governance is a troubling word to some, 
evoking visions of regulation, bureaucracy, endless delays, and unneces-
sary complexity. As a result of many recent corporate scandals, though, 
corporate behavior is now under close public scrutiny. Beyond its ethical 
and regulatory implications, good governance practices are necessary to 
ensure that decisions are made in a consistent and high-quality manner. 
Governance is “the collective set of procedures, policies, roles and respon-
sibilities, and organizational structures required to support an effective 
decision-making process.”8 Every organization practices governance, 
whether formally or informally, transparently or mysteriously.
From the perspective of process improvement, good governance sup-
ports a process where accurate information about the cost, risk, and ben-
efits of each proposed initiative is made available, so they can be weighed 
against the needs of other initiatives and operations competing for the 
same limited resources. Effective governance is essential for a Lean enter-
prise to function, providing transparency so all stakeholders have con-
fidence in the decision-making processes that guide the enterprise. This 
does not mean that stakeholders will always agree on every decision, but 
if they believe the decisions are approached thoroughly and fairly, with an 

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  239
opportunity for all parties to express a concern or suggest an alternative, 
then the likelihood of consensus and support is far greater. And remem-
ber, consensus is not unanimous agreement, but general agreement where 
dissenting opinions are respected (the Lean principle of respect for people) 
and where all team members agree to support the decision of the group 
through each PDCA learning cycle.
Leadership must walk a fine line, establishing sufficient governance to 
ensure thorough evaluation of initiatives, but with clear and simple deci-
sion-making rules and processes, so when the time comes for a decision 
to be made, it is done with clarity and confidence. In ἀe Toyota Way, 
Jeffrey Liker describes the effective decision-making discipline of a Lean 
enterprise: “Make decisions slowly by consensus, thoroughly considering 
all options; implement decisions rapidly.”9
According to Peter Weill and Jeanne Ross in IT Governance, corporate 
governance regulates decision-making processes for six interdependent 
enterprise assets: human, financial, physical, intellectual property, IT, and 
relationships.10 In a symbiotic relationship, IT governance is thus subordi-
nate to corporate governance, yet at the same time IT governance (and the 
information and information systems managed by the IT organization) 
supports a properly functioning corporate governance process.
When corporate and IT governance are working properly, a frame-
work is created for assigning decision rights, establishing formal respon-
sibility and accountability for determining how scarce IT resources are 
allocated to operations, projects, and continuous improvement activi-
ties. Governance prevents the IT organization (as well as other func-
tional areas) from independently making and later being held solely 
responsible for decisions, while at the same time ensuring that business 
stakeholders assume their responsibility to participate in making good 
IT decisions. To be effective, the governance process requires prioritized 
direction (strategy deployment), defined interdependencies (business 
process management), and the management of operational constraints 
(demand management) in order to make informed decisions on the allo-
cation of scarce resources.
In addition, governance requires effective project, program, and port-
folio management for planning and execution. The Project Management 
Office (PMO) is a common element of corporate and IT governance, where 
the Project Management Center of Excellence (CoE), the Lean CoE, senior 
management, and stakeholders from the business and IT organizations 

240  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
come together regularly to make such resource allocation decisions, and 
in general manage the IT and other enterprise priorities including kaizen* 
and project portfolios.
As we explored in Chapter 9, centers of excellence are not part of the 
management hierarchy, but are a shared service providing enterprise-wide 
competency and support in specialized disciplines. Smaller organizations 
may not maintain permanently staffed Center of Excellence support orga-
nizations; in this case, the functions of a CoE in various domains (such as 
Lean, project management, compliance, and safety) should be provided 
through internal subject matter experts, ideally with a formal role and 
time allocation. Even the smallest companies will benefit from disciplined 
practice and standard work in these important areas of enterprise com-
petency, creating an environment of consistency and stability where con-
tinuous improvement and innovation may thrive.
Many large organizations, on the other hand, already have established 
CoEs and disciplined governance processes in place. But as we explored in 
Chapter 4, the nature of many of these governance processes is compliance 
oriented, attempting to inspect quality and compliance into the processes 
by monitoring outcomes, thus often contributing more waste than value. 
These organizations should apply Lean thinking to support the continu-
ous improvement of their existing governance processes, and the activities 
they monitor and control, which leads to greater overall compliance as a 
natural outcome. The emphasis shifts from process outcome inspection 
and correction to process improvement, adding long-term value.
The Three Levels of a Lean Management System
The management systems just described (as well as others commonly found 
within the Lean enterprise) must work together, with information, human 
interactions, and decisions flowing at a stable and sustainable cadence. But 
considering the many dimensions of the typical enterprise, and the many 
interactions and motivations of the stakeholders, the overall management 
*	 The degree to which kaizen activity requires governance relies on its scale (system, process, or 
daily—see Chapter 2), scope (the amount of shared resources and cross-functional coordination 
required), risk, and resource requirements.

Leading the Lean IT Transformation  •  241
system framework can easily become overly complex and unwieldy, creat-
ing waste that hinders the effectiveness of the Lean enterprise we’re trying 
to create. For a Lean management system framework to be effective, it 
must be simple to understand and execute, providing structure and guid-
ance while not unnecessarily slowing progress. It cannot be too control-
ling or rigid; otherwise, it will suppress creativity and learning, hindering 
continuous improvement and innovation.
Considering the sophisticated and enticing information systems that are 
now available to automate the various management systems and processes 
of a modern, global enterprise, it’s no wonder that many find themselves 
mired in information systems complexity. In our opinion, the quest for a 
completely unified and integrated enterprise-wide management informa-
tion system composed of interlocking scorecards, dashboards, analyses, 
and other decision support tools is impractical. Such a 100-percent solu-
tion would by definition be too complex, inflexible, unmanageable, and 
certainly not Lean. Employees shouldn’t need a Harvard MBA to under-
stand how their management systems work. There is a historical precedent 
here: overzealous attempts to improve factory performance with material 
requirements planning (MRP), introducing sophisticated push schedul-
ing and process control techniques, gave rise to more waste, confusion, 
and resistance to change, not less. Our recommendation is to strive for 
simple visual management, supported by an 80-percent software solution 
that is solid and adaptable, and let human collaboration, communication, 
creativity, and rapid adaptive learning cycles do the rest.
Thus the nature of Lean management systems, and the information and 
information systems that support them, must be based on simple rules, 
practiced consistently with minimal waste and at a sustainable, rapid, 
iterative cadence. In fact, some of the most effective Lean management 
systems we’ve seen don’t employ computers at the level of daily work, but 
rely on frequent management gemba walks. While at the gemba, main-
taining a focus on visual process measures and visiting teams where the 
work is done, Lean managers help to identify, solve, and ultimately prevent 
problems. Thus proactive process monitoring reduces a dreaded cause of 
waste—postmortem meetings where people gather to try and figure out 
what went wrong some time ago, and how to repair the damage that has 
been done.
Many managers resist the idea of structured leader standard work in 
their daily behavior and management systems, believing that it diminishes 

242  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
their flexibility and authority. But in our experience, once managers truly 
assimilate Lean thinking into their daily practice, they realize that leader 
standard work creates stability while improving flexibility, quality, and 
performance. The effectiveness of leader standard work has been demon-
strated in many industries where structure, authority, and agility go hand 
in hand, including airlines, law enforcement, and health care.
More than just providing necessary data for these management sys-
tems to operate across all enterprise levels and dimensions (particularly 
in matrixed organizations), properly designed information systems enable 
management system processes to flow smoothly. Like any other process, 
teams should value stream map management system processes, identifying 
workflow and information waste, and looking for ways to apply simple and 
effective manual, visual, verbal, and electronic information systems.
But more important than the supporting information systems, an effec-
tive Lean management system requires simple, clear roles and responsi-
bilities across all levels of activity, to avoid unnecessary complexity and to 
help the value flow (Figure 10.3):
Executives:
•	 Set and communicate direction (strategy)
•	 Guide direction (strategy deployment catchball, system kaizen (kai-
kaku) to drive breakthrough change)
•	 Enable value stream flow: reducing unevenness and variation (mura) 
and overburden (muri)
•	 Lead (as if they have no authority) and inspire others to lead with 
them
•	 Go see and ask why
•	 Actively engage in continuous improvement through the practice 
of leader standard work supported by a regular monthly cadence of 
PDCA
•	 Improve the work and improve themselves
Managers:
•	 Establish basic stability: level demand matched with capacity across 
value streams
•	 Communicate strategic direction, align with daily work and process 
improvement (strategy deployment catchball)
•	 Go see and ask why

Integrating Lean IT
It is not enough to just do your best or work hard. You must know what to 
work on.
—Dr. W. Edwards Deming
Across many industries, billions of dollars are spent each year on IT invest-
ments that do not add value or offer differentiation to the customer. What 
actions can IT leadership take to redirect funding and focus from these 
routine and wasteful activities toward enabling innovation and competi-
tive advantage?
To address this question, in 2007 the IT Process Institute* conducted a 
survey, illustrating the degree of IT strategic integration in quantitative 
terms. Their methodology identified three IT archetypes:
•	 Utility providers: They provide primary shared services and infra-
structure to support basic information management applications.
*	 See www.itpi.org; this research was built upon earlier research conducted by Forrester Research 
and McKinsey.

•	 Process optimizers: In addition to the single emphasis of utility pro-
viders, process optimizers also focus on enabling business unit–spe-
cific objectives via applications that optimize key business functions 
and processes.
•	 Revenue enablers: In addition to the dual emphasis of process opti-
mizers, revenue enablers also focus on technology to enable unique 
products and services that capture greater market share and enter 
new markets.
Among its many insightful discoveries, the survey shows (Figure 10.4) 
that revenue-enabling IT organizations consistently allocated spending 
equally among these three areas of emphasis: utility 34 percent, optimiz-
ing 33 percent, and enabling 33 percent. Thus, to effectively operate the 
IT organization as a revenue enabler, the focus, and the competencies it 
develops, should be balanced across these three dimensions. As the fig-
ure suggests, by pursuing operational excellence of utility services (waste 
reduction) effort and investment can be redirected to revenue-enabling 
activities. According to the survey, “The proven practices for this group 
paint a picture that indicates tight integration of IT with the business.”12
The results also indicate that revenue enabler organizations have the high-
est spending on new projects (43 percent, compared to 33 percent for pro-
cess optimizers and 27 percent for utility providers). Revenue enablers also 
have a strong track record for rejecting bad projects. These two facts taken

together suggest agility, complemented by a clear focus on business priori-
ties, where the IT organization is quick to deploy new projects when the 
customer requests them and is also quick to terminate a project if necessary. 
The key to such agility (as we explored in Chapter 9) is to keep these projects 
small in scope and short in duration, so start-stop decisions can be made 
quickly without causing unnecessary cost, risk, or business disruption.
The results also illustrate the differences in strategic focus, governance, 
and budgetary control among these three archetypes. IT organizations 
that act as revenue enablers have less control over their own spending:* 
only 57 percent for revenue enablers, compared with 66 percent for pro-
cess optimizers and 70 percent for utility providers. This clearly indi-
cates tighter integration and stronger collaboration of revenue enablers, 
since the business shares strategic prioritization and investment deci-
sions with IT.
As the IT organization evolves from segregation, through alignment, toward 
full integration, the business naturally gains an increasing degree of control 
over the IT operational budget. This is because more decisions are made by 
business and IT together, toward shared strategic intent and objectives. Beyond 
the mechanics of moving more budgetary control from the IT organization to 
the process owner, there is a fundamental shift in thinking that must occur. 
IT should be responsible for managing its capacity and efficient delivery of 
functionality (operational excellence), while business units and process own-
ers should be responsible for the ultimate success of each project—including 
IT-based improvements and automation of the business process.
When the business assumes ownership of technology-based business 
process improvement outcomes, a collaborative alliance ensues and the 
likelihood of project success is significantly increased. IT projects are thus 
conceived, approved, and funded based on shared strategic objectives—
ensuring that constancy of purpose is translated into aligned action.
This indicates a tightly coupled relationship where IT plays two roles in 
relation to the business: supplier and advisor. On the supply side, demand is 
collaboratively managed, budgeted, and prioritized across business units, 
processes, and projects; then it is balanced against available capacity to 
ensure optimal results for the enterprise as a whole. And as a trusted advi-
sor, IT plays an essential role in business strategic planning and budgeting 
*	 Measured as the percentage of IT budget under the direct control of IT governance versus general 
corporate governance.

decisions throughout the organization. In this way, the business can apply 
systems thinking to all decisions (supported by A3 thinking, of course) 
and take advantage of every opportunity to utilize quality information 
and effective information systems to create value and stay ahead of the 
competition—or even change the game completely.
Based on the survey results, the authors make several recommenda-
tions for IT organizations desiring to achieve this exalted state of strategic 
integration and enablement, and these recommendations clearly resonate 
with the message of this book:
•	 Shift the CIO role toward greater participation in setting enterprise- 
and business unit–level strategy, goals and objectives.
•	 Train all IT personnel on business objectives, so they develop a vis-
ceral understanding of IT’s contribution to competitive positioning 
and value delivery.
•	 Matrix IT resources into business units.
•	 Involve business stakeholders with IT planning and strategy.
•	 Integrate the IT budget process with the business unit and enterprise 
budget cycle.
•	 Match the pace of IT and business change; revenue enablers must 
shift the IT change paradigm to a velocity-based model.
•	 Utilize a portfolio management approach to invest in IT initiatives that 
balance the spending mix across the three areas of focus: utility and 
shared service, process optimization, and new revenue contribution.
•	 Formalize a process for assessing the changing needs of the business, 
and proactively responding to them.
This last recommendation bears close examination, since it suggests a 
broad goal that IT organizations have been pursuing, often with disap-
pointing results, for years. This points to the value that Lean IT offers 
as an enabler, and often a driver, of customer-value focused continuous 
improvement and innovation throughout the enterprise. So, finally, let’s 
turn our attention to how we make Lean IT happen.

A Lean IT Roadmap
Every organization—not just business—needs one core competence: 
innovation.
—Peter Drucker
People Lead Lean IT Change
The Lean journey must begin with people. After all, people are far more 
creative, adaptable, and agile than computers will ever be. Lean think-
ing channels individual strength and collective diversity into continu-
ous improvement and innovation through shared values, behaviors, and 
management systems—in a word, culture. Organizations that learn how to 
harness the creative potential of their employees can transcend from good 
to sustained greatness over time.
As Figure 11.1 illustrates, three essential elements—people, process, and 
technology—must be kept in balance. While no single element should be 
allowed to become dominant or weak, people must lead the way through 
the transformation. The bottom line is this: the success of Lean IT, and the 
future of a sustainable Lean enterprise, relies upon people, process, and 
technology, in that order.
In the landmark 1996 book Leading Change, John Kotter set the tone 
for contemporary thinking on organizational change. He stressed that 
most corporate change efforts achieve only modest results, while many 
fail miserably. Kotter cites the natural human tendency to move too

quickly, impatiently accelerating change in order to achieve rapid results: 
“The change process goes through a series of phases that, in total, usually 
require a considerable length of time. Skipping steps creates only the illu-
sion of speed and never produces a satisfying result.”2 This is consistent 
with the Lean maxim: in order to speed up you must slow down. Kotter 
proposes a simple eight-step sequence; Figure 11.2 uses this approach to 
suggest steps that leaders should (and should not) take toward a successful 
Lean IT transformation.
We have applied the timeless wisdom contained in Kotter’s stages 
countless times in our own practice, as have many other Lean leaders 
we have met along the way. This approach addresses the subtle forces 
of human nature that are critical to lasting change. While this is an 
indispensible list, providing general rules for the road, alone it is not 
enough. A working roadmap needs more specifics to navigate a success-
ful transformation.

Change Stage
IT Leadership Should:
IT Leadership Should Not:
1. Establish a sense of urgency  
Help everyone understand that the Lean Enterprise cannot afford a non-Lean IT 
organization, and the key to IT alignment and agility is Lean Thinking
Underestimate the strength of peoples’ comfort zones, and their fear of 
losing control or self-worth. This is especially important with technical 
specialists. Kotter notes that over 50% of companies fail on this 
essential first step. 
2. Form a powerful guiding coalition  
Educate and communicate with all managers, key stakeholders and subject matter 
experts, ensure you have critical mass to succeed, and address all concerns. 
Cultivate emerging leaders outside the existing management hierarchy.
Stop communicating vigorously as the Lean transformation picks up 
momentum, thinking that everyone understands what you’re talking 
about and why it’s important.
3. Create a vision  
Get beyond the tactical and emphasize strategic value to the business. Develop a 
complete roadmap for the transformation, clearly articulate everyone’s role and 
contribution, explain that it will be difficult but attainable. As Dr. Stephen Covey 
says, “begin with the end in mind.”
Make the vision too complicated, seemingly impractical, impossible or 
unlikely to succeed. 
4. Communicate  the vision  
Communicate often and through multiple channels, promote success stories, openly 
share lessons learned. Celebrate failures as well as successes to eliminate fear and 
encourage PDCA. 
Undercommunicate, practice old habits of top-down management, 
communication behavior that sends the wrong message about change.
5. Empower others to act on the vision  Remove barriers, encourage and recognize creativity and innovation, cultivate 
holistic value stream thinking over localized measures and incentives. 
Allow strong willed managers, organization structures, policies, 
incentives, and entrenched habits to undermine change.
6. Plan for and create short-term wins  
Start with pilot projects that are important, but not your biggest challenges.  
Under-invest in the factors that will ensure these initial efforts are 
successful: education on principles, training on tools, coaching, teams, 
measures.
7. Consolidate improvements and 
produce  more change  
Celebrate and promote initial successes, develop culture, principles, infrastructure, 
and management systems that standardize and sustain the transformation. 
Declare victory too soon; the higher you climb, the harder the wind 
blows. Just when a transformation seems to be taking hold, the 
problems become tougher and entrenched resistance can become 
stronger. 
8. Institutionalize new approaches  
Apply A3 Thinking and PDCA to daily work and decision-making. Develop future 
leaders that think and act Lean. Emphasize business and IT partnership in all 
management systems and improvement projects. 
Give up or let down your guard. Problems are clever, old habits die 
slowly. Lean is not a project, or a program, it’s a new way of thinking 
that doesn’t go away.

How to Start the Lean IT Transformation
Over the past two decades, a variety of models (including ISO, CMM, and 
ITIL) have aimed to improve performance of the business and the sup-
porting information and information systems. Some of these efforts have 
produced significant, though usually localized, results. In most cases, 
however, these well-intentioned efforts, based on best practice models 
and methodologies, have not delivered sustained, enterprise-wide impact. 
Why not?
Because a lasting transformation isn’t just controlled from the top-down 
by following a best practices model or methodology, it must grow from 
the inside-out. A Lean enterprise is agile and adaptable; every individual 
and team throughout the organization possess situational fluency, quickly 
and naturally responding to changing circumstances with effective prob-
lem solving and decision making. Every solution, to be effective, must be 
unique in the sense that it is experienced, discovered and owned by the 
teams, who share their different perspectives on the problem and eventu-
ally develop a common understanding and goals.
Harmony cannot be imposed from the outside. In order to overcome the 
traditional separation of IT and the business and achieve integration, they 
must begin working closely together on critical business processes. This 
effort is a two-way street: business must take an active interest in infor-
mation and information systems, and IT must learn to see information 
waste and value, frequently going to gemba—listening to the customer, 
and experiencing the business process firsthand. This working partner-
ship is a catalyst for enterprise transformation.
So how does an organization deliberately achieve an inside-out trans-
formation? There are countless books that will describe in detail what a 
Lean enterprise should look like: the thinking processes it should embrace, 
the tools it should use, and the management style and systems it should 
adopt. But despite all these encouraging prescriptions, the transforma-
tion process itself is very difficult to carry out, and even more difficult to 
sustain. In the end, there is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all prescriptive 
approach to Lean transformation; it is a fine balance between social and 
technical, between process and practice, and of repeatable behavior, expe-
riential learning, and continuous adaptation and innovation. Every situ-
ation is different. The idiosyncrasies of people, organizations, customers, 

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  253
and circumstances ensure that what worked last time, in the last organi-
zation, with the last team, on the last problem, very likely will not work 
with the next.
For example, representatives of the aerospace industry were attending a 
workshop on supply chain integration, a vital element of success in their 
industry. Speaking to the group was Hajime Ohba, general manager of 
the Toyota Supplier Support Center. After persistent questioning from 
the group, which was searching for a prescriptive set of instructions or a 
checklist approach to guide them, Ohba finally stressed, “Lean is a way of 
thinking, not a list of things to do.”3 He insisted that first he would have 
to go to gemba and meet with each supplier to understand its own pro-
cesses, strengths, and weaknesses before he could suggest a specific course 
of action.
In the end, strict adherence to an overly structured model or implemen-
tation approach alone is certainly not sufficient (and is usually counterpro-
ductive) to a lasting transformation. This, in our opinion, is why so many 
model-based efforts to transform and align IT have been disappointing, 
since the change was prescribed from without, rather than evolving from 
within. This is why Lean thinking does not impose a prescriptive approach, 
but instead offers guidance through structured experiential learning and 
shared leadership, founded upon timeless, universal principles.
Nevertheless, those seeking a transformation need a general course to 
follow, a roadmap for change charted by those who have gone before, so 
they can learn from their successes and, hopefully, avoid repeating com-
mon mistakes.
Lean IT Transformation Roadmap
In this final section we outline an approach to help you transform your 
organization into a Lean enterprise, enabled by Lean IT. While this road-
map will not tell you every turn to make, it will suggest a general direction 
in which to travel and signposts to look for along the way.
So what makes a good roadmap? Foremost, it should provide general 
guidelines, while allowing autonomy and flexibility for teams and individ-
uals to adapt to each situation—what Tom Peters and Robert Waterman in 
In Search of Excellence describe as loose-tight:

254  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
Autonomy is a product of discipline. The discipline (a few shared values) pro-
vides the framework. It gives people confidence (to experiment, for instance) 
stemming from stable expectations about what really counts. Too much 
overbearing discipline of the wrong kind will kill autonomy. The “rules”* 
in excellent companies have a positive cast. They deal with quality, service, 
innovation, and experimentation. Their focus is on building, expanding, the 
opposite of restraining.4
Teams should be able to easily understand the intent of the roadmap, 
quickly making adjustments in response to new facts and circumstances. 
The roadmap must also adapt to an irregular pace and imbalanced accep-
tance, since some elements of the organization are usually faster than 
others to adopt Lean thinking and change their behavior. The three trans-
formation stages of strategy, planning, and execution are thus not entirely 
sequential, but cyclical, continuously feeding back into each other as itera-
tive PDCA loops, signaling slight course corrections with each new exper-
iment and learning cycle.
Finally, a Lean IT transformation roadmap cannot be separated from 
the overall Lean enterprise transformation plan that it supports. Business 
and IT must take this journey together, and an effective roadmap must 
reflect this. Figure 11.3 illustrates our recommended roadmap, based on 
over 15 years of applying Lean thinking to information systems and enter-
prise change management.
Strategy
Establish Leadership Vision and Consensus
This effort is usually driven by an executive champion, who initially 
establishes a sense of urgency; often called the burning platform, this is a 
compelling argument that the organization cannot afford not to change 
in a fundamental way. Consensus is needed on underlying values and 
principles that will never change. Build on existing beliefs within the 
enterprise when possible—if too many new principles and values are 
suddenly introduced, it may cause the existing culture to reject them as 
*	 In this case, the “rules” are Lean management systems supported by leader standard work.

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  255
contrived or disingenuous, just another flavor of the month. Where pos-
sible, seek to establish and constantly reinforce those timeless Lean prin-
ciples described in Chapter 2. Senior management should form a Lean 
transformation steering team representing executive stakeholders from 
across the enterprise, including strong IT leadership involvement. We 
also advise that IT leadership form their own Lean transformation steer-
ing team, to oversee the IT organization’s transformation and ensure its 
integration with the overall enterprise transformation effort. This is espe-
cially critical if the business has been on the Lean journey for some time, 
and IT is just starting.
Develop within the management team a clear understanding of the 
importance of a Lean management system, and leader standard work, par-
ticularly repeatable behavior, accountability, and cadence. Coach mem-
bers of the management team, since invariably some will more readily

change their behaviors than others. While some managers may delay as 
they assess the Lean approach, others (let’s be honest) may be consciously 
or unconsciously resistant to change. One careless senior management 
intervention opposing the new direction can seriously damage or even 
derail a transformation. This initial groundwork embodies Kotter’s essen-
tial first step, creating a sense of urgency, and begins the process for step 
2, the formation of a guiding coalition. But the coalition shouldn’t end 
with senior management; it must also enlist all managers, subject matter 
experts, and thought leaders throughout the organization—more on this 
in a later step.
Articulate Strategic Intent and Drivers
Senior management must clearly articulate the strategic intent and drivers 
(through strategy deployment), so stakeholders can focus Lean transforma-
tion activities on those issues that will most affect outcomes. IT leadership 
must actively engage in this process so the enterprise can leverage IT vision 
and capabilities to their fullest. A word of caution here: in some cases, man-
agement may think they know what activities will drive the intended out-
comes, but later discover they are mistaken. Often it’s not until teams start 
critically assessing core value streams (using A3 thinking and value stream 
mapping) that they will begin to clearly understand and quantify the underly-
ing causal relationships hidden beneath layers of unchallenged assumptions. 
Management’s role here is to articulate and constantly reinforce strategic 
intent, ensuring that teams understand what they’re trying to accomplish 
and why. Management should not define the how—that is the work of the 
associates who must inevitably drive and own the transformation. 
Planning
Define and Communicate the Transformation Plan
First, a plan must be developed that identifies targets, and the timing and 
sequence of activities, while anticipating resource constraints and inter-
dependencies. Although we earlier stressed that an overly prescriptive 
or rigid framework is inappropriate, nevertheless a plan is necessary to 

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  257
communicate objectives and direct the effort. This plan should be devel-
oped under the guidance of the steering team to ensure executive sup-
port, developing a visceral realization of the breadth, magnitude, and 
duration of the undertaking. There must be buy-in from the top-down, 
with clear communication, consistent and supportive action, and focused 
measurement.
Sequence is important: senior management, middle management, and 
then associates must understand what is about to happen and why. Goals 
IT’s Stop-Doing List
Lean IT transformation takes time, so it’s important to show some 
early successes to gain support and gather momentum. It’s also neces-
sary to free up time to accelerate the change, since an enterprise can’t 
suspend daily operations just to make time for Lean. We’ve never 
encountered a client that had extra time in its schedule, so clearly 
something must give way. Here we borrow from Good to Great5 the 
simple idea of a stop-doing list, to help you free up wasteful time and 
energy to focus on launching your transformation.
Let’s start with an assumption: just suppose that at least 20 percent 
of the current IT projects, either underway or planned to start soon, 
are wasteful from a Lean perspective. The key is for IT and business 
stakeholders to quickly find these and stop doing them right away. 
(Of course, if the project is wasteful but necessary to temporarily fix 
a broken mission-critical process, then you may have no choice but 
to keep doing it for now.) Our advice is to immediately reevaluate 
every current project in your portfolio so that purpose and desired 
outcomes are clear and measurable, and investment is focused on 
projects that drive real value. And with the application of A3 think-
ing, ensure that each investment is focused on root causes, rather 
than mitigating symptoms with quick technology fixes while accu-
mulating a growing burden of technical debt. Set yourself a goal of 
eliminating at least 20 percent of these projects, which should free up 
enough time, resources, and mindshare to invest in your initial Lean 
efforts. This bold step will also send a clear message to all business 
stakeholders that sound root cause analysis and justification (A3 
thinking) will be required for all new project proposals.

258  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
must be clear so people are motivated by strategic intent and shared pur-
pose rather than just the need to follow management dictates.
Create a high-level visual roadmap showing the steps of the transfor-
mation, and how they engage the various parts of the organization over 
time. Don’t over-promise and under-deliver; rather, position the plan as 
a significant and thoughtful investment based on long-term thinking. 
Set expectations that an authentic transformation of behavior and cul-
ture takes time, discipline, and persistence. It is especially important that 
managers help their employees make an explicit commitment of time to 
continuous improvement.
Keep the message simple, visual, and memorable. Reinforce the vision 
and the reason for change. People must understand value and waste at a 
gut level, if they are to overcome years of organizational inertia and pro-
cess scar tissue. Answer the questions that are on everyone’s mind: “Why 
are we doing this?” “How will things be different?” “What challenges do 
we anticipate?” and “What’s in it for me?”
One of the most common failures when leading change is to under-
communicate. Update the plan periodically, regularly sharing progress 
through town hall meetings and other company communications. Senior 
management needs to take this out on the road and personally deliver 
the message to everyone, don’t delegate this essential message across the 
layers of middle management. Show everyone where the organization is, 
where it’s going, and the role each individual plays, so they can plan for 
the effort alongside their regular operating responsibilities. Be creative to 
catch people’s attention, and keep their interest and curiosity.
Build a Lean Leadership Team
Identify change agents that will become your first wave of Lean leaders, 
the core of your Lean Center of Excellence. Make sure IT associates are 
well represented here. Look everywhere, since transformational leaders 
are often found outside the formal management hierarchy. Invest in these 
people, and develop their coaching skills; they will become your front-
line transformation team. You are essentially investing in the catalyst of 
enterprise change, those who will guide the re-architecting of your future 
state, so choose this team wisely. These individuals will eventually become 
your ambassadors, spreading Lean thinking across the entire enterprise, 
which means that they will eventually engage in areas outside their current

department. While a manager may be reluctant to lose their “best people” 
to this effort, if they have truly stabilized and standardized the processes 
within their own area, then they should be able to cross-train and transi-
tion another person into their  role—first as  a temporary backfill then 
later as a permanent replacement—which is a good human resource devel-
opment practice. 
Gather this team regularly to share their experiences. Send them to the 
occasional conference or education event where they’ll meet and learn 
from others who may be further along in the transformation journey. 
Senior leaders should assume the role of coaches and mentors to the Lean 
leadership team, actively participating, learning together,  and helping to 
shape the adoption of Lean thinking. The Lean transformation will begin 
to take hold when this core group of internal Lean leaders develops a 
problem-solving mind-set, accompanied by the ability to tell compelling 
stories about the value and necessity of Lean thinking within the context 
of your organization.
Create a Basic Toolkit
A few basic tools, well chosen and consistently used, are far better than 
many tools that are misunderstood or poorly applied. Start with the basics: 
A3 thinking, value stream mapping, 5S, problem solving and decision 
making, visual management, standardized work, metrics, and communi-
cations, supported by experiential learning. Let the core team select and 
learn new and advanced tools as they are needed. When a team member 
develops special interest and proficiency in a particular tool, ask him or 
her to document and share this knowledge with others.
Assess Key Enterprise Value Streams
Value stream map the current state at a macro level; this mapping must 
identify and quantify the flow of work and supporting information of 
enterprise-wide core processes. Tie the strengths and weaknesses of these 
value streams to strategic goals; this alone is usually an enlightening exer-
cise for cross-functional teams as they learn to see their contribution in 
the bigger picture of the enterprise and its customers.
Create a high-level process model to guide business process manage-
ment (BPM, discussed in Chapter 4) efforts, to be used as the foundation 

260  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
for communicating and discussing the interrelated nature of all core 
processes. But be careful not to go overboard: excessive mapping that 
does not drive improvement is wasteful—the objective here is to develop 
a reasonably simple, accessible, and coherent model of value streams 
and supporting processes that will help prioritize and sequence change 
efforts. If one does not already exist, establish an enterprise-wide frame-
work for governance and prioritization. If it does exist, dovetail it into 
the new enterprise process model, so there is a clear relationship between 
strategic goals and enterprise processes. In any case, start with one or a 
few processes (pilots) that everyone knows instinctively are in need of 
attention and let BPM and governance evolve over time.
Execution
Launch Pilot Kaizen Projects
Choose meaningful problems whose success is achievable; don’t tackle the 
hardest problems first. Focus on those areas of the organization that are 
most likely to demonstrate early support for the Lean transformation. Use 
initial pilots to standardize communications, training, and the use of basic 
tools and measurements. Develop your internal coaching skills, demon-
strate early wins, and promote meaningful stories and lessons learned to 
spread interest and encourage wider adoption.
Invest in Enterprise-Wide Infrastructure
While initial pilots are underway, continue developing the coaching team, 
while extending the infrastructure (tested and evolved during pilots, 
guided by the Lean CoE) to support expanding Lean efforts: a website, 
virtual and physical libraries, a knowledge base, collaboration and knowl-
edge sharing tools, measurement standards and templates, communica-
tion tools, skills tracking, education and training materials, and so on.
Measure Results and Assess Understanding and Buy-In
Measuring and openly communicating observations, trends, and 
results send a clear message that the Lean transformation is a strategic 

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  261
priority. In order to ensure a shared understanding of strategic intent, 
investigate teams and departments where measured results are not 
conspicuously aligned with strategy. Otherwise hidden legacy prac-
tices and attitudes (part of the culture but not the formal manage-
ment system) may inexplicably hinder the transformation in isolated 
but important pockets of the organization (known in Lean circles as 
anchor-draggers).
Begin with the managers and supervisors to assess their level of under-
standing of strategic objectives at each step in the organization hierar-
chy, and clarify their linkage with localized objectives and daily behavior. 
Explain why you are assessing people’s understanding of strategic intent. 
Does each manager and supervisor understand and support the need for 
consistent reinforcement of specific objectives (constancy of purpose)? 
Has capacity been freed up to support the new improvement work that 
must be done? Let the managers and supervisors know you’ll be speaking 
with their teams during the next gemba walk, and what you’ll be asking.
Who Goes First?
We are often asked the question “Where does Lean IT start?” Does 
Lean IT begin with the IT organization outwardly participating in 
enterprise value streams, improving IT operations only as they are 
identified as a hindrance to effective business process performance? 
Or does the IT organization focus inwardly first on cleaning up its 
own backyard, applying Lean thinking to IT services? Or should the 
IT organization do both at the same time, as resources and priorities 
allow? We’ve seen each approach work effectively, as long as leadership 
is mindful of resource requirements, timelines, and expectations.
A progressive IT organization can indeed initiate its own inwardly 
facing Lean transformation, even though the overall enterprise has 
not yet made the commitment. In doing so, the IT organization may 
realize significant, localized benefits. Examples of this can be found 
within organizations that have implemented Lean software devel-
opment and the Information Technology Infrastructure Library 
(ITIL). Although these efforts engage portions of the enterprise (the 
direct internal customers of these activities), they usually lack an 
overall enterprise value stream focus, and thus return only localized 
(though often significant) benefits.

262  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
During gemba walks, use one-on-one conversations with those closest to 
the work to assess their level of comprehension. Is there clear understand-
ing of strategic intent and objectives? Does everyone understand how their 
daily work adds value and supports strategy? Is there a common focus? Is 
there buy-in? If not, why? Adjust communications with the goal of everyone 
in the organization understanding what they need to accomplish to sup-
port strategic intent and why they must be a part of the transformation.
Consolidate Gains and Build Momentum
Communicate successes, failures, and lessons learned openly to estab-
lish trust and build support. Document and disseminate standard work 
and measurements.
Launch expanded cycles of improvement—move from the pilot phase to 
ongoing and self-sustaining kaizen activity. This often involves identify-
ing those members of the senior management team who are most enthu-
siastic, using their energy and persuasion (backed by the steering team) 
to pull value stream improvements through cross-functional areas that 
are slow to adopt. Continuously invest in education and communication, 
introducing advanced tools and topics as needed.
Senior management should be especially vigilant at this time; the great-
est risk for backsliding arises just when the transformation appears to be 
taking off. Accountability should be explicit and strong; integrate Lean 
management systems into enterprise management processes, and include 
kaizen planning and results measurement with the regular management 
review and planning processes. Emphasize strategy deployment and 
catchball to align strategy with action.
During this time, accelerate the integration of business and IT par-
ticipants. Matrix IT associates into the business units they support. Break 
down the physical, virtual, and cultural barriers that often surround the 
IT organization. IT members should regularly attend kaizen events. In our 
experience, when IT associates are not involved, inappropriate technology 
solutions are often “tossed over the wall” to IT, that do not account for the 
underlying (and often hidden) systemic complexities of the process. This dis-
connect creates technical debt, which the IT organization must ultimately 
be responsible for. But when IT associates engage in a kaizen event from the 
beginning, it significantly improves the overall team’s understanding of the 
situation, and the effectiveness of the improvements that result.

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  263
Similarly, business stakeholders should regularly visit IT team meetings 
to better understand how IT thinks and works. This mutual understand-
ing and empathy helps to integrate and synchronize IT–business change 
management, planning, budgeting, and performance management 
cycles—moving from utility investing toward continuous improvement 
and innovation that create real value.
Some areas typically adopt Lean IT more quickly and enthusiastically 
than others. Of course, the primary constraint that hinders IT involvement 
in kaizen is available time. An investment in Lean IT is an investment in 
quality at the source: slowing down to speed up, doing things right the 
first time. This illuminates a push versus pull dynamic when spreading 
Lean IT initiatives throughout the IT organization and across the enter-
prise in general. Managers must invest in the future, often making difficult 
tradeoff decisions, setting aside erstwhile priorities to make time for Lean 
improvements to take root. In our experience, however, if you “push” Lean 
onto managers, it becomes just another item on their to-do list, more load 
on their backlog, more anxiety. But if you properly convey the spirit of 
Lean, that it will ultimately relieve waste and pay back dividends in time, 
capacity, and quality results, then managers will (perhaps slowly at first) 
accept the up-front investment and create a “pull” toward active engage-
ment in kaizen activity. 
At later stages of maturity, as momentum starts building, use strategy 
deployment to begin directing kaizen activity toward supporting break-
through (kaikaku) objectives. 
Finally, we are often asked, “How long does a Lean transformation 
take?” The obvious answer is that continuous improvement never ends, 
and it also depends on your definition of success. But clearly, in order to 
embark on such an endeavor, we need to set measurable goals that justify 
the initial commitment and effort. Though every transformation is dif-
ferent and ultimately follows its own journey of discovery, we set initial 
expectations for “time to results” in the following manner:
•	 Six months for engaged pilots with kaizen success stories—localized 
paybacks and celebrated low hanging fruit achievements—supported 
by a preliminary Lean management system framework.
•	 Up to two years to spread basic kaizen proficiency supported by 
a sustaining Lean management system and strategy deployment 
framework across an extended organization.

264  •  Lean IT: Enabling and Sustaining Your Lean Transformation﻿
•	 Three to five years to launch an authentic transformation—not just 
changing behavior but influencing the way individuals think about 
their work and how they seek out problems as opportunities for 
improvement.
Setting the Pace for Change 
It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent 
that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change.
—Charles Darwin
We have entered an era of process leadership, where the IT organization has 
an opportunity to drive meaningful change throughout the enterprise.
Process leadership is not the same as process ownership; each process 
should have an owner with sufficient authority to drive improvement, 
someone who is accountable and responsible for outcomes. But process 
ownership is not sufficient by itself. Process leadership, the art of conceiv-
ing and guiding the overall enterprise toward value optimization, is essen-
tial, and it is a natural (though perhaps dormant) competency of the IT 
organization; no one else is better suited, and in a better position, to see the 
whole enterprise from a systems perspective.
As we illustrated in Chapter 1 (Figure 1.1), chief information officers 
(CIOs) now list leading enterprise change initiatives as a key priority for 
the future. This is well beyond the familiar focus on revenue growth and 
cost reduction, going right to the heart of innovation. The collaboration 
among process owners and process leaders naturally helps to integrate and 
mobilize business and IT efforts aligned with constancy of purpose.
As we have learned throughout this book, common characteristics of 
traditional IT include unnecessary complexity, instability, slow change 
cycles, and the impulse to lead with technology “solutions” rather than 
addressing business problems at the root. As advances in technology con-
tinue to accelerate, if these patterns aren’t changed, they will continue 
to cause friction, hindering enterprise-wide continuous improvement 
and innovation. At best, this resistance will impede the Lean enterprise 

A Lean IT Roadmap  •  265
transformation, making it longer, more costly, riskier, and more painful, 
while introducing additional layers of unnecessary technical complexity. 
At worst, it will cause the transformation effort to falter, backslide, and 
eventually fail. In our opinion, the lack of IT engagement is one of the 
primary reasons many Lean transformations don’t reach sustainability.
But when IT and the rest of the business become integrated, thinking 
Lean and acting in unison, something magical happens: quality infor-
mation and effective information systems unleash the power of human 
potential.
Lean thinking helps everyone in the IT organization demonstrate lead-
ership and develop a laserlike focus—inwardly on personal, as well as 
operational excellence, and outwardly to the continuous improvement 
of business processes—eliminating waste and delivering value to every 
customer.
At the strategic level, Lean IT leadership helps integrate and synchronize 
business and IT change, enabling a rapid, iterative cadence of collabora-
tive management systems that set the pace, the drumbeat, of enterprise-
wide improvement.
And at the tactical level, Lean IT leadership helps to institutionalize the 
Lean enterprise transformation through process standardization, error 
proofing, measuring, communicating, collaborating, and sharing knowl-
edge—creating the foundation for a continuously learning and innovat-
ing organization.
When information systems naturally reflect Lean thinking, there is a 
continuous systemic reinforcement of Lean behavior throughout all work-
flows and information flows. The integration of IT and the business accel-
erates the organization’s ability to learn, change, improve, innovate, and 
grow.
True transformation starts from within, with the business and IT focused 
on a shared strategic intent, discovering and solving problems together. The 
transformation begins with people, process, and technology—in that order.

Barry-Wehmiller: Lean and ERP Work Together
Built on nearly 100 years of quality manufacturing history in Green Bay, 
Wisconsin, Paper Converting (PCMC) experienced a decline in growth 
and profitability in 2004. This company of approximately 900 associ-
ates and US$200 million in sales had seen conventional manufacturing 
methods cause a run-up in inventory, placing the financial security of the 
company at risk. Management had attempted to streamline processes by 
implementing a large and well-known enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
system several years before, but overcustomization led to greater complex-
ity and less visibility to daily work.
In 2005 PCMC became part of the Barry-Wehmiller organization. 
Founded in 1885, Barry-Wehmiller employs over 5,000 associates world-
wide, with over US$1 billion in revenues across four product platforms. 
Barry-Wehmiller had recently embarked on its people-centric Lean jour-
ney, and with their new vision to be a great American manufacturing 
company, leadership at PCMC led a dramatic turnaround in the business, 
moving from a large loss to a healthy profit in just one year. This turn-
around was the result of many forces, including some restructuring of the 
business and a cyclical upswing in the business cycle, but no one force was 
greater than the ability of established PCMC associates to grow into new 
roles of leadership and communicate a vision of a sustainable future for 
the business.
As PCMC set its sights on sustaining the turnaround, its underlying busi-
ness processes and ERP system would have to be addressed. Shortly after 
the acquisition, senior leadership prioritized the transition from their previ-
ous ERP system to Barry-Wehmiller’s enterprise-wide standard ERP plat-
form. This conversion was dually motivated by issues with the legacy system 
and alignment with the ERP platform throughout the balance of Barry-
Wehmiller. Although leaders from sales, operations, and customer service 

270  •  Case Studies
saw the importance of the project, they could not move beyond perceiving 
the project as another software implementation led by the IT organization, 
instead of an effort that would fundamentally impact business processes.
After a change in IT leadership and team composition, executive lead-
ers soon realized that they had misjudged the scope; this was a company-
wide, not an IT-centric, project. Using their existing hoshin kanri strategy 
deployment process, the ERP implementation was moved to the num-
ber one breakthrough priority at PCMC for six months. Resources were 
assigned from every department, and the vice president of operations 
became the project champion; in his words, “We had chaos; we had no 
well-defined process. But the project allowed us to implement brand-new 
standard work, to get consistent performance every single day.”
It was at this turning point that PCMC’s ERP implementation became 
a vehicle for transitioning to a Lean way of thinking. Cross-functional 
teams began to map the current system, finding waste in virtually every 
process. In one example, 10 steps involving five people were required sim-
ply for an engineer to create a new part number. These teams found that 
nearly every process in the organization relied on the ERP system as a 
source of information or as a communication trigger for an activity in 
another department. The only way to holistically improve their processes 
was to redefine how they used the ERP system.
And that is what they did. Multidisciplinary task forces were created for 
each major area of the organization: procurement, manufacturing, engineer-
ing, and assembly—breaking down silos for the first time. Each task force uti-
lized Lean tools to get to the root cause of common frustrations, brainstorm 
solutions, and create a future state plan. Meanwhile, the teamwork in each 
group nurtured empathetic relationships where more people than ever before 
within the organization understood the essential functions of all departments.
After ERP go-live in April 2008, the implementation team encountered 
several difficulties; the project had not solved every challenge, but Lean 
had created the process and team-oriented attitude necessary to address 
them. Task forces quickly met and found solutions to lingering issues. 
The ERP implementation concluded in August with glowing praise from 
corporate operational and IT leaders, who called it “the greatest business 
implementation in the history of the company.”
As PCMC continues moving forward, the value of utilizing a Lean 
approach to drive the implementation and ongoing ERP change manage-
ment is more apparent than ever. The entire reporting capabilities of the 

Case Studies  •  271
ERP system changed, producing a handful of real-time, actionable reports 
to replace the reams of ignored reports of the past. The number of process 
handoffs and delays has been reduced. Moreover, value stream stakehold-
ers throughout the organization feel that the ERP system works for them, 
rather than the other way around. In the end, PCMC accomplished much 
more than the successful conversion to a new ERP system; it institutional-
ized the processes and support structures necessary to transition to a Lean 
and sustainable future.

Con-way: Document Management Virtual 5S
Con-way, Inc. is a US$5 billion freight and logistics company deliver-
ing less-than-truckload regional delivery, truckload long-haul freight, 
and third-party logistics and warehousing services. Although Con-way, 
Inc.’s corporate headquarters are based in San Mateo, California, many 
of the centralized corporate functions are based at Con-way Enterprise 
Services (CES) in Portland, Oregon. This location provides the majority of 
the information technology, finance and accounting, and human resource 
activities for Con-way, Inc.
The Information Technology division at CES includes departments for 
each of the three business units, plus infrastructure, the web team, and 
desktop services. Within these departments are dozens of workgroups that 
create customer specific applications, maintaining and enhancing existing 
systems to keep worldwide freight moving on schedule. Internally, these 
departments provide full services to the 25,000 Con-way employees scat-
tered around the globe.
Over time a lack of organized document storage procedures, standard-
ized templates, and standard operating procedures (SOPs) created a host 
of problems and waste for the organization. Documents and procedures 
were stored in personal hard drives, various SharePoint sites, shared serv-
ers, and a variety of other locations. Team members often spent hours 
each week searching for documentation. Upon finding documentation 

272  •  Case Studies
there was no guarantee that it was the current revision, which led to 
an investigation process requiring more time and energy. Compounding 
the problem was the common practice of using e-mail attachments to 
deliver files to coworkers, rather than providing links to specific loca-
tions where a master document was located. Several copies of files would 
be housed in various locations, none of which had revision control or 
a clear owner. In other cases documentation could not be located and 
would need to be recreated, adding hours of rework to what should have 
been a simple request.
Along with wasted time and frustration came additional business risk 
to Con-way and its customers. For example, disaster recovery procedures 
were difficult to locate and lacked standard formatting, which could create 
delays during a recovery effort. Team members were especially frustrated 
with the lack of organization around after-hours start-up procedures. 
Frequently the on-call support person would be required to call other team 
members throughout the night in order to locate specific documentation 
for a system that had gone down. This was exacerbated by the number of 
systems that were supported by the organization. Confusion, misdirec-
tion, wasted time, and frustration were daily occurrences as teams fought 
to locate information that kept Con-way, and the customers they support, 
up and running.
During the rollout of Lean office to the organization, one of the initial 
efforts was a virtual 5S activity for many of the workgroups. Following 
the 5S methodology, the teams made great improvements to the organiza-
tion, upkeep, and accessibility of information. Here is a brief description 
of the standard approach we developed, as we have rolled out this initia-
tive across the entire campus.
Sort: Compounding the storage and retrieval problem was the sheer 
volume of files that had been created over time, most of which were 
outdated or no longer needed. Groups used file or directory searches 
and cataloguing tools to analyze the information and identify 
unwanted files. These unwanted files were either deleted or placed in 
archives, where they would be purged if not accessed within a given 
amount of time.
Set in order: A common location was established for workgroups, typi-
cally a SharePoint site or a shared drive accessible by all team mem-
bers. Using tools such as card sort exercises, folders and structures 

Case Studies  •  273
were established for the specific needs of each workgroup. The process 
involved having team members sort cards labeled with contents or 
functions into groups that made the most sense for that workgroup.
Shine: Files were placed in the appropriate location and hierarchy, based 
on the structure each group had created. In many cases, several lay-
ers of the folder structure were restricted in order to avoid team 
members “dumping” files at a top layer.
Standardize: An SOP was created for each storage site indicating file 
structures, proper data storage protocols, and ownership for each 
workgroup. Work groups also determined standards for docu-
ment sharing, such as sending links to a master file rather than 
sending the file itself. Standard templates and naming conven-
tions were also created so that similar documents had the same 
look and feel.
Sustain: In order to maintain the improvements, a number of sus-
taining measures have been put in place. Several layers of the 
folder hierarchy are secured and assigned to an individual with the 
responsibility for managing the new storage format and structure. 
In addition, the top-level folder contains an SOP document outlin-
ing the storage procedures. Teams participate in quarterly reviews 
of their storage locations, ensuring that the standard work is being 
followed.
Best practices are now shared across the organization, allowing teams to 
implement 5S methodology faster and in a standard format. As a result of 
these activities, thousands of wasted hours have been avoided, amounting 
to over US$200,000 each year in labor costs. In addition, many intangible 
benefits have been realized: improved understanding of many common 
workflow processes, reduced employee frustration, faster response to criti-
cal situations, and less risk to the organization should disaster recovery 
ever be necessary.
Con-way Enterprise Services continues to implement the virtual 5S pro-
gram throughout the organization, reaping the benefits of what was once 
considered a manufacturing methodology.

Con-way: Focused Value Streams
The Con-way IT organization supports a global enterprise of nearly 25,000 
employees and is composed of application development and maintenance 
teams for each major business unit within Con-way, Inc. Freight, Menlo 
Logistics, and Truckload IT teams are supported with a shared services 
group for enterprise architecture and computing infrastructure. This 
case study focuses solely on the IT application development group for the 
Menlo Logistics line of business, a third-party logistics service that offers 
outsourced supply chain engineering, design, and transportation and 
warehouse management services.
Menlo IT is composed of several functional teams that manage client-
facing, specialized, and highly configured software applications (e.g., 
Warehouse Management Systems) and that oversee internal business pro-
cesses for sales support, customer on-boarding (start-ups), and customer 
ongoing operations. This creates a matrix structure with highly skilled 
and often specialized individuals assigned to multiple customer projects, 
internal projects, and IT support tasks.
Current State
A senior IT executive observed the following challenges within his IT 
group through observation and discussion with his subordinates:
•	 Excessive “thrashing”: People were spread across too many efforts, 
experiencing frequent interruptions and task switching that caused 
waste, lack of focus, and frustration.
•	 Customer enhancement projects of less than 400 hours had lead 
times from 22 to 34 weeks, considered unacceptable by both internal 
and external customers.
•	 Production support issues frequently drew people away from time-
critical start-up projects, negatively impacting customers and the 
perceptions of IT.
•	 New start-ups were often started suddenly with little advance notice, 
negatively impacting all other work in the queue.
•	 Customer work was all consuming, and software development teams 
were not able to focus sufficient time on improving their own inter-
nal processes.

Case Studies  •  275
•	 There was limited standardized work across software develop-
ment teams.
•	 The organization was challenged to establish and meet commit-
ment dates.
•	 The work environment was stressful due to the factors described above.
•	 Resource scheduling was overly complex, because employees worked on 
multiple projects simultaneously. The dynamic nature of large projects 
required frequent changes to work plans and resource assignments.
Proposal to IT Management
The senior IT executive made a proposal to his managers in early 2008, out-
lining a vision for change based on Lean principles of cost reduction, waste 
elimination, standardization, cycle time reduction, and improved quality. 
Specifically, the executive wanted to emulate a familiar approach from Lean 
manufacturing called the focused factory and isolate the more stable IT 
processes (production support and small- to medium-sized enhancements) 
from chaotic processes (customer start-ups). He believed the focused fac-
tory concept offered a promising alternative and envisioned three value 
streams within IT. The objectives of this realignment were to:
•	 Reduce cycle time for each logical IT delivery (value) stream
•	 Reduce complexity associated with resource scheduling and demand 
management
•	 Improve visual controls for each value stream
•	 Level the work within each value stream, even though aggregate 
demand was naturally variable
•	 Reduce waste associated with individuals constantly shifting between 
projects and production support. Excess switching was estimated to 
add 25 percent effort to tasks, causing unnecessary lead time and 
quality problems.
•	 Reduce waste associated with reprioritization
•	 Increase focus on production support efforts that would improve 
service availability (quality) and reduce defects
•	 Reduce waste associated with excess overtime due to poor 
resource utilization
•	 Better balance individual workloads
•	 Address workforce frustration and stress

276  •  Case Studies
The IT managers collectively met in a workshop to discuss the vision 
and identify key concerns, risks, and alternatives. The managers were 
initially supportive but also apprehensive, since their teams were fully 
loaded and there was no slack capacity to buffer problems should they 
occur during the introduction of this new approach. So considerable time 
was invested to clarify the goals and fully vet the issues. The managers 
developed issues lists and prioritized them based on severity and impact. 
They ultimately agreed to a modified version of the original approach by 
starting with two value streams: production support, and projects and 
enhancements. It was envisioned that enhancements could be segregated 
from start-up projects into a third value stream at a later date. The man-
agers identified subprocesses and specialized resources that were to be 
shared across the value streams.
Much consideration was given to several key issues. First, the teams were 
concerned about being co-located with others in the same value stream. 
It was felt this would be too disruptive and limit the sharing of technical 
information. Second, the team recognized the need to ensure technical 
continuity across the value streams. Third, the production support value 
stream (PSVS) was seen as being of less value; employees expressed con-
cern about being asked to make what was perceived to be a downward 
career change. Fourth, the managers were concerned about the volatil-
ity of demand in the projects and enhancements value stream (PEVS). 
Countermeasures were developed to address each of these concerns.
The management team identified the major activities required to launch 
the value stream structure:
•	 Clearly define the role of value stream owner
•	 Socialize with employees for feedback using a consultative decision-
making model
•	 Inform the infrastructure organization of the changes that were tak-
ing place, as they provide the support to the production systems
•	 Assign employees across the value streams
•	 Finalize the key success metrics for both value streams
•	 Build the annual budget according to the value stream model
•	 Modify the customer work intake processes for each value stream to 
make demand more visible
•	 Enhance the workload demand management process and firm up 
the master-scheduling role

Case Studies  •  277
•	 Establish time-tracking conventions
•	 Ensure no negative impact on production control and change con-
trol processes
Owners for each value stream were selected, and roles and responsi-
bilities were established. Since it was agreed to retain the existing func-
tional structure in the beginning, the team also determined the roles and 
responsibilities between value stream owners versus functional managers 
(matrix model).
A team of individual contributors was formed with representatives from 
each functional group. These are the individuals whose jobs would be 
changed under the value stream model. These employees reviewed the value 
stream concept and were given time to provide feedback to management. 
Managers met individually with teams to answer questions and explain the 
proposed benefits. Employees provided feedback via the representatives, 
and management presented a formal written response to all 200+ employ-
ees addressing their concerns. This seemed to satisfy the employees, who 
greatly appreciated the participatory model that allowed them to comment 
on the proposed change. Management clarified its intent to move forward 
with the rollout.
The managers then built their annual budgets, based on the value 
stream structure, and determined the size of each team represented in 
each value stream.
The value stream owners launched the structure by identifying one 
representative from each functional team to be a core team member in 
the value stream. This core team worked through success metrics, pro-
duced “as-is” and “to-be” value stream maps, identified potential kaizens, 
and completed a continuous improvement roadmap. Each functional 
team also finalized its employee rotation model. In some cases, the value 
stream teams had to complete kaizens to establish standard work pro-
cesses required for a value stream structure. After 12 months of devel-
opment, feedback, buy-in, and preparation, all teams were successfully 
split along value stream lines with new work intake and coordination 
processes in place.
To support these changes, the IT sales and operations planning model 
was modified so that only resources in the PEVS were built into the capac-
ity plan. This reduced by one-third the number of resources that required 
complex workload scheduling. In addition, time to work on continuous 

278  •  Case Studies
improvement activities was built into each team’s workload plan, and visual 
controls were added to show weeks of backlog and employee utilization.
Under the value stream structure, cross-team representatives identify 
high-priority kaizen opportunities and execute them. Their progress is 
reviewed with IT management each quarter.
Key benefits seen so far (given the structure has been in place for a 
few months):
•	 The production support value stream has experienced less fire-
fighting and overtime, because staffing is more dedicated and is 
sized appropriately.
•	 There is less “thrashing” caused by people moving between value 
streams, but it is not completely eliminated because of specialized tech-
nical skills of shared resources who must work across both streams.
•	 The projects and enhancement value stream teams can focus on 
projects without interruptions from production support, and the 
production support team members are able to stay more focused on 
production incidents, providing faster overall response time. The 
teams (and their customers) are already seeing the benefits.
•	 Team members are able to clearly see the lack of standardization 
across their teams and the inefficiencies created.
•	 Teams are able to successfully identify, plan, and complete value 
stream (cross-functional) kaizens with success. The functional struc-
ture originally inhibited cross-functional kaizens.
•	 There is improved cross-team collaboration when an incident spans 
multiple teams. Having a production support gatekeeper monitor 
e-mails and handle assignment and ownership of production issues 
ensures that every reported incident or service request is addressed. 
This has reduced effort associated with each team monitoring incom-
ing report incidents.
•	 Although some teams are still having trouble finding time to work 
on root causes to problems in the new production support process, 
the teams report that capturing the root cause gives them visibil-
ity and focus when categorizing the issues. This will yield many 
benefits in the future for Pareto analysis and prioritized kaizen 
events.

Menlo IT will continue its Lean journey using the value stream 
model. With time, IT expects to achieve all its stated objectives. Key 
success factors include the slower pace of implementation, allowing 
more time to engage employees in the change process. Assigning a 
designated owner for each value stream has provided a point of focus 
and accountability that will drive proactive change and continuous 
improvement forward.

Group Health: Lean Software Development 
Aligns with the Business Strategy
Group Health provides health care and medical insurance coverage to 
over 500,000 residents in Washington State and northern Idaho. Nearly 
two-thirds of Group Health insurance plan members receive care in 
Group Health–operated clinics, benefiting from their investment in elec-
tronic medical records and other technology-enabled practice innova-
tions. The synergy and information sharing between health care delivery 
and insurance enable Group Health to provide seamless, comprehensive, 
and cost-effective service to their members, while helping to identify 
many opportunities for patient-focused continuous improvement. Our 
collective aspiration is to help define the future of quality and affordable 
health care.*
We began our Lean journey in the summer of 2006. The operational area 
of the Health Plan was designated as the “model line” to pilot Lean efforts, 
and within the Health Plan three value stream segments were selected to 
be the first out of the gate, including the Application Management value 
stream, which provides software development and maintenance to support 
health plan operations. Application Management was chosen as a primary 
focus because the smooth flow of information is vital in a health insur-
ance “information factory” and frequent changes to provider agreements

and regulations drive constant change in business rules and systems. Bill 
Siemering (IT) and Mike Manis (Business) together led teams in defining 
the current and future states, representing the activities of business and IT 
throughout the value stream.
The Current State
The current state was a typical scribble of waste and delay, long on manag-
ing the backlog and creating detailed requirements documents, but short 
on releasing quality software on schedule. Not that work didn’t get done; 
it just wasn’t the work on the list. Instead priorities were “red-phoned” in 
from a vice president or pushed under the door to a programmer friend. 
Customers were unhappy, work was not visible, and there was no discern-
able prioritization or delivery process.
In the initial phase of the model line deployment, we wanted to accom-
plish a limited set of objectives:
•	 Make the work visible
•	 Control work intake
•	 Create a visible daily work management system
•	 Implement Lean techniques, such as last-minute requirements focus-
ing on value
•	 Change the culture by tearing down silos and creating cross-func-
tional work cells
To help us quickly close the knowledge gap, we brought in a Lean con-
sulting group and invited a team of developers, architects, and business 
analysts for training. We then engaged the team in discussions on the 
“what,” “why,” and “how” of our mission. While we knew the “what” in a 
broad context (using a Lean/agile approach) and we could articulate the 
“why” (we needed to become more efficient in supporting organizational 
goals), the “how” we had to develop as a team.
The Future State
The future state was developed using a Rapid Process Improvement 
Workshop (RPIW) approach where the teams spent many hours over the 
course of five days working together to design the new process and plan 

Case Studies  •  281
the implementation. Although the work was at times a little contentious, 
we emerged with a well-documented plan that was ready to implement. We 
began immediately, providing last-minute training to business managers 
who had new work to submit into the backlog, using detailed process flows 
and targets developed during the RPIW to keep us on track. Everyone who 
participated in the RPIW was included in one or more aspects of the new 
process and helped guide the remaining participants. We converted exist-
ing project manager positions to take the role of scrum masters, identified 
product owners, and created three work teams: one for maintenance, one 
for smaller enhancements, and one for strategic work. We were not at all 
sure that this was the best configuration, but decided that it was as good as 
other ideas and we could fine-tune later with PDCA.
As we began the implementation, we established a work intake system 
that accepted only the highest prioritized work in the backlog: up to three 
sprints, where each sprint represents approximately four weeks’ work. In 
other words, our planned backlog is maintained at a stable three months’ 
work. Identification of potential projects came from business owners who 
would describe the high-level business need, the expected return, and any 
other significant drivers of the work. Business owners from multiple depart-
ments from across the value stream would then prioritize each work item 
against all others in the backlog. Work was then completed in rapid sprint 
cycles, achieving a just-in-time approach to meeting our customers’ high-
est priority requirements. Contention in prioritization decisions was mini-
mized through group discussion; if a business owner thought his or her work 
should be set at a higher priority, he or she was required to justify the change 
at the meeting based on value. If consensus could still not be reached, a vote 
would be taken. Occasionally, issues were elevated for resolution.
Our Progress So Far
The cornerstone of our methodology is prominent visual systems in all 
work areas containing backlogs, front burners, and burndown charts, 
supported by teams dedicated to keeping them up to date. Internally 
developed software (mostly Excel based) is used to track all activity, pro-
duce reports, and print artifacts on colored cards that are posted on the 
visual boards.
Each month we host a day-long work-planning and intake session 
where business owners bring new Use Cases: a brief description of the 

282  •  Case Studies
desired business outcome and expected return. Use Cases are reviewed 
and prioritized by the business owners, and then unfolded into “stories,” 
or buckets of work necessary to complete the Use Case. Stories are sized 
by technical staff with business owners present to provide additional 
information as needed. The backlog is updated from the planning and 
intake session.
The next step is sprint planning. Available hours of staff capacity are 
determined for each sprint. Then, starting with the highest priority, stories 
are further unfolded into tasks, and each task is assigned a time estimate to 
complete. The sprint is full, and the “front burner” filled when scheduled 
tasks fill available hours for the sprint. We plan for slack (nondevelopment 
time) by building time standards for scheduled meetings, regular e-mail, 
and other necessary activities into our available capacity calculations. No 
additional buffer is built into the work plan.
Work is divided among three self-contained work teams, each of 
which includes architects, developers, and business analysts. Each team 
maintains its own visual display area containing all of the stories for 
the sprint and index cards for each task. Developers “pull” work sim-
ply by moving the kanban card for the highest priority story into the 
in-process section. Unexpected production support requirements can 
be pulled into process at any time, without causing disruption to the 
schedule. This can happen since there is a dedicated work cell for pro-
duction and maintenance that has scheduled time for unexpected prob-
lems. This flexibility is also supported by a heijunka schedule which 
allows us to shuffle the sequence of work in the queue at any time until 
it is released to production.
Progress is tracked daily via burndown charts that graphically display 
the hours remaining in the sprint against the hours of work left to com-
plete. Teams huddle daily to review burndowns (ensuring progress is on 
pace for the sprint cycle) and to evaluate what work was completed yester-
day, evaluate what will be worked on today, identify remaining hours to 
complete, and discuss any constraints or barriers.
Going Forward
In late 2007, our CEO made the commitment to deploy Lean through-
out the entire organization, using hoshin kanri (strategy deployment) as 
a standard management system, while leveraging our progress in health 

Case Studies  •  283
plans as a solid foundation. Over the past 18 months we have constructed 
a tiered hoshin kanri plan that encompasses the whole enterprise. We 
have just launched a significant business intelligence initiative, designed 
to provide quality information to support continuous improvement and 
the hoshin kanri planning cycle. (See Figure 12.1)
Strategic priorities cascade through divisions and layers of manage-
ment, feeding the application management backlog and providing busi-
ness case justification and prioritization guidance. The backlog is also fed 
directly with production problems identified through various sources, 
including the IT service desk (where we are currently implementing 
ITIL). Our Lean Management System is helping the teams responsible 
for Applications Management, as well as other areas of the IT organiza-
tion, focus on delivering services that are most needed in order to pro-
vide the best health care to those who matter most: our members and 
patients.

Ingersoll Rand Security Technologies: 
Lean Six Sigma Improves Order Quality
Ingersoll Rand (IR) is a US$13 billion global diversified industrial com-
pany, driven by employees who are proud to offer products and solutions 
people use every day to create a positive impact in their world. Driven by a 
100-year-old tradition of technological innovation, we enable companies 
and their customers to create progress. Our Security Technologies sector 
provides state-of-the-art security solutions for residential and commer-
cial markets.
This case study describes the challenges of entering complex order infor-
mation into a business system with the goal of achieving 100 percent accu-
racy. It describes the problem-solving process undertaken, and the tools 
utilized to dramatically improve the process for manufacturing industrial 
doors and related hardware.
Problem Description
There are an unlimited number of product configurations and order 
possibilities that may be required to meet our customers’ needs. The 
placement and fulfillment of a customer’s order require the entry of the 
customer requirements into the manufacturing and business informa-
tion system. Critical parameters that must be accurate include size, shape, 
material, color, finish, and key locations for locks, closers, and other asso-
ciated hardware, and a correctly calculated price for the configured item. 
Customers often provide product specification information in their own 

Case Studies  •  285
format, which typically does not match the format of our system, creat-
ing the potential for additional errors introduced during data translation 
and entry.
Orders are received into the sales support area via fax, e-mail, and 
traditional mail. The first step is to understand what the customer is 
trying to order. This is not easy, since there are myriad ways to describe 
what is actually desired. Order entry associates must also determine if 
what the customer orders is truly what is necessary to meet fire, safety, 
and weather-related requirements. This requires an understanding of 
the customer’s specific application, as well as regulations in locations 
worldwide.
Once the order has been clarified and reviewed, next it must be entered 
into our information system. A product configurator has been developed 
to enable us to meet many of our stock offerings; however, it is virtu-
ally impossible to predefine all likely combinations. When a configura-
tion isn’t available, the order entry personnel must then key in the order 
manually. This tedious process requires a great deal of product and appli-
cation knowledge; order entry personnel must understand products and 
how they are constructed, specific applications, specific door construc-
tion techniques, and specific hardware locations and requirements. This 
manual process creates a fairly high risk of error.
There are many consequences from this error-prone process: delays, 
errors, and rework. The high occurrence of defects via manual order 
entry can cause disruption within the order entry function, in manufac-
turing, and also with customers. Variation of the ordering process is the 
enemy. Understanding what causes the variation and dealing with root 
cause issues comprised the focus of this problem-solving effort.
IR took on the task of improving the order entry process, utilizing the 
DMAIC approach (below) and Six Sigma tools (see Appendix B for more 
on Lean and Six Sigma)
The DMAIC Approach
•	 Define the issue
•	 Measure and quantify the impact of the issue
•	 Analyze the issue: Determine root cause
•	 Improve the process
•	 Control the process

286  •  Case Studies
Define
Deal with quality issues (defects), improving the overall order entry accu-
racy and a reduction in variation.
Measure and Analyze
With the aid of an outside consultant, the group established a metric 
for counting total defects. The process was mapped, and defects were 
recorded at key internal process points. Understanding where defects 
occurred in the process was vital to solving and addressing the issue. 
Key tools utilized were process maps, supplier–input–process–output–
customer analysis (SIPOC), operational definitions, and quantitative 
methods. Statistical process control was used to trend errors and high-
light special causes of variation. Probability analysis was also applied to 
predict total defects by type. Fishbone diagrams were used to analyze 
potential defect causes. Data collection showed that one of the key pro-
cess variables was the influence of operator knowledge and skills. Several 
experienced operators had developed a “knack” of entering, checking, 
and providing defect-free orders.
Improve
Once this knack was discovered, it was captured, standardized, docu-
mented, and spread throughout the department through a mentoring pro-
gram. Creating standard work enabled the process to initially drop defects 
by 50 percent within the first six months of the project. Key tools utilized 
were control charts, which were used to identify patterns and trends over 
time, and Pareto analysis.
Process specialists were also engaged to determine where additional 
information systems improvements could be made. These individuals 
made many suggestions on ways to mistake-proof the order entry software. 
By engaging the operators in a cross-functional team, specific intelligence 
was built into the software, making it easier to enter the order correctly the 
first time.
Early involvement by the IT organization, establishing a collabora-
tive relationship between IT and the operators, enabled rapid and simple 
enhancements to existing software. Look-up tables and search functions 
were added to the system, which helped order entry operators find key 

Case Studies  •  287
information much easier and faster. IT was also able to add enhancements 
to mistake-proof key error sources in the entry process.
As a result of these efforts, defects have been reduced dramatically. The 
process itself is approaching a 70-percent reduction in defects, moving 
from 0.5 sigma to 3.53 sigma. Customer satisfaction has also improved 
tremendously.
Control
A plan was put into place to help sustain the gains. Improvements in quality, 
stabilization, and consistency enabled the effective use of traditional Lean 
tools for continuous improvement efforts now underway. (See Figure 12.2)
Lessons Learned
Early involvement of IT resources with the inclusion of operators and sup-
port personnel in a combined team effort, was instrumental to our overall 
success. Understanding the process, involving those who work the pro-
cess, and seeking outside advice were vital to making the process better. 
Having the discipline to adhere to the DMAIC method generated signifi-
cant gains, delivering value to our customers.

Steelcase: Product Data Management 
Lean Transformation
Steelcase Inc., headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, leads the world in 
office furniture sales and manufacturing with over US$3 billion in annual 
revenue. One element of our success is a wide offering of products, options, 
and finishes. Supporting this large variety of selections in the company’s 
portfolio (estimated at over 22 quadrillion variations) creates many chal-
lenges throughout the development cycle. The Product Data Management 
(PDM) group is charged with maintaining all of the product information 
within SAP and other supporting systems. The challenges became critical 
when new development projects were delayed because the data could not 
be built fast enough—PDM had become a product development bottleneck.
In 2002, the chief information officer (CIO) appointed a new leadership 
team that recognized the potential to apply Lean concepts from manufac-
turing to solve problems in the PDM office processes. The product data 
responsibilities were originally fragmented across several departments 
which reported to separate leaders. The departments were merged into 
one, but the responsibilities still remained largely within functional silos. 
Then, during a Lean workshop in the spring of 2003, steps of the new prod-
uct development PDM process were posted on a large conference room 
wall. The wall, littered with hundreds of supporting documents, showed 
the complexity of the current state, evidence of rework estimated at 50 
percent, and numerous handoffs resulting in delays while people waited 
for information. The “wall of shame,” as it became known, exposed the 
problems, but they were not solved until value stream mapping techniques 

Case Studies  •  289
documented the current state and envisioned a future state. The future 
state map spawned multiple kaizens, which provided the initiative for 
change. One initial kaizen quickly improved the data building of cus-
tomer service parts, and another addressed the speed and efficiency of 
creating data for a new product that was being designed.
Initial kaizen experiments were designed to avoid batch processing by 
creating cross-functional teams, enabling work to flow across functional 
boundaries. Using the value stream map, handoffs were analyzed, and 
many were eliminated by changing work responsibilities or placing work-
ers in closer proximity. Initial experiments proved successful, revealing 
the need to reorganize the entire PDM department. In May 2004, the 
PDM group restructured to better support the business, dividing into five 
teams to align with the business categories of seating, furniture, work 
tools, wood, and small business furniture. These new PDM teams each 
supported the entire product development process for their category, and 
management accepted new roles in managing across functions instead of 
by expertise. Now, individual experts, resident on each team, create mar-
keting data, edit catalogs and specification guides, and build the man-
ufacturing data. The five teams work in close proximity to each other, 
reporting to a single director, using a common fileshare and intranet, 
and sharing discoveries and improvements with each other. The results 
were rapid and dramatic. Just five months later, the teams eliminated 
the project backlog. Through ongoing kaizens, the PDM group doubled 
their productivity and reduced the lead time from 36 weeks (nearly nine 
months) to just four weeks, removing the bottleneck from the new prod-
uct development process.
Additional kaizens focused on data quality at their source. The teams 
created a checklist for data readiness, determining at what point in the 
product development life cycle data should be loaded into the system 
based on the accuracy of the information provided by the business cat-
egory. The way that data are delivered to the teams is now standard-
ized with a spreadsheet template, used by all marketing personnel across 
the business. By not starting work early, the teams avoid the wastes of 
repeated data changes, delays, and false starts. Management validated 
that the initial rework estimates of 50 percent were accurate. As a result 
of improvements to data quality, rework was reduced to 8 percent, 
which significantly contributed to the teams’ increased productivity and 
throughput.

290  •  Case Studies
A new role, titled the information funnel, now exists on each of the five 
category data teams. The individual fulfilling this role works with other 
departments in engineering and marketing to complete the data readiness 
checklist, also providing valuable project coordination. The information 
funnel role, modeled after the zone leader in a Lean manufacturing cell, 
facilitates a daily team meeting at a visual control board to track the flow 
of data through the process, the production of data in the systems, and any 
flow interrupters within the process.
Initially, all product development projects were scheduled in batch 
mode, and the recurring three-month deadline created a predictable 
and dreaded pinch point. Now the team creates data as soon as they are 
ready, and downstream processes, such as catalog creation and planning 
symbols (used by architects to place furniture in office layouts), naturally 
flow in sequence afterward, leveling the demand and workload. PDM has 
reduced their cycle time by 33 percent, delivering updates at a frequency 
of two months instead of three.
In 2008, the teams turned their attention to the process of building the 
catalog data. The Steelcase product offering is cataloged in over 40 docu-
ments—each several hundred pages in length. Imagine a shelf of encyclo-
pedias from A to Z; this resembles the row of catalogs. They exist in both 
paper (printed annually) and electronic media (updated bimonthly). The 
large quantities of furniture images, product descriptions, and pricing 
in these catalogs are updated and manually synchronized with several 
other data sources, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), cata-
log data, and a catalog-authoring tool (manual integration waste is on 
the list for a future kaizen). Because of the complexity and specializa-
tion of the work to update the catalogs, an outside vendor traditionally 
completed the task. To streamline this process, the teams borrowed the 
concept of a visual heijunka schedule from the manufacturing plants, 
tracking the progression of work through catalog building and releasing 
catalog sections to printing only when they are ready. The heijunka visu-
ally shows the status of each catalog moving through the process, signal-
ing the upstream processes when one completes and the next cycle can 
begin. With the perfected heijunka board in place, the catalog produc-
tion process flows more smoothly, speed and efficiency have increased 
dramatically, and all of the external work has returned inhouse, bring-
ing savings to the bottom line.

Case Studies  •  291
Improvements such as these have generated hard, bottom-line savings 
of over US$3 million just within the PDM group since the start of the 
initiatives. The removal of the PDM bottleneck eased pressure in the new 
product development organization and helped to ensure that products are 
released to market on schedule. Besides monetary savings, every other key 
performance metric improved and the team became a model of a Lean 
transformation within IT and across Steelcase.

Toyota Australia: How IT Helped Implement 
Breakthrough Strategy Management
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia (TMCA) is one of Toyota Japan’s 
global manufacturing centers with a long-term commitment to the domes-
tic and export markets.
TMCA’s head office function and manufacturing and engineering 
activities in Melbourne are complemented by comprehensive sales and 
marketing operations based in Sydney. Additionally, TMCA has sales and 
distribution branches in all mainland Australian states. TMCA employs 
over 4,500 people, and thousands more are employed through its supplier 
and retail networks.
As well as its locally built Camry and Aurion, Toyota imports a wide 
range of passenger, 4WD, and commercial vehicles including the Kluger, 
Yaris, Corolla, Tarago, RAV4, LandCruiser, Prado, HiLux, HiAce, and the 
revolutionary hybrid model Prius. TMCA has also been successful in add-
ing to its local manufacturing capability the Hybrid Camry from 2010.
Toyota is Australia’s largest vehicle exporter, and in 2008 exported 
101,668 cars to over 20 countries worldwide. This strong export drive con-
tributed over AU$1.9 billion (including parts and accessories) in revenue 
for TMCA in 2008. TMCA’s domestic sales in 2008 were 245,000 vehicles 
(including the Lexus). In addition, TMCA distributes and sells the luxury 
Lexus brand of vehicles.

Strategy Management at Toyota Australia
Strategy management is about setting and prioritizing mid- to long-
term management plans and annual targets, while engaging all levels 
of the organization to clarify their own measures and targets. Strategy 
management at Toyota emphasizes the concept of breakthrough 
thinking.
In 2000, TMCA implemented a “whole-of-company” strategy man-
agement process to all 700 executive staff. Over a five-year period, the 
Corporate Strategy Division worked with Board and C-level executives 
and their management teams to create clear corporate goals, long-term 
objectives (two-year fixed, and three-year aspirational), supporting key 
performance indicators (KPIs), and action plans. TMCA did this by com-
bining the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method with Toyota’s best-practice 
processes for continuous improvement, problem solving, and people devel-
opment. At the core of this initiative was a sophisticated end-to-end strat-
egy management process, with significant focus on strategy visualization, 
communication, and execution.
The key challenge faced by Toyota was how to align senior manage-
ment to “breakthrough” corporate strategy so that everybody understood 
their responsibilities and was personally committed to delivering the plan. 
Toyota approached this challenge by implementing a logical and consistent 
process for setting targets, managing initiatives, and rewarding for achieve-
ments at all levels of the company. This process was “visualized” in a simple 
but very effective Online Balanced Scorecard application, which was built 
inhouse as an agile collaboration between Corporate Strategy and IT.
Balanced Scorecard History
Through better strategy management, TMCA aims to be an organization 
which is capable of sustaining high performance, as well as achieving the 
specific results required for TMCA to be what is known in the Toyota 
world as a “self-sustaining” affiliate. To this end, TMCA first deployed the 
Balanced Scorecard as its strategy management tool in 2000. Since that 
time, TMCA’s online strategy management system has:
•	 Increased visibility of strategy: With an Online BSC system composed 
of over 150 integrated scorecards and more than 2,000 targets

Case Studies  •  293
•	 Aligned strategy processes: Using BSC as a “strategy hub” linking 
the president’s goals, the long-term business plan, budgets, the 
individual performance development process, and the short-term 
incentive process
•	 Improved strategic balance: With more emphasis on the “people” 
window
•	 Introduced president’s strategy reviews: Annual visits to each division 
by the president to review BSC performance
•	 Streamlined strategy management process: With the introduction of a 
simple user interface and standard management process, supported 
by a central database and standard reporting and analysis tools, the 
time invested by each employee in the strategy management process 
becomes more focused, leading to improved insights, greater oppor-
tunity to take corrective action or develop emergent strategy, and 
more time to focus on other activities
Evolution of Hoshin Kanri (Breakthrough Strategy Management)
Toyota has a well-documented history of Lean thinking, continuous 
improvement, and people development. As Toyota rapidly expanded in 
the 1990s and 2000s, Toyota’s leaders realized that the transformation 
from an international company into a truly global company required a 
vital reliance on new Toyota employees who had different ways of working 
due to their varied experiences and cultures. The days of Toyota being a 
“Japanese” company were over.
Increasingly, it was necessary to reinforce and reteach the fundamental 
principles that made Toyota such a successful and respected company. To 
achieve that goal, the Toyota Institute was formed in 2001. The Toyota 
Institute’s purpose is to increase the global understanding and applica-
tion of the Toyota Way, through the four components of the Toyota 
Management System:
•	 Toyota Way Foundations: Values, beliefs, and principles such as con-
tinuous improvement, problem solving, respect, and teamwork
•	 Toyota Business Practices: Problem-solving thinking, tools, and 
techniques
•	 Hoshin Kanri: Problem solving applied to the achievement of long-
term “breakthrough” goals

•	 On-the-Job Development: Stretching and growing individual and 
organizational capability
Once the hoshin kanri thinking, tools, and techniques were documented 
and delivered through Toyota Institute training courses (called global con-
tent), each affiliate was expected to integrate the practices into its existing 
business processes.
In 2007, this prompted TMCA to refine existing processes and tools such 
as the president’s goals, the long-term business plan, the Balanced Scorecard, 
and the performance and development process to fit with hoshin kanri 
language, thinking, and principles—supporting the one Toyota global 
standard system for breakthrough strategy and people management.
Importantly, the Balanced Scorecard system used by TMCA was a sys-
tem in the broader sense of the word—covering people, process, informa-
tion, and technology—as the enabler. So the transition to hoshin kanri 
was essentially tweaking the terminology and templates without needing 
to change the underlying philosophies or processes.
So what is hoshin kanri? Hoshin means “direction or needle,” as in a 
compass; and kanri means “management.” So hoshin kanri means “direc-
tion management,” with a focus on “new” or “breakthrough” objectives. 
Hoshin kanri principles are:
•	 Mid- to long-term viewpoint: focus on priority goals
•	 Vertical alignment: unity in direction
•	 Horizontal coordination: ownership by all
•	 Human resources development: people growth through on-the-
job development
•	 Process management: sustained results through Plan-Do-Check-Act 
(PDCA) and problem solving
Evolution of the IT Solution
It required two full years of business process design, redesign, develop-
ment, testing, and continuous improvement to create a company-wide 
process that was ready to be automated in 2002. The solution was devel-
oped internally using existing TMCA IT resources. Balanced Scorecard 
software was available off the shelf in 2002, and most of the existing sys-
tems we examined focused on turning masses of structured data within 

Case Studies  •  295
business core systems into precious gems of strategic insight. But missing 
was a system that was very simple for people to use, and importantly one 
that enabled them to enter their own strategy information—most of which 
was unstructured data (commentary) such as results, successes, struggles, 
countermeasures, and future activities.
For this reason, TMCA committed to the continuing development of 
our own inhouse system, which over time has evolved as a key component 
of our internal management systems and communications. TMCA’s goal 
was to create a strategy management system that would enable knowl-
edge sharing and collaboration rather than a sterile database of highly 
structured data. It had to look and feel “human” or “personalized” to be 
accepted and used by front-line employees.
To build a system that was “human,” it was preferable to use a devel-
opment method that was rapid, flexible, and cost-effective. As the 
architect of the Balanced Scorecard management system was will-
ing and able to be highly involved in the development process, and 
as there was no precedent for the software design, the development 
process followed an agile method. Following many white-boarding 
sessions and design discussions with key stakeholders, the initial ver-
sion of the Online Balanced Scorecard was delivered within 12 weeks. 
Importantly, senior management were shown the first release so they 
could see the working product as soon as possible, helping to build 
understanding and sponsorship for what would become the “corpo-
rate” strategy management application.
It is worth noting that while the Online Balanced Scorecard system was 
regularly enhanced from 2002 to 2006, the core functionality and look 
and feel remained constant for the next five years, demonstrating a key 
Toyota principle of get it right the first time.
In 2007 the Online Balanced Scorecard was renamed the Online Hoshin 
System, and the terminology was aligned to match the Toyota Institute 
training material. For example, business objective descriptions were 
restated in the “Why, What, and How” hoshin format to improve the 
hoshin cascade process, and the column called “Countermeasures/Future 
Activities” was broadened to be “Countermeasures/Future Activities/
Expected Results Next Period” to improve management’s ability to fol-
low up actual versus expected results in the next management meeting 
(PDCA).

296  •  Case Studies
Strategy Management Processes
The Online Hoshin system has two key views:
•	 A “scorecard” containing objectives, measures, targets, and perfor-
mance ratings
•	 A “planning sheet” for each measure containing the initiatives to 
support the measure together with commentary on successes, strug-
gles, countermeasures, etc., and attached supporting data to visual-
ize performance (e.g., graphs, tables, and A3 one-pagers).
The process to build a hoshin scorecard is a combination of Western 
strategy thinking and Japanese Hoshin planning—so it is a good example 
of East meets West. Put simply, the process has five main steps:
Step 1.	 Assess current environment and identify key challenges—stake-
holders; strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT); 
corporate priorities; mission; market and environmental changes; 
vision; and reflection on the previous year’s performance (PDCA).
Step 2.	 Express challenges as “concrete” problems to be addressed, with 
tangible measures and targets.
Step 3.	 Identify root causes of these problems and set countermeasures 
(by whom and by when) to address root causes.
Step 4.	 Capture “problem” measures and targets in hoshin plans at the 
relevant level.
Step 5.	 Capture “countermeasure” or initiative measures and targets in 
hoshin plans at the relevant level.
Spinning wheels normally indicate a lack of traction, but at Toyota it is the 
spinning PDCA wheel that accelerates strategy execution. Throughout all 
steps in this process, there is constant “catchball”; regular use of the sys-
tem encourages and facilitates consensus and understanding, visualiza-
tion, and problem-solving thinking.
If you take a look at the daily and monthly standard management pro-
cesses that support strategy execution, you will see some pretty basic prac-
tices that you would expect any management team to apply. The difference 
with Toyota is that there is a big cycle of PDCA with smaller cycles within 
each phase, as shown in Table 12.1.

One of the greatest challenges with strategy execution is how to make 
the strategy visible, so it can be proactively managed. The Online Hoshin 
System is a key driver of business strategy because it makes it easy for 
everyone from the front line to the executive board to see what the strat-
egy is and how are we doing. The basic question in the strategy game is

“Are we winning?” Toyota leaders and managers alike are always expected 
to know whether or not they are winning—and why.
IT as a Customer of the Hoshin System
With Toyota’s relentless focus on Lean operations, all shared “support” 
functions such as IT are required to argue their case at least annually 
(and more frequently in the current economic climate) for capital fund-
ing, operating funding, and people. Status quo is not the norm—real value 
creation is expected.
One of the greatest challenges any IT operation faces is how to demon-
strate the value that IT brings to the business. In TMCA, IT needs to be a 
true business partner, and one of the simplest but most powerful ways of 
doing that is to start the conversation with the business about their busi-
ness strategy and determine how IT adds value, not just cost.
Understanding the real business priorities builds relationships, trust, 
and confidence. Generally speaking, businesspeople can be cagey about 
their strategy—especially when the questions are coming from a service 
division like IT. So when a business leader is asked, “So—what’s your 
strategy?” a likely response is “Why are you asking?” or even “None of 
your business” or worse.
With access to each division’s hoshin plans, IT (and other service func-
tions) has the information it needs to explain to the business how IT can 
help the business achieve their objectives, without an enormous effort to 
extract the key elements of the strategy from the business leaders. One 
example of this approach is the Hoshin/IT Solution matrix (Table 12.2).
Another example of this approach is the IT Solution Roadmap 
(Table 12.3).
Portfolio Management and Project Prioritization
One way to “balance” the IT portfolio is to allocate the expenditure based 
on generic categories such as run, grow, and transform. Another way is to 
give priority to projects that deliver tangible benefits to a specific hoshin 
strategy. By having a system that “staples” business objectives and KPIs to 
corporate, operating arm, and divisional hoshins, greater priority can be 
given to projects that directly support group strategy.

Case Studies  •  299
Boards and IT investment committees are normally interested in aggre-
gate value for money for IT investment, so it is easier to report investment 
at the rolled-up group hoshin level rather than as a project-by-project frag-
mented view. Having an IT service management approach to organize how 
business objectives combine to support group hoshin enables TMCA’s IT 
division to communicate the value-for-money story at the group, operat-
ing arm, division, or project level.

IT resource planning, loading, and balancing are also made easier by 
aligning and prioritizing the “wish list” projects from the development 
pipeline with specific hoshin plans. A greater focus on projects with tan-
gible benefits that are linked to hoshins assists IT to negotiate for the right 
level of resourcing with the right skills to deliver value back to the company.
It’s Not All about IT
Toyota relies on talented people and good process—not computers—to 
achieve great things. The Online Hoshin System is not a substitute for 
analysis, communication, questions, and answers. It never will be, and it 
is not meant to be. The Online Hoshin System is a tool to help efficiently 
focus the attention of people on what’s important—the strategy, and the 
necessary actions to achieve it. If leaders and managers do not care about 
strategy or are too busy or distracted from strategy, then the information 
technology investment in the planning system will be wasted.
Information technology has a crucial role to play, but it is part of a 
broader mix. The Toyota Way focuses on human interactions—face-to-
face wherever possible. All Toyota people are encouraged to go to the 
gemba (physical workplace) and see, touch, and feel for themselves (genchi 
genbutsu). The principles of teamwork and collaboration are very strongly 
present in the day to day of the Toyota Way.
The TMCA Online Hoshin experience has demonstrated that IT sys-
tems can help busy leaders, managers, and workers come together in a 
constructive way to solve strategic or important problems that are far 
too often hidden by the sheer volume of urgent “daily management” 
activities.

Virginia Mason Medical Center: Laboratory 
Order Process and System Improvement
Background
Virginia Mason is a not-for-profit, integrated health care system with a 336-
bed hospital and nine locations, including the main campus and regional 
centers. More than 450 physicians are on staff, and there are 5,000 employ-
ees. Virginia Mason is also a teaching institution with a robust graduate 
medical education program and a world-class research center.
The health care industry has a defect rate of 3 percent or more, a rate 
unacceptable in any other industry. Defects have a high human cost, and 
they also have a huge business cost. For example, a study in 2000 showed 
that six types of preventable inpatient complications cost US$9 billion 
annually. That’s just the tip of the iceberg.
In 2001, Virginia Mason adopted the Virginia Mason Production 
System (VMPS), a management method that seeks to continually improve 
how work is done to ensure zero defects in the final product. Using this 
method, Virginia Mason (VM) identifies and eliminates waste and inef-
ficiency in the many processes that are part of the health care experience, 
making it possible for VM staff to deliver the highest quality and safest 
patient care. VMPS is based on the Toyota Production System (TPS).
Improving the Laboratory Order Process
In July 2008, stakeholders from the Laboratory and Information Systems 
departments at Virginia Mason met and agreed that improving the pro-
cess for ordering outpatient laboratory tests was crucial. The number 
of Patient Safety Alerts (PSAs) related to orders for tests was climbing. 
(PSAs are part of a system at Virginia Mason that empowers all staff 
to report situations that do, or might, put a patient at risk of harm.) 
Although several creative steps were implemented to mistake-proof the 
current ordering process, errors continued to slip through, and the teams 
trying to improve this process felt that the continuing errors occurred 
due to inherent defects embedded in the design of the system. The long-
term solution would be the implementation of a computerized provider 
order entry (CPOE) system. That, however, was still some years away 

302  •  Case Studies
due to capital and resource constraints. In addition, parts of the current 
information system in use were scheduled to be phased out. As a result, 
it was decided to design and implement an interim test-ordering process 
that could minimize ordering errors and at the same time streamline 
the current order process. It was understood that this interim process 
would not delay in any way the future implementation of CPOE in the 
ambulatory setting.
Using VMPS tools, the IT department and the laboratory together 
conducted a root cause analysis to document exactly where and why 
the current process and system were failing, and to understand what an 
ideal interim process (until CPOE was implemented) might look like. 
The root cause analysis found a process riddled with defects leading to 
the PSAs:
•	 Lost orders, double orders, defective orders, and illegible orders
•	 Patients arriving without orders
•	 Orders that were not executed, making it necessary to call patients 
back to the lab
•	 No coherent, consistent method for performing laboratory order sur-
veillance, or for verifying if and when patients had the tests ordered 
by their doctor
•	 Cumbersome process for identifying expired orders and notifying 
provider of expirations
The laboratory test–ordering process consisted of e-mail order forms 
delivered via Virginia Mason’s intranet, and paper forms completed by 
doctors and carried to the laboratory by the patient. The information on 
the paper form was manually entered into the electronic laboratory system 
by staff when the patient arrived. Paper forms make errors more likely (due 
to being incomplete, incorrect, illegible, etc), and reentering data is time 
consuming, causing delays, and is a recipe for mistakes. Orders arriving 
via e-mail were usually for tests to be done in the future, typically before 
the patient’s next appointment.
While e-mail programs help with the message transport, they are not 
designed to enable this sort of workflow process. For example, the weak 
search function in the e-mail program, combined with the number of 
destination mailboxes, made it difficult to find orders for patients com-
ing in for tests, as well as future orders, duplicate orders, and expired 

Case Studies  •  303
orders. For every patient who presented for tests, laboratory reception 
staff throughout VM’s clinic system had to search through thousands of 
orders in every downtown and satellite online order group e-mail box. 
This search process was extremely cumbersome, time consuming, and 
prone to errors. In addition, a staff member sorted through orders every 
day to identify the 100–150 orders that had expired. This required search-
ing through 26 separate folders in a group e-mail box and forwarding the 
expired orders to the originating department. Figuring out where to send 
the orders often depended on tribal knowledge rather than information 
contained within the order documents themselves. Once the provider’s 
office received notification of expired orders, the physician determined 
if the order should be resubmitted, which required rework on the part of 
the physician to notify the patient and resubmit the orders.
During the current state assessment, it also became clear that the 
paper-based part of the system was extremely wasteful: 500,000 paper 
orders were generated annually. Regulations require that seven years of 
paper orders (3.5 million paper records) had to be stored off-site at any 
given time. These records needed to be boxed, labeled, moved, arranged, 
archived, tracked, occasionally searched and copied, and finally moved 
again for disposal—causing tremendous labor and environmental waste. 
The reduction and eventual elimination of the paper system also became 
an important goal for the team.
These software design and paper flow issues were exacerbated by human 
ones: typing errors, accidental deletions, and failure to reschedule tests 
when an appointment was changed, demonstrating a lack of standard 
work in the overall process. Simple mistakes by staff and patients, as well as 
poor process design and software weaknesses, caused delays and rework, 
ultimately putting patients at risk.
Solution Called for Collaboration
Following the root cause analysis, definition of requirements, and dis-
cussion of the lab’s needs, information systems staff recommended that 
the pre-CPOE interim solution should be based on a relational database 
structure, so that it could effectively search, sort, manage workflow, pre-
vent common data entry errors, assist with queuing and scheduling, and 
securely support this high-volume activity across multiple locations. IT 

304  •  Case Studies
developed such a database to document, communicate, store, and search 
orders. They knew, however, that the database alone was not the solu-
tion. IT and the laboratory invited the Kaizen Promotion Office (KPO) 
to participate in defining an optimal business process for laboratory 
test ordering. (KPO is responsible for guiding work using the Virginia 
Mason Production System.)
KPO set up a one-day kaizen event in April 2009 to do this work. The 
team included staff from the laboratory, IT, general internal medicine, and 
other areas. The task was to define the current process and how the future 
state should work, resulting in the ideal system functionality. This voice 
of the customer exercise illustrated what patients, providers, support staff, 
and the laboratory needed the system to do for them. Developers then cre-
ated a working prototype of the new system, which the users then tested 
against these criteria to be certain it could receive all laboratory orders 
submitted online, track when tests were drawn, and alert clinical staff 
when surveillance was needed.
After a 90-day IT development cycle with frequent laboratory depart-
ment input, a one-week Rapid Process Improvement Workshop (RPIW) 
was held in July to make refinements and corrections and to plan the roll-
out of this new ordering system. During the week, the team designed the 
actual process that physicians and staff would use to place an ambulatory 
order using the new online process. They also addressed the patient flow 
from the placement of the order through patient arrival at the laboratory 
for their blood draw. Patients now simply report to the laboratory, where 
their electronic orders are retrieved by the receptionist, tube labels are 
printed, and the patient’s blood is drawn. This new process was imple-
mented less than 90 days later with no significant challenges. Further 
IT testing and exploration will track whether the system is working as 
designed—a crucial element in all VMPS work (Plan-Do-Check-Act, 
PDCA).
A member of the IT team estimated that involvement of KPO and 
use of VMPS tools may have saved as much as two months of work 
by IT analysts, as the new system was designed, built, and tested in 
an iterative fashion with frequent customer input. Two positions in the 
laboratory were reassigned to more pressing patient care duties because 
the time-consuming and non-value-added online order-tracking and 
sorting work no longer was needed. In addition, paper generation 
and storage costs were reduced due to the paperless nature of the new 

Case Studies  •  305
electronic ordering system As a result of this implementation, the labo-
ratory gained much needed efficiency in how orders are processed upon 
patient arrival. The two freed full-time employees were redeployed to 
much needed phlebotomy duties, which decreased the need to hire 
additional staff, thus keeping their operating margin intact. The labo-
ratory is also closely monitoring error rates, using the new system, to 
assure that the process changes are successful.
It should be noted that post rollout, the original RPIW team met sev-
eral times and continued to refine the process, making changes that fur-
ther improved efficiencies both in the physician’s and medical assistant’s 
process and in the laboratory processes. This work continues today.
The work described here is a fairly simple example of the power of the 
improvement system pioneered by Toyota and now in use at Virginia 
Mason. The team consisted of staff who actually use the laboratory order 
system, including doctors, VMPS specialists, IT analysts, and others. This 
diversity brought together a wide range of experience and ideas and allowed 
the team to gain a thorough understanding of the functions needed and to 
test ideas in the real world before deciding on a solution.

Appendix A: A Brief History 
of Continuous Improvement
The birth of modern-day continuous improvement began at the turn 
of the twentieth century during the Industrial Revolution.* An indus-
trial engineer, Frederick Taylor, developed techniques to identify the 
variables impacting a specific task, thereby defining the most efficient 
way to perform that task. During the same period, Frank and Lillian 
Gilbreth introduced time and motion studies, significantly reducing 
production time. Then in 1908, Henry Ford incorporated process flow, 
interchangeable parts, and standard work to support the first conveyor-
driven assembly line to produce the Model T.†
This innovative period of scientific management led to significant 
gains in productivity by applying standardized methods, simplified 
work, and division of labor. However, workers often found the simpli-
fied, repetitive work dull and meaningless. The scientific approach was 
highly efficient but only engaged people’s hands and not their minds, 
causing quality problems, poor morale, absenteeism, and management–
labor conflict.
In the 1920s, Dr. Walter Shewhart of Bell Telephone Laboratories 
broke new ground by applying statistical analysis to control process 
variation, revealing how deviations in a production process caused 
irregularity in product quality—a major paradigm shift at the time it 
was introduced.
During World War II, the U.S. Department of War instituted Training 
within Industry (TWI) to accelerate war production. (For more information 
on TWI, see ἀe TWI Workbook: Essential Skills for Supervisors by Patrick 
Graupp and Robert Wrona.1) TWI introduced standardized job instruction, 
productivity-driven problem solving, supervisor training, worker safety, 
*	 Lean can be traced even further back in history, to the mid-1500s in Venice, where standard 
design, standard production processes, and interchangeable parts were used to flow the produc-
tion of hundreds of warships (galleys). In 1793, Eli Whitney applied interchangeable parts to his 
revolutionary invention, the cotton gin, giving birth to the concept of mass production.

and ongoing improvement programs that accelerated output and enhanced 
quality. These programs were shared with European and Asian countries to 
support the reconstruction effort.
Postwar Japan was in short supply of capital, materials, and labor. To 
make matters worse, their products were perceived as cheap, low-qual-
ity imitations by consumers throughout the world. In 1950, the Japanese 
Union of Scientists and Engineers invited several quality experts from the 
United States to visit and share their expertise. Among them was Dr. W. 
Edwards Deming, who suggested that Japanese industry could turn around 
their quality issues and become competitive in five years. The Japanese 
embraced Deming’s ideas of quality and process improvement, helping 
them to achieve significant gains in only four years, though competitive-
ness with the Western industrial nations was still many years away.
Although Deming did not introduce the term Total Quality Management 
(TQM)* in his classic book Out of the Crisis,2 many of the fundamental 
ideas of TQM are contained within it. The essence of Deming’s work is 
contained in 14 principles:
	
1.	Create a constancy of purpose.
	
2.	Adopt the new philosophy (a new way of thinking about running 
your business).
	
3.	Cease dependence on mass inspection.
	
4.	End lowest tender contracts (do not award business based on price 
alone).
	
5.	Improve every process.
	
6.	Institute training on the job.
	
7.	Institute leadership.
	
8.	Drive out fear.
	
9.	Break down barriers.
	 10.	Eliminate exhortations (slogans).
	 11.	Eliminate arbitrary numerical targets (quotas).
	 12.	Support pride of workmanship.
	 13.	Encourage education.
	 14.	Develop top management commitment and action.
*	 Total Quality Management (TQM) refers to the quality improvement discipline founded on the 
ideas of Deming, Juran, and Feigenbaum, stressing that quality must be actively managed by 
focusing on customer needs and engaging all employees.

Appendix A: A Brief History of Continuous Improvement  •  309
Deming, with influence from his mentor Shewhart, also promoted the 
Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)* cycle of problem solving.
In 1951, Armand Feigenbaum pioneered the concept of Total Quality 
Control in Quality Control: Principles, Practice, and Administration.3 
Feigenbaum stressed quality as defined by the customer, and as a fun-
damental management philosophy. He also introduced the idea of cost of 
quality,† suggesting that the cost of maintaining high quality is offset by 
reducing the costs of poor quality.
Joseph Juran made significant contributions to quality management, 
also emphasizing the human element of quality (employee resistance to 
change), the need for management training, and the application of qual-
ity management to functional areas beyond manufacturing. (See Juran’s 
Managerial Breakthrough and Juran on Quality by Design.)4 Juran also 
presented to the Japanese Union of Scientists and Engineers in 1954 and 
was a major influence on management training in Japan throughout the 
1950s and 1960s.
The principles and tools articulated by Deming, Juran, and Feigenbaum, 
which later came to be known as Total Quality Management, formed the 
foundation of Lean and Six Sigma.
By the mid-1950s, many Japanese companies had embraced the 
Quality Movement, none more than Toyota. Kiichiro Toyoda, then 
president of Toyota Motor Corporation, had been influenced by Henry 
Ford’s writings.5 He planted the seeds of the Toyota Production System 
(TPS) in the 1930s by introducing flow-style production, worker train-
ing, and a revised factory layout. His cousin, Eiji Toyoda, toured U.S. 
factories in 1951, spending three weeks at Ford Motor Company; Eiji 
returned to Japan with a vision. Ford’s plants were models of efficiency; 
however, they were only capable of producing one product. Every 
Model T was virtually identical. Ford eventually lost market share to 
General Motors because of its inability to address both volume and 
product variety.
*	 Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) is a structured approach to problem solving which applies the scien-
tific method: observation, development of a tentative description of cause and effect (hypothesis), 
prediction, testing, and evaluation. Also known as Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA). For a discussion 
of PDCA, see Appendix B.
†	Cost of quality includes the costs of prevention, appraisal, and internal and external failure.

310  •  Appendix A: A Brief History of Continuous Improvement
Toyoda believed that it was possible to achieve both flow and product 
variety without sacrificing time, quality, or cost. At Toyota,* these con-
cepts were first applied in 1951 by Taiichi Ohno, a machine shop manager 
who would later become a Toyota executive vice president. Over the next 
25 years, Ohno worked with Shigeo Shingo, an industrial engineering 
consultant, pioneering approaches for waste elimination, flow, visibility, 
structured training, just-in-time production, workplace organization, and 
standard work. Shingo is credited with documenting Toyota’s improve-
ment procedures, which later became known as the Toyota Production 
System (TPS).
The focus on quality improvement continued in Japan throughout the 
1960s and into the 1970s, when the OPEC oil embargo suddenly plunged 
the Japanese economy into crisis, sending Western consumers scram-
bling for fuel-efficient vehicles. Among the major companies in Japan, 
Toyota was one of the few to make a profit during this time. Beginning 
in the 1970s, companies from all over the world started touring Japanese 
plants (particularly Toyota) attempting to discover what they were doing 
right.
The term Total Quality Management was first used by the U.S. Navy 
in 1984 to describe the Japanese-style management approach to qual-
ity improvement. TQM focused on holistic quality themes, including 
employee involvement, continuous improvement, a focus on customer 
requirements, and quality management within daily work. Many of these 
concepts were developed in parallel with the principles and tools Toyota 
had developed over the past 30 years.
During this period, another field of process improvement emerged, the 
ἀeory of Constraints (TOC). In 1984 Dr. Eli Goldratt introduced the con-
cept of managing the pace of production and supporting process improve-
ments around constraints (bottlenecks) in his landmark novel, ἀe Goal.6 
The premise of TOC is that productivity is improved as a result of iden-
tifying and managing bottlenecks as pacemakers to regulate production. 
By eliminating constraints, the speed at which information and materials 
move is increased, improving quality, cycle time, customer satisfaction, 
and cash flow.
*	 Modern-day Toyota Motor Corporation began in 1933 as a department of Toyoda Automatic 
Loom Works focused on the production of engines and then automobiles under the direction of 
the founder’s son, Kiichiro Toyoda. Toyota Motor Corporation was established as an independent 
company in 1937.

Six Sigma emerged in the 1980s; its well-publicized success at large com-
panies such as Motorola, Allied Signal, and General Electric created broad 
interest. Many organizations aspired to increase profits by improving 
their quality to a Six-Sigma level (3.4 defects per million), investing heav-
ily in training and creating an internal resource pool of specialized green 
and black belts. Six Sigma created a rigorous data-driven methodology to 
link improvement activities with bottom-line financial results. (See also 
Appendix B on Six Sigma and Lean.)
During the 1980s, Japanese automakers’ quality and market share con-
tinued to improve. The Sloan* Foundation funded a five-year, US$2 mil-
lion study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, resulting in the 
1990 publication of ἀe Machine ἀat Changed the World by Womack, 
Jones, and Roos.7 This landmark book explained the principles behind 
the Toyota Production System, and coined the term Lean. Then in 1996, 
Womack and Jones published Lean ἀinking,8 introducing a five-step pro-
cess for Lean improvement:
	
1.	Specify value from the perspective of the end customer.
	
2.	Identify all the steps in the value stream, eliminating those activities, 
processes, and policies that do not create value.
	
3.	Flow products and service smoothly toward the customer.
	
4.	Let the customer demand pull value from the next upstream 
activity.
	
5.	Pursue perfection through continuous improvement.
From a broad perspective, continuous improvement began with a scien-
tific focus on efficiency and then shifted to a humanistic focus on creat-
ing quality through respect for people. What Deming, Juran, Feigenbaum, 
Ohno, Shingo, and others discovered was that significant lasting improve-
ment is achieved by engaging the hearts and minds of everyone in the 
organization. As continuous improvement methodologies evolve, they 
adopt new names and tools: Total Quality Management, Toyota Production 
System, Lean Manufacturing, Lean Office, Theory of Constraints, Six 
Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, and so on. Whatever the label, these disciplines 
are all natural advancements of process improvement and quality man-
agement principles and tools that have evolved over the past 100 years or

these improvement methods are complementary, comprising a rich collec-
tion of ideas to be drawn upon where appropriate.

Appendix B: How Lean and 
Six Sigma Work Together
Six Sigma is a process improvement methodology emphasizing data 
analysis with a primary objective of reducing process variation to improve 
quality. The Greek letter sigma (σ) represents variability. The sigma level of 
a process indicates the probability of defects; the higher the sigma level, the 
more stable and reliable the process and the lower the likelihood of defects. 
A process functioning at a Six-Sigma level equates to 3.4 defects per 1 mil-
lion opportunities, which is equivalent to 99.9997 percent defect-free work. 
As sigma levels increase, there is less need for inspection, testing, and 
rework, which reduces costs while improving cycle times and customer 
satisfaction.* Six Sigma and Lean share many similarities: both seek to 
establish ongoing continuous improvement, focus on delivering customer-
defined value, and pursue the reduction of non-value-added work. They 
also apply a disciplined closed-loop† improvement methodology.
The improvement methodology used in Six Sigma is DMAIC (pro-
nounced dee-may-ik), which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, 
and control.
DMAIC is a structured approach which begins with the define step, which 
typically includes a comprehensive project charter.‡ During the measure-
ment stage, current-state processes are identified and investigated, baseline 
data are gathered, and process mapping is often performed. Metrics used 
to determine the effectiveness of current processes are also developed.
In the analyze stage, the process is examined for sources of variation 
and wasteful non-value-added activity in order to identify opportunities 
*	 For a comprehensive review of Six Sigma, see Six Sigma Demystified by Paul Keller. For a brief but 
thorough overview, see The Lean Six Sigma Pocket Toolbook by George et al.
†	A closed-loop feedback system provides information on the effectiveness of a process by supplying 
output information on quality, time, cost, variability, or other criteria. The information is used to 
make improvements to the system as conditions change.
‡	The project charter includes a problem statement, project objectives and anticipated results, scope, 
stakeholders, sponsor, team members, resource requirements, metrics, and project milestone 
dates. Project scope defines the project’s boundaries: what will be addressed and what will be 
excluded.

314  •  Appendix B: How Lean and Six Sigma Work Together
for improvement. During the improvement phase, new processes are 
developed, implemented, and tested to ensure they function as planned. 
Finally, during the control phase, improved processes are documented 
and workers are trained in new standard work practices. Lessons learned 
are captured, and controls put into place to monitor changes, creating a 
feedback loop for ongoing improvement, verifying results, and tracking 
financial returns. At the conclusion of the project, a formal report out is 
presented to a steering team or senior management, and results are evalu-
ated against the anticipated outcomes defined in the project charter.
In contrast, Lean applies the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)* cycle 
improvement methodology. During the planning stage, a draft A3† 
problem summary is prepared and presented to a steering team or proj-
ect sponsor for approval. Usually, Lean improvements do not require 
a formal project charter beyond an A3. During the development of 
the A3, the team asks, “What is happening and what should be hap-
pening?” Specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound 
(SMART) targets are developed to measure baseline performance and 
later the impact of process improvements. During the do stage, the 
team analyzes the current state (often using value stream mapping) 
identifies value-added and non-value-added work, isolates root causes 
of problems, gathers baseline data, and develops, prioritizes, and tests 
potential countermeasures. The most promising countermeasures are 
selected for implementation.
During the check step, results are compared with the SMART targets 
to determine the effectiveness of the improvements. Finally, during the 
act stage, if the results are acceptable, the improved process and support-
ing metrics are put into practice and become the new standard work. 
Employees are then trained in the new procedures. However, if the results 
indicate that the countermeasures are inadequate, an adjustment‡ needs 
to be made based on the results and the team enters into another round 
of problem solving—the hypothesis has been disproven and the PDCA 
cycle begins anew. At the conclusion of each PDCA cycle, a report out is 
provided to the steering team or project sponsor.
*	 A variant of this is Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), also known as the Shewhart cycle, Deming cycle, 
or Deming wheel.
†	See Chapter 2 for a discussion of the A3 thinking process and Appendix D for a sample A3.
‡	Some Lean practitioners like to say the A in PDCA stands for adjust. This implies a more active 
role in assessing results of countermeasures and responding appropriately.

Appendix B: How Lean and Six Sigma Work Together  •  315
Focus
DMAIC and PDCA are equally effective process improvement method-
ologies. While DMAIC offers a more formal project deployment model 
applying additional rigor in the define stage, PDCA is a very effective 
problem-solving method that can be applied with less formality and over-
head. Both have their appropriate place in continuous improvement and 
should be chosen according to the scope, cost, complexity, and risk of the 
undertaking.
A major difference between Lean and Six Sigma is their principal focus: 
Six Sigma emphasizes quality through controlling process variation, while 
Lean’s primary focus is flow attained from eliminating non-value-added 
activities (waste). In most organizations, the vast majority of improvement 
opportunities are found in wasteful business processes. It is not surprising 
that many companies discover that focusing on waste (not process varia-
tion) is the best place to begin their improvement efforts. Lean quickly 
prepares organizations to address obvious low-hanging fruit improvement 
opportunities that are relatively easy to achieve and deliver a noticeable 
impact. Harvesting these opportunities creates early wins, preparing 
employees for more challenging projects.
After non-value-added activities are removed from a process, it is easier 
to identify high-value problems deserving rigorous attention.
Roles
In Six Sigma, projects are typically led by certified black belts and staffed 
with green belts.* Specialists drive improvement activity and are thoroughly 
trained in improvement tools and methods. However, the people closest to the 
work may lack a sense of ownership and responsibility to solve problems while 
waiting for the Six Sigma experts to arrive (generally speaking, Six Sigma 
*	 Black belt and green belt are Six Sigma designations. Black belts have traditionally completed 
advanced training (4–6 months) and successfully completed two large-dollar-value projects. They 
provide training and mentoring to green belts and other employees. Black belts work full time on 
Six Sigma projects. Green belts have received basic training in Six Sigma (often 5 days) and support 
black belts by providing project facilitation and guidance. Certification is offered by a number of 
professional organizations, universities, and private companies. 

316  •  Appendix B: How Lean and Six Sigma Work Together
usually engages about 30–40 percent of the workforce). In Lean, all employees 
are trained in basic improvement skills and are expected to take an active role 
in daily improvement and problem solving. Because Lean is generally more 
intuitive and less quantitative, the tools and methods are often perceived as 
common sense and less intimidating to employees. In some organizations, 
Lean is perceived as being more accessible, engaging the entire workforce.
Project Size and Duration
Lean improvement activity, called kaizen,* ranges in duration from a 
few hours to a few months, while the typical Six Sigma project lasts from 
three to nine months. Kaizen events are focused short-term improvement 
efforts that typically involve a cross-functional team and several weeks 
of preparation followed by a week of PDCA activity. Kaizen also occurs 
on an as-needed basis as problems and improvement opportunities are 
encountered. These daily kaizen are short, focused improvements last-
ing just a few minutes or a few hours. Some Lean efforts require more 
than a week to execute. These kaizen projects can last from several weeks 
to several months. Generally speaking, Six Sigma projects take longer to 
complete than Lean projects due to the effort invested in formal project 
management (e.g., project charters), data sampling, and analysis. Lean is 
about hitting frequent base hits, while Six Sigma strives for home runs.†
Project Selection
Because Six Sigma projects make use of trained black belts (a finite 
resource), projects are limited. Six Sigma projects are regulated based 
on alignment with organizational goals, risk, and return on investment 
(ROI). It is not uncommon for Six Sigma projects to target annualized 
*	 Kaizen is ongoing continuous improvement of a value stream (system kaizen) or a single process 
(process kaizen). In general, system kaizen is the primary focus of management, while process 
kaizen is the responsibility of associates formed into teams.

Imai.

returns of $150,000 or greater. With Lean, the emphasis is on continuous 
improvement occurring throughout the organization on an ongoing basis; 
focus shifts from a few carefully chosen large projects to an unlimited 
cycle of incremental improvement activities. Occasionally, Lean improve-
ments include large-scale projects representing radical, even revolutionary 
change—called Kaikaku.*
Complementary Coexistence
Can Lean and Six Sigma coexist in one organization? Absolutely! Many 
companies today have a Lean Six Sigma program. In the final analysis, 
Six Sigma and Lean complement each other by providing the tools and 
methods necessary for sustained improvement throughout the enterprise. 
Our experience shows that Lean is often the entry point due to its pri-
mary focus on waste, low initial startup costs, company-wide participa-
tion, and rapid results. Initial Lean efforts often focus on achieving quick 
wins. These early successes foster support and enthusiasm for additional 
improvement efforts. Once the initial gains have been realized, companies 
recognize the need to address more challenging constraints and process 
variation. These complex problems often require disciplined analysis and 
formal project management. This is where Six Sigma provides the quanti-
tative tools and thorough deployment methodology needed.
On the other hand, several of our clients began their journey with Six 
Sigma, finding the structure, discipline, and focus a good fit with their 
established culture. After they successfully created a foundation of con-
tinuous improvement with Six Sigma, they expanded the effort to all 
associates by introducing Lean to the rest of the company. Lean became 
the general approach to improvement, while Six Sigma was applied when 
specifically suited to the problem at hand. Whether your organization 
embarks on its process improvement journey by employing Lean or Six 
Sigma, it is important to understand that both these improvement meth-
odologies are complementary and have their appropriate place.
*	 Kaikaku is breakthrough and radical improvement (initiated by senior management), as con-
trasted with kaizen, which is gradual, continuous, and often initiated by the people closest to the 
work.

About the Authors
Steve Bell and Mike Orzen are pioneers in Lean IT, with management con-
sulting experience in various industries, including global logistics, medi-
cal devices, food and beverage, aerospace, software development, financial 
services, health care, and nonprofits.
Through many years of hands-on experience assisting their clients with 
large-scale IT projects, the authors realized that effective change had to be 
based first on improving underlying business processes before technol-
ogy could make a positive impact. In the proving ground of IT project 
implementation, they discovered how to effectively apply the principles 
and tools of Lean and Six Sigma to IT efforts across many industries.
Steve and Mike are cofounders of the management consulting firm 
Steady Improvement, Inc. (www.steadyimprovement.com), and are on the 
faculty of the Lean Enterprise Institute (www.lean.org).
Steve Bell, CFPIM, brings over 20 years of 
experience in information systems, opera-
tions, and finance. Steve is the author of 
Lean Enterprise Systems: Using IT for 
Continuous Improvement, published in 
2006 by John R Wiley, which was nomi-
nated for the 2007 Shingo Prize Research 
Award.
Mike Orzen, CMA, CFPIM, PMP, 
delivers a unique blend of IT, opera-
tions management, Lean, Six Sigma, 
and project management. With a BA 
from Stanford in economics and an 
MBA from the University of Oregon,
