DEDICATION
In Memory of Donald R. LaTorre
Dr. Don LaTorre’s love for students and vision for improving their ability to comprehend and use 
mathematics was instrumental in bringing a fresh, innovative teaching approach into the Business Calculus
classrooms of Clemson University. His enthusiasm for this approach provided inspiration to the author team
to prepare the materials used at Clemson University to be written in a form that could be used at other 
institutions and which was published as the Preliminary Edition of Calculus Concepts.

Preface
Philosophy
This book presents an intuitive approach to the concepts of calculus for students in fields such as
business, economics, liberal arts, management, and the social and life sciences. It is appropriate
for courses generally known as “brief calculus” or “applied calculus.”
The authors’ overall goal is to improve learning of basic calculus concepts by involving stu-
dents with new material in a way that is different from traditional practice. The development of
conceptual understanding coupled with a commitment to making calculus meaningful to the stu-
dent were guiding principles during the writing of this text. This material presents many applica-
tions of real situations through its data-driven, technology-based modeling approach. The ability
to interpret the mathematics of real-life situations correctly is considered of equal importance to
the understanding of the concepts of calculus.
Fourfold Viewpoint Complete understanding of the concepts is enhanced and emphasized by
the continual use of the fourfold viewpoint: numeric, algebraic, verbal, and graphical.
Data-Driven Many everyday, real-life situations involving change are quantified numerically and
presented in tables of data. Such situations often can be represented by continuous mathematical
models so that the concepts, methods, and techniques of calculus can be used to analyze the
change.
The use of real data and the search for appropriate models also expose students to the reality
of uncertainty. Sometimes there can be more than one appropriate model, and answers derived
from models are only approximations. Exposure to the possibility of more than one correct
approach or answer is valuable.
Modeling Approach Modeling is considered to be an important tool and is introduced at the
outset. Both linear and nonlinear models of discrete data are used to describe the relationships
between variables of interest. The functions given by the models are the ones used by students to
conduct their investigations of calculus concepts. Most students feel it is the connection to real-
life data that shows the relevance of the mathematics in this course and adds reality to the topics
studied.
Interpretation Emphasis This book differs from traditional texts not only in its philosophy but
also in its overall focus, level of activities, development of topics, and attention to detail. Interpretation
of results is a key feature of this text that allows students to make sense of the mathematical concepts
and appreciate the usefulness of those concepts in their future careers and in their lives.
Informal Style Although the authors appreciate the formality and precision of mathematics,
they also recognize that this alone can deter some students from access to mathematics. Thus they

have sought to make this presentation as informal as possible by using nontechnical terminology
where appropriate and a less formal style of presentation.
Pedagogical Features
•
Chapter Opener Each chapter opens with a real-life situation and several questions about
the situation that relate to the key concepts in the chapter.
•
Chapter Outline An outline of section titles appears on the first page of each chapter.
•
Examples and Quick Examples Each section incorporates short concept development nar-
ratives interspersed with quick examples highlighting specific skills and formal examples
illustrating the application of the skills and concepts in a real-world setting.
•
Concept Inventory A concept inventory listed at the end of each section gives a brief sum-
mary of the major ideas developed in that section.
•
Section Activities The activities at the end of each section allow students to explore the
concepts presented in that section using, for the most part, actual data in a variety of real-
world settings. Questions and interpretations pertinent to the data and the concepts are
included in these activities. The activities do not mimic the examples in the chapter discus-
sion and thus require more independent thinking on the part of the students. Answers to
odd activities are given at the end of the book. The authors consider Writing Across the
Curriculum to be important, so activities are designed to encourage students to communi-
cate in written form.
•
Chapter Summary A chapter summary connects the results of the chapter topics and fur-
ther emphasizes the importance of knowing these results.
•
Concept Check A check list is included at the end of each chapter, summarizing the main
concepts and skills taught in the chapter along with sample odd activities corresponding to
each item in the list. The sample activities are to help students assess their understanding of
the chapter content and identify areas on which to focus their study.
•
Review Activities An activity section at the end of each chapter provides review of and
additional practice applying the concepts and skills presented in that chapter.
Content Changes in the Fifth Edition
This new edition contains pedagogical changes intended to improve the presentation and flow of
the concepts discussed. It contains many new examples and activities. In addition, many data sets
have been updated to include more recent data.
Three important pedagogical and context changes included in this edition are the restructur-
ing of presentation, the rewriting of narrative, and the reworking of activity sets.
Restructuring The primary goal of restructuring the presentation is to make (as much as possible)
each section teachable in one 50-minute class period. The concept of limits is introduced early in
Chapter 1 and used throughout the discussion of models in the remainder of that chapter as well as
being recalled to describe differentiation and integration. The presentation of sine models has been

incorporated as optional sections or activities throughout the text rather than as a self-contained
chapter. Differential equations and slope fields are introduced as a pair of optional sections at the
end of the integration chapters.
Rewriting The text has been carefully rewritten so that narrative sections are shorter and more
concise. Although real-world context is still used as the platform for most of the discussion, dis-
tracting elements of the context have been set to the side in marginal notes. Definitions and other
important mathematical elements are highlighted in boxes for easy reference, and certain mathe-
matical or interpretation skills are illustrated in the Quick Example feature.
Reworking Each activity set has been reworked to incorporate an orderly development of the
skills and concepts presented in that section. Even-numbered activities reflect but are not neces-
sarily identical to odd-numbered activities. Many activities have been rewritten to be more stu-
dent-friendly. Some activities have been replaced by more appropriate or up-to-date applications.
All solutions have been reworked, and answers have been rewritten to be concise. Activities requir-
ing essay-style answers are clearly marked.
Technology as a Tool
Graphing Calculators and Spreadsheets Calculus has traditionally relied upon a high level of alge-
braic manipulation. However, many students who are required to take applied calculus courses are
not strong in algebraic skills, and an algebra-based approach tends to stifle their progress. Today’s
easy access to technology in the forms of graphing calculators and computers breaks down barriers
to learning imposed by the traditional reliance on algebraic methods. It creates new opportunities
for learning through graphical and numerical representations.
This text requires students to use graphical representations freely, make numerical calculations
routinely, and find functions to fit data. Thus, immediate and continual access to technology is essen-
tial. Because of their low cost, portability, and ability to personalize the mathematics, the use of graph-
ing calculators or laptop computers with software such as Microsoft® Excel® is appropriate.
Resources for Instructors
The Instructor’s Annotated Edition is the text with margin notes from the authors to instruc-
tors. The notes contain explanations of content or approach, teaching ideas, indications of where
a topic appears in later chapters, indications of topics that can be easily omitted or streamlined,
warnings of areas of likely difficulty for students, based on the authors’ years of experience teach-
ing with Calculus Concepts, and references to topics in the Instructor’s Resource Manual that
might be helpful. ISBN: 0538735597

CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The primary goal of this book is to help you understand the two fundamental concepts of
calculus—the derivative and the integral—in the context of the mathematics of change. This first
chapter is a study of the key ingredients of change: functions, mathematical models, and limits.
Models provide the basis for analyzing change in the world around us. Functions allow us to
describe and to quantify the relation between quantities that vary.
Chapter 1 also introduces the concept that sets calculus apart from other branches of mathe-
matics: the limit. The concept of limits is introduced as it relates to the end behavior of functions.
1.1
Functions—Four Representations
Calculus is the study of change—how things change and how quickly they change. We begin
the study of calculus by considering ways to describe change. Information is available
on demand and delivered in multiple ways including print, online, television, and cell
phone. Whatever the medium, change is represented by numbers in a table of data, by a
graph, or with a verbal description. Change is also described mathematically using variables
and equations.
Representations of Change
Most of the mathematical formulas considered in this text can be viewed from each of four
perspectives:
•
Numerically
•
Algebraically
•
Verbally
•
Graphically
A situation that affects nearly all of us is the price of gas. The price of gas can be represented in
several ways:
Numerically as in Table 1.1:
Verbally: The price at the pump for gasoline is $4.114 per gallon times the number of gallons
pumped.

1.1
Functions—Four Representations
3
Graphically as in Figure 1.1:
Algebraically: The expression
gives the price for g gallons of gasoline.
Even though each of the four representations adds a different facet to the understand-
ing of the situation it describes, only the algebraic and the graphical representations
allow us to apply calculus to analyze change. The process of translating a real-world
problem into a usable mathematical equation is called mathematical modeling, and the
equation (with the variables described in the context) is referred to as a model.
Functions
A relation (or rule) links one variable, called an input, to a second variable, called an output. The
relation defining the price paid at the pump for gasoline links the amount of gasoline pumped,
input, to the price paid for that amount of gasoline, output. This relation is an example of a func-
tion because each input produces exactly one output. If any particular input produces more than
one output, the relation is not a function.
f  4.114g dollars
Function Output from Different Perspectives
The way to find the output that corresponds to a known input depends on the way the function
is represented.
Numerically: For a function represented by a table of data, locate the desired input in the left column
(or top row). The output is the corresponding entry in the right column (or bottom row).
The output corresponding to an input of 4 in Table 1.2 (or Table 1.3) is 156 and is written
g(4)  156.
We use the word model to refer to
an equation with labeled input
and output. We use the term
equation, and sometimes the term
function, when referring to a
mathematical formula apart from
its interpretation in a particular
context.

Function
A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output to each input. 
When a function f has input x, the output is written f (x). This notation is read “f of x.” 
A see-through ruler is useful to
improve accuracy when working
with graphs.
The output of the function f that assigns an output of 8 to an input of 3 is written
f (3)  8
Read
“f of three is equal to eight.”
Quick Example
Figure 1.1
Graphically: For a function represented by a graph, locate the desired value of the input on the
horizontal axis, move directly up (or down) along an imaginary vertical line to the graph, and then
move left (or right) to the vertical axis. The value at that point on the vertical axis is the output.

Verbally: A function that is stated verbally must be rewritten as an equation, changed into a
table, or graphed before outputs can be determined for specific inputs.
Model Output and Units of Measure
When functions model the real world, it is important to specify the units of measure of the input
and output of the functions. The unit of measure is always a word or short phrase telling how the
variable is measured.
The units of measure can be found in the verbal description of a function.
The price of gas was described as
“The price at the pump for gasoline is $4.114 per gallon times the number of gallons pumped.”
The unit of measure of the input is gallons, and the unit of measure of the output is dollars.
An input/output diagram for the price of gas function is shown in Figure 1.4.

U.S. Population (Historic) The resident population of the United States between 1900 and
2000 can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since the end of 1900. (Source: Based on data from Statistical Abstract
of the United States, 2003)
The model p describes the population as: The resident population of the United States was approxi-
mately 80 million at the end of 1900 and increased by 1.3% per year between 1900 and 2000.
a. Give the description and the unit of measure for both the input and output variables.
b. Draw an input/output diagram for p and graph of p.
c. According to the model, what was the resident population of the United States at the end of 1945?
Solution
a. The input variable t is the number of years since the end of 1900. The output p(t) is the resident
population of the United States and is measured in million people.

World War II ended in 1945. The
baby boom began in 1946. Even
though the function p fits the
population data fairly well for
most years, it overestimates just
a little before 1945 and under-
estimates for a few years fol-
lowing 1946. 
Models used over large time inter-
vals tend to smooth out some of
the smaller jumps and dips that
the raw data might reveal.

When a function f with input x is given algebraically, replace the output variable f (x) in the equa-
tion with the known value and solve the equation for x. (Keep in mind that for some equations
such as quadratics and cubics, there may be more than one input value that corresponds to the
given output.)

Vertical Line Test
For a graph with input values located along the horizontal axis, if there is an input
value at which a vertical line crosses the graph in two or more places, then the graph
does not represent a function. (The graph in Figure 1.8 represents a function. The
graph in Figure 1.9 does not represent a function.)

Table 1.4
Is It a Function?
A function assigns exactly one output to each distinct input. The method used to determine
whether a relation is a function depends on its representation.
Verbally: To determine whether a relation described verbally is a function, consider the fol-
lowing question and replace the words input and output with their respective descriptions:
“Can any specific input correspond to more than one output?”
If the answer to this question is no, then the relation is a function.
To verify that the relation for mean plasma concentration of acetaminophen given the time
after dosage is a function, ask,
“Can a certain time after dosage correspond to more than one concentration level?”
The answer to the question is no. So the relation is a function.
Numerically: To determine whether a table of data represents a function, decide whether each
input produces exactly one output.
Table 1.4 does not represent a function because an input of 
corresponds to an output
of either 8 or 11.
Table 1.5 does represent a function because each input has only one associated output. This
is true even though different inputs, 
and 
, correspond to the same output,

does not represent a function.

Plasma Concentration Consider the graph (Figure 1.10) showing mean plasma concentration
of acetaminophen given the time after dosage.
a. Identify the set of inputs and the set of outputs.
b. Is the relation graphed in Figure 1.10 a function?
Solution
a. The set of inputs is all real numbers between 0 and 4 (although it is reasonable to assume that
the pattern would continue for hours greater than 4), representing the number of hours after
dosage. The set of outputs is all real numbers between 0 and 16.1, representing the mean
plasma concentration level in

b. Because there is no input value at which a vertical line would cross the graph more than once,
the relation is visually verified to be a function.

Function Behavior and End Behavior Limits
The behavior of real-world functions is often described verbally using conversational language such
as growth, increase, and decrease.
Lower private health insurance premium growth is expected over the period from
2005–2014. (Source: Based on information in S. Hefler et al., Health Affairs: The Policy Journal of the
Health Sphere, February, 2005)
At the Ohio State University Medical Center, construction will increase beds in the cancer
hospital to at least 288 beds by 2014. (Source: Based on information in David Schuller, MD, OSU
Medical Center Campaign, 2008)
Sales of existing homes in December (2008) rose, but prices continued to decrease. (Source:
Based on information in C. Cliffler, CNNMoney.com, 2009)
The behavior of functions can also be described using mathematical terms. Mathematical terms
used to describe a function’s concavity, relative extrema, or end behavior have a specific mathe-
matical meaning.
A Function’s Behavior Described
Figure 1.11 shows an estimate of the ultimate crude oil production recoverable from Earth.
The function depicted in Figure 1.11 is increasing until 
and decreasing after 
. It is
concave down between 
and 
and concave up elsewhere. As time t increases without
bound, the output of the function is expected to approach a limiting value of 0.

Concavity: The curvature of a function is called its concavity. A function is concave up over an inter-
val if it appears to be a portion of an arc opening upward (as in Figure 1.15). A function is concave
down if it appears to be a portion of an arc opening downward (as in Figure 1.16).

Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits

Limits and End Behavior
The term end behavior refers to the behavior of the output values of a function as the input val-
ues become larger and larger (increase without bound) or as the input values become smaller and
smaller (decrease without bound).
There are three possibilities for the end behavior of a function whose input values may increase
and/or decrease without bound:
•
The output values may approach or equal a certain number.
•
The output values may either increase or decrease without bound.
•
The output values may oscillate and fail to approach any particular number.
Table 1.7 lists some output values of 
as x increases without bound.

The symbol 
stands for infinity.
Infinity is derived from the Latin
word infinitas that means “with-
out bound.” Mathematically, 
is
not a number but is used to
represent the idea of “so large as
to be uncountable.” The notation
(read negative infinity)
means “without bound in the
negative direction.”

Table 1.7
Numerical Estimation 
of End Behavior
As the input values increase, the output values are increasing and seem to be getting closer and
closer to 1. This is the concept of a limit: As the input values increase, the output values approach
a particular number.
The process of estimating end behavior by evaluating increasing (or decreasing) input values
is referred to as numerical estimation.
The output 
will never equal 1 because 
for any value of x. The notation used
to describe the end behavior of f as the input values increase without bound is 
This notation is read as
“The limit of f as x increases without bound is one.”
Figure 1.21 shows a function v with input t. As t increases without bound the output values
approach 20. The notation used to describe the end behavior of v as the input values increase
without bound is
Similarly, as t decreases without bound (
), the output values approach 
. The notation
used to describe the end behavior of v as the input values decrease without bound is

Function Behavior and End Behavior Limits
Limits and End Behavior 
The notation 
means that the output values have a limiting value of L as 
x increases or decreases without bound.
The notations 
and 
mean that the output values 
of f (x) do not have a limiting value of L as x increases or decreases without bound but
instead either increase or decrease infinitely. 
lim
x→	  f (x)  	
lim
x→	  f (x)  	
lim
x→	  f (x)  L
When a function approaches a number L as the input increases (or decreases) without bound, the
function has a limiting value of L. The horizontal line that has equation 
is called a
horizontal asymptote. The function in Figure 1.21 has two horizontal asymptotes: one at 
and one at 
.
Sometimes a function approaches the same horizontal asymptote when x increases without
bound as it does when x decreases without bound. In Figure 1.22,
Some functions appear to have no limiting value (and no horizontal asymptote) in at least one
direction. The output of a function is referred to as increasing (or decreasing) without bound if the
output continues to increase or decrease infinitely. See Figures 1.23 and 1.24.
The end behavior of g in Figure 1.23 is described mathematically as
and
.
The end behavior of h in Figure 1.24 is described mathematically as

If a function oscillates and does not approach any specific output value as the input increases or
decreases without bound, then the limit does not exist. See Figure 1.25.
Again, the symbol 
is not a
number, so in reality cannot “be
equal to” anything. The equality
sign in the limit notation is com-
monly used for simplicity.

Conventions for Numerical Estimation
When using numerical estimation to investigate a limit, in this text, we increment input
values by either adding or multiplying by a constant until a pattern becomes apparent in
the output values.
• When a simple pattern such as .9999 or .0001 seems to appear, we use at least four
estimates to establish the pattern.
• When the output values do not form a simple pattern, such as in Table 1.8, we show
two more decimal points than the accuracy required and use as many estimates as
necessary until the output values remain constant three times.
• At times the output values appear to increase (or decrease) without bound. We use at
least four estimates to establish the pattern of unbounded growth or decline.

Limits and Continuity
The use of limits to describe change sets calculus apart from algebra. In Section 1.2, limits are used
to describe end behavior of a function. Limits can also be used to describe the behavior of a func-
tion’s output as the input values approach a specific number.
Functions with Unbounded Output
Consider the function f with input x graphed in Figure 1.27. The function appears to have a
horizontal asymptote
. The end behavior of f is described by the two limit statements
Now consider the behavior of the function near 
. First, start a little to the left of 
and con-
sider the behavior of the function output as the input values get closer and closer to 1. The output
appears to be decreasing without bound as x approaches 1 from the left. The left-hand limit is written as
Similarly, the output of f appears to be increasing without bound as x approaches 1 from the right.
The right-hand limit is written as
When the output of a function increases or decreases without bound as its input values approach a
constant c, the vertical line at 
is called a vertical asymptote, and the limit of the function as
x approaches c is said not to exist. The function f in Figure 1.27 appears to have a vertical asymp-
tote at 
. The behavior of the function differs as the x values approach 
from the left and
the right. The notation in this case is
does not exist
Functions with Specific Limits
The function shown in Figure 1.27 does not have a limit as x approaches the specific input value
. The output values of the function increase or decrease without bound as the input gets clos-
er and closer to 1. However, there are other functions without a vertical asymptote that may or
may not have a limit as the input values approach a specific number, 
.

This section does not contain any
contextual examples of limits at a
point. The importance of this
topic is not in its immediate
applicability to a context, but that
it is the foundation for continuous
functions and therefore underlies
all of the models we apply in con-
text.

Left-hand and Right-hand Limits
For function f defined on an interval containing a constant c (except possibly at c itself),
if 
approaches the number 
as x approaches c from the left, then the left-hand limit
of f is 
and is written
Similarly, if

Although there is a left-hand limit and a right-hand limit as x approaches 3 in Example 1, the left-
hand limit is not equal to the right-hand limit. If the left-hand limit does not equal the right-hand
limit as the input approaches a constant, the limit does not exist at that constant. This situation is
described by writing 
does not exist
Where Left Meets Right
For the function f in Example 1, the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit as x approaches 4 are
the same:
When the left-hand and right-hand limits of a function f are the same as the input approaches a
constant c, it is correct to write “the limit of f as x approaches c exists.”

Where Is the Output Heading?
When answering limit questions, we are concerned only with where the output of a function
is headed as the input values get close to a point—not with whether the output ever arrives at
that value.
For example, the function 
is not defined for 
because the denominator
equals 0 when 
. When r is represented graphically as in Figure 1.47, a “hole” is placed on the
graph at 
to indicate that the function is not defined at 
. A numerical investigation of
the left-hand and right-hand limits of r as t approaches 4 is shown in Table 1.10 and Table 1.11.

page. See Figures 1.31 and 1.32.

The function graphed in Figure 1.31 is continuous, but the function graphed in Figure 1.32 is
discontinuous at 
. Because calculus is the study of continuous portions of functions, it
is important to have a complete understanding of the criteria for determining whether a function
is continuous. Limits are used to define continuous functions.

Continuous Function
A function f is continuous at input c if and only if the following three conditions are
satisfied:
•
•
•
A function is continuous on an open interval if these three conditions are met for every
input value in the interval.
A function is continuous everywhere if it meets all three conditions for every possible
input value. We refer to such functions as continuous functions.

Figure 1.31 and Figure 1.32 show
functions that are defined differ-
ently over different input intervals.
Such functions are called piece-
wise-defined functions.
A piecewise-defined continuous
function is a function that over
different intervals is continuous
with at least one input value
where the equation defining the
function changes.

Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits
Figures 1.33 through 1.36 illustrate the three criteria for determining whether a function is con-
tinuous. The functions in Figures 1.33 and 1.34 are not continuous at 
because the functions
are undefined at 
. The function in Figure 1.35 is not continuous at 
because the
does not exist. The function in Figure 1.36 is not continuous at c because even though
the function is defined at c and the limit exists at c, the limit is not the same as the output value
of the function at c.

Recognizing Continuity Graphically
Consider the graph of the function f shown in Figure 1.37. 
Figure 1.37
Where is the function continuous?
Solution
The graph shown in Figure 1.37 is continuous over the interval from 0 to 3 as well as over the inter-
val from 3 to 6. The graph is not continuous at 
because the limit does not exist at this point.

Linear Functions and Models
Linear functions are often used to model situations in the real world. A linear function can be
described in terms of a starting point and a value added at regular input intervals. The output of
a linear function changes by a constant value every time the input increases by one unit.
Representations of a Linear Function
The linear function is the simplest of all functions used to describe change. The graph of a linear
function is a straight line. An example of a linear function is underwater pressure (measured in
atmospheres, atm). This function is represented numerically in Table 1.12 and graphically in
Figure 1.40.

Underwater Pressure
Verbally:
At sea level, the pressure exerted by the air is 1 atm (equivalent to 14.7 pounds pressing
on one square inch). As a diver descends beneath the surface, the water exerts an addi-
tional 1 atm for every 33 feet of additional depth.
Algebraically:
The pressure on a scuba diver can be modeled as
at d feet below the surface of the water, based on data for depths between 0 and 132 feet.
Slope and Intercept
A linear equation is determined by two parameters: the starting value and the amount of the incre-
mental change. All linear functions appear algebraically as
where a is the slope and b  f (0) is the y-intercept.  
f (x)  ax  b
p(d)  1
33 d  1 atm
Equations have both parameters
and variables. A parameter is a
constant in an equation. The
value for the variable is supplied
each time the function is used.

Linear Functions and Models
Linear Model
Algebraically: A linear model has an equation of the form
where a and b are constants.
Verbally: A linear model has a constant rate of change.
Graphically: The graph of a linear function is a line. (See Figures 1.41 and 1.42.) The
constant a in the equation is the rate of change of the function and is the slope of the
line. The constant b, the y-intercept, is the output when the input is 0.

Appearances can deceive, so be
careful when comparing graphs
with differing scales.
1.4
Linear Functions and Models
•
The magnitude of the slope gives the relative steepness
of the line. In Figure 1.47, the slope of the black line is
3 and the slope of the blue line is 4.6.
•
The graph of a vertical line has undefined slope. It does
not represent a function, but it can be represented alge-
braically as 
where x is the input variable and c is a
constant. See Figure 1.48.
Although the slope of a particular linear model never changes, the look of the graph changes
when the scale of an axis is altered. When the horizontal scale on the graph in Figure 1.49 is
modified to obtain the graph in Figure 1.50, the line appears to be less steep. However, a cal-
culation of the slope for each graph reveals that the apparent difference is only a result of the
visual presentation.

Slope as Rate of Change: The slope is a measure of how quickly the output values change as the
input values increase. This measure is called the rate of change of the function at that point. A lin-
ear function has a constant slope and so it has a constant rate of change. The units on the rate of
change are the output units per single input unit.

Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits
A completely defined model includes
•
an equation, the algebraic representation of the function.
•
a description of the output variable to indicate the nature of the output and how it is measured.
•
a description of the input variable to indicate the nature of the input variable and how it is
measured.
•
a description of the input interval indicating the interval of input values on which the
model is based.

Elements of a Model
A model is an equation describing the relationship between an output variable and an input vari-
able, together with their defining statements.
Quick Example
In the model for the pressure under water, 
atm at d feet below the
surface of the water, the rate of change of underwater pressure is 
atm per foot.
For each additional foot that the diver descends beneath the surface, the underwater
pressure increases by 
atm.

Because the first differences calculated in Table 1.14
are constant, the data in Table 1.13 represent a perfectly
linear decreasing function. The constant incremental
change (
percentage points per year) is the rate of
change of the percentage of businesses surviving.
The slope of the underlying linear model is 
percent-
age points per year. If the fifth year of a company’s life is
represented by 
, the starting value of the model is 50%.

CHAPTER 1
Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits
Extrapolation
Using a model to predict an output value for an input value that is outside the interval of
the input data used to obtain the model is called extrapolation.
Predictions made using a model are made with the assumption that future (or previous) events follow
the same pattern as that shown in the available data. This assumption may or may not be true.
Interpolation
Using a model to calculate an output value for an input value that is within the interval
of the input data used to obtain the model is called interpolation.
Quick Example
The percentage of companies still in business after nine and a half years of operation is
found by interpolation because 
is inside the input interval of 
:
P(4.5)  36.5 percent
0  t  5
t  4.5
Once a model is obtained for a set of data, the model instead of the data is used to answer inter-
polation questions.
Linear Models from Data
Real-life data values are seldom perfectly linear. A linear model may be used as long as a scatter
plot of the data appears generally to follow a line.

CHAPTER 1
Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits
Interpretations of Slope
We have already noted that the rate of change of the retail sales of electricity to commercial con-
sumers is approximately 0.031 quadrillion kWh per year, which is how much retail sales increase dur-
ing a 1-year period. Thinking about rate of change in this way helps us answer questions such as
•
How much will retail sales of electricity to commercial consumers increase over half a year?
•
How much will retail sales of electricity to commercial consumers increase over a quarter of
a year?
•
How much will retail sales of electricity to commercial consumers increase over three years?
Data Alignment
When the input is years, it is often desirable to renumber the input data to reduce the magnitude
of some of the coefficients. We refer to the process of renumbering data as aligning.
In Example 2, a model for the retail sales of electricity data in Table 1.15 was given as
quadrillion kWh
where t is the year, data from 
.
If the input variable is aligned so that 2000 is year 0, 2001 is year 1, and so on, the data appear
as in Table 1.16.
2003  t  2008
r1(t)  0.031t  60.604

4  year  0.008 quadrillion kWh 
(0.031 quadrillion kWh per year)

2  year  0.016 quadrillion kWh 
In general, the smaller the magni-
tude of the input data, the smaller
the magnitude of the coefficients
in the model.

The model 
for the unaligned data and the model 
for the aligned data have the same slope,
a, but a different y-intercept, b. These models are equivalent; they give the same output values for
their respective inputs. Compare Table 1.17 with Table 1.16.

Linear Functions and Models
Numerical Considerations in Reporting and Calculating
Answers
There are four basic principles to consider while calculating and reporting answers:
•
A numerical result should be reported so that the result is logical in context. Often this
requires the result to be rounded.
A furniture retailer would sell 459 sofas, not 459.3 sofas.
An oven timer would be set for 8 minutes, not 8.196 minutes.
Generally, results that represent people or objects should be rounded to the nearest whole
number, and results that represent money should be rounded to the nearest cent or, in
some cases, to the nearest dollar.
•
A numerical result should be rounded to the same accuracy as the given output data.
Consider a company that reports net sales as shown in Table 1.18. A linear model for
these data is
where x is the number of years since 2009, data from 
.
Using the model to estimate net sales in 2012 gives 
.
The answer should be reported as $10.7 million.
•
A number without a label is likely to be worthless.
It would not make sense for an international company to publish, in its annual report,
that net sales were 10.7. This could mean 10.7 dollars, 10.7 million euros, 10.7 trillion
yen, and so on.
Although the correct rounding and reporting of numerical results are important, it is even more
important to calculate the results correctly.
•
Rounding intermediate results can cause serious errors.
When fitting a function to data, a calculator or computer finds the parameters in the equa-
tion to many digits. Although it is acceptable to round the coefficients when reporting a
model, it is important to use all of the digits while working with the model to reduce the
possibility of round-off error.
Suppose that a calculator or computer generates the following equation for a set of data
showing an airline’s weekly profit for a certain route as a function of the ticket price.
where x is the ticket price in dollars. The model is reported as
Calculating with this rounded model gives incorrect results because of round-off error.
Table 1.19 shows the inconsistencies between the rounded and unrounded models.

Exponential Functions and Models
Exponential functions are some of the most common functions used to model data. An exponen-
tial function can be described in terms of a starting point and a multiplier applied at regular input
intervals. The output of the exponential function changes by a constant multiple every time the
input increases by one unit.
Representations of an Exponential Function

month since June 2004.
Algebraically:

where x is the number of months since the end of 2003, data from 
.
Constant Multiplier of an Exponential Function
An exponential equation is determined by two parameters: the starting value and the constant
multiplier. All exponential functions can be written in the form
where a is the starting value and b is the constant multiplier. Functions of this form are called
exponential functions because the input variable appears in the exponent of the equation.

tial equation (used by some tech-

Exponential Model
Algebraically: An exponential model has an equation of the form
where 
and 
. The percentage change over one unit input is 
, and a is the output corresponding to an input of zero.
Verbally: An exponential model has a constant percentage change.
Graphically: An exponential model with positive a has the form of one of the two graphs
in Figures 1.58 and 1.59. Notice that both graphs are concave up.
(b  1)  100%
b  0

f (x)  ab x
Concavity: The repeated constant multiplier in an exponential function produces a nonlinear
curvature in the graph of the function. All exponential functions are concave in one direction with
no inflection points. Figure 1.58 through Figure 1.61 show the four possible appearances of an
exponential function.
The sign of a in 
determines whether f is concave up or concave down.
•
When a is positive, the function is concave up.
•
When a is negative, the function is concave down.
End Behavior: All four graphs in Figure 1.58 through Figure 1.61 show horizontal asymptotes at
. The value of b in 
determines whether f will approach the horizontal asymptote
or diverge from the horizontal axis as x increases without bound.
•
When 
, the function approaches the horizontal asymptote as x increases:

change between any two points that are a given input interval apart is constant regardless of the
starting point.

Percentage Change
The percentage change between two points of a function is a measure of the relative change between
the two output values. Percentage change is calculated as
where 
and 
are two points on the function f. A percentage change may be cal-
culated using any two points from a function.

Using Percentage Change to Write 
an Exponential Model
iPods
Apple introduced the iPod™ in 2001. iPod sales were 7.68 million units in 2006 and increased
approximately 9.1% each year between 2006 and 2008. (Source: U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission)
a. Why is an exponential model appropriate to describe iPod sales between 2006 and 2008?
b. Find a model for iPod sales.
Solution
a. An exponential model is appropriate because the percentage change is constant.
b. Because the percentage change is 9.1% per year, the constant multiplier is
. The sales of iPods can be modeled as
where 
is the fiscal year ending September 2006, data from 
.
Exponential Models from Data
As with linear modeling, it is possible to find an exponential model that fits a set of data even
when the constant percentage change over a unit input is not specifically stated. Consider the
data given in Table 1.22 representing the estimated population of a specific range of northern
Canadian cod. Figure 1.63 shows a scatter plot for these data.

c. What is the percentage change of wind power capacity?
Solution
a. Figure 1.65 shows concave up, increasing behavior.
b. Aligning the years to 0 in 1990, the following model is obtained:
The capacity for wind power worldwide is given by
where x is the number of years since 1990, data from 
.
c. Because 
, the percentage change for this model is 0.271 in decimal form. 
Wind power capacity has a constant percentage increase of approximately 27.1%
each year.

Quick Example
The wind power function 
has starting value 1.608. Doubling this
value gives 3.216. Substituting 3.216 for C(x):
and solving for x yields
The wind power capacity doubles every 2.89 years.
x  2.89
3.216  1.608(1.271x)
C(x)  1.608(1.271x)
Doubling Time and Half-Life
For an increasing, exponential function with input measured in time, we refer to the
function as exhibiting exponential growth.
Doubling time is the amount of time it takes for the output of an increasing exponential
function to double (grow by 100%).
For a decreasing, exponential function with input measured in time, we refer to the func-
tion as exhibiting exponential decay.
Half-life is the amount of time it takes for the output of a decreasing exponential func-
tion to decrease by half (decay by 50%).
The doubling time (or half-life) of an exponential function can be determined by solving to
find when the starting value a will double to 2a (or to halve to 0.5a).
EXAMPLE 4
Using Half-Life to Write a Model
Lead in Bones
The half-life of lead stored in the bones of humans exposed to lead is 10 years. A study performed
on living subjects found the concentration of lead ranged from 3 to 9 milligrams of lead per gram
of bone. Persons with an occupational exposure to lead all measured higher than those without
such exposure. (Source: Environmental Health Perspectives, Volume 94, 1991)
a. Consider a man who has been tested for lead with a result of 8 mg per gram but who is no
longer exposed to lead. Write a model for the concentration of lead stored in his bones t years
after the test.
b. After 15 years, approximately what level of lead concentration will remain in this person’s
bones?
Solution:
a. The model is exponential with a starting value of 8 mg per gram: 
where L(t) represents the output at time t, and b, the constant multiplier, is still unknown.
L(t)  8bt

Because the half-life of lead stored in bones is 10 years, the concentration of lead when
will be 
mg per gram. Substituting these two values into the equation gives
Using technology to solve the equation for b gives 
. The model
gives the concentration of lead per gram of bone t years after the test.

at

Capitalization is the process of
evaluating the future value of
money worth a given sum today
at some point in the future. The
reverse process of evaluating the
present value of money with a
stated future value is called
discounting.
1.6
Models in Finance
Savings, investments, trust funds, car loans, and mortgages are functions that deal with the value
of money over time. Many functions with financial application are exponential functions or are
constructed from an exponential function.
The Time-Value of Money
Given a choice, would the average person choose to receive $1000 now or receive that same $1000
in four years? Would the answer change if the choice was $1000 now or $1200 in four years?
Would the average person choose to pay $1200 four years from now to borrow $1000 today? How
would the answers to the preceding questions change if the time to repay was shortened to four
months or lengthened to forty years? The answers to these questions are related to the value of
money over time (or the time-value of money).
The concepts of future value and present value are based on the idea that an amount of money
received today would be worth more than the same amount received at some time in the future.  
Present Value and Future Value
The value today (at time 
) of an investment or loan is called present value. Present
value is denoted as P. Present value of an investment is referred to as principal, and the
present value of a loan is referred to as face value.
The future value of an investment or loan at a specified time, t, is the sum of the present
value plus all interest accumulated during the specified time. Future value at time t is
denoted as F(t).
F(0)  P
t  0
Lenders expect to be compensated for loaning money. Borrowers expect to pay to borrow
money. The amount a borrower expects to pay (above the amount he borrows) and the amount a
lender expects to be compensated is called the interest.
Simple Interest
The simplest form of loans or investments is when interest is earned on the present value only. For
example, suppose a relative is willing to loan a college student $1000 toward college expenses now
but would like to be paid back within the next five years. The aunt has asked for 4% interest per year
on the face value (or present value) of the loan. That means that each year, the interest on the loan is
. If the student pays her back in five years, she will expect to receive $1200.
$1000  0.04  $40
Nominal Rate of Interest
When the interest rate is reported as the annual interest rate (in decimal form) or annual
percentage rate (in percentage form), it refers to the increase that is earned on the princi-
pal only. This annual interest rate is also referred to as the nominal rate (in decimal
form) or the APR (annual percentage rate).

What a borrower considers to be a loan, the lender considers to be an investment. The calcu-
lations relating to the time-value of the money are the same.

The interest rate r is used in deci-
mal form in the formulas even
though it is reported as a percent.
Compound Interest
Most loans or investments do not have simple interest. Instead, at regular intervals, the interest
earned is added to the existing sum of money and future interest calculations are made on this new
sum. Compounding occurs when interest is earned (or charged) on previous interest. In this case,
the future value of the investment (or loan) is increasing by a constant percentage r (the interest
rate) over equal periods. This scenario describes an exponential function.
Consider the effect of time on compound interest. Suppose a bank offers to loan $1000 at an
APR of 4% compounded monthly. If a student borrows the money and pays back the loan in one
month (or 
year), he will pay

EXAMPLE 1
Determining Present Value
Discounting an Investment
Determine the amount that must be invested oday at 2.8% APR compounded quarterly to obtain
$5000 payable in 5 years.
Solution
The present value P of an investment with interest at 2.8% APR compounded quarterly has a
future value function
after t years.
To find the present value of an investment that will be worth $5000 in five years solve the equation
The present value is
An investment of $4348.92 at 2.8% APR compounded quarterly will grow to $5000.
Interest Rates—APR vs. APY
Investors seek to maximize the return (interest compounded) on their investments; borrowers want
to minimize the interest compounded on their loans.
The returns on investments are advertised in terms of the annual percentage yield (APY) which
looks higher because it reflects the increase due to compounding of interest. The interest rates for
loans are advertised in terms of the annual percentage rate (APR) which looks lower because it
ignores the increase due to compounded interest.

Comparing Loan Options
Choosing a Loan
Would a borrower pay less on a loan with an APR of 7.2% compounded monthly or an APY of

Solution
The effective rate (APY) for an APR of 7.2% compounded monthly is
The loan with the APY of 7.4% is better for the borrower because less interest is charged for this loan.

Solution
The effective rate (APY) for an APR of 3.9% compounded quarterly is
The deposit with the APY of 4% is better because it produces more interest on a deposit.

b. When interest is paid quarterly, 
. The account will have received interest payments at
3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 15 months, 18 months, and 21 months
. The amount in the account after 23 months will be the same as the

Doubling Time of an Investment
Comparing Annual Percentage Yields
Consider two investment offers: an APR of 6.9% compounded quarterly (Investment A) or an
APR of 6.7% compounded monthly (Investment B).
a. Which offer is a better deal?
b. Compare the time it will take an investment to double for each offer.
Solution
a. For a given principal P, the effective rates (APY) are given by
after t years. 
Because 
and 
, the annual percentage yield for
Investment A is approximately 7.08% compared to only 6.91% 
APY for Investment B. The Investment A option is a better deal.
b. Doubling time is the time it take for the future value to equal 2P:
and
Solving the Investment A option gives 
years. Because interest is paid quarterly
and 
years lies between 10 years and 10 years, 4 months (
years), the
amount will not double until the end of the first quarter of the 11th year.
Solving the Investment B option gives 
years. Because  interest is paid monthly and
years lies between 10 years, 4 months (
years) and 10 years, 5 months
(
years), the amount will not double until the end of the 5th month of the 11th year.

Constructed Functions
Many applications involve the construction of more complicated functions from simpler func-
tions. New functions are created by combining known functions using addition, multiplication,
subtraction, or division. Sometimes new functions are constructed using function composition or by
finding the inverse of a function.
Constructed Functions in Business and Economics
Party Fun, Inc., manufactures and sells inflatable slides and bounce toys of the type used at events such
as festivals and children’s parties. The company has annual fixed costs of $90,000. The fixed costs
include rent, utilities, maintenance, insurance, and salary. Separate from the fixed costs is the $600 cost
to produce one inflatable moonwalk castle. Party Fun, Inc., sells the moonwalk castle for $1800.
The company’s fixed costs can be represented by the constant linear function 
,
where x is the number of moonwalks produced. The variable costs to produce x inflatable moon-
walk castles are 
dollars. The total cost to produce x moonwalk castles in a year is mod-
eled as 
dollars. Figure 1.69 illustrates total cost as the sum of variable
costs and fixed costs.
When Party Fun, Inc., produces 200 moonwalk castles in one year, the average cost is 
per castle. The average cost is shown in Figure 1.70.

The revenue from the sale of x moonwalk castles is modeled as

from producing and selling 200 moonwalk castles is 
dollars. By solving 
, we find that Party Fun, Inc., will need to sell 75 moonwalk
castles to break even. When Party Fun, Inc., sells 75 moonwalk castles, both the revenue and total
cost will be $135,000. Figure 1.71 shows the break-even point as the point at which revenue and
total cost are equal.

Terms from Business
and Economics
Fixed costs are costs
that remain constant no
matter how much mer-
chandise is produced. 
Variable costs are costs
that change depending
on the number of units
produced. 
Total cost is the sum of
fixed cost and variable
cost. 
Average cost is the
total cost divided by
the number of items
produced. 
Revenue is the product
of the selling price per
unit and the number of
units sold.
Profit is the difference
between revenue
and cost. 
The break-even point
is the point at which
total cost is equal to
total revenue. This
occurs when profit is
exactly zero.

CHAPTER 1
Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits

Operations for Combining Functions
The functions created in the Party Fun example illustrate the four basic function operations used to
construct new functions from known functions: function addition (used to create total cost, C),
function multiplication (used to create variable cost, V ), function subtraction (used to create profit, P ),
and function division (used to create average cost, 
).
C
Function Operations
If the inputs, x, of functions f and g are identical (corresponding values and unit of mea-
sure), then the following new functions can be constructed and are valid models under
the given conditions:
• function addition:
if the output units are identical
• function subtraction:
if the output units are identical
• function multiplication:
if the output units are compatible
• function division:
, where 
, as long as the output units are compatible
g(x) 
 0
l(x)  B f
g R(x)  f (x)
g(x)
k(x) 
B f  gR(x)  f (x)  g(x)
j(x) 
B f  gR(x)  f (x)  g(x)
h(x) 
B f  gR(x)  f (x)  g(x)
When constructing new functions using function operations, it is important to make sure that
input units of the original functions are identical and that the output units are either identical or
compatible (depending on which operation is used).
Example 1
Function Addition
Basketball Tickets
The number of student tickets sold for a home basketball game at State University is represented
by 
tickets when w is the winning percentage of the team. The number of nonstudent tickets
sold for the same game is represented by 
hundred tickets where w is the winning percentage
of the team. Combine the functions, S and N, to construct a new function giving the total num-
ber of tickets sold for a home basketball game at State University.
Solution
The input descriptions for both S and N are the same—the winning percentage of the team. The
output description can be expanded to include all tickets sold, and 
must be multiplied by
100 to give output in tickets instead of in hundred tickets. The new function, T, giving total
tickets sold for a home basketball game at State University is
tickets
where w is the winning percentage of the team.
When combining functions using function multiplication or division, the output units of the
two original functions should combine to create a unit of measure that makes sense.

Example 2
Function Multiplication
Sparkling Water Revenue
Sales of 12-ounce bottles of sparkling water are modeled as
million bottles
when the price is x dollars per bottle. Write a model for the revenue from the sale of 12-ounce
bottles of sparkling water.
Solution
Revenue is found by multiplying the number of units sold by the selling price for one unit:
The output units are compatible because they cancel to create expected units of measure. Figure 1.72
shows an input/output diagram for this function multiplication. The new function for revenue from
the sale of 12-ounce bottles of sparkling water is
million dollars
when the price is x dollars per bottle.
Function Composition
Another way in which functions are constructed is called function composition. This method of con-
structing functions uses the output of one function as the input of another. Consider Table 1.28,
giving the altitude of an airplane as a function of time after takeoff and Table 1.29, giving external
air temperature as a function of the airplane’s altitude.

Function composition is the
fifth function operation.
The mathematical symbol for the
composition of an inside function
F and an outside function A is
, so an alternate notation is
.

A  F

Figure 1.73
Because the output of Table 1.28 matches the input of Table 1.29, it is possible to use func-
tion composition to combine these two data tables into one table that shows air temperature as a
function of time. The resulting new function is shown in Table 1.30. Figure 1.73 shows an
input/output diagram for this function composition.
Function Composition
Two functions, f and g, can be combined using function composition if the output from
one function, f, can be used as input to the other function, g. In function composition,
the unit of measure for the output of function f must be identical to the unit of measure
for the input of function g.
Notation: c(x)  g ( f (x))  ( g  f )(x)

Function Composition
Lake Contamination
The level of contamination in a certain lake is
parts per million
when the population of the surrounding community is p people. The population of the
surrounding community in year t is modeled as
people
where t is the number of years since 2000.
a. Why do these two functions satisfy the criterion for composition of functions?

Using the Horizontal Line Test
Use the horizontal line test to determine which of the functions shown in Figure 1.74 through
Figure 1.76 are one-to-one.
Solution
a. The output units of p are the input units of f.
b. The level of contamination in the lake is
parts per million
where t is the number of years since 2000.
Inverse Functions
Given a function, a new function can sometimes be created by reversing the input and output of
the original function. This reversed function is called an inverse function. The inverse of a function
is a function if the original function has the property that every output value corresponds to only
one input value. A function with this property is said to be one-to-one.
A horizontal line test can be used to determine graphically whether a function is one-to-one.
If all horizontal lines pass through at most one point on the graph of a function, then the func-
tion is one-to-one.

Solution
Out of the three graphs, only the one in Figure 1.75 is not one-to-one. See Figure 1.77.

Inverse Function
For a one-to-one function g with input variable x, the function f is an inverse of g if f uses the
output values from g as its input values and, for each output value 
, f returns 
to x:
f ( g(x))  x    and    g ( f (x))  x
g(x)
g(x)
When an equation represents a function, finding an algebraic expression for an inverse function
requires solving for the input variable of a function in terms of the output variable. Occasionally,
this is simple. However, because most of the models we use in this text are built from data, if we
need a model to approximate the inverse relationship, we simply invert the data and model the
inverted data. In most cases, this technique will yield a good approximation of the inverse function.
For example, consider underwater pressure (measured in atmospheres, atm) d feet below the
surface as represented numerically in Table 1.31 and by the model
atm
Figure 1.78 shows an input/output diagram for this function.

Logarithmic Functions and Models
A logarithmic function is used to describe a situation with positive input values and output values
that show an increasingly slow increase or decrease. Logarithmic functions can be constructed from
exponential functions.
Representations of a Logarithmic Function
Not all concavity can be modeled with exponential functions. For example, the percentage of people
who record television programs to watch later (presented numerically in Table 1.33 and graphically
in Figure 1.80) cannot be modeled as an exponential function.

Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits

Logarithmic Model
Algebraically: A logarithmic (log) model has an equation of the form
where a and 
are constants and 
.
Verbally: A log function has a vertical asymptote at 
and continues to grow or
decline as x increases without bound.
Graphically: The graph of a log model has the form of one of the two graphs shown in
Figure 1.82 and Figure 1.83. 
x  0
x  0
b 
 0
f (x)  a  b ln x
The sign of b in 
determines both the direction and concavity of the log
function.
•
When b is negative, the function is decreasing and concave up. See Figure 1.82.
•
When b is positive, the function is increasing and concave down. See Figure 1.83.
f (x)  a  b ln x
The scatter plot in Figure 1.80 appears to exhibit the same curvature as the logarithmic
function graphed in Figure 1.81.
Verbally: The behavior of an increasing natural logarithmic function can be described as follows:
An increasing logarithmic function is characterized by a slower and slower increase in the 
output values as the input values increase.
Algebraically: A good model for DVR time-shift viewing is
of people who record television programs start viewing the recording before x days have passed,
data from 
.
Characteristic Behavior of Logarithmic Functions
All logarithmic (or log) functions can be written in the form
where a and 
are constants and 
and can be either decreasing (as in Figure 1.82) or
increasing (as in Figure 1.83).

Log Models from Data
The concavity and end behavior suggested by a scatter plot is important in determining when it is
appropriate to use a log function to fit the data.
Example 1
Writing a Logarithmic Model
Altitude and Air Pressure
A pressure altimeter determines altitude in thousand feet by measuring the air pressure in inches
of mercury ("Hg). See Table 1.34 for altimeter data and Figure 1.84 for a scatter plot of the data.

End Behavior: In both the linear and exponential models, one of the parameters represented a
starting value, 
. There is no such parameter for the log function because it has a vertical asymp-
tote at 
and is defined for only positive input values.
As the input of a log function increases without bound, the output values increase (or
decrease) without bound but do so more and more slowly.
The behavior of log functions can be summarized as follows:

Input-Data Alignment for Log Models
Aligning input data to smaller values is convenient when finding a linear model so that the coef-
ficients of the linear model are simpler. Aligning input data is sometimes necessary when finding
an exponential model to avoid round-off error.
Similarly, aligning input data is often necessary when finding a log model for two reasons:
•
Log functions require all input data to be positive.
•
Because a log function increases (or decreases) without bound as the inputs approach 0
from the right, differently aligned data result in better- or worse-fitting models.
We will give a recommended
input alignment when asking you
to model using log functions for
data that need to be shifted
(aligned).

Solution
a. Although the scatter plot suggests increasing, log-shaped concavity and the continued slow
growth suggests a log model, the input for ear length at birth cannot be zero because log
equations have a vertical asymptote at zero. Table 1.36 shows the aligned data.

The Exponential Model Connection
Logarithmic functions are either increasing or decreasing, so for any possible input value,
there can be no repeated output values. Thus, a function of the form 
has an
inverse function associated with it. The inverse function for a log function is an exponential
function.
In Example 1, altitude was modeled with air pressure as the input. It is possible to find
a model that gives air pressure as output with altitude as input. This model is found in

Quadratic Functions and Models
Quadratic functions form the third family of functions that exhibit only a single type of concavity
over the entire input interval. Quadratic functions differ from exponential and logarithmic
functions in that they also exhibit a change of direction. Quadratic functions are increasing over a
portion of their unrestricted input interval and decreasing over another portion of their unrestricted
input interval.
Representations of a Quadratic Function
Even though a quadratic function is similar to an exponential or a log function in that it has a sin-
gle type of concavity, it differs from these two types of functions by changing direction at some
point.
An example of a quadratic function is the percentage of people over age 14 who are sleeping at a
given time of night. This function can be represented numerically in Table 1.39 and algebraically as
of people in the United States are asleep t hours after 9:00 P.M.,
. Figure 1.92 shows
graphically the continuous function s as well as the scatter plot of the data.

Characteristic Behavior of Quadratic Functions
Quadratic functions are polynomial functions of the form
where 
, b, and c are constants. The constant a is referred to as the leading coefficient
because it is the coefficient (multiplier) of the term at which x is raised to its highest power and
normally is the first coefficient written. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola and is
concave up when a is positive (see Figure 1.93) and concave down when a is negative as in the
sleeping habits example in Figure 1.93. The constant c is the starting value f (0), also known as
the y-intercept.

a. A scatter plot of the data suggests a concave-up curve. See Figure 1.96. The leading coefficient
should be positive.
b. A quadratic model for the data is

Find an appropriate model for the data.
Solution
The scatter plot is increasing and concave down. Either a log or quadratic model may be appro-
priate for the data. A log model requires the input to be aligned so that all values are positive. By
aligning years to 
in 2008, a very nice fitting log model is obtained:
of all U.S. Internet users will shop online x years since 2005, 
.
Because alignment of the input data does not affect the fit of a quadratic model, the same
alignment is used to find a quadratic model. A quadratic model is
of all U.S. Internet users will shop online x years since 2005, data from 
.
When graphed with the scatter plot, either function seems to be a reasonable choice. See
Figure 1.99, where the log model, L, appears as a dotted line and the quadratic model, Q, appears
as a solid line.

N O T E
A method for deciding whether a quadratic function fits data uses second differences: the differences
of the first differences. Table 1.42 shows computations of second differences for the output data in
Table 1.41.
Because the second differences are close to constant, the data can be considered to be quadratic.
Either model can be used to fit the data. However, if the model is to be used for extrapolation
beyond 2008, it makes sense that the percentage of online shoppers will continue to increase. So
a log model would be the better choice.

Preliminary Steps in Choosing a Model
In real life, data do not come with instructions attached to tell what function to use as a pos-
sible model. Consider first the underlying processes that may be influencing the relationship
between input and output and what end behavior may be exhibited. The following guidelines
may help:
1. Look at the curvature and end behavior suggested by a scatter plot of the data.
If the scatter plot suggests a function that is curved but has no obvious change in concavity, try
a quadratic, an exponential, or a log model based on the behavior (including end behavior)
indicated by the scatter plot.
Note: If the input values are equally spaced, it might be helpful to look at first differences,
percentage changes, and/or second differences.
2. Look at the fit of the possible equations. After Step 1, there should be at most two choices for
possible models. Compute these equations and graph them on a scatter plot of the data. The one
that comes closest to the most points (but does not necessarily go through the most points) is
normally the better model to choose.
3. Consider that there may be two equally good models for a particular set of data. If that is
the case, choose either.

Logistic Functions and Models
Although exponential models are common and useful, it is sometimes unrealistic to believe
that exponential growth can continue forever. In many situations, forces ultimately limit growth.
In this case a logistic function would increase toward an upper limit. In other contexts, logistic
functions can describe a decline toward a lower limit.
Representations of a Logistic Function
Verbally: Consider a worm that has attacked the computers of an international corpora-
tion. The worm is first detected on 100 computers. The corporation has 10,000 comput-
ers, so as time increases, the number of infected computers can approach but never exceed
10,000.

Exponential Growth with Constraints
Constrained behavior such as exhibited in Figure 1.100 is common in the spread of disease, the
spread of information, the marketing of a new product, the adoption of new technology, and the
growth of certain populations. A mathematical function that exhibits such behavior is called a
logistic function. A logistic function can be expressed in the form
where L, A, and B are nonzero constants. The number L appearing in the numerator of a logistic
equation determines a horizontal asymptote 
for a graph of the function f.

Logistic Model
Algebraically: A logistic model has an equation of the form
where A and B are nonzero constants and 
is the limiting value of the function.
Graphically: The logistic function f increases if B is positive and decreases if B is negative.
The graph of a logistic function is bounded by the horizontal axis and the line 
. See
Figure 1.101 and Figure 1.102.

The graph of a logistic function is trapped between the horizontal axis (
) and a horizontal
asymptote at the limiting value
. The sign of the constant B determines whether the
function is increasing or decreasing. The behavior of a logistic function can be summarized as
follows:

The end behavior indicated by a scatter plot can help identify when it is appropriate to use a
logistic function.

In social science and life science
applications, the limiting value is
often called the carrying capacity
or the saturation level. In other
applications, it is sometimes
referred to as the leveling-off
value.
For increasing logistic functions

changes to concave down

a. Find an appropriate model for the data.
b. What is the end behavior of the model as height increases?
Solution
a. A scatter plot of the data is shown in Figure 1.103. The function is decreasing
but suggests two possible horizontal asymptotes as well as change in concavity
from concave down to concave up.
We choose to align the input data by converting to inches and subtracting
68 from each value. A logistic model for the aligned data is
are taller than 
inches, data from 
. Figure 1.104 shows the
graph of the model.
b. The two horizontal asymptotes of a graph of this function are 
and
. See Figure 1.105. Because the function decreases, the end behavior
as height increases is given by the lower asymptote. The two limit statements are
and
As the heights increase, the number of men taller than a particular height
approaches zero.

Recall that a logistic function is of the form 
. What happened
to the negative sign before the B in Example 1? In that case, 
. When  
the formula was written, the negatives canceled:
This will always be the case for a logistic function that decreases from its upper
asymptote.
Sometimes a logistic model will have a limiting value that is lower or higher
than the one indicated by the context. For instance, in Example 1 it would make
sense for the upper limit to be 490, but the limiting value is 
. This
does not mean that the model is invalid, but it does indicate that care should be
taken when extrapolating by using this model.
In some situations, the context suggests that there will be limiting end behav-
ior as input values increase even though it is hard to infer from the curvature indi-
cated by the scatter plot whether to use a logistic model.

Aligning input data shifts the data horizontally. It is
often advantageous to align input data so that the
values are close to 0 before fitting a logistic model.
Such alignment might avoid an extremely small value
for the coefficient of the exponential term in the logis-
tic function.
It is also possible to shift exponential and logistic
models vertically by realigning output data. Such an
alignment would change the lower limiting values from
0 to some other number. We do this occasionally
when the shift will significantly improve end-behavior
fit or there is reason to believe that the data approach
a different limiting position than the input axis.

Solution
a. The data is given in percentages, so it has an upper limit of 100%. Unless
a technology that outperforms broadband is introduced into the market,
it is to be expected that the broadband user percentage will not decrease
over time.
b. A model for the percentage of residents with Internet access that use
broadband is
where t is the number of years since 2000, data from 
. From
Figure 1.106, it appears that the function b models the data relatively well even
though the limiting value of the model is over 100%. Any extrapolation should

Cubic Functions and Models
Polynomial functions and models have been used extensively throughout the history of mathe-
matics. Their successful use stems from both their presence in certain natural phenomena and their
relatively simple application. Even though higher-degree polynomials are useful in some situations,
the only remaining polynomial functions discussed in this text are cubic. Cubic functions have a
change in concavity.
Representations of a Cubic Model
Many different appearances of scatter plots of data can be reasonably modeled using a cubic func-
tion; however, they all have one thing in common—the presence of an obvious inflection point.
For example, consider the average ATM surcharges levied by ATM owners on non-account hold-
ers who use their automated teller machines as a function of the year.

Verbally: The average ATM surcharge function increases over the entire period between 1998
and 2007. The initial increase becomes relatively constant between 2002 and 2004 before
increasing again between 2005 and 2008. The scatter plot indicates a period of downward
concavity followed by upward concavity, indicating the presence of an inflection point. The
end behavior of the function is unbounded.
Characteristic Behavior of Cubic Functions
All cubic functions can be written in the form
where 
, b, c, and d are constants and x is the input variable. The constant a is called the lead-
ing coefficient, and 
is the y-intercept.
Every cubic function has a graph that resembles one of the four graphs in Figure 1.108
through Figure 1.111.

All cubic functions have one inflection point, but not all cubic functions have a change in direc-
tion. The sign of the leading coefficient, a, determines the function’s direction and end behavior
as summarized:

If the scatter plot of a set of data fails to exhibit an inflection point, it is not appropriate
to fit a cubic equation to the data.

Example 1
Writing a Cubic Model
Full-time Employees
Table 1.47 gives the number of 20- to 24-year-olds who were employed full time during a given
year.
Caution is necessary when using cubic models to extrapolate. For the data sets whose scatter
plots are shown in Figure 1.113 through Figure 1.116, the functions indicated by the dotted curves
appear to follow the trend of the data. However, the cubic pattern may or may not continue.
Additional data might continue to get closer to the x-axis, whereas the cubic function that is fit-
ted to the available data begins to rise.
a. Is a cubic model more appropriate for the data than a logistic model? 
b. Write a model for the data. Would it be wise to use this model to predict future employment
trends?
c. Use the model in part a to estimate the employment in July 2005.
d. According to the model, when did the number of 20- to 24-year-old employees exceed
9400 thousand?

The scatter plot indicates a change in concavity (concave up to the left of the dashed line in
Figure 1.117 and concave down to the right of the dashed line), but there does not appear to
be a horizontal asymptote. A cubic model is more appropriate to fit the given data than is a
logistic model.

b. A cubic model for the number of 20- to 24-year-old full-time employees is
thousand employees where t is the number of years since 2000, data from 
. 
A graph of the equation over the scatter plot is shown in Figure 1.117. The function
graph indicates a slight decline in the number of employees since 2008. If the graph were
extended for several years, the decrease would become much greater.
This model should not be used to predict employment trends much beyond the end of 2007.
c. July 2005 is represented by 
. Calculating p(4.5) gives approximately 9330 thousand
employees.
There were approximately 9330 thousand full-time 20- to 24-year-old employees in July,
2005.
d. There are three solutions to the equation 
(see Figure 1.118): 
,
and 
.
The number of 20- to 24-year-old employees exceeded 9400 thousand from the end of
2000 to early in 2002 and again from late 2005 through early 2009.
This answer regarding 2009 is an extrapolation.
Model Choices
In real life, data do not come with instructions attached to tell what function to use as a possible
model. It is important to consider first what underlying processes may be influencing the rela-
tionship between input and output and what end behavior may be exhibited. However, the
following simple guidelines may help.

Steps in Choosing a Model
1. Look at the curvature of a scatter plot of the data.
• If the points appear to lie in a straight line, try a linear model.
• If the scatter plot is curved but has no inflection point, try a quadratic, an expo-
nential, or a log model.
• If the scatter plot appears to have an inflection point, try a cubic, logistic, or sine
model.
2. Look at the fit of the possible equations. The suggestions in Step 1 should result in
narrowing the possible models to at most two choices. Compute these equations and
graph them on a scatter plot of the data. The one that comes closest to the most
points (but does not necessarily go through the most points) is normally the better
model to choose.
3. Look at the end behavior of the scatter plot. If Step 2 does not reveal that one
model is obviously better than another, consider the end behavior of the data and
choose the appropriate model. Consider the context of the model.
4. Consider that there may be two equally good models for a particular set of data. 
If that is the case, choose either.
Sine models are introduced in
Section 1.12.

Cyclic Functions and Models 
The world is full of cyclic processes. Examples come from business and economics, nature and
demographics, or engineering and physical science. A function that repeats itself with a constant
input interval between the repetitions is said to be periodic. When a function is periodic and varies
continuously between two extremes, the function is cyclic. The most common cyclic function is
the sine function.

The monthly dose of sunburn-causing UV-B radiation in southern California is
given numerically in Table 1.48 and graphically in Figure 1.119.
I N  C O N T E X T
Sunburn is largely due to 
UV-B rays, although UV-A rays
also contribute. Cosmetic compa-
nies use data such as these when
developing sunscreen, face, and
hair products.

Verbally: The table and scatter plot of the data indicate a minimum and a maximum UV-B
level. Under the assumption that the amount of UV-B radiation reaches this same maximum
and minimum each year, the data are cyclic with a period of 12 months.
Algebraically: A model for the monthly amount of UV-B radiation received in southern
California is
where 
is the end of January,

Sine Model
Algebraically: A sine model has an equation of the form
where 
,
, c, and d are constants.
d is the average value, a is the amplitude, 
is the period, and is the horizontal shift
(right if 
and left if 
)
Verbally: A sine model exhibits cyclic behavior, oscillating between two extremes.
Graphically: A sine model can appear higher or lower or stretched, but it will have the
same basic shape as that of the graph in Figure 1.120.

Concavity: The graph of a sine function alternates between concave down and concave up. It
also alternates between increasing and decreasing.
End Behavior: Because a sine function oscillates between two extremes, its output value has
no defined limit as x increases (or decreases) without bound.
Constants: The sine function in its most basic form, 
oscillates between the two
output extremes 1 and 
. Refer to Figure 1.121.
Each of the four parameters, a, b, c, and d, of the general sine function
indicates a change in a specific characteristic of the cycle. Refer to

The constant d is the average value or vertical shift of the sine function. The average (or
expected) value of a sine function can be calculated as the average of the two extremes.
•
The constant a is the amplitude of the sine function—a measure of the difference between
the extremes of the output and the average value. The amplitude can be calculated as half the
difference of the maximum and minimum values:
•
The constant b is related to the period of the sine function:
The period of the sine function can be estimated graphically by locating two consecutive
maximums and estimating the distance between them.
•
The constant c is related to the horizontal shift of the function:
The direction of the horizontal shift is determined by whether c is positive or negative.
When 
, shift left, and when 
, shift right.
The magnitude of the horizontal shift of a sine model is the length of the input interval
between 
and the nearest input 
for which

graph is increasing as it passes through the point

Sine Models from Data
Understanding the interpretation of the constants in the sine model 
makes it possible to write a sine model from either a verbal or a numerical description.

Writing a Sine Model from Parameter Information
UV-B Radiation
The intensity of UV-B radiation in southern California varies in one-year cycles. Monthly UV-B
radiation exposure is at a maximum of 172 kJ/m2 in June and at a minimum of 30 kJ/m2 in
December.
a. Calculate the average value and amplitude of UV-B radiation for a one-year cycle. Interpret
these numbers in context.
b. What is the period of UV-B radiation? By what constant in a sine model is period
represented? Calculate this constant for UV-B radiation.
c. Estimate the horizontal shift of a sine model for UV-B radiation.
d. Using the values calculated in parts a, b, and c, write a sine model for UV-B radiation.
Solution
a. The average value and amplitude are both calculated from the maximum and minimum
values:
and
Dismissing the cyclic fluctuations in the amount of UV-B radiation, the expected amount of
radiation is 101 kJ/m2 for any given month. However, depending on what month in the 
cycle is being considered, UV-B radiation could vary from the expected value by as much as
71 kJ/m2.
b. UV-B radiation should have a period of 12 months. If the input variable is measured in
months, b is calculated as
c. Because the minimum occurs in December and the maximum occurs in June, the function
must be increasing from December to June. The function is expected to be at its average value
halfway between the maximum and the minimum—in March. Using m as the input aligned
to the number of months after the end of December, the horizontal shift is 
(3 months to
the right). This shift is related to the constant c by
d. A sine model giving UV-B radiation in southern California is
where 
is January, 
is February, and so on.

.
b. The average retail price for electricity in the commercial sector between December 2008
and December 2009 is approximately 10.618 cents/kWh. The amplitude indicates that
the highest and lowest prices are approximately 0.652 cents/kWh different from the

Ingredients of Change: Functions and Limits

CHAPTER SUMMARY
Mathematical Modeling and Functions
Mathematical modeling refers to the process of constructing a
mathematical equation to describe the relationship between an input
variable and an output variable. The resulting equation, together
with output label, input description, and data interval description, is
called the mathematical model and gives a representation of the
underlying relationship between two variable quantities.
A function is a relation that connects an input variable with
a unique output variable. Functions are represented in four ways:
numerically (as data), algebraically (as equations or models), ver-
bally, and graphically.
Limits
Limits are used to describe the output behavior of functions. The
value that the output of a function approaches as the input
approaches a given number is a limit. Limits also describe what hap-
pens to the output of a function as the input increases (or decreas-
es) without bound. This type of limit is referred to as end behavior.
Limits can be estimated graphically or numerically. In some
cases, limits can be calculated algebraically.
The concept of continuity is defined using limits. A function
is continuous at a given input value if the limit from the left and
the limit from the right are equal to each other and equal to the
output value of the function at that input.
The Role of Technology
Graphing calculators and personal computers are useful tools
when constructing mathematical models from data. However,
technology is only a tool and cannot substitute for clear, effective
thinking. Technology simplifies graphing and computation. The
role of the student is to decide on and carry out the required
mathematical analyses, interpret the results, make the appropri-
ate decisions, and communicate the conclusions clearly.
Function Combinations and Composition
There are several ways to create new functions by combining
two or more other functions whose input and output units are
compatible. The basic construction techniques are function
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composi-
tion. In each of these constructions, the input and output units
of the given functions determine how the functions may be
combined. Table 1.50 shows the necessary input and output
compatibility.

Linear Functions
A linear function models a constant rate of change. The general
equation of a linear function is 
, where the para-
meter a is called the slope. Slope is the rate of increase or decrease
of the linear function. Slope is also referred to as the rate of
change. The parameter b in the linear model is the output value
when the input value is zero.
Exponential Functions
The exponential model 
is formed by repeated multipli-
cation by a fixed positive multiplier b for 
. The parameter a
is the output value when the input value is zero.
Exponential functions model constant percentage change.
Exponential growth occurs when b is greater than 1, and expo-
nential decay occurs when b is between 0 and 1. The constant
percentage growth or decay is given by 
.
Logarithmic Functions
The basic form of the log function is 
for
. The log function is useful for situations in which the out-
put grows or declines at an increasingly slow rate. To fit a log
equation to data, all input values must be greater than zero.
Aligning input data has the effect of shifting the data horizon-
tally to get appropriate input values.
Logistic Functions
Logistic growth is characterized by exponential growth followed
by a leveling-off toward a limiting value L. The logistic equation 
is f (x)   
L
1  AeBx
x  0
f (x)  a  b ln x
(b  1) 100%
b 
 1
f (x)  abx
f (x)  ax  b
If the parameter B is positive, the model indicates growth. If
the parameter B is negative, the model indicates a decline in out-
put values toward the horizontal axis as the input values increase.
When fitting exponential and logistic equations to data, it is
sometimes helpful to shift the output data. This vertical shift is
particularly useful when the data appear to approach a value
other than zero. The goal in shifting is to move the data closer to
the horizontal axis.
Quadratic and Cubic Functions
The graph of a quadratic equation is a parabola. The parabola
with equation 
is concave up if a is positive
and is concave down if a is negative.
The graph of a cubic equation shows a change of concavity
at an inflection point, but unlike the graph of a logistic model, it
does not have horizontal asymptotes to limit end behavior. In
fact, no polynomial function has limiting end behavior.
Choosing a Model
Although it is not always clear which functions apply to a particu-
lar real-life situation, the following general guidelines may be use-
ful: (1) Given a set of discrete data, begin with a scatter plot. The
plot may reveal general characteristics that suggest an appropriate
model. (2) If the scatter plot does not appear to be linear, consid-
er the suggested concavity. A single concavity suggests a quadratic,
exponential, or log model. (3) When a single change in concavity
seems apparent, a cubic or logistic model may be appropriate. The
suggested end behavior of the context may be considered to choose
between a logistic model and a cubic model. Logistic models flat-
ten on each end, while the graph of a cubic model does not show
any limiting end behavior. Cubic or logistic models should only be
used if the scatter plot or context suggests an inflection point.

The start of the twenty-first century has been marked with new challenges. The
possibility and reality of global terrorism initiated efforts to thwart further attacks.
Economic difficulties in one part of the world spread to other areas. Many busi-
nesses that operated during the latter part of the 1900s are no longer operating,
while others must adapt quickly to remain financially solvent. Local businesses are
affected by world-wide fluctuations in demand for products or services or level of
investor support. Changing federal regulations or tax codes and increases in operat-
ing expenses bring new challenges. Calculus can be used to answer questions such
as the following:
•
What was the percentage rate of change of sales at the end of 2007? (Section 2.2,
Example 3)
•
What was the rate of change of the number of customers at 4:00 P.M.? (Section
2.3, Activity 18)
•
How rapidly were the company’s investments growing in the middle of the fourth
year? (Section 2.4, Example 1)
•
At what volume of sales is average monthly profit decreasing most rapidly?

Measures of Change over an Interval
129
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Change is measured in several ways. The actual change in a quantity over an interval is calculated
using subtraction. Percentage change and average rate of change are two measures of change over
an interval that can be calculated using simple arithmetic manipulation. Considering the average
rate of change over smaller and smaller intervals leads to the more subtle concept of instantaneous
change. The study of instantaneous change using the derivative is one of the two major parts of
calculus.
The instantaneous rate of change at a point is described graphically as the slope of the tangent
line and can be estimated numerically as well as graphically. The numerical method for estimat-
ing the slope of a tangent line is generalized to an algebraic method that gives a formula for the
derivative of a function at any input.

Measures of Change over an Interval
One of the primary goals of calculus is to measure change that is occurring at a point. In prepara-
tion for understanding how calculus is used to describe change at a point, three ways of measur-
ing change that occurs over an interval are discussed.
Change, Percentage Change, and Average 
Rate of Change
Apple Corporation’s annual net sales increased from approximately $7.98 trillion to $32.48 tril-
lion over an eight-year period. (Source: Apple Corp. 10-K Filings for 2002 and 2008)
This growth can be expressed as a change:
Apple’s annual net sales increased by approximately $24.5 trillion over eight years.
The change can be expressed as a percentage change:
(100%)
Apple’s annual net sales increased 307% over eight years.
Or it can be expressed as an average rate of change:
Apple’s annual net sales increased by an average of $3.06 trillion per year over eight years.

Interpretations of Measures of Change
Correctly calculating these measures of change is important, but understanding the result and
being able to state it in a meaningful sentence in the context of the situation is equally important.
When interpreting a measure of change, answer the following questions:
•
When? Specify the input interval.
•
What? Specify the quantity that is changing.
•
How? Indicate whether the change is an increase or a decrease.
•
By how much? Write the numerical answer labeled with proper units.
When change in f (x) is being measured, the unit of measure for
–
change is the same as the unit of measure of f (x).
–
percentage change is percent.
–
average rate of change is the unit of measure of f (x) per a single unit of measure of x.
Average rate of change is the slope of the line through two points. Refer to Figure 2.1.
Even though the average rate of change is useful, it can be misleading. In the case of Apple’s net
sales, the average rate of change does not show the decrease in sales during the first two years of
the eight year period.
When stating an average rate of
change, use the word average.

b. How could using average rate of change as a measure of the change in temperature between
8 A.M. and 5 P.M. be misleading?
Solution
a. To calculate the average rate of change over an interval, we need to know the length of the
interval. In this case, if we consider 7 A.M. to be 
hours, then 8 A.M. is 
hours and
5 P.M. is 
hours. The length of the interval from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M is 9 hours.
As illustrated in Figure 2.3, the average rate of change from 8 A.M. to 5 P.M. is calculated as
Between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M., the temperature rose by an average of approximately 1.2°F per hour.

The word secant comes from the
Latin secare, meaning “to cut.”
A secant line cuts the graph of a
function at two (or more) points.
CHAPTER 2

b. It appears from the answer to part a that the temperature rose slowly throughout the day
according to the sloped line in Figure 2.3. However, the average rate of change does not
describe the 22°F rise in temperature followed by the 11°F drop in temperature that occurred
between 8 A.M. and 5 P.M.
Measures of Change from Graphs
Calculating an average rate of change of a function between two points is the same as calculating
the slope of a line through those two points. A line connecting two points on a scatter plot or
graph is a secant line. The slope of a secant line can be approximated by estimating the rise and
the run for a portion of the line.

The Social Security assets of the federal government between 2002 and 2040, as estimated by the
Social Security Advisory Board in constant 2005 dollars, are shown in Figure 2.4.
a. Estimate the change, percentage change, and average rate of change in Social Security assets
between 2012 and 2033.
b. Write a sentence interpreting each answer in context.
Solution
a. Begin by estimating from the graph the Social Security assets in 2012 and
2033. One possible estimate is $2.9 trillion  in 2012 and $2.2 trillion in
2033 (see Figure 2.5).
To calculate change, subtract the 2012 value from the 2033 value.
Convert this change to percentage change by dividing by the estimated
assets in 2012.

The average rate of change is the
slope of the secant line through the
points corresponding to 2012 and
to 2033.
2.1
Measures of Change over an Interval
133
Convert the change to an average rate of change by dividing the change by the length of the
interval between 2012 and 2033.
b. Social Security assets are expected to decrease by approximately $0.7 trillion between 2012
and 2033.
Social Security assets are expected to decrease by approximately 24.1% between 2012 and 2033.
Social Security assets are expected to decrease on average by approximately $33 billion per
year between 2012 and 2033.
The graphical method of calculating measures of change is imprecise because it depends on accurately
drawing the secant line and correctly identifying two points on that line. Slight  variations in drawing
are likely to result in slightly different answers. This does not mean that the answers are incorrect. It
simply means that measures of change obtained from graphs are approximations.

Measures of Change at a Point–Graphical
The average rate of change of a quantity is a measure of the change in that quantity over a speci-
fied interval. The change occurring at a specific point can also be measured. One measure of the
change of a quantity at a specific point is the instantaneous rate of change.
Speed–An Instantaneous Rate of Change
A familiar example of an instantaneous rate of change is available to those who drive from one place
to another. Suppose that a driver begins driving north on highway I-81 at the Pennsylvania–New
York border at 1:00 P.M. As he drives, he notes the time at which he passes each of the indicated
mile markers (see Table 2.2).
These collected data can be used to determine average rates of change. For example, between
mile 0 and mile 42, the average speed (average rate of change of distance) is 64.6 mph. This aver-
age rate of change is illustrated as the slope of a secant line in Figure 2.7.
Average speed cannot be used to answer the following question:
If the speed limit is 65 mph and a highway patrol officer with a radar gun clocks the car’s
speed at mile post 22, was the driver exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph?
The only way to answer this question is to know the car’s speed at the instant that the radar
locked onto the car. This speed is the instantaneous rate of change of distance with respect to
time–measured in miles per hour.

Measures of Change at a Point–Graphical
139
Tangent Lines and Local Linearity
Just as average rate of change measures the slope of a secant line between two points, instantaneous
rate of change measures the slope of the graph of a function at a single point. The slope of a graph
of a function can be defined at a point if the function is continuous and smooth (has no sharp
corners) over an interval around that point.
For any smooth, continuous function, the graph of the function will appear linear if the
graph is restricted to a suitably narrow input interval. 
The callouts in Figure 2.8 illustrate local linearity. When a smooth, continuous curve is
graphed over a small input interval, the curve will appear linear.

The words tangent and tangency are used when discussing functions:
•
The line that touches a graph at a given point and is sloped the same way as the graph at
that point, is tangent to the graph. This line is the tangent line at that point.
•
The point where the tangent line touches the graph is known as the point of tangency.
Figure 2.8 shows dashed lines drawn tangent to the mileage function graph at 1:17 P.M., 1:54

Secant and Tangent Lines
In calculus, a tangent line is defined using secant lines and the concept of a limiting value as the
input approaches a constant. The relationship between secant lines and tangent lines can be
illustrated using points on a simple curve as in Figure 2.10. This figure shows points 
that
approach point 
from the left.
Figure 2.11 shows the tangent line at 
and two secant lines (dotted) through points to the
left of T: one drawn through 
and 
and the other drawn through 
and . The secant line
through 
and

Similarly, Figure 2.12 shows the tangent line at 
and two secant lines (dotted) through
points to the right of T. Again, the secant line whose second point is closer to

with slope closer to the tilt of the graph at .

Tangent Lines on Curves
Although thinking of a tangent line as a limiting position of secant lines is key to an understand-
ing of calculus, it is important to have an intuitive feel for tangent lines and to be able to draw
them without first drawing secant lines. In general, a tangent line lies very close to the curve near
the point but does not cut through the curve.
General Rule for Tangent Lines
Lines tangent to a smooth, nonlinear graph do not cut through the graph at the point of
tangency and lie completely on one side of the graph near the point of tangency except at
an inflection point. 
If the curve is concave up at the point of tangency (see Figure 2.13), the tangent line lies below
the curve near the point of tangency. If the curve is concave down at the point of tangency (see
Figure 2.14), the tangent line lies above the curve near the point of tangency.
For the graph of a linear function,
the only way to draw a line tan-
gent to the graph at any point is
to draw a line directly on top of
the graph of the linear function.

An Exception to the General Rule for Tangent Lines—Inflection Points At a point of inflec-
tion, the graph is concave up on one side and concave down on the other. The tangent line at an
inflection point lies above the concave-down portion of the graph and below the concave-up
portion; it cuts through the graph at the point of inflection. Figure 2.17 shows the correctly
drawn tangent line at an inflection point P. The correctly drawn tangent line is the dashed black
line labeled t.

R e f e r  t o  T i m e ?
The use of the word instantaneous
in the context of measuring change
arose from the need to understand
how rapidly the distance traveled
changes as a function of time.
Today, the use of the word instan-
taneous in connection with rates of
change does not necessarily mean
that time units are involved.
For example, suppose that a graph
depicts a function for profit (in dol-
lars) resulting from the sale of a cer-
tain number of used cars. In this
case, the instantaneous rate of
change at any particular point
expresses how rapidly profit is
changing per car. The unit of mea-
sure for the rate of change is dollars
per car; no time units are involved.

The two dashed gray lines in Figure 2.17, line s and line r, are not tangent to the curve at the
inflection point. Both of these lines cut through the curve at the inflection point. Line s is too
steep and does not even appear to follow the same slope as the curve. Line r is not steep enough
so that it actually lies below the curve for a small interval to the left of the inflection point and
above the curve for a small interval to the right of the inflection point.

Slopes and Steepness
Understanding how the slope of a graph differs at different points will be useful in drawing tan-
gent lines accurately as well as in sketching and interpreting graphs of functions.

b. The steepness of the graph is a measure of how much the graph is tilted at a particular point.
The direction of tilt is not considered when we are describing steepness. Thus, the points in
order of steepness are B, D, C, A.
c. The mean plasma concentration after 0.31 hours is increasing by 
per hour.
Rates of Change and Percentage Rates of Change
The slope of a graph at a point is defined as the slope of the line tangent to the graph at that point.
This slope is interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of the function at that point. For sim-
plicity, the word instantaneous is dropped and the instantaneous rate of change is called the rate of
change. For a function f with input x, the rate of change of f at x is denoted 
.
f 	(x)
22.4 g/mL
Rate of Change of a Function
At a point on a smooth, continuous function f, the rate of change of the function is
given by the slope of the line tangent to a graph of f (unless the tangent line is vertical).
The rate of change of f is denoted 
. 
f 	(x)
Because instantaneous rates of
change measure change occur-
ring at a point, it is proper to use
the progressive tense when writ-
ing instantaneous rate of change
statements.
The following statements are equivalent.
•
The slope of the graph of the plasma concentration function at 0.31 hours is
per hour.
•
The slope of the line tangent to the plasma concentration function at 0.31 hours is
per hour.
•
The rate of change of plasma concentration at 0.31 hours is a 
per hour.
In context:
•
Nineteen minutes after being dosed with two 500 mg caplets of Tylenol, the mean
plasma concentration of the drug is increasing by 
per hour.

Percentage change is found by dividing change over an interval by the output at the beginning of
the interval. Similarly, percentage rate of change (in decimal form) can be found by dividing the
rate of change at a point by the function value at the same point. The units of a percentage rate of
change are percent per single input unit.
Percentage Rate of Change of a Function
For a smooth, continuous function f, if the rate of change 
exists for a certain input
value 
and 
, then
The unit of measure of percentage rate of change is percent per single unit of input.

Quick Example
A city planner estimates that the city’s population is increasing at a rate of 50,000 people
per year.
•
If the current population is 200,000 people, then the percentage rate of change of
the population is
•
If the current population is 2 million, then the percentage rate of change of the pop-
ulation is
50,000 people per year
2,000,000 people

 100%  2.5% per year
50,000 people per year
200,000 people

 100%  2.5% per year
Percentage rates of change are useful in describing the relative magnitude of growth. The steps
that a city planner must take to accommodate growth if the city is growing by 2.5% per year are
different from the steps he must take if the city is growing by 2.5% per year. Expressing a rate of
change as a percentage puts the rate in the context of the current size and adds more meaning to
the interpretation of the rate of change.

For a smooth, continuous function f with a specific input a, 
is used to represent the fol-
lowing quantities, all of which are interchangeable:
•
the derivative of f at a
•
the slope of a graph of f at point 
•
the slope of the line tangent to a graph of f at point 
•
the rate of change of f at a.

Derivative Terminology and Notation
The rate of change of a function f at a specific input a is commonly written 
. Because the
rate of change, 
, is derived from the output 
, it is referred to as the derivative of f at
input a.
f (a)

When it is desirable to express the
input variable along with the deriv-
ative notation, the
following notation is used:

Quick Example
The valid interpretation statement
“At the end of the sixth fiscal year, Apple Corporation’s 
annual net sales were increasing by approximately 
4.51 trillion dollars per year.”
specifies
when: at the end of the sixth fiscal year
what: Apple Corporation’s annual net sales
how: were increasing (progressive tense)
by how much: by approximately 4.51 trillion
dollars per year
and includes no technical language.
Quick Example
The statement
“The slope of the line tangent to the annual net sales graph at 
is 4.51.”
is not a valid interpretation of  
. It is a correct statement, but 
it uses technical words that a person who has not studied calculus probably would not
understand. The variables s and t are used with no meaning attached and units are not
included with the value 4.51.

Quick Example
The statement

at the end of 6 years is 4.51 trillion dollars per year.”
is not a valid interpretation of 
. Even though the statement is technically
correct, it only restates the mathematical symbols in words without giving the meaning of
the derivative in the real-life context.
s	(6)  4.51
Quick Example
The statement
“Annual net sales increased by 4.51 trillion dollars after 6 years.”
is not a valid interpretation of 
. The use of the word increased refers to
change over an interval of time, not to change occurring at a point in time. The state-
ment is mathematically incorrect.
s	(6)  4.51
Interpretations of Derivatives
Because a rate of change is a measure that describes something that is in the process of changing,
the interpretation must be in the progressive tense (verbs ending with –ing). The sentence should
include information answering the questions when? what? how? and by how much?

Function Graphs from Derivative Information
A sketch of a function can be made using information about the function and/or its derivative at
several points.

is the average concentration (in nanograms per milliliter, 
) of a drug in the blood-
stream h hours after the administration of a dose of 360 mg. On the basis of the following infor-

•
The concentration after 24 hours is 
higher than it was when the dose was
administered.
•
The concentration of the drug is increasing most rapidly after 4 hours.
•
The maximum concentration of 
occurs after 8 hours.
•
Between 
and 
, the concentration declines at a constant rate of 
per hour.
Solution
The information about 
at various values of h simply locates points on the graph of C. Plot
the points (0, 124), (4, 252), (8, 380), and (24, 159.9).
Because 
, the curve has a horizontal tangent at (0, 124). The point of most rapid
increase, (4, 252), is an inflection point. The graph is concave up to the left of that point and con-
cave down to the right. The maximum concentration occurs after 8 hours, so the highest point on
the graph of C is (8, 380). Concentration declining at a constant rate between 
and 
means that over that interval, C is a line with

Rates of Change—Numerical Limits 
and Nonexistence
The rate of change of a function at a point is equivalent to the slope of the line tangent to a graph
of that function at that point. A rate of change can be estimated numerically by using limits and
slopes of secant lines.
Slopes—Numerically
Figure 2.26 shows a graph of 
along with the line tangent to f at 
. The slope of
the tangent line, 
, is estimated as the limiting position of secant lines through the point
and other increasingly close points. Figure 2.27 illustrates a magnified
view of the secant line through 
and 
.
Following the same numerical technique for estimating limits as used in Section 1.3, slopes of
secants for values of x approaching 4 are evaluated in Table 2.3 and Table 2.4.

CHAPTER 2
Describing Change: Rates
162
We do not consider tangents or
differentiability at end points of
intervals because these concepts
are defined using a small interval
to both the left and right of the
point.
Points Where Derivatives Do Not Exist
If a function is not continuous or has a sharp corner at a point P, the rate of change does
not exist at that point.
If a continuous function has a point P where the tangent line at P is a vertical line,
the rate of change does not exist at that point.  
Rates of Change and Differentiability
If the rate of change of a function exists at a given point, the function is said to be differentiable at
that point. Further, if the rate of change of a function exists for every point on an open interval,
the function is differentiable on that interval.    
Differentiable Function
A function is differentiable at a point if the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) of
that function exists at that point. A function is differentiable over an open interval if
the instantaneous rate of change (derivative) of that function exists for every point whose
input is in that interval. 
The use of the term differentiable to describe the existence of instantaneous rates of change comes
from the concept of derivatives.
Points Where Derivatives Do Not Exist
The graph in Figure 2.30 has a rate of change corresponding to each input value within the inter-
val (except end points). However, not every function has a rate of change defined for every input
value. For example, consider the graphs in Figure 2.31 through Figure 2.33.
The graph in Figure 2.31 has a rate of change at every point within the interval except for P.
The tangent line at P is vertical and the slope is undefined.
A point such as P in Figure 2.32 is described as a sharp corner because secant lines joining P
to close points on either side of P have different limiting slopes. The tangent line at P does not
exist for the function in Figure 2.32 because secant lines drawn with points on the right and left
do not approach the same slope.
The graph in Figure 2.33 has a break at P and, therefore, is not continuous at P. The slope
does not exist at the break in the function, even though the slope does exist at all other points on
an open interval of the graph.
The graphs in Figure 2.30 through Figure 2.33 illustrate a general rule relating continuity
and rates of change.

Determining Differentiability
Population of Indiana (Historic)
Figure 2.34 shows the population of Indiana by official census from 1950 through 2000.
The equation of the graph in Figure 2.34 is
where output is given in million people and t is the number of decades since 1900.
a. Can a tangent line be drawn at the point where the function f is not continuous
(1990)?
b. Is there an instantaneous rate of change in the population of Indiana in 1990? Can
the instantaneous rate of change be determined using the model f at 
? Explain
how the rate of change could be determined.
Solution
a. A line tangent to the graph at 
cannot be drawn because the graph is not continuous at
this input value.
b. In context, the population of Indiana is a continuous function over time and therefore has a
rate of change in 1990. However, the function f cannot be used to calculate the rate of change
in 1990.
If it is necessary to determine the instantaneous rate of change at 1990 (the point of disconti-
nuity of f ), it would be advisable either to use a secant line estimate (an average rate of change)
or, if possible, to remodel the data with a function that would be continuous and differentiable
at this point.

Rates of Change Defined over Intervals
The rate of change at a specific point on a function can be represented as the limiting value of the
slopes of secant lines through that point and a series of close points. This limit of slopes can be
generalized algebraically as a formula that gives the rate of change for a function f at every input x
over an interval.
Derivative Functions—Algebraically
When estimating the limit of the slopes of secants in Section 2.4, the process rather than the nota-
tion was emphasized. The notation for this process is
Using this technique, it is possible to estimate the rate of change at specific points. This process
also leads to a formula for the rate of change of f at any given input x.
Developing the Derivative Formula: (Refer to Figure 2.35.)
f  	(a)   lim 
x→a  f (x)  f (a)
x  a
23.
Discuss any advantages or disadvantages of finding rates of
change graphically and numerically. Include a brief descrip-
tion of when each method might be appropriate to use.
24.
Explain why there may be differences between the numer-
ical estimate of a rate of change of a modeled function at a
point and the actual rate of change that occurred in the
underlying real-world situation.
25.
Most piecewise-defined continuous functions have dis-
continuities at their break points. Consider, however,
piecewise-defined continuous functions that are continu-
ous at their break points. Is it possible to draw a tangent
line at a break point for such a function? Discuss how
and why this might or might not happen. Use these two
functions as examples:

The process of using the limit def-

develop a formula for the deriva-

the algebraic method.
The algebraic method works well
for linear and quadratic equations.
The algebra becomes more com-
plicated when applied to a square
root function or a polynomial of
degree greater than 2.

The common factor h is not
cancelled from the numerator and
denominator in the slope formula
unless the limit notation is
present.
Canceling h changes the slope
function–it fills in a hole. However,
during the process of finding the
limit, h can be cancelled because
a hole in a graph does not affect
the value of a limit. This is known
as the cancellation property of
limits.

Rates of Change from Different Perspectives
The rate of change of a function at a point can be estimated graphically as the slope of the tan-
gent line at that point. It can be estimated numerically as the limit of the slopes of secant lines
passing through that point and a series of closer points. It can be calculated algebraically as the
derivative of the function evaluated at that point. Example 3 shows each of these three methods.

The definition of the derivative of a function gives us a formula for the slope graph of the func-
tion. It is presented here for only a few simple functions to obtain an understanding of how rate-
of-change functions are developed from the limits of slopes of secant lines. However, the algebraic

Rate-of-Change Graphs
Every smooth, continuous curve with no vertical tangent lines has a slope associated with each
point on the curve. When these slopes are plotted, they form a smooth, continuous curve. The
resulting curve is called  a slope graph, rate-of-change graph, or derivative graph.

selected input values.

Quick Example
The function k in Figure 2.48 is
decreasing and has slopes that are
decreasing.
Drawing lines tangent to a function’s graph is helpful when estimating the relative magnitude of
the slopes of that graph. As the process of sketching slope graphs becomes more familiar, it should
be possible to visualize the tangent lines mentally (instead of drawing them) to consider the steep-
ness of the graph at different points.
Some important points (or intervals) to consider when observing functions for slope behavior are:
•
Points at which a tangent line is horizontal.
•
Intervals over which the graph is increasing or decreasing.
•
Points of inflection.
•
Places at which the graph appears to be horizontal or leveling off.
Details of Slope Graphs
When a graph has numbered tick marks on both the horizontal and the vertical axes or an
equation for the graph is known, it is possible to estimate the values of slopes at certain points
on the graph. However, it would be to evaluate the slopes for every point on the graph. In fact,
because there are infinitely many points on a continuous curve. Instead, the slope is calculated
at a few special points, such as maximum, minimum, and inflection points, to obtain a more
accurate slope graph.
Figure 2.50 shows a graph of a function f with a maximum, an inflection point, and a min-
imum. Because there is a numerical scale on both axes, estimates of 
can be made graphically
for several values of x to help sketch the slope graph of f.
The slope graph of f crosses the horizontal axis at 
and 
, and a minimum
occurs on the slope graph below the horizontal axis at 
. Graphical estimates of slopes of
tangent lines drawn at the inflection point and two additional points (see Figure 2.51) are
used to help in sketching the graph of 
in Figure 2.52.

b. The population graph is fairly level in the early 1800s, so the slope graph will begin near zero.
The smooth sketched curve increases during the 1800s and early 1900s until it peaks in the
1940s. Thus, the slope graph will be positive until the 1940s when it crosses the horizontal
axis and becomes negative. Population decreased from the mid-1940s onward.
There appear to be two inflection points. The point of most rapid growth appears around
1910, and the point of most rapid decline appears near 1975. These are the years in which
the slope graph will be at its maximum and at its minimum, respectively.

Drawing tangent lines at 1910 and at 1975 and estimating their slopes, shows that population
was increasing by approximately 22,500 people per year in 1910 and was decreasing by approxi-
mately 12,500 people per year in 1975. See Figure 2.54.

All of the information from this analysis leads to sketch the slope graph shown in
Figure 2.55.
Of course, if a formula for the graph were available, the slopes at a few points could be esti-
mated numerically instead of graphically. Even so, an understanding of curvature and horizontal-
axis intercepts would be needed to sketch the rate-of-change graph adequately.
Points of Undefined Slope
It is possible for the graph of a function to have a point at which the slope does not exist. If the
limits of the slopes of the secant lines from the left and from the right are not the same, the deriv-
ative does not exist at that point. The nonexistence of the derivative at a specific input value is
indicated by drawing an open dot on each piece of the slope graph at that input value. The graph
and slope graph of a function that is nondifferentiable at a point are shown in Figure 2.56 and
Figure 2.57.
It is possible for there to be a point on a graph at which the derivative does not exist, even
though the limits of the slopes of the secant lines from the left and from the right are the same.

If a function is not continuous at a point, then its slope is undefined at that point (see
Figure 2.58 and Figure 2.59).
The slope calculation results in a zero in the denominator for points at which the tangent line
is vertical. The slope at such points is considered to be undefined. The graph and slope graph of
one such function are shown in Figure 2.60 and Figure 2.61.

CHAPTER 2
Describing Change: Rates

CHAPTER SUMMARY
Change, Average Rate of Change,
and Percentage Change
The change in a quantity over an interval is the difference of out-
put values. Apart from expressing the actual change in a quantity
that occurs over an interval, change can be described as the aver-
age rate of change over an interval or as a percentage change. The
numerical description of an average rate of change has an associ-
ated graphical interpretation—the slope of the secant line join-
ing two points on a graph.
Instantaneous Rates of Change and
Percentage Rate of Change
Average rates of change indicate how rapidly a quantity changes
(on average) over an interval. Instantaneous rates of change indi-
cate how rapidly a quantity is changing at a point. The instanta-
neous rate of change at a point on a graph is the slope of the line
tangent to the graph at that point.
Rates of change can also be expressed as percentages. A per-
centage rate of change describes the relative magnitude of the
change.
Tangent Lines
Local linearity guarantees that the graph of any continuous
function appears linear when magnified.
The line tangent to a graph at a point P is the limiting position
of nearby secant can be estimated the instantaneous rate of
change at a point on a curve by sketching a tangent line at that
point and estimating the tangent line’s slope.
Derivatives
Derivative is the calculus term for (instantaneous) rate of change.
Accordingly, all of the following terms are synonymous: deriva-
tive, instantaneous rate of change, rate of change, slope of the
curve, and slope of the line tangent to the curve.
Three common ways of symbolically referring to the derivative
of a function f with respect to x are 
, and 
. The
proper units on derivatives are output units per input unit.
Numerically and Algebraically
Finding Slopes
When given the algebraic representation for a function, it is pos-
sible to estimate the slope of the tangent line at a point on the
function with numerical approximations of the limit of slopes of
secant lines. The method of numerically estimating slopes can be
generalized to provide a valuable algebraic method for finding
formulas for slopes at any input value. This algebraic method
yields the formal definition of a derivative: For a continuous
function f with respect to x,
provided that the limit exists.

Drawing Slope Graphs
The smooth, continuous graphs used to model real-life data
have slopes at every point on the graph except at points that
have vertical tangent lines. When these slopes are plotted, they
usually form a smooth, continuous graph—the slope graph
(rate-of-change graph or derivative graph) of the original
graph. Slope graphs can indicate some of the changes such
as intervals of increase or decrease or the input location of
relative extrema or inflection points occurring on the
original graph.

The aging of the American population may be one of the demographic changes that
has the greatest impact on our society over the next several decades. Given a model
for the projected number of senior Americans (65 years of age or older), the func-
tion and its derivative can be used to answer the following questions:
•
What is the projected number of senior Americans in 2030? (Section 3.1, Activity 31)
•
What is the projected rate of change in the number of senior Americans in 2030?
(Section 3.1, Activity 31)
•
What is the projected percentage rate of change in the number of senior Americans
in 2030? (Section 3.1, Activity 31)

CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Change can be described in terms of rates: average rates, instantaneous rates, and percentage rates.
Of these three, instantaneous rates are the most important in the study of calculus. The definition
of the derivative can be used to develop a formula for the instantaneous rate of change of a func-
tion for any input.
In this chapter, the definition of derivative is used to develop some rules for derivatives: the
Simple Power Rule, the Constant Multiplier Rule, the Sum and Difference Rules, the Chain Rule,
the Product Rule, and the Quotient Rule. These rules provide the foundation needed to work with
more complicated functions that model change.
3.1
Simple Rate-of-Change Formulas
Rates of change have been discussed graphically, numerically, and algebraically. The limit defini-
tion of the derivative allowed calculation of rate-of-change formulas for a few polynomial and
constant functions. Derivative formulas for power functions and the related functions formed by
addition, subtraction, and multiplication by a constant are presented in this section.
Rates of Change of Constant Functions
A constant function is of the form 
and is represented graphically as a horizontal line.
There is no change taking place, so the slope of the horizontal line and the rate of change of the
constant function are zero.
f (x)  b
Constant Rule for Derivatives
If 
, then 
.  
f  (x)  0
f (x)  b
The rules presented in this sec-
tion will be combined at the end
of the section so that derivative
functions for any polynomial
function may be obtained.
The rate of change of speed (acceleration) at
any time t is
where t is time in minutes. (See Figure 3.2)

Rate-of-Change Functions for Functions 
with Constant Multipliers
All of the functions used in this text to model data contain constant multipliers. The effect of a
constant multiplier on the rate-of-change of a function is illustrated with three pairs of figures on
the following page. 
Quick Example
The derivative of 
is
f  (x)  4x41  4x5
f (x)  x4
Quick Example
The derivative of 
is
f  (x)  0.7x0.71  0.7x0.3
f (x)  x0.7
Rates of Change of Power Functions
In Example 3 of Section 2.5, the limit definition of a derivative was used to show that the rate-of-
change function for 
is 
. The function 
is an example of a power
function. A power function is a function of the form 
where x is the input variable and
n is a nonzero real number. It is possible to prove, using the limit definition of derivative, that the
rate of change function for the power function 
is 
. This relationship is
known as the Simple Power Rule for derivatives.    
f  (x)  nxn1
f (x)  xn
f (x)  xn
f (x)  x2
f  (x)  2x
f (x)  x2
Derivatives of models are them-
selves models and should be
labeled with all the elements of a
model. Because the input of a
derivative is the same as that of the
associated function, we sometimes
do not restate it when the deriva-
tive is presented with the original
function. However, if the two func-
tions are likely to be separated, the
input description and interval
should be repeated.

In fact, using the limit definition of derivatives, it can be shown that the constant multiplier
acts on the rate-of-change function exactly as it acts on the original function. This relationship is
known as the Constant Multiplier Rule for derivatives.
A graphical demonstration is not
a proof. However, it can assist in
presenting the concept.
•
Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8 demonstrate that a negative constant multiplier has the
same effect on the rate-of-change function as it does on the original function. The
negative constant multiplier flips the graph across the horizontal axis.
•
Figure 3.3 shows the graph of a function f along with the graph of a function that is a
constant multiple of f, 
. The effect of the multiplier 3 is to amplify the output
of a function.
•
Figure 3.4 shows the rate-of-change graphs for the functions f and g. The constant multi-
plier appears to have the same amplifying effect on the behavior of the rate-of-change
function.
•
Figure 3.5 and Figure 3.6 show the graphs of functions k, 
, and 
and
the rate-of-change graphs , , and 
. The effect of a constant multiplier between 0
and 1 is to diminish the output of a function. The same effect appears in the behavior
of the rate-of-change functions.

Applying Derivative Rules to a Model
Maintenance Costs
Table 3.1 gives the maintenance costs for vehicles driven for 15,000 miles in the United States
from 1993 through 2000. The maintenance costs given are yearly averages.
The maintenance cost for a vehicle driven for 15,000 miles can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since 1993, data from 
. This model is
graphed in Figure 3.17.
a. Write a rate-of-change model for the maintenance cost model.
b. Use the rate-of-change model to approximate how rapidly maintenance costs
were increasing in 1998.
Solution
a. The derivative function of g is calculated as
So
gives the rate of change in the maintenance cost t years since 1993, data from 
.
b. Evaluating the derivative at 
gives $44.92 per year as the rate of change. In1998, the
maintenance cost for a vehicle operated for 15,000 miles was increasing by approximately
$44.92 per year.

Exponential, Logarithmic, and Cyclic 
Rate-of-Change Formulas
General rules for writing rate-of-change functions of exponential, logarithmic, and cyclic func-
tions are given in this section. These rules are explored from graphical and numerical
perspectives.
Rates of Change of Exponential Functions
A graph of the function 
is shown in Figure 3.18.
Based on the behavior exhibited by the graph, the following deductions about the rate-
of-change function f
can be made:
•
As 
, f approaches a horizontal asymptote and the lines tangent to f become
almost horizontal:
.
•
As 
, f increases without bound and the lines tangent to f become steeper:
.
•
The concave-up, increasing behavior of f is reflected in concave-up, increasing
behavior of the slopes f .
These deductions combined with numerical estimates of slope values for a few
input values (see Table 3.2) can be used to sketch a fairly accurate slope graph (as in
Figure 3.19).

Deductions about the slope function 
can be made based on the behavior of the function f:
•
is defined only for positive input values because f is defined only for positive input values.
•
is always positive (for 
) because f is increasing.
•
because as 
, the lines tangent to f become so steep that they are
almost vertical.
•
is decreasing because as

Rates of Change for Functions That Can 
Be Composed
The simple derivative rules make it possible to write rate-of-change functions for linear, exponen-
tial, logarithmic, quadratic, and cubic models. Logistic models, sine models, and other functions
are constructed through composition of more basic functions. The Chain Rule for derivatives is
used to write rate-of-change functions for functions that are compositions of simple functions.
Graphs for Function Composition
As temperature decreases, the sound made by crickets decreases over time. This natural phenomenon
is a composition of two functions: cricket sounds given temperature and temperature given time.
Figure 3.29 through Figure 3.31 illustrate the effect of composition on rate of change.

The average number of times that a cricket chirps each minute is affected by air temperature.
Figure 3.29 illustrates this function (the number of chirps, f, as a function of the temperature,
t degrees Fahrenheit) along with tangent lines and rates of change at 53°F, 60°F, and 70°F.
Figure 3.30 shows the temperature t on a typical late-summer evening in south-central
Michigan as a function of time h, measured in hours after sunset. The rates of change of tempera-
ture with respect to time for temperatures of 53°F, 60°F, and 70°F are also illustrated in Figure 3.30. 
Figure 3.31 shows the composition, 
, giving chirps as a function of time.
Vertical lines in this figure represent the times at which the temperature was 53°F, 60°F, and 70°F.
along with the rates of change for these temperatures. The rates of change represented by lines tan-
gent to the 
graph are measured in chirps per hour. Notice that the rates of change are the
products of the corresponding rates of change for the functions f and t.
The Chain Rule for Functions That Can Be Composed
When the input of a function is itself a function (as in the previous example, in which 
is an
input for 
),
•
the result is a composite function.
•
the rate of change of the output function is multiplied by (scaled by) the rate of change of
the input function to calculate the rate of change of the composite function:
This rule is the Chain Rule for derivatives. It links the derivatives of two functions to obtain the
derivative of their composite function.

Example 1
Using the First Form of the Chain Rule
Violin Production
Let 
denote the average cost, in dollars, to produce a student violin when v violins are pro-
duced. Let 
represent the number of student violins produced in year t. Suppose that in 2011,
10,000 student violins are produced and production is increasing by 100 violins per year. Also sup-
pose that in 2011, the average cost to produce a student violin is $142.10, and the average cost is
decreasing by 0.15 dollars per violin.
a. Draw an input/output diagram of the average cost to produce a student violin as a function
of time.
b. Calculate the rate of change of the average cost to produce student violins with respect to
time in 2011. Interpret this rate of change.
Solution
a. An input/output diagram of the average cost as a function of time is shown in Figure 3.32.
b. For 
, 
violins per year, and the rate of change of 
in 
2011 is 
dollars per violin. Using the Chain Rule,
In 2011, the average cost to produce a violin is declining by $15 per year.
When formulas are given for the functions to be composed, a formula for the rate-of-change
function can be developed.

The two rates of change differ by a factor of 10. The rate of change with respect to x is mea-
sured in thousand people per year and the number is 0.1 times the magnitude of the rate of
change of population with respect to d, which is measured in thousand people per decade.
Example 2 illustrates that scaling the input affects the rate of change of the composite output func-
tion. If the input is not scaled but simply shifted (as is most often the case), the rate of change of the
input function is 1 and there is no impact on the rate of change of the composite output function.
Derivatives of Functions That Can Be Nested
The Chain Rule can be repeated as many times as necessary to work on sets of functions that can
be composed in a nested fashion.
For example, consider the functions (along with their derivatives)
These functions can be nested using composition to form
Applying the Chain Rule three times, the derivative

Rates of Change of Composite Functions
Sometimes a function is given in composite form instead of being presented as separate functions
that can be combined through composition. When a function is presented in composite form,
once the inside and outside functions are identified, a rate-of-change formula for the composite
function can be found using the Chain Rule for Derivatives.
The Chain Rule for Composite Functions
If a function is already expressed as a result of function composition (that is, if it is a combi-
nation of an inside function and an outside function), then its slope formula can be found as
follows:

Rates of Change for Functions 
That Can Be Multiplied
It is fairly common to construct a new function by multiplying two functions. Each of the two func-
tions used in the multiplication affect the rate of change of the product. This leads to the Product
Rule for derivatives.

public colleges and universities can be calculated by multiplying the total number of students times
the tuition paid by those students. Enrollment and tuition can each be modeled as functions of
time. When x represents the number of years since the fall semester of 1999, enrollment and
tuition are given by the following functions:
•
The function s gives the number of full-time students in American public colleges and uni-
versities where output is measured in million students.
•
The function t is the average amount of tuition paid by a full-time student in an American
public college or university where output is measured in thousand dollars per student.
Graphs of functions s and t are shown in Figures 3.39 and 3.40.

CHAPTER 3
Determining Change:Derivatives
228
Rate-of-Change Notation for Function Multiplication
The method used for determining the rate of change in total expenditure on public college tuition
is known as the Product Rule for derivatives and can be remembered as
Product Rule for Derivatives
If f and g are differentiable functions of x, the derivative of the product function
is
(  f  g)(x)  f  (x)  g(x)  g(x)  f (x)
(  f  g)(x)  f (x)  g(x)
If a function is the product of two functions, that is,
then
The product rule for derivatives can be proved mathematically, and it is notated as follows:

Example 1
Using the Product Rule without an Equation
Egg Production
In March 2010, a poultry farmer had 30,000 laying hens, and he was increasing his flock by 500
laying hens per month. In March 2010, the monthly laying capacity was 21 eggs per hen and the
laying capacity was increasing by 0.2 eggs per hen per month.
(Source: Based on data from USDA)
a. Use function notation to write the monthly egg production and the rate of change in monthly
egg production with respect to time. Align the months so that 
in December 2009.
b. How many eggs did the farm produce in March 2010?
c. How quickly was egg production changing in March 2010? Interpret the result.
Solution
a. Egg production at month m is the product of flock size 
and the laying capacity 
:
Applying the Product Rule yields the formula for the rate of change for egg production as
b. For March 2010, 
, so

I N  C O N T E X T
The industrialization of chicken
(and egg) farming brought
improvements to the production
rate of eggs. By selling or buying
layers (laying hens), the farmer
can decrease or increase produc-
tion. Also, by selective breeding
and genetic research as well as
by changes in environmental
conditions and diet, it is possible
that over a period of time, the
farmer can increase the average
laying capacity of the hens.

Students with Financial Aid
The percentage of post-secondary students with some form of financial aid has risen over the years
and can be approximated by the linear model
f (x)  3.09x  54.18 percent
So a model for the rate of change of total expenditure on tuition and required fees is
where output is measured in billion dollars per year and 
represents fall 2000, 
represents fall 2001, etc.
Often, product functions are formed by multiplying a quantity function by a function that indi-
cates the proportion or percentage of that quantity for which a certain statement is true. This is

c. Determine the rate at which the number of full-time students with financial aid was
increasing in fall 2010. Write a sentence of interpretation for the result.
Solution
a. Because the function f reports a percentage, when using a percentage in a product function,
the percentage must be converted to decimal form. Working with this percentage-to-decimal
conversion as well as analyzing the units of measure for the product function before
continuing will help simplify keeping track of units later:

Wheat Farming
A wheat farmer is converting to corn
because he believes that corn is a more lucrative crop. It is
not feasible for him to convert all his acreage to corn at
once. He is farming 500 acres of corn in the current year
and is increasing that number by 50 acres per year. As he
becomes more experienced in growing corn, his output
increases. He currently harvests 130 bushels of corn per
acre, but the yield is increasing by 5 bushels per acre per
year. When both the increasing acreage and the increasing
yield are considered, how rapidly is the total number of
bushels of corn increasing per year?

Rates of Change of Product Functions
Some models are constructed as product functions but do not start as separate models. Once the
factor functions of the product are identified, the Product Rule for derivates can be applied in
order to develop a rate-of-change function for the model.
A Product Function’s Rate of Change
The concentration levels of zolpidem tartrate (the active ingredient in Ambien) in the bloodstream
after an oral dose of 5 mg is an example of a model that is a product of functions. The concentration
levels can be modeled as
where t is the number of hours after a single dose is administered. See Figure 3.45.

. The rate of change of zolpidem
tartrate in the bloodstream can be modeled as

Products with Compositions
Not all product functions are made up of simple components as in the surge function illustrated
above. Sometimes the product function includes a factor that is also a composite function, as in

Limit Rules Revisited
Limits are used to define the continuity of functions modeling data sets. Limits are also used to
examine the behavior of a function at a point as well as its end behavior. The replacement rules
(sometimes called direct substitution) are used as a first effort to evaluate the limit at a point.

Indeterminate Forms of Quotients and Products
Replacement is generally used as the first step in evaluating a limit. The limit may be apparent after
replacing the value that the input is approaching in the function. However, occasionally, the result-
ing expression found using replacement will result in an indeteminate form.
Indeterminate Forms
The forms ,

analysis, it is impossible to determine the actual limit.

Limits and L’Hôpital’s Rule
If applying the replacement rules to evaluate the limit of a quotient or a product results in one of
the indeterminate forms, L’Hôpital’s Rule may be used as another method of evaluating the limit.
L’Hôpital’s Rule
When functions f and g with input x are differentiable (except possibly at 
) and
, then
provided the limit on the right side of the equation exists.
lim

In 1696, the French mathemati-
cian Guillaume de l’Hôpital
(1661–1704) first published a
result relating the limit of the ratio
of two functions to the limit of the
ratio of their derivatives. This
result is now known as L’Hôpital’s
Rule even though it was actually
discovered by L’Hôpital’s mentor,
Johann Bernoulli.

The ratio of two functions and the ratio of their slope functions have the same limit-
ing value.  
L’Hôpital’s Rule can be stated:
Quick Example
Evaluating the limit of 
as x increases without bound, using end-behavior analysis, leads 
to the indeterminate form 
.
•
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule: 
.
•
Evaluating 
, using end-behavior analysis: 
.
•
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule again: 
.
•
Evaluating 
, using end-behavior analysis:

So 
That is, as x increases without bound, 
also increases without bound.

CHAPTER SUMMARY
The first of the two major concepts of calculus is the derivative.
The derivative formula for a function gives the rate of change of
that function for any input value.
Formulas for derivatives of common functions can be used to
streamline the process of finding a derivative.

In order to stay competitive on the New York Stock Exchange many companies have
had to rethink their strategies for increasing revenue and sustaining profitability.
Derivatives can be used to analyze models in economics and answer the following
questions:
•
During which week of a sales campaign is revenue from the sale of new cable
subscriptions expected to peak? (Section 4.2, Example 3)
•
When was Polo Ralph Lauren revenue growing most rapidly? (Section 4.4,
Activity 36)
•
How quickly will total revenues from the new-car industry change when the industry
invests $6.5 billion in advertising? (Section 4.5, Activity 14)
•
What size tour-groups will produce the largest revenue for the travel agency? (Section 4.6,

Analyzing Change: Applications of Derivatives
250
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Rate-of-change information can be used in several ways to analyze change. Rates of change and
linearization are used to make short-term predictions.
Rates of change are used for optimization analysis by considering the places at which the rate
of change is zero. In many cases, these points correspond to local or absolute maximum or mini-
mum function values. 
Derivatives are used in economics as they apply to marginal analysis, classical optimization,
and related rates.
4.1
Linearization and Estimates
In a small interval around a point on a differentiable function, the function and the line tangent
to the function at that point appear to be the same. This phenomenon is called local linearity. The
rate of change of a function may be used to approximate the change in a function over a small
input interval. 
An Approximation of Change
The average retail price during the 1990s of a pound of salted, grade AA butter can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since 1990. A graph of p along with a tangent line at 
is shown
in Figure 4.1. (Simplified model based on data from Statistical Abstract, 1998)

Using the rate of change to approximate change, the following estimates can be made:
•
During 1999, the price of butter increased by approximately $0.54 to a price of $3.50.
•
Over the first half of the year 1999, the price increased by approximately $0.27 (half of
$0.54) to a price of $3.23.
Estimates of Change
Within a small neighborhood around the point of tangency, a line tangent to a function is a good
approximation of the function.
Approximate Change
For a small change h in the input x of a differentiable function f, the rate of change of f
times the small change in the input can be used to approximate the change in the output
of f. That is, for a constant input c
Refer to Figure 4.3.

Analyzing Change: Applications of Derivatives

A change in function output 
from the point of tangency 
to a nearby point
can be estimated by the change in the output of the tangent line over the same
input interval. That change is computed as the slope of the tangent line times the length of the
interval:
 h  f (c)  h
¢
Slope of the tangent
line at input c
≤
(c  h,  f (c  h))
(c, f (c))
f (x)
Quick Example
For a function g with output 
and derivative 
, 
the change 
can be estimated as
g(10.7)  g(10)  2  0.7  1.4
g(10.7)  g(10)
g (10)  2
g(10)  5
It follows from the formula 
for approximating change that the
function value 
can be approximated by adding the approximate change to 
:
f (c  h)  f (c)  f (c)  h
f(c)
f (c  h)
f (c)  h  f (c  h)  f (c)
Approximating the Result of Change
When input changes by a small amount from c to 
, the output of f at 
is
approximately the value of f at c plus the approximate change in f.
Refer to Figure 4.4.

Linearization and Estimates
253
Linearization
The tangent line may be used for short-term extrapolation in cases when it makes sense to consid-
er that future behavior could follow the rate of change rather than the behavior of the function used
to model the data. The use of the tangent line to approximate the function is called linearization.
Linearization
Linearization is the process of using a line tangent to a function at a point to estimate
the value of that function at other points.
For a function f with input x, the linearization of f with respect to a specific input is

Figure 4.7 shows f graphed over

the cubic model shows full-time employment decreasing at an increasing
rate over the next two years. There is no evidence to support this type of
decrease.

where x is the number of years since 1980. See Figure 4.9. The graph in Figure 4.9 shows the pop-
ulation reaching a peak sometime near the beginning of 1984. This peak is referred to as a rela-
tive maximum because it is an output value to which the population rises and after which it
declines. Similarly, near the beginning of 1989, the population reaches a relative minimum. The
population decreases during a period of time immediately before this relative minimum and then
increases during a period immediately following this relative minimum.

Relative Extrema
A function f has a relative maximum at input c if the output 
is
greater than any other output in some interval around c. Likewise, a
function f has a relative minimum at input c if the output 
is less
than any other output in some interval around c.

Critical Points
A critical point of a continuous function f is a point (c, f (c)) at which
f is not differentiable or the derivative of f is zero:
The input value c of a critical point (c, f (c)) is referred to as a critical
input (or number).
f (c)  0
Figure 4.10 shows two graphs. The upper graph shows the function p with
tangent lines drawn at the maximum and minimum points. At these points,
the tangent line is horizontal and the slope of the graph is 0. The lower graph
of Figure 4.10 shows the rate-of-change function 
. Horizontal tangent lines
on the graph of p correspond to the points at which the rate-of-change graph
crosses the horizontal axis.

Relative Values and Relative Extreme Points
For a function f with a relative maximum (or minimum) value at c,
• the output 
is referred to as a relative maximum (or minimum)
value. Relative maxima and relative minima are also called relative
extremes (extrema, or extreme values).
• the point 
is referred to as a relative maximum (or mini-
mum) point or a relative extreme point. 
(c, f (c))
f (c)
Quick Example
The function 
has slope function 
. 
To determine where the rate of change of f is zero, solve 
:
The function 
has a critical point at (2.5, 7.5).
f (x)  0.4x2  2x  10
x  2.5
0.8x  2  0
f (x)  0
f (x)  0.8x  2
f (x)  0.4x2  2x  10
Solving 
may result in one or more critical points. However, the existence of a crit-
ical point does not guarantee the existence of a relative extreme. For a critical point (c, f(c)) to be
a relative extreme point, the slope graph of f must cross the input axis at c.
f (x)  0
Points Where Slopes Are Zero
For many functions, extreme points occur at inputs where the derivative of the function is zero.
These points are known as critical points.

where x is the number of years since 1980, data from 
.
b. Setting 
equal to zero and solving for x results in two 
critical inputs:
H I N T  4 . 1
c. The critical points are classified as a maximum at 3.14 and a 
minimum at 8.12 using Figure 4.14. The population was at a 
relative maximum in early 1984 at approximately 
thousand people. The 
population was at a relative minimum of approximately 
thousand people in early 1989.

Conditions When Relative Extrema Might Not Exist
Derivatives can be used to locate relative maxima and minima. If f has an extreme value at c and if
f is differentiable at c, then 
. However, if 
, there is not necessarily a relative
extreme point at 
. This is illustrated in Figure 4.14 through Figure 4.17.
In Figure 4.14 and Figure 4.15, 
and a relative extreme occurs on f at input value c.

asleep around 2:37 A.M. At that time, 96.4% of people (aged 15 and older) in the United
States are sleeping.

b. Graph the function and its derivative. On each graph, mark the point that corresponds to the
critical input found in part a.
c. Interpret the point marked on the graph of s in part b.
Solution
a. The graph is a parabola so there is one relative extreme that occur where the derivative is zero.
The critical input value is found by setting the derivative 
equal to
zero and solving for t.
Solving 
gives

The First Derivative Test for Relative Extrema
Suppose c is a critical input of a continuous function f.
• If 
changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a relative maximum at c.
• If 
changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a relative minimum at c.
• If 
does not change sign (from negative to positive or from positive to negative) at c,
then f does not have a relative extrema at c.

Relating Derivative Intercepts to Relative Extrema
Cable Revenue
TW Cable Company actively promoted sales in a town that previously had no cable service. Once
TW Cable saturated the market, it introduced a new 50-channel system, raised rates, and began a
new sales campaign. As the company began to offer its expanded system, a different company, CC
Network, began offering satellite service with more channels than TW Cable and at a lower price.
Some of TW Cable Company’s weekly revenues is shown in Table 4.1.
Table 4.1
TW Cable Company Revenue
A model for TW Cable’s revenue for the 26 weeks after it began its sales campaign is
where x is the number of weeks since TW Cable began its new sales campaign.
Graphs of the model and its derivative are shown in Figure 4.25.
a. Locate the point at which TW Cable’s revenue peaked during this 26-week interval.
b. At what other point is 
? Explain what happens to TW Cable’s revenue
at this point.
Solution
a. The upper graph in Figure 4.25 shows a relative maximum occurring near 20
weeks. Solving the equation
gives two solutions, 
and 
.
At 20 weeks revenue peaked at 
. This may correspond to the time
just before CC Network’s sales began negatively affecting TW Cable.
b. The other point at which 
is (10, 70,000).
At 
, the line tangent to R is horizontal. This corresponds to a time
when TW Cable’s revenue leveled off before beginning to increase again.

Relative Extrema on Functions That Are Not 
Differentiable at a Point
Not all relative maxima and minima on a function occur where the derivative is zero. Consider the
function h and its rate-of-change function 
shown in Figure 4.23. The function h is represented
by the equation
The derivative

4.3
Absolute Extreme Points
267
Although the endpoints of an
interval can never be relative
extreme points, on closed inter-
vals, endpoints can be absolute
extreme points.
An interior point can be both
a relative and an absolute
extreme point.
Absolute Extrema
A function f has an absolute maximum at input c if the output 
is greater than
(or equal to) every other possible output. Likewise, a function f has an absolute
minimum at input c if the output 
is less than (or equal to) every other possible
output.
The output 
is referred to as the maximum (value) or the minimum (value) of f.  
f (c)
f (c)
f (c)
However, it is evident from the graph that between the beginning of 1981 and the end of 1993
there were periods over which the population was greater than 3703 thousand (the relative maxi-
mum) or less than 3679 thousand (the relative minimum). 
Absolute Extrema
When considering maxima and minima over a closed interval, it is important to consider not only
the relative extremes but also absolute extremes.    
Absolute Extrema over Closed Intervals
A function can have several relative maxima (or minima) in a given closed interval. For example,
the function f in Figure 4.45 shows two relative maxima and two relative minima on the interval
. The relative minimum at 
is also the absolute minimum, and the relative
maximum at 
is the absolute maximum.
When the function f is considered on a shorter interval, 
, as in Figure 4.29,
there is both a relative and an absolute maximum at the input 
, but on the wider inter-
val 
graphed in Figure 4.28, there is only a relative maximum at the input
.

An interval is said to be a closed
interval when it contains both
of its endpoints. It is notated
and is drawn with filled-
in dots at either end of the graph.

An absolute extreme can occur at more than one input value on the interval. In
Figure 4.30 
. An absolute extreme can occur at a relative extreme or at an
endpoint of a closed interval. The absolute maximum in Figure 4.30 occurs at a rela-
tive maximum point where 
and at the endpoint where 
.
In the trivial case of a constant function on a closed interval (see Figure 4.31), all
points in the interval are both absolute maxima and absolute minima.

Finding Absolute Extrema on a Closed Interval
To find the absolute maximum and minimum of a function f on a closed interval from a
to b,
Step 1: Find all relative extremes of f in the interval.
Step 2: Compare the relative extreme values in the interval with 
and 
, the
output values at the endpoints of the interval. The largest of these values is
the absolute maximum, and the smallest of these values is the absolute
minimum.

Solution
a. Yes, the point (5.61, 96.36) is the absolute maximum.
Because the graph is a concave-down parabola, the relative
maximum is also the absolute maximum.
b. There are only two candidates for absolute minimum—the
two endpoints. Comparing

In general, to determine whether an absolute maximum or minimum exists for a function over all
real number inputs, the end behavior as well as the output values of the function must be considered.
Finding Absolute Extrema without a Closed Interval
To find the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function f without a spec-
ified input interval,
Step 1: Find all relative extrema of f.
Step 2: Determine the end behavior of the function in both directions to consider a
complete view of the function. The absolute extrema either do not exist or are
among the relative extrema.

a. Locate the absolute minimum of p on the interval 
. The relative minimum point
is approximately 
.
b. Explain why p does not have an absolute maximum over 
even though there is a
relative maximum at approximately 
.
Solution
a. The possibilities for an absolute minimum value are the relative minimum value, 3679
thousand people, and the output value of the left endpoint, 
thousand people.
From the end of 1980 through most of 1994, the population of Kentucky was lowest at the
end of 1980. The absolute minimum value was 3661 thousand people.
b. The graph in Figure 4.35 shows that the function output values continue to increase as the inputs
approach 13 from the left. If 
were included in the interval, the absolute maximum point
would occur at the right endpoint. Because the interval does not include 
, the function
does not have an absolute maximum on the interval for which it is defined.

Inflection Points and Second Derivatives
A point at which a point a graph changes concavity is an inflection point. On
a graph of a differentiable function, the inflection point can also be thought
of as the point of greatest or least slope in a region around the inflection
point. This point is interpreted as the point of most rapid change or least rapid
change.
An Inflection Point
Consider the model for the population of Kentucky from 1980 through
1993:
where x is the number of years since 1980. Figure 4.37 shows a graph of the
function p, the rate-of-change function 
, and the second-derivative func-
tion 
.
The equation for the rate of change of p is:
The middle graph in Figure 4.37 is the function 
. It appears that 
has a relative minimum where p has an inflection point. In fact,
the input 
that gives the inflection point on p is the same value as
the input 
that gives the relative minimum on 
. This occurs at
.
The equation for the rate-of-change graph of 
(that is, the rate of
change of the rate of change of p) is denoted as 
. The equation for this sec-
ond rate of change function is:
The function 
is the bottom graph in Figure 4.37.
The derivative of 
is zero (that is, 
) where the relative min-
imum of 
exists. This occurs at 
. The population was declining
most rapidly in mid-1986 at a rate of approximately –7.2 thousand people
per year. At that time, the population was approximately 3691 thousand
people.

rapidly for those aged 46.7 years. The percentage of California residents aged 46.7 years who
were born in California was decreasing by 0.128 percentage points per year.
The Point of Diminishing Returns
In some applications, the inflection point can be regarded as the point of diminishing returns,
the point after which each additional unit of input results in a smaller gain in output; that is, out-
put still increases but at a decreasing rate. To qualify as a point of diminishing returns, the inflec-
tion point must appear on an increasing function that is concave down to the right of the inflec-
tion point.

c. Describe the difference between the direction of p and

d. Explain what happens to the student’s retention rate after the input found in part a.
Solution
a. The inflection point on the graph of p(the upper graph) corresponds to the
maximum point on the graph of 
(the middle graph) which then corresponds to
the point where the graph of 
(the lower graph) crosses the t-axis.
Using technology to estimate the maximum point on the first derivative graph gives
.
b. After approximately 1.84 hours of studying, a student retains 
percent of the material. At this time the percentage retained is increasing by
percentage points per hour.
c. To the right of the inflection point on the graph of p in Figure 4.41, the function p
continues to increase, whereas the rate-of-change function 
is decreasing.
d. After approximately 1 hour and 50 minutes, the rate at which the student is
retaining new material begins to diminish. Studying beyond this amount of time
will improve the student’s knowledge, but not as quickly.
Concavity and the Second Derivative
Because the derivative of a function is the slope of the graph of that function, a posi-
tive derivative indicates that the function output is increasing, and a negative deriva-
tive indicates that the function output is decreasing. The second derivative provides
similar information about where a function graph is concave up and where it is
concave down.
•
If the second derivative is positive for all input values on an interval, the first
derivative is increasing on that interval, and the original function graph is con-
cave up on the interval.

Inflection Points and Second Derivatives

•
If the second derivative is negative for all input values on an interval, the first derivative
is decreasing on that interval, and the original function is concave down on the interval.
•
If the second derivative changes from positive to negative or from negative to positive at
a point P on a continuous function f, then P is an inflection point.

Other Inflection Points
So far in this section, the functions discussed are continuous and differentiable with
continuous second derivatives. It is possible for inflection points to occur on a con-
tinuous function at an input where the first and/or the second derivatives do not exist
as long as the second derivative is positive on one side of that input and negative on
the other.

At a point of inflection on the graph of a function, the second derivative is either zero or
does not exist. If the second derivative graph is negative on one side of an input value
and positive on the other side of an input value, then an inflection point of the function
graph occurs at that input value.

Marginal Analysis
In economics, considering the additional (marginal) benefits derived from a particular decision
and comparing them with the additional (marginal) costs incurred is known as marginal analy-
sis. Rather than comparing the total benefits with the total costs for a decision, marginal analysis
compares the benefits derived from a unit change in input with the costs incurred by the same unit
change. For continuous functions, marginal analysis uses derivatives.
Introduction to Marginal Analysis
Consider the cost and revenue to an oil company from the production of crude oil at a certain
American oil field. The cost of producing q million barrels of oil can be modeled as
C(q)  0.24q3  5.1q2  40.72q  0.15 million dollars
and the revenue from the sale of q million barrels of oil can be modeled as
where 
. Graphs of these models are shown in Figure 4.52.
The profit, 
, from the production and sale of q million
barrels of crude oil is graphed in Figure 4.53.
Figure 4.54 shows the marginal cost (in dollars per barrel) and the mar-
ginal revenue (in dollars per barrel) for the production (and sale) of the qth
barrel of crude oil. The profit from the production and sale of crude oil is
maximized where the marginal cost graph intersects the marginal revenue
graph; that is, when approximately 13.96 million barrels of crude oil are pro-
duced and sold.

Marginal Cost and Marginal Revenue
In economics, marginal cost is defined as the cost incurred to produce one additional
unit, and marginal revenue is defined as the revenue realized from the sale of one addi-
tional unit.
For continuous cost and revenue functions C and R with respect to q units produced
(and sold),
gives the marginal cost of producing the 
unit.
gives the marginal revenue from selling the 
unit.

For a continuous cost function C,
the marginal cost C’ is interpreted
as the increase in cost associated
with a one-unit increase in pro-
duction even if the input variable
measures production in thousand
units or million units.
Quick Example

thousand ovens with a
total production cost of

Marginals and Maximization
Comparing the profit for oil production shown previously in Figure 4.53 with the marginal cost
and revenue shown in Figure 4.54 illustrates the following rule:
Profit Maximization Rule
Profit is maximized when marginal cost is equal to marginal revenue.
This rule applies when costs and revenues for a quantity can be considered to occur at the same time.
Proper analysis must be made because an equality of marginal costs and marginal revenues may, under
some circumstances, create a minimum profit.
The profit maximization rule indicates that profit is at a relative optimal point where the
derivative of profit is zero: 
. It is possible for the solution of
to result in a relative minimum profit instead of a relative maximum profit.
Graphing the profit function can help avoid picking the wrong optimal point.

Cookie Sales
Each council of Girl Scouts has costs associated with acquiring and selling cookies during their
annual cookie campaign. The council sets the price per box sold in their region. During a recent
campaign, one council set the sales price for their region at $4.00 per box. The total cost to the
council associated with the campaign can be modeled as

their nationwide cookie campaign.
In 2009, Girl Scout councils
across the United States sold
more than 200 million boxes of

c. According to the profit maximization rule, profit is maximized at an input level for which
marginal cost equals marginal revenue 
. Solving
yields

Marginal Product
The production function Q gives the quantity of output that can be produced by a given amount
of input. Possible production factors (input quantities) are labor, capital expenditure, natural
resources, state of technology, and so on. Only one of these production factors is allowed to vary
while all other input quantities are held constant. Marginal product refers the change in the pro-
duction level resulting from one additional unit of the variable production factor.

resented by Q automobiles where l associates is the size of the labor force.  If
automobiles, the marginal product with respect to labor is

Discrete Marginals
When marginal cost is calculated without using calculus, it is calculated as the change between two consec-
utive integer input values:
This discrete calculation for marginal cost can be represented graphically as the slope of a secant line. See
Figure 4.57. When the units of measure of q are in hundreds, thousands, millions, and so on, the discrete
calculation of marginal cost measures the change in output associated with a one hundred (or one thou-
sand, or one million) unit change in production.
The calculation of marginal cost for continuous functions can be represented graphically as the slope of a
tangent line at q as in Figure 4.58 and can be used to measure change when production increases are small:

Optimization of Constructed Functions 
Some models can be constructed directly from verbal descriptions instead of from tables of data.
As long as the mathematical functions constructed are continuous, the optimization techniques
discussed in Section 4.3 through Section 4.5 still hold.
Optimization of a Function Given Verbally
In 2009, airlines had a 45-inch restriction on the maximum linear measurement of carry-on lug-
gage. Passengers concerned with keeping their travel costs down seek to maximize the capacity of
their carry-on bag.
Verbal Representation: Carry-on luggage is size restricted on all major airlines. The maxi-
mum allowable size for carry-on luggage at one of the airlines is 10 inches deep with a linear mea-
surement 
of 45 inches.
The Question: What are the optimal measurements to maximize capacity?
The capacity of a piece of carry-on luggage is the volume V of a rectangular prism with
length l, width w, and height h. A sketch of the particular rectangular prism described is shown in
Figure 4.59.

The Solution: When length and width are 17.5 inches and height is 10 inches, the piece of

A Strategy
After a continuous model is constructed, locating its optimal point is simply a matter of calculus.
However, writing the model takes some planning. The following strategy can be used for solving

Problem-Solving Strategy for Optimization
Step 1: Identify the quantity to be optimized (the output) and the quantities on which
the output quantity depends (the input).
Step 2: Sketch and label a diagram of the situation described.
Step 3: Construct a model with a single input variable.
Step 4: Locate the optimal point for the model.
Variables in Verbal Descriptions (Step 1)
To construct a model from a verbal description, identify the quantity to be maximized or minimized
(the output variable) and the quantity or quantities on which the output quantity depends (the input
variable or variables). This information is often found in the final sentence of the problem statement.

In the luggage illustration, the output quantity and the input quantities can be determined
from the question:
“What are the optimal measurements to maximize capacity?”
The output quantity is the quantity to be maximized: capacity.
The input quantities are the quantities that determine the capacity: length, width, and height.
(These quantities are interdependent and can be simplified to just one quantity: length.)
Quick Example
In the statement,
“Find the order size that will minimize cost,”
the output and input quantities are
Output quantity to be minimized: cost
Input quantity: order size
Quick Example
In the question,
“For what size dose is the sensitivity to the drug greatest?”
the output and input quantities are
Output quantity to be maximized: sensitivity
Input quantity: dosage
Quick Example
In the question,
“What is the most economical way to lay the pipe?”
the output quantity to be minimized is cost.
Not enough information is given in this sentence to discern the input quantities, 
but we can conclude that the input is probably some measure of distance related 
to how the pipe is laid.
Sketches Give Insight (Step 2)
Sketch a diagram if the problem is geometric in nature—that is, if the problem involves con-
structing containers, laying cable or wire, building enclosures, or the like. The diagram does
not have to be elaborate. However, it should be labeled with appropriate variables represent-
ing distances or sizes. At least one of the variables should represent the input quantity in the
problem.
For example, Figure 4.61 shows a diagram of the following problem:
A rancher removed 200 feet of wire fencing from a field on his ranch. He wants to reuse
the fencing to create a rectangular corral into which he will build a 6-foot-wide wooden
gate. What dimensions will result in a corral with the greatest possible area? What is the
greatest area?
Figure 4.61 illustrates all of the given information. The quantities have been labeled. Variables
and other information about the quantities have also been included. These pieces of information
will be useful in constructing a model.
Gate =
6 feet
length = l feet
width = w feet
Figure 4.61
In Figure 4.92, it does not matter
on which side (length or width) of
the corral the gate is placed.

Optimization of Constructed Functions

Construction of the Model (Step 3)
Constructing the model is the most important step in optimizing problems that are given in ver-
bal form. This third step can be broken down into three phases:
•
Identify the connections between the output variable and the input quantities. Express the
output quantity as a function of the input quantities. (It may be necessary to look up for-
mulas in a reference source.)
For example, the corral illustration asks to maximize the area of a rectangular corral. The
formula for area is
where l is the length of the rectangle and w is its width.
•
Identify the connections among the input variables. If there is more than one input vari-
able, decide which single variable to use as the input for the model. All other input vari-
ables must be expressed as functions of this one input variable. This step may require the
use of secondary equations relating the input variables in the equation.
In the corral illustration, information about the perimeter is given: 200 feet of fence and
a 6-foot gate. See Figure 4.93. The formula for perimeter is 
. These pieces
can be put together to form the equation 
feet.
•
Rewrite the equation as a function of only one variable if it is not already in this form.
Consider the input interval.
The model for the corral must be written in terms of only one variable, say w. To express l in terms
of w, it is necessary to solve the perimeter equation 
for l: 
.
Substituting this into the area equation gives 
. 
The width must be between 0 feet (if the gate is on the long side) and 97 feet (in which
case, the gate would be at one end of the corral with 6 feet of fencing needed to span the
other end).
A model for the area of a rectangular corral with 200 feet of fencing and a 6-foot gate is
H I N T  4 . 7
where w is the width of one end of the corral, 
.
Optimization (Step 4)
After a model with a single input variable is formed, the process of optimization is no different
from that presented in Section 4.3 and Section 4.4. Example 1 completes the optimization of the
area of the corral illustration used in the earlier discussion.

Solution
a. Part of this solution was done earlier during the narrative of this section but is outlined here
for convenience.
Output variable to maximize: area of rectangular corral (call it A)
Input variables: length l and width w of the corral
A sketch of the corral is shown in Figure 4.62.
The relative dimensions of a
sketch may not match the final
answer.
Gate =
6 feet
length = l feet
width = w feet
Perimeter = 2l + 2w
2l + 2w = 206
Figure 4.62
Using the perimeter equation 
to connect the two input variables, the variable
l can be written in terms of the variable w,
H I N T  4 . 8
and can be substituted into the area equation to form the model.
The Model: The area of a rectangular corral with 200 feet of fencing and a 6-foot gate is
given by
where w is the width of one end of the corral, 
.
Figure 4.63 shows a graph of the area model.
The absolute maximum occurs at the relative maximum and can be found by solving for the
zero of the derivative function:
which yields
To completely answer the question asked in part a, both dimensions (length as well as
width) must be found. Using the equation for l in terms of w, 
, and
substituting the known solution 
yields 
.
A corral of length 51.5 feet and width 51.5 feet will have the greatest area.
b. The maximum area is 
square feet.

Optimizing in a Geometric Setting
Popcorn Tins
In an effort to be environmentally responsible, a confectionery company is rethinking the dimen-
sions of the tins in which it packages popcorn. Each cylindrical tin is to hold 3.5 gallons. The bot-
tom and lid are both circular, but the lid must have an additional 
inches around it to form a
lip. (Consider the amount of metal needed to create a seam on the side and to join the side to the
bottom to be negligible.) What are the dimensions of a tin that meets these specifications but uses
the least amount of metal possible?
Solution
Output variable to be minimized: amount of metal, s Input variables: height of the tin, h, and
radius of the bottom of the tin, r. See Figure 4.64.

Figure 4.64
An alternate approach would be
to use the diameter, instead of the
radius, of the top or bottom as
the other variable.
The amount of metal used to construct the tin is measured by calculating the combined surface
area of the side, top, and bottom. The total surface area is determined by the equation
•
The area of the bottom circle is 
.
•
The radius of the top circle is 
, so the area of the top is 
.
•
The area of the side uses both r and h as input variables: 
.
We need to rewrite the formula for the area of the side in terms of radius alone. Using the equa-
tion 
for the volume of a cylinder, and the requirement for the volume of the container
to be 3.5 gallons (808.5 cubic inches), gives the equation
H I N T  4 . 9

Cruise Revenue
A travel agency offers spring-break cruise packages. The agency advertises a cruise to Cancun, Mexico,
for $1200 per person. To promote the cruise among student organizations on campus, the agency
offers a discount for student groups selling the cruise to over 50 of their members. The price per stu-
dent will be discounted by $10 for each student in excess of 50. For example, if an organization had
55 members go on the cruise, each of those 55 students would pay 
.
a. What size group will produce the largest revenue for the travel agency, and what is the largest
possible revenue?
b. If the travel agent limits each organization to 75 tickets, what is the agent’s maximum revenue
for each organization?
c. Should the travel agent set a limit on the number of students per organization?
Solution
a. Output variable to be maximized: travel agency’s revenue from student group
Input variable: size of the group
In this example, revenue is the number of students traveling on the cruise multiplied by the
price each student pays:
•
The factor affecting price is the number of students in excess of 50. If s is the number of
students in excess of 50, the total number of students is 
.
•
The price is $1200 minus $10 for each student in excess of 50. The price per student is
dollars.
Multiplying these two pieces gives a model for revenue:
The Model: The travel agency’s revenue from the student group can be modeled as
H I N T  4 . 1 3
where there are 
on the cruise, 
.
The revenue equation is a concave-down parabola as shown in Figure 4.67.

The optimal solution is a relative maximum. Set the derivative of the revenue function equal
to zero

c. When 85 students bought cruise tickets, the travel agent’s revenue was a maximum. If more
than 85 students bought tickets, the agent’s revenue would actually decline because of the
lower price. Therefore, it would make sense for the agent to limit the number of students per
organization to 85.

Each frame is constructed from a wire of length 9 feet that is cut
into six pieces. The vertical edges of the frame consist of four of
the pieces of wire and are each 12 inches long. One of the
remaining pieces is bent into a square to form the base of the

Cable Line
A cable company needs to run a cable line
from its main line ending at point P to point H at the cor-

The side walls of the run are to be cinder block, which costs
$0.50 per square foot. The outer wall is to be chain link, which
costs $2.75 per square foot. Local regulations require the walls
and fence to be at least 7 feet high and the area to measure no
fewer than 120 square feet.

For Activities 15 and 16, Booth Design
A sales representa-
tive needs to design a display booth for trade shows. Because
trade show organizers typically charge for floor space at their
shows, the booth is to be limited to 300 square feet. The booth
is to be 6 feet tall and three-sided, with the back of the booth
made of display board and the two sides of the booth made of
gathered fabric. The display board for the back of the booth
costs $30 per square foot. The fabric costs $2 per square foot
and needs to be twice the length of the side to allow for
gathering.
15.
Calculate the minimum cost of constructing a booth
according to these specifications. What should be the
dimensions of the booth?
16.
To accommodate the company’s display, the back of the
booth must be at least 15 feet wide. Does this restriction
change the dimensions necessary to minimize cost? What
are the optimal dimensions now?

Cafeteria Supply Costs
During one calendar year, a year-
round elementary school cafeteria uses 42,000 Styrofoam
plates and packets, each containing a fork, spoon, and nap-
kin. The smallest amount the cafeteria can order from the
supplier is one case containing 1000 plates and packets. Each
order costs $12, and the cost to store a case for the whole
year is approximately $4. To calculate the optimal order size
that will minimize costs, the cafeteria manager must balance
the ordering costs incurred when many small orders are
placed with the storage costs incurred when many cases are
ordered at once. Use x to represent the number of cases
ordered at a time.
a. Write equations for the number of times the manager
will need to order during one calendar year and for the
annual cost.
b. Assume that the average number of cases stored
throughout the year is half the number of cases in
each order. Write an equation for the total storage
cost for 1 year.
c. Write a model for the combined ordering and storage
costs for 1 year.

easement to run lines underground in the field. It is also
more costly for the company to run lines underground
than to run them on poles. The total cost to run the
lines underground across the field is $52 per foot. The
cable company has the choice of running the line along
the roads (100 feet north and 125 feet west) or cutting

Duplex Rent
A set of 24 duplexes (48 units) was sold to
a new owner. The previous owner charged $700 per
month rent and had a 100% occupancy rate. The new
owner, aware that this rental amount was well below other
rental prices in the area, immediately raised the rent to
$750. Over the next 6 months, an average of 47 units were
occupied. The owner raised the rent to $800 and found
that 2 of the units were unoccupied during the next
6 months.
a. What was the monthly rental income
i. for the previous owner?
ii. after the first rent increase?
iii. after the second rent increase?
b. Construct an equation for the monthly rental income as
a function of the number of $50 increases in the rent.
c. If the occupancy rate continues to decrease as the rent
increases in the same manner as it did for the first two
increases, what rent amount will maximize the owner’s
rental income from these duplexes? How much will
the owner collect in rent each month at this rental
amount?
d. What other considerations besides rental income
should the owner take into account when determining
an optimal rental amount?

Production Changeover Costs
A tin-container manu-
facturing company uses the same machine to produce
different items such as popcorn tins and 30-gallon stor-
age drums. The machine is set up to produce a quantity
of one item and then is reconfigured to produce a quan-
tity of another item. The plant produces a run and then
ships the tins out at a constant rate so that the warehouse
is empty for storing the next run. Assume that the num-
ber of tins stored on average during 1 year is half of the
number of tins produced in each run. A plant manager
must take into account the cost to reset the machine and
the cost to store inventory. Although it might otherwise
make sense to produce an entire year’s inventory of pop-
corn tins at once, the cost of storing all the tins over a
year’s time would be prohibitive.
Suppose the company needs to produce 1.7 million
popcorn tins over the course of a year. The cost to set up
the machine for production is $1300, and the cost to store
one tin for a year is approximately $1.
a. What size production run will minimize setup and stor-
age costs?
b. How many runs are needed during one year, and how
often will the plant manager need to schedule a run of
popcorn tins?

Sorority Trip
A sorority plans a bus trip to the Great Mall
of America during Thanksgiving break. The bus they charter
seats 44 and charges a flat rate of $350 plus $35 per person.
However, for every empty seat, the charge per person is
increased by $2. There is a minimum of 10 passengers. The
sorority leadership decides that each person going on the trip
will pay $35. The sorority itself will pay the flat rate and the
additional amount above $35 per person.
a. Construct a model for the revenue made by the bus
company as a function of the number of passengers.
b. Construct a model for the amount the sorority pays as
a function of the number of passengers.
c. For what number of passengers will the bus company’s
revenue be greatest? For what number of passengers will
the bus company’s revenue be least?
d. For what number of passengers will the amount the
sorority pays be greatest? For what number of passen-
gers will the amount the sorority pays be least?

Necklace Sales
During the summer, an art student
makes and sells necklaces at the beach. Last summer she
sold the necklaces for $10 each and her sales averaged 20
necklaces per day. When she increased the price by $1, she
found that she lost 2 sales per day. Assume that this pat-
tern would continue if she kept increasing the price; that
is, for every dollar she raised the price, she would sell 2
fewer necklaces per day.
a. Write a model for the student’s daily revenue from the
sale of x necklaces.
b. The material used in each necklace costs $6. Write the
student’s daily cost in terms x.
c. What price will maximize the student’s profit from sales
at the beach? What will be the profit be if this price is
charged?

Bottling Company
A bottling company bottles 20,000
cases of lime soda each year. The cost to set up the machine
for a production run is $1400, and the cost to store a case
for one year is $18.
a. If x is the number of cases in a production run, write an
expression representing the number of production runs
necessary to produce 20,000 cases and an expression for
the total setup cost.
b. Assume that the average number of cases stored
throughout the year is half the number of cases in a pro-
duction run. Write an expression for the total storage
cost for one year in terms of the number of cases in each
production run.

Product Development
A software developer is planning
the launch of a new program. The current version of the
program could be sold for $100. Delaying the release will
allow the developers to package add-ons with the program
that will increase the program’s utility and, consequently,
its selling price by $2 for each day of delay. On the other
hand, if they delay the release, they will lose market share
to their competitors. The company could sell 400,000
copies now but for each day they delay release, they will sell
2,300 fewer copies.
a. If t is the number of days the company delays the
release, write a model for P, the price charged for the
product.
b. If t is the number of days the company will delay the
release, write a model for Q, the number of copies they
will sell.
c. If t is the number of days the company will delay the
release, write a model for R, the revenue generated from
the sale of the product.
d. How many days should the company delay the release
to maximize revenue? What is the maximum possible
revenue?

Auto Sales
An auto dealer offers an additional discount
to fleet buyers who purchase one or more new cars. To
encourage sales, the dealer reduces the price of each car by
a percentage equal to the total number of cars purchased.
For example, a fleet buyer purchasing 12 cars will receive a
12% discount.
a. Assuming that the pre-incentive price of a car is
$14,400, write a model for the after-incentive price of
each car as a function of the number of cars
purchased.
b. Write a model for the auto dealer’s revenue as a function
of the number of cars purchased by the fleet buyer.
c. How many cars should the dealer sell to maximize rev-
enue? What is the maximum possible revenue?

Game Sales
The owner of a toy store expects to sell 500
popular handheld game units in the year following its
release. It costs $6 to store one handheld game unit for one
year. The cost of reordering is a fixed $20 plus $4 for each
game unit ordered. To minimize costs, the shop manager
must balance the ordering costs incurred when many small
orders are placed with the storage costs incurred when
many units are ordered at once. Assume that all orders
placed will contain the same number of handheld game
units. Use x to represent the number of handheld game
units in each order.
a. Write an expression for
i. The cost for one order of x units.
ii. The number of times the manager will have to
order x units during the year.
iii. The total ordering costs for one year.

units stored throughout the year is half the number of
handheld game units in each order. What is the total
storage cost for one year?
c. Write a model for the combined ordering and storage
costs for one year, using x as the number of handheld
game units in each order.

Floppy Diskettes (Historic)
A standard 3.5-inch com-
puter diskette stores data on a circular sheet of Mylar that
is 3.36 inches in diameter. See the figure below.
track is close to the center, more tracks will fit on
the disk, but each track will contain a relatively small
number of bytes. If the innermost track is near the edge
of the disk, fewer tracks will fit on the disk, but each
track will contain more bytes. For a standard double-
sided, high-density, 3.5-inch disk, there are 135 tracks
per inch between the innermost track and the edge of the
disk and approximately 1400 bytes per inch of track.
This type of disk holds 1,440,000 bytes of information
when formatted.
a. For the left disk in the accompanying figure, calculate
the following quantities. The answers to parts ii and iii
must be positive integers, and the rounded values
should be used in the remaining calculations.
i. Distance in inches around the innermost track
ii. Number of bytes in the innermost track
iii. Total number of tracks
iv. Total number of bytes on one side of the disk
v. Total number of bytes on both sides of the disk
b. Calculate the quantities in part a for the right disk
shown in the figure.
c. Repeat part a for a disk whose innermost track begins
r inches from the center of the disk. Use the opti-
mization techniques presented in this chapter to
calculate the optimal distance the innermost track
should be from the center of the disk to maximize the
number of bytes stored on the disk. What is the
corresponding number of bytes stored? How does this
number compare to the total number of bytes stored
by a standard double-sided, high-density, 3.5-inch
diskette?

Many situations in the world can be modeled mathematically. Calculus can be used to analyze
changes that have taken place or may take place in the future in any relation modeled using a con-
tinuous function. The rate of change of the output variable of a continuous function is often
affected by a change in the input variable. Sometimes the rates of change of input and output vari-
ables interact with respect to a third variable.

Related-Rates Equations
The related-rates equations in this book can be formed by differentiating both sides of an equa-
tion with respect to t. This differentiation always requires use of the Chain Rule for derivatives and
sometimes uses the Product Rule.
For example, when 
, an equation relating 
and 
is found as follows:
•
Treat p and x as functions of t.
•
Differentiate the left side p with respect to t.
Because p is a function of t, its derivative is simply 
.
•
Differentiating the right side 
with respect to t is a little more involved.
The variable x is a function of t, so differentiating 
with respect to t involves
the Chain Rule, with 
as the outside function and x as the inside function:

Interconnected Change
An equation relating the volume V of a spherical balloon to its radius r is
When the balloon is inflated (over time), its volume increases and its radius increases. Even
though V and r depend on the amount of time since the balloon began to be inflated, no time vari-
able appears in the volume equation.
An equation relating 
, the rate of change of the balloon’s volume with respect to time, and
,
the rate of change of its radius with respect to time, is
This equation shows how the rates of change of the volume and the radius of a sphere with
respect to time are interconnected. See Figure 4.69. The equation can be used to answer questions
about those rates. Such an equation is referred to as a related-rates equation.
In such applications, both volume V and radius r are referred to as dependent variables
because changes in their value depend on changes in another variable, t, referred to as the
independent variable.

Hydrologists who study groundwater contamination are sometimes able to model the area of
a plume as a function of the distance away from the source that the chemical has traveled by advec-
tion. That is, they develop an equation showing the interconnection between A, the area of the
plume, and r, the distance from the source that the chemical has spread because of the flow of the
groundwater.
If A is a function of r, then the rate of change, , describes how quickly the area of the plume
is increasing as the chemical travels farther from the source. However, of greater interest is the rate
of change of A with respect to time, , and how it is related to the rate of change of r with respect
to time, . Example 1 examines this hydrogeological application.

A Strategy for Solving Related Rates
Related-rates problems can become involved, so a strategy for solving them can be useful.
Strategy for Solving Related-Rates Problems
Step 1: Identify the variables: one independent variable (the “with respect to” variable)
and all dependent variables.
Step 2: Write an equation relating the dependent variables. The independent variable
may or may not appear in the equation. (The equation may appear in the
problem statement, it may be described verbally, or you may have to find it in
an alternate resource.)
Step 3: Differentiate both sides of the equation in Step 2 with respect to the indepen-
dent variable to produce a related-rates equation.
Step 4: Solve for the unknown rate by substituting the known quantities and rates into
the related-rates equation.
Today’s news often contains stories of environmental pollution in one form or another. One seri-
ous form of pollution is groundwater contamination. If a hazardous chemical is introduced into
the ground, it can contaminate the groundwater and make the water source unusable. The conta-
minant will be carried downstream via the flow of the groundwater. This movement of contami-
nant as a consequence of the flow of the groundwater is known as advection. As a result of diffu-
sion, the chemical will also spread out perpendicularly to the direction of flow. The region that the
contamination covers is known as a chemical plume. See Figure 4.70.

Applying Related Rates to Models
Groundwater Plume
In a certain part of Michigan, a hazardous chemical leaked from an underground storage facility.
Because of the terrain surrounding the storage facility, the groundwater was flowing almost due
south at a rate of approximately 2 feet per day. Hydrologists studying this plume drilled wells to
sample the groundwater in the area and determine the extent of the plume. They found that the
shape of the plume was fairly easy to predict and that the area of the plume could be modeled as
when the chemical had spread r feet south of the storage facility.
a. How quickly was the area of the plume growing when the chemical had traveled 3 miles
south of the storage facility?
b. How much area had the plume covered when the chemical had spread 3 miles south?
Solution
a. The independent variable is time measured in days since the leak began. Represent it as t.
The dependent variables are A, area of the plume; and r, the rate of flow of groundwater.
The known rate is 
feet per day. The rate to evaluate is 
.
A model that shows the relation between A and r is given as:
Differentiating the model equation with respect to t will produce an equation showing the
relation between the rates 
and 
.
H I N T  4 . 2 1
Substitute the known values 
feet (3 miles) and 
per day and solve
for 
:
When the chemical has spread 3 miles south, the plume is growing at a rate of 60,855 square
feet per day.
b. The area of the plume is found using the original model and substituting 
feet.
When the contamination has spread 3 miles south, the total contaminated area is
approximately 8.6 square miles.

Applying Related Rates, Given a Verbal Description
Baseball
A baseball diamond is a square with each side measuring 90 feet. A baseball team is participating
in a publicity photo session, and a photographer at second base wants to photograph runners when
they are halfway to first base. Suppose that the average speed at which a baseball player runs from
home plate to first base is 20 feet per second. The photographer needs to set the shutter speed in
terms of how fast the distance between the runner and the camera is changing. At what rate is the
distance between the runner and second base changing when the runner is halfway to first base?
Solution
The three variables involved in this problem are time, the distance between the runner and first
base, and the distance between the runner and the photographer at second base. Because speed is
the rate of change of distance with respect to time, the independent variable is time, and the two
distances are the dependent variables.
An equation that relates the distance f between the runner and first base and the distance s
between the runner and the photographer at second base is needed. A diagram illustrates the rela-
tionship between these distances. See Figure 4.71.
Consider the right triangle formed by the runner, first base, and second base. Using the
Pythagorean Theorem, the relationship between f and s in Figure 4.108 is

CHAPTER SUMMARY
This chapter deals with analyzing change and includes the fol-
lowing topics: approximating change, optimization, inflection
points, and related rates.
Approximating Change
One of the most useful approximations of change in a function is
to use the behavior of a tangent line to approximate the behavior
of the function. On a continuous function, the principle of local
linearity states that tangent-line approximations are quite accurate
over small intervals. When h represents a small change in input,
the output 
can be estimated as 
.
Optimization
Optimization refers to the process of locating relative and/or
absolute extreme points. A relative maximum is a point to which
the graph rises and after which the graph falls. Similarly, a rela-
tive minimum is a point to which the graph falls and after which
the graph rises. The absolute maximum point and the absolute
minimum point are points where the output value is the highest
f (x)  f  (x)  h
f (x  h)
or lowest. The absolute extreme points may coincide with a rela-
tive maximum or minimum, or they may occur at the endpoints
of a given interval.
Inflection Points
Inflection points are points where the concavity of the graph
changes. An inflection point occurs where the function has the
most rapid change or the least rapid change in a region around
the point. Inflection points can be found where the graph of the
second derivative of a function either crosses the horizontal axis
or the second derivative fails to exist. The sign of the second
derivative of a function can be used to determine the concavity of
the function.
Related Rates
When the changes in one or more variables (called dependent
variables) depend on a third variable (called the independent vari-
able), a related-rates equation can be developed to show how the
rates of change of these variables are interconnected.

Oil production and refining is a global industry.  Rates of change of many facets of oil
production have been measured and studied. There have been geological studies pre-
dicting the rates of change of world-wide oil reserves, industrial studies predicting the
rates of change of the production of specific oil fields, and economic studies of the rates
of change involved in turning crude oil into marketable products.  Models of these rates
of change can be used to answer questions such as
•
What is the predicted oil production from 1900 through 2100? (Section 5.2, Activity 12)
•
For what production levels will the marginal cost of production equal the average
cost of production? (Section 5.8, Example 3)
•
What is the average annual yield from a specific oil well during the first 10 years
of production? (Section 8.5, Activity 8)

An Introduction to Results of Change
319
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 focus on the integral, the second main concept in calculus. The topic of
integration is introduced as accumulated change in a quantity and calculated using limits. The
integral is presented graphically as the area of a region between a graph of a function and the
horizontal axis.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus shows the connection between derivatives and inte-
grals and introduces the idea of an antiderivative.
5.1
An Introduction to Results of Change
The first four chapters of this book discussed analyzing change by measuring the rate of change at
a point. Change can also be measured as it accumulates over an interval.  The results of change
occurring over an interval can be represented graphically as a region between a graph of a function
and the input axis. 
Accumulated Distance
A common example of accumulated change is distance as an accumulation of velocity over time.
Suppose a motorist is driving on Interstate 10 west from Phoenix. At mile marker 142, he is trav-
eling at 65 mph. He maintains this constant speed for 15 minutes and then gradually accelerate
over the next 15 minutes until he reaches a speed of 75 mph, which he maintains until he nears

the California border one hour and 24 minutes later. Figure 5.1 shows a
graph of his speed, v, as a function of time, t, in hours after passing mile
marker 142.
When speed is constant, distance can be represented as a rectangular
region between the velocity graph and the horizontal axis and calculated
by multiplying speed times time (height times width).

The distance traveled during the first 15 minutes is 16.25 miles.
•
The distance traveled during the
last 84 minutes is 105 miles.
•
The trapezoidal region between

the distance traveled during the
second 15 minutes: 17.5 miles.
The total distance traveled is given
by the area of the region between the
velocity graph and the horizontal axis and is calculated by summing the
three component areas:
Over the 1.9 hours of driving, the distance traveled is 138.75 miles.

By signed area, we mean that
the area of the region above the
x-axis is positive and that the area
below the x-axis is shown with a
negative sign.
Accumulated Change
If a rate-of-change function 
of a quantity is continuous over an interval 
, the
accumulated change in the quantity between input values of a and b is the area (or signed
area) of the region between the graph of the rate-of-change function 
and the horizontal
axis, provided the graph of 
does not cross the horizontal axis between a and b.

If the rate-of-change graph is negative, then the accumulated change will be negative even
though the area of the region is positive (because area is always positive by definition).

c. Calculate the change in the volume of water in the tank during the first
4 minutes that the water was being drained.
Solution
a. The height corresponds to the output units, which are gallons per minute. The
width is elapsed time (in minutes). In the calculation of area, the height and
width are multiplied, giving area in gallons.
b. The rate of change of volume after 4 minutes is 
. The negative sign
indicates that the volume of water is decreasing at that time.
c. The change in the volume of the water is
calculated as the area of the region between the
time axis and the rate graph. This region is the
triangle shaded in Figure 5.3.
The signed area of the region is 16 gallons.
During the first 4 minutes that the tank was
being drained, the volume of water in the tank
decreased by 16 gallons.
If the rate-of-change graph changes sign somewhere in the input interval, the
accumulated change over the entire interval can be obtained by summing the signed
areas of the different geometric regions formed.

Accumulating Change Involving Increase and Decrease
Cleveland Population (Historic)
The rate of change of the population of Cleveland, Ohio, from the end of 1900
to the end of 1980 can be modeled as
thousand people per year
where x is the number of years since the end of 1900. Figure 5.4 shows a graph of
this rate-of-change function. (Source: Based on data from Statistical Abstract, 1998)
a. What are the units on height, width, and area of a region between the time
axis and the rate-of-change graph?
b. Calculate the area between the positive portion of the rate-of-change graph
and the x-axis. Write a sentence of interpretation.
c. Calculate the change in the population of Cleveland between 
and
. Write a sentence of interpretation.
d. What was the overall change in the population of Cleveland between the
end of 1900 and the end of 1980? 
Solution
a. The height of the region corresponds to an interval of output of the function,
so is measured in thousand people per year. The width of a region corresponds
to an interval of input and so represents time (in years). During the calculation
of area, the height and width are multiplied, so the units of measure for area are
thousand people.
b. The area of the triangular region under the positive portion of the graph of
is calculated as
See Figure 5.5. Between the end of 1900 and mid-1945, the population of
Cleveland increased by approximately 554,025 people.
c. The change in the population of Cleveland between 
and 
is
given by the signed area of the region between the graph of 
and the x-axis
as shown in Figure 5.6. The signed area of this triangular region is
Between mid-1945 and 1980, the population of Cleveland decreased by
approximately 353.2 thousand people.
d. Between 1900 and 1980, the population of Cleveland saw an overall
increase of 200.8 thousand people. However, this increase does not reflect 
the behavior of the population function during this period.

Cotton stocks refers to the
amount of raw cotton available.
End stocks specifically refers to
the surplus of raw cotton at the
end of a production period. The
cotton stocks-to-use ratio is cal-
culated by dividing the end
stocks by the amount used during
a production period.
Changes in national and interna-
tional cotton stocks-to-use ratios
can be used as a partial predictor
for cotton prices.

d. Using only the information supplied in Figure 5.9, is it possible to determine the stocks-to-
use ratio in 2009? Explain.
Solution
a. At a relative maximum of a function, the sign of the rate of change of the function changes
from positive to negative. There are two relative maxima between the end of 2005 and the
end of 2009: near the beginning of 2006 (at 
) and again in 2009 (at 
).
b. At a relative minimum of a function, the sign of the rate of change of the function changes
from negative to positive. There is one relative minimum near the middle of 2007 (at 
).
c. There are two inflection points in the stocks-to-use ratio function between the end of 2005
and the end of 2009. The first inflection point is in 2006 
, when the ratio was
decreasing more quickly than in the months before and after that time. The second inflection
point is in 2008 
, when the ratio was increasing most rapidly over the interval
between the end of 2005 and the end of 2009.
d. No; Although the cotton stocks-to-use ratio is decreasing during 2009, the rate-of-change
function does not give enough information to determine the cotton stocks-to-use ratio.

Limits of Sums and the Definite Integral
The examples in the preceding section were carefully chosen so that geometric formulas for
the area of a rectangle, triangle, or trapezoid could be used to calculate the areas of regions
between the rate-of-change graph and the horizontal axis. Most real-life situations are not so
simple. In many cases, rate-of-change data is modeled by a continuous function and a
series of rectangles is used to approximate the region between the function graph and the
input axis.

Approximating Accumulated Change
The manager at a department store is preparing for a “door-buster” sale to occur the following week-
end from 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. Market analysis shows that the manager can expect the number of customers
who attend the sale to change according to the rates of change in Table 5.3.
The rate-of-change data in Table 5.3 can be modeled as
between 6 A.M. and 2 P.M., where t is the number of hours after 6 A.M. The graph of this model is
shown in Figure 5.10.

Left-Rectangle Approximations
The rectangles shown in Figure 5.12 are referred to as left rectangles because the height of each
rectangle is the output value of the function c corresponding to the left endpoint of the base of the
rectangle.
The area of each of these left rectangles represents an estimate for the number of customers
entering the store during that one-hour interval. Summing the estimates for each of the eight
hours gives an estimate for the total number of customers entering the store during the hours of
the sale. Table 5.4 summarizes the calculations of the area of each left-rectangular region as well as
the left-rectangle approximation of the area of region under the curve.

During his short life, the German
mathematician Bernhard Riemann
(1826–1866) made significant
contributions to the fields of calcu-
lus and mathematical physics. The
summing of rectangles to approxi-
mate the area under a curve is
attributed to Riemann, and the sum
is known as the Riemann sum. The
definition for definite integral near
the end of this section is also due
to Riemann. Riemann died of tuber-
culosis at the age of 39.

Right-Rectangle Approximations
A rectangle between the horizontal axis and the graph of a function f with height defined by the
output value of f corresponding to the right endpoint of the base of the rectangle is referred to as
a right rectangle. Example 1 illustrates the use of right rectangles to approximate regions between
the graph of a function and the horizontal axis.
The index i on

rectangle is being used. In this
case, eight rectangles are being

Example 1
Using Right Rectangles to Approximate Change
Drug Concentration
A pharmaceutical company has tested the absorption rate of a drug that is given in 20-milligram
doses for 20 days. Researchers have modeled the rate of change of the concentration of the drug in
the bloodstream as
where m is measured in 
per day and t is the number of days after the drug is
first administered. A graph of this rate-of-change function is shown in Figure 5.13.
a.
Use the model and ten right rectangles to estimate the change in the drug
concentration in the bloodstream while the patient is taking the drug.
b.
Use the model and right rectangles of width two days to estimate the change in the
drug concentration in the bloodstream for the first ten days after the patient stops
taking the drug.
c.
Combine your answers to parts a and b to estimate the change in the drug
concentration in the bloodstream over the 30-day time period.
Solution
a. To determine the change in the drug concentration from the beginning of day 1 through the end
of day 20, use the exponential portion of the model and ten right rectangles. See Figure 5.14 and
Table 5.5.
Over the 20 days that the patient took the drug, the drug concentration in the patient’s blood-
stream increased by approximately 5.97 micrograms per milliliter

From the beginning of day 21 through the end of day 28, the drug concentration decreased
by approximately 4.54 
g/mL.
c. To determine the change in concentration from the beginning of day 1 through the end of
day 30 (using the unrounded area approximations), subtract the amount of decline from the
amount of increase:
The drug concentration increased by approximately 1.44 
g/mL from the beginning of day 1
through the end of day 30.
Midpoint-Rectangle Approximation
It is often true that if a left-rectangle approximation is an overestimate, a right-rectangle area will
be an underestimate and vice versa. For example, consider using four left rectangles and then four
right rectangles to approximate the area of the region between the function 
and
the x-axis between 
and 
. See Figures 5.16 and 5.17.

The left-rectangle approximation is an overestimate, and the right-rectangle approximation is
an underestimate of the actual value.
A rectangle-approximation technique that often estimates areas of regions better than those
using left or right rectangles is the midpoint-rectangle approximation. This approximation uses
rectangles whose heights are calculated at the midpoints of the subintervals.
Quick Example
The midpoint-rectangle approximation of the area of the region between the graph 
of

Better Estimates of Areas
For most curves, the more rectangles used to approximate the region under the curve, the better
the approximation will be. Figures 5.19 and 5.20 show eight midpoint rectangles and sixteen
midpoint rectangles, respectively, to approximate the area under the quarter circle. Eight midpoint
rectangles gives a better estimate than four midpoint rectangles, and sixteen midpoint rectangles
fit even better than eight midpoint rectangles.

Area as a Limit of Sums
Suppose n rectangles of equal width are used to approximate the area of a region R between a
graph of a function f and the input axis over an input interval from a to b. In general, as the num-
ber of rectangles increases without bound (
), the region covered by the rectangles more
closely approximates region R, and the sum of the areas of the rectangles approaches the area of
region R. Figure 5.21 through Figure 5.24 illustrate this progression.
In mathematical terms, the area of the region between the graph of f and the x-axis from a to
b is given by a limit of sums as n increases without bound:

Example 2
Relating Accumulated Change to Signed Area
Wine Consumption
The rate of change of the per capita consumption of wine in the United States from
1970 through 2008 can be modeled as
gallons per year, where x is the number of years since the end of 1970. A graph of the
function is shown in Figure 5.25.
(Source: Based on data from the Wine Institute of California and the Wine Market Council)
a. Find the input values where w crosses the horizontal axis.
b. From 1970 through 2008, according to the model, when was wine consumption
increasing and when was it decreasing?
c. Use a limit of sums to estimate (to two decimal places) the areas of the regions
labeled R1, R2, and R3. Interpret your answers.
d. According to the model, what was the change in the per capita consumption of
wine from the end of 1970 through 2008?
Solution
a. Solving 
gives the input values 
and 
, corresponding to mid-
1979 and early 1995.
b. Wine consumption was increasing from 1970 until mid-1979 and again from early 1995
through 2008. (Wine consumption is increasing where the rate-of-change graph is positive
and decreasing where the rate-of-change graph is negative.)
c. The area of region 
is determined by examining sums of areas of midpoint rectangles for an
increasing number of subintervals of 
until a trend is observed, as shown in
Table 5.9. The area of region 
is approximately 1.67 gallons.
Per capita wine consumption increased by approximately 1.67 gallons from the end of
1970 through mid-1979.
The signed areas of regions 
and R3 are calculated in a similar manner. See Tables 5.10
and 5.11.

The signed area of region 
is approximately –0.88 gallon. The area of 
is approxi-
mately 0.65 gallon.
There was a decrease of approximately 0.88 gallon in per capita wine consumption from
mid-1979 through From early 1995. From early 1995 through the end of 2008, per capita
wine consumption increased by 0.65 gallon.
d. The net change in the per capita consumption of wine from the end of 1970 through 2008 is
calculated as the sum of the signed areas of the three component regions:
gallons
From the end of 1970 through the end of 2008, per capita wine consumption increased by
1.44 gallons.

Net Change in a Quantity
When a rate-of-change function has both positive and negative outputs over a
given input interval, the accumulated change in the quantity function is equal to
the sum of the signed areas of the regions between the graph of the rate-of-change
function and the horizontal axis. This accumulated change is also known as net
change.
In Example 2, the net change in per capita wine consumption from the end of
1970 through 2008, calculated as the sum of the signed areas of regions R1, R2, and R3,
is determined to be approximately 1.44 gallons per person.
The same conclusion is reached by subdividing the entire interval from 1970
through 2008 into n subintervals and estimating the limit of sums of midpoint rectan-
gles over the entire interval as n increases without bound. See Table 5.12.
Accumulated Change and the Definite Integral
The accumulated change of a function f from a to b is described as a limit of sums:
from 
to 
The mathematical shorthand for this notation is
.
The sign 
is called an integral sign. The values a and b identify the input interval, f is the
function, and the symbol 
reminds us of the width 
of each subinterval. When a and b are
specific numbers, 
is known as a definite integral.

There is a relative maximum at

the output value of W at

the output value of W at

Accumulation Functions
Given a rate-of-change function for a certain quantity, the accumulation of change in that quan-
tity can be evaluated by using the area of a region between the rate-of-change curve and the hori-
zontal axis. In the previous section, area approximations were made graphically.
Area approximation methods are valuable, but in some situations it would be helpful to have
a formula that would answer the questions about accumulated change.
Accumulation over Time
An example of accumulation of change taking place over time occurs in river flow problems.
The flow rate past a sensor in the west fork of the Carson River in Nevada is measured period-
ically. Suppose the flow rates for a 28-hour period beginning at 3 A.M. on a spring night can be
modeled as
where t is the number of hours after 3 A.M. See Figure 5.28. 
The volume of water that flowed through the Carson River from 3 A.M. (
) and an end-
ing time x hours later is the area of the region between the graph of f an horizontal axis from
to 
.
Approximations using limits of sums for these areas are shown in Table 5.13 and Figure 5.29.
The curve in Figure 5.29 represents the total volume of water that flowed past the sensor during
the first x hours after 3 A.M.

It is important for hydrogeologists
studying a watershed to know
how much water has flowed
through a river since a specific
starting time. Typically, data on
the rate of flow are gathered and
used to create a flow-rate model
from which the accumulation of
flow can be calculated.

Accumulation Functions

Adding a grid to the graph of f
makes it easier to estimate areas
of regions under f.
Accumulation Function
The accumulation function of a function f, denoted by 
, gives the 
accumulation of the signed area between the horizontal axis and the graph of f from
a to x. The constant a is the input value at which the accumulation is zero; the constant a
is called the initial input value.

Accumulation Functions Defined
As the ending point of the input interval changes, the accumulation of area changes. As long
as the starting time stays constant at some fixed number a, the accumulated change in f from 
a to x, a variable endpoint, can be represented as 
. This integral is called the 
accumulation function of f from a to x. When a function is continuous and bounded over a
specific interval, the corresponding accumulation function will also be continuous over that
same interval.

Accumulation Function Graphs
Numerically: When given the equation for a continuous function, it is possible to sketch a graph
of the accumulation function based on accumulated change, using the limits of sums. Such is the
case in Figure 5.29,
Graphically: When given a graph of a rate-of-change function, it is possible to sketch an accumu-
lation function by estimating the signed areas of the region(s) between the rate-of-change function
and the horizontal axis. The signed areas of regions can be estimated using only a graph (not an
equation) of the rate of change. Sketching an accumulation function is illustrated for the flow rate
of water past the sensor in the Carson River as graphed in Figure 5.30.
In Figure 5.30, each box in the grid has an area of two million cubic feet
.
The region under the curve from 0 to 2 (shaded darker blue in Figure 5.31) is approxi-
mately 
boxes. The area of the region under the curve from 0 to 2 is approximately 9.5
million cubic feet.
•
The region under the curve from 2 to 4 (shaded lighter blue in Figure 5.31) is
approximately 
boxes or 8.5 million cubic feet.

Accumulated Area 
The accumulated changes in Table 5.14 are calculated by summing  the
estimated changes over each interval. These accumulated changes are graphed in
Figure 5.38.
When a portion of a graph is negative, the area below the horizontal axis
indicates a decrease in the accumulation. Example 1 illustrates how to sketch
accumulation graphs for function graphs that go below the horizontal axis.

Solution
a. The area of each box of the grid is 25 thousand employees.
b. Beginning from the far left side of the graph, estimates of accumulated area are made by
counting the boxes between the graph of f and the horizontal axis from 1 to x. These
estimates are listed in the second

Using Concavity to Refine the Sketch of an
Accumulation Function
The circle in Figure 5.47 can be used as a quick indica-
tor of the general shape that an accumulation function
will take:
• An accumulation function showing slower increase
will be shaped a bit like the upper-left arc of a circle.
The accumulation function will be increasing and
concave down.
Accumulation Functions and Concavity
An important tool for accurately sketching accumulation function graphs is an understanding
of how the increasing or decreasing nature of the rate-of-change function (as distinguished
from the sign of the rate-of-change function) affects the shape of the associated accumulation
function.
The procedure for using concavity to refine a sketch of an accumulation function is as
follows:
The rate-of-change function for the
equation that represents the number
of states with PTAs is shown in
Figure 5.45.
The rate-of-change function is posi-
tive for 
and has a relative max-
imum point between 
and

CHAPTER 5
Accumulating Change: Limits of Sums and the Definite Integral
354
The function graph in Figure 5.50 and the slope graph in Figure 5.52 each
cross the horizontal axis twice: near an input value of 4 and again near an input
value of 7. These two input values correspond to the relative maximum and the
relative minimum of the accumulation function that is shown in Figure 5.51.
A comparison of the slope graph of the accumulation function, 
, 
and the original function 
indicates that the slope graph of the accumula-
tion function shown in Figure 5.52 is the same graph as the function graph in
Figure 5.50 except that the input variable in the slope function is labeled x
rather than .

The Fundamental Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects the ideas of accumulated changes and rates-of-
change by showing that antidifferentiation is the opposite operation of differentiation.
Functions, Accumulations, and Slopes
The connection between accumulation functions, slope functions, and quantity functions can be

Reversal of the Derivative Process
The Fundamental Theorem implies that the process of finding an accumulation formula is the 
reverse of the process of finding a derivative. For this reason, the function 
is an 
antiderivative of the function f. Antidifferentiation is the process of starting with a known rate-
of-change function and developing the quantity function.

antiderivative of f and C the constant of integration, and written as

Repeated applications of the Simple Power Rule, the Constant Multiplier Rule, and the Sum Rule
make it possible to find an antiderivative formula for any polynomial function.
Example 1
Using Given Information to Write an 
Antiderivative of a Polynomial
Birth Rate
A certain country has an increasing population but a declining birth rate, a situation that results
from the number of babies born each year increasing but at a slower rate. Last year, 1,185,800
babies were born in that country. Over the next decade, the rate of change in the annual number
of live births is predicted to follow the model
thousand births per year
where t is measured in years and 
at the end of last year. Figure 5.58 shows a graph of this
rate-of-change model.
a. Write a general antiderivative for the function 
. What
are the units of measure for the general antiderivative?
b. Write a model for the annual number of live births.
c. Use the function in part b to estimate the number of babies that will be
born during the last year of the decade modeled.
Solution
a. The general antiderivative for 
is
Multiplying the units of measure of the outputs for b, thousand births per year, times the
units of measure of the input values of b, years, gives the units of measure for the output of
B as thousand births.

It is sometimes necessary to apply the antiderivative process more than once to obtain the appro-
priate accumulation formula.
FTC check uses the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus to check the
antiderivative in the example by
finding the accumulation function
and then the rate-
of-change function.

antiderivative of the acceleration function a:

Refer to Figure 5.61.
In this case, because the piano starts falling at time 0, the velocity at 
is zero. Solving

Recovering a Function
Recovering a function is the phrase used for the process that begins with a rate-of-change func-
tion for a quantity and ends with the quantity function. Writing an antiderivative formula is
recovering a function from the algebraic perspective, and drawing an accumulation graph is
recovering a function from the graphical perspective.
Verbal Perspective: An important part of recovering a function from its rate of change is recov-
ering the units of the function from the units of its rate of change. The rate of change 
of a function f is the slope of a tangent line. Slope is calculated as 
, so its units of mea-
sure are 
:
For example, suppose 
milliliters per hour gives the rate-of-change function of insulin in a 
patient’s body t hours after an injection. The units of the amount function can be recovered
by analyzing the rate-of-change function units of measure as a fraction:
milliliters per hour = 
The denominator of the fraction gives the units of measure of the input t as hours, so the
numerator of the fraction gives the units of measure of the output M(t) as milliliters.
Figure 5.63 shows an input/output diagram for the rate-of-change function, and Figure 5.64
shows an input/output diagram for the recovered function.

5.4 ACTIVITIES
For Activities 1 through 6,
recover the units of measure for
the input and output variables of the quantity function for each
rate-of-change function. Draw input/output diagrams for the
rate-of-change function as well as the quantity function.
1.
The rate of change of electricity usage by a city (in
billion kW per hour) is a function of the time of day
(in hours).
2.
Velocity (miles per hour) is the rate of change of the dis-
tance driven during h hours.
3.
Marginal profit (in dollars per unit) is the rate of change of
the profit when u units are produced and sold.
4.
Marginal product (in units per hour) is the rate of change
of production when x is the number of hours of labor.
5.
The rate of change of the population of Georgia can be
modeled as p , a function of t, where t is the number of
years since 2010.
6.
The rate of change of consumer demand for a name-brand
motor oil is D million bottles per dollar when a bottle of
the motor oil sells for p dollars.
For Activities 7 through 10,
a and b are constants, and x and

The Definite Integral—Algebraically
In Section 5.2, the definite integral (accumulation) of a function was defined using a limit of
sums of areas of rectangles. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects accumulation
functions with antiderivatives and leads to a method of calculating definite integrals by using
antiderivatives.
Two Ways to Look at Change
A certain drug that is dosed at 20 milligrams for 20 days has been found to have a rate of change
of concentration in the bloodstream that can be modeled as
m(t)  1.7(0.8t) 
g/mL per day

Department of Transportation reported at
TBO.com)

where t is the number of days after the drug is first administered, 
. A

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Part 2)
For the drug concentration example, the constant of integration is known. In fact, it does not
matter what value of C is used in calculating a definite integral, so any specific antiderivative (or
even the general antiderivative) function can be used.

The president’s popularity decreased approximately 3.8 percentage
points during the first 12 months after his election. As president-elect,
his popularity rose approximately 13.9 percentage points. During the
first three months in office, his popularity had a net decrease of
approximately 3.9 percentage points. After the first three months in
office, his popularity continued to decrease by approximately 13.8
percentage points.

Two Accumulated Changes
Sometimes the difference between two accumulated changes can be calculated as the area of a
region between two curves. For example, the rate at which the number of patients admitted to a
large inner-city hospital is changing and can be modeled as
and the rate at which patients are discharged can be modeled as
where r is measured in patients per hour. The input for both models is h, the number of hours

Difference between Accumulated Changes
The connection between accumulated change of a function and signed areas of regions between the
function and input axis leads to the following definition of the difference between accumulated changes. 
Difference between Accumulated Changes
If f and g are two continuous rate-of-change functions, the difference between the accu-
mulated change of f from a to b and the accumulated change of g from a to b is the
accumulated change in the difference function

Example 1
Determining the Difference in Accumulated Changes
Tire Manufacturers
A major European tire manufacturer forecasts its sales of tires to increase exponentially over the
next decade. Their model for the rate of change of accumulated sales (in U.S. dollars) is
where t is the year, starting with 
as the end of last year.
An American tire manufacturer’s forecast for rate of change of accumulated sales over the next
decade is modeled as
where t is the year, starting with 
as the beginning of the current year. Figure 5.95
shows s and u graphed together.
a. According to Figure 5.95, which manufacturer forecasts greater sales between 5
and 10 years in the future?
b. According to the forecast models, by how much will the amount of accumulated
sales differ for these two companies during the last half of the decade?
Solution
a. The European manufacturer predicts greater sales between 
and 
than
does the American manufacturer.
b. The difference in the amount of accumulated sales 5 to 10 years from now is calculated as
in the European company’s favor.
Differences between Intersecting Functions
When calculating the differences between accumulated changes for two continuous rate-of-
change functions that intersect it is not necessary to split the interval of integration into
subintervals.

Moth Mortality
Varley and Gradwell studied the
population size of a species of winter moth in a wooded
area between 1950 and 1968. They found that predatory
beetles ate few moths when the moth population
was small, searching elsewhere for food; but when the
population was large, the beetles assembled in large clus-
ters in the area where the moth population laid eggs, thus
increasing the proportion of moths eaten by the beetles.
Suppose the number of winter moth larvae in Varley and
Gradwell’s study that survived winter kill and parasitism
between 1961 and 1968 can be modeled as
and the number of pupae surviving the predatory beetles
each year during the same time period can be modeled as
In both models, output is measured in hundred moths per
square meter per year and t is the number of years since
1960, and square meters refers to the area of the tree
canopy.

Carbon Emissions
In response to EPA regulations, a fac-
tory that produces carbon emissions plants 22 hectares of
forest in 1990. The trees absorb carbon dioxide as they
grow, thus reducing the carbon level in the atmosphere.
The EPA requires the trees to absorb as much carbon in 20
years as the factory produces during that time. The trees
absorb no carbon until they are 5 years old. Between 5 and
20 years of age, the trees absorb carbon at the rates indi-
cated in the table.
(Source: Adapted from A. R. Ennos and S. E. R. Bailey, Problem
Solving in Environmental Biology, Harlow, Essex, England:
Longman House, 1995)
d. After 20 years, will the amount of carbon absorbed by
the trees be at least as much as the amount produced
by the factory during that time period, as required by

Average Value and Average Rate of Change
Averaging is a balancing out of extreme values. Students are familiar with calculating test averages
by adding grades and dividing by the number of tests. Grades are discrete data. This section intro-
duces averaging in continuous situations or in situations where discrete averaging is impractical.
Averages of Continuous Functions
Without a monitor, it is impractical to measure a person’s average heart rate (in bpm, beats per
minute) over a 50-minute period during moderate activity. Instead, a person’s heart rate could be
measured every ten minutes (as shown in Figure 5.99).
The average heart rate over the 50-minute period can be found by summing the six given
heart rates and dividing by six (the number of data points). The average heart rate is approxi-
mately 100.8 beats per minute.
A more accurate average is found when heart rate is measured every five minutes (as in
Figure 5.100). The average heart rate with measures taken every five minutes is estimated as
100.73 beats per minute.
In this scenario, the heart rate is constantly changing and can be modeled by fitting a continuous
function to the data in Figure 5.100. The heart rate can be modeled as
where t is the number of minutes since the test began.
Integrating this function over the 50-minute interval gives a close approximation of the total
number of heart beats during that period
Dividing the total number of beats by the length of the interval over which they occurred
(50 minutes) yields the average heart rate of 101 beats per minute.

Development of Average Value
For a continuous function f with
respect to x, the average value of f
over an interval from a to b can be
approximated by dividing the inter-
val into n subintervals of width
, evaluating the function
at an input 
in each subinterval,
summing the function values, and
dividing by n:

Figure 5.101 shows the continuous function that models the heart rate. The shaded
region represents the total number of beats in 50 minutes, and the horizontal line rep-

Average Value of a Function
The average value of a function over an interval can be graphically interpreted as the
signed height of a rectangle whose area equals the area between the function and the
horizontal axis over the interval.
Average value is represented algebraically as the definite integral of a function over
an interval divided by the length of that interval.

Determining Which Quantity to Average
South Carolina Population (Historic)
The growth rate of the population of South Carolina between 1790 and 2000 can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since 1790. The population of South Carolina in 1990 was 3486
thousand people. (Source: Based on data from Statistical Abstract, 2001)
a. What was the average rate of change in population from 1995 through 2000?
b. What was the average size of the population from 1995 through 2000?
Solution
a. The average rate of change in population between 1995 and 2000 is calculated directly from
the rate-of-change function as
p(t)  0.18t  1.57 thousand people per year
We use the terms average
rate of change and average
value of the rate of change
interchangeably.
Average Rate of Change
In Section 2.1, the average rate of change of a continuous function f from a to b is calculated as
.

g(x)  0.0046x2  0.43x  149.05
When the given function describes the rate of change of a quantity, the average rate of change
is the average value of that rate-of-change function.

Using the fact that the population in 1990 was 3486 thousand people, solve for C to form the

where t is the number of years since 1790.
Using 
, the average population between 1995 and 2000 is
In Example 2, the average value of the population was found by integrating the population
function, whereas the average rate of change was found by integrating the rate-of-change func-
tion. This example illustrates an important principle:

Averages in Economics 
Marginal cost (the rate of change of cost) is the cost incurred in the production of the next unit
when q units have already been produced. Average cost is the cost incurred (on average) in the
production of any one unit when q units have been produced. If 
, average cost is related
to marginal cost by the formula
where 
represents average cost of production for b units and 
is marginal cost.

Calculating Average Cost from Marginal Cost
Oil Production
At a certain American oil field, the marginal cost of producing crude oil can be modeled as
dollars per barrel
where q million barrels have already been produced.
a. Calculate the average cost of production when 16 million barrels are produced.
b. Locate the point(s) at which marginal cost is equal to average cost during the production of
16 million barrels.
Solution
a. The average cost of production when 
is calculated as
Each barrel (of the 16 million produced) costs an average of $20.56 to produce.
b.
Figure 5.104 shows a graph of marginal cost from 0 to 16 million
barrels and the average cost of $20.56. Marginal cost equals average cost
twice on the interval 
. These equalities occur at production
levels of 
million barrels and 
million barrels.

Average Values and Sine Models 
The constant k of the function 
is referred to as the aver-
age (or expected) value of the cycle. This is the value the function is expected to
take on if it were not for the fluctuations that occur. Example 4 illustrates that the
constant k of a sine function is its average value over one cycle.

Calculating Average Value
Radiation
A model for the amount of ultraviolet radiation received in Auckland, New Zealand, is
during the mth month of the year. Figure 5.105 shows the radiation model along with a horizon-
tal line marking the expected value given by the model.
a. What is the expected value of radiation if fluctuations do not occur?
b. Calculate the average value for one cycle of this model, beginning at 
.
Solution
a. The expected value of the function r is 
watts per cm2.
b. The function r has period 
. So the average value of the
cycle, beginning at 
, can be calculated as
Discounting for seasonal fluctuation, the UV radiation in Auckland over a period
of 1 year is expected to be to be 32.5 watts per cm2.

Carbon Monoxide Emissions
The federal government
sets standards for toxic substances in the air. Often these
standards are stated in the form of average pollutant levels
over a period of time on the basis of the reasoning that
exposure to high levels of toxic substances is harmful, but
prolonged exposure to moderate levels is equally harmful.
For example, carbon monoxide (CO) levels may not exceed
35 ppm (parts per million) at any time, but they also must
not exceed 9 ppm averaged over any 8-hour period.

Integration of Product or Composite
Functions 
The functions discussed up to this point in Chapter 5 have been functions for which the anti-
derivatives can be dealt with using simple antiderivative rules and operations. In this section, tech-
niques for finding antiderivative formulas for functions that were constructed using
multiplication, division, or composition are introduced.
Algebraic Manipulation before Integration
Some functions that are not initially in the correct form for applying simple antiderivative rules
can be rewritten into the correct form by using algebraic manipulation.
Functions that are formed by the product of two polynomials can be rewritten as a single
polynomial function.

Integration by Substitution
When a product function appears to be a composite function times the derivative of the inside
function, its antiderivative can be found by reversing the Chain Rule for derivatives. The chain
rule for derivatives states that
For a composite function f where the input u is itself a function of x, the derivative of f with
respect to x is given by the derivative of the outside function times the derivative of the inside
function:
Reversing the Chain Rule for derivatives leads to a process called integration by substitution.

Integration by Substitution
For a product function f with respect to x that is of the form 
(that is, a
composite function times the derivative of the inside function), the antiderivative of f is
with the inside function substituted back in for u.

CHAPTER SUMMARY  
Approximating Results of Change
The accumulated results of change are best understood in geo-
metric terms: Positive accumulation is the area of a region
between the graph of a positive rate-of-change function and the
horizontal axis, and negative accumulation is the signed area of a
region between the graph of a negative rate-of-change function
and the horizontal axis. Areas of nonrectangular regions can be
approximated by summing areas of rectangular regions.
Limits of Sums and Accumulation
Functions
The area of a region between the graph of a continuous, non-
negative function f and the horizontal axis from a to b is given by
a limit of sums
Here, the points are the midpoints of n rectangles of width
between a and b.
More generally, the limit applied to an arbitrary, continuous,
bounded function f over the interval from a to b is called the
definite integral of f from a to b:
An accumulation function is an integral of the form 
, 
where the upper limit x is a variable. This function gives us a for-
mula for calculating accumulated change in a quantity.

CHAPTER 5
Accumulating Change: Limits of Sums and the Definite Integral

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The Fundamental Theorem sets forth the fundamental connec-
tion between the two main concepts of calculus, the derivative
and the integral. For any continuous function f
The derivative of an accumulation function of 
is
.
Reversing the order of these two processes, and beginning by
differentiating first, returns the starting function plus a constant.
The FTC as it applies to indefinite integrals gives two properties:
For a continuous, differentiable function f with input variable x
and 
A function F is an antiderivative of f if 
. Because the
derivative of 
is 
, 
is an anti-
derivative of 
. Each continuous, bounded function has 
infinitely many antiderivatives, but any two differ by only a
constant. The Fundamental Theorem is used to find accumula-
tion function formulas by finding antiderivatives.
The Definite Integral
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is used to show that
when f is a smooth, continuous function, the definite integral 
can be evaluated by
where F is any antiderivative of f.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus ensures that each
continuous, bounded function does indeed have an antideriva-
tive. If an algebraic expression for an antiderivative can be found,
then a definite integral can be evaluated. When an antiderivative
formula cannot be found, technology can be used to approxi-
mate the definite integral.
To compute the area between two curves, we used the fact
that if the graph of f lies above the graph of g from a to b, the 
integral 
is the area of the region between the
two graphs from a to b.
If the two functions intersect between a and b, the difference
between the accumulated changes of the functions is not the same
as the total area of the regions between the two rate-of-change
curves.
Average Values and Average Rates

tinuous function for a quantity

Analyzing Accumulated Change: Integrals in Action
418
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
Chapter 6 presents several applications of integration. Integrals can be used to calculate perpetual
accumulation, present and future values of income streams, and future values of biological streams.
Integrals can be applied to economics topics and be used to calculate economic quantities of inter-
est to consumers and producers. Integrals can also be used to calculate probabilities and solve dif-
ferential equations (equations involving one or more derivative formulas).
6.1
Perpetual Accumulation and Improper 
Integrals
Definite integrals have specific numbers for both the upper limit and the lower limit. In this section,
what happens to the accumulation of change when one or both of the limits of the integral
are infinite is considered. These integrals are of the form 
or 
and 
are referred to as improper integrals. Improper integrals play a role in economics and statistics as
well as in other fields of study.
Improper Integrals from Three Perspectives
The improper integral 
can be thought of graphically as the area of the region
between the graph of 
and the x-axis from 2 to infinity. See Figure 6.1.

Numerically, the area of this region can be estimated by considering the region between the
graph of f and the x-axis from 2 to a certain, large input value N and then evaluating the limit
of the integral as N increases without bound. Table 6.1 shows area calculations for increasing
values of N.
The improper integral 
can be evaluated algebraically as the limiting value of
definite integrals as one endpoint increases without bound:

Carbon-14 dating methods are sometimes used by archeologists to determine the age of an arti-
fact. The rate at which 100 milligrams of 14C is decaying can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since the 100 milligrams began to decay. See Figure 6.2.

Streams in Business
Some income streams flow at rates that remain the same over time, but other income streams have
flow rates that vary as a function of time. For example, a business that posts an annual profit of
$4.3 million allocates 5% of its profits as a continuous stream into investments.
Constant flow: If the company’s profits remain constant, the function that describes the stream
flowing into the investments is
t years after the company posted a profit of $4.3 million. (See Figure 6.5)
Linear flow: If the company’s profits increase by $0.2 million each year, the stream is flow-
ing at a rate of
t years after the company posted a profit of $4.3 million.
Exponential flow: If the company’s profits increase by a constant 7% each year, the func-
tion that describes the flow rate of the stream is
t years after the company posted a profit of $4.3 million.
There could be other possibilities for flow rates given different situations.
Income Streams and Flow Rates
Determining the rate at which income flows into an investment is the first step in answering ques-
tions about the present and future values of the invested income stream.
R(t)  0.05  4.3(1.07t) million dollars per year
R(t)  0.05(4.3  0.2t) million dollars per year
R(t)  0.05  4.3  0.215 million dollars per year
Income Stream
An income stream is a regular flow of money that is generated by a business or an invest-
ment. The rate of flow is a function R that varies according to time t.
Example 1
Writing Flow Rate Equations
Business Start-up
After graduating from college, several friends started a small business that immediately became
successful. When the business was established, the partners determined that 10% of the prof-
its will be continuously invested each year. In the first year, the company posted a profit of
$579,000. Determine the income stream flow rate for the investments over the next several
years if
a. The business’s profit remains constant.
b. The profit grows by $50,000 each year.
c. The profit increases by 17% each year.

Solution
a. If the profit remains constant, then the flow rate of the investment stream is constant,
calculated as 10% of $579,000. Thus,

b. Profit increasing by a constant amount each year indicates linear growth. In this case, the
amount of profit that is invested is described by

where t is the number of years after startup.
c. An increase in profit of 17% each year indicates exponential growth with a constant
percentage change of 17%. In this case, the flow rate of the investment stream is described by
per year
where t is the number of years after startup.
d. A scatter plot of the data (see Figure 6.6) indicates an increasing, concave-down shape. A log
model fits the data well and would continue to model a successful business:

Future Value of a Continuous Stream
The future value of a continuous stream is the total accumulated value of the income stream and
its earned interest at some time in the future.

in years, into an account that earns interest at the annual rate of 100r% compounded
continuously.

Future Value of a Continuous Income Stream
Suppose that an income stream flows continuously into an interest-bearing account at the

The amount being paid in at the beginning of the interval, t, earns interest continuously for

Summing over n subintervals yields the approximation:

Calculating the Future Value of a Continuous Income
Stream
Airline Expansion
The owners of a small airline are planning to expand. They hope to be able to buy out a larger
airline 10 years from now by investing in an account returning 5.4% APR. Assume a continuous
income stream and continuous compounding of interest.
a. The owners have determined that they can afford to invest $3.3 million each year. How much
will these investments be worth 10 years from now?
b. If the airline’s profits increase so that the amount the owners invest each year increases by 8%
per year, how much will their investments be worth in 10 years?
Solution
a. The flow rate of the income stream is 
dollars per year with 
and 
. The value of these investments in 10 years is calculated as
H I N T  6 . 6
b. The function modeling exponential growth of 8% per year in the investment stream is
per year after t years. The future value is calculated (using
technology) as
Flow Rates and Rates of Change
The flow rate for a continuous income stream is not the same thing as the rate of change of that
stream.
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the rate-of-change function for future
value is:
The function 
gives the rate of change (after t years) of the future value
(in T years) of an income stream whose income is flowing continuously in at a rate of 
per year.
The rate-of-change function 
, rather than the flow rate of the income
stream, 
, is graphed when illustrating future value as the area of a region beneath a rate-of-
change function.

College Grant Funds
A corporation offers merit-based college grants to children of its employees. To establish an annu-
ity that will start generating funds twenty years from now, the corporation sets up an income
stream that will deposit 3% of the corporation’s profit into the fund, which bears 8% interest com-
pounded continuously. Corporate profit is currently $2 billion annually and is expected to
decrease by 0.05% per year over the next 20 years.
a. Write a flow rate equation for the income stream and determine the 20-year principal.
b. Write a rate-of-change function for the future value of the income stream.

Present Value of a Continuous Income Stream
Suppose that an income stream flows continuously into an interest-bearing account at
the rate of R(t) dollars per year, where t is measured in years, and that the account earns
interest at the annual rate of 100r% compounded continuously. The present value of
the account is

c. The amount of interest earned on the income stream over the 20-year period is
calculated as the area of the region between the graph of 
and the graph of R
from 0 to 20 (see Figure 6.11):
d. The college fund annuity’s initial worth is the same as the 20-year future value of
the income stream. This future value can either be calculated using the definite
integral
or as a simple sum of the principal and earned interest found in parts a and c.
Present Value of a Continuous Stream
The present value of a continuous income stream is the amount P that would need to be
invested at the present time so that it would grow to a specified future value under stated
conditions.
An investment of P dollars earning continuously compounded interest would grow to a future
value of PerT dollars in T years, using the formula

Corporate Acquisition
Alpha Industries is attempting to negotiate a buyout of one of their suppliers, Beta Plastics. An
annual income of $1.1 million per year is projected for Beta Plastics. Analysts for Alpha Industries
project that by owning Beta Plastics, Alpha could increase their current annual income of $1 mil-
lion to an income starting at $1.6 million per year and growing at a rate of 5% per year. Both com-
panies can reinvest their income at 5.5%. Calculations of present value over a specified period will
enter into discussions to determine an offer for the purchase.

Perpetual Income Streams
When there is no specific end date to an income stream, the stream is considered to flow in perpetuity.
For example, when a company leases land rights from its parent corporation to harvest bio-
mass from that land for the life of the company, the parent corporation might, in turn, create a
fund with the lease money that allows it to purchase more land at some indefinite time. Because
there is no definite end date for the income stream, it can be considered to flow in perpetuity.
In the case of a perpetual income stream, the end time T is considered to be infinite and the
present value of such a stream is calculated as the improper integral

b. To set up a lump-sum investment that would grow to the same value as the income stream
generated by the lease of the paintings, the Smithsonian would have to invest 28.3 thousand
dollars.
Streams in Biology
Biology and other fields involve situations similar to income streams. An example of this is the
growth of populations of animals.
As of 1978, there were approximately 1.5 million sperm whales in the world’s oceans. Each year,
approximately 0.06 million sperm whales are added to the population. Each year, 4% of the sperm
whale population either die of natural causes or are killed by hunters. 
(Source: Delphine Haley, Marine Mammals, Seattle: Pacific Search Press, 1978)
Assuming that these rates (and percentage rates) have remained constant since 1978, the
sperm whale population in 1998 can be estimated using the same procedure as when determining
future value of continuous income streams.
There are two aspects of the population that must be considered when estimating the popu-
lation of sperm whales in 1998:
•
The number of whales living in 1978 that will still be living in 1998:
Because 4% of the sperm whales die each year, the number of whales that have survived
the entire 20 years is
whales
•
The change in the population made by the birth of new whales:
Each year, 0.06 million whales are added to the population and, each year, 96% of those
survive. Therefore, the growth rate of the population of sperm whales associated with
those that were born t years after 1978 is
The sperm whale population in 1998 is calculated as

Functions that model biological streams where new individuals are added to the population
and the rate of survival of the individuals is known are referred to as survival and renewal functions.

Determining the Future Value of a Biological Stream
Flea Population
In cooler areas of the country, adult fleas die before winter, but flea eggs survive and hatch the fol-
lowing spring when temperatures again reach 70°F. Not all the eggs hatch at the same time, so part
of the growth in the flea population is due to the hatching of the original eggs. Another part of the
growth in the flea population is due to propagation.
Suppose fleas propagate at the rate of 134% per day and that the original set of fleas (from the
dormant eggs) become reproducing adults at the rate of 600 fleas per day. What will the flea pop-
ulation be 10 days after the first 600 fleas begin reproducing? Assume that none of the fleas die
during the 10-day period and that all fleas become reproducing adults 24 hours after hatching and
propagate every day thereafter at the rate of 134% per day.
Solution
The count began when the first 600 fleas became mature adults. The initial population is
. The renewal rate is also 600 fleas per day, so 
.
The renewal rate function r does not account for renewal due to propagation. The propaga-
tion rate of 134% must be incorporated into the survival rate of 100%. Thus, the survival/propa-
gation rate is 
.
Because the renewal rate and survival/propagation rate are given in days, the input variable, t,
is measured in days. The flea population will grow over 10 days to

Tenet Healthcare (Historic)
On October 4, 1996,
Tenet Healthcare Corporation, the second-largest hospi-

a. If Tenet Healthcare Corporation assumed that Ornda’s
annual revenue of $0.273 billion would increase by
10% per year and that the revenues could be continu-

CSX (Historic)
CSX Corporation, a railway company,
announced in October of 1996 its intention to buy Conrail,
Inc., for $8.1 billion. The combined company, CSX-Conrail,
would control 29,000 miles of track and have an annual rev-
enue of $14 billion the first year after the merger, making it
one of the largest railway companies in the country.

a. If Conrail assumed that its $2 billion annual revenue
would decrease by 5% each year for the next 10 years
but that the annual revenue could be reinvested at an
annual return of 20%, what would Conrail consider to
be its 10-year present value at the time of CSX’s offer?
Is this more or less than the amount CSX offered?
b. CSX Corporation forecast that its Conrail acquisition
would add $1.2 billion to its annual revenue the first

by 2% each year. Suppose CSX is able to reinvest that
revenue at an annual return of 20%. What would CSX
Corporation have considered to be the 10-year present
value of the Conrail acquisition in October 1996?

Calculus in Economics—Demand and Elasticity
Understanding consumer demand is important in economics, management, and marketing. The
amount of a good or service that consumers buy can be considered as a function of the price they
have to pay. This function is known as a demand function or demand curve.
A Demand Curve
An example of demand being driven by price can be seen in the petroleum industry. When gasoline
prices increase, Americans respond by traveling less. Figure 6.12 shows a demand curve for gasoline.

Figure 6.12
When market price for gas is $2.70 per gallon, Americans are willing and able to spend
approximately $1.19 billion on 367.2 million gallons of gasoline each day.
Americans’ actual expenditure for this gasoline is approximately $991.4 million dollars,
creating a daily consumer surplus of almost $200 million.
When gas prices are less than $2.70 per gallon, increases in price result in relatively small
changes in demand, but when gas prices are over $2.70 per gallon, small changes in price result
in relatively large decreases in demand.
Demand Functions
Demand is affected by several factors, including utility (usefulness), necessity, the availability of
substitutes, and buyer income. However, when all other factors are held constant, the quantity
demanded can be considered as a function of market price.

Demand Function
A function giving the expected quantity of a commodity purchased at a specified market
price is referred to as a demand function or demand schedule. The demand function D
relates the input variable p (price per unit) with the output variable 
(quantity).
The graph of a demand function is referred to as a demand curve.  
q  D(p)
Quick Example
Demand functions are typically decreasing functions because price and quantity demanded are
inversely related for most commodities.
The Law of Demand
All other factors being constant, as the price of a commodity increases, the market will
react by demanding less and, as the price of a commodity decreases, the market will react
by demanding more.

Graphs of Demand and Inverse Demand
The demand function D, giving quantity as a function of price, assumes that price dictates
demand. The inverse relation can also be considered—where the quantity provided dictates
price. This inverse relationship is known as the inverse demand function and is graphed with the
quantity, q, on the horizontal axis and price per unit, p, on the vertical axis (as in Figure 6.14
for the inverse demand of potatoes).
The traditional approach to graphing in economic theory is to put quantity on the
horizontal axis. For the demand function, this places input on the vertical axis and out-
put on the horizontal axis and results in a graph that looks like that of the inverse demand
curve.
In this text, demand functions are graphed as all other functions are graphed with input
on the horizontal axis and output on the vertical axis.

“Why does my economics text show demand as a function of quantity?”
In economic theory, many functions (such as cost, revenue, and profit) are graphed
with quantity on the horizontal axis. The demand curve is likewise drawn with quantity
on the horizontal axis. Reading the economics text carefully can reveal whether price or
quantity is considered to be the input variable.  If quantity is considered to be the input
variable, the economics text is dealing with the inverse demand function.  If price is
considered to be the input variable, the economics text is simply drawing the demand
function on a reversed set of axes to keep quantity on the horizontal axis. 
Consumer Expenditure
Consumer expenditure is the price per unit of a commodity times the quantity purchased by con-
sumers. Assuming that demand is satisfied, the quantity purchased is the same as the quantity in
demand. This expenditure is represented graphically as the area of a rectangle under the demand curve.

This process is the same as summing rectangles under a curve. Using the limit of sums of rectan-

Solution
a. Consumers will purchase 2.5 million minivans, 
, at 
.
At a market price of approximately $23,600 per minivan, consumers will
purchase 2.5 million minivans.
b. Consumer expenditure is calculated as
When 2.5 million minivans are purchased, consumer expenditure will be
approximately $59 billion. Consumer expenditure is depicted as the shaded
rectangle in Figure 6.27.
c. The demand function crosses the horizontal axis near 
(found
by solving 
). According to the model, the price above which
consumers will purchase no minivans is approximately $58,200 per minivan.
d. Consumer surplus is the area of the shaded region in Figure 6.28, calculated as
Both consumer expenditure and consumer surplus are represented as the area
of a region whose width is measured in thousand dollars per minivan and
whose height is measured in million minivans. The units on consumer surplus
are the same as the units on consumer expenditure.
Consumer surplus when purchasing 2.5 million minivans is approximately
$27.4 billion.
e. The amount that consumers are willing and able to spend for 2.5 million
minivans is the combined area of the two shaded regions in Figure 6.27 and
Figure 6.28. Consumers are willing and able to spend approximately $86.4
billion on the purchase of 2.5 million minivans.

Elasticity of Demand
Elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of a function’s output to a change in its input variable.
Because the measures of the quantities of output and input are normally very different, elasticity
uses a ratio of percentage rates of change to compare relative changes. In the case of demand, the
price elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage rate of change of the quantity demanded
divided by the rate of change of the price per unit:
H I N T  6 . 8
Price elasticity of demand is normally negative because the rate of change of demand is
normally negative.
The magnitude of (absolute value of) elasticity is used to characterize the sensitivity of the output
of a function (demand) to changes in the input (market price) of that function.
•
When the magnitude of elasticity is greater than 1 at a given market price, a small change in
price results in a relatively large response in the change of demand. Demand is elastic at price p.
•
When the magnitude of elasticity is less than 1 at a given market price, a small change in price
results in a relatively small response in the change of demand. Demand is inelastic at price p.
•
When the magnitude of elasticity is exactly 1 at a given market price, demand has unit elas-
ticity at that price.

Solution
a. An expression for elasticity is
Because price elasticity of demand is negative, unit elasticity occurs when 
. Solving
gives 
.
Unit elasticity occurs when minivans are priced approximately at 13.76 thousand dollars per
minivan. At this price, demand is approximately 5.19 million minivans.
b. Checking  for values of p on either side of 13.76 will identify over which interval demand is
elastic.
When 
, 
For prices less than 13.76 thousand dollars per minivan, demand is inelastic (not highly
responsive to small increases in price).
When 
, 
For prices greater than 13.76 thousand dollars per minivan, demand is elastic (responsive to
small increases in price).

Calculus in Economics—Supply and

When prices go up, consumers respond by demanding less. However, manufacturers and producers
respond to higher prices by supplying more. Functions that represent quantity supplied by produc-
ers, given the market price per unit, are called supply functions, and the graphs are called supply curves.

Supply Functions
Several factors affect the supply of a commodity, including availability of resources, impact of tech-
nology, and intervention by government (taxes, subsidies, laws). However, when all other factors
are held constant, the quantity supplied by producers can be considered as a function of market
price.

Supply Function
A function giving the expected quantity of a commodity supplied at a specified market
price is referred to as a supply function or supply schedule. The supply function S relates
the input variable p (price per unit) with the output variable 
(quantity).
The graph of a supply function is referred to as a supply curve.
q  S(p)
When the market price of a commodity is less than the average variable production cost for that
commodity, the manufacturer will choose to shut down production until the market price is bet-
ter. The point 
below which producers are unwilling or unable to supply any quantity of
a commodity is known as the shutdown point.
(ps, S(ps))
Shutdown
The shutdown price, 
is the lowest market price that producers are willing and able to
accept to supply any quantity of a certain commodity. The shutdown point is the point
on the supply curve that marks the conditions (market price and quantity)
under which the production of a commodity will shut down.
(ps, S(ps))
ps,
A supply function with a nonzero shutdown price 
is a piecewise-defined function for which the
output of the first part of the function (over the interval 
) is 0.

Producer Willingness and Ability to Receive
Verbally: Producer willingness and ability to receive is the minimum 
amount of money producers need to receive in order to supply a certain 
quantity of a commodity.
Algebraically: For a continuous supply function S, the minimum amount producers are
willing and able to receive for a certain quantity 
of a commodity is given by
where 
is the market price at which 
units are supplied, and 
is the shutdown
price.
(If there is no shutdown price, 
.)
Graphically: Producer willingness and
ability to receive is the area of the shaded
region in Figure 6.37.

Because economists graph with quantity on the horizontal axis, they depict producer willingness
and ability to receive as the area of the shaded region in Figure 6.39. However, because price is the
input regardless of graphical viewpoint, the area is still calculated as
Producer Surplus
The amount that producers receive in excess of the minimum amount that they require to supply
a certain quantity of a commodity is known as producer surplus. Producer surplus benefits soci-
ety as a whole because producers are able to use surplus to develop better or different products,
invest in other economic sectors, or pass it on to their employees as money or added benefits.
Producer surplus is calculated as producer revenue minus producer willingness and ability to
receive:
Producer surplus is graphically represented as the region between the supply curve and the price
axis. See Figure 6.40.

Equilibrium and Social Gain
The market price and quantity (p*, q*) at which supply equals demand is called the equilibrium
point. At the equilibrium price p*, the quantity demanded by consumers coincides with the quan-
tity supplied by producers. This quantity is q*.
Society benefits when consumers and/or producers have surplus funds. When the mar-
ket price of a product is the equilibrium price for that product, the total benefit to society
is the consumers’ surplus plus the producer surplus. This amount is known as the total
social gain.

Market Equilibrium and Social Gain
Market equilibrium occurs when the supply of a commodity is equal to the
demand for that commodity.
For a commodity with demand function D and supply function S, the 
coordinates of the equilibrium point
are the market price 
that satisfies the
equation 
and the quantity 
.
Total social gain from a commodity is the sum of producer surplus and consumer
surplus at market equilibrium.
When q* units are produced and sold at
a market price of p*, total social gain is
represented by the entire shaded region
in Figure 6.45. The value 
is the price
below which production shuts down, and
pmax is the price above which consumers will
not purchase.

Calculus in Probability (Part 1)
This section discusses the use of integrals when measuring the likelihood that certain events will
occur in situations that involve an element of chance or uncertainty. A probability distribution is
a curve that shows all the possible values (or outcomes) along with the likelihood that each value
occurs.
Histograms
The scores of the 1,518,859 students taking the mathematics portion of the SAT Reasoning Test
in 2008 ranged between 200 and 800 points.

This distribution of the SAT math scores can be viewed with a histogram. A histogram is a graph
composed of rectangles so that the area of each rectangle gives the fraction of students with scores
in the corresponding interval. This means that the height of each rectangle is found by dividing its
area by the width of the score interval. (See Table 6.4.)

A histogram is a graph
composed of adjacent
rectangles drawn so that
the widths of the rec-
tangles represent non-
overlapping intervals.
To use the his-
togram for probability
density, the area of each
rectangle is scaled so
that the sum of the areas
of the rectangles is one.
A histogram based on the math score groupings in Table 6.3 is shown in Figure 6.49.

a. The distribution peaks near 500, and most students taking the test had SAT math scores that

b. The total area enclosed by the rectangles equals 1:
c. Summing areas from the third column in Table 6.3, the proportion of scores between 300

Area as Probability
A continuous random variable is one that can take on any real number value in a certain inter-
val where those numerical values are determined by the results of an experiment involving
chance.
The probability of an event is a measure of how likely it is to happen. The probability of an
outcome is the proportion of times it occurs when an experiment involving chance is repeated
under similar conditions a large number of times.
To calculate the probability that a 2008 college-bound senior made a score between 400 and
600 on the SAT math test. The distribution of SAT math scores are shown numerically in
Table 6.3 and graphically in Figure 6.49,

Taking the math portion of the SAT is the experiment that is repeated, under similar con-
ditions, a large number of times (1,518,859 students took the test).

•
Assuming that no student’s individual score is known, the continuous random variable is
the student’s SAT math score.
The particular event is that the value of the SAT math score lies in the interval of values
between 400 and 600. The probability that a student’s math score, x, is between 400 and 600 is
the proportion of scores in that interval. From the information in Table 6.3 and Figure 6.49, we
have that the proportion of students whose scores are between 400 and 500 is 0.2886. The pro-
portion of students whose scores are between 500 and 600 is 0.3115. The proportion of students
whose SAT math scores are between 400 and 600 is 0.2886  0.3115  0.6001. 
Probabilities are proportions, so they are real numbers between 0 and 1. A certain or sure event
is one that must happen, so its probability is 1. An event that cannot happen is known as an impos-
sible event. The probability of an impossible event is 0. All other probabilities are positive values
between 0 and 1.
N O T E
The notation 
is read
“the probability that the value of
the random variable x is between
the real numbers a and b.”
P(a  x  b)
Quick Example
Referring again to the 2008 SAT math test, let the random variable x represent a 
student’s math score.
•
A math score between 200 and 800 is a sure event because all the math scores lie
in this interval. So, 
. In part b of Example 1, the total area
enclosed by all the rectangles in the histogram was found to be 1.
•
A math score of 950 is not possible because the highest score is 800. The probability
that a student scores 950 on the test is 0:

P(x  950)  0

H I S T O R I C A L  N O T E
The theory of probability has its
origins in France around 1654 with
games of chance. Chevalier de
Méré, a French nobleman with an
interest in gaming and gambling
questions, corresponded with a
French mathematician, Blaise
Pascal, about which outcomes of
throwing two dice were more
likely. This led to the creation of a
mathematical theory of probability
by Pascal and another French
mathematician, Pierre de Fermat.
Note that probabilities for continuous random variables are associated with intervals only. That
is, 
for a continuous random variable x and any real number a. Graphically, 
is the area of a rectangle with width 0. No matter what the height, the area of the rectangle is 0.
In the SAT math score illustration, 
.
The histograms discussed in this section are drawn such that the total area enclosed by all the
rectangles in each histogram is 1 and the area of each rectangle equals the probability that the value
of the random variable is in the interval that forms the base of the rectangle. For that reason, these
histograms are called probability histograms.
Probability Density Functions
If there is a large number of intervals in a histogram, it often simplifies matters to approximate
the behavior of the random variable with a continuous function. See Figure 6.50. The continu-
ous function to approximate the scores on the 2008 Math SAT is overdrawn in black on a more
detailed distribution of scores for the 2008 college-bound seniors on the mathematics portion
of the SAT Reasoning Test. This continuous function is the familiar bell-shaped curve com-
monly called the normal distribution.
If more score intervals with width less than those in Figure 6.50 are used to draw
a histogram of the scores, the approximation by the normal distribution becomes
better. This process is used in the definition of the definite integral. Probabilities are
estimated by finding areas under curves. The function used to describe a continuous
probability distribution is called a probability density function.

have recovered.

There is approximately a 16.8% chance that the recovery time for a patient will be between
42 minutes and 48 minutes. This is shown as the shaded area in Figure 6.52.
d.
There is approximately a 68.8% chance that recovery will be half an hour or more.
Measures of Center and Variability
One important characteristic of a density function is its central value. The measure of central value
that we consider is the mean (commonly referred to as the average). The mean is denoted by the
Greek letter .
Distributions can have the same mean but a completely different spread, or variability, about
that center. One measure of how closely the values of the distribution cluster about its mean is the
standard deviation, denoted by the Greek letter . If most of the values of the random variable are
close to the mean, the standard deviation is small. On the other hand, if it is likely that the values
are widely scattered about the mean, the standard deviation is large.

Locate the mean and one standard deviation on the graph.
Solution
Because the mean is an input value for this continuous function, 
is located on the hori-
zontal axis. The standard deviation describes how the math scores are spread out around the mean.
One standard deviation to the right of the mean would be 
points,
and one standard deviation to the left of the mean is 
points. See

Calculus in Probability (Part 2)
The uniform density function, the exponential density function, and the normal density functions
are commonly used probability density functions. A cumulative distribution function is used to
describe the likelihood that a specific outcome is less than some specific value.
Three Common PDFs
The uniform density function provides a good model for random variables whose values are
equally likely over an interval. A function describing the likelihood that the tip of a spinner lands
on one of 64 equally likely numbers on a circular dial would be a uniform density function.

Example 1
Using a Uniform Density Function
Airport Parking Lot Shuttle
Shuttles that transport passengers from the terminal to a long-tem parking lot at a busy airport
arrive at the terminal every 30 minutes between 6:30 A.M. and 8:30 P.M. If t is the number of min-
utes before the next shuttle arrives at the terminal, the distribution of waiting times is modeled by
a uniform density function.
a. Write the equation of the density function.
b. Explain, in the context of this situation, why it makes sense for the density function to be
0 when 
or 
.
c. Calculate and interpret 
. Shade on a graph of the density function the region
whose area is this value.
Solution
a. The uniform density function for the waiting times is
b. If shuttles arrive every 30 minutes at the terminal, no one will have to wait more than
30 minutes. Because time cannot be negative, the probability is zero for

c.
is the area of a rectangle with width 10 and height , so the area is . The
chance that a passenger waiting outside the terminal will have to wait at least 5 minutes but
no more than 15 minutes for the next parking lot shuttle is or approximately 33%. A graph
of s with the shaded region whose area is 
is shown in Figure 6.56.
For some events, the differences between any two occurrences of an event are likely to be
small. As an example, consider the amount of time a person spends waiting for service at a bank
teller’s window. Generally, the wait time falls within a given range with only a few instances of a
much longer wait. A situation describing the likelihood of encountering an out-of-the-ordinary
wait can be modeled by an exponential density function.

Suppose a college student arrives at the drive-through window of his favorite fast-food
establishment sometime between 2:00 P.M. and 2:30 P.M. During the post-lunch rush, the
time he has to wait for service at the window is an exponential random variable with a
mean of 2.5 minutes.
This means that there are 2.5 minutes between cars coming into the line, with cars arriv-
ing at the rate of

There is an 81.9% chance that the time between successive arrivals will be more than
1 minute. This event is likely to occur.
The normal density function is possibly the most well known density function. The value of the
mean determines the location of the midpoint of a normal curve, and the standard deviation of
the normal curve determines the relative narrowness or width of the graph of the function.

The chance that any one of these light bulbs will last between 900 and 1000 hours is
approximately 34%.
Cumulative Distribution Functions
A function that shows how probabilities accumulate as the value of the random variable increases
is called a cumulative distribution function.
Cumulative distribution functions exhibit the following behavior.
•
The left end behavior of any cumulative distribution function will be 0, corresponding to
impossible events.
•
The right end behavior of any cumulative distribution function will be 1, corresponding to
sure events.
•
Cumulative distribution functions are always nondecreasing.
•
The outputs of a cumulative distribution function are areas defined using the associated
probability density function and the horizontal axis.

Example 4
Calculating Probabilities by Using a Cumulative
Distribution Function
Temperature
Figure 6.63 shows the cumulative distribution function for the distribution of tempera-
tures in a southwestern city during a 24-hour period in May. The random variable x mea-
sures the temperature recorded in degrees Fahrenheit (beginning at midnight), and the
output T(x) is the proportion of the time the temperature is less than or equal to x°F.
a. What proportion of the time is the temperature expected to be at most 80°F?
Interpret this result in a probability context.
b. Estimate the high and low temperatures.
c. Estimate the probability that the temperature will be above 90°F.
d. Sketch a graph of the probability density function for the distribution of May
temperatures in this location.
Solution
a. The proportion of the time the temperature will be at most 80°F is 
During any 24-hour period in May in a certain southwestern city, the temperature will be less
than or equal to 80°F approximately 40% of the time.
b. T(x) appears to equal 0 at approximately 74°F. Because T is a proportion, it cannot be
negative. Thus, the cumulative proportion to the left of 74°F must also be 0, and the
minimum temperature is 74°F. The cumulative probability has a maximum of 1 at a
temperature of approximately 98°F, so the maximum temperature is approximately 98°F.
c. The temperature on any day must be either less than 90°F or greater than or equal to 90°F.
Thus, the probability that the temperature is less than 90°F added to the probability that the
temperature is 90°F or greater must equal 1:
d. The probability density function is the slope function of the cumulative distribution
function. Because the graph of T is always increasing for temperatures between 74°F and
98°F, its slope graph is positive over this interval. (Recall that no output of a density function
is ever negative.) The graph of T appears to have an inflection point located at approximately
87°F, so there is a minimum on the slope graph at this temperature.

Using 74°F as the minimum temperature and 98°F as the maximum temperature, it follows

SAT Scores
For all test dates on or after April 1, 1995,
the SAT reasoning test scores have been reported on a
new, re-centered scale. Over the years, the average score
on the math portion of the SAT moved away from 500,
the midpoint of the original 200-to-800 scale. This 1995
re-centering reestablished the average score near the mid-
point of the scale and realigned the verbal and math scores
so that a student with a score of 450 on each test can con-
clude that his or her math and verbal scores are equal. The
previous scales showed the average verbal score to be
approximately 425 and the average math score to
be approximately 475, which made comparison between
the two difficult.

Differential Equations—Slope Fields and
Solutions
Many of the models in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 use equations to express the rate of change of a
function in terms of the input of that function. Equations that involve rates of change (derivatives)
are called differential equations. Like the rate of change functions discussed earlier in Chapter 5
and Chapter 6, differential equations can often be solved using the techniques of integration
(recovering a function).
Differential Equations
Some differential equations that appeared in rate-of-change models in Chapter 5 are
•
mph describes a vehicle’s speed x hours after leaving Phoenix.
•
thousand people per year describes the rate of change of the popula-
tion of Cleveland x years since the end of 1900.
•
aircraft per thousand employees describes the rate of change of pro-
duction where x is the number of plant employees.
Other differential equations are more complicated because the derivative is written in terms of not
only the input variable x but also of the output variable y of the recovered function:
•
billion dollars per year represents the rate of change of the GNP of a certain
country x years after 2000.

•
thousand cases per month describes the rate of change of the 
number of diagnosed cases where m is the number of months after the beginning of an 
epidemic.
Slope Fields
One way to represent a differential equation graphically is with a slope field. A slope field is a grid
on a portion of the x-y plane where each point on the grid is represented by a short line segment
whose slope is determined by the differential equation.
Figure 6.65 shows a slope field for the differential equation 
on a plane where
and 
.
At the point 
, the slope is 
, and at 
, the slope is
.
Similarly, the slope of each small line segment in Figure 6.65 is the derivative expression eval-
uated at that point.
A solution (a function y that can be recovered from the differential equation) can be sketched
by following the line segments in such a way that the solution curve is tangent to each of the
segments it meets. Figure 6.66 shows the graph of one particular solution for 
. Of
course, as Figure 6.67 illustrates for 
, there is an entire family of solutions for any dif-
ferential equation.

Solutions of Differential Equations
A function f with input x and output y is referred to as a general solution of a differential equation
if

Differential Equations and Their Solutions
A differential equation is an equation involving one or more derivatives.
A general solution for a differential equation is a family of functions with deriva-
tives that satisfy the differential equation.
A particular solution for a differential equation is the function that satisfies a
certain set of initial conditions and has a derivative that satisfies the differential
equation.
Antiderivative Terminology
For the differential equations (rate-of-change functions) in Chapter 5 a general antideriv-
ative is a general solution and a specific antiderivative is a particular solution.  
A particular solution on a slope field is the one curve (out of the family of curves) that passes
through the specified point (initial condition). Figure 6.68 through Figure 6.70 show a slope field
with three particular solutions. On each figure, the particular solutions are for the initial condi-
tions

, and

When differential equations give the rate of change of a function in terms of both the
input and output of that function, the differential equation cannot be solved directly by
recovering an antiderivative function. Other techniques must be used to solve such differ-
ential equations.
A separable differential equation is a differential equation that can be written as
where f is a function of y and g is a function x. A solution technique involving the
concept of differentials is used to solve such equations.
So far in this text, the notation 
has been treated as a single symbol denoting the rate of
change of y with respect to x. The symbols dy and dx can be considered as separate variables.
When 
, the variables dy and dx are defined as 
. When dy and dx are
considered as separate variables in this way, they are referred to as differentials.
Separation of Variables
To solve a separable differential equation, move all expressions containing y to one side of the
equation and all expressions involving x to the other side of the equation. This procedure is
known as separation of variables.

Stimulus Response
The following differential equation describes a person’s perception of the inten-
sity of sound
where the sound s is measured in decibels and intensity R is measured on a scale from
0 to 10, with 0 representing inaudible sound and 10 representing painfully intense
sound. Figure 6.73 shows a slope field for this differential equation.

Euler’s Method
There are differential equations that cannot be solved (or are difficult to solve) using the methods
discussed. In these cases, it is possible to analyze the differential equation by using a numerical
method. One method used for such an analysis is called Euler’s method.
Euler’s method relies on the use of the derivative function to approximate the change in the
quantity function. Using local linearization, if a point 
on a function f as well as the slope,
, at that point are known, the value of the function at a close point 
can be approxi-
mated as 
.
Because local linearization works better over shorter intervals, Euler’s method breaks down the
input interval from a to b into subintervals of equal width and estimates the function value at the
end of each subinterval. This estimated function value is then used along with the known slope
value to estimate the function value for the next subinterval.

Leonhard Euler (pronounced
“oiler,” 1707–1783) was a Swiss
mathematician. One of his posi-
tions was as tutor to Frederick the
Great’s niece, the Princess of
Anhalt-Dessau, to whom Euler
wrote over 200 letters containing
essays pertaining to physics and
mathematics.
Euler’s Method
Given an equation for 
, the rate of change of a function f with respect to x, and a
starting point 
, an estimate for the function value 
at 
can be found as
follows.
• Subdivide the interval from a to b into n subintervals of length 
• Estimate the function value 
at the end of the ith subinterval as
. Use 
to begin. Repeat these
estimates until reaching an estimate for f at 
.

where t is the number of years after the product was introduced. At the end of the first year, sales
totaled $53.2 billion. Use Euler’s method with sixteen subintervals (steps) of size 0.25 year to esti-
mate the total sales at the end of the fifth year.
Solution
The starting point (the total sales at the end of the first year) is given as (1, 53.2). The rate of
change at the end of the first year is 
The first step gives an estimate for

puter product will be $73.6 billion at the end of the fifth year. A graph (Figure 6.74) of the Euler
estimates is an approximation of a graph of total sales and shows us that as time increases, the
increase in total sales begins to slow.

Technetium-99 Radioisotope
Technetium-99 is a
radioisotope that has been used in humans to help doctors
locate possible malignant tumors. Radioisotopes decay

Differential Equations—Proportionality and
Common Forms
Six general functions (linear, exponential, logarithmic, quadratic, logistic, cubic, and sine) have been
used to describe and analyze change in different situations. In this section, the underlying rates of
change that give rise to these six general functions are considered.
Proportionality
The idea of proportionality is often used in setting up equations. A variable y is directly proportional
to another variable x if there is a constant k such that 
. The constant k is referred to as the con-
stant of proportionality. The terms proportional and directly proportional are used interchangeably.
y  kx
Direct Proportionality
For a relation with input variable x and output variable y, y is directly proportional to
x if some constant k exists such that 
. The constant k is called the constant of
proportionality. 
y  kx
Quick Example
If 
dollars represents the amount it costs to purchase t tickets to a concert,
the cost is directly proportional to the number of tickets purchased. In this case, 23.50 is
the constant of proportionality.
A(t)  23.50t
Quick Example
Three representations of the same differential
equation are
Verbally: A certain function f with input x has
a rate of change that is directly proportional to
its input. The constant of proportionality for
this rate of change is 2.

centage rate of change (i.e., 7% or 0.07). Figure 6.77 shows a slope field of future
value with respect to time.
a. Write a differential equation expressing the rate of change of the amount in the
account with respect to time.
b. Find a general solution for this differential equation.
c. If the amount after 3 years is $1000, find the particular solution.
Solution
a. The rate of change of F, the future value in dollars in the account at time t, can be
expressed as the differential equation
after t years.
b. Separation of variables is used to solve this equation:
H I N T  6 . 1 2
Replacing the constant 
with the constant a gives the general solution
after t years.
c.
Because the amount after 3 years is $1000, the particular solution is found by
substituting 
and 
into the general solution and solving for a.
The particular solution is
after t years. This solution can also be written in the form
after t years. Figure 6.78 shows this particular solution.
Inverse Proportionality
Another type of proportionality occurs when a quantity y is related to a quantity x by
the equation 
, where k is a constant. In this case, y is said to be inversely pro-
portional to x.

Second-Order Differential Equations
Some differential equations involve the second derivative of a function. These differential equa-
tions are referred to as second-order differential equations, and they indicate the rate at which
the rate of change is changing.
Some second-order differential equations can be solved by applying the techniques of inte-
gration or separation of variables twice.
Differential Equations of Functions used in Modeling
Most of the models used in this text are easily derived from differential equations. The logistic and
sine models also have differential equations describing them even though they are not as easily
obtained directly from their differential equations. The following box shows the differental equation
forms that correlate to the model forms presented in Chapter 1.

followed the general principle that the rate of spread is jointly proportional to the number of
infected people and to the number of uninfected people. Also assume that the carrying
capacity for polio in the United States in 1949 was approximately 43,000 people.

Motion Laws

released, it oscillates according to two laws of physics:
Hooke’s law and Newton’s second law. These two laws
combine to form the following differential equation in the
case of free, undamped oscillation:
where m is the mass of an object attached to the spring, x
is the distance the spring is stretched beyond its standard
length with the object attached (its equilibrium point), t is
time, and k is a constant associated with the strength of the
spring. Consider a spring with

a 30-pound weight. The spring with the weight attached
stretches to its equilibrium point. The spring is then pulled
2 feet farther than its equilibrium and released.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 
Improper Integrals
Improper integrals of the forms 
, 
, and 
can be evaluated by substituting a constant for each infinity sym-
bol, finding an antiderivative, and evaluating it to determine an
expression in terms of x and the constant(s) and then determining
the limit of the resulting expression as the constant approaches
infinity or negative infinity. If the limit does not exist, the integral
diverges.
Streams in Business and Biology
An income stream is a flow of money into an interest-bearing
account over a period of time. If the stream flows continuously
into an account at a rate of R(t) dollars per year and the account
earns annual interest at the rate of 100r% compounded continu-
ously, then the future value of the account at the end of T years is

Integrals in Economics
A demand curve and a supply curve for a commodity are
determined by economic factors. The interaction between
supply and demand usually determines the quantity of an
item that is available. Areas of special interest that are deter-
mined as areas associated with supply and demand curves
are consumers’ expenditure, consumers’ surplus, consumers’
willingness and ability to spend, producers’ willingness and
ability to receive, producers’ surplus, producers’ revenue, and
total social gain.
Probability Distributions and Density
Functions
The probability 
is a measure of the likelihood that
an outcome of an experiment involving a random quantity x will
lie between a and b. Functions that describe how the probabili-
ties associated with a continuous random variable are distributed
over various intervals of numbers are called probability density
functions.
Integrals of a probability density function f have the following
meanings.
•
The likelihood that x is between a and b is
P(a  x  b) 
b
a
f (x)dx
P(a  x  b)
•
A measure of the center of the distribution is the mean
•
A measure of the spread of the distribution is the standard
deviation
Three types of probability distributions that show up often in
real-world applications are the uniform density function, the
exponential density function, and the normal distribution.
A cumulative distribution function is an accumulation func-
tion of a probability density function. Outputs of cumulative
distribution functions are the areas between the corresponding
probability density functions and the horizontal axis.
Probabilities can be determined by using either probability
density functions or cumulative distribution functions.

Plutonium Decay

isotope of plutonium that was often used as the power
supply in cardiac pacemakers. One gram of Pu-238 gener-
ates approximately 0.5 watts of power. Suppose that 2 grams
of the isotope were inserted into the pacemaker battery as a
sealed source in the patient to provide power to the pace-
maker. The rate at which Pu-238 decays can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since the 2 grams began
decaying. (Source: Based on data at www.iem-inc.com/
prhlfr.html)

Oracle
Information technology company Oracle bought
computer server and software maker Sun Microsystems on
April 20, 2009. (Source: Based on information in USA
Today Online, 4/20/2009)
a. Oracle estimated that Sun Microsystems will contribute
at least $1.5 billion to Oracle’s profit in the first year
and about $2 billion in the second and following years.
If this profit can be continuously reinvested at an annu-
al rate of return of 5%, what would Oracle consider to
be the 10-year present value of Sun Microsystems at the
time of the buyout?
b. If Oracle’s forecast for its financial future was that its
$1.891 billion annual revenue would remain constant
and that revenues could be continuously reinvested at
an annual return of 6%, what would Oracle consider its
15-year present value to be at the time of the buyout?
(Source: www.oracle.com)
c. Oracle bought Sun Microsystems in a cash deal valued
at $7.4 billion. If the sale price was the 15-year present
value, did either of the companies have to compromise
on what it believed to be the value of Sun Microsystems?

Brazilian Rainforests
In the year 2000, 58%
(4,932,130 sq km) of Brazil was covered by rainforests.
Many acres of rainforest have been destroyed each year (at
a rate of 8% per year) due to logging, agriculture use,
grazing land for cattle, road construction, and so on.
Damaged ecosystems are being renewed at a rate of
approximately 5,000 sq km per year by planting trees on
land where forests have been cut down. How much of
Brazil’s land will be covered by rainforests in 2025?

Competition is a fundamental element of a free-market society. Although many
factors affect sales of competing products, the most obvious factor is the price of
the product. If side-by-side vending machines sell competitive products, and if
sales data are collected and modeled as a function of the two prices, the model can
be used to answer questions such as
•
If one of the competitors lowers the price, what change can the other company
expect in sales? (Section 7.2, Activities 9 and 10)
•
How quickly are sales changing for two given prices? (Section 7.3, Activity 26)
•
If the price for one product decreases, how should the producer of the other
product respond to maintain its current sales level? (Section 7.4, Opening

Multivariable Functions and Contour Graphs

CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The mathematics of change for functions of a single input variable was discussed in Chapter 1
through Chapter 6 of this text. The mathematics of change for multivariable functions is pre-
sented in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8. A multivariable function is a function with two or more input
variables.
Graphs of functions with two input variables are three-dimensional and represent surfaces in
space. The two-dimensional contour graphs that are related to three-dimensional surfaces can be
used to enhance the graphical representation.
Change in a multivariable function can be analyzed using the rate of change with respect to
any one of the input variables.  
7.1
Multivariable Functions and Contour Graphs
Many of the functions that describe everyday situations are multivariable functions. These are
functions with a single output variable that depends on two or more input variables. For example,
a manufacturer’s profit depends on several variables, including sales, market price, and costs. The
volume of a tree is a function of its height and diameter. Crop yield is a function of variables such
as temperature, rainfall, and amount of fertilizer.
Representations of Multivariable Functions
A familiar example of a multivariable function is the value of an investment.
Verbally: The future value of a lump-sum investment depends on the rate of interest, the com-
pounding period, the term (length of time), and the principal (amount borrowed or invested).

Algebraically: The future value at time t in years of a lump-sum investment with a present
value of P dollars is calculated as
where n is the number of compoundings per year and r is the nominal rate of interest.
Graphically: The future value of $10,000 with quarterly compounding of interest is repre-
sented as contour curves in Figure 7.1 or a three-dimensional graph in Figure 7.2:

Multivariable Function
A rule f that relates one output variable to several input variables 
is called
a multivariable function if for each input 
there is exactly one output
.
f (x1, x2, x3, ... , xn)
(x1, x2, x3, ... , xn)
x1, x2, x3, ... , xn
If the function F is modeling the
future value of an investment, the
input/output diagram would con-
tain the units of measure as in
Figure 7.4. The variables r and n
represent unitless quantities.
When some of the input variables in a multivariable function are held constant, the function
can be rewritten with those constants substituted for the variables. For instance, the future value
of an investment of $10,000 compounded quarterly (as given in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.1 and
Figure 7.2) is given by

or as a model with two input variables:
where r is the nominal rate of interest and t is the term in years.
Function Output—Algebraically and Numerically
As with single-input functions, a method for finding the output that corresponds to a known
input depends on the way the function is represented.
Algebraically: For a function represented by an equation, substitution and calculation yield the
output.
For example, the future value of $10,000 after 17 years at a 5% nominal interest compounded
quarterly is
Numerically: For a function represented by a table of data, locate the input values in the top
row and left column. The entry where the corresponding column and row intersect is the out-
put value.
For example, in Table 7.2, the output corresponding to input (6, 5) is 320, and we write

Figure 7.5 is similar to a topographical map, a two-dimensional map that shows terrain by
outlining different elevations. Each curve on a topographical map represents a constantelevation
and is known as a contour curve. In general, a contour curve for a function with two input variables
is the collection of all points 
for which 
, where K is a constant. The contour curve
for a specific value of K is sometimes referred to as the K-contour curve or a level curve.

Contour Curves and Graphs
A contour curve for a three-dimensional function is the collection of all points 
for
which 
, where K is a constant.
A contour curve is the two-dimensional outline of a three-dimensional graph at a given
output level.
A contour graph is a graph of contour curves 
for more than one value of K.
Usually, the values of K are evenly spaced.  
f (x, y)  K
f(x, y)  K

When multiple contour curves appear together, the graph is referred to as a contour graph.

Quick Example
Figure 7.11 shows a three-dimensional graph of a function v with input variables s and t.
In Figure 7.12, a plane at height 4 cutting through this function contains the outline of
the 4-contour curve of v. In Figure 7.12 and  Figure 7.13, the level-4 contour is not

Land elevation can be found
through various surveying meth-
ods. From these surveys, tables
of elevation data, contour graphs,
and even three-dimensional
graphs can be formed.
The Missouri farm data is a
smoothed estimate of a field
owned by the grandparents of
one of the authors.
The contour curves for various elevations form a topographical map, or contour graph (as in
Figure 7.14). Figure 7.15 shows a three-dimensional graph corresponding to these contours.

Monthly Payments M(t, P) (on a loan) at 7% nominal interest
compounded monthly

Solution
a. The value that is in both the column for 
and the row for 
is
.
The monthly payment is $449.41 on a $50,000, 15-year mortgage when the rate is fixed at 7%.
b. The points on the $520 contour curve represent the different options. For instance, a buyer
who wants to pay off a mortgage within 12 years at 7% can apply for a loan of approximately
$50,000. If a buyer wants a 20-year mortgage with a $520 monthly payment, then the
amount borrowed can be between $65,000 and $70,000. Similarly, if the buyer is willing to
pay on the mortgage for 30 years, a mortgage slightly larger than $75,000 can be obtained.
c. If the loan period increases and the buyer wishes to remain on the contour curve (thus
keeping the monthly payment constant), the mortgage amount also increases.
Function Output—Graphically
Figure 7.16 and Figure 7.17 show a three-dimensional representation and a contour graph of
the function M giving the monthly payment amount (in dollars) necessary to pay off a loan of
P thousand dollars over t years with nominal interest fixed at 7%. The same point C is depicted
in each figure.

Three-dimensional graph (input estimates): To estimate the input values of a point on a three-
dimensional graph, it is necessary to follow the surface of the graph to each of the input axes.
The point C has approximate input values of 
and 
.
Three-dimensional graph (output estimates): Estimating an output value on a three-dimensional
graph is not as accurate as estimation using a contour graph.
Contour graph (input and output estimates): Estimating input on a contour graph is the same
as estimating point coordinates on any two-dimensional graph. Estimating the output value
involves comparing the location of the point to the nearest contour curves.
The point C in Figure 7.17 occurs at input (15, 75). Because C is located slightly below the
$680 contour curve and is on the side closer to the $600 contour curve, the output of C is esti-
mated to be a little less than $680. The monthly payment on a loan of $75,000 with a term of 15
years at a fixed interest of 7% is approximately $675.
Change and Percentage Change in Output
As with single-variable functions, change and percentage change are used as measures of the differ-
ence in output values of a multivariable function.

Estimating Change and Percentage Change in Output,
Using a Contour Graph
Mortgage Payments
Figure 7.18 shows a contour graph of the function M giving the monthly payment (in dollars)
necessary to pay off a mortgage of P thousand dollars over t years at nominal interest of 7%.
Figure 7.18
a. What is the change in the monthly payment on a $55,000 mortgage when the length of the
mortgage is increased from 15 years to 25 years? What is the percentage change in the monthly
payment?
b. What is the change in the monthly payment on a $75,000 mortgage when the length of the
mortgage is increased from 15 years to 25 years? What is the percentage change in the monthly
payment?
Solution
a. Locate the input points 
and 
on the contour graph of M. (See Figure 7.19;
Figure 7.20 is included for reference.) Because M(15, 55) is between the $520 and $440
contour curves but is closer to the $520 contour,

Because M(25, 55) is between the $360 and $440 contours but is closer to the $360
contour, 
.
So
and
When the term of a $55,000 mortgage is increased from 15 years to 25 years, the monthly
payment decreases by approximately $100—a decrease of approximately 20.4%.
b. Estimating from Figure 7.19, 
and 
. The change is
approximately –145 dollars, which represents a 21.5% decrease in monthly payment.
Direction and Steepness
If the input variables of a multivariable function can be compared, the idea of steeper descent can
be discussed. When the constants K used for the K-contour curves are equally spaced, the
steepness of the three-dimensional graph at different points (or in different directions) can
be compared by noting the closeness (frequency) of the contour curves. If the contour curves are
close together near a point, the surface is steeper in that region than in a portion of the graph
where the contour curves are spaced farther apart.

Figure 7.21 shows a contour graph for a function
M giving the monthly payment on a loan at 7%
nominal interest. The points 
and 
depict
monthly payments on two loans.
Comparing the effect on monthly payment
of increasing the term by 5 years on each of these
two loans is the same as comparing the steepness
of the three-dimensional function M as t
increases away from these two points.
The monthly payment amount will decrease
more quickly when term is increased for point
than it will for 
. The graph of M is steeper
in the t direction at

b. Starting at (1.0, 0.6), which direction results in the steeper descent: east 0.4 mile or north
0.4 mile? Explain.
Solution
a. Refer to Figure 7.22. E (0.4, 1.0) is between 799 and 800 feet above sea level. Walking 0.4
mile north takes the hiker to (0.4, 1.4), which is approximately 798 feet above sea level. He
walked downhill.
Walking 0.4 mile south from (0.4, 1.0) takes the hiker to (0.4, 0.6). E(0.4, 0.6) is
approximately 800 feet above sea level, so the hiker has walked slightly uphill.
Walking 0.4 mile east takes him to (0.8, 1.0). E(0.8, 1.0) is slightly more than 799 feet above
sea level. The difference might be too small to notice.
Heading west, the hiker will walk uphill to just over 802 feet above sea level.
b. Before looking for the steeper descent, we compare the units. Because both input units are
miles, we can compare steepness. Moving 0.4 mile east from (1.0, 0.6) to (1.4, 0.6) results in
a descent of three feet from 800 feet to 797 feet, whereas moving north 0.4 mile results in a
descent of less than one foot. Moving east 0.4 mile results in a steeper descent than does
moving 0.4 mile to the north.
Contour Graphs for Functions on Two Variables
Data tables do not show every possible value for the input and output values of a multivariable
function. When sketching contour curves on tables, assume that the multivariable function is
continuous over the entire input intervals and that the contour curve will be continuous and
relatively smooth.
(0.4, 1.0)
There are two ways to determine
the direction of steeper descent
or ascent. If the scales on the
horizontal and vertical axes are
the same, look for the direction in
which the contours are closest
together.
A more deliberate approach is to
move the same distance in each
direction. Determine the direction
of steeper descent or ascent by
comparing the change in output
in each direction.

Quick Example
Table 7.5 does not contain any output
values that are exactly 2000; however, a
2000-contour curve can be sketched to
divide the output values that are above
2000 from the output values that are
below 2000.

When a multivariable function is given, the exact points on a particular contour curve can be
determined. Plotting these points can aid in accurately sketching the contour.

Heat Loss
Heat loss due to wind speed and temperature is modeled by the Siple–Passel function
where wind speed is v mps (meters per second) and air temperature is tC.
A three-dimensional graph of H is shown in Figure 7.23. The Siple–Passle function was for-
mulated to measure heat loss over a square meter of body surface each hour.

Paul Siple and Charles Passel
were two Americans who
accompanied Admiral Byrd to the
Antarctic and were among the first
researchers to measure loss of
body heat due to the wind. Until
2001, the Siple–Passel heat-loss
function was the basis of wind-
chill calculations.

Formulas for Contour Curves 
Often it is helpful to be able to sketch a contour graph showing several contours. In this case, it is
beneficial to find a contour-curve formula expressing one input variable in terms of the other
input variable and the output variable.

Honey Adhesiveness
The ability of honey to attach to
the surface on which it is spread is called adhesiveness. The
adhesiveness of honey relies on several factors: the percent-
age of sugars (glucose and maltose), the percentage of
moisture, the percentage of crystallization in the honey,
and the number of days the honey is allowed to set at 12C.
The figures show a measure of the adhesiveness of honey
given the percentage of moisture and the number of days
the honey is allowed to set at 12oC when 40.9% of the
honey is sugar and 12.5% of the honey was crystallized
before setting began.

of daylight for a given month at a given latitude (measured
10F
in degrees away from the equator) for the northern and
southern hemispheres.
a. How many hours of daylight will there be at a location
at latitude 25 north in March?
b. How many hours of daylight will there be at a location
at latitude 25 south in September?
c. How many hours of daylight will there be in January in
the region where you attend school?
d. Draw contour curves representing 8, 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 hours of daylight.

Price Index
In 1986, Cotterill developed a model for
measuring the performance of supermarkets by considering
their price index level. The price index level was an aggre-
gate of 121 representative prices. The lowest-price super-
market was assigned a price index of 100. According to the
Cotterill study, the price index level of an independent
supermarket can be modeled as
where the supermarket has s thousand square feet of sales
space and is d miles from the warehouse, and the consumer
base grew by p thousand people in 10 years and had a per
capita income of c thousand dollars. Assume that the
distance from a supermarket to its distribution warehouse
is 100 miles and that the consumer base grew by 10,000
people in 10 years.

Agricultural Prices, Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1996)

especially when one is trying to determine the number
of boards a tree will yield. In 1973, Brackett developed
the following model for predicting the total-stem
(inside bark) volume for Douglas fir trees in British
Columbia:
where d is the diameter of the tree at breast height (4.5 feet
above the ground), which is denoted by dbh and measured
in inches, and h is the height of the tree in feet. 
(Source: J. L. Clutter et al., Timber Management: A Quantitative
Approach, New York: Wiley, 1983)
a. Find the stem volume of a Douglas fir with a dbh of
1 foot and a height of 32 feet.
b. Draw a contour curve representing the volume found in
part a for dbh(s) between 8 inches and 18 inches.
c. Explain how a change in dbh affects height if volume
remains constant.
31.
Body Mass
Body-mass index (BMI) is an indicator of
fatness. It is calculated as a proportion of weight divided
by height squared. The table shows BMI values for
people between 5 and 6 feet tall who weigh between
90 and 200 pounds. Body-mass index is calculated by
the equation
where h is the person’s height in inches and w is the per-
son’s weight in pounds.

  thousand passengers
where p is the yearly average airfare (in dollars) between
New York City and London, adjusted for inflation, and g
is the U.S. yearly gross national product (in billions of
dollars), adjusted for inflation. The table shows selected
values of this function.

Cross-Sectional Models and Rates of Change
Cross-sectional modeling is a simple extension of the data-modeling techniques from Chapter 1.
Cross sections can be used to understand the behavior of data sets having two input variables.
Illustration of Cross Sections
The number of jobs held by the average American depends on several variables, including his or
her age and level of education, as shown in Table 7.6.

years represents completion of bachelor’s degree.
(Source: Based on data for 1987 through 2006 in U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics)
The cross section of the population who received high school diplomas but did not have post-
high-school education is represented by the row of data with 4 years of education (highlighted in
Table 7.6). The number of jobs held between the age of 18 and a given age t by someone with
only a high school education can be modeled as
An average 24-year-old American from this educational cross section (someone with only a
high school education), has held approximately 5 jobs 
. The number of jobs a
24-year-old with only a high-school education has held is changing by 0.318 jobs per year as that
person ages 
.
Cross Sections from Three Perspectives
A cross section of a multivariable function is a relation with one less dimension (variable) than the
original multivariable function.
Graphically: For a function with two input variables, a cross section is the curve that results
when a three-dimensional graph of the function is intersected by a plane. Figure 7.27 shows a
function f with two input variables x and y intersected by the plane at 
. In Figure 7.28,
the plane appears as a line at 
that intersects the 100-, 200-, and 300-level curves on the
same function f.
The cross section that results from the intersection depicted in Figures 7.27 and 7.28 can be
seen as a curve in the 
plane in Figure 7.29. This cross-sectional curve can be thought of as
the outline of the multivariable function drawn on the plane. (Points marked in Figure 7.29 cor-
respond with the contour curves drawn in Figure 7.28.)

Different cross-sectional curves do not have to be the same shape. Although a cross section
of f with x held constant at 7 and y allowed to vary  appears to be a parabola, a cross section of
f with y held constant at 6 and x allowed to vary appears to be cubic. Figures 7.30 through 7.32

Numerically: A simple cross section on a table of data is represented by one row or column of
the data. Table 7.6 illustrates a cross section represented by a row of data, and Table 7.7 illus-
trates a cross section represented by a column of data. Figure 7.33 shows a scatter plot of the
cross section highlighted in Table 7.7.
Four years of education represents completion of high school and eight
years represents completion of bachelor’s degree.

Algebraically: When a function with two input variables is represented by an equation, a
simple cross section of the function is written by replacing one input variable with a constant and
then rewriting the equation for the output in terms of the remaining input variable.
Cross-Sectional Model
A cross-sectional model is a model of a subset of multivariable data obtained by hold-
ing all but one input variable constant and modeling the output variable with respect to
that one input variable.
Cross-Sectional Models from Data
When data is given in a table with two input variables and one output variable, modeling the data
in one row (or one column) results in a cross-sectional model.
H I N T  7 . 3
f ( x, 4)  27x2  18x
When output is based on multiple
input variables, it is possible to
model data by using a technique
called multiple regression. We will
not explore modeling multivariable
data in this text. We do investigate
cross-sectional models.
Quick Example
A cross-sectional model for the yield of
corn crops in Iowa, given temperature
when 17 mm of rain falls each month, is
found by modeling the highlighted column
of data in Table 7.8:
Temperature t is changing while rainfall r is
held constant at 17mm.
y(17, t)  1.878(1.062t)  bushels per acre

Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 2005)

a. Find a cross-sectional model for the number of people 65 years of age and older who were
without health coverage as a function of the number of years since 2001.
b. State which variable is allowed to change and which variable is forced to remain constant.
c. Explain why it does not make sense to find a cross-sectional model giving people lacking
health insurance as a function of age for a given year.
Solution
a. Aligning the years so that 2002 is 
and using the data in the bottom row of
Table 7.9 yields the following model:
The number of people 65 years old or older who were without health
coverage for the entire year can be modeled as
where t is the number of years since 2001.
Figure 7.34 shows a graph of this model along with a scatter plot of the data
from the bottom row of Table 7.9.
b. The year t is allowed to vary while age g remains constant.
c. Because age is not divided into equal subintervals, the numbers of uninsured
given for different age categories in a single year cannot be compared to each
other, and, therefore, a column cannot be used as a data set to model.

Rates of Change of Cross-Sectional Models
A cross-sectional model describes the behavior of a function as one input variable changes. That
cross-sectional model can be used to determine the rate of change occurring at a point with respect
to change in that same input variable.
For example, the cross-sectional model
gives the number of people 65 years old or older who were without health coverage for the entire
year t years since 2001. This model describes the behavior of the number of uninsured seniors
with respect to the year t.
The rate of change of this model with respect to the year t is
H I N T  7 . 4
where output is measured in million people per year and t is the number of years since 2001.

Table 7.10 Iowa Corn Crop Yield (bushels per
acre) given average monthly temperatures t and
average monthly rainfall r
a. Find the cross-sectional model needed to determine the rate of change of yield with respect to
temperature when average monthly rainfall is 17 mm.
b. Determine the rate of change of yield with respect to temperature when the rainfall is 17 mm
and the temperature is 73F. Write a sentence interpreting this rate of change in context.
c. Find the cross-sectional model needed to determine the rate of change of yield with respect to
rainfall when the average monthly temperature is 73F.
d. Determine the rate of change of yield with respect to rainfall when the rainfall is 17 mm and
the temperature is 73F. Write a sentence interpreting this rate of change in context.
Solution
a. Temperature is allowed to vary while rainfall is held constant at 17 mm. The column on
Table 7.10 (highlighted in Table 7.11) corresponding to 17 mm represents corn crop yield

Figure 7.37
Iowa corn crop yield can be modeled as
where r is the average monthly rainfall and the average monthly temperature is 73F.
Figure 7.37 shows the linear cross-sectional model of yield when 
.
d. The rate of change of yield with respect to rainfall when the temperature is 73F can be
found using the derivative of the cross-sectional equation 
:
where r is average monthly rainfall measured in millimeters.
When average monthly temperature is constant at 73F, the rate of change of corn crop
yield is constant at approximately 7.3 bushels per acre per millimeter for any amount of
rainfall. So in context:
When average temperature is 73F and monthly rainfall is 17 mm, corn crop yield is
decreasing by approximately 7.3 bushels per acre per millimeter.
The derivative of a cross section of a multivariable equation gives the rate of change only in
the cross-sectional plane with all other input quantities held constant.

Figure 7.36 shows this rate of change represented as the slope of a tangent line on a
graph of the cross-sectional model of y when

When rainfall is constant at 17 mm each month and temperature is 73F, corn
crop yield is increasing by approximately 9.0 bushels per acre per degree Fahrenheit.
c. Rainfall is allowed to vary while temperature is held constant at 73F. The row in

(the apparent temperature in degrees Fahrenheit) for certain air
temperatures and dew points. The dew point is the temperature to
which the air needs to be cooled to achieve a relative humidity of
100%. The higher the dew point, the greater the amount of moisture in
the air and the muggier it feels.

Partial Rates of Change
Derivatives of cross-sectional functions were discussed in Section 7.2. In Section 7.3, the discus-
sion of derivatives is expanded to include derivatives of multivariable functions. These partial
derivative functions give rate-of-change formulas for all simple cross sections of a multivariable
function.
Tangents to Cross-Sectional Functions
The revenue generated by the sale of certain Dutch cheeses can be modeled as
when x thousand tons of lower-fat (40% fat) cheese and y thousand tons of regular
cheese are sold. (See Figure 7.38.)

Approach to the Problem of the Optimal Use of Milk in the Netherlands,” Journal of Farm
Economics, vol. 45, no. 2 (May 1963), pp. 309–317. Note: Guilders reported in euro equivalent.)

Partial Derivatives
Derivatives describe change in the output value of a function caused when one input variable is
changing. Derivatives of multivariable function are called partial derivatives because they describe
change in only one input direction, so they give only a partial picture of change.
Partial Derivatives
For a multivariable function f with input 
the function giving the rate of
change of f with respect to x for each input 
is called the partial derivative of f
with respect to x.
The partial derivative of f with respect to x is written
(read “f sub x”) or
(read “del f del x”)
To express an input value or point at which the partial is evaluated, we write
∂f
∂x `
xa
    or    ∂f
∂x `
(x, y)(a, b)
∂f
∂x
fx
(x, y, z, ...)

A function with n input variables
has n partial derivative functions.

To simplify finding a partial
derivative, highlight the variable
that is changing.
The partial derivative 
is found by treating all input variables other than x as constants when
writing the derivative of f. The partial derivative of f is written as if f were a function of a single
input variable, using the derivative rules and operations given in Chapter 3.

Partial Derivatives as Multivariable Functions
Partial derivatives of a multivariable function can be used to find rates of change (with respect to
a particular input variable) at any point on the function.
Partial-derivative functions are multivariable functions with the same number of variables as
the original functions.
For example, the partial derivatives of
are
and
Second Partial Derivatives
A partial derivative of a partial-derivative function is called a second partial derivative. A function 
f with two input variables, x and y, has two partial derivatives, 
and 
, if they exist. 
If the partial derivatives 
and 
are also functions with two input variables, then each has two 
partial derivatives (if the second partial derivatives exist).

b. The rate of change of future value with respect to present value is given by 
. The rate by
which this rate of change is changing is given by 
which has been algebraically shown
to be zero.
Three cross-sections with respect to P are shown in Figure 7.41.  Each of the cross-
sections is linear.  For a particular cross section, as P increases, the slopes remain
constant (
). So as P increases, the rate at which the slopes are changing is
zero (
).
c. The rate of change of future value with respect to the term is given by , which for
any particular P is an exponential function of t. The rate of change of this rate
function with respect to the term is

lines drawn at

of the tangent lines are increasing as t increases and the P cross section of F is

Compensating for Change
When the output of a function depends on two input variables and must remain fixed at some
constant level, a change in one of the input variables must be compesnated for by a change in the
other input variable.  Tangent lines and partial derivatives are used to answer a questions dealing
with compensating for change.
Rates of Change in Three Directions
A rate of change of the output of a multivariable function with respect to one of the input vari-
ables can be found as a partial derivative of the function. It is also possible to determine the rate
of change of one of the input variables with respect to another input variable. For
functions on two input variables, such a rate of change is represented graphically as a
line tangent to a contour graph.
For example, Figure 7.46 shows the revenue generated by the sale of certain
Dutch cheeses. This revenue can be modeled as
when x thousand tons of lower-fat (40% fat) cheese and y thousand tons of regu-
lar cheese are sold. 
(Source: Simplified model based on S. Louwes, J. Boot, and S. Wage, “A Quadratic-Programming
Approach to the Problem of the Optimal Use of Milk in the Netherlands,” Journal of Farm
Economics, vol. 45, no. 2 (May 1963), pp. 309–317. Note: Guilders reported in euro equivalent.)
The point (22, 21, 70) is depicted in Figure 7.47 through Figure 7.49. Each figure

Ingredients of Multivariable Change: Models, Graphs, Rates

Figure 7.47 through Figure 7.49 (repeated in Figure 7.50 through Figure 7.52 for
ease of reference) show three views of graphs for the function R, given the revenue (in
million euros) generated by the sale of x thousand tons of lower-fat (40% fat) cheese
and y thousand tons of regular cheese. The partial rates of change depicted by the tan-
gent lines on these figures can be interpreted as follows.
• In Figure 7.50, y (regular cheese sales) is held constant while R (revenue) varies
according to variation in x (lower-fat cheese sales).
The slope of the line tangent to R with respect to x in the 
plane is 
.
When regular cheese sales remain constant at 21 thousand tons and lower-fat cheese
sales are at 22 thousand tons, revenue is decreasing by 0.8 million euros per thou-
sand tons of lower-fat cheese sold.
• In Figure 7.51, x (lower-fat cheese sales) is held constant while R (revenue) varies
according to variation in y (regular cheese sales).
The slope of the line tangent to R with respect to y in the 
plane is 
.
When lower-fat cheese sales remain constant at 22 thousand tons and regular cheese
sales are at 21 thousand tons, revenue is increasing by 1.0 million euros per thousand
tons of regular cheese sold.
• In Figure 7.52, R (revenue) is held constant at 70 million euros while y (regular
cheese sales) varies according to variation in x (lower-fat cheese sales).
The slope of the line tangent to y with respect to x in the 
plane (i.e., on the
70-contour curve) is 
.
When revenue remains constant at 70 million euros and lower-fat cheese sales are at
22 thousand tons, regular cheese sales are increasing by 0.8 thousand ton per thou-
sand tons of lower-fat cheese sold.
Lines Tangent to Contour Curves
On a function f with two input variables x and y, if the output is constant at level K, the
rate of change of one input variable with respect to the other input variable at a point on
the K-contour curve is the slope of the line (in the 
plane) tangent to the curve at
that point. Figure 7.53 shows a line tangent to a K-contour curve on a three-dimensional
graph of f. Figure 7.54 shows the same line depicted on a two-dimensional graph of the K-
contour of f.

One method of determining the rate of change of one input variable with respect to the other
input variable involves writing a function for the specific K-contour curve and then determining
the derivative of K-contour function.
Quick Example
For the function depicted in Figure 7.53 and Figure 7.54, when the function output
value remains constant at 140 and the input values are 
and 
, the value for y
is increasing by 1 y-unit per x-unit.

Finding the Equation of a Contour Curve to Determine
Slope
Mattress Manufacturing
The Cobb–Douglas monthly production function for a certain mattress manufacturing plant is
where x represents the number of worker hours (in thousands) and y represents the amount
invested in capital (in thousands of dollars).
a. Assuming that production remains constant at 3.96 thousand mattresses, write an equation
giving capital investment as a function of labor.
b. Determine the capital investment and the rate of change of capital investment with respect
to labor when labor is 10 thousand worker hours and production is 3.96 thousand
mattresses.
c. Write a sentence interpreting the results of part b.
Solution
a. Substituting 
into the Cobb–Douglas function produces the formula
relating only x and y. Solving this formula for y results in an equation expressing y in terms
of x:
H I N T  7 . 1 0
There is only one possible output y for any positive x, so y is a function of x.
b. The capital investment necessary for a production of 3.96 thousand mattresses when labor is
10 thousand worker hours is 
thousand dollars.
The rate of change of capital investment with respect to labor is 
. Evaluating this derivative

Approximating Change on a Contour Curve
Linear approximation (presented in Section 4.1) is the process of using points along a tangent line
to approximate points on a curve. When y can be considered as a function of x and x changes by
a small amount

The Slope of a Line Tangent to a Contour Curve
When the output of a function f with two input variables, x and y, is held constant at a
value c, the slope at any point on the contour curve 
(that is, the slope of a
line tangent to the c-contour curve) is given by
whenever

Compensation of Input Variables
The change needed in one input variable to compensate for a change in the other input variable
to maintain a constant function output is approximated using a line tangent to a contour curve.
The slope of the tangent line can be calculated either directly from an algebraic formula, giving
one input variable in terms of the other variable, or indirectly by using partial derivatives of the
function.  
The Slope at a Point on a Contour Curve
For a function f with input variables x and y, the slope of a line tangent to a constant contour level
can be computed using partial derivatives of f.

Body-mass index is a measure of how a person's weight compares to his or her height. A person’s
body-mass index is given by
where h is height in inches and w is weight in pounds.

Cost
The cost of having specialty T-shirts made depends
on the number of colors used in the T-shirt design and the
number of T-shirts being ordered. A function giving the
cost per T-shirt (the average cost) when c colors are used
and n T-shirts are ordered is
(Source: Based on data compiled from 1993 prices at Tigertown
Graphics, Inc., Clemson, SC)

ors. Use

by washing for 20 minutes can be modeled as
where r milliliters of tC water is used for each gram of
sunflower heads.

Stem Volume
In 1965, Honer developed a model for
the total-stem volume of red pine trees in Canada. His
model is
where d is the diameter of the tree at breast height (4.5 feet
above the ground), which is denoted by dbh and measured
in inches, and the tree is h feet tall. 
(Source: J. L. Clutter et al., Timber Management: A Quantitative
Approach, New York: Wiley, 1983)
a. Calculate the volume of a 40-foot tree with a 2-foot dbh
and sketch a contour curve corresponding to that volume.
b. On the contour curve, draw a line whose slope repre-
sents how quickly height is changing as dbh is chang-
ing if the volume does not change for a 40-foot tree
with a 2-foot dbh.
c. Assuming a constant volume, calculate the rate at which
height changes with respect to dbh for a 40-foot tree
with a 2-foot dbh.
d. A logging company wishes to cut only trees that have
a volume of at least 59 cubic feet. Use the answer to

CHAPTER SUMMARY
Multivariable Functions and Contour
Graphs
Multivariable functions refer to functions, where the output
depends on two or more input variables. A multivariable func-
tion with exactly two input variables is graphed as a surface in
three dimensions; it can also be graphed in two dimensions, using
contour curves to represent constant values of output.
Cross Sections of a Function on Two Input
Variables
A cross section of a function on two variables is obtained by hold-
ing one of the variables constant. Numerically, a cross section on a
table of data is represented by one row (or one column) of the data.
Geometrically, cross sections describe the curves that result when
cross-sectional planes intersect the three-dimensional graph of the
function. Algebraically, a cross section of a function on two vari-
ables when one variable is held constant at c can be written by sub-
stituting the number c for the variable in the function equation.
Partial Derivatives and Rates of Change
When a function f has two input variables, x and y, the function 
has two partial derivatives, 
and . A partial derivative is the
rate of change of the output with respect to a change in one input
variable. Partial derivatives are represented graphically as the
slopes of lines tangent to cross-sectional curves.
Compensating for Change
In situations when the output of a multivariable function is con-
stant, the adjustment needed in one input variable to compen-
sate for small changes in another input variable can be estimated
using the slope of a line tangent to the fixed contour curve.
Algebraically, for a function f with input variables x and y, the
change is represented by the approximation formula
The partial derivatives in this formula are evaluated at the point
from which the change occurs.

The housing market contains many examples of multivariable functions that either
have optimal points or can be optimized under certain constraints. Optimization
methods can be used to answer the following questions:
•
How far from shopping and how far from work should a housing subdivision be
situated in order to maximize buyer interest?
•
In order for a housing contractor to maximize profit, what percentage of projects
should be new builds and what percentage should be remodeling?
•
What combination of reduction in asking price and money invested in renovations
is most likely to minimize a house’s time on the market?

Extreme Points and Saddle Points
575
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION
The optimization techniques for functions with a single input variable readily generalize to
multivariable functions. In the same way that derivatives play an important role in determin-
ing critical points of a function with a single input variable, partial derivatives are used for
locating critical points of multivariable functions. Critical points of functions of two input
variables include maxima, minima, and saddle points.
Optimization techniques for functions with two input variables provides a way to fit models
to data. In Section 8.4, the least squares optimization method for finding a line of best fit is
discussed.
8.1
Extreme Points and Saddle Points
Single-variable functions can contain relative maxima and minima. Some multivariable functions
contain similar points—maxima, minima, and saddle points.
A Three-Dimensional Maximum
A simple illustration of a three-dimensional function with a maximum point is the adhesiveness of
honey. Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2 show the adhesiveness of honey as a function of the percentage of
moisture and the number of days the honey is allowed to set.

The honey is at its maximum adhesiveness when it has set for 12.8 days with 17.1% moisture.
See point A on Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2. The maximum adhesiveness measure is
7.1. (Adhesiveness is a unit-less measure.)
Relative Extreme Points and Saddle Points
Three-dimensional functions are similar to single-variable functions in that they may contain
relative extreme points.
I N  C O N T E X T
The ability of honey to attach to a
surface on which it is spread is
known as its adhesiveness.
For the function describing adhe-
siveness, the amount of glucose
and maltose in the honey is
40.9%, and the honey was 12.5%
crystallized before setting began.

Analyzing Multivariable Change: Optimization

Figure 8.5 and Figure 8.6 show functions with saddle points. Graphically, a three-dimensional
function with a saddle point resembles a saddle in the region around that point.
Relative Extrema on Contour Graphs
Figure 8.7 through Figure 8.10 illustrate contour graphs that correspond with relative extrema on
three-dimensional functions. On the contour graph of a continuous function, relative maximum
and minimum points lie within a simple closed contour (provided the contour graph is detailed
enough to show it).
Relative Extrema
The output value of a point on a three-dimensional graph is a relative minimum if it is
smaller than all of the output values around it and a relative maximum if it is larger than
all of the output values around it.
Figure 8.3 and Figure 8.4 show three-dimensional graphs with a relative maximum and a relative
minimum, respectively.

Saddle Point
A saddle point is a point that corresponds to a relative maximum of a cross section in
one direction (possibly diagonal to the input axes) and to a relative minimum of a cross
section in another (possibly diagonal) direction. See Figure 8.5.

Figure 8.17
A contour level that passes
through a saddle point will appear
as two lines (or curves) that inter-
sect at the saddle point, as in
Figure 8.15.
As Figure 8.18 through Figure 8.19 illustrate, contour levels increase as they approach the saddle
point from opposing directions along a diagonal cross section but decrease as they approach the
saddle point from opposing directions along an intersecting diagonal cross section.
N O T E
A diagonal cross section does not
necessarily have to run parallel to
either input axis.
Figure 8.12 shows three curves
that are not simple closed
contours.
As Figure 8.8 and Figure 8.10 illustrate, relative extreme points lie in the center of a group of con-
centric simple closed contours. Contour curve levels increase as they approach a maximum point
and decrease as they approach a minimum point.
Saddle Points on Contour Graphs
Figure 8.13 through Figure 8.17 show graphs of functions with saddle points. The contour
curves near the saddle point (but not through the saddle point) are all curved away from that
point.

The entries in the tables can be used as a guide for sketching contour curves. When the table is a
representation of a continuous function, contour curves sketched on the table give insight into
the behavior of the function and can be used to identify relative maximum or minimum points.

I N  C O N T E X T
To receive bound printed–matter rates from
the U.S. Postal Service, items mailed must
consist of advertising, promotional, directory,
or editorial material. The maximum weight for
bound printed matter is 15 pounds. Rates are
based on weight, shape, and distance.
The maximum allowable size is 108 inches
in combined length and girth (distance
around the thickest part of the package).

b. The contour graph on Table 8.2 indicates only one relative extreme point—near
. Because this point lies within concentric closed contours whose levels
increase as they approach the point, the point is the approximate location of a relative
maximum.
Sketching of contours on tables makes it possible to identify saddle points.

Locating Saddle Points by Sketching Contour Curves
TV News Ratings
Table 8.5 shows the probability that a local TV station’s news broadcast’s popularity rating will be
rising, given the proportion of tabloid news on the broadcast and the amount of time (on average)
that a reporter has to research a serious story.
a. Sketch contours on the table at proportion levels of 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40.
b. Mark any saddle points with an  on the contour graph. (Any saddle points for this function
appear inside the range of the printed table.)

The Project for Excellence in
Journalism is an independent
research project that has been set
up to analyze the quality of local
TV news broadcasts. The Project
for Excellence in Journalism found
that broadcasts with a mixture of
tabloid news and serious news are
not as likely to increase their
Nielsen rating as broadcasts that
are dedicated to one form of news.
The findings also suggest that local
news teams might be too under-
staffed to deliver quality reporting.

b. The contour graph on Table 8.6 (combined with the information that any saddle points lie
within the range of the table) indicates only one saddle point—slightly above and to the right
of 
. Because the contours above and below this point decrease as they
approach the point, and the contours to the left and right increase as they approach the point,
the point is the approximate location of a saddle point.
Absolute Extrema
For a relative maximum of a multivariable function, if there are no output values greater than that
relative maximum, the relative maximum is also the absolute maximum. Figure 8.20 shows a
graph that contains relative maxima at points A and B and an absolute maximum at point B.
Similarly, for a relative minimum of a multivariable function, if there are no output values less
than that relative minimum, that relative minimum is the absolute minimum.
When the boundary (terminal edges) of an input region is specified, absolute extrema may
occur at a point on the boundary, whereas relative extrema cannot occur at boundary points. If

no region is specified, the end behavior of the function must be considered when determining the
existence of an absolute extrema.
For example, if the function f represented by the graph in Figure 8.21 extends infinitely in all
directions and follows the same trends suggested by the graph, f has no absolute maximum or
absolute minimum.
However, if the edges of the box in Figure 8.21 represent the boundary of f, then f has an
absolute maximum point at the back left corner and an absolute minimum at the front right.
Absolute Extrema on Tables and Graphs
Contour curves on tables and graphs are useful in locating absolute extrema on tables and graphs
of continuous three-dimensional functions because absolute extrema can be located only within
concentric closed contour curves or on terminal edges of a table or graph.
•
Visually locate all relative extrema. Sketch contour curves if they are not already present.
Relative extrema lie within concentric closed contour curves.
•
Locate any candidates on terminal edges, if any terminal edges exist, and consider end
behavior beyond nonterminal edges.
•
Compare relative extrema, candidates on terminal edges, and limits of end behavior
beyond nonterminal edges.

Table 8.8
A Measure of the Consistency of Cheese Spread
The table entry 6502 corresponding to 5% glycerol and 1.3% salt is an approximate saddle
point because it is a maximum in the 5% glycerol column and a minimum in the 1.3% salt
row. No closed contour curves are indicated by the contours graphed on Table 8.8. The
function has no relative extrema.
b. The top and left edges of the table are terminal edges because negative percentages do not
make sense in this context. The point 
is a candidate for absolute maximum
because it is a maximum in a terminal column. The point 
is a candidate for
absolute minimum because it is a minimum in a terminal row.
c. The lower and right edges are nonterminal edges. If the consistency function continues to follow
the trends exhibited in the table, consistency will continue to decrease as the percentage of salt
increases beyond 3.3%. Even though the least value in the table is 191 at input 
, it cannot
be considered a candidate for absolute minimum because it does not lie on a terminal edge.
Consistency may continue to increase as the percentage of glycerol increases beyond
10%. If the trend within the table continues to the right of the table, consistency will become
greater than 10,533 (the greatest table value).

8.1 Concept Inventory
•
Relative extreme points of func-
tions with two input variables, rela-
tive maxima and relative minima
•
Saddle points of functions with
two input variables
•
Absolute maxima, absolute minima
We cannot consider the values
4558 (upper right corner) and
2507 (lower left corner) as candi-
dates for absolute extrema, even
though they lie in the terminal
edges along the top row and left
column of Table 8.6, because
these terminal edges can extend
down and to the right. For a cor-
ner entry in a table to be consid-
ered in the search for absolute
extrema, both the row and the
column in which the entry lies
must be terminal edges.

Weather Variations
The table shows the probability of
certain combinations of precipitation and temperature
occurring in the U.S. Corn Belt. Variation in precipitation is
reported as the percentage difference from normal (e.g., 10
represents 10% more precipitation than normal). Variation
Daily Average Global Radiation in kW-h
Global radiation is the sum of direct solar radiation and scattered solar radiation
received by one square meter of suface.

8.2
Multivariable Optimization
Relative extreme points on the graph of a continuous, differentiable, single-variable function
occur at points where the tangent line is horizontal. Derivatives are used to locate these points,
whereas second derivatives are used to identify them as maxima or minima. Similarly, for
functions with two input variables, critical points (relative extrema and saddle points) occur at
points where the two cross-sectional tangent lines are contained in a plane that is horizontal
(has the same output for all input points).
An Optimal Point
An example of a continuous, differentiable, multivariable function with a critical point is the vol-
ume of a rectangular package containing the maximum amount of printed material according to
postal bound printed–matter regulations:
where h inches is the height and w inches is the width of the package. Figure 8.36 shows a three-
dimensional graph of V.
The volume of a package of bound printed matter is maximized at 11,664 cubic inches when
the package is 18 inches high, 18 inches wide, and 36 inches long. At this point, volume is not
changing with respect to either the height or the width of the package, as illustrated graphically by
tangent lines on cross-sectional planes in Figure 8.23 and Figure 8.24. The plane that contains
both of these tangent lines is illustrated in Figure 8.25.
A relative maximum point such as the one illustrated in Figure 8.22 through Figure 8.25 is
one form of critical point.

Example 1
Using Partial Derivatives to Locate Extrema
Quality Control
At an assembly plant, the percentage of product that is flawed can be modeled as
where x is the average number of workers assigned concurrently to one assembly station and y
is the average number of hours each worker spends on
task during a shift, 
and 
. Figure
8.35 shows a graph of the quality function f.
a. Write the two partial derivatives of f.
b. What number of workers and shift length will
optimize quality when no constraints are in place?
c. What percentage of product will be flawed when
quality is optimized?
Solution
a. The partial derivatives of
both use the Chain Rule:
b. The optimal staffing requirements occur at the minimum point of the function f. This critical
point can be located by setting each partial derivative equal to zero and solving the resulting
system of equations:

Critical Points of Functions
Let f be a continuous function with two input variables x and y. A critical point of f
occurs at 
if

does not exist or 
does not exist.

fy(a, b)  0
fx(a, b)  0
(a, b)
The first case yields critical points
that are relative extrema or saddle
points. Because the second case
does not occur often in nonscien-
tific applications, we will restrict
the remainder of our discussion of
critical points to the case when
both partial derivatives are zero.
It can be proved that a critical point on a continuous, differentiable function on two vari-
ables occurs when the two partial derivates are zero.

Second Partials Matrices
The second partial derivatives are used to write the second partials matrix. The second partials
matrix is a square matrix formed by labeling the rows and the columns with the input variables
[in the same order] and writing the second partial derivative formed by taking the derivative of
the function with respect to first the column variable then the row variable.

Finding Critical Points by Using Matrices 
A linear system of equations is a system in which all the variables occur to the first
power and there are no terms in which two variables are multiplied or divided. It is
possible to solve a linear system of equations by forming a matrix of coefficients and
using matrix algebra (detailed mathematics not covered in this text) to obtain a solu-
tion. Example 2 and Example 3 can both be solved using matrix algebra.  
N O T E
The matrix method for solving
systems of equations applies only
to linear systems.

Algebraically Locating and Verifying a Maximum Point
Cake Volume
The volume index of a cake provides a measure of how much the cake rises. An index of 100 cor-
responds to the volume of the batter. The index can be modeled as
when r grams of leavening are used and the cake is baked at 177C for m minutes.

Locating and Verifying a Saddle Point
Grazing Cattle Forage
The total daily intake of organic matter foraged by a beef cow grazing the Northern Great Plains
rangeland can be modeled as
when the cow’s daily milk production is m kilograms. The variable s is a number between 
and
4, indicating the size of the cow. (Source: Simplified model based on E. E. Grings et al., “Efficiency
of Production in Cattle of Two Growth Potentials on Northern Great Plains Rangelands during
Spring-Summer Grazing,” Journal of Food Science, vol. 74, no. 10 (1996), pp. 2317–2326)
a. Locate the critical point for f.
b. Consider the two simple cross-sectional models of f containing the critical point. What does
the curvature of these models indicate about the type of critical point?
c. Calculate the determinant of the second partials matrix at the critical point and determine
whether the point is a maximum, a minimum, or a saddle point.
d. Write a sentence of interpretation of the critical point.
Solution
a. We locate any critical points by determining the input values at which the two partial
derivatives of f are zero.
Solving this system yields 
kg of milk and 
.
H I N T  8 . 3
The intake requirement corresponding to these input values is approximately 8.7 kg of
organic matter.
b. At the point 
,

are both positive, indicating that
both the 
and the 
cross-section models are concave up at that point. See
Figure 8.39 and Figure 3.40 showing these cross sections. This point is either a relative
minimum point or a saddle point.

Peptide Processing
The Louisiana crayfish industry pro-
duces over 38,600 tons of crayfish-processing by-products
every year. One potential use of these by-products is in the
production of flavor extracts. To extract flavoring from
the crayfish-processing by-products, peptides from the
by-products must be drawn out, a complicated process
with many variables. Two of these variables are the pH and
temperature maintained during the process. A model for
the amount of peptides released is

The critical point for this function occurs at input point (3, 7). If the only input points allowed are
those where y is exactly 3 less than x (illustrated by the black line on Figure 8.45), the original critical
point of f is no longer obtainable. Under this constraint (restriction on the input points of f ), the
function f may obtain a different optimum, referred to as the constrained optimum.
Not all constraints are linear. Figure 8.46 and Figure 8.47 illustrate different nonlinear
constraints on the input variables of the function f.
8.3
Optimization under Constraints
In many optimization applications, the context dictates constraints on what input values can be
used. For example, when trying to optimize revenue made from the sales of a product, the pro-
ducer is constrained by the total amount of product the company is able to produce. When a
manufacturer is trying to maximize production, budget constraints must be considered.
Constraints from a Graphical Perspective
Constrained optimization refers to the process of determining the maximum (or minimum)
output value of a multivariable function when there are restrictions placed on what input values
can be used.
For example, Figure 8.44 shows a function f with input variables x and y and Figure 8.45
shows contours of the function f.

Optimization under Constraints

The constrained optimum is the greatest (or least) output value of f corresponding to a point
on the constraint curve. The input of the constrained optimal point is the point where the constraint
curve g touches a contour curve of the constrained function at only one point without passing
through that contour curve. The constraint curve remains completely on one side of the optimal
contour curve except at the optimal point.
Constrained Optimal Points
A constraint function has the same input variables as the function being constrained. For a multi-
variable function f with input 
, a constraint function has the form 
, where g is a
function of 
and c is a constant.

Constrained Optimal Point
The optimal (maximum or minimum) point of a function f with input 
subject to
constraint 
, where c is a constant, is the point on the contour graph of f where
the constraint curve 
touches but does not cross the contour curve 
The constant m is the greatest (or least) value for which the constraint curve 
touches a contour curve of f. (Refer to Figure 8.47.)

Determining constrained optimal points involves the calculation of slopes of tangent lines. The
slope of the tangent line at a constrained optimal point can be calculated using either the multivariable
function f or the constraint function g. Figure 8.48 shows the line tangent to the constraint curve
at the optimal point 
, and Figure 8.49 shows the line tangent to a contour curve
of the function f at the optimal point.

Joseph Lagrange (1736–1813), an
Italian-born French mathematician,
showed that any extreme point for

straint g(x, y)  c occurs among
the critical points of
For this reason,

linear) aided by technology.
There is only one solution to this Lagrange system:

Numerical Verification of a Constrained Optimum
Because not all solutions to the Lagrange system have to be optimal points of the constrained
problem, it is a good idea to verify that the solution found is really an optimum. Verification can
be done graphically, but it is often easier, faster, and more accurate to verify the optimum numer-
ically. To verify numerically that a solution to the Lagrange system is the optimal point for the
constrained system, check the output value of the solution point with the output value of two
close points on the constrained function.

invested in capital (in thousands of dollars). A total of $200 thousand is available to pay employee
wages, benefits, and taxes and invest in capital. It costs the manufacturing plant an average of $18
per hour to pay wages, benefits, and taxes for each employee.

Numerical Verification of
Constrained Extreme Point
The manager will be able to maximize the production of mattresses by investing $39,200 in
capital and having his employees put in a total of 7350 worker hours.
Interpretation of the Lagrange Multiplier 
If the level of the constraint function g changes from c to 
, it will determine a different
extreme point because adding 
to the constraint equation shifts the constraint curve. Refer to
Figure 8.52.

Figure 8.52
The shifted constraint curve 
is tangent to the contour curve
. Because changing the constraint level c changes the extreme value m, the
extreme value can be considered to be a function of the constraint level: m is a function of c.
It can be shown using calculus and geometry that the Lagrange multiplier 
is the rate of
change of the extreme value with respect to the constraint level:
The units of output of lambda are
(output units of f ) per (output units of g)
When the level of the constraint changes by a small amount 
, the extreme value M of
changes by
When 
represents the output of a production function, the Lagrange multiplier 
can be
used to determine the approximate increase in the optimal production level effected by an additional
allocation of resources. Economists often refer to the value of as the marginal productivity of money.

Solution
a. The constrained system when no sodium caseinate is used is
The point at which the minimum percentage of volume is lost must satisfy the Lagrange
system of equations:
The solution to this system is 
and 
with 
. With these
proportions of whey protein and skim milk powder, the shrinkage is 
.
Figure 8.53 confirms that this value is a minimum.
b. From the solution to the system of equations in part b, we have 
. Therefore,
percentage points per unit increase in c.
c. The effect on optimal cooking loss is approximated by
In this case, c is decreased by 0.1 (from 1 to 0.9), so the change in minimum cooking loss is
approximately 
percentage point. If sodium caseinate is added so that
the proportions of whey and skim milk proteins sum to 0.9, minimum cooking loss will
increase to approximately 
.

model?
Solution
Table 8.12 shows SSE calculations for the rounded function. Table 8.13 shows SSE calculations
for a technology-generated unrounded model.
We are using a rounded model
here for ease in illustrating SSE.
The rounded model is not the
“best-fitting” model.

Goodness of Fit and the Method of Least Squares
Smaller values of SSE arise from lines where the errors are small, and larger values of SSE arise
from lines where the errors are large. A strategy for choosing the best-fitting line is to choose the
line for which the sum of squared errors (SSE) is as small as possible. Such a line is designated the
line of best fit (also called the regression line). The procedure for choosing a line of best fit by
minimizing the sum of squared errors is called the method of least squares.
The Line of Best Fit
The method of least squares is the procedure that is used to find the best-fitting line
based on the criterion that the sum of squared errors is as small as possible—that is, at a
minimum value. The linear model 
obtained by this method is called the
least-squares line.
f (x)  ax  b
The method of least squares is an unconstrained optimization problem with two input
variables. To determine the least-squares line, it is necessary to determine the values of a and b in
the linear function 
such that 
is a minimum. The deviations are of
the form

CHAPTER SUMMARY
Multivariable Optimization
For a function on two input variables, points where the partial
derivatives with respect to both input variables are both zero are
called critical points and can be relative extreme points or saddle
points. Critical points can be estimated visually on a table or
contour graph or can be located algebraically on a smooth,
continuous function f with inputs x and y by solving the system
of equations 
and 
. A critical point can be 
classified as a relative maximum point, a relative minimum
point, or a saddle point by looking at a three-dimensional graph
or contour plot or by using the Determinant Test.
Optimization under Constraints
Many practical problems involve constraints on the optimization
process. At the point where a multivariable function f has an
extreme point subject to the constraint 
, the constant
contour curve 
and the constraint 
have
the same tangent line with slope
g(x, y)  c
f (x, y)  M
g(x, y)  c
∂f
∂y  0
∂f
∂x  0
To find the constrained extreme points or to determine whether
they exist, we solve the system of equations
A solution to this system of equations can be classified as the
location of a relative maximum or relative minimum by viewing
a contour graph or three-dimensional graph or by checking the
value of the function at nearby points on the constraint curve.
The number 
is called a Lagrange multiplier. When M is the
extreme value and c is the constraint level, 
equals 
, the rate
of change of the extreme value with respect to a change in the
constraint.

Least-Squares Optimization
We end the chapter with a calculus explanation for the intuitive
idea of the line of best fit that was presented in Chapter 1. We
define the line of best fit to be the one for which the sum of
squared errors, SSE, attains a minimum. The optimization tech-
nique that finds the minimum SSE is called the method of least
squares and is an application of the method of unconstrained
optimization.

Pipe Production
A typical production run for PVC
pipes at a manufacturer can be modeled as
where c is the number of units of capital and w is the num-
ber of units of worker hours used in each run. Each unit of
capital costs $450, and each unit of worker hours costs
$400. The manufacturer has a budget of $80,000 for each
run to produce PVC pipes.
a. Write the equation of the budget constraint.
b. How many units of capital and worker hours should be
spent on each production run to maximize production
subject to the budget constraint?
c. Calculate and interpret the marginal productivity of
money in this context.
8.
Dog Run
A dog run is constructed by fencing in a rec-
tangular piece of land that is 486 sq ft in area and dividing
that land into two equal parts by another piece of fence
that is parallel to one of the sides.
a. Write the constraint equation.
b. What are the dimensions of the large rectangle that
requires the smallest total length of fence for the two-
part dog run? How much fence is needed?
c. Calculate and interpret the Lagrange multiplier in
this context.

Decreasing exponential functions and decreasing log
functions are both concave up. However, an exponential
function approaches a horizontal asymptote as input values
increase without bound, while a log function decreases with-
out bound as input values increase without bound. When
the context of a data set implies that the output values of the
function approach and remain near a specific value as input
increases, an exponential model is appropriate.

Answers may vary but should be similar to the following:
The graph of an increasing logistic function begins near
zero. It is increasing, concave up until it reaches an inflec-
tion point. It continues to increase but is concave down
and approaches a horizontal asymptote.
The graph of a decreasing logistic function begins near an
upper horizontal asymptote. It is decreasing, concave down
until it reaches an inflection point. It continues to decrease
but is concave up and approaches the input axis asymptot-
ically.

Answers may vary in form but should contain the same
elements as follows:
Functions of the form 
are referred to
as quadratic functions and have graphs that are either con-
cave down for all x or concave up for all x. Graphs of qua-
dratic functions change direction once: a concave down
quadratic increases from the left and decreases to the right,
and a concave up quadratic decreases from the left and
increases to the right.
Functions of the form 
are
referred to as cubic functions and have graphs that change
concavity exactly once. Graphs of cubic functions either
change direction twice (from increasing to decreasing and
back to increasing or from decreasing to increasing and
back to decreasing) or they never change direction. A cubic
function that is increasing from the left is concave down to
the left of the inflection point and concave up to the right
of it. A cubic function that is decreasing from the left is
concave up to the left of the inflection point and concave
down to the right.

Rates of change may be quickly estimated graphically when
a graph with a grid or numbers on the axes is provided.
Rates of change may be estimated numerically when an
equation is provided. Numerical estimation is generally
much more accurate but also more time consuming than
graphical estimation.

Answers will vary but should include the following points:
Finding the rate of change graphically gives an estimate at
one point. Finding the rate of change algebraically results
in a formula that can be used to find rates of change at any
input point for the function. The numerical method is
used to find the rate of change for any single input value
where the function is differentiable.

input value associated with the inflection point of f. As x
increases beyond the input value of the inflection point,
the slopes of the graph of

Answers will vary but may be similar to the following:
Unless the output units of the inside function match the
input units of the outside function the composed function
does not make sense. Suppose the outside function, C(n),
models cost as a function of the number of items pur-
chased. A function, n(t) dollars where t is day t of a vaca-
tion would not be suitable for composition with C(n)
because the units of n in the two functions are different.
Matching input and output variable letters is not sufficient
for composition of functions in a context.

goods by a consumer who also spends m hundred dol-
lars on his or her motor vehicles.
c. $812; $651 per hundred dollars; A consumer who
spends $340 on his or her motor vehicles will also spend
$812 on nondurable goods. At the $340 level of spend-
ing on motor vehicles, the amount spent on nondurable
goods is increasing by $651 per hundred dollar (or $6.51
per dollar) increase in spending on motor vehicles.

Answers will vary but might be similar to the following:
Unless the input units of the functions to be multiplied are
the same and their alignments match, there is no meaning
that can be given to the function that results from multi-
plication. Even if output units seem sensible, there is no
way to describe the input variable.

d. Answers will vary but might be similar to the following:
Managers should pay more attention to the rate of
change of profit than the rate of change of average
profit. Although the rate of change of average profit is
negative when 10 million units are produced, it is not
as negative as it was when only 2 million units were
produced. The overall profit situation is improving and
profit was increasing at a production level of 10 mil-
lion units.

a. The function f is increasing, concave up for 
.
b. Yes; a linearization will underestimate the function val-
ues because it will be based on the tangent line at a point.
The tangent will lie beneath the curve for all values
except the point of tangency.
19.
a. The function s is increasing over 
and decreas-
ing over 
. It is concave down for all input.
b. Yes; a linearization of s will always overestimate the
function values because the tangent line will lie above s
except at the particular t value.
21.
When rates of change are used to approximate change in a
function, approximations over shorter intervals are generally
better than approximations over longer intervals because the
tangent line generally lies closer to the graph of the function
near the point of tangency.

Answers will vary but should be similar to the following:
Area is always a positive value. Accumulated change is an
interpretation of a signed area. If the area is a region
between a positive portion of the rate-of-change function
and the horizontal axis, the accumulated change is an
increase in the function over the input interval where the
rate-of-change function was positive. If the area is a region
between a negative portion of the rate-of-change function
and the horizontal axis, the accumulated change is a
decrease in the function over the input interval where the
rate-of-change function was negative.

Answers will vary but should include the following points:
The accumulated change over an interval and the definite
integral with the same limiting values are equivalent when
considering the same continuous function. These values
may be positive, negative, or zero. The area over an interval
on which the continuous function being considered has
negative values will differ from the accumulated change
and the definite integral. The area will not ever have a neg-
ative value.

A path of steepest descent is a curve crossing multiple con-
tours in such a way that at any point on the descent path
the distance along the path between that point and the
next contour level is as short as possible. 
To sketch a path of steepest descent on a contour graph:
locate the starting point, find the closest point on the next
lower contour curve, cross this contour curve with a
perpendicular line and repeat until there are no lower con-
tours. The sketch may produce a straight line, but more
often it will produce a curve. The path of steepest descent
will meet all intersecting contour levels at right angles.

Derivatives of cross-sectional models of a function with two
input variables can be used to pin-point the input values of
optimal points on those cross-sections. These optimal points
in turn may be used to estimate the point at which a critical

b. A: saddle point 
B: relative maximum
23.
One possible answer: To locate a critical point, determine
both first partial derivatives, set each equal to zero and
solve. Any input (a, b) for which both first partial deriva-
tives are zero will yield a critical point.
To determine the type of critical point found, write the four
second partial derivatives of the function. Evaluate the deter-
minant of the second partials matrix. If D(a, b) is negative,
then (a, b) yields a saddle point. If D(a, b) is positive, then
evaluate one of the non-mixed second partials at (a, b).
If that second partial is negative, then (a, b) yields a
maximum. If it is positive, then (a, b) yields a minimum.
If D(a, b) is zero, then the determinant test fails and estima-
tion graphically or numerically may help.
