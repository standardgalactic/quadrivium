Foreword
Cloud transformation has created a huge disruption: How can customers leverage 
public cloud services and deployment models to dramatically reduce costs, improve 
profitability, and invest in innovation? The fundamental dilemma faced by leaders and, 
by extension, providers of commercial software applications is how to effectively reduce 
costs and increase profitability while at the same time continuing to invest in innovation.
This is where I see tremendous opportunity for companies and partners to leverage 
Oracle cloud services, helping them to effectively balance these priorities and critical 
business objectives while at the same time ensuring that cost reduction and profitability 
do not come entirely at the expense of innovation.
By migrating applications, our customers can not only reduce upfront costs and 
capital expenditures but also drive sustainable long-term improvements in profitability 
based on the tooling, automation, and life cycle management capabilities inherent in 
Oracle cloud platform services. Oracle’s IaaS has the best performance/price on the 
market, allowing users to lift and shift any technologies and then innovate and scale.
Vendors and customers can enrich their existing applications with new, value-
added functionality and, in so doing, accelerate innovation and increase value to their 
customers. They can also reduce their ongoing development costs (and accelerate time to 
market) by leveraging Oracle’s R&D spending in the cloud (IoT, big data, analytic, and so 
much more).
By scaling their applications on Oracle’s enterprise-grade cloud platform, Oracle’s 
users can drive further cost reduction and economies of scale. They can also improve 
application performance and reliability.
Finally, the large ISV ecosystem can take advantage of the Oracle cloud marketplace 
to dramatically expand users’ addressable opportunities and reach new segments of 
prospective customers. Our customers can now deploy a growing portfolio of cloud-ready 
applications matching their technical and business needs.
What are the basics? How to start? What shall you consider? This book will bring you 
the knowledge to leverage the full value of the Oracle cloud platform.

﻿ ■ Foreword
xviii
We’re in a new era of computing. Our way of doing business is changing. Data is becoming 
the most important asset for companies. To be a data-driven company, a simpler, more 
agile, self-service, and less costly infrastructure is required. Cloud is the core enabler of 
this transformation. IT has had several transformations in the past decades, and Oracle 
has always been a main player in those transformations, such as client/server, Internet, 
engineered systems, and now cloud. Yasin has done a great job of introducing Oracle IaaS 
cloud services to all who are willing to be part of this great transformation.

CHAPTER 1
Oracle Cloud
Cloud is a technology solution that is growing and expanding with every passing day. 
Today, you can keep your social media data, such as Instagram and Flickr, in addition 
to all your enterprise data in the cloud. Thus, everybody is looking for ways to store data 
for less money and greater facility. Under the impact of current changes, the IT industry 
seeks to move on-premise solutions to the cloud. The biggest advantage of cloud is 
the cost savings realized from its use on a “pay as you go” basis. Thereby, projects can 
be initiated at low cost. On the other hand, on-premise solutions must be purchased. 
However, much of the time, these solutions aren’t estimated correctly or used 
completely. A project may be started without expensive hardware and software and then 
change to meet new requirements. The result of such unpredictability is that money may 
have been wasted.
Cloud solutions provide an opportunity to work with your team members, so that 
everyone can, for example, easily connect to a cloud account for editing, copying, and 
deleting team documents on the cloud service.
Cloud affects many sectors in developing new solutions, particularly software 
solutions, a.k.a. Software as a Service (SaaS), in cloud terminology. Thus, a company 
doesn’t have to take on new infrastructure to maximize software applications.
Cloud has adapted to offer new solutions. First, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
is based on server-side architecture, so a customer can put applications to work on a 
big infrastructure service. In addition, new services may be required by customers, so 
platform service is generated, and the customer can use any application in the cloud 
whenever needed. Finally, if customers want to work applications in the cloud, they don’t 
have to change anything on the application side.
Cloud solutions can be applied in such sectors as health, retail, and software, among 
other major sectors. This basically means that cloud is a trend reaching countless people, 
and, therefore, as sectors grow, the market for cloud is growing with these sectors.

Advantages of Cloud
Cloud technology offers the ability to manage all solutions on remote servers. For those 
thinking about adopting cloud technologies, there are many advantages to consider, 
including the following:
• 
Cost: Cloud vendors offer services at a reasonable price, and 
customers can easily pay through cloud web sites. Oracle Cloud, 
for example, is bought through shop.oracle.com.
• 
Flexibility: Cloud technologies enable users to employ it from 
everywhere, and this is the most popular reason for using cloud 
services.
• 
Disaster prevention: Cloud services enable high-availability 
support for solutions to customers’ problems.
• 
Maintenance: Cloud provides a specific service-level agreement 
(SLA) to customers, particularly hardware replacements.
Oracle Cloud Models
Oracle offers three types of cloud services: public, private, and hybrid.
• 
Public cloud: This service allows database administrators and 
developers to use the public cloud everywhere. Public cloud use 
can be initiated with a cloud account.
• 
Private cloud: Private cloud allows database administrators and 
developers use of the cloud for specific areas (i.e., a user’s own 
data center), and only authorized users can connect with this 
cloud service.
• 
Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud refers to all cloud solutions working in 
one place.
Cloud Services
There are three main types of cloud services: Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, 
and Infrastructure as a Service.
SaaS (Software as a Service)
SaaS is a subscription model for the use of application services. Many Oracle Cloud 
applications support this model, so you can register a great number of business 
operations, such as sales, marketing, and human resources, with a subscription model.

Chapter 1 ■ Oracle Cloud
3
PaaS (Platform as a Service)
PaaS is a subscription model for using infrastructure services. Modern infrastructure 
capabilities support cloud architecture. This service provides easy deployment and cost-
effective maintenance, e.g., database cloud service, Java cloud service (PaaS: Database 
Management, Security, integration).
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS is a subscription model for using hardware- (infrastructure-) related services. 
IaaS allows hardware engineers to use a hardware subscription for development and 
maintenance with a few clicks, e.g., Oracle’s Storage Cloud Service, Compute Cloud 
Service, and Network Cloud Service (Container Cloud Service).
Oracle IaaS Cloud
Oracle Public Cloud was announced, and this product is a leading candidate for changing 
the database cloud market owing to the fact that Oracle Public Cloud must be learned in 
order to apply it to future database management. Since it was inaugurated, this Oracle 
Cloud service is growing day by day. Cloud is a trend, and it is becoming increasingly 
important to master its related technology as soon as possible. All database vendors have 
started to migrate technologies from on-premise to cloud.
Cloud is developed with engineered systems and hardware (Oracle hardware) and 
software, together with Oracle Cloud solutions. This book demonstrates how to effectively 
utilize your cloud service in the following order:
	
1.	
Compute Cloud Service
	
2.	
Storage Cloud Service
	
3.	
Network Cloud Service
	
4.	
Ravello Cloud Service
	
5.	
Container Cloud Service
Cloud Headlines
Cloud has introduced many new technical terms, and these must be understood, 
especially to undertake cloud service operations.
• 
Identity domain: The unique name for a customer. All operations 
are conducted under this name. Whenever you register a new 
service, it is created using this unique name. An identity domain 
is used to validate login credentials. In addition, Oracle support 
provides help by identifying you through this name. (Further 
assistance is provided by the Oracle Cloud help desk.)

Chapter 1 ■ Oracle Cloud
4
• 
Single sign-on (SSO): This feature provides secure login for users 
and access to multiple applications.
• 
Data center (DC): Oracle provides data center locations for cloud 
users and assigns many locations from which to host numerous 
customer data applications.
• 
Service: The term refers to the name of a select service delivered 
by Oracle.
• 
Oracle identity console: This is the console that helps to manage 
users and roles.
• 
Account: This is used to show all account-related information.
• 
Users: This refers to a principal user and to the current user 
working with the services. (The name of the registered user is 
specified.)
• 
Service administration: This role can be assumed when creating 
and managing instance.
• 
Account administration: This role is assumed for monitoring and 
managing instance.
• 
Identity domain administration: This role is assumed during 
administrative activities.
Requesting a Trial Subscription
Cloud is divided into two basic subscription models. One model is a paid membership, 
and another is a trial membership. The latter is a 30-day limited model. Oracle now offers 
a free $300 service for a pay-as-you-go model.
Getting Started: Oracle Cloud with a Trial Account
Oracle offers customers a renewable service. A trial account can be requested either for 
$300 worth of free credits or 30 days, (whichever expires first) for any Oracle cloud service 
that offers a trial model. These services start upon activation, so the starting point is your 
subscription date.
In order to start an Oracle cloud trial, you must first have a shop.oracle.com 
account. This is the same as an Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) or Oracle Technology 
Network (OTN) account, so, basically, it is an Oracle SSO account. Through this account, 
you can request an Oracle cloud account for using the IaaS service. With a few clicks, an 
account can be registered for cloud service use. As of March 1, 2017, all pay-as-you-go 
services are included in a trial account.

CHAPTER 2
Compute Cloud
Today, Compute Cloud is one of the top-notch services on the market. Many cloud 
providers support the compute service, which makes compute services the basis of many 
other cloud services, such as Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) 
(see Figure 2-1). Compute is a new-generation service for creating new virtual machines 
that include many platforms. Compute services are integrated by many vendors, such 
as Oracle, Amazon, Azure, and other local vendors. Moreover, IaaS and PaaS have been 
developed to easily integrate and build new applications with only a few clicks. Compute 
services are built through new-generation virtualization technologies that are used in 
cloud infrastructure; therefore, one service can accommodate many customers from a 
single point.
Figure 2-1.  IaaS cloud pyramid
The biggest advantage of compute cloud services is consolidated management of 
many compute instances. Furthermore, it requires no extra IT staff or effort, such as 
database administrators (DBAs) or hardware support staff, thus companies can limit 
extra cost through compute instances. Old infrastructure providers can’t create new 
instance dedicatedly, but new-generation vendors do, and this service allows changes 
in utilization. For example, if one CPU is settled in a compute service by customers but 
suddenly those customers change their minds about the CPU, the customers can change 
this CPU shape with new-generation compute services. Computing resources are isolated 
from one another for each node. All compute nodes are dedicated to your particular 
usage, and Oracle provides network isolation through a virtual private network (VPN).

Chapter 2 ■ Compute Cloud
14
At this point, Oracle is bringing its own experience for building new-generation 
compute services. Many advantages are accruing with new-generation cloud services, 
which are easily provisioned to migrate applications and to work virtual machines with 
scalable performance, securely and with scalability. Oracle services are able to work 
on many platforms: Linux distributions (Oracle Enterprise Linux, Debian), Solaris, and 
Microsoft Windows.
Advantages of IaaS
Oracle IaaS offers user experiences through innovative and useful design. In addition, 
IaaS has fabulous features that are helping to solve many problems for adopting and 
migrating current solutions. The features include:
	
1.	
Provisioning. The service offers rapid provisioning for creating 
virtual machines.
	
2.	
Migration. Owing to the ability to select the data center closest 
to a customer’s location, data can be migrated easily from on-
premise to cloud.
	
3.	
Visibility. A control panel is provided to easily monitor and 
control your service.
	
4.	
Deployment. The service provides multiple deployment 
options (such as GUI, REST, and API).
	
5.	
Enterprise grade. The service offers secure, high-performance, 
and high availability options for deploying applications.
Creating an Oracle Compute Service
To find and upload your operating system (Oracle offers many pre-built images based on 
Oracle Linux and customers’ own uploaded images), you can use Oracle Cloud Market 
Place to select the operating system that you require, such as Microsoft Windows, Linux 
Debian, or Oracle Enterprise Linux.
Oracle Market Place can be found at https://cloud.oracle.com/marketplace/
faces/homePage.jspx.
A new IaaS service can be obtained easily by taking the following steps:
	
1.	
First, click Compute Cloud Service from the dashboard, and 
the service page will show account information (Figure 2-2).

Connecting Compute Node
Everything is done, and now we are at the point of accessing our compute node. First, we 
must do some configuration related to security issues: source and target security lists that 
aim to connect users to the compute node from the public Internet.
PuTTY or a similar SSH client is required for connecting Linux machines. Remote 
Desktop can be used for Windows-based instances. The following steps assume the use of 
SSH (port 22). If Remote Desktop is used, follow the same steps but use port 3389 instead.
	
1.	
Make sure that you are on the Compute Service Console. After 
clicking the Network tab, select Create Security Rule from 
Security Rule section (Figure 2-27).
Figure 2-26.  Instance logs
Figure 2-27.  Creating security rule
	
24.	
When enabled, the Logs page displays any logs provided, such 
as the Console Log (Figure 2-26).

Chapter 2 ■ Compute Cloud
29
	
2.	
Specify the security list that you initially selected for your new 
compute instance. We will grant access (for example, for port 
22 from the Internet) to this list. Because this security list is 
connected to your compute instance, the compute instance 
will be accessible on, for example, port 22 (Figure 2-28). 
(Specifically, you can select public Internet from the Security 
IP List.)
Figure 2-28.  Security rule 
■
■Note  If you do not specify security rules, you cannot connect to the instance.
	
3.	
Now, we should be able to connect to our system. Make a note 
of the compute instance public IP address. Let’s start with 
PuTTY and enter your public IP address under Host Name 
(Figure 2-29).

Removing Oracle Compute Service
You have learned how to install the compute node, but I haven’t discussed how to remove 
this service from the cloud. To remove the compute node, you have to remove the relevant 
orchestration entries from the Orchestrations tab. All services are started with orchestrations. 
When you drop the relevant orchestration, the items created by this orchestration (disks, 
network, CPU, memory, etc.) will be deleted. This is a unique feature because, normally, 
other cloud service providers do this removal via a machine’s remove section.
Let’s see how removal is done.
	
1.	
Click the orchestration service tab and click to stop the 
orchestration line for your cloud instance that has the 
extension “_Master” in the name (Figure 2-34).
Figure 2-33.  Connection with PuTTY 
Figure 2-34.  Orchestration
	
2.	
You will receive a warning that all objects will be deleted and 
that you should confirm your decision to delete (Figure 2-35).

Oracle Market Place
Many applications are developed by independent software vendors and system 
integrators. Broadly speaking, they are seeking to promote their own products in the IT 
sector, thus Oracle is offering a market place from which to develop new business in the 
cloud. Oracle Market Place makes use of the marketplace more accessible. Oracle Cloud 
products can be published to a dedicated distribution channel.

Network
Security is provided at a high level, so that a user cannot engage in any undesirable 
behavior, owing to the fact that security is designed for, and supported at, every level. 
(Network security is a real problem, and knowing that this is a critical issue, Oracle 
seeks to provide secure cloud for customers.) To ensure security, you can specify which 
IP addresses to connect to the machine, or you can open public Internet for cloud 
applications. Both scenarios are available from Oracle Cloud.
The network settings are applied to all machines on Oracle Cloud.

It is important to be able to add images in Oracle Cloud, because it is likely the customer’s 
primary goal to use his or her own images. There are, of course, criteria governing this 
procedure. The following are the OS versions currently certified in this regard:
• 
6.4, 6.6 UEK3 and UEK4
• 
6.7 UEK4 and UEK4
• 
6.8 ,7.1, 7.2 UEK3

User Account Administration
Although many cloud services are presented as ready-to-use, several security 
problems could arise if your user administration—basically, high-level access to your 
environment—is insecure. Remember that 80% of all security breaches come from 
inside an organization. Therefore, spend time on mapping which user should get what 
(maximum) access to your cloud services.

Summary
In this chapter, you have learned how to create a compute service and select an 
application on it from Oracle Cloud Market Place. Oracle’s Compute Cloud service 
could be defined as the main service in the Oracle IaaS architecture. Therefore, if you 
want to understand Oracle IaaS, you must first understand Oracle Compute service 
fundamentals. In the next chapter, we are going to examine Oracle cloud storage 
technology and see how to create and use this service.

CHAPTER 3
Storage Cloud
Today, an inevitable fact is that the IT market is moving from on-premise to cloud systems. 
In addition, the leading product related to this development is storage in the cloud, owing 
to the fact that disk usage and types are increasing rapidly in the current market. Within ten 
years, tapes will have to be changed and maintained periodically, and this could greatly 
increase the workload of IT professionals. Therefore, cloud storage has been developed 
to resolve many issues, such as disk replacement, network and CPU usage, and other 
maintenance concerns. Cloud solutions aim to reduce costs, so cloud storage is offered at an 
affordable price. In my opinion, cloud storage usage represents approximately 10%–20% of 
enterprise platforms, but in a few years, it will be roughly 30%–40% of the IT market. If this 
occurs, the effectiveness of on-premise solutions will diminish day by day. Fortunately, cloud 
storage solutions are offered by several vendors, such as Oracle, Microsoft, and Amazon.
Oracle Storage Cloud offers solutions for all companies that are in the need of quick 
provisioned storage, and it includes many great features. Many of these features were 
adopted for new-generation storage cloud solutions. These technologies are based 
on cloud, and Oracle Storage Cloud is aimed to solve enterprise problems, such as 
protection and data sharing, and offer a quick response to increasing data size. Moreover, 
Oracle Storage Cloud offers new-generation design and a modern user interface, from 
which cloud operations can be easily configured by IT professionals. This service 
provides an opportunity to migrate all files from on-premise to the Oracle Storage Cloud 
systems, which support numerous third-party tools (Figure 3-1).

Chapter 3 ■ Storage Cloud
86
At present, customers’ main concern is all about security, and they are facing 
difficulties in trusting real-world reliable cloud systems, owing to security issues. The 
main point should not be how to back up all your data but how to keep data safe and 
secure. Therefore, Oracle has a different perspective on cloud security. For example, 
whenever an object is created in Oracle Cloud, a unique symmetric key is generated by 
Oracle Cloud (instance whenever).
Standards have changed, and now these standards are being adapted for 
enterprise companies in terms of RESTful APIs and OpenStack. RESTful APIs will be 
obligatory for managing cloud and on-premise systems. In my opinion, in the near 
future, many clients will move solutions to REST technology, and these solutions 
will be managed by remote third-party tools that are used in IT industries (such as 
CloudBerry and Commvault).
Advantages of Cloud Storage
The main advantage of the Oracle Cloud Service is price. Oracle offers several price 
options for using its services with respect to usage type. Hence, no additional costs are 
accrued. Following are some of the service’s other advantages:
	
1.	
Elasticity: Provides an elastic approach to storaging hardware 
and configuring disk size. With this feature, your data can 
increase from megabyte to petabyte.
	
2.	
Standardization: Manages data via third-party tools, such as 
Open Stack. Manages object files via REST or other tools.
	
3.	
Security: IaaS encryption provides multiple security layers.
	
4.	
Reliability: Ensures a high availability of data redundancy 
through a replication policy. (Data is written to a specific data 
center, and this data is replicated asynchronously to a selected 
data center.)
Oracle Storage Cloud is helping to manage services with a few clicks. Next, you will 
see how the configuration operations are performed.
Installation
Oracle Storage Cloud can be completed in a few steps. First, click the service screen to set 
storage cloud configurations through PuTTY. There are some prerequisites for installing 
storage cloud service. Before service installation, the user must take a key for using this 
service and then connect to it via CloudBerry for ease of management.
	
1.	
Find the Storage section from the dashboard (Figure 3-2).

Next, download cURL from the following web site: https://
winampplugins.co.uk/curl/, to obtain an authentication token 
for Oracle Storage Cloud Service. (cURL can be considered a 
REST endpoint, and a container can be created through it. Today, 
containers also can be created through a service UI.)
■
■Note  Be sure to use the cURL directory to execute cURL commands, such as the 
following.
curl -v -s -X GET -H "X-Storage-User: Storage-usthetalen:yasin@ ****.com"

Summary
In this chapter, I discussed how to create and use a storage cloud service. This service 
provides backup easily, with a few clicks. Many objects can be backed up with the Oracle 
Storage Cloud Service. In this section, we reviewed how to perform several tasks that can 
be accomplished by using the storage cloud. In the next chapter, you will see how to make

CHAPTER 4
Ravello
Today’s IT market is growing with the development of new products, and purchases are 
increasing proportionally. The size of the market exceeds 1 billion dollars for IT vendors 
of on-premise solutions, excepting cloud solutions. Of course, these purchases will not 
always be beneficial, as many products can be selected that are not suited to certain IT 
sectors. A lot of money is wasted as a result of these bad choices, and the main reason 
for this is incorrectly tested products. Therefore, many projects fail, owing to this reason 
and also because if very expensive purchases lead to bad results, buyers can be removed 
from their jobs. Oracle’s Ravello service is trying mitigate these problems, putting IT 
professionals on the right path to purchasing products that yield positive results.
Ravello’s acquisition by Oracle was announced on February 22, 2016 and was 
completed in March 2017. The product transforms any public cloud, currently Amazon 
AWS, Google Cloud, and Oracle Public Cloud Service, into the ideal enterprise 
development and test infrastructure.
Ravello is a product development environment (Figure 4-1). With this service, you 
can easily use different cloud providers, such as Google Cloud and Amazon Cloud.
Figure 4-1.  Ravello and IT environments

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
98
Changing enterprise business needs are driving cloud-based solutions. Developers 
want their own test environment, and customers want to have an online demo or trial 
environment—all of this simulated as if it were on-premise. Ravello provides rapid 
deployment and management of all virtualized enterprise environments into its cloud 
systems. Oracle Ravello is able to run VMware and KVM environments, without network 
or driver changes, unaltered on the Ravello systems. In addition, virtualized disks and 
CD/DVDs can be uploaded to start new environments.
HVX
The hypervisor in a virtualization environment is used to translate requests from the 
virtual machine (VM), for example, a write request or a network request, into the 
proper format for the underlying hardware. Because most cloud providers use different 
virtualization technologies, Ravello built a so-called nested hypervisor layer called HVX.
A VM built for VMware will have different requests for disk access than a VM built 
on Google Cloud. Ravello’s HVX technology “knows” the different kinds of requests the 
supported source platforms use. Ravello also has drivers for the various cloud platforms it 
runs on.
So, no matter what your source virtualization technology is, and no matter what 
your target cloud service is, Ravello will translate all requests from the VM into requests 
that are accepted by the underlying cloud platform. Currently, Ravello can utilize the 
following cloud solutions as supported targets:
	
1.	
Oracle Public Cloud
	
2.	
Amazon Web Service
	
3.	
Google Compute Cloud
The customer can decide, based on location of the target cloud provider service, 
which underlying service is used. Billing is transparent for the user; only Ravello will send 
him or her an invoice.
Management
Oracle Ravello is a widely available system to simulate all infrastructure services in the 
cloud. The environments are fully isolated, owing to VXLAN technology, and can be 
managed by either an impressive GUI or through REST API calls. Ravello allows you to 
plan the starting and stopping of environments and displays very detailed overviews of 
costs per application and costs incurred so far.
Network
The Ravello service provides a highly secure network for accessing and managing Oracle 
Ravello services based on Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) technology. The switches can 
simulate a Layer 2 network, which includes broadcasting and multicasting. Several network 
segments will be created automatically, based on the settings in the VM, per network.  

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
99
A Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) 
simulate, together with the routers and switches that are needed to connect the various 
networks.
When duplicating an existing Ravello setup, all networks will remain the same in the 
copy of the original application. Owing to the VXLAN usage, several networks (for copies 
of ViMs) can be exactly the same (same IP ranges, IP addresses, gateways, etc.), so that 
it is very easy to roll out several identical setups for demonstration, testing, training, and 
development purposes.
Advantages of Ravello
Oracle Ravello had many advantages, but one of the best is that it helps to duplicate 
an IT environment design with drag-and-drop motions or, for a VMware environment, 
by simply pointing the upload agent to the running VMware system. The upload agent 
will duplicate the VMware setup as an exact copy into the Ravello environment. Other 
advantages of Ravello service are the following:
	
1.	
Agility. Ravello reduces provisioning time for testing 
machines. Create it once, and you can provision it multiple 
times in seconds.
	
2.	
Cost. Because there is no up-front charge for using this 
service, fees accrue only when the VMs are actually started, 
thereby saving you on CAPEX expenses. Owing to the 
automatic stop and scheduling options, you save on OPEX 
costs.
	
3.	
Scalability. Users can increase sizing or run multiple 
environments from any geographical location.
	
4.	
Fidelity. Ravello provides exact clones from existing VMs in 
your data center and runs them unaltered on the Ravello cloud.
Ravello Import Utility
The easiest way to start a new Ravello VM is to upload an existing VM, virtualized disk, 
or CD/DVD. Ravello currently accepts KVM, OVA, and OVFA files and also their internal 
Ravello format. Currently, your VMs can be imported through the Ravello import utility, 
which is available as a native application for Windows or as a command line interface. On 
Microsoft Windows, this utility can be installed easily with a few clicks. It will install like a 
desktop application. When put into service, it can work with the desktop application.
Oracle Ravello is helping to test your environment with a few clicks. Here’s how the 
installation is done.

On the dashboard page, new applications can be created 
with the Create Application button. (Ravello classifies 
applications through Create Application; therefore, users 
easily understand which new application is selected.)  
(See Figure 4-8.)
	
8.	
First, before the import process, an application from  
the Create Application button must be completed 
(Figure 4-9).

9.	
Now, VM can be uploaded using the Import button. (The time 
may vary, depending on the size of the VM and the distance 
from the data center.)
	
10.	
First, download installation.exe and double-click to install 
the tool.
Select Library from left menu and click VM, then click Import VM and select OS 
for the downloading import agent. Save the file in a local download location. After 
the download has finished, start the .exe file. Because the setup file will install an 
application, local administrator rights might be required.
	
11.	
Click Next (Figure 4-10).
	
12.	
Click Install (Figure 4-11).

Item (Figure 4-16).
	
19.	
After clicking the upload button, a wizard will start. From 
here, you can choose what you want to upload. Oracle Ravello 
supports many VM and VM disk types, such as OVA, VMDK, 
and ISO (Figure 4-18).
	
20.	
After selecting the type of file you want to upload, click Start to 
begin uploading (Figure 4-19).
	
21.	
Select your VMs (or disks) from your computer and click the 
Upload button (Figure 4-20).

22.	
After VM import, your objects will be stored in your library. 
When selecting your newly created application, you can drag 
and drop your recently uploaded VMs into the canvas or 
connect your recently uploaded disks or ISO files to your VMs 
(Figure 4-21).
	
23.	
After dragging and dropping a VM into your application 
canvas, a network is automatically created for you. You can see 
your cloud network setup on the Network tab (Figure 4-22).

24.	
Before you can start (“publish,” in Ravello terminology) your 
application, make sure that all errors are resolved, by clicking 
on your canvas. If there are any errors, there will be a red 
warning area at the top of your canvas. Click it to see what the 
issues are and solve them, until there is no longer a red area.
Now, click the Publish button to start your application (Figure 4-23).
	
25.	
Before starting the environment, Ravello will present you with 
an overview of your application, for example, a section with 
CPU, RAM, and Diskspace. It will give you the choice to select 
a data center (at an additional cost) or to let Ravello decide.
Figure 4-23.  Publish

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
111
The screen also allows you to automatically stop an environment (for cost-saving 
purposes) and will give you an overview of the costs per hour for this setup (Figure 4-24).
If you agree with the review and the costs displayed, click the Publish button again, 
to deploy (and start) your application.
	
26.	
Once a VM is running, you can connect to the OS console 
display using the console button (Figure 4-25).
Figure 4-24.  Publish Application

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
112
Blueprint
After creating the perfect setup with perhaps many application VMs connecting to a 
cluster of database VMs (or simply one very well-created VM), you might want to save the 
setup for future use or for easy duplication. Ravello can do this by saving your application 
setup as a so-called Blueprint. The Blueprint consists of the relationship of the VMs in 
the application but also contains a snapshot of the disk of the VMs in the Blue Print in the 
state (so with the same contents and status) they had at the time of the Blueprint. First, 
open your application (canvas). You can now click Save as Blueprint, to make a copy of 
your application setup (Figure 4-26).
There are two ways of getting Blueprint to select options and write names (Figure 4-27).
	
1.	
Shutdown First: This is recommended for taking an image, 
because a conflict could arise when taking an image.
	
2.	
No Shutdown: If a VN can’t be closed, you can select this 
option.
Figure 4-25.  Monitor
Figure 4-26.  Blueprint

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
113
As a demonstration, save the current application as a Blueprint called “IaaS-Book-bp,” 
after first shutting down the started VMs. We will use this Blueprint in the following steps.
	
1.	
Your Blueprint will be stored in your library. A screen shows 
Blueprints that are available for use (Figure 4-28).
When you have sufficient access rights, you can share blueprints with your 
colleagues or publish them on Ravello Marketplace. Make sure that you have the 
blueprint saved in your library, as we will use it in the next step.
	
2.	
Under Library, click Blueprints and select your recently 
created blueprint. A drag-and-drop canvas will appear, similar 
to the application canvas. This screen displays the contents of 
the blueprint.
	
3.	
To start this blueprint (again), we must convert it into an 
application. The original blueprint will stay in our library for 
future use. Select Create Application, to start a new application 
based on our previously created blueprint (Figure 4-29).
Figure 4-27.  Saving as blueprint
Figure 4-28.  Blueprints library

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
114
	
4.	
Specify the application name for building the new application 
and click Create (Figure 4-30).
Figure 4-29.  Dashboard
Figure 4-30.  Create Application

Chapter 4 ■ Ravello
115
	
5.	
The blueprint will now be copied and made available as an 
application. You can now start (publish) your application that 
was based on a blueprint (Figure 4-31).
The same blueprint can be used over and over again, as many times as you require 
them to refresh your environment or as many times as you need them in parallel for 
training or testing. All network settings, hostnames, and other options will be the same. 
The only things that change are the Internet-facing IP addresses.
Summary
Oracle Ravello is a tool for simulating, testing, training, and demoing IT environments. 
Oracle uses Ravello to simulate information technology environments in enterprise 
companies. This chapter showed you how to check your system for using any cloud 
solution. Oracle Ravello offers easy solutions to accommodate your cloud requirements. 
In addition, the service supports customers’ VM uploads through a tool to scale according 
to reality-based metrics. Using Ravello will make many projects more useful and time-
efficient, so that they are positioned more accurately and money will not be wasted. In the 
next chapter, we will explore the container cloud service and its uses.

CHAPTER 5
Container Cloud
Today, many web applications are released in the cloud, to provide service through the 
public Internet. Ten years ago, all of these applications were hosted on a hosting service 
on a virtualized machine. Whenever a new machine was needed in the cloud, this new 
machine was only generated by a service provider. However, some customers didn’t 
want to give this permission. Therefore, Docker changed this with a new-generation 
virtualization solution that was particularly useful to startup companies.
Docker is an open source project that manages multiple virtual images in a service. 
Docker provides continuous integration and continuous deployment, particularly with 
GitHub and Jenkins, for improving development flow. Docker creates clone machines in 
a few minutes from the cloud. This saves customers time, as they can create new machine 
configurations, such as hardware, network, etc., with a few clicks, without burdening 
their customers with an additional workload. Docker is developed with multiple layers, 
including infrastructure, operating, and Docker system. Therefore, all such items are 
unified at a single point.
The Docker system provides virtualized service geared to develop applications in 
multiple IT environments. Traditionally, IT systems are not transparent to other services, 
but Docker supports transparency between cloud machines. For example, if you have 
one machine for developing Java and WebLogic, but this system no longer accepts an 
additional workload, normally you might have to create and configure one machine 
again, causing much time to be spent on this process. Furthermore, the project might 
expire as the result of a time-related issue. Therefore, the Oracle Container Cloud Service 
is designed to provide a high degree of availability and scalability.
Docker architecture is divided into two parts:
	
1.	
Container: The Docker container is managed by the Container 
service, and this service’s main aim is to manage all Docker 
images, so that they work properly with one another.
	
2.	
Image: A Docker image is created for building new services, 
such as an application server, database, and other IT 
applications, and this image aims to work applications on 
container. Furthermore, all images are working on a container, 
thus disks will be saved.

Chapter 5 ■ Container Cloud
118
Docker Architecture
Docker has a unique design (Figure 5-1), although it offers multiple products for the 
IT world. Traditional virtual machine (VM) servers don’t support API-based solutions 
to create and manage new virtual machines. Docker is powered by the cloud, thus 
developers don’t need comprehensive knowledge to manage the service. Docker works 
with two main elements.
Figure 5-1.  Differences between the VM and Docker container
	
1.	
Namespace: This service aims to isolate service and control 
this isolation.
	
2.	
Cgroups: This service adjust resource size to work properly 
within a system.
Oracle Cloud Container
Oracle understood Docker technologies’ power to add value to cloud solutions, thus 
Oracle’s interest in how to easily manage Docker services through third-party cloud 
service. Oracle Cloud services helps users to make containers, and this service offers the 
ability to create services quickly and easily, thereby increasing a company’s productivity. 
This service uses special production, testing, and pre-production environments. Oracle 
Container Cloud Service’s main aim is to manage Docker and improve control for systems 
to work properly.
• 
Management: As you know that time is an important asset for 
productivity, if you have to set up Docker on infrastructure quickly, 
Oracle Container Cloud helps to sets up Docker in a few clicks.
• 
Configuration: Oracle offers flexibility to change Docker 
infrastructure.

Summary
In this chapter, I explained what the container service is and how to use it. You’ve  
seen how to facilitate interactions between Oracle and Docker. Oracle supports  
new-generation startup technologies, and it has built new cloud applications, using 
the Docker architecture. As you know, Oracle Container Cloud supports management 
and configuration of the Docker system, and Oracle also harnesses the power of open 
source technology. Oracle tries to accommodate other open source technologies and will 
continue to support open source software and software development environments.
