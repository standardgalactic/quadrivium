Authors’ Acknowledgments
There is a long list of people we would like to especially thank, who helped 
make this book possible. 
To gather accurate information for the sidebars and icons in this book, we 
turned to many food experts and associations. We’d like to thank Susan Lamb 
Parenti and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association; Robin Kline and Ed 
Newman, consultants for the National Pork Producers Council; the American 
Lamb Council; and the National Institute of Fisheries. We are also grateful for 
the invaluable contributions of Donna Myers, editor of “The BackYard 
BarbeQuer” newsletter — after more than 25 years as spokesperson for the 
Barbecue Industry Association, Donna knows as much about grilling equipment, 
manufacturers, and techniques as anyone we know. And thank you illustrators 
extraordinaire, Liz Kurtzman and Rich Tennant. 
We thank Galina Mariani for her creative and delicious recipe contributions 
to this new edition.  We’d also like to thank the following manufacturers who 
generously donated our very reliable testing grills, grilling equipment, and 
accessories: Weber, Sunbeam, Char-Broil, Ducane, Jackes-Evans, and E-Z Fit 
Barbecue Parts and Accessories. We offer more information about these and 
other equipment manufacturers in Chapter 2.
We owe special, heartfelt thanks to our Project Editor, Kristin DeMint, and 
our Copy Editor, Jessica Smith. Throughout all these months, they kept us on 
track with their tireless devotion, editorial skills, and insightful questions. We 
also thank Acquisitions Editor Stacy Kennedy for her continuous, invaluable 
support and clear-sighted counsel.
And one final note: Marie would like to thank her friend, Ira Bart, who one 
perfect summer day, waved a two-inch-thick steak in front of his personally-
designed brick grill and announced, “Marie, you ought to write Grilling For 
Dummies.” So, we did.

Introduction
I
f your grilling experience is limited to flipping a few burgers on a kettle 
grill or roasting a hot dog on a branch over an open fire when you were a 
kid at camp, you’ve just scratched the surface of what can be a very exciting 
(and somewhat intimidating) way to cook. After all, you’re dealing with an 
open fire, red-hot coals, and a certain amount of danger, not to mention the 
potential embarrassment of burning the heck out of a $10 steak.
What was once a backyard adjunct to the kitchen, the grill has become as 
essential an appliance as an oven, range, or microwave. The popularity of 
grilling shows on TV, the availability of new ingredients, bottled sauces and 
seasonings, and innovations to the grill itself show just how big grilling has 
become.
Grilling has become such a popular American pastime in the last decade that 
many people own two or more grills — a charcoal grill for weekend grilling, 
a gas grill for weeknight grilling, and maybe a hibachi or portable grill for 
tailgate parties or camping. Thus the need for a new edition of the original 
Grilling For Dummies.
Grilling For Dummies, 2nd Edition, takes you through the basics of grilling 
and then shows you the infinite possibilities of this terrific cooking tech-
nique. Even if you’ve done a certain amount of serious grilling out on the 
patio, this book can help you to refine your technique. It also introduces 
you to many foods that you may never have considered suitable for grilling, 
including vegetables and fruits. We also have updated the book to include 
new techniques and more information on grills, accessories, and the ingre-
dients themselves — some of which weren’t even available a decade ago. 
Finally, we try very hard to take the intimidation factor out of the process 
and replace it with a whole lot of fun.
We’ve noticed such a sharp increase in ethnic cooking done on the grill that 
we’ve added a lot more Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Asian recipes 
in this edition. We think it reflects current tastes. But we would love to hear 
from you, the reader, as to what you’re interested in seeing and trying and 
tasting in a world of grilling that no longer starts at Memorial Day and stops 
after Labor Day.

Grilling For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
About This Book
Grilling For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is a book that will make an expert grill 
master out of you — or at least make the exercise painless. But this isn’t just 
a book of recipes or tips on how to buy a grill. The recipes and tips are all in 
here, but the book includes a great deal more.
Grilling has its own jargon and requires its own accessories. So we explain 
everything you need to know and buy to be successful with your grill. Grilling 
has been so popular in the past decade that the market has responded by 
improving features of basic grills and by providing a wider variety of grill 
options. Even though all these new features make the grilling marketplace a 
bit confusing, we ask you to relax because you have this book to help you! 
We show you the differences — and they are numerous and significant — 
among different grills and tell you what you can expect to pay for grills and 
grill accessories.
In the recipe chapters, we discuss the kinds of foods that are great on the grill 
and how to select them. The recipes range from classic to contemporary — 
all perfect for the grill. We give you some quick information in the Part of 
Tens, including ten ways to become a grill master, the ten best barbecue 
places in America, and ten tips on how to throw an outdoor party — which, 
in the end, is the best reason to grill.
We also include a section of color photos that shows you what some of our 
recipes look like. (This section is located in the center of the book.) These 
photos are so mouth-watering that you’ll want to go directly to the recipes 
and start grilling.
You don’t need to read this book straight through. In fact, we’ve deliberately 
arranged it so it works for those who already know a bit about grilling as well 
as for those who are just beginners. Depending on your admitted level of 
expertise, you may want to skip directly to the recipes (see Parts II, III, and 
IV), or you may want to start with Chapter 2 to find out more about the differ-
ences between gas grills and charcoal grills. Go right ahead: Read the book in 
any order you want. That’s why this book looks and reads the way it does.
Conventions Used in This Book
Here are a few guidelines that’ll help ensure your success with the recipes in 
this book:
 
✓ Pepper means ground black pepper unless otherwise specified.
 
✓ All butter is unsalted.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Sugar is granulated unless otherwise noted.
 
✓ All temperatures are Fahrenheit.
In addition to the conventions we follow for the ingredients, we use a few 
other conventions to point out helpful info:
 
✓ We use italic to point out new terms that we define.
 
✓ We use boldface to highlight the keywords in a bulleted list or the 
action parts of numbered steps.
 
✓ We use monofont to point out Web addresses that you may want to 
check out for further information that we don’t dive into here.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars contain extra information, so you don’t have to read them. They do, 
however, often explain some fun technique or issue in more detail, and you 
may find the information helpful. So skip over these paragraphs if you want, 
but know that you may be missing some gold nuggets of additional info if 
you do!
Foolish Assumptions
We’re making certain assumptions about you, the reader, in this book. First 
of all, you obviously have a real interest in good cooking and grilling beyond 
the obvious burgers and hot dogs, so we gear this book toward you, the 
reader who really wants to take a little time to get the best results.
Although we never take our assumptions for granted, we believe that you’re 
well aware of the dangers of working with an open fire. But we still continue 
to stress the safety rules throughout the book. If you wish to skip around this 
book for information, that’s great. But we urge you to read every safety tip 
that you come across.
We keep our recipes as simple as possible in terms of their instructions, but 
we firmly believe that these recipes take grilling several steps higher than 
some of you may have thought possible. Even those with only basic cook-
ing skills shouldn’t have the slightest trouble following any recipe in this 
book. But if you’ve never done much grilling before, go step-by-step through 
our simple, classic recipes for items like steaks and burgers. Then try some 
simple seafood recipes, like a swordfish steak. By the time you master those 
recipes, you’ll be able to reproduce anything in this book.

Grilling For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
How This Book Is Organized
As with all the books in the For Dummies series, Grilling For Dummies, 2nd 
Edition, is arranged for maximum ease of use. We break down subjects into 
simple-to-understand units. We begin with a section we call a part, which is 
further broken down into chapters, within which we cover specific subjects 
and topics, often with lists for handy reference.
Part I: Getting Ready to Show 
the Grill Who’s Boss
In this part, we go over everything you need to know to decide among the 
various kinds of grills on the market, their relative virtues and problems, 
their costs, and what all those grilling terms mean when you’re ready to buy. 
We also provide a checklist of accessories.
This part also shows you the differences among hardwoods, charcoal, bri-
quettes, self-igniting coals, flavoring woods, and any other fuel that makes 
for a good fire. This part also explains how to make a good fire for your par-
ticular intentions, whether you’re grilling fish, barbecued ribs, or kebabs. We 
discuss the strategies of safely starting a fire and maintaining it for maximum 
effect, and then we make some recommendations about the best fire starters 
on the market, from electric coils to metal chimneys.
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life
This is the part where you really start to cook. First, we help you stock your 
pantry with the kinds of foods and seasonings that make for great grilling. 
Anyone can slap a sirloin down on a grill, but this part suggests herbs, spices, 
rubs, and marinades that can add flavor and texture to your grilled foods. 
We also provide some delectable sauces on the side that add measurably not 
just to the grilled foods but to the other ingredients on the plate.
Part III: For the Fanatics of the Classics
Ready, set, grill! In this part, we cover old-fashioned favorites like burgers 
(there’s more to a great burger than buying a frozen patty at the supermar-
ket, you know), hot dogs, kebabs, ribs, and rotisseried foods. In Chapter 9, we 
also explain the distinctions between regular grilling and barbecuing (ribs, in 
particular), which can be easily accomplished at home with a little patience 
and a lot of time.

 Introduction
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun
This part takes you beyond the old-fashioned grilled foods and invites you to 
try a variety of recipes, including those for beef, pork, lamb, and chicken. We 
give you tips about how to buy the best cut for your purposes. This part also 
shows you that the grill is one of the most versatile cooking methods imagin-
able for adding flavor to seafood, vegetables, and even fruits. And if you’ve 
never considered making pizzas or other sandwiches directly over coals, we 
think that you’ll be surprised by the possibilities. We even include recipes 
for some side dishes and our favorite cocktails to serve with the food that’s 
coming off the fire.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We finish the book with some fun information that will make outdoor cooking 
even more enjoyable. Here, you get tips on ten crucial grilling guidelines as 
well as our personal pick of the best barbecue restaurants across the United 
States, where you may pick up a few pointers that even we missed.
At the end of this book, we include an appendix with a Metric Conversion 
Guide to help you quickly translate common abbreviations for cooking mea-
surements and figure out how to change the recipe measurements to metric 
sizes. 
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses icons that alert you to something you may not have thought 
of but that will help make outdoor cooking a lot easier and more pleasurable.

ing, simply go to the chapter that discusses the food you want to prepare. 
Whatever your expertise level, remember that we’ve attempted to make 
everything about grilling as simple to understand as possible. We’ve sprin-
kled plenty of little tricks and bits of advice throughout the book — they’re 
sure to increase your knowledge and expertise as you become more experi-
enced. Our aim is to get you going if you’re just beginning and to make you a 
master if you’re already good at one of the most popular and enjoyable social 
activities that surrounds the enjoyment of good food and friends.

N
othing — not roasting, not frying, not sautéing, and certainly not 
poaching — gives such wonderful, smoky flavor to food as grilling 
does. And because it’s done outdoors, grilling is the most social of cooking 
techniques. For as long as man has known how great foods can taste when 
cooked over an open fire, grilling outdoors has been a social event that 
invites people to participate.
By some strange twist of fate, men seem to take to grilling like ducks to water. 
(Perhaps women have just let men think that they’re better at it!) But we find 
that no matter who’s doing the grilling, everyone has fun. Grilling brings the 
kitchen outdoors and often gathers friends, neighbors, and family members 
around the grill to share stories, watch the fire, and trade recipes.
Grilling over a charcoal fire is perhaps the most interactive of all cooking 
techniques. It demands that you respond like an athlete to the changes of a 
live fire. This intense interaction is one of the aspects of grilling that makes it 
so much fun. You have to play with and master the elements of fire, smoke, 
and heat — and this book shows you how (as well as how to use a gas grill).
But first, in this chapter, we start off with some translation for you — from 
Grill-Speak into everyday language.
Two Key Terms: Direct Grilling 
and Indirect Grilling
In your introduction to the language of grilling, we start you off with the two 
basic methods of grilling — direct and indirect.

10
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
Searing food with direct, no-frills grilling
Direct grilling means that the food is placed on the grill directly over the 
full force of the heat source, whether it’s charcoal, hardwood, or gas. (See 
Figure 1-1.) Just about every food, from meats to vegetables, can be grilled 
directly over fire. Some foods, however, are better cooked over indirect heat, 
a great grilling technique that’s introduced in the following section. Foods 
that are often grilled directly over the heat include hamburgers, hot dogs, 
pork chops, lamb chops, boneless chicken breasts, beef tenderloins, and all 
types of fish and shellfish.
Grilling over direct, intense heat sears the food, coating its exterior with a 
tasty brown crust that’s loaded with flavor. Steamed or boiled foods don’t 
have this flavor advantage, nor do foods that are stir-fried or microwaved. 
The techniques of sautéing, deep-frying, roasting, and broiling create this 
crusty effect, but grilling rewards you with a seared crust and the extra ben-
efit of smoky flavoring that comes from the charcoal, wood chips, or hard-
wood chunks. And unlike sautéing and deep frying, grilling doesn’t cook food 
in a layer of hot fat to produce this sear — you get all the benefits of a rich, 
brown crust with fewer calories.
 
Figure 1-1: 
The place-
ment of 
coals 
depends 
on the type 
of grill-
ing you’re 
doing.
 
Direct grilling — the primary focus of this book — is a fast cooking technique 
that doesn’t require elaborate finishing sauces. Simple marinades (covered in 
Chapter 5), salsas (discussed in Chapter 6), and condiments (also in Chapter 6) 
are all you need to complement directly grilled meat.
 
The primary difficulty with direct grilling is that you must watch your food 
closely to prevent it from burning.
On a charcoal grill, the coals should be spread in a solid layer that extends 
about 1 to 2 inches beyond the edges of the food. In all our recipes, the grill 

11
 Chapter 1: Mastering Grill-Speak
grid — the metal latticework you place the food on — is placed 4 to 6 inches 
from the heat.
We find that most foods are best grilled over medium heat because you have 
more control and end up with a nice brown crust without any nasty charring. 
However, fire temperatures vary according to what’s being cooked. For example:
 
✓ You can sear 11/2-to 2-inch-thick steaks first over medium-high (or even 
high) heat and then finish cooking them over medium heat to end up 
with a crispy, brown crust and a rare to medium-rare center.
 
✓ Pork and chicken require moderate heat to give the interior a chance to 
cook completely. However, these foods can be started on a higher tem-
perature, which gives them a nice crust, and then moved to grill slowly 
over an indirect fire to finish cooking through.
Direct grilling can be done with or without the grill cover. The recipes in 
this book always tell you when to cover the food. Covering the grill instantly 
traps and raises the heat and tends to increase the smoky flavor, especially if 
you’re using wood chunks or chips. However, covering food also can increase 
the chance that you’ll burn or overcook it, simply because you can’t see 
the food. When direct grilling, sometimes it just makes sense to use the grill 
cover. We find that thick bone-in pork chops, for example, grill more evenly 
and better retain their succulence when grilled with the cover down.

When grilling directly in a covered grill, the vents — if you have them on your 
grill — are usually left open. Opening the vents allows more oxygen to enter 
the grill and increases the temperature of the coals. Closing the vents partially 
or totally has the opposite effect. So, if your fire is too hot and is browning 
food too quickly, either remove the cover or try closing the top grill vents.
Staying away from the heat: 
Indirect grilling
Indirect grilling grills foods slowly, off to one side of the heat source, usually 
over a drip pan in a covered grill (see Figure 1-1). If you want to use this tech-
nique, here’s what you do:
 
✓ In a charcoal grill, place the food on the grill grid so that it’s away from 
or to the side of the full force of the heat or fire. Arrange the lit coals 
around the drip pan or bank them to one side of the pan.
 
✓ In a gas grill with two burners, you ignite only one burner and place the 
food over the unlit burner. If your gas grill has only one burner, place 

12
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
the food in an aluminum foil pan or on several layers of foil and grill over 
very low heat. Always preheat your gas grill with all burners on high 
and the lid down for about 15 minutes; then turn one of the burners off 
before cooking indirectly.
 
✓ Whether you’re using a gas or charcoal grill, place a drip pan directly 
under the food. Often you fill the pan with water or another liquid, such 
as broth or apple juice, to add moisture and keep the slow-cooking food 
from drying out.
 
✓ Close the grill lid to cover the grill, trap the heat and smoke, and mimic 
the desirable effects of slow, oven roasting.
 
✓ To collect pan juices (especially with large roasts), place the food in a 
roasting pan and then set the pan on the grill.

When indirectly grilling on a charcoal grill, usually you can partially close 
both top and bottom vents to hold down the intensity of the fire. So be sure 
to clean out the ash catcher underneath a charcoal grill before starting the 
fire. Doing so allows the bottom vents to properly draw air over the coals. 
Remember to dispose of the ashes properly — in a sealed paper bag. The 
ashes are a great fertilizer for some trees and plants as well. (Think about how 
forests restore themselves after a fire.)
Indirect grilling has a multitude of advantages:
 
✓ It slows down the cooking process. How many times have you used 
direct grilling to cook chicken and ended up with skin charred beyond 
recognition and meat that’s practically raw in the center? Indirect grill-
ing takes care of that problem. Food is cooked in a covered grill by heat 
that never directly touches it. Indirect grilling is comparable to oven 
roasting.
 
✓ Indirect cooking actually gives you two types of fires (or two levels 
of heat) in one grill. You have a direct fire that can be used to sear food 
and an indirect fire to cook food slowly and thoroughly. For example, 
chicken, left whole or cut into pieces, can be first seared over the direct 
heat of the fire and then placed on the side over the drip pan without 
any direct heat. You then cover the grill to let the chicken finish cooking.
 
✓ Indirect grilling eliminates the possibility of dangerous flare-ups. Fat 
drips from the food into the drip pan, rather than onto the hot coals, 
lava rocks, or ceramic briquettes.
Indirectly grill any large cuts of meat or whole birds, poultry pieces, pork 
tenderloins, ribs, or large roasts for delicious results. In this book, we use 
the indirect cooking method for the following recipes: Just-Right Pork Ribs 

13
 Chapter 1: Mastering Grill-Speak
(Chapter 9), Whole Game Hens with Asian Flavors (Chapter 14), Brined and 
Grilled Loin O’ Pork, and Curried Pork Tenderloins (both in Chapter 12).
Slow and Smoky: Barbecuing 
with Success
Barbecuing is the technique of indirectly and slowly cooking large cuts of 
meat for a long period of time, over low heat, and with lots of hot smoke. 
Compare this to direct grilling, which cooks small, tender pieces of food at 
higher temperatures for shorter grilling times. You might say that the two 
techniques are almost opposites.
Barbecuing generally takes tough cuts of meat and cooks or breaks down 
connective tissue into tender morsels that practically fall apart. Foods that 
are barbecued often include beef brisket, whole hogs, pork ribs, and pork 
shoulder (which includes two pieces of meat — the Boston butt, which has 
the least amount of bone, and the picnic ham). These foods are perfect for 
barbecuing because they actually demand to be cooked for long periods in 
order to break down their stubborn tissues and release flavor. Fish and vege-
tables can also be barbecued, not to break down their already tender tissues, 
but to add smoky flavor.
 
Depending on the preference of the cook, barbecued food may or may not be 
seasoned. But many barbecuing chefs create elaborate rubs, basting sauces, 
and finishing sauces to enhance the flavor of foods. At your local supermarket, 
you can find a tremendous number of packaged and bottled dry rubs, season-
ings, and marinades specifically for use on grilled and barbecued foods. It’s 
also fun to pick up some of these products while visiting places like Texas, 
Arizona, North Carolina, and Florida for local varieties.
A barbecue pit refers to a solidly built, upright grill apparatus with a deep 
hold for the fuel. The term also can mean an actual pit dug into the ground 
and filled with heated stones, over which the food is cooked, creating a 
steaming process. Most of the smoky flavor you get from using a barbecue pit 
comes not from fat dripping on the coals or coils, but from smoldering wood. 
(Flip to Chapter 3 for more on wood chips and chunks.)
A common kettle charcoal grill can come close to duplicating the effects 
of a barbecue pit. Simply build a small, indirect fire and use a combination 
of good-quality charcoal briquettes and flavored wood chips or hardwood 
chunks.

14
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
 
You have to give the flavored smoke a chance to have an effect. Adding a 
handful of wood chips to a fire when grilling a piece of fish for a few minutes 
won’t have much of an impact. But cooking the same piece of fish slowly and 
indirectly, adding a steady supply of presoaked wood chips as you go along, 
can produce excellent smoky flavor.
A few more techniques can help you turn your covered charcoal grill into a 
mini-barbecue pit. Consider the following:
 
✓ Because the food is cooked indirectly, you’ll need a drip pan under 
the food to catch the drippings. (See Chapter 2 for more on drip pans.) 
If the food requires a long cooking time, more than 30 to 40 minutes, fill 
the pan with water, apple juice, beer, or another flavored liquid to add 
moisture and prevent the food from drying out as it slowly grills.
 
✓ The grill must have a vented hood. Keep the top vents partially closed 
to trap the smoke and decrease the supply of oxygen that fuels the fire. 
Position the lid so that the top vents are opposite the fire and directly 
above the food. This helps to draw the flavored smoke across your food. 
And don’t lift the lid to peek — each time you do so, you release pre-
cious smoke and disrupt the cooking process.
 
✓ Keep a supply of preheated coals next to the grill in a metal bucket. 
Add a few every 40 minutes with long-handled tongs (see Chapter 2) to 
maintain the temperature of the fire. Lift the grill grid gently to add the 
hot coals, or use tongs to insert them into the space near the grid han-
dles. Or add a few fresh briquettes to the edges of the fire every 20 to 30 
minutes. When they’re ashy, move them to the center of the fire.
Even Slower than Barbecuing: Smoking
The technique of smoking food differs from barbecuing because it uses even 
lower heat to slow down the cooking process. Food cooks for hours, and 
becomes infused with hot, aromatic smoke. The cooking temperatures for 
smoking foods range from 180 to 250 degrees. You can choose from two 
methods — dry or wet — and both can be duplicated on your kettle grill. 
However, if you do use your kettle grill, you should place a temperature 
gauge on the grill to monitor and keep the heat within the proper tempera-
ture range.
A 7-pound whole turkey or a 12- to 14-pound ham can take 9 hours or more to 
smoke. A 5- to 7-pound roast beef takes 5 to 6 hours to reach an internal tem-
perature of 140 degrees. At many professional barbecue eateries and stores, 
beef and pork may be smoked for 12 hours or more at a very low heat.

 Chapter 1: Mastering Grill-Speak
Dry smoking
Dry smoking requires indirect cooking in a closed charcoal grill. The food is 
placed on the grill with the lid on top. Then the air vents are adjusted enough 
to lower the flames but still keep enough oxygen inside to allow the fire to 
burn and create smoke. This smoke, in turn, flavors the food while the low 
heat cooks it. The degree of smoking is based on personal taste and the kind 
of food to be cooked. Instead of using your kettle grill, you can buy a dry 
smoker — a contraption that looks like a horizontal barrel and, depending on 
its size, can cook up to 50 pounds of food at one time. The dry smoker has 
two chambers: one for the food, and one that vents heat and smoke into the 
cooking chamber.
 
If you’ve tried smoking but find that the smoke flavor is too intense for your 
taste, cover the food with foil about halfway through the cooking process.
Water smoking
Water smoking, also known as wet smoking, is an alternative to dry smoking. 
This technique involves placing a pan of water in the grill in order to main-
tain the moisture needed for moister, more succulent foods. Water smoking 
is an excellent method for delicate foods such as fish, shrimp, and lobster. It 
also does well with vegetables that would otherwise dry out quickly.
You can buy a water smoker if you don’t want to use your kettle grill. Water 
smokers are now being made by most grill manufacturers, but two companies — 
Brinkmann and Meco — specialize in such equipment. Water smokers come 
in three varieties:
 
✓ Charcoal: This is the most popular and least expensive water smoker; 
however, charcoal must be replenished every hour for long-term cook-
ing. Charcoal water smokers also tend to have peaks and valleys of heat 
as the coals burn down.
 
✓ Electric: This popular type of smoker plugs into an electric socket and 
offers consistent heat.
 
✓ Gas: This is the most expensive type of water smoker, but it’s a cinch 
to use (and you don’t have to be near an electric outlet to use it). A gas 
water smoker also provides consistent heat.
 
Water smoking is a very slow and easy method, but don’t expect a crusty exte-
rior on your food — which, for many people, including us, is the whole point 
of good grilling.

A Whole Mess of Grilling Terms: 
A Griller’s Glossary
To help you wade through the Grill-Speak that you may hear when shopping 
for accessories — or from your neighbor down the street — we compiled the 
following glossary of terms. Use these, and you’ll be a grilling guru in no time!
 
✓ Baste: To brush a seasoned liquid over the surface of food to add mois-
ture and flavor.
 
✓ Brazier: An inexpensive, open charcoal grill with a grid that’s usually 
just a few inches from the coals. A brazier is best for quick grilling. Some 
braziers may have a partial hood or cover to better retain heat. Braziers 
sometimes also come with rotisserie attachments.
 
✓ Ceramic briquettes: These briquettes are made of radiant materials 
and are used in gas grills to transfer heat from the burners and spread 
it evenly under the grill grid. Briquettes made of ceramic don’t burn up 
like charcoal briquettes do. Lava rock and metal plates are an alternative 
to ceramic briquettes. They don’t, however, give the smoky, charcoal 
flavor that many folks crave.
 
✓ Charcoal briquettes: The most common fuel for a live fire, manufac-
tured from ground charcoal, coal dust, and starch. These materials are 
compressed into a uniform, pillow shape and packaged for sale in 5- to 
50-pound bags.
 
✓ Charcoal chimney starter: A metal, cylinder-shaped container that’s 
filled with newspaper and charcoal and used to quickly ignite a 
charcoal fire.
 
✓ Charcoal grill: A grill that uses charcoal as its principal fuel. A charcoal 
grill can be round, square, covered, uncovered, portable, or stationary. 
The most common type is a covered kettle grill.
 
✓ Coal grate: The rack that holds the charcoal in the firebox.
 
✓ Drip pan: A metal pan placed under the food to catch drippings when 
grilling indirectly.
 
✓ Electric grill: An indoor or outdoor grill whose heat comes from electric 
coils.
 
✓ Fire starters: Any number of gadgets or materials, such as the chimney 
starter, electric coil, wax or gel cubes, or compressed wood, used to 
ignite charcoal. (Flip to Chapter 3 for the lowdown on all these fire-
starting gadgets.)

17
 Chapter 1: Mastering Grill-Speak
 
✓ Firebox: The underbelly or bottom of the grill that holds the fire or heat.
 
✓ Flare-ups: Flames caused by fat dripping onto hot coals or lava rock.
 
✓ Gas grill: A grill whose heating source is gas from a propane tank (or 
occasionally, a main gas line).
 
✓ Grid: The latticework of metal rods where you place your food on a grill 
is called a grid, or a grill grid. (Weber confuses things a little by calling 
this area the grate, which everyone else calls the metal piece on which 
the charcoal sits.) One grid is included with every grill.
 
✓ Grill baskets: Hinged, wire baskets that ease the grilling (and turning) 
of sliced vegetables, a delicate piece of fish, burgers, and other foods. 
Chapter 2 has more on accessories.
 
✓ Hibachi: A small, portable, uncovered grill that’s often made of cast-
iron. A hibachi is great for beach or tailgate grilling.
 
✓ Kettle grill: A relatively inexpensive, round charcoal grill with a heavy 
cover. It stands on three legs and is excellent for either direct or indirect 
grilling.
 
✓ Lava rock: This long-lasting natural rock results from volcanic lava and 
is used as an alternative to ceramic briquettes. The irregularly-shaped 
lava rock heats evenly in gas or electric grills. Unlike charcoal bri-
quettes, it can be used over and over.
 
✓ Marinate: To soak food in a seasoned liquid mixture in order to impart 
flavor to the food before it’s cooked. The steeping liquid, often made 
with herbs, spices, oil, and an acidic ingredient like lemon juice or vin-
egar, is called a marinade.
 
✓ Natural lump charcoal: The carbon residue of wood that’s been charred 
in a kiln — usually found in the form of chunks. This is one heating 
source for charcoal grills. Natural lump charcoal gives you the smokiest 
flavor.
 
✓ Roasting: The process of cooking food in a pan in a closed-grill setup. By 
using indirect heat, you can roast an entire prime rib or turkey to perfec-
tion on a grill.
 
✓ Rotisserie rod: The spit or long metal skewer that suspends and rotates 
food over a grill’s heat source.
 
✓ Rub: A concentrated, flavorful blend of dry or wet herbs, seasonings, 
and spices that’s rubbed onto the surface of food before grilling.
 
✓ Sear: To cook food directly above relatively high heat in order to seal in 
juices and impart flavor, a brown color, and a slightly crusty surface.

18
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
 
✓ Smoker box: A small, perforated steel or cast-iron container that’s 
placed directly on the lava rocks or ceramic briquettes of a gas grill. 
This box holds flavored wood chips and provides smoke.
 
✓ Vent: The holes in a grill cover or firebox that open and close like shut-
ters. An open vent increases the oxygen and heat of a fire, while a closed 
vent does the opposite. Some grills don’t have vents.
 
✓ Wood chips and wood chunks: Natural hardwood materials added to 
the fire to impart smoky flavor to food as it grills. Some of the best mate-
rials are hickory, mesquite, and grapevine trimmings.
Looking at a Few Guidelines 
before You Begin
Every cook has his or her preferences, so it’s best to know ours before you 
begin sampling our recipes. Here are some guidelines:
 
✓ All recipe cooking times are just estimates. The wind, temperature of 
the air and the food, and the intensity of the fire all affect, sometimes 
radically, the amount of time needed to grill food.
 
 By testing gas grill thermometers, we’ve found that their temperature 
readings can be off by a great deal. Charcoal grills nearly always burn 
Grilling Web sites to fire you up
If you can pull yourself away from your grill long 
enough, you may enjoy searching the Internet 
for tips and recipes for outdoor cooking. Here 
are some sites to get you started:
 ✓ World Wide Weber (www.weberbbq.
com): The mouth-watering recipes at this 
site will send you scurrying to your grill. 
(And, of course, if you don’t have one, the 
Weber folks tell you all about their products 
here.)
 ✓ About.com (bbq.about.com): This site 
links you to recipes, grilling books, cooking 
magazines, and videos. It also has updates 
on new barbecue and grill products and 
cookers.
 ✓ USDA Guide to Grilling and Smoking Food 
Safety (www.fsis.usda.gov): This 
site doesn’t offer the attractive graphics of 
some other sites, but the information from 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture is a 
good, basic grilling guide. The site contains 
facts on defrosting, marinating, grilling 
away from home, and serving food safely.

 Chapter 1: Mastering Grill-Speak
hotter and cook faster than gas grills. Our best advice is to experi-
ment with your own grill and adjust the cooking times of our recipes 
accordingly.
 
✓ Marinate all foods in the refrigerator in nonmetal or nonreactive con-
tainers like glass or ceramic. Metal may impart an unpleasant flavor to 
the foods. Plus the acids in the food may cause a chemical reaction to 
the metal. Plastic, resealable bags are excellent for this purpose and take 
up less space than dishes. (Flip to Chapter 5 for more on marinating.)
 
✓ Be careful with leftover marinade. Never use leftover marinade as a fin-
ishing sauce unless you thoroughly boil the marinade for 15 minutes to 
kill any possible bacteria picked up from the raw food.
 
✓ Don’t bring food to room temperature. Although some cookbooks say 
to bring your food to room temperature before cooking, with few excep-
tions, we don’t recommend this tip for outdoor cooking. If the tempera-
ture is in the 80s or 90s, foods can spoil quickly.
 
✓ Salt can add tremendous flavor and even a little texture to grilled 
food. The optimum time to salt food is just before you place it on the 
grill. You can add more salt and sprinkle on the pepper (which should 
always be freshly ground) after you remove the food from the grill.
 
✓ Oil your grids. Before preheating a gas grill or building a fire (see 
Chapter 3 for how to do that), brush the grill grid with a vegetable oil, 
such as peanut or corn oil. This step helps to keep the food from stick-
ing unpleasantly to the grill grid. Some grillers find it easier to use a 
nonstick cooking spray. Never brush or spray the grid while the grill is 
heating or after the fire has started, because this can cause dangerous 
flare-ups. The food itself should also be brushed with oil or marinade 
and basted, when necessary.
 
✓ Stay safe! Always read all safety information and every warning icon 
(like this one) in this book. Following the safety advice is absolutely 
essential if you want to have a pleasant grilling experience.

Chapter 2
Buying the Grill of Your Dreams 
(And Accessories to Boot)
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring various types of grills
▶ Considering the many grill features
▶ Deciding which accessories you really need
▶ Cleaning and storing your grill
W
ithout a doubt, the most important grilling decision that you make is 
the type of grill you buy. Regardless of your needs or how you live 
and cook, you can find a grill that’s just right for you. Today, you can buy big 
grills or small; basic grills or those with lots of bells and whistles; grills fueled 
by charcoal, gas, or electricity; or inexpensive grills that meet short-term 
needs or high-quality grills that are long-term investments, serving you well 
for many years.
Gas grills in particular have become more and more sophisticated over the 
last ten years. This increase in sophistication is due to consumer demands, 
which sparked many fancy innovations. Grills these days are not only sturdy, 
compact, and portable, but they’re also crafted in finishes that range from 
shiny stainless steel to easy-to-clean porcelain enamel. And burner controls 
are much more flexible than ever before. You now get a much better, safer, 
more efficient grill for about the same money you would have paid a decade 
ago. And after you choose a grill, you can find an amazing assortment of 
accessories at your local hardware or kitchen store. How can you know what 
kind of grill and accessories will do the best job for you? This chapter helps 
answer that question.

22
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
Choosing the Type of 
Grill You’ll Shop For
Ultimately, your decision to buy a grill depends on a few personal prefer-
ences: where you want to use it (outdoors or indoors), how much food you 
want to cook at one time, how much space you have to store it, how impor-
tant convenience is to you, whether charcoal flavor is important to you, and 
how often you actually plan to use it.
Perusing your options
A gas grill, powered by low-cost propane from a cylinder, stores easily. It’s 
also economically priced (starting around $130), easy to set up, easy to turn 
on, and easy to work with. Gas grills are also very easy to clean and maintain. 
(Figure 2-1 shows a popular type of gas grill.)

 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
A charcoal grill is one that’s fueled by natural lump charcoal or charcoal bri-
quettes and topped with a grill grid. (See this type of grill in Figure 2-2.) Many 
people also think that a kettle grill — a round, deep, metal kettle that’s fueled 
by charcoal or briquettes and topped with a slatted grid (and sometimes has 
a gas igniter) — is synonymous with a charcoal grill, but that’s not always the 
case. Charcoal grills come in all shapes and sizes, but they’re all identical in 
their fuel source. They can range from inexpensive ($30 for small, portable 
models) to expensive (up to $450 for large kettles set into a rolling cart).
 
Figure 2-2: 
Weber’s 
One-Touch

A brazier, sometimes called a hibachi, is really just a portable charcoal-style 
grill with no frills (see Figure 2-3). This type of grill can be round, square, 
or rectangular. It has a rudimentary metal grid on which food is placed, and 
it’s fueled by either charcoal or wood. Its portability is its greatest virtue 
(which makes it great for tailgating), but only if you’re cooking for three or 
four people. That’s because the grill grid is usually quite small. You can find 
these grills for around $20. The term brazier also refers to a pot in which 
foods are cooked with a little liquid, but that’s not what we’re concerned 
with in this book.

Other portable grills have come on the market that are remarkably easy to 
transport and set up in a backyard, a campground, or a tailgate party. They 
even cook with gas, with push button or electronic ignition, and have excel-
lent BTU-per-hour input of up 12,000.
 
Grills that don’t have covers, such as hibachis and portable picnic grills, are 
mainly used for grilling small pieces of food quickly and directly over char-
coal. Smaller grills like these generally don’t have covers because they’re 
for fast grilling, not smoking. Covered grills, on the other hand, give you the 
option of cover-cooking larger cuts of meat and poultry, such as beef roasts 
and whole turkeys, over a slow, indirect fire.
An electric grill makes for clean, convenient grilling. You don’t need to bother 
with charcoal briquettes, wood, or ashes, and you don’t have to refill pro-
pane cylinders. Most electric grills can’t provide the smoky charring and 
flavor that charcoal grills offer, but they’re a great answer for apartment 
dwellers or those who don’t want to deal with a large, outdoor grill. Find 
these at home stores or department stores, usually for $50 to $150.
Comparing the two main types: 
Charcoal or gas?
Because the two most popular grills are vastly different, buyers are faced with 
a difficult question: Should I buy charcoal or gas? If you’re in the middle of this 
great grill debate, don’t worry. The following list, which compares the major 
features of those two basic types of grills, can help you make a decision:
 
✓ Cost: Gas has a much larger initial investment, from $150 up to $5,000 and 
more! Charcoal grills, on the other hand, fall into the $50 to $450 range.
 
✓ Flavor: Because taste is so subjective and personal, the debate will 
continue forever regarding whether charcoal or gas grilling produces 

25
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
superior flavor. Multitudes of taste tests have demonstrated that most 
people can’t tell the difference between the two. However, we disagree 
and want to go on record as believing that, despite the many advances 
in the gas grill industry, a charcoal grill still gives a better — or at least, 
different — flavor than a gas grill.
 
✓ Temperature capabilities: Because consumers have demanded grills 
that can achieve the kind of searing and light char that has in the past 
been possible only at professional steakhouses, BTUs and heat have 
been increased dramatically.
 
 Charcoal grills, for example, can go above 500 degrees, so they cook 
food faster and sear better. The only caveat with these grills is that 
you must watch your food closely. A gas grill usually stays below 500 
degrees, and so food takes longer to cook. However, some gas models, 
including those from Weber, now have embedded burners that can 
reach 900 degrees.
 
 Charring by gas grill is also possible if you get it as hot as possible and 
then grill the steaks or lamb on one side for about 4 minutes to achieve 
searing. Then flip the meat and close the cover, thereby building up 
intense heat. But be very careful to check the meat after just two or 
three minutes. Otherwise that nice light char may have become black 
soot on your steak.
 
✓ Convenience: Convenience is a major factor for most people. Many 
folks are often pressed for time these days, particularly during the week. 
Because grilling has become so popular, 29 percent of Americans nowa-
days own at least two grills — a gas grill to use during the week and a 
charcoal grill for the weekends.
 
✓ Ease of lighting the grill: Gas grills are a snap to light. You simply turn 
on the gas, push the igniter button, and adjust the control to high. Wait 
about 10 minutes, and you’re ready to cook.
 
 Many people would argue otherwise, but we say that charcoal grills are 
not difficult to light. The fact is that charcoal grills are extremely easy to 
light and take only about 30 minutes to reach a medium stage of heat. 
Using a chimney starter can shave another 15 minutes off that time. For 
more information on the starter and other simple and foolproof ways to 
light a charcoal grill, flip to Chapter 3.
 
✓ Ease of maintaining the temperature: Gas grills have adjustable flame 
controls, so turning the heat up or down is as simple as turning a knob; 
they also offer a steady supply of heat. Charcoal grills, on the other 
hand, are more difficult to manage. They usually come with a damper 
control that allows you to adjust the amount of oxygen and therefore 
the amount of heat and fire in the grill, but adjusting the heat to your 
liking takes more attention than a simple turn of a knob. Also, in order to 
maintain the heat if you’re grilling for more than 45 minutes, you have to 
replenish the coals, which can be a bit of a pain.

26
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
 
✓ Practicality for cold winter months: Because a gas grill requires so little 
effort to use, you can grill with it year-round. Building a fire isn’t fun 
when outdoor temperatures drop, so most people are far less inclined to 
grill out during the off-season with a charcoal grill.
 
✓ Ease of grill maintenance: Gas grills are easy to clean and maintain 
because they don’t have the sooty build-up or the ash deposits left by 
a charcoal grill. Charcoal grills, on the other hand, require more scrub-
bing to remove the soot, burned on fat, and ashes.
 
✓ Cosmetic appeal: This one’s a tie. With people spending more and more 
money to spruce up their backyards, you have dozens of attractive grills 
to choose from, whether you’re cooking with charcoal or gas. Grills 
come in all sorts of styles, including high-tech, contemporary, gleaming 
stainless steel, or wonderful bright-colored porcelain enamel. Choose 
from bright red, cobalt blue, or teal. Even painted gas grills come in 
colors like hunter green or burgundy. Handsome carts or cabinets in 
stainless steel or wood finishes add to the sturdiness and beauty that 
will enhance your patio or deck.
There’s also no question that the larger, more expensive gas grills have 
become sexy toys for those who like to really show off their grilling skills. 
When you buy one of these monsters, you pay for finish, cooking area, rotis-
serie attachments, wood chip boxes, lighted controls, and even color. (See 
the following section for more on grill features.)
Bringing the inside out: The ultimate 
grilling experience
As most things in life do, meal preparation is 
circling back to the past — with some serious 
style. Nowadays, increasing numbers of hom-
eowners and builders are taking their kitchens 
back to the great outdoors, making the backyard 
patio the ultimate dining and gathering place.
Outdoor kitchens are similar to their indoor 
counterparts, with the addition of the grill of 
your choosing. They have countertops (made of 
brick or stone), cabinets, stovetops, refrigera-
tors, sinks (fed with a hose or connected to the 
home’s water supply) — you name it. The dif-
ference between the out and the in? Everything 
needs to be waterproof. If you like, you can add 
a shelter — just don’t put it over the grill area.
You have many versatile grill options for an out-
door kitchen. An outdoor fireplace, for example, 
can easily be transformed into a place you can 
cook. A fire pit gives you a place to commune 
around as well as cook over the open flame 
with a rotisserie, skewers, or grill. You might 
even consider adding a brick or stone oven, 
surrounded by plush outdoor sofas and chairs.
Pre-fabricated grills and grill islands are avail-
able from many manufacturers, though you can 
also order them semi-custom or custom-made. 
Many Web sites offer tips on designing and set-
ting up your own outdoor kitchen and also refer 
you to expert resources — HGTV.com, for one, 
has lots of great advice.

27
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
What Do You Have to Offer? 
Looking at Grill Features
Before you rush out to buy a particular grill based on the advice of a best 
friend (or even this book), head to a store that carries an assortment of grills 
from various manufacturers, and spend a few minutes playing with the floor 
models. Here’s list of the grill features you want to pay attention to:
 
✓ Grid size: Whether you choose a gas or charcoal grill, the size of 
the grill’s cooking surface — the grid — is important. Be sure that the 
food grid is between 350 and 400 square inches so you have the option 
of grilling several dishes at a time or feeding a party crowd.
 
✓ Heat intensity capability: BTUs (British thermal units) measure the heat 
intensity of a gas grill. For the average gas grill chef, 22,000 to 50,000 
BTUs is plenty of heat. Don’t be misled into believing that the higher the 
BTU, the better the grill will perform. What’s more important is finding 
out whether the grill burns fuel efficiently; otherwise, you’re wasting gas 
and increasing your fuel costs. Ask your dealer about the fuel-burning 
efficiency of any grill before buying it.
 
✓ Ease of transport: Many portable grills have come onto the market. 
These grills are remarkably easy to transport and set up in a backyard, 
at a campground, or at a tailgate party. They even cook with gas, with 
push button or electronic ignition, and have excellent BTU of up 12,000.
 
You can spend much more for brand-name grills. Be aware, however, that 
brand names are usually sturdier, tested over years of production, and may 
have better warranties than an unknown brand you buy at the local hard-
ware store. The top-of-the-line grills can sell for well over $2,000, in which 
case you’re paying for extras like burnished steel or ceramics, extra drawers, 
higher BTUs, attached rotisseries, and other things you may not need.
 
Buying a grill that suits your style and needs is a little like buying a car, 
except, unfortunately, you can’t take it out for a test drive. So before you buy 
the grill of your dreams, make sure you assess the quality of it by doing the 
following:
 
✓ Stand before the grill and lift up its hood. Does it seem sturdy and dura-
ble or cheap and flimsy?
 
✓ If it’s a gas grill, do the knobs turn easily? Does it have two burners so 
you can use the indirect cooking method?

The most common basting brush is brush-shaped, sometimes with an angled 
brush head, and is useful for all kinds of basting. However, it’s most often 
used for light basting sauces. The most important virtue of such a brush is its 
length; look for ones at least 16 inches long so you can baste while the food is 
on the grill.
The bristles on a brush should be fairly pliable and extend at least 3 inches 
from the end of the handle. You don’t need to spend much on a good brush, 
but don’t spend too little either; otherwise it will fall apart quickly. Between 
$5 and $8 is a good range to look for.
A basting mop, sometimes called a Texas-style barbecue brush, is just that — a 
little cotton mop for quickly slathering on thick sauce. When soaked with bar-
becue sauce, this brush isn’t likely to catch on fire, but be attentive anyway.
Cleaning brush
The only tool you need for cleaning your grill grid is a good, stiff wire brush. 
You can find these at most hardware stores. A stiff brush does a better job 
than any scraper, but many cleaning brushes have a self-contained scraper 
on the top that allows you to scrape off the really tough grime that may build 
up over time.
Oil your grid before grilling to alleviate the elbow grease needed to remove 
the cooking grease. But here’s the easiest way to clean a grill grid: Attack the 
grid with a cleaning brush right after the meal, while the grid is still warm. It’s 
more difficult to scrape away bits of food after the grill has cooled down.
A small, crumpled-up ball of aluminum foil makes a handy improvisational 
tool for scrubbing down the grill grid when you can’t find your wire grill 
brush. A nylon or plastic scouring pad, sponge, and a pail of soapy water can 
also help with a thorough cleaning of the grill, inside and out. Never, ever use 
a wire brush or oven cleaner to clean the exterior of a grill — it can damage 
the finish.
Fork and knives
A good knife isn’t nearly as important as a good fork when you’re grilling. And 
a good fork isn’t nearly as important as a long fork — 16 inches or more — 
with a wooden handle and two tines.

When moving around large pieces of meat — such as roasts — with a grill 
fork, try not to pierce the meat too deeply. By the same token, be careful not 
to spear the meat too delicately that it falls off and causes flare-ups.
Given the fact that much of what comes off your grill (slabs of meat, ribs, 
or sausage) needs to be cut, invest in a good, heavy-handled, well-balanced 
carving knife, curved butcher’s knife, or chef’s knife.
Knives may seem like the most obvious of utensils, but the availability of 
more (and sharper) knives makes the choice more appealing than ever. 
The innovations have come in terms of design and balance. Today’s knives 
let cooks chop, slice, shave, and dice easily, and they keep their keen edge 
better because of the harder steel that’s used. Nevertheless, you still need 
to invest in a knife stone and steel to keep your knife at its cutting edge. The 
stone is used to sharpen the knife, and the steel keeps the edge keen and the 
same width all along the blade.
 
Asian cleavers are excellent for cutting vegetables, but they take some expe-
rience when used with meat. The new ceramic knives we have found are 
pretty, but they lose their edge quickly and break far more readily than you 
may imagine. There are also now very beautiful sets of steak knives, based on 
steakhouse models, which have a thick wooden grip and serrated edges with 
which to cut through meat on the plate.
Grill cover
A grill cover protects your grill from rain, wind, and heat, which in turn prolongs 
its life. Made from vinyl and cloth, grill covers come in all shapes and sizes to 
fit over the top of the grill. Just be sure to purchase one that fits your particular 
grill and always give the grill time to cool down completely before covering it.
Grilling mitt
We can’t stress enough the importance of a good grilling mitt. A dish towel 
or fireproof pot holder just doesn’t give you the protection you need to grill 
safely. The mitts should be flexible and should allow you to pick pots, pans, 
skewers, and other items off the grill with ease.
A mitt also should be long enough to reach past your elbow — the longer the 
better, at least 15 inches — and have a flame-retardant coating. Long-lasting, 
sturdy mitts start at about $7 and can run as high as $20. If you can afford it, 
pay a bit extra to get a fully insulated, thick pair with a thumb.
Skewers
Skewers are wonderful grill accessories that allow you to cook and easily turn 
foods like kebabs and satays. (Check out Chapter 8 for some outstanding kebab 

31
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
and satay recipes.) They should be between 15 and 18 inches long. Skewers 
that are 6 to 8 inches long, however, are perfect for cocktail party kebabs.
Bamboo skewers are popular and do a good job when you’re grilling kebabs. 
Before using them, soak them in water for a half hour so the ends don’t catch 
fire.
 
Metal skewers come in many beautiful configurations now, and because they 
usually have a small handle on the end, they’re easy to turn. Be very careful, 
however, because those handles can heat up every bit as hot as the parts that 
touch the fire. Always use mitts to handle them!
Spatula
We never get tired of repeating ourselves on the issue of length: Use a spatula 
that’s 15 to 18 inches long from the tip of the handle to the end of the blade. 
And be sure that the spatula you use has a handle that’s made of wood or 
another insulating material. Also, be sure not to use the following for grilling 
purposes:
 
✓ A Teflon or nonstick kitchen spatula that’s used to flip pancakes — it 
may burn or melt.
 
✓ An outdoor metal spatula with a metal handle. The handle will transfer 
heat to your hand.
 
✓ A long spatula that’s usually used to spread icing on a cake. Such a tool 
is completely useless at a barbecue because it’s too thin and flexible to 
hold a heavyweight piece of meat, poultry, or fish.
Thermometer and temperature gauge
One of the single biggest challenges faced by inexperienced — and even 
many experienced — grillers is turning out food that’s moist, juicy, and 
cooked to perfection, both inside and out. A good food thermometer, which 
tells you the temperature inside the food being cooked, can solve this prob-
lem for you. Some models even speak to you when something is at the right 
temperature!

The simplest, quickest, and most dependable way to test the doneness of 
food on the grill is what professional chefs use — a cake tester, which is used 
to indicate when the center of a cake is done. This tool is nothing more than 
a metal needle with a plastic handle that you insert into the thick part of the 
food on the grill for about 5 seconds then remove. You then — carefully! — 
touch the tester to your chin or lips to get an idea of the temperature. If the 
food isn’t cooked through, the needle will be cool; if it’s medium-rare, it will be 
warm; and if it’s quite hot, it’s well-done.

32
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
You also can use a thermometer to get the exact temperature of a piece of 
meat. You can find two basic types of thermometers for use on a grill (see 
Figure 2-4):
 
✓ Stainless steel insert thermometer: This heat-resistant thermometer 
that you use for a roast in an oven works effectively on a grill, too. To 
use this thermometer, insert the stainless steel spike into the meat at 
the beginning of the cooking process. Throughout cooking, the ther-
mometer registers the temperature on the glass-faced dial. This ther-
mometer is intended only for foods that allow you to place the probe 
at least 2 to 21/2 inches into the grilled food. It isn’t intended for use on 
steaks, chops, chicken breasts, or other thin food.
 
✓ Instant-read thermometer: This type of thermometer does exactly what 
it says; that is, you can insert it into the meat at any moment and get — 
you guessed it — an instant reading! Thus, it’s our favorite. You must 
immediately remove the thermometer, however. Some models display 
digital numbers, and they come in two forms: a standard digital ther-
mometer with bigger buttons and display, or the tinier version, a pocket 
thermometer. You don’t have to buy an instant-read thermometer that’s 
digital, but if you do, be sure that the numbers are easy for you to read.
A temperature gauge tells you the temperature inside the grill itself. Just 
about all gas and electric grills now have built-in temperature gauges, but 
kettle and other charcoal-fueled grills usually don’t. You may find it worth-
while to buy a temperature gauge to set within the kettle, especially for 
closed-lid grilling and smoking. You can monitor cooking times much more 
easily this way.

Tongs
Outside on the patio, tongs are essential equipment for turning foods on the 
grill. Tongs are a better choice than a long fork because you can flip food 
over without piercing it (which can let out the juices). They also allow you to 
maneuver most foods better than a spatula does.
 
Keep length in mind when buying tongs. Never use short, overly flexible ice 
tongs at the grill. A good pair of grilling tongs should be between 15 and 18 inches 
long, and they must have a wooden or insulated grip (hot metal burns!).
Torch light
When twilight falls and the shadows creep across the grill, you can’t see 
what you’re cooking, and you certainly can’t see the degree of doneness of 
the food. Torch lights come in very handy at this point. Torch lights are poles 
atop which a lamp, fueled with oil or other fuel, is set. They can be stuck in 
the ground almost anywhere. You also can set them permanently in concrete. 
They come in all sizes and price ranges, and they always add a lovely flicker 
to a dinner after dark.
Water bottle
Keep a water bottle equipped with a spray nozzle close at hand to douse 
occasional flare-ups of flames and to lower the heat on a fire that has become 
too hot. You can also spritz rotisserie grilled food with water (or other liquid) 
to retain moisture as the food rotates on the spit. You don’t need anything 
fancy — a spray bottle of any kind will do. But do make sure it shoots out 
a fine spray of water so you don’t extinguish the fire by spraying too much 
water on the wood or coals.
Work table
Even fancy grills with optional side tables don’t provide enough space for 
your grilling chores. Set up a small table next to your grill for food, platters, 
and grilling tools.
Surveying tools and toys 
for the serious griller
As you move into grilling guruhood, you may find yourself searching for more 
advanced tools than those in the previous section. If so, this section is for 
you. In the following sections, we describe all those fancy grilling toys that 
folks use when they fall hard for grilling.

34

Baskets
We are really big believers in hinged, wire, grilling baskets of every kind. 
Numerous shapes and sizes are available for every conceivable ingredient. 
Baskets are a real aid for grilling delicate pieces of fish and shellfish and for 
small pieces of food that aren’t skewered and would otherwise fall through 
the grid. You can also use baskets to more easily turn onion rings and thinly 
sliced meat. We think that you can get away with a few basic baskets (see 
Figure 2-5). Consider the following:
 
✓ Boxlike baskets are good for just about any ingredient that’s large 
enough not to fall through the basket.
 
✓ A fish-shaped basket is ideal for a whole fish. Easy to turn, this basket 
keeps the flesh intact without adhering to the skin and produces a beau-
tifully cooked fish. Figure 2-6 shows a fish-shaped basket.
 
✓ Other flat baskets are built to hold hamburgers, chicken, sausages, 
shrimp, and most fish fillets. (Steaks, lamb chops, and barbecued ribs 
are better when they’re turned individually on the grill grid rather than 
locked into a basket.)
 
When purchasing a grilling basket, look for one with a handle that’s long 
enough to extend well beyond the grilling surface. Because the baskets stand 
on the grill for several minutes at a time, the heat from the grill transfers to 
the basket handles (even if they’re long), so always use a mitt when removing 
them. Baskets range in size and price. Most are made of steel and are designed 
not to be flexible. (You don’t want to carry a flapping basket of fish or chicken 
from grill to table.) You can buy them at the hardware store for around $10.
 
Figure 2-5: 
Baskets are 
excellent 
for turning 
many pieces 
of food at 
one time.
 
Grill topper
A grill topper — sometimes called a perforated grid, fish grid, or delicate 
foods grid — is a porcelain grid with holes about half the size of a dime. (See 
Figure 2-7.) Place it on the grill grid (the one that comes with your grill, where 

35
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
you normally place the food) when you want to cook small foods (such as 
shrimp, scallops, delicate fish, mushrooms, and cut-up vegetables) that would 
otherwise fall into the fire. A grill topper makes it simple to turn delicate 
food. Lightly coating the food with oil makes the food even easier to turn.

baskets

ing whole

Grill toppers come in several different sizes, so consider the size of your total 
cooking surface before selecting one. After all, you may want room to cook 
other foods on the regular grid at the same time. Prices range from $15 to $30.

Vegetable holder
The vegetable holders that we’ve seen are little more than bent metal 
wires that hold potatoes and ears of corn upright on the grill (see Figure 
2-8). These gadgets allow vegetables to bake more slowly, without getting 
scorched. Basically, they allow you to be a bit less attentive than you would 
be if you placed your vegetables directly on the grid.
Rib rack
A rib rack, shown in Figure 2-8, is a lattice of metal rods that are arranged 
into a “U” shape, into which the ribs and other meats can be placed and kept 
slightly elevated above the heated grid. A rib rack allows you to cook more 
food on one grill.
 
When purchasing a rib rack, make sure that the metal rods are sturdy and that 
the rack doesn’t wobble on the grill.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Vegetable 
holders and 
a rib rack

for grilling.
 
Drip pan and charcoal divider
A drip pan, shown in Figure 2-9, is a shallow pan placed under the grid that 
catches the drippings from the meat that’s cooking on the grill. You can buy 
inexpensive disposable aluminum foil pans at the supermarket, or you can 
use a shallow metal rectangular baking pan (which is a bit messier to clean 
up afterwards). You can also make a drip pan out of heavy-duty aluminum 
foil. Simply fold up the edges of the foil to give it sufficient sturdiness.

In a gas grill, set the pan directly on the lava rock or ceramic briquettes under 
the meat to be grilled. In a charcoal grill, place the pan on the charcoal grate 
with coals banked to one side or placed on either side of the pan and the meat 
directly over it.
When using a drip pan on a charcoal grill, use a charcoal divider (shown 
in Figure 2-10). This metal divider holds the charcoal firmly in place so it 
doesn’t tumble into the drip pan (which is shallow). Even though this gadget 

37
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
isn’t an absolute necessity, a charcoal divider — sometimes called a rail or 
char-basket fuel holder — is a good investment.

Smoker box
A smoker box (see Figure 2-11) is quite handy and very simple to use. It’s noth-
ing more than a lidded, heavy metal box with holes to allow smoke to pour 
from burning wood chips (and, sometimes, a few aromatic herbs) that you’ve 
placed inside. A smoker box is an easy way to add smokiness to your foods.
 
If you use wood chips with a gas grill, a smoker box is a must, because it keeps 
the ashes from clogging the burner. If you’re using a charcoal grill and want 
a smoky flavor without buying a smoker box, you can make a smoker pouch. 
Figure 2-12 shows you how.

Side burner
One accessory we highly recommend for anyone who wants to do more than 
simple grilling is an attachable side burner. On pricier grills, they’re standard, 
but you can buy one for your existing grill, too. These handy accessories (for 
gas grills only) allow you to do just about anything on the grill that you can 
do on a burner in your kitchen — from sautéing to sauce making. They’re 
great for reheating foods, too. They’re even pretty simple to hook up. Side 
burner prices start at about $70.
Motorized rotisserie
We cover the subject of rotisseries in depth in Chapter 10, but we want to 
mention here that they’re a useful accessory that every serious grill cook 
should consider. Some of the more expensive gas grills have built-in rotisser-
ies, while others allow for rotisseries to be purchased as attachments.
The purpose of a rotisserie is to allow slow, even cooking that’s especially 
good for doing roasts, whole chickens, and even ribs. Rotisseries are handy, 
too, because you don’t have to tend them constantly; just baste the food 
occasionally with a marinade or sauce.
Ash can
Yes, the grill industry actually sells special cans in which you’re supposed 
to put your spent charcoal ashes, called, fittingly, ash cans. An ash can may 

39
 Chapter 2: Buying the Grill of Your Dreams (And Accessories to Boot)
have come in especially handy in the nineteenth century when people used 
wood and coal for their hearths and fireplaces. These days, you use them to 
cart away ash residue after your grill fire is out. This is different from an ash 
catcher, which attaches under the body of a charcoal kettle grill.
Caring for Your Grill
The outer units of most grills carry a lifetime guarantee, but that shouldn’t 
stop you from keeping your grill oiled, clean, and stored properly. These 
tasks are essential to a long, happy grill life.
Oiling the grids
Keeping your grill grid lightly oiled improves your grilling in two ways:
 
✓ Prevents food ingredients from sticking while you’re cooking
 
✓ Makes grid clean-up easier after each meal
 
To oil your grill grids, you just wipe a little vegetable oil on them with a soft 
cloth. Or you can use one of those aerosol vegetable oil sprays. But only spray 
these on a cold — never a hot — grill.
We would be less than honest if we didn’t mention that replacement grids 
are pretty cheap — about $15 to $20 at any good hardware store. So it’s defi-
nitely worthwhile to replace the grid at the beginning of spring. That way, 
you don’t have any old dirt, residue, or rust on the grill when you go to use it.
Cleaning the grill inside and out
Grills can last a lifetime if you take good care of them. Here are some pointers:
 
✓ After each use, use a wire brush to clean off the food particles remain-
ing on the grid. Close the lid of the grill and, if you have a gas grill, turn 
up the heat for about 10 minutes to burn off any excess food remaining 
on the grid. Some grillers believe that leaving the grill overnight is a 
good idea because the residue protects the grill from rust. If you do that, 
be sure to clean the grill just before using it the next time.
 
✓ Periodically clean the grids with a solution of warm, soapy water. 
Use nylon or plastic woven pads to avoid damaging the grid. You can 
use nonabrasive scouring powder on stubborn stains if you want, but 
remember that a small amount of grease left on the grids helps preserve 

40
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
the metal — it will burn off the next time you use the grill. Cast-iron 
grids should be seasoned after cleaning by applying a light coating of oil.
 
✓ Clean the interior of the grill with the same soapy solution as the grid 
or use a can of aerosol grill cleaner. Scour with a scrub brush and then 
rinse with water and air dry. Never use anything but soapy water on the 
exterior of the grill because a cleaner may damage the paint or porcelain.
 
✓ Unclog the burners periodically. Your grill won’t work properly if the 
burners become clogged, so if you see an uneven flame, remove the burner 
and clean the ports with a wire. You can also force water through the 
removed burner until you’re sure that it’s coming through each hole. If 
the burners rust to the point of showing cracks or breaks, buy new ones.
 
✓ Replace lava rock and ceramic briquettes as needed. Lava rocks or 
ceramic briquettes get extremely greasy and contribute to flare-ups. 
Depending on how often you grill, you should turn them over peri-
odically. Because they’re quite inexpensive, replace the lava rock or 
briquettes at least once every 12 to 18 months (perhaps more often if 
you’re a frequent griller). Doing so ensures better grilled dishes.
Storing your grill
Most people like to grill year-round, regardless of the weather. But, if you 
decide to pack your grill away for the coldest winter months, you certainly 
can. Be sure to thoroughly clean your grill before storing it. If you have a gas 
grill, make sure that the gas lines are completely and tightly closed off and 
that the gas cylinder is removed.
Many grill manufacturers sell heavy plastic covers specifically to fit their 
grills; these are a good, inexpensive investment because they keep dust and 
dirt from getting on or into your grill.
 
If storing your grill indoors, always remove the propane cylinder and store it 
outside in a cool, shaded spot. Never, under any circumstances, store a pro-
pane cylinder inside your home or garage. It could be deadly.

Chapter 3
To Build a Fire
In This Chapter
▶ Preparing for the maiden cookout
▶ Choosing your fuel source
▶ Selecting a fire starter for your grill
▶ Keeping your heat under control
C
hances are that if your food turns out perfect, your fire was perfect, too. 
This chapter shares the fine points of getting your fire — whether it’s in 
a gas grill or charcoal grill — to burn the way it should for maximum results. 
In this chapter, we discuss the various kinds of fuel, fire-starting accessories, 
and fire-lighting tools for your grill.
Getting Your Grill Ready for Use
“Safety first!” should be the guiding principle whenever you’re grilling. You’re 
going to be dealing with a fire hazard unless you take strict precautions from 
the moment you light the coals or turn on the gas, so please pay attention 
and read through this chapter carefully before beginning to cook.
 
Where you place your grill can affect its efficiency and your safety. Placement 
depends on how much room you have and how massive your grill is. But here 
are some general rules:
 
✓ Unless the grill is electric (which is made for indoor use), use the grill 
outdoors only! Never grill in your trailer, tent, house, garage, or any 
enclosed area.
 
✓ Place the grill away from anything — and we mean anything — that 
could possibly be flammable: piles of leaves or dry grass; structures 
of any kind; gasoline and any machines containing gasoline, especially 

42
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
automobiles; paint and aerosol cans; newspapers; awnings; children’s 
toys; and trees.
 
✓ If you place the grill on a wooden deck, it’s a good idea to use a deck 
protector under the grill. You can find one at most hardware stores.
 
✓ Don’t place your grill in the path of strong winds, which may tend to stir 
up the embers and make them fly.
 
✓ Stay close to your kitchen for easy access to platters, utensils, and food.
 
✓ When grilling at night, place the grill near a light source.
 
After you’ve placed your grill in a safe spot, you’re ready to get started with 
your first grill-out. But as you’re preparing to light the grill, be sure to follow 
these hard-and-fast rules about gas grill safety prior to ignition:
 
✓ Periodically check the tubes leading from the propane cylinder to the 
grill. Make sure they’re securely attached and free of blockages such as 
grease, insects, or cobwebs.
 
✓ Make sure that hoses aren’t cracked, and examine them for holes.
 
✓ If you smell gas, don’t attempt to light the grill.
 
✓ Keep all lighted cigarettes and matches away from the propane cylinder.
 
✓ Propane cylinders can, over several years, rust. If you notice any rusting 
(which may indicate a hole developing in the skin), get rid of it and buy 
a new one. You can return the cylinders to the place where you bought 
them to have them refilled or recycled.
 
Always thoroughly check out the entire system of a gas grill after a winter’s 
storage.
Fueling a Hunk of Burnin’ Fire
For gas grills, choosing a fuel source is easy — that propane cylinder attached 
to the grill is your only option, unless your grill is built specifically to hook up 
to the main gas line from your house. Charcoal grill owners, however, have 
two options for their heating source: natural lump charcoal and charcoal bri-
quettes. I discuss the options in the following sections. I also show you how to 
enhance your grilling flavor by adding hardwood chips or chunks.
Using propane with your gas grill
Your most important decision as a gas grill owner will be when to replace the 
propane cylinder. You can tell the cylinder is low with three different methods:

43
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
 
✓ Weigh the cylinder. This is the simplest method. A full cylinder weighs 
approximately 38 pounds. An empty one weighs about 18 pounds. So 
if it weighs in at about 28 pounds, your supply is about half empty. Of 
course, if you’re an optimist, it’s half full.
 
✓ Use a gauge that measures the level of fuel remaining. A gas cylinder 
usually doesn’t come with a gauge, but you can purchase one at any 
hardware store for about $10 to $15. They’re portable, and they can 
easily, without tools, hook up to any cylinder and tell you how much fuel 
is left in your cylinder. Make sure you look for the label “UL Approved.”
 
✓ Use Accu-Level Tape, which works sort of like litmus paper. You stick 
the cellophane-like tape to the outside of the cylinder. When you pour 
boiling water over the tape, it shows you the level of propane left in the 
tank by changing color at the level where the propane has been used up. 
The tape costs about $3 and is available wherever propane tank supplies 
are sold.
Going with the old standard: 
Charcoal briquettes
Charcoal briquettes, shown in Figure 3-1, are made from powdered charcoal 
that has been compressed, bound with coal dust and starch, and formed into 
a uniform little brick. Briquettes don’t burn as intensely as natural lump char-
coal, but they can be much easier to control. They give a hot, even heat, and, 
because of their uniform size, they give you consistent results. You’ll always 
know you’re working with a predictable fuel source!
 
Figure 3-1: 
Charcoal 
briquettes 
are uniform 
in shape; 
not so for 
natural lump 
charcoal.
 
 
To find the best briquettes, you have to do some sleuthing among the brands 
available in your markets. Try buying different brands a few times and keeping 
track of how they perform. You may notice that some burn more quickly than 
others, which means that they provide a less consistent heat and you need 

44
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
more of them. You may find store brands that are as efficient as some of the 
more familiar brands, like Kingsford. It won’t take long to discover which ones 
you like best. And don’t forget that the briquettes should be uniform in size — 
not crumbly — or you lose a good portion in the bag before you even set them 
in your grill.
You can step up to still more convenience with fire-starter briquettes, which 
are simply briquettes to which charcoal lighter fluid has already been added. 
You can place a few of these in with your regular briquettes for fast, easy 
lighting or cook with them exclusively. We don’t recommend them as the sole 
source of heat for longer term grilling, however. That’s because they tend to 
burn more quickly and require frequent replenishment. You should reseal 
the bag tightly after removing briquettes or the lighter fluid will evaporate, 
leaving you with plain-old briquettes!
The ultimate in convenience is light-the-bag briquettes, which contain just enough 
fuel for a single fire. There’s no fuss or muss, because you simply place the 
bag in the grill and touch a match to the corner of the bag. Then, as with regu-
lar briquettes, wait until they’ve reached an ashy gray color to start cooking.
Grilling like a pro with 
natural lump charcoal
Natural lump charcoal, which is shown in Figure 3-1 in the preceding section, 
results when hardwoods — such as maple, oak, and hickory — are burned at 
super-high temperatures. The wood breaks down, dries out and, after hours 
of roasting, comes out ebony and almost weightless. The result is a clean-
burning fuel, with a price — natural lump charcoal costs considerably more 
than the familiar briquettes. You may have to call around to find a reliable 
vendor as well.
Natural lump charcoal is an excellent fuel source because it lights more quickly 
than charcoal briquettes and burns much hotter at the start. The temperature 
is always changing with natural lump charcoal. It starts out very hot, peaks 
quickly, and then drops rapidly. This intense initial heat results in quick sear-
ing, which imparts a bit more flavor to the food. For this reason, professional 
grillers and barbecue pitmasters prefer it to any other kind of fuel.
 
However, if you’ve never cooked with natural lump charcoal, keep these tips 
in mind:
 
✓ A natural charcoal fire sparks and snaps, which may initially scare you, 
but there’s no need for alarm, because these special effects are perfectly 
normal.

45
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
 
✓ Because natural lump charcoal burns very fast, your food cooks much 
faster than with briquettes. You’ll find out through trial and error how 
hot your grill gets using differing amounts of charcoal, so your cooking 
time will vary. But assume that lump charcoal will take 5 to 10 minutes 
less time to cook than food on a gas grill. But again, this depends on the 
temperature you maintain in the grill by using more or less charcoal.
Adding hardwood chips or chunks
If you’re lucky enough to have access to a natural supply of old hickory, oak, 
or fruit-tree wood, it will serve as an excellent supplemental fuel or flavoring 
for outdoor cookery. If you aren’t so lucky, you can pick up commercial bags 
of hardwood for grilling at a nearby hardware store or grilling-supply store.
The appeal of hardwoods as supplements to briquettes is that they add an 
intensely smoky flavor that enhances the fairly subtle smokiness that comes 
from charcoal. They make the fire burn more intensely, which is a virtue 
when you want high heat for searing and quick cooking. They also burn 
longer, which means you don’t have to replenish them as often.
Considering your options
You have two types of hardwood to choose from — chips or chunks — and 
the one you choose depends on what’s available in your area. Chips light and 
burn more quickly, while chunks retain their heat more consistently.
Flavoring your food with hardwood
Here are some hardwood varieties that we think 
work particularly well on the grill:
 ✓ Apple is very good with poultry.
 ✓ Alder provides a nice delicate flavor when 
used with seafood.
 ✓ Cherry is wonderful with game birds.
 ✓ Hickory is essential for real pork barbecue.
 ✓ Mesquite has a strong flavor that’s great for 
big red meats like beef and venison.
 ✓ Maple is fine wood to use for ham and pork.
 ✓ Pecan works best for poultry and seafood.
One good source for ordering hardwoods is

Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
Because chips burn very quickly, you want to use them when you’re grilling 
food slowly in a covered grill. Grilled fish’s delicate flesh quickly absorbs 
the smoke from chips, so you don’t need a lengthy cooking time to reap the 
benefits of the wood chips. Chips also are easy to use; they simply require 
presoaking in water for 15 to 30 minutes to keep them from burning up too 
quickly.
 
Wood chips and chunks can ignite into flames on the grill; read your manual 
for specific information on how to use them safely with your grill.
Including hardwood in a charcoal grill
For charcoal grills, scatter the presoaked wood chips — a handful or two 
will do — over the charcoal briquettes after the coals turn ashy gray, or 
just before you’re ready to cook. When the chips burn out, or when the 
smoke stops pouring from the cover vents, you can add another handful as 
a replacement. Don’t overdo it though — the chips may smother the glowing 
coals.
If you’re using wood chunks, you can mix half a dozen or more chunks into 
a charcoal briquette fire. However, wood chunks take a few minutes longer 
to burn than charcoal does. To keep the chunks from scorching your food, 
ignite them a few minutes before the charcoal. Or try igniting them with the 
charcoal and then spritzing them lightly with water. Another solution is to 
start the coals and chunks together and, when the charcoal is ashy gray, 
move the chunks to the edges of the fire so they surround and barely touch 
the coals. This way, the chunks produce just what you want — a steady 
supply of smoke without any flame.

For a more intense, smoky flavor, you can build a fire entirely with wood 
chunks, which don’t require presoaking; however, you’ll probably have a hard 
time controlling the fire because the chunks burn so intensely. In addition, 
your wallet may suffer because the chunks are expensive.
Smoking with hardwood on a gas grill
You can add light, smoky wood flavoring to food when cooking with a gas 
grill. Both chips and chunks are appropriate. Increasingly, gas grills offer 
built-in smoking drawers or boxes to hold hardwood. Only a handful of chips 
is necessary to do the job; use more and the smoky flavor will be too harsh.
If your gas grill doesn’t have a built-in smoking drawer or box, you can still 
get the wood flavor you want if you do one of the following:
 
✓ Place presoaked chips in a small foil pan or wrap them in heavy-duty 
aluminum foil. Poke holes in the foil to allow the smoke to escape, and 
place the pan or packet directly on lava rocks or ceramic briquettes (see 

47
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
Chapter 2 for further instructions on making these smoker pouches). The 
heat of the grill will cause the wood to smolder and smoke. After the grill 
has cooled, simply remove the pan or packets and discard. (Douse the 
chips with water before throwing them out if they’re still smoldering.)
 
✓ Purchase a small steel or cast-iron container, called a smoker box (see 
Chapter 2), to hold the presoaked chips. You place it directly on the 
heat source.
Arranging the Coal to Suit Your Fancy
When getting your grill ready for showtime, you have two things to consider 
if you’re using charcoal: how much to use and how to arrange it. Many people 
use far too much natural lump charcoal or far too many briquettes in their 
grill. The number of briquettes needed depends on the size of fire you wish 
to create, which is in turn dependent on how much food you’re cooking.
When arranging the coals, you need to decide whether you’re grilling directly 
or indirectly (Chapter 1 covers those fundamentals so you can decide which 
method you’ll use or whether you’ll use both). Use these general guidelines 
to arrange these coals after you decide what type of grilling you’ll do:
 
✓ If you’re grilling directly, a single layer of coals should extend 1 to 2 
inches beyond the food being cooked. Pour the briquettes into the grill 
and spread them out to determine how many you need; 30 briquettes 
will grill about a pound of meat. Count on an average of 21/2 pounds of 
charcoal for grilling meat directly over the coals. After you figure out 
how much you need, stack the coals in a pyramid in the center before 
lighting. When most of the coals begin to burn, spread them out in an 
even layer. To keep the fire and temperature going, you may need to 
replenish the coals as they burn down.
 
✓ If you’re grilling indirectly, start with about 25 briquettes (give or take, 
depending on the size of your grill — 25 works well for a 221/2-inch kettle 
grill) on either side of the grill. Add eight briquettes to each side every 
45 minutes.
 
✓ If you’re grilling both directly and indirectly (for foods that need 
longer, slower cooking), simply set up the coal for an indirect fire, place 
the meat directly over the coals initially to brown and crisp the skin, and 
then move the meat over to the side of the grill that doesn’t have coals. 
Moving the coals allows you to finish cooking the food more slowly and 
thoroughly. Note: You may or may not be using a drip pan (see Chapter 
2); a drip pan is useful when you’re grilling especially fatty meats like 
roast or duck.

Let There Be Flames: Igniting Your Grill
If you’re using a gas grill, you’re in luck — one major advantage of these grills 
is that they’re so easy to light. Today nearly all of them come with an auto-
matic ignition. Check the manual that came with your grill before trying to 
light it but, after that, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the cover of the grill — and keep it open while lighting.
 
2. Fully open the valve on the gas cylinder.
 
3. Turn the burner control(s) to high.
 
4. Immediately push in the ignition button to light the grill.
 
5. If the grill doesn’t light instantly, push the ignition button again.
 
6. If the grill still doesn’t light, turn off all burner controls and close the 
valve on the cylinder. Wait 5 minutes for any gas fumes to dissipate, 
and then repeat Steps 1 through 5.
 
After the flame lights, set the controls to high for preheating (which should 
last about 10 to 15 minutes). Always be sure that the flame is burning before 
closing the cover.
Many contemporary gas grills have a built-in temperature gauge that tells you 
when they’re hot enough to cook on. Some indicate actual temperatures — 
350 degrees is medium and 500 degrees is hot — while others are marked 
“low,” “medium,” and “high,” which corresponds to the directions in most of 
our grilling recipes.
If you’re using a charcoal grill, you may come across a bunch of gadgets for 
creating a flame with which to ignite a fire, and quite honestly, we believe 
that just about all of them beat a match. The following sections show the 
alternatives to burning your fingers with a stubby match.
Your very best bet: An electric 
charcoal igniter
An electric charcoal igniter is a metal coil, usually made of stainless steel, 
that’s placed underneath the charcoal briquettes and heated up to a red-hot, 
glowing point that transfers heat to the immediate area. (See Figure 3-2.) The 

49
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
great thing about electric igniters is that you don’t use any sort of fire-starting 
aid, like kindling or lighter fluid, with them. Left in place for a maximum of 8 
minutes, the igniter starts coals glowing, and those coals rapidly ignite the 
coals that surround them. This method is a safe, easy way to start a grill. 
Such gadgets cost about $10.
Here’s how to use the coil for best results:
 
1. Plug the electric charcoal igniter into an electrical outlet and place 
the coil on the charcoal grate of the kettle grill.
 
2. Pile charcoal on top of the coil and wait about 8 minutes.
 
 You’ll see a little smoke rising from the kettle, and several of the coals 
atop the coil will be glowing brightly. If you leave the coil in much 
longer than 8 minutes, the coil itself may be damaged from the heat it 
has generated.
 
3. Unplug the coil, carefully remove it from the grill, and store it safely 
to cool.
 
 Be very careful when removing the coil, which can stay hot for several 
minutes. Unplug it first, remove it from the grill, and set it away from the 
grill on a nonflammable surface to cool.
 
4. Using long-handled tongs, shuffle the coals around to make them 
level, and let them sit.
 
 Within 20 to 30 minutes, you’ll have perfect ashy gray charcoal ready for 
grilling.

The runner-up: A chimney starter
An electric igniter is great (see previous section), but another way to light a 
charcoal fire is with the amazing chimney starter, shown in Figure 3-3, which 
is really, really cool — and cheap (one usually costs around $10). A chimney 
starter is nothing more than a wide-mouthed tin pipe that has a handle and 
a grate in the bottom. Using chimney starters can be a bit tricky, but if you 
don’t have access to an electrical outlet, they’re a good alternative to the 
electric starter. Once you get the hang of using them, they’re a cinch.
 
Figure 3-3: 
Ignite coals 
quickly with 
a chimney 
starter.
 
When you use a chimney to heat charcoal, you must use some sort of 
unwaxed paper (such as newspaper) as kindling to get the fire started. Follow 
these steps to use your chimney starter:
 
1. Stuff a crumpled-up sheet of newspaper in the bottom of the chimney.
 
2. Add charcoal briquettes to the chimney.
 
3. Place the chimney on the lower grating of the grill and light the news-
paper at the bottom using a butane lighter (see the upcoming section 
for more on the butane lighter).
 
 By forcing intense heat up through the shaft, the burning newspaper 
ignites the charcoal, which starts to burn brightly within a few minutes.
 
4. Release the burning charcoal from the chimney into the charcoal in 
the kettle either by squeezing the handle or by picking up the chim-
ney and dumping the contents into the grill.
 
When lighting your chimney and releasing the burning charcoal from it, be 
safe and wear a mitt! Check out Chapter 2 for more on mitts.

51
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
Old-school style: A butane lighter
If you want to start your fire the old-fashioned way, use a butane lighter. 
Because they ignite a small flame at the flick of a switch, you can use them 
to light paper, fire-starter briquettes, or gas grills. Good butane lighters have 
safety locks, regulators for the flame, and even little viewing windows so you 
can see how much butane is left. They’re either disposable (cheaper) or refill-
able and cost about $10. There are no cons to using a butane lighter. It’s just 
like a match only handier.
Fire starting doesn’t have to be a struggle if you own a charcoal grill and are 
stuck using the old method of lighting with a lighter. Just choose a good fire-
starting aid from the following list:
 
✓ Kindling: Kindling is any material that’s highly and quickly combustible 
and creates a fast flame that will burn long enough to ignite a fuel such 
as charcoal briquettes. We recommend one of the following materials:
 
• Wood: Make sure that the wood you use for kindling is very, 
very dry and brittle. Any moisture or “greenness” will result in a 
slow start, a poor burn, and bitter smoke. Old twigs and cut-up 
branches are best, and you should snap them to expose the more 
flammable inner core of the wood.
 
• Newspapers: Newspapers make excellent kindling, but be aware 
that you may need several wads. And be aware that burnt newspa-
per can fly all over the place, which is both messy and dangerous. 
If you do use newspaper, roll it loosely into thin, branchlike cylin-
ders, leaving plenty of air between the wrappings — air is oxygen, 
and oxygen is necessary for a good fire.
 
 To light a fire with kindling, place the kindling on the bottom of the grill 
and then place a single, uneven layer of charcoal on top. Light the kin-
dling and allow the charcoal to begin to burn.
 
✓ Lighter fluid: Lighter fluid provides an instantaneous flammable sub-
stance to your kindling. Simply arrange the kindling and coals (see pre-
ceding bullet), and then squirt 1/4 to 1/3 cup of lighter fluid on top of the 
coals. Wait a minute to let the fluid soak into the briquettes and then 
light the kindling. You can place a match on top of the coals or hold a 
butane lighter to the kindling.
 
 Lighter fluid has two main disadvantages. Because it’s liquid fuel, it’s 
more dangerously flammable and spreadable than paper or wood. It 
also has the potential of lending a slight chemical taste to your food. 
But we’ve found that if you use it correctly, it doesn’t affect your food’s 

52
Part I: Getting Ready to Show the Grill Who’s Boss 
taste. Simply make sure you wait 20 to 30 minutes after starting the fire 
to place the food over the coals; by then, the fumes will have burned off.
 
 Never use gasoline or kerosene as a lighter fluid because both can cause 
explosions. And if you think the fire is a bit sluggish and needs more 
lighter fluid, never squirt it into burning coals, because the fire can flare 
up or travel back up the stream of fluid to the can and cause a disaster. 
Rather, take a few new briquettes, place them in a clean can (such as a 
coffee can), and add enough lighter fluid to soak them. Then with long-
handled tongs, carefully place the soaked briquettes among the other 
briquettes.
 
✓ Miscellaneous fire starters: The grill industry has come up with a lot of 
useful items for fire starting: compressed sticks of wood compound or 
sawdust that’s soaked or treated with a safe, combustible fuel; wax by 
itself; wax in wood; and various chemical mixtures. You merely place 
these around the edges of your briquettes or natural lump charcoal and 
light the fire starters. They will burn quickly and ignite the charcoal.
 
 We have found that, despite industry claims, using chemical mixtures to 
light your grill may impart a chemical taste to your food, so we generally 
don’t recommend them. But any form of kindling, including those com-
pressed sawdust sticks, provide an easy way to get things started.
Controlling and Maintaining the Heat
The general rule for knowing when your coals are ready for grilling is to make 
sure that 80 percent or more of the coals are ashy gray (at night, they glow 
red with no flame). If you have less than that, the coals aren’t ready, and if all 
of them are glowing red hot, the fire is probably too hot. A fire that’s too hot 
will scorch your food and rob it of all its flavor.
After you notice that most of the charcoal looks ashy gray, add more char-
coal as needed. This additional charcoal brings the temperature back to the 
same level you had in order to achieve consistent cooking times.

While you’re grilling, monitor the temperature of the coals. As you cook your 
food and turn it over, you’ll easily see if the coals are dying down or burning 
out. Use the following simple technique to gauge the temperature: Place the 
palm of your hand just above the grid. If you can hold your hand in that posi-
tion for two seconds (counting “one thousand one, one thousand two”), the 
coals are hot; a three-second hold tells you the coals are medium-hot; four 
seconds is medium; and five is low. Unless you’re cooking for hours at a time, 
you’ll probably only have to replenish your coals once or twice.

53
 Chapter 3: To Build a Fire
Here are a few steps you can take to adjust the temperature of your fire. If 
your fire is too hot,
 
✓ Spread the coals out a bit more, which makes the fire less intense, if 
you’re grilling over direct heat.
 
✓ Lower the grill’s grid if it’s adjustable.
 
✓ Partially close the vents in the grill, which allows less oxygen and damps 
down the fire. If you close the vents entirely, you’ll get more smoke and 
therefore a smokier flavor. It will also build up the heat initially, but 
without oxygen the coals will die down in temperature after a while.
 
✓ Move the food to the outside edges of the grill so it isn’t directly over 
the coals.
If your fire is on the weak side,
 
✓ Push the coals closer together as they burn down (using long-handled 
tongs) to intensify the heat.
 
✓ Raise the grill’s grid if it’s adjustable.
 
✓ Open the grill’s vents to allow more oxygen in so the fire can grow.
 
✓ Add 12 to 15 briquettes to the outer edges of the fire after about the 
first 35 minutes (if you grill more than 45 minutes) to maintain a proper 
temperature.
 
In the event of a severe flare-up, spritz the flames with a water bottle. Be care-
ful, though — spraying with water tends to blow ash around and make a mess. 
To control a grease fire, we suggest baking soda. You may also want to keep a 
fire extinguisher, garden hose, or bucket of sand nearby.

rilling in its simplest form requires nothing more than a hot fire and a 
piece of meat. But if you want to take up grilling in all its diversity, you 
should stock your pantry with a few specific savory foods and condiments to 
complement the meats you choose.
In this chapter, we share our recommended list of items for your grilling 
pantry (and fridge) — bottled sauces, condiments, oils, vinegars, herbs, and 
spices — and we end with a brief description of fresh vegetables and fruits 
that can serve as strong seasoning agents in marinades, rubs, and barbecue 
sauces.
Adopting Some Kitchen Helpers: 
Bottled and Canned Goods
In a perfect world, every barbecue sauce and marinade would be made from 
scratch with the freshest of ingredients. But in this time-pressed world, we 
rely heavily on good commercial products. Having even a few of the following 

58
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
items on hand in your pantry or refrigerator allows you to whip up an assort-
ment of barbecue sauces, dressings, and marinades in a hurry:
 
✓ Bottled barbecue sauce: Every year you can find new sauces flavored 
with hickory, mesquite, Jamaican jerk seasonings, habañero peppers, 
peaches and pineapple, bourbon, rum, and every kind of imaginable hot 
chile pepper. Barbecue sauces aren’t only meant for ribs or chicken, 
however; you can also use them to baste salmon, shrimp kebabs, pork, 
and lamb chops.

 Most barbecue sauces are loaded with sugar and should be applied only 
during the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking to prevent the food from 
charring.
 
✓ Bottled marinades, dressings, and other basting and finishing sauces: 
These ingredients provide the grilling cook tremendous variety and con-
venience. Bottled vinaigrette can substitute as a last-minute marinade 
for poultry, vegetables, or pork. Check out the many new Asian prod-
ucts, including sauces for satay, kebabs, poultry, and ribs. Especially 
tasty are the Thai-style products.
 
✓ Canned favorites: Corn kernels, beans, chickpeas, and artichoke hearts 
are a few canned items to have on hand for making last-minute salads 
and salsas.
 
✓ Capers: These are pickled flower buds of the Middle Eastern caper bush. 
The smallest capers are called nonpareil. They add a distinctive salti-
ness to dishes. To cut down on the saltiness, always rinse and drain 
capers before using them in marinades, sauces, and dressings.
 
✓ Hoisin sauce: A favorite of Chinese cuisine, hoisin sauce is made from 
soybeans, garlic, hot pepper, and spices. Depending on the brand, its 
texture can range from runny and thin to very thick. You can use hoisin 
sauce in marinades and basting sauces for grilled poultry, pork, or lamb. 
(See Chapter 5 for a delicious Hoisin Marinade and Basting Sauce.)
 
 We like Ka-Me Hoisin Sauce because it has wonderful flavor and a smooth 
consistency (without the addition of MSG — monosodium glutamate — 
or a thickening food starch).
 
✓ Mayonnaise: No kitchen pantry is complete without a jar of mayonnaise. 
But for the most part, think of mayonnaise as an incomplete dressing. 
We like to add a range of ingredients to mayonnaise, such as sun-dried 
tomatoes, basil, mustard, horseradish, rosemary, Tabasco sauce, or 
grated lemon peel, to create a whole assortment of dressings, sauces, 
and spreads.
 
 Substitute reduced-fat mayonnaise, if you wish, whenever the real thing 
is called for, or combine them equally to reduce calories and retain 
flavor.

59
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
✓ Olives: Olives add a luscious saltiness to many dishes. Sprinkle them 
into quick, fresh tomato sauces for grilled fish (Chapter 15) or burg-
ers (Chapter 7). Stir them into mayonnaise-based sauces or salsas 
(Chapter 6). Add them to pizzas, quesadillas, or grilled sandwiches 
(all in Chapter 17).
 
✓ Peanut butter: You can use peanut butter to duplicate some of the 
sauces and dishes of Pacific Rim cuisine. For example, see Chapter 8 
for Satay with Peanut Dipping Sauce or Chapter 6 for Creamy Asian 
Peanut Sauce.
 
✓ Soy sauce: A vital ingredient in so many flavorful marinades, basting 
sauces, barbecue sauces, and dressings, soy sauce adds distinctive 
flavor, brown color, and saltiness.
 
 Light soy sauce is sodium-reduced and therefore less salty. You can sub-
stitute this anytime for soy sauce when less salt is preferred.
 
✓ Tahini paste: Made from sesame seeds, tahini is a staple ingredient in 
Middle Eastern cooking and is used in dips and sauces, or as a sandwich 
spread.
 
✓ Thai fish sauce: Throughout Asia, cooks use bottled fish sauce, which is 
made from fermented fish. It’s extremely pungent — it smells and tastes 
quite strong. But when added in very small amounts (a tablespoon or 
so) it provides an aromatic and slightly sweet-salty undertone to Asian 
dishes as part of a marinade. Because of its strength, however, you 
wouldn’t want to simply pour it over food straight off the grill.
 
✓ Worcestershire sauce: This sauce is a combination of vinegar, molasses, 
water, sugar, anchovies, and other savory ingredients.
 
 Add Worcestershire sauce according to your taste to marinades, dress-
ings, basting sauces, or hamburger patties. Or try splashing it over 
finished grilled foods, such as steaks, lamb chops, poultry, or roasted 
potatoes.
 
Before purchasing a product for the first time, read the ingredient label to get 
a general idea of its flavor. Try to avoid products in which the primary ingredi-
ent is sugar, salt, or fat. Otherwise that’s all you’ll taste. Purchase and taste 
test a few different brands of sauces, condiments, and other bottled goods to 
determine which ones you like best.
Condiment-ry, My Dear Watson
A condiment is any small side dish or accompaniment to food that adds flavor, 
texture, and contrasting color. Condiments can be vinegary (like ketchup), 

60
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
sweet (like preserved watermelon rind), hot and spicy (like salsa), sour (like 
dill pickles), or salty (like sun-dried tomatoes). The following list describes a 
few of our favorite condiments, which are available in any major supermarket:
 
✓ Chutneys: These sweet, tart, and spicy combinations of cooked fruits or 
vegetables make delectable accompaniments to grilled foods. Keep bot-
tles of store-bought mango or tomato chutney on hand as a last-minute 
topping for grilled burgers, steaks, poultry, lamb, pork, sea bass, mack-
erel, and bluefish. Or, look through Chapter 6 for a number of simple, 
homemade chutney recipes.
 
✓ Horseradish: A delicious condiment for grilled fish, horseradish also 
adds zing to dressings, dips, and sauces made with ketchup, sour cream, 
or mayonnaise.
 
✓ Ketchup: Ketchup is the ultimate yin and yang of condiments. It’s a 
blend of tangy vinegar, pureed tomatoes, and sweeteners like sugar 
or corn syrup. Before being knocked off its throne by the now more 
popular salsa, ketchup was America’s favorite condiment. Dress it up 
by adding chopped scallions, minced ginger, or horseradish. Or use 
ketchup as an ingredient in marinades, basting sauces, and salsas.
 
✓ Mustards: There are really two types of prepared mustards available: 
those that are creamy smooth and those that contain coarse seeds. 
Either type may be flavored with herbs and spices, red or white wine, 
Champagne, honey, sugar, chilies, or peppercorns. Here are a few types 
of mustards you can experiment with:
 
• Classic yellow mustard: With its mild taste and creamy texture, 
yellow mustard is the American choice — perfect for a grilled 
hot dog.
 
• Dijon mustard: This French classic, made with brown mustard 
seeds and flavored with white wine and other seasonings, is an 
extremely useful ingredient for the time-pressed grilling cook.
 
 Vary It! Combine Dijon mustard with melted butter and 
Worcestershire sauce as a quick sauce for steaks and burgers. 
Blend with honey as a basting sauce for turkey or ham steaks. Add 
to creamy-based salad dressings or to marinades and barbecue 
sauces.
 
• Honey mustard: This condiment combines two highly compat-
ible ingredients. Buy the condiment bottled or make your own by 
combining equal amounts of honey and mustard (or mixing them 
according to taste).
 
 Vary It! Use honey mustard as a basting sauce when grilling sau-
sage, ribs, ham steaks, chicken, turkey, duck, or lamb.

61
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
• Whole-grain mustard: Made with whole mustard seeds, whole-
grain mustard has a pleasant crunchy texture and can be flavored 
with any number of ingredients, such as chilies, wine, mixed herbs, 
honey, or vinegar.
 
 Vary It! Whole-grain mustard is a good addition to marinades for 
beef or pork.
 
✓ Salsa: Even though salsas are usually tomato-based, the salsa product 
line is growing to include salsas with roasted corn, red pepper, black 
olives, and other ingredients. Store varieties range from mild to hot.
 
 Vary It! Use salsa as a quick condiment for hot dogs, grilled burgers, 
steaks, chicken, or fish. Try it as a spread for quesadillas, fajitas, or 
other sandwich wraps. Add it to vegetable salads made with chopped 
tomatoes, corn, or canned beans. Use it to add flavor and heat to creamy 
macaroni salads.
 
✓ Sun-dried tomatoes: Sold either oil-packed or dried, sun-dried tomatoes 
are somewhat chewy and intensely flavored. You can use them to flavor 
salads, dressings, and spreads. See Chapter 16 for Macaroni Salad with 
Sun-Dried Tomato Mayonnaise.
 
✓ Tabasco sauce: An all-purpose spicy seasoning and condiment made 
from hot Capsicum peppers, vinegar, and salt, Tabasco sauce adds heat 
and a pleasant sharpness to marinades, dressings, and finished grilled 
foods.
Flavoring Foods with Oil
Oils range in taste from the nearly neutral flavor of ever-so-subtle peanut oil 
to bold and buttery olive oil to nutty, almost bitter-tasting, dark sesame oil. 
Avoid exposing oils to light and air, because they both cause the oils to dete-
riorate more rapidly. Instead, always store oils in a cool, dark place. Keep oil 
containers tightly sealed after opening and use within several months to one 
year. Throw out any oils that develop a musty or rancid smell.
Here are a few oils you can try:
 
✓ Olive oil: Use olive oil in dressings, marinades, and basting and finishing 
sauces. Olive oil is indispensable to the grilling chef — it infuses marinades, 
dressings, sauces, and salsas with its rich, fruity flavor. Try olive oil 
drizzled over grilled breads, grilled vegetables, roasted red peppers, and 
all kinds of grilled chicken or fish. (See the nearby sidebar “Solving the 
olive oil shopping conundrum” for details on finding a quality olive oil.)

62
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
 
 Don’t be misled by olive oil labeled as light. This is a refined oil with 
little color and flavor, but it has the same number of calories — 120 — 
as a tablespoon of any other kind of oil.
 
✓ Nut oils: Extracted from roasted walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and other 
nuts, these oils are very expensive and rich in flavor. They’re delicious 
in salad dressings and some salsas, especially when the recipe uses the 
same nut as an ingredient. However, these oils are highly perishable and 
must be refrigerated.
 
✓ Sesame oil: Made from sesame seeds, sesame oil has a rich, distinctive 
flavor. Use it sparingly to accent marinades made with Asian ingredients 
like soy sauce, ginger, and garlic.
Peanut, corn, safflower, soy, and other mild vegetable oils can be mixed with 
equal amounts of olive oil to enrich their flavors.
The shelf life of oil depends on its variety and how it’s stored. For instance, olive 
oil can be kept for up to a year if tightly capped and stored in a cool, dark place. 
But nut oils last only a few months, so purchase them in small quantities.
Flavored oils, seasoned with an assortment of ingredients such as lemon 
slices, whole peppercorns, dried herbs, garlic, and chilies, are now sold in 
fancy kitchenware stores and in the gourmet food section of many major 
supermarkets. They’re terrific drizzled over grilled breads, grilled pizzas, 
grilled vegetables, or grilled steaks, fish, chicken, or lamb.
Solving the olive oil shopping conundrum
When shopping for a quality olive oil, look on 
the front of the bottle for a sign of its grade, or 
quality. The purest, most expensive olive oils 
are marked extra-virgin and have the richest 
aroma and strongest flavors. Other, less expen-
sive grades of olive oil include virgin olive oil 
and olive oil.
Be aware, however, that labels don’t always 
tell the whole truth. Consider this: If a label 
reads “Packaged in Italy” (or Greece or Spain), 
all this means is that the oils could have come 
from anywhere and were only put into the can 
or bottle in the country on the label. If the label 
reads “Made in Italy,” the contents are from 
Italy but from no specific region. The best (and 
most expensive) olive oils have a much more 
regional focus, as in, “Produced in Tuscany” or 
“Produced in Umbria.”
You may want to stock your pantry with one 
bottle of the expensive grade and one bottle of 
the less expensive grade. Save the more pricey 
extra-virgin oils to drizzle onto fresh salads, 
salsas, grilled breads, or grilled vegetables 
and fish. Use the virgin olive oil when a larger 
amount is required for marinades, or for barbe-
cue sauces in which the oil’s distinctive flavor 
is more likely to be masked by the other strongly 
flavored ingredients.

63
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
Don’t try to make your own flavored oils at home unless you’re prepared to 
use them immediately. Homemade flavored oils can spoil in just a few hours, 
and they may even develop botulism, which can be deadly.
Adding Tartness with a Splash of Vinegar
Vinegars tenderize cuts of meat as they marinate, but they also add a pleasant 
tartness to sauces, dressings, and marinades. Vinegars are almost always paired 
with oils to balance their harshness. We’re partial to balsamic vinegar, which is 
slightly sweet, less harsh, and more complex in flavor than other vinegars.
If, by accident, you add too much vinegar to a dressing or marinade, you can 
tone down the acidic effect by adding a pinch of salt, more oil, or by whisking 
in a bit of sugar or other sweetener, such as honey, to taste.
Here are some types of vinegar to keep in your pantry:
 
✓ Apple cider vinegar: Good for almost all recipes where vinegar is an ingre-
dient, apple cider vinegar is especially good with marinades and dressings 
that contain a fruit or citrus juice or that have an element of sweetness.
 
✓ Balsamic vinegar: Bold, rich, and slightly sweet, real balsamic vinegar 
is outrageously expensive and made only in the area near Modena, Italy. 
Most of the bottles sold in the supermarkets are imitations. But being a 
“fake” doesn’t mean it’s bad; it’s just less aged. Balsamic vinegar is deli-
cious in marinades, dressings, and finishing sauces. Try splashing it to 
taste on grilled lamb, chicken, or pork.
 
✓ Red wine vinegar: Use this bold and pleasantly pungent vinegar in mari-
nades for beef, pork, or poultry.
 
✓ Rice vinegar: Slightly milder than other vinegars, rice vinegar works 
well with sherry or sake in marinades.
 
✓ White wine vinegar: This type of vinegar can be fruity or very dry. It’s 
delicious in relishes and chutneys, because it counterbalances sweet 
flavorings.
Sweeten the Pot: Using Sweeteners 
in Sauces and Marinades
When preparing a sauce or a condiment, you may want it to be boldly sweet, 
or you may want just a hint of sweet taste. Much like salt, sweet ingredients, 

64
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
when used in moderation, can help blend all the other flavors within a recipe. 
Try experimenting with the following sweeteners:
 
✓ Fruit jams and preserves: Jams and preserves enhance grilled foods 
when used as ingredients in glazes and finishing sauces.
 
 Vary It! Turn a pork chop or a rack of ribs into something sublime by 
coating it with a warm glaze of apricot jam, minced ginger, and lemon 
juice. A spit-roasted duck needs only a slather of black cherry or black 
currant jam to make it perfect. A broiled lamb chop pairs nicely with a 
good-quality mint jelly and some freshly ground black pepper.
 
✓ Honey: Honey can add anywhere from a slight to an overwhelming ele-
ment of sweetness to marinades and basting sauces, and it mixes par-
ticularly well with Asian ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, hoisin sauce, 
garlic, and sesame oil.

 Like other sweeteners, honey can cause grilled food to char and burn. 
To lessen the chances of burning, grill the food indirectly or scrape 
all the marinade off the food before placing it on the grill. For the best 
effect, apply basting sauces containing honey only during the final min-
utes of grilling.
 
✓ Light and dark brown sugar: Brown sugar is white sugar combined with 
molasses to give it color and moisture. The lighter the color, the less 
intense (or molasses-like) the flavor.
 
✓ Molasses: A common ingredient in barbecue sauces, molasses adds 
sweetness and color to marinades and barbecue and basting sauces.
Wine and Dine Me: Marinating 
and Basting with Wines
Like vinegars, all wines are tenderizing agents, but their chief function in 
marinades or sauces is to add bold flavor. White wines are subtle, while the 
bolder and richer the red wine, the more distinct flavor it will add to a dish.
The following are some of the most common wines used for marinating and 
basting:
 
✓ Dry red and white wine: These acid-based wines are tenderizing agents, 
but more importantly, they add a complexity of flavor to marinades 
and basting sauces. Add herbs and spices to taste and always have an 
oil component in a red or white wine marinade to take off some of the 
acidic edge.

65
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
 For marinades or sauces, you don’t need to spend more than about $8 
on a good bottle of red or white wine — and at that price, whatever wine 
remains in the bottle is good enough for serving with the meal.
 
✓ Marsala: Marsala, a fortified wine (which means that another alcohol, 
such as brandy, has been added to the wine to raise its alcohol content), 
is good in marinades for poultry and game birds. This wine adds a tinge 
of sweetness.
 
✓ Sake: A Japanese beer made from fermented rice, sake is excellent in mar-
inades. You can use it as a substitute for dry vermouth or pale dry sherry. 
After it’s opened, it can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 weeks.
 
✓ Sherry: Sherry, like Marsala, is a fortified wine. Depending on its sweet-
ness, sherry is labeled dry, medium dry, or sweet. Sherry can be used in 
marinades and basting sauces.
Walking through a Griller’s Herb Garden
For most grilled recipes, we prefer fresh herbs and spices — they have more 
flavor than their dried counterparts. One exception to this rule applies to 
rubs, which are mixtures of dried, ground spices (and sometimes dried 
herbs) that are made into compact, dense, and flavorful coatings that easily 
adhere to the food’s surface. Most varieties of fresh herbs are available year-
round in supermarkets and Middle Eastern and Asian specialty stores, and 
many can be grown in a pot on the windowsill or outdoors in mild climate.
Fresh herbs should be washed and dried thoroughly and then stored in damp 
paper towels in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator, where they will stay 
fresh for up to five days. To keep them longer, treat them like freshly cut 
flowers and place the herbs in a glass of water in the refrigerator. Dried herbs 
and spices should be stored in a cool place, away from direct sunlight and 
heat. In other words, the top of your stove is not a good place for a spice rack!
 
Avoid buying dried or preground herbs and spices in large quantities (even 
if they’re discounted in price). There’s no fixed rule about how long dried 
herbs and spices should be stored, but dried herbs seem to lose their origi-
nal potency after about a year. Ground spices have a longer shelf life. If you 
doubt the freshness of a dried herb or spice, just smell it. It should smell 
fresh and aromatic.
The amount of herbs and spices that are blended in a sauce, marinade, rub, 
salsa, or dressing is usually a matter of personal taste. Experiment with differ-
ent combinations, adding them to taste, usually at the end of cooking, when 
they will best retain their color and flavor. When substituting dried herbs for 
fresh herbs, use about 1/3 the amount of fresh herbs called for in the recipe.

66
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
Take a look at some of the most essential herbs and spices for grilling:
 
✓ Allspice: Spice berries from the evergreen pimento tree are combined 
with tastes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves — hence the name. An 
important ingredient in Jamaican jerk seasonings and Caribbean sauces, 
allspice adds an almost sweet element. Use it in barbecue sauce, rubs, 
and marinades.
 
✓ Basil: Fresh basil has a slightly sweet, pungent flavor (some say it reminds 
them of licorice) that goes with garlic, mint, lemon peel, lemon juice, 
tomatoes, grilled fish, lamb, or poultry. Basil, which is the main ingredi-
ent in Pesto Sauce (Chapter 15), is easy to grow outdoors in temperate 
climates. To maximize flavor, add basil at the end of cooking, or consider 
sprinkling chopped, fresh basil leaves generously over grilled foods.
 
 Dried basil has little flavor and is a poor substitute for fresh. Instead, 
freeze fresh, washed basil in a freezer bag, using it as needed when fresh 
basil isn’t available.
 
✓ Cayenne or red pepper: This hot, powdered, red-colored mixture of 
several types of chile peppers is usually sold ground. Use it in small 
amounts in marinades, rubs, and sauces.
 
✓ Chili powder: This is a fiery mixture of dried chilies, cumin, oregano, 
garlic, coriander, and cloves. You’ll see this spice sold ground.
 
 Vary It! Use chili powder as a multipurpose seasoning when you want 
to add heat as well as flavor. It’s especially popular in Tex-Mex-style 
kebabs, marinades, and sauces. Chili powder mixes especially well in 
rubs for chicken or beef with cumin, oregano, ground chile peppers, cay-
enne or red pepper, and salt.
 
✓ Fresh cilantro: Also called Chinese parsley and fresh coriander, this herb 
is cherished by Chinese, Southeast Asian, Mexican, and Latin American 
cultures and cooks. Its parsley-look-alike leaves have a distinctive taste 
and smell.
Table, sea, or kosher: Choosing a salt to cook with
Most of the regular or fine-grained salt that 
finds its way to the supermarket and eventually 
to your table is rock salt mined from salt depos-
its. Sea salt, prized by chefs for its more com-
plex taste, is made by evaporating sea water, so 
it contains minerals from the sea. Many chefs 
and savvy home cooks prefer the seasoning 
effect of coarse-grained kosher salt. With its 
oversized crystals, kosher salt clings to foods 
better than fine-grained salt.

67
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
 Vary It! Use cilantro in marinades for fish, chicken, or beef. Cilantro 
mixes well with ginger, citrus juices and peels, mint, hot chilies, and 
garlic. To make a delicious dipping sauce for chunks of French bread, 
skewered chicken, or fish, mix together extra-virgin olive oil, finely 
chopped cilantro leaves, salt, and freshly ground black pepper.
 
✓ Cinnamon: A sweet and aromatic spice harvested from the bark of 
a tropical tree, cinnamon is commonly sold ground or as whole dry 
sticks. Cinnamon is a popular ingredient in Caribbean sauces and rubs 
where its sweetness contrasts with the heat of chilies and other spicy 
ingredients.
 
 Vary It! Add cinnamon to poultry rubs and barbecue sauces or sprinkle 
it on grilled fruits.
 
✓ Cumin: This aromatic, nutty-flavored spice is sold as whole dried seeds 
or in ground form. Cumin is essential to Middle Eastern cooking and 
Southwestern cooking in the United States. Ground cumin is one of the 
main ingredients in curry powder and some chili powders. Cumin is ter-
rific with grilled fish, lamb, pork, or beef, and in rubs, marinades, and 
barbecue sauces.
 
✓ Curry powder: This pungent spice blends more than a dozen different 
herbs and spices, often including cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, chil-
ies, mace, nutmeg, turmeric, red and black pepper, and ground sesame 
seeds. Use curry when you want a Middle Eastern or Indian accent. You 
can also use it as the main ingredient in chicken, lamb, or pork rubs.
 
✓ Five spice powder: This aromatic seasoning powder, used throughout 
China and Vietnam, usually combines the following ground ingredi-
ents: star anise (a star-shaped spice filled with small seeds), Szechwan 
peppercorns, cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, and sometimes ginger or 
cardamom. Cardamom is a mellow spice that’s frequently used to make 
curries, spiced cakes, and garam masala — the most important spice 
blend of north Indian cooking.
 
 Five spice powder, available in Asian markets and many supermarket 
spice sections, may become one of your favorite grilling ingredients. Use 
it as a seasoning rub for chicken, pork, lamb, or fish, or try adding it to 
marinades made with other Asian ingredients like soy sauce, sesame oil, 
or garlic.
 
✓ Fresh gingerroot: Found in the produce section of the supermarket, 
fresh gingerroot is peeled and then sliced, minced, or grated before it’s 
added to marinades, dressings, and basting sauces. It mixes well with 
garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, hot peppers, and other Asian seasonings. 
Fresh gingerroot also contains an enzyme that breaks down and softens 
animal gelatin, so it can be an effective tenderizing agent when used in 
meat marinades.

68
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
 
 To store fresh gingerroot in the refrigerator, wrap it in a paper towel and 
then place it in a plastic bag punctured with a few holes (to let in some 
air). It will stay fresh for up to 3 weeks.
 
✓ Ground ginger: Sold in the spice section, ground ginger blends well with 
spices common to Indian cuisine, such as cumin, curry, turmeric, and 
coriander, or with Caribbean cooking spices, like allspice, nutmeg, and 
cinnamon. You may substitute ground ginger for fresh gingerroot when 
you have no choice; however, ground ginger is much spicier than fresh.
 
 Because it’s so spicy, use ground ginger cautiously when substituting 
for fresh, and be sure to taste after each addition. For a flavorful steak 
rub, mix together to taste powdered ginger, fresh minced garlic, black 
pepper, and salt. Cover and refrigerate meat for several hours before 
grilling.
 
✓ Jamaican jerk seasoning: If you love spicy foods, run to the store to buy 
yourself a bottle of this seasoning. Why make it yourself when several 
superior products are now available in major supermarkets? Jerk is 
especially good on pork but also works with chicken and fish. Rub it into 
chops and tenderloins before grilling.
 
✓ Mint: A fresh, sweet, pungent herb, mint is sold in fresh bunches or 
crumbled dry and is easily grown outdoors in mild climates. The two 
most common varieties are peppermint and spearmint.
 
 Vary It! Mint is terrific with fresh vegetables, and in rice, fruit salsas, 
and fruit salads. (See Chapter 16 for a refreshing Yogurt Cucumber Salad 
with mint.) It combines especially well with basil or lemon peel in salads 
or dressings. Sprinkle chopped, fresh mint on grilled chicken, fish, pork, 
or lamb or add it to salsas or flavored butters.
 
✓ Oregano: Oregano has intense flavor and is best if fresh, but it can be 
purchased crumbled dry as well. Use this herb in marinades and dress-
ings for grilled fish, lamb, beef, or chicken.
 
✓ Paprika: Lush red in color, paprika varieties range from faintly sweet 
and spicy to intensely hot, and they’re usually sold ground. The 
Hungarian variety is considered the best. Excellent in rubs for poultry, 
pork, or beef, paprika also mixes well with cayenne pepper.
 
✓ Parsley: Sold year-round, parsley is available in fresh bunches or crum-
bled dry. The most common fresh varieties are curly parsley and the 
stronger-flavored Italian flat-leaf. Parsley is an all-purpose herb that can 
be added liberally to marinades, dressings, sauces, or compound butters.
 
 Vary It! Gremolata, a parsley and garlic topping classically served on 
osso buco — a hearty, Italian dish of braised veal shanks, white wine, 
tomatoes, garlic, anchovies, grated lemon peel, and other ingredients — 
makes a terrific lowfat garnish for grilled foods. To make gremolata, mix 

69
 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
together 1 large clove peeled and finely minced garlic, the grated peel of 
one large lemon, 1/4 cup chopped parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Sprinkle over grilled fish, chicken, pork, or beef.
 
✓ Peppercorns: Like salt, pepper is a universally prized seasoning ingre-
dient. It’s used in recipes for foods that range in flavor from savory to 
sweet. Peppercorns of all types, whether black, green, or white, come 
from the Piper nigrum vine. Peppercorns can be combined to create pep-
pery coatings for grilled meats or poultry. You can buy bottles of mixed 
peppercorns in the spice section of major supermarkets.
 
 Freshly crushed pepper is far more aromatic and potent than pre-
crushed pepper in a can. Always use a pepper mill to crush black pep-
percorns into freshly ground pepper. You can use a couple of other 
ways to easily crush whole peppercorns before adding them to rubs, 
sauces, or marinades. For instance, gather them in the middle of a cut-
ting board and press them with the bottom of a heavy skillet. Or wrap 
them in heavy-duty aluminum foil and pound the package with a meat 
mallet or a rolling pin until they’re crushed to a desired size.
 
✓ Rosemary: Any serious grilling cook knows that rosemary is a very 
important herb. Fresh rosemary sprigs have just the right intensity of 
flavor for rubs and marinades.
 
 Vary It! Rosemary is perfect for grilled pork, poultry, fish, lamb, pota-
toes, tomatoes, summer squash, and eggplant. Grill kebabs, fish steaks, 
or fish fillets on top of fresh, oiled rosemary sprigs. Or strip all the 
needles and use the stems as flavorful wooden skewers for small pieces 
of lamb, chicken, or fish. Dried rosemary is also an excellent rub ingre-
dient. Mix it to taste with ground thyme, crushed peppercorns, dried 
oregano, garlic salt, or other seasonings, and then press onto chicken, 
steaks, lamb, or fish before grilling. Blend chopped, fresh rosemary 
leaves and lemon juice into butter for a rich herb butter.
 
✓ Saffron: Saffron — the world’s most expensive spice — is pungent and 
aromatic; however, a little goes a long way to add flavor and a golden 
color to mayonnaise dressings or creamy sauces for grilled fish or 
chicken.
 
 Saffron is sold as a powder or as whole yellow, orange, or red threads. 
The threads are better quality. Soak them briefly in a little hot water 
before adding them (along with the soaking water) to the dish.
 
✓ Thyme: Fresh or dried, thyme is a terrific herb for accenting tomato 
and wine-based sauces and marinades for beef, pork, or poultry. Thyme 
mixes well with basil, sage, rosemary, parsley, marjoram, and garlic. 
Sprinkle chopped, fresh thyme over grilled vegetables such as potatoes, 
eggplant, tomatoes, summer squash, mushrooms, or onions.

70
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
Adding Zest with Fruits and Veggies
A griller’s pantry or refrigerator should include a range of fresh fruits and 
vegetables that can be used as seasoning ingredients to add spice, heat, pun-
gency, and other intense flavors to foods. We recommend that you stock the 
following:
 
✓ Chilies: Sorting through chilies in the supermarket can be confusing. 
They’re sold fresh, dried, crushed, flaked, and ground. The pungency of 
a chile can range from almost sweet to excruciatingly hot. Fresh chilies 
commonly found in Mexican dishes include jalapeño (hot), habañero 
(very hot), and poblano (mild). See Figure 4-1 for a look at the types of 
chilies you can buy. Remember that chilies infuse a dish with additional 
flavor as well as with spiciness.
 
 Handle all chilies, but especially fresh chilies, with care. To prepare a 
fresh chile, remove the seeds and ribs — the hottest parts — to reduce 
the intensity of the pepper by about 90 percent, and then finely chop the 
chilies into marinades and sauces. Wash your hands and avoid touching 
your eyes after handling. In fact, you may want to wear rubber gloves 
when handling chilies!
 
 Some of the more common dried chilies available in supermarkets today 
are the ancho, pasilla, and chipotle. The chipotle chile is a smoke-dried 
jalapeño with a wonderful, hot, smoky flavor. (Check out Chapter 15 for 
a Grilled Swordfish Steak with Chipotle Salsa recipe.)
Spice is just a phone call away
Check out your supermarket spice section for 
an array of special spice mixes — from mixed 
peppercorn blends to jerk seasoning — made 
by McCormick, Paul Prudhomme, Zatarain’s, 
and other companies. You can also mail-order 
rubs directly from the following companies:

 Chapter 4: Peeking Inside the Grilling Guru’s Pantry
 
Figure 4-1: 
Some 
common 
varieties of 
chilies that 
add spice 
and flavor.
 
 
 Cayenne and paprika are chilies that have been ground to a fine powder 
and range in heat from very hot to mild. Ground chilies, mixed with cumin, 
garlic, and other spices, are often made into blends of chili powder.
 
 Vary It! For a delicious, quick spice rub, sprinkle your favorite chili 
powder (homemade or store-bought) onto fish, chicken, or pork, and 
then coat the meat with a little oil before grilling. (Chapter 5 has more 
on rubs.)
 
✓ Citrus juice from lemons, limes, and oranges: These juices are mildly 
acidic and add a fresh, bold flavor to marinades, dressings, and basting 
sauces. To some degree, citrus juice is a tenderizing agent in marinades.
 
 Vary It! Garnish platters of grilled fish, chicken, or lamb with lime 
or lemon slices, or try grilling delicate fish fillets on slices of lemons, 
oranges, or limes. (Chapter 15 is filled with fish ideas.) Lemon juice is 
a delicious marinade ingredient for grilled lamb, veal, chicken, or pork. 
Orange juice adds natural sweetness to marinades, and it combines 
especially well with hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Flip to Chapter 5 for a 
Hoisin Marinade that you can use on pork ribs, lamb, or chicken.
 
✓ Citrus peel from lemons, limes, and oranges: Grated citrus peel, also 
called zest, contains natural oils that can add intense flavor to grilled 
meat, fish, poultry, and vegetables. Grated citrus peel doesn’t have the 
slightly harsh acidic quality of the juice; instead, like salt, citrus peel 
helps punctuate the natural flavor of a food.
 
 Vary It! Add grated peel generously to dressings, marinades, basting 
sauces, and rubs. Add peels to white wine vinegar with fresh herbs to 

72
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
make citrus-flavored vinegars. Be sure to grate only the outer, colored 
portion of the peel because the pith, or the white layer underneath the 
peel, imparts bitterness.

 Throw whole peels directly into the coals to create flavorful smoke 
when grilling pork, fish, or lamb.
 
✓ Garlic: The potential of garlic for the grilling cook is unlimited — we 
can’t praise garlic enough. Raw garlic cloves are indispensable to all 
types of marinades. Minced or pressed garlic adds depth and dimen-
sion to basting and finishing sauces, dips, salsas, condiments, and side 
dishes. There’s a reason that garlic is a recognizable ingredient in so 
many ethnic cuisines and dishes — it combines, without objection, with 
other strong ethnic seasoning like fresh ginger, soy sauce, chile peppers, 
hot spices, curries, onions, olive oil, and fresh herbs. When foil-wrapped 
and roasted, garlic loses some of its sharpness and mellows to almost a 
nutty taste. (See Chapter 16 for tips on roasting garlic.)
 
 Vary It! When a marinade, dip, or salsa seems to taste flat and lack 
flavor, try adding a little minced garlic.
 
✓ Red and yellow onions, scallions, and shallots: In addition to being 
marvelous choices for grilling on their very own (see Chapter 16), all of 
these vegetables add flavor to marinades and sauces. You should always 
stock these items in your pantry.
 
• Red onions add color as well as an element of sweetness to salsas 
and condiments.
 
• Yellow onions, in good supply all year-round, are the workhorses 
of the griller’s pantry. Dice and add them to marinades, salsas, 
chutneys, and relishes.
 
• Scallions, which have long green leaves and small white bulbs, are 
especially welcomed in Asian-style sauces and marinades. (Use 
both the green and white parts.)
 
• Shallots, with their faint purple interior and papery bronze skin, 
aren’t some high-minded ingredient of the rich and famous. 
Shallots are readily available in all supermarkets and noteworthy 
because of their distinctive nutty flavor.

Chapter 5
Infusing Foods with Flavor: 
Marinades, Oils, and Rubs
In This Chapter
▶ Marinating for taste and tenderness
▶ Coating foods with flavored oils
▶ Applying tasty rubs for crispy crust
You may say that marinades, oils, and rubs 
are to grilling what sauces are to French 
cooking: They layer on flavor to transform ordi-
nary poultry, fish, meat, and vegetables into 
something divine and memorable. Except, unlike 
a fancy finishing sauce, marinades, oils, and 
rubs work their magic before the food is actually 
cooked.
You can’t overestimate the importance of marinat-
ing food that’s destined for the grill. Marinades 
change food in two very important ways: by soft-
ening or slightly tenderizing meat and by adding 
flavor. A tender, succulent rib-eye steak may need 
nothing but a dusting of salt and pepper before 
it’s grilled, but a top blade or shoulder steak will 
greatly benefit from a little soaking to soften its 
tougher tissues. Tender cubes of sirloin can be 
cut and skewered with vegetables and fruits for 
kebabs, but marinating those cubes first in a sea-
soned liquid gives you an endless number of fla-
voring options. Indeed, adding flavor is the main 
benefit of marinating.

Oils and rubs are the little cousins of marinades — they add moisture and 
flavor but don’t have acidic ingredients such as lemon juice, vinegar, or 
wine, which slightly tenderize food. Oils can be combined with chopped 
herbs, grated citrus peel, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and other seasonings 
to make a thick paste that you apply to cuts of meat, fish, or poultry. They’re 
best used with seafood, which needs protection from the high heat that oil 
provides. Rubs can be any tasty blend of spices and seasonings. They can 
be used on most any foods — less on subtle flavors like fish and more on 
foods with lustier flavors like venison or duckling. In this chapter, I provide 
you with a number of recipes for marinades, oils, and rubs to help you infuse 
your food with flavor. I also tell you what foods work best with which recipes.
The March of the Marinades
You’re standing in your kitchen looking at a thick and juicy piece of steak 
that you hope to grill to a perfect medium-rare. And you’re thinking that, 
in addition to a dusting of salt and pepper, you could add more pizzazz by 
plunging the meat into a spicy marinade. Good idea. But now comes the hard 
part: deciding what ingredients to use. This section helps you make that deci-
sion as well as guides you in using marinades most effectively for the most 
flavorful finish.
Choosing your marinade ingredients
The typical marinade is a combination of an oil, an acid, herbs, and spices. 
The fat that lubricates and moisturizes the food is usually a vegetable oil. The 
acid component may be a vinegar, lemon juice or other citric acid, yogurt, or 
wine. Although these acids don’t actually tenderize the food, they can soften 
the surface tissues of tougher cuts.
Marinades come in endless flavors — spicy, sweet, savory, tangy, herby, oily, 
acidic, salty, and so on. We give you plenty of marinades in this chapter and 
throughout the book, but there’s no reason to use only our recipes. What 
you put into the marinade is a matter of personal taste — if you feel like 
experimenting on your own, use the marinade combinations that follow as 
guidelines, adjusting specific ingredient amounts to mix a potion that works 
for you.
Similarly, many of the marinade recipes in this book are interchangeable. For 
example, the marinade for Caribbean Pork Chops (Chapter 12) also works 
with ribs, turkey, or chicken. The Best-Ever Fajitas marinade (Chapter 17) is 
also good with other cuts of beef, chicken, or cubes of skewered fish. If you 
like a marinade’s flavor, steal it from one recipe and use it with other foods.

When breaking away from a recipe to blend your own marinade, always con-
sider the food that’s being soaked. Ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ Is it lean, like a chicken breast or white fish? As a rule, the leaner the 
food, the better it does in a marinade with a fairly high concentration 
of oil.
 
✓ Is it high in fat, like the well-marbled red meat of a rib-eye steak? 
Richer foods hold their own against more robust acidic ingredients, 
such as red wine vinegar or wine.
Also think about how ingredients work best together. Consider the following 
combinations and ingredient tips:
 
✓ Soy sauce is compatible with the flavors of ginger, sesame oil, scal-
lions, and garlic. Spicy Asian-flavored marinades for fish, pork, beef, or 
chicken often combine dark soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, sugar, chilies, 
fresh ginger, peanut oil, scallions, and cilantro leaves.
 
✓ White or red wines mix well with olive oil, chopped garlic, onions or 
shallots, and fresh herbs, such as tarragon, thyme, rosemary, or bay 
leaf. Red wine marinades are good with beef, game, and dark-meat poul-
try. White wine marinades go well with pork, poultry, fish, and shellfish. 
(Turn to Chapter 10 for Rotisserie-Grilled Chicken, which is made with a 
white wine, lemon-herb marinade; or refer to Chapter 11 to see a recipe 
for Grilled Tenderloin Au Poivre with Herb Butter Sauce, which uses a 
red wine marinade.)
 
✓ Fresh or dried chilies, chili powder, cayenne pepper, crushed red 
pepper, and Tabasco sauce can punch up the flavor in a marinade and 
leave your mouth with an appealing hot and spicy aftertaste.
 
✓ Honey, molasses, brown sugar, and granulated sugar add sweet-
ness to your grilled foods. Compose a tasty marinade for all kinds of 
poultry by mixing together corn oil, ketchup or molasses, dry sherry, 
Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, crushed garlic, chopped onions, 
Tabasco sauce, salt, and pepper (all to your taste).
 
✓ Peanut oil is very mild, while sesame oil is bold and best if used in lim-
ited amounts in a marinade.
 
✓ Grated lemon, lime, or orange peel is rich in aromatic citrus oil and can 
be used quite liberally in marinades.
 
✓ Whole, minced, and pressed garlic seems to improve nearly every 
savory marinade.
 
✓ Dijon-style mustard added to a marinade of dry white wine, olive oil, 
fresh lemon juice, lemon peel, and chopped fresh herbs like parsley, 
rosemary, basil, or thyme is delicious for poultry or fish.

✓ Yogurt is a mild acid that blends nicely with cumin, turmeric, curry, 
cayenne pepper, ginger, paprika, chopped onion, and garlic to coat and 
flavor kebabs of lamb, chicken, or fish. (See Chapter 8 for the Chicken 
Tikka marinade, which also works with pork or lamb.)
 
✓ Contrary to what’s written in many other cookbooks, adding salt to a 
marinade doesn’t compel food to release its natural juices, nor does it 
cause food to toughen or dry out. Water or liquid flows toward the most 
dense or concentrated cells in a natural effort to dilute them. The cell 
walls of the food sitting in the marinade take in mostly liquid and very 
little salt. So, if you wish, add the salt.
Preparing to marinate
When you’re about ready to marinate, select a container that’s the proper 
size and shape. You want the food to fit snugly and be immersed in the liquid. 
As a general rule, you need about 1 to 2 cups of marinade for every 11/2 
to 2 pounds of food. You want enough marinade to completely surround the 
food. You can use a mixing bowl for your marinade, but make sure it’s glass, 
ceramic, or plastic, because acidic ingredients and alcohol can react with alu-
minum and iron pans, giving the meat and liquid a metallic flavor and a gray 
color.
We think a large, resealable plastic bag works best. Just mix the marinade 
right in the bag, toss in the food, seal the bag, and chill, turning occasionally. 
(Check out Figure 5-1.) When using a plastic bag, you don’t need as much 
marinade as you would to cover food in a bowl in which you have to keep 
turning the food to coat evenly. Foods marinated in a bag also take up less 
room in your refrigerator.

 Chapter 5: Infusing Foods with Flavor: Marinades, Oils, and Rubs
Deciding how long to marinate your food
Most foods, except for delicate fish, vegetables, and certain cuts of tender 
meat, benefit from several hours of marinating time, and many foods like to 
stand in the liquid overnight. Turn over the food in the marinade (or flip over 
the plastic bag) a few times during marinating to moisten all the food sur-
faces. With beef, lamb, and other red meats, it takes more time for the mari-
nade flavors to penetrate the flesh of the food, so hours or even overnight is 
best.
 
Ignore the advice of cookbooks and recipes that instruct you to marinate 
meat, fish, or poultry at room temperature for 2 to 3 hours before grilling. You 
can safely marinate meat, fish, or poultry at room temperature for only about 
30 minutes; after that, you risk the danger of contamination from airborne 
bacteria. Be on the safe side and keep foods well chilled in the refrigerator. 
Grilling chilled meats takes a little longer, but you avoid the possibility of con-
taminating your food.
Using marinades for basting and finishing
Very often the same marinade that’s used to soak the uncooked food can be 
reheated and poured over the grilled food to serve as a delicious finishing 
sauce. You can also use leftover marinade as a basting sauce.
 
However, if any kind of raw fish, meat, or poultry was first soaked in the mari-
nade, it must be heated to boiling and allowed to simmer for 15 minutes to 
destroy any possible bacteria from the raw food.

Marinades that contain sugar can give a nice caramelized coating to grilled 
food, but they can also burn very quickly. Indirect cooking is better in these 
cases. If you’re basting, do it just 5 to 10 minutes before the food is cooked 
through.

Hoisin Marinade and Basting Sauce
Hoisin sauce, which you can find in any major supermarket, is a convenient, versatile 
product that can add sparkle to many grilled foods — especially ribs, chicken, lamb, 
and shrimp. It’s a mixture of sugar, vinegar, soybeans, chile peppers, and garlic. The 
sugar content is relatively high, so for best results, use the indirect grilling method (see 
Chapter 1) to prevent the food from charring.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to overnight, depending on the food
Yield: About 1 cup
1/2 cup fresh orange juice
1/3 cup hoisin sauce
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon sesame oil
Pepper to taste
1/4 cup finely chopped scallions (white and 
green parts)
In a small mixing bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the orange juice, hoisin sauce, soy 
sauce, ginger, honey, sesame oil, and pepper; stir in the scallions. Use as a marinade and basting 
sauce for about 2 pounds of pork, lamb, chicken, or shrimp. Marinate meat or poultry for 
several hours or overnight; marinate shrimp for 30 minutes or less. Grill food indirectly or 
monitor carefully if grilling over a direct fire, to prevent charring. To use as a finishing sauce, 
bring any remaining marinade to a boil for 15 minutes in a small saucepan and drizzle over 
grilled food.
Vary It! For a simple hoisin barbecue sauce, combine equal parts hoisin sauce, ketchup, 
and water. Use with chicken, ribs, or shrimp, basting the last 10 to 15 minutes of grilling.
 
Spicy Soy and Cilantro Marinade
This marinade is delicious with any cut of beef and also works with chicken, fish, or 
pork. Any leftover marinade can be boiled for a finishing sauce or tossed into cooked 
noodles with just enough additional peanut oil and soy sauce to coat. You can use any 
kind of hot chile pepper, such as jalapeño, serrano, or habañero, but beware — haba-
ñero is about as hot as peppers get! Using a red pepper rather than a green one adds a 
nice contrasting note of color to the finished dish. Cilantro gives a nice vegetal edge and 
mellows the hotness of the chilies.

79
 Chapter 5: Infusing Foods with Flavor: Marinades, Oils, and Rubs
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to overnight, depending on the food
Yield: About 11/3 cups
1/2 cup dark soy sauce
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1/4 cup peanut oil
1/4 cup chopped cilantro (coriander) leaves
4 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
3 scallions, trimmed and chopped (white and 
green parts)

fresh ginger
2 teaspoons sugar
1 to 2 chile peppers, seeded and finely minced
 
 Combine all the ingredients in a small mixing bowl or measuring cup and pour over 11/2 
to 2 pounds of meat, chicken, or fish. For best results, marinate fish for 30 minutes to 1 
hour and other foods for 6 hours or overnight. Turn the food occasionally during 
marinating.
 
Spicy Cinnamon and Soy Marinade
Cinnamon adds an Asian or Middle Eastern spiciness to this marinade while the soy 
buoys it with a saltiness and slight bitterness to give it a delightful balance. You can see 
this marinade in the color photo section of this book. There you can also see a grilled 
piece of marinated chicken on a roll.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 4 to 6 hours
Yield: 1 cup
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground anise powder
1 teaspoon crushed pepper flakes
Juice of 1 lemon
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons corn or peanut oil
1 scallion, thinly sliced
 
 In a small bowl, combine all the above ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade 
for 2 to 3 pounds of chicken, pork, or lamb.

In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade for 2 to 3 
pounds of chicken, pork, or lamb.
 
Provençal Marinade
This marinade gives your food the aroma and flavor of Southern France, especially the 
floral notes of the spices along the Riviera. If possible, obtain fresh herbs for this recipe. 
And if you can find an olive oil made in France, your dish will be even closer to the real 
McCoy.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes
Yield: 1 cup
3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
3 bay leaves, preferably fresh
1/2 teaspoon thyme leaves, fresh or dried

Moroccan Marinade
The wonderfully savory (and slightly pungent) spices of North Africa make this one of 
the most delicious of marinades. Don’t worry about them overpowering the dish 
though; they become milder as the food is cooked.
Preparation time: 8 minutes
Marinating time: 2 to 3 hours
Yield: 3/4 cup
1 small onion, minced
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
1 teaspoon salt
Juice of 1 lemon
6 tablespoons corn or peanut oil
 
 In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade for 2 
to 3 pounds of chicken, beef, pork, or lamb.
 
Lime and Cumin Marinade
The heat of this terrific marinade is tamed by the zing of the lime juice, giving it a taste 
of the tropics. Take a look at the color photo section of this book to see the marinade 
and a few pieces of marinated and grilled chicken on a stick.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 4 to 12 hours
Yield: 1/2 cup
Grated zest from 1 lime
Juice of 2 limes
3 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
1 tablespoon paprika
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons corn or peanut oil
 
 In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade for 2 
to 3 pounds of chicken, pork, or lamb.

Cuban-Style Mojo Marinade
Cuban cooks love to add the tangy-sweet flavor of orange and lime juices to many of 
their foods. They also like cilantro, but if you don’t like the flavor it brings, feel free to 
omit it (or you can strain it out after marinating). In the color photo section of this 
book, we show this marinade along with some marinated and grilled flank steaks.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 2 to 4 hours or overnight
Yield: 1/2 cup
Juice of 2 limes
Juice of 1 orange
1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped, or 1/2 
teaspoon dried
6 cloves garlic, peeled and well crushed
1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons corn or peanut oil
1/3 cup cilantro (coriander) leaves, chopped
 
 In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade for 2 
to 3 pounds of flank or skirt steak.
 
Greek Marinade
Fresh Mediterranean oregano is more subtle than most and is a great choice for this 
marinade, but any dried oregano is fine to use if you can’t get fresh flowers of the 
Mediterranean variety. Greek cuisine uses sauces and marinades with these simple 
ingredients on numerous dishes just to add a single herbal note along with the sweet 
pungency of the onion and the mollifying effect of the oil and lemon.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours
Yield: 1/2 cup
1 small onion, minced
Juice of 1 lemon
2 teaspoons oregano, fresh or dried
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons olive oil
In a small bowl, combine all the ingredients and stir to blend. Use as a marinade for 2 to 3 
pounds of chicken, lamb, or pork.

Gingery Grilled Vegetable Marinade
This vegetable marinade combines soy sauce, ginger, and sesame oil with the zing of 
Tabasco sauce. It’s especially delicious with tomatoes, onions, summer squash (zuc-
chini or yellow squash), and mushrooms. However, it clashes with the bitterness of egg-
plant, so choose vegetables with an element of sweetness, and you won’t go wrong. 
Plum or Roma tomatoes work especially well.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Yield: 1 cup
1/2 cup white wine vinegar
1/3 cup light soy sauce
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons fresh ginger, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons Tabasco sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
6 to 7 cups sliced vegetables
 1 In a medium mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, make the marinade by combining all 
the ingredients except the vegetables.
 2 Place the sliced vegetables in a 1-gallon, resealable plastic bag or other large container; 
pour the marinade over the vegetables in the bag or container.
 3 Press the air out of the bag and seal tightly, or cover the container. Refrigerate for 30 
minutes to l hour, turning the bag over once or occasionally tossing the vegetables in 
the container. Marinate vegetables in the bag for 30 minutes. The marinade may be 
used as a basting sauce too.
 4 Grill over a medium-hot fire. Grilling time will depend on the thickness of the vegeta-
bles. (See Chapter 17 for more information on grilling vegetables.)
Go-With: Arrange these attractive veggies on a large platter, surrounding grilled fish, meat, 
poultry, or pork. Or try tossing them into hot, steamy pasta or a green salad. Leftovers can 
be diced up into a tasty relish for hot dogs, hamburgers, and grilled steaks.

Flavoring with Oils: The Slick Solution
Sometimes all you need to boost the flavor of tender cuts of meat, boneless 
poultry, or delicate fish is a light brushing of oil, to which you have added 
chopped herbs, a little garlic, or a few spices. Oils have a way of insulating 
the foods from being burned and keeping them moist. Never pour oil on food, 
though, because it may flare up. Instead, always use a brush. After you’ve 
created your flavorful oil, refrigerate it for 1 to 2 hours (or even less, if you 
don’t have the time).
 
Be sure to discard all unused oil. In a short time, the fresh ingredients you 
add to the oil become a breeding ground for harmful bacteria, so toss it out as 
soon as you’ve finished coating the food.
Use any of the following oils to generously brush 11/2 to 2 pounds of steak, 
chicken, fish, or pork. Brush both sides before grilling.
 
✓ Lemon-Rosemary Oil: You infuse this oil with rosemary and other sea-
sonings by pureeing all the ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth 
the following ingredients: 6 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup minced rose-
mary leaves, 3 cloves peeled and crushed garlic, 2 teaspoons lemon 
juice, and 2 teaspoons grated lemon peel. Because you must make this 
oil with fresh rosemary, you may decide to plant a rosemary pot in a 
sunny outdoor spot, or even indoors on a kitchen windowsill.
 
 Go-With: Brush this oil on about 2 pounds of sirloin steaks, or tender 
beef kebabs; on fish fillets or fish steaks; on boneless chicken breasts; or 
on sea scallop kebabs. Grill over a medium to medium-hot fire.
 
✓ Ginger-Soy Oil: Whisk together 1/4 cup peanut or vegetable oil, 2 
tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon peeled 
and grated ginger (or 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger), 1 clove peeled and 
crushed garlic, and salt and pepper to taste.
 
 Go-With: This oil is delicious brushed on 11/2 to 2 pounds of tender beef 
cuts, chicken or turkey parts, or fish.
 
✓ Mustard-Worcestershire Oil: Spoon 1/4 cup Dijon-style mustard in a small 
mixing bowl. Add  1/2 cup olive oil in a slow, steady stream, beating con-
stantly with a fork or wire whisk to blend the mustard into the oil until 
the sauce is smooth and creamy. Whisk in 2 teaspoons Worcestershire 
sauce (or more or less to taste). Season to taste with salt and pepper.
 
 Go-With: Brush this sharp, mustard-flavored oil on pieces of chicken, 
fish, pork, or tender cuts of lamb or beef before grilling.

Rub-a-Dub-Dub: Coating Foods 
with Dry Rubs
Rubs are usually a dry combination of herbs and spices, although sometimes 
a little oil is added to moisten the mixture. You simply massage rubs onto the 
surface of the food and end up with a wonderful crispy crust. Cooking with 
rubs is beneficial because:
 
✓ Rubs can be added at the last minute. It’s best to give a rub at least 30 
minutes (preferably several hours or overnight) to penetrate and flavor 
meat, but if you don’t have the luxury of time, you can still get good 
results — unlike with marinades, which sometimes need hours to pen-
etrate the meat.
 
✓ Rubs usually contain little or no oil and therefore little fat. Flare-ups 
on the grill are eliminated and your waist line will thank you.
 
✓ Rubs stick to the surface of foods better than marinades. They form a 
tasty crusty exterior that complements the food’s interior flavors.
Small tender pieces of fish or shellfish will benefit from about 30 minutes of 
standing time after applying a rub. A whole, spice-rubbed turkey or chicken 
should be plastic-wrapped to hold the rub tightly against its skin and then 
refrigerated overnight.
 
The amount of rub used to cover the surface of a piece of meat is entirely a 
matter of taste, but our rule calls for about 1 tablespoon for every pound of 
food. To help the rub cling to the food’s surface, apply it to food that’s either 
completely dry or coated with a little oil. When seasoning poultry, spread the 
rub evenly over the surface and also under the skin as much as possible, being 
careful not to tear it.
Rub mixtures often call for crushed whole spices. You can best accomplish 
this task with a mortar and pestle; but if you don’t have this kitchen tool, 
place the spices in a plastic bag and pound them with a rolling pin or a meat 
mallet until finely crushed. You also may use a food processor or even a 
coffee grinder. However, make sure the residue and oils from the ground 
coffee are completely removed from the grinder or they will flavor the rub 
ingredients.
Rubs that are completely dry, without any oil or liquid ingredient, can be 
stored indefinitely in airtight containers in a cool, dry place.

3/4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
3/4 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
 
Hot and Sweet Spice Rub
This rub gives an interesting sweet and spicy flavor to all kinds of meat, especially 
lamb.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Yield: 2 tablespoons
2 teaspoons hot chili powder, like 
cayenne
1 teaspoon paprika

 Combine all the ingredients except the vegetable or olive oil in a small bowl. Brush the 
meat generously with the vegetable or olive oil on all sides, and then rub the spice mix-
ture onto the meat with your fingers. Cover the meat with plastic wrap or place it in a 
resealable bag and refrigerate 30 minutes or more before grilling.
 
 Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl. Using your fingers, generously rub the mix-
ture on both sides of the steaks; cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 20 to 30 min-
utes as the grill preheats. Grill over medium heat until done as desired. Season with 
additional salt after grilling (if desired).
 
Peppery Dried Herb Rub
One of the charms of rub recipes is that they’re flexible — they can be altered to satisfy 
your individual taste. For example, you can increase the spiciness in this rub by adding 
ground white pepper or additional cayenne pepper. For a touch of sweetness, you can 
add a little dark brown sugar. If you don’t like thyme, eliminate it and substitute another 
herb, like dried marjoram. Or use freshly grated orange peel instead of lemon peel. It 
works well with any kind of meat, especially pork.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes
Yield: About 3 tablespoons, or enough for about 11/2 to 2 pounds of meat
1 tablespoon paprika
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel (from about 1 
lemon)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano leaves
3/4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Vegetable or olive oil

Five Spice Asian Rub
Five spice powder is an aromatic mixture of equal parts cinnamon, cloves, fennel seed, 
star anise, and sometimes ginger or crushed Szechwan peppercorns. Commercial 
blends of five spice powder are available in Asian markets and many supermarket spice 
sections.
One batch of this recipe is enough rub for about a pound of steak. You can double or 
triple the ingredients to cover more food. It’s also an excellent rub for pork and poultry.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
Yield: 1/3 cup

Middle Eastern Rub
The aromas that this rub will produce on the grill will cause major salivating by your 
guests (or family). It has many levels of spice flavors that meld beautifully together and 
give a lot of taste to red meat and chicken. The flavors are probably too much for sea-
food. The turmeric gives the meat a lovely golden-orange color. Be careful to keep the 
heat somewhat low or grill indirectly, because these spices can easily burn.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 1 hour or overnight
Yield: 2 tablespoons
1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
11/2 teaspoon salt
 
 Combine all ingredients and use as a rub for 2 to 21/2 pounds of beef, poultry, or pork. 
Coat the food lightly with oil before applying the rub. After rubbing, let the food rest in 
refrigerator for at least 1 hour or even overnight.

E
very grilling chef needs an arsenal of recipes 
for sauces and condiments, such as salsas, 
chutneys, and compound butters. All these 
concoctions elevate a humble steak, grilled 
chicken, pork chop, or hamburger into something 
sublime. You can prepare many of these recipes 
ahead of time and store them in the refrigerator, 
thereby allowing you to focus your full attention 
on the grill. All of them complement the unique 
flavors of grilled foods while adding taste, color, 
and pizzazz.
Adding Flavor with 
Warm Sauces
When you grill, the wonderful cooking juices 
that ordinarily end up in the pan (with top-of-
stove or oven roasting techniques) are lost into 
the fire. To compensate for this sad fact, grilling 
gurus — like yourself — keep a file of quick and 
easy sauces that add a last-minute finish to that sizzling steak, chop, piece of 
chicken, or fish fillet. In this section, we give you a few of our favorite recipes 
for warm sauces you can serve with all kinds of grilled foods. These recipes 
only make a few servings of sauce, so if you’re feeding a crowd, be sure to 
double or even triple the recipe.

Roasted Garlic and Red Pepper Puree
Pureed vegetable sauces made from blends of tomatoes, cucumbers, greens like water-
cress or arugula, and a binding ingredient like yogurt, sour cream, olive oil, or mayon-
naise are wonderful accompaniments to fresh grilled fish fillets. They’re easy to 
assemble in the blender and often give plain-looking fish a lovely ribbon of color.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Grilling time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup (approximately 8 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 large sweet red peppers
1 head of garlic with skin
1 tablespoon butter
1⁄4 cup light cream or half-and-half
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill.
 2 Place the peppers and head of garlic directly on an oiled grill.
 3 Grill the garlic cloves for 8 to 10 minutes or until their papery skin is lightly browned 
and the flesh is soft, turning once. Remove from the grid. Cool slightly and press the 
cloves out of their skin. Set 4 to 5 cloves aside.
 4 Grill the peppers for a total of 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, until their 
skin is completely blackened all over. Immediately place the peppers in a brown paper 
bag and let them stand for 10 minutes to steam off their skin.
 5 When the peppers are cool enough to handle, use a paring knife to peel, core, and 
remove the seeds (see Figure 6-1). (If the skin doesn’t slip off easily, grill the pepper for 
a few minutes more.) Cut the peppers into large pieces and place in a blender container 
with the roasted and peeled garlic cloves; puree until smooth. (For a terrific low-calorie 
sauce with plenty of flavor, stop at this point. Serve the sauce over grilled fish or 
chicken.)
 6 In a small skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the pureed pepper mixture 
and the light cream or half-and-half. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 minute or just until 
warmed through. Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Spoon 
over grilled fish fillets or fish steaks.

Mushroom-Butter Sauce
This classic butter sauce is a delicious accompaniment to beef or other savory meats or 
vegetables. Of course, it’s great on pasta, too! The shallots give it a nice little kick.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cook time: 20 minutes
Yield: 2
1⁄2 cups (approximately 20 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
3 tablespoons peeled and finely chopped 
shallots
1
1⁄2 cups chicken broth
1⁄3 cup finely chopped mushrooms (button, 
shitake, or a combination)
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley
 1 In a small saucepan or skillet, melt the butter and oil over medium heat. Add the shal-
lots and cook for 2 minutes or until they’re softened and lightly browned.
 2 Add the chicken broth and boil the mixture gently for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Add the mushrooms and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes or until the mixture is reduced 
by half and has thickened slightly. Remove the mixture from the heat and sprinkle with 
the parsley. This sauce can be prepared ahead and held in the refrigerator for several 
hours or days. Reheat in a small saucepan or skillet, over low heat, just before serving.

Ginger Cream
Ginger Cream is a delicious finishing sauce for grilled swordfish, salmon fillets, or 
shrimp. It has a light pungency and sweetness from the mix of ginger and tomato, and 
the cream adds a lovely texture that goes especially well with seafood of every kind. If 
it’s more convenient for you, make this sauce in advance, refrigerate, and gently reheat 
in the top of a double boiler.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Cooking time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 1
1⁄4 cups (approximately 10 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
1⁄2 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons peeled and minced shallots
2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger, 
or 
3⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
1⁄3 cup seeded and finely chopped tomato
1 cup heavy cream
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 In a medium saucepan, combine the wine, chicken broth, shallots, and ginger. Bring to a 
boil over medium-high heat; boil, uncovered, for several minutes until reduced to about 
half its volume.
 2 Add the tomato and cream; return to a gentle boil over medium heat and cook until 
thickened and reduced to about 1
1⁄4 cups, stirring and occasionally scraping the bottom 
of the pan with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon peel; adjust 
seasoning with salt and pepper.
Vary It! For a mustard-flavored sauce, omit the ginger and add 1 to 2 teaspoons of Dijon-
style mustard. For a saffron-flavored sauce, omit the ginger and stir in 4 to 5 threads of saf-
fron with the tomatoes and cream.

Mustard and Rosemary 
 
Grilled Chicken Sauce
This basting sauce works well with any grilled chicken — especially if the chicken has 
been brined. (See Chapter 14 for brining details.) However, if you choose not to brine, 
be sure to sprinkle the chicken pieces with salt before grilling. This sauce is also good 
with quail and turkey.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cook time: 2 minutes
Yield: About 
1⁄2 cup (approximately 4 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
1⁄4 cup butter
2 medium cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄4 cup Dijon-style mustard
3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves, 
or 1 tablespoon crumbled dried rosemary
Pepper to taste
 1 Warm the butter in a small saucepan over low heat and, before the butter is completely 
melted, add the garlic; cook for about 30 seconds, being careful not to let either the 
butter or the garlic brown. Remove from the heat immediately; stir in the mustard, rose-
mary, and pepper.
 2 Divide the sauce in half, reserving about 
1⁄4 cup to serve with the grilled chicken. Brush 
the other half generously on the chicken during the last 4 to 5 minutes of grilling.

Tarragon Sauce
This sauce, the essence of summer itself, is delicious with chicken, veal, fish, and vege-
tables. It can be made in advance, but the tarragon should be thoroughly rinsed, dried, 
and chopped just before serving because it loses its aroma quickly. We recommend 
using only fresh tarragon, because that spice’s aroma and flavor are altered in the 
drying process.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 
1⁄2 cup (approximately 4 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 tablespoons minced shallots
2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1⁄2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives
1
1⁄2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon
Freshly ground pepper
 
 In a medium-size bowl, combine the shallots, vinegar, and salt and let stand for 5 min-
utes. Add the mustard and whisk to blend. Slowly add the olive oil, whisking continually 
to produce a creamy consistency. Then add the mayonnaise and whisk to incorporate. 
Add the pepper, tarragon, and chives. This sauce can be made hours ahead, but add the 
tarragon just before it is to be served. Serve at room temperature.

Creamy Asian Peanut Sauce
This sauce recipe, flavored with peanut butter, is especially good drizzled over grilled 
pork chops. Use it to baste pork or chicken kebabs, or use it as a rich and elegant finish-
ing sauce for grilled pork tenderloin. You can also use it as a sauce for a side dish of 
noodles (Chinese egg noodles, Japanese noodles, or linguine are best). You can refriger-
ate this sauce for several days, up to a week, and it can be heated or served at room 
temperature.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup (approximately 8 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons dry sherry
2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter
1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons honey
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1⁄4 cup peanut or vegetable oil
4 scallions, both white and green parts, 
chopped
Pepper to taste
 
 In a small bowl or measuring cup, whisk together the soy sauce, sherry, peanut butter, 
ginger, sugar, honey, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Slowly add the oil in a steady 
stream, whisking as you pour, until the sauce is smooth and creamy. Stir in the scal-
lions and black pepper.
Vary It! If you want to serve this sauce over noodles, prepare the pasta and reserve 2 
tablespoons of the boiling water before draining. Drain the noodles and transfer them back 
to the pasta pot; add the sauce and, only if necessary, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of the 
reserved noodle liquid. Add only enough liquid to help bind the sauce to the noodles, but 
not so much that the sauce becomes thin and watery.

Chillin’ Out: Working with Cold Sauces
Cold sauces are in many ways traditional to various ethnic foods, but there 
really is a reason they’re served cold: In hot weather and hot climates like the 
Mediterranean, India, and Southeast Asia, they have a cooling effect on the 
palate while adding flavor to the hot grilled food.
 
Raita
No Middle Eastern, Indian, or Pakistani appetizer or main course would be complete 
without a cooling yogurt-based sauce. The cucumber adds a pleasing vegetal flavor 
while the mint gives it piquancy. Use it as a dipping sauce or drizzle it over fish, poultry, 
or meats, especially kebabs.
Preparation: 45 minutes
Chilling time: 1 hour
Yield: About 2 cups (approximately 16 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 small cucumbers, peeled, seeded, and 
grated
2 teaspoons salt
1
1⁄2 cups plain yogurt, preferably Greek style
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄2 seeded and minced jalapeño pepper or to 
taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves
1
1⁄2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 
(coriander) leaves
1⁄4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
 1 In a colander, add cucumbers and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons salt. Mix and let sit and 
drain for 30 minutes. After draining, place cucumbers on paper towels and pat dry.
 2 Meanwhile, roast the ground cumin by placing it in a small fry pan and keeping it over 
medium-low heat until it starts to smell roasted, about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from 
the heat immediately.
 3 In a medium bowl, toss the drained cucumber, yogurt, roasted cumin, jalapeño, mint, 
cilantro, black pepper, and salt. Refrigerate for 1 hour.

Creamy Horseradish Sauce
This sauce, which combines sour cream, horseradish, fresh lemon juice, and ripe 
chopped tomatoes, is terrific with grilled sausage, fish steaks, shellfish, burgers, or 
poultry.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 
2⁄3 cup (approximately 5 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
1⁄2 cup sour cream
1⁄4 cup chopped ripe tomatoes
2 tablespoons bottled horseradish, drained
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Pepper to taste
 
 Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl; cover and chill until ready to serve.

Tahini Dressing
Tahini, a paste made from sesame seeds, is an important ingredient in Middle Eastern 
cuisine. This recipe combines tahini with lemon juice and honey into a semi-sweet, 
nutty dressing that you can drizzle over grilled chicken, turkey, lamb, beef, or vegeta-
bles. Or you can use it as a dressing for sandwich wraps made with flour tortillas, 
grilled chicken, chopped tomatoes, and shredded lettuce. If you want a more tart lemon 
taste, use only 2 teaspoons of honey rather than 1 tablespoon.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 
1⁄2 cup (approximately 4 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
1⁄4 cup tahini
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon honey
1 teaspoon olive oil
3 to 4 tablespoons water
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
Salt and pepper
 
 In a blender, combine the tahini, lemon juice, honey, oil, and as much water as neces-
sary to make a smooth, thick dressing. Transfer to a small bowl; stir in the grated lemon 
peel and season with salt and pepper. This dressing can be covered and stored in the 
refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Teriyaki Sauce
Teriyaki sauce is by tradition used on beef by Japanese cooks, but it’s just as good on 
pork, chicken, and seafood. You can use it either as a finishing sauce (as in this recipe), 
or you can use it more traditionally — as a sauce reduced to a sweet glaze. You can 
make it thicker simply by cooking it down in a saucepan for a few minutes. It caramelizes 
quickly, so keep stirring until you get the consistency you desire.
Preparation: 2 minutes
Cooking: 3 minutes
Yield: 1 cup (approximately 8 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
1⁄3 cup soy sauce
1⁄3 cup mirin rice wine or sweet sake
1⁄3 cup sake
1 tablespoon sugar
1 small clove garlic, crushed (optional)
 
 In a saucepan, combine the soy sauce, mirin, sake, sugar, and garlic (if desired). Bring 
the mixture to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes until syrupy. Let the mixture cool, 
remove the garlic, if used, and refrigerate until ready to use. The sauce will keep for sev-
eral days, even weeks in the refrigerator.

Complementing Foods with Condiments
Bottled ketchup, mustard, relish, and tomato salsa are the most popular con-
diments on any griller’s table, and we think that using only those standbys is 
a mistake. So this section takes you to a new level of grilling greatness with 
recipes for homemade salsas, flavored mayonnaise dressings, savory pastes, 
and easy chutneys. Before you run screaming from the room, clutching the 
ketchup bottle to your chest, why not try a couple?

Fresh Tomato Salsa
Fortunately for us, juicy, ripe tomatoes come to market just when the grilling season 
really kicks into gear.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups (approximately 8 servings at 
1⁄4 cup per serving)
2 large ripe tomatoes, seeded and diced
1 small onion, peeled and diced
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 
(coriander) or parsley
1⁄2  to 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped
1
1⁄2 tablespoons olive oil
Juice of half a lime
Salt and pepper to taste
Tabasco sauce to taste
 
 In a small mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients. Cover and let stand at room temper-
ature for at least 15 minutes before serving. It will keep in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 
days.
Go-With: You must try this salsa with our Best-Ever Fajitas recipe in Chapter 17. It’s also 
good with plain, grilled fish (Chapter 15) or chicken (Chapter 14).
Vary It! For salsa with a twist, substitute 2 tablespoons tequila for the lime juice in the 
original recipe.

Salsas
Salsa is the Mexican word for sauce and can denote a combination of cold 
or hot ingredients. We use salsa in this book as a condiment or as a savory 
mixture of chopped, fresh, cold ingredients. Fresh salsas take little time to 
prepare, are a lot more flavorful and viscous than the jarred variety, and are 
colorful companions to grilled dishes of every kind. And, of course, they’re 
great dips for tortilla chips!

Roasted Sweet Pepper Salsa
Make up a batch of this roasted pepper salsa on the weekend so you can serve it as a 
side dish for grilled meats, fish, and poultry the rest of the week.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 1 hour
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups (approximately 4 servings at 
1⁄2 cup per serving)
2 red bell peppers
1 green bell pepper
1 yellow bell pepper
1⁄4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
1 to 2 tablespoons capers, rinsed and drained
1 tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Place the peppers on a lightly oiled grid. Grill, covered, for 20 to 25 minutes or until 
blackened all over, giving them a quarter turn every 6 to 8 minutes or when the side 
facing the heat blackens. Place the peppers in a paper bag; close the bag and let stand 
for 10 minutes to steam and loosen the skins.
 3 Using a paring knife, core and seed the peppers (see Figure 6-1); slice into thin strips 
about 2 inches long and 
1⁄2-inch wide and place in a medium mixing bowl.
 4 In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the olive oil and vinegar. Stir in the capers, 
parsley, garlic, and salt and pepper. Pour the dressing over the roasted peppers. Cover 
and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to mellow the flavors. (The peppers are best if made a 
day ahead.) Serve with everything from burgers to grilled fish.
Vary It! You can substitute 2 to 3 tablespoons chopped, oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes for 
the capers. You also can add 2 tablespoons pignoli, or pine nuts, that have been toasted in 
a dry skillet until lightly browned.

salads, as a garnish for grilled chicken or fish, or as a spread for sandwiches stuffed 
with grilled vegetables.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 
1⁄2 cup (approximately 8 servings at 1 tablespoon per serving)
1⁄2 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, 
drained and coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
Pepper to taste
 
 Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor. Puree until smooth, stop-
ping as necessary to scrape down the sides of the container.

Chutneys
Chutney is a condiment of Indian origin containing fruits or vegetables, vin-
egar, sugar, and spices. It’s also called “Indian pickle.” In that vast country 
are thousands of recipes both wet and dry for these savory-sweet-sour 
condiments. In the 19th century chutneys were bottled and exported to 
Great Britain, where they became popular with curry dishes, as they are 
everywhere now. They’re usually served at room temperature, and the best, 
of course, are homemade, like ours. They go well with highly spiced grilled 
items because the sourness and sweetness cut the heat.

Tomato Chutney
This recipe treats tomatoes like the fruits that they are — sweetening them with brown 
sugar to make a chutney that’s great with grilled foods. This chutney goes especially 
well with grilled beef, poultry, or pork.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 2 cups (approximately 16 servings at 2 tablespoons per serving)
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 onion, peeled and chopped
1⁄2 cup light brown sugar, packed
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
1⁄2 to 1 large jalapeño pepper, seeded and 
chopped
3 cups seeded and chopped tomatoes
1⁄2 teaspoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated
 1 In a medium sauté pan or skillet, heat the oil over medium heat; add the onion and cook 
for 7 minutes or until lightly browned and very soft, stirring occasionally.
 2 Add the brown sugar, vinegar, and jalapeño pepper; cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring 
occasionally until the mixture is dark brown and syrupy.
 3 Stir in the tomatoes, raise the heat to medium-high, and boil gently for 5 more minutes 
or until the liquid is reduced and the mixture has thickened. Remove from heat and stir 
in the ginger, adding more to taste (if desired). Serve warm, or cover and chill.
Vary It! You can remove the tomato skins before making the chutney. To do so, plunge the 
whole tomatoes into boiling water for about 15 seconds or until the skins begin to split. 
Then chill in a bowl of ice water before slipping off the skins.

Summer Squash Chutney
Summer squash is combined with sweet orange juice, tart lemon juice, honey, and red 
onion for this chutney. We suggest serving this chutney with grilled chicken, pork, 
lamb, or beef.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Chilling time: 1 to 2 hours
Yield: About 2
1⁄2 cups (approximately 10 servings at 
1⁄4 cup per serving)
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 cup peeled and chopped red onion
2 small yellow squash (about 1 pound total), 
diced
2 small zucchini (about 1 pound total), diced
2 teaspoons fresh ginger, peeled and grated
1⁄2 cup fresh orange juice
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons honey
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 In a heavy, medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat; add the red onion 
and cook for about 2 minutes, stirring often until the onion is soft and wilted. Add the 
squash, zucchini, and ginger; cook, stirring just to coat the vegetables in the oil.
 2 Add the orange and lemon juices; raise the heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil. 
Reduce heat to low and simmer partially covered for 20 to 25 minutes or until the vege-
tables are soft. (If the liquid has evaporated, cover completely during the last 5 minutes 
of cooking or add a little more orange juice to moisten.)
 3 Remove from heat and stir in the honey and orange peel. Adjust seasoning with salt and 
pepper. Cover and chill for a few hours before serving.

Cherry and Pear Chutney
Here’s a perfect combo of sweet and sour flavors, which is ideal for hot, spicy dishes, 
especially Indian and southeast Asian dishes. You can serve this chutney with just 
about anything, including grilled chicken, pork, lamb, or fish.
Preparation: 35 minutes
Cooking time: 25 to 30 minutes
Chilling time: 30 minutes
Yield: 3
1⁄2 cups (approximately 16 servings at 
1⁄4 cup per serving)
6 ounces dried cherries
1⁄2 cup sugar
1 cup water
Thinly sliced zest from 1 lemon
2-inch piece of ginger, peeled and thinly 
julienned
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
Juice of 2 lemons
3 Bosc pears, peeled, cored, and cut into 
1⁄2-
inch cubes
1 small red bell pepper, cut into 
1⁄4-inch pieces
3⁄4 teaspoons salt
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
 
 In a large saucepan, add the cherries, sugar, and water. Bring to a boil and gently 
simmer for 2 minutes. Add the lemon zest, ginger, pepper flakes, lemon juice, pears, red 
bell pepper, and salt. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat, cover, and gently simmer for 
10 to 12 minutes or until the pears are tender. Add the vinegar to the pears and simmer 
for 2 minutes. Let cool and refrigerate for 30 minutes. You can use the chutney immedi-
ately, but the flavors blend better if made 1 to 2 days in advance.

Other condiments
Not all condiments fall under the categories in the preceding sections, but we 
don’t want to leave these delicious accents out. Use the condiments in this 
section however you like — on their own with chips, crackers, or pita bread 
to dip or scoop them, on top of a burger, or on the side of the grilled food of 
your choosing.
 
Tapenade
This oh-so-rich, classic French paste is from the Riviera where the olives are wonderful 
and the anchovies are canned or bottled in oil. Tapenade makes a great condiment for 
grilled steaks or fish, served either right on top or on the side. It’s especially wonderful 
served as an appetizer on grilled slices of hard-crusted Italian or French bread.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 
2⁄3 cup (approximately 10 servings at 1 tablespoon per serving)
1 cup pitted black olives
3 canned anchovy fillets, blotted dry with 
paper towels
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons capers, rinsed and drained
1
1⁄2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
Pepper to taste
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil, red 
onion, or tomato, for garnish
 
 In a blender or food processor, combine the olives, anchovies, garlic, capers, lemon 
juice, oil, and pepper. Process into a coarse puree. (If using a blender, stop as neces-
sary to scrape down the sides.) Transfer to a nonreactive container. Serve at room tem-
perature or cover and refrigerate. Garnish with basil, red onion, or tomato before 
serving. Use within one week.

Guacamole
Here’s our version of the Mexican classic: nice and spicy and very creamy. Just make 
sure your avocado is properly ripe — the Haas variety is the best. They should be black 
in color and soft to the touch.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 2 cups (approximately 4 servings at 
1⁄2 cup per serving)
2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted
Juice of 1 lime
1 garlic clove, peeled and minced
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons seeded and minced jalapeño 
pepper, or to taste
2 scallions, thinly sliced
4 tablespoons chopped cilantro (coriander) 
leaves
2 tablespoons sour cream
3⁄4 teaspoons salt
1⁄4 teaspoons freshly ground peppercorns
 1 Roast the ground cumin by placing it in a small fry pan and keeping it over medium-low 
heat until it starts to smell roasted, about 6 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat 
immediately.
 2 In a bowl, roughly mash the avocados with a fork to make a coarse puree. Add the lime 
juice, garlic, roasted cumin, jalapeño, scallions, cilantro, sour cream, salt, and pepper. 
Mix to blend. Serve immediately or chill for an hour. Guacamole doesn’t last long in the 
refrigerator and may turn brown fairly quickly. However, placing the avocado pits in the 
guacamole prevents it from turning brown so quickly.
Go-With: Guacamole is delicious as a garnish or condiment for any kind of tender grilled 
steak (Chapter 11) and also goes well with Best-Ever Fajitas (Chapter 17).
Vary It! You can add all sorts of ingredients to the Guacamole to change its flavor in a 
heartbeat. Experiment by adding any of the following ingredients to taste: bottled salsa, 
chopped black olives, onions (rather than scallions), chopped sun-dried tomatoes or 
chopped fresh tomatoes, or seeded and chopped chile peppers.

Barbecued Onions
Slow cooking onions in a little oil and butter and then adding a favorite barbecue sauce 
turns them into a slightly caramelized topping that’s perfect for grilled burgers, hot 
dogs, sausage, or steaks. If you want to make your own barbecue sauce, check out 
Chapter 9 for the Country-Style Barbecue Sauce recipe.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Cooking time: 20 minutes
Yield: About 1
1⁄3 cups (approximately 4 servings at 
1⁄3 cup per serving)
4 large yellow onions
3 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 tablespoon light brown sugar, packed
1⁄2 cup bottled or homemade barbecue sauce
 1 Peel the onions; cut each onion in half vertically through the core, lay the halves flat, 
and slice thinly into half rounds.
 2 In a large heavy-bottomed skillet, heat the butter and oil over medium-low heat. Add the 
onion slices and brown sugar; stir well, coating the onions in the oil and sugar. Cook for 
15 to 20 minutes or until the onions are very soft and browned, stirring often and occa-
sionally scraping the bottom of the pan.
 3 Stir in the barbecue sauce; continue cooking for 2 to 3 minutes more, stirring often until 
the onions are very tender and the sauce is warmed through.

Dressing Up Your Meal Using 
Compound Butters
Compound butter is butter that’s dressed up with a few herbs, spices, or 
other intense seasonings. A small pat on a sizzling steak can increase the 
pleasure of a beefy meal. Compound butters are great with all sorts of foods, 
including grilled meats, fish, poultry, and many vegetables, and they’re more 
appropriate than a heavy sauce in warm weather. Place a pat of butter on 
top of a thick steak, boneless grilled chicken breasts, or grilled fish; or toss 
grilled vegetables with butter to taste.

Compound Butter
Prepare compound butters according to the steps in Figure 6-2. Following this basic 
compound butter recipe is a list of tasty variations.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings at 1 tablespoon per serving
1 stick of softened, unsalted butter
Herbs and spices to taste
 1 Use a food processor, blender, or sharp chef’s knife to grind up or finely mince the 
seasonings.
 2 Using a rubber spatula, wooden spoon, or your hands and a small bowl, soften the 
butter until it’s malleable but not too soft.
 3 Work in the seasonings with a fork or with your hands.
 4 Spoon the mixture onto a sheet of waxed paper and use the paper to shape the butter 
mixture into a cylinder or log that has a diameter of about 2 inches.
 5 Wrap well and refrigerate or freeze until ready to use. The butter keeps frozen for 1 to 2 
months. When ready to use, simply slice off into butter pats that are 1- to 1
1⁄2-inches 
thick.

In place of “herbs and spices to taste” in the Compound Butter recipe, substi-
tute the following:
 
✓ Lemon and Fresh Herb Butter: Use 2 tablespoons finely chopped herbs 
(such as dill, basil, tarragon, thyme, marjoram, parsley, or sage), 1 tea-
spoon fresh lemon juice, 1 clove garlic (peeled and minced), and salt 
and pepper to taste. This butter works well with fish, pork, chicken, 
beef, and roasted vegetables.
 
✓ Spicy Chili Butter: Sprinkle in 1
1⁄2 teaspoons chili powder, 
1⁄4 teaspoon 
paprika, 8 drops Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper to taste. This 
butter is delicious with grilled corn, chicken, or fish or as a spread for 
grilled breads.
 
✓ Toasted Cashew and Brandy Butter: Add 
1⁄4 cup toasted and chopped 
cashews, 1 tablespoon brandy or cognac, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Pair with grilled steaks or chicken.

112
Part II: Adding Spice to Your Life 
 
✓ Ginger and Scallion Butter: Use 3 tablespoons finely chopped scal-
lions, 2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger (or 
3⁄4 teaspoon ground 
ginger), a pinch of garlic salt, and salt and pepper to taste. Try this 
butter with fish, pork, and grilled vegetables.
 
✓ Roasted Garlic Butter: Roast about 20 cloves (flip to Chapter 16 to find 
out how to roast garlic on the grill) and slip them out of their skin. (Save 
and use any remaining cloves for adding to mashed potatoes or for 
spreading on grilled slices of Italian bread.) Mash the cloves coarsely 
before blending into butter with salt and pepper to taste. The garlic can 
also be foil-wrapped and roasted in a 350-degree oven for 45 minutes to 
1 hour.

Everyone Loves a Burger
Ground meat patties have been a staple of world cookery for thousands of 
years. They may come in different sizes and shapes, but the ground meat 
patty is always a way of taking less-than-prime meat, tenderizing it, and then 
cooking it quickly for instant gratification. It took some genius — a person 
still unknown to gastronomic history — to come up with the idea of tossing 
a meat patty on a soft bun and then heaping ketchup and other condiments 
on it to make a complete meal in itself. Well, a burger is almost a complete 
meal — as long as you have french fries on the side and top it with lettuce 
and tomato.
A hamburger that has been carefully shaped and plumped to a proper 
thickness, grilled to a perfect medium-rare, with a slightly charred exterior, 
set on top of a toasted bun, and served with homemade condiments is a 
grand, glorious, and simple food.

Choosing your burger meat
A grilled burger is probably the easiest and most commonly grilled food 
in America, but most of us are often disappointed with the results for two 
reasons: Either the burger patty is too thick to begin with and cooks to a 
frazzle on the edges, while remaining too pink or even raw in the middle, or 
the patty meat is too lean and dries out.

Although your choice of burger meat is a matter of personal preference, we 
believe that the juiciest hamburgers are made with ground beef that’s about 
80 to 85 percent meat and 15 to 20 percent fat. You can find this ratio in 
chuck — the best all-around cut for a perfect, juicy hamburger.
Creating the mixture of ingredients
Ground meat (and nowadays, soy, ground veggies, and other vegetarian 
options) offer plenty of opportunity for burger variety. In this section, we’ve 
included a burger recipe that we especially like, but we certainly don’t want 
to leave you, hands tied, with our favorite recipe as the only option we give 
you. To make a run-of-the-mill burger, simply add 
1⁄4 teaspoon of salt and 
1⁄4 
teaspoon of pepper to 1
1⁄2 pounds of ground chuck, mixing the seasonings 
into the meat with your hands.
Vary It! Use the following hamburger variations to spark your own burger 
creations. Each of these seasoning combinations works for 1
1⁄2 pounds of raw 
ground meat:
 
✓ Italian Burger: Add the following ingredients to the ground meat mix-
ture: l egg yolk; 
1⁄4 cup grated onion; l large clove garlic, peeled and 
minced; 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil or 2 teaspoons dried crushed 
basil; 
1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano; and salt and pepper to taste. Place 
grated Parmesan cheese on top of each burger (if desired) about 2 min-
utes before the burger is done, and then grill, covered, until the cheese 
melts.
 
✓ Mexican Burger: Add the following ingredients to the ground meat mix-
ture: 
1⁄4 cup finely chopped onion, 
1⁄2 to 1 teaspoon seeded and chopped 
jalapeño pepper, 
3⁄4 teaspoon ground cumin, and salt and pepper to taste. 
(Refer to Chapter 4 for the scoop on how to handle chilies.) Serve on 
toasted buns or in warmed tortillas with a prepared tomato salsa or taco 
sauce and slices of ripe avocado.
 
✓ Middle Eastern Burger: Add the following ingredients to the ground 
meat mixture: 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion, 2 tablespoons finely 
chopped raisins, 
1⁄2 teaspoon cinnamon, 
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Serve in warmed pita pockets with Tabbouleh. (Flip to 
Chapter 16 for a Tabbouleh recipe.)

117
 Chapter 7: Bun-Lovin’ Burgers, Sausages, and Hot Dogs
 
✓ Asian Spiced Burger: Add the following ingredients to the ground meat 
mixture: 
1⁄4 cup finely chopped scallions; 3 tablespoons teriyaki sauce; l 
large clove garlic, peeled and minced; and salt and pepper to taste.
 
✓ Veggie-Stuffed Burger: Add the following ingredients to the ground meat 
mixture: 
1⁄3 cup finely grated carrot; 2 tablespoons finely chopped onion; 
6 tablespoons fine dry bread crumbs; 1 beaten egg; 2 cloves garlic, 
peeled and minced; 1 teaspoon dried crushed marjoram or basil; and 
salt and pepper to taste. Serve on toasted sesame seed buns with slices 
of ripe tomato and alfalfa sprouts.
And if these suggestions aren’t enough, search your pantry or refrigerator 
for any of the following ingredients and add them to the raw meat however 
you see fit: Tabasco sauce, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, pickle juice, dry 
sherry, wheat germ, onion soup mix, cayenne pepper, ground ginger, cilan-
tro (coriander), cumin, garlic salt, chopped canned or fresh mushrooms, 
chopped parsley, tarragon, thyme, sage, other fresh herbs, ground walnuts 
or pecans, Dijon-style mustard, horseradish, lemon juice, and grated lemon 
peel.
Preparing your patties for the grill
For the perfect burger, heed the following bits of advice when prepping pat-
ties for the grill:
 
✓ Be careful not to overmix the patty ingredients; otherwise, you’ll 
toughen the meat. Mix the meat just so it holds together — not so much 
that it gets pasty.
 
✓ When forming your burger patties, try to mold the meat into a uniform, 
fairly flat patty, no thicker than 
3⁄4 inch. A thicker patty, mounded high in 
the center, is less likely to cook evenly — though we have to admit that 
big, fat burgers don’t taste half bad.
O

✓ As you grill the burger, be sure not to press the patty with the flat side 
of a spatula, despite the great temptation to do so. Pressing the patty 
squeezes out the flavorful juices and can also cause dangerous flare-ups.
 
Several grilling cookbooks recommend bringing ground meat to room tem-
perature before placing it on the grill. We disagree. Instead, keep ground 
meat in the refrigerator until just before grilling. This minimizes exposure to 
airborne bacteria. And always place cooked burgers on a clean plate. Never 
return them to the plate you used to carry them to the grill because it may be 
contaminated with bacteria from the uncooked meat.

Turkey Burger
Turkey burgers are a tasty alternative to beef burgers. Seasonings — like those used in 
this recipe — make a big difference in flavor.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1
1⁄4 pounds ground turkey
1 small red pepper, cored, seeded, and finely 
chopped
2 scallions, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons parsley, finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro 
(coriander)
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
4 hamburger buns, toasted on the grill
Mayonnaise or Dijon-style mustard (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, red pepper, scallions, parsley, 
cilantro, garlic, thyme, cumin, Tabasco sauce, and salt and pepper; mix well (without 
overmixing). Gently shape the turkey mixture into 4 burger patties, each about 
3⁄4-inch 
thick.
 3 Place the patties on a well-oiled grill grid. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes or until done, turn-
ing once after 5 minutes. The burgers are done when the juices run clear and the center 
of the patty is cooked to brown with no sign of pink; cut to test.
 4 Serve immediately on buns that have been toasted on the edge of grill until lightly 
browned. Top burgers with the mayonnaise or mustard (if desired).
Remember: The USDA recommends cooking all ground meat to medium or until the center 
is no longer pink.

Gorgonzola Hamburgers with 
 
Balsamic Onion Relish
Here’s a modern burger that packs as much flavor as is possible between two buns. If 
you prefer, blue cheese will do almost as well as Gorgonzola. Check out the color photo 
section to get a look at this delicious burger.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 thinly sliced Spanish onion
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1⁄4 cup balsamic vinegar
1
1⁄2 pounds ground chuck or sirloin
1 tablespoon peanut oil for brushing patties
4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, sliced into 
1⁄2-
inch thick pieces
4 hamburger buns
 1 Preheat your charcoal or gas grill to high.
 2 Meanwhile, to prepare the Balsamic Onion Relish, heat a medium-size sauté pan, and 
when it’s hot add the olive oil. Add the sliced onions, tossing in the olive oil to coat. 
Reduce the heat to medium-high and season the onions with salt, freshly ground 
pepper, and crushed red pepper. Sauté the mixture, stirring often to brown evenly until 
the onions are soft and brown, about 12 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, add the bal-
samic vinegar, and then stir and cook for 3 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and 
set the pan aside, leaving the relish in place.
 3 Divide the ground chuck or sirloin into 4 equal parts, and then shape the meat into 
round patties that are 4 inches across and of even thickness in the center and the sides. 
Lightly brush the peanut oil on both sides of the patties. Generously season both sides 
of each patty to taste with salt and freshly ground pepper.
 4 Place the hamburger patties on an oiled grill and grill for 3 to 4 minutes until nicely 
browned. With a spatula, turn the patties and grill for another 2 minutes. Then place 
one slice of Gorgonzola cheese on each patty, put the cover on the grill, and grill the 
patties for another 1 to 2 minutes to melt the cheese.
 5 Place the pan of relish back on the heat and warm for 1 minute.
 6 Place the hamburger patties on the buns and divide the onion relish among the 4 ham-
burgers. Serve immediately.
Remember: The USDA recommends cooking all ground meat to medium or until the center 
is no longer pink.

Lamb Burger
Ground lamb patties can be seasoned simply with a sprinkling of salt and pepper for a 
child’s finicky palate. But why not use favorite spice combinations from world-class cui-
sines to alter the taste of ground lamb?
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1
1⁄4 pounds lean ground lamb
1 tablespoon grated red or yellow onion
2 tablespoons dark raisins, chopped (optional)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or 
cilantro (coriander)
3⁄4 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon paprika
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Pepper to taste
4 pita breads, each about 5 inches in diameter
Chutney (optional)
Chopped tomatoes and cucumbers (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground lamb, onion, raisins (if desired), parsley or 
cilantro, cumin, cinnamon, paprika, and salt and pepper. Mix well (without overmixing). 
Shape the meat into 4 oblong patties, each 3 to 4 inches long and 
3⁄4- to 1-inch thick. 
Wrap the pitas in heavy-duty aluminum foil and set aside.
 3 Place the lamb patties on a lightly oiled grill grid. Cook the patties for 6 to 8 minutes per 
side for medium, or to desired doneness; cut into the center of each patty to check 
doneness. About 3 minutes before the patties finish cooking, place foil-wrapped pitas at 
the edge of the grid; heat until warmed through, turning once.
 4 To serve, place each patty in a bread pocket; allow each diner to top with chutney, 
chopped tomatoes, or cucumbers (if desired) or other condiments of choice.
Remember: The USDA recommends cooking all ground meat to medium or until the center 
is no longer pink.

When grilling burgers (or anything else for that matter), brush the grill grid 
with vegetable oil or nonstick cooking spray to prevent food from sticking to 
the grid. However, to avoid dangerous flare-ups, brush the grid before preheat-
ing the grill or igniting the charcoal.

121
 Chapter 7: Bun-Lovin’ Burgers, Sausages, and Hot Dogs
 
Keep in mind that all grilling temperatures are only estimates. Variables — 
such as the intensity of your grill’s heat, weather conditions, and the thickness 
of the meat — all affect the exact time it takes to cook your burger. To avoid 
overcooking (or undercooking), test the interior color of your burger. Do this 
by making a small incision with a thin knife in the center of the patty 1 or 2 
minutes before you’re done grilling. Or you may use an instant reading ther-
mometer to find out the temperature. At 150 degrees your burger will be 
medium.
The perfect grilled side dish for hamburgers is — hands down — corn on the 
cob. Check out Chapter 16 for all sorts of interesting ways to grill vegetables, 
including corn on the cob. There you’ll also find other side dish ideas.
Topping your burger
Some burger fans insist on eating their burgers with no extras; not even a 
pickle hides under their burger bun. But the rest of us pride ourselves on 
piling on the toppings. In addition to down-home, old-fashioned ketchup, 
here are some of our favorite toppings:
 
✓ Avocado: Slice ripe avocado or mash it into a spread with a little lemon 
juice and Tabasco sauce.
 
✓ Cheese: Try Cheddar, Swiss, Muenster, Gruyère, or fontina — any 
cheese that melts into a thin, velvety layer. Place the slice on the meat a 
minute or two before the burger is ready and cook. Be sure to cover the 
grill after adding cheese. Doing so helps to melt the cheese.
 
✓ Crisp strips of bacon: You can add bacon with or without the lettuce 
and tomato.
 
✓ Fruit chutney: Try adding a generous dollop of tomato, peach, or mango 
chutney. It’s a nice counterpoint to grilled meat. (Flip to Chapter 6 for 
more information on chutney.)
 
✓ Pesto sauce: Buy it or make your own. (Refer to Chapter 15 for a recipe.) 
For a smoky flavor, spread pesto sauce on the buns before toasting them 
on the grill.
 
✓ Pickles: Choose from dill or sweet pickle slices.
 
✓ Raw or grilled onion slices: Yellow onions are great, but so are milder 
red onions.
 
✓ Salsa: Try making your own (see Chapter 6) or use any of the better 
bottled brands, such as Newman’s Own Salsa.
 
✓ Sautéed or grilled mushrooms: Portobello mushrooms, with their meat-
like texture and woodsy taste are terrific sliced, brushed with oil, and 
grilled. Turn to Chapter 16 for a complete recipe.

122
Part III: For the Fanatics of the Classics 
 
✓ Tomato slices: Raw tomato slices are great, but if you want an extra-
special treat, you can brush the slices with your favorite bottled vinai-
grette and heat them on the grill for about 2 minutes per side or until 
they’re very lightly browned.
Vary It! To make some simple sauces for adorning burgers when guests 
come for a patio dinner (or just to treat yourself), jump to Chapter 6, where 
you find recipes for all sorts of spreads and sauces.
Simple Sausages and Fancy Franks
Sausage-making is a food art practiced around the world. Sold fresh 
(uncooked), cooked, smoked, and cured, sausages are made with a variety 
of meats and seasonings and are shaped into links that vary in thickness and 
length. (See Figure 7-1 for a look at various types of sausages.)
 
With few exceptions, sausages are made with a fair amount of fat, but some 
lower-fat varieties are starting to pop up in grocery stores.
Here are just a few of the many varieties of sausage available for grilling:
 
✓ Bockwurst: Usually sold fresh, but you may also find it cooked. 
Bockwurst, which is a German favorite, is made from veal and pork and 
is usually seasoned mildly with parsley and chives.
 
✓ Bratwurst: A German pork or veal sausage, generally sold fresh, but also 
available precooked and smoked. This sausage is moderately spicy and 
seasoned with ginger, nutmeg, coriander, and caraway.
 
✓ Chorizo: A Mexican fresh pork sausage or a Spanish smoked pork sau-
sage. Both varieties tend to be hot and spicy and flavored with garlic, 
chili powder, and other hot spices.
 
✓ Frankfurter: A precooked, smoked sausage, mildly seasoned, and better 
known as a hot dog or frank. Hot dogs or franks can be made from beef, 
pork, turkey, chicken, or veal and are usually packed into a casing. 
Sizes range from the tiny, delicate cocktail frank to the impressive foot-
long. Kosher franks are all-beef and often heavily flavored with garlic. 
According to U.S. law, franks labeled “all-beef” must be made without fill-
ers such as cereals or soybean products.
 
✓ Italian: Fresh pork sausage, which is sold hot (with hot peppers, fennel, 
and garlic) or sweet (minus the hot peppers).
 
✓ Knockwurst (also known as knackwurst): Fully cooked and smoked 
sausage made of beef, pork, and/or veal. Flavored with lots of garlic, this 
German sausage is mild, not spicy.

123
 Chapter 7: Bun-Lovin’ Burgers, Sausages, and Hot Dogs
 
✓ Polish kielbasa: A fully cooked and smoked sausage that’s usually made 
of pork but sometimes also made of veal and beef. Flavorings include 
onion and garlic, so it can be quite spicy.
 
✓ Salami and cervelat: Both of these are uncooked sausages that are safe 
to eat without further cooking because they have been preserved by 
curing. Salami, which includes the popular pepperoni, is air-dried (which 
makes it firm-textured), is usually heavily seasoned with spices and 
garlic, and is great for slicing thinly over a pizza destined for the grill. 
Cervelat sausages, such as mortadella, are preserved by curing, drying, 
and smoking.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Various 
types of 
sausages.
 
 
Even though many sausages are cured and/or cooked, they can’t be held 
indefinitely in warm weather. It’s always best to preserve their flavor and qual-
ity by placing them in the coldest part of your refrigerator — 36 to 40 degrees 
is the ideal temperature range.
 
Freezing sausages isn’t a good idea, because the sausages lose flavor, but if 
you must freeze them, place them in vaporproof plastic bags and then thaw 
them overnight in the refrigerator when you’re ready to eat them. The flavor 
really starts to decline after about 2 months of freezing, so don’t leave them in 
the freezer any longer than that.

Knowing how long to cook ’em
There’s no trick to grilling franks and sausages; the cooking time is basically 
all you need to know. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
 
✓ Uncooked sausage needs to be precooked before grilling to release some 
of the natural fat, which can cause dangerous flare-ups on the grill.
 
 To precook, prick each sausage several times, and then simmer in water 
(flavored, if you wish, with wine, beer, or apple juice) for 5 to 10 minutes 
or until the sausages are fully cooked with no trace of pink in the center. 
Then you can grill over medium heat until the meat is browned and 
crisp on all sides, turning often.
 
✓ Cooked sausages need only a few minutes of grilling to acquire that 
lovely, smoky taste and the bubbly skin that makes them irresistible 
on a summer afternoon. A hot dog will take about 3 minutes; a thicker 
bratwurst about 5.
 
✓ Remember to keep turning sausages — whether they’re precooked or 
fresh — because they can burn quickly. The best method for turning 
sausages is to use a square or rectangular grill basket that holds a dozen 
or more sausages so they can all be turned at once (see Chapter 2 for 
details).
 
✓ Grill frankfurters for about 8 minutes or until browned on all sides, 
turning frequently.
A lesson in hot dog history
No one knows for sure when the first frank-
furter appeared in America, but the best bet 
is that it was first served under that name in 
St. Louis in the 1880s by a German immigrant 
named Antoine Feuchtwanger, whose principal 
contribution was the soft roll.
The fame of the frank really took off in 1901 after 
Harry Magely, director of catering at New York 
City’s Polo Grounds (where the New York Giants 
used to play), exhorted customers to “Get your 
red hots!” and served the frankfurters on a 
heated roll with various condiments.
The term “hot dog” was coined by Hearst 
Newspaper sports cartoonist Tad Dorgan, who 
often caricatured German figures as dachs-
hunds and, as of 1906, as talking sausages.
So widespread was the name “hot dog” that, to 
calm patrons’ fears, Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog 
Stand in Coney Island, Brooklyn, New York, put 
up a sign explaining that its sausages did not 
contain any dog meat.

125
 Chapter 7: Bun-Lovin’ Burgers, Sausages, and Hot Dogs
Loading up on toppings
Good as they are unadorned, frankfurters and sausages are even better with 
a topping or two. Mustard and ketchup are the world’s favorite toppings, 
but for a little more pizzazz, the next time you fire up the grill and slap down 
franks for a crowd, offer an assortment of hot dog toppings — some home-
made and others straight out of a can or bottle.
For example, let your guests pick and choose from among plates of coleslaw, 
baked beans, canned and warmed chili, relishes, pickles, grated Cheddar 
cheese, flavored mustards and chutneys, guacamole, roasted red and green 
peppers, grilled and raw onion slices, sauerkraut, spicy salsas, and barbecue 
sauces. (See Chapter 16 for side dish ideas.)
 
Grilled Kielbasa with 
 
Creamy Mustard Sauce
Make Grilled Kielbasa with Creamy Mustard Sauce when you need dinner on the table in 
just a few minutes or when you’re tailgating in the stadium parking lot of your favorite 
team. (Flip to Chapter 21 for more outdoor barbecue tips.)
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄4 cup sour cream
3 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, drained
Pepper to taste
Tabasco sauce (optional)
1 to 1
1⁄4 pounds fully cooked sausage (such as 
kielbasa or knackwurst)
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Meanwhile, prepare the Creamy Mustard Sauce by combining the sour cream, mustard, 
horseradish, pepper, and Tabasco sauce (if desired) in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate.
 3 Slice the sausages, if necessary, into 4 pieces of equal length. Cover and arrange the 
sausages on a lightly oiled grill grid. Grill, turning 2 or 3 times, until well browned on all 
sides and warmed through, about 10 minutes.
 4 Divide the sausages among 4 individual plates and top each link with a generous dollop 
of Creamy Mustard Sauce.
Go-With: Try serving the kielbasa sandwich-style, between wedges of crusty Italian bread. 
Orange-Ginger Coleslaw (Chapter 16) makes a good side dish.

Grilled Italian Links with 
 
Caraway Sauerkraut
In this recipe, the sausages are parboiled (gently boiled) in beer before grilling. You can 
also cook them in equal parts apple juice and water, or in a fruity white wine, such as 
Riesling.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
8 sweet Italian sausages, cut into 3- to 4-inch 
links (about 1
1⁄2 pounds total)
1 cup beer
1⁄2 cup water
2 14-ounce cans sauerkraut, drained
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
Dijon-style mustard (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill.
 2 Meanwhile, prick each sausage 2 times. Place the sausages in a skillet or sauté pan large 
enough to hold them in one layer. Add the beer and water; cover and bring to a boil 
over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the sausages for about 5 
minutes. Remove the sausages, reserving the liquid in the skillet.
 3 Add the sauerkraut, vinegar, and caraway seeds to the liquid in the skillet; stir to mix 
well. Simmer, uncovered, for about 5 minutes or until nearly all the liquid has evapo-
rated. (The sauerkraut should be moist.) Remove the skillet from the heat, cover to 
keep warm, and set aside.
 4 Place the sausages directly over the heat on an oiled grill grid. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes 
per side or until nicely browned, turning once. Sausage meat is cooked when it’s no 
longer pink in the center. Cut each sausage in the center to determine doneness.
 5 Serve with the Caraway Sauerkraut and Dijon-style mustard (if desired).

Swordplay: Grilling 
Kebabs and Satay
In This Chapter
▶ Getting the lowdown on skewers
▶ Assembling your kebabs
▶ Grilling all varieties of kebabs
▶ Discovering satay
K
ebabs (and their Middle Eastern cousin, satay) 
are some of the simplest and most popular 
foods to grill — you simply thread morsels of pork, 
beef, chicken, or other foods onto a skewer before 
grilling over an open fire. Kebabs and satays are pop-
ular grilled dishes for all of the following reasons:
 
✓ They require limited preparation and grill time.
 
✓ The thin strips of beef, pork, fish, or poultry 
quickly absorb the flavors of a marinade or 
spice rub.
 
✓ You can use cheaper cuts of meat such as top
round, chicken thighs, and lamb shoulder 
because they’re eaten in small bites and don’t 
need to be as tender as, say, a sirloin steak or 
breast of chicken.
 
✓ You can grill a meal that’s almost complete on just one skewer. (In other 
words, no dishes!)
 
✓ The plate presentation can be quite dramatic when assorted colorful 
foods are strung along the same skewer.
 
✓ They’re fun to eat and make especially good party appetizers.
In this chapter, you discover the kinds of skewers that work well with different 
foods and how to prepare different foods that are great as kebabs. I even sug-
gest some side dishes that you can prepare alongside your kebabs and satay.

Ladies and Gentlemen — 
Choose Your Skewers!
Kebabs can’t exist without skewers, so before you can grill a kebab dinner, 
you need to choose your skewers. Skewers come in many forms and sizes, 
from the bamboo (or wooden) skewers used in Southeast Asia to the long, 
swordlike metal skewers that flamed dramatically at restaurants in the 1970s. 
Some skewers are even quite decorative.
 
When buying skewers for your own use, you can choose between metal and 
wood, both of which have advantages and disadvantages. Table 8-1 shows some 
general guidelines that can help you make a decision on which type you need.
Table 8-1 
Comparing Wooden and Metal Skewers
Wooden Skewers
Metal Skewers
Size
Shorter, ranging from 6 to 9 
inches long; best for scal-
lops, chicken morsels
Longer, ranging from 10 to 18 
inches long, so you can pack 
them with food
Shape
Usually like round toothpicks 
but sturdier
Either flat, which makes sliding 
the food off easier, or square, 
which keeps slippery food on 
more firmly; some metal skew-
ers have a sliding block at one 
end to allow you to push the 
food down and off the blade
Price
Often sold and packaged by 
the dozens or hundreds, so 
they’re significantly cheaper
More expensive upfront, but 
you can use them for years
Appearance
Plain, yet functional
Decorative metal skewers can 
look quite dramatic on a platter
Preparation 
for grilling
Must be soaked in water for 
at least 30 minutes before 
using to avoid burning; even 
after you soak the skewers, 
the ends may burn, so be 
careful when you transfer 
them to a plate; wrapping 
the tips in aluminum foil 
makes picking them up 
easier but always use a mitt
No prep before grilling

 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
Mastering the Skill of Grilling Kebabs
Grilling kebabs is so easy. Anyone can do it. If you’re a beginner and need 
some guidance, here are some pointers:
 
✓ Pack pieces of meat tightly on the skewer if you want the meat cooked 
rare or medium-rare. If you want it medium to well, pack the cubes or 
strips more loosely, with a little space between each piece, allowing 
more heat to circulate.
 
✓ Cut the cubes of food into pieces that are uniform in size to ensure that 
they all finish cooking in the same length of time.
 
✓ Turn hot dogs or sausages into simple kebabs by threading them end-to-
end on a skewer. They’re best if cut into 1-inch bite-size pieces.
 
✓ Take care with foods that are either soft or curved, such as cherry toma-
toes and shrimp, because they have a tendency to slip around as the 
skewer is turned. Try piercing these items with two parallel skewers, 
rather than one, to hold them in place (see Figure 8-1). Or use square 
rather than round metal skewers.
 
✓ Splash balsamic vinegar, flavored vinegar, or fresh lemon juice over 
your grilled pork or lamb kebabs for a fat-free flavoring.
 
✓ For great-looking appetizers, cut your ingredients into 1-inch cubes or 
chunks and thread them onto 6-inch skewers.
 
Use caution when turning your kebabs; always wear an insulated mitt 
(described in Chapter 2). The skewer handles get hot enough to sear the tips 
of your fingers.
You can always turn up the heat on your gas or charcoal grill by using the grill 
cover. For example, if the fish and vegetable kebabs don’t seem to be cooking 
fast enough, cover with the grill hood during the final 2 to 3 minutes. If your 
grill doesn’t have a cover, use a large overturned pot or an aluminum drip pan.
Putting Veggies on a Stick: 
The Fun Way to Eat Them
If you’re a parent or you have ever tried feeding vegetables to a child, you know 
that he’s much more likely to eat the healthy food if doing so involves some 
element of fun. Usually childhood fun involves some sort of handiwork — 
emphasis on the hand. For whatever reason, vegetables often seem to hold 
the same allure for adults when presented as part of an interactive meal. 
Enter veggie kebabs, an enticing way to offer and consume this vital part of the 
human diet.

Because they come in all shapes, sizes, and densities, vegetables can be a bit 
tricky to skewer. The firmer vegetables are a cinch and stay put nicely on the 
skewer. Skewer vegetables that aren’t so dense and that are round in shape, 
such as mushrooms or slices of zucchini or yellow squash, laying flat with their 
widest surface exposed to the heat of the grill. Pierce them from edge to edge, 
rather than simply straight through their centers. (See Figure 8-1 for examples.)

Artichoke, Mushroom, and 
 
Cherry Tomato Kebabs
The vegetables in this kebab recipe — cherry tomatoes, bottled artichoke hearts, and 
mushrooms — grill very quickly and make pretty appetizer kebabs when threaded on 
short skewers.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Grilling time: 9 to 10 minutes
Yield: 6 appetizer servings
1 6-ounce jar marinated artichoke hearts
12 medium mushrooms
6 cherry tomatoes
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
Grated peel of 1 lemon
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
Kosher or table salt to taste
Pepper to taste

131
 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
 1 Drain the artichoke hearts, reserving the marinade. Brush the mushrooms clean with a 
damp paper towel; slice off and discard their stems. Remove any stems from the cherry toma-
toes, and then place all the vegetables in a medium mixing bowl or a resealable plastic bag.
 2 In a small mixing bowl, combine the remaining ingredients with the reserved artichoke 
marinade; pour over the vegetables. Cover the bowl or seal the bag, and marinate for 30 
minutes to 1 hour. If you plan to use wooden skewers, soak them in cold water while the 
veggies are marinating to prevent them from burning.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Thread 2 mushrooms and 2 artichoke hearts, alternately, on 6 skewers, leaving room to 
later add a cherry tomato at the top of each skewer. Skewer whole mushrooms length-
wise through the caps so they lie flat on the grill and can brown evenly on both sides. 
Brush the vegetables generously with the marinade.
 5 Place the skewers on a lightly oiled grill grid and grill for about 4 minutes per side, turn-
ing once. Brush with the remaining marinade and thread a cherry tomato through the 
top of each skewer. Grill for 1 to 2 minutes more or until the tomatoes are tender but 
still intact, turning once.
Go-With: Serve these colorful skewers with hamburgers, steak, grilled fish, or lamb.
Vary It! Add extra-large or jumbo shrimp or 1-inch cubes of green pepper to the marinade 
with the vegetables. Grill as described but use longer skewers. For a complete meal, 
remove grilled vegetables from kebabs and toss with steaming pasta, extra-virgin olive oil, 
chopped fresh parsley, and grated Parmesan cheese. If you don’t have time to make the 
marinade, use your favorite bottled vinaigrette or Italian dressing instead.

Kebabing for Beef
Most agree that the best beef kebabs are made from tender cuts, such as 
sirloin, top loin, and tenderloin. However, less expensive beef cuts like top 
round, chuck, or flank steak also work if you marinate the meat before grill-
ing. (Flip to Chapter 11 for more information on the many beef cuts you can 
grill. For marinades, oils, and rubs, flip to Chapter 5.)
 
Nothing is worse than a charred, dried-out kebab, so timing is critical with 
beef kebabs. You can honor individual preferences for doneness by cooking 
kebabs for different lengths of time to get them well-done, medium, or rare. 
A 1-inch beef cube grills to medium in about 10 minutes over a medium fire. 
Always check the meat for doneness a few minutes before the end of the esti-
mated cooking time by making a small cut with a sharp knife into the center of 
a few of the kebab cubes.

Preparing a complete meal with the entree and side dishes all cooked on one 
grill can be tricky when the cooking times and temperatures differ. On a gas 
grill, you can adjust the burners, raising or lowering the heat, much as you do 
on your kitchen range. You don’t have this luxury with a charcoal grill, but 
you can use the edges of the grid for warming and moderate cooking, and the 
center for foods that need intense heat. Another option is to use your kitchen 
broiler to grill side dishes. Broiling doesn’t produce those wonderful smoky 
flavors of the grill, but it can help you get the whole meal on the table at once.
 
Western Beef Kebabs with 
 
Red Peppers and Onions
In this recipe, you save the marinade that soaks the raw food and boil it to make a deli-
cious finishing sauce for the grilled food. This particular marinade combines many 
ingredients common to American Southwestern cooking — lime juice, grated lime peel, 
garlic, jalapeño peppers, and ground cumin. A touch of butter is added, just as the 
sauce is reheated, to blend together the various flavors.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1
1⁄2 to 2 pounds sirloin or other tender beef 
such as top loin or round tip steak
2 medium red peppers
1 medium onion
1⁄2 cup apple juice, divided
6 tablespoons lime juice (from about 3 large 
limes)
1
1⁄2 teaspoons grated lime peel
6 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
1 to 2 large jalapeño peppers, seeded and 
chopped
3⁄4 teaspoon cumin
1
1⁄2 teaspoons chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons butter
 1 Working on a cutting board, trim all visible fat from the beef; cut the meat into cubes of 
about 1
1⁄2 inches. Place the cubes in a large, resealable plastic bag or in a nonreactive 
container.

133
 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
 2 On a separate cutting board, core and seed the red peppers and slice them into strips 
about 1
1⁄2 inches wide; slice each strip crosswise into 1- to 2-inch pieces. Cut the onion 
in half lengthwise and remove the skin. Cut each half into thirds; break them apart into 
slices. Place the peppers and onions in the bag or container with the beef cubes.
 3 Combine 6 tablespoons of the apple juice with the lime juice, grated lime peel, oil, 
garlic, jalapeño peppers, cumin, chili powder, and paprika in a blender container; at 
high speed, blend the mixture for a few seconds into a coarse puree. Pour the resulting 
marinade over the beef and vegetables; seal the bag or cover the container, and refrig-
erate for at least 6 hours or overnight, turning occasionally. Be sure to soak your 
wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from 
burning.
 4 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill. (Sprinkle coals with a handful of 
presoaked hickory or mesquite wood chips, if desired.)
 5 Remove the beef from the marinade. Reserve any remaining marinade and place it in a 
small saucepan. Thread 3 to 4 beef cubes, alternating with pieces of pepper and onion, 
on soaked skewers. Sprinkle kebabs with salt and pepper.
 6 Place the skewers on a well-oiled grill grid; grill the kebabs for about 10 minutes for 
medium-rare or about 12 minutes for medium, turning every 5 to 6 minutes.
 7 As the kebabs grill, bring the leftover marinade in the saucepan to a boil for about 1 
minute on top of the stove; reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Whisk in 2 table-
spoons butter and 2 tablespoons of the remaining apple juice. Spoon the sauce over the 
grilled kebabs just before serving.

For best results, follow the marinating times suggested in recipes. But when 
you’re in a hurry, marinate for as much time as you have. The flavor may not 
be as intense, but the dish should still taste fine.

Teriyaki Steak Kebabs
Grilling succulent oranges (and other citrus fruits) releases the intensely rich and 
flavorful oils locked in the peel of the fruit. In this recipe, oranges are threaded onto 
skewers with teriyaki-marinated red onions, peppers, and beef.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄2 cup teriyaki sauce
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon peeled and freshly grated ginger
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1
1⁄2 to 2 pounds well-trimmed beef top round 
steak, cut into 1
1⁄2-inch cubes
2 medium seedless oranges, quartered
2 medium red onions, each cut into 6 pieces
2 large green bell peppers, seeded and cut 
into 2-inch chunks
 1 In a large bowl or resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Add the beef 
and toss (or shake the bag) to mix. Cover the bowl or seal the bag, pressing out any air; 
refrigerate the meat for 6 hours or overnight, turning it several times. Drain off and 
reserve the remaining marinade. Before grilling, bring marinade to a boil for 1 minute, 
and then simmer for 15 minutes.
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Be sure to soak your wooden skewers 
in water for at least 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from burning.
 3 As the grill preheats, alternate pieces of beef, orange, onion, and green pepper on 
soaked skewers, beginning and ending with the beef. Brush the meat and vegetables 
with the reserved marinade.
 4 Place the kebabs on a well-oiled grill grid. Brush the kebabs once with the remaining 
marinade during the first 5 minutes of grilling. Grill 12 minutes for medium-rare and 14 
minutes for medium, turning about every 5 minutes to prevent charring.

 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
Porky Pig on a Stick
Pork kebabs can be cut from almost any part of the pig, including leg, loin, or 
shoulder, but the best meat for kebabs comes from the tenderloin and bone-
less loin. The meat should be cut into 1-inch-thick cubes and then marinated 
before cooking over direct heat. Grill for 10 to 12 minutes total, turning and 
basting the kebabs frequently to keep them from drying out. The best way to 
check for preferred doneness is to take one of the kebabs off the skewer and 
cut into it. For more on cooking times for pork, flip to Chapter 12.
 
If you apply a basting marinade to kebabs that has come into contact with 
raw meat, be sure to grill the kebabs for at least 5 to 7 minutes after the 
application — doing so destroys any bacteria from the raw pork, which may 
have contaminated the marinade.

Apple and Tarragon Pork Kebabs
The flavor of pork works well with virtually any kind of vegetable and a range of 
succulent, sweet fruits. In this recipe, apples and apple juice team up with white wine 
and tarragon to flavor grilled pork kebabs.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 to 24 hours
Grilling time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1⁄4 cup apple juice
1⁄4 cup dry white wine
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon, or 2 
teaspoons dried tarragon
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
Salt and pepper to taste
1
1⁄4 to 1
1⁄2 pounds lean boneless pork loin, cut 
into 1-inch cubes
2 Granny Smith or Golden Delicious apples, 
peeled, cored, and cut into 1
1⁄2-inch cubes
 1 Combine all ingredients except the pork and apples in a shallow, nonreactive dish or 
large, resealable plastic bag.
 2 Add the pork, turning to coat in the marinade. Cover the dish or seal the bag, pressing 
out any air; refrigerate for at least 4 hours, but not more than 24 hours, turning occa-
sionally. Be sure to soak your wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes before 
grilling to prevent them from burning.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the pork cubes from the marinade, reserving any remaining marinade.
 5 Arrange the pork and apple cubes on the skewers.
 6 Place the skewers on a lightly oiled grill grid. Grill the kebabs 6 to 7 minutes, turning 
and basting them frequently with the reserved marinade. Continue to grill for about 6 
to 7 minutes, turning frequently, without basting, until the pork is well browned on all 
sides and cooked through.

Pork Kebabs with 
 
Nectarines and Red Onions
Here’s a kebab dish that adds both sweetness and a little pungent bite from onions to 
pork, which is the best meat for any sweet flavorings. Lamb would be fine, too, but we 
wouldn’t serve this with beef. You can see these colorful kebabs in the color photo sec-
tion of this book.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours to overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1
1⁄2 teaspoons ground fennel
1
1⁄2 teaspoons ground cumin
3 cloves garlic, minced
Juice of 1
1⁄2 limes
1
1⁄2 teaspoons fresh, coarsely ground black 
peppercorns
1 teaspoons salt
4 tablespoons corn or peanut oil
2 pounds pork loin, cut into 1
1⁄2- to 2-inch 
pieces
3 nectarines, not overly ripe, pitted and each 
cut into 4 sections
2 medium-sized red onions, peeled and each 
cut into 6 sections (each should retain part of 
its root to hold the pieces together)
Oil for brushing vegetables
 1 In a medium nonreactive mixing bowl or a large, resealable plastic bag, combine the 
fennel, cumin, garlic, lime juice, black pepper, salt, and corn or peanut oil; add the pork 
pieces, tossing to coat in the marinade. Cover the bowl or seal the bag, pressing out all 
the air and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight. Be sure to soak your wooden skewers in 
water for at least 30 minutes before grilling to prevent them from burning.
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Remove the pork from the marinade, discarding any leftover. Thread the pork, nectar-
ines, and red onions alternately on skewers. Brush the nectarines and red onions with 
oil. Season the meat, nectarines, and red onions with salt. You may want to cook the 
onions on a separate skewer if you like them softer and more charred, but they will be 
nice and crisp if cooked with the pork kebabs.
 4 Place the kebobs on a lightly oiled grill grid. Grill for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn and cook for 
another 5 to 6 minutes. Cut a piece of meat to test for doneness. Pork can be slightly 
pink in the center when done. Don’t overcook; pork becomes very dry. Transfer the 
kebabs to a serving platter and serve.

Lamb Kebabs — the Real Deal
Kebabs originated in the Middle East, where lamb is virtually a staple. The 
most authentic (and some say, the most tasty) kebabs you can grill up are 
made with fresh lamb. Lamb kebab cubes grill quickly, in only about 10 min-
utes. Be sure to hover over the kebabs, checking often for doneness, because 
they easily overcook and lose their juicy tenderness.
 
Lamb and Eggplant Kebabs with 
 
Tarragon Marinade
As much as lamb is complemented by the sharp tartness of lemon, as in the pre-ceding 
recipe, it also partners well with sweet ingredients like chutneys, jam glazes, honey, and 
fruit juices. In this recipe, honey, apple juice, and tarragon are combined to infuse lamb 
and vegetables with a tinge of sweetness. This marinade is especially tasty with eggplant 
and summer squash, but we encourage you to use it on any number of other vegetable 
kebabs.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Marinating time: 8 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1 cup apple juice
1⁄3 cup cider vinegar
1⁄3 cup olive oil
1⁄3 cup chopped scallions (green and white 
parts)
3 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons A-1 steak sauce (or your 
favorite brand)
1
1⁄2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon, or 1
1⁄2 
teaspoons dried tarragon
1 clove garlic, peeled and halved
3⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄4 teaspoon pepper
1
1⁄2 to 2 pounds lean boneless lamb, cut into 
1
1⁄4-inch cubes
1⁄4 cup olive oil (for vegetable marinade)
1 small eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into 
1-inch pieces
2 small yellow squash, cut into 
1⁄2-inch rounds

 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
 1 In a medium saucepan, combine the apple juice, vinegar, 
1⁄3 cup olive oil, scallions, 
honey, steak sauce, tarragon, garlic, and salt and pepper; simmer the mixture for 10 
minutes over low heat, uncovered. Cool to room temperature.
 2 Place the lamb in a large, resealable plastic bag or a nonreactive mixing bowl; pour 1
1⁄4 
cups of the marinade over the lamb, reserving the remaining 
1⁄4 cup of marinade. Cover 
the remaining marinade and refrigerate until ready to marinate the vegetables. Seal the 
bag, pressing out any air, or cover the bowl; refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight, turning 
the meat occasionally.
 3 About 1 hour before you’re ready to grill, combine the reserved marinade with the 
1⁄4 
cup olive oil. Place the vegetables in a large, resealable plastic bag or nonreactive bowl; 
pour the marinade-oil mixture over the vegetables, tossing to coat. Seal the bag or 
cover the bowl, and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour, turning occasionally. Be 
sure to soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.
 4 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 5 Remove the lamb and vegetables from their marinades, reserving the lamb marinade. 
Thread lamb, eggplant, and squash pieces alternately onto long skewers. Thread the 
pieces of squash and eggplant so they lie flat on the grill. Brush kebabs generously with 
the reserved lamb marinade and (if desired) sprinkle with additional salt and pepper.
 6 Place the skewers on a well-oiled grill grid. Grill for 5 to 7 minutes; brush with marinade, 
and turn. Grill for about 5 to 7 minutes more for medium-rare or until the lamb is 
browned on the outside but pink and juicy inside; the vegetables should be lightly 
browned and crisp-tender. Cut into a kebab to test for doneness.

Lemony Fresh Lamb Kebabs
These lamb kebabs come to life with the flavors of fresh lemon juice, grated lemon peel, 
minced garlic, and fresh rosemary. They make terrific party appetizers.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
6 tablespoons olive oil
Grated peel of 1 large lemon (about 2 
teaspoons)
Juice of 1 large lemon (about 3 tablespoons)
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary, 
or 1 teaspoon dried, crushed rosemary
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Pepper to taste
2 pounds lamb (from the leg), cut into 1- to 
1
1⁄4-inch cubes
8 to 10 long sprigs fresh rosemary (optional)
Oil for brushing rosemary sprigs
Lemon wedges for garnish
 1 In a medium nonreactive mixing bowl or large, resealable plastic bag, combine the olive 
oil, lemon peel, lemon juice, rosemary, garlic, and salt and pepper; add the lamb cubes, 
tossing to coat in the marinade. Cover the bowl or seal the bag, pressing out any air. 
Refrigerate for 6 hours or overnight. Be sure to soak wooden skewers in water for 30 
minutes to prevent them from burning.
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Remove the lamb from the marinade, reserving any remaining marinade. Thread the 
lamb on skewers. Brush the lamb with the reserved marinade.
 4 If using rosemary sprigs, brush them generously with oil. Place the sprigs on a lightly 
oiled grill grid. Set the lamb kebabs on the rosemary sprigs (or directly on the oiled 
grid, if you’re not using the rosemary). Grill the kebabs for about 5 minutes; brush them 
with more marinade and turn. Grill for about 5 minutes more for medium-rare. Cut the 
meat to test doneness. The lamb should be pink to rosy in the center of each kebab 
when done. Transfer immediately to a serving platter and garnish with lemon wedges.

Threading pieces of food tightly together on skewers increases the overall 
cooking time. Leave a little space between each piece of food to allow the heat 
to surround and cook the food evenly and more quickly.
Chicken Flying Full Mast, Half-Mast, 
All Over the Mast
Tender, plump, boneless chicken breasts are easily cut up into thin strips, 
chunks, or cubes for threading on skewers. Chicken’s mild flavor makes it 
suitable for any number of sweet or spicy marinades, barbecue sauces, or 
rubs. Chicken kebabs, depending on their thickness, cook very quickly — 
usually in about 10 minutes. Chicken wings or legs may take twice as long. A 
decent-sized chicken kebab should be about 2 inches by 2 inches.
Use soy sauce, ginger, and crushed red pepper together in a marinade; or try 
garlic, lemon, olive oil, and fresh rosemary. Or you can simply squeeze a little 
lemon or lime juice over the chicken chunks or strips and then sprinkle them 
with a commercial jerk seasoning before grilling. Chicken kebabs are great 
with many of the side dishes in this book (see Chapter 16) as well as just a 
nice bowl of white, brown, or Chinese rice.

Chicken Tikka
In this Indian recipe, you marinate cubes of chicken in yogurt along with spices 
common to Indian curries — turmeric, cumin, and cayenne pepper. The turmeric gives 
these kebabs a yellow glow.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1⁄2 cup plain yogurt
1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
3⁄4 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄2 teaspoon turmeric
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Black pepper to taste
15 to 20 cherry tomatoes
 1 Rinse the chicken breasts under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels; trim 
any loose fat and cut into 1
1⁄4-inch cubes. Place the chicken in a large, resealable plastic 
bag or a medium nonreactive mixing bowl.
 2 In a blender container, combine the remaining ingredients, except the cherry tomatoes; 
puree the mixture until smooth. Pour the marinade over the chicken in the bag or bowl; 
toss to coat well. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, or cover the bowl, and refrigerate 
for at least 6 hours or overnight. Be sure to soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes 
to prevent them from burning.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 As the grill preheats, remove the chicken from the marinade, discarding the remaining 
marinade, and thread on skewers, 3 to 4 pieces to a skewer.
 5 Place the skewers on a well-oiled grill grid; grill the kebabs for 5 to 6 minutes per side or 
until done and nicely browned, turning once. Using a barbecue mitt to protect your hands 
from the heat, place a cherry tomato on the top of each skewer after grilling for 5 minutes.
Go-With: Serve on a bed of white rice and boiled peas; complete the meal with the Yogurt 
Cucumber Salad in Chapter 16 or with Summer Squash or Tomato Chutney (Chapter 6).
Vary It! The yogurt-flavored marinade can also be used with about 2 pounds of skewered 
beef or lamb cubes or with extra-large shrimp.

Gone Fishin’ and Sea Divin’ 
(For Kebabs)
What seafood is best for kebabs? Any firm-fleshed fish or shellfish that you 
can easily cut into 1-inch-thick chunks. Some examples include large sea 
scallops, monkfish, halibut, tuna, salmon, swordfish, and, of course, large to 
jumbo-sized shrimp.
 
“Large” and “jumbo” aren’t legal terms, so the number of shrimp you receive 
can vary. Actual shrimp count is determined by the number of shrimp in a 
pound according to the size of the shrimp. So “20 count” means 20 shrimp to 
the pound. The smaller the number, the larger the shrimp. Shrimp are sold 
fresh and whole, frozen with their shell, or frozen and shelled. You can skewer 
any of them through the fleshy part of the tail at its two ends (refer to Figure 
8-1, earlier in this chapter, to see how).

Turn and brush fish kebabs frequently with a basting sauce, marinade, or 
herb butter to keep them from drying out during grilling. One-inch pieces of 
fish take 6 to 8 minutes to cook through. Shrimp are done as soon as the body 
meat loses its translucence. Any further cooking will result in tough shrimp.
You may find it necessary to parboil (boiling a few minutes to soften) tougher 
vegetables and fruits before skewering them with tender, quick-cooking fish.

Mixed Grill Seafood Kebabs with 
 
Fresh Lemon Sauce
These mixed seafood kebabs are doused twice with the lively flavor of fresh lemons — 
one time in the marinade and again in the finishing sauce. You can also use limes or 
oranges if you prefer. The citric acid in such fruits really makes the flavor come alive.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 6 to 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Grated peel of 1 lemon
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (about 1 large 
lemon)
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley, or 1 
teaspoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs, such as 
oregano, thyme, rosemary, basil, or dill, or 1 
teaspoon dried herbs
2 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard
Salt and white pepper to taste
1⁄2 cup virgin olive oil
 
 In a jar with a tight-fitting lid, combine all the ingredients except the olive oil; seal the 
jar and shake until the ingredients are well blended. Add the olive oil, about 
1⁄4 cup at a 
time, tightly sealing the jar and shaking after each addition.
Mixed Grill Seafood Kebabs

 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Be sure to soak wooden skewers in 
water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.
 2 Arrange the seafood, red pepper, and red onion on 8 metal or wooden skewers, alternat-
ing different pieces of fish with the vegetables.
 3 Pour half (about 
1⁄3 cup) of the Fresh Lemon Sauce into a small bowl; baste the skewered 
fish and vegetables with the sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce to drizzle over grilled 
kebabs.
 4 Just before grilling the kebabs, brush the herb sprigs with oil and place them directly 
on a well-oiled grill grid.
 5 Place the kebabs on the herbs, one to a sprig. Grill, basting and turning the kebabs 
every 2 to 3 minutes, for a total of 6 to 8 minutes or until the fish is opaque. (Don’t baste 
during the last 3 minutes of cooking.) Cut the shellfish with a thin-bladed knife to check 
for doneness; the shellfish should be firm and opaque but still moist throughout.
 6 Remove the kebabs from the grill and place on a large serving platter; drizzle with the 
reserved lemon sauce. Serve over steaming white rice (if desired).

Sweet-and-Sour Shrimp 
 
Kebabs with Scallions
These skewered extra-large or jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound) are brushed with a 
sweet-and-sour glaze. To add a little contrasting color and crunch, wrap a long green 
scallion around and through each skewered shrimp. Or cut the scallions into 2-inch 
pieces and alternate them on the skewers with the shrimp.
Remember that tender-fleshed shrimp, like other seafood, quickly absorb smoky 
flavors from wood chunks and chips. Build your charcoal fire by using a few hardwood 
chunks — pecan, apple, and mesquite are all good with fish — or toss a handful of 
presoaked chips onto the fire or into a smoker box before grilling.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Grilling time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
26 to 28 extra-large shrimp, shelled and 
deveined (about 1
1⁄2 pounds)
6 tablespoons soy sauce
3 tablespoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon peeled and coarsely chopped 
fresh ginger
1 to 2 teaspoons seeded, minced fresh hot 
chile pepper, such as jalapeño or habañero
8 scallions, trimmed (optional)
 1 Rinse and drain the shrimp under cold running water.
 2 In a medium nonreactive mixing bowl or a large, resealable plastic bag, make the mari-
nade by combining the remaining ingredients, except the scallions; add the shrimp to 
the marinade, tossing them to coat well. Cover the bowl or seal the bag, pressing out 
any air; refrigerate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour. Be sure to soak wooden skewers in 
water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Arrange the shrimp, 3 to 4 to a skewer, on 8 skewers. Pierce a scallion through its white 
bulb with the tip of a skewer (if desired), and then thread the long green part through 
and around the shrimp to hold in place. Repeat with remaining scallions and skewers. 
Brush the scallions and shrimp generously with the marinade, dabbing on bits and 
pieces of the chopped ginger and chilies.

147
 Chapter 8: Swordplay: Grilling Kebabs and Satay
 5 Grill the kebabs on a lightly oiled grill grid about 3 minutes per side or until the shrimp 
are opaque and pink, brushing with the marinade once before turning.

Allowing fish to marinate longer than an hour, particularly when the mixture 
contains an acid like lemon juice or vinegar, can cause the fish flesh to begin 
to toughen. One way to strengthen the flavors of the marinade without risking 
this undesirable firming is to chill the marinade in the refrigerator a few hours 
before adding the fish. When the fish is finally added, the marinade flavors are 
at their peak.
Please Satay for Dinner
If you travel throughout Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, you can see ven-
dors grilling all kinds of satay (pronounced sah-TAY) along the roadside on 
small portable hibachis. Satay is sort of a kebab, except that the meat (beef, 
lamb, or pork) or poultry is cut into thin strips, about 
1⁄2-inch thick, instead 
of cubes or chunks. The skewers are inserted like a needle, and the strips 
are threaded from one end to the other in a kind of ripple. After grilling, the 
strips are served with a thick and scrumptious peanut sauce.
 
In Asia, cooks usually use wooden skewers, but you can purchase pretty metal 
skewers with Asian designs on the handles in Asian stores or kitchenware 
stores.
Whether made with pork, beef, lamb, or chicken, satay-like dishes make great 
party appetizers. You can also serve a pile of them on a big platter as a hefty 
main dish and accompanied by spicy side dishes.

Satay with Peanut Dipping Sauce
We use chicken as the meat of choice for this satay recipe, but you can easily substitute 
other meats such as pork or beef with very good results.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 8 minutes
Yield: 4 main servings, or 8 to 10 appetizer servings
2 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts 
(about 2
1⁄2 pounds)
1⁄3 cup olive oil
1⁄4 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons grated lime peel
2 tablespoons fresh cilantro (coriander), 
chopped with stems
2 small scallions, trimmed and chopped
1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
 1 Lay one chicken breast on a cutting board or other flat surface between 2 pieces of 
waxed paper. Using a meat mallet (a rolling pin or the bottom of a heavy skillet also 
works), pound the breast to flatten slightly; cut across the grain into 1-inch-thick strips. 
Repeat this step with the second breast. Place the strips in a large, resealable plastic 
bag or a nonreactive mixing bowl.
 2 In a small mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, make the marinade by combining the 
remaining ingredients; pour the marinade over the chicken strips. Seal the bag, pressing 
out any air, or cover the bowl; marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or over-
night. Be sure to soak wooden skewers in water for 30 minutes to prevent them from 
burning.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chicken from the marinade and thread on bamboo or metal skewers. 
Discard the remaining marinade.
 5 Place the skewers on a well-oiled grill grid. Grill for about 4 minutes on each side or 
until done to your preference. Serve with Peanut Dipping Sauce (see following recipe).

 1 In a medium skillet or sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat; add the garlic and 
ginger and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring, until the garlic is softened. (Be careful not 
to let the garlic brown.)
 2 Add the coconut milk, peanut butter, soy sauce, lime juice, rice vinegar, and Tabasco 
sauce to the pan. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and 
simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer the sauce to a small bowl and sprinkle it with cilan-
tro. Serve with grilled chicken strips as a dipping sauce.

Ribs Worth Drooling Over
In This Chapter
▶ Shopping for various cuts of pork ribs
▶ Grilling pork ribs to perfection with rubs and sauces
▶ Barbecuing beef ribs according to the cut
I
n this chapter, we take a bit of a breather from 
grilling, which is loosely defined as cooking 
relatively tender foods quickly and directly over 
intense heat. Here, however, we venture into the 
barbecuing realm. Even though grilling is the 
complete opposite of barbecuing — the cooking 
of relatively tough foods, long and slow, with lots 
of smoke — sometimes these cooking methods 
overlap. A person with good grilling skills can bar-
becue without building a smoke pit in the backyard; the old, reliable charcoal 
kettle grill will do just fine. In this chapter, we give you the techniques that 
enable you to barbecue ribs like a Kansas City pitmaster.
If ever a single food item seems perfectly matched to a covered charcoal grill, 
it’s ribs. Barbecued ribs are very much a passion for the grilling chef, and 
succulent, tender, finger-lickin’ ribs aren’t all that difficult to achieve. We find 
that most die-hard barbecuers call for pork and not beef ribs. The last recipe 
in this chapter, however, is a beef rib recipe that really takes us back to the 
grilling method. With that recipe, you discover how to cook very tender, 
thinly cut Korean-style beef ribs directly over the heat of the grill in about 10 
minutes.

Back, Spare, and Country-Style: 
Recognizing Pork Rib Varieties
 
Pork rib cuts can be a source of confusion if you aren’t familiar with them. 
Three cuts are available at your grocery store, so you should get to know the 
distinctive characteristics of each type of rib before tossing them on the grill. 
Here are the varieties you should know:
 
✓ Back ribs: Also called baby back ribs, back ribs are cut from the blade 
and center section of the loin chops, close to the spine, and include the 
finger meat between the ribs. This cut is very meaty and tender, and it’s 
small enough to almost qualify as dainty finger food. Plan on a pound of 
back ribs per person. A slab (or rack) of these ribs weighs about 1
1⁄2 to 2 
pounds and will take about 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours to cook indirectly on the grill.
 
✓ Spareribs: These ribs, which are the most popular pork rib choice, come 
from the underside or belly of the pig, next to the bacon. Even though 
they’re the least meaty portion of the pig, spareribs are packed with 
tremendous flavor. A full slab (or rack) can weigh from 3 to 5 pounds — 
plan on a pound of ribs per serving. Set the heat on your grill at medium 
to medium-low and cook the ribs from 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours. Use a covered grill, 
turn the ribs once, and brush them with sauce during the last 15 minutes 
of cooking (if desired).
 
✓ Country-style ribs: These ribs are cut from the shoulder or the blade 
end of the loin and have the most amount of meat in proportion to 
bone. They come from the top of the backbone instead of the rib cage. 
Because they’re loaded with meat, you may want to braise them in a 
small amount of water on top of the stove until very tender before grill-
ing them. One pound of country-style ribs serves 3 to 4 people.
The Many Ways to Grill Pork Ribs
Depending on whom you ask, you’ll find a conglomeration of assorted tech-
niques, methods, and preferences for cooking pork ribs. Some like the meat 
falling off the bone and smothered in barbecue sauce. Others like their ribs a 
little bit chewy and crispy, with just a hint of sauce and a lot of hickory wood 
flavoring.
Today, rib rubs often replace sweet, tomato-based barbecue sauces that have 
for so long been a traditional part of southern U.S. barbecue. Dry spice rubs 
add flavor without completely masking the natural taste of the pork, which 
overly rich sauces can do if applied throughout the cooking process.

153
 Chapter 9: Maybe Messy, Definitely Delicious: Ribs Worth Drooling Over
 
Rubs, which can be mixed from any number of spices or herbs probably 
already on hand in your kitchen, are usually free of the unwanted calories 
from oils and other fats that are often loaded into rich barbecue or finishing 
sauces. Flip to Chapter 5 for more recipes and information on how to prepare 
and apply rubs.
In terms of technique, we’ve talked with some cooks who strongly believe in 
degreasing — eliminating excess fat from pork ribs by first roasting them in 
the oven or parboiling them on the stove before finishing on the grill. Other 
cooks recommend foil-wrapping the ribs before cooking them over direct 
heat in a covered grill. The foil is removed when the ribs are tender, and then 
the basting sauce is applied just a few minutes before they’re fully grilled.
Both of these methods produce a pork rib with meat that’s moist and tender. 
And generally, both methods cook the ribs in less time than it takes to grill 
them. But by not cooking pork ribs on the grill from beginning to end, we 
think that you lose much of that rich, slow-cooked barbecue flavor that only 
grilling indirectly and slowly over hot coals can produce. If you want to try 
out this long, slow, indirect grilling technique for pork ribs, check out the 
recipe for our Just-Right Pork Ribs later in the chapter.
 
The following steps sum up the process for successfully barbecuing your 
slabs of pork ribs:
 
1. Build an indirect fire by piling the coals on one side of the grill.
 
 This is our preferred method because it gives you plenty of room to 
place the large rib slabs away from the heat of the fire. However, you 
also can stack the charcoal in a circular ring around the edges of the 
grill. (Turn to Chapter 1 for complete instructions.) You can cook the 
ribs indirectly in a gas grill, but a charcoal fire gives them more flavor.
 
2. Cook the ribs slowly for 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours over medium heat (325 degrees 
to 350 degrees) and over a drip pan half filled with water.
 
 Long, slow cooking makes for moist and tender ribs with a crisp crust. 
The drip pan of water helps so that the fat falls into the water rather 
than splattering onto the coals or grill. If your ribs brown too quickly 
within the first 30 minutes, shut the grill vents.
 
 You can toss in a large handful of presoaked wood chips each time you 
add fresh coals to the fire. Or build the fire using a combination of char-
coal and hardwood oak or hickory chunks to achieve extra smoky flavor. 
(Refer to Chapter 3 for more on using wood during grilling.)
 
3. If desired, add a sauce to your ribs.
 
 Add any basting sauce that has a component of tomato or other sweet 
ingredient to the ribs during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Adding the 
sauce late in the process prevents the sauce from burning.

4. Keep an eye on the ribs and take them off the heat when they’re fully 
cooked.
 
 Determining when pork ribs are done is a little tricky, but after 1
1⁄2 to 2 
hours, you can be virtually certain that the ribs are fully cooked. Keep in 
mind that the meat’s color isn’t an indication of doneness. Smoke from 
the coals or from burning wood chips can turn the interior of the meat 
pink and leave you with the impression that it isn’t cooked. If you can 
move the rib bones back and forth without a lot of resistance after 1
1⁄2 to 
2 hours, the meat is cooked.

When grilling your ribs, remember that some spots on the grill will be hotter 
than others. You can move rib slabs to hotter or cooler spots to speed up or 
slow down cooking.
Regional ribs
Not everyone in the U.S. agrees on the best 
way to cook ribs. Here are some regional 
differences:
 ✓ People in the South overwhelmingly prefer 
pork to any other meat for ribs.
 ✓ You can find tomatoey barbecue in parts of 
western North Carolina, where the folks call 
it Lexington-style barbecue, after Lexington, 
North Carolina. Very often, barbecue in this 
part of the world is chopped pork taken 
from the bone or pork shoulder, but ribs are 
very popular too.
 ✓ Eastern North Carolinians prefer vinegar-
based rib sauces with chile pepper flakes 
and spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, oregano, 
and paprika.
 ✓ Kansas City, Missouri, rib sauces are famous 
for their thick, ketchupy consistency.
 ✓ In Louisiana, Cajun spices — cayenne 
pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, 
Tabasco sauce, and thyme — often reign 
in rib rubs and sauces.
 ✓ In the Pacific Rim states — California, 
Washington, Oregon, and Hawaii — rib 
sauces can have a distinct sweetness, 
usually from fruits like pineapple.
 ✓ Ironically, a Midwestern state — Ohio — 
hosts the annual National Rib Cook-Off in 
Cincinnati, serving up 350,000 pounds of 
ribs during one weekend.
 ✓ Memphis, 
Tennessee, 
hosts 
the 
International Barbecue Cooking Contest; 
the rules state that “any nonpoisonous 
substances” may be used in the sauces. 
However, vinegar must be one of those 
substances.

 Chapter 9: Maybe Messy, Definitely Delicious: Ribs Worth Drooling Over
 
Just-Right Pork Ribs
To make our pork ribs, we combine three recipes — a spice rub, a basting sauce, and a 
barbecue sauce. Apply the Gingery Spice Rub — a mixture of ginger, brown sugar, 
lemon peel, and salt and pepper — to the slab of raw ribs and allow it to stand for about 
30 minutes (or about as long as it takes to build an indirect fire in a charcoal grill). After 
you place the ribs on the grill, brush them about every 20 minutes with the Apple-Beef 
Basting Sauce to keep them fully moist. Finally, 15 to 20 minutes before they’re removed 
from the grill, you brush them again, but this time you use a rich and delicious Country-
Style Barbecue Sauce. This sauce gives the ribs a glossy finish and also doubles as a 
dipping sauce.
Step 1: Mixin’ the Gingery Spice Rub and Rubbin’ the Ribs
You can prepare the Gingery Spice Rub up to a week ahead of time, using all the ingredi-
ents except the grated fresh lemon peel. You hold off on adding this ingredient because 
you want to retain the fragrant oil in the peel. Add the grated peel just before smearing 
the rub onto the ribs. If you have any leftover rub, store it in an air-tight container and 
use within a few days on other pork cuts, grilled fish, or chicken.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Enough rub for 3 to 4 pounds of pork ribs
1 tablespoon brown sugar
2 teaspoons ground ginger
2 teaspoons salt
1 to 2 teaspoons pepper, according to taste
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel (optional)
 1 Combine all the ingredients in a small, clean jar or container with a tight-fitting lid. Seal 
the jar and shake until well mixed.
 2 Set the ribs on a flat cookie sheet, and then trim off any loose or large pieces of fat. Cut 
the slabs into pieces that are 8 to 10 inches wide. (Doing so makes it easier to turn the 
ribs as they grill.)
 3 Sprinkle the ribs with the rub, pressing the seasoning firmly into the meat on both 
sides. Cover loosely and set in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes (or as long as it 
takes to prepare the fire in the grill).
Vary It! For a spicy dry rib rub, add cayenne pepper, seeded and chopped jalapeño 
pepper, or Tabasco sauce to taste. For a jerk-flavored rub, add cayenne pepper, allspice, 
and cinnamon to taste.

156
Part III: For the Fanatics of the Classics 
Country-Style Barbecue Sauce
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped 
(about 
1⁄2 cup)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced (about 2 
teaspoons)
3⁄4 cup water
2⁄3 cup ketchup
6 tablespoons cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup dark brown sugar, packed
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon molasses
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
Step 2: Fixin’ the Apple-Beef Basting Sauce
Thick, sugar-loaded barbecue sauces mopped onto ribs too early can burn and char the 
surfaces of the meat. To keep pork ribs moist as they slow-cook for a long time on the 
grill, you can use a simple, low-sugar (or sugar-free) basting sauce made from any 
number of ingredients. Some grill chefs like a peppery solution of crushed red pepper 
and water. Others mix a smoky-flavored whiskey like bourbon or Scotch with a little 
water to taste. In this Apple-Beef Basting Sauce recipe, we use a simple combination of 
apple juice and beef broth. The apple juice does contain a little natural sugar, but it’s 
not enough to char the meat. (You can also use this sauce to keep pork loins and other 
large cuts of meat moist as they grill.)
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1 cup (enough for 4 to 5 pounds of pork ribs)
1⁄2 cup apple juice
1⁄2 cup beef or chicken broth
 
 In a small glass measuring cup or mixing bowl, combine the apple juice and beef or 
chicken broth. Use the mixture as a basting sauce to brush on 4 to 5 pounds of pork 
ribs, about every 20 to 25 minutes as they grill.
Step 3: Grillin’ and Saucin’ Time
As the ribs grill, you have time to prepare the Country-Style Barbecue Sauce. Or, if you 
prefer, you can make and refrigerate the sauce up to 3 days prior to grilling. Be sure to 
reheat it in a small pan on top of the stove before basting the ribs, however.
Preparation time: 35 minutes
Grilling time: 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1 3- to 4-pound rack of pork spareribs, 
seasoned with Gingery Spice Rub (see 
previous recipe)

157
 Chapter 9: Maybe Messy, Definitely Delicious: Ribs Worth Drooling Over
 1 Prepare a fire in a covered grill with 45 to 50 charcoal briquettes. After the briquettes 
are hot, use long-handled tongs to bank them to one side of the fire grate. On the other 
side of the fire grate, place a large drip pan half filled with water next to the banked 
coals. The pan should be large enough to completely sit under the ribs. A grill or oven 
thermometer should read about 350 degrees over the drip pan in the covered grill when 
the fire is ready. Try to maintain this moderate temperature as the ribs continue to 
cook.
 2 Brush the grill grid with oil and set in place. Place the ribs on the grid, fat side up. (Or 
place the ribs in a rib rack.) Cover and cook over indirect heat for 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours, turning 
and basting the ribs every 20 minutes with the Apple Basting Sauce.
 
 Be sure to adjust the grill vents to maintain an even, moderate heat. If the heat is too 
hot and the ribs are browning too quickly, close the top vents to lower the temperature 
of the fire. Add hot briquettes to the fire every 30 to 40 minutes, or as necessary to 
maintain a steady, moderate heat.
 3 Meanwhile, prepare the Country-Style Barbecue Sauce. Heat the oil in a medium sauce-
pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until the onion 
wilts, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining ingredients. Raise the heat to high and 
bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes or until thickened, stir-
ring often.
 4 About 15 minutes before removing the ribs from the grill, apply the barbecue sauce, 
turning and basting the ribs 2 to 3 times.
 5 The ribs are done when you can easily cut through the end rib with a sharp kitchen 
knife and move the bones back and forth without much resistance. Remove the ribs 
from the grill and cut into serving-size portions. Bring the remaining sauce to a rapid 
boil in the saucepan and serve with the ribs.

For foods that take longer than 40 minutes to grill, you need to replenish the 
fuel in your charcoal fire in one of two ways:
 
✓ Add 10 to 12 fresh briquettes to the burning coals every 30 minutes.
 
✓ Keep a metal pail filled with burning briquettes next to the grill and add 
a half-dozen (or more, depending on the size of the fire) every 40 minutes.

Donna Myers’s Baby Back Ribs with 
 
Sweet-Hickory Barbecue Sauce
As a spokesperson for the Barbecue Industry Association for the last 25 years, Donna 
Myers probably knows more barbecuing and grilling secrets than most seasoned pit-
masters. In this recipe, Donna protects baby back ribs from the intense heat of the grill 
by wrapping them in aluminum foil until nearly cooked. In the final 30 minutes, the ribs 
are grilled over indirect heat where they develop a nice brown crust without any char-
ring or overbrowning. Donna’s rib barbecue sauce is savory-sweet with a hint of liquid 
hickory smoke seasoning, which you should be able to find at most grocery stores. It’s 
one of our very favorite sauces in the book; it’s delicious with any kind of poultry, beef 
ribs, steaks, or even burgers.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 1
1⁄2 hours
Yield: 3 to 4 main dish servings or 6 to 8 appetizer servings

 Chapter 9: Maybe Messy, Definitely Delicious: Ribs Worth Drooling Over
2 full racks baby back pork ribs (about 3 
1⁄2 
pounds)
4 tablespoons water
2 teaspoons liquid hickory smoke seasoning
1
1⁄2 cups Sweet-Hickory Barbecue Sauce (see 
following recipe)
 1 In a covered grill, prepare a medium charcoal fire or preheat a gas grill to medium.
 2 Cut each rack of ribs in half to make 4 equal-sized pieces, with about 6 to 7 ribs to a 
piece. Lay 2 of the pieces side-by-side on a long sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil. 
Wrap tightly, using a drugstore wrap, but leave one end of the foil packet open. (Figure 
9-1 illustrates how to use a drugstore wrap.) Repeat with the 2 remaining rib pieces and 
a second long sheet of foil.
 3 Combine the water and liquid smoke seasoning; spoon half of the liquid smoke-water 
mixture into each foil packet; seal the ends tightly to prevent leakage.
 4 Place both packets flat on the preheated grill grid; cover and cook for a total of 60 min-
utes, turning the packets over about every 20 minutes. Remove the packets from the 
grill to a large baking pan and let rest.
 5 If you’re using a gas grill, raise the heat on one burner to create a medium-hot indirect 
fire. If you’re using a charcoal grill, add more coals to the fire to raise the temperature 
to medium-hot, and then bank the coals to one side. (See Chapter 1 for information 
about building an indirect fire.)
 6 Remove the foil wrapping from the ribs; place the ribs on a lightly oiled grid, opposite the 
fire or heat. Cover the grill and cook for about 30 minutes or until the ribs are done, turn-
ing and basting both sides with the Sweet-Hickory Barbecue Sauce about every 10 minutes. 
Heat the remaining sauce just to boiling in a small saucepan and serve with the ribs.

Soul Food Pork Ribs
It’s difficult to describe exactly what it is that makes soul food different from other 
southern food, but we think it’s safe to say there’s usually a little more sweetness in 
soul food. When it comes to barbecued ribs, this extra sweetness is certainly the case, 
and the ribs tend to take more saucing and remain juicier. (See the color photo section 
to see what these tasty ribs look like when they’re finished barbecuing.)
Step 1: Preparing the Mop Sauce
This mop sauce can be prepared at any time — even days — before grilling the ribs 
because the ingredients used stay fresh for weeks, even months, as long as the mixture 
is kept tightly closed and refrigerated.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: Enough sauce to mop 3 to 4 pounds of pork spareribs
1 cup cider vinegar
1⁄2 cup water
1 tablespoon salt
3⁄4 teaspoon ground chili pepper
 1 Combine all the ingredients in a small bowl, stir to dissolve the salt, and set aside.
 2 You may brush the sauce onto the meat at this point and let the meat absorb some of 
the flavors. Some barbecue cooks like to cook the meat without any sauce, which leads 
to a smokier flavor in the meat. So if that’s how you want to do it, simply add the sauce 
only in the last hour or so of cooking time.

 Chapter 9: Maybe Messy, Definitely Delicious: Ribs Worth Drooling Over
 1 Prepare an indirect fire in a covered grill with about 45 briquettes. After the briquettes 
are hot, use long-handled tongs to bank the briquettes to one side of the fire grate. On 
the other side of the fire grate, place a drip pan half filled with water next to the banked 
coals. The drip pan should be large enough to completely sit under the ribs. A grill or 
oven thermometer should read about 325 degrees to 350 degrees in the covered grill 
when the fire is ready. Try to maintain this moderate temperature as the ribs continue 
to cook.
 2 Place the mopped ribs on the hot grill, fat side up. Cover and cook for 4 hours, turning 
and basting the ribs every 30 minutes with the additional mop sauce. Because one slab 
of ribs will be closer to the coals than the other, be sure to rotate the ribs every hour.
 
 Throughout the barbecuing, adjust the grill vents to maintain an even, moderate heat. If 
the heat is too hot and the ribs are browning too fast, close the top vents to lower the 
temperature of the fire. Add 8 to 10 briquettes to the fire every 40 to 60 minutes, or as 
necessary to maintain a steady, moderate heat.
 3 Meanwhile, prepare the Southern Soul Barbecue Sauce (see the following recipe).
 4 Brush on some of the barbecue sauce during the last 30 minutes of barbecuing. You can 
tell the ribs are fully cooked when the meat is tender and it has shrunken slightly away 
from the bones. Serve with the remaining hot barbecue sauce on the side.
Vary It! If you want to add smoke flavor to your ribs, add 1 cup of presoaked drained 
wood chips to the coals when you begin to barbecue. Then after two hours of barbecuing, 
add another cup of presoaked, drained wood chips to the coals.
2 racks of pork spareribs (3 to 4 pounds each)
Mop Sauce (see previous recipe)
Southern Soul Barbecue Sauce (see following 
recipe)
Step 2: Moppin’ and Grillin’ the Ribs
You want the temperature of your grill to hover between 300 degrees and 325 degrees 
to allow these ribs to cook “low and slow.” If the ribs appear dry on the outside, you 
can wrap them in foil with some mop sauce. They’ll be happy to slowly cook in the foil 
for several hours. Then you can remove them from the foil and let them finish cooking 
over the dryer environment for the last hour.
You want the ribs to become “fall off the bone” tender, but tender ribs can cause a bit 
of an issue if you aren’t prepared. The full racks may come apart as you’re trying to flip 
them over, so at some point they become much easier to manage if you cut them into 
sections containing two or three ribs per section. We recommend cutting them when 
you’re ready to slather them in barbecue sauce.

Getting to Know Beef Ribs
Much like pork ribs, beef ribs come in different styles and from different 
sections of the animal. The most tender beef ribs for grilling come from the 
rib portion of the steer and are sold as either back ribs (also known as beef 
spareribs) or beef short ribs.
 
The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association recommends slow grilling beef 
back ribs over indirect heat to infuse them with lots of smoky flavor. If you 
purchase short ribs from the chuck portion of the steer and grill them with-
out any precooking, you may be disappointed. Chuck short ribs are too tough 
for grilling. These ribs are best when they’re first braised in the oven or on 
top of the stove and then finished off on the barbecue grill to give them the 
smoky flavor you crave.
Beef short ribs are also known as Korean ribs because they’re often mari-
nated in a sauce that includes soy sauce, ginger, scallions, sake, and other 
ingredients common to Asian cuisine. These ribs are cut from the spare rib 
rack so that each rib piece has three crosswise-cut rib bones. They’re juicy 
and meaty, and best of all, unlike other cuts of beef and pork ribs, beef short 
ribs grill quickly — in only about 12 minutes. The following recipe is ideal as 
a party appetizer if you cut each rib into three small pieces after grilling.

Preparation time: 40 minutes
Yield: Enough to coat 3 to 4 pounds of pork spareribs

Ask your butcher to cut your beef short ribs into 3-inch lengths, about 
3⁄8- to 
1⁄2-
inch thick, for best results on the grill.
 
Korean Beef Short Ribs
Korean short ribs are traditionally grilled quickly over medium heat, with frequent 
applications of a sesame-soy marinade. The result is a rib with a pink, medium-rare inte-
rior color and a rich, bronzed exterior. If you prefer your ribs more tender and with the 
meat falling off the bone, cook them indirectly for a longer period of time.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours to overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 main dish servings or 10 appetizer servings
4 green onions, trimmed and finely chopped
1⁄2 cup soy sauce
1⁄4  cup sake, dry sherry, or dry vermouth
1⁄4  cup water
1⁄4  cup sesame oil
3 tablespoons dark brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger, 
or 1 teaspoon ground ginger
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄4  teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
3 to 4 pounds beef short ribs (also called flanken 
short ribs), trimmed of excess fat and cut 
crosswise about 
1⁄2-inch thick (see Figure 9-2)
 1 Combine all ingredients in a large, resealable plastic bag or a large nonreactive container. 
Seal the bag or cover the dish, and refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Remove the ribs from the marinade, reserving the marinade. Place the ribs on a well-
oiled grill grid.
 4 Grill for 5 to 6 minutes; baste both sides of the ribs with the reserved marinade. Cover 
and continue cooking for 5 to 6 minutes on the other side. The ribs should be a rich 
golden brown on both sides, with a pink interior.
 5 Toast sesame seeds in a dry skillet, in a single layer, over medium-low heat until lightly 
browned. Remove the seeds immediately from the skillet to keep them from overbrown-
ing or burning. Sprinkle over the ribs before serving.

Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill?
Oh Yes, You Can
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering how to rotisserie cook your food
▶ Experimenting with recipes for the rotisserie
T
he very first grills were some primal form of 
rotisseries — just a stick that someone turned 
every once in a while over a fire. Today, electric 
rotisseries are available as grill accessories and 
make this once time-consuming chore a leisure-
time activity.
In this chapter, you find out about the benefits of rotisserie cooking and how 
best to use a rotisserie in a covered gas grill. We discuss cooking times — 
which differ a great deal from tossing food directly on a grill — and give you 
the low-down on sauces that you can make by reclaiming juices from the 
rotisserie drip pan.
Grilling Off the Grid: A Primer 
on Rotisserie Cooking
Although we spend most of this book exalting the pleasures of cooking 
directly on a grill grid, we now state unequivocally that rotisserie cooking a 
few inches above the grid not only offers a few benefits but also imparts won-
derful taste and textures to those foods. Rotisserie cooking takes a bit longer 
than placing the food directly on the grill but really no longer than if you 
cook it in a kitchen oven.
A rotisserie that turns at a constant, never-varying speed allows the same 
degree of heat to cook every inch of the food, thereby guaranteeing that a 
roast or bird will be succulent throughout. Food cooked on a rotisserie holds

its moisture better than food cooked in an oven because the surface sears 
quickly and therefore seals in natural juices.
 
Rotisserie cooking is also healthier in some ways because you need to add 
very little extra fat, or none at all, before the food is placed on the spit — the 
rod of the rotisserie that holds the food above the fire — for cooking. The 
meat self-bastes.
Choosing the best meat for the mill
Rotisserie cookery is best for “round” food, that is, large roasts, whole poul-
try, and whole fish. The more delicate the flesh, the better results rotisserie 
grilling provides. Of course, rotisserie cookery isn’t ideal for every food. We 
wouldn’t stick a skewer through a whole steak, lamb chop, or beef fillet, and 
many of our kebab recipes are best placed directly on the grill so they pick 
up flavor from the burning coals. But if you like moist, juicy roasts and if you 
have the time to spend, rotisserie cookery is a wonderful process — and, 
thanks to electric rotisserie units, it’s almost foolproof.
The rotisserie seems made for beef roasts because it keeps them juicy inside 
and nicely crisp on the outside. Beef roasts that are perfect for rotisserie 
cooking include the boneless beef top sirloin roast, round tip roasts (also 
called the sirloin tip), boneless rib-eye roasts, and the eye of round roast. 
Beef roasts practically baste themselves in their own juices as they turn on 
the spit. Pork is also a favorite for rotisserie cooking. The interior of the meat 
stays naturally moist while the outside surface develops a nice brown crust.
Keeping some general tips in mind
Rotisserie cooking has its own set of simple rules. Here they are in no par-
ticular order:
 
✓ Pay attention to cook times. As with grilling, many factors, such as 
wind, air temperature, humidity, and the size and thickness of the food, 
affect the performance and actual cooking times of your rotisserie. 
Recipes can only give approximate cooking times, so check the manufac-
turer’s manual for cooking times and guidelines.
 
✓ Keep the pieces of food of more or less equal size. Cutting food into 
equal pieces ensures consistency in the cooking time.
 
✓ Watch for floppy limbs and imbalanced spits. Poultry wings and legs, 
which may flop around on the rotisserie, should be trussed or tied 
securely (though not too tightly) to the body with heavy cotton kitchen 
twine. See Figure 10-1, later in this chapter, for an illustration showing 
how to truss a bird.

167
 Chapter 10: Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill? Oh Yes, You Can
 
 For larger food, such as a roast, make sure that the food is balanced on 
the skewer before placing it over the grill. Too much weight or an imbal-
anced weight can cause the machine motor to malfunction and burn out. 
Weights are often provided on electric rotisseries to help achieve this 
balance.
 
✓ Always use a drip pan under your rotisserie grilled foods. Why? A 
good deal of fat will drip onto the coals — fat that you could use to make 
a sauce later. By using these drippings to baste the food, you not only 
keep the food moist but you create more drippings for use in a sauce, 
just as if you had cooked the food in your kitchen oven.
 
 If you don’t plan to baste or make a sauce, fill the pan half full with 
water, which adds moisture. Never allow the liquid in the drip pan to 
evaporate.
 
✓ Use a properly sized drip pan. Your drip pan should be large enough 
to accommodate the length and width of the food being cooked, but it 
shouldn’t be so large that it blocks the heat of the grill.
 
✓ Avoid sugary sauces and marinades. Marinate and baste with any 
combination of liquids, herbs, and spices, but keep sugared ingredients 
to a minimum. Don’t baste with a sauce that has a high sugar content 
until the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking; otherwise the sauce will char.

✓ Use a spray bottle to mist and add moisture to rotisserie meats or 
poultry as they spit-roast. Fill the bottle with any combination of 
flavored liquids, such as soy sauce, sherry, apple juice, or beef broth, 
and your favorite herbs and spices. Mist about every 20 minutes.
 
✓ Keep an eye on your temperature. If the food browns too quickly, 
reduce the temperature setting on your rotisserie. The food may take a 
little longer to cook, but you’ll avoid scorching it.
 
✓ Stay safe from the heat. It’s always a good idea to wear a heavy mitt 
when raising the rotisserie hood.
 
✓ Experiment by adding an extra smoky flavor to the meat. You can do 
this by cooking the food until almost done and then reducing the heat of 
the coals and covering the grill, thereby allowing smoke to build up and 
permeate the meat.
 
✓ Use a meat thermometer. If ever there was a good reason to buy a 
stainless steel insert thermometer (see Chapter 2), a rotisserie is it. You 
can easily pluck a steak or grill basket off the fire and cut into the food 
to see if it’s cooked the way you like it. Unfortunately, you really can’t do 
that with ease or safety with a turning rotisserie. Even if you shut off the 
rotisserie and cut into the meat, you’ll still create a pocketlike gash in 
the meat that will get more heat than the rest of the surface and interior 
when you switch the rotisserie back on.
 
 So, for rotisserie cooking, the thermometer should be inserted in the 
deepest part of the food at the beginning of the cooking time. If you 
think that the thermometer may fall out when the food turns, secure the 
thermometer with a string.

✓ To avoid overcooking the food, check the temperature about 15 to 
20 minutes before the final estimated cooking time. The temperature 
will rise more rapidly at the end of cooking time than at the beginning. 
Unlike oven-roasted food, rotisserie-cooked food doesn’t increase in 
temperature and doesn’t continue to cook after it’s taken off the rotisserie. 
However, all roasts should rest for 5 to 10 minutes after cooking to allow 
the juices to settle and to make carving easier.
 
✓ Save your leftovers. Rotisserie cooks often use large beef, pork, or 
poultry roasts so they have an abundance of delicious leftovers. Shred 
or thinly slice leftover meat for hearty sandwiches or add the meat to 
homemade soups and tossed lettuce or pasta salads. You also may want 
to mix the leftovers with shredded lettuce and roll the mixture up in soft 
taco shells.
 
For the best results, check your manufacturer’s instruction manual for tips, 
recipes, temperature settings, and cooking times that are specific to your 
rotisserie and the foods you’re cooking.
Heeding meat-specific 
rotisserie cooking tips
The following list provides a few general tips for rotisserie cooking different 
cuts of beef, poultry, pork, lamb, and fish. For more specific jargon and shop-
ping tips, refer to the specific meat’s chapter in Part IV of this book.
 
✓ Beef roasts: Coat the exterior of these roasts lightly with olive oil and 
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and other seasonings, such as garlic powder. 
Rub the surface with dried herbs and spices to give the exterior a nice 
brown crust when it’s cooked.
 
 Cooking times and temperatures vary according to the heat intensity of 
your rotisserie, but a good rule is that the less tender the cut, the more 
slowly the roast should be cooked. For lean round tip and eye round 
roasts, set the temperature on medium or medium-low for long, slow 
cooking. Top sirloin and rib-eye roasts, which are more tender and contain 
more fat, can be cooked over higher temperatures — from medium to 
medium-high. For best results, check your grill manual for recommended 
temperature settings and grilling times. The internal temperature should 
reach 135 to 140 degrees before the roast is removed from the spit.
 
✓ Pork: Ribs and boneless pork loins (see recipes for Rotisserie Pork 
Spareribs and Rotisserie Boneless Pork Loin with Herbes de Provence 
later in this chapter) are favorite cuts, but rolled shoulders and boned 
fresh hams are also delicious. Ribs that are rotisserie cooked don’t have 
that soft, “fall off the bone” texture that you get from indirect grilling. 
Instead, they have a firmer, chewier meat, which some people find more 
desirable.

169
 Chapter 10: Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill? Oh Yes, You Can
 
 Keep the seasoning simple so the rotisserie taste of the meat comes 
through. Try brushing the surface of the roast or ribs with any of the oils 
in Chapter 5 or with a good commercially produced flavored oil — such 
as roasted garlic or herb oil — and then sprinkle with salt and freshly 
ground black pepper to taste. Cook pork cuts until the internal tempera-
ture reaches 145 to 155 degrees.
 
✓ Lamb: A leg of lamb, with its bone intact, is one of the more difficult 
meat cuts to balance on a spit. For best results, ask your butcher to 
remove the bone and to butterfly the leg. Boned and rolled shoulder 
roasts and racks of lamb can also be spit roasted and are smaller and 
easier to skewer and cook.
 
 You can marinate any of these cuts, or you can simply season them with 
olive oil, garlic, and salt and pepper. Fasten the meat to the spit and 
cook on medium-high to high heat, or according to the instructions in 
your grilling manual, until the temperature reaches 135 degrees for rare 
or 140 or 145 degrees for medium.
 
✓ Turkey: Turkeys are best if they’re first butterflied by your butcher. 
Whole turkeys have very large bones that tend to prevent even cook-
ing on a spit. The final result can be thigh meat that’s undercooked and 
breast meat that’s overcooked and dry.
 
 Season the butterflied turkey inside and out and tie it back together for 
rotisserie cooking. You can even add a thin layer of cranberry stuffing or 
dressing to the inside before you tie the bird. Cook on high and remove 
the turkey from the spit when the internal temperature reaches 175 
degrees. Note: A stuffed bird takes a bit longer to cook, and the stuffing 
should be tested with a meat thermometer. Boneless turkey breasts, two 
at a time, are also great choices for rotisserie cooking.
 
✓ Other poultry: You can cook a pair of chickens or even four Cornish 
game hens or squab together on one spit. (See Chapter 14 for more 
information on Cornish game hens and squab.) Most spit rods can hold 
about 12 pounds of meat at one time. The length of the rod and barbecue 
determine the actual number.
 
 Be sure to tie the legs and wings of each bird securely to their bodies 
before cooking. Doing so prevents the limbs from flopping around as the 
spit turns. Except for turkey (which I discuss earlier in this section), all 
poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 180 degrees. You 
also can stuff poultry before rotisserie cooking, but the cooking times 
will be longer.
 
✓ Fish: Fish should really be rotisserie cooked in a swinging basket that 
rocks back and forth over the heat. Fish flesh is so fragile that it can 
easily fall apart if tied to the spit and rotated over the fire. Rotisserie 
baskets are becoming increasingly popular; they’re available at major 
department stores that carry a full line of grill equipment, at restaurant 
supply stores, and through the toll-free numbers of many grill manufac-
turers. (Check out Chapter 2 for contact information for a list of popular 
manufacturers.)

170
Part III: For the Fanatics of the Classics 
 
 Fish fillets are better than whole fish for rotisserie cooking. Whole fish 
tends to release and splatter oils all over the inside of the grill, causing it 
to smell fishy for a long time. Brush cod, salmon, or flatfish fillets with a 
little oil and then dip them lightly into fresh, seasoned bread crumbs to 
give them a little protective coating. Place them in the basket and cook 
over medium heat for about 8 to 12 minutes or until the flesh is opaque.
Let the Rotisserie Games Begin!
Rotisserie cooking interjects yet another dimension of fun and games into 
the grilling story. As a rotisserie chef, you get to attach food to a metal rod or 
spit and watch with fascination as it rotates over the heat of the grill. (What 
could be more fun than that?) Except for seasoning and securing the food 
to the spit, you need to do little else to guarantee success. Just baste a few 
times and avoid overcooking.
In this section, we give you rotisserie recipes for chicken, ribs, pork, just to 
get you started. Seafood like shrimp and kebabs are also good for the rotisserie. 
After you’re hooked (or should we say skewered), you’ll want to experiment 
with recipes of your own.
 
Rotisserie-Grilled Chicken
If you’ve never used a rotisserie attachment, start with this chicken recipe. The bird 
produced is juicy, tender, and packed with flavor. You may even decide to forever 
abandon the technique of roasting poultry in the oven!
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Marinating time: 3 hours
Rotisserie time: 1
1⁄4 hours
Yield: 4 servings
1 3
1⁄2- to 4-pound chicken
Marinade
1 cup dry white wine
1⁄2 cup olive oil
3 cloves garlic, peeled and coarsely chopped
2 teaspoons minced lemon peel (about 1 
lemon)
Juice of 1 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)
3 fresh rosemary or thyme sprigs, about 3 to 4 
inches long
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Pepper to taste

171
 Chapter 10: Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill? Oh Yes, You Can
Spice Rub
1 teaspoon ground thyme
1⁄2 teaspoon paprika
1⁄2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1⁄4 teaspoon ground ginger
Pepper to taste
 1 Remove all excess fat and giblets from the chicken cavity. (Wrap and freeze the giblets 
for adding to soups or stocks, if desired.) Rinse the chicken in cold water; pat dry with 
paper towels. Truss the bird to keep its wings and legs from drooping as the spit turns. 
(See Figure 10-1.)
 2 In a medium mixing bowl or a large, resealable plastic bag, make the marinade by com-
bining the white wine, olive oil, garlic, 2 teaspoons lemon peel, lemon juice, rosemary or 
thyme sprigs, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. Add the chicken to the marinade. Cover the 
bowl with plastic wrap, or press the air out of the bag and seal it shut. The chicken 
should fit snugly in the bowl or bag, with the marinade covering it as much as possible. 
Refrigerate for about 3 hours.
 3 Preheat a covered grill with a rotisserie attachment to high (or to the temperature rec-
ommended by your grill manufacturer for cooking chicken on a rotisserie).
 4 While the grill is preheating, in a small bowl, make a spice rub by mixing together the 
ground thyme, paprika, 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt, 
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon peel, ginger, and pepper. 
Remove the chicken from the marinade; pour the marinade into a drip pan that’s only 
slightly larger than the chicken. Rub the spice mixture all over the chicken, sprinkling 
some into the cavity as well.
 5 Following the rotisserie instructions of your grill manufacturer, arrange the bird on the 
spit, securing it with the pronged rotisserie forks. (Refer to Figure 10-2.) Set the drip 
pan with the marinade on the grill grid, directly under the chicken. As the bird cooks, 
the pan collects juices that flavor the basting sauce.
 6 Cook, with the spit turning, in a covered grill for about 1
1⁄4 hours or until done, basting 3 
times, or about every 20 minutes, with the juices in the drip pan. (For a crispy skin, 
omit basting during the last 20 minutes.) When the chicken is done, an instant-read 
thermometer inserted into the chicken between its thigh and breast will register 
between 180 degrees and 185 degrees.
 7 Remove the chicken from the spit onto a serving plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil 
and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. Serve with pan juices or, if desired, 
Lemon-Herb Gravy (see the following recipe).
Go-With: Suggested side dishes include mashed potatoes or Middle Eastern Rice 
(Chapter 16).

Lemon-Herb Gravy
You can make a delicious gravy from the rotisserie chicken pan juices. Strain the juices 
in the drip pan through a strainer or sieve over a glass measuring cup. Discard the 
solids left in the strainer. Pour off and discard all but 2
1⁄2 tablespoons of the fat. (The fat 
is the darker liquid that rises to the surface of the measuring cup.) Save all the other 
juices in the measuring cup. At this point, you can spoon some of these juices over the 
carved chicken. Or you can use these same juices to make this Lemon-Herb Gravy. It’s 
especially wonderful with mashed potatoes.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 
3⁄4 cup, approximately six servings at 2 tablespoons per serving
2
1⁄2 tablespoons fat from rotisserie chicken 
pan juices
2
1⁄2 tablespoons flour
3⁄4 cup pan juices (fat removed)
1⁄2 cup chicken broth or water
Juice of 1 lemon
Pepper
 
 Pour the fat into a small saucepan over medium heat. Using a fork or wire whisk, blend 
the flour into the fat to make a roux, or thickening paste. Gradually whisk in the 
reserved pan juices, the chicken broth or water, and lemon juice. Keep whisking over 
medium heat until the gravy comes to a boil; boil 1 minute. Adjust the seasoning with 
pepper to taste.

When spit roasting poultry, run the spit through the breast, parallel to the 
backbone and out through the body cavity, centering the rod as much as pos-
sible. The spit prongs should be attached through the breast and tail areas to 
firmly secure the bird. Be sure that the bird is properly balanced on the rod; 
test the balance by turning the shaft in the palms of both hands. (See Figure 
10-3.) If during the course of cooking, the spit prongs become detached from 
the bird, simply shut off the motor and, using a protective mitt, push the 
prongs back into the bird and retighten the fastening screws.

ance test.
 
 
Rotisserie Pork Spareribs
Pork spareribs are an excellent choice for rotisserie cooking. Spit cooking naturally 
bastes the ribs and keeps them from burning, while the fat melts into the drip pan, 
becoming part of a delicious basting sauce. Apply sweet barbecue sauces only during 
the last 15 minutes of cooking time to prevent charring. The delicious drip pan juices in 
the following recipe may be stored frozen in a covered container and added to gravies 
or stews later.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 3 hours or overnight
Rotisserie time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings

175
 Chapter 10: Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill? Oh Yes, You Can
 1 Sprinkle the ribs on both sides with the lemon juice. In a small bowl, combine the 
brown sugar, salt, pepper, ginger, and garlic powder. Rub the seasonings all over both 
sides of the ribs. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours or overnight 
for best flavor.
 2 Preheat a covered grill with a rotisserie attachment to medium-hot. (Grill temperatures 
and heat settings on gas grills vary from one manufacturer to the next. Check your grill 
manual for the recommended heat setting and estimated times for rotisserie cooking 
pork ribs.)
 3 Slide one of the metal spit prongs onto the spit rod. Starting midway up and at one end 
of the rack, stick the spit rod between the first and second rib. (Refer to Figure 10-4.) 
Skip 2 or 3 ribs and skewer again until the entire rack of ribs is “accordion-pleated.” 
Fasten the second spit prong into place on the rod; slide both prongs into the ribs to 
help secure the ribs to the rod. The rack should be balanced on the spit to ensure even 
cooking and to keep the rotisserie motor from straining as it turns. (Refer to Figure 10-3 
for more on balancing your food on a spit.)
 4 Center on the grill a disposable aluminum drip pan that’s just large enough to fit under 
the ribs. (If the pan is too large, it may obstruct the heat of the grill.) Pour the apple 
juice and beef broth into the pan. Put the spit in place and baste the ribs with the apple-
broth mixture. Cover and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour, basting every 15 minutes with 
the drip pan juices, until the ribs are tender when pierced with a thin, sharp knife. 
(Actual cooking time depends on the heat of the rotisserie.) Be sure to keep the drip 
pan filled with at least an inch of the apple-broth mixture (or water if you run out) at all 
times to prevent the ribs from charring.
 5 Brush the ribs with your favorite barbecue sauce (or use one of the barbecue sauces in 
Chapter 9). Cover and rotisserie cook for another 15 minutes or until the meat is fully 
cooked but still moist. (Unlike ribs cooked indirectly in a covered grill, rotisserie ribs 
won’t result in meat that “wiggles” or falls off the bone. The rotisserie cooked meat will 
be firmer in texture.)
Go-With: Serve with Orange-Ginger Coleslaw or Grilled Tomatoes with Cumin Butter (both 
in Chapter 16).

Rotisserie Boneless Pork Loin with 
 
Herbes de Provence
When it comes to rotisserie cooking, few people are more qualified to give advice than 
Ed Newman. A chef and restaurateur for more than 30 years, at press time for this 
book’s first edition, Ed ran Solutions, Inc., a Florida-based food consulting company.
In this recipe, Ed calls for seasoning the boneless pork loin with herbes de Provence — 
a blend of dried herbs commonly used in French cooking. Several herb and spice com-
panies, like McCormick, sell this blend, or you can make your own. You probably 
already have these dried herbs in your kitchen pantry.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 8 hours or overnight
Rotisserie time: 30 to 35 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 pounds center-cut boneless pork loin
1⁄4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons dried herbes de Provence (or a 
combination of 3 or 4 of the following dried 
herbs: oregano, thyme, basil, chervil, 
marjoram, rosemary, summer savory, or sage)
2 tablespoons cracked black peppercorns
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
1⁄4 teaspoon salt

177
 Chapter 10: Pair a Rotisserie with a Grill? Oh Yes, You Can
 1 Place the loin in a shallow baking dish. In a small mixing bowl, combine all the remain-
ing ingredients; rub the mixture over the pork. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 
for at least 8 hours, or overnight.
 2 Preheat a covered grill with a rotisserie attachment to hot. (Grill temperatures and heat 
settings on gas grills vary. Check your grill manual for the recommended heat setting 
and estimated cooking time for rotisserie cooking pork.)
 3 Remove the pork from the dish. Center and secure to the spit rod. Put the spit into 
place over the grill. Place a disposable aluminum pan under the pork on top of the grill 
grid. The pan should be half filled with water to catch juices and provide moisture to 
the roast as it turns. It should be only slightly larger than the pork. (Using a pan that’s 
too large cuts off the grill’s heat.)
 4 Cook for a total of 30 to 35 minutes. After about 25 minutes, check the internal tempera-
ture with an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast. When 
the pork is done, the internal temperature will register 155 degrees, and the carved 
slices will be very moist with a light pink blush.
 5 Let the loin rest for 5 to 10 minutes on the rod. Remove the spit rod and carve the roast 
across the grain into thin slices.
Go-With: This pork loin is excellent when served with Tomato Chutney (Chapter 6).

All You Need to Know to Grill 
a Mean Hunk of Beef
Concerns over the high fat and cholesterol in beef, in our opinion, have been 
overemphasized by zealots who neglect to mention beef’s healthful proper-
ties. True, a 16-ounce steak with baked potato and sour cream, onion rings, 
and a piece of cheesecake for dessert is not what you’d call a low-cal dinner, 
but it’s not the beef that accounts for most of those calories.

Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
Beef is an excellent source of protein, iron, zinc, niacin, phosphorus, and B 
vitamins. And both fat and cholesterol — in moderation — are essential to 
a human diet. A portion of meat, in today’s definition, is a piece the size of a 
deck of cards — about 4 ounces.
 
Despite its innate healthfulness, beef, like other animal products, may carry 
potentially harmful bacteria. So be sure to follow these precautions:
 
✓ If the meat has been frozen, don’t thaw it at room temperature. Bacteria 
can build up during the thawing process. Besides, thawing in the refrig-
erator overnight makes for a better texture in the meat.
 
✓ Always store meat of any kind in the refrigerator or freezer after 
purchase.
 
✓ To kill off all bacteria, cook all ground beef hamburgers to 160 degrees 
(or medium), with no trace of pink remaining in the center of the patty. 
Bacteria problems are almost always due to meat that’s ground in enor-
mous volumes and shipped to a supermarket. Freshly ground meat from 
a reliable butcher is, however, unlikely to contain bacteria, and so you 
must decide if you want to cook it to rare or medium-rare. You can cook 
other beef cuts to lower internal temperatures.
 
✓ Never place the cooked or grilled meat on the same platter that held the 
raw meat.
The relative quality of beef depends on its grade and on the cut you choose. 
The following sections give you a rundown on the different grades and cuts 
you’ll hear about when talking beef with buddies or your butcher.
Grading beef
Since 1927, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has graded beef through a 
voluntary program on behalf of the meat packers. For consumers, grade is a 
gauge for determining eating quality.
The more marbling (flecks of fat within the meat) — which, by the way, 
should be evenly distributed — the more flavorful the steaks. In addition to 
marbling, meat graders look at characteristics such as age or maturity, color, 
and meat texture.
The USDA has eight grades for meat, and the particular grade is clearly dis-
played on the package label. Over the last 20 years, however, the grading of 
meat has changed to reflect a rise in demand for the higher cuts of beef now 
served in expensive steakhouses. There are still eight grades, but the top 
grades tend to have considerably less fat marbling than they used to. As a 
result, a carcass that may once have been graded as “Top Choice” may now 
be graded as “Prime,” which fetches top dollar for meat sellers.

183
 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
The following list shows the three grades that are most often found at your 
supermarket or butcher shop. Rarely would you find any grade below Select 
sold — although you might find it served to you on an airplane or at a hospital!
 
✓ Prime: Young beef with the most marbling is given this Prime (highest 
quality) grade. Most USDA Prime is sold to better-quality restaurants 
and to specialty butcher shops and grocery stores, especially in major 
cities. Because only about 2 percent — sometimes less — of meat today 
is graded as Prime, it’s difficult to find and is quite expensive. In the 
future, with corn supplies increasingly expensive for feed lots, produc-
ers don’t see much profit in bringing a steer up to Prime marbling, which 
is, in any case, more genetic than mere bulking up of the animal. Note 
that most USDA-graded Prime has less of the “beefy” flavor that the 
grade used to signify a decade ago.
 
 Be aware that if a restaurant, market label, or ad reads “prime” with a 
lowercase “p,” and doesn’t use the name “USDA,” you’re probably not 
getting true Prime beef.
 
 You should be aware of the difference between dry aged and wet 
aged beef. Although beef in the rest of the world is rarely aged at all, 
American beef usually is. Aging intensifies flavors by breaking down the 
enzymes in the muscle’s connective tissue and driving out moisture, 
making for a more tender, tastier, beefier beef. In the process, up to 20 
percent of the carcass weight may be lost, which explains why Prime is 
so expensive. Consider the differences between the two types of aging:
 
• Dry aged beef is stored in a temperature-and-humidity controlled 
locker for several weeks — 21 days, 28 days, even 6 weeks. It 
comes out with a rich, powerful, mineral flavor and aroma — not 
to everyone’s taste, although, as noted above, it’s more and more 
difficult to find Prime beef of this caliber.
 
• Wet aged beef is sealed in plastic after slaughter and then refriger-
ated with its own juices, which themselves help break down the 
muscle tissue. While wet aged beef (both Prime and Choice) can be 
delicious, it doesn’t have the flavor of dry aged beef.
 
 Be wary of claims made about dry aged beef from large supermarkets or 
restaurant chains. Sometimes they advertize “dry aged” beef but in real-
ity only stick wet aged beef in their own cold locker for a few more days, 
which does next to nothing to improve flavor or tenderness.
 
 “Prime rib” of roast beef is not a grade at all, but a cut from meat that’s 
between the primal chuck and short loin. It would be extremely rare to 
find USDA Prime prime rib.
 
✓ Choice: Choice is a juicy, tender grade of meat, though not quite as tasty 
as Prime. Currently about 44 percent of graded meat is Choice. It’s the 
most widely available grade of meat in America, and is still your best bet 
for a good price.

Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 
 “Angus,” which appears on many steakhouse menus, isn’t a grade of beef 
but a breed of steer, which may be of any grade. “Certified Black Angus” 
(CAB) is a proprietary name for a company that sells mostly high-grade 
Top Choice beef and a smaller percentage of Prime.
 
✓ Select: Select has the least amount of marbling of the three grades and, 
although it may be less expensive than Prime or Choice, it’s usually not 
as juicy, flavorful, or tender, either. About 27 percent of graded meat is 
classified as Select. This grade of beef is better for stewing or braising 
rather than for grilling.
Also, about 27 percent of all meat is ungraded and sometimes referred to as 
no roll.
 
Prime, choice, and select grades of meat are all suitable for grilling, but a 
Prime or Choice beef is more tender, juicy, and savory than Select. So, if you 
have a choice, choose prime or choice grades for grilling.
Naming the cuts of beef
Names of meat cuts can be confusing because there are regional and collo-
quial differences in the way butchers describe a particular cut. For instance, 
Midwesterners may refer to a luscious short loin without the fillet and bone 
as a New York strip, while people in New York call the exact same cut a 
Kansas City strip. Elsewhere it might be called a shell steak. London broil, 
often sold as a particular cut of beef, started out as a recipe made with flank 
steak. Today the term London broil is often used to identify beef top round or 
sirloin, beef chuck shoulder steak, or flank steak.
When shopping for cuts most suitable for grilling, here’s what you’ll find at 
your supermarket (see Figure 11-1):
 
✓ Top loin (strip) steak: The classic beef steak — also known as Kansas 
City strip, New York strip, and club. The top loin or strip steak is con-
sidered by many steak lovers to be the single finest cut because of its 
rich marbling, perfect texture (which is neither too firm nor too mushy), 
and its real beefy flavor. Strip steaks are usually sold boneless, but the 
bone provides an added succulence to the finished product. A 16-ounce 
strip steak should take about 12 to 15 minutes, turned once, to cook to 
medium rare.
 
✓ Tenderloin: This is a long, boneless piece of meat with three sections. 
The middle is called the center section; the larger, thicker end is called 
the butt; and the tapered end is referred to as the tip. The whole ten-
derloin weighs about 4 to 6 pounds, but it can be cut and bought as a 
smaller roast, as individual steaks, or as tenderloin tips that are good 
for kebabs. A 16-ounce strip steak should take about 12 to 15 minutes, 
turned once, to cook to medium rare.

185
 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
 
✓ Filet mignon: A term for steaks cut from the small end of the tender-
loin. These steaks, which are the most tender beef cut available, cook 
quickly and are best if cut between 1 and 2 inches thick. A 1-inch-thick 
filet, grilled directly over medium heat, takes about 13 to 15 minutes for 
medium-rare to medium.
 
✓ T-bone and porterhouse steaks: Cut from the short loin section of the 
animal, these two cuts are basically the same. Each of these steaks has 
two muscles — the tenderloin and the top loin (also called the strip). 
The distinctive T-bone (a bone down the middle of the steak that’s 
shaped like the letter “T”) helps identify each of these steaks. The dif-
ference between these cuts is the size of their tenderloin muscles: The 
porterhouse has a tenderloin muscle about the width of a silver dollar 
or bigger, while the T-bone’s tenderloin muscle is smaller than a silver 
dollar. The porterhouse is also called a sweetheart steak, because it’s 
really two steaks in one and big enough for two servings. A T-bone or 
porterhouse that’s, say, 2 inches thick, will cook in about 20 minutes. 
However, the timing will depend on the thickness of your cut.
 
✓ Rib-eye: This boneless cut comes from the rib section. Ask for rib-eye 
steaks from the small end, which is farthest from the chuck and closest 
to the more tender loin. The small end also has less fat, which is better 
for grilling. Cut the steaks about 1-inch thick and grill over medium 
heat for about 11 to 14 minutes, uncovered. If sold with the bone, these 
steaks are called rib steaks. These cook in less time, about 9 to 12 min-
utes over medium heat (for a 1-inch-thick steak).
 
✓ Sirloin: Situated next to the round and actually cut from the loin or 
hip portion of the animal, most sirloin steaks are sold boneless. They 
are fairly economical, tender, and versatile — they make great cubes 
for kebabs or strips for stir-frying. A 1-inch-thick sirloin, grilled over 
medium heat, takes about 15 to 17 minutes to grill to medium.
What’s so wonderful about wagyu?
Ten years ago you would have had to go to 
Japan to sample what’s called wagyu beef. 
Now it’s become all the rage at high-end steak-
houses and butchers here in the United States — 
even though it can get pricey! You could spend 
$160 a pound at the store, and a 12-ounce steak 
at a restaurant might set you back $200. For 
several years, true wagyu (also called Kobe, 
after the city in Japan where its main produc-
ers are) wasn’t allowed to be imported into the 
U.S., but that ban lifted in 2007. Believe it or not, 
wagyu cattle are treated to massages, a beer 
diet (high in carbs), and tender loving care. This 
special treatment helps build up as much inter-
muscular fat as possible, making the beef that 
comes from them taste and cut like butter. This 
imported beef is like no other in the world, and 
a little goes a long way — four to six ounces 
per person is more than enough. A wagyu-style 
beef is now being produced in Australia and 
the U.S. (mostly Texas). This beef is extremely 
rich (and expensive), but its flavor really doesn’t 
compare with the Japanese original.

186
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 
✓ Flank: Although considered less tender than the other cuts in this list, 
the flank steak has wonderful flavor when grilled and needs only a little 
marinating to soften. Cook only to medium-rare, usually just 5 to 10 
minutes, carving across the grain into thin slices. Turn to Chapter 17 for 
Best-Ever Fajitas made with flank steak.

 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
Preparing and Grilling Your Steaks
Is the thickness of a good steak merely a matter of personal preference? Not 
to us. We say that the best thickness for grilling any type of steak is 1 inch. 
However, the most commonly sold steak in the supermarket is only 
3⁄4 inch. 
A steak that’s 1-inch thick allows you more control than a thinner steak. A 
3⁄4-inch steak’s degree of doneness can change in a heartbeat from medium-
rare to medium on a medium-hot grill. So ask your butcher to cut your steaks 
1-inch thick. You don’t need to score the fat on a steak, but you may want to 
trim it, leaving the fat 
1⁄8- to 
1⁄4-inch thick. A little fat makes the steak moist and 
juicy. Too much fat causes dangerous flare-ups.

We recommend a medium heat to grill a 1-inch-thick steak. Medium heat (a 
four-second, hand-held count over the hot coals) gives you a nice brown crust 
without any serious charring. If you use charcoal, be sure to build an adequate 
fire — one that extends about 2 inches beyond the edges of the meat — so 
you don’t run out of fuel during the last few minutes of grilling.
 
Always thoroughly wash and dry your utensils and cutting surfaces after 
handling any form of beef (and chicken, too!). Also make sure you wash your 
hands just as thoroughly.
Making the most of lesser cuts
The U.S. market for lesser cuts of beef has 
never been better, and their availability is high 
at both specialty butchers — where they waste 
nothing! — and at ethnic food markets. Italian, 
Greek, Latino, Chinese, and Polish butchers, 
in particular, are great sources of many cuts 
of beef that you won’t easily find in your 
supermarkets.
Here are some of the lesser — or lesser 
known — cuts of beef that make for great 
eating:
 ✓ Flat iron steak: Also known as top blade, 
flat iron steak has a sliver of gristle in its 
center, which simply needs to be cut out 
with a sharp knife. Then you’re left with 
two steaks that are great for cutting into 
kebabs.
 ✓ Hanger steak: Often misspelled “hangar” 
steak, the term refers to the way this meat 
hangs from the carcass. There’s only 
one hanger steak per animal, and it has 
a tendon that you or your butcher should 
remove. This is the quintessential piece of 
beef that French bistro cooks use for steak 
frites (steak with French fries), because it 
has plenty of mineral flavor, grills quickly, 
and has a pleasantly chewy texture.
 ✓ Skirt steak: You can easily find skirt steaks 
at your butcher or supermarket these 
days. This cut of meat, which comes from 
the diaphragm, is long, somewhat sinewy, 
and streaked with marbling, making it juicy 
and rich in flavor. Skirt steak can be a little 
tough, however, so marinate it first. This 
is the classic, preferred cut for Mexican 
fajitas (even though flank is popular too).

188
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
Love them tender: Marinating meats 
before grilling
Some beef is tender and some is not. Marinating the tougher cuts helps ten-
derize the meat. Even though we like our tender steaks relatively plain, you 
can gussy them up with other flavors if you’d like.
Tender beef steaks, such as sirloin, porterhouse, T-bone, rib-eye, and tender-
loin, don’t require marinating to break down or soften the exterior surface of 
their tissues. These cuts can be simply rubbed with combinations of season-
ings that flavor the exterior of the meat as it grills. Use the rub and flavored 
oil recipes in Chapter 5, create your own rub from your spice rack, or check 
out your supermarket spice section for the commercial rubs suitable for beef.
 
Even though you don’t have to marinate the tender beef steaks, they still may 
benefit from a little dunking — from 15 minutes to 2 hours — to absorb addi-
tional flavors. Overmarinating tender beef cuts in liquid with an acid ingredi-
ent, such as lemon juice or wine, can turn the surface tissues slightly mushy.
Less-tender and less-expensive cuts — flank, skirt, top round, eye round, 
and chuck steaks — need a longer marinating time than their tender coun-
terparts. Marinate less-tender cuts in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or 
even overnight. Marinating adds flavor and helps soften the tougher muscle 
tissues. When marinated and then grilled to medium-rare, these cuts can be 
quite juicy and delicious.
Within the categories of round and chuck, some cuts are tougher than others. 
Top blade and chuck eye, which are very tender cuts considering they come 
from the chuck, don’t need to be marinated longer than 6 hours. However, 
other chuck and top round steaks benefit from long marinating — 6 hours or 
overnight.

189
 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
Grilling ’em up!
Usually, you don’t need to sear a steak — that is, cook it for a few minutes 
over very high heat until well browned on both sides — as the initial step in 
the cooking process. However, bigger pieces of meat, like a thick roast or a 
2-inch-thick steak may benefit from searing first, followed by cooking slowly 
over lower heat. For these bigger cuts, sear them, but don’t cook long enough 
to blacken the exterior.
Doneness is a matter of taste, but remember that even the finest prime beef 
has little taste or texture left if you cook it beyond medium. The National 
Cattlemen’s Beef Association defines the approximate degree of doneness in 
beef as the following:
 
✓ Very rare: 130 degrees
 
✓ Rare: 140 degrees
 
✓ Medium-rare: 145 degrees
✓ Medium: 160 degrees
✓ Well-done: 170 degrees
✓ Very well-done: 180 degrees
These temperature guidelines are helpful when you’re using a meat thermom-
eter to take the guesswork out of cooking large roasts, but for steaks and 
smaller cuts, doneness is defined by the meat’s interior color. Rare meat is 
bright red and juicy. Medium meat has a light pink center with light brown 
edges. Well-done meat is brown-gray throughout.
The intensity of the heat of gas and charcoal grills varies. Keep in mind that 
the cooking times throughout this chapter are only estimates. Check the inte-
rior of the meat by making a small cut with a sharp knife a few minutes before 
the estimated time of doneness, to avoid overcooking. Unfortunately, after a 
piece of beef is overcooked, you can’t reverse the results.

We’re squarely in the camp of those who insist that allowing grilled meat to 
stand a few minutes before carving makes for a better steak. The juices inside 
stabilize and redistribute throughout the meat, and the meat will cook a bit 
more.

Grilled Steak 101
Compared to the more expensive rib-eye or porterhouse, a sirloin steak gives you lots 
of flavor for the money. It provides more versatility, too, because it’s also perfect for 
cutting into kebab cubes. (See Chapter 8 for steak kebab recipes.)
This recipe features the flavor of a simply grilled sirloin and relies on only a little garlic, 
olive oil, and salt and pepper as seasoning. However, if you care to embellish a little, 
turn to Chapters 5 and 6 for an assortment of flavored oils, seasoned rubs, sauces, and 
compound butter recipes.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Grilling time: 15 minutes for medium-rare
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
2 boneless sirloin beef steaks, cut 1-inch thick 
(about 2 pounds total)
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 In a small bowl, combine the olive oil and garlic. Generously rub or brush the flavored 
oil on both sides of the steaks. Sprinkle the steaks lightly with salt and pepper.
 3 Place the steaks on a well-oiled grill grid, directly over medium heat. Grill, uncovered, 
14 to 16 minutes for medium-rare to medium doneness, turning every 5 minutes.
 4 Remove the steaks from the grill; cover loosely with foil and let the steaks rest for a few 
minutes before thinly slicing across the grain. Season with salt and additional pepper (if 
desired) before serving.
Go-With: Serve with any of the side dishes in Chapter 16; with the Tapenade, Tomato 
Chutney, or Guacamole that are shown in Chapter 6; or with any of the compound butters 
in Chapter 6. You can also top with the Pesto Sauce in Chapter 15.
Vary It! You can substitute porterhouse steaks, cut 1-inch thick and totaling about 2 
pounds, for the sirloin steaks.

Chuck Steaks Marinated in Red Wine
If you’re looking for a way to turn inexpensive chuck shoulder steaks into a very tasty 
grilled dinner, try this recipe. For other steak marinade recipes, which are also good 
with tougher steaks, flip to Chapter 5.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 8 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 15 minutes for medium-rare
Yield: 4 servings
2 boneless beef chuck shoulder steaks, cut 
about 1-inch thick (about 1
1⁄2 to 2 pounds)
1 cup dry red wine
1⁄2 cup chopped onions
3 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄2 to 1 large jalapeño pepper, seeded and 
minced (optional)
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Pepper to taste
 1 Place the steaks in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow nonreactive dish.
 2 In a small mixing bowl, prepare the marinade by whisking together the remaining 
ingredients.
 3 Pour the marinade over the steaks in the bag or dish, turning to coat. Cover the dish or 
close the bag securely, pressing out any air, and then refrigerate for 8 hours or over-
night, turning occasionally.
 4 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 5 Remove the steaks from the marinade, discarding the marinade. If desired, sprinkle with 
additional salt and pepper to taste. Place the steaks on an oiled grill grid, directly over 
the heat.
 6 Grill, uncovered, 14 to 16 minutes for medium-rare to medium, or until desired done-
ness, turning every 7 to 8 minutes. (Check for doneness by making a small cut into the 
center of the meat with a sharp knife. For best results, less-tender steaks should be 
cooked from medium-rare to medium.) Carve into thin slices across the grain.
Go-With: Serve with the Garlic-Grilled Portobellos or with any of the other side dishes in 
Chapter 16.
Vary It! Flank and top round cuts also work well with this red-wine marinade. A flank 
steak about 1
1⁄2 to 2 pounds will cook to medium-rare or medium in 17 to 21 minutes, 
depending on thickness. One beef top round steak (1-inch thick) takes 16 to 18 minutes for 
medium-rare to medium doneness.

193
 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
Cook any type of beefsteak according to your personal preference, but 
remember that overcooking tightens and toughens muscle. The longer 
a steak is cooked, the less juicy it becomes. Cooking to medium-rare or 
medium gives you the most tender steaks.
 
If you intend to use a marinade as a basting or dipping sauce, pour off and 
reserve a small portion before adding the uncooked meat. Otherwise, any 
marinade that has previously come in contact with raw meat, fish, or poultry 
must be brought to a full rolling boil and then simmered for about 15 minutes 
before it can be used as a finishing sauce.

 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
Giving Grilled Beef Roast a Chance
Grilled beef roast is a wondrous thing. It takes on a lovely smokiness that 
you can’t get when you cook it in an oven, and if turned carefully on a spit, it 
reproduces the most primal of all cooking processes. Even though you won’t 
have the wonderful aroma wafting through the house or enjoy the promise of 
Yorkshire pudding made with the pan drippings, you may never want to cook 
roast beef in your oven again after you try it on the grill.
The following is a short list of beef roasts that we recommend for grilling:
 
✓ Tenderloin: This most elegant piece of meat is so perfectly suited to 
grilling that our mouths water just thinking about it. A tenderloin is also 
one of the most expensive meats in the supermarket, so you want to grill 
it perfectly. The first rule when grilling a tenderloin is to remove it from 
the grill 5 to 10 degrees shy of the final, desired internal temperature. 
The internal temperature of a roast will increase 5 to 10 degrees after 
it has been removed from the grill and allowed to rest for 15 minutes 
under a tent of foil. For rare meat, remove the roast when the tempera-
ture is between 130 and 135 degrees; for medium-rare, remove between 
135 and 140 degrees; for medium, remove when the internal temperature 
is between 145 and 150 degrees.
 
 The second cardinal rule when roasting a tenderloin is to be sure that 
the roast is evenly thick from end to end to ensure even cooking. A ten-
derloin has a thin and a thick end. Often the butcher tucks and ties the 
thin end underneath the roast to make it uniformly thick. However, to 
ensure even cooking, it’s better to have the thin tail end cut off rather 
than tied. (If we’ve piqued your interest, check out the recipe for Grilled 
Tenderloin Au Poivre with Herb Butter Sauce, later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Rib-eye roast: This is a very tender, boneless roast that readily absorbs 
the strong, smoky flavors of a live charcoal fire. With the bone in, this 
cut is called a prime rib-eye roast. Cook the boneless roast indirectly in a 
covered grill, over medium-low heat, for 15 to 20 minutes per pound.
 
✓ Beef round tip roast: Sometimes called sirloin tip, this economical cut 
comes boneless. It’s packed with flavor and really is quite tender if 
cooked to medium-rare (about 135 degrees). Cook indirectly in a cov-
ered grill, over medium-low heat, for about 20 minutes per pound. This 
roast may also be rotisserie-grilled.
 
✓ Tri-tip roast: One of California’s best kept secrets for years, the tri-tip 
roast can now be purchased in supermarkets and meat markets coast 
to coast. This relatively small, thin roast with its distinctive triangular 
shape weighs a maximum of 2 pounds. It cooks over direct medium heat 
in approximately 30 minutes. For tri-tip steaks, cut the raw steak across 
the grain into 1-inch-thick steaks, beginning at the long, flat end of the 
roast. A 2-pound raw roast slices into 4 to 5 steaks, with some meat 
remaining for kebabs or stir-frying.

196
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 
✓ Boneless chuck roast: Perhaps the most economical of meats, the 
boneless chuck roast comes from the shoulder and weighs about 3 to 4 
pounds. Because it isn’t a very tender cut, marinate the roast for a long 
time, about 8 to 24 hours, before grilling. Grill it indirectly, covered, over 
medium-low coals, for about 25 minutes per pound for rare to medium-
rare. Then slice it thinly across the grain.
 
✓ Brisket: A brisket needs several hours of long, slow, indirect cooking or 
water-smoking to tenderize its tough muscle tissue. After it’s barbecued, 
the meat is usually sliced across the grain and is smothered in a thick, 
rich, tomato-based barbecue sauce.
Accompany any of these roasts with baking potatoes (like Idaho potatoes). 
Put them on the grid about 1 hour before the roast is done. (See Chapter 16 
for more information on grilling potatoes.)
 
Grilled Tenderloin Au Poivre with 
 
Herb Butter Sauce
Beef lovers, after trying this recipe, you may never again roast a tenderloin in your 
oven. The smoke and heat of a covered charcoal grill cook this tender piece of meat 
beyond compare.
Poivre is French for pepper, and a red wine marinade and cracked peppercorns infuse 
this beef tenderloin with flavor and just the right touch of stimulating spice. (Turn to 
Chapter 14 for information on how to crack peppercorns.) For you pepper fans out 
there, about a tablespoon of pepper produces a roast that’s quite peppery; use 
1⁄2 table-
spoon or less if you want only a hint of heat. Grilling the tenderloin directly over 
medium coals and giving it a quarter turn every 5 minutes cooks it evenly and quickly, 
without any unpleasant charring. For best results, be sure to use at least a 2-pound 
tenderloin.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 2 hours
Grilling time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1⁄2 cup dry red wine
3 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon coarse-grained mustard
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 large shallot, peeled and minced, or 2 
tablespoons minced onion
1 teaspoon dried oregano or thyme leaves, 
crumbled
1⁄4 teaspoon salt
1⁄2 to 1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, 
cracked (optional)
1 beef tenderloin, 2 to 2
1⁄2 pounds, trimmed
Herb Butter Sauce (optional) (see following 
recipe)

 Chapter 11: Beef: It’s What Grills Were Made For
 1 In a small bowl or large glass measuring cup, prepare the marinade by combining the 
first 7 ingredients. Place the meat in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow nonreac-
tive dish. Pour the marinade over the meat, turning to coat. Cover the dish or seal the 
bag (pressing out all the air). Refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours, turning occasionally to coat 
the meat in the marinade.
 2 Remove the meat from the dish or bag; discard the marinade. Spread the cracked 
pepper evenly onto all sides of the meat, pressing it into the surface with the palm of 
your hand. Cover loosely with foil or plastic wrap and allow the meat to warm slightly 
before grilling. The meat will grill evenly when brought to room temperature, which 
takes about 35 minutes, depending on the air temperature.
 3 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal grill, using wood chunks (if desired).
 4 Place the tenderloin in the center of a well-oiled grid, directly over the heat. Cover and 
grill for 5 minutes; give the roast a quarter turn and grill for another 5 minutes. Proceed, 
grilling covered and turning every 5 minutes, until the roast reaches an internal temper-
ature of between 135 degrees and 140 degrees for medium-rare. Check the temperature 
with an instant-read thermometer after 15 minutes and then each time you turn the 
roast.
 5 Remove the roast from the grill and place on a carving board (preferably one that col-
lects the juices); cover the roast loosely with foil and allow it to stand for 10 to 15 min-
utes. Carve into 
1⁄2-inch-thick slices. Serve with Herb Butter Sauce (if desired).
Herb Butter Sauce
 
 In a small pan, melt 
1⁄4 cup butter; stir in 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce and 2 table-
spoons chopped fresh parsley. Pour over tenderloin slices.
Go-With: Suggested side dishes include Garlic-Grilled Portobellos or any of the other side 
dishes in Chapter 16.
Vary It! If you’re lucky to have any leftovers, use them to make tenderloin sandwiches the 
next day, spreading the slices of bread with chutney or mustard.

The internal temperature of a roast rises most rapidly at the end of the esti-
mated cooking time. So check the temperature often toward the end of grilling 
to avoid overcooking the meat.

For a hunk of tenderloin that’s even more flavorful, mix in a few pieces of hard-
wood hickory chunks with your charcoal. Keep in mind, however, that wood 
chunks burn hotter than charcoal. Light the chunks before lighting the char-
coal to give them more time to burn to a medium stage. If the chunks are still 
too hot and the charcoal is ready, spritz the chunks with a little water or move 
them to the outer edges of the coals, where they will add smoke to the food 
without flaming and burning the meat.

n this chapter, we help you choose the best 
cuts of pork for the grill and show you how to 
season them to your liking. We also make sure 
that you don’t mistreat that beautiful piece of 
pork and cook it until it’s a dried-out, gray wad — 
in the past, too many people thought this was the 
correct way to cook it! By the time you finish this 
chapter, you may be convinced that pork is actually 
one of the most delicious and delicate meats you 
can put over a fire.
Hit Me with Your Best Cut
Many people avoid eating pork because they think it’s a fatty meat. If they’re 
talking hot dogs and sausages (covered in Chapter 7) or spareribs (in 
Chapter 9), they’re right. But pork taken from the loin and leg isn’t particularly 
fatty. The better-tasting pork, however, is fattier. The fat adds a great deal of 
flavor, especially for barbecue. Very lean ribs, on the other hand, will wither 
away on the grill and not provide the kind of taste that fattier ribs will.
The main characteristic to look for in a cut of pork is a firm, finely-grained 
meat. Check to see that the lean part of the meat has a healthy pink color and 
that the fat is firm and white, not yellow.
 
By the way, the iridescence that you sometimes see on the surface of pork is 
perfectly natural and in no way affects the flavor or quality of the pork. It’s 
simply a reflection of light off the cut ends of muscle fibers.

The meat industry produces a dizzying array of cuts, but only a few — usually 
the choicest parts — show up at the butcher shop or supermarket. See Figure 
12-1 for a survey of the many cuts available. You’ll most likely find the following 
cuts at your local meat market or grocery store:
 
✓ Leg: The rear leg is one of the most tender and succulent cuts of pork. 
The meat from this portion of the animal, which can weigh 15 pounds, 
basically consists of two delicious parts: the butt and the shank. It’s often 
cut by the butcher into several boneless roasts. A roast from the rear 
leg may be called a fresh ham or a boneless fresh ham roast. The butt 
must be cooked slowly for a long time to achieve tenderness; the shank, 
which isn’t as large or meaty, takes less time.
 
✓ Loin: The loin is next in line to the leg in terms of tenderness, and it’s 
available either with or without the bone. From the loin you also get the 
best, meatiest ribs (we cover ribs in detail in Chapter 9). The leg and 
the loin are delicious prepared in any number of ways — from chops 
(covered in the section “Chop, chop who’s there?”) to kebabs (included 
in Chapter 8) — on the outdoor grill.
 
✓ Shoulder: The shoulder has two principal cuts:
 
• Boston butt: This cut weighs up to 6 pounds and is fatty but juicy. 
You’ll find this cut delicious for steaks or cooked whole. It’s also 
the best sausage meat. (We give you the scoop on sausages in 
Chapter 7.)
 
• Picnic ham: This cut is farther down the shoulder — toward the 
leg — and is less tender than the Boston butt. The picnic ham is 
inexpensive and best cut into steaks or used as chunks for stews.
Undercooked pork: Don’t believe 
everything you hear
The long-held fear people have about eating 
“undercooked” pork is based on outdated 
information that says hogs can possibly carry 
trichinosis, a parasite that can be transferred to 
human beings through consumption of tainted 
meat. Today, however, the standards of pig pro-
duction are so controlled and so sanitary that 
the chances of a hog carrying trichinosis are 
next to zero. In fact, of the less than 50 reported 
cases per year in the U.S. of trichinosis in 
humans, almost all were contracted from eating 
wild game, not pork. To find out how to cook 
pork properly, see the section in this chapter 
“And This Little Pork was Done Just Right.”

201
 Chapter 12: Pork — The King of Barbecue
All three massive pork roasts — the Boston butt, the picnic ham, and the 
fresh ham (from the rear leg) — can be turned into delicious barbecued 
dishes. However, the Boston butt, with its high proportion of fat, is prized 
most by pitmasters because it remains juicy and succulent during the long, 
slow barbecuing process. To make a pulled pork sandwich, the classic barbe-
cued dish, the Boston butt is cooked for hours and then pulled apart or torn 
into thin strips, tossed with barbecue sauce, and served on white bread or 
hamburger buns.

Hog wild!
Wild pigs, called peccaries or javelinas, came 
to North America across the Bering Straits 
during the Stone Age, but domesticated pigs 
only arrived when Spanish explorer Hernando 
de Soto brought 13 of them to Tampa, Florida, 
in 1539. All the domesticated pigs in the United 
States have been bred from this small herd.

Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
Here’s the Rub: Flavoring Pork 
with Herbs and Spices
Grilled foods don’t produce the drippings that you get when you cook 
indoors. When you sauté, pan-fry, roast, or bake foods, the pan drippings 
(the browned bits left in the cooking pan) provide you with the start of an 
exquisite sauce to add flavor to your foods. When you grill foods, however, 
the raw sauce materials drip, splatter, and waste away into the hot coals. 
That’s why the marinades and rubs in this chapter are important for imparting 
flavor on grilled foods.
Many international spice and seasoning combinations work well with pork. 
Here are some of our favorites, both in rub and marinade form:
 
✓ French Provençal rubs: Combine dried, crushed herbs like rosemary, 
thyme, bay leaves, salt, and black pepper.
 
✓ Asian spice rubs: Combine anise seeds, cinnamon, ground cloves, 
ground ginger, and red pepper flakes.
 
✓ West Indian and Jamaican rubs: Combine cayenne, paprika, and hot 
peppers with the sweet complementary tastes of allspice, cinnamon, 
ginger, and dark brown sugar.
 
✓ Greek-style marinade: Combine olive oil, fresh lemon juice, oregano, 
garlic, salt, and pepper.
 
If you marinate your pork, use a resealable, plastic bag. That way you can 
discard the bag after the food is marinated, saving you a dish to wash. But 
more important, the bag allows more of the food to come into direct contact 
with the marinade. A dish, bowl, or pan has to be exactly the right shape and 
size for the marinade to cover the food. A bag, however, can be pressed to 
conform to the exact shape of the food. Be sure to press all the air out of the 
bag, and close it tightly to prevent leaking.
And This Little Pork Was Done Just Right
Grilling pork can be tricky business, and it takes some practice to get the 
timing just right. Depending on the thickness of the cut and the amount of 
fat, muscle, bone, and grain of the meat, the cooking time for pork can vary 
considerably. Final cooking time also depends on the heat of the fire and the 
distance the grill grid is placed from the heat.

203
 Chapter 12: Pork — The King of Barbecue
Our grandmothers used to disregard timing and simply cook pork to an 
internal temperature of 185 degrees, believing that to cook it less would 
subject the family to trichinosis. But we now know that trichinae are killed at 
135 degrees. So, cooking pork to 155 or 160 degrees is considered safe, and 
it yields a much juicier piece of meat. Today’s pork is leaner than the pork of 
our grandparents’ day, with far less fat, so cooking it to 185 degrees results in 
a tough, dry chop or roast. So hover over pork as it grills.

One way to check the doneness of a piece of pork is by using a meat 
thermometer (discussed in Chapter 2). The other way is to cut into the meat 
(while it’s still on the grill) near the bone when you’re close to the end of the 
estimated cooking time. You’ll know the meat is cooked when its juices run 
clear and the meat is no longer pink near the bone. If the meat is boneless, this 
will take only a little less time — cut into the thickest part of the meat to check 
for doneness.
 
If you insist on grilling your pork until it’s well done (just because you like it 
that way!), you may still see some red areas in the meat, especially near the 
outer edges. Not to worry: In braising, this color comes from naturally occurring 
nitrites and nitrates (not additives); in grilling, the presence of exhaust gases 
from your grill may cause this red color. It’s all perfectly natural.
In the end, you’re trying to produce a fully-cooked, moist and juicy piece of 
meat that has a slight give in the center so that when you push gently with 
your finger or the tip of a spatula, the meat springs back. It’s an art — the best 
results come with practice. Consider these tips as you hone your handiwork:
 
✓ If the meat is cooking too fast, turn it over or move it to a cooler spot 
on the grill.
 
✓ If the meat is cooking too slowly or if the coals are losing heat too 
quickly, cover the grill to increase the heat. (It isn’t necessary to sear a 
chop or other piece of pork like you do a thick roast or lamb.)
So far, even the grilling experts haven’t been able to decide whether you 
should cover the grill when cooking pork. Our advice: Do what makes you 
happy. We tested pork both with and without the grill cover, and each tech-
nique has its rewards and shortcomings. For example, covering the grill elimi-
nates the problem of unevenly cooked meat and produces a smokier flavor 
than when you leave the grill uncovered — an absolute advantage if you’re 
using wood chips or chunks. However, grilling with a cover also cranks up 
the grill’s heat and can overcook or even burn the meat, especially if they’re 
marinated with sweet ingredients.

204
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
After you decide whether you’ll use a covered grill, keep the following 
general guidelines in mind:
 
✓ If you choose to cover the grill, we recommend using moderate or 
medium heat and cooking 1-inch chops for about 5 minutes per side. 
But check them before this estimated time and remove them sooner, 
if necessary; covering requires close monitoring. Other pork cuts may 
take more time.
 
✓ If you grill without a cover, you risk ending up with unevenly cooked 
meat, especially near the bone where it takes longer to cook. If you grill 
without the cover, increase the heat to medium-hot and grill for 5 to 6 
minutes a side. Other cuts of pork may take more time.

Whether you cover the grill or not, move the meat around on the grill, to 
cooler or hotter spots, to keep it from burning and to ensure even cooking. If 
you’re grilling with glazes or sauces that contain any sweet ingredients like 
sugar or honey, brush them onto the meat during the last few minutes of grill-
ing to keep the meat from burning.
Chop, chop, who’s there?
Even those who aren’t particularly keen on roast pork or ribs are often 
delighted by the prospect of a nice, thick, juicy pork chop with trimmings like 
applesauce and sauerkraut. And grilling is one of the tastiest ways to cook 
pork chops, which are especially delicious marinated, rubbed, or glazed, or 
simply seasoned with a dusting of salt and pepper.

Pork chops for the grill should be cut about 1-inch thick for best results. This 
thickness allows the chop to develop a nice exterior crust without drying out. 
In any recipe that calls for a pork chop, you can use a chop with or without a 
bone — but we find a lot more flavor in a chop with its bone intact.

Whenever you’re grilling a relatively thin piece of meat — such as a chop — 
with the grill cover down, you lose some control over the grilling process 
because you can’t see whether the food is cooking too fast or not fast enough. 
Remove the lid of the grill to check on how each chop is cooking before the 
chop is ready to be turned; make adjustments, if necessary, by moving, the 
chops to cooler or hotter spots.

Lemony Tarragon Pork Chops
Citrus juices are natural meat tenderizers, and lemon, orange, and lime are especially 
wonderful with pork. Tart, tantalizing lemon juice is the principal flavor in this recipe. 
You can use the Lemony Tarragon Marinade to marinate pork chops, pork roasts, or 
kebabs.
Even a few hours of marinating can make a difference in the flavor of a pork chop. The 
length of time needed to marinate pork can vary from 15 minutes (for extremely tender 
pieces of meat) to 24 hours (for tougher pieces). Be sure to marinate in the fridge.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 12 to 24 hours
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2⁄3 cup olive oil
1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon or 
sage, or 2 teaspoons dried
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel (from about 1 
lemon)
1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄4 white pepper, or more to taste
Black pepper to taste
4 pork loin chops, each about 1-inch thick 
(about 2 pounds total)
 1 To prepare the marinade, combine all the ingredients except the pork chops in a large, 
shallow, nonreactive baking dish or a large, resealable plastic bag. Stir until well 
blended.
 2 Trim all but 
1⁄4 inch of the fat from the edges of the chops. Add the trimmed chops to the 
marinade. Cover the dish or seal the bag (after squeezing out all the air) and refrigerate 
for 12 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
 3 Prepare a medium fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove chops from the marinade, discarding the remaining marinade. Place chops on a 
lightly oiled grill grid.
 5 Cover and grill the chops with the vents open for about 10 minutes or until done, turn-
ing once. Cut near the bone to determine doneness. Chops are done when the meat is 
browned on the outside, with a slight pink blush in the center, and no longer pink near 
the bone.
Go-With: If desired, serve with Black Bean and Red Pepper Salsa (Chapter 6).
Vary It! Punch up the flavor of these chops by adding Dijon-style mustard, red pepper 
flakes, Tabasco sauce, or other fresh herbs like basil, parsley, or rosemary.

Grilled Pork Chops with Rosemary Oil
In this grilled chop recipe, the marinade is actually a flavored oil, deliciously seasoned 
with a little honey, balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, grated orange peel, and rose-
mary. Grilling any kind of chop on fresh herb sprigs, as we suggest here, adds another 
dimension of flavor. However, be sure that the sprigs are lightly oiled before placing 
them on the grill. (Note: There have been safety concerns about flavored oil turning 
rancid or developing bacteria, so if you make one, be sure to use it right away and keep 
it refrigerated after making it until you’re ready to use it.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 12 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
6 tablespoons olive oil
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary, or 1 
teaspoon dried
1 tablespoon grated orange peel (from 1 large 
navel orange)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
Pepper to taste
4 pork loin chops, cut 1-inch thick (about 2 
pounds total)
4 3- to 4-inch long sprigs fresh rosemary, 
brushed with oil (optional)
 1 Combine the first 9 ingredients in a large, shallow, nonreactive baking dish or reseal-
able plastic bag. Trim all but 
1⁄4 inch of fat from the edges of each chop. Place the chops 
in the dish or bag, turning the chops to coat all sides. Refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours, 
turning two or three times. (The longer you marinate, the better the flavor.)
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Remove the chops from the marinade, shaking off a bit of the excess; discard the 
remaining marinade.
 4 Place the chops on the oiled grill grid, directly above the heat. Place a rosemary sprig 
on the top of each chop (if desired). Cover the grill and cook for 5 minutes. Turn the 
chops so that the rosemary sits under them. Grill the chops, covered, for another 5 min-
utes or until the meat is browned on the outside with a slight blush of pink in the center 
and no sign of pink near the bone. Cut to determine doneness. If desired, season with 
salt and additional pepper before serving.

Apricot-Glazed Pork Chops
In this recipe, apricot jam is mixed with cider vinegar, soy sauce, fresh ginger, garlic, 
and cayenne pepper for a sweet and spicy glaze.
Thick, sweet glazes that are laced with honey, brown sugar, jam, molasses, and other 
sweeteners all work well with chops and ribs. But remember that the sugar content 
means the glaze must be applied only during the last 5 minutes of cooking; otherwise, 
the glaze may burn and you may taste char instead of chop.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup apricot jam
3 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce
2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste
4 loin pork chops, cut 1-inch thick (about 2 
pounds total)
Oil for brushing chops
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the jam and the vinegar. Cook, stirring over 
low heat, until the jam melts. Stir in the soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and cayenne pepper. 
Remove from the heat and set the glaze aside.
 3 Trim all but 
1⁄4 inch of fat from each pork chop. Brush the chops lightly with oil; sprinkle 
with salt and pepper.
 4 Place the chops on a well-oiled grill grid. Grill the chops for 3 minutes on each side. 
Brush both sides generously with the glaze and grill for another 4 to 5 minutes or until 
done, turning once. Cut to determine doneness. The chops are cooked when the meat 
has a light pink blush and there’s no sign of pink near the bone. If desired, simmer the 
remaining glaze for 2 to 3 minutes and then drizzle over the grilled chops before 
serving.
Vary It! Just about any fruit-flavored sweet chutney, marmalade, or jam (such as plum, 
apple, pineapple, or orange) works as a quick glaze for pork chops. You can reduce its 
thickness and sweetness by mixing with a little water or lemon or lime juice.

Caribbean Pork Chops
In this recipe, pineapple juice gives the meat and bones of these chops a taste and 
crispness that’s reminiscent of slow-cooked pork ribs. Pineapple juice is also a natural 
tenderizer due to the presence of the enzyme papain. Use this marinade for other cuts 
of pork, adding some cayenne pepper to spice it up, if you wish.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 12 to 24 hours
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup unsweetened pineapple juice
1⁄4 cup honey
1⁄4 cup cider vinegar
1 tablespoon peeled and coarsely chopped 
fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, peeled
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and coarsely 
chopped
1⁄4 teaspoon ground allspice
4 loin pork chops, cut 1-inch thick (about 2 
pounds total)
Salt and black pepper to taste
 1 In a blender, blend at high speed all the ingredients, except the pork chops and the salt 
and pepper, for about 4 seconds, to make a coarse marinade.
 2 Trim all but 
1⁄4 inch of fat from each chop. Place the chops in a resealable plastic bag 
or a large, shallow, nonreactive baking dish; pour the marinade over the chops and 
refrigerate them for 12 to 24 hours, turning two or three times.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chops from the marinade, shaking off most of the excess; discard the 
remaining marinade. Season the chops lightly with salt and pepper. Place the chops on 
a well-oiled grill grid and cook them, uncovered, for 5 to 6 minutes per side, turning 
once. Cut the chops to determine doneness. They’re done when the meat has a light 
pink blush and there’s no sign of pink near the bone.

Brine ’n dine
Brine is a solution of water and salt that deeply marinates food. It’s an easy 
way to add flavor and moisture to large pieces of meat. The most famous 
brined dish — corned beef — is soaked in brine and then rinsed before it’s 
finally boiled with cabbage and other vegetables.

Brined and Grilled Loin O’ Pork
In this recipe, a boneless pork loin roast is placed in a brine solution of water, sugar, 
salt, and seasonings for 2 days before it’s cooked indirectly in a covered grill. The result 
is a deliciously tender and perfectly moist piece of pork. This is a great company dish, 
and it’s one of our favorite recipes.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 2 to 3 days
Grilling time: 50 to 70 minutes
Yield: 8 servings
8 cups water
1⁄2 cup sugar
1⁄3 cup kosher salt
3 tablespoons fennel seed
2 bay leaves
2 tablespoons grated orange peel (from about 
2 large navel oranges)
3 whole cloves
2 teaspoons black peppercorns
4-pound boneless pork loin roast tied by a 
butcher
Applesauce (optional)
 1 To make the brine, combine all the ingredients, except the pork loin roast and apple-
sauce, in a medium saucepan. Cover and bring to a boil over high heat. Remove from 
heat and let cool.
 2 Place the pork loin in a 2-gallon, heavy-duty plastic bag and then put the bag in a 9-x-13-
inch baking pan (or other large rectangular pan). Pour the cooled brine over the roast 
and seal the bag tightly, pressing out any air. Turn the bag to coat the roast with the 
brine and refrigerate for 2 days, turning the bag over occasionally.
 3 Prepare an indirect, medium-hot fire in a covered grill (use 55 to 60 briquettes for a 
charcoal fire), with a drip pan that’s half-filled with water. If desired, use presoaked 
wood chips or chunks. To maintain the temperature, be sure to add fresh briquettes to 
the fire about every 30 minutes. (For more instructions on building an indirect fire, see 
Chapter 1.)
 4 Remove the loin from the brine, discarding the remaining brine; allow the loin to stand 
at room temperature until the grill is ready. Place the loin on the oiled grill grid directly 
above the drip pan and opposite the heat.
 5 Cover the grill and cook over indirect heat, turning once, for about 15 minutes per 
pound or until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast reads 155 
degrees (about 50 to 70 minutes). The exact grilling time depends on the intensity of the 
grill’s heat and the thickness of the roast. If necessary, be sure to adjust the grill vents 
to maintain a medium-hot temperature.
 6 Remove the roast from the grill, cover it with foil, and let it rest for about 15 minutes. 
(The internal temperature will rise to 160 degrees.)

Tenderloin is the night
A pork tenderloin is a boneless, extremely tender piece of meat from the loin of 
the pig. It weighs only about 1 pound and is often sold in the supermarket meat 
case wrapped two to a package. Tenderloins can be rubbed or marinated with 
any number of seasonings and then cooked indirectly or directly. However, the 
indirect cooking method (see Chapter 1) assures that the meat will be moist, 
tender, browned, and cooked through (not charred!) in 20 to 30 minutes.
 
A pork tenderloin is completely cooked when the interior of the meat reaches 
a temperature of 160 degrees. However, you should remove the tenderloin 
from the grill when the thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the 
roast reaches 155 degrees. Let the tenderloin stand, loosely covered with foil, 
for 10 minutes before slicing. While the meat rests, the internal temperature 
will continue to rise, and the juices will settle into the meat, making it easier to 
carve. Be sure to pour any of the flavorful juices that run out of the roast after 
it’s carved over the slices.

The heat of a gas grill usually isn’t as intense as that of a charcoal fire, so for 
most recipes in this book, we cover those differences by giving you approxi-
mate cooking times. However, pork tenderloins may take as much as 15 min-
utes longer to cook indirectly on gas grills than on charcoal kettle grills. Here’s 
what we advise if you’re cooking pork tenderloins on a gas grill:
 
1. Preheat the grill with both burners on high.
 
2. After the grill is hot, turn one burner off and set the other to 
medium-hot.
 
3. Cook the tenderloins, indirectly, for 25 to 40 minutes or until done, 
turning once or twice.
 
 If after 40 minutes the tenderloins aren’t cooked, reduce the heat to 
medium, move them directly over the heat, and continue to cook until 
done.
When you turn the tenderloins over midway into grilling, also switch their 
positions by placing the tenderloin farthest from the coals closest to the heat.

Curried Pork Tenderloins
Coating the surface of a pork tenderloin with a mixture of herbs and spices is by far the 
simplest way to season this cut of meat. Slice the grilled meat about 
1⁄2-inch thick and 
arrange the slices on a large platter.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
Grilling time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
1 teaspoon light brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon curry powder
1⁄2 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
1⁄2 teaspoon garlic salt
Pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste
Black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 pork tenderloins, about 
3⁄4 to 1 pound each
 1 Place the tenderloins in a large shallow baking dish. (If necessary, use kitchen twine to 
fold and tie the thin end of each tenderloin under the meat to give it uniform thickness 
and allow it to cook evenly.)
 2 Rub each loin with the olive oil. Blend the brown sugar, curry powder, cumin, ginger, 
garlic salt, cayenne pepper, and black pepper in a small bowl; rub the spice mixture 
evenly over each pork tenderloin. Wrap the pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 
30 minutes to 2 hours.
 3 Build an indirect, medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill. (Use about 50 bri-
quettes if the fire is charcoal.) You don’t need to place a drip pan under the pork. (See 
Chapter 1 for complete instructions on indirect grilling.)
 4 Place the tenderloins on an oiled grid, opposite the heat. Cover and grill for 10 minutes. 
Turn, cover, and grill for 10 to 15 minutes more (maybe longer for a gas grill) or until a 
meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the roast (not the folded part) reg-
isters 155 degrees.
 5 Let the roast stand for about 10 minutes, covered with foil, before slicing across the 
grain. The sliced meat should have a hint of pink.
Vary It! You can tone down or crank up the spice in this tenderloin recipe by adjusting the 
amount of cayenne and black pepper to suit your taste. Any leftovers can be served the 
next day as delicious grilled pork sandwiches. Lay the meat between dark bread slices and 
garnish with a fruit chutney or pickled watermelon rind.
Go-With: Serve with Creamy Asian Peanut Sauce, Tomato Chutney, or Summer Squash 
Chutney (all in Chapter 6), or any of the grilled vegetables in Chapter 16.

Soy-Marinated Pork Tenderloin with 
 
Asian-Flavored Vegetables
In this recipe, you heat the soy marinade and serve it as a finishing sauce for the grilled 
tenderloin slices and a colorful side dish of steamed carrots, red pepper, zucchini, and 
broccoli.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
Tenderloins
2 pork tenderloins, about 
3⁄4 to 1 pound each
6 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped
1⁄4 cup light brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons sesame oil
3 tablespoons water
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons ground ginger
1⁄2 teaspoon black pepper
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
 1 If necessary, use kitchen twine to fold and tie the thin end of each tenderloin under the 
meat to give it uniform thickness and allow it to cook evenly.
 2 Place the remaining ingredients in a large, plastic resealable bag or nonreactive dish; 
add the tenderloins to the bag or dish. Seal the bag, pressing out as much air as possi-
ble, or cover the dish with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or overnight, 
turning occasionally.
 3 Prepare an indirect, medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill. (Use about 50 
briquettes if the fire is made with charcoal.) You don’t need to place a drip pan under 
the pork. (Turn to Chapter 1 for complete instructions on building an indirect fire.)
 4 Remove the tenderloins from the marinade; pour the remaining marinade into a 
medium saucepan and reserve for making the Asian-flavored vegetables. Place the 
tenderloins on a lightly oiled grid, on the side opposite the coals or heat. Cover and 
grill for 10 to 15 minutes; turn, cover and grill for 10 to 15 minutes more or until a meat 
thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the tenderloin (but not the folded part) 
registers 155 degrees. The meat should have a hint of pink in the center.

213
 Chapter 12: Pork — The King of Barbecue
Asian-Flavored Vegetables
3 large carrots, trimmed and scraped
1 small red bell pepper
1 small zucchini or yellow squash, ends 
trimmed
2 cups broccoli florets
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1⁄4 cup cold water
1 teaspoon cornstarch
 1 While the grill preheats, quarter the carrots and then cut into 2-inch-long pieces. Core 
and seed the pepper; cut into 2-inch chunks. Cut the zucchini in half lengthwise and 
then into 
1⁄2-inch semicircle pieces. Place all cut vegetables in a bowl with the broccoli 
florets and set aside.
 2 While the tenderloins are grilling, bring 1 inch of water and the vegetable oil to a boil in 
a medium saucepan. Add the carrots, cover, and boil for about 3 minutes. Add the broc-
coli, and boil, covered, about 3 minutes. Add the red pepper and zucchini and boil, cov-
ered, for about 2 minutes more or until all the vegetables are crisp-tender. Drain 
immediately, cover, and set aside.
 3 In a small bowl, combine the 
1⁄4 cup cold water with the cornstarch, stirring to blend 
well. Bring the reserved marinade to a full rolling boil in a medium saucepan over 
medium-high heat. Add the cornstarch-water mixture and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stir-
ring constantly, until the sauce is slightly thickened and smooth.
 4 Add the boiled vegetables to the saucepan; stir gently to coat in the sauce. Remove 
from heat as soon as the vegetables are warmed through. Cover to keep warm.
 5 Remove the grilled tenderloins to a carving board and let stand 10 minutes, covered 
with foil. Slice thinly across the grain. Pour any juices that run out from the roast onto 
the carved slices. Arrange the tenderloin slices surrounded by the vegetables on a large 
platter. Spoon any remaining sauce over all and serve immediately.

Coriander and Fennel 
 
Rubbed Pork Tenderloin
Coriander and fennel add wonderful aromatic flavors to pork without overwhelming its 
essential taste, which is more delicate than beef or lamb. You can see the finished dish 
in the color insert.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 2 hours
Grilling time: 20–25 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds
3⁄4 teaspoon ground fennel seeds
1⁄4 teaspoon ground chili powder
1⁄2 teaspoon thyme
1
1⁄2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon olive oil
2
1⁄2 pounds pork tenderloin
 1 Combine the coriander and fennel seeds, chili powder, thyme, and salt in a bowl.
 2 Rub the loin of pork with the olive oil, and then rub the dry ingredients over the loin. 
Wrap the loin with plastic wrap, and then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 
hours. However, if you let the pork chill for 2 hours, we suggest you remove the meat 
from the refrigerator and let it warm up for 5 to 10 minutes before grilling.
 3 Build an indirect, medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill. (Use about 50 bri-
quettes if the fire is charcoal.) You don’t need to place a drip pan under the pork. (See 
Chapter 1 for complete instructions on indirect grilling.)
 4 Unwrap the pork from the plastic wrap and place on the grill opposite the direct heat. 
Cover and grill for 10 minutes. Turn, cover, and grill for 10 to 15 minutes more (maybe 
longer for a gas grill) or until meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the 
loin (not the folded part) registers 155 degrees. If you want your pork to be rarer, cook 
the loin to 140 degrees.
 5 Let the roast stand for about 10 minutes, covered with foil, before slicing across the 
grain. The sliced meat should have at least a hint of pink.

O
ften overlooked as an entrée for grilling, 
lamb is one of the most succulent meats

best to grill and discover that cooking lamb on the grill is a slightly different 
process than that used for beef. We feature recipes that represent the best of 
American barbecue-style lamb — and one Middle Eastern lamb recipe, too.
Lamb and Spice and Everything 
Nice: What You Need to Know
Lamb is defined as the meat of sheep less than 1 year old, usually slaughtered 
between 4 and 12 months. If the animal is more than a year old, it’s called 
mutton. Baby lamb is milk fed and slaughtered at about 6 weeks old. Spring 
lamb is also milk fed, but it goes to 4 months old. Lamb, which is traditionally 
served at Easter in many countries, is exceptionally flavorful — and fatty — 
and is best roasted to medium.

Surveying the cuts
Lamb comes in cutlets, loins, legs, rumps, racks, and several other cuts. It 
makes terrific ground meat dishes, sensational kebabs, and superb barbecue. 
After it’s trimmed, lamb tastes splendid when prepared with herbs like rose-
mary and garlic, a gloss of olive oil, a marinade of red wine, or a rub of Eastern 
spices like cumin, coriander, and cardamom. Figure 13-1 shows the principal 
cuts of lamb you can find in the American market. Here’s the rundown:
 
✓ Breast: The breast meat is good for braising, but the riblets make for 
good barbecue. The breast is excellent ground up for burgers as well.
 
✓ Leg: This cut may be the whole leg, center leg steaks, the boneless leg, 
the French-style leg, the shank half, or the butterflied leg, all of which 
do well on the grill. Plus, cubes from the leg make great kebabs (see 
Chapter 8).
 
✓ Loin: The loin includes the thick loin chops, loin roast, boneless loin 
roast, and medallions, all of which are best prepared either under the 
broiler or on the grill.
 
✓ Rack: The rack includes various smaller chops, such as rib chops and 
rack of lamb — which is delicious grilled.
 
✓ Shank: The shank is best for braising and stewing.
 
✓ Shoulder: The shoulder includes everything from shoulder chops to 
boneless shoulder roasts.
All these lamb cuts are now readily available in a supermarket.
 
When buying lamb, look for meat that’s bright red in color, which indicates 
freshness. Also make sure it has enough exterior fat — about 1/4 inch — to 
ensure succulence.
Looking for lamb by country 
of origin (yes, it matters!)
The finest lamb in the world is from the U.S. The very best of that is from 
Colorado, where it’s raised by cowboys, many of whom are of Basque origin. 
American lamb is well fatted, which gives it tremendous flavor, but it’s more 
costly than lamb from around the world.

217
 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
Even though U.S. lamb is the best, good lamb also is raised in England, 
Ireland, France, Italy, Greece, and Australia, and much of it can be found fresh 
in American markets. But through heavy government subsidies, New Zealand 
has nearly monopolized the export market with its lamb shipments, which 
are almost always frozen. Of good but not outstanding quality, New Zealand 
lamb is considerably cheaper than that from other countries.

When shopping for lamb, remember that the country of origin must, by law, 
be printed on the package.
Seasoning your lamb
Lamb chops, steaks, and kebabs can be basted or glazed with endless, imagi-
native sauces and marinades. (You can find out more about lamb kebabs in 
Chapter 8.) Here are some easy, classic recommendations from the American 
Lamb Council. Happily, you can assemble most of them from common 
kitchen and pantry ingredients. Each basting recipe is enough for four 
3⁄ 4-inch-thick leg steaks or chops. Brush the lamb on both sides before grilling 
over medium-hot heat for 5 to 7 minutes per side or until cooked as desired. 
For more flavor, marinate the chops for a few hours before grilling.
 
✓ Cracked Pepper: Combine 2 tablespoons red wine, l tablespoon cracked 
pepper, and 2 tablespoons olive oil.
 
✓ Curry: Combine 1⁄ 4 cup plain lowfat yogurt, l clove peeled and pressed 
garlic, and l teaspoon curry powder.
 
✓ Honey-Mustard Glaze: Combine 2 tablespoons each honey and pre-
pared mustard.
 
✓ Lemon Pepper: Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, l tablespoon finely 
minced onion, l tablespoon red wine vinegar, and 11⁄ 2 teaspoons lemon 
pepper.
 
✓ Polynesian: Combine 3 tablespoons apricot-pineapple jam, 1⁄ 2 teaspoon 
dry mustard, 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice, and 1⁄ 4 teaspoon garlic salt.
 
✓ Southwest: Combine 2 tablespoons olive oil, l clove peeled and pressed 
garlic, 1⁄ 4 teaspoon cumin, l tablespoon fresh lime juice, and 1⁄ 2 teaspoon 
dried leaf oregano.
 
✓ Teriyaki: Combine 2 tablespoons soy sauce, l tablespoon honey, l clove 
peeled and pressed garlic, l tablespoon dry sherry, l teaspoon sesame 
oil, and l teaspoon grated fresh ginger.
 
We recommend that you keep all meats, fish, and poultry refrigerated until 
you’re ready to grill. However, you’ll get a better initial sear, particularly with 
fatty meats like lamb, if the meat is near room temperature or very nearly so. 
Our advice is to remove the lamb from the refrigerator as you prepare the fire. 
By the time the grill is preheated, the meat will be close to room temperature 
without sustaining any effects from airborne bacteria. Don’t let meat, fish, or 
poultry stand at room temperature longer than 30 minutes.

 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
Grilling your lamb with TLC
Follow this advice when grilling lamb:
 
✓ Cook lamb chops over a medium-hot fire for best results.
 
✓ The heat of a charcoal grill is much more intense than the heat of a gas 
grill, resulting in shorter cooking times, especially when you’re using 
an indirect fire. Whatever your grill style, be sure to use a meat ther-
mometer to determine the doneness of lamb roasts. Depending on your 
desired degree of doneness, follow these guidelines:
 
• Grill to between 145 and 150 degrees for medium-rare.
 
• Grill to between 150 and 155 degrees for medium.
 
✓ The internal temperature increases more rapidly during the final min-
utes of cooking, so check the meat thermometer often during the final 
minutes.
 
✓ Before carving, let a lamb roast stand for 10 to 15 minutes after remov-
ing it from the heat. Doing so helps the meat settle down after all that 
fire. The juices will be more evenly distributed, and the meat will con-
tinue to cook slightly from internal heat. If you’re carving the meat and 
think that it needs a little more cooking, simply place it back on the grid 
for a few minutes.
 
Lamb, by its very nature, has a good degree of fat — certainly more than 
beef — so you have to watch carefully for flare-ups. A good way to avoid flare-
ups is to trim unnecessary fat to about 1⁄ 4 inch of the bone or flesh. However, 
remember that even grilling trimmed lamb can cause flare-ups. Keep a water 
bottle handy to douse any flames, and move the chops around to cooler spots 
from time to time. Covering the grill also extinguishes flare-ups.
 
All of our cooking times are just good estimates. Actual cooking times depend 
on the temperature of the air, the intensity of your grill’s heat, the thickness of 
the cut, and other factors. Make a small incision in the lamb chops with a thin, 
sharp knife a few minutes before you think they’re done to avoid overcooking.

Grilled Chops with Orange 
 
and Rosemary
In this recipe, we use a touch of garlic and two very compatible seasonings — orange 
and rosemary — that partner perfectly with these grilled lamb chops.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 1 to 4 hours
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 loin lamb chops, cut 1-inch thick
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 large shallot, peeled and minced
2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced
1 tablespoon grated orange peel (about 1 
large navel orange)
Salt and pepper to taste
4 sprigs fresh rosemary, each about 4 inches 
long
Olive oil for brushing rosemary sprigs
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar or to taste
Licking Your (Lamb) Chops
Lamb chops are delicious when cooked on the grill, whether they’re the big 
thick loin chops or the smaller riblets, which take no more than a minute or 
two on each side to cook. (You can eat the riblets with your fingers. In fact, 
the Italians call these riblets scottaditti, or “finger burners,” because you just 
might torch your digits when grabbing the riblets right off the grill.) A lamb 
chop needs little seasoning and is delicious when rubbed with a little olive 
oil, salt, and black pepper before grilling.
 
Avoid buying those skinny chops that you see wrapped in plastic in the super-
market refrigerator cases. Rib and loin lamb chops for the grill should be cut 
at least 1-inch thick; your goal is to keep the center of the chop pink and rosy, 
and the outside crisp and browned. A thinner chop gives you less control 
because it turns in a flash from medium to well-done.

221
 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
 1 If necessary, trim all but about 1⁄ 4 inch of fat from the edge of each chop.
 2 Using a small bowl and a wooden spoon, or a mortar and pestle, lightly mash together 
the 2 tablespoons olive oil, shallot, garlic, orange peel, and salt and pepper. Brush all 
surfaces of the chops with the mixture. Place the chops in a shallow baking dish or in a 
large, resealable plastic bag. Cover the dish or close the bag, and refrigerate the chops 
for 1 to 4 hours, turning occasionally.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chops from the flavored oil, reserving any extra. Brush the rosemary sprigs 
generously with olive oil and set them on a lightly oiled grid. Place a chop on each 
sprig. Grill the chops for 5 to 6 minutes per side for medium-rare, or until desired done-
ness, brushing each chop with the remaining marinade once before turning.
 5 Place the chops on a serving platter; sprinkle about 1⁄ 4 teaspoon balsamic vinegar over 
each chop and (if desired) additional salt and pepper.

The Lowdown on Lamb Shoulders
Arm and blade lamb chops from the shoulder aren’t the most tender cuts 
of meat. They contain a fair amount of connective tissue that, when grilled 
quickly, remains somewhat unattractive and sinewy — so we recommend 
that only ardent lamb lovers grill shoulder chops. If you do choose to grill 
shoulder chops, you’ll find them loaded with flavor. You also may find that 
they’re considerably cheaper than loin or rib chops.
 
Ask your butcher to cut shoulder steaks a bit thinner than the rib and loin 
chops. Thinner cuts allow the marinade to more fully penetrate and soften the 
sinewy meat.

222

Lamb Shoulder Chops with 
 
Yogurt and Curry Marinade
The key to preparing this recipe successfully is to marinate the chops for several hours 
or overnight, using a Middle Eastern yogurt and spice mixture, to help soften some of 
the connective tissue.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 shoulder lamb chops, cut 3⁄ 4-inch thick
2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
3⁄ 4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1⁄ 4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1⁄ 4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄ 2 cup plain lowfat yogurt
1 medium onion, peeled and quartered
2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro 
(coriander) leaves (optional)
 1 If necessary, trim all but 1⁄ 4 inch of the fat from the edges of the chops; place chops in a 
shallow baking dish.
 2 In a small bowl, combine the ginger, garlic, cumin, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. 
Spread the spice mixture over both sides of the chops. In a blender, blend the yogurt 
and onion for a few seconds into a coarse puree; pour the yogurt mixture over the 
chops in the baking dish, turning to coat. Cover the dish and marinate for 6 hours or 
overnight.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chops from the marinade, shaking off the excess; discard any remaining 
marinade. Grill the chops on a lightly oiled grid, 6 to 7 minutes per side for medium-
rare, or until desired doneness, turning once.
 5 Place the chops on a serving platter; sprinkle with additional salt and pepper and 
chopped cilantro leaves (if desired).
Go-With: Serve with Tomato Chutney or Summer Squash Chutney (Chapter 6) or Yogurt 
Cucumber Salad (Chapter 16).
Vary It! This yogurt marinade is also delicious with lamb kebabs, leg steaks, and whole 
roasts, such as a butterflied leg of lamb. To cover these larger roasts, you need to double 
the recipe.

 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
A Leg Up on Lamb
Most Americans who like lamb probably eat it seasonally (at Easter) in the 
form of a leg roast. The leg roast is a succulent cut with a fine texture that’s 
not unlike prime rib of beef, and it takes to marinades well. It can be cooked 
medium-rare or medium, but it takes on more of a lamb taste when cooked to 
well-done.
Grill roasting a leg
You can roast a 5- to 7-pound leg of lamb in a covered grill, with or without a 
rotisserie unit, with delicious results. Here’s how:
 
1. Prepare the leg for the grill by first trimming any large pieces of fat.
 
 A thin, transparent layer of tissue, called the fell, lies between the fat 
and the meat. Don’t remove this layer — it keeps the meat moist as it 
grills.
 
2. With the tip of a sharp knife, make a half dozen or more incisions, or 
very small pockets, all over the leg.
 
 Insert slivers of peeled garlic, as shown in Figure 13-2, into each slit 
and then rub the leg with olive oil. Sprinkle the leg with pepper, grated 
lemon peel, and 1 tablespoon of a fresh herb such as rosemary, marjo-
ram, or thyme.
 
3. Grill, covered, over a medium, indirect fire, with a drip pan under the 
meat that’s half-filled with water, broth, or apple juice.
 
 If you’re using charcoal, ignite 50 to 60 briquettes and bank them to one 
side of the grill after they’re ashy gray. Replenish the fire with additional 
charcoal every 30 to 40 minutes. (See Chapter 1 for more specific direc-
tions on building an indirect fire in a gas or charcoal grill.) Grill until an 
instant-read or oven thermometer registers 140 to 150 degrees for rare 
to medium-rare or 150 to 155 degrees for medium. If using a regular meat 
thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of the roast, without touch-
ing any bone, before grilling. Approximate grilling time is 15 to 20 min-
utes per pound, but start checking for doneness 30 minutes before the 
estimated final cooking time.
 
 The internal temperature of a roast will rise about 5 degrees after it’s 
removed from the grill or oven, causing it to cook a little more. Remove 
the roast when the thermometer registers about 5 degrees less than the 
desired final temperature.
 
4. Let the roast rest for about 10 to 15 minutes, loosely covered with foil, 
before carving into thin slices.
 
 Be sure to serve any remaining cutting-board juices with the meat.

Western Lamb Steaks
Ask your butcher to custom-cut lamb steaks from the leg of the lamb for this recipe. 
Each leg steak will probably weigh a little less than 1 pound, so two steaks are enough 
to serve four diners. This marinade, or basting sauce, also works with shoulder lamb 
chops or a butterflied leg. If you’re desperate for time, a bottle of your favorite barbe-
cue sauce, especially one with hickory-smoked flavoring, also makes a good sauce for 
lamb steaks.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
A roasted or grilled leg of lamb offers meat of varying degrees of doneness. 
The meat at the thin shank end, which is close to the bone, will be brown 
and probably well done. The meat at the thicker end is ideally quite pink and 
medium-rare.

Grilling legs, steak-style
Lamb leg steaks can be delicious on the grill, as in the following recipe. 
They’re a good substitute for beef sirloin, and they’re best when cooked 
medium-rare.

225
 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
2 lamb steaks, center cut from the leg, about 
3⁄ 4- to 1-inch thick
1⁄ 2 cup chili sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
2 tablespoons water
1 small onion, peeled, halved, and thinly sliced
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon chili powder
1⁄ 2 teaspoon ground cumin
Generous dashes Tabasco sauce
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 If necessary, trim all but about 1⁄ 4 inch of fat from the edges of the steaks; place steaks in 
a shallow baking dish or large, resealable plastic bag.
 2 In a mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the remaining ingredients, except the 
salt and pepper; pour the marinade over the lamb steaks, turning the steaks to coat 
them. Cover the dish or seal the bag, pressing out any air, and refrigerate 4 hours or 
overnight.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the steaks from the marinade, reserving marinade. Sprinkle the steaks with salt 
and pepper. Place the steaks on a lightly oiled grid. Grill 5 to 7 minutes per side for 
medium-rare, or until desired doneness, brushing once with marinade before turning.

Butterflying, marinating, and grilling 
legs: A no-fail method
After you try butterflied and grilled leg of lamb, you’ll probably agree that it’s 
one of the best meals you can serve to a crowd of backyard guests. To but-
terfly a leg, you bone it, slit the leg lengthwise, and spread it flat. The boned 
meat more readily accepts the flavors of its marinade, the grilling time is 
quick and even, the carving is a cinch, and the taste is delicious. Have your 
butcher butterfly the leg and trim the fat, or do it yourself by following the 
instructions in Figure 13-3.
Marinades for butterflied lamb can be as simple as salad dressing. (We know 
a few excellent home cooks who proudly announce that the best marinade 
for butterflied leg of lamb is a bottle of Wish-Bone Italian Dressing.) Or you 
may want to use something a bit fancier, perhaps a multi-ingredient curry 
marinade. Lamb, with its nearly gamey taste, readily accepts the flavors of 
yogurt, curry spices, red or white wine, lemon, hot peppers, black pepper, 
chili powders, balsamic vinegar, assorted herbs, and garlic — the best and 
simplest lamb seasoning.

Butterflied Leg of Lamb with 
 
Honey-Mustard Dressing
The small, boneless leg of lamb used in this recipe is available in most major supermar-
kets and is perfect for a family of 4 to 6. The leg is often wrapped in a twine bag or net-
ting. Remove the netting and lay the meat flat in the dressing. Be sure to let it marinate 
for at least 24 hours to completely absorb the vinegar, honey, and mustard flavors.
Follow your own likes and dislikes into your kitchen lab to assemble a mari-
nade for a butterflied leg of lamb. Ask yourself: “Do I want a hint of orange, 
lemon, or rosemary? Do I want a slightly sweet taste or something spicier? Do 
I like the pungency of balsamic or cider vinegar, or the complexity of a fruity 
red wine?” And then go for it.

If you want to feed a crowd of 10 or more, the ingredient amounts can be doubled for a 
bone-in 6- to 8-pound leg that weighs about 5 pounds butterflied. Or you can use the same 
marinade with wonderful success on about 2 pounds of lamb for kebabs. A final note: If 
you really love garlic, use the full 2 cloves; for less garlic flavor, use 1 large clove.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 24 hours
Grilling time: 25 to 30 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
A half or small butterflied leg of lamb (about 
21⁄ 4 to 21⁄ 2 pounds without the bone)
1 to 2 cloves garlic, peeled and thinly sliced
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
2 tablespoons honey
2 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
Salt and pepper to taste
Chopped parsley for garnish
 1 Trim all fat from the surface of the lamb. Using a sharp paring knife, make small inci-
sions or cuts along the inner side (the side that held the bone), about 1 to 2 inches 
apart. Insert a sliver of garlic into each small incision.
 2 Place the lamb in a large, shallow baking dish or resealable plastic bag.
 3 In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, honey, and mustard; pour the dressing 
over the lamb and turn to coat both sides. Cover the dish or seal the bag, pressing out 
any air, and refrigerate for 24 hours, turning occasionally.
 4 Drain the lamb, reserving the dressing. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and pepper on both 
sides.
 5 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 6 Place the lamb on a lightly oiled grid. Grill, turning the meat about every 8 to 10 min-
utes, for a total of 25 to 30 minutes or until the internal temperature in the thickest part 
of the meat registers 135 degrees to 140 degrees for rare, 145 degrees to 150 degrees for 
medium-rare, or 150 degrees to 155 degrees for medium. Baste the lamb twice with the 
reserved marinade during the first 15 to 18 minutes of grilling.
 7 Remove the lamb from the grill, place on a carving board, and let it rest, covered 
loosely with foil, 10 minutes before cutting against the grain into thin slices. Serve the 
meat with the carving board juices and sprinkle with chopped parsley.
Go-With: Suggested side dishes include Grand Marnier Grilled Sweet Potatoes, Garlic-Grilled 
Portobellos, or Grilled Tomatoes with Cumin Butter (all in Chapter 16); Tomato Chutney or 
Summer Squash Chutney (Chapter 6); and any of the salads in Chapter 16. Make sandwiches 
with any leftovers, spreading the bread with honey mustard or a little fruit chutney.

Racking Up Lamb for the Grill
Even though some people consider rack of lamb to be a rather dainty dish, 
we think it’s really finger-licking food. You’ll want to sink your teeth into the 
tiny morsels of meat around the back and rib bones and, eschewing fork and 
knife, pick up the small chops with your fingers. Lamb ribs are a lot like pork 
ribs — tender, juicy, full of flavor, and great on the grill. A rack of lamb may 
contain as many as eight ribs, but it’s more often cut by the butcher into 
individual portions of three or four chops per person.
Some cooks prefer to have their racks French cut so that the top of the rib 
bones are stripped entirely of their meat and fat. However, we recommend 
leaving the rib bone meat alone and intact, shown in Figure 13-4.

rack of lamb

Trim (or have your butcher trim) most of the fat from the back of the ribs, 
leaving only a paper-thin layer. Slice 2 to 3 inches between each rib down 
toward the meatier “eye” end. Slash also about 1 inch through the backbone 
to separate each chop slightly at the bottom of the rack, as shown in Figure 
13-4. The rack should remain in one piece, but these slashes allow you to 
apply basting sauces and seasonings with better results.
 
Rack of Lamb with Hoisin Marinade
Because orange juice and honey are the principal ingredients in this recipe, the rack of 
lamb is grilled indirectly to prevent the meat from cooking too fast and charring. 
Indirect cooking is an excellent method of cooking racks and roasts — even if sweet 
ingredients aren’t present in the recipe. The final result is a moist and juicy piece of 
meat that needs little attending. In this recipe, the rack is left on the grill for at least 20 
minutes before turning. This marinade is terrific with any cut of lamb, from chops to 
leg, and also works with pork and poultry.

229
 Chapter 13: Savoring the Peppery Meat of the Middle East: Lamb
1 8-rib rack of lamb, about 21/2 pounds
2/3 cup fresh orange juice
3 tablespoons hoisin sauce
3 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon honey
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Using a sharp knife, cut the rack in half, so that each half has 4 ribs. Make a 1-inch cut 
between each chop at the backbone end to make carving easier. Make a 2-inch cut between 
each rib down toward the meaty “eye” end. Trim the fat, leaving a paper-thin layer on the 
back of each rack (refer to Figure 13-4). (A good butcher can do all of this, if you prefer.)
 2 In a small mixing bowl, make the hoisin marinade by combining all the remaining ingre-
dients, except the salt and pepper.
 3 Place the lamb racks in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow baking dish; pour the 
marinade over the lamb. Try to work pieces of the ginger and garlic into the slashed 
areas. Seal the bag (press out all the air in the bag to surround the rack with the mari-
nade) or cover the dish, and refrigerate 12 to 24 hours, turning occasionally.
 4 Remove the lamb from the refrigerator and let it stand for about 30 minutes before grill-
ing. Meanwhile, prepare a hot, indirect fire in a charcoal or gas grill, with a drip plan 
(half filled with water) in place. (For complete directions on how to build an indirect 
fire, turn to Chapter 1.)
 5 Remove the rack of lamb from the marinade. Shake off the excess marinade and reserve 
any remaining marinade. Season the lamb on both sides with salt and pepper.
 6 Place the lamb on the grid, fat side down, over the drip pan on the side without heat. 
Cover and grill for 45 to 55 minutes, turning every 20 minutes, or until an instant-read 
thermometer registers 140 degrees to 150 degrees for rare to medium-rare or 150 
degrees to 155 degrees for medium. Add hot briquettes to a charcoal fire after 30 to 40 
minutes, or when necessary, to maintain heat. If desired, during the last few minutes of 
grilling, move the lamb to the side of the grid directly above the heat for 3 to 5 minutes 
per side, to brown the meat more thoroughly.
 7 Remove the lamb from the grid and place on a carving platter. Cover the meat loosely 
with foil and let rest for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, transfer the reserved marinade to a 
small saucepan. Bring to a boil and then simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. 
Carve the lamb into individual chops; spoon the sauce over the chops and serve.
Go-With: Rice, noodles, or whole potatoes roasted in a covered grill (see Chapter 16) 
make excellent accompaniments to this lamb dish.

hicken and other types of fowl offer more 
than great taste when prepared on the grill. 
They also provide a healthy, nutritious meal. 
Almost the whole world loves chicken, and for 
good reason: It can be used in tons of recipes, it’s 
a fairly inexpensive meat, and as far as we know, 
there are no religious taboos against it.
If, however, you’re getting a little tired of using

Finger-Lickin’ Chicken
Chicken’s mild flavor is appealing, and its meat 
adapts extremely well to marinades, rubs, and

Especially with its skin on, chicken can be seared — browned very quickly — 
and can then turn charcoal-black just as quickly, without the inside getting 
cooked at all. You obviously want to avoid this situation. The key to grilling 
any type of chicken over direct heat is to turn the pieces continually and move 
them to hotter or cooler spots on the grid when some pieces seem to be 
cooking faster than others.

More specifically, follow these steps when using direct heat to grill chicken 
pieces with bone and skin. If you find the meat is cooking too quickly or 
turning black, immediately remove it to indirect heat and keep turning it to 
prevent overcooking.
 
1. Place thicker, dark-meat pieces, which include the thighs and legs, on 
the grill first.
 
 You do this because they take longer to cook than white-meat pieces. Be 
sure to place these pieces on the hottest part of your grill grid.
 
2. Add the other parts of the bird — the breast and wings — after about 
10 minutes, or when the legs and thighs have browned on both sides.
 
 Remember that white-meat breasts cook quickly and, if they aren’t 
watched carefully, can dry out.
 
3. Throughout the grilling process, continually turn the pieces from side 
to side, or to hotter or cooler areas of the grid as necessary, making 
sure that none of them are cooking too fast or turning black.
 
 Don’t leave your chicken unattended when grilling it directly over the 
heat. You have to be there, and you have to monitor it. The result of 
your attention will be a crispy, smoky chicken that’s juicy inside and full 
of the flavor of the grill.
 
4. Check your chicken for doneness.
 
 If you use an instant-read thermometer to check for doneness, the 
boneless, skinless breast meat should register 160 degrees, and bone-in 
breast and thigh meat should reach 170 degrees. To check for doneness 
without a thermometer, make a small cut into the thickest part of the 
chicken. The juices should run clear, and the meat should show no trace 
of pink. Move any fully cooked pieces to the edges of the grid to keep 
them warm until the remaining pieces finish cooking.
 
Covering the grill automatically raises the grill’s temperature. To maintain a 
medium heat, adjust the heat setting on a gas grill or close the vents on a 
charcoal grill. Closing the cover vents lowers the heat, while opening them 
adds more oxygen to the fire and increases the heat.
FSIS: The poultry production inspector
American poultry production is carefully moni-
tored by the Food, Safety, and Inspection Service 
(FSIS) of the Food and Drug Administration. The 
FSIS monitors more than 4 billion chickens each 
year for disease. It also has strict regulations as 
to shopping containers, labeling requirements, 
and use of trade names. The FSIS inspects the 
breeding, hatching, and sanitation of the pro-
duction lots, as well as the chemicals used, 
but it doesn’t oversee any genetic breeding. It 
also doesn’t inspect game birds such as quail, 
pheasant, and partridge.

233
 Chapter 14: Birds of a Feather
Handling chicken with care
Even though American poultry production is carefully monitored and the 
facilities comply with all government sanitary and safety guidelines, salmonella 
and other bacteria that can cause sickness in human beings may still be found 
in chicken. Fortunately, these bacteria are killed off if the chicken is cooked 
until the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees for boneless, skinless 
breasts; 170 degrees for bone-in breasts and leg quarters; and 180 degrees for 
whole birds.
 
Here are a few guidelines for safe handling and preparation of chicken in your 
kitchen:
 
✓ Always keep poultry refrigerated until it’s ready for cooking — even 
when in a marinade.
 
✓ Always thaw frozen poultry in the refrigerator — never at room 
temperature. You can usually thaw a chicken in the fridge overnight.
 
✓ If any part of the bird has an odd or “off” odor, discard the entire 
chicken.
 
✓ Before cooking chicken, wash it (inside and out if using a whole bird) 
with cold running water and then pat it dry with paper towels. Discard 
the paper towels.
 
✓ Thoroughly wash your hands, the utensils, and the work surface when 
you’re done handling the raw meat.
Grilling chicken breasts
Chicken breasts offer plenty of interesting grilling options. They can be 
grilled with or without their skin and bones; seasoned with any number of 
alluring rubs, sauces, and marinades; and sliced into thin strips or thick 
cubes for sizzling kebabs. (See Chapter 8 for some kebab recipes.)
Free, free on the range
Free-range chickens aren’t penned, so they 
have the freedom to roam a yard eating both 
the natural foods that chickens scratch for and 
the feed provided by the grower. This is a much 
more expensive process than penning tens of 
thousands of chickens into a factory space 
and feeding them in a regimented fashion. But 
free-range chickens make for a tastier bird. 
However, they aren’t always the most tender 
bird, because they do roam around actively.

Lemon Chicken Breasts
This recipe’s lovely marinade of fresh lemon, olive oil, and herbs keeps the skinless 
chicken breasts moist and plump on the grill. It’s also good for bone-in chicken.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 2 to 6 hours
Grilling time: 10 to 12 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
8 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves 
(about 2 to 3 pounds)
1⁄2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1⁄2 cup fresh lemon juice
Grated peel of 1 lemon (2 to 3 teaspoons)
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper
 1 Trim the breasts of any loose fat; rinse them under cold running water and pat dry with 
paper towels.
 2 Place the breasts in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow, nonreactive baking dish. 
In a small mixing bowl or large glass measuring cup, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, 
lemon peel, garlic, oregano, and salt and pepper; pour the marinade over the breasts in 
the bag or dish. Cover the dish or seal the bag, pressing out any air; refrigerate for 2 to 
6 hours, turning the breasts occasionally to coat in the marinade.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chicken breasts from the marinade; discard the marinade. Place the breasts 
on a well-oiled grid for 10 to 12 minutes or until done, turning every 4 to 5 minutes. To 
test for doneness, cut into the breasts; the meat should be white and moist with no sign 
of pink.

When marinating any food, remember to use a nonreactive container — one 
made of plastic, glass, ceramic, or other nonmetallic material. Certain metals, 
such as aluminum, react with acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar, 
causing the food and marinade to discolor.
Breast meat is juicier and more flavorful if it’s grilled with the skin intact. 
However, the skin contains a lot of fat that can cause dangerous flare-ups. 
You may want to opt for skinless breasts, or you can pull the skin off before 
grilling. We start this section with two easy skinless breast recipes that grill 
in about 10 quick minutes (another advantage of cooking without the skin 
and bone — it’s so fast).
 
You can grill chicken breasts with the skin intact to add flavor and moisture to 
the meat, and then reduce calories by removing the skin before serving.
Just wingin’ it
Once discarded by many people as not worth eating, the chicken wing has 
become one of the most popular parts of the bird, thanks, in large part, to a 
cook in Buffalo, New York.
Back on the night of October 30, 1964, at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, owner 
Teressa Bellissimo’s sons and their friends came in just before midnight with 
a roaring appetite. Mrs. Bellissimo had received an oversupply of chicken 
wings that day, so she popped them in the deep fryer and mixed together a 
little margarine and hot sauce as well as a blue cheese dressing. The boys 
gobbled it up, others in the bar loved the idea, and the Buffalo Chicken Wing 
was born.
Szechwan peppercorns
Though they resemble black peppercorns, 
Szechwan peppercorns (also known as Chinese 
pepper) aren’t part of the black and white pep-
percorn family at all. This mildly hot, aromatic 
spice is actually a berry with a tiny seed. These 
berries are from a tree that’s native to the 
Szechwan province of China. To release their 
flavorful oils, heat the berries in a dry, heavy-
bottomed skillet just until they give off an 
aromatic scent, about 1 to 2 minutes. Discard 
any that blacken. Then crush by using a mortar 
and pestle or place them on a cutting board and 
press them with the bottom of a heavy skillet.
Szechwan peppercorns, which are often used 
in marinades and sauces with other Chinese 
seasonings, are available in spice sections of 
Asian markets or other specialty food stores.

Chowing down on chicken quarters
Choosing chicken quarters simplifies the grilling process because you have 
fewer pieces to watch and turn. And some grilling chefs believe that quartered 
pieces retain their moisture and succulence better than individual pieces 
of chicken. As a bonus, chicken quarters look inviting on the plate. They’re 
especially good as a special occasion or company dish.
Figure 14-1 shows you how to cut a whole chicken into pieces. Obviously, 
if you’re cutting it in quarters, you need only cut it into four pieces: leave 
the wings attached to the breasts, and leave the drumsticks attached to the 
thighs.

Grilled Chicken Quarters 
 
with Barbecue Sauce
This recipe calls for two easy steps — preparing the barbecue sauce and grilling the 
chicken quarters. We think that you’ll like the way sweet, sour, and spicy flavors come 
together in this barbecue sauce. If you want to crank up the heat, add more Tabasco 
sauce.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Barbecue Sauce
1 cup ketchup
1⁄2 medium onion, peeled and finely chopped
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon molasses
1
1⁄2 teaspoons cider vinegar
1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
3⁄4 teaspoon salt, or to taste
3⁄4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
1⁄4 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
 
 Combine all the ingredients in a medium saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then 
lower the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce can be kept, 
covered, in the refrigerator up to a week.
Grilled Chicken Quarters
1 whole chicken (about 3 to 3
1⁄2 pounds), 
quartered
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 As the fire preheats, rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry with paper 
towels. Rub the chicken quarters with the oil, covering all surfaces; sprinkle all over 
with salt and pepper.
 3 Place the chicken parts, skin side down, on a well-oiled grid, directly over the heat, and 
grill for 15 minutes, turning every 4 to 5 minutes.
 4 Baste the quarters thoroughly on both sides with the barbecue sauce. Continue grilling 
for another 7 to 10 minutes or until the chicken is done, turning every 3 to 4 minutes. 
Cut into the quarters to test for doneness; when cooked, the juices run clear, and the 
meat near the bone is no longer pink.

Grilled Lime Chicken with 
 
Onion Compote
In this recipe, chicken quarters are first soaked in a luscious lime marinade and then 
they’re grilled and smothered with onions that are slightly caramelized from long, slow, 
top-of-the-stove cooking. The result is divine.
Preparation time: 45 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 3- to 3
1⁄2-pound chicken, quartered
1⁄4 cup olive oil
3⁄4 cup lime juice
Grated peel of 1
1⁄2 limes
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1⁄2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper
Salt to taste
1⁄4 cup corn oil
3 Spanish onions, or 4 medium yellow onions, 
peeled, halved, and sliced about 
1⁄4-inch thick
1⁄2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
2 bay leaves, crushed
Pepper to taste
 1 Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels; place the 
chicken in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow, nonreactive baking dish.
 2 In a small mixing bowl or large glass measuring cup, combine the olive oil, lime juice, 
lime peel, garlic, cracked black pepper, and salt. Pour the marinade over the chicken in 
the bag or dish. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, or cover the dish; refrigerate for 6 
hours, or overnight, turning occasionally to coat the chicken in the marinade.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 4 As the grill preheats, make the onion compote. In a medium skillet, heat the corn oil 
over medium heat; add the onions and sauté for 15 minutes, turning frequently. Stir in 
the thyme, bay leaves, and salt and pepper; continue cooking for 10 minutes or longer, 
until the onions are well browned, turning frequently. When done, remove from heat 
and set aside.
 5 Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off some of the excess; reserve the 
remaining marinade. Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper and place on a 
well-oiled grid, skin side down. Cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the juices 
run clear and the meat near the bone is no longer pink, turning every 4 minutes.
 6 Add the reserved marinade to the onions in the skillet and simmer over medium heat 
for 15 minutes. When the chicken is done, remove it from the grill onto a serving platter; 
spoon the onion compote over the chicken and serve immediately.

Lemon-Cilantro Chicken with 
 
Garlic-Ginger Mayonnaise
The fragrant marinade in this recipe is made with cilantro, fresh ginger, garlic, soy 
sauce, curry powder, and hot chili powder — all are ingredients common to Pacific Rim 
cuisine. The mayonnaise garnish, laced with ginger, garlic, and lemon juice, gives it an 
American twist.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 3- to 3
1⁄2-pound chicken, quartered and 
scored (score by slashing through the skin 
and into the meat on both sides of each piece, 
using a sharp knife)
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1 tablespoon corn or vegetable oil
1 tablespoon peeled and grated fresh ginger
Grated peel of 1 lemon
2 scallions, trimmed and finely chopped
6 sprigs cilantro (coriander) leaves and stems, 
chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
3⁄4 teaspoon curry powder
1⁄2 teaspoon hot chili powder
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Rinse the chicken under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels; place the 
chicken in a large, resealable plastic bag or a shallow nonreactive baking dish.
 2 In a small mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the remaining ingredients; pour 
the marinade over the chicken in the bag or dish. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, or 
cover the dish; refrigerate for 6 hours, or overnight, turning the chicken occasionally to 
coat in the marinade.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Remove the chicken from the marinade, shaking off a bit of the excess. Season the 
chicken with salt and pepper; place, skin side down, on an oiled grid. Cover and grill for 
20 to 25 minutes, turning every 4 minutes, until the juices run clear and the meat is no 
longer pink near the bone. Serve with Garlic-Ginger Mayonnaise (see the following 
recipe) and grilled asparagus (Chapter 16).
Garlic-Ginger Mayonnaise
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: About 
2⁄3 cup
2⁄3 cup mayonnaise
1
1⁄2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

 In a small, nonreactive mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate 
until ready to use with Lemon-Cilantro Chicken. You can make this mayonnaise ahead 
and store it, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
Vary It! Garlic-Ginger Mayonnaise is also delicious with grilled fish (Chapter 15).

It’s thigh time to grill some legs
The legs and thighs of chicken are dark meat with rich flavor. They’re delicious 
when grilled and lend themselves to being eaten with your fingers — always 
one of our prime considerations when grilling for a party!
 
Moroccan Chicken Legs and Thighs
Moroccan spices are quite assertive, and the flavors here are heightened by the 
smokiness of the grill. The marinade in this recipe contains a good amount of honey, so 
to avoid scorching the skin we use both direct and indirect grilling methods.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 6 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 35 to 40 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 chicken legs and thighs (about 2
1⁄2 to 3 
pounds total)
1⁄4 cup olive oil
1⁄4 cup honey
1⁄4 cup mixed, chopped fresh mint and parsley
1⁄4 cup plus 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons grated lemon peel
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons peeled and grated fresh ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1⁄4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1⁄8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Salt and black pepper to taste
 1 Rinse the chicken pieces under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. 
Unless you purchased the chicken as separate pieces, divide the legs from the thighs 
by cutting through the thigh-leg joint with a sharp knife. Place the pieces in a large, 
resealable plastic bag or a large, shallow, nonreactive baking dish.

244
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 2 In a small mixing bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the olive oil, honey, mint and 
parsley, lemon juice, lemon peel, garlic, ginger, cumin, red pepper flakes, cayenne 
pepper, and salt and black pepper. Pour the marinade over the chicken, turning to coat 
all sides. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, or cover the dish; refrigerate for 6 hours, or 
overnight, turning occasionally.
 3 Prepare an indirect, medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill. (Turn to Chapter 
1 for instructions about building an indirect fire.) Place a drip pan under the side of the 
grill without heat.
 4 Remove the chicken from the marinade, reserving the remaining marinade. Place the 
chicken pieces, skin side down, on a lightly oiled grid, directly over the heat. Grill until 
well browned on both sides, turning every 2 to 3 minutes. (At this point, you need to 
hover over the grilling pieces to prevent the skin from burning.) Move the pieces to the 
side of the grill without heat; baste with the reserved marinade. Cover the grill and cook 
for 15 minutes. Turn and baste again with any remaining marinade; cover and cook for 
15 to 20 minutes more or until done. To test for doneness, cut into the chicken; the 
juices should run clear, and the meat near the bone should show no sign of pink. Place 
the chicken on a serving platter and serve with Tomato and Red Onion Salad. (See 
Chapter 16.)

Dishing up a whole chicken
A whole chicken cooked on the grill is actually a pretty simple dish to make — 
and it’s great to present at the table! Because it’s whole, the chicken keeps its 
juices in well — as long as it’s basted frequently and turned so that it doesn’t 
burn or overcook. You should consider moving it to indirect heat if the grill 
starts to flame up on the skin. Check out Figure 14-1 to see how to cut up a 
whole chicken.
 
Chicken alla Mattone
“Alla mattone” is Italian for “under a brick,” and you actually do use a brick (covered 
with aluminum foil) or another heavy weight for this dish. By pressing the chicken 
down onto the grill, the bird cooks more evenly, gets a nice singe on the skin, and 
comes out very juicy. It’s also about the simplest way to grill a whole chicken! You can 
see the finished dish in the color photo section of this book.

245
 Chapter 14: Birds of a Feather
1 whole chicken, cut in half and backbone 
removed (refer to Figure 14-1)
Lemon peel from 1 lemon, cut into 1-inch 
pieces
2 cloves garlic, peeled and thickly sliced
3 to 4 sprigs rosemary, cut into 1-inch pieces
Juice of 2 lemons
2 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed
6 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoons salt
1⁄2 teaspoon freshly ground black peppercorns
Juice of 1 lemon and 2 tablespoons olive oil to 
drizzle over grilled chicken (optional)
 1 Make slits in various parts of the chicken and insert the lemon peels, the sliced garlic 
cloves, and half of the rosemary sprigs between the skin and the meat.
 2 Place each half of the chicken in its own resealable plastic bag (or in separate nonreactive 
dishes). In each container, place 1 of the crushed garlic cloves, half of the remaining 
rosemary, juice of 1 lemon, 3 tablespoons olive oil, 
1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and 
1⁄4 teaspoon 
freshly ground peppercorns. Mix well and seal the bag, pressing out any air (or cover, if 
you’re using a dish). Place the containers of chicken in the refrigerator, set a foil-
wrapped brick or other heavy object on top of each chicken half (to help flatten the 
chicken before you grill it), and marinate 2 to 6 hours.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot grill in a charcoal or gas grill and either wrap two bricks in foil 
or get a cast-iron skillet handy. Also have some grilling mitts and tongs handy — the 
grilling gets a bit tricky.
 4 Remove the chicken halves from the marinade, reserving any that’s remaining and 
pouring it into a bowl to use as a basting sauce. Place the chicken, skin side down, on a 
well-oiled grid directly over the hot coals. Lay the bricks or cast-iron skillet over the 
chicken halves to press them down on the grill.
 5 Cook for 3 to 5 minutes or until the skin starts to brown. Check the chicken to be sure it 
isn’t browning too rapidly. Move the pieces to a cooler part of the grill for another 5 to 
7 minutes.
 6 Remove the bricks from the chicken, baste with some of the marinade, turn the chicken 
over, and place on the hotter part of the grill. Lay the bricks over the chicken again and 
cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the chicken starts to brown. Move the chicken to a 
cooler part of the grill and continue to grill for another 5 to 7 minutes until done. To test 
for doneness, cut into the breast and thigh; the meat should be tender and moist, and 
the juices should run clear. Remove the meat to a clean platter.
 7 Cut the chicken into servings and drizzle with additional lemon juice and olive oil (if 
desired).

Brined and Grilled Chicken
Brining is an age-old process of preserving food by soaking it in a solution of salt and 
water (and sometimes, sugar). Brining can also be used to increase the amount of liquid 
inside food cells in order to make the food juicy, tender, and full of flavor. Think of 
brining as a long, deep marinade without an acidic ingredient (such as lemon or vinegar). 
You can enhance the flavor of a salty brine with citrus peel, fresh ginger, cloves, garlic, 
hot peppers, peppercorns, and most herbs.
After one attempt, you’ll see how easy and irresistible it is to brine chicken for the grill. 
Serve a pretty fruit or vegetable chutney, with contrasting sugar and vinegar flavors, 
alongside the finished dish. (Try the delicious, quick-cooking chutney recipes in 
Chapter 6. Or buy a bottle of chutney if you don’t have the time to make your own.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 quart water
1⁄2 cup kosher salt
1⁄2 cup sugar
1 bay leaf, or 1 teaspoon dried sage, thyme, or 
other herb
1⁄2 teaspoon black peppercorns
1 whole chicken (3 to 4 pounds), cut into 
pieces (refer to Figure 14-1)
Pepper (optional)
 1 In a large nonreactive container or a large, resealable plastic bag, combine the water, 
kosher salt, sugar, bay leaf or other herb, and black peppercorns. Stir the solution for 2 
to 3 minutes, until the sugar and salt are nearly dissolved. Add the chicken pieces and 
submerge into the brine by using a heavy weight (such as a plate), or close the plastic 
bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate for 1
1⁄2 to 2 hours, stirring the 
mixture occasionally.
 2 Remove the chicken from the brine, rinse well, and dry thoroughly with paper towels. 
You can leave the bird nearly unseasoned (adding only black pepper, if desired), or you 
can use the seasonings that we recommend in the following Dry Poultry Rub for Brined 
Chicken recipe. Be sure not to add extra salt until after grilling; the brine already has 
plenty of salt.
 3 Prepare a medium fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 4 Place the chicken pieces, skin side down, on a well-oiled grid. Cover the grill and adjust the 
temperature or hood vents to maintain medium heat (about 350 degrees). Grill the chicken, 
covered, for a total of 20 to 25 minutes, turning every 3 to 5 minutes, or as necessary, to 
keep the pieces from browning too quickly. To test for doneness, cut into the chicken; the 
juices should run clear, and the meat near the bone should show no sign of pink.

Dry Poultry Rub for Brined Chicken
After brining pieces of chicken to make them moist and tender (see the previous 
recipe), you can rub them with this tasty seasoning blend before grilling. Or turn to 
Chapters 5 and 6 for additional seasonings and sauces. However, we suggest that you 
avoid any seasoning or sauce that includes additional salt — the brining process 
provides plenty.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Enough for 4 pounds of chicken
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
2 teaspoons ground sage
1 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1⁄2 teaspoon pepper, or to taste
 1 Rub the chicken with the olive oil, covering all surfaces.
 2 In a small mixing bowl, combine all the remaining ingredients. Rub chicken pieces 
generously, applying the spice mixture under the skin and into the cavity as well as on 
all surfaces.
 3 Grill pieces as directed in the Brined and Grilled Chicken recipe.
 
Dark meat takes longer to cook than white meat and therefore should be 
placed on the grill about 5 minutes before the breasts. Or you can start the 
pieces all at once and move the breasts after they’re fully cooked to the cooler 
edges to keep them warm until the legs and thighs finish cooking.
Being Thankful for the 
Many Uses of Turkey
Turkey is low in fat, but unlike chicken, it needs a little more love and care to 
arrive on the plate tender, moist, and perfectly grilled. Turkeys are available 
in smaller portions (especially as breast meat and as ground turkey, which is 
featured in Chapter 7), which are extremely versatile at any time of the year, 
so don’t reserve turkey for holidays.

Grilled Turkey Tenderloins with 
 
Honey-Mustard Glaze
Tenderloins, from the breast of the turkey, are boneless, skinless, and easily grilled. 
Many of the marinades and basting sauces that are designed for chicken can be used 
to flavor turkey tenderloins, but here we chose a Honey-Mustard Glaze. (However, if 
you need to, feel free to substitute bottled honey-mustard.) Watch the cooking time 
carefully — turkey tenderloins have little fat and dry out quickly. Try to remove them 
from the grill just at the point of doneness, when they’re still moist and tender.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 10 to 13 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Honey-Mustard Glaze
1⁄2 cup honey
1⁄4 cup plus 1 tablespoon Dijon-style mustard
Pepper to taste
 
 In a small bowl, whisk the honey and mustard until smooth; season the glaze with 
pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
Grilled Turkey Tenderloins
4 boneless turkey tenderloins (about 1
3⁄4 to 2 
pounds total)
6 tablespoons olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
2 teaspoons Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, or 1 
teaspoon dried rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
1 large handful of presoaked hickory or 
mesquite-flavored wood chips (optional)
 1 Rinse the tenderloins under cold running water; pat dry with paper towels.
 2 In a small bowl, whisk until smooth the oil, lemon juice, and mustard. Stir in the 
rosemary and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

249
 Chapter 14: Birds of a Feather
 3 Place the turkey tenderloins in a shallow, nonreactive baking dish or a large resealable 
plastic bag. Add the lemon-mustard marinade and turn the tenderloins to coat. Cover 
the dish or seal the bag, pressing out any air; refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight.
 4 Prepare a medium fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill. If desired, throw a large 
handful of presoaked wood chips onto the coals just before placing the tenderloins on 
the grill. If using a gas grill, wrap the chips in aluminum foil or place them in a metal 
smoker box.
 5 Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and place them on an oiled grid. Discard the 
marinade. Grill, covered, for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they’re lightly browned on both 
sides, turning once.
 6 Divide the Honey-Mustard Glaze (see the previous recipe) in half. Baste the tenderloins 
on both sides, using half the glaze; reserve the other half as a finishing sauce. Grill the 
tenderloins, covered, for another 2 to 3 minutes or until done, turning once. Make a 
small incision in the center of each tenderloin to determine doneness. The meat is 
cooked when there’s no trace of pink in the center or thickest part.
 7 Transfer the tenderloins to a platter and let them stand, covered with aluminum foil, for 
5 minutes before slicing across the grain. In a small saucepan, bring the remaining glaze 
to a boil; drizzle over the tenderloin slices.
Vary It! This recipe can be varied many ways by simply changing the basting sauce. 
Instead of the Honey-Mustard Glaze, try using Pesto Sauce (Chapter 15), a bottled barbecue 
sauce, or a chipotle sauce. Or omit the basting sauce completely and serve with a tomato 
or black bean salsa (recipes in Chapter 6).

If wood chips flare up when you toss them onto a fire, spritz them lightly with 
a spray bottle filled with water. This dampens the flames and increases the

Dale Curry’s Hickory-Smoked 
 
Whole Turkey
To find out how to infuse a whole turkey with real smoked hickory flavors, we turned to 
Dale Curry, food editor of The Times-Picayune in New Orleans. Dale was born and raised 
in Memphis, where eating barbecue is an everyday experience. She says that everybody 
loves the following smoked turkey recipe.
This recipe shows you a healthy way to cook a turkey. Slow-cooking and smoking over 
a small fire of only about 30 briquettes allows the turkey meat to stay very moist and 
succulent without the addition of extra fat or butter-rich basting sauces. It’s best to buy 
a turkey with a pop-up thermometer. Cooking the bird too long results in tough, dry 
meat. Be sure to check for doneness frequently, about every 15 minutes, toward the end 
of the cooking time.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Grilling time: 4 to 4
1⁄2 hours
Yield: 12 servings
12-pound fresh or frozen and thawed turkey 
(preferably with a pop-up thermometer)
Creole seasoning (store-bought variety)
About 6 heaping handfuls presoaked hickory 
wood chips
 1 Remove the giblet packages from the turkey cavities; rinse the turkey and pat dry. 
Sprinkle the bird all over with the Creole seasoning, inside and out. Let the turkey rest 
at room temperature as you prepare the charcoal fire.
 2 Prepare a small charcoal fire, using about 30 briquettes, in a kettle grill with a lid. When 
the coals are hot, move them to one side of the grill. (See Chapter 1 for complete 
instructions on building an indirect fire.) Place a drip pan, filled about one-third with 
water, next to the coals. Sprinkle a large handful of presoaked hickory wood chips over 
the coals.
 3 Place the turkey on a well-oiled grid, directly over the drip pan opposite the coals. 
Cover the grill. Open the vents directly under the fire and above the turkey to facilitate 
an even flow of smoke. Open the grill every 40 to 45 minutes, turn the turkey around or 
from side to side, and add 6 coals and another large handful of presoaked wood chips 
to the fire. Keep the grill lid closed between these times. Continue to cook the turkey 
in this fashion until the pop-up thermometer has sprung or until an instant-read 
thermometer inserted into the thigh registers 180 degrees. A 12-pound turkey will take 
about 4 to 4
1⁄2 hours to cook, depending on the heat of the fire, the air temperature, the 
actual size of the bird, and its distance from the fire. When done, the skin will look quite 
brown, but the inside meat will be moist and juicy. Remove the turkey from the grill and 
let it rest at least for 15 minutes before carving.

 Chapter 14: Birds of a Feather
 
Creole seasoning is made by many commercial manufacturers, such as 
Zatarain’s, McCormick, Tony Chachere, and Paul Prudhomme, and is 
commonly found in supermarket spice sections. It’s a blend of salt, red and 
black pepper, garlic, and other spicy seasonings.
Game Birds Make for Healthy Eating
 
Aside from their wonderful, individual tastes, game birds are extremely 
healthy foods. They’re lower in fat and cholesterol than chicken. A 3.5-ounce 
portion of domestic quail with skin has about 133 calories and 2.8 grams of 
fat, compared with 193 calories and 7.6 grams of fat for the same amount of 
chicken. Because they use their muscles constantly, game birds burn off their 
fat. The feed of both wild and domestic birds tends to have more minerals and 
vitamins than poultry feed.
You may think that anything you do with a chicken you can do with a game 
bird, but that’s nowhere near the truth. Because of their unique textures, 
their differences in flavor, and their relative lack of fat, game birds must be 
treated differently than a chicken on the grill — the prep and grilling differ a 
good deal. Due to their lack of fat, wild birds in particular require basting. 
Farm-raised game birds have slightly more fat (though not as much as 
chicken), so you usually don’t have to baste them. Because game birds cook 
more quickly, they’re wonderful options for a party or for times when you 
don’t want to spend even 30 minutes tending to the grill.
Comparing wild versus farm-raised 
game birds
There are no two ways about it: Wild game has a flavor you just won’t find 
in farm-raised game. That’s not to say that wild game is gamy, a term that’s 
acquired the connotation of meaning strong-tasting or bitter. Freshly killed 
wild game isn’t gamy at all — unless, of course, the bird isn’t dressed properly 
or is handled too long.
Not too long ago, wild game birds were a rarity at the market, but today they 
can easily be ordered from any good butcher with a few days’ notice. You can 
also find many sources for game by mail order and on the Internet.
Freshly killed game properly dressed and hung has absolutely wonderful 
flavor, much of which comes from the food the birds eat. The variety in each 
type of bird’s food makes different species from different parts of the wild 
taste remarkably different.

252
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
Having said all that, we can’t wholly recommend going out and shooting 
your own wild birds for food unless you are, in fact, an experienced hunter 
or willing to become one. Aside from needing the knowledge of how to dress 
and prepare a bird, you need to know whether that bird is healthy, and only 
a trained inspector or experienced hunter can tell you that. This is why all 
game birds sold in U.S. markets are produced on farms. The exception is 
game from Europe (mainly Scotland) that has been inspected immediately 
after being killed. This game is cleared for export to and sale in the U.S.
Fortunately, farm-raised game birds are now abundant, and although they 
don’t possess the singular flavor of their wild cousins, birds like squab, 
quail, and pheasant offer superb grilling and dining possibilities. Therefore, 
although you can order wild birds from reputable dealers at markets or 
online, we endorse the idea that farm-raised game birds are the safe way to 
go when it comes to grilling.
Surveying game bird varieties
You can find several varieties of game birds in Figure 14-2; descriptions of 
each are in the following list:
 
✓ Rock Cornish game hen: Many people who are squeamish about game 
birds but bored with chicken take advantage of the fine-flavored Rock 
Cornish game hen, which, despite its name, doesn’t come from a rock or 
from Cornwall, England. It’s actually the result of an American breeding 
between a Plymouth Rock hen and a Cornish game cock. It weighs only 1 
to 2 pounds — quite nice for one or two people. This isn’t a wild bird at 
all, and its popularity in the U.S. means that you almost always find it at 
the market. Rock Cornish game hens taste great when grilled. (Check out 
the recipe in this chapter for Rock Cornish Game Hens with Molasses-Rum 
Marinade.)
 
✓ Grouse: A very full-flavored red-meat bird with a pronounced taste, 
grouse is never farm-raised and is difficult to find. The best grouse come 
in from Scotland in the fall and usually are sold to restaurants. Because 
this bird feeds on evergreens, it can have a lovely spruce-like undertone. 
You need one grouse (about 1
1⁄4 pounds) per person for a dinner, and 
be prepared to pick out some of the buckshot from the meat! Grouse is 
best when roasted on a spit or grilled in halves to medium doneness. If 
cooked to a gray color, grouse loses its unique flavor.
 
✓ Partridge: This strong-flavored bird doesn’t taste quite as much like 
liver as grouse does. Partridge is a good plump bird that’s best when 
spit-roasted or grilled in halves. Serve one partridge per person. 
Partridge is wonderful with braised cabbage or wild rice.

253
 Chapter 14: Birds of a Feather
 
✓ Pheasant: Farm-raised pheasant are becoming more available, and 
although they don’t quite have the flavor of wild pheasant, they make 
for a delectable alternative to chicken. One bird will satisfy two healthy 
appetites. Pheasant takes well to light marinades.
 
✓ Poussin: Poussins — pronounced poo-SAHNS — aren’t really game 
birds. They’re small spring chickens that weigh about 1 pound. They 
have a sweet flavor and tender flesh. With about 25 percent less fat than 
commercially raised chickens, poussins should be marinated before 
grilling to ensure a moist bird.
 
 Poussins are relatively expensive and may not be available in all 
supermarkets. Check with your grocer — or search the Internet — for 
sources.
 
✓ Quail: These tiny birds cook very quickly and have a delicate flavor, so 
they’re best when simply grilled and served with marinades such as soy 
sauce and ginger. You can stuff them, but their size makes it difficult. A 
reasonable serving would be two to three quail per person, but one quail 
with greens can make a terrific appetizer.
 
✓ Squab: Squab is a nice name for a young pigeon, but we’re not talking 
about those sooty urban rooftop dwellers. We’re talking about a nice 
plump woodlands or farm-raised pigeon, which, like grouse, has a red 
meatiness and is delicious with lusty red-wine marinades. Wild pigeons 
are exceedingly difficult to find, but the poultry industry has created 
a tender, delicious, featherless breed that also goes by the name rock 
dove. One bird per person is a good portion. Squabs are best when 
roasted on a spit and braised.
 
As purveyors of fresh game and other gourmet products, a fast-growing 
family company, D’Artagnan, is seeing to it that Americans have a steady 
supply of fresh game birds (both wild and farm-raised) at their local super-
markets and specialty grocery stores. D’Artagnan raises and distributes 
fresh quail, pheasant, squab, duck, and poussin. If you live in an area with-
out a supermarket that carries fresh game, you can mail-order it direct from 
D’Artagnan. You can contact the company by calling 1-800-327-8246 or by

Rock Cornish Game Hens with 
 
Molasses-Rum Marinade
Cook these lovely hens directly over the heat of the grill, basting frequently with the 
delicious Molasses-Rum marinade. A few wood chunks — mesquite, maple, pecan, or 
hickory wood — mixed into the charcoal briquettes can add a subtle layer of pleasant, 
smoky flavor.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 8 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 25 minutes
Yield: 2 to 4 servings
2 Rock Cornish game hens, each about 1
1⁄4 to 
1
1⁄2 pounds, split in half (see the sidebar 
“Splitting hens”)
1 tablespoon butter
1
1⁄2 teaspoons curry powder
1⁄4 cup dark rum
2 tablespoons molasses
1⁄3 cup fresh orange juice
Juice of 1 large lime (about 2 tablespoons)
1⁄2 teaspoon grated lime peel
1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
1 large clove garlic, peeled and crushed
1 teaspoon seeded and chopped jalapeño 
pepper
 1 Rinse the hen halves thoroughly under cold running water; pat dry with paper 
towels. Place the hen halves in a large, resealable plastic bag or a nonreactive shallow 
container big enough to hold them snugly in one layer.
 2 Melt the butter in a small saucepan, being careful not to let it brown. Stir in the curry 
powder and cook the mixture for 1 minute, stirring; remove the saucepan from the heat. 
Carefully add the rum and molasses.
 3 Stir in the orange and lime juices, grated lime peel, salt, garlic, and jalapeño pepper; 
pour the marinade over the hens. Seal the bag, pressing out the air, or cover the con-
tainer. Refrigerate for 8 hours, or overnight, turning the hens occasionally.
 4 Prepare a direct, medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 5 Remove the hens from the marinade. Reserve the marinade.
 6 Place the hens, skin side down on a well-oiled grill grid, directly over the heat. Cover 
the grill and cook for a total of 25 minutes, turning and basting with the marinade every 
8 minutes during the first 16 minutes. The hens are cooked when an instant-read ther-
mometer registers 180 degrees or the juices run clear.

Place the hen breast side up and using a pair of 
poultry shears, cut along the breastbone from 
the cavity to the neck end. Gently pry open the 
two sides. Turn the hen over and cut along one 
side of the backbone, cutting the hen in half. Cut 
along the other side of the backbone to remove 
and discard it.

Whole Game Hens with Asian Flavors
In this recipe, the hens are first grilled indirectly for about 1 hour and then shifted 
directly over the fire for a few minutes to nicely brown and crisp the skin. They are 
sauced twice — once with a sake-soy marinade and then again with a sweet-and-spicy 
basting sauce of honey, cloves, lemon juice, and Tabasco.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 to 6 hours
Grilling time: 1 hour and 10 minutes
Yield: 2 to 4 servings
2 Cornish game hens, each about 1
1⁄4 to 1
1⁄2 
pounds
1⁄2 cup sake or dry sherry
1⁄2 cup plus 2 teaspoons soy sauce, divided
1⁄4 cup honey, divided
1⁄2 teaspoon ground ginger
Pepper to taste
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1⁄4 teaspoon ground cloves
Generous dash Tabasco sauce, or to taste
 1 Remove the giblets from the cavity of the hens; wrap and freeze the giblets for adding 
to soups or stocks, if desired. Rinse the hens thoroughly in cold running water; pat dry 
with paper towels and place in a nonreactive shallow container that’s large enough to 
hold them snugly side by side.
 2 In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, combine the following marinade ingredients: 
sake or dry sherry, 
1⁄2 cup of the soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of the honey, ginger, and 
pepper. Pour the marinade over the hens and refrigerate, covered, for 4 to 6 hours.
 3 Prepare a hot, indirect fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill, with a drip pan containing 
about 1 cup of water. (Flip to Chapter 1 for instructions on building an indirect fire.)
 4 Remove the hens from the marinade, discarding the marinade.
 5 As the grill heats, in a small bowl combine the remaining 2 tablespoons honey and 
2 teaspoons soy sauce, the lemon juice, cloves, and the Tabasco sauce to make a 
basting glaze.
 6 Place the hens on the grill grid, over the drip pan, opposite the fire, breast side up; baste 
the hens with the glaze. Cover the grill and cook for 1 hour, turning the hens over and 
basting with glaze about every 20 minutes (but not during the last 20 minutes). Be sure to 
add fresh briquettes about every 30 minutes to maintain the heat in a charcoal grill.
 7 Move the hens to the side of the grill directly over the fire; grill, breast side down, 
covered, for 3 to 5 minutes. Turn the hens breast side up and grill, covered, for 3 to 5 
minutes more or until the juices run clear or an instant-read thermometer inserted 
between the breast and thigh reads 180 degrees. (Watch the hens closely to avoid 
charring the skin over direct heat. Move them back to indirect heat, if necessary, to 
finish cooking.)

 8 Let the hens rest about 5 minutes before serving. If desired, boil the drip pan juices for 
1 to 2 minutes before spooning over the grilled hens.

rilling fish is a job that causes many folks 
to feel like, well, fish out of water. This fear 
of fish isn’t surprising. The flesh of fish is very 
delicate, so you can overcook it on the grill before 
you realize what’s happening. But don’t worry! 
Here we give you all kinds of tips on how to know 
when fish is properly cooked and how to avoid 
drying it out.
Grilling imparts a terrific flavor to the flesh of fish. 
Beyond that, the health benefits of eating fish are 
clear: It has a low fat content and omega-3 fatty 
acids that can lower your cholesterol. Grilling 
shellfish, on the other hand, may sound like an 
odd idea, but it really can be deliciously tasty 
when cooked over an open fire.
In this chapter, we give you a primer on seafood’s 
place in today’s ecologically conscious society 
and introduce you to some delectable — and 
some less common — ways to prepare it.
 
The words fish and seafood aren’t interchangeable. Seafood encompasses all 
edible creatures that live in the sea, including shellfish and swimming fish. 
So even though all fish is seafood, not all seafood is fish. And there’s another 
little semantics twist: Even if the fish, mussels, or shellfish come from freshwa-
ter lakes, rivers, or streams, the term seafood still applies.

More Fish at Market, if Fewer 
Fish in the Sea
Never before have so many species of fish been available at the market. 
Increasingly, you can now find once-rare species available at your market, 
including tilapia, orange roughy, branzino, orata, mahi-mahi, ling cod, Arctic 
char, Dungeness crab, and many species of oysters like Kumomotos and 
Olympias. Largely this is due to Americans’ increased appetite for fish, espe-
cially as a healthy alternative to red meat. But we also attribute it to a huge 
increase in fish farming around the world.
The growth in fish farming is the result of a sharp decrease in the amount of 
wild fish available, which can be blamed on overfishing, pollution of waters, 
and even global warming. Many wild fish, like Chilean sea bass, Gulf redfish, 
and certain species of salmon have gone on and off the endangered species 
list over the past decade. For those fishes that are caught in the wild, there’s 
a growing interest in what’s called sustainable seafood, or seafood that isn’t 
currently endangered by overfishing.
Many of the species that aren’t overfished are actually among the healthiest 
species, owing to their being high in beneficial omega-3 fatty acids. These fish 
include catfish, Pacific halibut, Atlantic mackerel, sardines, shrimp, striped 
bass, and sturgeon.
 
Be careful when buying fish that’s said to be “wild”; if it is indeed wild, it may 
be a dwindling species, including grouper, monkfish, conch, and bluefin tuna. 
It may even have levels of mercury poisoning that may be dangerous for 
human consumption. Your best bet is always to use a reputable fishmonger 
rather than a supermarket seafood counter.
If you’re concerned about seafood and its impact on the environment, 
visit the Web sites for these organizations: Seafood Choices Alliance (www.
seafoodchoices.com) and The Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Web 
Watch (www.mbayaq.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp).
Cooking Fresh Fish by the Cut
Fish taken fresh from the sea or rivers has a taste unlike anything else. And 
anyone disliking fish because it is, well, fishy, just hasn’t tasted a truly fresh 
fish. A fish just out of water, properly dressed and scaled and then grilled, 
is one of the purest of all culinary pleasures. Anglers take justifiable pride in 
bringing home fish of this quality.

261
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 
The French have a saying about fish: If a fish smells like fish, it’s not fresh fish. 
When shopping for fresh fish, here are some guidelines:
 
✓ Let your nose — not your eye — guide you. The one foolproof way to 
tell if a fish is fresh is to put your nose right up to it, especially near the 
gills. If you get a strong whiff of fishiness, move on.
 
✓ Don’t buy fish that’s stacked up on top of ice. When frozen fish is poorly 
handled, it invariably loses its fresh smell and flavor, emerging from the 
freezer with a mushy or mealy texture and more than a whiff of fishiness. 
A good fish seller buries the fish in ice. Another option is to purchase 
fish that have been flash-frozen — at –60 degrees right onboard gigantic 
trawlers — which can maintain the freshness of fish much better than 
catching a fish and letting it sit around on ice for a few days.
 
✓ If you buy or store frozen fish, the best place to thaw it is in the 
refrigerator. Let it defrost slowly — 24 hours is best — and when the 
fish has come to refrigerator temperature, look for a nice plump, shiny 
appearance. Never, ever refreeze fish.
 
✓ Visit your seafood market frequently and get to know the owner. Let 
it be known that you expect good quality and good service. Show that 
you’re serious about getting the best quality, and the owner will deliver 
the goods.
For some examples of less-traditional fish that grill well, see Figure 15-1.
 
Throughout this book, we recommend using a large, resealable plastic bag to 
marinate food. However, fish is best marinated in a shallow nonreactive (not 
metal) baking dish. With its very delicate flesh, fish should lie secure and flat 
in the dish with the marinade swirling around it. Tossing fish into a plastic 
bag may cause tender fillets to fall apart into small, impossible-to-grill pieces. 
Exceptions to this rule are, of course, shrimp and scallops.
Fish steaks: The thick and easy cut
If you feel a little uneasy about your ability to grill fish, try thick cuts, espe-
cially steaks and kebabs, first. You should have no problem with these cuts.
 
If fish steaks are sliced too thin, they will dry out on the grill and then will be 
more likely to fall apart. So have the fishmonger cut the steaks from 1 to 1
1⁄2 
inches thick for best results. See the section “Being gentle with fillets” later in 
this chapter for tips on grilling thin fish fillets.

262

These fish 
varieties

lent grilling 
choices.
 
Timing is still important, but with fish steaks you can at least blink without 
worrying that your fish is going to overcook. Follow these guidelines to 
achieve a perfectly grilled fish steak:
 
✓ Grill fish steaks directly over moderately hot coals, turning the steaks 
only once. A moderately hot fire gives you plenty of heat to develop a 
nice brown sear and cook the fish thoroughly, but not so much that the 
surface blackens or burns.

263
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 
✓ Be mindful of the variables that affect cooking time. Most 1-inch fish 
steaks cook in about 8 minutes and continue to cook a little more after 
they’re removed from the grill. However, cooking times vary according 
to wind, air temperature, and the heat intensity of your grill.
 
✓ Check the interior of the fish for doneness a few minutes before you 
expect it to be done. Use a thin-bladed knife to peek between the layers 
of flesh. Generally, when the flesh is no longer translucent, but rather 
opaque, and the knife meets no resistance, the fish is cooked.
 
✓ Remove fish steaks a few seconds shy of their fully cooked time, 
because fish continue to cook after you remove them from the grill.
Fish steaks need little adornment in the way of seasoning. You can marinate 
or simply brush them with a little oil and some seasonings before grilling.
 
Grilled Swordfish Steak with 
 
Chipotle Salsa
Chipotles (chee-POHT-lehz) are smoked jalapeño peppers that are sold two ways: 
canned in adobo (ah-DOH-boh) sauce or dried. Dried chipotles require reconstituting in 
boiling water for about 40 minutes. Chipotles add bold smoky flavor to food and are a 
perfect seasoning ingredient for grilled fish, poultry or beef, salsas, salad dressings, 
mayonnaise, and compound butters. Here, canned chipotles are mixed into a tomato 
and onion salsa that’s served over grilled swordfish. Make the salsa 1 to 2 hours before 
serving to give the flavors a chance to develop.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Marinating time: 15 to 20 minutes
Grilling time: 8 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Chipotle Salsa
Yield: 2 cups
2 cups cored, seeded, and diced plum 
tomatoes
1 small onion, peeled and diced (about 
1⁄3 cup)
2 chipotle peppers (canned in adobo sauce), 
undrained and finely minced
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro 
(coriander) leaves
Juice of half a lime (about 2 teaspoons)
1⁄2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1⁄2 teaspoon sugar
 
 In a medium bowl, thoroughly mix all the ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for at least 
2 hours. Spoon over grilled swordfish steaks.

264
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 Rinse the swordfish steak and pat dry with paper towels. Place the steak in a flat, nonre-
active container.
 2 In a small mixing bowl, combine the lemon juice, olive oil, and salt and pepper. Pour the 
mixture over the swordfish; cover and refrigerate for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once.
 3 While the swordfish is marinating, prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 4 When the fire is ready, place the swordfish on a well-oiled grill grid. Grill for 4 to 5 min-
utes per side or until done. To check for doneness, make a small incision in the center 
of the fish with the tip of a sharp, thin-bladed knife. The fish is cooked when the flesh is 
opaque and no longer translucent. Remove the fish from the grill and place on a platter. 
Spoon Chipotle Salsa (see previous recipe) over the top of the steaks before serving.

 2 Rinse fish steaks under cold running water; pat dry with paper towels. Place the steaks 
in a shallow, nonreactive baking dish, in a single layer.
 3 In a blender container, combine the cilantro or basil, olive oil, 1 tablespoon of the red 
onion, the lime or lemon juice, grated lime or lemon peel, and salt and pepper. Blend for 
a few seconds until the mixture is a coarse puree.
 4 Remove 2
1⁄2 tablespoons of the mixture and reserve for making the salsa. Add the garlic 
to the remaining marinade (if desired). Pour the marinade over the fish steaks in the 
dish, turning to coat well. Cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes, turning once.
 5 Prepare the Avocado and Citrus Salsa by combining the avocado, orange, jalapeño 
pepper, remaining red onion, and reserved 2
1⁄2 tablespoons marinade in a medium 
mixing bowl. Cover the salsa and refrigerate until ready to use.
 6 When the fire is ready, remove the fish from the baking dish, discarding the remaining 
marinade. Place the fish steaks on a well-oiled grill grid, allowing some of the marinade 
to cling to each steak. Grill for about 8 to 10 minutes, turning once with a wide metal 
spatula. To check for doneness, make a small incision in the center of the steak with the 
tip of a thin-bladed knife. The flesh should be opaque, not translucent, when done. 
Spoon some of the Avocado and Citrus Salsa over each steak before serving.

Making heads and tails of whole fish
We believe that grilling a whole fish — head and tail intact — makes for some 
of the most delicious eating imaginable. Of course, we exempt from this 
discussion fish that may weigh several hundred pounds, like tuna, or fish 
that may take up half a backyard, like swordfish — both of which are sold as 
steaks. But grilling a beautiful smaller fish like trout, red snapper, bluefish, 
porgy, sea bass, or pompano (a fish Mark Twain said was as delicious as “the 
less criminal forms of sin”) makes even the simplest recipe a feast.

A whole fish is a good grilling choice because the skin naturally protects the 
delicate flesh from falling apart as it grills. A whole fish stays juicier and is 
easier to turn if grilled with the head intact. We aren’t unaware, however, 
that many people don’t much care for fish staring back at them while they’re 
eating, so cutting off the head is okay. A whole, beheaded fish will still retain 
more succulence and flavor than a fillet. And you can always save the fish 
head to make a good fish stock.

Whole Grilled Trout with Thyme 
 
and Almond Butter Sauce
This is one of our favorite recipes in the book, and if you’ve never before grilled a whole 
fish, you’re in for a pleasant culinary treat. The skin grills to a crisp finish while the 
flesh stays moist and succulent. Slashing the fish along both of its sides allows the sea-
sonings of olive oil, lemon juice, thyme, and garlic to permeate through the skin and 
into the tender flesh.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Grilling time: 10 minutes
Yield: 2 servings
1 rainbow trout, about 1
1⁄4 to 1
1⁄2 pounds, 
cleaned, gutted, and scaled, with head intact
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 medium cloves garlic, peeled and minced 
(about 1
1⁄2 teaspoons)
2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme, or 
3⁄4 
teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
3 to 4 fresh thyme sprigs, each about 2 to 3 
inches long
Almond Butter Sauce (see following recipe)
 1 Rinse the fish under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Make 4 or 5 1⁄ 2-
inch slashes (2 inches deep) on each side of the fish, spaced about 2 inches apart. (See 
Figure 15-2.)
 2 In a small mixing bowl, combine the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and the minced or 
dried thyme. Place the fish in a large, shallow, nonreactive dish or container. Rub the 
marinade into the slashes on both sides of the fish and into its cavity (the hollow area 
made by cleaning and gutting the fish). Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides and in 
the cavity. Place the thyme sprigs into the cavity. Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes 
to 1 hour.
 3 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill. While you’re waiting for the grill to 
preheat, prepare the Almond Butter Sauce (see the following recipe).
 4 Generously oil both sides of a hinged, wire fish basket. Remove the fish from the 
marinade, discarding any remaining marinade, and then place the fish on one side of 
the basket with its head closest to the hinged end and its tail at the handle end. (This 
ensures that the thickest part of the fish is closest to the coals when grilling in a 
charcoal kettle grill, where the basket will not lay flat.) Close the basket.
 5 Place the basket on the grid directly over the heat. Cover and grill for about 4 to 5 
minutes or until nicely browned on one side. Turn the basket over; cover and grill for 
another 4 to 5 minutes or until the fish is done. Insert a thin-bladed knife or an instant-read 
thermometer into the thickest part of the fish. When done, the flesh near the bone will 
look opaque, and the thermometer will register 140 degrees.

267
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 6 Open the basket; turn the fish onto a warm platter and drizzle the Almond Butter Sauce 
down the center of the fish. Serve by cutting down through the flesh to the backbone 
and lifting off sections between the slashes with a metal spatula or large spoon.
Vary It! To serve four, simply double the recipe and use two fish baskets or one large 
basket that holds two trout.
Almond Butter Sauce
It’s best to chop and assemble the ingredients for this sauce while your grill preheats, 
and then finish making it just before the fish is grilled.
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: Enough sauce for 1 11/4- to 11/2-pound trout
2 tablespoons butter
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons slivered almonds, coarsely 
chopped
Pepper to taste
 
 In a small saucepan, melt the butter with the lemon juice; add the almonds and cook 
over low heat until the almonds are lightly browned. Season with pepper. Remove from 
heat immediately to prevent the almonds from overbrowning.

Being gentle with fillets
Delicate whitefish fillets (like those from sole and flounder) aren’t the easiest 
cuts of fish to grill; they need some special care. Grilling is a rough cooking 
method, so laying thin, skinless fillets directly on a grill grid may cause them 
to fall apart, as can excessive marinating. Additionally, the biggest mistake 
people make when cooking fish fillets — on or off the grill — is overcooking 
them. So follow these tips:
 
✓ Grill fillets on a perforated sheet of lightly oiled heavy-duty aluminum 
foil (simply puncture the foil with fork tines). The foil supports the fillets. 
However, be aware that you won’t get that wonderful grilled, charred 
flavor — the whole point of outdoor cooking — when you use foil.
 
✓ Use a fish basket — a basket that’s shaped like a fish — which is the 
most useful basket that we’ve found. Buy fish baskets made of nonstick 
or stick-resistant material. Also look for baskets with long handles, 
which make turning the fish a bit easier. (Chapter 2 shows you what fish 
baskets look like.) Adjustable baskets conform to the shape and size 
of the fish, allowing them to hold the fish securely in place. These, too, 
should be oiled before placing the fish inside.
 
✓ Keep your grill grid clean. Fish can easily get stuck on the little particles 
of cooked food clinging to the rack.
 
✓ Coat the fish with a thin layer of oil before placing it on the grid. 
However, be sure to gently shake off most of an oil-based marinade 
before placing fish on the grid. Doing so prevents flare-ups.
 
 If you can’t find your basting brush (or you don’t want to have to wash 
it), cut an onion in half and coat the cut side lightly with oil. Stick a fork 
in the onion and rub the oil-coated side against the grid to oil it.
 
✓ Always be sure to oil the grid when it’s cold to prevent dangerous flare-ups.
 
✓ Don’t overmarinate! Fish tissue starts to react to the acid in the marinade 
and will fall apart. Thirty minutes is plenty of time to add sufficient flavor 
to most fish.
 
✓ After initially placing fish on the grid, resist any immediate attempt to move 
it around or turn it over. Letting it sear a little makes turning the fish easier.
 
✓ Never turn fillets on the grill more than once. In fact, you may not even 
have to turn the fillets at all. If the fillets are less than 1-inch thick and 
have their skin on, they will cook through with only small bits of skin 
clinging to the grid.
 
✓ Hover over your grilling fillets like a hen around her chicks. Check the 
interior for doneness with a thin-bladed knife.
 
Fillets come dressed or undressed (so to speak). Flatfish varieties, such as 
flounder, turbot, and sole, are always skinless, as is mahi-mahi. But fillets 

269
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
with their skins on (bass, salmon, and bluefish, for example) offer a natural 
barrier to the heat, which can prevent overcooking. The skin also holds the 
delicate flesh together as it grills.
 
Flatfish Fillets Grilled on Lemon Slices 
 
with Mediterranean Skillet Sauce
Want another way besides a basket to protect delicate fish fillets from the harsh heat of 
the grill? Grill them on lemon slices as we do in this recipe. The thin fillets cook without 
needing a turn, and the lemons slices make a dramatic, copper-colored plate garnish. If 
you’d like, use thin slices of red or yellow onion rather than lemons.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Grilling time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 skinless flatfish fillets (cod, haddock, sea 
bass, or flounder, for example), about 8 to 10 
ounces each
2 tablespoons olive oil
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
16 lemon slices, thinly sliced about 1/4-inch 
thick (about 3 large lemons)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Rinse the fillets under cold running water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel. 
Cut each fillet in half crosswise to make 4 pieces of fish that are about equal in size.
 3 In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, cumin, and salt and pepper. Brush both sides of 
the fillets with the mixture; cover and refrigerate for about 30 minutes to 1 hour.
 4 Prepare the Mediterranean Skillet Sauce (see the following recipe) as the fish marinates.
 5 When ready to grill your fillets, lay the lemon slices on the oiled grill, using 4 slices to 
make a square large enough to hold a piece of fish. (Refer to Figure 15-3 to see what we 
mean.) Repeat with remaining slices to make 4 squares directly over the heat. Remove 
the fish from the marinade, discarding any that remains, and then set a piece of fish on 
top of each lemon square.
 6 Cover and grill, without turning, for a total of 6 to 8 minutes or until done. To test for 
doneness, make a small incision with the tip of a sharp knife to peek into the center of 
each fillet. The flesh in the center should be opaque and moist. Final cooking time will 
depend on the actual thickness of the fillets.
 7 Remove the fish from the grill and place them on individual platters by sliding a wide 
metal spatula under the lemon slices, picking up the fish at the same time. Gently pull 
the lemon slices out from under the fish, inverting them on the platter, grilled side up. 
(They will have a bronzed, slightly caramelized look.) Spoon equal amounts of the 
Mediterranean Skillet Sauce over each fillet.

Mediterranean Skillet Sauce
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Yield: About 1 cup
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 cups cored, seeded, and chopped ripe plum 
tomatoes
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
12 pitted black ripe olives, chopped
2 tablespoons rinsed and drained capers

Seasoned and Breaded Catfish Fillets 
 
with Basil Mayonnaise
In this recipe, a bread crumb batter helps to keep the tender catfish fillets from burning 
on the grill, and the fresh basil and Tabasco sauce mayonnaise makes for a perfect com-
plementary sauce. For a lowfat dish, you can forgo the Basil Mayonnaise and serve 
these fillets with a simple drizzle of fresh lemon juice. Or use reduced fat mayonnaise — 
or fat-free yogurt combined with reduced-fat mayonnaise — for fewer calories. You can 
see this finished dish in the color photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 8 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
Basil Mayonnaise (see the following recipe)
11/2 pounds catfish fillets
1/3 cup buttermilk
1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce, or to taste
1/2 cup fine dry bread crumbs
1 teaspoon grated lemon peel
1 teaspoon dried basil
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon 
ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
4 sprigs of basil (optional)
4 lemon wedges (optional)
 1 Prepare Basil Mayonnaise (see the following recipe). Cover and refrigerate until ready 
to serve.
 2 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Rinse the fillets under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Combine the 
buttermilk and Tabasco sauce in a shallow dish. Combine the bread crumbs, lemon 
peel, basil, thyme or cumin, and salt and pepper in a second shallow dish. Dip the cat-
fish first in the buttermilk-Tabasco mixture and then coat both sides lightly in the sea-
soned bread crumb mixture.
 4 Place the fish on a well-oiled grid (directly over the heat) or in an oiled fish basket. Grill 
for about 4 to 5 minutes per side, turning once, until the fillets are opaque in the center 
and the crumb coating is lightly browned. To test for doneness, make a small incision 
with the tip of a sharp knife in the thickest part of each fillet. Catfish fillets vary, from 1/4 
to 3/4 inches thick, and so final cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillets.
 5 Using a wide spatula, carefully transfer the fillets to individual plates. Top each with a 
generous dollop of Basil Mayonnaise. Garnish with a sprig of fresh basil and a lemon 
wedge (if desired).

Throughout this book, we generally advise you to avoid using wood chips with 
foods that grill in less than 30 minutes. The smoke from chips, we feel, is too 
subtle to really have an effect on quick-grilling foods. However, the exception 
to this rule is grilling fish. Fish flesh, compared to that of beef, pork, poultry, 
and lamb, is so tender and delicate that it readily absorbs the gentle flavors of 
smoking wood chips. So feel free to throw those pre-soaked chips into the fire 
(or place them in a smoke box if you have a gas grill). They have a very pleas-
ant effect on all kinds of freshwater fish and seafood.
 
Asian-Style Salmon Fillets 
 
with Vegetables
Here’s a recipe that tops lovely, center-cut, pink, grilled salmon fillets with thin red pep-
pers, zucchini, and scallions. Center-cut salmon fillets are about 11⁄ 4 to 11⁄ 2 inches thick. 
Thinner fillets, cut from the tail end of the salmon, can easily overcook and should not 
be used for this recipe.
Salmon skin grills to a tasty crispness, so purchase fillets with their skin intact. The 
fresh, thinly sliced vegetables are set on the grill, about 5 minutes before the fish, to 
steam in an aluminum foil packet.
Preparation time: 30 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes to 1 hour
Grilling time: 7 to 10 minutes for the salmon and 10 to 15 minutes for the vegetables
Yield: 4 servings

273
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
4 center-cut salmon fillets, about 6 to 7 ounces 
each and about 11/4 to 11/2 inches thick, with 
skin intact
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 tablespoons light soy sauce
1 tablespoon water
11/2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
2 teaspoons peeled and minced fresh ginger
2 teaspoons light brown sugar, packed
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1 zucchini, cut into strips about 1/4- to 1/2-inch 
wide and 3 to 4 inches long
1 red pepper, cored, seeded, and cut into 1/4- 
to 1/2-inch-wide strips
2 scallions, white and green parts, trimmed 
and sliced into 2-inch-long strips
11/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Rinse the salmon fillets under cold running water and gently pat dry with paper towels.
 2 Remove any pin bones in the fillets. (See Figure 15-4 for tips on how to do this.)
 3 In a shallow, nonreactive baking dish, mix the sesame oil, soy sauce, water, vinegar, 
ginger, brown sugar, garlic, and red pepper flakes. Add the salmon fillets and turn them 
to coat in the marinade. Cover and refrigerate, skin side up, for about 30 minutes to l 
hour, turning occasionally.
 4 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a covered charcoal or gas grill.
 5 As the fire preheats, tear off a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil (or use two 
stacked sheets), about 14 inches long. Arrange the zucchini, red pepper strips, and 
scallions in the center of the foil; season with salt and pepper. Bring the four corners of 
the foil together to make a packet. Starting at the bottom, crimp together the open 
edges, leaving a small opening at the top of the packet.
 6 Using a metal spatula, lift the salmon fillets from the marinade to a clean plate, shaking 
off any excess marinade. Pour any remaining marinade into the foil packet over the 
vegetables. Add the vegetable oil and tightly crimp or close the opening at the top of 
the packet.
 7 Place the packet on the grill grid. Cover and cook for 4 to 5 minutes before placing the 
salmon on the grill. The vegetables need about 10 to 15 minutes total cooking time. 
Carefully peek into the packet to check for doneness after about 10 minutes; the 
vegetables should be crisp-tender. If necessary, set the packet on the edge of the grid to 
keep it warm until the fish is cooked.
 8 Place the salmon fillets skin side up, on the lightly oiled grill grid, over medium heat. 
Cover and grill for 7 to 10 minutes or until the salmon is done, turning once with a wide 
metal spatula. Insert a thin-bladed knife into the thickest part of each fillet to check for 
doneness; the fish is cooked when the pink flesh is almost opaque.
 9 Use a wide spatula to remove the fillets to a serving platter. Use tongs or a mitt to 
carefully remove the foil packet from the grid. Open the packet — watch out for the hot 
steam. Pour the vegetables and juices over the salmon fillets on the platter and serve 
immediately.

Attempting to guide people about how long to cook their fish is just as difficult 
as giving advice on how long to cook their steaks or hamburgers. Everybody 
has a preference for doneness. For example, some people like salmon well 
done, with no hint of pink in the center. Others like salmon deep pink and 
almost raw on the inside, with a sizzling, surface sear. So always treat our 
cooking times as guidelines. Peek into the flesh of the fish to test for doneness 
a few minutes before the estimated time. Fish, like other food, can be put back 
on the grid if it’s underdone to your liking, but you can’t reverse the grilling 
gears if it’s overdone.
Holy Smoked Fish, Batman!
Lightly smoked fish, which can be made at home using an ordinary covered 
charcoal grill and a steady supply of wood chips, has marvelous flavor that’s 
well worth pursuing. Here are several tips for smoking fish:
 
✓ High-fat and dark-fleshed fish are best suited for smoking because 
they’re moist enough to slow-cook and smoke — fish with less fat may 
dry out on the grill.
 
✓ Fish that’s ideal for smoking includes mackerel, salmon, tuna, swordfish, 
and marlin.
 
✓ Small fish, like mackerel and trout, can be left whole and should be wet-
cured in a solution of water, salt, sugar, and seasonings of your choice.
 
✓ You can cut larger fish (such as salmon) into fillets, steaks, or chunks 
and dry-cure them with equal parts salt and sugar, and your choice of 
seasonings. Kosher salt and brown sugar flavor the fish nicely. However, 
white sugar and regular table salt can work as well.
 
✓ Whenever possible, leave the skin on the fish — it acts as a protective 
barrier to the fire. The skin isn’t edible, however, so be sure to remove it 
after you’ve finished smoking the fish.

Smoked Salmon Fillet
A cloud of steady smoke, made by throwing handfuls of pre-soaked wood chips over 
your grill coals, permeates the delicate flesh of this dry-cured salmon, infusing it with 
incomparable flavor. If you love grilled salmon or smoked fish, you’ll enjoy making this 
recipe on your covered charcoal grill.
Preparation time: 15 minutes hands-on, 6 hours or overnight to dry-cure
Grilling time: 25 to 30 minutes
Yield: 6 main dish servings or 10 to 12 appetizer servings
2-pound salmon fillet with skin, about 1 inch at 
thickest point, rinsed and de-boned
1/4 cup coarse kosher salt
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon pepper
Oil for brushing the aluminum foil and the 
salmon
About 3 to 4 cups hardwood chips, pre-soaked
Lemon slices and watercress sprigs for 
garnish (optional)
 1 Place the fillet completely flat in a nonreactive dish or container. Mix together the salt, 
sugar, garlic powder, and pepper, and then sprinkle the mixture onto both sides of the fillet. 
Let the fish sit in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours, or overnight. (The longer, the saltier.)
 2 Half an hour before smoking the fish, prepare a small fire in a covered charcoal or gas 
grill, using about 40 briquettes for a charcoal grill. A drip pan isn’t necessary. If using a 
gas grill, set the temperature to low, about 300 degrees, and prepare an indirect fire as 
explained in Chapter 1.
 3 Cut a piece of aluminum foil about 1 inch longer and wider than the fillet. Perforate the 
foil with a fork in about 6 or 7 places and oil it lightly. Place the fillet on the foil, skin 
side down. Brush the top of the fillet lightly with oil.
 4 When the coals are hot, bank them to one side of the grill and top with 2 large handfuls 
of the pre-soaked wood chips. If you’re using a gas grill, place the wood chips in a 
smoker box. Place the fillet on the grid, opposite the coals or heat. Cover the grill, half-
closing the top vents, and cook, without turning, for about 25 to 30 minutes or until the 
flesh is firm and opaque but not dry. (The actual cooking time depends on the thickness 
of the fish and the intensity of the heat. An instant-read thermometer will register 140 
degrees in the thickest part of the fillet when done. Start testing for doneness after 20 
minutes.) Be sure to add more wood chips after about 15 minutes and as necessary to 
keep a steady supply of flavored smoke.
 5 Remove the fillet from the grill and let stand 3 to 4 minutes. Carefully invert the fillet 
onto a large platter and peel off the aluminum foil. (The skin will stick to the foil and 
should be discarded.) Invert the skinless fillet onto a second platter with the colorful 
bright flesh facing up. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or until completely 
chilled. If desired, garnish the platter with watercress and slices of fresh lemons.

Mmm, Mollusks! Clams, 
Mussels, and Scallops
Mollusks (basically, creatures with soft, unsegmented bodies protected by 
shells) such as clams, mussels, and oysters can be grilled directly on the grill 
or wrapped first in heavy-duty aluminum foil. The key is to keep the delicious 
juices in each mollusk from spilling out into the fire. It helps to place them, 
with their cup side down, facing the fire. Or, better yet, place them in an alu-
minum pan and then on the grill. The pan catches any juices that may other-
wise drip through the grid into the fire.
 
Grill only those clams, mussels, and oysters with tightly closed shells. Discard 
any with broken shells or those that don’t close when tapped. And never store 
these live mollusks in water or a plastic bag because they will die and soon 
become toxic. Instead, place them in a large bowl, uncovered, in the refrigera-
tor and use within 24 hours of purchase.
Use a stiff brush to scrub clean hard-shell clams and oysters under cold run-
ning water. Soft-shell clams, like steamers and razor clams, can hold large 
amounts of sand and grit. Soaking them in salted water with a handful of 
cornmeal for a few hours eliminates their impurities. Mussels are a little more 
difficult to clean, however. Rinse them under cold running water and pull off 
the stiff, beardlike growth attached to each shell.

Be careful not to overcook naturally tender shellfish. Remove oysters from 
the grill when they open slightly. Clams and mussels will pop wide open when 
they’re done.
 
Scallop Kebabs with Pineapple 
 
and Bacon
Scallops cook very quickly — just 2 to 4 minutes over direct heat — so these kebabs 
can be grilled as your guests are sitting down. The finished recipe is shown in the color 
photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes
Grilling time: 2 to 4 minutes
Yield: 3 to 4 servings, at 2 skewers per serving

277
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 1 Pull off and discard the small muscle attached to the side of the scallop. Rinse the scal-
lops in cold running water and pat dry thoroughly with paper towel. Set aside.
 2 Place the cut side of the pineapple on a cutting board and slice off the outer skin. Then 
slice the pineapple into 1-inch slices. Cut the core from the centers of the slices and dis-
card. Cut each slice into 6 sections.
 3 In a resealable plastic bag, combine the oil, paprika, marmalade, scallion, garlic, cilan-
tro, orange juice, lemon juice, and salt and black pepper. Reserve and set aside 1/4 cup 
of the marinade for basting. Add the scallops and pineapple to the remaining marinade 
in the bag and seal tightly. Let the scallops and pineapple marinate in the refrigerator 
for 30 minutes. While the scallops are marinating, pre-soak your wooden skewers to 
prevent them from burning.
 4 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 5 Remove the scallops and pineapple from the marinade, discarding any leftover mari-
nade. Thread the scallops, pineapple, and bacon onto the pre-soaked skewers. Weave 
the skewer in and out of the bacon to form a loose ribbon.
 6 Place the skewers on an oiled grill grid and grill over direct heat for about 1 to 2 min-
utes. Brush the kebabs with some of the reserved marinade and turn over and grill for 
another 1 to 2 minutes or until the scallops are just firm and white.

Grilled Clams and Mussels with 
 
Lemon Butter or Fresh Tomato Sauce
This recipe is the perfect help-yourself party appetizer or light summer meal. Grilled 
mollusks are also popular with football tailgaters — a little portable grill or hibachi is 
all you need to get the shells to pop open. Prepare either the Homemade Lemon Butter 
or the Fresh Tomato Sauce before leaving home, and then reheat whichever sauce you 
choose in a small saucepan, right next to the shellfish. Don’t forget to pack a loaf of 
crusty French or Italian bread to soak up the wonderful sauce.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 2 to 6 minutes
Yield: 4 main dish servings or 6 to 8 appetizer servings
36 to 40 hard-shell clams or mussels in the 
shell (or a combination of clams and mussels), 
all scrubbed clean
Lemon Butter (if desired; see following recipe) 
Fresh Tomato Sauce (if desired; see following 
recipe)
 1 Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Place mollusks in their unopened shells directly on the grill grid. (Or place them on a 
large metal baking pan to collect juices as the mollusks open.) Cover the grill and cook 
2 to 6 minutes. Remove them as soon as their shells pop wide open; place them in a 
large bowl or platter. The actual cooking time depends on the size of each mollusk and 
intensity of the heat.
 3 Move the mollusks that don’t open after about 5 minutes to a hotter spot. Discard any 
that do not eventually open. The shells will be roaring hot, so use long-handled tongs or 
a barbecue mitt to remove them from the grill.
 4 Twist off and discard the top shell, being careful not to spill the flavorful mollusk juice. 
(This is a good task for your guests!) Drizzle Homemade Lemon Butter over the grilled 
mollusks or serve with the Fresh Tomato Sauce (see the following recipes).
Homemade Lemon Butter
Preparation time: 5 minutes
Yield: 1/2 cup
4 tablespoons butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Tabasco sauce to taste (optional)
Pepper to taste

279
 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 1 Combine the butter and oil in a small saucepan on top of the stove over low heat (or to 
one side of the grill). Heat until the butter is melted.
 2 Add the mustard and use a wire whisk or fork to incorporate it into the butter and oil.
 3 Add the lemon juice, Tabasco sauce (if desired), and the pepper; cook and stir over low 
heat for 1 minute. Cover to keep the sauce warm, and reheat if necessary.
Vary It! For the flavors of fresh herbs, add 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander), 
basil, or Italian parsley to the butter sauce.

2 tablespoons butter
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced 
(about 1 tablespoon)
3 ripe plum tomatoes, seeded and finely 
chopped (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup bottled clam juice
Juice of half a lemon (about 11/2 tablespoons)
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil or Italian 
parsley
Black pepper to taste
 1 Heat the oil and butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and 
cook briefly for 1 minute, or until very lightly browned.
 2 Add the tomatoes, clam juice, lemon juice, and red pepper flakes; simmer over medium 
heat for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring often. Remove from the heat.
 3 Just before serving, add the chopped basil or parsley and the pepper. Pour the sauce 
over grilled mussels and clams that are set into a large serving bowl. Serve immediately 
with crusty French or Italian bread.
Vary It! Serve this dish over 3/4 pound of steaming linguine, adding the clams and sauce as 
soon as the pasta is drained. If the sauce needs additional moisture, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more 
bottled clam juice.

The Softest Swimmer in the 
Sea: Soft-Shell Crabs
Soft-shell crabs, which are crabs that have lost their hard outer shell, do well 
on the grill.
 
These days, frozen soft-shell crabs are readily available year-round — and 
they’re not bad — but the best fresh soft-shell crabs start to come in mid-May, 
and the season is over before the end of summer.
 
Grilled Soft-Shell Crabs
We tested these crabs over a fire made of a combination of hardwood hickory chunks 
and charcoal. The hickory wood flavor was divine with the crab.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Grilling time: 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons olive oil
Juice of half a lemon
Grated peel of half a lemon
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil, or 
1 tablespoon dried basil
Salt and pepper to taste
Tabasco sauce to taste (optional)
8 soft-shell crabs, cleaned
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 As the fire is preheating, melt the butter in a small saucepan; add the olive oil, lemon 
juice, lemon peel, basil, and salt and pepper. If you like a hot, spicy flavor, add Tabasco 
sauce. Brush the crabs with most of the butter sauce, coating both sides.
 3 Place the crabs on a lightly oiled grid, directly over the heat. Turn and brush every 2 to 
3 minutes with any remaining basting sauce. Cook for a total of 6 to 8 minutes. The 
crabs are cooked when they appear bright red and firm to the touch.

Don’t Call Me a Shrimp (But 
Do Feed Me Some!)
Shrimp is a classic grilled dish — especially in kebabs (which you can read 
about in Chapter 8). In this section, however, we show you a unique way 
to prepare shrimp: stuffing them with pesto. We also share a famous chef’s 
recipe that’s out of this world!
 
Try not to buy shrimp that have already been shelled, deveined, and pack-
aged. This shrimp will have lost some of its freshness. Practice deveining it 
yourself (see Figure 15-5) or have your fish handler devein fresh shrimp the 
same day you plan to grill it.
 
Figure 15-5: 
Getting 
shrimp 
ready to 
grill.
 
 
Pesto Shrimp in the Shell
Grilling shrimp in their shells helps to keep the flesh moist and tender. A little pesto 
sauce stuffed into the shell adds flavor and color. If you have a wire grilling basket, 
place the pesto-stuffed shrimp in the basket so you can turn them over all at once. 
Purchase shrimp that are sized about 16 to 20 per pound. These are sold as either 
extra-large or jumbo.
Even though it’s a little messy, this dish makes a terrific party appetizer; just be sure to 
hand out plenty of napkins. Set the bright-pink grilled shrimp on a large serving platter 
and garnish with lemon wedges.
Preparation time: 30 minutes (less if you start with cleaned shrimp)
Marinating time: 1 to 2 hours
Grilling time: 4 to 5 minutes
Yield: 8 to 10 appetizer servings

282
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 Rinse and drain the deveined shrimp under cold running water.
 2 Stuff about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Pesto Sauce (see the following recipe) into the vein cavity 
and between the shell and flesh of each shrimp. The shell holds the pesto stuffing in 
place as the shrimp grills.
 3 Place the stuffed shrimp in a large, flat dish and drizzle the lemon juice over them; 
season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.
 4 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a gas or charcoal grill.
 5 Place the shrimp in an oiled wire basket, directly over the heat.
 6 Grill for 4 to 5 minutes or until the shrimp are pink and opaque, turning frequently. Be 
careful not to overcook, or they will become dry and rubbery. Before serving, peel and 
taste a shrimp; serve with additional salt and pepper (if desired) on a large platter gar-
nished with lemon wedges and fresh basil.
Pesto Sauce
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 1/2 cup (approximately 8 servings at 1 tablespoon per serving)
1 1/2 pounds extra-large to jumbo shrimp (about 
24 to 28 shrimp), dark vein removed with shell 
intact
1/2 cup Pesto Sauce (see following recipe)
Juice of 1 lemon
Salt and pepper to taste
8 to 10 lemon wedges, for garnish
4 sprigs of fresh basil, for garnish
2 cups, loosely packed fresh basil leaves, 
stems removed (about 2 ounces)
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons pine nuts or walnuts
3 large cloves garlic, peeled and chopped
Salt and pepper to taste
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
 1 Rinse and pat dry the trimmed basil leaves.
 2 In the container of a food processor or blender, combine basil leaves, oil, pine nuts or 
walnuts, garlic, and salt and pepper. Blend to a fine texture but not a smooth puree, 
stopping once to scrape down the sides of the container.
 3 Add the Parmesan cheese and blend for just a few more seconds. Cover and chill until 
ready to use.
Vary It! You can also use this pesto on pasta as a sauce or as a condiment for all meats 
and fish. For a lemony pesto that works well with grilled shrimp and other fish, stir the 
grated peel of half a lemon into the finished sauce.

 Chapter 15: She Grills Seafood by the Seashore
 
Jimmy Schmidt’s Grilled 
 
Barbecued Shrimp
Jimmy Schmidt, owner of The Rattlesnake Club in Detroit, Michigan, is considered one 
of the fathers of New American Cuisine. Chef Schmidt can take a traditional dish and 
refine it to become something new and exciting, which is what he does with this recipe 
by adding sweet corn and peppers and the crunchy texture of jícama (pronounced 
HEE-kah-mah).
Chef Schmidt suggests skewering together the raw shrimp to make them easier to turn 
on the grid and to keep them from falling through the food grate. Lay 6 to 8 of the 
cleaned shrimp, side by side on your counter, but with heads and tails facing in oppo-
site directions. Run 2 pre-soaked, wooden skewers parallel to each other, through the 
shrimp. Repeat with the remaining shrimp, and you’re ready to grill.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 cup bottled or homemade barbecue sauce
1/4 cup fresh lime juice
3 tablespoons peeled and grated fresh ginger, 
divided
Tabasco sauce to taste
11/2 pounds jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 shrimp per 
pound)
1 tablespoon olive oil
Paprika to taste
Salt and pepper to taste
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander) 
leaves
Roast Corn, Peppers, and Jícama Slaw (see 
following recipe)
 1 Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 In a small bowl, combine the barbecue sauce, lime juice, 2 tablespoons of the ginger, 
and Tabasco sauce. Set aside.
 3 Peel, devein, and rinse the shrimp (refer to Figure 15-5), leaving the tail shells intact.
 4 In a medium bowl, toss together the shrimp, olive oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon 
grated ginger. Season with paprika and salt and pepper.
 5 Place the shrimp on a well-oiled grill grid, (skewering, if desired, as described in the 
introduction to this recipe), directly over the heat. Grill for about 3 minutes; turn and 
brush with the barbecue-lime sauce. Grill for another 2 to 3 minutes or until the shrimp 
are pink. (Be careful not to overcook, or the shrimp will become tough and rubbery. If 
you’d like, remove them from the grill just before they’re fully cooked. The stored heat 
energy in each shrimp will finish cooking it.) Transfer the shrimp to the edges of a large 
serving platter and brush with more of the barbecue-lime sauce.
 6 Mound the slaw (see following recipe) in the center of the platter. Arrange the shrimp 
around the slaw, slightly overlapping. Sprinkle the cilantro over the shrimp and serve 
immediately.

Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
Roast Corn, Peppers, and Jícama Slaw
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Chilling time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 servings
2 ears fresh sweet corn, husks on, silk 
removed
2 red bell peppers, cut into fine julienne
1 jícama root, peeled and cut into fine julienne 
(about 2 cups)
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 cup fresh lime juice
1 bunch scallions, green parts only, very finely 
chopped
1 clove garlic, peeled and finely minced
Salt and black pepper to taste
Red pepper flakes (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Place the ears of corn wrapped in their husks, with silk removed, on the grid; cook until 
well browned on all sides, for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the corn from the grid and 
allow to cool.
 3 Stand an ear of grilled corn upright on a flat dish and use a knife to scrape or cut the 
kernels off the cob. Repeat with the second ear. Transfer the kernels to a medium 
mixing bowl; add the peppers, jícama, olive oil, lime juice, scallions, and garlic; stir 
until well combined. Season with the salt and black pepper and red pepper flakes (if 
desired). Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving.
Vary It! If you have trouble locating jícama, you can substitute a small green cabbage or 
head of bok choy.

▶ Getting tips on grilling a range of veggies
▶ Dishing out warm and cool sides
T
hink “grilling” and you won’t immediately 
think of vegetables — but oh, are you miss-
ing something if you haven’t tried grilling these 
fresh foods! In this chapter, we show you how to 
successfully grill vegetables — every time you try. 
From corn to summer squash, we cover the gamut 
here.
And since every good dish deserves a side order, 
we give you some of the tastiest sides to try — 
from an array of wonderful salads to a terrific 
Middle Eastern rice dish. If you’re bitten by the 
grill bug, you’ll have to face an important fact: You 
spend most of your energy tending the fire and 
grilling the main course, so the last thing you want 
to have to do is give yourself more pressure trying 
to assemble a bunch of complicated side dishes. 
So, in this chapter, we promise not to torture you 
with any 25-step recipes that call for phyllo dough, 
puff pastry, or any other “I can’t handle that” ingredient.
We put our own interesting accent on many of the sides in this chapter. Our 
macaroni salad, for example, is a happy Mediterranean mixture of sun-dried 
tomatoes, black olives, basil, and lemon juice in a mayonnaise dressing. And 
our coleslaw has orange sections, ginger, and spicy jalapeño peppers. We 
hope you’re pleasantly surprised by the unusual flavors that we’ve added to 
these old favorites. The best part is that most of them take 30 minutes or less 
to prepare.

Updating Your Mom’s Veggie-Cooking 
Technique
Maybe if your mother had grilled your vegetables when you were a kid, she 
wouldn’t have had to bribe you to clean them off your plate. Grilled veg-
etables take on the wonderful smoky flavors of the grill while retaining their 
natural sweetness and crunch. Boiling, on the other hand, robs vegetables 
of flavor and precious vitamins, while sautéing and deep frying can add 
unwanted fat and calories.
It’s true that delicate veggies need tender loving care while grilling to keep 
them from charring, but the delicious end results are worth the extra effort.
Here’s a list of some vegetables that are particularly well suited for grilling:
 
✓ Asparagus 
✓ Onions 
✓ Sweet peppers
 
✓ Corn on the cob  
✓ Potatoes 
✓ Tomatoes
 
✓ Eggplant 
✓ Scallions 
✓ Zucchini
Simple seasoning (and brief 
marinating) is best
By far the simplest way to grill vegetables is to give them a brushing of oil — 
olive, peanut, corn, and safflower oils are all recommended — and a sprin-
kling of salt and pepper to taste. Other possibilities include:
 
✓ Coarse kosher salt sprinkled to taste on any vegetable, before or after 
grilling, adds great flavor.
 
✓ Ground cumin or grated lemon peel is delicious with fresh tomato slices.
 
✓ Grated fresh ginger combined with grated lemon peel, garlic seasoned 
mushrooms, and thin slices of acorn or butternut squash is a quintes-
sential East-West mix that goes well with just about everything.
 
✓ Tarragon is terrific with eggplant and summer squash.

287
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
 
✓ Hot chili powder or Tabasco sauce livens up potato planks or wedges, 
or small new potatoes.
 
✓ Chopped fresh garlic, olive oil, and basil (mixed together) are good with 
just about any grilled, smoke-infused vegetable.
Many vegetables benefit from a little marinating before grilling. However, 
unlike meat or poultry, vegetables quickly absorb the flavors of the marinade 
and require only about 30 minutes to 1 hour of soaking — in fact, any longer 
may make them soft and mushy. If you don’t have time to marinate vegeta-
bles, skip this step altogether and simply brush them with a little oil. Then 
after grilling, toss them in bottled lemon-herb vinaigrette if you like. (See 
Chapter 5 for loads of marinade recipes.)

Tossing vegetables with oil and seasonings in a large bowl before grilling is 
easier than brushing pieces individually. But don’t try this with onions; they 
will separate from rounds into rings that are almost impossible to grill. Olive 
oils or vegetable oils, with their relatively high smoking point, are the pre-
ferred choices for brushing on vegetables before grilling.
Many vegetables can be seasoned and wrapped in aluminum foil packets 
before grilling. They steam in the packet, retaining color, moisture, and 
flavor. Be sure to pierce a few holes in the top of the packet so the grill’s 
smoke can penetrate and infuse the food with flavor. To make low-calorie 
vegetable packets, use canned broth, lemon juice, and fresh herbs as season-
ings, omitting fats like butter and oil.
 
Be sure to combine only those vegetables with the same cooking times, how-
ever. For example, don’t create a packet mixed with snow peas and carrot 
pieces, unless the carrots are cut into thin julienne strips or parboiled until 
almost cooked through. Turn the packets occasionally to prevent the food 
inside from burning, especially if you’re grilling the vegetables longer than 15 
minutes.
Exercising care while grilling
You can’t slough off while grilling vegetables — vigilance is important 
because vegetables can burn quickly. A slight char is pleasing, but blackened, 
dried-out vegetables taste horrible.
Here are some quick tips for grilling vegetables:
 
✓ Be sure that your grilling surface is scraped completely clean. This 
ensures that vegetables don’t take on the flavors of other foods. After 
scraping, oil the grill grid well to prevent vegetables from sticking.
 
✓ Don’t grill vegetables over too intense a fire, or they’re sure to burn 
without cooking through. Most vegetables contain a fair amount of 

288
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
sugar, which sizzles beautifully into a light brown crust from the heat of 
the grill. But if cooked over too intense a heat, this natural sugar causes 
them to burn. A medium to medium-hot fire is plenty hot.
 
✓ Try a basket for grilling your vegetables. A hinged wire basket or a 
grill topper (see Chapter 2) is a terrific grilling gadget to keep veggies, 
especially onions, from falling through the grid. If you’re grilling directly 
on the grid, cut all vegetables large enough that they don’t slip through. 
Peppers can be halved or quartered before grilling and then sliced into 
smaller strips after.
 
✓ To determine doneness, use the skewer test. The vegetable is cooked 
if it can be easily pierced with a skewer. However, some people prefer a 
very crisp, almost raw, finish to their vegetables.
 
✓ Keep cooking times in mind as you cook a meal. When grilling veg-
etables with other long-cooking foods like chicken or beef, grill the 
vegetables first and move them to the outer edges of the grid or to a 300-
degree oven to keep them warm.

You can save time by parboiling (boiling a few minutes to soften) thick, long-
cooking vegetables like potatoes, hard-shell squash, and carrots before grill-
ing, but they taste better if you take the time to grill them directly. Cut them 
into chunks or thin slices to shorten grilling time. Only vegetables with very 
thick, inedible skins need peeling.
Simply Vegetables
In the following sections, we give you tips for grilling a range of vegetables — 
from artichokes to tomatoes! We also throw in some surefire recipes along 
the way.
Artichokes
Whole fresh artichokes should be parboiled for 20 to 25 minutes before grill-
ing over a medium-hot fire. Slice the parboiled artichoke in half lengthwise 
and, using a spoon, scrape out the inedible, prickly choke. Before grilling, 
brush the artichoke generously with oil that’s flavored with garlic and lemon 
juice, or marinate it in a lemon and mustard-flavored vinaigrette. Bottled 
artichoke hearts, packed in oil and already cooked, are easily skewered with 
other foods before grilling. (Turn to Chapter 8 for Artichoke, Mushroom, and 
Cherry Tomato Kebabs.)

289
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
Asparagus
Grilled asparagus takes on the flavor of charcoal and develops a beautiful 
brown sheen. To grill, trim off the woody ends and then peel the base to within 
3 to 4 inches of the tip. Brush the stalks with oil that’s flavored with a little 
crushed garlic and black pepper. Place the stalks perpendicular to the grill grid 
over medium-hot coals, turning so they brown on all sides. Pencil-thin stalks 
will be done in about 5 to 6 minutes, but thicker stalks can take up to 15 min-
utes. Stalks should be fork-tender before removing. Season the grilled aspara-
gus with freshly ground pepper, kosher salt, and grated lemon peel.
 
Linguine with Goat Cheese 
 
and Grilled Asparagus
This dish tosses together grilled asparagus and tomatoes, linguine, and goat cheese for 
the perfect summertime appetizer or light dinner. The asparagus and tomatoes can be 
grilled ahead of time, if you wish, and held at room temperature before the pasta is 
cooked. Just be sure not to finish cooking the pasta without having the sauce ingredi-
ents ready to go. For a version of this dish that’s not as rich in calories, omit the shal-
lots and garlic sautéed in the butter and oil.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11/2 pounds fresh asparagus, trimmed
6 large ripe plum tomatoes, cored and halved
Olive oil for brushing vegetables
Salt and pepper to taste
1 pound linguine or fettuccine
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon butter
2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
6 ounces goat cheese, at room temperature
1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Brush the asparagus and tomato halves with oil; season with salt and pepper.
 3 Place the vegetables on a lightly oiled grid. Grill the asparagus for 10 to 15 minutes, 
depending on thickness, or until lightly browned on all sides and tender when pierced 
with the thin blade of a sharp knife, turning once or twice. Grill the tomatoes for 8 to 10 
minutes or until lightly browned on both sides, but still intact, turning once. When 
they’re done, remove the vegetables from the grill and place on a cutting board; cut the 
asparagus into 11/2-inch pieces and place in a bowl. Chop the tomatoes coarsely (their 
skins will slip off easily and can be discarded) and place in the bowl with the asparagus. 
Be sure to include any tomato juices from the cutting board. Cover the bowl with foil to 
keep the vegetables warm.

290
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 4 When the asparagus and tomatoes are nearly finished grilling, bring 4 to 5 quarts of 
lightly salted water to a boil in a large covered pot; add the linguine or fettuccine. Stir 
thoroughly to separate the strands. Boil, uncovered, for 7 to 8 minutes or just until al 
dente, meaning the pasta still has some “bite” and is not overdone.
 5 As the pasta cooks, heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a small skillet; add the 
shallots and garlic and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, about 2 minutes 
or until the vegetables are wilted but not browned. (Be careful not to brown the garlic.)
 6 Before draining the pasta, use a measuring cup to carefully scoop out and reserve about 
1/4 cup of the water. When it’s ready, drain the pasta and return to the large pot.
 7 Add the grilled vegetables, the goat cheese, the sautéed shallots and garlic mixture, the 
basil, and the red pepper flakes (if desired). Toss well over medium heat for just 1 or 2 
minutes, until warmed through, adding a little of the reserved cooking water if the dish 
needs more moisture. Adjust seasoning with additional salt and pepper and serve 
immediately.
Vary It! Almost any grilled vegetables can substitute for the asparagus in this dish. Try 
grilled cubes of eggplant, rounds of zucchini or yellow squash, broccoli or cauliflower flo-
rets, mushrooms, carrots, artichoke hearts, or bell peppers. If you don’t like goat cheese, 
substitute 3 ounces each of ricotta cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.

Belgian endive
When you think of endive, you probably think of elegant summer salads and 
English teas with watercress sandwiches. Think again. Endive is grillin’ food. 
Its bitterness is mellowed when it’s roasted over a charcoal fire. Cut endive 
heads in half lengthwise and marinate them in a good-quality bottled Italian 
dressing (or make up your own vinaigrette, using lots of lemon juice, olive oil, 
and garlic). Grill the endive halves, covered, over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 
minutes or until tender, turning once and brushing frequently with marinade. 
Watch carefully so the endive doesn’t blacken or char.
Broccoli
Broccoli florets can be grilled, but they need to be blanched or parboiled 
before grilling. To do so, trim the broccoli, cutting away the thick stalks to 
within 1 inch of the crown. (You can freeze the trimmed stalks and later add 
them to soups and stocks.) Cut the crowns into florets (small clusters). Place 
the florets in a covered pot with 1 inch of lightly salted boiling water; boil for 

291
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
about 3 to 5 minutes or until just crisp-tender. Drain and rinse under cold 
running water. Place the florets in a medium mixing bowl and cover with bot-
tled salad dressing or your vinaigrette of choice. Grill, covered, on a lightly 
oiled grid or in a hinged wire basket over medium-high heat for about 8 min-
utes or until lightly browned. Turn and brush frequently with the marinade. 
Season with salt and pepper, and then serve hot or cold.

Broccoli florets also can be wrapped in heavy-duty aluminum foil with other 
vegetables that require the same amount of cooking time. For example, try 
pairing broccoli florets with cauliflower florets, sliced onion, bell pepper 
chunks, green beans, small cubes of potato, and rounds of zucchini and 
yellow squash. Add seasonings, butter or oil, and a little liquid such as broth 
or lemon juice to the foil packet; grill alongside other foods over direct heat. 
Open the packet carefully to check for doneness.
Brussels sprouts
The robust, cabbagelike flavor of Brussels sprouts stand up to the smoky fla-
vors of the grill. Before grilling, parboil trimmed sprouts for about 7 minutes 
in lightly salted water. Drain and brush with olive oil or lemon butter and grill 
on skewers or in a hinged wire basket over medium-high heat for about 12 
minutes, turning often and brushing with butter or oil.
Carrots
Grilling carrots brings out their natural sweetness. Cut carrots into 2- to 
3-inch pieces, brush with oil, and then grill directly over medium-hot coals 
for about 20 minutes, until tender, turning as necessary to brown on all sides. 
You also can first parboil in 1/2 to 1 inch of water for about 10 minutes; drain 
well and brush lightly with melted butter or oil before grilling for 10 to 15 
minutes or until tender.
Toss grilled carrots in a mixture of equal parts melted butter and brown 
sugar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add a little Grand 
Marnier or other orange liqueur, or try a little powdered ginger and crushed 
garlic. You also can wrap sliced carrots in heavy-duty foil with butter and 
seasonings and grill them (without parboiling first) over medium-high heat 
until crisp-tender.
Corn
Grilled corn on the cob is the classic summer side dish. Some recipes call 
for soaking the husks first in water for 30 minutes to prevent scorching. 
However, we find this extra step to be unnecessary.

292
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 
When you’re shopping for corn for the grill, always buy the freshest ears 
that you can find. As soon as corn is picked, its sugar begins to convert to 
starch, reducing its sweetness. Look for corn that’s sold as fresh-picked or 
is at least kept cold to slow down the sugar to starch conversion. The green 
husks should look bright and fresh, and if pierced with a fingernail, the kernels 
should squirt out a milky-white liquid.
To get started grilling, strip off 5 to 6 of the outer dark green corn husks. 
Carefully peel back the remaining husks, leaving them attached at the base of 
the ear, and remove the silky threads. Pull the husks back up and wrap them 
securely in place, using kitchen twine or a thin strip of husk. Place the ears 
on an oiled grid, over medium heat, and grill for 10 to 15 minutes, turning 
every 5 minutes. Peek beyond the husks at the kernels to determine done-
ness; the kernels should be golden yellow. When the corn is cooked, remove 
the husks, brush the ears with melted butter (about 1 tablespoon per ear), 
and season with salt and pepper to taste. Place the corn back on the grid 
(this time without the husks) and grill for 5 minutes more or until the corn is 
very lightly charred on all sides.
You can dress up melted butter for corn in endless ways. Add any of the fol-
lowing (to your taste) to melted butter for corn: lemon or lime juice, chili or 
curry powder, Tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, soy sauce, minced garlic, 
finely minced dill, basil or cilantro, dry mustard, or ground ginger. For a but-
terless, fat-free, corn-eating experience, simply squeeze fresh lemon or lime 
juice over freshly grilled ears.

If you want your corn on the cob to be served with other grilled foods, you can 
grill it in stages. Grill the ears in their husks until the kernels are golden yellow 
and then remove the ears from the grill. About 5 to 10 minutes before the rest 
of the food is ready, brush each ear with the melted butter and place back on 
the grid — without the husks — to finish cooking.
Eggplant
Some people say that eggplant is absolutely best when grilled, and boy, do 
we agree. Eggplant is a firm-textured vegetable that can be cut into large 
chunks for kebabs, sliced in half lengthwise, or sliced into rounds before grill-
ing. Sautéing eggplant on the top of the stove requires a rich amount of high-
calorie oil, but grilled eggplant needs only a thin coating of oil. If the eggplant 
is large and bitter, try reducing the bitterness by sprinkling the cut rounds 
with salt and allowing them to drain for about 30 minutes. Before grilling, 
rinse the slices or wipe off the salt with paper towels. Smaller eggplants and 
Japanese-style eggplants have little bitterness and don’t need this treatment.
To grill, cut the eggplant into 1-inch-thick slices or cubes and brush with a 
flavored oil. (See Chapter 5 for ideas on flavored oils.) Grill the pieces over a 
medium-hot fire for 10 to 12 minutes, turning every 4 to 5 minutes until lightly 

293
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
browned on all sides. Toss grilled cubes into steaming pasta or mixed green 
salads. Or use them, along with sun-dried tomatoes and black olives, as a 
topping for pizza. Small grilled slices can be wrapped around cubes of feta 
cheese or mozzarella cheese, secured with a toothpick into a roll, and served 
as an appetizer.
Garlic
Much of the world is obsessed with the incomparable power of garlic when it 
comes to enhancing grilled foods. Garlic makes just about every grilled food, 
except perhaps those with sweet flavors, taste better. A whole head of garlic 
is a cinch to grill and has dozens of delicious uses. Mix it into mayonnaise-
based dressings or rub it onto thin, toasted baguette slices with goat cheese 
and sun-dried tomatoes for a simple appetizer. Add it to salad dressings or to 
marinated vegetables or whip it with milk and butter into mashed potatoes.
To grill a whole head of garlic (see Figure 16-1), first remove any outer, loose, 
papery leaves. Slice across the top of the head, removing about 1/4 inch and 
exposing the ends of the cloves. Drizzle with a bit of olive oil and then wrap 
in foil. (If desired, tuck sprigs of fresh herbs such as rosemary or thyme 
between the cloves.) Grill over medium-high heat for 45 minutes or until the 
cloves are soft and tender, turning occasionally. Squeeze out the roasted 
cloves. Individual cloves can also be oiled and grilled on a grill topper over 
medium heat for 6 to 7 minutes per side or until tender.

Leeks
The leek, which looks like a giant scallion, makes a surprisingly good grilled 
side dish for a sizzling steak or lamb chop. Remove the green tops of the 
leeks to about 2 inches from the white base. Discard the tops. Slice the leeks 
in half lengthwise and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Gently pry 
apart the layers to clear out any sand or dirt. Drain well. Brush the leeks with 

294
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
olive oil, flavored perhaps with minced garlic and fresh or dried herbs, and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper; grill, cut side down, over medium-high heat for 
7 to 8 minutes. Brush again with some of the oil mixture, and then turn and 
grill for another 7 to 8 minutes or until tender and lightly browned.
Mushrooms
All mushrooms, whether cultivated or plucked from the wild, can be grilled. 
Mushrooms should never be soaked in water to clean them. Wipe off any 
sand or grit with a damp paper towel, or rinse quickly and pat dry thor-
oughly. Button or white mushrooms are the most common. Before grilling, 
slice off their stems so they lay flat — very large mushrooms can be halved 
or quartered before grilling. Set mushrooms directly on the grid over a 
medium-hot fire or skewer with pieces of fish, meat, or other vegetables. 
Baste them with an olive oil dressing before and during grilling. Grill about 5 
minutes per side or until lightly browned. Overgrilling makes them dry and 
tough. Remove mushrooms from the grill when you can pierce their centers 
with a sharp knife or a skewer.
 
Garlic-Grilled Portobellos
Portobello mushrooms are huge, dark brown, umbrella-shaped mushrooms with meat-
like texture and a woodsy taste that’s enriched by the subtle smokiness of the grill. 
They’re sold with or without their thick stems. Here’s a simple recipe that bastes them 
with an olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic mixture. They’re also delicious grilled and driz-
zled with Pesto Sauce. (See Chapter 15 for the pesto recipe.)
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Marinating time: 15 minutes
Grilling time: 6 to 8 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 portobello mushrooms, each about 4 to 5 
inches in diameter (about 1 pound)
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 large 
lemon)
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley

295
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Clean the portobellos by brushing off any dirt or grit with a damp paper towel. Remove 
the stems. (You can save them to later flavor soups or stocks.)
 3 In a small bowl, combine the oil, lemon juice, and garlic. Brush the caps on both sides 
with the flavored oil; sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides and let stand for 15 min-
utes, stem side up.
 4 Place the caps on a well-oiled grid, stem side up; grill for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the caps 
over and grill for another 3 to 4 minutes or until you can easily pierce them with a sharp 
knife. (Careful not to burn or overcook the mushrooms; the center should be tender 
and moist.)
 5 Remove the caps to a platter and cut into thick slices. Garnish with parsley.
Go-With: Serve with grilled hamburgers, steaks, chicken, or fish, or toss them into salad 
greens.

Onions
Something about the taste of grilled onions is so appealing. Whether yellow, 
white, or red, onions have a natural sweetness that’s released when they 
meet the heat of the grill. Yellow or red onions can be peeled and cut into 
1/2-inch-thick rounds, or they can be quartered or halved. Brush the cut sur-
face with any kind of marinade or dressing and grill over a medium-hot fire. 
Depending on the thickness, rounds need to cook for 5 to 6 minutes per side. 
Halves or quarters may take 12 to 15 minutes or more. Invariably, the rounds 
will separate into rings and fall through the grill grid, so we recommend 
placing the onions in a grilling basket or on a grill topper. (Chapter 2 has 
the information about these grilling accessories.) Onion pieces are delicious 
skewered between pieces of beef, pork, or fish.
 
Here are some ways to incorporate grilled onions into your meal:
 
✓ Grilled red onions can be served as a side dish or as a colorful ham-
burger topping. Brush 3/4-inch-thick rounds with olive oil and grill for 5 
to 6 minutes per side, until the onions are tender and lightly browned. 
Before serving, drizzle with a vinaigrette that’s flavored with plenty of 
chopped fresh herbs.

296
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 
✓ Small whole onions can be peeled and skewered or placed directly 
on the grid after being oiled or marinated. Grill for 15 minutes or until 
tender when pierced with a skewer. Serve with beef roasts (Chapter 11), 
rack of lamb (Chapter 13), or pork tenderloins (Chapter 12).
 
✓ Whole shallots look like baby onions and make a lovely garnish for other 
grilled foods. First, parboil the peeled shallots in boiling water for 2 to 
3 minutes and then brush them with oil or a marinade; skewer and grill 
over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, until just tender.
 
✓ Green, leafy scallions can be successfully grilled with little fuss or prepa-
ration and served with grilled steaks, burgers, and chops. Trim off any 
roots at the base of the white bulb and remove any limp-looking green 
leaves. Slice off the tops, leaving 3 to 4 inches of green leaves. Brush 
with oil (flavored, if you want) and grill over medium-hot coals for 8 to 
10 minutes, turning frequently to prevent them from charring; when 
done, the scallions will be lightly browned and tender through the bulb. 
Serve them whole or cut them diagonally into bite-size lengths. Scallions 
can also add flavor and decorative color to skewered kebabs of fish, 
shrimp, or chicken. (See Chapter 8.)
Parsnips
If you want to grill something different, try parsnips. Just like a carrot, a 
parsnip retains its sweet nutty flavor when grilled. Look for thick parsnips 
and scrub them clean (without peeling) under cold running water. Slice 
lengthwise or cut them into round chunks that can be skewered with other 
root vegetables. Brush them with oil or butter (flavored, if you want) and 
grill over medium-hot coals for 15 to 20 minutes, basting with additional oil 
or butter and turning every 7 minutes. (You can parboil them first to reduce 
the grilling time.) Check for doneness by piercing the thickest part with the 
tip of a sharp knife or a wooden skewer. Serve with additional melted butter, 
chopped fresh herbs, and salt and pepper. Parsnips are delicious with roasts, 
chops, or steaks. A combination of grilled carrots and parsnips, garnished 
with chopped parsley, looks lovely on a platter of thin beef or pork slices.
Peppers
We can’t heap enough praise on grilled peppers. A roasted pepper is a veg-
etable transformed to a smoky-flavored, velvet-textured delight. Whether red, 
green, yellow, or orange, roasted peppers can be used in the following ways. 
Keep in mind that this list is just for starters:

297
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
 
✓ For a simple, elegant appetizer, wrap roasted pepper strips around 
whole balls of fresh mozzarella cheese; secure with a toothpick.
 
✓ Serve strips as a salad with a balsamic vinegar dressing, black olives, 
artichoke hearts, and cubes of mozzarella cheese.
 
✓ Toss strips into steaming pasta with creamy goat cheese or with grilled 
sausages, olive oil, garlic, and herbs.
 
✓ Place on any kind of beef, pork, fish, sausage, or vegetable sandwich.
 
✓ Slice into omelets with grated fontina or mozzarella cheese.
 
✓ Place strips on toasted French bread with oil-packed sun-dried toma-
toes, fresh garlic, and chopped basil for a hearty appetizer.
 
✓ Chop and combine with diced ripe tomatoes, black olives, and capers as 
a topping for grilled fish fillets and steaks.
 
✓ Puree into a smooth sauce and use as a colorful base for whitefish fillets 
or steaks.
Potatoes
All kinds of white potatoes are appropriate for cooking on the grill. Scrub 
them without peeling, and then leave them whole or cut them into rounds, 
ovals, wedges, or chunks before grilling.
Whole baking potatoes can be ember-roasted with or without a foil wrap. 
Wash and prick the potato with a fork in several places. Oil the skin and place 
the potato directly into the hot coals for about 40 minutes or until tender and 
the skin is completely charred. Pierce each potato with a skewer to check 
doneness. Cut in half and add butter, salt, and pepper. Don’t eat the skin 
though! To enjoy the skin of an ember-roasted potato, wrap raw, oil-brushed 
potatoes in heavy-duty or double-thick aluminum foil and nestle in the hot 
coals. Cook until tender.
Individually foil-wrapped Idaho or other baking potatoes can also be placed 
directly above a medium-hot fire and cooked, covered, alongside a roast if 
desired, for 30 to 35 minutes or until tender, turning every 15 minutes. When 
they’re tender, remove the foil, brush the skins lightly with oil, and place 
the potatoes back on the grill grid for 10 minutes or until the skins are crisp, 
turning once. The potatoes are done when they can be easily pierced with 
the thin blade of a sharp knife, a skewer, or the tines of a fork.

Grilled New Potato Salad 
 
with Fresh Mint
Small red potatoes, or new potatoes, as they are also called, are wonderful when skew-
ered or randomly scattered on the grill to cook until browned and fork-tender. This 
recipe tosses them, after grilling, in a garlicky olive oil and mint dressing. To see this 
tasty side dish, check out the color photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 15 to 20 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
3 pounds new potatoes
2 tablespoons olive oil for coating the potatoes
1/4 cup olive oil
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint or basil leaves
3 to 4 cloves garlic, peeled and finely minced
Kosher or table salt to taste
Pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Scrub the new potatoes under cold running water and pat dry with paper towels. Cut 
the potatoes in half and place in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle olive oil over the potatoes 
and toss with a spoon to coat on all sides (use more than 2 tablespoons, if necessary).
 3 Place the potatoes on a lightly oiled grid or in an oiled, hinged wire basket or grill 
topper (see Chapter 2); cover and grill for 15 to 20 minutes or until the potatoes are 
lightly browned on all sides and tender when pierced with the thin blade of a sharp 
knife. Turn as necessary to prevent the potatoes from charring.
 4 Meanwhile, combine the 1/4 cup olive oil, mint or basil, and garlic in a serving bowl. 
Transfer the grilled potatoes to the serving bowl with the dressing; toss to coat, and 
season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately or at room temperature.
Go-With: This potato salad is delicious with pork, lamb, beef, or chicken.

Squash
Squash can be split into two types:
 
✓ Hard-shelled squash: Like potatoes, hard-shelled squash can be ember-
cooked directly in the coals, with or without a foil wrapping. Be sure to 

299
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
oil the skins well before placing them in the coals, however. Depending 
on size, they need to grill for 40 to 60 minutes or until fork tender. 
Butternut, a pear-shaped squash with deep orange flesh, can be cut 
into rounds or cubes for kebabs. If you’re in a hurry, parboil the slices, 
cubes, or halves with or without the skin; brush them with oil and grill 
over a medium-hot fire for 15 minutes or until tender.
 
✓ Summer squash: Summer squash, like zucchini, yellow squash, crook-
necks, and pattypans, are great candidates for the grill. They require no 
peeling and are delicious when marinated, basted with a flavored oil, 
or even stuffed. Grilled rounds can be tossed into omelets, salads, or 
steaming pasta or served over couscous. Smaller vegetables are prefer-
able because they have tender skin, few seeds, and fresh (some might 
even say sweet) flavor.
 
 Cut zucchini and yellow squash into rounds or cubes for kebabs, or slice 
lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick strips. Grill over a medium to medium-hot 
fire for 10 to 12 minutes or until lightly browned on both sides.
 
Stuffed Summer Squash
This delicious recipe stuffs summer squash with a mixture of cornbread, red peppers, 
and thyme. You can use your own cornbread recipe or a commercial mix, or you can 
buy corn muffins and break them apart into crumbs. If the cornbread is very moist and 
fresh, be sure to dry it out for 10 minutes in a 325-degree oven before adding it to the 
other stuffing ingredients. These stuffed squash make lovely side dishes for any grilled 
meat, fish, or poultry.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 20 to 30 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 medium zucchini or summer squash or a 
combination of both, each about 8 to 10 
ounces
1/4 cup olive oil, divided
1/3 cup peeled and finely chopped red or 
yellow onion
1/3 cup finely chopped red bell pepper
1 small jalapeño pepper, seeded and chopped 
(optional)
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 cup crumbled, dried cornbread (see 
instructions at beginning of recipe)
11/2 teaspoons chopped fresh marjoram, or 1/2 
teaspoon dried marjoram
11/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme, or 1/2 
teaspoon dried thyme
Salt and pepper to taste
11/2 tablespoons butter

300
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 Slice the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the pulp with a teaspoon, leaving a shell 
about 1/4- to 1/3-inch thick. Finely chop the scooped-out squash pulp; set the shells and 
chopped pulp aside.
 2 Prepare a hot, indirect fire in a charcoal or gas grill. (See Chapter 1 for complete 
directions.)
 3 In a small skillet or sauté pan over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil; add 
the chopped squash, onion, red pepper, jalapeño pepper (if desired), and garlic. Cook 
for 5 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat 
and add the cornbread, marjoram, thyme, and salt and pepper; stir to combine.
 4 Brush the outsides of the squash shells with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil; sprinkle 
the inside lightly with salt and place the shells, cut side down, on a lightly oiled grill 
grid. Grill, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the shell edges are lightly browned. 
Remove from the heat.
 5 Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the squash mixture into each squash shell, mounding 
slightly. Dot the stuffing with butter. Place the stuffed squash on the side of the grid 
opposite the heat; cover the grill and cook for 20 to 25 minutes or until the squash is 
tender when pierced with the thin blade of a sharp knife. Serve hot or at room 
temperature.
Vary It! Add any one of the following to the stuffing mixture:
 
• 
1/3 cup chopped mushrooms
 
• 
1/3 cup cooked corn kernels
 
• 
1/3 cup finely grated Parmesan or Cheddar cheese
 
• 
1/3 cup finely chopped cooked shrimp or cooked ground sausage

Sweet potatoes
Delicious, vitamin-A-packed sweet potatoes are superior grilling food. They 
can be sliced lengthwise into long ovals or wedges, cut crosswise into thin 
rounds, or cubed and grilled on skewers. You may also place them in a 
wire grill basket. Brush thin slices or cubes lightly with oil flavored with 
garlic, salt, and pepper. Grill over medium-hot coals for 15 to 20 minutes 
until tender. To reduce the grilling time, cook pieces in boiling water until 
nearly tender, 6 to 8 minutes; then grill an equal amount of time until nicely 
browned.

301
 Chapter 16: Not for Vegetarians Only: Vegetables and Side Dishes
Individually wrap whole sweet potatoes in heavy-duty or double-thickness 
aluminum foil. Pierce the foil several times with a fork and grill for 40 min-
utes over a medium fire or until soft and tender. Serve with butter, a drizzle 
of maple syrup or honey, and salt and pepper to taste. Or complement the 
sweetness of the potato with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice and a pat of 
butter, forgoing the sweeteners.
Sweet potatoes can also be cooked directly in hot coals rather than over 
them. Scrub the potatoes clean and oil the skins lightly. Push them down 
into the coals; cook for 40 minutes or until tender, giving them a quarter turn 
every 15 minutes. The final result is a potato with completely blackened ined-
ible skin and a fluffy interior. Grilled sweet potatoes are great for a camping 
trip, and are terrific with pork or turkey dishes.
 
Grand Marnier Grilled 
 
Sweet Potatoes
A splash of Grand Marnier (or other orange liqueur), a little brown sugar, a bit of all-
spice, and the heat of the grill flavor these wedges of sweet potatoes.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 10 to 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11/2 to 2 pounds sweet potatoes (about 3 
medium)
1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed
1/4 cup Grand Marnier or other orange liqueur
3/4 teaspoon ground allspice
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 As the grill preheats, peel the sweet potatoes and cut each into 6 wedges. (To cut them 
into wedges, slice the potatoes in half lengthwise and then slice each half into thirds.)
 3 Place the potatoes in a medium saucepan with lightly salted water to cover. Cover and 
bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 minutes or until 
the potatoes are barely tender when pierced with the thin blade of a sharp knife. (Avoid 
overcooking or they will start to fall apart. You want them to finish cooking on the grill.) 
Drain immediately in a colander and run cold water over them briefly. Drain again and 
set aside.
 4 In a small saucepan, melt the butter over very low heat; add the brown sugar, Grand 
Marnier or other liqueur, and allspice. Whisk (or use a fork to stir the mixture) until the 
sugar is completely dissolved. Immediately remove from the heat and season with salt 
and pepper. Brush the sauce onto both sides of the sweet potato wedges. Reserve the 
remaining sauce.

302
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 5 Place the wedges on a lightly oiled grid. Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, brushing with the 
butter mixture and turning to expose each side to the heat of the grill. When done, the 
potatoes will be fork-tender and lightly charred at their ends and edges. Remove to a 
serving platter and drizzle with the reserved basting sauce.
Go-With: Serve these sweet potatoes with pork, chicken, beef, or lamb.

Tomatoes
Tomatoes, which are plentiful, ripe, and full of flavor in the summer when 
most of us cook outdoors, are simple to grill. Red, round tomatoes — also 
known as globe tomatoes — are best when they’re cored and sliced in half 
or into 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Then simply brush them with oil or butter that’s 
flavored with garlic and chopped herbs. Grill them over a medium-hot fire 
from 2 to 5 minutes, depending on the thickness, turning once. Overcooking 
causes the tomatoes to fall apart. Cook only until heated through and very 
lightly browned. Grilled tomatoes are a fine accompaniment to hamburgers, 
steaks, and any kind of chop or grilled fish.
Whole cherry and small plum or Roma tomatoes can be skewered and grilled 
until they’re lightly browned and warmed through. Turn them often to keep 
them from charring. Use square metal skewers to prevent the tomatoes from 
spinning uncontrollably when being turned. (See Chapter 8 for more tips on 
skewering.) Combine grilled cherry tomatoes with chopped fresh basil and 
grated Parmesan or Romano cheese to make a delicious, impromptu sauce 
for steaming pasta.
 
To draw out the most flavor in fresh tomatoes, keep them at room tempera-
ture and away from heat and direct sunlight. Refrigerating tomatoes dimin-
ishes their taste.

Grilled Tomatoes with Cumin Butter
For an easy, complete meal, combine these grilled tomato slices with burgers, juicy 
steaks, fish steaks, or kebabs. Change the seasoning any way you wish, substituting 
other herbs and spices for the cumin. Or simply oil the tomato slices before grilling, 
and spread with softened goat cheese and chopped fresh basil after grilling.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Grilling time: 4 to 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 1/2 tablespoons butter
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
2 large, firm ripe tomatoes, sliced about 
3/4-inch thick
 1 Melt the butter in a small saucepan; remove from heat and stir in the cumin and salt 
and pepper.
 2 Brush the tomato slices on one side with half of the cumin butter. Place them, brushed 
side down, on a well-oiled grid (or on a grill topper, which is discussed in Chapter 2) 
and grill for 2 to 3 minutes or until very lightly browned on one side.
 3 Brush the tops of the tomatoes with the remaining cumin butter. Turn and grill for 2 to 
3 minutes more or until very lightly browned, but not falling apart. If the tomatoes 
brown too quickly, move them to the edge of the grill to finish cooking.

Not Grilled, but Still Good: 
Warm and Cozy Sides
When grilling on chilly early-spring or late-fall days (or for you die-hard grill-
ers who shovel through snow to get to the grill), you may want something 
more comforting than a cool salad with your meal. So in this section, we 
include some warmer side-dish recipes that go beautifully with the meat and 
vegetable dishes in Parts III and IV. Make these on your stovetop or in your 
oven, and let them cook while you head out to the grill.

Couscous with Apples, 
 
Onions, and Raisins
Precooked couscous cooks in about 5 minutes and is a pleasant alternative to rice or 
noodles. Made from the same semolina wheat as pasta, couscous can be dressed up 
with a variety of seasonings and vegetables. It’s exceptionally tasty when cooked in a 
beef or chicken stock, such as in this recipe. We give this dish a slightly sweetened 
slant by adding apple, pecans, raisins, and cinnamon. It makes a lovely bed of grain on 
which to serve the Apple and Tarragon Pork Kebabs in Chapter 8.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Cooking time: 5 minutes
Yield: 5 to 6 servings
1 tablespoon butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 large onion, peeled and finely chopped 
(about 1 cup)
1 large firm apple (such as Granny Smith or 
Golden Delicious), peeled, cored, and diced
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 10-ounce package precooked couscous 
(about 11/2 cups)
2 1/2 cups fresh or canned chicken broth, 
heated to boiling
1/3 cup dark raisins
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander) or 
parsley
1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Heat the butter and oil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion 
and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion wilts, about 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in the 
apple and cinnamon and cook for 1 more minute.
 2 Add the couscous, boiling chicken broth, and raisins; stir to combine. Cover tightly, 
remove from heat, and let stand for 5 minutes. Just before serving, stir in the coriander 
or parsley and the walnuts or pecans (if desired). Season with salt and pepper.
Go-With: This couscous dish is especially good with grilled pork (Chapter 12), grilled lamb 
(Chapter 13), or beef kebabs (Chapter 8).

Middle Eastern Rice
This top-of-the-stove rice casserole is a mix of pleasing flavors — turmeric, cinnamon, 
pine nuts, and parsley.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Cooking time: 25 minutes
Yield: 4 to 5 servings
1 tablespoon butter
11/2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
3 tablespoons peeled and chopped onion
1 large clove garlic, peeled and minced
1 cup long-grain white rice
1 teaspoon turmeric
13/4 cup chicken broth (heated just to boiling)
1/4 cup dark or golden raisins (optional)
1 lemon slice, seeds removed, about 1/4-inch 
thick
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup pine nuts
1 large plum tomato or Roma tomato, chopped
3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
 1 In a sauté pan with a heavy bottom or in a casserole designed for stovetop cooking, 
melt the butter with 1 tablespoon of the oil over medium-low heat. Add the onion and 
garlic and cook until the vegetables start to soften, about 3 minutes, stirring 
occasionally.
 2 Add the rice and the turmeric to the pan; cook for about 3 minutes over medium heat, 
stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. Add the hot broth, raisins (if desired), 
lemon slice, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, stir with a fork, and then reduce the 
heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes or until the rice is cooked and the 
liquid is evaporated.
 3 While the rice cooks, heat a small skillet or fry pan over medium heat; add the pine nuts 
and toast for 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the skillet and tossing the nuts with a fork to pre-
vent them from browning too fast. Remove them immediately from the skillet when 
lightly toasted.
 4 When the rice is cooked, stir in the toasted pine nuts, tomato, parsley, cinnamon, and 
the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil. (Omit the oil if desired.)
Go-With: Middle Eastern Rice makes an excellent side dish for just about any grilled lamb 
main course (Chapter 13). You can also serve with grilled chicken (Chapter 14) or beef 
(Chapter 11).

Cool and Refreshing Sides
On hot summer days, nothing goes better with grilled food than cool salads. 
And the perk about salads and other cool sides is that you can prepare them 
ahead of time, so they’re waiting in the fridge when you’re finished grilling.
 
Tomato and Red Onion Salad
This recipe combines some of our favorite fresh veggies available in the summer-time — 
ripe tomatoes, red onion, and fresh mint — into a salad that’s easily tossed together.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 medium, ripe tomatoes, finely chopped 
(about 2 cups)
1 small red onion, peeled and finely chopped 
(about 1/2 cup)
1/4 cup mixed, chopped fresh mint and parsley
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste

Orange-Ginger Coleslaw
Everybody has a favorite coleslaw recipe, and this is ours. We toss lots of sliced cab-
bage with fresh ginger, orange sections, carrot, and green pepper, and then we coat it 
all in a dressing that’s both sweet and sour. This salad actually tastes best if allowed to 
sit in the refrigerator for a few hours (or even a day) before serving, to blend together 
the flavors.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Chilling time: 2 to 3 hours (or overnight)
Yield: 6 to 8 servings
 1 To make the dressing, in a small bowl or measuring cup, combine the mayonnaise, 
orange juice, orange peel, vinegar, ginger (if desired), sugar, garlic, and salt and pepper.
 2 In a large salad or serving bowl, combine the remaining ingredients; pour the dressing 
over the salad and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours (or overnight) before 
serving.
Go-With: This slaw is delicious with grilled burgers (Chapter 7), chicken (Chapter 14), 
pork (Chapter 12), or beef dishes (Chapter 11).
Vary It! Omit the ginger and add 1 to 2 seeded and chopped jalapeño peppers for a hot, 
peppery slaw.

Tabbouleh
Tabbouleh — a salad that’s usually made with bulgur wheat, tomatoes, parsley, mint, 
onions, lemon juice, and olive oil — is especially good with lamb and chicken dishes. 
You can find bulgur in most major supermarkets and health food stores. To make tab-
bouleh, soak the bulgur in boiling water until soft and plump. (Read the package for 
soaking directions; they vary.) If you’d rather open a box than make your own from 
scratch, we recommend the Near East Food Products brand, which is available in any 
quality supermarket. This company makes a complete line of convenient, whole-grain 
side dishes that include tabbouleh, couscous, and rice pilaf.
Preparation time: 30 minutes, including soaking the bulgur wheat
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup bulgur wheat
1 large, ripe tomato, diced (about 1 cup)
1/2 cup peeled, seeded, and finely chopped 
cucumber
1/3 cup chopped scallions
1/3 cup finely chopped fresh mint, or 1 
tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon dried mint
1/4 cup chopped parsley
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Put the bulgur wheat in a large bowl; cover with at least 1/2 inch boiling water and let 
stand for 30 minutes or more, until the wheat is swollen and tender. (Read the package 
directions, because the soaking time can vary from 30 minutes to 2 hours.)
 2 Drain the bulgur in a colander over the sink, pressing out as much liquid as possible. 
Transfer the bulgur to a mixing bowl. Add the tomato, cucumber, scallions, mint, pars-
ley, olive oil, lemon juice, and salt and pepper. Blend well. Cover and chill before 
serving.
Vary It! You can add chopped black olives, capers, or carrots, and a clove of pressed 
garlic. You also can substitute red onion for the scallions.
Go-With: Serve with Lemony Fresh Lamb Kebabs or Chicken Tikka (both in Chapter 8), 
any of the rib recipes (Chapter 9), a grilled steak (Chapter 11), or a simple hamburger 
(Chapter 7).

This macaroni salad isn’t your usual blend of cold pasta coated with mayonnaise. 
Instead, we jazz it up with two salty-savory ingredients — sun-dried tomatoes and black 
olives — and add chopped fresh basil and lemon juice to give it a Mediterranean taste.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
1/2 pound elbow macaroni
3/4 cup mayonnaise
3 tablespoons oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, 
drained and finely chopped
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil leaves
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup peeled and diced onion
1 cup chopped celery
1/4 cup chopped pitted ripe olives
Salt and black pepper to taste
 1 Cook the macaroni in a large pot of boiling, salted water for 7 to 8 minutes, until tender 
but still firm. Turn into a colander and rinse under cold water. Drain well.
 2 In a large serving bowl, mix together the mayonnaise, sun-dried tomatoes, basil, lemon 
juice, and onion. Add the cooked macaroni and toss to coat. Gently fold in the celery 
and olives. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 
hour before serving.
Go-With: This salad is delicious with grilled chicken (Chapter 14), beef (Chapter 11), or

In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know grilled pizza
▶ Introducing the best toast ever: bruschetta
▶ Grilling fajitas and quesadillas in style
▶ Experimenting with grilled sandwiches
T
he idea of grilling sandwiches of any kind is 
of rather recent origin — which leads us to 
ask, “What took so long?” In this chapter, you find 
out how to make crusty pizzas that invite people 
to join in the cooking process. You also discover 
how to prepare an easy alternative to pizza, called 
bruschetta, and, finally, how to make quesadillas, fajitas, 
and open-faced sandwiches — all on the grill.
Giving Pizza the Third Degree
Pizzas fresh off the grill can be a complete meal or a light appetizer. Your 
kids are sure to love them, and they’re a nice change from all those hot dog 
dinners!
Play dough perfect
On your first try making dough, you may feel like you’ve got the starring role 
in an I Love Lucy episode. We provide some tips on making pizza dough, but 
the best advice is to practice. By the second or third try, you’ll have the pro-
cess down cold and be ready to invite the neighbors over for a very impres-
sive pizza party. Here are the tips:

✓ Be sure to work on a well-floured surface and to flour the rolling pin as 
well (if you use a pin to shape the dough).
 
✓ Shape the pie as evenly and thinly as possible but not so thinly that holes 
appear in the dough. Some people like a crust that’s less than 1/4-inch 
thick; others prefer it a little thicker. Just remember that when set on the 
grill, the dough gets firm immediately and also thickens slightly.
 
✓ Don’t worry about making a perfectly round shape. Free-form shapes are 
perfectly acceptable. If on the first (or even the 15th!) try your pie comes 
out looking like the boot of Italy, remember that it’s all part of the fun of 
making pizza.
 
✓ Transferring the dough to the grill is the most difficult part. If necessary, 
slide a long-handled spatula under the dough to gently loosen it from 
the countertop or work surface. You then can drape the dough over a 
floured rolling pin and carry it to the grill, supporting any loose, hanging 
dough with your free hand. Unroll the dough onto the lightly oiled grid 
and repeat with the second piece. Or shape the dough on a flat, floured 
cookie sheet; then bring the sheet to the grill and slide the dough onto 
the grid.
 
✓ You aren’t working with pie pastry, so you don’t have to worry about 
overworking the dough. If necessary, reshape the dough into a ball and 
roll it out again.
 
✓ Smaller pies are easier to manage. On your first pizza-making attempt, 
you may want to roll out 3 or 4 individual pies rather than 2 large ones. 
Small pies make great individual party appetizers.
Can you top this?
Want to have a dinner party without endless fuss and preparation? Invite 
friends over for grilled pizza. Lay out an assortment of toppings so that 
guests can design their own individual pies.
 
Don’t worry about using exact measurements. Just don’t pile on too much; 
overloading causes the thin crust to burn before the toppings are hot and 
cooked through.
As with the beloved hamburger (see Chapter 7), pizza has few topping 
restrictions; use whatever combinations you like, such as the following:
 
✓ Bottled artichoke hearts and grilled eggplant
 
✓ Pepperoni slices and mushrooms
 
✓ Black olives and capers
 
✓ Chopped anchovies or sardines, and roasted red peppers
 
✓ Sautéed or grilled peppers and onions

313
 Chapter 17: Grill to Go: Sandwiches, Pizzas, and Other Finger Foods
 
✓ Chopped cooked and drained spinach, and ground sausage or 
prosciutto
 
✓ Crisp bacon or grilled ham cubes, and bottled artichoke hearts
 
✓ Goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes
 
✓ Smoked salmon, chives, and sour cream
 
✓ Pesto sauce, bottled salsa, or tomato sauce instead of fresh tomatoes 
and grated mozzarella cheese
 
✓ Grilled eggplant and goat cheese
 
✓ Grilled portobello mushrooms and asparagus
 
✓ Cooked ground meat, shrimp, scallops, or clams, and chopped fresh 
tomatoes and basil
Chapter 16 gives you the lowdown on grilling vegetables such as eggplant, 
onions, peppers, and mushrooms.
 
Sun-Dried Tomato and Mozzarella 
 
Cheese Pizza
This recipe is the real thing — hot and crusty grilled pizza. Even though making pizza 
dough isn’t difficult, it is time-consuming, and we find that very good, ready-to-use, 
commercial pizza doughs are now sold in the dairy or frozen food section of most 
supermarkets and in authentic Italian delicatessens. Better yet, many local pizzerias will 
sell you fresh dough for pennies a pound. If you want to make your own dough, check 
out Baking For Dummies by Emily Nolan (Wiley) for a recipe.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 5 minutes
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil, 
divided
2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 pound fresh (or frozen and thawed) pizza 
dough
Olive oil for brushing dough
1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, packed 
(about 6 ounces)
1/4 cup chopped oil-packed sun-dried 
tomatoes, drained
1/4 cup chopped fresh basil
Garlic powder to taste (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste
 1 Prepare a medium-low fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 In a small saucepan or skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Add 
the chopped tomatoes and garlic; cook for 1 to 2 minutes or just until the tomatoes are 
softened, stirring occasionally. Set aside.

314
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 3 Working on a well-floured countertop, pastry board, or inverted baking sheet, divide 
the pizza dough in half. Flatten or use a floured rolling pin to shape each half into free-
form rounds, each 9 to 10 inches in diameter and about 1/4-inch thick. Don’t make a 
lip — the dough should be evenly thick right to the edge of each pie. Generously brush 
one side of each pizza with oil; place the pizzas, oiled side down, on a lightly oiled grid. 
(Transferring the dough from the counter to the grid is the toughest part of this recipe. 
See the “Play dough perfect” section for some help.)
 4 Cover and cook until very lightly golden and firm, about 2 to 5 minutes, depending on 
the heat of the grill. (Don’t let the crust get too brown.) Remove from the grill to a large 
baking sheet. Brush the tops with oil and turn over, grilled side up.
 5 Evenly spread the tomato-garlic mixture onto the grilled side of each crust; evenly dis-
tribute the mozzarella cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil. Sprinkle each with garlic 
powder (if desired) and salt and pepper. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over each pizza.
 6 Place the pizzas back on the grill. Cover and grill for 8 to 12 minutes, moving the pizzas 
to cooler spots if the bottoms get too dark. The pizza is done when the bottom of the 
crust is lightly browned and the top is hot and bubbly.
Vary It! You can substitute about 1/2 cup homemade or bottled pasta or pizza sauce for the 
sautéed tomatoes and garlic.

Adding charcoal and hardwood to the mix
For really authentic wood-fired flavor, try grilling the pizzas over a combina-
tion of charcoal and hickory or other hardwood chunks. Here’s how to pre-
pare the fire by using these fuels together:
 
1. Set several large hardwood chunks (don’t presoak them) between the 
charcoal briquettes.
 
2. Ignite the wood chunks and coals together.
 
3. When the coals have burned to a medium-low (or when you can hold 
your hand above them for 4 to 5 seconds), move the chunks to the 
outer edges of the coals.
 
 If the chunks continue to flame (rather that smolder), spritz them with 
a little water from a water bottle — not too much that the fire dies out, 
though.
Refer to Chapter 3 for more on building the perfect grilling fire.

 Chapter 17: Grill to Go: Sandwiches, Pizzas, and Other Finger Foods
Bring on the Bruschetta
Bruschetta is a lighter variation of warm garlic bread. In its most basic form, 
it’s a grilled slice of crusty Italian or French bread that’s rubbed with fresh 
garlic and coated with a good-quality olive oil. But that’s just the begin-
ning. Italian cooks pile all kinds of toppings onto this tasty morsel, turning 
bruschetta into more of an open-faced sandwich or hearty snack. Toppings 
can include chopped fresh tomato and basil, or grilled eggplant and goat 
cheese, or grilled zucchini and grated Parmesan cheese.
Oh where, oh where have the 
hardwood chunks gone?
Finding a source for a variety of hardwood 
chunks and chips can be anywhere from difficult 
to downright impossible. Hardware stores and 
other shops that sell grilling fuels don’t always 
carry hardwood. Fortunately, some producers 
and packagers of these products now offer 
mail-order service. Peoples Woods, located in 
Cumberland, Rhode Island, sells over 25 variet-
ies of hardwood chunks and chips, including 
flavors like peach, cherry, hickory, oak, sweet 
birch, and apple. Owner Don Hysko encourages 
consumers to purchase “fresh-cut” hardwood. 
It’s aged so long that it burns, but not aged so 
long that it loses its aromatic quality. You can 
contact Peoples Woods by phone (800-729-
5800) or you can visit the company Web site at 
www.char-wood.com. Try searching the 
Internet for additional hardwood sources.
 
Tomato Bruschetta
Here’s a classic recipe for Tomato Bruschetta that requires a minimum of grilling — 
only the bread slices feel the heat of the grill. You can make the chopped tomato top-
ping ahead of serving time — in fact it’s preferable to do so. This recipe makes a terrific 
appetizer.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Grilling time: 4 to 5 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes
Yield: 6 to 8 appetizer servings

316
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 In a small bowl, combine the tomatoes, basil, red onion (if desired), 2 tablespoons of 
the olive oil, the minced garlic, vinegar, and salt and pepper. Cover and let stand at 
room temperature for at least 30 minutes but not longer than 2 hours.
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Place the bread slices on an oiled grid. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes or until the bread is 
lightly toasted and golden on both sides, turning once.
 4 Remove and immediately rub the edges and one side of each slice with a garlic clove 
half. (Use a half clove for every 2 slices.) Drizzle about 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil onto the 
garlic-rubbed side of each slice.
 5 Stir the tomato mixture with a large spoon to thoroughly moisten; top each bread slice 
with about 11/2 tablespoons of the tomato mixture. Place on a platter and serve 
immediately.
Vary It! Here are some other ways to add flavor to bruschetta: Add chopped black olives 
or finely chopped prosciutto to the tomato mixture; omit the tomatoes and spread the bread 
with soft goat cheese or Gorgonzola cheese; or top with pesto or grated Parmesan cheese 
rather than the tomato mixture. See Chapter 15 for our Pesto Sauce recipe.

Fixin’ Fajitas and Fajita Fixins
Along the Tex-Mex border of the United States, fajita (fah-HEE-tah) means 
“belt” and describes the look of a raw skirt steak — the diaphragm muscle of 
cattle originally used for fajitas.
A skirt steak can weigh from 1 to 2 pounds and is best grilled whole and then 
sliced into thin juicy strips. Slightly chewy but very tasty, skirt steaks benefit 
from a long marinating time. You can substitute less expensive flank steak, 
but, it’s thicker and takes a few more minutes to grill.
2 large red ripe tomatoes (about 11/4 pounds), 
cored, seeded, and diced
1/2 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil
2 tablespoons peeled and diced red onion 
(optional)
About 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 clove garlic, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon balsamic or red wine vinegar
Salt and pepper to taste
12 slices crusty French bread, cut diagonally 
about 3/4-inch thick
3 cloves garlic, peeled and halved

317
 Chapter 17: Grill to Go: Sandwiches, Pizzas, and Other Finger Foods
 
Even though they aren’t difficult to make, fajitas do require a game plan; you 
need to bring the meat, vegetables, and tortillas to the table all at once and 
sizzling hot. Mexican restaurants usually present fajitas on cast-iron skillets 
that retain the food’s heat. Home cooks can use their ovens or the edges of 
the grill to accomplish the same thing. Here are some pointers:
 
✓ Grill the vegetables first, and place them in a low oven or move them to 
the edge of the grill where they will keep warm.
 
✓ Foil-wrap and keep the tortillas warm at the edge of the grill until you’re 
ready to assemble the fajitas.
 
✓ Prepare the condiments, setting out bowls of sour cream, guacamole, 
salsa, and chopped cilantro (coriander) on the table, before grilling.
 
✓ If you can, have your guests waiting at the table for the meat to arrive 
hot and sizzling off the grill.

Best-Ever Fajitas
No one knows for sure who created the fajita, but a few stories worth their salt circulate 
about its origins. Ninfa Laurenza introduced an item similar to fajitas, called tacos al 
carbon, at her restaurant, Ninfa’s, in Houston back in 1973. The creator of the first fajita 
must marvel today at the ingredients that go into fajitas. We’ve seen everything from 
grilled chicken to lobster in fajitas, with only the wheat tortilla as a constant. We still 
think they’re best — and certainly most authentic — when made with skirt steaks, like 
this recipe.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Marinating time: 4 hours or overnight
Grilling time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
11/4 to 11/2 pounds skirt or flank steak, fat 
trimmed
1 small onion, peeled and chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 tablespoons tequila (optional)
Juice of 2 limes
Grated peel of half a lime (about 1 teaspoon)
1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and diced
2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
Salt and pepper to taste
2 medium green or red bell peppers
2 medium onions
Vegetable oil for brushing peppers and onions
8 large wheat flour tortillas, each about 8 to 9 
inches in diameter
Fresh Tomato Salsa (optional; see Chapter 6)
Sour cream (optional)
Guacamole (optional; see Chapter 6)

318
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 In a nonreactive dish or a large, resealable plastic bag, combine 1 chopped onion, 3 
tablespoons oil, tequila (if desired), lime juice, lime peel, jalapeño pepper, garlic, cumin, 
paprika, and salt and pepper. Add the steak and turn, coating it in the marinade. Cover 
the dish or seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight, turning 
occasionally.
 2 Prepare a hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 3 Meanwhile, core and seed the green bell peppers and cut each into strips about 1-inch 
thick. Peel the remaining onion and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch rounds. Brush the vegeta-
bles with vegetable oil.
 4 Wrap the tortillas in 2 aluminum foil packages of 4 each; set aside.
 5 Cook the onions and peppers on a lightly oiled grid. (Better yet, place them in a hinged 
wire basket or on a grill topper to keep them from falling through the grill grid and to 
make turning them easier.) Grill, uncovered, for 10 minutes, turning once, until tender 
and browned. When done, transfer the vegetables to a baking pan, cover with foil, and 
set on the edge of the grill or in a 300 degree oven to keep warm until ready to serve.
 6 Remove the meat from the marinade and drain briefly, reserving the marinade. Place 
the meat on the center of the grid; grill for 6 to 7 minutes for rare to medium-rare, turn-
ing and basting once with the remaining marinade. (Actual cooking time depends on the 
thickness of the steak and intensity of the heat. Thicker flank steak takes a few minutes 
longer.) Use a sharp knife to make a small incision in the center of the steak to test 
doneness. The meat should be browned on the outside and pink and juicy inside. When 
done, move the steak to a carving board and cover with foil; let rest for a few minutes 
and then slice thinly across the grain.
 7 As the steak grills, place the tortilla foil packages on the edge of the grill for about 5 
minutes to warm through, turning once. (Keep warm in foil until ready to serve.)
 8 To assemble the fajitas, place a few slices of meat and some of the grilled peppers and 
onions on each tortilla; top with salsa, sour cream, and guacamole (if desired) before 
rolling them up.

Let Them Eat Quesadillas
A classic Mexican quesadilla (kay-sah-DEE-ah) is a gooey tortilla sandwich 
filled with a cheese stuffing (queso means “cheese” in Spanish) and usually 
fried in hot oil until crisp and bubbly. Grilling eliminates almost all the calo-
ries acquired through pan-frying, with identical results.
 
Mango and Cheese Quesadillas
This unique twist on the traditional quesadilla yields a wafer-thin, crisp sandwich with a 
melted cheese filling, the wonderful sweetness of mango, and the zing of jalapeño 
pepper. You can see these colorful quesadillas in the color photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 4 minutes
Yield: 4 appetizer servings
4 large wheat tortillas, about 8 to 9 inches in 
diameter
8 ounces mozzarella, thinly sliced
1 small mango, peeled and sliced in 1/4-inch 
slices
1/2 to 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely 
chopped, or 1 to 2 teaspoons jarred chopped 
hot pepper
1/2 cup cilantro (coriander) or basil, chopped
1/2 teaspoon salt
Oil for brushing quesadillas
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Brush one side of each tortilla with oil. Place the tortillas on a cookie sheet, oil side 
down. Distribute half the cheese evenly among the tortillas on only half of each tortilla. 
Then layer the mango on top of the cheese, followed by the jalapeño pepper and the 
cilantro or basil. Now add the rest of the cheese. Sprinkle with salt. Fold the unlayered 
side of the tortilla over the side with the filling to create a half circle.
 3 Using a spatula, place the tortillas on the hot grill grid. Cover and grill until the bottoms 
are lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Using the spatula, carefully flip the tortillas. 
Cover and grill for about 2 minutes until they’re lightly browned and the cheese is 
melted. Rotate the quesadillas to cooler parts of the grill if they brown too quickly. 
When they’re done, remove them from grill and cut each one into 2 or 3 pie-shaped 
slices.

Tortilla Towers
If you like quesadillas, you’ll love this multilayered version that uses ground meat, 
barbecue-flavored onions, Monterey Jack cheese, and chopped cilantro. After it’s 
assembled, you grill the pancakelike stack to a crispy finish.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 4 to 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
3/4 pound ground beef
1/2 to 1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and thinly 
sliced
Salt and pepper to taste
1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus oil for 
brushing tortillas
2 medium onions, peeled, cut in half, and thinly 
sliced
1/2 cup favorite bottled or homemade barbecue 
sauce
12 6-inch flour tortillas
2 cups grated, loosely packed Monterey Jack 
cheese
Sour cream (optional)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro (coriander), and 
extra for garnish
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill. In a large heavy skillet or saucepan, cook 
the meat and jalapeño pepper over high heat until well browned. Use a wooden spoon to 
break up the ground meat, and stir often. Season with salt and pepper. Use a slotted spoon 
to transfer the meat mixture to a mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with foil to keep warm.
 2 Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the skillet and heat over medium heat. Add the onions; cook, 
stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the 
barbecue sauce and cook for 5 minutes more or until the onions are very tender, stir-
ring and scraping the bottom of the pan often.
 3 Brush one side of 4 tortillas with oil and place them, oiled side down, on a large cookie 
sheet. Spread the barbecued onions evenly over each of the 4 oiled tortillas. Sprinkle 1 
cup of the cheese equally over the onions on each tortilla. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon cilan-
tro over the cheese. Cover each of the 4 stacks with another tortilla. Divide and spread 
the meat mixture over each tortilla. Sprinkle each with the remaining cheese and top 
the stacks with the remaining 4 tortillas. Brush the tops with oil.
 4 Place the layered tortillas on a lightly oiled grid. Cover and grill for 2 to 3 minutes or 
until the side that’s face down on the grill is lightly browned. Using a wide metal spat-
ula, turn each tortilla carefully to avoid spilling out the ingredients, and grill, covered, 
for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the layered tortillas to individual serving plates and 
cut each into quarters. Serve with a dollop of sour cream (if desired) and a sprinkling of 
chopped cilantro.

Sandwich Face-Off
When you eat a sandwich stuffed with your favorite foods, the experience 
can range from satisfying to heavenly. Grilling adds another dimension: Both 
the bread crust and the filling can be infused with smoky, grilled flavors. The 
sandwich recipes in this section are easy to make on a backyard grill or on a 
portable hibachi hauled out to the beach.
 
Several recipes from other chapters can be quickly converted into grilled 
sandwiches and wraps. For example, use the Cajun-Style Steak Rub (Chapter 5)
on thinly cut tender steaks or chicken breasts before grilling, and then sand-
wich the meat between slices of grilled French or Italian bread. Or turn these 
dishes into sandwiches:
 
✓ Grilled Kielbasa with Creamy Mustard Sauce (Chapter 7) on grilled sour-
dough or rye bread
 
✓ Jerk-Seasoned Chicken Breasts (Chapter 14) on grilled club rolls with 
shredded lettuce, slices of avocado, and grilled tomato
 
Open-Faced Grilled Eggplant 
 
and Goat Cheese Sandwiches
This healthy-hearty sandwich stacks layers of smoky grilled eggplant, tomatoes, goat 
cheese, fresh basil, and olives on French bread. Cut into small 3-inch pieces to make 
lovely appetizers for a summer party.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 20 minutes
Yield: 4 main dish servings or 8 to 10 appetizer servings
2 small, long eggplants, about 1 pound each
4 medium, ripe tomatoes (about 1 pound total)
1 loaf French bread, about 24 inches long
1/2 cup olive oil, divided
2 large cloves garlic, peeled and pressed or 
finely minced
Salt and pepper to taste
2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
4 ounces fresh goat cheese, at room 
temperature
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil
Kalamata or other cured black olives (optional)

322
Part IV: Grilling Everything Under the Sun 
 1 Prepare a medium-hot fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Meanwhile, cut off the eggplant ends. Lay one eggplant on a cutting board and, with a 
sharp knife, cut off a thin slice lengthwise. Repeat on the opposite side. Discard these 
slices (they’re mostly peel). Slice the remaining eggplant lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick 
slices. Repeat with the second eggplant. Core the tomatoes and slice crosswise into 
1/2-inch-thick slices. Place the vegetable slices on a large baking sheet. Slice the French 
bread in half lengthwise and then in half again crosswise, making 4 slices, each about 12 
inches long.
 3 In a small bowl, combine 6 tablespoons of the olive oil and the garlic. Brush the cut 
sides of the French bread and both sides of the vegetables with the oil-garlic mixture. 
Sprinkle the vegetables with salt and pepper.
 4 Combine the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil with the balsamic vinegar; season with 
salt and pepper and set aside.
 5 Place the eggplant on a lightly oiled grid and grill for 6 to 7 minutes per side or until 
tender and lightly browned; move the eggplant to the edge of the grid to keep it warm. 
Grill the tomatoes until warmed through, 2 minutes per side. Place the French bread 
slices on the edges of the grid, cut side down; toast until golden brown, about 2 min-
utes; transfer, cut side up, to a serving platter or cutting board.
 6 Spread the goat cheese on the toasted bread slices, dividing equally. Lay the eggplant 
and then the tomato on the bread slices, covering the bread completely; drizzle with 
the oil-vinegar dressing. Garnish with the chopped basil. Cut into main dish or appe-
tizer servings. Serve with kalamata olives (if desired).
Vary It! Substitute chopped, oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes for the kalamata olives.

Warming up prebaked breads is a cinch. Here are some ways to do it:
 
✓ Garlic bread: Slash a loaf of French bread almost through and at 
1-inch intervals from end to end. Spread softened butter, flavored with 
chopped fresh garlic (or garlic salt) and chopped fresh herbs, between 
the slices. Wrap in aluminum foil and grill for 15 minutes over a medium-
hot fire, turning often.
 
✓ Grilled corn or bran muffins: Slice the muffins in half, spread the cut 
sides with softened butter, and grill over medium heat until lightly 
browned.

323
 Chapter 17: Grill to Go: Sandwiches, Pizzas, and Other Finger Foods
 
✓ Grilled polenta: Cut off 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick slices. Oil them lightly on 
both sides and grill over medium-high heat, uncovered, for 5 minutes 
per side or until lightly browned and warmed through. Set the slices 
next to or under a piece of grilled chicken, lamb, or beef. These little 
grilled polenta rounds can transform a simple dish into something imagi-
native and elegant.
 
Gorgonzola and Fig Sandwiches
Gorgonzola is a blue Italian cheese that can be purchased very pungent, fairly mild, or 
dolce, meaning “sweet,” which is a balance of both and is much creamier. If you can find 
dolce, by all means use that in this recipe. You should be able to find it at a good Italian 
grocery. Most domestic Gorgonzola is too salty. If you can’t find imported Gorgonzola, a 
good American blue or French Roquefort will do as well. Check out the color photo sec-
tion of this book to get a look at the finished sandwiches.
Preparation time: 10 minutes
Grilling time: 3 to 4 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
5 ounces Gorgonzola cheese
8 slices of round Italian loaf bread, cut into 1/2-
inch slices
4 to 6 fresh or dried figs, cut into 1/4-inch slices
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
Olive oil
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal grill, or heat a gas grill to about 350 degrees.
 2 Spread the gorgonzola cheese on four slices of the bread.
 3 Pour the balsamic vinegar into a shallow bowl. Dip the fig slices into the balsamic vine-
gar and distribute them evenly over the gorgonzola bread slices. Cover these slices 
with the plain bread slices to form a sandwich. Using a pastry brush, coat the sand-
wiches generously, on both sides, with the olive oil.
 4 Using a spatula, place the sandwiches on the heated grid and grill until the bread is 
lightly browned and the cheese is melted, about 11/2 to 2 minutes. Using the spatula, flip 
the sandwiches and grill for another 11/2 to 2 minutes. Serve as a hot appetizer.

W
hat’s a backyard barbecue without some 
sweetness and — lest we forget — adult 
drinks to sip throughout the heat of the day? This 
chapter promises not to leave you — and, in turn, 
your guests — empty-handed! Read on for tips on 
grilling fruit, which makes a healthy and delicious 
complement to savory meats and vegetables as 
well as a standalone dessert. If you’re itching 
for the alcohol, head straight to the end of the 
chapter for our favorite, most tantalizing cocktail 
recipes.
Grilled Fruit? Oh Yeah!
Grilling fruit takes a little more practice than grilling vegetables because the 
pulpiness of most fruits and the delicacy of their skin can be ruined by a grill 
that’s too hot. Nevertheless, with a little care and imagination, most fruits 
come off the grill looking very luscious and toothsome — and they’re definitely 
a surprise to most people at an outdoor party!
Don’t think of grilled fruit only as a dessert choice, however — they can be 
dazzling side dishes as well:
 
✓ Toss grilled fruit into salads.
 
✓ Use grilled fruit as a garnish.

✓ Combine sweet fruit cubes with savory chunks of vegetable, fish, meat, 
or poultry on a skewer. For example:
 
• Try mixing wedges of oranges with cubes of beef and red onion.
 
• Use pineapple wedges with cubes of smoked ham or fresh pork, 
and bell pepper strips.
 
• Combine apple wedges with chicken livers and bacon.
 
• Try using plum slices or halves and red onions with cubes of 
chicken or pork.
 
Here are some tips for grilling fruit:
 
✓ Be sure that the cooking grid is scrubbed completely clean. Leftover 
pieces of food clinging to the grid can make the delicate-flavored fruits 
taste like last night’s dinner.
 
✓ Allow the natural sugar in fruits such as oranges and figs to brown 
slightly when grilling, to bring out their rich, sweet flavors.
 
✓ Brush fruit slices, cubes, or halves with melted butter and brown sugar 
before grilling over a medium to medium-low fire.
 
✓ Brush fruit with the same tangy lemon or balsamic vinegar marinade 
used for the main dish or salad and serve as a pretty plate garnish with 
savory grilled foods. Thick orange slices look especially attractive.
 
✓ An easy, fat-free basting sauce for any grilled fruit is dry white wine 
sweetened to taste with honey. For a savory glaze that’s nice with pork 
or poultry, add Dijon-style mustard to taste.
 
✓ Half-inch slices or chunks of apples, apricots, bananas, cantaloupe, 
papaya, peaches, plums, nectarines, pineapple, and pears take about 10 
minutes to grill; turn frequently to keep them from burning.
Grilled fruits are enhanced by the bold flavors of brandy, rum, and fruit 
liqueurs. Impress your guests with this simple dessert: Skewer together 
assorted fruit chunks (such as slices of plums, nectarines, and peaches) 
that are brushed with a little melted butter and brown sugar syrup; grill 
until lightly browned and bring to the table on a warm platter. Pour 
1⁄4 cup of 
warmed brandy, rum, or fruit liqueur over the fruit and ignite the dish. Serve 
with vanilla or rum raisin ice cream. Ice cream is the best companion to 
grilled fruits.

Foil-Wrapped Baked Apples
Here’s an easy dessert that lets you complete most of the work before you get to the 
grill. Wrap the cored, nut-and-raisin-stuffed apples in sheets of foil and set them on the 
back of the grill behind other foods for your meal. If you plan it right, your baked apple 
dessert will be ready just as you finish the main course.
Be careful not to overcook these apples. Depending on the intensity of your grill’s heat, 
they only need 20 to 25 minutes. Start testing their doneness with a skewer or the tines 
of a fork after 20 minutes and then every 5 minutes after that. They turn in an instant 
from cooked through — yet still shaped like an apple — to almost applesauce. Although 
the more done version is also delicious, it’s not nearly as pretty.
Preparation time: 25 minutes
Grilling time: 20 to 25 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
4 tart apples (such as Granny Smith or 
Macintosh), about 8 ounces each
1⁄4 heaping cup chopped walnuts or pecans
1⁄4 cup light brown sugar, packed
2 heaping tablespoons raisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1⁄4 teaspoon ground allspice
2 tablespoons butter
2 tablespoons apple brandy or rum (optional)
Vanilla ice cream or sweetened whipped 
cream (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 Core the apples (see Figure 18-1) and place each on a buttered 9-inch square of 
heavy-duty aluminum foil.
 3 In a medium mixing bowl, combine the walnuts or pecans, brown sugar, raisins, 
cinnamon, and allspice; divide the mixture equally among the apples, packing it into 
their hollowed centers. Top each apple with a half tablespoon of butter. Fold up the 
edges of the foil around the apples to make a tight package.
 4 Place the foil packages on the grid; grill for 20 to 25 minutes or until the apples are 
tender when pierced with a fork. (Be careful not to overcook.) Rotate occasionally to 
different spots on the grid to ensure even cooking.
 5 Remove the apples from the grill and foil. If desired, pour 
1⁄2 tablespoon apple 
brandy or rum over the top of each and serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream 
sweetened with maple syrup or maple extract and sugar.

Grilled Figs and Prosciutto
This dish makes for an impressive appetizer or — without the mustard — an interesting 
dessert. Thin slices of prosciutto, a salt-cured ham from Italy, are wrapped around fresh 
figs. The grilled figs caramelize slightly, and the ham loses most of its fat but none of its 
delicious saltiness. The recipe calls for 4 slices of prosciutto but works with twice that 
amount for prosciutto lovers. Take a look at the color photo section in this book to see 
the finished recipe.
Preparation time: 15 minutes
Grilling time: 5 to 6 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons dry white wine
2 tablespoons honey
1 teaspoon Dijon-style mustard
4 large ripe fresh figs, quartered
4 (or 8, if desired) thin slices prosciutto or 
other spiced ham
Pepper to taste (optional)
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill. If using wooden skewers, soak them in 
water for 30 minutes to prevent them from burning.
 2 In a small saucepan, combine the wine and honey; without allowing the mixture to boil, 
stir over low heat just until the honey blends with the wine. Remove from heat and stir 
in the mustard.
 3 Thread 4 fig quarters and 1 slice (or 2 slices, if desired) of prosciutto on each of 4 skewers.
 4 Brush the figs and prosciutto with the wine-honey basting sauce and sprinkle each with 
pepper (if desired). Place the skewers on a lightly oiled grid; grill for 5 to 6 minutes, 
turning often and brushing with the basting sauce. Serve as a light appetizer over mixed 
salad greens or as a side for grilled duck, turkey, or pork.

Grilled Bananas with Caramel Sauce
A plateful of bananas from the grill is one of our favorite desserts. Because of their natu-
ral oils and sweetness, the bananas need surprisingly little or no adornment in the way 
of fancy sauces or seasonings. In this dessert recipe, we grill bananas right in their skins 
to shield the soft, sweet, edible fruit from the harsh heat of the grill. After grilling the 
bananas, drizzle them with a lovely caramel sauce. You also can forgo the rich caramel 
sauce and serve these bananas unadorned, alongside dishes like satay (Chapter 8) or 
Jerk-Seasoned Chicken Breasts (Chapter 14).
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Grilling time: 8 to 10 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
1 cup granulated sugar
1⁄3 cup water
1⁄2 teaspoon lemon juice
2⁄3 cup heavy cream
4 medium ripe but firm bananas
 1 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill.
 2 For the caramel sauce, combine the sugar, water, and lemon juice in a saucepan over 
medium-low heat. Stir with a wooden spoon for about 3 minutes, until the sugar dissolves.
 3 Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture 
reaches an amber color, about 3 to 4 minutes. (The mixture boils rather rapidly during 
these minutes.)
 4 If you want a medium-colored caramel sauce, remove the mixture from the heat while it 
is still light golden; it continues to cook and darken from the heat. For a dark caramel 
color, remove when the mixture is medium golden-brown. Remove the pan from the 
heat and gradually pour in the heavy cream, stirring with a wire whisk. (Be careful; the 
cream bubbles wildly as you pour it into the mixture.)
 5 When all the ingredients are incorporated, return the saucepan to medium-low heat and 
stir for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture is velvety. After it cools, the sauce can be 
reheated in a microwave oven or over low heat on top of the stove.
 6 Cut the bananas in half lengthwise without removing the peel; place on a lightly oiled 
grid, cut side up. Cover and grill for 8 to 10 minutes or until the flesh is warmed and 
slightly softened; spoon or cut the flesh from the peel.
 7 Place the bananas on four individual plates and spoon the hot caramel sauce over the 
bananas before serving.
Go-With: The best companion for this dessert is a rich and creamy vanilla ice cream.

Grilled Pound Cake and 
 
Fruit with Brandy Sauce
This dessert, shown in the color photo section of this book, brings together a heavenly 
combination of foods, sauces, and seasonings — grilled fruit and grilled pound cake, rum, 
brown sugar, orange peel, and vanilla ice cream. Slice the fruit as if you were preparing it 
for a pie filling; cut it first in half and then into slices about 
1⁄2- to 1-inch thick.
Preparation time: 20 minutes
Marinating time: 30 minutes
Grilling time: 12 to 14 minutes
Yield: 4 servings
2 tablespoons butter
1⁄3 cup dark rum or fruit-flavored brandy
4 medium nectarines, sliced 1-inch thick
2 large ripe purple plums, sliced 
1⁄2-inch thick
3 tablespoons brown sugar, packed
Pinch of salt
1 teaspoon grated orange peel
8 slices frozen pound cake, thawed and cut 
1⁄2-inch thick
1 pint vanilla ice cream or 2 cups sweetened 
whipped cream
 1 In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over very low heat. Add the dark rum or the 
brandy, the nectarines, and the plums. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and salt; toss to 
mix well. Cook, covered, over low heat, for 1 minute or just until heated through; 
remove from heat and sprinkle with the orange peel. Set aside for 30 minutes or longer. 
(You may prepare the fruit to this point and keep it covered until ready to grill.)
 2 Prepare a medium fire in a charcoal or gas grill. Be sure that the grill is thoroughly 
clean and free of any food particles.
 3 Remove the fruit slices from the sauce, reserving the sauce.
 4 Grill the fruit slices on a lightly oiled grid, for 7 to 10 minutes or until lightly browned on 
all sides, turning twice.
 5 After the fruit has cooked for 5 minutes, brush both sides of the pound cake slices with 
the reserved sauce; reserve the remaining sauce. Grill the pound cake for 4 minutes or 
until it’s lightly toasted on both sides, turning once.
 6 Transfer the grilled pound cake slices to individual serving plates, two to a plate, and 
top with grilled fruit slices and a scoop of vanilla ice cream or sweetened whipped 
cream. Drizzle any remaining brandy sauce over the fruit, cake, and ice cream.

Care for a Cocktail?
When it comes to outdoor cooking and the inevitable parties that sur-
round them, the cocktail hour can become almost as important as the meal 
itself. What would weekend brunch be without a pitcher of bloody marys? 
Especially in summer, Latino-influenced cocktails are favored over straight 
Scotch or bourbon on the rocks, because they usually contain some citrus 
fruits that are ideal for al fresco parties in warm weather.
In this section, I provide five cocktail recipes that will never go out of style on 
the patio or anywhere else. If you try all these drinks and want to try some 
others, check out Bartending For Dummies by Ray Foley (Wiley).
 
Classic Daiquiri
The daiquiri gets its name from the Daiquiri iron mines outside of Santiago, Cuba, 
where American miners worked after the Spanish-American War. Their chief engineer, 
Jennings Cox, came up with a cocktail they drank when work was done, using the 
island’s limes, sugar, and rum. Later on, when novelist Ernest Hemingway lived in 
Havana, and later Key West, he made the drink even more famous by having the 
bartender make it into one of the first slush drinks ever. This classic drink is shown in 
the color photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
Juice of 1 freshly squeezed lime (about 3 to 4 
tablespoons; not bottled)
1 teaspoon sugar
2 ounces rum (gold rum is best but light rum is 
fine)
 
 Place lime juice, sugar, and rum into a cocktail shaker and stir to dissolve sugar. Add 
ice cubes, shake until very cold, strain into a martini glass, and garnish with a slice of 
lime.
Vary It! For a frozen daiquiri, follow the previous instructions, except pour the ingredients 
into a blender with 
1⁄2 cup of ice and blend at high speed until you have a slushy drink. You 
can also flavor the beverage with strawberries or bananas.

Mojito Mojo
The mojito is a cooling, refreshing cocktail with the punch of mint leaves. When mixing 
this drink, it’s important to muddle (push down and twist) the mint at the bottom of the 
highball glass. Doing so helps to extract the oils and mingle them with the other ingredi-
ents. Refer to the color photo section to get a look at this refreshing cocktail.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
Juice of 1 lime (about 1 to 2 tablespoons; 
reserve the rind)
1 teaspoon sugar
3 sprigs fresh mint
2 ounces light rum
Club soda
 
 In a highball glass, place the lime juice and rind, sugar, and mint and then muddle (push 
down and twist) for about 20 seconds. Fill the glass with crushed ice, add rum and stir; 
top off with a dash of club soda. Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint.
 
Frozen Mango Martini
Martini purists will always drink their favorite cocktail made with nothing but gin and a 
dash of dry vermouth. But ever since James “007” Bond exchanged the gin for vodka, all 
bets are off, and you can now choose from plenty of variations. The mango in this 
recipe goes very nicely with either the gin or vodka martini. You can see this tasty and 
intensely-colored martini in the color photo section of this book.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 ounce Triple Sec
2 ounces vodka or gin
Juice of half a lime
2 ounces mango puree or, if unavailable, 
mango juice
1⁄2 to 1 cup ice
 
 Place all ingredients in a blender with ice and blend until slushy. Pour into martini 
glasses and garnish with a wedge of mango.

Caipirinha
This very popular Brazilian drink, shown in the color photo section, packs a wallop 
from the cachaça (pronounced kah-chah-sah) spirits that it’s based on. The cachaça 
spirits are made from sugar cane. It’s a good idea to make a pitcher of caipirinha. If you 
plan to make a pitcher, simply multiply the ingredients by the number of guests you 
plan to serve.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1 lime
1 teaspoon sugar
2 ounces cachaça
1⁄2 cup crushed ice cubes
 
 Cut the lime into quarters and place in a highball glass with the sugar. Muddle (push 
down and twist) to release the lime juice and mingle the flavors. Add the cachaça, ice 
cubes, and stir to mix. Garnish with a lime wedge.
 
The Best Bloody Mary Ever
The bloody mary actually originated at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris during the 1920s 
when vodka first was brought to the city from Russia. Harry’s bartender, Pete Pétiot, 
brought the cocktail to New York in 1933 to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis Hotel, 
where it’s still the signature drink. It has become the quintessential brunch drink, usu-
ally made in pitchers. The best way to prepare to make a bloody mary is to pour about 
2 tablespoons black peppercorns into a bottle of vodka and let sit for two or three 
weeks, giving the vodka a real bite.
Preparation time: 2 minutes
Yield: 1 serving
1
1⁄2 ounces vodka
2 ounces tomato juice
Juice of half a lemon (about 1
1⁄2 tablespoons)
2 dashes salt
1 dash black pepper
2 dashes cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce
3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
1⁄2 teaspoon horseradish
 
 Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice cubes and shake until very cold. 
Strain into a highball glass and add a celery stick.

places in America. If you’re happy with all this information,

Chapter 19
The Ten Commandments of Grilling
In This Chapter
▶ Getting some tips before you begin grilling
▶ Keeping control of fire and food
I
n this short chapter, we give some general tips that you should always 
keep in mind for the sake of safety, preparation, and getting the best 
results. A successful meal takes a lot less time than the process of thinking 
how to make it come out perfect every time.
Practice Patience with Your Fire
You should never put food on a grill that isn’t ready, so be sure to take your 
time getting the fire going. Be sure that the coals are uniformly ashy gray, and 
use the handheld test (explained in Chapter 3) to gauge the temperature. And 
remember that not all foods take well to the same fire or the same temperatures. 
Check your recipe or your grill manual to find out what temperature you 
need for each type of food.
Organize Your Grill Space
Set up a small table next to the grill with all your ingredients, utensils, serving 
platters, and so on. Get your stuff together before you light the grill so that 
all you have to do is pick up the food, the seasonings, and the plates. Grilling 
can proceed quickly, and so you have to be ready to serve food when it’s at 
its peak. After all, your burgers won’t stop cooking just so you can go grab a 
clean plate from the kitchen.

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Flavor Your Food
Grilling a hamburger, a steak, or some fish on the grill is simple and wonderful 
all on its own. But to add flavor to the food and seal that flavor in is the mark 
of a master griller. You can infuse your food with flavor with marinades, oils, 
and rubs. Marinating, which is a liquid flavor enhancer, adds moisture and is 
great for almost all foods. Oils are great for keeping delicate foods moist on the 
grill, and rubs help create a nice crispy crust. In Chapter 5, we provide tons of 
simple, tasty marinades, oils, and rubs that you can flavor your food with.
Don’t Skimp on Fuel
When getting started, be sure to build a fire that won’t lose its heat before 
you finish grilling. This is especially important with a charcoal grill. Even 
though you can always replenish your coals, it’s better to use too many than 
not enough. Just remember to spread the coals about 2 inches beyond the 
edges of the food, and if you do replenish the coals, you must wait until they 
turn ashen gray — usually about 20 minutes — before you get back to your 
ideal heat.
Police the Fire!
A fire changes constantly and demands your attention at all times. Stay 
vigilant. At the beginning of the heating process, coals will glow and have 
a flame above them. When you add food, you’ll likely have a small to large 
flare-up, so it’s essential to monitor the cooking closely at that time. If you 
leave the grill with fire licking the sides of the food, you may come back to a 
charred meal.
Later on, when the fire has died down, you want to maintain a consistent heat 
so the food cooks evenly. So replenishing the coals if they start to lose their 
glow and diminish in size is usually necessary at least once. You may need to 
replenish more times throughout a long cooking time.

339
 Chapter 19: The Ten Commandments of Grilling
Build a Fire with Different Hot Spots
A fire with different heat areas allows you to shift food around to sear, cook 
through, and keep warm. If you’re using a gas grill, set the burners to different 
temperatures to provide varying degrees of heat. Or try building an indirect 
fire in a charcoal grill. Chapter 1 provides tips on grilling indirectly.
Understand the Grilling Variables
Air temperature, wind, grill type, fuel variety, and food temperature (whether 
or not it has been refrigerated) all affect your grilling times. So you should 
use recipe cooking times only as rough estimates. As we’ve noted in many 
places in this book, a good cooking thermometer is one of the best gadgets 
you can buy for successful grilling.
 
There’s no reason you can’t grill well into fall and even in winter. (Hey, trappers 
do it all the time!) Just remember that the heat of the fire is much more 
variable when the temperature is below, say, 40 degrees and a cold wind is 
blowing. The wind can also blow the gas burner flames around, so if you have 
a cover, it’s a good idea to use it.
Figure Out When Food Is Done
Unfortunately, overcooked food doesn’t have a reverse gear to take it back to 
rare. And an overdone piece of meat is a crying shame. So be sure to hover 
over your grill and check the food often. To test for doneness, make a small 
cut in the center of the food so you can peek inside. Test frequently for 
doneness a few minutes before the end of the estimated cooking time. Use an 
instant-read thermometer (see Chapter 2) for thick chops, roasts, and whole 
poultry.
You should also gauge the searing on the outside of the food. Some folks love 
a black char and others prefer a light one. However, if you let the fire flare up 
too much, you may just get a coal-black exterior and a blood-rare interior.

340
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Sprint from the Grill to the Table
Small, thin pieces of food rapidly lose their heat after you take them off the 
grill. Heated plates are the best way to keep food hot. Aluminum foil is also 
good to have on hand. But remember that meat has to stand for five minutes 
or more until the juices settle. So, if you’re ready to take the food off the grill, 
be sure to have your diners ready and waiting at the table for finished platters. 
Also, be aware that most meats, poultry, and fish will continue to cook inside 
even after removed from the grill. Meats can sit for 10 minutes before they’re 
at their best temperature and succulence. Chapter 21 provides more tips for 
cooking for a crowd.
Relax!
Grilling is carefree cooking. Enjoy the live fire, the fresh air, the cool drink 
at your side, and the friends and family members who gather around to 
admire your burger-flipping techniques. Just don’t get distracted or stray too 
far from that grill! Within seconds, you can have a disastrous, overcooked, 
charred mess. And we guarantee you won’t be relaxed then.

Ten of Our Favorite Barbecue Joints
In This Chapter
▶ Snooping out good barbecue
▶ Highlighting the best eateries
T
he key ingredient to a true barbecue joint is long, slow grilling and 
smoking over hardwood — with no precooking or shortcuts. Marinades, 
basting sauces, and dry spices can make some difference, but in the end, the 
talent, skill, and, more often than not, the secret ingredient of the pitmaster 
make one mess of ribs or beef better than the barbecue from the place down 
the street.
Choosing a top ten is very tough for us, but here are our picks for the top ten 
barbecue places in the U.S.A. We’ve based our selection on regional variety 
as much as on good taste.
Arthur Bryant’s
1727 Brooklyn Avenue, Kansas City, Missouri;
phone: 816-231-1123; Web site: www.arthurbryantsbbq.com
Immortalized by author Calvin Trillin as one of the best restaurants in the 
world, Bryant’s is indeed one of the great barbecue legends. Although Mr. 
Bryant has gone on to that big smokehouse in the sky, his legacy has been 
maintained, and the lusciousness of his ribs, french fries, and iced beer lives 
on. The sauce still has a flavor that no one has ever pinned down, but the 
place is a lot cleaner than it used to be in the old days.
Charlie Vergos’ Rendezvous
52 S. Second Street, Memphis, Tennessee;
phone: 901-523-2746; Web site: www.hogsfly.com

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Although open only for dinner, dinner in Memphis begins at 4:30 p.m., and 
the Rendezvous is packed by 6 p.m. You’ll get some dissenters who think that 
Charlie has gone commercial, but we find his unique, dry-rubbed, unsauced 
ribs absolutely addictive. The place, which is right across from the posh 
Peabody Hotel, has been open since 1948, and you could write a social and 
business history of the South from the calling cards and newspapers pinned 
to the wall here. After you’ve eaten at the Rendezvous, you may also want 
to order from Charlie’s mail-order catalog, which is what his detractors call 
“going commercial.”
Kreuz Market
619 North Colorado (U.S. 183), Lockhart, Texas;
phone: 512-398-2361; Web site: www.kreuzmarket.com
About halfway between Austin and San Antonio, the little windswept, dusty 
town of Lockhart is home to one of the most unique beef barbecue places 
in the country. Kreuz Market has been in this town since 1900, although the 
market relocated in 1999 to a building that seats 560 people.
Pitmaster Roy Perez has spent more than two decades stoking the huge 
ovens, cooking the beef brisket until it’s smoky and tender, and serving it 
with nothing more than sauerkraut and white bread — and no sauce! The 
jalapeño-spiked sausage, the pork chop, and the pork ribs are also good, 
but this is Texas beef brisket heaven — so much so that Texas Monthly gave 
Kreuz its highest, 5-star rating for great ’cue.
Goode Company Texas Bar-B-Q
5109 Kirby Drive, Houston, Texas; 
phone: 713-522-2530; Web site: www.goodecompany.com/goodeRestaurant
BBQKirby.aspx
Curiously enough, Houston isn’t teeming with good barbecue places, 
but Goode Company runs two of the best. The original is set in a no-frills 
building where you grab a tray, get your food, and head outside into the 
Houston heat. You take a slug of Lone Star beer, and then tuck into brisket 
piled high on a po’ boy, a leg of smoked turkey, jalapeño-laced pork sausage, 
a stuffed baked potato, and some jambalaya Texacana. You nurse another 
beer, wipe your mouth, wash your hands, and then start on the big slab of 
pecan pie. Finally, you tell yourself you won’t eat again until Thursday.

 Chapter 20: Ten of Our Favorite Barbecue Joints
Carson’s
612 North Wells Street, Chicago, Illinois;
phone: 312-280-9200; Web site: www.ribs.com
Chicagoans are nothing if not fiercely competitive about their sports teams and 
their barbecue. Carson’s, now with four stores, is likely to win more votes for 
Most Valuable Rib Joint than anywhere else. The River North location is the 
original and most evocative of Chi-town cool. You start off with some hot, spicy 
wings, maybe even that Chicago classic Shrimps DeJonghe (baked with sherry, 
breadcrumbs, and cayenne pepper). Then you dig into a BBQ beef or pork 
sandwich or a slab of perfectly smoked, luscious baby back ribs. They even do 
barbecued salmon and chicken (without burning it!), and you can go as upscale 
as you like here by asking to see the wine list without anyone wincing.
Blue Smoke
116 East 27th Street, New York, New York;
phone: 212-447-7733; Web site: www.bluesmoke.com
Only in recent years has New York developed a creditable barbecue scene. 
(However, we can’t forget Sylvia’s, a soul food restaurant in Harlem, which 
has long been known for its wet, well-sauced ribs.) Blue Smoke is the creation 
of Danny Meyer, a St. Louis native who runs the very upscale restaurants 
Gramercy Tavern and The Modern. He has put all he has learned about 
regional American barbecue into this snappy, very popular place (with the 
Jazz Standard nightclub downstairs). Start off with devilled eggs, and then 
order the “Rhapsody in ’Cue” — a platter of K.C. ribs, pulled pork, smoked 
chicken, and sausage.
Lexington Barbecue No. 1
10 Highway 29-70 South, Lexington, North Carolina;
phone: 704-249-9814
You’ll hear a lot of argument about which is the best barbecue joint in 
Lexington, a town that likes to think of itself as the world capital of barbecue. 
Lexington certainly is the capital of West Carolina-style barbecue. And you 
won’t be disappointed at any of the dozen or more joints in this little town 
of about a thousand residents. You don’t come here for ribs, however. You 
come for chopped pork on a warm bun, with a vinegary, peppery sauce with 
a touch of tomato (always made in small batches throughout the day). This 
sandwich makes Lexington Barbecue No. 1 an essential stop on the ’cue tour.

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Sconyers Bar-B-Que
2250 Sconyers Way, Augusta, Georgia;
phone: 706-790-5411; Web site: www.sconyersbar-b-que.com
Run by a former mayor of Augusta whose name is honored on his street 
sign, Sconyers is a maddening place because if you don’t happen to be in 
town from Thursday through Saturday, you ain’t gonna eat at Sconyers. The 
long-time barbecue joint (established in 1956) is closed on Sunday through 
Wednesday. If you’re in town when it’s open (and fortunately it opens at 
10 a.m. and closes at 10 p.m.) you’ll have quintessential, lavishly basted, 
well-smoked Georgia ’cue — pork hash, T-loin, turkey — with hash-and-rice, 
potato salad, or cole slaw. Your willpower has no force here.
Sonny Bryan’s Smokehouse
2202 Inwood Road, Dallas, Texas;
phone: 214-357-7120; Web site: www.sonnybryans.com
The original location (there are newer clones) doesn’t look like much, which 
means it looks just the way you’d imagine a good Texas ’cue stand should. 
Low-lying, a little scuzzy inside and out, with schoolchildren’s desks as 
tables, Sonny’s has been here since 1958 and is a temple of fine barbecue 
cookery. (Sadly, Sonny is no longer with us.) The ribs are first-rate, but in 
Texas, the beef brisket is what counts, and Sonny’s is fabulous. You line up 
at the counter, put in your order, and give your initials to the counter help. 
After a couple minutes, you hear your initials called out, and before you know 
it, you’re in cow heaven.
Ono Hawaiian Foods
726 Kapahulu Avenue, Honolulu, Hawaii;
phone: 808-737-2275; Web site: www.geocities.com/napavalley/9874
The Hawaiian word “ono” means “delicious,” and while not strictly a BBQ 
joint, this is one of the best places to try true Hawaiian barbecue. Hawaiian 
barbecue is known for kahlua pig, which is juicy, very tender, and nice and 
smoky. Ono Hawaiian Foods is a no-frills place that has been around for four 
decades under owner Sueko Oh Young, who’s now semi-retired at 85 years 
old. If you visit, we recommend that you try the chicken lau lau steamed in 
banana leaves, the lomi salmon, and of course, the poi. All of these dishes 
come on the kahlua pig plate for about $13!
