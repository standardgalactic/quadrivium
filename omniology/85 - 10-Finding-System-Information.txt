Finding System Information: 
 
uname –a 
cat /etc/redhat-release 
dmidecode 
 
 
 
 
uname: 
Sometimes it is required to quickly determine details like kernel name, version, hostname, etc of the 
Linux box you are using. 
 
Even though you can find all these details in respective files present under the proc filesystem, it is easier 
to use uname utility to get these information quickly. 
 
The basic syntax of the uname command is: 
 
uname [OPTION]... 
 
Now lets look at some examples that demonstrate the usage of ‘uname’ command. 
uname without any option 
 
When the ‘uname’ command is run without any option then it prints just the kernel name. So the output 
below shows that its the ‘Linux’ kernel that is used by this system. 
 
$ uname 
Linux 
 
You can also use uname -s, which also displays the kernel name. 
 
$ uname -s 
Linux 
 
Get the network node host name using -n option 
 
Use uname -n option to fetch the network node host name of your Linux box. 
 
$ uname -n 
dev-server 
 
The output above will be the same as the output of the hostname command. 
Get kernel release using -r option 
 

uname command can also be used to fetch the kernel release information. The option -r can be used for 
this purpose. 
 
$ uname -r 
2.6.32-100.28.5.el6.x86_64 
 
Get the kernel version using -v option 
 
uname command can also be used to fetch the kernel version information. The option -v can be used for 
this purpose. 
 
$ uname -v 
#1 SMP Wed Feb 2 18:40:23 EST 2011 
 
Get the machine hardware name using -m option 
 
uname command can also be used to fetch the machine hardware name. The option -m can be used for 
this purpose. This indicates that it is a 64-bit system. 
 
$ uname -m 
x86_64 
 
Get the processor type using -p option 
 
uname command can also be used to fetch the processor type information. The option -p can be used for 
this purpose. If the uname command is not able to fetch the processor type information then it produces 
‘unknown’ in the output. 
 
$ uname -p 
x86_64 
 
Sometimes you might see ‘unknown’ as the output of this command, if uname was not able to fetch the 
information on processor type. 
Get the hardware platform using -i option 
 
uname command can also be used to fetch the hardware platform information. The option -i can be used 
for this purpose. If the uname command is not able to fetch the hardware platform information then it 
produces ‘unknown’ in the output. 
 
$ uname -i 
x86_64 
 
Sometimes you might see ‘unknown’ as the output of this command, if uname was not able to fetch the 
information about the platform. 

Get the operating system name using the -o option 
 
uname command can also be used to fetch the operating system name. The option -o can be used for this 
purpose. 
 
For example : 
 
$ uname -o 
GNU/Linux 
 
 
 
 
 
cat /etc/redhat-release: 
 
This file provides information about your system distribution and its version 
 
You can also run /etc/*rel* for systems that are not on CentOS or Redhat 
 
 
 
 
 
Dmidecode: 
 
dmidecode is a tool for dumping a computer's DMI (some say SMBIOS) table contents in a human-
readable format. This table contains a description of the system's hardware components, as well as other 
useful pieces of information such as serial numbers and BIOS revision. Thanks to this table, you can 
retrieve this information without having to probe for the actual hardware. 
 
Take a look at 
 
man dmidecode 
 
to find out all options. The most common option is the --type switch which takes one or more of the 
following keywords: 
 
bios, system, baseboard, chassis, processor, memory, cache, connector, slot 
 
You can as well specify one or more of the following numbers:
