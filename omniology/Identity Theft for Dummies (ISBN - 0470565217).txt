Identity Theft For Dummies 
xiv

Introduction
I
n this book, I tell you how to prevent identity theft and what to do if you’re 
a victim. If you’re wondering what sort of information is vulnerable and 
should be shredded, or how to reclaim your credit if you’ve been a victim, this 
is the one-stop reference for you. Today, the name of the game is making your-
self a hard target, and armed with this book, you’ll do exactly that.
About Identity Theft For Dummies
Here are some of the things you can do with this book:
 
✓ Know the signs of whether you’ve been a victim of identity theft.
 
✓ Read and understand your credit report.
 
✓ Know what to do and how to clear your name if you’re a victim.
 
✓ Find ways that help prevent you from becoming a victim.
Foolish Assumptions
Please don’t take offense, but I have made the following few assumptions 
about you (which help you use this book to its maximum potential):
 
✓ You can use a computer to surf the Internet.
 
✓ You’re up to adjusting Security settings for your computer by using the 
Control Panel, even if you’re not quite sure how to do this yet. (I tell you 
how to do this in Chapter 12.)
 
✓ You don’t give up your personal information readily.
 
✓ You’re careful about the e-mails you open.
 
✓ You’re willing to take an active part in protecting your identity.
 
✓ You’re careful about what sites you go to on the Internet.

2
Identity Theft For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book easily, I use a few style conventions:
 
✓ Terms or words that you might be unfamiliar with in the context of iden-
tity theft, I italicize and define.
 
✓ Web site addresses, or URLs, are shown in a special monofont typeface, 
like this.
 
✓ Numbered steps that you need to follow and characters you need to 
type are set in bold.
What You Don’t Have to Read
You don’t have to read anything that doesn’t pertain to what you’re inter-
ested in. In fact, you can even skip one or more chapters entirely. Don’t skip 
too many, though, because all the chapters are chock-full of useful informa-
tion and interesting content. As for the few sidebars you see in this book, 
feel free to ignore them because they contain, for the most part, tangential 
information that, while interesting, isn’t necessary for you to know in order 
to protect yourself from identity theft.
How This Book Is Organized
Identity Theft For Dummies is split into seven parts. You don’t have to read 
it sequentially, and you don’t even have to read all the sections in any par-
ticular chapter. You can use the Table of Contents and the index to find the 
information you need and quickly get your answer. In this section, I briefly 
describe what you’ll find in each part.
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft
This part defines identity theft — who it affects, how it happens, what infor-
mation is vulnerable, and how to protect that information from being stolen. 
I also cover what personal information is being stolen and what to do about 
preventing that from happening. 

3
 Introduction
Part II: Determining Whether 
You’re a Victim
The chapters in this part describe the signs to look for to determine whether 
you’re a victim. You see how you can use your bank statements as an identity 
theft prevention tool. You also see how to order and read your credit report. 
I also tell you what to look for when reviewing your bank statements, both 
checking and savings.
Part III: Being Smart with Your 
Sensitive Information
Here I give you a look at some good identity theft prevention techniques. I 
provide some tips on securing your personal information. Watching what 
you throw away and being careful what you say and do in public places and 
online are good identity theft prevention techniques. I caution you about 
using your wireless laptop computer to check that bank account in an 
Internet café or on a public computer in a library. 
Part IV: Arming Yourself against 
Potential Identity Theft
In this part, you find out who you can join forces with in the identity theft 
battle: government agencies and online companies, which help keep you 
from becoming a victim or help you if you already are a victim. I outline sev-
eral common scams identity thieves use to steal your identity. I also give you 
a rundown of identity thieves’ methods so that you won’t fall prey to their 
scams.
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic 
Information
Today, you use computers more than ever in your daily life, and this includes 
online banking and bill paying. So this part provides information on how you 
can protect your personal information while online. Also included in this part 
of the book, I review the security features of Windows, XP, Vista, and 7 to 
help you secure your computer from unwanted intrusions and viruses.

 Introduction
Where to Go from Here
From here, most folks like to browse the Table of Contents and find some-
thing about identity theft that they want to know more about. The great thing 
is that you don’t have to read the book in order, chapter by chapter. You can 
skip around and go right to the sections of the book that interest you.
If you haven’t been the victim of identity theft, you may want to focus on the 
sections that address preventing identity theft. On the other hand, if you 
have been the victim of identity theft, you may want to focus on the sections 
that address how to reclaim your good name and credit. Chapter 17 lists 
resources where you can find additional information and help.

dentity theft is the fastest growing crime in recent 
years. To fight this crime, you need to know what it is 
and who it affects. You need to know what information is 
vulnerable and how to exercise prevention so that you 
don’t become a victim. I cover all this in Part I.

n this chapter, I explain who identity theft affects, how it happens, and 
what personal information it involves. Although identity theft is pretty 
unnerving, a greater understanding of it can be empowering. After you find 
out what identity theft is all about and how it occurs, you can protect your 
personal information from falling into the wrong hands — and you’ll know 
the best way to take action if it does.
Taking a Look at the Fastest 
Growing Crime
Identity theft happens when someone (the identity thief) uses another per-
son’s personal information (such as name, Social Security Number, and 
date of birth) to fraudulently obtain credit cards or loans, open a checking 
account, or otherwise gain access to money or goods in the other person’s 
name.

10
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
Identity theft takes three primary forms: financial, criminal, and medical. 
Financial identity theft includes activities like credit card fraud, tax and mail 
fraud, passing bad checks, and so on. Of course, the identity thief’s objective 
is to not pay back any of the borrowed money but, instead, to enjoy spending 
it. Criminal identity theft is used to commit crimes in another person’s name 
and to finance criminal activities with the use of credit cards in someone 
else’s name, selling people’s identities, and even terrorism. Medical identity 
theft is when someone assumes your identity for medical reasons and/or for 
someone else to foot the bill.
In 2007, the U.S. Congress recognized the growth of identity theft and 
amended the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act (which was origi-
nally introduced in 1998), making identity theft a crime. In September 2003, 
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released the results of an impact survey 
that outlined the scope of the crime. The survey statistics show the following:
 
✓ 8.4 million Americans have been the victims of identity theft in 2007.
 
✓ The total cost of this crime to financial institutions is $49.3 billion, and 
the direct cost to consumers is $5 billion.
 
✓ The FTC noted identity theft as the fastest growing crime. The FTC will 
conduct an “Experiences of Identity Theft Victims” study with data from 
2008. The FTC is also seeking comments on “Credit Freezes: Impact and 
Effectiveness in 2008.” The results will be available in 2010.
 
✓ In 2007, identity theft led the list of top ten consumer complaints to 
the FTC.
 
Identity theft continues to be a concern for Americans, and it’s still the 
number one complaint filed with the FTC. If the economy continues on a 
downward trend, identity theft will continue to be an issue for those with 
good to excellent credit. The number of people with stellar credit is dwindling 
because of the recession the U.S. is currently experiencing. So if you have 
good to excellent credit, you need to be even more vigilant to prevent your 
identity from being stolen.
Identity theft isn’t just using someone’s stolen credit card to make purchases, 
it is actually opening accounts in someone else’s name and using them. 
Stealing the credit card is fraud but does not entail assuming the cardhold-
er’s identity. This distinction is important because when you report a stolen 
credit card, it isn’t classified as identity theft. Stolen credit cards are still 
an issue though, and you must protect your credit card(s). I discuss how to 
accomplish this task in Chapter 6.

11
 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
Some other interesting stats from the FTC study that you may find surprising are
 
✓ In more than 25 percent of all cases, the victim knows the thief.
 
✓ In 35 percent of those cases, the thief is a family member or a relative.
 
✓ Almost 50 percent of victims don’t know how their information was 
stolen.
 
✓ The average out-of-pocket expense to individuals is $500.
So who exactly are the people who fall victim to identity thieves? Read the 
upcoming sections to find out the who and the how of identity theft.
Who identity theft affects
In addition to the statistics I note earlier, the FTC survey findings show that 
identity theft can happen to anyone with credit, bank accounts, a Social 
Security Number (SSN), a date of birth (DOB), or other personal identification 
information. That is, almost every man, woman, or child is a potential target. 
Yes, even children are susceptible to identity theft because all children have 
a SSN and all children have a DOB. Identity thieves don’t care about age; they 
just want personal information that they can use to obtain credit. The credit 
bureaus will not have a file for a minor until the first application for credit 
is made. If someone is using the child’s SSN to obtain credit, there will be 
a file. There have been cases where minor children have a number of open 
accounts that they did not open, and it is a headache to clear up the mess. 
The sad part is that you can be a victim and not know right away. For exam-
ple, you may find out you’re a victim only when you go to buy a car and get 
turned down for credit because your credit report already shows you own 
three cars, but you aren’t driving any of them. If you catch identity theft 
early, however, you can minimize the amount of time and money necessary 
to clear your name.
A current trend shows that people steal their children’s or other family mem-
ber’s SSN to obtain credit. In these cases, the children are under the age of 
18 and aren’t aware that their credit is being ruined by a family member. In 
some cases, an infant’s credit has been ruined — and the child can’t even talk 
or walk yet. When these children get older, they face a tough world at a dis-
advantage of having bad credit and may not even be able to get a job based 
on their ruined credit history.
 
Anyone, even a celebrity, can become a victim of identity theft. For instance, 
Tiger Woods, Robert De Niro, and Oprah Winfrey have all been victims. No 
one is immune, and straightening out the resulting mess can take years. But 
you can protect yourself by practicing identity theft prevention (see my crash 
course in Chapter 2 and find more details in Part III) and looking for the telltale 
signs in your financial information (see Part II).

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
How identity theft happens
Unfortunately, identity thieves can easily obtain other people’s personal 
information and ply their trade. For example, suppose that you lose (or some-
one steals) your wallet. In your wallet are your driver’s license (with your 
name, address, and birth date), multiple credit cards (gas cards, department 
store cards, and at least one major credit card), ATM cards (if you’re forget-
ful, with associated personal identification numbers [PIN] numbers written 
down), and medical benefits cards (with your SSN as the identifier). Some 
people even carry personal checkbooks and their actual Social Security cards 
in their wallets. Get the picture? All the information an identity thief needs is 
right in one place.
Identity thieves can also obtain your personal information through dumpster 
diving — a midnight garbage safari activity. Yes, these thieves literally go 
through the garbage cans in front of your house and scrounge information, 
such as cancelled checks, bank statements, utility bill statements, credit card 
receipts, and those preapproved credit card offers you’ve been discarding. I 
discuss what thieves may be looking for in your garbage and what you can do 
to thwart them in the section “Knowing What Information Is Vulnerable” later 
in this chapter. You can also find more details in Chapter 6. Those who work 
for a company and handle personal information are also a threat, and they 
can steal personal information and sell it to those who want to use it.
 
Remember this advice: If you don’t shred, it isn’t dead. The non-shredded per-
sonal information you’ve tossed in the trash becomes fair game, and the iden-
tity thief thanks you for being so thoughtful.
Although identity thieves have many ways — some rather high tech and 
sophisticated — to obtain your personal information, wallets and garbage are 
the most common targets. The point is that after the thief has your personal 
information, he can assume your identity (at least financially) and start making 
purchases, getting cash or loans, and otherwise using your good credit.
Knowing What Information Is Vulnerable
We live in a numbers society: phone numbers, personal identification num-
bers (PINs), driver’s license numbers, credit card numbers, date of birth 
(DOB), Social Security Numbers, bank account and 401K numbers . . . you 
get the idea. As the lyrics of the song “Secret Agent Man” tell us, “They have 
given you a number and taken away your name.” Also, employee and medical 
record numbers and other tidbits of information are used to identify people 
as persons today, and that fact gives meaning to personal identification infor-
mation because all these numbers are keys to your identity on the phone, 
online, or in writing.

13
 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
The vulnerable personal information that identity thieves use is as follows:
 
✓ Social Security Number (SSN): This is, of course, the nine-digit personal 
identification number (compliments of the federal government) that 
everyone needs to get a job, pay taxes, and apply for credit. The SSN is 
the key to the kingdom — your financial kingdom, that is. The identity 
thief uses your SSN to apply for credit, file false tax returns, get a job, 
open bank accounts, and so on.
 
✓ Date of birth (DOB): A DOB is a piece of the personal information 
puzzle, but if an identity thief has this piece by itself, it’s not a problem. 
When the thief uses your DOB in conjunction with your SSN, she can 
become you.
 
✓ Mother’s maiden name: This name is used to verify your identity when 
accessing financial information. Identity thieves use your mother’s 
maiden name to verify their identity as yours to access your financial 
records and open new accounts in your name.
 
✓ Personal identification numbers (PINs): Usually a four- (or more) digit 
number used to access your bank accounts when using your ATM card.
 
✓ Passwords: Your passwords are the keys to any information stored elec-
tronically. When the identity thief has your password, he has access to 
the information you’re trying to protect, such as bank accounts, online 
bill paying services, and so on.
 
✓ Security questions: You see these questions — such as what was your 
first pet’s name and where did you go to high school — sometimes when 
you’re setting up an online account. These are not real security ques-
tions, so don’t use real information when answering the questions. The 
real answers can be easily guessed by potential thieves or, in the case 
of your alma mater, are a matter of public information. You can make up 
the answers so they are not easily guessed; you need to remember the 
answers you choose, though, so if you forget your password, you can 
still verify your identity by answering the security questions correctly 
(with your made-up answers).
 
✓ Driver’s license number: The number used to identify you is printed on 
your license. When the identity thief has your driver’s license number, 
she can have a phony license made that shows your name and driver’s 
license number with the thief’s picture.
By using your personal information, identity thieves can party hard on your 
nickel and good credit reputation. They spend like there’s no tomorrow 
because they know that someone else (you) is picking up the tab. Identity 
thieves can use your personal information to open accounts, such as a cellu-
lar phone account, in your name. Of course, they don’t pay the bills and con-
tinue to use the phone until you discover the theft and the heat is on; then 
they drop that account and move on to another unsuspecting victim.

14
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
Vulnerable info comes in the mail
To steal your identity, the identity thief uses some of the information you 
receive in the mail. In Table 1-1, I outline the most vulnerable information 
that comes in the mail.
Table 1-1 
Vulnerable Info That Comes in the Mail
Type of Mail
Vulnerable Information
Telephone bills and other utility bills
Your telephone number, address, and 
account number
Driver’s license renewal
Your name, address, DOB, and driver’s 
license number
Monthly credit card statement
Your name, address, card number and type 
(Visa, MasterCard, and so on), credit limit, 
and expiration date
Bank statements
Your name, address, bank name and con-
tact information, account number, and 
type. For checking accounts: your can-
celled checks, account number, and so on
Your identity thief doesn’t have to be your twin
Many episodes of the old Mission Impossible 
TV show featured one of the IMF (Impossible 
Mission Force) personnel assuming the iden-
tity of an intended target or someone close to 
the target. In the show, the person assuming 
the target’s identity would wear a mask that 
resembled the target’s face and would learn 
to speak and act like the target. In real life, an 
impersonator (the identity thief) doesn’t need 
to look or act like you to steal your identity. All 
that’s needed is your personal identification 
information and bingo: He or she becomes you.
TV commercials for a major bank’s credit card 
offer the best depiction of this real-life situation. 
In the commercials, you see the victims talking 
to you about how much fun they’ve had buying 
expensive vehicles, taking lavish vacations, or 
whatever. What you notice, though, is that the 
voices you hear don’t match the people you 
see on the screen: a male voice emanates from 
a female, or vice versa. The voice — gloating 
over how wonderful it is to get the goods and 
stick someone else with the tab — is obviously 
coming from the identity thief while you’re look-
ing at the victim.
A world of companies — you’ve probably seen 
the TV commercials — today pitch that they 
can help protect your identity from thieves. For 
a monthly fee, these companies will help keep 
your identity safe. In Chapter 9, I show you 
some of these companies that provide services 
to prevent identity theft from occurring in the 
first place. Preventing identity theft should be 
your goal. However, identity theft may occur 
even if you guard your identity like Fort Knox 
guards the gold reserves of the U.S.

 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
Type of Mail
Vulnerable Information
Preapproved credit card offers
Your name and address
Paycheck stubs from direct deposit
Your name and address; your employer’s 
name, address, and pay rate; and some-
times your SSN
401K and other securities statements
Your name, account number, balance, 
name of company holding account, con-
tact information, and sometimes your SSN
Personal check reorders (blank)
Your name, account number, address, and 
bank name and address
Blank checks from credit card 
companies
Your name, address, and account number
Annual Social Security account 
statement
Your name, address, SSN, DOB, and 
account balance
W-2s, 1099, tax returns, and other 
tax information
Your address, your SSN, and your spouse’s 
and dependents’ SSNs.
 
The best way to minimize the amount of information you receive in the 
mail — especially those preapproved credit offers and the blank checks 
from the credit companies — is to opt out. You can do so by going to www.
optoutpresceen.com or calling 888-5OPTOUT. When you opt out, you 
remove yourself from mail marketing lists. You can request that your bank not 
send preapproved checks, as well.
With the current economy, fewer credit card offers seem to be coming in the 
mail than in previous years when the economy was booming. This doesn’t, 
however, make it less of a problem for other bills and information you may 
get in the mail that can be used to steal your identity. For example, the fed-
eral government still sends annual Social Security statements in the mail. On 
the statement, you’ll find your full Social Security Number. Your DOB as well 
as your address is also on the statement. So protecting yourself from identity 
theft still means that you need to guard your incoming mail from the United 
States Postal Service deliveries. This means not leaving your mail in the box 
for a long period after delivery even in locked mailboxes. Several years ago I 
was the victim of stolen mail because I left the mail in a locked cluster mail-
box overnight. Read about this scenario in the nearby sidebar, “Never leave 
your mail in the mailbox overnight.”

16
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
What you throw away can hurt you
Dumpster diving occurs when identity thieves go through the garbage of 
potential targets. The only tools they need are a pair of gloves and a flash-
light. (The favorite time to go on a garbage hunt is after dark, and the thief 
must be able to stand the smell — especially on a hot summer night.) The 
purpose of dumpster diving is to find personal information that you discard 
without tearing or shredding. What type of information, you may be asking? 
The following list gives you the answer:
Never leave your mail in the mailbox overnight
Several years ago during the Christmas season, 
I discovered missing mail when I went to 
retrieve the mail the morning after it was deliv-
ered. As I approached the cluster box, I noticed 
that several mailbox doors were open, including 
mine. Of course, nothing was inside. A thief had 
used some kind of tool to pry open the box and 
then cut the locks. On the way to the post office 
to report the incident, I noticed that several 
other cluster boxes in the neighborhood were 
also broken into.
Now this is when the “fun” began. At the post 
office, I spoke to a supervisor and told him to 
hold my mail at the post office until they repaired 
the lock on the box. The supervisor then said I 
needed to report the crime to the police depart-
ment in my city. So off I went to the police 
department to report the crime. I waited with 
all the others in the lobby. When it was my turn, 
the clerk asked me why I was there. I said my 
mail was stolen along with several others in my 
neighborhood. The clerk then said that I needed 
to report it to the post office. I said I did and he 
replied that “it’s their jurisdiction.” I knew this 
wasn’t right, so I went to the main post office 
to report the crime to the law enforcement arm 
of the United States Postal Service, the postal 
inspectors.
Much to my chagrin, the postal inspectors 
were no longer located at the main office in 
my city, and I had to call San Francisco to file a 
complaint. I left a message. (To this day, I have 
never heard anything from the postal inspec-
tors, and I assume that the perpetrators were 
never caught.) I returned to my branch’s post 
office to pick up my mail for the day. The super-
visor said that I should file a report with the 
local police to investigate the crime. So I was 
off to see the police department again to file a 
complaint and report the theft.
The police report is necessary to file a fraud 
alert on my credit report for a 7-year, but not 
for a 90-day, alert. At the police department, I 
told the clerk I wanted to file a report for stolen 
mail. She asked what monetary loss I suffered. 
Without that information, she couldn’t file a 
report. I said, “I don’t know; if I knew I would 
have my mail or wait a minute, let me contact 
the thieves and ask them. At least maybe I can 
get them to pay any bills that may have been in 
the mailbox.”
Ultimately, I did get the report without know-
ing the monetary loss and immediately filed 
fraud alerts on my credit report. When you file 
a fraud alert, you need a police report number. 
Luckily, nothing ever happened from the stolen 
mail incident with my credit or identity. I was 
lucky, and none of my bills were late, so either 
the thieves paid my bills (ha) or only “junk” 
mail was in the box. So the moral to the story is 
never, ever, ever, leave your mail overnight in 
the mailbox even it is locked.

17
 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
 
✓ Preapproved credit card applications: Throwing away those preap-
proved credit card applications without tearing, shredding, or destroy-
ing them in some way is inviting trouble. An identity thief can retrieve 
the application from your trash, send it in with the address changed, 
and receive the new cards in your name based on your credit. After 
receiving your card, the thief charges items (or cash advances) to the 
card up to its maximum in short order. Then she tosses the card and 
leaves you with the bill.
 
 Note: Not as many credit card applications are sent in the mail as in 
previous years. With so many people delinquent in paying their credit 
cards, it’s no surprise that the days of the preapproved credit card 
applications may be done for — at least until the economy gets better 
and more people are working. The credit card issuers are hurting 
because they’re seeing a loss in revenue with more credit card defaults 
occurring than ever before.
 
✓ Credit card receipts: Although many businesses no longer print your 
entire credit card number on your receipts, some still do. Check your 
receipt — if it lists your credit card number, don’t leave it behind to fall 
into the wrong hands.
 
✓ Financial statements: Bank and other financial statements containing 
your account numbers and (often) your SSN are treasures that may lurk 
in the garbage unharmed and waiting to be “liberated” by the identity 
thief.
 
✓ Other paperwork: Old job applications, insurance forms, and benefits 
summaries are just a few other forms where your information can be 
found.
 
The bottom line is to remember to destroy all personal information before 
throwing it away. Tear, shred, or otherwise destroy those preapproved credit 
card applications, financial statements, credit card receipts, and so on. Don’t 
make your house a dumpster diving gold mine; what you throw away can 
come back to haunt you.
The Role of Technology in Identity Theft
Technology can play a role in helping you prevent identity theft when 
you browse the Web, shop online, and log in and out of secure Web sites. 
Technology can also play a role in helping you lose your identity. Online 
banking, online shopping, e-mail, and blogs are places where people post 
information about themselves for friends to see. Would-be thieves can see 
the same information and have a vast arena from which to steal your identity, 
and they don’t have to get smelly going through the garbage. They don’t even 
have to leave the comfort of their home to steal your identity.

18
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
The two most common technological tools at your disposal are encryption 
and authentication. If you know the tricks to these tools, they can help you 
make sure that your information is safe when you’re online.
Encryption
Encryption uses digital keys to lock and unlock data while it’s being transmit-
ted over the Internet, which makes it incredibly difficult for anyone but the 
intended recipient to see or tamper with that data. With encryption, a key on 
the sending end scrambles data, and a key on the receiving end unscrambles 
it. While the data is in en route, good encryption makes it virtually impos-
sible for outsiders to peek at or tamper with the data — in your case, your 
personal and financial data. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard form 
of data security on the Internet. SSL uses digital certificates to verify that the 
two computers in a transaction are who they claim to be before exchanging 
the keys that encrypt the data.
 
Before you use your credit card to purchase merchandise online — in fact, 
before you enter any of your data online — you want to make sure that the 
site uses 128-bit SSL to keep your data secure. Checking this is easy — in the 
bottom-right corner of your Web browser, just look for the lock shown in 
Figure 1-1. If you hover your mouse pointer over the lock, you may even see a 
tooltip that says SSL 128. When you double-click the lock, you see information 
similar to that shown in Figure 1-2, which indicates that the site’s identity is 
authentic and the data is encrypted.
Encryption can also be used to protect e-mail messages and attachments as 
well as files of personal information that you store on your PC or CD. The 
encryption software Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) enables you to encrypt this 
data. PGP offers a freeware version (software that you don’t have to pay for) 
for home use. (You can download the freeware version at www.pgp.com/
products/freeware.html.) For about $50, PGP offers the software with 
The Internet makes it possible
The Internet isn’t owned or governed by any coun-
try. Laws do exist against the distribution of certain 
materials — such as child pornography— in some 
countries, which is important. But when it comes 
to e-mails, blogs, and shopping, it is user beware. 
The Internet is a minefield and is potentially 
dangerous to the user. The best advice I can 
give you is to be careful regarding what you do, 
what you post, or where you go on the Internet. 
I explore ways to protect yourself and your 
identity on the Internet in Part V of this book.

more features, such as the ability to encrypt content on your hard drive 
when you’re not using it (you may want to do this if, for example, you travel 
often with a laptop that might be stolen or lost).

VeriSign offers a method to help you know that the Web site you’re on is 
authentic (that is, the site is who it says it is and is encrypting data). A site 
that uses VeriSign may display the VeriSign logo. (You’re most likely to find 
the logo on the site’s privacy and security page.) When you click the VeriSign 
logo, you’re taken to a page that tells you what security measures that site is 
using through VeriSign.

20
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
 
Because well-known names and logos like VeriSign offer people assurance, of 
course, online scammers try to use them in unscrupulous ways. Savvy identity 
thieves can forge a site, copy a logo, or make their own digital certificates. Use 
SSL and the VeriSign digital certificates and logo as one of many tools to make 
sure that the site you’re visiting really represents the company or organiza-
tion it claims to be, and see Chapter 10 for more on spotting and avoiding 
online scams.
Authentication
Authentication is the method used to identify you when, for example, you 
access your personal information on your PC, Web sites for bank accounts, 
online bill paying services, and so on. When you authenticate yourself to a PC 
or a secure Web site, you enter a username and a password or PIN to log in.
 
The best way to protect your identity through authentication is by using a 
good password. Choose a password that’s hard to guess but you don’t need 
to write down. The password should include a minimum of eight characters 
with a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters. An example 
is TGIF!*49. If you have the opportunity to choose secret questions to help 
prompt you in the event that you forget your password, choose good ques-
tions that no one but you can answer, such as a favorite teacher. (People 
could have access to your mother’s maiden name or spouse’s middle name.)
Safeguarding Your Information 
in Everyday Ways
With identity theft on the rise, you need to be your own watchdog. Table 1-2 
lists some everyday do’s and don’ts that will help keep your information out 
of the hands of thieves. I go into more details about preventing identity theft 
in Part III.

DO make sure that your bills are 
current.
You know whether your address is current 
and your bills aren’t being forwarded to 
another address.
 * Find out what protections your financial institution offers. Many offer a password in place of PII 
(personally identifiable information), so that people with knowledge of that information cannot

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
Finding Your Allies
You aren’t alone in the fight against identity theft. From the federal govern-
ment and credit card companies to your local police, your allies abound and 
can help you with many aspects of identity theft. Here are some of your key 
sources of help:
 
✓ The Federal Trade Commission (FTC): The FTC provides information 
useful for preventing identity theft and knowing what to do if you’re a 
victim. Its Web site (www.consumer.gov/idtheft) is chock-full of sta-
tistics, information, forms, and more to help you understand and prevent 
identity theft as well as what to do if you’re a victim. When you file a com-
plaint online, the report will be forwarded to law enforcement as well.
 
✓ The Social Security Administration (SSA): The SSA has guidelines 
for reporting fraud on its Web site (www.ssa.gov). Also, you need to 
submit a fraud reporting form to the SSA Office of Inspector General 
(OIG), which is an investigative branch. The SSA recommends download-
ing the form, completing it, and then sending it via fax or regular mail to 
ensure confidentiality. When you report the use of your SSN for identity 
theft, the SSA will not investigate the identity theft but will look into ben-
efit fraud. The SSA will not issue a new SSN if you have been the victim 
of identity theft.
 
✓ Most local law enforcement agencies: These agencies provide informa-
tion on how to prevent identity theft and what to do if you become a 
victim. 
 
 For example, the City of Stockton, CA Police Department gives seminars 
for employees at businesses in the city and for civic groups. They also 
provide tips on their Web site: Visit www.stocktongov.com, click 
the City Departments link, and then click the Police Department link. 
When you report the crime of identity theft to the Stockton, CA Police 
Department, you call the Telecommunications Center to file a report. 
The report is taken over the phone, and you’re given a report number. 
Most active federal law enforcement agencies investigating ID theft are 
the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the U.S. Secret Service.
 
✓ Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): The IC3 (www.ic3.gov) is a 
partnership between the FBI, the National White Collar Crime Center 
(NW3C), and the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). At the Web site, 
you can file a complaint and read about recent scams and other news. 
The IC3 reports the complaints to the proper local authorities. 
 
✓ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): Go to www.fbi.gov and look for 
the Be Crime Smart and Use Our Resources links (on the left side of the 
page) to find more information. 

23
 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
 
✓ Financial institutions and credit card companies: Most financial insti-
tutions provide tips about preventing fraud and knowing what to do if 
you’re a victim. Some institutions provide discounts and links to sites 
that charge an annual membership fee for providing identity theft pro-
tection. For example, I subscribe to a CreditExpert.com service, and the 
site is part of the credit bureau Experian. See Chapter 5 for more details.
 
 To help stem the upward trend of credit card fraud, the card-issuing 
companies monitor and look for irregular patterns of use. What you 
charge on a monthly basis is monitored, and when something varies 
from the normal pattern, the card company calls and asks whether you 
made the purchase. For example, when people go on vacation and don’t 
notify the card company, they’ll probably receive a call asking whether 
they made a purchase in X country or Y state. The card companies have 
used this method for the last ten years, and it’s helped reduce some 
credit card fraud.
 
✓ Experienced attorneys: Although the resources I’ve just listed are usu-
ally quite helpful, you may want to contact an attorney to help you 
restore your credit and name if creditors aren’t cooperative in removing 
fraudulent accounts from your credit report or charges from accounts. 
Contact the American Bar Association or Legal Aid office in your area 
and ask for the names of attorneys that specialize in the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA), consumer law, and the Fair Credit Billing Act.
 
✓ Your state’s Attorney General office: Check the Web site for your 
state’s Attorney General office, which has resources about identity theft 
prevention.
Getting Back Your Identity and 
Your Good Reputation
If you have been a victim of identity theft, don’t panic. You can do things to 
restore your identity and good reputation; however, it isn’t easy. Estimates 
of the time spent on getting back your credit and good name are around 600 
hours of work, according to a study done by the Identity Theft Resource 
Center, a nonprofit organization (www.idtheftcenter.org). The study 
found the 600-hour figure is a 300 percent increase from 2001, when people 
spent an average of 175–200 hours regaining their names and credit.
After you suspect that your identity has been stolen, you need to take 
four steps as soon as possible and begin documenting your case. The FTC 
outlines these first four steps on its identity theft site (www.ftc.gov/
idtheft), as shown in Figure 1-3.

24
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
 
Figure 1-3: 
Take these 
steps right 
away if you 
think your 
identity has 
been stolen.
 
Following is a simplified version of the steps that the FTC outlines:
 
1. Place a fraud alert on your credit reports and review the credit 
reports that you receive as a result.
 
 You can contact any one of the three major credit bureaus to place the 
fraud alert. By contacting one, that bureau is required — by law — to 
contact the other two bureaus to place a fraud alert on them as well. I 
discuss the three major credit bureaus in detail in Chapter 5. A new tool 
that you can add to your toolbox is the credit freeze, which I discuss 
at length in Chapter 2. If, however, you have filed a fraud alert, you are 
entitled to a free credit report from each bureau. 
 
2. Close any accounts that have been tampered with or opened 
fraudulently. 
 
 Make sure that you receive a letter stating that the account has been 
closed and that you receive a clearance letter.
 
3. File a report with your local police. 
 
4. File a complaint with the FTC.
 
 Chapter 2 gives more details about this process for reporting and 
thwarting identity theft. In Chapter 13, I explain further the process of 
filling out the required reports. Chapter 14 has helpful information for 
speeding up the process of closing accounts.

25
 Chapter 1: Who’s Stealing What . . . and What You Can Do about It
As you begin the process of reclaiming your identity, the paperwork will 
start to roll in and out of your life. Keeping a good paper trail will help you 
assemble and support your case. The Identity Theft Resource Center (www.
idtheftcenter.org) offers some helpful guidelines for organizing the data. 
The FTC also gives you tips for organizing your case. The tips shown on the 
FTC Web site are as follows:
 
✓ Follow up in writing with all contacts you’ve made on the phone or in 
person. Use certified mail, return receipt requested.
 
✓ Keep copies of all correspondence or forms you send.
 
✓ Write down the name of anyone you talk to, what he or she told you, and 
the date the conversation occurred.
 
✓ Keep the originals of supporting documentation, such as police reports 
and letters to and from creditors; send copies only.
 
✓ Set up a filing system for easy access to your paperwork.
 
✓ Keep old files even if you believe your case is closed. One of the most 
difficult and annoying aspects of identity theft is that errors can reap-
pear on your credit reports or your information can be recirculated. 
Should this happen, you’ll be glad you kept your files.

how to opt out of receiving preapproved credit card offers.
Tips for Preventing Identity Theft
You can take preventive measures to help protect yourself from becoming 
a victim of identity theft. Table 2-1 outlines some things you can do to make 
yourself a harder target. Making yourself a harder target means that you’ve 
taken steps to protect yourself so that it’s more difficult for an identity thief 
to steal your identity.

Table 2-1 (continued)
Identity Theft Prevention Tip
Result
Carry only one credit card.
Reduces the risk — only one card will be 
lost when your wallet is stolen or lost.
Don’t leave mail in any mailbox over-
night or for extended periods of time.
Reduces exposure to having your mail 
stolen.
Don’t mail your bills from unpro-
tected curbside mailboxes or 
personal mailboxes.
Minimizes the risk that your checks will be 
stolen, washed, and used by the thief.
Pay attention to billing cycles.
If you don’t receive your bills on time, 
follow up with your creditors, because 
this could signal that an identity thief has 
taken over your account and changed the 
billing address to cover his tracks.
When ordering checks, have them 
sent to the bank and pick them up 
there.
Reduces the risk that an identity thief will 
steal the new checks from your mailbox.
Ask about information security 
procedures in your workplace, busi-
nesses, doctor’s office, or other 
institutions that collect personal 
information. Ask who has access, 
what the disposal procedures are, 
and if the information is shared with 
anyone else and then verify that the 
information is secure.
Reduces your exposure.
Be stingy with your personal infor-
mation. The less information you give 
out about yourself, the more secure 
the information will be. For example, 
be careful about giving out your 
personal information for promotional 
purposes because this is a common 
method used by identity thieves to 
collect information about you.
Reduces the risk that your information will 
fall into the wrong hands.
Don’t give out your Social Security 
Number (SSN).
Keeps your SSN personal. The only time 
you need to give out your SSN is when 
you start a new job or apply for a new 
credit card or loan.
Check your monthly credit card 
statement regularly.
You’ll be alerted when new credit cards 
and loans are opened using your SSN.

Opt out of preapproved credit card 
applications by calling the toll-free 
number, 888-567-8688. (See the sec-
tion “Opt out of preapproved credit 
card offers” later in this chapter.)
Less risk because you’ll receive less mar-
keting mail and calls about credit offers.
Purchase a credit monitoring service 
from one of the three credit bureaus: 
TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax.
You can detect whether your identity has 
been stolen.
Memorize and randomize your pass-
words and personal identification 
number (PIN). Your PIN should not 
be your date of birth (DOB), phone 
number, or SSN.
Prevents the ID thief from getting your 
ATM card and a slip of paper with your 
PIN when she steals your wallet.
When using your ATM card, stand 
directly in front of the screen and 
cover the keypad with one hand 
while you type your PIN. Watch for 
people lurking around the ATM or 
pin pad who might be shoulder surf-
ing; if you don’t feel comfortable, 
don’t use that machine.
Prevents an identity thief from capturing 
your ATM PIN.
Check your savings, checking, and 
investment account statements 
regularly.
You can detect any changes in your 
accounts that you are unaware of.
Buy and use a shredder
Investing in a shredder is worth the money. You can purchase one at a local 
discount store for around $40. Make sure that the one you purchase shreds 
the papers so that they can’t be easily taped back together. Use a criss-cross 
or criss-cut shredder that shreds the document into confetti-like material. 
This way, you don’t have strips of paper that can be put back together. The 
identity thief looks for an easy way to obtain information, and if you shred 
your documents, they’ll look for an easier target. So by purchasing and using 
a shredder religiously to shred any documents that contain personal informa-
tion, you’ll be that harder target. I have a shredder and use it all the time to 
shred any documents that I (or my family) don’t need or want that contain 
personal information.

30
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
Make a habit of shredding the following documents:
 
✓ The monthly credit card statement after you pay the bill.
 
✓ Bank statements and 401K statements. You don’t need to keep every 
statement you’ve ever received from your 401K plan, just the first and 
the most recent three years.
 
✓ Pay stubs from work (after you check your monthly checking statements 
to make sure that the deposit amount on the statement is correct).
 
✓ Unwanted credit card applications.
Order and review your credit report
As an identity theft prevention method, order and review your credit reports 
at least annually. As I outline in Table 2-2 later in this chapter, you’re entitled 
to one free annual credit report from each of the three credit bureaus. 
Chapter 5 provides details about how to order and read a credit report. 
(This doesn’t stop identity theft, but does help you catch it if it’s happened 
already.)
The revisions to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), entitling consumers to 
one free credit report per year, were signed into law in December 2003 and 
now are in effect in all states. 
Reviewing a credit report is a good way to detect whether someone’s using 
your name to obtain credit. Simply examine the section of the report that 
summarizes inquiries made by others. Do you recognize the inquiries? Did 
you make or initiate them? If not, you could be the victim of identity theft.
Look for accounts that you have open but haven’t used for a long period of 
time, and then close the accounts. This keeps the accounts from being used 
by someone without your knowledge.
The FCRA changes mean that now you get one report a year from each of the 
three bureaus; do so by going to www.annualcreditreport.com or calling 
877-322-8228 (877-FACTACT). In some states (such as Georgia), you are enti-
tled to two reports a year for free. You can space it out and order a different 
report every four months and monitor your credit. Because many creditors 
report to credit bureaus only monthly or quarterly, this is the best approach. 
If you are particularly concerned about your information, you are also enti-
tled to a free copy of all three reports (above and beyond those you get from 
annualcreditreport.com). As a result of you placing a fraud alert on your 
report, it is renewed. You are also entitled to free reports if you are

Guard your personal information
Don’t carry more personal information than necessary. The more information 
you carry, the greater chance that it’ll be stolen. Here are some brief guide-
lines for what to carry and what to leave behind. Chapter 8 provides more 
detail, as well.
 
✓ Don’t carry your Social Security card with you all the time. If you need 
the card for identity purposes for a new job, take it with you but guard 
it. When you return home at the end of the day, take the card from your 
wallet or purse and put it back in its secure storage place.
 
✓ Don’t carry personal checks with you unless you’re going shopping. 
When you carry personal checks, make sure that you guard them. You 
don’t want blank checks falling into the wrong hands.
 
✓ Carry only one credit card with you. You can easily keep track of one 
card. If you carry several and don’t use some of them, you may forget 
that you have them and not realize that they’re missing if they’re lost or 
stolen.
 
✓ Be stingy with your personal information. Be especially stingy with 
it online and through social networking sites. Don’t give out personal 
information to anyone who asks; always verify the identity of the person 
asking for the information by initiating the contact to them. Never 
assume that your caller ID or e-mail is accurate, or that the caller is who 
she says she is. An identity thief can obtain the information through 
social engineering, which is the art of obtaining more information by 
using a minimal amount of information to fool the person. For example, 
knowing your pet’s or children’s names may help the person find out 
their birth dates, which you may be using as a PIN.
Opt out of preapproved credit card offers
By receiving preapproved credit applications in the mail, you increase your 
chances of becoming a victim of identity theft. All the identity thief needs to 
do is to steal the application from your mailbox, complete it, and send it in. 
The thief will use her address, so you won’t even get the bills.

32
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
You can opt out of preapproved credit card applications by calling the toll-
free number, 888-567-8688. The call takes 30 seconds. You can opt out for two 
years or permanently, and you can opt in at any time. If you place a fraud 
alert, you’re opted out automatically.
When you call, an automated system prompts you for information. One 
call removes you from the lists at all three major credit bureaus — Equifax, 
Experian, and Trans Union. I did it, and it’s quick, easy, and worth doing. The 
recording says that the request goes into effect in five business days.
About five business days after the call, you receive a letter asking whether 
the name and address is correct on the form. If the name and address is cor-
rect, sign and date the form and send it to the opt-out department. If your 
name and address are incorrect, simply make corrections on the form where 
indicated, sign and date it, and return it. The letter doesn’t come with a 
stamped, self-addressed envelope for returning the confirmation. You need 
to supply the envelope and the stamp.
To opt out from your own financial institutions and your own credit card 
company, you need to contact them separately; contacting the three major 
credit bureaus won’t do the trick.
Opt out of other mailing lists
You may also want to opt out of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) 
mailing list. Here’s the address:
 
 
Mail Preference Service
 
 
Direct Marketing Association
 
 
P.O. Box 9008
 
 
Farmingdale, NY 11735
 
You can also opt out by using four companies that sell mailing lists to other 
companies. To have your name removed, you need to write to them and send 
the request by regular mail. I know it sounds like a real pain to have to write 
and request that your name be removed, but it’s time well spent. The four 
companies’ names and addresses are as follows:

Use your debit card carefully
Most ATM cards are a combination debit and ATM card with the same PIN. 
Debit cards are being used more and more by consumers to make purchases. 
When you use a debit card, you swipe the card and then the machine asks for 
your PIN.
Using debit cards to purchase gas can cause you to have an overdraft (or non-
sufficient funds, NSF) on your account because gas stations block a certain 
portion of your balance until the transaction clears. For example, if you pur-
chase $20 of gas, the station may block $100 of your balance until the trans-
action clears. So if you don’t keep an eye on your balance, you could go into 
overdraft and have NSF charges placed on your account.
Another issue to consider is that the card number and PIN can be stolen. 
Unlike with credit cards, however, you’re liable for as much $500 if you don’t 
notify the bank about the stolen debit card within two days. If you don’t 
report the loss of the card within the time limits specified by your agreement 
with the bank when you signed up for the ATM card, you could be liable for 
all the withdrawals. 
Most cardholder agreements specifically exclude fraud by individuals who 
were at one time given permission to use the account and exceeded that per-
mission. That is, if you “loan” your card once to someone, you may be held 
liable if they charge it up or steal it later and charge it without your permis-
sion. However, I strongly recommend that you do not “loan” your debit card 
to any one, especially if you need to give them your PIN.

Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
Government Laws to Protect You
The changes to the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA) 
became law on December 2003 (changes took effect December 2004). Table 
2-2 outlines the changes.
FACTA provides better protection to you, the consumer, against the fallout 
from being a victim of identity theft. Following are some of the key provisions 
of FACTA. Table 2-2 provides additional information.
 
✓ You’re entitled to one free credit report from each credit bureau annu-
ally. Some states, such as Georgia, are eligible for additional copies 
under state law. Additional states have reduced-fee laws for additional 
copies of your report. 
 
✓ If you are the victim of identity theft, you’re entitled to additional free 
credit reports.
 
✓ If you are a victim of identity theft, you need to make only one call to 
receive advice and set a national fraud alert to protect your credit 
rating. 
 
 The fraud alert requests creditors to contact you before opening any 
new accounts or making any changes to your existing accounts. As soon 
as the credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the other two credit 
bureaus are notified automatically to place fraud alerts. The three 
bureaus then send confirmation letters notifying you that the alerts 
have been placed and will mail you credit reports free of charge, if you 
request them by using the phone numbers provided in the letters.
 
✓ As a victim, if you file a police report, the police report will help you to 
extend your fraud alert or to place a credit freeze on your report for no 
charge because you were a victim of identity theft.
 
 Neither the fraud alert or the credit freeze will block fraudulent informa-
tion from appearing on your credit report. This is why I urge you to take 
full advantage of the free credit reports to keep tabs on what is happen-
ing with your credit.
 
✓ The company that is going to issue credit is supposed to ensure that all 
requests for credit are legitimate after you flag your report and make 
notice that you suspect you are a victim of identity theft. 
 
 Some companies ignore the fraud alert altogether while others will call 
and verify that you placed the request for credit. Others will request 
proof of your identification before moving forward or denying the credit. 
 
✓ The fraud alert places a statement on your report, for anyone who might 
be reviewing your credit report, that you are a victim of identity theft. 

35
 Chapter 2: Mike’s Anti–Identity Theft Crash Course
The alert does not bar the potential creditor from issuing credit. The 
credit bureaus have no obligation to ensure the legitimacy of a request 
for your credit beyond the controls they normally have in place. It is the 
company that is reviewing your credit that has the responsibility to take 
action to ensure that the application is not fraudulent.
 
✓ Any person on active military duty overseas can place special alerts 
on their reports while deployed overseas away from their usual duty 
station.
 
✓ Lenders and creditors are required to take action even before the victim 
realizes that she is a victim of identity theft.
 
✓ Debt collectors are now required to report fraudulent information to 
creditors.
 
✓ Under FACTA, you have access to specialty consumer reports, such as 
those provided by ChoicePoint and Lexis Nexis. You also have access 
to check reports (from Chex Systems, Scan, and TeleCheck), in addition 
to medical records, payment history, insurance claims, tenant history, 
criminal background, and employment history. Literally hundreds of 
companies fall under the requirements of FACTA, and so they are too 
numerous to mention here. To find out more, go to

You know the reason for rejection and

Steps to Take If You’re a Victim
Sometimes, identity theft can’t be prevented. Here’s how it can happen. An 
insider — someone who works for a retailer, credit card company, bank, 
Department of Motor Vehicles, or Social Security Administration — sells your 
information to the identity thief. This scenario occurs with low frequency, 
but it does occur. You can’t do much to prevent a situation like this one. 
That’s why you need to remain vigilant and check your accounts and your 
credit report regularly.
If you discover that you are a victim, do not panic. If you’re diligent about 
checking your accounts and monthly bills, and reading your credit report at 
least once per year, you’ll discover early on whether you’ve been a victim. 
Early discovery makes it easier to address the issue and get your good 
name back.
Table 2-3 outlines the steps you must take if you discover that you’re a victim 
of identity theft. The sections following Table 2-3 provide more detail for 
each of the steps.

Reporting the crime to law enforcement
Reporting the crime to law enforcement used to be a chore. Not all states 
have passed legislation to mandate that local law enforcement agencies take 
reports of identity theft, but most law enforcement agencies will take reports 
because of all the recent publicity regarding identity theft.

38
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
To report identity theft in most jurisdictions, call the local law enforcement 
agencies nonviolent nonemergency phone line. Do not call 911; the crime isn’t 
a life-threatening situation. The phone book or local law enforcement agency 
Web site has phone numbers to specifically report these types of crimes. 
Some states and local agencies provide online methods for reporting nonvio-
lent crimes. You should check with your local law enforcement agency’s Web 
site for more details, as well as your state’s Attorney General office Web site.
After you make the call, the agency may send someone to take the report. In 
California, most jurisdictions don’t even send a sworn officer when your car 
has been stolen — they send a community services officer. This probably fol-
lows for an identity theft case. Regardless, you’ll have a report number to file 
with your theft affidavit.
After the report is taken, it’s assigned to the detective bureau or squad respon-
sible for the type of crime reported. A detective will open a case file and may 
do a follow-up contact with you. You need to send the report number and a 
copy of the report to the credit bureaus as well as all those businesses that 
have opened credit or sold merchandise that was unauthorized.
Employing the credit freeze
The credit freeze is another tool in the fight against identity theft. The freeze 
works the way it sounds: A frozen river doesn’t move until it thaws, and in a 
similar way, your frozen credit report is locked until you give permission for 
the data release. Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia allow credit 
freezes by law. California was the first state to pass a law allowing credit 
freezes. The most recent data (as of November 2008) shows that Michigan, 
Alabama, South Carolina, Alaska, Ohio, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, 
Missouri, and Virginia don’t have credit freeze laws.
The credit freeze helps you by not allowing an identity thief to open new 
accounts using your name, SSN, and so on without you knowing about it. 
This is another tool to prevent you from becoming a victim of identity theft 
because it stops any access to the credit report by blocking the process of 
issuing credit. No tool is 100 percent effective. (I hate to say it, but it’s true.) 
Companies that you already have accounts with can access your credit 
report around the credit freeze. There are accounts that can be opened even 
with a credit freeze, such as medical identity theft, criminal identity theft, 
payday loans, utility accounts, and others. So it is important for you to check 
your credit report even if you have a freeze on your report.
When you initiate a fraud alert, you need to contact only one credit bureau 
and then that bureau contacts the other two bureaus and informs them of 
the fraud alert. To initiate a credit freeze, you must contact all three bureaus. 
The fraud alert is free, but it lasts for 90 days and can be extended to 7 years. 

39
 Chapter 2: Mike’s Anti–Identity Theft Crash Course
The credit freeze is in effect until you remove it. The credit freeze can cost 
$15 per bureau ($15 × 3 = $45) to put it on your report and $18 per bureau 
($18 × 3= $54) for you to remove it (or thaw it).
In all the states that have freeze laws, you don’t have to pay a fee if you’ve 
been the victim of identity theft and have a valid police report. The fees vary 
from state to state if you have not been a victim of identity theft and do not 
have a police report. There are five states that only permit those who have 
been victims to use the credit freeze: Washington, South Dakota, Kansas, 
Arkansas, and Mississippi. You don’t have a time limit for keeping the credit 
freeze on your report, and it remains on your credit report until you remove 
it by paying any applicable fee.
Generally the freeze can be removed by using three methods: a temporary 
lift for a single creditor, a temporary lift for a period of time, and a complete 
removal of the freeze. You need to check with your state for specific details 
of how the credit freeze works where you live.
To find out about your state’s credit freeze law and to place a freeze on your 
credit report, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to www.creditcards.com.
 
 You’re taken to the CreditCards.com home page.
 
2. Just below the credit card logos in the upper-right corner of the 
screen, type credit freeze in the search box.
 
 You’re taken to a screen with a list of links.
 
3. Near the top of the list, click the Details of Credit Freeze Laws in All 
50 States link.
 
 All the states are listed in alphabetic order.
 
4. Click your state.
 
 You’re taken to a page showing a table that provides details about your 
state’s credit freeze law.
 
 The information is easy to read, and the table provides the cost for plac-
ing the credit freeze on each bureau’s credit report and the cost for you 
to remove it. Also, the table provides information on how long the freeze 
lasts when you place it on your report. In most states, the freeze is 
permanent until you remove it. In several states, the freeze is for seven 
years and then it expires.
 
5. Look at the How to Place Freeze column and follow the guidelines for 
your state.
 
 The process to place a freeze on your credit report varies from state to 
state, so I can’t provide all the details here.

40
Part I: Getting the Scoop on Identity Theft 
You can also find information about credit freezes here:
www.consumersunion.org/campaigns/learn_more/003484indiv.html
Most state Attorney General Web sites contain information on credit freezes 
as well as form letters to help you exercise your rights to free reports, fraud 
alerts, and credit freezes.
 
A credit freeze is not a panacea for protecting you against becoming a victim 
of identity theft. The freeze process is a long and complex process, and it is 
recommended mostly for those people who are repeated victims of identity 
theft. The best defense is prevention and being vigilant about checking your 
credit report at least annually.
 
In the states that don’t have credit freeze laws, the credit bureaus set the 
fees and the rules. To find out the cost of freezing your credit report and the 
cost for thawing your credit report, contact each of the three credit bureaus 
(TransUnion, Experian, Equifax).
In 2007, the AARP conducted a survey and found that most Americans were 
unaware that they could place a freeze on their credit report. Maybe public 
service announcements about the credit freeze law within each state would 
help get the word out.
Other essential actions you must take
Here are some other things you must do immediately if you discover that 
your identity has been stolen:
 
✓ Place a fraud alert on your credit report. This is an important step in 
regaining your good name and credit. Chapter 13 provides more details 
about this topic.
 
✓ Close compromised accounts. If you discover that you’ve been a victim 
and some of your accounts have been compromised, close them imme-
diately. See Chapter 14 for more details.
 
✓ Call your credit card company. If you review your monthly statement 
and find an item you want to dispute, call the credit card company. 
Chapter 4 provides more information about compromised accounts.
 
✓ Contact your bank. Call your bank if a discrepancy exists on your 
monthly checking account or savings account statement.
 
✓ Contact the Post Office Inspector General. Do this only if the situation 
involved mail theft.
 
✓ File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC 
has a complaint form on its Web site (www.ftc.gov).

 Chapter 2: Mike’s Anti–Identity Theft Crash Course
How I caught up with a thief
Several years ago, I discovered — by review-
ing my monthly statement — that someone was 
using my credit card without my authorization 
or knowledge. On that statement were several 
charges on the card I didn’t make. To remedy 
the situation, I called the card company, and 
it immediately removed the charges and sent 
me a letter stating that it was investigating the 
disputed charges. If those charges were found 
to be legitimate, the amount would be added 
back into my balance on the next statement. 
Typically, credit card companies also request 
a written statement (sometimes called a state-
ment, or affidavit, of fraud). The charges were 
fraudulent and recurred for several months, so 
the card company recommended that I cancel 
the card, which I did. They issued a new one 
immediately with a new account number and 
transferred any legitimate charges pending to 
the new account. My credit report reflected the 
credit card account was closed due to fraud, 
and the new account was listed above the 
closed one.
Note: Your credit card issuer may not address 
the situation presented above in the same way 
as mine did, but you need to report any charges 
you did make to them immediately. This was 
a unique situation where the credit company 
fraud investigators were working on a case 
where the companies and charges in questions 
were happening to other cardholders as well. 
This is why it is extremely important to check 
every charge on your statement every month.

Determining 
Whether You’re 
a Victim

In this part . . .
H
ow do you know if you’re a victim? You look for cer-
tain signs, such as a sudden change in your credit 
score for no apparent reason. You need to know how to 
order and interpret your credit report and what to look 
for on that report that may signal that someone else is 
using your credit. I cover all this and more in Part II.

Chapter 3
Smelling a Rat: Recognizing 
Common Signs of Identity Theft
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing what to do if you’re a victim of mail theft
▶ Defending yourself against identity theft and credit card fraud
I
n this chapter, I tell you how to recognize the signs that you’re an identity 
theft victim. The signs of identity theft I outline are the first signs people 
typically notice, but you can also find clues in your bank statements, investment 
statements, and credit report. What you don’t know can hurt you! For details 
on what to look for in bank and investment statements, see Chapter 4. For 
details on credit reports, see Chapter 5.
Suspecting a Thief at Your Mailbox
You know your normal billing cycle, and when your bills don’t arrive on time, 
you need to find out why. You could be the victim of mail theft.
I’d like to improvise on the old saying that nothing is definite except taxes 
and death and say there’s nothing definite except taxes and bills. When your 
bills don’t arrive on schedule, you need to be concerned. Don’t panic; simply 
follow these steps:
 
1. Contact your creditors.
 
 Call your credit card company, gas card company, and all the others 
that are late, and find out whether the bill is late for some reason (keep 
in mind that bills are almost never sent out late). Also ask when the bill 
was sent.

46
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
2. Contact someone at the post office and let her know that you suspect 
you’re the victim of mail theft.
 
 Offer to the post office the missed billing cycle and the information from 
the company you contacted about when the bill was sent. You may want 
to ask to speak directly to the local Postal Inspector’s Office. 
Besides your bills, you also receive bank statements regularly. Check your 
files to see when you last received your bank statements. If you haven’t 
received the statements monthly, you might be the victim of mail theft. 
Contact your bank and ask when your statements were sent.
 
To help track bills on different cycles, you can use the Calendar feature in 
Microsoft Outlook. You can enter the date the bill arrives and then determine 
when the next is due. Most bills are on a 30-day cycle. After you get the receipt 
for the bill, make an entry on the next month’s calendar and check the 
recurring event feature. You can also check the notification box so you receive 
an audible notification on that day. If you don’t have access to the Microsoft 
Outlook Calendar feature, you can use any calendar to enter the information.
Another indicator of mail theft is when you receive notification from a 
financial institution confirming your requested change of address. If you 
suspect mail theft, check your credit report, which may reflect the incorrect 
address that was filed in the change of address form. You can dispute the 
incorrect address and have it corrected.
Recognizing When Something Is Wrong, 
and What You Can Do about It
No question about it: It pays to monitor your bills every month, using the 
credit card receipts for the month. This is your first line of defense against 
credit card fraud and identity theft.
Here are the general steps you need to take if you notice charges you haven’t 
authorized on your bill:
 
1. Call your credit card company and dispute the charge.
 
 Ask for the credit card fraud department. Let the department know 
that you’ve been a victim of identity theft; then point out what charges 
you’re disputing and why. Make sure that you get the name of the 
person you’re speaking to, correct spelling, and so on.

47
 Chapter 3: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing Common Signs of Identity Theft
 
 Document the conversation by writing down the date and time of the 
call, as well as the name of the person you spoke to. Follow up your 
phone conversation with a dispute letter and send it to the company 
by Certified Mail. You’ll receive a letter in the mail from the credit card 
company outlining your conversation and listing the disputed charges. 
(See the section “Large unknown purchases on your credit card bills” 
later in this chapter for more details.)
 
 To help you track your progress, check out this link, which provides a 
sample record keeping log: 
www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/resources/forms/chart-course-
action.pdf
 
 For large dollar charge disputes, follow up your phone conversation 
with a letter disputing the charge.
 
2. File a dispute letter.
 
 The FTC provides a good sample dispute letter here 
www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/downloads/
dispute-letter-for-exisiting-accounts.doc
 
3. Order a credit report and review it carefully.
 
 Dispute any unknown charges and information. Place a fraud alert on 
your credit report if you suspect that you’re the victim of identity theft. 
Turn to Chapter 5 for a rundown on how to interpret your credit report.
 
4. Review all your bank statements and balances to make sure that 
they’re correct and show no signs of tampering.
 
 If you see signs of tampering, have your bank freeze the accounts. For 
example, look for withdrawals from your account that you didn’t make.
 
5. If you suspect that you are an identity theft victim, complete an 
identity theft affidavit.
 
6. Contact the fraud departments of your credit accounts and explain 
that you have been a victim of identity theft and are interested in 
further precautions they may have to offer you. 
 
 Some will add a password to your account and others will “flag” your 
account or take other security precautions for free. 
 
7. File a police report.
 
 This can extend your fraud alert to seven years, and the police report 
will also make reluctant financial institutions take your fraud claim 
seriously.
The following sections describe the most common ways that people realize 
their credit card or identity is being used without their authorization, and 
what you can do in each instance to reclaim your good credit.

48
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
Denied credit for a large purchase
The setting is a car dealership. You have the type, model, and color car 
you’ve longed for. You test-drive it, and you make an offer to the salesperson. 
You haggle for a time and finally come to an agreement. You complete the 
loan application. The salesperson says it will take a few minutes to run your 
credit report. After what seems to be an eternity, the salesperson comes 
back and says, “I have bad news: You were not approved for the loan.” You 
say, “But that can’t be — I have good credit.”
You’re permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to know the reason 
why you were turned down for the loan. After you review your credit report, 
you find credit card accounts you didn’t know you had, and you own two 
other cars you’ve never driven, or seen, for that matter.
What’s happened here is that you may be the victim of identity theft and 
didn’t know it. Now your work is just beginning. You must get back your good 
name and credit. You should dispute the information on your credit report 
that is incorrect with the credit bureaus; if this does not clear up the issue, 
you need to contact the original creditor. 
You can get the contact information from the credit report. When you 
contact the creditor, ask to verify the last four digits of the Social Security 
Number on the account. Now you will have to give them the last four digits 
of your SSN to verify if this is the SSN on the account in question. For a good 
explanation on disputing credit report information, go to
www.creditinfocenter.com/repair/
DisputingWithOriginalCreditor.shtml
This scenario actually happened to someone and was told to me by that 
person. The scenario can happen to you, especially if you have good credit. I 
can’t stress it enough: You need to know if someone is using your credit and 
name without your knowledge, and one of the best ways to detect the theft 
early is to review your credit report regularly. Chapter 5 explains how to 
order and read your credit report.
 
Review your credit report at least annually, as well as review your credit 
card and bank statements regularly. By regularly, I mean every three or four 
months. You can use your annual free report from each bureau and space 
them out at three-to-four months intervals. When you perform the checks 
consistently, you will know immediately if something is wrong. The sooner 
you find out, the easier it is to minimize the fallout. When you find an issue 
on your report, you should report it immediately. Early detection will help 
protect you from being held liable for the charges you did not make.

 Chapter 3: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing Common Signs of Identity Theft
Receiving credit card bills from 
cards you didn’t apply for
In your mail today, you receive a surprise bill from a credit card you didn’t 
apply for or didn’t even know you had. The charges on the card are for 
things you haven’t purchased and for a trip to a place you have never been. 
Something is wrong. You’re thinking it’s probably a mistake. You double-
check the name and address on the bill, and sure enough, it has your name 
and address.
Here’s what you do right away:
 
1. Verify that the credit card company is legitimate. 
 
 Phishing could be the issue here. Verify the company by using the 
online yellow pages, your state Attorney General’s office, or the BBB. 
You can also do a company search on Google to verify the address and 
company’s phone number. 
 
 When you contact the company, DO NOT ask them to look you up by 
name; instead, they may ask for the last four digits of your SSN. If they 
say they found an account, ask to speak to their fraud department 
immediately. Then provide notification in writing that you are disputing 
the charge. If it is fraud, then continue with these steps.
 
2. Order your credit report and review it carefully.
 
3. Place a fraud alert on your credit report.
 
4. Complete a fraud affidavit and send it to the credit card company that 
sent the bill.
 
You should not pay any balances that are fraudulent. If you pay, you own it. 
Do not fall victim to predatory collection practices. Check with your state 
Attorney General’s office about the laws that collection companies must 
follow in your state. Know your rights!
If people at the company attempt to pressure you into paying, just tell them 
that you’re filing a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) 
and your state’s Attorney General and remind them of the FACTA (Fair and 
Accurate Credit Transactions Act) provision that they can’t demand payment 
if you’ve been the victim of identity theft and have identified the charge as 
fraudulent.

50
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
Receiving calls from bill collectors 
for stuff you didn’t buy
You are watching your favorite TV show, when suddenly the telephone rings: 
It’s a bill collector calling about a delinquent bill. You have no idea what the 
caller is talking about. You start checking, but you know you didn’t purchase 
the item the bill collector is talking about. Here’s what you do right away.
 
1. Take a deep breath.
 
2. Ask the bill collector to send something in writing. 
 
 This could be a phishing call, so be stingy with supplying information; 
instead, make the caller give you information. The Fair Debt Collection 
Act and state laws prevent collection agencies from calling you if you 
ask them to stop calling you. 
 
 Representatives of collection companies cannot threaten you, harass 
you, use obscene language, publicize the debt, or misrepresent the debt. 
You can sue for damages under the act if they do. 
 
 Keep a notebook by the phone, and make notes of all the conversations, 
including the times and dates of the calls, and the names of the callers; 
also keep any letters you receive related to the communication. 
 
3. Order a credit report and then:
 
a. Review it carefully.
 
b. Dispute any unknown charges and information.
 
c. Place a fraud alert on your credit report if you suspect you’re an 
identity theft victim.
 
4. Call your credit card company and then:
 
a. Get the new charges since the last billing cycle.
 
b. Dispute any charges that aren’t yours.
 
c. Change your card or account number if compromised.
 
d. Contact the fraud department of your credit card company.
 
5. Review all your bank statements and balances to make sure that 
they’re correct and show no signs of tampering.
 
 If you see signs of tampering, have your bank freeze the accounts. If 
there are confirmed signs of tampering, change the card or account 
number and complete the necessary fraud paperwork.

51
 Chapter 3: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing Common Signs of Identity Theft
 
6. If you suspect that you’re the victim of identity theft, complete an 
identity theft affidavit, and then send it to all your credit accounts and 
your bank.
 
Receiving a call from a bill collector about a delinquent bill for something you 
never purchased is a definite sign that something is wrong. If this happens, 
you most likely are the victim of identity theft, and you need to address the 
situation immediately. Know your rights when it comes to bill collectors.
Receiving bills for unknown purchases
The mail arrives; you open it and see a bill for a plasma screen TV for $4,500. 
You look at the bill and say, “What is this? I didn’t buy a plasma screen TV at 
the XYZ store on an XYZ store credit card.” So what do you do? You follow 
these steps:
 
1. Verify the legitimacy of the store with a quick call or online visit to 
the Better Business Bureau or your state’s Attorney General’s office.
 
2. Call the store’s credit department to inquire about the purchase.
 
 Suppose they say that you made the purchase in their Seattle, 
Washington, store on xx/xx/xx date. You live in Spokane, Washington, 
and you weren’t in Seattle on the day of the purchase. Besides, you 
never received any plasma screen TV. When you inquire further, you 
find out that the plasma TV was shipped to an address in the Seattle 
area that you’ve never heard of.
 
3. Tell the store retail credit representative that you’re going to dispute 
the charge and then order your credit report.
 
 The XYZ store credit card account is in the credit history of your report. 
The report also contains the date the account was opened, which was 
the date of the purchase.
 
4. File a fraud affidavit that shows you were at work on the date of the 
purchase — you weren’t in Seattle — and send it to the XYZ store 
credit department.
 
5. Call the store credit department and ask them to close the account.
 
6. Follow up with a written identity theft affidavit to the store credit 
department to close the loop.
 
7. Place a fraud alert on your report immediately.
 
8. Order a credit report from the other two credit bureaus to see 
whether any other accounts have been opened in your name.

52
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
9. Immediately send an identity affidavit to any account opened without 
your knowledge.
 
 The fraud alert stops creditors from opening accounts without your 
knowledge. You have to verify your identity and approve all new 
accounts while the alert is in place.
 
10. Check with the Social Security Administration to see whether your 
Social Security Number (SSN) was used to obtain a job.
 
11. Inquire at the United States Postal Service to find whether a change 
of address form was filed on your behalf and report the information 
to the Postal Inspectors (the Law Enforcement Division of the post 
office).
 
12. Keep a written record of all the correspondence, phone conversations, 
affidavits sent, and so on.
 
Receiving bills in the mail with your name and address for purchases you 
didn’t make is an indication that you might be the victim of identity theft. It 
depends on the name. The more common the name, the more likely it is a 
mistake. For example, Mary Brown and John Smith are likely to be mistakes. 
The more uncommon the name — such as Raquel FeDelquizecx — the more 
likely it is identity theft.
Large unknown purchases 
on your credit card bills
When you review your monthly credit card bill, check it against your credit 
card receipts for the month. If you notice a large charge for something you 
didn’t authorize, contact your credit card company immediately.
 
1. Look at the date of the purchase, the location, and the amount. Tell 
the representative you didn’t make or authorize the purchase.
 
 The disputed charge is removed from the current month’s bill and is 
investigated to determine whether the charge is legitimate.
 
 Soon after the phone call, you receive a letter in the mail summarizing 
the details about the charge and letting you know that the card company 
is looking into the charge and will let you know of the disposition.
 
 When the card company completes its investigation and you receive 
notification that the charge was fraudulent, pay close attention to your 
credit card bills because someone may have your card number.
 
2. Follow up your initial phone call with a dispute letter or the 
completed statement/affidavit or forgery/fraud (see Figure 3-1).

53
 Chapter 3: Smelling a Rat: Recognizing Common Signs of Identity Theft
 
Figure 3-1: 
Sample 
dispute 
letter from 
the FTC.
 
 
 Keep in mind the following points:
 
• The dispute letter is to be sent within 60 days of when the disputed 
charge appeared on your bill.
 
• Send the letter by Certified Mail return receipt requested to make 
sure that the credit card company received the letter.
 
• Don’t send the letter to the address where you send your monthly 
payment; send it the address for billing inquiries. You can find the 
address for billing inquiries on the back of your monthly bill.
 
• Enclose a copy of your monthly bill and circle the charge(s) you’re 
disputing. Don’t send the original monthly bill — keep it in your 
files, along with a copy of the dispute letter and the return receipt 
from the post office after the letter is delivered.
 
3. Mark your calendar.
 
 The credit card company must acknowledge your dispute within 30 
days after receiving it. The credit card company must then resolve the 
dispute within two months of receiving your letter but not more than 90 
days after receiving your dispute letter.
 
4. Call the credit card company to obtain your current balance every 
week until your next bill arrives in the mail.
 
 If you don’t recognize any charges, speak to a representative and let 
him know. You may want to cancel the card, as well, and ask for a new 
account number.
 
5. Check your credit report to make sure that you don’t have any other 
surprises.
 
 Closely monitor your bank statements and your investment accounts. 
Stay on top of the situation so it doesn’t escalate into a bigger mess.

54
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
Suddenly . . . several unknown 
charges on each month’s bill
You can handle several unknown charges that appear on your bill each 
month the same way you address a large unknown purchase, although you 
may not need to cancel your card.
 
I’ve experienced this issue. I called people at the card company and told them 
which charge I was disputing because I didn’t make or authorize it. They 
removed the charges, and when the charges appeared on the next month’s 
bill, as well, the matter was turned over to the credit card’s fraud department. 
I spoke to the investigator, and he said that they knew about the company 
making the charges and that they would take care of it. The next month’s bill 
didn’t have the charges on the bill. In my case, it wasn’t an identity theft; it 
was credit card fraud. The charges, which were small ($50 to $65 per month), 
would have continued if I paid them and didn’t dispute them. It pays to review 
your credit card bill closely every month and not just blindly pay it.
This was the second time I had issues with a credit card. Several years ago, I 
noticed charges appearing on my monthly bill that I didn’t recognize. I called 
the card company and spoke to a representative to question the charges. 
The charges were removed from the current month’s bill. The next month, 
several new charges appeared on my bill. The charges from the previous 
month were found to be fraudulent. When I called the card company, a 
representative suggested that I cancel the card. The company issued a new 
one and moved my current legitimate charges to the new account. (This is 
where keeping your receipts for a month comes in handy.)
I received a new card several days after the phone conversation with the 
credit card company representative. I also put an alert on the card so that 
I would be contacted by the card company if any charges occurred that 
seemed to be out of my ordinary pattern of spending. The situation was 
resolved, and I didn’t receive any unauthorized or fraudulent charges on that 
particular credit card after the card was cancelled and a new account was 
opened.
The charges on my monthly credit card bill were not large, so they could’ve 
gone unnoticed had I not made a habit of checking my monthly bill closely. 
The fraudulent charges each month totaled no more than $60, and they were 
usually in $30 amounts for each charge. The thieves limit the charge amounts 
in hopes that they won’t draw attention to themselves, and they bank on the 
chance that I pay my monthly bills without closely reviewing them.

I
n this chapter, I home in on the bank account twins: checking and savings 
accounts. I also cover investment accounts, including the most popular, 
the 401K. I present some reasons why you need to look at your bank account 
statements regularly and some signs that may suggest you’re the victim of 
identity theft.
Checking Your Monthly Financial 
Statements for Surprises
Looking at your financial statements on an ongoing and regular basis helps 
you keep abreast of any changes in your accounts — especially those 
changes that may indicate that someone has your account information. If you 
check statements online or over the phone, you must also be careful about 
where you check your statements.
Check the following financial records every month:
 
✓ Bank/savings account statement: You either get a paper or online 
statement, at least once per month. The online statements can be 
reviewed any time. Your bank statement is easy to read. For checking, 
the statement has the checks you wrote and the account balance, plus 
all the deposits, ATM/debit card withdrawals, and any other automatic 
withdrawals you have set up. An online statement shows the amount 
deducted for each bill you paid, as well as the date. 
 
 For savings account statements you will see the deposits, withdrawals, 
and the account balance for the month.

56
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
✓ Credit card statements: If you find surprises, dispute them immediately 
by contacting your credit card company at the number printed on your 
bill. Tell someone at the company that you’re disputing XYZ charges 
because you didn’t make them. Follow up your phone call with a 
dispute letter (see Chapter 3 for a sample letter from the Federal Trade 
Commission [FTC]).
 
 In the case of existing or new credit card account fraud, don’t pay any 
amount toward a fraudulent balance. In most cases, this is viewed 
as accepting responsibility for that debt, regardless of whether you 
acquired it. In many cases, you know the person who stole your identity. 
To companies that may doubt that you didn’t benefit in some way from 
the misuse of your information, a payment might as well be a written 
confession.
 
✓ Checking account statement: Reading and interpreting your checking 
account statement is easy; you’ve probably been doing it for years to 
balance your checkbook every month. When you look at your statement, 
you see what your balance is at the time of the statement. You also see 
all the deposits made during the monthly statement period and all the 
withdrawals including ATM, POS transactions, and the checks that you 
wrote. By looking at the statement, you can see where you stand financially 
and you know whether someone’s tapped into your bank account.
 
✓ 401K, stock, and mutual fund statements: These statements usually 
come on a quarterly basis. Make sure that you review them to keep tabs 
on your investments. When reviewing your 401K statements, look at 
the difference from last quarter gains and losses. This helps keep you 
updated on your 401K plan. The same goes for stocks and mutual funds.
 
✓ Social Security Number (SSN) statement: This statement is sent by the 
Social Security Administration; it has your address, SSN, how much 
you have in your account, and the projected amount of monthly 
benefit you’ll receive upon retirement. The statements are mailed, 
so remember to get your mail every day. Don’t leave your mail in the 
mailbox overnight.
The following tips highlight a couple points to keep in mind if you decide to 
check your statements online or over the phone:
 
✓ When you check your online statements, be careful if you do so in a 
public place, such as a library; you never know who’s watching. You 
don’t want to make it easy for someone to get your financial information 
by using a Wi-Fi connection without using encryption. This goes for 
laptop computers, an iPhone, a BlackBerry, and so on.

57
 Chapter 4: Homing In on Financial Statements
 
 The person sitting next to you or elsewhere in a public place can steal 
your password when he logs on to your bank accounts if the packets 
aren’t encrypted. The perpetrator doesn’t even have to be in the same 
place as you; he only needs to be in close proximity with a laptop 
computer, a homemade antenna, and some software to hijack Wi-Fi 
connections. You probably won’t even know that your passwords have 
been captured until you notice money missing from your bank account.
 
✓ If you check your bank account by phone, don’t do it in a public 
place and don’t use your cellphone. I recommend that you use only a 
hard-wired phone (that is, a landline) to check your bank account 
information. Cellphone conversations can be captured, even though it’s 
considered wire tapping (which civilians can’t do and the police need 
a search warrant to perform). Hard-wired phones must be tapped 
physically for anyone to listen to your conversation, and that is more 
difficult than you think. I don’t explain how this is done because it’s 
beyond the scope of this book and, oh yeah, it’s illegal.
See Chapter 8 for more about keeping your private information private.
 
Replacing financial documents can take a lot of time and effort. You can 
protect your important documents by storing them in a safe-deposit box at 
your bank or in a fireproof safe in your house. The documents to keep in a 
safe and secure place include (but are not limited to) birth certificates, Social 
Security cards, car/home titles, bank records, insurance papers, and wills.
Checking Your Bank Statement 
Religiously
When you review your bank statements regularly (monthly), you’ll know 
around the time your statements will be delivered. If your bank statements 
don’t show up regularly, you may be a victim of mail theft. If your statements 
don’t show up, follow these steps immediately:
 
1. Call the bank to see whether it sent the statement or whether there’s a 
delay.
 
2. If the statement was sent, see whether you’re missing other mail, such 
as credit card statements.
 
3. Contact the good people at the post office and have them check 
whether a change of address form is on file for your address.

58
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
 If a change of address form is on file that you didn’t make, inform the 
post office of the fraud.
 
4. Contact the Postal Inspection Service and report a mail theft problem.
 
5. Contact your local police or sheriff’s department as well to report the 
mail theft.
 
6. Contact the good people at the bank and tell them about your mail 
problem, and then close and open new bank accounts. Transfer your 
money to the new accounts. Ask for new ATM cards and change 
your PIN.
 
You must review your bank statements every month to detect theft issues 
quickly — before they escalate.
Credit card statements are also an issue if not received regularly. Your credit 
card statement has all the information an identity thief needs to use the card 
herself. With your credit card information in hand, an identity thief can take 
an expensive trip on your nickel. She probably won’t send a postcard telling 
you what a wonderful time she’s having. In fact, the thief is probably pretty 
darned glad you aren’t there with her. Although it is rare that your credit 
card statement will have your full account number, expiration date, or CVV 
code, you still need to watch for signs of theft, which means reviewing 
every charge every month. Flag the ones you don’t recognize and research 
them; if you didn’t make the charge, report it immediately to your financial 
institution.
If you don’t receive your monthly statement from your credit card company, 
it isn’t because it’s so grateful that you pay your bill every month on time 
so it decided to give you a break; more likely, you’re the victim of mail theft. 
Follow the preceding steps in this section if you don’t receive your credit 
card statement for even one month.
Identifying an Unwelcome Doppelganger
Any unknown activity on your bank statements is a red flag. If you identify a 
red flag, a strong possibility exists that you have a joint account with a thief. 
When you review your accounts, look for the following:
 
✓ For checking account statements, make sure that all the checks listed in 
your statement are also listed in your check register.
 
✓ Look for any checks that are made out to Cash and ask yourself whether 
you wrote the checks.
 
✓ Look for ATM withdrawals you didn’t make from savings and checking 
accounts.

59
 Chapter 4: Homing In on Financial Statements
 
✓ Review instances when you’re overdrawn in your checking account.
 
✓ Note all the withdrawals, especially those that are ATM or online 
payments from the account. Question any you don’t recognize.
 
✓ Balance your checkbook every month so that you know how much is 
in the account. This also helps you get into the routine of checking the 
bank statements so that you know when they should appear in your 
mailbox.
 
✓ For savings account statements, make sure that any withdrawals that 
are listed were made by you.
 
Reviewing your bank statements regularly is a good way to reconcile your 
accounts and make sure that your balances are accurate, but you have to do it 
every month. This way, you can fix issues quickly — before they escalate.
Withdrawals you didn’t make
The Activity Summary and the Withdrawals and Other Withdrawals sections 
of your bank statements are important; you need to pay attention to them. 
If you see withdrawals that you didn’t make, you must note the discrepancy 
as a red flag. Definitely call people at the bank and talk to them about the 
charge.
Checks you didn’t write
As you are reviewing your checking account statement, look for checks 
written for things that you don’t recognize. If the numbers of any of the 
checks on the statement are out of sequence, make note of it. This is a red 
flag that something could be wrong.
The other scenario is that you see check numbers for checks you don’t 
recognize. You look at the cancelled checks that come with your statement 
and then look at your register, and you confirm your suspicions: You didn’t 
write the checks for Cash in the amount shown on your statement.
Don’t panic; call your bank and tell somewhere there that you didn’t write 
the checks in question. The dollar amount written on the checks and the 
check Pay to the Order Of in your register shows the checks you made out 
were to three entirely different entities, such as your electric utility bill, your 
phone bill, and your credit card payment.

60
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
Here is what you should do if you suspect your checks have been lost or 
stolen.
 
✓ In most states, the bank is liable for forged checks, but you must 
notify your bank in a timely manner. Timely manner is rather 
ambiguous, so my recommendation is that you check your statement 
every month and contact your bank as soon as you notice something.
 
✓ You may want to close the account and open a new one. The bank will 
want to know of any outstanding checks you’ve written so they can be 
paid when they arrive.
 
✓ Contact your local police department and report the lost or stolen 
checks.
 
✓ Contact check verification companies to let them know that your 
checks have been lost or stolen.

Finding bizarre bank account balances
Suppose that when you review your bank account statements, you notice 
that the balances aren’t what they should be according to your records. You 
review your statements by checking all your deposits with all the deposit 
slips you’ve kept for the month against those recorded on your statement. If 
they don’t match, call your bank immediately and tell someone there about 
the discrepancy.
The Activity Detail Deposits and Interest section of your bank statement 
shows the date of each deposit. A description and the amount for each 
deposit are listed. If your paycheck is a direct deposit, each pay period is 
listed here, along with any other deposits you made during the month.
 
Keeping all your deposit slips and your paycheck stubs for the month pays off 
when you find a discrepancy in your account balance.
After you check the deposits, look at the withdrawals, especially those made 
with your ATM and debit card. Are they correct? The account statements 
make it easy to find the information. If you didn’t make any one or more 
of the withdrawals, call your bank and tell somewhere there about the 
discrepancy.
Reviewing Investment 
Account Statements
Check your investment account statements, such as your 401K and IRA 
statements. These accounts aren’t immune from being compromised. The 
statements are usually quarterly, so you don’t get to review them as often as 
other accounts unless you view them online. Most of the 401K accounts have 
this option, as do the other investment accounts.
Check the account statements closely to make sure that no one is helping 
themselves to your money. Look at the balances in the accounts and compare 
them from the previous statements’ balances. You’ll see fluctuations due to 
the stock market conditions, but watch for withdrawals you didn’t make or 
changes that don’t seem right. 

62
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
My advice is to review all your accounts regularly. By regularly, I mean at 
least monthly, and if the statement is only sent quarterly, you can still access 
it via the Internet to review it.
Online Banking
Online banking has grown in popularity. More and more people use online 
banking because of convenience. You can bank from home and not worry 
about dressing to go the bank. With online banking, you can check your 
account statement 24/7, even on holidays, and not have to worry about a 
paper monthly statement getting “lost” in the mail. You can also use the 
convenient bill pay to pay your bills online.
Today with the use of a computer you can read your bank statements 
online and you will be able to see each transaction — even the checks you 
may have written during the current statement period — deposits, and ATM 
withdrawals. All that information is available for instant viewing. Reading the 
statements online will keep you up-to-date on any activity in your account 
and the chance of the statement being lost in the mail is null. Online banking 
is a good tool to help you track your accounts and quickly see if something 
is wrong. The check image is scanned into your statement, and you can view 
these things:
 
✓ Both sides of the check
 
✓ Who the check was written to
 
✓ The check number
 
✓ The amount the check was written for
 
✓ The signature of the person who cashed the check
 
When reviewing the statement, look for deposits as well as withdrawals. Bill 
pay checks show withdrawals but not a check number because you didn’t 
actually write a check.
Online banking has a cool feature that enables you to look at older statements 
and track your spending habits — beats sitting at the kitchen table with your 
paper statements.
 
For all its advantages, online banking still is not 100 percent free from being 
compromised. You must still be vigilant to make sure that if you’re the victim 
of someone hijacking your bank account, you can report the criminal activity 
in a timely manner to recoup your losses.

T
his chapter contains information about credit reports. You see how to 
order them, read them, and dispute any inaccurate information you find 
in them. Armed with the information in this chapter, you can use your credit 
report as an important tool in preventing identity theft.
What Is a Credit Report?
A credit report is a factual record of your credit payment history. Based on 
your credit history, a credit rating (or credit score) can assess your credit 
risk from high to low. Figure 5-1 shows a credit report from one of the major 
credit bureaus.

64
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
Figure 5-1: 
Equifax 
credit 
report.
 
The report is broken into the following sections:
 
✓ The Personal Profile section includes your legal name, Also Known As 
(AKA), addresses (current and previous), year of birth, and employers 
(current and previous).
 
✓ Credit summary is the total number of accounts that you’ve opened and 
closed in each category. Installment accounts are car loans, furniture on 
payments, stereo equipment, and mortgage loans; revolving accounts 
are credit cards, lines of credit, and so on.
 
✓ Public records are court records relating to bankruptcies, tax liens, 
monetary judgments, and overdue child support payments. These 
records stay on the report for seven–ten years.
 
✓ Credit inquiries are either hard or soft. You initiate hard inquiries when 
“you” apply for credit. Soft inquiries are made by “prospective employers” 
when they do a background check and by credit card companies for 
preapproved credit cards. You can stop most soft inquiries by opting 
out of such as soft inquiries for preapproved credit card offers.
 
✓ The account history contains the details of each account you’ve opened 
or closed.
 
✓ Your credit score is based on the information in your report relating 
to your payment history and the number of credit accounts you have 
open, as well as the balances on the accounts, which is debt to income 
ratio. Debt to income ratio is simply the amount of money you make and 
the amount you owe. If the ratio of debt is too high as it relates to your 

65
 Chapter 5: Interpreting Your Credit Report
income, you’ll be denied the loan in most cases because your ability to 
pay diminishes with each account you open. In other words, you run out 
of money before all the accounts can be paid each month.
 
 Your free credit report from www.annualcreditreport.com will not 
have a credit score on it. Neither will the one that you receive from 
placing a fraud alert on your report. Scores are general indicators of 
how you appear to banks and other creditors. The particular method of 
calculating the score is a tightly kept secret by the credit bureaus; they 
admit that telling customers too much about how they are rated would 
undermine their ability to market those scores of accurate indicators of 
your behavior in a way that reflects your ability to pay.
You can order your credit report from other online companies (which might 
charge a fee) besides the three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian, and 
Equifax). Just search for credit report with your favorite search engine. Here 
are two sites where you can obtain your credit report:
 
✓ FreeCreditReport.com: You can get a free credit report, and you can 
also try credit monitoring for seven days. To do this, you need a credit 
card. Read the fine print on the page; if you don’t cancel your membership 
within the seven-day trial period, you’re billed $14.95 each month that 
you don’t cancel the monitoring service.
 
✓ AnnualCreditReport.com: Go to this site to receive your free credit 
report under the law. This site helps you obtain your annual credit 
report (a report from all three bureaus) free. The cost is $0 — no fee to 
obtain the report — and no monthly membership is required.
 
 The site also has a Fraud Alert tab (in the upper-right corner). Click this 
tab to find out how to place a fraud alert on your credit report.
Obtaining Your Credit Report
To obtain your credit report, simply visit one of the credit bureau Web sites 
and complete the order form. After your identity is verified, you can view 
the report online via these secure Web sites and print it. In addition, you can 
order a printed report over the telephone or by regular mail, which takes 
about ten days to reach you.
Here’s the contact information for the big three credit reporting agencies:
 
✓ Experian: www.experian.com; Find a phone number (888-397-3742) 
and other ways to reach Experian by clicking the Contact Us link at the 
bottom of the home page. You can reach a live person at Experian only 
with a report number. When you access your report online, write down 
the report numbers immediately.

66
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
✓ Equifax: www.equifax.com; Find a phone number (800-685-1111) 
and other ways to reach Equifax by clicking the Contact Us link in the 
bottom-right corner of the home page.
 
✓ TransUnion: www.tuc.com; Find a phone number (800-916-8800) by 
clicking the Contact Us link in the upper-right corner of the home page; 
on the Contact Us page, click the Personal link.
With any of these three agencies, you can dispute something on your credit 
report online or by phone. You just need a current copy of your credit report 
(no more than 90 days old) from the agency you’re contacting to dispute an 
item on the report. All three offer free fraud prevention services, including 
fraud alert statements that you can place on your credit file if you’ve been 
the victim of fraud. Credit monitoring services are also available for a fee.
 
According to the new Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), you’re entitled to one 
free report per year from each credit bureau, but it is recommended that you 
get a report every four months. So take advantage of something free and order 
your credit report quarterly.
The FCRA was signed into law in December 2003 and has been implemented.
All three credit bureaus offer an annual subscription service. Table 5-1 
summarizes the services offered and the cost. A sample report (from 
Experian) is shown in Figure 5-2.

 Chapter 5: Interpreting Your Credit Report
  
Reviewing the Telltale Information 
on Your Credit Report
In this section, I explain the red flags you may find when you review your 
credit report and how to address them. Your three-in-one report is a good 
place to start looking.
The three-in-one credit reports are not really all three reports in one. Some 
folks who have ordered the report have found errors on their reports and 
noticed that the report did not actually contain the numbers from the credit 
bureaus to dispute the discrepancies. So be aware that the three-in-one 
report may not be accurate. 
The Personal Profile section
Figure 5-3 shows the Personal Profile section of a three-in-one report. The 
report lists all the information each of the three credit bureaus has about you 
in your personal profile. The report even provides a side-by-side listing of the 
information for easy comparison.

70
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
 
Figure 5-3: 
The 
Personal 
Profile 
section of 
a three-in-
one credit 
report.
 
 
I recommend that you order and read your free credit report from each of 
the three bureaus at least annually to ensure that all the credit bureaus are in 
sync in reporting your information. (You can obtain free annual reports from 
AnnualCreditReport.com.) You’ll be glad you did!
The Personal Profile section of your single credit bureau report in Figure 5-3 
includes the following information:
 
✓ Your legal name
 
✓ Also Known As (AKA); other names associated with your credit files
 
✓ Year of birth
 
✓ Current and previous addresses
 
✓ Current and previous employers
To correct any errors relating to your personal profile, you must prove your 
identity by supplying the following information:
 
✓ Full legal name including SR, JR, III, and so on
 
✓ Current and previous addresses for the last five years
 
✓ Date of birth
 
✓ Two methods to prove your address, such as
 
• A copy of your driver’s license
 
• A passport
 
• Proof of a Social Security Number
 
• A utility bill
 
• A bank statement
 
• W-2

71
 Chapter 5: Interpreting Your Credit Report
 
Any changes to your addresses that you didn’t make are an issue and could 
be an indicator of fraud. Send a letter to the credit bureau to have the 
information corrected immediately via Certified Mail return receipt. The mail 
receipt is your record of sending the letter, and the return receipt tells you that 
your letter was received by the credit bureau.
Note: The credit report has an identifier number next to each address. This 
corresponds to the address identifier number in the accounts section of your 
report. If you have an address that is incorrect but does not have an account 
attached to it, it is likely an error and not fraud. If the personal section of 
your report contains a name variation, Social Security Number variation, an 
incorrect address, and the accounts attached to it are in good standing, this 
is also likely due to just an error and not identity theft. Both of these errors 
can be corrected with a simple dispute form with the credit bureau; no 
affidavit or police report is necessary. 
Reviewing your credit report to see whether all the information is correct 
in each of your three reports helps you clear any inaccuracies before they 
become an issue. When you see discrepancies, note them and then bring 
them to the attention of the credit bureau by filing a dispute with the bureau 
that’s posted the information you’re challenging.
The Account Information section
The Account Information section lists all open and closed accounts. Make 
sure that all the information is accurate. Lenders aren’t required to report to 
all three bureaus, so loans are sometimes reported only to one bureau. This 
is why it is important to get your three-in-one report. This way, you can see 
whether any accounts have been opened without your knowledge.
The Credit Summary section
Figure 5-4 shows the Credit Summary section of a credit report. This section 
of the report is important: It lists all the loans that are currently open, the 
amount and type of loan, the balance, the name of the company, and whether 
there any are delinquencies.
 
Any accounts you didn’t open are an issue and may be an indicator of fraud. 
Also, any loans in collection that you don’t recognize as yours are an issue. 
File a dispute report immediately in either of these instances.

If you find any monetary judgment in a state you haven’t lived in, file a dispute 
immediately. Also, find out more from the court record. The court name and 
case number are listed on the report, and you can use them to obtain a copy 
of the record for your review.

The Credit Inquiries section
The Credit Inquiries section of a credit report features two types of inquiries: 
 
✓ Hard inquiries affect your credit score, and potential creditors see 
them when reviewing your report. You initiate these inquiries when 
you complete a credit application. Mortgage loan applications are hard 
inquiries.
 
 If you didn’t initiate an inquiry that appears on your report by applying 
for a loan or credit card, it’s an issue! File a dispute immediately.
 
✓ Soft inquiries are those inquiries that only you see, and they don’t affect 
your credit score. These inquiries include pre-employment screenings 
and preapproved credit card offers.
 
 You can minimize the preapproved card offer inquiries by opting out. 
See Chapter 2 for details.
The Account History section
Figure 5-6 shows the Account History section of a credit report. The 
information includes the account type, balance, account status, the date the 
account was opened, and the payment status. The payment status is where 
you find whether the account payments are on schedule as agreed when the 
account was opened. Look at the account numbers — for security reasons, 
only the last four digits are printed. Your report will look the same as the 
sample.

Your credit score
Your credit score is important to your credit rating and is an indication of 
what kind of credit risk you are and what interest rate you’ll be charged for a 
loan. Your credit score can also be an indicator that someone has stolen your 
identity (for example, when your score has a sudden unknown change).
The score is calculated based on the information in your report for 
that particular bureau. One popular score is the FICO score because it’s 
calculated on software developed by the Fair Isaac Company. However, all 
three credit reporting agencies have developed their own consumer credit 
scores. Literally, thousands of credit scores are used; some developed for 
industry-specific types of credit, such as auto loans or mortgage loans. 
The score is on a scale in which the higher the score, the better credit risk 
you are. If your score is 768, shown in Figure 5-7, for example, you’re in the 
Excellent range. Your score is 81 percent higher than most U.S. consumers.

Table 5-2 lists the score names by credit bureau. I give you the information 
about credit scores so you know what each bureau calls their credit scores, 
but these are only the scores derived from the FICO. The higher your score, 
the better the credit risk you are. Your credit score is affected by the factors 
listed in Table 5-3.

+ Factors
– Factors
You have a relationship with three 
or more creditors.
You have too many inquiries in last two 
years.
You don’t have any derogatory 
information on your report.
You have derogatory information, such as 
charge-offs and collections.
You have accounts that have been 
open for five or more years.
You have too many installment loans, such 
as car loans and college student loans.
Your credit balances aren’t close to 
your card limit.
Your credit card balances are too close to 
your card limit.
You have few or zero delinquencies 
of 30+ days.
You have delinquencies of more than 30 
days.
Sudden unknown credit score change
A sudden unknown change in your credit score is a red flag. For example, you 
may apply for a loan and be turned down because your credit score is too 
low. You review your credit report to determine why your score has dropped 
suddenly. You discover that your report has credit accounts you didn’t open 
and several are more than 30 days delinquent. Let the lender know that some 
of the information on your credit report is inaccurate and that you’re going 
to file a dispute to resolve the issue.
During tough economic times, your score may change because the lenders 
change practices, restrict your account, or turn you down for credit. 
You must dispute the inaccurate information with the credit agency from 
which the lender received your credit report. You need the report number. 
When you go online to dispute the information, follow the links to dispute 
online. (All three agencies have the link on their Web sites, usually under the 
heading Personal Solutions or Services.) When you click Personal Solutions, 
one of the subheadings that appears on the Personal Solutions page is 
Dispute Online. Click the heading, and it takes you to the dispute form with 
directions on how to complete the form.
A sudden change, usually a drop in your credit score, is most likely caused 
by having too many accounts with several that are delinquent for more than 
30 days. Dispute inaccurate information immediately so that you can get the 
issue resolved before it escalates even farther.
A fraud alert tells the credit bureaus that you’ve been the victim of identity 
theft. You report the alert to one bureau and per the Fair and Accurate Credit 
Transactions Act (FACTA), it then reports it to the other two bureaus. You 

76
Part II: Determining Whether You’re a Victim 
use a dispute to question any wrong information on a particular bureau’s 
credit report. To dispute information, you must first have a current report 
from the bureau with which you’re disputing the information.
You are entitled to free reports reflecting corrections of any items you have 
disputed.
 
To place a fraud alert on your report, do the following. For more detail, see 
Chapter 2.
 
✓ Contact your local police and file an identity theft report.
 
 To file an initial 90-day fraud alert, you do not need a police report. 
 
✓ Place a fraud alert on your credit report.
 
✓ Check your other accounts to see whether any of them have been 
tampered with as well.
 
✓ Close any accounts that have been tampered with.
 
✓ Choose a new personal identification number (PIN) and get a new ATM 
card.
Looking for consistency
When you review your report, look for consistency in the information 
outlined in Table 5-4.

Your credit report is an effective weapon in the war against identity theft. 
You can look to the report for an early warning that someone is helping 
herself to your good name and credit. Table 5-5 summarizes the telltale signs 
that you’re a victim.

Disputing Your Credit Report
You’ve found information that you want to challenge. How do you do it? Well, 
the three credit bureaus have online dispute forms. Figure 5-8 shows a sample 
of Experian’s online dispute form. Figure 5-9 explains disputes and has a hyper-
link to the online dispute form. Notice that on the dispute form, you have a 
space to include your credit report number, and you must include your SSN.
 
When you file a dispute, you need to include a credit report number from a 
personally ordered report that’s no more than 90 days old.
At the bottom of the dispute form is a notice to let you know that it’s a crime 
to obtain a credit report for anyone else; you may dispute information only 
on your own report. Refer to Figure 5-9 for the terms and conditions.
You can also view the status of your dispute online. The form is essentially 
the same as the one shown in Figure 5-9, but at the top, instead of saying 
Request a dispute, it says Check the Status of Your Dispute. The credit 
bureaus have 30 days to respond to your dispute.

Finally, you have a form to check the results of your dispute. The form is 
essentially the same one used for checking the status of your dispute with 
two notable differences. The first is, the heading of the form says View the 
Results of Your Dispute, and a box is added just to the right of the box 
for stating an investigation ID number. The credit bureau gives you the 
investigation ID number when you check the status of your dispute.
Possible responses you might receive from a credit reporting agency include 
no response, a rejection (based on your dispute being deemed frivolous 
or on you manipulating the system), or a letter informing you that an 
investigation has begun. For more possible responses and other information, 
go to the following Web site:

gives you the rundown on prevention, from keeping your 
personal information safe to watching what you say and 
do in public.

n this chapter, I tell you about the ways to keep your personal information 
safe. When you understand the vulnerabilities with your mail and online 
accounts for bill paying and banking, you can prevent them from falling into 
the hands of an identity thief.
Discovering Where Your Personal 
Information Hides
Your personal information can be found in more locations than you probably 
realize. Table 6-1 outlines some of the locations your personal information is 
located. The table is not all-inclusive, but it gives you a good idea of where 
personal information is commonly stored.

Nowadays people often meet and talk with their friends and share experiences 
at online networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace. You 
need to be careful about how much personal information you post online. 
The more you post, the easier you make it for the thief posing as a friend to 
get your information and steal your identity. The best advice I can give you 
is to keep your personal information offline. Of course you wouldn’t put your 
Social Security Number (SSN) online, but what about

83
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
 
✓ Your date of birth?
 
✓ The city where you live?
 
✓ Your cellphone number?
 
✓ Your name? A pseudo name?
Do you give the information to those who you’ve befriended you on a private 
chat page? The personal networking pages aren’t the only pages where you 
need to be careful with sharing personal information; the same logic applies 
to professional networking pages. You can post a resumé , but you don’t need 
to include any personal information, such as your home address. Prospective 
employers can contact you initially by e-mail.
I’m not saying don’t network — even I network — however, I am cautioning 
you to use the same discretion online that you’d use when meeting friends in 
public, new or old. You don’t share your SSN, your birth date (not right away, 
anyway), your full name, and so on. Be wary of someone who asks too many 
personal questions while networking. If you feel uncomfortable, you have a 
problem. Go with your gut feeling and listen to your intuition; these feelings 
are often correct.
Here are some simple rules to follow when networking online:
 
✓ Do not post personal information on public pages. Things to NOT 
include are
 
• Date of birth (DOB)
 
• SSN
 
• Address (including the city where you live)
 
• Full name
 
• Pictures of yourself
 
✓ Be careful who you allow to see your personal pages.
 
• This is true especially for those whom you meet online because 
people are out there who use the Internet to prey on other people.
 
• Keep your circle of contacts on your personal page to those who 
you know in real life and not just from the Internet (but still be 
careful).
 
✓ Be skeptical of anyone you just met (especially online) who attempts 
to get too close.
 
• If this person claims to be a friend of one of your friends, verify it.

84
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
 
• If this person asks too many questions that makes you feel 
uncomfortable, do not give them any information. 
 
✓ Avoid answering questions about schools you attended, what year 
you graduated, or even your pet’s name. Answers to these questions 
can help someone figure out your year of birth or the answer to security 
questions you choose in case you forget your password(s).
 
✓ Avoid making family connections on social networking sites. Doing so 
provides too much information — like your mother’s maiden name, your 
place of birth, and so on — that potential identity thieves can use to get 
other information about you.
The important info on the 
documents you receive
You receive various documents every day. Some are sent by mail, some are 
handed to you, and others arrive by e-mail. Many of these documents contain 
information that’s useful to an identity thief.
Awareness is your first line of defense against identity theft. Being organized 
and keeping track of the statements and reports you receive is important if 
you’re to protect yourself against identity theft. Consider the following:
 
✓ Credit card statements: Your credit card statements have your name, 
the credit card company’s name and phone number, your address, 
sometimes the entire account number, and credit limit printed on it. 
The thief can also request a change of address and have the bills come 
directly to her, although most banks confirm a change of address with a 
follow-up telephone call or letter.
 
 Your credit card statements list all your purchases and payments for the 
last month’s billing period. By checking your statements regularly, you 
can determine whether someone else is making charges on your card. 
Generally, you have 30 days from the date of the written or online 
statement to notify the financial institution about any charges that are 
questionable.
 
✓ Bank statements: Bank statements have the account numbers and 
balances, your name and address, and the name of your bank. The 
checking account statement has information about your account activity 
and, if you choose, all the canceled checks that have been paid by the 
bank in your name are enclosed with the statement. Use your bank 
statement as a tool in detecting identity theft. Review the account at 
least monthly (or online daily/weekly) so that you know immediately 
whether any withdrawals you didn’t make are posted. Watch for small 
charges that may go unnoticed, especially if you didn’t make the charge. 

85
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
 
✓ Paycheck stubs: Paycheck stubs for direct deposit have personal 
information on them, including your name, address, rate of pay, and 
your employer’s name. Shred the stubs before you discard them if you 
do not want to keep them.
 
✓ Investment statements: Your 401K statements have a great deal of 
information, including your name, address, account number, balance, 
and the name of the company that’s managing the account. IRA accounts 
may contain your SSN. If you have an account with a stockbroker, the 
quarterly statements have the same information as an IRA or 401K. Keep 
the first statement after you opened the account, and then keep two to 
three years of current statements and shred the rest. The reason to keep 
the current year’s statement is to check that your money isn’t leaving 
the account without your approval or knowledge. Don’t just throw 
your investment statements away — they contain too much personal 
information.
 
✓ Social Security statement: On an annual basis, those of us who are 
25 or older receive an account statement from the Social Security 
Administration. This statement has your SSN as well as your DOB, 
address, and current balance with the projected amount you will receive 
if you work until you are 62 or 65. Because these are annual statements, 
you can keep more of them. They aren’t bulky, so you can keep them all 
until retirement if you like, but keeping the most current 20 years’ worth 
is probably sufficient. At minimum, you should keep them to compare 
numbers year to year.
 
✓ Tax information (W-2s, interest accounts, 1099s, and so on): These 
are the most vulnerable tax documents because they have the most 
information. They have your name, your address, your employer’s name 
and address, your pay for the year, and your SSN. Tax information is 
useful to identity thieves because the form has your (and your spouse’s) 
SSN, your home address, place of employment, pay rate, and so on — 
which can all be used to assume your identity. Keep copies of your tax 
returns for at least five years in a locked file cabinet or safe. This helps 
minimize theft. 
 
 If you are filing by using Turbo Tax or another online tax service, make 
sure that you have installed — and updated as necessary — virus and 
firewall protection on your computer. (See Chapter 11 for more about 
these and other electronic safeguards.) When you send the completed 
documents, make sure that the site has a secure connection. To do this, 
look for a lock at the bottom-right corner of the screen. If the lock is 
locked, the transmission is secure. If you don’t see a lock, check with the 
site to find out whether it uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or another 
form of secure connection before you transmit the completed form with 
all your personal information.

86
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
In addition to statements, many folks receive the following documents by 
mail:
 
✓ Preapproved credit card offers
 
✓ Driver’s license renewal forms
 
✓ Utility bills
 
✓ Direct deposit paycheck stubs
 
✓ Government and military correspondence and benefits statements
 
✓ Vehicle registration
 
✓ Insurance policies, such as car, home, life, medical, and so on
 
✓ Blank checks for your personal checking account
These documents have personal information, and they come in the mail — 
which is vulnerable.
Finding your information online
Finding your information online isn’t that difficult. All you have to do is 
access public records Web sites, and you can find some information. If you 
own a house, for example, the address, parcel number, the mortgage company, 
the amount borrowed to purchase, the purchase price, and the taxes paid or 
owed on the property are all on file at the county clerk’s office. Table 6-2 
outlines where personal information can be found online.
Problems with my mail
Mail napping, stealing mail to get information 
about someone to be used for monetary gain, 
is one way the identity thief can get his hands 
on your mail and consequently your personal 
information. In 2007, the United States Postal 
Inspection Service handled 2,909 fraud 
complaints and made 1,236 arrests for mail 
theft; as a result of the investigations, 1,118 
people were convicted. 
It’s hard to say whether this is just the tip 
of the iceberg. For every mail thief caught, 
several more may still be out there preying on 
the mail. Even with the good records of the 
Postal Inspection Service, parts of the country 
are experiencing volume thefts. These thefts 
occur in Tucson and Phoenix, Arizona, parts 
of California, and parts of Texas. The thefts 
include mail trucks, collection boxes, apart-
ment mailbox panels, co-op mailing racks, and 
neighborhood delivery and collection units. The 
mail is stolen to get your checks, credit card 
applications, and bank statements.
Protect your mail: Don’t leave it in the box 
overnight or for extended periods of time — not 
even in a locked mailbox. Be stingy and keep all 
your mail for yourself! Place your outgoing mail 
in a blue United States Postal Service mailbox 
or at the post office.

Public records
Numerous public records databases are 
online, as well as numerous virtual directories, 
genealogy directories, and school directories.
 
Web sites exist where you can pay a fee to obtain information about yourself. 
The number of searches you request determines the amount of the fee. You 
can search criminal records, the county clerk’s office, and so on. All you need 
to do is type in your SSN, DOB, name, and address. The site searches through 
public records for criminal convictions, civil suits, bankruptcies, and so on. 
Keep in mind that thieves can search this information, too. If your report 
contains errors, you may not be able to get the information removed, 
especially if you paid for the background check yourself. If you were turned 
down for a job as a result of errors, you can request that the erroneous 
information be corrected.
Some companies charge $9.95 per month to remove information about you 
from the Internet. Some sites charge considerably more. I haven’t used any 
of these companies, so I can’t comment on how effective they are, but you 
can try one if you feel the need. To locate these companies online, search for 
remove my internet info. The results will feature information that is both good 
and bad. You can also search for complaints against a company by going to 
the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The information you find can help you 
make a decision on whether to use the company’s services.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) governs access to financial records, so 
the search Web sites can’t run financial inquiries. The FCRA requires your 

88
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
permission to run a credit and financial check. You sign a form to grant 
permission to a prospective employer, car dealership, or mortgage company 
to run a credit and financial check. Without the form, they can’t legally run a 
check. The FCRA also requires that if derogatory information appears in the 
report, you receive a copy so you can contest its contents. Chapter 2 
discusses recent changes to the FCRA.
Accounts you have online
In this Internet age, having accounts that are managed online is commonplace. 
Using your computer to manage your accounts is fast and easy. The accounts 
that you may have online include the following:
 
✓ Bank accounts (savings and checking)
 
✓ Accounts for your bill paying service
 
✓ Insurance (homeowners, auto, life, and health)
 
✓ Investment accounts, such as 401K, mutual funds, and others
 
✓ Individual accounts with online merchants
 
✓ Services like PayPal
Any account you can access online has the potential to be compromised. To 
access the account, you generally use a PIN (personal identification number, 
or password). Sometimes the PIN is all numeric, and sometimes it consists of 
alphanumeric characters.
The danger with online accounts is having a weak PIN, a weak password (or 
one you need to write down), or weak security on your computer. After an 
identity thief figures out your password or PIN, he can access your accounts 
as easily as you do. The thief can also call and pretend to be you by answering 
questions, such as your DOB, your mother’s maiden name, and so on, and 
have the password and username changed to her own. Today when changes 
are made in user and password accounts, you receive an e-mail (in the e-mail 
account you cited when you signed up for the account) about it. Most banks 
allow you to set a verification password on your account so changes can only 
be made with that password and not by identifying the caller through personal 
information. Money can be withdrawn from the account or moved to other 
accounts; the accounts can be closed out.
 
The most secure combination of characters for a PIN or password is a 
combination of letters, numbers, and special characters (at least six 
characters long), such as TGIF29#$!.

89
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
Checks, receipts, and other 
papers you generate
For someone who lives in a “paperless” society, I bet you still generate a 
great deal of paper. For example, you generate checks, ATM receipts, credit 
card purchase receipts, and debit card purchase receipts, to name just a few. 
How you treat the important paper you generate either makes you more 
vulnerable or less vulnerable to identity theft. Table 6-3 highlights the paper 
you generate.
Table 6-3 
Paper You Generate
Action

Use your credit card
In some businesses, a receipt with your full card 
number, name, and card expiration date
Complete a loan application
Copy with all your personal information, including 
your SSN
 
Shred, rip into tiny pieces, or cut into tiny pieces all the documents you 
generate that contain your personal information before you discard them. 
Don’t make your information easily available to the identity thief; become a 
hard target by practicing prevention. The best defense is shredding.
Government documents
If you look in your wallet, you’ll probably find at least one government 
document — your driver’s license. You may be surprised to find how many 
government documents you have, and the importance of each, when you see 
the following list:
 
✓ Driver’s license: In addition to your driver’s license number, your 
driver’s license contains your name, address, eye color, hair color, 
height, weight, and your birth date. You show it to police officers 
even when you aren’t driving and at airports to pass through security 

90
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
checkpoints. Your driver’s license is usually requested when you 
purchase merchandise by personal check. In fact, the cashier often 
writes the driver’s license number on the check.
 
 Because your driver’s license contains so much personal information, 
cut up the old one into little pieces that can’t be put back together. The 
ID thief can make up a phony driver’s license with your details to open 
an account in your name, use your stolen personal checks, or cash fake 
checks in your name.
 
✓ Birth certificate: Your birth certificate proves that you are a U.S. citizen. 
It contains your mother’s maiden name; your father’s name; the city and 
state you were born in; and the time, day, and year you were born. You 
need a birth certificate to get a passport, state ID card, and so on. To 
be safe, store your birth certificate in a locked — and fireproof — file 
cabinet or safe-deposit box.
 
✓ Passport: Your passport is also an important document. It has your 
picture, full name, and address, and it proves that you’re a U.S. citizen. 
You show your passport when you travel abroad. You show it to customs 
when you arrive in another country and upon return to the U.S. Your 
passport can be used by terrorists or other criminals attempting to gain 
entry into the country. If your passport is lost domestically, it can be 
sold to someone else and used to establish citizenship. Store your 
passport in a safe-deposit box or locked — and fireproof — file cabinet.
 
✓ Auto registration form: The auto registration form has your full name 
and address on it as a proof of ownership. The ID thief can use your 
name and information to purchase an automobile, and your name and 
maybe even your address will appear on the auto registration. When you 
leave your car, be sure to lock it!
 
✓ State ID cards: State ID cards identify people who don’t have a driver’s 
license. In addition to your ID number, it contains your name, address, 
and birth date.
To open a bank account at most banks, two forms of ID are required; one is 
a current (unexpired) driver’s license or a current passport, and the other is 
typically either a birth certificate or an unexpired credit card.
 
As I discuss in Chapter 1, don’t leave your mail overnight, even in a locked 
mailbox. Also be careful where you mail your important documents from. For 
example, the post office is safer than the mailbox at your home or apartment. 
Vigilance is important to make yourself a hard target. Thieves will go after the 
easy target rather than the hard one because there are enough easy ones to 
go around.

 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
Keeping Your Information 
Safe but Available
Store your personal information so that it’s secure from theft but easily 
accessible by you. The information needs to be handy for you to access but 
difficult for the identity thief.
Software to help keep 
your information safe
When you store the information on your PC, protect it with the following:
 
✓ Antivirus software: This software scans your computer for viruses 
(programs that intend to harm your computer system) and then 
removes them from your machine. You usually end up with a virus (or 
a worm or a Trojan horse) when you open a seemingly innocent e-mail 
attachment that in fact harbors the little devil. Two popular antivirus 
programs are Norton AntiVirus and McAfee VirusScan. Most new 
computers come with some sort of antivirus software preinstalled.
 
✓ Firewall: A firewall heads off destructive programs at the pass. You 
can use the options that come with your firewall software to restrict 
applications with inbound and outbound access to your computer and 
the Internet. Norton and McAfee offer firewall software at a reasonable 
price.
 
✓ File encryption: Encrypting the files you store on CD and on your PC 
is the best way to secure them electronically. PGP is a company that 
produces encryption software, which is available for personal use. I use 
PGP encryption for e-mails and find it easy to use. Check out PGP here:
www.pgp.com/products/desktop_home/index.html
 
✓ Password-protection: Be sure to protect sensitive documents with a 
password.
 
✓ Spyware protection: This safeguard prevents spyware from being 
installed on your computer. Most virus protection software provides 
spyware protection. Spyware protection software, like the virus and 
firewall protection, must be up-to-date to be effective. If you don’t keep 
it updated, it is useless. 

92
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
 
 An easy way to be sure that your protection is updated is to use auto-
matic updates. 
For more information about the safeguards listed in the preceding bulleted 
list, see Chapter 11.
Tips to keep your information safe
In addition to using software, you can use the following tips to protect your 
information:
 
✓ You can store files on a CD and lock the CD in a fire-rated safe that’s 
either tethered to a secure anchor or heavy enough to prevent it from 
being taken easily from your house.
 
✓ You can store a copy of a CD in a bank safe-deposit box.
 
✓ Do not store your personal information on a Web site or in e-mail files. 
E-mails can be captured and read by anyone. Web site links in e-mails 
are used to get the recipient to divulge personal information that’s 
captured by the identity thief.
 
✓ Be careful about storing personal information on your laptop hard 
drive. If the laptop gets stolen or lost, the information will be lost or 
compromised. Use some form of encryption to protect the data on the 
hard drive.
 
✓ Know the Web sites and companies you purchase merchandise from and 
make sure that they use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or some other form 
of encryption to transmit personal data.
 
✓ Be wary of any Web sites that ask for personal information before you 
can access their site. The Web site owners may be using a legitimate 
marketing tool, but you need to consider what they do with the 
information that they collect. Is the information sold? How secure is the 
server where they’re storing all the information they collect about you? 
When you’re at legitimate sites, you can take security warnings with a 
grain of salt — especially if your virus, spyware, and firewall protection 
are all up-to-date. The scammers will use phony alerts on legitimate Web 
sites to get you to buy their virus protection, spyware, and so on. When 
you give your credit card to make the purchase, the number is stolen.
 
 Read the Web site owner’s privacy policy before you give them any 
personal information. The privacy policy lets you know how they’ll 
treat the information they collect. The privacy policy gives you the 
opportunity to opt out if the Web site owners are going to share the 
information with anyone else.

93
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
Accessing your information
No matter how you store personal information — either online or on hard 
copy — you need to be able to access the information easily. Here’s a simple 
plan to help you ensure that you can access your information when you need it:
 
✓ Make a list of all your credit account numbers, issuing company names, 
and contact information. Do the same thing for your bank accounts and 
investment accounts. Also keep a record of the current balances, your 
Social Security card, and your birth certificate. Keep copies of your tax 
returns, as well.
 
✓ Put the hard copies of the list in a safe location — a fireproof safe or a 
bank safe-deposit box. If the information is on a CD, keep the CD in a safe 
location.
 
✓ If you need the information, you now have it in one place — no need to 
panic when you need it.
 
When you update the information, make sure that you destroy any hard 
copies before you discard them. You don’t want this information to fall into 
the wrong hands.
Knowing When to Hold ’Em, When to 
Fold ’Em, and When to Shred ’Em
If you live in a paperless society, why do you generate so much more paper 
than you did 20 years ago? The answer is simple: With computers, you can 
easily produce documents. And what’s better than documents? I’ll tell you 
what — more documents! Some of the paper generated is important, however, 
and you must know what to keep, where to keep it, and for how long.
What to keep
Table 6-4 provides a quick guide for you to use when considering which 
documents to keep. The list after the table provides more detail on each 
item.

Here are some additional points to keep in mind:
 
✓ Personal checks that are needed as a receipt for tax purposes should be 
kept with your tax records. Keep these records kept in a fireproof file 
cabinet. Keep the tax returns there as well. The checks and tax returns 
need to kept for five years as required by the IRS.
 
✓ Bank account statements for your personal checking account need to be 
kept for at least six months to compare to the next month’s statement. 
The account statement can be kept in a fire-rated file cabinet.

95
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
 
✓ Your savings account statements need to be kept for at least one year 
to check the balance in the account. If the account is an interest-bearing 
account, as most are, you’ll receive a tax statement of how much interest 
was paid for the year from the bank at the end of the year to file with 
your tax return. The copy of this document needs to be kept with your 
tax return.
 
✓ Investment account statements need to be kept for as long as you have 
the account. This is a good way to track your balance from quarter to 
quarter.
 
 I use my statements for comparison and I review them. Reviewing the 
account statement frequently is an excellent way to see whether 
someone has been siphoning money from your account — which means 
that she has your account number and information.
 
 The best place to store account statements is in your file cabinet 
drawers. These files are helpful for reviewing the account activity and 
for making decisions on whether to move the money to another account. 
I file quarterly account records from my securities and investment 
accounts in a large loose-leaf binder by date for reviewing ease.
 
✓ Keep your credit card statements and receipts for the current two 
months. The receipts are used to reconcile your statement and to make 
sure that you made all the charges that appear on the statement. If you 
didn’t make any of the charges, now is the time to dispute them with 
your credit card company. (You have 90 days from the date of the 
statement to dispute a charge.)
 
✓ Keep paycheck stubs from direct deposit by your employer. If you don’t 
keep them, they need to be destroyed before being discarded. If you keep 
the stubs, keep them in the file cabinet with your tax returns and then 
destroy them before discarding.
 
✓ Any mortgage documents, deeds, or lease agreements need to be kept 
in a fireproof storage box at home or the safe-deposit box at the bank. 
These documents need to be kept for as long as you own or rent the 
property. The mortgage payment book and slips need to be kept, as well 
as any statements showing the account activity. Any rent receipts you 
receive, as well as the cancelled checks, need to be kept as a record of 
payment. When you move and the documents are no longer needed, 
destroy them before discarding.
 
✓ Vehicle purchase agreements and loan papers need be kept in the 
fireproof file cabinet. This is true whether the vehicle is new or used. If 
you purchased the vehicle from another private party, keep the sales 
agreement. When you finally pay off the loan on a vehicle purchased, be 
sure to file the pink slip in the safe-deposit box. The pink slip needs to 
be kept and transferred to the new owner when you sell the vehicle. The 
loan papers, however, can be destroyed and discarded.

96
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
 
✓ Vehicle and homeowners insurance policies should be kept in a safe-
deposit box or locking fireproof file cabinet. The information contained 
in the policy coverage statement is important. So when you discard the 
old policy, destroy it before you throw it away.
 
✓ Life insurance policies contain personal information and need to be kept 
locked in a fireproof file cabinet or a safe-deposit box. Destroy outdated 
policies before you discard them.
Best practices for destroying 
what you don’t keep
I talk a great deal about destroying the documents you want to discard 
that contain personal information. Any documents containing personal 
information need to be destroyed before being discarded to prevent your 
personal information from falling into the wrong hands.
Dumpster diving, as I cover in Chapter 1, is a real threat. You may think that 
no one would go through dirty, smelly garbage cans, but they do because it 
works. They find personal information and use it to steal your identity. The 
good news is that heading off thieves at the pass is as simple as destroying 
your documents before you discard them. Here are the best ways to do it:
 
✓ Shred the documents. Shredders are the best and most effective 
method for destroying documents. Some of these shredders are actually 
powerful enough to shred credit cards. You can purchase a shredder at 
discount department and office supply stores.
 
 The best shredder to purchase is a criss-cross shredder, which makes the 
documents look like confetti and not just like strips. The long strips can 
be pieced together, and the personal information can then be read and 
used.
 
 After you shred the documents, place the contents into a plastic bag and 
put the bag in the bottom of your garbage can.
 
 Make sure that you follow the safety directions and precautions in the 
manufacturer’s instructions to avoid mishaps.
 
✓ Use a permanent marker to mark out personal information and then 
tear up the documents. The next best way to destroy the unwanted 
documents is to take a permanent marker, mark out any personal 
information, and then tear up the document.
 
 Don’t just mark out the personal information with the permanent marker 
and leave it at that; also tear up the document into small pieces before 
discarding. This way, you ensure that the document doesn’t yield any 
information to an identity thief.

97
 Chapter 6: Keeping Tabs on Your Personal and Business Information 
 
✓ Tear or cut up the documents into small pieces. Tear or cut the 
documents if you don’t have a shredder. Make sure that you tear or cut 
the documents into small pieces so they can’t be taped back together 
easily.
 
✓ Cut up the expired or cancelled credit cards and driver’s licenses. Cut 
up those expired credit cards and driver’s licenses. Don’t put them in 
the trash in one piece, or you only invite trouble. Cut the cards and 
driver’s licenses into tiny pieces that can’t be taped together easily. 
Don’t throw them away without cutting them up so the card number 
can’t be used by any one else to make purchases on the phone or online. 
For a demonstration that shows how to adequately cut up your card, 
go to

Destroy documents that contain personal information that you don’t want to 
keep. This helps to keep you from becoming a victim of identity theft.

T
he important personal information you discard can come back to haunt 
you in a big way if you don’t destroy it before tossing it. Before you 
throw away any document with your name on it, think about what the 
consequences would be if it fell into the wrong hands. This chapter outlines 
the issues you may face if you don’t destroy various types of documents 
before discarding them, including credit card statements, bank account 
statements, utility and cellphone bills, cancelled checks, and old driver’s 
licenses.
Protecting Your Mail
Your mailbox (and garbage can) contains a bonanza of information for 
the identity thief. You need to pay attention to what’s in your mailbox. By 
following the simple tips in Table 7-1, you can help protect your mail from 
falling into the wrong hands.

A raised mailbox flag means that mail is in the curbside box to be picked up. 
The flag was raised to let the mail carrier — and everyone else, including 
identity thieves — know that outgoing mail is in the box. So placing anything 
at the curbside mailbox to be picked up, especially those bills with personal 
checks and credit card statements enclosed, isn’t a good idea. On the other 
hand, leaving delivered mail in the box for an extended period of time isn’t a 
good idea either. How long should you leave delivered mail in the curbside 
box? For as short a time as possible. In other words, retrieve your mail as soon 
as you can. You don’t want to give the identity thief any more opportunity than 
necessary to steal your mail; when you’re not home, have a trusted neighbor 
remove the mail from the box.
Watching What You Throw Away
Your garbage cans hold a treasure trove of personal information. You throw 
away valuable personal information every day, and if you’re like most of us, 
you probably don’t even give it a second thought. Before reading this book, 
you probably didn’t even own or plan to buy a shredder.
Dumpster diving isn’t an Olympic sport, but you wouldn’t know that by the 
enthusiasm its participants have for scavenging for personal information in 
your garbage. The thieves are looking for preapproved credit card applications 
and the part of your credit card statement that you discarded without 
shredding or tearing. There they are: your bank statements with account 
numbers and balances, mixed in with last night’s spaghetti. Wow, look over 
there, your cancelled checks you tossed because you don’t need them for 
tax receipts. You get the idea. You must destroy the documents that contain 
your personal information before discarding them.

101
 Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb
 
If you don’t shred, it isn’t dead. Don’t leave any morsels for the identity thief 
to help him in his quest to steal your identity and live life to the fullest at your 
expense.
Destroy expired credit cards before you discard them. Throwing away 
expired credit cards without destroying them will only come back to haunt 
you later. The identity thief only needs your name, card number, and 
expiration date to order stuff online or on the phone. The three-digit security 
code is on the back of the card, and the identity thief will have this as well.
You also need to destroy your expired debit card to prevent the identity thief 
from getting your card number and name.
Monthly credit card statements
When an identity thief enters a dumpster or for that matter, garbage cans in 
front of your house, she has a competitor — the neighborhood cat. In the mix 
of the food stuff and other things is your credit card statement, perhaps a 
little stained with coffee grounds or tomato sauce, but still legible. The only 
problem is that the thief needs to wrestle the paper away from the cat that’s 
crouched on it (and probably feasting on a half-eaten tuna fish sandwich). 
The fight is worth it to the identity thief, though, because the gain outweighs 
the unpleasant experience.
You may be thinking, “Why would anyone choose to go through someone’s 
stinky, dirty garbage?” The payoff keeps them coming back for more. For 
the identity thief, finding the personal information you discard that’s legible 
enough to use to her advantage is the reason. Your credit card statements 
have just the kind of information the identity thief seeks. The thief will use 
the information from the statement, or she’ll sell it to someone else.
For an identity thief, finding your monthly credit card statement is like 
striking gold. Your credit card information can be used to buy anything he 
desires, and the best thing for him is that he knows he doesn’t have to pay 
for it. In most states, you’re responsible for zero of the unauthorized charges 
on your credit card if you report the fraudulent charges immediately upon 
receiving your monthly statement. However, you still need to review all the 
charges on the statement and dispute those you didn’t authorize. To dispute 
the unauthorized charges you need to contact the credit card company and 
tell someone there which charges you’re disputing on your bill. Prevent the 
theft in the first place by shredding your paid credit card statements before 
throwing them away.
 
Shred your preapproved credit offers and credit card statements before you 
discard them. Here are some additional tips to help protect your credit from 
theft:

102
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
 
✓ When you pay your credit card bill, don’t write your full credit card 
account number on the Memo or For line on the check; write only the 
last four digits. The credit card company knows the rest of the numbers. 
This helps protect your account number from prying eyes because a 
number of people will handle the check in the credit card company as 
well as your bank.
 
✓ Destroy the cancelled check before discarding it. If you discard the 
check without destroying it, you may inadvertently distribute your 
credit card account number or, at minimum, your checking account 
number and signature. For more information about discarding cancelled 
checks, see the section “Cancelled checks” later in this chapter.
Monthly checking account statements
The identity thief is after all sorts of treasures in your trash. For example, 
your monthly checking account statement. Just think of the information 
that’s on that statement — your name, address, account number, bank name 
and address, and your balance.
The account information can be used to make counterfeit checks to drain 
your account. With the information from your discarded statement, the 
identity thief can open a new checking account in your name and write bad 
checks on the account. The checks are bad because the identity thief puts 
only enough money in the account to open it, so when checks for purchases 
are written on the account, non-sufficient funds (NSF) exist to cover the 
checks. Because your name is on the account, you’re the one who appears to 
be writing the bad checks. You find out about the problem when you write a 
check at the grocery store, and they tell you they can’t accept your check.
Stores use check-guarantee companies to get reports on checks that the 
bank sends back stamped NSF, known as returned checks. By helping 
merchants identify customers who are passing bad checks, the check-
guarantee companies help the merchants minimize their losses.
The check-guarantee companies also protect the customer. For example, 
when you notify the companies that checks have been lost or stolen, they 
alert retailers for you. In addition, you can request a consumer report from 
an agency, such as SCAN (Shared Check Authorization Network). SCAN isn’t 
a credit bureau; it’s a consumer-reporting agency that’s governed by the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). You can dispute inaccurate information on your 
SCAN report just as you can credit bureau information. 

103
 Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb
Savings account statements
Savings account statements need to be shredded; otherwise, don’t place 
them in the trash. The savings account statement contains information — 
such as your name and address, account numbers, and even a balance — 
that identity thieves could use to help them in their quest to obtain your 
identity. The name of your bank is also on the statement (with the bank’s 
phone number). Even if the thieves can’t access your account with the 
information on the statement, it’s enough to let them know how much 
money you have. They’ll find other ways to access your account, especially 
if it will yield a great payday!
Utility bills
Among the papers and various stuff you find in the trash are the Detach for 
Your Records parts of your utility bills. This part of the bill has your name, 
address, and account number on it. Utility bills — telephone, water, garbage, 
and electric to name a few — are used as proof of address to open accounts 
at the local bank in your name. The identity thief can put them to good use 
if you don’t shred them before you discard them. Don’t give identity thieves 
the chance to use your discarded utility bills for their gain and your pain. 
Shred or tear up the part you’re going to throw away.
Cellphone bills
Cellphone bills have the appearance of not being something you need to 
think about when you’re taking precautionary measures to prevent you from 
becoming a victim of identity theft, but consider the following: Cellphone 
bills have your name, address, account number, and cellphone number all 
right there on the bill stub that you’re given to keep for your records (and, if 
you’re like most everyone, you promptly discard). An identity thief can use 
your bill stub as proof of address to open a bank account in your name. To 
protect yourself, shred or tear up your cellphone bill before you discard it. 
With just your phone number, you can become the victim of slamming or 
scamming; to find out more, go to

104
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
Old tax returns
Your tax returns have your address, SSN, employers’ names and addresses, 
how much you make, bank accounts, stock account information, and so on. 
Never discard old tax returns without shredding them first. A tax return that 
isn’t shredded is the mother lode of all finds for an identity thief. You’ll be 
the identity thief’s best friend, and you won’t even know it until the bills roll 
in and the collection agencies start to hound you.
 
Throwing out old tax returns without shredding them will definitely cause a 
great deal of pain for you for a long time. To prevent having a mess to clean 
up, shred it.
Cancelled checks
Most folks simply throw cancelled checks (ones they don’t need for tax 
purposes) in the trash. Most of the time, people discard checks without 
tearing or shredding them. The checks contain important information, 
however, such as your name, address, account number, and the name and 
address of your bank.
To the identity thief, the information contained on the checks is what’s 
important — not the actual checks. The identity thief can use your account 
information to make counterfeit checks to either clean out your account or to 
write bad checks in your name. The thief can also order stuff online by using 
your checking account information like a debit card, except that the money 
for the item purchased comes directly out of your checking account.
If you aren’t going to keep all your cancelled checks, destroy them before you 
throw them away. Another option is to have your bank hold your cancelled 
checks for safekeeping and not send them to you with your monthly statement. 
You must pay a fee to have your bank hold your checks, and the fee varies 
from bank to bank. To find out whether your bank offers the check safekeeping 
service, call the phone number listed on your checking account statement.
Expired driver’s licenses
Before you toss your old driver’s license in the trash, destroy it. I don’t mean 
cut it in half; I mean totally destroy it like you would your old credit card.
Your driver’s license number can be used to make a counterfeit license with 
your name and address. To prevent counterfeiting, most states issue driver’s 
licenses that have holograms or offset photos of the licensee on them. To 

105
 Chapter 7: Watching What You Set on the Curb
see the hologram, however, you need to remove the license from the wallet 
picture window. Most businesses don’t ask a person writing a check to 
remove the license; they just quickly jot down the license number on the 
check. If a license isn’t checked closely, an identity thief can get away with 
cashing counterfeit checks by using the counterfeit license.
Some shredders are strong enough to shred a driver’s license or credit card, 
thus keeping them from falling into the waiting hands of the identity thief. If 
you don’t have a shredder, cut the old driver’s license into small pieces so 
that it isn’t worth the effort to put it together to read your date of birth and 
driver’s license number.
If you notice judgments for parking tickets or other DMV fines, you may want 
to order a copy of your DMV driving record. There is usually a small fee to 
order the printout. 
Old credit and debit cards
Your old credit and debit cards contain important information even if they’re 
expired. These cards should never be tossed without cutting or shredding 
them. By cutting them up, I mean cutting them into several small pieces and 
putting them in different trash cans; don’t just cut them in half or in a few 
large pieces that can be put back together easily. The magnetic stripes have 
information, such as the cardholder name, card number, address, and so on. 
Don’t risk it; be safe and shred your old cards.
Hotel key cards
A great deal of debate has been going on about whether hotel key cards con-
tain personal information on the magnetic stripe on the card. Computerworld 
magazine did a study on the hotel key myth to find out whether the keys 
actually contain personal information, such as your name, address, and in 
some cases, your full credit card number, that identity thieves could use to 
steal your identity. The staffers at the magazine had a magnetic card reader 
maker attempt to read the data on 100 cards from major hotels. Even with 
state of the art high-tech scanners, the cards were unreadable. The reason 
for this is that each hotel uses a unique code (known as the facility code) and 
no two facility codes are alike so the cards can’t be read by any other hotel’s 
reader. You need the particular reader that can read the facility code for that 
particular hotel. Read about the study here:
www.computerworld.com/s/article/107701/It_s_Just_the_Key_
to_Your_Room

106
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
So the bottom line is this: If you feel uncomfortable, don’t leave the key in 
the room and take the key with you when you check out. Some hotels charge 
nominal fees ($3 to $5) for unreturned keys to cover the costs of replacing 
the card. The fee is small enough, so if you are insecure about the card being 
returned with your information on it, you can just take the card and pay the 
fee.
 
When you get home, make sure you check your credit card statement closely 
for any charges you don’t recognize after or during your visit to the hotel. This 
helps make sure no one got your card number from the hotel key — especially 
if you lost the key and had to get another one from the front desk.
The real issue with hotel keys that’s proven correct is that thieves have 
copied stolen credit card numbers (from other sources) onto the stolen hotel 
keys’ magnetic stripes. These cards can then be used to purchase only gas — 
because the magnetic stripe is the only thing that’s read during the purchase 
at the pump. Obviously the hotel key/credit card can’t be used to make 
purchases in a store because it still looks like a hotel key and doesn’t have 
the credit issuer’s logo on it. If the thieves don’t get the security code on the 
back of the card, they may not be able to order anything on the Internet or 
on the phone.
 
If you do take the hotel key (either unintentionally or on purpose), destroy it 
before discarding it. Destroying it means shredding it or cutting it into little 
pieces — not just cutting the card in half. Whether the key contains your

n this chapter, I tell you why it’s important to watch what you say about 
your personal information in public places, how to choose and use an 
ATM, and the importance of keeping your credit card receipts. I also show 
you how to keep your personal checks from being counterfeited or stolen, 
the smartest ways to hang on to your wallet or purse, and how to avoid 
shoulder-surfing thieves.
Carrying Minimal Personal Information
This is an easy secret: The less personal information you carry, the less 
personal information an identity thief can steal from you. The following 
sections discuss some simple measures you can take to prevent your 
important information from being stolen.
Do not carry your Social Security card
Don’t under any circumstances ever carry your Social Security card in your 
wallet or purse. Lose your wallet or purse — or worse, have it stolen — and 
you lose your Social Security card. Your Social Security Number (SSN) is an 
important identifier in society; the number can be sold or used by anyone 
when she has your card.

108
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
The only times you need to carry your Social Security card is when you start 
a new job (so that the Human Resources department can photocopy it) or 
when you apply for government benefits. After you return home from your 
first day at a new job or after you apply for those government benefits, take 
your Social Security card out of your wallet or purse and place it in the fireproof 
safe where you keep your other important documents for safekeeping.
 
Be stingy with your SSN. Nobody but the government can require you to 
reveal your Social Security Number. Others — such as utility companies for 
opening a utility account — can deny you service if you don’t reveal your SSN. 
You don’t have to give your SSN to any business that asks for it, except when 
completing a credit application or for verification purposes your first day on a 
new job.
If you suspect or know that someone is using your SSN to get a job, contact 
the Social Security Administration at www.ssa.gov and the IRS at www.irs.
gov (to avoid tax problems). On the other hand, if someone is using your SSN 
to get credit, the Social Security Administration can’t fix your credit, and I 
suggest that you follow the steps I outline in Chapter 2.
You can see whether someone is using your SSN to get a job by checking 
your Social Security statement. You can order a statement online or contact 
the nearest Social Security Administration office and request one. In addition 
to any statement you request, a statement is sent to you annually.
 
Memorize your SSN, and you won’t have a need to carry your Social Security 
card. Problem solved!
 
Still I find that people do carry their Social Security card with them in their wallet 
or purse. The other day, I was in line next to a woman making a purchase at a 
store; she pulled out her debit card and — to my surprise — right next to her 
driver’s license was her Social Security card! Not a smart move. If her purse is 
stolen (or even lost), all her personal information — driver’s license with her 
address and birth date and her SSN — is right there for the taking.
 
I repeat: There is no reason to carry your Social Security card with you other 
than the first day on a new job. The information is used to verify that you have 
a right to work in the U.S. and to fill out the forms for tax purposes (W-2). Be 
vigilant about protecting your identity!
Memorize your bank ATM PIN
Choose an ATM personal identification number (PIN) that you can remember 
easily. This way, you don’t need to write it down. Writing down your PIN defeats 
the purpose of having a PIN. Writing down your PIN and carrying it in your wallet 
or purse with your ATM card is an especially bad idea. If your wallet or purse is 
stolen or lost, you lose your PIN and possibly your money as well.

109
 Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places
 
When you choose a PIN, don’t use your birthday, your children’s or spouse’s 
birthday, your SSN, your address, and so on. These numbers are too easy to 
guess. Try instead the last four digits of a friend’s phone number (not your 
own!) or a special date that isn’t your birthday.
 
Protect yourself. Don’t make it easy for would-be thieves to steal your 
hard-earned money. Memorize your PIN so that if you lose your ATM card, 
you can rest easy knowing the card is useless to anyone else.
Change your PIN at least annually and any time you think your password 
has been compromised. I know — remembering all the passwords, PINs, and 
so on is difficult. But when you choose a PIN or password, select something 
that’s easy for you to remember but is hard for someone else to guess. The 
PIN should be at least eight characters long with a combination of letters 
in upper- and lowercase as well as symbols. Some online Web sites will not 
accept a password that doesn’t meet their standard of using lower- and 
uppercase letters with symbols. Some symbols will not be accepted in some 
systems, so be sure to follow what is acceptable.
For banking and other online financial purposes, use a different username and 
password than what you use for your social networking accounts. Why make 
it easy for the thief?
Carry one credit card
Look in your wallet or purse. How many credit cards are in there? You 
probably have several cards in your wallet, and even some you forgot you 
were carrying and haven’t used in a long time. So right now, stop reading and 
take out all the extra credit cards in your wallet. You’ll be glad you did.
Carrying more than one credit card only compounds your problems when 
your wallet or purse is stolen or lost, so just don’t do it. Take retail store 
credit cards, for example. The only time you need to carry a retail store 
credit card is when you’re going to that store. In fact, most retail stores now 
accept the major credit cards, so how many different cards do you really 
need? The fewer cards you have, the less you have to worry about if your 
wallet or purse is stolen or lost.
 
You’re striving to become a hard target, which means that you’re practicing 
prevention. If you carry less personal information, you’ll be a harder target. If 
someone does get your wallet, he won’t have as much personal information 
about you as he does about the other person who was nice enough to carry all 
his credit cards at one time.

110
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
Carry personal checks only 
when necessary
Carrying your personal checks everywhere you go isn’t the best idea. I 
realize that at times, you need to purchase something on the spur of the 
moment and having your checks with you comes in real handy. But losing 
your blank checks can be a drain on your checking account balance if 
someone finds and uses the checks to help themselves to your money. 
Consider some alternatives, such as using cash or the one major credit 
card that you carry in your wallet or purse.
If you do lose your blank checks, contact someone at the bank immediately 
and have her freeze your account to cover outstanding checks written on the 
account. You may need to open a new account.
 
After you write a check, make sure that you only tear out the one you just 
wrote and not the next one along with it, which is blank. Giving a blank check 
to someone could be a problem for you, depending upon the honesty of the 
person to whom you unknowingly hand the blank check.
 
Minimize your exposure by carrying your personal checks only when you 
know you’ll need them. The less often you carry your personal checks, the 
less chance you have of losing them or having them stolen.
 
Here are some other tips for keeping your checks secure:
 
✓ Do not put your driver’s license number or SSN on your checks.
 
✓ Make sure that you can account for all your checks — used, unused, and 
void.
 
✓ When you pay by check, be aware of your surroundings while you write 
and sign the check. If someone looks over your shoulder, she can easily 
memorize your name and address and the name of the bank where you 
have your account.
 
✓ Be careful with the check registers that are a carbon of the check you 
just wrote. If you lose the register, the information in the carbon can be 
a problem. The carbon in the register has the check number, account 
number (for most banks), bank name, and your signature (often blocked 
out by a black box). Keep these check registers in an especially safe 
location when shopping.
 
✓ When you void checks, destroy them before you discard them, and do 
not forget to record in your register that check number XYZ has been 
voided and the date you voided it.

111
 Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places
Lately, I’ve noticed women carrying checkbooks in their wallets. Most 
women’s wallets have a place for a checkbook. Although it’s convenient to 
carry your checkbook, it isn’t a good idea. If the purse is stolen, so is your 
checkbook. Keeping your checkbook in your car isn’t a good idea either. By 
all means, carry your checkbook if you intend to make purchases; but don’t 
carry it when you go dancing or to the amusement park to ride the rides. On 
vacation, carry traveler’s checks rather than your personal checkbook. 
With the widespread use of debit cards, you really don’t need to carry your 
checkbook.
The Walls Have Ears and Eyes
Identity thieves have no dignity. They’ll stop at nothing to get your personal 
information, even if it means looking over your shoulder while you’re at the 
register, eavesdropping on your wireless phone conversations at the mall, 
monitoring the use of public Wi-Fi connections, or even setting up fake, 
free connections. Don’t let these bandits get the best of you. The following 
sections show you how to defend yourself against these crimes.
Shoulder surfing
Shoulder surfing isn’t the latest water sport craze to hit the beaches of 
Southern California, and it has nothing to do with the real sport of surfing. 
Shoulder surfing describes the art of looking over the shoulder of another 
person to see what he’s doing.
Shoulder surfing got its start in airports, bus stations, and train stations. 
Thieves would record the phone credit card numbers of those unsuspecting 
victims who were using a public phone to make telephone calls. How it works 
is that the person may be standing alongside you, pretending to use the 
adjacent pay telephone, but what she’s actually doing is watching you punch 
in your phone credit card number and PIN. The person doing the shoulder 
surfing doesn’t have to be directly behind you or even next to you; he can be 
in direct line of sight looking through a camera with a zoom lens to record 
the punching in of the numbers. He then writes down the number and sells it 
to others for their use.
These days, shoulder surfing is used to capture your PIN when you use your 
ATM and key in your PIN. With the advent of camera cellphones, it’s easier 
than ever to fetch your account and PIN.

112
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
 
So what can you do? Here are two easy ways to help protect your identity:
 
✓ Protect your keystrokes from plain view when you key in your PIN. 
You never know who’s watching even a short distance away, so block 
their view with your body.
 
✓ Check whether the ATM slot looks like someone tampered with it. You 
can usually see cracking or some other telltale mark, or your card won’t 
go into the slot easily. If you see anything like this, don’t use the ATM.
 
Beware of this sophisticated trick: Some thieves will actually place a camera 
close to the keypad, usually in the deposit envelope holder. The camera sits 
in the bottom of the holder and is aimed at the keypad to capture your 
keystrokes. In addition, they modify the place where you insert your ATM 
card. They place a portable reader in the slot, which reads your card number 
and then displays a message stating that the ATM isn’t working.
Be careful what you say
Cellphones are in widespread use today. You can hear people talking on their 
phones everywhere. I don’t know what the deal is, but people think you need 
to talk loudly into cellphones, and consequently, you can plainly and clearly 
hear one side of the conversation.
Now, if the person using the cell is ordering something, you can hear him 
give his credit card type, number, expiration date, and name. All that a thief 
needs to do is write down the information and voilà, she has a credit card to 
use to order stuff on the phone. You also sometimes hear someone giving his 
SSN over the cellphone in a public place. This is not a good idea at all.
Conversations between you and someone who’s with you in a public place 
can also be overheard, so be careful what you discuss about your personal 
information. Discussing personal information in public places just isn’t a 
good idea if you want to be a hard target.
 
Think of your personal information as sensitive information that if discovered, 
may help someone assume your identity. The walls have ears — you never 
know who’s listening and trying to pick up personal information to use to his 
advantage. There was a saying during World War II, loose lips sink ships. The 
phrase makes perfect sense in the prevention of identity theft.

 Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places
Keeping Track of Important Things
If you’ve ever lost your wallet or have had a credit card number stolen, 
you know what I’m talking about here: Big trouble, big pain in the neck. The 
sections that follow provide some tips for managing those pesky receipts and 
preventing them from falling into the wrong hands. You also get the rundown 
on what to do if your wallet goes missing.
Checking credit card receipts
Look at the credit card receipt you just signed. Does it have your full credit 
card number, name, and expiration date printed on it? The law has changed 
and only the last digits will be printed on all copies of the credit card receipt 
in the near future. But for now, those receipts contain all the information an 
identity thief needs to wreak havoc with your credit.
Here are some ways to safeguard your information:
 
✓ Don’t leave your copy of the credit card receipt behind at the register. 
The receipt has too much information on it.
 
✓ Don’t throw away your receipt in a trash can near the area where you 
just used your credit card. Keep all your receipts so that you can 
reconcile your monthly bill and then shred them before you throw them 
away.
 
✓ Don’t leave the receipt you signed on the table in a restaurant. Make 
sure that your server picks it up before you go.
 
✓ Beware of skimming. This activity occurs mostly at restaurants. The 
waiter has a small handheld device that he swipes your card through. 
The device captures the data off the magnetic strip on the card. The 
data contains enough information that can be transferred to another 
magnetic strip of a counterfeit card, which can be used fraudulently. If 
possible, make sure that your waiter doesn’t perform this activity with 
your card.
 
✓ When you review your receipt, make sure that no one around you can 
read it along with you, especially if the receipt has your full credit card 
number and expiration date printed on it.

114
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
Losing your wallet or purse
Losing your wallet or purse is a pain in the neck. If you lose it, you have some 
work to do. Do the following:
 
✓ Take an assessment and think of what was in your wallet or purse. Keep 
a list of what you carry to refresh your memory if your wallet or purse is 
lost or stolen. 
 
 For a checklist that can help you remember and document all the things 
you carry with you, check out this site:
www.idtheftcenter.org/artman2/publish/v_fact_sheets/
Fact_Sheet_104.shtml
Choosing a safe ATM
When you’re going to use an ATM, choose it 
carefully. Here are some tips for choosing and 
using an ATM:
 ✓ Use an ATM that’s both familiar and 
comfortable to you.
 ✓ Scope out the area before you approach 
the ATM. If you feel uncomfortable for any 
reason, move on.
 ✓ Have your ATM card out and in your hand 
as you approach the ATM.
 ✓ Check out the ATM. Look for any signs that 
the machine has been tampered with. For 
example, if attachments are protruding 
from the card slot or keypad, or if the screen 
is blank, find a different machine.
 ✓ Avoid using ATMs that have messages 
attached saying that the instructions for 
use have changed; banks don’t post such 
messages directing you to use a specific 
ATM.
 ✓ Observe other people using the ATM and 
notice if they’re having difficulty. That may 
be an indication of trouble.
 ✓ Make sure that the area around is well-
lighted at night.
 ✓ Be aware of your surroundings. Watch the 
person next to you or behind you.
 ✓ Use your body to hide what you enter on the 
keypad.
 ✓ Take your receipt with you. Do not throw it 
away in the trash cans near the ATM.
 ✓ Don’t forget to take your ATM card from the 
slot.
 ✓ Avoid using non-bank ATM machines; 
they can be set up to collect card and PIN 
numbers.
 ✓ Check your bank statement for withdrawals 
by ATM to make sure you made them. With 
online banking, you can check as soon as 
you get to a secure computer.
 ✓ Never check your bank balances or do any 
online banking from a public computer.

115
 Chapter 8: Practicing Discretion in Public Places
 
✓ Take out all your credit card contact numbers you’ve stored in a safe 
place and begin calling them. Tell your creditors that you had your 
wallet stolen or lost your driver’s license.
 
✓ Contact someone at the DMV in your state and let her know you lost 
your driver’s license.
 
✓ Contact someone at your bank and tell him to cancel your ATM card and 
issue a new one.
 
✓ If you were carrying checks, contact the bank and freeze your account.
 
If you lose your wallet or purse, take action immediately — don’t delay. As 
soon as you realize your wallet or purse is gone, get to work. Follow the 
actions that I outline in the preceding list. The sooner you do, the less damage 
will be done.
Ordering Stuff by Phone
To order stuff by phone, all you need to provide is the name on your credit 
card, the card number, and the expiration date. Most companies that take 
phone orders also ask for the security code on the back of your credit card. 
For Visa, MasterCard, and Discover card, this is a three-digit number on the 
back of the card; for American Express, this is a four-digit number on the 
front of the card. This provides some level of security that wasn’t utilized 
several years ago. For someone to use your credit card to order merchandise, 
he needs the security code. This means he needs to have your card in his 
possession or to know the security code.
This goes for small purchases and large purchases alike. For added security, 
some businesses ask for the three- or four-digit security number on the back of 
the card, but your signature and your photo ID aren’t verified. This purchasing 
scenario is ideal for an identity thief who’s using stolen credit cards.
When you place a phone order, you need to know the company — don’t call 
a company you’re not familiar with — and you need to check your monthly 
statement. Problems occur when you don’t follow the simple rules of knowing 
who you’re ordering stuff from and not checking your monthly card statement. 
Don’t order anything from unsolicited callers offering a service or product, 
especially if you’d be making an impulsive purchase.
Always get an order or confirmation number and the name of the customer 
service rep that helped you. Also record the date and time you placed the order. 
This way, you have a fallback if something goes kerflooey with your order.
 
When you order stuff by phone, guard your privacy. Don’t use a cellphone or 
place the order in a public place. It’s too easy for someone to eavesdrop on 
your call and capture your credit card information.

116
Part III: Being Smart with Your Sensitive Information 
Mike’s story: It happened to me
My wife and I used my credit card to order 
a Turbo Cooker that was advertised on TV 
several years ago. We received the product 
a few weeks later as expected, but when our 
monthly credit card statement arrived and we 
checked it like we always do, we noticed several 
charges on the statement we didn’t make.
I contacted someone at the card company and 
told her that we didn’t make the charges and we 
wanted them removed from the statement. The 
card company removed the charges. But then 
the next month’s statement had new charges 
from the companies again. I called the phone 
number that was next to one of the charges and 
told someone there that I didn’t authorize any 
charges from their company and wanted the 
charges removed from our card. I also called 
the card company and talked to someone in the 
fraud department. She said that she was familiar 
with the company making the charges, and she 
would take care of it. On the next month’s state-
ment, the charges were removed.
The company advertising its product on TV was 
legitimate, but one of the people answering 
the phone or processing the calls wasn’t so 
trustworthy. The card number was probably 
provided to the company making the unauthorized 
charges on our card for a fee.
We were lucky because we check our monthly 
credit card statement religiously. Some 
companies that make unauthorized charges 
are banking on the fact that most people don’t 
check their monthly statements, and therefore, 
their charges aren’t disputed immediately, if 
at all.
I’ve ordered other things by phone and haven’t 
had any problems. Ordering stuff by phone 
isn’t inherently unsafe, but you do need to be 
vigilant and check your monthly bill to make sure 
that it contains only charges you authorized. 
If charges appear that you didn’t authorize, 
dispute them immediately.
The company selling the product we purchased 
hired a firm to take the calls and place the 
orders, which is how the problem occurred. 
The person taking the information may not 
have been honest and made a few extra bucks 
selling credit card information. The other 
possibility is that the company taking the calls 
didn’t shred the order forms and then someone 
did a little dumpster diving, found the credit 
card numbers, and used them.
The moral to the story is to check your monthly 
credit card statement every month. You never 
know when your card will have charges you 
didn’t make. When you check your credit 
card statement monthly, you can catch these 
unsolicited charges and get the issue resolved 
quickly with the credit card company.

n this chapter, I discuss the companies that claim they can help prevent 
identity theft. Numerous prevention services are out there, and in this 
chapter, I look at several large companies and outline the services provided 
by each. Also, I show you the benefits of hiring a company to safeguard your

Sizing Up Identity Theft 
Protection Companies
An identity theft protection company does just that — helps protect you 
against identity theft — but it also helps you recover your good name should 
you become a victim. How do you know what company will ensure that 
you get what you want? A good place to do some research is at the Better 
Business Bureau (BBB) Web site:
www.bbbonline.org

120
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
The BBB has a rating system that can help you decide what identity theft 
company you want to deal with. When you go to the site, click the For 
Consumers link. Then type in a description of the business (in this case, type 
identity theft protection) and choose your state from the drop-down list. 
You see the companies that fit the description you typed. To the right of the 
company’s name, click the View BBB Report button to see information about 
that company. In the following list, I describe the highlights of what you see:
 
✓ BBB Accredited Business logo: If you see this logo associated with a 
company, you know that company supports the BBB’s services to the 
public. This means the company makes a good effort to resolve cus-
tomer complaints.
 
✓ An alphabetic rating (A–F): This rating displays in the center of the 
page. To the right of the rating, click the Rating Explanation link for 
more information about how the BBB evaluates companies.
 
✓ Company Profile: Here you find out how old the company is, where it’s 
located, who its contact person is, and so on.
 
✓ BBB Comments & Analysis: This box contains further information that 
the BBB has chosen to share with consumers beyond the ratings.
 
✓ Complaint Closing Statistics: Near the bottom of the company’s page 
is a box containing stats on how many (and what type of) complaints 
against the company have been filed and whether the company has 
resolved the complaints.
 
The ratings on the BBB site for companies range from A (good) to F (bad). If a 
company has an F rating, the BBB doesn’t recommend you do business with 
them. A word of caution here is necessary: Think long and hard about signing 
on with a company that has an F rating.
So what do the ratings mean? Well, the ratings are based on customer com-
plaints and how the company responds to those complaints. Customer service 
is a major source of complaints. Are you getting the services? Does the product 
perform according to what was advertised? How does the company address 
your complaint when you call or write it and are all the complaints about cus-
tomer service? If the complaints to the BBB are unresolved or go unanswered, 
you may want to consider moving on and avoiding that company.
To find the rating for each company:
 
1. Go to the BBB Web site and click the For Consumers link.
 
2. On the page that appears, click the For Consumers link (yes, again, 
this time in the upper-left corner) and then click the Check Out a 
Business or Charity link.

that appears.
 
 Under Search Results, you see a list of companies that matched your 
criteria.
 
4. Click the View Report link to see more information.
Table 9-1 has information about five identity theft companies so that you 
can compare them side by side. When an account is administratively closed, 
the BBB closed the open complaint because the business did not respond or 
when the BBB asserts that the business made a reasonable effort to contact 
the complainant to resolve the complaint but was unsuccessful and the com-
plainant did not respond.

By using the BBB and other independent sources, you can gather enough 
information on whether you want to do business with a particular company. 
Be careful to make sure you’re getting unbiased, truly independent business 
ratings. This is also true for any business, not just for identity theft preven-
tion companies. Researching the identity theft prevention companies helps 
you make an informed choice. The last thing you want to do is pick a com-
pany that says it’ll protect your identity and then come to find out that when 
you need that company, it’s not there for you.
Identity Theft Prevention Services
In recent years, companies have stated that they’ll help keep you safe 
from identity theft for a fee. These companies provide guarantees that if 
you become a victim while a client, they’ll offer various remedies. Five of 

122
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
these companies are LifeLock, ID Watchdog, TrustedID, Identity Guard, and 
Truston — the ones I discuss in the earlier section, “Sizing Up Identity Theft 
Protection Companies.” The companies’ services are based on the premises 
that they monitor your credit report, alert you if any changes occur to it, and 
place a fraud alert on it.
But just what are the services provided by these companies? It all depends. 
Although many of these companies provide similar services, the services do 
vary from company to company as does the type of company. For example, 
if preventing the theft of your identity is important to you, choose a com-
pany that provides the service. Some companies help guide you through the 
process to recovering your identity if you’re a victim but may not actually 
provide prevention services. Although today, most provide recovery and pre-
vention as a bundled service.
Numerous service providers are out there, and I don’t have enough room in 
this book to review them all, so here I review the same five I discuss earlier.
Note: You don’t need to use any of the companies that I discuss in this chapter. 
The services these companies offer are in line with the industry standards.
The following list describes the most common services offered by identity 
theft protection companies:
 
✓ Credit monitoring: The company establishes a baseline with a snap-
shot of where your credit report is at in a given time period. After you 
approve the report, the company then monitors changes in the credit 
report with the baseline report. These companies monitor credit reports 
on a monthly basis. This is not a fraud alert; it is routine monitoring of 
your credit reports. 
 
 This is similar to what the credit bureaus provide except you have one 
place to get all three monitored instead of going to each bureau and 
paying for the service or opting for all three by one bureau.
 
✓ Fraud alerts: Due to a recent court decision, the identity theft preven-
tion company cannot place a fraud alert on your credit report; only you 
can do that.

✓ Credit freezes: I discuss the freeze, or credit lock, in detail in Chapter 
2. For the credit freeze, you don’t need to be a victim; however, it’s free 
to victims. Non-victims have to pay to place the freeze, and to thaw the 
freeze, they have to pay again.

✓ Repair/recovery: The companies also provide you with repair services 
and a warranty guarantee of their services if you become an identity 
theft victim while subscribing to their prevention services. The credit 
bureaus also provide similar services. Generally, they help with the 
paperwork to file with the creditors, credit bureaus, and so on.
 
✓ Guarantee: Some provide a guarantee saying they’ll pay for any losses 
you sustain if you become a victim. Usually a limit is applied to the 
dollar amount recovered. Make sure you read and understand the fine 
print to find out exactly what’s covered by the guarantee.
 
 The dispute process is outlined in case you have an issue with the com-
pany’s services. In most cases, disputes are resolved through media-
tion (arbitration) rather than lawsuits. (See the “Reviewing Dispute 
Resolution Methods” section, later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Blogs/e-newsletters: These services keep you informed about what’s 
occurring on the identity theft front and the latest tools that the thieves 
are using to attempt to steal your identity.
 
✓ Identity theft resources: Sites such as www.privacyrights.org/
identity.htm, www.idtheftcenter.org, and www.identity
theft.org will also provide timely information about identity theft 
trends and so on. The better informed you are about the current trends 
in identity theft, the more knowledge you’ll have and the more power 
you have to prevent you from becoming a victim. 
 
Although I give you the information you need to make an informed decision 
of whether to use a company’s services, make sure to do your homework and 
research any company you’re thinking of doing business with. After you have 
your questions answered, you can make a good decision that will help give 
you peace of mind.
 
Some companies require that you provide copies of your IDs, a power of attor-
ney, and other sensitive documents as soon as you become a member. Others 
request those documents only if you have a case opened with an advocate 
after you’re a victim of identity theft, and they maintain a strict document 
destruction policy to safeguard your information. Just as you should question 
others who maintain sensitive documents, closely examine what informa-
tion these companies want to access and their hiring practices. Do they have 
complete background checks? Do you have the direct phone extensions of the 
people you talk to so you can call them directly? You’ll be relying on this com-
pany at a time when you’re stressed, emotional, and feeling violated. Make 
sure upfront that you feel comfortable that it’s trustworthy. 

124
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
A company that provides identity theft protection is different from one that 
provides restoration help. A restoration company guides you through the 
process if you become a victim. The restoration company will help with the 
forms that need to be filed, help you keep a log of what has been done, and 
so on.
Comparing Costs and Services
Identity Theft Labs (www.identitytheftlabs.com), a contracted affiliate 
of a handful of identity theft companies, is a group of individuals who evalu-
ate the services provided by LifeLock, TrustedID, ID Watchdog, Debix, and 
Identity Guard. The group, which claims to bring an unbiased view of the 
companies to consumers, associates itself only with those companies whose 
services it endorses. When you go to the Web site, you see a table compar-
ing the top-four identity theft prevention companies; Debix isn’t in the table 
and hasn’t been reviewed. The Unbiased Reviews row contains a link for each 
company; clicking the link takes you to a Web site with more information 
about that company and its service.
Staying on top of your credit with monthly alerts
Monthly alerts keep you posted on what’s going 
on with your credit. However, most monitoring 
services will notify you in an e-mail alert that 
your credit has changed within 24 hours after 
it’s occurred. If you don’t get 24-hour e-mail 
alerts when your credit changes, you may not 
want to use that service provider. This is impor-
tant because being notified monthly — even 
though it’s better than nothing — is a long time 
to go without knowing that major changes have 
occurred in your credit. I discuss how to read 
credit reports in more detail in Chapter 5; it’s 
important for you to know how to interpret your 
credit report. When you know what to look for, 
you’ll better know how to determine if incorrect 
information is on the report that you need to 
dispute.
Note: You’re likely to get a lot of false alerts, 
depending on the program. Often small 
changes end up sending notifications to you. 
These changes, such as 123 SE Main Street 
to 123 S.E. Main St., don’t necessarily indicate 
identity theft. Other companies have attempted 
to compensate for this by lowering the sensitiv-
ity. Unfortunately, that means that early signs of 
identity theft might not be caught. The bottom 
line is that there’s no substitute for monitoring 
your own credit report.

125
 Chapter 9: Avoiding Loss of Your Identity: Online Services That Can Help
Although Identity Theft Labs didn’t review Truston, it’s an alternative that 
provides identity theft prevention/repair. As I explain earlier in this chapter, 
Truston is a BBB-accredited business.
 
There’s no such thing as 100-percent security or prevention, so if a company 
claims 100 percent, don’t sign up with it even if it’s in writing. Read the guar-
antee closely and you’ll probably find a loophole because no company would 
guarantee 100-percent protection from identity theft.
All the service providers that offer identity theft prevention or protection 
usually charge a monthly or annual fee for their services. The monthly ser-
vice fees charged by each company are different depending on the services. 
In Table 9-2, I look at the fees for these services. Some companies offer one 
service and one fee. Other companies offer a choice, but the price doesn’t 
vary too much.
The costs for services pale in comparison to the cost of becoming an identity 
theft victim. Table 9-2 has the breakdown for each of the five companies I dis-
cuss in this chapter. In the sections that follow, I give a brief rundown of the 
services offered by each.
Keep in mind, the monthly costs are for illustrative purposes; some of the 
companies require an annual contract, so the amount is paid in full for the 
number of years based on the plan you select. The more years you sign up 
for, the lower the annual cost, but you’re locked in to the contract terms. 
Other companies request full payment upfront for the plan you select.

Truston
As I mention earlier, Truston hasn’t been reviewed by Identity Theft Labs; 
however, it is BBB accredited and worth discussing. Truston has individual 
subscriptions, but the bulk of what the company does is market its services 
for other major players, such as credit card companies, banks, and so on, 
who then provide the service to their clients. Truston provides similar ser-
vices as the four that Identity Theft Labs reviewed.
Truston is an online service (see Figure 9-5) in which you can sign on through 
a portal — MyTruston. To sign up, sensitive information isn’t required. 
Truston also has an advantage over other identity theft prevention compa-
nies because it sends reminder e-mails to do certain things such as what to 
do next in the recovery process. Truston also provides reminder e-mails to 
ensure all paperwork and tasks are completed if you become a victim. If you 
become a victim, this helps you stay on task and not miss any important doc-
umentation. Truston takes you through a step-by-step process, which takes 
the complexity out of what to do if you’ve been a victim.

Truston offers the following services:
 
✓ Credit reports: Ensures you receive your three free credit reports 
annually.
 
✓ Identity theft recovery services: Sends reminder e-mails to ensure that 
steps are followed and completed.
 
✓ Prevention services: Sends out credit bureau fraud alerts, freezes your 
credit report, stops preapproved credit card offers, and stops telemarket-
ing calls.
 
✓ Fraud alerts: Reminds you to place a fraud alert on your credit reports 
if you have been a victim. Reminds you to set up checking account fraud 
alerts with Chex Systems.
 
✓ Database: Saves all your information — such as who was contacted and 
when — in a database. Contact information is not saved. Not saving 
personal information is a good thing because it’s one less place that has 
your personal information.
Uncovering the Benefits of an Identity 
Theft Prevention Company
The benefits of subscribing to the services provided by identity theft pre-
vention companies is definitely cheaper than becoming a victim of identity 
theft. According to a report published by the BBB and the Javelin Strategy & 
Research identity theft fraud survey in 2004, the average cost per individual 
victim is $5,686. None of the companies charge more than that for their ser-
vices. So what are the benefits for using an identity theft prevention company? 

131
 Chapter 9: Avoiding Loss of Your Identity: Online Services That Can Help
Usually when you find out you’re an identity theft victim, considerable 
damage has been done already to your credit and reputation. Therefore, you 
need to find out whether someone is using your identity to obtain credit as 
early as possible to minimize the damage. The best solution is to prevent you 
from becoming a victim in the first place.
Even though someone monitors your credit reports and places fraud alerts or 
freezes on your report, that does not guarantee that you will never become a 
victim. What those actions do is ensure that certain tasks are done and cer-
tain prevention tools are put in place to help minimize your exposure. That’s 
the payoff for paying a yearly or monthly fee for the service. In the following 
section, I look at how each company addresses disputes it may have with you 
or any other client.
What can you do? You can place a freeze on your credit report. This can be 
done whether you’re a victim of identity theft or not; however, depending the 
state you live in, you may incur a cost for the credit freeze for each bureau 
to place that freeze on the report and to remove it if you are not a victim. 
The credit freeze can be an issue if you intend to make large purchases with 
credit. If you plan to do so, hold off placing the freeze until the purchases are 
complete to save you time and money. 
You can pay for credit monitoring from one of the three credit bureaus. If 
you choose to do this, make sure you opt for the three-in-one credit report, 
or whatever the bureau uses to monitor all three credit bureau reports at 
once. By monitoring all three reports, you can get a complete picture of 
what’s happening. Remember, not all creditors report to all three bureaus 
due to the cost. With monitoring, the bureau will send you an e-mail alert 
when any changes occur on your credit report within 24 hours of the 
change. Some also send a quarterly report regarding whether there are any 
alerts and how many.
 
You can and should monitor all your financial statements — credit card, bank 
statements, IRA, and so on — every month. You do this to make sure that your 
financial information hasn’t been compromised.
Reviewing Dispute Resolution Methods
When you’re collecting information to make a decision about which com-
pany to use for protecting your identity, review its policies for addressing 
disputes. You can find this in the Terms and Conditions or Terms of Use page 
of a company’s Web site. To continue with sign-up, you likely need to accept 
the terms and conditions or terms of use. You’ve probably seen similar terms 
on other Web sites and, like most everyone else, probably don’t read them 
and just click the I Accept button and move on. In this case, you need to read 

132
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
the terms and conditions — in fact, print them so you have them for future 
reference — to know the company’s dispute and cancellation policies. Each 
company has its own methods for handling disputes. In this section, I briefly 
outline the dispute resolution methods used by the same five companies I 
discuss throughout this chapter: LifeLock, ID Watchdog, TrustedID, Identity 
Guard, and Truston.
LifeLock
LifeLock uses arbitration to resolve disputes that may arise with its clients. At 
the top of the home page, click the About Us tab to go to the About LifeLock 
page. On the left side of the page, click the Terms and Conditions link below 
the About LifeLock heading. The Terms and Conditions page appears. Scroll 
down to the Arbitration section, which describes what the current process is 
to dispute a claim. When you read this section, note the following:
 
✓ You agree to the LifeLock dispute process.
 
✓ All disputes are settled confidentially in Maricopa County, Arizona, 
which is where LifeLock’s corporate office is located.
 
✓ All disputes are addressed by using the American Arbitration 
Association’s (AAA) rules for consumer-related disputes.
 
✓ The parties mutually agree to the selection of the arbitrator.
 
✓ When the consumer and the company can’t agree to an arbitrator within 
30 days of the notice, the AAA selects an arbitrator.
 
✓ The arbitration hearings are to take place in one day with both sides 
present supporting evidence. A decision of findings is made within 15 
days from the conclusion of the hearing.
 
✓ The decision of the arbitrator is final and binding on both parties.
 
✓ LifeLock will pay for the arbitration. Any other expense will be paid by 
the party that incurred the expense.
 
✓ You can appeal the decision to any state or federal court.
ID Watchdog
At the bottom of ID Watchdog’s home page is an About Us link, and below 
that link is the Terms & Conditions link. When you click the Terms & 
Conditions link, you’re taken to the Terms and Conditions page (makes 
sense, right?). Scroll down to the Dispute Resolution Process section, which 
involves three steps:

133
 Chapter 9: Avoiding Loss of Your Identity: Online Services That Can Help
 
1. Negotiation.
 
 If you or ID Watchdog has a dispute, both parties agree to a ten-business-
day resolution after being notified of the dispute by e-mail or telephone.
 
2. Mediation.
 
 If negotiation fails, you move to mediation. ID Watchdog uses the AAA 
to initiate a phone mediation from Denver, Colorado. This takes place 
within 15 business days of a failed negotiation.
 
3. Agreement to Arbitrate.
 
 If the dispute can’t be resolved within 30 days of a failed mediation, an 
arbitration hearing occurs in Denver, Colorado, at the AAA offices. Both 
parties attend the arbitration hearing, either in person or by telephone.
If both parties agree to arbitrate as outlined in the agreement, they give up 
their rights to litigate the claim in court.
TrustedID
TrustedID calls their terms and conditions service terms. To access these 
terms, find the About Us link at the bottom of Trusted ID’s home page. 
Scroll down the page and click the Service Terms link. This takes you to the 
Terms and Conditions page. Scroll to the Entire Agreement section at the 
bottom of the page and read the last paragraph of the section. This is the 
section that outlines dispute resolution. The following is a summary of the 
paragraph:
 
✓ TrustedID uses rules set forth by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration & 
Mediation Services), which is similar to AAA (American Arbitration 
Association), to settle disputes. Find out more about each at their 
respective Web sites:
www.jamsadr.com
www.adr.org
 
✓ If the parties can’t agree to an arbitrator within 15 days, JAMS will 
appoint one.
 
✓ The hearing is to take place in San Francisco, California.
 
✓ Both parties can seek litigation in the U.S. federal courts located in the 
Northern District of California.

134
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
Identity Guard
Identity Guard’s Terms of Use link can be found at the bottom of the home 
page. When you click the link, you’re taken to the Terms of Use page. Scroll 
down to the Choice of Law section and read it, especially the part that’s in all 
capital letters. The following is a summary of what the dispute process is for 
Identity Guard:
 
✓ The arbitration is binding on the parties and will be held in Washington, 
D.C.
 
✓ Identity Guard and you can’t consolidate or join any other claim or 
action in arbitration with any claim or action. In other words, no class 
action claims.
 
✓ You agree to accept the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and waive 
the right to laws in your own or other jurisdictions.
 
✓ Both parties can seek litigation in the U.S. federal courts located in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia.
Truston
Truston doesn’t collect personal information, it doesn’t have a service agree-
ment for you to sign, and you can cancel the service at anytime. Therefore, 
no terms and conditions are posted on its Web site.
The services are activated and maintained by the user; Truston provides the 
database for you to track and protect your identity yourself. Truston pro-
vides reminders for you to complete the tasks.

Thieves’ Scams and Methods
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding scams to get your personal information
▶ Knowing who is asking for your personal information
▶ Catching on to identity thieves’ tactics to scam you
B
ecause identity thieves will stop at nothing to get your personal 
information, you must maintain a vigilant attitude in thwarting their 
efforts. Lots of scammers are out there, trying lots of scams on lots of 
unsuspecting people. I don’t want you to be unsuspecting; I want you to be 
suspicious because being suspicious can save you a lot of heartache and 
money. To that end, I use this chapter to detail common scams, and I provide 
a section specifically discussing the methods scammers use to snare victims.
Being Stingy with Your Personal 
Information: Don’t Give It Out Freely
Identity thieves will stop at nothing to get your personal information. Your 
best protection is to be aware of your environment and guard your personal 
information. The following sections offer some guidance to keep you safe.
Who’s calling?
Thieves often call folks and say that they’re from a bank or a credit card 
company. The thief on the phone goes on and asks you for your full name, 
date of birth, Social Security Number (SSN), and credit card number. 
Don’t fall for these telephone scams, which fall into the category of social 
engineering.

136
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
Thieves use a number of scams, and they vary the themes daily. So before 
you leap and give the person on the other end of the phone the personal 
information she wants, ask why she needs the information and tell her you’ll 
get back to her after you check out her story. If you don’t feel comfortable, 
don’t give the info.
A new trend is to use phone number caller ID spoofing. Caller ID spoofing is 
when a company, person, or so on uses a phone number that doesn’t originate 
from the actual calling party’s phone. Numbers like 000-000-0000 display on 
your caller ID screen. The displayed number may also say Out of Area. Don’t 
answer any number that has all zeros in the caller ID display — it’s a spoofed 
number or is at least being hidden from you. Be suspicious of why someone, 
or some company, would want to hide his phone number by displaying all 
zeros.
Other calls display as Private or Unknown Number. People choose these 
options for various reasons so when they call you, you don’t know who’s 
calling until you answer the phone. I don’t answer any calls from unknown or 
private numbers, and I rarely accept calls from numbers I don’t recognize.
You can see how thieves can use the call spoofing and private or unknown 
caller technologies to work their scams. They can easily be anonymous so 
you don’t know who’s calling. When you answer, they can scam you with 
whatever scam, which is usually to get personal information, financial 
information, and so on.
To be safe, ask for a callback number. If the number came up on your 
phone’s display, search the phone number online at a Web site such as 
www.anywho.com. If the caller won’t give a callback number, hang up — 
especially if the number’s blocked or is displayed as Private or Unknown 
with no number displayed.
I recommend getting on the Do Not Call Registry. You can register online at 
www.donotcall.gov.
 
Give personal information over your landline telephone only to someone 
that you call. This way, you know who’s on the line. Just don’t give personal 
information over the telephone in a public place or on your cellphone. If you 
have only a cellphone (and no landline), be careful what information you 
provide over the cellphone, especially if you did not initiate the call. Finally, 
do not give any personal information if you are in a public place on a 
cellphone even if you initiated the call.

137
 Chapter 10: Becoming Familiar with Identity Thieves’ Scams and Methods
Phishing out a thief
“Back in the day,” as my kids would say, an identity thief would collect the 
needed information the old-fashioned way — dumpster diving, picking up 
discarded credit card receipts, rummaging for carbons of credit card 
receipts, stealing wallets and purses, and eavesdropping.
Today, everyone has the Internet. The Internet contains a wealth of 
information at your fingertips, and its ease of use makes it a great tool for 
an identity thief to find those essential numbers (SSN, birth date, personal 
identification number [PIN], and so on). Identity thieves even use the Internet 
to have potential targets come to them. For example, have you ever received 
a spam e-mail asking you to verify some personal information? This technique 
is phishing.
Here’s how phishing works: The e-mail, which claims to be from a reputable 
source, such as your bank or credit card company, requests that you click 
a link and go to its Web site to make sure that your information is correct. 
When on the site, you’re asked to provide personal information to verify the 
company’s records. Your name, credit card number, the card’s expiration 
date, SSN, date of birth (DOB), and so on is requested. This technique is 
called phishing because the person perpetrating the scam is throwing a line 
or net to see who bites. Don’t fall for it.
 
I received one of these e-mails shortly after using an online payment company. 
The e-mail said that my account would be deleted if I didn’t provide the 
information requested. I didn’t have an account with the company, and the 
timing of the suspect e-mail was actually coincidental and random. (The 
e-mail message started by saying, “Dear Customer, your account needs to 
be updated” — it wasn’t personalized.) I didn’t reply to the message; I just 
deleted it. However, enough people must answer the e-mail to make the scam 
successful; otherwise, identity thieves wouldn’t use it. Typically, the scam is 
used for a short period and then the thief shelves it until the media hype and 
warnings about it die down. Then they use it again with a slightly different 
message.
Here is a good Web site that provides information on e-mail scams: www.
scamdex.com. In the following sections, I detail some of the phishing scams 
you’re likely to encounter. Having some knowledge of these scams can help 
you avoid falling victim to them.

138
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
Nigerian phishing scam
The old Nigerian letter scam (named as such because the scam originated in 
Nigeria) is also being perpetrated online, with a different spin, but the scam 
is the same: An e-mail states that the sender has a large sum of money he 
wants to transfer out of whatever country he’s sending the e-mail from. What 
he wants you to do is help him move the money to your bank account, and 
he’ll pay 20 percent or more of the amount for your help. Of course, he sucks 
you in with the lure of millions of dollars. He asks for your bank account 
number and the bank routing number so he can transfer the money. After he 
gets the account number, he cleans out your bank account, and you end up 
with nothing.
Another similar scam is when you are selling something and advertise it on 
eBay or Craigslist. The buyer says that he will send a cashier’s check for 
more than the amount you have listed in your ad. You think that’s pretty 
good. After all, who wouldn’t want more than expected? What the scammer 
wants you to do is cash the cashier’s check, keep the amount for the item 
and shipping, plus a little extra, and then send the difference back to the 
buyer. The only problem is, the cashier’s check is no good, so when the bank 
finds out, you’re out all the money plus the item. 
 
Don’t fall for a scam like this even it sounds plausible; it isn’t. Don’t give 
anyone your account number. My advice is do not correspond with these 
thieves; just delete the e-mail. I get these e-mails once in awhile, and I just 
delete them. These e-mails are spam, and you are not being targeted directly 
because the e-mails are sent out to large numbers of people at one time.
I get several of these e-mails in my Hotmail account and very few on my 
other e-mail account. Most of the time, the sender gets my name wrong, and 
these e-mails go to my junk mail folder. Here’s an actual e-mail I received the 
other day. I have not edited the message; this is exactly how it looked when I 
received it:
Dear, Friend,
I am Mr. So-and-So, Managing Director, Barclays Bank Plc, London, United 
Kingdom. I am writing about an opportunity in my office that will be of 
immense benefit to us both.
On January 11, 2000, a German estate tycoon, the late Mr. Andreas 
Schranner, deposited £10,000,000 (British pounds sterling) under our 
portfolio management department for a period of two (2) years, and the 
deposit matured on February 18, 2002, with over 100-percent growth, 
which amounted to a total of £20,520,000 (British pounds sterling).

139
 Chapter 10: Becoming Familiar with Identity Thieves’ Scams and Methods
Upon maturity, a routine notification was sent to his forwarding address, 
all to no avail. We made several attempts to contact him but without 
responses. After a month, another reminder was sent to him from my 
desk, and evidently, I discovered from his contract employers that Mr. 
Schranner died in the Air France Concorde Flight 4590 plane crash on 
July 25, 2000. Upon further in-depth investigation, I discovered that he 
died with his wife and entire family, as all efforts to trace members of his 
neither family nor relatives proved futile. You can read more about the 
crash by visiting this site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/

Mr. Schranner has long passed away, and since his death, none of his 
next of kin or relations has come forward to claim this money as the heir. 
He died without informing anybody about these funds, which have since 
matured, and the rollover on the funds has also expired. This sum of 
£20,520,000 (British pounds sterling) is still in my possession in my 
bank — lifeless and unnoticed — because there no one will ever claim 
these funds. All materials, immaterial documents and certificates relating 
to the funds, are also in my possession.
Against this backdrop, I propose you to stand in as the next of kin to the 
late Mr. Andreas Schranner. The banking laws and guidelines stipulate 
that at the expiration of eight (8) years, such funds will be transferred 
into banking treasury as unclaimed funds. The money will be approved 
into your account and subsequently, we shall share in the ratio: 60 percent 
for our bank and 40 percent for you as gratification for assistance rendered. 
I will visit your country for the disbursement, according to the percentages 
indicated earlier after this money gets into your account.
Let me crave your indulgence in portraying sincerity toward this matter 
as trust stands to be our watchword in this transaction. Our assurance 
is that your role is risk-free to accord this transaction the legality it 
deserves. With all modalities in place, we are certain in actualizing a 
hitch-free funds transfer without any impediments. My position with this 
bank already guarantees the swift execution of this project. We’ll discuss 
much in details when I do receive your response. Kindly signify your 
willingness to assist by sending me a message for further procedures 
relating to this transaction.
The thief doesn’t ask for bank account information at first; after you 
correspond with him, he’ll ask for the info to make the transfer. This e-mail 
offered me a 40 percent cut for my assistance. Now you can see how thieves 
prey on people’s greed. The conversion of £20,520,000 (British pounds 
sterling) is equivalent to $33,406,438 (U.S. dollars). The amount he’d give 
you is $13,362,575. Sounds great doesn’t it? All you have to do is give him 
your bank account information or deposit a bogus check into your account. 
Tempting? Remember: Nobody gives you something for nothing.

Other phishing scams
Be alert to e-mails that are sent to you about job offers for jobs you didn’t 
apply for. Remember: If something sounds too good to be true, it is! Don’t 
be duped into taking one of the jobs even if you’re unemployed. Do your 
homework and check out any company at which you’re interested in 
applying for employment. Following are some common phishing scams:
 
✓ Work-from-home scam: These are the e-mails claiming that you can earn 
thousands working from home. All you have to do is send the thief some 
money to get the information so you can get started. Some work-from-
home programs are legitimate. Check out work-from-home companies 
with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or the FTC. Also, perform an 
online search for scams.
 
✓ Overseas check-cashing scam: The thief asks via e-mail whether you’ll 
cash overseas checks so that the funds will be in U.S. dollars. This is 
basically a scam to take your money. Here’s how it works: You’re the 
money manager or accountant for the company. The thief claims it’s 
easier to have all the funds in U.S. currency, so she asks you to give her 
your bank account so she can directly deposit a check in your account. 
But she has no checks, and guess what, she cleans out your bank 
account. If she sends you a check, it’s usually fraudulent and you’re 
stuck for the full check amount because it was deposited into your 
account. How can you tell whether the offer is a scam? Here are some 
things to watch for:
 
• Bank account numbers: Legitimate employers don’t ask for that 
information.
 
• SSN: All employers will eventually ask for a SSN, but be careful. 
Don’t be so eager to give your SSN, especially for an unsolicited job 
offer in your e-mail.
 
• Driver’s license: Although two forms of identification are needed 
when you start a new job, the employer doesn’t ask to scan your 
license before an employment offer is made. The reason for the 
identification is to verify citizenship.
 
• Spelling and grammatical errors.
 
• Red flags: For instance, Monster.com lists words that tip off fraud. 
These include package-forwarding, money transfers, wiring funds, 
eBay unless the ad is an eBay job posting, PayPal unless the ad is a 
PayPal job posting, and Foreign Agent Agreement.

 Chapter 10: Becoming Familiar with Identity Thieves’ Scams and Methods
 
✓ Reshipping merchandise scam: The thief offers for you to work as a 
shipping clerk (or whatever title she assigns to the job). Your job is to 
repackage and reship the merchandise to places overseas. The reason 
she gives for repackaging and reshipping is that it’s easier to ship the 
merchandise. The real reason for doing this repackaging and reshipping 
is that the items are purchased with stolen credit cards and when the 
items are repackaged and shipped, they’re hard to trace. However, the 
stolen property is shipped to your address and you’re the one that’ll be 
on the hook when law enforcement knocks on the door with a search 
warrant for stolen property. This scheme has been shown on NBC’s 
Dateline.
 
✓ FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) phishing scam: You 
receive an e-mail that appears to originate from a financial institution, 
a government agency, or another well-known/reputable entity. The 
message describes an urgent reason you must verify or resubmit 
personal or confidential information by clicking a link embedded in the 
message. The provided link appears to be the Web site of the reputable 
entity, but in phishing scams, the Web site belongs to the thief.
 
 When on the fraudulent Web site, you may be asked to provide your 
SSN, account numbers, passwords, or other information used to identify 
the consumer, such as your mother’s maiden or your birthplace. After 
you provide the information, the thief can access consumer accounts or 
assume your identity.
Recently e-mail phishing scams have claimed to come from other federal 
government agencies, such as the IRS and FBI. In the e-mail, the scammer 
asks for personal information under the guise that it’s official business and 
you must comply. The government agencies do not ask for your personal 
information in e-mails. These e-mails get you to give up your personal 
information by using the fear tactic that if you don’t comply, you’ll be in 
trouble with the agency and could be prosecuted for a crime. The e-mail 
phishing perpetrators use spam mail to reach as many e-mail accounts as 
possible in the hopes of hooking some unsuspecting persons. Become 
educated about e-mail phishing scams so you don’t fall prey to these thieves 
and lose your identity and hard-earned money.
Going online is an easy way to check out a company. You can just Google the 
company’s name or search for phishing to read up on scams at other sites. 
The BBB offers advice to job seekers as well as info on reshipping and 
package-forwarding job schemes.
 
Never give anyone personal information when it’s solicited in an e-mail unless 
you know the party that’s asking for the information. Be careful when 
completing an online survey, especially if it asks for personal information of 
any kind.

They’re from the government
The government doesn’t ask you for information in a public way, such as in 
an e-mail. If it needs to collect information — especially if you’re suspected to 
be in violation of something like the Patriot Act, as I describe in the sidebar 
“Homeland Security scam” — a subpoena or search warrant is needed.
Table 10-1 gives you an idea of some of the information the government has 
about you. Most of the information is collected as a matter of record keeping, 
such as birth certificates, property tax rolls, real estate owned, and so on.

Homeland Security scam
In a scam that surfaced recently, the Patriot 
Act and the FDIC are being used fraudulently 
to get your personal information. Here’s how 
the scam works: An e-mail is sent stating that 
the Secretary of the Department of Homeland 
Security has advised the FDIC to suspend 
all deposit insurance on your bank accounts 
because of suspected Patriot Act violations.
The e-mail goes on to say that all deposit 
insurance will be suspended until your personal 
identity, including bank account information, 
can be verified. The FDIC has distributed an 
alert stating that the e-mail is fraudulent and 
further warns that clicking the link in the e-mail 
may activate an Exploit-URLSpoof.gen virus.
The FDIC has set up an alert repository at 
alert@fdic.gov that you can use to report 
receipt of one of these e-mails.

143
 Chapter 10: Becoming Familiar with Identity Thieves’ Scams and Methods
You provide the information in Table 10-1 when you apply for a driver’s 
license, passport, or Social Security card, purchase property, record property, 
or commit criminal offenses for which you’ve been convicted — things along 
those lines.
Most of the documents in Table 10-1 are considered public records, and 
anyone can get access to them. Some documents, such as your birth 
certificate (in some states), SSN, tax information, and financial records, 
are not public. Even the government needs to obtain a subpoena or search 
warrant before it can examine your financial records.
Why financial information?
Your financial information is the key to your identity, and you need to protect 
it. Ask yourself this question: Why does that business need my SSN anyway? 
You need to be suspicious of anyone asking you for financial information.
If someone asks for your financial information in an e-mail, something 
isn’t right. Any financial institution you’ve done business with knows your 
financial information. If someone there wants to update your files, he won’t 
request the information to be updated via e-mail. If you’ve done business 
with that company in the past, you probably know its Web site address, and 
the institution would need to provide that link in an e-mail message.
To know whether the link to the Web site launches a real site, look for the 
VeriSign logo. The logo indicates that the site is authentic.
When you feel comfortable with a site and are going to perform a transaction 
of some kind, look for the lock at the bottom-right corner of your browser 
window before you complete a form or an application. Make sure that the 
lock is locked. This way, you know that anything you transmit is encrypted. If 
you don’t see the lock or there isn’t another indication that the information is 
going to be sent encrypted over the Internet, don’t provide the information.
Bank examiner scam
The phony bank examiner scam has been around for a long, long time. 
This scam must be effective because every now and then, you hear about 
someone being victimized by it.
Here’s how the scam works: Someone poses as a bank examiner or a bank 
officer. In a phone call, the thief tells the victim that she’s a bank officer 
where the victim has an account. Because of a computer glitch or some other 
problem, the bank must verify some information. The caller then asks the 
victim about his account balance, any recent activity, and so on. Next, the 

144
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
scammer tries to determine whether the victim lives alone and if the phony 
bank officer is successful in obtaining the needed information, the caller 
thanks the victim and tells him she’ll call back if any problems occur.
The scammer calls back after a brief period of time and asks the victim again 
for assistance in catching a dishonest teller the bank suspects of stealing 
from customers’ accounts, including the victim’s account. The victim is 
asked to withdraw a large sum of money from his account and turn it over to 
a bank examiner.
The scammer posing as a bank examiner tells the victim that a dummy 
account has been set up in his name for the transaction. Assurances are 
made that the account that’s been set up is fully insured, and the victim 
won’t lose any money to the dishonest teller. The victim then withdraws the 
agreed upon amount.
The scammer uses scare tactics to convince you to help. She tells you that 
your bank account is being drained, and if you don’t act soon, you’ll have no 
money left in the account — the crooks will have it all.
A meeting is then arranged between the victim and the phony bank examiner, 
and at the meeting, the victim is told by the phony bank examiner that the 
money actually came from the dummy account and not the victim’s account — 
and the money is needed as evidence. The phony bank examiner gives the 
victim a receipt for the money. The victim never sees the money or the phony 
bank examiner again.
In another variation of the scheme, the phony bank examiner asks that the 
victim withdraw the money and mark the bills. The money is given to the 
phony bank examiner, who says she’ll re-deposit the money to see whether 
the teller in question alters the deposit slip. The victim’s money and the 
phony bank examiner are never seen or heard from again.
A bank examiner or a law enforcement officer would never ask you to use 
your own money in any investigation. Besides, financial institutions never 
involve their customers in their investigations.
The old tried-and-true bank examiner scheme is still perpetrated today 
because it works, and fraudsters or con artists will use whatever works to 
separate you from your money. This scheme is usually perpetrated against 
elderly Americans; they’re most vulnerable because they’re easy to convince 
and often fall for the scheme because they want to help.
 
Most scams work because they play to the victim’s trusting nature. Know the 
telltale signs of a scam so you just hang up the phone when you hear it. If it 
sounds too good to be true, it’s probably a scam of some kind.

 Chapter 10: Becoming Familiar with Identity Thieves’ Scams and Methods
A Method to Their Madness: How 
Identity Thieves Suck You In
As I’ve said time and time again, identity thieves will stop at nothing to get 
your personal information. That means you have to be proactive to thwart 
their efforts and to protect yourself. In earlier sections of this chapter, I 
outline ways to be careful while doing business over the phone or the Web 
and also how to recognize popular scams used by identity thieves. In this 
section, I discuss the general tactics that scammers use. Scams are constantly 
changing, evolving, and becoming more sophisticated, but identity thieves 
tend to continue using the same methods over and over again. If you can 
recognize these methods, you can avoid the scam — even if it’s one you 
aren’t familiar with — and save yourself from becoming a victim.
Popular means of attack that identity thieves use include preying on your
 
✓ Emotions and dreams: This attack includes offering you free or easy 
money in the form of prizes, lottery winnings, and fake inheritances.
 
✓ Fear of being hurt: This attack comes with a threat to hurt you either 
financially (e-mails that are supposedly security alerts from your bank 
and so forth) or physically.
 
✓ Need to feel accepted: Some people feel that they do not fit in. When 
someone comes along and makes them feel like they are wanted, they 
fall prey to the scammer.
 
✓ Fear of authority: In this attack, the thief poses as the IRS, Homeland 
Security, and so on. See the “Homeland Security scam” sidebar and the 
“Other phishing scams” section, both earlier in this chapter, for more 
about this type of scam.
 
✓ Curiosity: Here you’re enticed with current events, gossip, or supposed 
pictures of yourself online.
 
✓ Dream of love: The old online dating scam.
 
✓ Dream of a good career or car: Thieves send you e-mails requesting 
your resumé or job applications for identity theft or a great deal on a car 
(an unbelievable deal when you’re buying/selling a car, usually involving 
a wire transfer).
In addition, this list highlights a few general red flags that need to raise your 
suspicion:
 
✓ Requests for personal information: The requests might ask for your 
birth date, mother’s maiden name, SSN, account information, driver’s 
license information, or information about habits/location (such as when 
are you going on vacation or when do you typically leave the house?).

146
Part IV: Arming Yourself against Potential Identity Theft 
 
✓ Sense of urgency or secrecy: Scams usually try to impress a sense 
of urgency so you don’t have time to check on them or have second 
thoughts. Others will threaten you if secrecy about the situation is 
broken. The more you’re being pressured to act instantly or give 
information instantly, the more you need to be suspicious.
 
✓ Too good to be true: If it seems to be too good to be true, it probably is.
Finally, be wary of the following:
 
✓ Transactions involving checks: Even when your bank makes a balance 
available to you, that doesn’t mean the check has cleared completely. 
Depositing a check, wiring money, or taking out cash can leave you high 
and dry when the check turns out to be no good.
 
✓ Transactions involving wire transfers or Western Union: This is one of 
the few ways you can send money and never see it again.
 
✓ Suspicious authority figures: Make sure that you are really looking at 
the authority figure you think you are. You may tend to see only the 
uniform and not the face. Look for badge numbers, official vehicles, and 
other signs of authority. Never be afraid to ask if you can call corporate 
or headquarters to verify. You may even ask to call 911 for backup, 
if you’re concerned that the “police officer” that pulled you over is a 
phony.
 
I leave you with this one last thought: As far as means-of-attack go, think about 
how many ways there are to contact you. There have been reports of scams 
by e-mail, text message, fax machine, snail mail, TTY, classifieds, online dating, 
online auctions, instant messages, social networking, fake UPS drivers, fake 
census workers, fake BBB representatives . . . .

hese days, most people use computers on a daily 
basis. So much of your personal information is on 
your computer and online. By following the guidelines I 
detail here, you can make it more difficult for identity 
thieves to get any sensitive information about you that’s 
on the Internet. I also show you how to get the most from 
your computer’s security features.

eing secure online is critical to protecting your identity. Think of all 
the information that’s available about you on the Internet. Years ago, 
finding out information about anyone took some effort. You had to search 
public records in person and through other sources. Today, all you need 
to do is to search the Internet. Just do a Google search on your name and 
see what comes up. This isn’t the only search engine; think of all the others 
search engines that are available. Think of the sites you visit, especially 
social networking sites. How much information do you post about yourself, 
family, and friends? Even if you keep it private, do your friends keep it private? 
Social networking sites can be dangerous to your personal information.
In this chapter, I first give you a few tips on shopping safely online. Then I 
discuss in some detail how you can be more secure on the Internet by 
keeping your antivirus protection up-to-date, by putting security safeguards 
(such as encryption and spyware blockers) in place, and by devising a 
security plan.
Ordering Stuff Online
Purchasing merchandise online is incredibly easy, but you must protect 
yourself. Here are several tips for safely ordering stuff online by using an 
online pay service from the HowStuffWorks Web site, http://money.
howstuffworks.com/identity-theft.htm:

150
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
✓ Use a smart card. When you use a smart card, the amount of the purchase 
is subtracted from the balance on the card, just like when you use a 
debit or credit card. A smart card is the same size and shape of a credit 
card but has an imbedded microprocessor inside the card. This makes 
the data on the card harder to change or read than magnetic strips do 
on other cards. On the smart card, the data is imbedded into the card so 
the card carries the intelligence. Without the reader, the card cannot be 
read, thus providing tamper proof protection of data on the card.
 
✓ Use a one-time use credit card number for online purchases. This 
comes from your bank, has a different number than your actual account 
number, and is good for the single transaction. This prevents you from 
exposing your credit card number online or through malware you may 
not be aware exists on your computer.
 
✓ Use a stored value card. This is like a prepaid phone card — you 
purchase the card with a certain dollar amount, and each time you use 
it, the purchase amount is subtracted from the balance.
 
✓ Use e-wallet software. This software is secure and allows you to 
purchase items by letting the merchant’s server send a message to 
your PC. Then you select the card that’s defined in your “wallet” to 
make the purchase.
 
✓ Use digital cash. This is a series of credits you purchase that are stored 
on your PC. You spend these credits by making purchases over the 
Internet.
 
✓ Use an online payment service. Through this service, you can set up an 
account and make purchases drawing from that account.
The most common method for purchasing items online is to use a credit 
card. The following tips from the HowStuffWorks site helps you make 
purchasing merchandise on the Internet more secure:
 
✓ Use the latest Internet browser. The browser allows you to navigate the 
Internet and provides encryption. Encryption scrambles data sent to 
a server to protect it. When you use the most recent browser version, 
you’re also using the latest encryption version.
 
✓ Only use one credit card to make purchases on the Internet. This way, 
you can track your purchases and activity on the card more easily. This 
is a good way to keep a record of all your Internet transactions to help 
ensure accuracy of your card’s charges. If the card is compromised, you 
can cancel it and get a new one. These days, online sites request the 
security code to complete the transaction, just as it is for phone orders. 
Merchants ask for the security code to help protect them from fraudulent 
charges, and the code also helps protect you because the identity thief 
has to get the code to complete the transaction.

151
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
 
✓ Look for digital certificates and the VeriSign logo, which authenticate 
the Web site you’re accessing. When you click the VeriSign logo, you 
can be assured that the site is legitimate and not a redirect or a clone.
 
✓ Check your e-mail for confirmation from the merchant after you 
complete a purchase. Merchants usually send you an e-mail to confirm 
the order and to tell you when the item will be shipped.
 
✓ Read the Web site’s privacy policy. This should let you know that 
personal information you provide will be kept confidential and not sold 
or disclosed to others.
 
✓ Don’t give your password or ID online unless you know who you’re 
dealing with, even if your Internet service provider (ISP) asks for it 
via e-mail. This request is a scam and is used by identity thieves to 
collect personal information.
Understanding Common Online Threats
You can assess what online threats might plague you by determining what 
you’re going to do with your computer:
 
✓ Are you going to search the Web? Numerous viruses and other 
malware on the Internet cause major security issues for you and your 
private information.
 
✓ Are you going to gaming sites? If you’re going to gaming Web sites, 
your computer’s security features need to be the strongest possible 
because these sites are known to have viruses and other malware built 
into them.
 
✓ Are you going to download music? Downloading music from Web sites 
is also a security risk, and you need stronger security to ensure that you 
don’t infect your computer.
Eighty percent of legitimate Web sites have malware on them as noted in the 
report at 
www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1707131/
legitimate_Websites_suffer_losses_due_to_malware/
So, any Web site is potentially dangerous. Currently the most dangerous Web 
sites are social networking sites and those that use peer-to-peer downloading 
applications. Even searches using search engines can be dangerous because 
hackers use current trends to infect search results.

152
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
A red flag that your system is infected is that your computer is running 
slower than usual. If you aren’t sure that your system is infected, take it to a 
professional to check it (that is, if you don’t feel comfortable checking the 
system).
Common online threats include keylogger software, spyware/adware, Trojan 
horses, e-mail from unknown sources, and cookies. I describe each in turn in 
the following sections.
Keylogger software
The keylogger is a program that logs every keystroke you make on your 
keyboard when typing, which the thief can then see. The main job of the 
keystroke logger is to capture your user IDs and passwords. When the thief 
gets your bank user ID and password, he can log on to your bank account. 
Some banks have added another layer of protection that doesn’t let you 
log in if you’re working on a different computer than the one you originally 
signed up with for online banking.
Keylogger software is generally imbedded in other software and delivered to 
your computer system with spyware.
Spyware/adware
Spyware is a program that collects information about you without your 
knowledge. Most spyware isn’t dangerous, but some contain viruses and 
other malware. Some spyware has a greater risk than other spyware 
programs.
Adware serves advertisements to your computer that you didn’t consent to 
having displayed. Most adware is spyware. Adware and spyware are similar 
to viruses because they can be considered to be malicious in nature.
Trojan horses
The Trojan horse is loaded onto your computer, again without your knowledge, 
when you open or download a seemingly innocent program. The keylogger, 
for instance, is imbedded with a Trojan horse.

153
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
Trojan horses are used to plant other malware programs on your computer. 
Some uses are
 
✓ To hijack your computer and set it up as a zombie for delivering a 
denial-of-service attack (DOS): The DOS prevents access to Internet 
servers because a large number of requests are sent to it at once during 
the attack.
 
✓ To hijack your Internet session: This brings you to the hijacker’s bogus 
site, such as a banking site, to capture your personal information.
E-mails from unknown sources
E-mail attachments are used to carry viruses; when you open the attachment, 
the virus is then released on your computer. In some cases, after you open 
the e-mail carrying the virus, the virus is then sent to everyone listed in your 
Address Book. E-mail attachments also carry Trojan horses that are activated 
when you open the attachment.
 
Don’t open e-mail attachments from unknown senders, especially in messages 
that go to your junk mail account. These messages can often come from 
unfriendly sources — the type that would send you a virus in an e-mail.
 
Set up a filter in your e-mail account so unsolicited e-mails go to the junk mail 
folder and not your inbox. Most e-mail providers, such as Yahoo! and Hotmail, 
automatically set up mail filters to help you weed out junk mail. This is why 
some e-mails from people you know end up in the junk mail file until you add 
them to your Address Book.
Although your antivirus software will scan e-mail attachments for viruses 
(and some e-mail providers, such as Yahoo! and Hotmail, provide this service 
with the e-mail subscription), you still need to apply a little common sense 
when opening e-mail attachments. Before opening an e-mail with an attachment 
(denoted by the paperclip icon next to the sender’s name), ask these questions:
 
✓ Were you expecting the e-mail from someone you know? If you answer 
yes, it’s probably safe to open the message.
 
 However, before you do, determine whether the attachment is important 
to you. The e-mail could be a chain e-mail that’s being passed around 
from e-mail account to e-mail account, in which case, you don’t want 
to open it. I usually don’t open these attachments (even from someone 
I know) because I’m leery that an attachment that’s been passed from 
person to person might have originated from an unsavory source.
 
✓ Is this person in your main e-mail address book, and have you received 
previous e-mails from her? If yes, you can likely safely open this message.

154
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
✓ Does the description of the e-mail in the subject line make sense to 
you? If not, proceed with caution. Your best course of action might be to 
delete the message without opening it.
 
✓ Do you recognize the person’s e-mail address (even if you haven’t 
received mail from her before)? If not, don’t open the attachment, and 
better yet, don’t open the e-mail.
Cookies
A cookie is a sample piece of text from a Web site you visited that your 
browser stores on your computer. These cookies make it easier for the Web 
browser to open that Web page the next time you visit it. Cookies track 
where you go on the Internet (for marketing purposes). If you’re like me, 
you don’t want to have your Web surfing habits watched by anyone for any 
reason — good or bad. Because cookies are a piece of text, they aren’t 
executable (a file that opens a program or does something else), which is 
good news. Here are the two types of cookies:
 
✓ Temporary: Temporary cookies, or session cookies, are deleted as soon 
as you end the session (that is, leave that particular site). Temporary 
cookies are a way to speed up going to a particular site if you have been 
there before and they are usually not malicious in nature.
 
✓ Permanent: Permanent cookies are more persistent, are stored on your 
computer’s hard drive, and can be dangerous to your computer because 
they can be Trojan horses or other malicious programs. Permanent 
cookies can also harbor viruses.
 
 Permanent cookies were made to keep information you may have 
entered on a site so that when you return to that site, you can retrieve 
the information. For instance, when you complete an online job 
application and return to that site, the cookie allows you to retrieve the 
information you previously typed; without the cookie, you have to start 
a new session, and the information isn’t available.
Most cookies are harmless, but they’re still something to keep an eye on. (At 
the very least, too many cookies on your hard drive can make your computer 
sluggish.) Most antivirus protection programs find cookies and then you can 
delete them from your system. If the cookie is from a site you visit often and 
the security threat level identified by the antivirus program is really low, you 
may want to keep the cookie. The decision is up to you, but at least you know 
that the cookie is on your hard drive.

Implementing Security through 
Windows Security Center
In the last section of this chapter, I show you how to devise a security plan. 
You’ll have a good start toward outlining one after you identify your computer 
system’s safeguards — and implement others — which I discuss in this and 
the following section. Computers purchased today come with a one-year 
subscription to antivirus software and your Internet service provider (ISP) 
comes with a firewall. Microsoft has a Security Shield program installed in 
Windows XP and Vista. To access Security Shield, click the Start button, and 
then choose Control Panel➪Security Shield. 
To find out what protection systems you’re currently running on your 
computer, take a look at your computer’s Security Center. On Windows 7, 
click the Start button and then choose Control Panel➪System and Security➪
Action Center. On Windows Vista, click the Start button and then choose 
Control Panel➪Windows Security Center.
The Action Center/Security Center shows whether your antivirus protection and 
firewall are running and whether Automatic Updates is on. These updates are 
from Microsoft and are important to patch any security holes that may be 
present in the Windows operating system. Automatic Updates ensures that 
your system is up-to-date and all the latest patches are installed. If you 
don’t use Automatic Updates, you need to check for updates. This can be 
an arduous task because you don’t know when updates are available for 
downloading. To find the latest updates, go to Microsoft’s Web site and check 
for updates under the Windows version you’re running. See Chapter 12 for 
more about Windows security.
If antivirus protection, Automatic Updates, and the firewall are on, you have 
some safeguards in place. Like any product or system, some are better than 
others; later in this chapter, I look at some of the products on the market 
for antivirus protection and firewalls. Some of the firewall products are free, 
and you can bundle some with your antivirus protection. Keep in mind, free 
antivirus protection systems aren’t as good as the subscription services you 
can purchase. Other protective programs you can install on your computer 
include spyware blockers and a proxy server. I discuss these and others later 
in this chapter.

156
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
Be careful what software you download from the Internet. Some software 
programs (EXE) are safe to run (or connect); other programs could be 
dangerous to run. If your antivirus protection is up-to-date, when you attempt 
to download software that’s infected with viruses, your antivirus protection 
lets you know. Your firewall alerts you if an EXE (executable) the firewall rule 
set doesn’t recognize is trying to run; the firewall will ask whether you want to 
run the EXE. Be wary of any EXE you don’t recognize as something your 
system runs on a regular basis. An example of an EXE that runs daily is the 
Microsoft updates. The EXE goes to the update Web site for the particular 
software to search for and gets updates.
 
If you’re using a wireless laptop computer, make sure that you’ve installed 
virus and firewall protection as you would on any computer. However, here 
are several points you need to consider to secure your wireless connection.
 
✓ Change the default administrator’s password. You do this by clicking 
the Start button, and then choosing Control Panel➪User Accounts. 
In the User Accounts dialog box, click Change an Account, and a new 
screen appears. Under Pick an Account to Change, you see two choices: 
Computer Administrative or Guest.
 
✓ Turn on WPA/WEP encryption. WPA stands for Wi-Fi Protected Access, 
and WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy. Encryption scrambles the 
transmission so it can’t be read.
 
✓ Don’t auto-connect to open Wi-Fi networks in your neighborhood. 
Doing so can expose your network or computer to security breaches.
By developing and following a security plan, you can help keep your 
information online safe. The security plan is simple, and I discuss devising 
one in the section “Devising a Security Plan” later in this chapter.
Identifying and Implementing 
Other Security Safeguards
To secure your electronic information, you must know your risks (as I 
describe earlier, in the “Understanding Common Online Threats” section), 
but you must also take certain precautions, such as these (this list isn’t all 
inclusive):
 
✓ Installing and regularly updating antivirus protection on your 
computer: You can set up the antivirus software to automatically check 
for and install updates. What could be easier than that?

157
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
 
✓ Installing and regularly updating a firewall: Your ISP provides limited 
firewall protection, but I strongly recommend that you get another 
firewall. You can download free firewalls, which I discuss further in the 
following section.
 
✓ Performing regular backups of important files and folders: This 
precaution won’t keep your system safe, but making backups now can 
save you time and effort later, in case your computer becomes infected. 
You don’t want to lose important information because you didn’t make a 
backup.
 
✓ Using strong passwords to protect your data: Don’t make it easy on 
thieves. The harder it is for a thief to guess your password, the less 
likely the thief can get to your information.
I discuss these and other safeguards throughout the following sections.
Firewall and antivirus software
 
You can determine whether the firewall and antivirus protection programs are 
running by going to the Windows Action Center/Security Center (for details, 
see the section “Implementing Security through Windows Action Center” 
earlier in this chapter), or you can look at the lower-right corner of your 
screen (to the left of the clock); this area is known as the notification area. 
The icon for the antivirus and firewall programs appears in this area if they’re 
running. Right-click an icon to see a menu (which might vary, depending on 
the company), offering you choices, such as
 
✓ Home (or Open): This option takes you to the main software screen. 
From the main screen, you can navigate through various pages to 
change settings, to view and set the Automatic Updates schedule, and 
so on.
 
 For antivirus protection software, you also see a manual-sweep screen 
so you can sweep your computer for viruses. You can also schedule 
automatic virus sweeps of your computer in the wee hours of the 
morning when you aren’t using your computer.
 
 Running the sweep while you’re using the computer slows down your 
system, but you can still work if you choose to have the scans done 
while you’re awake. To get to the firewall’s main screen, right-click the 
icon at the bottom right in the notification area. The firewall program 
works the same way.
 
✓ Options: Provides information of what the options are in the program 
and what features are available.

158
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
✓ Shut Down: This link shuts down the program entirely, leaving you with 
no protection.
 
✓ Schedule: Use this option to schedule automatic scans of your computer.
 
✓ Check for Updates: To make sure that you have the latest version of 
your virus and firewall programs, see whether the program is set to get 
updates automatically. Doing this varies, depending on the program you 
use. To schedule automatic updates, use the following very general steps 
(the steps for your particular software might vary):
 
1. Click the icon for the program, firewall, or antivirus protection and 
then go to the main menu.
 
2. Click the options or updates.
 
 For my firewall program, I go to the Miscellaneous folder to check 
for updates.
 
3. After you arrive at updates or check for updates, whichever 
language is used, click the link to see whether there are updates 
available.
 
 As I state previously, most of the antivirus programs have an 
Automatic Updates option. The firewall programs, on the other 
hand, may not have an automatic update feature. The firewall 
program lets you know whether updates are available and whether 
you need to manually get them.
 
4. Download the updates to your computer and then restart it for the 
updates to take effect.
 
 For antivirus protection, you don’t need to restart your computer 
for most of the updates.
 
✓ Help: Click to find information about how to do something in the 
program.
Buying a firewall program
Having a firewall from your ISP is a good start. But you may want to purchase a 
firewall from a company that provides your antivirus protection. Or perform 
an online search for firewall and download some free ones. I use Comodo, a 
free firewall program; it works well and is easy to install. All you have to do is 
download the program and keep the default settings. With Comodo firewall, 
I haven’t had any issues, but prior to using it, I had issues with my computer 
and had to clean it up even while running an updated antivirus program.
To download the Comodo firewall:
 
1. Go to www.comodo.com and then click the Internet Security link 
under the Popular Downloads on the left side of Comodo’s home page.
 
 Don’t confuse this link with the Internet Security menu on the right side 
of the page.

159
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
 
 You’re taken to the Comodo Internet Security-Free Version page.
 
2. Click the Free Download button and follow the onscreen directions to 
complete the download.
Below the Free Download button are tabs that explain more about the 
product. These tabs include
 
✓ Overview: Provides an outline of what the program will do.
 
✓ Features: Describes the program’s features.
 
✓ Frequent Questions: The typical questions asked by users (with 
answers), such as
 
• Can you install only the firewall or only the antivirus protection?
 
 The answer is yes; you can install only the components you want.
 
• What’s the difference between the Free version and the Pro version?
 
 The only difference is that the Pro version also provides 
TrustConnect total Wi-Fi protection and LivePCSupport. 
TrustConnect protects your connection to a wireless network. 
LivePCSupport is the technical services provided by the company. 
You can call them for technical questions about the product. If 
you have a wireless system, get the Pro version to ensure that you 
have a secure connection to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection.
 
✓ Support: Provides answers to your technical questions about the 
product. 
 
✓ Video: A training video you can watch online to explain how the 
program works.
Putting protective programs in the Startup menu
After you determine that you have antivirus and firewall programs to help 
keep you safe online, make sure that the firewall and antivirus protection is 
in the Startup menu on the desktop. This is important because you want to 
these programs running in the background when you start your computer. If 
the software was installed when you purchased the computer, the software 
is in the Startup menu, which means that when you start your computer, the 
firewall and antivirus protections boot up as well.
Understanding rule sets
When you purchase or download a firewall program, you may want to use 
the default settings for the rule sets, which basically tell the firewall what to 
block. Anything that isn’t in the rule set isn’t blocked. A rule set details what 
you want blocked from connecting to your computer. The rule sets block 
packets (data being sent) and Web site addresses. The default rule sets 
provide adequate protection for you to surf the Internet. 

160
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
As you surf the ’Net or if your antivirus software is updating, you get a 
firewall notification. The notification tells what program, or the site address, 
that is trying to connect to the Internet, and it asks whether you accept or 
block the connection. The alerts can come when you surf the ’Net or one of 
your programs attempts to update by connecting to the ’Net. 
If you recognize the program that’s trying to connect, accept it; if not, you 
can block it or go to the firewall’s main page to get more information. You 
can manually block Web sites, but I recommend that you use the default 
settings unless you’re computer-savvy. Otherwise, you could block your 
Internet connection and other applications that you need to run.
You can block network zones and applications, define accepted applications, 
view firewall events, and so on.
Spyware blocker
As I discuss earlier in this chapter, spyware is a program that secretly collects 
information about you. Generally, spyware isn’t dangerous, although some 
spyware contains viruses and other malware. Your antivirus program 
identifies spyware that’s on your computer, tells you the threat level that 
the spyware poses, and gives you the chance to delete the spyware (and any 
other issues). To delete the spyware, select the check box next to it and then 
click either the Delete button or the Quarantine button. 
Quarantining renders the spyware harmless. To delete the quarantined spyware 
permanently, go to the quarantined spyware, click Select All, and then click 
the Delete button. To read the quarantine log, click the Quarantined Spyware 
button. I recommend deleting any spyware your antivirus program finds.
You can download adware blocker programs for free. These programs scan 
your system for adware programs and then you can delete them from your 
computer. You can have them scan automatically or you can do so manually.
Proxy server
A proxy server sits between you and the Internet and intercepts all requests 
to the real server (that is, your computer) to see whether it can take care 
of the request; if it can’t, it passes the request on to the real server. Think 
of a proxy server as someone doing your bidding. For example, if you own 
any shares of stocks, before the annual stockholders’ meeting, you receive a 
proxy vote request because you have only a fraction of shares and, therefore, 
don’t attend the meeting. After you send the proxy form back with how you 
want the stockholders to vote, someone places your vote on the issue that 
goes before the stockholders.

161
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
Proxy servers do two things:
 
✓ Improve performance by saving requests for a certain amount of time.
 
✓ Filter requests by preventing access to certain Web sites.
Many companies use proxy servers to restrict access to certain Web sites. 
Some of these sites contain adult material that’s inappropriate for the work 
environment, and others, such as music or gaming, are restricted to prevent 
viruses and Trojan horses from entering the network and infecting the servers.
TrustConnect is a secure Internet proxy service that encrypts all the data you 
send over wireless connections, which prevents hackers from accessing your 
private information.
Pop-up blocker
A pop-up blocker does just that — it prevents pop-up ads and other pop-up 
banners from constantly appearing onscreen while you’re on the Internet. 
Most Web browsers come with a pop-up blocker. You can toggle the blocker 
on/off by choosing Tools➪Pop-Up Blocker (Internet Explorer) or by choosing 
Tools➪Options➪Content (Firefox). Internet Explorer comes with its pop-up 
blocker already on. Both browsers enable you to set exceptions, and 
Explorer enables you to choose among High, Medium, and Low settings.
Backups
Back up important files and folders at least monthly. Some companies provide 
that service, and even encryption software companies provide backup storage 
space. Some antivirus protection programs offer backup space as well. This is 
mainly to back up your operating system configuration, not your files and fold-
ers. A lot of your personal information might be contained within important 
files. Losing the information on your hard drive is a real pain if your computer 
crashes or your laptop is stolen. Sometimes the data can be retrieved; other 
times, it’s lost forever. So it pays to back up your data.
Encryption
When storing personal information on your computer in files and folders, 
encrypt the files and folders just in case someone gets control of your 
computer. The encrypted files and folders will be useless to him. You may 
be asking: How does encryption work? Simply put, encryption scrambles the 
text so that it can’t be read without decrypting it — and you need a key (or 
password) to do that.

162
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
You can purchase from among several versions of encryption software 
online. One is such version is Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). To find out more 
this version:
 
1. Go to www.pgp.com.
 
 The PGP home page displays.
 
2. Click the Products tab and then click PGP Desktop Home.
The cost of the software is a one-time license $99 fee, which includes one 
year of free technical support. With the Desktop Home version, you can 
encrypt e-mails, files, folders, or the entire hard drive. Your key is the most 
important thing to remember when using encryption software; otherwise, 
you can’t retrieve your documents.
I’ve used PGP encryption products for e-mail attachment encryption and find 
them user friendly and effective. The software automatically encrypts e-mails 
and can also be signed digitally for validating the integrity of the e-mail. PGP 
Virtual Disk provides backup for files and folders. The data is encrypted and 
decrypted automatically; you don’t need to do anything. This is a far cry from 
the early days of encryption when the steps to encrypt were done manually and 
were confusing to implement. Now with the automatic encryption systems, you 
can easily use encryption to protect your e-mail attachments, files, and folders.
Passwords
Think about the number of passwords you use to access bank accounts, 
credit card accounts, mortgage accounts, and so on. Do you use strong 
passwords? Using strong passwords helps prevent thieves from guessing 
your passwords by using password-cracker software. The tougher the 
password, the harder it is to crack.
The Enigma machine
Encryption has been around a long, long 
time, and you often hear it stated as a coded 
message. Various types of machines 
encode messages, and one that comes to mind 
was used by the Germans during WWII — the 
Enigma machine. The Enigma machine has 
three rotors with numbers to represent the 26 
letters of the alphabet; the message is typed 
and when the machine receives it, the three 
rotors need to be in a certain configuration to 
decrypt the message. The machine takes the 
number on the rotor representing the letter of 
the alphabet and steps up with the other two 
rotors to scramble the message. The person 
typing the message can see the letters instead 
of the corresponding numbers on the front of 
the machine. This way the writer knows that the 
secret message was typed correctly.

163
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
You’d be surprised how many people use password or passwd as their login 
password. You can probably guess that these aren’t strong passwords. These 
passwords are usually default passwords and need to be changed immediately. 
People use them because they’re easy to remember. The following are the 
ten most commonly used passwords:
password 
love
lust 
money
private 
secret
sex 
snoopy
god 
qwerty
Do not use any of these passwords. Most of the password-cracker programs 
have these passwords in them. I also recommend against using passwords 
that contain your personal information, such as
 
✓ Your initials
 
✓ Your birth date
 
✓ Your zip code
 
✓ Your pet’s name(s)
 
✓ Relatives’ names
 
✓ Mother’s maiden name
 
✓ Relatives’ birth dates
The only thing protecting you from a potential thief is the strength of your 
password, so the stronger you make it, the better protected your personal 
information will be.
 
Don’t have your browser save all your online passwords. When signing in to 
an account, whether at your bank’s site or your favorite online retailer, you 
might see a Remember Me option (or Save My Password or Keep Me Logged 
in for 2 Weeks), which can make your information more vulnerable if your 
system gets compromised. I recommend that you always choose to not have 
your passwords remembered.
Understanding authentication and password attacks
Authentication happens when you provide what is necessary to prove you 
are the legitimate end user. This is done through the use of passwords, PINs, 
fingerprints, and so on. Here are the three types of authentication:
 
✓ Something you know (password)
 
✓ Something you have (a token or a card)
 
✓ Something you are (fingerprint or hand geometry)

164
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Passwords are the weakest of all the authentication methods because people 
tend to use passwords they can remember and which others can easily 
guess. The following list describes a few types of password attacks:
 
✓ Brute force attacks: These passwords are cracked by the thief simply 
guessing. This is why you only get only three or four attempts to type a 
password before you’re locked out of an account.
 
✓ Dictionary attacks: These password-cracker programs run every word 
in the dictionary. When someone uses this attack to run passwords, all 
dictionary words are flagged. So it’s better to not use dictionary words, 
such as password, open, and so on.
 
✓ Password-cracking software programs: These have some legitimate 
uses and are available for IT (Information Technology) managers to 
unlock an account. As you can guess, these are used in an attempt to 
obtain passwords for financial information and to obtain administrative 
passwords for a computer system. If the administrative passwords are 
compromised, the system is also compromised.
Creating strong passwords
Most of the passwords you use are work related, and the systems you have 
access to have password complexity — certain requirements about the 
Beware the social engineer
Social engineering is another way thieves 
can get your password. A social engineer 
possesses social skills and asks questions 
to get information she needs to access your 
systems or accounts. Here’s how this works: 
She e-mails you saying she’s from IT and needs 
your password to fix something in your account. 
Or she can call you and say she’s from IT and 
needs you to type your password, and oh, by 
the way, she needs you to tell her what you’re 
typing so she can check something. Don’t fall 
for such schemes. She’s very convincing, but 
guess what, IT never asks for your password; 
IT can get into your account with administrative 
passwords. Never, ever give anyone your 
password even if the reason sounds legitimate 
because IT won’t ask for it.
Another social engineer trick is to ask you about 
your pets’ names, hobbies, and so on because 
the thief knows that people use them to form 
passwords; the thief figures it’s worth a try. 
Social engineers prowl social networking sites 
looking for victims. He’ll attempt to befriend 
you, and after he has, he then starts asking 
questions that seem innocent. Don’t be fooled; 
he really isn’t your new friend but is instead 
after your personal information. At home, at 
work, or on the road, don’t answer e-mails 
asking for bank account information so the 
sender can check something, can change your 
password, or so on. Banks won’t ever ask for 
account or password information in an e-mail.

165
 Chapter 11: Staying Safe from Online Threats
passwords you choose. To meet password complexity requirements, you 
need to use a combination of the following:
 
✓ Non-alphabetic characters, such as !, #, %, &, and $
 
✓ Numbers
 
✓ Upper- and lowercase letters
Choosing good passwords can make all the difference in securing your 
personal information. The more effort you put into password selection, the 
better off you’ll be when it comes to protecting your assets. Here are some 
guidelines for choosing a good (strong) password:
 
✓ Use at least six characters.
 
✓ Insert some punctuation.
 
✓ Insert non-alphabetic characters.
 
✓ Mix lower- and uppercase letters.
 
✓ Make up a phrase or a combination of words that are easy to remember.
 
✓ Don’t repeat characters, letters, and so on, such as ooooo.
 
✓ Don’t use sequential numbers, such as 123456.
 
✓ Don’t use your account name as your password.
 
✓ Don’t use all numbers, all punctuation, or all letters.
A password doesn’t need to be an actual word; it can be a made-up word or 
even a passphrase, such as
 
✓ iSItTgIfa?: Is it thank goodness it’s Friday again?
 
✓ ShMEt$!: Show me the money!
 
✓ iAmLfD!: I am late for an important date!
Here are some password examples:
 
✓ KaTZFi$h%7m#: This word means nothing, but the trick is to remember 
it. Catfish is spelled using the $ for s. K is used rather than c, and z is 
added to Kat. Three non-alphabetic characters are used, #, %, and $.
 
✓ 3$oiGsNp: The password means nothing, but it includes lower- and 
uppercase letters as well as the number and dollar characters.
 
✓ 8301LdP: The password means nothing, but numbers as well as upper- 
and lowercase letters are used.
 
I provide these password and passphrase examples only to show you what 
you could come up with. Do not use any of these examples.

166
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
No password or passphrase is immune from being cracked, but you owe it to 
yourself to come up with strong passwords and passphrases. Choose your 
passwords carefully and change them periodically. How often you change 
them is up to you, but don’t wait too long.
Devising a Security Plan
This section looks at what makes up a security plan. I cover some basics 
earlier in this chapter, such as an updated antivirus protection program and 
an updated firewall (other than the one provided by your ISP).
With the basics and the other safeguards I list in earlier sections, you can 
develop a checklist for your security plan. Checklists are a good way to 
ensure you aren’t missing any important safeguard. Your checklist will look 
similar to Table 11-1. You can use this or make up your own. The simpler the 
checklist, the more likely you’ll use it to help secure your computer.

A word about social networking security
Social networking sites are an issue. Most 
people don’t think they are, but do you have 
personal information on your networking Web 
page? You probably do, but you’re probably 
thinking, “I don’t have the information visible 
to the general public.” But what about your 
contacts, friends, and so on? Do they take the 
same precautions to protect your information 
that they have access to? They may not 
intentionally display personal information about 
you, but it could happen. 
Before computers and social networking sites, 
people networked on the phone or in person. 
Most people didn’t share much personal 
information other than birth dates, home 
addresses, and phone numbers — and this 
occurred only if you were friends. If you were 
close friends, you might share information 
about where you work. Today, an explosion of 
information is on the Internet. Take precautions 
when using social networking sites; be wary of 
anyone who wants to be your friend and starts 
asking too many personal questions. Social 
networking sites are a gold mine to identity 
thieves and other predators, so be careful 
when using them. Make sure that you follow the 
safeguards recommended by the social 
networking site’s guidelines. And be stingy 
about divulging personal information to people 
who want to add you as a friend.

Windows XP, Vista, and 7
In This Chapter
▶ Wielding Windows Security Center tools
▶ Employing Windows Defender
▶ Managing user accounts in Vista and XP
▶ Managing Windows 7 security
I
n this chapter, I discuss what features are available for Windows security. 
Windows XP and Windows Vista have a Security Center feature, which is 
where you can find out what security your computer is running and turn on 
automatic updates. In Windows 7, this feature is called the Action Center.
Wielding Windows Security Center Tools
Windows Security Center for XP and Vista helps make sure that your 
computer is safe while on the Internet. The Security Center offers only basic 
features, but at least you know what firewall and antivirus protection you’re 
using and that the tools are on. Your commercially available firewall and 
antivirus protections have their own update systems, which I talk about in 
Chapter 11.
I recommend you set your virus protection programs to update automatically. 
My virus protection updates frequently without interfering with my using the 
system. Firewall programs, on the other hand, do not get as many updates 
as the virus protection systems, so most do not have an automatic update 
feature. However, the firewall program will still let you know when updates 
are available, or you can manually check.
In this section, I show you how to access the Security Center and what 
settings you can manage from there.

Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Accessing the Security Center
To go to the Windows Security Center for XP and Vista and discover what 
protection is on, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
 The Control Panel appears, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
Figure 12-1: 
You can 
access the 
Security 
Center 
through 
the Control 
Panel.
 
 
2. Double-click the Security Center icon.
 
 The screen shown in Figure 12-2 appears, listing three security features:
 
• Firewall: Protects your computer by blocking unwanted programs 
from accessing your computer.
 
• Automatic Updates: This feature automatically scans for updates.
 
• Virus Protection: Helps protect your computer from unwanted 
programs that cause problems with your computer. 
 
 If On appears to a feature’s right, it’s on (sounds obvious, right?).
 
3. Click the On down arrow to find more information about the Virus 
Protection feature.
 
 Figure 12-2 shows the virus protection information, including that the 
virus protection is on and what software is in use.

171
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
 Virus protection is important to protect your computer. Information 
Technology (IT) doesn’t tell you whether your virus protection is 
up-to-date. Ensure that it’s up-to-date by setting your virus protection to 
update automatically.
 
Figure 12-2: 
Checking 
up on your 
computer’s

4. Click the down arrow next to Firewall and Automatic Updates to see 
more information about these features.
 
 As shown in Figure 12-3, this computer has at least one firewall installed 
that is currently on. Unfortunately, the feature doesn’t tell you whether 
your firewall is up-to-date.
 
 Below the information is a note about how running more than one 
firewall can potentially cause problems. Two firewalls running 
simultaneously can conflict with each other and cause your Internet 
connection to fail.
 
 Figure 12-4 shows the information available for the Automatic Updates 
feature. Turn on Automatic Updates and keep your computer safe by 
automatically installing patches (fixes for known vulnerabilities to an 
OS). Microsoft sends out patches when they become available. When the 
operating system isn’t patched and up-to-date, vulnerabilities can cause 
security breaches.

Managing security settings
The main Security Center screen has a Manage Security Settings For section 
(see the bottom of Figure 12-2), which lists the following items: Internet 
Options, Windows Firewall, and Automatic Updates. I discuss each of these in 
the following sections.
Internet Options
When you click the Internet Options link, the Internet Properties dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 12-5.
 
Figure 12-5: 
The Internet 
Properties 
dialog box.
 
The Security tab is the default tab that appears. In the Select a Zone to View 
or Change Settings section are four icons: Internet (highlighted; this zone is 
for Internet Web sites except those in the Trusted or Restricted zones), Local 
Intranet, Trusted Sites, and Restricted Sites.
In the Security Level for this Zone section, select a security level. You can 
choose from three settings, and each setting provides a different level of 
security:

174
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
✓ Medium: Prompts you before downloading potentially unsafe content. 
Will not permit unsigned Active X controls to be downloaded. (Look at 
Figure 12-5 to see the Medium security setting for the zone.)
 
✓ Medium-High: This is the default setting and is appropriate for most 
Web sites. Prompts you before downloading potentially unsafe content. 
Will not permit unsigned Active X controls to be downloaded. (Figure 
12-6 shows the Medium-High security settings for the zone.)
 
✓ High: If you select the High security level, you may not be able to get 
to the Internet. This setting provides the most secure connection by 
implementing the maximum safeguards and disabling less secure 
features. (Figure 12-7 shows the High security settings for the zone.)
I recommend that you use the Medium-High setting (the default). You will 
find that by using this setting you can surf the Web without much difficulty. 
The Medium setting may not provide enough protection, and the High setting 
may cause issues when surfing the Internet.
 
Figure 12-6: 
Medium-
High 
security 
settings.
 
After you choose the level of security you want, click the Apply button and 
then click OK; the settings are saved.
If you click the Custom Level button in the Security Level for This Zone area, 
the Security Settings – Internet Zone dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 
12-8. This dialog box allows you to set the security features for the three 

175
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
levels I mention previously. By setting security manually through this dialog 
box, rather than by choosing Medium, Medium-High, or High, you can pick 
what features you want to disable. The level and default settings are best 
when you aren’t comfortable working with computers. If you have some 
expertise, you can use the Custom Level settings to choose your desired 
security features.

Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Windows Firewall
In the Manage Security Settings For section in the Security Center (refer to 
Figure 12-2), click the Windows Firewall link to open the Windows Firewall 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 12-9, with the General tab displayed.
 
Figure 12-9: 
The 
Windows 
Firewall 
dialog box.
 
You can use this dialog box to see whether the Windows Firewall — and any 
other firewall you’ve installed — is running. The General tab has two main 
settings:
 
✓ Green shield with a check mark:
 
• On (Recommended): The firewall is on.
 
• Don’t Allow Exceptions: For use in public networks, such as in 
airports, which are less secure connections. Windows Firewall will 
not notify you when it blocks programs.
 
✓ A red shield with an X and an Off option. If the firewall is off, the Off 
option is selected and your firewall isn’t running. This isn’t a recommended 
practice because your computer is vulnerable.
Windows has a new version of the firewall product. This version’s stronger, 
but be careful about running two firewalls at the same time. They could 
cause a problem, and you may not be able to access the Internet.

177
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
I recommend that you run your own firewall. You can purchase one or use a 
free one such as Comodo, which I discuss further in Chapter 11.
The Windows Firewall dialog box has two other tabs: Exceptions and 
Advanced, which I discuss in the following sections.
Exceptions tab
Figure 12-10 shows the Exceptions tab. Notice that you can select certain 
applications to allow them access to your computer, or you can deselect 
them to deny access.
 
✓ Add Program: Click this button to add programs to the exceptions list. 
Programs you may add are those that may need to check for updates, 
such as virus protection. 
 
✓ Add Port: Click this button to open a port through the firewall. I 
recommend you use this feature judiciously to prevent an inadvertent 
opening of ports. When a port is open through the firewall, any traffic 
can come through the firewall. So be careful adding ports. 
 
✓ Delete: Click this to delete all exceptions that are checked.

Advanced tab
Figure 12-11 shows the Advanced tab.
 
Figure 12-11:

This tab includes the following four sections:
 
✓ Network Connection Settings: When you click Settings, the screen in 
Figure 12-12 appears with two tabs:
 
• Services: If the check box in this list is selected, that service 
has access to your computer. You can see the list of services in 
Figure 12-12.
 
• ICMP: Click this tab to see the various Internet Control Message 
Protocols (as shown in Figure 12-13). You can select the protocols 
you want your computer to accept. Be careful what you allow, 
especially if you don’t know what the protocols do. Better to have 
your firewall default setting address the protocols that could be 
problems.
 
• Services: If the check box in this list is selected, that service has 
access to your computer. You can see the list of services in 
Figure 12-12.
 
• ICMP: Click this tab to see the various Internet Control Message 
Protocols (as shown in Figure 12-13). You can select the protocols 
you want your computer to accept. Be careful what you allow, 
especially if you don’t know what the protocols do. Better to have 
your firewall default setting address the protocols that could be 
problems.

180
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Automatic Updates
Automatic Updates is the bottom link in the Manage Security Settings For 
area of the main Security Center screen (refer to Figure 12-2). When you 
click that link, the Automatic Updates dialog box (as shown in Figure 12-14) 
appears. Here you can set times for Automatic Updates to run. Run these 
during times when you aren’t using your computer because this usually takes 
up computer resources and causes your computer to run slowly.
 
Figure 12-14: 
Options 
in the 
Automatic 
Update 
dialog box.
 
When the updates are loaded, restart the system so that the automatic 
updates schedule will take effect automatically. When the download 
completes, the computer will restart automatically. To avoid disruption, set 
Automatic Updates to run in the middle of the night. I also recommend that 
you set Automatic Updates to search every day to be sure you have the latest 
updates installed on your computer.
As you can see in Figure 12-14, the Automatic Update process options are
 
✓ Automatic (Recommended): If you select this option, you can set the 
frequency and time from the drop-down lists provided. After selecting 
this option and setting the schedule, you don’t have to think about it 
again.
 
✓ Download Updates for Me, but Let Me Choose When to Install Them: 
If you select this option, you have to remember to install the updates 
manually.
 
✓ Notify Me but Don’t Automatically Download or Install Them: If you 
select this option, you have to remember to both download and then 
install the updates.

181
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
✓ Turn Off Automatic Updates: I don’t recommend. If you select this 
option, you need to check for updates by going to the Microsoft Web 
site and then download and install any that you find.
Windows Defender
Windows Defender is a spyware blocking program that finds and eliminates 
spyware. The software is free for Windows XP, but you have to download 
it from Microsoft. Windows Defender is included with Windows Vista and 
Windows 7. Figure 12-15 shows Windows Defender in XP (which looks the 
same in Vista).
 
Figure 12-15: 
Windows 
Defender in 
Windows XP.
 
To access Windows Defender for Windows Vista and Windows 7, choose 
Start➪Control Panel and then click the Windows Defender icon. For Windows 
XP and Server 2003, load it into your startup menu so that Windows Defender 
comes up automatically. To load Windows Defender into the startup menu, 
just follow the download screens as you would when you download any 
program. The download places a shortcut on the desktop that’s available 
when your system boots up. Windows Defender doesn’t run on Windows 
2000 because the release was before its completion.
As shown in Figure 12-15, across the top of the screen are four buttons: 
Home, Scan, History, and Tools. I discuss these in the following sections. At 
any time, you can click the question mark button for help.

182
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
The XP version of Windows Defender does look significantly different from 
the Windows 7 version. The Windows 7 version does affect the performance 
of your computer while running a scan more than the XP version.
Home
The Home screen is the program’s main screen where you can determine 
whether any unwanted software is running on your computer (refer to 
Figure 12-15). At the bottom of the screen, you can see when the last scan 
ran on your computer and when more scans will be performed (if you have 
the scans set to scan your computer automatically). As you can see on this 
screen, it’s scheduled to scan at 2:00 a.m. daily. Finally, you will see that the 
real time protection is on.
Scan
The Scan button allows you to manually scan your computer for spyware. 
You can set the program to have Windows Defender scan automatically 
according to a schedule. This is from the Tools button, which I discuss in the 
“Tools” section, later in this chapter.
History
To see a history of scans completed on your computer, click the History 
button (see Figure 12-16). Here’s where all the problems are logged from the 
completed computer scans.
When you join Microsoft Spynet, any software that Windows Defender 
detects is sent to Microsoft to review where the software came from, actions 
you applied or Windows Defender applied automatically to rid your system 
of the spyware, and whether the actions were successful — including 
quarantining or removing the software from your computer.
Near the upper-right corner are two links:
 
✓ Allowed Items: Items that are permitted on your computer. Defender 
does not monitor them unless you remove them from the list. Click 
the Allowed Items link to see the Allowed Items log. Allowed items 
are those programs and files you choose to permit even though 
Windows Defender determined that they might be a threat to your 
computer. 

183
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
✓ Quarantined Items: Click this link to see the quarantined items of 
completed scans, as shown in Figure 12-17. Here you can see the 
quarantined spyware by your computer scans and take action for 
the quarantined software.

184
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Tools
When you click the Tools button at the top of Windows Defender, the Tools 
and Settings screen appears, as shown in Figure 12-18.
 
Figure 12-18: 
Windows 
Defender 
spyware 
blocking 
tools and 
settings.
 
Your choices here are Settings (Options and Microsoft SpyNet) and Tools 
(Quarantined Items, Allowed Items, Software Explorer, and Windows 
Defender Website). In the following sections, I talk about each choice in turn.
Options
Click the Options link (refer to Figure 12-18) to see the Options screen shown 
in Figure 12-19. Here you can set up a schedule for automatic scanning in 
the appropriately named Automatic Scanning section. Use the Frequency, 
Approximate Time, and Type drop-down lists to set your options. The 
figure shows the system set in Quick Scan mode (which scans areas of your 
computer that are higher risk, such as programs you are running when the 
scan is performed). Full Scan mode scans your entire system.
In the Default Actions section, you set the default Windows Defender display 
options that govern what Windows Defender does when it detects a malicious 
or an unknown program. For each alert level, Windows Defender can provide 
a recommendation based on the definition for the program, ignore the threat, 
or remove the program. You select the choice for each risk level and they 
range from the default setting to ignore, remove, or quarantine the item.

 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
Figure 12-19: 
Use these 
options 
to set 
automatic 
scanning 
and default 
actions.
 
Following the Default Actions section is the Real-Time Protection Options 
section (see Figure 12-20). I won’t bore you by listing every single one here. 
Real-time protection is just that. It’s done in real time; that is, right now, and 
on a scheduled basis. Real-time protection alerts you when spyware and 
other potentially unwanted software attempt to install themselves or run on 
your computer. It also alerts you if programs attempt to change important 
Windows settings. If you select the Use Real-Time Protection (Recommended) 
check box, the default settings for this category are provided. If the box is 
not checked, you will not have Real-Time Protection turned on.
The Advanced Options section is shown at the bottom of Figure 12-20. Here 
you can set what you want Windows Defender to scan. The boxes in this 
section are checked by default. I recommend that you leave these boxes 
checked.
Below the Advanced Options section (and not visible in Figure 12-20) is the 
Administrative Options section. Here you determine who can access the 
Windows Defender program to make changes.
Microsoft SpyNet
Microsoft SpyNet is the other link in the Settings section on the Tools 
and Settings screen (refer to Figure 12-18). Microsoft SpyNet offers two 
memberships: basic (default) or advanced. Both are free. With advanced 
membership, you can monitor software for changes, and Defender alerts you 
when changes occur. Basic membership doesn’t perform those tasks. Some 
personal information may be sent to Microsoft, but Microsoft doesn’t use the 
information to identify or contact you. This is applicable to both the basic 
and advanced membership settings.

186
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
 
Figure 12-20: 
Windows 
Defender 
options.
 
Quarantined Items and Allowed Items
The Quarantined Items and Allowed Items in the Tools section on the Tools 
and Settings screen (refer to Figure 12-18) essentially show you logs listing 
the spyware captured during a scan. You can then decide to allow or delete 
the spyware. See the “History” section, earlier in this chapter, for more 
details.
Software Explorer
Software Explorer is a tool (the link is found in the Tools section on the 
Tools and Settings screen; refer to Figure 12-18) that ensures you’re running 
software that won’t damage your computer. The Software Explorer tool (see 
Figure 12-21) lets you know what software runs on your computer; it gives 
you the software manufacturer’s name, the size, the file path, the file location, 
whether it shipped with the Windows operating system, and so on. If the 
software isn’t legitimate, this tool flags it. You can then decide to remove or 
disable the software from your computer. (Sometimes, legitimate software 
is flagged, so you’ll want to review what’s flagged before removing it.) A 
classification also lets you know whether the software has permission to run 
on your system. You can then make the choice whether to run it.
 
Software Explorer isn’t used in Windows 7 because Microsoft says it had 
nothing to do with spyware, and therefore caused confusion for the home 
users.
Windows Defender Website
Click the Windows Defender Website link (in the Tools section on the Tools 
and Settings screen; refer to Figure 12-18) to find information about Windows 
Defender and get the latest updates.

Engaging User Account 
Control in XP and Vista
Managing user accounts is important to maintain computer security. Adding 
new users can create problems especially if you have a guest account 
enabled. I recommend that you don’t enable the Guest Account feature in 
Windows XP or Vista. The reason for my recommendation is that someone 
can use the guest account to log on to your computer by setting his own user 
name and password.
Managing user accounts in XP
To locate the user account management tools in XP, do the following:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
2. Click the User Accounts icon, as shown in Figure 12-22.
 
 The User Accounts screen appears (see Figure 12-23).
 
 On the User Accounts screen are three tasks (Create an Account, 
Create a New Account, and Change the Way Users Log On or Off), which 
I discuss in the following sections.

188

Change an account
When you click the Change an Account link on the User Accounts screen 
(refer to Figure 12-23), two account options appear: the administrator’s 
account and the guest account (as shown in Figure 12-24). You can have 
more than one guest account on your computer.

189
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
Figure 12-24: 
Choosing an 
account to 
change.
 
When you click one of the accounts, a new screen appears. Click the 
administrator’s account icon, and the screen in Figure 12-25 appears where 
you can make changes to the account. Only the administrator can get to this 
account to make changes after the accounts are set up on your computer 
since it is password protected.
 
Figure 12-25: 
Choose 
what to 
change in 
the account.
 

190
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Under Change My Account Type, you have only two choices: computer 
administrator or limited. The computer administrator has full rights to make 
changes to the systems settings, set up user accounts, and so on. Limited 
users cannot make changes to the system or add other users.
Click the Set Up My Account to Use .NET Passport option to have online 
conversations with friends and family, create your own personal Web pages, 
or sign into .Net Passport–enabled pages. .NET-enabled pages allow you to 
sign in with the same password for all Web sites that require a user ID and 
password. When you sign up for .NET, you need to use only one password.
The second user account command is for the guest account (refer to Figure 
12-24). When you click the Guest icon, a screen similar to what’s shown in 
Figure 12-26 appears. As you can see, this lets you decide whether to turn on 
the guest account. I recommend that if you do not need the guest account, do 
not activate it. Why create a security hole for no reason?
 
Figure 12-26: 
Decide 
carefully 
whether 
to activate 
the guest

Create a new account
In Figure 12-23, notice the Create a New Account link. If you click this link, a 
screen similar to what’s shown in Figure 12-27 appears. This screen allows 
you to set up another account. After you name the new account, click the 
Next button to display a new screen, as shown in Figure 12-28. Here you can 
pick the account type from two choices:

191
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
✓ Computer Administrator: Has control to add or delete users, download 
software, install software from a disk, and so on.
 
✓ Limited: Users that are limited can access only their own programs and 
cannot add or delete users. Limited users also cannot add programs or 
software.

Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Change the way users log on or off
Click the Change the Way Users Log On or Off link (refer to Figure 12-23) to 
arrive at the choices in Figure 12-29. You can choose a welcome screen or a 
fast user switching screen. These screens are what the user — you or 
someone you’ve given permission to log on to your computer — sees when 
he logs on. After you make your choices and click the Apply Options button, 
the system saves your options.
 
Figure 12-29: 
Make your 
choice 
and click 
the Apply 
Options

Managing user accounts in Vista
To manage user accounts in Vista, choose Start➪Control Panel and then 
click the User Accounts icon. Follow the commands to accomplish the tasks 
you want to manage user accounts. The User Account Control (UAC) is a 
management tool for managing accounts in Windows Vista. You can disable 
this function if you choose to do so. To add a new account in Vista, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel➪User Accounts.
 
2. In User Accounts, click the Add or Remove User Accounts button.
 
3. Click Create a New Account button and then add an account name.
 
4. Select the account type — Standard or Administrator — and then click 
the Create Account button.
 
5. Click the Password Hint button to add a password to the account you 
just added and then type the password twice.
 
6. Click the Create a Password button.
 
 That’s it — you added a new user account with a password to your system.

193
 Chapter 12: Dispensing Security with Windows XP, Vista, and 7
 
In Windows 7, the UAC tool is also used to manage user accounts. The windows 
are different than they are in Vista, but the concept is the same and the 
various screens guide you through how to work with user accounts. The UAC 
management tool is something you may not need if you don’t have a number 
of users on one computer in your home.
Windows 7 Security
Windows 7 security uses two tools that I discuss earlier in this chapter: 
the Security Center and Windows Defender. Windows XP and Vista use the 
Security Center for monitoring the firewall, automatic updates, and virus 
protection. Windows 7 uses the Action Center to monitor the firewall, 
automatic updates, and virus protection. The symbol for the Security Center 
is a shield with four colors (red, green, blue, and yellow).
 
I recommend that you purchase a copy of a commercially available antivirus 
protection program. You can also download free spyware protection programs 
that minimize your exposure to spyware. Most commercially available antivirus 
protection programs also screen for spyware. After installing the protective 
programs, be sure to set them up for automatic updates. I discuss this topic 
further in Chapter 11. You access the Action Center and other Windows 7 
security features through the Control Panel.
Turning off alerts
The User Account Control (UAC) feature alerts you if changes are made 
to any user accounts or added software. In Vista, dialog boxes appeared 
whenever you tried to install software. Most thought this was an annoyance. 
However, it does serve a purpose: It lets you know that changes are being 
made to your system via added software. Whether you want to keep the 
software is for you to decide.
In Windows 7, you can turn off the alerts if you have administrative rights 
to your computer. According to Microsoft, you’ll be protected anyway 
from malicious software. In my humble opinion, it’s better to be notified if 
something changes or attempts to change on your system than have a false 
sense of security that nothing happens to your computer and that you’re 
practicing safe Web surfing habits. Issues crop up daily when you’re on the 
Internet, so having alerts pop up is a small price to pay to ensure that your 
system is secure from Internet malware.

194
Part V: Safeguarding Electronic Information 
Windows Firewall
Windows 7 has its own firewall as a part of the security features, but it may 
not be compatible with the firewall you’re running. Before you install a 
commercially available firewall, check with the manufacturer to find out 
whether its product will turn off features of the Microsoft firewall. The 
firewall may not and you will have issues with the two firewalls conflicting 
with each other. 
Running two firewalls may not work, and your system may not permit 
Internet access because the firewall rule sets may conflict with one another. 
(A rule set tells the firewall what to block.) If the firewalls are configured 
correctly, you can run two firewalls, but I don’t recommend this for a novice 
user.
Finding other security features
Windows 7 has another new security feature — BitLocker. BitLocker gives 
you the option of encrypting your portable storage devices so if they’re 
stolen, no one can access the information. You can choose a passphrase to 
encrypt the data on the portable device. BitLocker appears as a separate icon 
for the service and in the Control Panel, too.
To change security settings, go to the Control Panel and depending on the 
task you want to complete, click an icon to access the information to make 
the necessary changes. The screenshots may change from Windows XP, 
Windows Vista, and Windows 7, but the screenshots earlier in the chapter 
can help you in using the settings you desire to protect your system and your 
personal information.

Part VI
Taking Back Your 
Good Name

In this part . . .
I
f you discover that you’re a victim, don’t panic. You 
can reclaim your identity. In this part, I take you 
through the process of filing reports, filling out forms, 
closing compromised accounts, and opening new ones.

Chapter 13
Starting the Process of Reclaiming 
Your Identity
In This Chapter
▶ Getting through all the paperwork
▶ Initiating a fraud alert
▶ Managing compromised accounts
▶ Sending dispute forms
▶ Understanding the government’s role
I
n this chapter, I guide you through the paperwork necessary to regain 
your good name and credit if you’ve been a victim. Doing paperwork isn’t 
the most exciting exercise, but in the case of identity theft, doing the work is 
important and will help you in the long run.
Filling Out the Initial Reports
Completing the initial reports is the first step in regaining your identity. 
The first report is the police report. For this report, you must be persistent 
because some jurisdictions may not be as responsive as others to identity 
theft cases. Next in the process is to place a fraud alert on your credit report.
Placing a fraud alert on your credit report
The fraud alert requests creditors to contact you before opening any new 
accounts or making any changes to your existing accounts. As soon as the 
credit bureau confirms your fraud alert, the other two credit bureaus are 
notified automatically to place fraud alerts. You have to request that the 
reports be sent to you. The credit bureaus do not automatically send 
you the reports. You do, however, get confirmation letters from each bureau 
that the fraud alert has been placed on your credit report. The letter contains

You don’t need a copy of your credit report. All you need to do is call. The 
credit bureau will send you a copy of your credit report when you place the 
alert.
Reporting the crime to law enforcement
Because identity theft is a crime, you need to file a report with law 
enforcement where you live. Contact one of the various local enforcement 
agencies, such as city police, sheriff’s department, county police, and town 
or village police. They’ll let you know whether you have the right jurisdiction 
for reporting the crime; if you don’t, they’ll tell you which one to contact and 
provide you with the contact information.
For most jurisdictions, you can contact the local law enforcement agency by 
telephone or online to file the report. When you do so, you’re given a report 
number. You need to send this report number to your creditors along with 
your completed theft affidavit.
Completing an ID theft affidavit
The theft affidavit is found on the FTC Web site under Identity Theft at 
www.ftc.gov. You must send the copy of the police report and the 
completed affidavit to all your creditors. The following is the process 
for completing the theft affidavit:

199
 Chapter 13: Starting the Process of Reclaiming Your Identity
 
✓ To fill out the form, you must download and print it; you can’t complete 
the form online. Included in the instructions are the addresses for all 
three major credit bureaus.
 
✓ You can notarize the form in the space provided. You aren’t required by 
law to have the form notarized. Some businesses don’t require the form 
to be notarized, but doing so may persuade them to accept the form 
as more credible. Note: You may have to pay a fee to have the form 
notarized.
 
✓ Some creditors want you to complete their own dispute form. Call them 
to find out whether they require you to fill out a separate form and 
then follow up the phone request in writing. Send the letter Certified 
Mail return receipt so that you have a record of the request. There are 
spaces to fill in the police report information, including agency report 
number, the name of the officer or person taking the report, and the 
e-mail address of the agency.
 
✓ The affidavit has a documentation checklist that includes a valid 
government-issued picture identification card, such as a driver’s license, 
state-issued identification card, or passport. The last item in this section 
is proof of residency during the time the event or disputed transaction 
took place.
 
✓ The affidavit has a chart where you can list all the accounts that were 
opened fraudulently with the address of the company where the account 
was opened, the account number, type of account (for example, auto 
loan, credit card, or mortgage), the date it was opened, and for what 
amount. Send the chart to the credit bureaus as a part of the affidavit. 
The chart is also a valuable tool for you to track what contacts have 
been made and their responses.
 
✓ You must send the affidavit to the fraud department of each creditor, 
bank, or utility that provided the identity thief with unauthorized credit, 
or purchases and services. Some companies have their own dispute 
forms; they’ll send them to you after they receive your affidavit. Still 
other companies don’t accept the affidavit and will only accept their 
own dispute form and a police report, but you won’t know until you 
send it to them.
Figure 13-1 shows the sections of the report from the Federal Trade 
Commission Web site.
After you complete the form, send it to one of the credit bureaus and have 
a fraud alert placed on your credit file. The credit bureau you send it to 
automatically notifies the other two bureaus to place a fraud alert on their 
files.

Taking Care of Compromised 
Accounts: The First Steps
When you discover that your accounts have been compromised, follow the 
steps in the following sections to stop their misuse. Waiting doesn’t help 
your cause. As soon as you find out that some of your accounts have been 
compromised, check all your accounts. For more details, see Chapter 14.
Call your credit card company
Take out your contact sheet of credit card companies (see Chapter 6). The 
contact information you need, including account numbers and the credit 
card phone number, should be on your list.
Call your credit card company and let them know that you’ve been the 
victim of identity theft. Keep a journal listing the person you spoke to when 
you called, the date and time, and a summary of the conversation for your 
records. For a sample journal see Table 13-1. You can use Microsoft Excel 
to make your journal, or you can use a table in Microsoft Word — it doesn’t 
make a difference as long as you include the information I list in the sample.
Make sure that you record all the information on the form in the Fraudulent 
Account Statement section (refer to Figure 13-2). Then follow up your phone 
conversation by sending a copy of your completed Fraudulent Account 
Statement form for that credit company.

204
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
 
Keep copies of everything you send to any creditors. Send all correspondence 
to any creditors Certified Mail return receipt and keep the return receipts for 
your files.
Call your bank
After you realize that you’ve been a victim, don’t forget to call your bank. You 
should have the contact information on file (see Chapter 6). Ask your bank to 
freeze your accounts if you see evidence that they’ve been compromised.
For checking accounts, the bank will want to know which checks you 
have outstanding. A quick look at your check register should provide the 
information you need. The accounts may need to be closed and new ones 
opened. If your checks are lost or stolen, for example, the person(s) using 
your checks can drain your account in short order. To get more details about 
personal checks, see Chapter 6.
Chapter 14 contains specifics about closing compromised accounts, 
and Chapter 15 contains instructions for opening new ones.
 
If you’re a victim of identity theft and feel that one or more of your bank 
accounts have been or will be compromised, close the accounts and open new 
ones.
 
Choose a new PIN (personal identification number) for your new ATM card. 
Don’t use the old one in case it’s been compromised, as well.
Ask for fraud dispute forms
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has an ID Theft Affidavit form (see the 
section “Completing an ID theft affidavit”), but some creditors have their own 
dispute forms and may not accept the FTC ID Theft Affidavit form. You must 
ask whether they have their own form and have them send it to you.
On the form, enter the information about your conversation, using the 
information in the sample journal in Table 13-1. If the creditor has its own 
form, mark the Dispute Form column with Yes. You already recorded the 
date of the call in your journal; this date will serve as the date you requested 
the dispute form, as well.
The credit bureaus have their own dispute forms, too. Chapter 5 shows 
a sample dispute form from Experian. You simply order the form online. 
Remember that you need a current credit report number, no older than 90 
(Equifax is 60) days, to file a dispute.

205
 Chapter 13: Starting the Process of Reclaiming Your Identity
Don’t get bullied into paying for charges you didn’t make on accounts you 
didn’t open. Stand your ground. After you file the dispute or theft affidavit 
for the fraudulent accounts and charges, you don’t have to pay the disputed 
charges, and the charges can’t be given to a collection agency, per the Fair 
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA).
Getting Straight with the Government
If you are a victim of identity theft, you need to let the government know. 
Filing a complaint with the FTC will help your case. The FTC reports the 
theft to the appropriate law enforcement agency, as well. The FTC does not 
investigate the crime of identity theft.
Filing a complaint with the Federal 
Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a complaint form on its Web site, 
www.ftc.gov. Clicking the Identity Theft link (in the Quick Finder section) 
takes you to the information shown in Figure 13-3. If instead you click the 
Consumer Protection tab (at the top of the FTC site’s home page), you’re 
taken to the Bureau of Consumer Protection page, shown in Figure 13-4. From 
there, you can file a complaint by clicking the File a Complaint tab, which 
takes you to the page shown in Figure 13-5.

Assistant. When you’re ready to file your complaint, click the link, and you’re 
taken to the first step of the complaint process, as shown in Figure 13-6. As 
you answer each question, the next question automatically appears.

action.
What to do if your SSN has 
been used to get a job
The Social Security Administration (SSA) doesn’t help consumers fix their 
credit problems. They will help, however, if someone other than you uses 
your Social Security Number (SSN) to get a job. To get help from the SSA, 
visit its Web site at www.ssa.gov, as shown in Figure 13-7. On the left, click 
the Report Fraud, Waste or Abuse link, which takes you to the page shown in 
Figure 13-8. Here you find links to forms and more information.
Protecting your SSN
As I discuss in Chapter 8, when it comes to your 
SSN, you can never be too careful. Take these 
precautions:
 ✓ Always protect your SSN; don’t give it out 
freely.
 ✓ Never carry your SSN in your wallet or 
purse.
 ✓ Make sure that you secure your personal 
records at home to prevent a thief from 
finding your SSN.
 ✓ After your application for credit has been 
completed, request that only the last digits 
of your SSN appear on any copies and ask 
that the original application be destroyed in 
your presence.

Tools
In this section, I briefly describe a couple of tools you can use to help you in 
the battle against identity theft. These tools are in place because both the 
state and the federal government recognize the problems that identity theft 
causes and that it’s a fast-growing crime in the U.S. and has been for the last 

209
 Chapter 13: Starting the Process of Reclaiming Your Identity
several years. In recent years, financial crimes, including identity theft, have 
gotten a lot of media attention and legislators felt compelled to address the 
growing problem. So use the tools that are here for you.
Government laws
Knowing the government laws can help protect you. Federal and state 
governments have laws in place to help protect you from identity theft. One 
such state law is the credit freeze (see Chapter 2), which is free if you’ve 
been a victim of identity theft. At the federal level, you can get annual, free 
credit reports from each credit bureau. Fraud alerts are free and can be 
extended from 90 days to 7 years with a police report. I discuss this 
government tool in the following section.
Fraud alert
I discuss fraud alerts in detail in Chapter 2, but remember that they’re a tool 
that can be used to help you if you’ve been a victim of identity theft. Fraud 
alerts can also be used to help if your mail was stolen like mine was. The 
fraud alert is then deployed as a preventative measure, which it was in my 
case. A fraud alert is an effective tool to help you in the fight against identity 
theft.
 
I placed a fraud alert on my credit reports when my mail was stolen several 
years ago. The alert was for 90 days and covered all three bureaus. I did so as 
a precaution and used the police report number to place the alert. I wasn’t a 
victim of identity theft, and I’m not sure whether the fraud alert prevented my 
identity from being stolen and any other losses or if I was just plain lucky 
that no important mail was in the box at the time of the theft. At that time, 
I immediately switched to paperless statements for my bank accounts and 
credit cards.

Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 

Chapter 14
Closing Compromised Accounts
In This Chapter
▶ Closing your bank accounts
▶ Acting quickly if you lose your ATM card
▶ Contacting the check verification companies
▶ Closing your credit accounts
C
losing bank accounts (and subsequently opening new ones) isn’t my 
idea of a fun-filled afternoon, but if your accounts have been compromised, 
you have to do it, which is just what this chapter helps you do. To close out 
your accounts, you can close and open new accounts over the phone as most 
banks allow this. In this chapter, I also cover what to do if you lose your ATM 
card: Promptly report it to your bank and ask for a new one. I also mention 
how check verification companies can be a great ally, especially if someone 
cashes bad checks in your name. Finally I discuss closing credit accounts.
Closing Bank Accounts
When should you close your bank account? Close accounts anytime 
the account has been compromised, or when you notice unauthorized 
withdrawals on your monthly statements from your bank. Look for checks 
you didn’t write for stuff you didn’t purchase or cash you never withdrew.
Naturally, close any accounts that have been opened fraudulently in your name. 
Don’t forget to check your credit report for fraudulently opened accounts. Notify 
your bank or any other financial institutions where these accounts reside; 
contact the financial institutions where these fraudulent accounts were 
opened and ask them to investigate and close as fraud because you are a 
victim of identity theft and tell someone there that the accounts weren’t 
opened by you and that you’ve been the victim of identity theft. Send the 
fraud affidavit to the bank (or use their fraud form if they don’t accept the 
fraud affidavit).

212
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
In some cases, you need to close the account even if there aren’t some 
strange transactions because your account information has been compromised. 
By looking at your bank statement on a regular basis, you can catch the 
problem so you can do damage control by working with your bank. But close 
any account that has been compromised immediately no matter how small 
the amounts taken were. Report all missing sums of money to your bank 
immediately; do not wait, even if the sum is small.
 
Better to be safe than sorry, even though closing the account may be a 
pain. Closing savings accounts isn’t usually as much of a pain as closing a 
checking account because you don’t have to balance it, but both are equally 
important — your money is your money.
When your ATM card goes missing
You’re at the ATM ready to withdraw some cash, but you can’t find your ATM 
card. Don’t panic; let your bank know immediately — even on weekends and 
holidays. You can do this several ways:
 
✓ Go to your bank’s online Web site and report the lost card.
 
✓ Call the bank at the number that’s printed on your monthly statement 
and report the lost card.
 
✓ Visit a branch of your bank during business hours and report the lost 
card. If the bank is closed for a holiday you can contact someone at the 
company that backs the credit card — Visa or MasterCard perhaps — 
and tell them to block or cancel the card if you are unable to reach your 
bank. 
 
✓ If your card is lost or stolen overseas, your bank may not have an 
international number, but the company that backs the card does.
When you report the lost card, the bank cancels the card immediately, 
and a new one is issued in about ten days. When you’re traveling, even in 
foreign countries, most banks will arrange to send you a new temporary 
card overnight for your convenience. Remember to change your PIN as well 
(because you don’t know if the old PIN was compromised).
If you lose your ATM card while traveling, don’t use a computer from your 
hotel room (even in the U.S.) to go online and check your account because 
hotel Internet systems can be compromised (and not just wireless connections). 
Don’t use the phone from your hotel room, either. Hotel phone systems in 
some foreign countries, as well in the U.S., have been compromised and even 
monitored by the government.

213
 Chapter 14: Closing Compromised Accounts
You don’t need to be paranoid about using technology; you just need to be 
mindful that some vulnerabilities can be exploited in Internet connections 
and phone services from hotel rooms. This isn’t true in all countries, but it 
helps to be cautious. The same holds true for the U.S.; most hotel phones and 
Internet connections are safe to use to check your bank account information, 
but I suggest erring on the side of caution.
If you don’t have your account information, your bank may be able to get it 
with the last four digits of your Social Security Number (SSN) and by verifying 
other personal information, such as your home address and so on. 
Don’t check your bank information from a coffee shop, a restaurant, public 
computers, public Wi-Fi connections, and so on. In other words, be careful in 
public places.
When you get your ATM card, call to activate it. When calling from your 
home or another phone number that’s tied to the account, you can easily 
activate the new card. Do so through the automated system by calling the 
800 number on the sticker that’s on the card when it’s sent to you. Calling 
the 800 number from another number than the one that’s on the account will 
require you to speak to a live person so that she can verify some personal 
information for security reasons.
 
Several years ago, I forgot to take my card from an ATM at a branch of my 
bank. I didn’t realize that I left the card until I arrived at work. The bank was 
close to where I worked, so I went back to see if the card was still in the 
machine. The card was gone, so I immediately called someone at the bank and 
he cancelled the card and issued me a new one. The card arrived in about ten 
days and couldn’t be used until I activated it. I also changed my PIN. I checked 
the balances in my accounts when I spoke to the bank representative on 
the phone, and the accounts weren’t compromised, so I didn’t close them. I 
checked my monthly statement religiously every month and encountered 
no problems. (Note that some cards are activated when you first make a 
purchase.)
 
To limit your liability to $50 for the lost ATM card if it’s used to drain your 
bank accounts, you must report the loss within 48 hours; otherwise, you may 
be liable for $500 in losses from your accounts. At some financial institutions 
your ATM/debit cards have the same zero liability as a credit card. Check 
with your financial institution to find out if this is the case; do not assume 
that your bank has zero liability for its ATM cards. You need to read and 
understand your reporting requirements when it comes to letting your 
institution know that there are fraudulent or mistaken charges. Some require 
two business days. Please read the section of your contract under reasonable 
care to get all the details about your institution’s policies for reporting. See 
the nearby sidebar, “Clarifying the zero liability issue.”

214
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
When you review your monthly account statement and notice unauthorized 
withdrawals on it, report it to your bank immediately. You have only 
60 days from the date the account statement was mailed to you to report 
any unauthorized withdrawals on your monthly statement, or you can 
potentially lose all the money in your account.
 
Make sure that you add your ATM card to the list of notifications you need 
to make if your wallet or purse is stolen. Report the stolen ATM card to your 
bank within the 2-day time frame, and be sure to review your monthly statement 
and report any unauthorized withdrawals within the 60-day time limit.
Reporting to check verification companies
If your personal checks have been lost or stolen, contact your bank and close 
your account. Have the bank contact someone at Chex Systems to alert him 
that your checks have been lost or stolen. (Chex Systems is the network used 
by banks and credit unions to report mishandled checking accounts or 
overdrawn accounts.) Only banks that subscribe to the service can report 
mishandled accounts, but as a consumer, you can report stolen or lost 
checks. Members report the history of account mishandling and the 
outstanding debt.
 
You can order a consumer report from Chex Systems to see what’s in your file. 
Simply go to www.chexhelp.com and follow the link to order your consumer 
report.
Don’t forget to contact your local police department about stolen checks. If 
your checks are used fraudulently, you will receive notification of that fact in 
writing from the merchant who had the check bounce. At that point, you can 
contact a check verification company (see Table 14-1) that the merchant uses 
and notify them of the fraud. This list isn’t all inclusive; other companies are 
listed on the Internet. The ones on the list are simply the most widely used. 
Clarifying the zero liability issue
ATM/debit cards have the same zero liability as 
a credit card. To clarify the zero liability issue, 
by law, you’re held only to the $50 maximum 
if you weren’t negligent or if you reported the 
issue in a timely manner. In practice, financial 
institutions are not holding to the $50, but are 
claiming zero liability for PR and marketing 
reasons. Don’t take the chance that your bank will 
forgive any charges; report the loss immediately 
and check your account immediately as well to 
make sure that no money is missing. This means 
that you don’t have any charges that you don’t 
recognize as yours on your statement. With 
online banking, this is easy to check.

Covering checks that you’ve 
written already
The checks you wrote before you closed the account need to be paid. Your 
bank pays the checks with funds from your new account. Table 14-2 shows 
the information you need to provide for each check you’ve written.

Item
Information

Don’t write new checks on the closed account. You must work with your bank 
to cover the outstanding checks. Shred all the old checking account’s checks 
so that you won’t use the wrong check and they won’t fall into the wrong 
hands. Checks from a closed account in the wrong hands can cause a nightmare 
for you because you’ll have bad checks with your name, address, and more 
on them. Even though the account’s closed, someone can still try to use the 
old checks from the old account. Sometimes the fraudster will make up new 
checks by using your account numbers, because the necessary information — 
the bank’s routing number and your account number — is on the checks. 
Both numbers appear at the bottom-right corner of your check. The first set of 
numbers is the routing number, and the second set is your account numbers.

216
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
Today, merchants use the point-of-sale (POS) check verification system, 
which works like this:
 
1. You write a check for a purchase and hand it to a cashier.
 
2. You sign your name on an electronic pad (the same one used for ATM 
and credit card transactions).
 
3. The cashier runs the check through the register and then hands you the 
canceled check and receipt.
 
 On the back of the check is bank information for the merchant and is 
what would be stamped on the check if the check was sent to your bank 
for payment. In this case, the process is completed electronically.
 
4. Your checking account is debited as it would be if you’d used your ATM 
card for the transaction.
The system helps eliminate NSF checks that pass through the company 
because the funds need to be available before the transaction is completed 
and a receipt is printed. When the funds are insufficient to cover the purchase 
amount, the check is rejected. The system helps everyone save money 
because the merchant isn’t stuck with bad checks and doesn’t need to raise 
prices to cover the bad checks and lost merchandise.
 
When you pay online, your bank sends the check to pay the bill with money 
from your account, using a different a check that doesn’t have your account 
number on it.
Closing Credit Accounts
Close all credit accounts you didn’t open or authorize to be opened. Also, 
close any credit accounts that aren’t used. You can close the accounts by 
telephone. To close an account by telephone, use the checklist in Table 14-3.

The account has not been used in several months (the cut

The account was opened without my knowledge (I am not

I can be reached at (give a telephone where you can be reached).
Sincerely,
 
Your Name
Closing credit accounts you didn’t open is very important. To help with 
closing these credit accounts, use the fraud affidavit on the FTC Web site, 
as I indicate in the sample letter in Figure 14-1. The affidavit lets the creditor 
know that you’re disputing the account. Along with the fraud affidavit, send 
a police report, especially if you’re an identity theft victim. Sending these 
documents helps you state your case to the creditor that you aren’t the 
one who opened the account(s). In addition, you may want to place a fraud 
alert on your credit report — or even better, place a credit freeze on your 
credit report. (The freeze is free if you’ve been a victim of identity theft.) The 
sooner you close these credit card accounts that someone else opened in 
your name, the sooner you’ll be on the road to getting your good name back.
Whether you contact the credit issuer by phone or in writing, don’t delay. 
Do it now so that the card issuers know that you’ve been a victim of identity 
theft and that the accounts aren’t yours. When you submit the proper 
documents proving that you have been a victim of identity theft, such as a 
fraud affidavit and a police report, the credit card issuers have to address 
the situation with you. The police report has a case number on it, and this is 

218
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
information the credit issuer will request and use to verify your story. (Note: 
Not all banks or financial institutions will require a police report, but it is a 
good idea if you can get one.) Credit issuers might also have their own forms 
for you to complete; when you write the credit issuers, ask for any forms they 
might have.
Some credit accounts need to be closed by writing to the creditor rather than 
calling them on the phone. They’ll want to know that the account closing is 
because of fraud and as I previously state, they want more than just word of 
mouth.
 
No matter how you close the account, ask for written confirmation that the 
account’s been closed. The credit company doesn’t automatically close 
accounts just because you haven’t used them, they’re paid in full, and have a 
zero balance. You need to tell the company to close the accounts. Cutting up 
your cards (or not activating your cards) from the account doesn’t close the 
account. Of course, you do still need to cut up the cards.
Another scenario that causes you to close a credit account is if your credit 
card becomes missing. Whether you lose the card or believe it’s been stolen, 
report that it’s missing to your card issuer immediately. The card issuer’s phone 
number (likely a toll-free number) appears on your paper statement or online. 
Have your account number or SSN readily available when you call. The card 
issuer will probably close the account and issue you a new card right away. 
Any outstanding balance is transferred automatically to your new account and 
card number. You still need to make any payment that is due on legitimate 
transactions by the regular due date or you will be assessed late fees.
Credit card fraud versus identity theft
There’s a big difference between credit 
card fraud and identity theft, which I explain 
in Chapter 3. Credit card fraud involves the 
unauthorized use of one or more of your credit 
cards to make purchases. Identity theft, on the 
other hand, is the stealing of your name and 
personal information to open new accounts in 
your name.
If you review your monthly statement and notice 
that you’ve been a victim of credit card fraud, 
notify your credit card issuer immediately. 
You can call the number on the back of your 
credit card. Tell someone at the company that 
you want to speak to the fraud department. 
After you tell the card issuer’s representative 
what charges are fraudulent, she will issue a 
temporary credit on your credit card statement 
until she completes the investigation. For ATM 
and debit transactions, you get your money 
back ASAP. You’re also notified in writing 
about the call you made and the charges you’re 
contesting. This process usually takes about 
five to ten business days to receive the letter. In 
30 days, you will hear that the credit card issuer 
has received your complaint. You can expect to 
get a resolution within 90 days. 

219
 Chapter 14: Closing Compromised Accounts
In most cases, especially for small amounts, the 
credit card issuer will permanently remove the 
charges from your statement account balance. 
After checking the next month’s statement, 
if you find the same charges again with new 
dates of the transaction, call the card issuer 
again. This happened to me, and the credit card 
issuer cancelled my card and issued a new one 
because it was a subscription authorization 
(recurring charge).
Most credit card companies do a better job 
today of monitoring their card holders’ accounts 
in an attempt to spot fraud.

Chapter 15
Opening New Accounts
In This Chapter
▶ Opening new bank accounts
▶ Keeping tabs on your new accounts
▶ Using a new PIN for a new account
▶ Opening new credit accounts
I
n this chapter, I outline the things you need to do when you open your 
new accounts. I show you how to keep tabs on the account balances, help 
you pick a new personal identification number (PIN) for your new account, 
prompt you to change your paycheck to direct deposit to your new account, 
and detail how to open new credit accounts.
Opening New Bank Accounts
After you close your old bank accounts, you need to open new ones. This 
is usually done in one step if the account is being closed because of fraud 
as opposed to consumer request. For your new checking accounts, you’re 
issued temporary checks to use until your permanent ones are printed. The 
temporary checks don’t have your name, address, or phone number printed 
on them; use them only as a last resort and be prepared for the third degree. 
(And note that many merchants will not accept them.)
Opening new bank accounts isn’t hard, but it can be a pain, especially 
because you might have to go to the bank to open the account. If you are 
closing a compromised account, you can do that by phone; if you open a new 
account with that same institution, you can likely also do that by phone. If 
you have to go to the bank to open a new account, you must provide an ID 
(government picture ID, passport, driver’s license, and so on) because the 
Patriot Act requires identification of anyone opening a bank account. The 
bank verifies your identification while you’re there. After the verification 
is complete, you’re asked to sign the forms after you decide what type of 
account you want.

222
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
As you know, banks offer a variety of accounts. When choosing what type of 
account to open, consider these issues:
 
✓ Does the account require a minimum daily balance or collect a service 
charge? Some accounts and banks require you to keep a minimum daily 
balance in your account, or the bank will charge you a monthly fee 
for checking accounts. Some consider the savings combined with the 
checking account to meet the minimum daily balance; however the bank 
does it, you need to maintain the minimum daily balance or you may 
have to pay a service charge, which varies from bank to bank.
 
✓ Arrange to pick up your new checks at the bank. The banker will give 
you temporary checks to use until the design you’ve chosen arrives 
from the printer. Have the new checks sent to the bank address, not 
your home address. You can pick them up at the bank. I’ve done this for 
years and haven’t had a problem. With debit cards and online banking, I 
find I don’t write as many checks as I did in the past, but I still check my 
statements often to make sure that there aren’t any problems.
After you decide what type of account you want, complete the paperwork 
and give the banker some money to open the account.
 
The bank usually prints your name, address, and telephone number on your 
checks as well as your account number, bank routing number, and the bank’s 
name and address. These checks contain all the information an ID thief needs 
to make up a fake ID to pass off your checks as hers, so don’t make it easy for 
her to steal them from you.
Table 15-1 is a quick checklist to use as a guide for opening new accounts. 
The checklist isn’t all inclusive, but it gives you a good idea of what needs to 
be done when you open a new account. Add to the checklist as necessary to 
ensure that you cover the important items.

223
 Chapter 15: Opening New Accounts
Maintaining good records
The balance in the new account is probably the transfer of the balance from 
the old account. As you did with your old accounts, keep tabs on the balances 
in the new accounts. Review the initial account balance and check it against 
your first monthly statement to make sure that the account hasn’t been 
compromised.
Keeping good records is important. The checks you write, deposit receipts 
you receive, your direct deposit stub from your paycheck, and more — all 
this can be of value to you when you balance your checkbook. Then when 
you receive your monthly statement, you can keep tabs on the balance in the 
account.
Your savings account balance is a little easier to keep tabs on. Because you 
don’t write checks on the account, you can check the account balance 
simply by reviewing the monthly statement your bank sends to you. The 
only thing you need to track are the withdrawals you make. Keep your ATM 
and withdrawal receipts so that you can compare them to your monthly 
statements.
Tracking your accounts online
Keeping tabs on your accounts became easier with the advent of online 
banking, which is a great convenience. You can see your balance anytime you 
want and from almost anywhere. I say almost anywhere because you need 
to be discreet when accessing your online account in public to make sure 
that nobody steals your account information, user ID, and password. Having 
online, 24/7 access to your accounts means that you have no reason not to 
keep tabs on them.
Rerouting your paycheck
If you closed your existing account that 
your paycheck was deposited in, did you 
remember to notify your employer of the change 
in accounts? You don’t want your paycheck 
bouncing around in the cold, hard world and 
not have a warm, friendly home to be deposited 
in. To make the change, your employer might 
need a voided check from your new checking 
account, similar to what you provided when you 
initiated direct deposit on the old account, and 
you might have to fill out another form. After a 
couple paychecks, the switch takes effect. You 
have to deposit your paycheck into your new 
account on your own for a bit.

224
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
 
With online banking, you can immediately correct any problems you notice. 
This is a benefit, especially for my checking account when I noticed the bank 
charged me a monthly checking account fee that was debited that day. I 
immediately called the 800 number and spoke to a banker. I explained that the 
account I have for my checking account doesn’t have a monthly fee. The 
person I spoke to agreed and immediately reversed the charge and credited 
my account. Without online banking, it would’ve been one month before my 
statement arrived in the mail.
Online bank records are easy to access, and you can make a printout if the 
need arises. In the past with paper statements, you needed to keep them 
for your records. Now you don’t need to keep paper records. Your bank has 
folders set up for the statement months, and if you need a particular month’s 
statement, you can get it by going to that month and clicking it.
Choosing a secure user ID and password
Online banking requires you to have a user ID and password. Choose a 
password that is different than any other one you are currently using. Also 
choose a password that isn’t easy for someone else to guess but that you 
can easily remember because you don’t want to write it down. The password 
needs to have letters, numbers, and special characters (@, #, &). You can use 
a catchphrase to help you remember the password. Catchphrases can be 
something you made up and only you know what it is. (If you need to write 
down either your password or the catchphrase, store the paper in a fireproof 
safe or some other safe place.)
Don’t panic if you forget your password. On your bank’s sign-in page, you’ll 
likely find a Forgot My Password link, which lets you to set up a new password. 
If you answered security questions during the setup phase, you’ll see those 
questions, and you must answer them to verify your identity. Here are 
sample questions:
 
✓ What is the name of the elementary school you attended?
 
✓ What was your favorite job?
 
✓ Who was your childhood hero?
 
Do not give real answers to these questions. Use fake ones, so if someone has 
real information about you, they can’t answer these questions and gain access 
to the account.
 
When answering the question you choose, the answer box might be case 
sensitive (it should say whether it is). So if you type the answer in all caps 
during sign-up, you need to answer it in all caps as well. You may think I’m 
stating the obvious, but under pressure, you may forget and you get only 
three attempts before you’re locked out of the system for security reasons. 
Being locked out isn’t the end of the world. If you get locked out, call your 
bank and tell someone there that you’re locked out of your account. The 

225
 Chapter 15: Opening New Accounts
banker will refer you to someone in IT (Information Technology) who will ask 
you some security questions to verify your identification and then he’ll reset 
your password. 
Some banks and credit card companies reject your logon if it looks like it 
came from a different computer than the one you signed up on. This is the 
case when you purchase a new computer, add a router, and so on. This is 
a security feature in place because the computer looks different; the MAC 
address (the address of the computer that is built into the system) changes 
from the original you used to sign up or used previously to enter your 
account information. The bank or credit card company sends you an 
authorization number via e-mail, phone, or text message — whichever 
method you choose. The number is then typed in an Authorization Number 
box. After you do this, you’re granted access to your account information. 
Note: This might not be the case for all institutions; yours may not do this. 
You need to be aware, however, that it may happen like this.
Using a new PIN
So you closed your old accounts and opened new ones. You now have new 
account numbers, but what about your PIN? You were probably given a new 
ATM card. Did you remember to change your PIN, as well? Better safe than 
sorry if you closed the accounts because they were compromised. Use a new 
PIN, period! With the ATM card doubling as a debit card, I caution you to err 
on the safe side and change your PIN.
Debit cards are easy to use and in most cases, you don’t need to sign a 
receipt. With selfcheckouts at grocery stores, home improvement stores, 
and so on, a thief can easily use a debit card without having to sign a receipt. 
However, the thief will need your PIN to use the card. So the better the 
PIN — that is the harder it is for someone to guess — the harder it is for a 
thief to obtain it. (Unfortunately, if the thief uses your debit/ATM as a credit 
card, no PIN is needed for most transactions.)
 
When you change account numbers for any reason, change your PIN as well, 
regardless of whether your PIN has been compromised. In fact, change your 
PIN periodically even if you haven’t lost your ATM card. I know you have a 
great deal of passwords, PINS, user IDs, and so on to remember, but it’s 
important to change your PIN.
 
When you choose a new PIN, choose one that’s easy for you to memorize (so 
that you don’t need to write it down) and hard for others to guess. PINs are 
usually made up only of numbers, but you can remember the numbers by 
replacing the numbers with letters. You can make up a catchphrase that’s 
easy to remember and then replace the letters with numbers. For example, 
you could choose 47861 and remember it as the catchphrase “thank goodness 
it’s Friday again” — TGIFA. The T is 4, the G is 7, the I is 8, the F is 6, and A is 1. 
This is just an example; do not use this for your PIN. 

226
Part VI: Taking Back Your Good Name 
 
Don’t use the last four digits of your Social Security Number (SSN) or your 
birthday. If you must use a phone number or birthday, use a friend’s phone 
number or birthday, or some other number that you can remember easily but 
that a thief can’t guess easily.
Opening New Credit Accounts
To maintain a good credit score (see Chapter 5 for more information on 
credit scores), don’t open two new credit accounts at one time. You’re better 
off to stagger the new accounts because the new accounts haven’t aged, so 
they don’t have a credit history.
If you’ve been the victim of identity theft and filed all the proper notifications 
and closed all compromised and fraudulent accounts (see Chapter 14 for 
more details), however, you can open new credit accounts without 
compromising your credit rating. But don’t overdo it.
So really be selective of what accounts you need and don’t open accounts 
just for the sake of opening accounts. Check the interest rates on any new 
account’s credit card and other accounts (new car loans, and so on) before 
you open them. If at all possible, stay away from the lure of a low introductory 
rate that will adjust in a year or so and then become a variable rate. These 
are similar to the teaser mortgage rates that got people into the financial 
mess they’re in at the present time.
How many credit accounts you need or have is up to you, but you probably 
don’t want too much debt. (To help track your credit accounts, subscribe to 
one of the online services from one of the major credit reporting agencies — 
TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax — that I outline in Chapter 5.) Today you 
can use your Visa, MasterCard, Discover Card, and American Express in most 
major department and even grocery stores, as well as at gas stations. This 
limits the number of cards you need. The days of “the more credit cards 
you have, the better” are gone. This helps limit your exposure to credit 
card fraud because you don’t need to carry so many cards with you. One 
card will usually do the trick, and then you have only one to worry about 
losing if your wallet or purse is stolen.
Opening credit accounts online
Like everything else today, you can apply for new credit cards online. To do 
this, go to the credit card company’s Web site and locate the link for new 
applications (or whatever the card company calls it). Signing up for a credit 
card online is easy and convenient, but you still need to be careful about 
where you sign up. If you’re at home and have the proper safeguards in place, 
use your computer to sign up. Don’t use a public computer, such as one at 

227
 Chapter 15: Opening New Accounts
the local library or school. Public computers are not secure and someone 
can log on after you and see where you went; if you didn’t log out for some 
reason, that person can then access your account. The application is 
submitted to the card company electronically through its Web site.
Before you fill out any online application with personal information, make 
sure the site you’re on is secure. To determine whether the site is secure, 
look for these signs:
 
✓ A lock at the bottom-right corner of the page: If the lock icon is in a 
locked position, the site is secure. 
 
✓ The VeriSign logo: The appearance of this logo tells you the site is 
secure.
 
✓ The https:// in the URL field: If https:// appears in the address 
field of the online application page, you’re on a secure page.
 
Do not open e-mails that solicit you to sign up for a credit card even it looks 
legitimate; this can be dangerous because most e-mails that solicit your 
personal information are bogus. If you open the e-mail and click the link to 
the Web page, you’re taken to the site the thief set up to steal your personal 
information.
Go directly to the credit card company’s Web site to complete the application 
process because it’s safer. To find the Web site, call the company and ask 
for its URL or go to the BBB and find it. Do not just do a search and start 
completing the application because you may not be on a legitimate site.
Proving your identity when opening 
new credit accounts
When you open new credit accounts, you’ll probably need to show proof that 
you are who you say you are. You need to have a picture ID if you’re opening 
the account at a financial institution different from your current one. If you’ve 
placed a fraud alert on your credit report, the alert requires creditors to 
verify your identity and you’ll be notified by the credit bureau that an inquiry 
has been made about your credit. (For more details on credit reports, see 
Chapter 5; for information on placing a fraud alert on your credit report, see 
Chapter 13.)

Hang in there, be persistent, and get it done.
Follow a Checklist
Time to get organized. If you’re the victim of identity theft, you can use the 
checklist in Chapter 2 to get organized and plan your counterattack, or you 
can create your own. Whether you use the checklist in this book or make up 
your own doesn’t matter; you just need to follow a checklist. The checklist 
is your road map to help you navigate your way through the issues you face 
and the tasks you need to do in order to reclaim your identity. The checklist 

232
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
helps keep you focused on the task of reclaiming your identity after you’ve 
been a victim. By using a checklist, you’ll know what’s been done and what’s 
left to do. A checklist helps you keep your sanity in this tough situation by 
taking a systematic approach to reclaiming your identity.
Keep a Journal
If you take nothing else away from this book, know that the more you 
document about your case, the better off you are in the end. Document 
everything in detail, keep copies of everything you send out, and keep 
summaries of phone conversations. You can’t over document, but you can 
shortchange yourself if you do it too sparingly. Your journal needs to list all 
the people and organizations you’ve contacted, their titles, dates, and a brief 
summary of the conversation if it was by telephone. This will be a valuable 
reference for your follow-up work. Documenting everything during the fight 
to restore your credit and good name seems like a distraction, but it isn’t. 
Your journal can be a valuable tool in the fight.
Your journal is a record of what you did and when, and anything you can put 
in your arsenal to help you reclaim your good name and good credit. 
 
Online companies that help you with identity theft have all the forms and 
the process online, so keeping a hard copy journal may not be necessary. 
However, keep a backup of all the documents you complete on a portable 
drive just in case the Web site for the company crashes. This way you can still 
continue the fight to reclaim your good name and credit.
Complete a Fraud Affidavit
As soon as you realize that you’ve been the victim of identity theft, you need 
to complete a fraud affidavit and send it to the creditors of your fraudulent 
accounts. The affidavit is the first step on the road to reclaiming your identity. 
The fraud affidavit can be found on the Federal Trade Commission Web site as 
the theft affidavit (see Chapter 13 for more details). Keep copies of each affi-
davit you send out in your journal, along with the certified return receipt.
Completing the fraud affidavit isn’t difficult, but it can be time consuming. 
You need to complete one for each creditor, but you can streamline the 
process by completing the Victim Information section and then making 
copies to use for all the rest of the creditors and banks to whom you’re 
sending the form. Be sure to sign each one before you send it. Don’t forget to 
make and keep copies for your journal.

233
Chapter 16: Ten (or So) Tips to Make Reclaiming Your Identity Go More Smoothly
Send the affidavits via the United States Postal Service Certified Mail return 
receipt. The Certified Mail receipt serves as proof that the addressee 
received the document. Keep the receipts for your journal.
Record All Correspondence with Creditors
Keep a record of all verbal and written correspondence with creditors. If you 
choose verbal correspondence, you can use a tape recorder to make a record 
of the conversation, but you need to get permission from the other party 
before you can record the conversation. If you don’t get permission, you’re 
breaking the wiretapping law. You can ask for permission and then have that 
person repeat for the tape recorder that she has granted you permission. 
When you use a tape recorder, make sure that you preface the conversation 
with the repeat of the approval to record and the date, time, and the name 
of the person and organization’s name for your records. Follow up the 
conversation with a written summary of what was discussed.
For written correspondence, keep a journal of who (person and organization 
you addressed the correspondence to), what (fraudulent account, dispute 
charge, and so on), when (date), where (location, store), and a brief summary 
of the context of the document. Also keep a copy of the complete document 
that was sent and any documents you receive.
Follow Up
An important part of the process is follow-up. Just because you called and 
sent correspondence to close fraudulent accounts or to dispute charges 
does not mean that your issues will be addressed. You need to follow up, or 
nothing will happen.
Follow up all your telephone conversations with written correspondence and 
all your written correspondence with telephone calls. Your journal will come 
in handy to help you track when follow-up needs to be done.
Set up a tickler file, which lists the name of the person you contacted, and 
when and how you contacted him. The tickler file is used to track whom 
you’ve contacted along with the next time you should contact him for further 
follow-up.
Follow up within one week from your initial contact. After the first follow-up, 
ask when you can expect to hear from him. Mark your calendar. If you don’t 
hear back, contact him again.

234
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
Be persistent, but be tactful. You catch more flies with honey than with 
vinegar; being caustic won’t help your cause. If you seem to be getting 
nowhere with a particular person, by all means, ask to talk to someone higher 
up the ladder. Remember that your problem isn’t her problem; she isn’t the 
one who had her identity stolen. How you approach her will help you ensure 
that you’re her problem, as well.
Place a Fraud Alert on 
Your Credit Report
Contact one of the three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) 
and place a fraud alert on your credit report. This action is helpful in keeping 
the identity thief from continuing to use your good name and credit. The 
fraud alert is supposed to guarantee that a phone call is made to you any 
time an application for credit is completed for verification. However, 
companies can (and do) choose to ignore the fraud alert and process the 
application anyway.
You can place a fraud alert on your credit report by contacting the fraud 
department of one of the credit bureaus. Even though a fraud alert on your 
credit report isn’t a cure-all, it’s a good first step to reclaiming your good 
name and credit.
Sometimes creditors ignore the fraud alert and credit bureaus do not have to 
notify you when credit is approved, so it’s advisable for you to review your 
credit report regularly — at least monthly.
Document when you contacted the credit bureau to place the fraud alert on 
your credit report. You should receive written notification that the fraud 
alert was placed on your credit report. Each credit bureau will send you a 
letter.
I used the fraud alert when my mail was stolen; it was good for 90 days. The 
fraud alert is a good tool to help keep you safe if your mail is stolen; however, 
the credit freeze may be a better option. To minimize your exposure, don’t 
receive paper statements from the following.
 
✓ Credit card statements
 
✓ Bank statements: checking and savings
 
✓ 401K
 
✓ Stocks

235
Chapter 16: Ten (or So) Tips to Make Reclaiming Your Identity Go More Smoothly
I didn’t renew the fraud alert because no personal information was in the 
mailbox at the time. I changed to paperless statements after the mail was 
stolen.
File a Credit Freeze
Filing a credit freeze helps you prevent further damage to your good name 
and credit. As I discuss in Chapter 2, a credit freeze is a good tool to help you 
reclaim your identity because it prevents the identity thief from using your 
credit to open accounts in your name. If you’ve been a victim, the freezes are 
free; otherwise, you have to pay to implement the freeze. (Chapter 2 has the 
details about costs for those who aren’t victims.)
File a Police Report
Another important task for you to do is to file a police report. The police 
report needs to be filed in the city, town, or county where you reside. If 
your mail was taken from your mailbox, you must contact your local law 
enforcement agency. On the other hand, if your wallet or purse was stolen, 
you need to file a police report where the wallet or purse was stolen.
A police report helps you convince creditors that you have in fact been the 
victim of identity theft. The police report should be sent with the fraud 
affidavit you send to creditors.
When you call or go in person to file the police report, be persistent and ask 
for the financial or fraud crimes division. The report will most likely be taken 
over the telephone, but in some cases, you can make the report online. You 
may receive a follow-up visit or be contacted by the detective assigned to 
the case, or the report number may be all the contact you have about your 
report. This doesn’t mean that the police aren’t working the case; it means 
that they don’t need any further information from you at the present time. 
It may be helpful to add contacting the police to get a status report on your 
case to your follow-up effort.
Document in your journal the date and time you asked for a copy of the 
report to be sent to you, the agency from which you made the request, and 
the report number. When you receive the copy of the report, place it in your 
journal.

236
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
Filing a police report helps you when you file a fraud alert or credit freeze. 
The police report number is essential to filing extended seven-year fraud 
alerts and to file a free credit freeze. The police report adds credibility in 
making your case that you’re a victim of identity theft and the debts that 
have been accumulated in your name are not yours.
Dispute Charges You Didn’t Make
Don’t be pressured into paying charges you didn’t make or authorize. Even 
if the amount is small, don’t pay. The creditors will try and recoup some of 
their losses from you by telling you that if you pay this small amount, you’ll 
be helping yourself because the charge won’t go to collections. Well, after 
you dispute a charge and send your creditor a dispute letter, it can’t go to 
collections by law until it’s resolved one way or the other. Making a payment, 
in some cases, is considered accepting responsibility for the debt. This is an 
argument that can be used by creditors when you dispute the debt at a later 
date.
Credit card companies are usually quick to fix any charges that are truly 
fraudulent. I can attest to this because I’ve had fraudulent charges placed on 
my credit cards in the past.
If the credit account was opened fraudulently, request that it be closed and 
follow up with written documentation. Summarize the conversations in 
writing and place copies of any documents sent in your journal.
A fraud affidavit helps you when you challenge charges that aren’t yours on 
accounts you didn’t open. The affidavit along with a police report informs 
the creditor that you’ve been a victim of identity theft and you didn’t open 
the accounts in question. The creditor may still push back even with the 
affidavit, but you must be persistent to reclaim your good name and credit. 
Don’t get discouraged; you need to stick with the program and dispute all the 
charges that aren’t yours and the accounts you didn’t open.
 
If the creditor has his own paperwork for filing disputes, use it so he knows 
that you’re serious about your dispute.
Report Your Stolen Checks to One of 
the Check Verification Companies
Just reporting and closing your compromised checks at your bank may 
not be enough. The bank may not report the theft or counterfeiting of your 
checks to one of the check verification companies that I outline in Chapter 14. 

237
Chapter 16: Ten (or So) Tips to Make Reclaiming Your Identity Go More Smoothly
Also report the loss or counterfeiting of your checks to one of the check 
verification companies, even if you close the account and open a new one. 
You want to make sure that the incident is reported and that your name isn’t 
added to the list of people who pass bad checks. Even if you open a new 
checking account, the problem will still plague you.
The check verification companies have contact phone numbers for you to 
call and report stolen or lost checks. I list the phone numbers and several 
check verification companies in Chapter 14. (You can also find check 
verification companies by doing a Web search for them.)
 
Make sure that you document that you’ve opened a new account and that you 
notified your bank, the name of your contact at the bank, the date of your 
conversation, and the reason for closing your old account and opening the 
new one.
Close Compromised Accounts
Close all compromised accounts, including accounts that were opened 
fraudulently or accounts to which a thief has gained access. Keep any 
paperwork that shows the date the accounts were closed. Also include the 
name of the person you contacted to close the accounts. Place all this 
documentation in your journal.
When you close compromised credit card accounts, don’t just cut up the 
card and send the pieces to them. Be sure to include a letter similar to the 
one in Chapter 14, stating that you’re closing the account and the reason. 
Then keep a record of all the correspondence in your journal. Record the 
name of your contact, the date you spoke, and a summary of any telephone 
conversations.
Keep your journal in a safe place. Today, online companies help you reclaim 
your identity if you’ve been a victim. I discuss these companies in Chapter 9. 
Most of these companies have online journals you can use instead of a hard 
copy journal to track your progress in reclaiming your identity. Make sure 
that you back up your files in case something happens to your online data.

Solutions provide identity theft specialists to help you if you’re a victim. As 
a card member, you will have an 800 number you can call if you’re a victim 
and an identity theft specialist is assigned to help guide you on how to file a 
police report and close accounts with creditors. The Web site says that the 
Citi Identity Theft Specialist will stay on the phone with you as you place a 
fraud alert on your credit report. Also, Citi sends you an Identity Theft Tool 
Kit, which has fraud affidavit forms — a Security Affidavit and an Identity 
Theft Worksheet — and an information booklet provided by the FTC and 
Citigroup.
Credit Report Services
Credit report services give you unlimited credit reports and e-mail alerts of 
any inquiries into your credit. All three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, 
and TransUnion) provide these services (see Chapter 5 for more details). 
Companies also exist that provide services that aren’t affiliated with these 
credit bureaus. The services are worth the annual fee because you have 

242
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
unlimited access to your credit report. The only drawback is that you only 
have access to the credit report of the credit bureau’s service that you 
subscribe to. I recommend purchasing a three-in-one report at least once per 
year. The three-in-one report gives the status of your credit across all three 
bureaus and shows side-by-side comparisons.
Seriously think about subscribing to one of these services. I find it helpful; it 
helps to know I can go online and look at my credit report any time I want.
Registration Services
These are the opt-out requests that are sent to you by your financial institutions, 
credit card companies, and so on. The opt-out form is important because it 
helps you minimize the amount of credit card offers you receive in the mail 
or through telephone solicitations.
To opt out of other credit offers, you can call 888-567-8688 (see Chapter 2 for 
more details). The call takes about 30 seconds, and you’ll notice a dramatic 
decrease in the number of credit card offers sent to you in the mail.
Here is another contact where you can opt out:
Telephone Preference Service
Direct Marketing Association
P.O. Box 9014
Farmingdale, NY 11735
The preceding address is for you to opt out of telephone solicitations. 
Another way to remove yourself from the telephone solicitations lists is to go 
to the FTC site and add your name and telephone number to the National Do 
Not Call Registry (www.donotcall.gov). You can add your name to the list 
for free.
Here are several other mailing lists you can also send correspondence to in

Ten Security Tools You 
Shouldn’t Be Without
In This Chapter
▶ Protecting your information with a firewall
▶ Knowing more about spyware
▶ Using antivirus software
▶ Updating your operating system
▶ Managing user accounts
▶ Using strong passwords and encryption
▶ Increasing your Internet Explorer Security settings
▶ Protecting your shared files
▶ Knowing what e-mails to open
I
n this chapter, I briefly describe ten tips you can use to secure your 
computing. I discuss some of the ten in more detail in Chapters 11 and 12, 
but here I summarize these tips as a quick reference guide.
Use a Firewall
A firewall is important to have because it protects you from unwanted 
malware. (See Chapter 11 for more details.) Don’t rely solely on the firewall 
your Internet service provider (ISP) provides. The ISP firewall offers only 
limited protection, so it’s better to have your own software firewall or 
hardware firewall:
 
✓ Software firewall: This is software you can either purchase or download 
for free from the Internet. You can change the settings (dubbed rule sets) 
from the default settings. If you aren’t sure or really don’t know what 
you’re doing, don’t change the default settings; otherwise, you may not 
be able to get on the Internet.

246
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
 
✓ Hardware firewall: This type of firewall is a router or computer and is 
usually a small box or another computer that can be configured to be a 
firewall. This type of firewall also includes software.
Routers can also be configured to be run as a firewall. The firewall software 
program, which is where you set the rules you want the firewall to perform, 
runs the hardware firewall.
 
Make sure that your firewall is updated with the latest versions of the 
software. Most firewall programs let you know when updates are available. 
When you get an update notice, update your firewall immediately.
Use a Spyware Blocking Program
Spyware tracks where you go on the Internet. Issues with spyware you need 
to be aware of include
 
✓ Adware: Adware takes you to places on the Internet to sell you products 
that you may be interested in, based on what Web sites you’ve visited 
in the past. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want my Internet habits 
tracked by anyone.
 
✓ Malware: Malware is malicious software, and spyware might contain 
malware that can create problems for your computer.
 
✓ Trojans containing a keylogger program: The keylogger program 
captures all your keystrokes including all the usernames and passwords 
you type. The person(s) that puts the keylogger in the spyware then 
uses that information to log on to your bank account and capture other 
personal information.
To find and eliminate spyware from your computer, you can get an adware or 
spyware blocking program (such as Spybot or Ad Ware Personal) that scans 
and finds spyware. (Most virus protection programs also block adware.) I 
discuss this further in Chapter 11. To quarantine and remove spyware from 
your system, simply click the box next to the spyware when it’s found, click 
Quarantine, and then click Delete.
You can get available adware programs for a fee, and you can get free 
programs to block spyware. Get a copy of a spyware blocker program and 
then set it to perform scans automatically. Also, with Windows Defender, 
you can set it to automatically scan for spyware. (See Chapter 12 for more 
information.)
 
No matter what spyware program you choose, make sure that you set the 
program to perform scans automatically.

247
 Chapter 18: Ten Security Tools You Shouldn’t Be Without
Get Virus Protection
Viruses are real problems for your computer. Most viruses contain some 
type of malware that causes your computer to not work properly, to crash, 
or to destroy all your data. Numerous types of viruses are on the Internet 
with many ways to infect your computer. Viruses are spread mainly through 
e-mail attachments, so don’t open e-mails from people you don’t know. You 
can read more about this in the section “Don’t Open or Reply to Unknown 
E-Mails” later in this chapter.
To prevent viruses from infecting your computer, install antivirus software 
on your system. Some antivirus programs are available for a fee, but you can 
find free antivirus software as well. Whichever you choose, set the program 
to update automatically to stay current; otherwise, you risk being infected 
because virus writers are constantly changing and evolving them.
 
Installing your antivirus software once and then forgetting about it isn’t a good 
idea. If you don’t install updates for your antivirus program, you leave your 
computer vulnerable to being infected. Set the program to perform updates 
automatically so you don’t have to remember. You might be surprised to 
see how often the software updates, because the antivirus software makers 
are keeping up with the virus writers. The updates include the new Windows 
Defender program.
Some antivirus software also scans for and quarantines adware and spyware 
as part of its service. I use WebRoot, but I also have adware and spyware 
scanners that scan automatically.
Update Your Operating System
Operating system (OS) updates (also known as patches or hot fixes) play a 
critical role in keeping your computer protected. They also usually address 
a specific security hole in the software that can be exploited by those with 
malicious intent.
Windows Defender for XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 lets you set up 
automatic updates. (I discuss setting up the automatic update process in 
Chapter 11.) I recommend that you use automatic updates because other 
security features — such as a firewall — won’t help if your OS has security 
holes.
 
The main cause of most system crashes is an out-of-date operating system. 
For instance, this occurred in 2001 when Code Red (a denial-of-service attack) 
was unleashed on the Internet. A denial-of-service attack floods a server with 
so many requests that it causes the server to shut down. All the computers 

248
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
that didn’t have an update for Microsoft’s Internet Information System (IIS) 
crashed when hit with the Code Red malware. So make sure that your 
computer is protected by having all the current updates installed for your OS.
 
Most updates require that you restart your computer for the update to take 
effect. Schedule updates to take place when you aren’t using your computer — 
like in the wee hours of the morning.
Manage Your User Accounts
Manage user accounts if you have more than one user on your system and 
make sure that you have a strong password for the administrator account. 
Choose a password that can’t be guessed easily or figured out with a 
password-cracker program. Password-cracker programs work on two main 
types of attacks:
 
✓ Dictionary: Use of a program that runs through the dictionary and flags 
words that are used in passwords.
 
✓ Brute force: Continually tries all sorts of word combinations for 
passwords to find ones that are used on the system. This is blocked 
in companies by limiting the number of failed attempts to lock on to 
three. At home this is not the case; the brute force program will 
continue to run.
I also recommend that you change your administrative password at least 
every 90 days and more often if you choose. Make sure that you turn off the 
guest account. By doing this, you help minimize the possibility of someone 
signing on your computer as a guest.
Create Strong Passwords
In Chapter 11, I discuss passwords in greater detail; however, this is as good 
a time as any to reiterate that a strong password is important. Follow these 
guidelines:
 
✓ Don’t use dictionary words — for example, money and love — because 
the bad guys have tools that can find out your passwords by running 
dictionary scans.
 
✓ Use a password that no one can guess because it makes sense only to you.

249
 Chapter 18: Ten Security Tools You Shouldn’t Be Without
 
✓ Use a longer (eight to ten characters), such as TgiF#$&480, rather than a 
shorter password, such as simply TgiF.
 
✓ Mix special characters — %,*, $, #, and so on — into your password. 
(See Chapter 11 for more about the types of characters to use to 
strengthen your passwords.) Again, TgiF#$&480 is a good example.
 
✓ Use a passphrase as your password. A passphrase is a password you 
make up in which the first letter of a word or a phrase is used in the 
password. For example, Thank goodness it’s Friday would be TgiF. 
Add special characters and numerals — to make it TgiF%*&480, for 
instance — and you have a password you can easily remember but 
which others can’t easily guess. 
 
✓ Change your password at least every 90 days.
Use Encryption
Encryption scrambles a message into nonreadable script and helps secure 
what’s on your computer’s hard drive. You don’t need to encrypt all your 
files — just those that contain any personal information. You can purchase 
encryption programs for your home computer. If someone manages to gain 
access to your computer, he can’t open the encrypted files without a key. 
The key is a password used to unscramble the encryption so it can be read.
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is one such program you can purchase. You can 
choose between a home or business version. PGP is easy to use and does a 
good job protecting your files, even when those files are sent in an e-mail. 
When I use PGP, I encrypt files that contain security information when I send 
them via e-mail. In doing so, no one outside the organization knows what the 
company’s security issues are.
 
If you lose your key, you can’t open your own files that you’ve encrypted. The 
information will be lost.
Increase Internet Explorer 
Security Settings
Surfing the ’Net is dangerous, but you can make it safer by increasing your 
Internet Explorer Security settings. You can do this through the Control 
Panel, which I discuss in some detail in Chapter 12.

250
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
 
Be careful which setting you choose. If you choose the highest setting and run 
a firewall, you may be blocked from getting to all Web sites. You can adjust 
your settings as necessary by selecting Custom Setting and then choosing 
what you want to prevent from accessing your computer.
Protect Shared Files
Shared files allow other users that have a password to access files on your 
computer that you’re willing to share. Think of what files you want to share 
and make sure that they don’t contain personal information before you make 
the files available for others to see. Hidden (administrative) shares or hidden 
files aren’t needed if you aren’t in a business environment, so you can disable 
them. This prevents someone from accessing the files remotely. Hidden 
shares are for sharing files between various computers.
You can disable hidden shares in Windows XP, Vista, and 7; just follow these 
steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪Run, and then type regedit and click OK.
 
 This opens the Registry Editor. 
 
2. Navigate to
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\
lanmanserver\parameters
 
3. Type the value word autosharewks and a value of 0.
 
4. Restart your computer.
A firewall program blocks most access to your shared files. To be safe, you 
can protect the files by securing a guest account. You can’t turn off the 
guest account, but XP Home does actually let you disable the guest account 
because it is an integral part of XP. For Windows 7, you can turn off the guest 
account. For Vista Home you can’t.
To password-protect the account on XP Home, do the following:
 
1. Bring up the command prompt by choosing Start➪Run and then 
typing cmd in the run dialog box. 
 
 This is the same for Vista and Windows 7 as well.
 
2. Type net user guest password.
 
 Replace password with a password of your choosing.
 
 The guest account is password protected. This just adds another layer 
of security to your computer.

251
 Chapter 18: Ten Security Tools You Shouldn’t Be Without
Don’t Open or Reply to Unknown E-Mails
The simple rules are: Never open e-mail attachments from unknown users 
and never open attachments you weren’t expecting. Most of these attachments 
contain viruses. Today, most attachments are scanned for viruses before you 
open them, but it’s a good idea not to open the attachment in the first place.
If you do open an e-mail from an unknown source and it contains a virus, 
your antivirus program can help protect you by scanning the document for 
known viruses.
If you open an e-mail from an unknown person, you let that person know 
that your account is good and you will likely receive more e-mails from that 
person or others if your e-mail account information is shared. To make your 
computer safer, don’t open e-mails from people you don’t know.
 
Set up an e-mail filter to filter out junk mail no matter what e-mail system you 
use at home. To filter e-mail is simple: If the person is not in your address 
book, the e-mail is sent to the junk mail folder. Setting up a junk mail folder 
is easy (in work environments, this is done automatically by your system 
administrator), and most free e-mail systems automatically do some filtering. 
You can fine-tune your junk e-mail by not accepting e-mails in your inbox from 
anyone not in your address book. Doing so filters out the junk and unwanted 
mail.

I
dentity thieves use numerous scams to trick you into giving personal 
information. In this chapter, I discuss the most common scams and how 
you can protect yourself from becoming a victim of them. Most of the so-called 
new scams are variations on the theme of these most common ones.
Phishing
Phishing is pronounced “fishing” and is exactly that — except that the fish 
they’re attempting to reel in is you and not game fish, like salmon or striped bass.
Phishing is a way to get information by sending spam e-mail to a large 
number of people. The e-mails can request information by saying that your 
ATM/debit card number and PIN (personal identification number) need to be 
verified by a financial institution because it “lost your data” in an upgrade to 
their software program, which was done because of all the fraud that’s taken 
place. The e-mails will ask for some type of personal information.

254
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
A link for a Web site is provided for you to type your information. You’re told 
in the e-mail that if you don’t provide the information, your account will be 
suspended.
 
These e-mails often have errors in grammar and spelling, and look like 
someone lacking a good command of the English language wrote them.
When you click the link in the e-mail, you’re taken to a Web site that isn’t 
really the Web site of the institution mentioned in the e-mail. The site is set 
up for the thieves to capture your ATM/debit card number and PIN so that 
they help themselves to your money.
Another recent scam is circulating in which victims are sent an e-mail stating 
that they’re under investigation by the IRS. In the e-mail, the victims are 
informed that they can assist in the investigation by providing “real” 
information and are directed to a Web site that looks official. When on the 
site, victims are asked to provide personal information such as their Social 
Security Number (SSN), drivers’ license numbers, bank account numbers, 
and credit card numbers. The information is requested under the guise that 
if you cooperate, the “IRS” can quickly clear up the matter.
The IRS never sends e-mail to contact taxpayers about issues concerning 
their accounts. The IRS sends letters on IRS stationery in an IRS envelope 
sent via the United States Postal Service. Don’t be duped: Ignore the e-mail 
and contact the criminal investigation division of the IRS to let them know 
that you received an e-mail requesting personal information. This is a 
common scam today. There are some e-mails that are supposedly from the 
FBI as well.
 
To avoid becoming a victim of phishing, just don’t reply to the e-mails soliciting 
personal information no matter how convincing they may seem. Discard the 
e-mail and contact someone at your financial institution to let him know about 
the scam.
 
Internet ScamBusters, www.scambusters.org, lists all the known e-mail 
scams that are currently being distributed. You can also subscribe to a free 
e-mail newsletter that outlines the latest scams and is a monthly publication.
The Bank Examiner Scam
In a nutshell, the thief approaches you stating that he’s investigating a 
dishonest teller and says that a bank official will be contacting you about 
how you can help. The bank official will want you to withdraw your own 
money to help with the investigation. To avoid falling victim to this old scam, 
remember that law enforcement doesn’t ask you for money to conduct an 

255
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus One) Common Scams and How to Avoid Them
investigation. Most of the time, law enforcement conducts the investigation 
without soliciting any help. This helps keep the investigation covert so that 
those under investigation aren’t alerted that they’re being targeted.
Don’t fall for this old scam. If someone approaches you about an investigation 
and says that a bank official will be contacting you about how you can help, 
tell her to hit the road. Then call the police to report it and give a description 
of the person who approached you.
The Doctored ATM
To perpetrate this scam, the thieves install wireless equipment on legitimate 
ATMs to steal your ATM card number and PIN. The attachment fits over the 
existing card slot and looks like the original slot. This is used to read the card 
and capture the ATM card number. A camera is placed in the bottom deposit 
envelope holder and used to capture the keystrokes of your PIN. The thieves 
usually install several of these “doctored ATMs” in one area.
To capture the information, the thieves sit in a car nearby and receive the 
wireless transmissions for the doctored ATMs. The best time to capture 
ATM card numbers and PINs is on weekends and holidays. Armed with the 
information, the thieves proceed to withdraw thousands of dollars from the 
accounts.
To protect you from this type of scam, be wary of using ATM machines that 
seem out of the ordinary. For example, the card slot has cracks around the 
edges where the holder is affixed to the machine. If you see unusual 
instructions on the ATM screen, such as asking you to enter your PIN three 
times, be on guard. If the holder for the deposit envelopes on either side 
of the machine is located where a camera would have a clear shot at the 
keypad, cover the keypad when you type in your PIN by placing either your 
right or left hand over the keypad while you type in your PIN with the other 
hand. You should be able to shield the screen and still see what you’re 
typing.
Phone Fraud
Here’s how this one works: You receive a call from someone, and he tells 
you that he’s with the fraud division of your credit card company and is 
investigating fraudulent charges on your card. He tells you that the charges 
that are fraudulent come from a company that sells computer hardware 
that’s been involved in a lot of fraudulent charges. He mentions the name of 

256
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
the company and you tell him you’ve never heard of them and have never 
ordered anything from them. In order to help them, he needs to verify your 
card number, your full name as it appears on the card, and the expiration 
date of the card.
Don’t give your credit card number to someone who’s called you. Tell him 
you’ll call the credit card company. After you tell him that, hang up the 
phone and then call the number on your credit card statement and inquire 
about the investigation. Don’t ask the caller for a callback number.
Another phone fraud is the call forwarding scam. The scam works like 
this: Someone calls claiming to be a bank employee and states that she’s 
investigating why correspondence from the bank has supposedly been 
returned to the bank. The caller then asks a series of leading questions to 
get you to give her the name of your bank, is this the correct credit card 
name or number, and are these the correct account numbers? Next, the 
thief impersonates you and contacts your phone service provider to verify 
that your phone line has call forwarding. Now the thief poses as a telephone 
company employee and instructs you to leave the phone off the hook or not 
to answer it for an hour so system maintenance can be performed.
Armed with all this information and the fact that you aren’t answering your 
phone or have it off the hook, the thief dials codes that forward your calls to 
a number controlled by her.
Next the thief uses the account information you provided earlier to use 
Western Union to transfer money out of your account. She also makes 
fraudulent charges on your credit card.
Because your calls are forwarded to the thief, she receives all the verification 
calls, and you’re unaware of what’s happening. Using this scam, a thief can 
steal thousands of dollars from you in less than an hour.
 
Don’t give out personal information to strangers on the phone, and you won’t 
fall victim to this scam.
Card Verification
Card verification scams are usually done by phone or via e-mail. The person 
calling or writing says that he needs to verify your credit card information for 
your account at some online merchant or pay service. He tells you that the 
server containing the credit card numbers has been hacked into and all the 
data on the credit card accounts has been lost, or he tells you that he’s 
verifying your information to make sure that it’s current. The caveat is that if 
you don’t provide the information, he’ll cancel your account.

257
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus One) Common Scams and How to Avoid Them
If the scam is done by e-mail, the URL provided links you to a site set up by 
the thieves and when you enter the information to “verify” your credit card 
number, name, and expiration date, they capture the information on their 
server. Then you know what happens: Your card is used to make fraudulent 
charges. When the scam is done by phone, the thief writes down all the 
information needed to use your credit card for fraudulent purposes.
 
To avoid this scam, don’t give the thieves the information either on the phone 
or online.
You Won the Lottery!
Here’s how this scam works: You receive a letter, fax, or e-mail claiming that 
you’ve won a large sum in an overseas lottery game. You probably didn’t 
know you even entered the lottery. The letter says that the lottery commission 
for whatever country’s lotto has tried unsuccessfully to contact you about 
your windfall. In order to collect your winnings, you need to provide the lotto 
commission with your bank account information so that it can wire transfer 
the money to your account. Some of these scams have a form sent with the 
letter that asks for personal information, such as your full name (including 
your middle name), birth date, address, your occupation, marital status, and 
telephone number. Some of the forms also ask for next of kin information, 
including first and last name, address, telephone number, and occupation. 
What a great way to solicit more victims. The form also features a bank 
transfer section that asks for your bank’s name, address, account numbers, 
routing number, and telephone number.
After you provide the information to the lotto commission, the only one who 
wins is the person who sent the letter. Imagine that! To avoid becoming a 
victim, don’t give out this information. Just discard the letter, e-mail, or fax.
 
These letter scams have been successful because they play to the greed 
aspect of human nature. There’s no such thing as free money.
Bogus Charities
You’re watching TV, and the phone rings. You answer, and the person on 
the other end says that she’s from a charitable group soliciting donations. 
Be careful. This has been used as a ploy to get your credit card number and 
expiration date, or a personal check.

258
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
 
Legitimate charities exist that use telephone solicitation for donations. You 
can give to your favorite charity and still protect yourself. There are other 
ways to find out how to make a donation other than doing so over the phone. 
For instance, go online and look up the charity. The Web site will have all the 
contact information to make a donation. Or you can open the Yellow Pages in 
your area and look up the address and phone number of your favorite charity.
Another variation on this theme is the disaster relief donation scam. An 
example of this scam occurred right after the 9/11/01 tragedy. The thieves 
set up a bogus Web site and then sent a spam e-mail soliciting $25 credit 
card donations to help the victims of 9/11 families. The e-mail had a link to 
the thief’s Web site, and the mail recipient clicked the link to enter the site to 
make a donation. The site asked, of course, for your credit card number and 
expiration date as well as your full name. Also, the site asked for your SSN 
under the guise that you can then claim the donation on your income tax as a 
deduction.
People who made the donation found themselves victims of identity theft. 
The perpetrators established new addresses and opened new accounts, 
using the names of the people who went to the site.
Other people were pressured into making on-the-spot donations over the 
phone, using the same tactics that the Web site thieves used to get personal 
information.
 
Don’t stop donating to charities — just don’t give out your personal 
information to strangers on the telephone. In most states, the charitable 
organizations must be registered with the state Attorney General, so check 
whether the charity is legitimate before you donate.
Bogus Invoices
This scam involves phony invoices made to look like the real thing. I’ve been 
getting a number of these bogus invoices in my e-mail account recently. 
This may be the new trend to garner personal information from you. I’ve 
also received some bogus invoices via U.S. mail. One of the telltale signs 
of a bogus invoice is the lack of a phone number for an alternative contact 
method.
In order to comply with U.S. Postal regulations, these solicitations are 
supposed to have the following wording on them. The following disclaimer is 
easy to spot in the e-mails, but I haven’t always seen the disclaimer.
“THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE UNDER NO 
OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU 
ACCEPT THIS OFFER.”

259
 Chapter 19: Ten (Plus One) Common Scams and How to Avoid Them
The wording is supposed to be near the top of the invoice in capital letters in 
bold type that is at least as large as the letters on the solicitation. Oftentimes 
the disclaimer is overlooked or misunderstood. The idea is to get you to pay 
for something you didn’t order. Sometimes the scam is used to solicit credit 
card information. 
Don’t respond to invoices that don’t have phone numbers on them. If you 
didn’t order what’s stated in the invoice, simply ignore it.
Phony Brokerage Firms
In the phony brokerage firm scam, the thieves set up a Web site using the 
name of an actual brokerage firm, but they use a different address. Then they 
craft and send a spam e-mail. The e-mail usually trumpets upcoming “hot” 
stock to entice you into visiting its Web site. On the site, you provide the 
usual personal information, credit card number, and other personal 
information to purchase the “stock.” At the time of this writing, it isn’t clear 
whether the scam is being perpetrated to garner personal information to be 
used in further frauds in identity theft or whether it’s collecting money for 
phony stocks.
In any event, don’t purchase stocks from unsolicited e-mails; it’s probably 
just a ruse to get your personal information, or it is not a good tip anyway. 
If you’re interested in buying stock, contact one of the brokerage firms near 
you and set up a face-to-face meeting in their office. 
Temporary Suspension of Your Account
The temporary suspension of your account scam is set up either in an e-mail 
or a telephone call. The thieves use the scare tactic that your bank account 
(or online payment or online auction account) has been suspended. The 
e-mail sender or phone caller claims that the bank is undertaking a review 
of all its accounts to eliminate waste and fraud. You’re then requested to 
visit the “company’s” Web site to provide the information necessary to do a 
review of your account and to make sure that the information on file is 
correct. The information asked for is the usual: full name, account number, 
ATM/debit card number, and PIN. The e-mail sender or phone caller goes 
on to say that if you don’t provide the information, your account will be 
permanently canceled.
You know what happens next! You become the victim of identity theft. So 
when in doubt, don’t provide the information. Contact your bank instead.

260
Part VII: The Part of Tens  
Job Scams
You probably receive several offers a week in your e-mail to work at home or 
as a shipping clerk or to transfer funds for various companies. These are 
usually scams. If you fall for them, you could lose money and put your 
personal information — such as your address, SSN, bank account number, 
and so on — into the wrong hands. Don’t apply for unsolicited job offers even 
if the e-mail states that your information was garnered from a job Web site.
Most of these bogus job scams suck you in with the promise of thousands 
for working a few hours a day from your home. Some of the job scams can 
land you in trouble with the law because the activities you’re asked to 
perform involve money laundering and repackaging of merchandise bought 
with stolen credit cards.
 
You can find out whether an e-mail job offer is a scam by going to www.
scambusters.org. That Web site describes numerous scams. You can 
search by the type of scam.
