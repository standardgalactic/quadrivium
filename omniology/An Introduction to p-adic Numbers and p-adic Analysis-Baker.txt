Introduction
These notes were written for a ﬁnal year undergraduate course which ran at Manchester
University in 1988/9 and also taught in later years by Dr M. McCrudden.
I rewrote them
in 2000 to make them available to interested graduate students. The approach taken is very
down to earth and makes few assumptions beyond standard undergraduate analysis and algebra.
Because of this the course was as self contained as possible, covering basic number theory and
analytic ideas which would probably be familiar to more advanced readers. The problem sets
are based on those for produced for the course.
I would like to thank Javier Diaz-Vargas for pointing out numerous errors.

CHAPTER 1
Congruences and modular equations
Let n ∈Z (we will usually have n > 0). We deﬁne the binary relation ≡
n by
Definition 1.1. If x, y ∈Z, then x ≡
n y if and only if n | (x −y). This is often also written
x ≡y (mod n) or x ≡y (n).
Notice that when n = 0, x ≡
n y if and only if x = y, so in that case ≡
0 is really just equality.
Proposition 1.2. The relation ≡
n is an equivalence relation on Z.
Proof. Let x, y, z ∈Z. Clearly ≡
n is reﬂexive since n | (x −x) = 0. It is symmetric since
if n | (x −y) then x −y = kn for some k ∈Z, hence y −x = (−k)n and so n | (y −x). For
transitivity, suppose that n | (x −y) and n | (y −z); then since x −z = (x −y) + (y −z) we
have n | (x −z).
□
We denote the equivalence class of x ∈Z by [x]n or just [x] if n is understood; it is also
common to use x for this if the value of n is clear from the context. By deﬁnition,
[x]n = {y ∈Z : y ≡
n x} = {y ∈Z : y = x + kn for some k ∈Z},
and there are exactly |n| such residue classes, namely
[0]n, [1]n, . . . , [n −1]n.
Of course we can replace these representatives by any others as required.
Definition 1.3. The set of all residue classes of Z modulo n is
Z/n = {[x]n : x = 0, 1, . . . , n −1}.
If n = 0 we interpret Z/0 as Z.
Consider the function
πn : Z −→Z/n;
πn(x) = [x]n.
This is onto and also satisﬁes
π−1
n (α) = {x ∈Z : x ∈α}.
We can deﬁne addition +
n and multiplication ×
n on Z/n by the formulæ
[x]n +
n [y]n = [x + y]n,
[x]n ×
n [y]n = [xy]n,
which are easily seen to be well deﬁned, i.e., they do not depend on the choice of representatives
x, y. The straightforward proof of our next result is left to the reader.

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
Proposition 1.4. The set Z/n with the operations +
n and ×
n is a commutative ring and the
function πn : Z −→Z/n is a ring homomorphism which is surjective (onto) and has kernel
ker πn = [0]n = {x ∈Z : x ≡
n 0}.
Now let us consider the structure of the ring Z/n.
The zero is 0 = [0]n and the unity
is 1 = [1]n.
We may also ask about units and zero divisors.
In the following, let R be a
commutative ring with unity 1.
Definition 1.5. An element u ∈R is a unit if there exists a v ∈R satisfying
uv = vu = 1.
Such a v is necessarily unique and is called the inverse of u and is usually denoted u−1.
Definition 1.6. z ∈R is a zero divisor if there exists at least one w ∈R with w ̸= 0 and
zw = 0. There may be lots of such w for each zero divisor z.
Notice that in any ring 0 is always a zero divisor since 1 · 0 = 0 = 0 · 1.
Example 1.7. Let n = 6; then Z/6 = {0, 1, . . . , 5}. The units are 1, 5 with 1−1 = 1 and
5−1 = 5 since 52 = 25 ≡
6 1. The zero divisors are 0, 2, 3, 4 since 2 ×
6 3 = 0.
In this example notice the the zero divisors all have a factor in common with 6; this is true
for all Z/n (see below). It is also true that for any ring, a zero divisor cannot be a unit (why?)
and a unit cannot be a zero divisor.
Recall that if a, b ∈Z then the highest common factor (hcf) of a and b is the largest positive
integer dividing both a and b. We often write gcd(a, b) for this.
Theorem 1.8. Let n > 0. Then Z/n is a disjoint union
Z/n = {units} ∪{zero divisors}
where {units} is the set of units in Z/n and {zero divisors} the set of zero divisors. Furthermore,
(a) z is a zero divisor if and only if gcd(z, n) > 1;
(b) u is a unit if and only if gcd(u, n) = 1.
Proof. If h = gcd(x, n) > 1 we have x = x0h and n = n0h, so
n0x ≡
n 0.
Hence x is a zero divisor in Z/n.
Let us prove (b). First we suppose that u is a unit; let v = u−1. Suppose that gcd(u, n) > 1.
Then uv ≡
n 1 and so for some integer k,
uv −1 = kn.
But then gcd(u, n) | 1, which is absurd. So gcd(u, n) = 1. Conversely, if gcd(u, n) = 1 we must
demonstrate that u is a unit. To do this we will need to make use of the Euclidean Algorithm.
Recollection 1.9. [Euclidean Property of the integers] Let a, b ∈Z with b ̸= 0; then there
exist unique q, r ∈Z for which a = qb + r with 0 ⩽r < |b|.

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
5
From this we can deduce
Theorem 1.10 (The Euclidean Algorithm). Let a, b ∈Z then there are unique sequences of
integers qi, ri satisfying
a = q1b + r1
r0 = b = q2r1 + r2
r1 = q3r2 + r3
...
0 ̸= rN−1 = qN+1rN
where we have 0 ⩽ri < ri−1 for each i. Furthermore, we have rN = gcd(a, b) and then by back
substitution for suitable s, t ∈Z we can write
rN = sa + tb.
Example 1.11. If a = 6, b = 5, then r0 = 5 and we have
6 = 1 · 5 + 1,
so q1 = 1, r1 = 1,
5 = 5 · 1,
so q2 = 5, r2 = 0.
Therefore we have gcd(6, 5) = 1 and we can write 1 = 1 · 6 + (−1) · 5.
Now we return to the proof of Theorem 1.8. Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we can write
su + tn = 1 for suitable s, t ∈Z. But then su ≡
n 1 and s = u−1, so u is indeed a unit in Z/n.
These proves part (b). But we also have part (a) as well since a zero divisor z cannot be a unit,
hence has to have gcd(z, n) > 1.
□
Theorem 1.8 allows us to determine the number of units and zero divisors in Z/n.
We
already have |Z/n| = n.
Definition 1.12. (Z/n)× is the set of units in Z/n. (Z/n)× becomes an abelian group
under the multiplication ×
n .
Let ϕ(n) = |(Z/n)×| = order of (Z/n)×. By Theorem 1.8, this number equals the number
of integers 0, 1, 2, . . . , n −1 which have no factor in common with n. The function ϕ is known
as the Euler ϕ-function.
Example 1.13. n = 6: |Z/6| = 6 and the units are 1, 5, hence ϕ(6) = 2.
Example 1.14. n = 12: |Z/12| = 12 and the units are 1, 5, 7, 11, hence ϕ(12) = 4.
In general ϕ(n) is quite a complicated function of n, however in the case where n = p, a
prime number, the answer is more straightforward.
Example 1.15. Let p be a prime (i.e., p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . .). Then the only non-trivial
factor of p is p itself-so ϕ(p) = p −1. We can say more: consider a power of p, say pr with
r > 0. Then the integers in the list 0, 1, 2, . . . , pr −1 which have a factor in common with pr
are precisely those of the form kp for 0 ⩽k ⩽pr−1 −1, hence there are pr−1 of these. So we
have ϕ(pr) = pr−1(p −1).

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
Example 1.16. When p = 2, we have the groups (Z/2)× = {1},
¡
Z/22¢× = {1, 3} ∼= Z/2,
¡
Z/23¢× = {1, 3, 5, 7} ∼= Z/2 × Z/2, and in general
¡
Z/2r+1¢× ∼= Z/2 × Z/2r−1
for any r ⩾1. Here the ﬁrst summand is {±1} and the second can be taken to be
­
3
®
.
Now for a general n we have
n = pr1
1 pr2
2 · · · prs
s
where for each i, pi is a prime with
2 ⩽p1 < p2 < · · · < ps
and ri ⩾1. Then the numbers pi, ri are uniquely determined by n. We can break down Z/n
into copies of Z/pri
i , each of which is simpler to understand.
Theorem 1.17. There is a unique isomorphism of rings
Φ: Z/n ∼= Z/pr1
1 × Z/pr2
2 × · · · × Z/prs
s
and an isomorphism of groups
Φ× : (Z/n)× ∼= (Z/pr1
1 )× × (Z/pr2
2 )× × · · · × (Z/prs
s )×.
Thus we have
ϕ(n) = ϕ(pr1
1 )ϕ(pr2
2 ) · · · ϕ(prs
s ).
Proof. Let a, b > 0 be coprime (i.e., gcd(a, b) = 1).
We will show that there is an
isomorphism of rings
Ψ: Z/ab ∼= Z/a × Z/b.
By Theorem 1.10, there are u, v ∈Z such that ua + vb = 1. It is easily checked that
gcd(a, v) = 1 = gcd(b, u).
Deﬁne a function
Ψ: Z/ab −→Z/a × Z/b;
Ψ([x]ab) = ([x]a, [x]b) .
This is easily seen to be a ring homomorphism. Notice that
|Z/ab| = ab = |Z/a||Z/b| = |Z/a × Z/b|
and so to show that Ψ is an isomorphism, it suﬃces to show that it is onto.
Let ([y]a, [z]b) ∈Z/a × Z/b. We must ﬁnd an x ∈Z such that Ψ ([x]ab) = ([y]a, [z]b). Now
set x = vby + uaz; then
x = (1 −ua)y + uaz ≡
a y,
x = vby + (1 −vb)z ≡
b z,
hence we have Ψ ([x]ab) = ([y]a, [z]b) as required.
To prove the result for general n we proceed by induction upon s.

Example 1.18. Consider the case n = 120. Then 120 = 8 · 3 · 5 = 23 · 3 · 5 and so the
Theorem predicts that
Z/120 ∼= Z/8 × Z/3 × Z/5.
We will verify this. First write 120 = 24 · 5. Then gcd(24, 5) = 1 since
24 = 4 · 5 + 4 =⇒4 = 24 −4 · 5
and
5 = 4 + 1 =⇒1 = 5 −4,
hence
1 = 5 · 5 −24.
Therefore we can take a = 24, b = 5, u = −1, v = 5 in the proof of the Theorem. Thus we have
a ring isomorphism
Ψ1 : Z/120 −→Z/24 × Z/5;
Ψ1 ([25y −24z]120) = ([y]24, [z]5) ,
as constructed in the proof above. Next we have to repeat this procedure for the ring Z/24.
Here we have
8 = 2 · 3 + 2 =⇒2 = 8 −2 · 3
and
3 = 2 + 1 =⇒1 = 3 −2,
so
gcd(8, 3) = 1 = (−8) + 3 · 3.
Hence there is an isomorphism of rings
Ψ2 : Z/24 −→Z/8 × Z/3;
Ψ2 ([9x −8y]24) = ([x]8, [y]3) ,
and we can of course combine these two isomorphisms to obtain a third, namely
Ψ: Z/120 −→Z/8 × Z/3 × Z/5;
Ψ ([25(9x −8y) −24z]120) = ([x]8, [y]3, [z]5) ,
as required. Notice that we have
Ψ−1 ([1]8, [1]3, [1]5) = [1]120,
which is always the case with this procedure.
We now move on to consider the subject of equations over Z/n. Consider the following
example.
Example 1.19. Let a, b ∈Z with n > 0. Then
(1.1)
ax ≡
n b
is a linear modular equation or linear congruence over Z.
We are interested in ﬁnding all
solutions of Equation (1.1) in Z, not just one solution.
If u ∈Z has the property that au ≡
n b then u is a solution; but then the integers of form
u + kn, k ∈Z are also solutions. Notice that there are an inﬁnite number of these. But each
such solution gives the same congruence class [u + kn]n = [u]n. We can equally well consider
(1.2)
[a]nX = [b]n
as a linear equation over Z/n. This time we look for all solutions of Equation (1.2) in Z/n and
as Z/n is itself ﬁnite, there are only a ﬁnite number of these. As we remarked above, any integer

8
1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
solution u of (1.1) gives rise to solution [u]n of (1.2); in fact many solutions of (1.1) give the
same solution of (1.2). Conversely, a solution [v]n of (1.2) generates the set
[v]n = {v + kn : k ∈Z}
of solutions of (1.1), so there is in fact an equivalence of these two problems.
Now let us attempt to solve (1.2), i.e., try to ﬁnd all solutions in Z/n. There are two cases:
(1) the element [a]n ∈Z/n is a unit;
(2) the element [a]n ∈Z/n is a zero divisor.
In case (1), let [c]n = [a]−1
n
be the inverse of [a]n. Then we can multiply (1.2) by [c]n to obtain
X = [bc]n
which has exactly the same solutions as (1.2) (why?).
Moreover, there is exactly one such
solution namely [bc]n! So we have completely solved equation (1.2) and found that X = [bc]n is
the unique solution in Z/n.
What does this say about (1.1)? There is certainly an inﬁnity of solutions, namely the
integers of form bc+kn, k ∈Z. But any given solution u must satisfy [u]n = [bc]n in Z/n, hence
u ≡
n bc and so u is of this form. So the solutions of (1.1) are precisely the integers this form.
So in case (1) of (1.2) we have exactly one solution in Z/n,
X = [a]−1
n [b]n
and (1.1) then has the integers cb + kn as solutions.
In case (2) there may be solutions of (1.2) or none at all. For example, the equation
nx ≡
n 1,
can only have a solution in Z if n = 1. There is also the possibility of multiple solutions in Z/n,
as is shown by the example
2x ≡
12 4.
By inspection, this is seen to have solutions 2, 8. Notice that this congruence can also be solved
by reducing it to
x ≡
6 2,
since if 2(x −2) ≡
12 0 then x −2 ≡
6 0, which is an example of case (1) again.
So if [a]n is not a unit, uniqueness is also lost as well as the guarantee of any solutions.
We can more generally consider a system of linear equations
a1x ≡
n1 b1,
a2x ≡
n2 b2,
...
akx ≡
nk bk,

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
9
where we are now trying to ﬁnd all integers x ∈Z which simultaneously satisfy these congru-
ences. The main result on this situation is the following:
Theorem 1.20 (The Chinese Remainder Theorem). Let n1, n2, . . . , nk be a sequence of
coprime integers, a1, a2, . . . , ak a sequence of integers satisfying gcd(ai, ni) = 1 and b1, b2, . . . , bk
be sequence of integers. Then the system of simultaneous linear congruences equations
a1x ≡
n1 b1,
a2x ≡
n2 b2,
...
akx ≡
nk bk,
has an inﬁnite number of solutions x ∈Z which form a unique congruence class
[x]n1n2···nk ∈Z/n1n2 · · · nk.
Proof. The proof uses the isomorphism
Z/ab ∼= Z/a × Z/b
for gcd(a, b) = 1 as proved in the proof of Theorem 1.17, together with an induction on k.
□
Example 1.21. Consider the system
3x ≡
2 5,
2x ≡
3 6,
7x ≡
5 1.
Since 8 ≡
5 3, this system is equivalent to
x ≡
2 1,
x ≡
3 0,
x ≡
5 3.
Solving the ﬁrst two equations in Z/6, we obtain the unique solution x ≡
6 3. Solving the simul-
taneous pair of congruences
x ≡
6 3,
x ≡
5 3,
we obtain the unique solution x ≡
30 3 in Z/30.
Theorem 1.17 is often used to solve polynomial equations modulo n, by ﬁrst splitting n into
a product of prime powers, say n = pr1
1 pr2
2 · · · prd
d , and then solving modulo prk
k for each k.
Theorem 1.22. Let n = pr1
1 pr2
2 · · · prd
d , where the pk’s are distinct primes with each rk ⩾1.
Let f(X) ∈Z[X] be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Then the equation
f(x) ≡
n 0

10
1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
has a solution if and only if the equations
f(x1) ≡
pr1
1
0,
f(x2) ≡
pr2
2
0,
...
f(xd) ≡
p
rd
d
0,
all have solutions. Moreover, each sequence of solutions in Z/prk
k
of the latter gives rise to a
unique solution x ∈Z/n of f(x) ≡
n 0 satisfying
x ≡
p
rk
k
xk
∀k.
Example 1.23. Solve x2 −1 ≡
24 0.
We have 24 = 8 · 3, so we will try to solve the pair of congruences equations
x2
1 −1 ≡
8 0,
x2
2 −1 ≡
3 0,
with x1 ∈Z/8, x2 ∈Z/3. Now clearly the solutions of the ﬁrst equation are x1 ≡
8 1, 3, 5, 7; for
the second we get x2 ≡
3 1, 2. Combining these using Theorem 1.17, we obtain
x ≡
24 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.
The moral of this is that we only need worry about Z/pr where p is a prime. We now
consider this case in detail.
Firstly, we will study the case r = 1. Now Z/p is a ﬁeld, i.e., every non-zero element has an
inverse (it’s a good exercise to prove this yourself if you’ve forgotten this result). Then we have
Proposition 1.24. Let K be a ﬁeld, and f(X) ∈K[X] be a polynomial with coeﬃcients in
K. Then for α ∈K,
f(α) = 0
⇐⇒
f(X) = (X −α)g(X)
for some g(X) ∈K[X].
Proof. This is a standard result in basic ring theory.
□
Corollary 1.25. Under the hypotheses of Proposition 1.24, assume that d = deg f. Then
f(X) has at most d distinct roots in K.
As a particular case, consider the ﬁeld Z/p, where p is a prime, and the polynomials
Xp −X, Xp−1 −1 ∈Z/p[X].
Theorem 1.26 (Fermat’s Little Theorem). For any a ∈Z/p, either a = 0 or (a)p−1 = 1
(so in the latter case a is a (p −1) st root of 1). Hence,
Xp −X = X(X −1)(X −2) · · · (X −p −1).
Corollary 1.27 (Wilson’s Theorem). For any prime p we have
(p −1)! ≡−1
(mod p).

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
11
We also have the more subtle
Theorem 1.28 (Gauss’s Primitive Root Theorem). For any prime p, the group (Z/p)× is
cyclic of order p −1. Hence there is an element a ∈Z/p of order p −1.
The proof of this uses for example the structure theorem for ﬁnitely generated abelian
groups. A generator of (Z/p)× is called a primitive root modulo p and there are exactly ϕ(p−1)
of these in (Z/p)×.
Example 1.29. Take p = 7. Then ϕ(6) = ϕ(2)ϕ(3) = 2, so there are two primitive roots
modulo 7. We have
23 ≡
7 1, 32 ≡
7 2, 36 ≡
7 1,
hence 3 is one primitive root, the other must be 35 = 5.
One advantage of working with a ﬁeld K is that all of basic linear algebra works just as well
over K. For instance, we can solve systems of simultaneous linear equations in the usual way
by Gaussian elimination.
Example 1.30. Take p = 11 and solve the system of simultaneous equations
3x + 2y −3z ≡
11 1,
2x
+ z ≡
11 0,
i.e., ﬁnd all solutions with x, y, z ∈Z/11.
Here we can multiply the ﬁrst equation by 3−1 = 4, obtaining
x + 8y −1z ≡
11 4,
2x
+ z ≡
11 0,
and then subtract twice this from the second to obtain
x + 8y −1z ≡
11 4,
6y + 3z ≡
11 3,
and we know that the rank of this system is 2. The general solution is
x ≡
11 5t,
y ≡
11 5t + 6,
z ≡
11 t,
for t ∈Z.
Now consider a polynomial f(X) ∈Z[X], say
f(X) =
d
X
k=0
akXk.
Suppose we want to solve the equation
f(x) ≡
pr 0

12
1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
for some r ⩾1 and let’s assume that we already have a solution x1 ∈Z which works modulo p,
i.e., we have
f(x1) ≡
p 0.
Can we ﬁnd an integer x2 such that
f(x2) ≡
p2 0
and x2 ≡
p x1? More generally we would like to ﬁnd an integer xr such that
f(xr) ≡
pr 0
and xr ≡
p x1? Such an xr is called a lift of x1 modulo pr.
Example 1.31. Take p = 5 and f(X) = X2+1. Then there are two distinct roots modulo 5,
namely 2, 3. Let’s try to ﬁnd a root modulo 25 and agreeing with 2 modulo 5. Try 2 + 5t where
t = 0, 1, . . . , 4. Then we need
(2 + 5t)2 + 1 ≡
25 0,
or equivalently
20t + 5 ≡
25 0,
which has the solution
t ≡
5 1.
Similarly, we have t ≡
5 3 as a lift of 3.
Example 1.32. Obtain lifts of 2, 3 modulo 625.
The next result is the simplest version of what is usually referred to as Hensel’s Lemma.
In various guises this is an important result whose proof is inspired by the proof of Newton’s
Method from Numerical Analysis.
Theorem 1.33 (Hensel’s Lemma: ﬁrst version). Let f(X) = Pd
k=0 akXk ∈Z[X]and suppose
that x ∈Z is a root of f modulo ps (with s ⩾1) and that f′(x) is a unit modulo p. Then there
is a unique root x′ ∈Z/ps+1 of f modulo ps+1 satisfying x′ ≡
ps x; moreover, x′ is given by the
formula
x′ ≡
ps+1 x −uf(x),
where u ∈Z satisﬁes uf′(x) ≡
p 1, i.e., u is an inverse for f′(x) modulo p.
Proof. We have
f(x) ≡
ps 0,
f′(x) ̸≡
p 0,
so there is such a u ∈Z. Now consider the polynomial f(x + Tps) ∈Z[T]. Then
f(x + Tps) ≡f(x) + f′(x)Tps + · · ·
(mod (Tps)2)
by the usual version of Taylor’s expansion for a polynomial over Z. Hence, for any t ∈Z,
f(x + tps) ≡f(x) + f′(x)tps + · · ·
(mod p2s).
An easy calculation now shows that
f(x + tps) ≡
ps+1 0
⇐⇒
t ≡
p −uf(x)/ps.

Example 1.34. Let p be an odd prime and let f(X) = Xp−1 −1. Then Gauss’s Primitive
Root Theorem 1.28, we have exactly p−1 distinct (p−1) st roots of 1 modulo p; let α = a ∈Z/p
be any one of these. Then f′(X) ≡
p −Xp−2 and so f′(α) ̸= 0 and we can apply Theorem 1.33.
Hence there is a unique lift of a modulo p2, say a2, agreeing with a1 = a modulo p. So the
reduction function
ρ1 :
¡
Z/p2¢× −→(Z/p)×;
ρ1(b) = b
must be a group homomorphism which is onto. So for each such α1 = α, there is a unique
element α2 ∈Z/p2 satisfying αp−1
2
= 1 and therefore the group
¡
Z/p2¢× contains a unique
cyclic subgroup of order p −1 which ρ1 maps isomorphically to (Z/p)×. As we earlier showed
that |Z/p2| has order (p −1)p, this means that there is an isomorphism of groups
¡
Z/p2¢× ∼= (Z/p)× × Z/p,
by standard results on abelian groups.
We can repeat this process to construct a unique sequence of integers a1, a2, . . . satisfying
ak ≡
pk ak+1 and ap−1
k
≡
pk 1. We can also deduce that the reduction homomorphisms
ρk :
³
Z/pk+1´×
−→
³
Z/pk´×
are all onto and there are isomorphisms
³
Z/pk+1´× ∼= (Z/p)× × Z/pk.
The case p = 2 is similar only this time we only have a single root of X2−1 −1 modulo 2 and
obtain the isomorphisms
(Z/2)× = 0,
(Z/4)× ∼= Z/2,
(Z/2s)× ∼= Z/2 × Z/2s−2
if s ⩾2.
It is also possible to do examples involving multivariable systems of simultaneous equations
using a more general version of Hensel’s Lemma.
Theorem 1.35 (Hensel’s Lemma: many variables and functions). Let
fj(X1, X2, . . . , Xn) ∈Z[X1, X2, . . . , Xn]
for 1 ⩽j ⩽m be a collection of polynomials and set f = (fj). Let a = (a1, . . . , an) ∈Zn be a
solution of f modulo pk. Suppose that the m × n derivative matrix
Df(a) =
µ ∂fj
∂Xi
(a)
¶
has full rank when considered as a matrix deﬁned over Z/p. Then there is a solution a′ =
(a′
1, . . . , a′
n) ∈Zn of f modulo pk+1 satisfying a′ ≡
pk a.
Example 1.36. For each of the values k = 1, 2, 3, solve the simultaneous system
f(X, Y, Z) = 3X2 + Y ≡
2k 1,
g(X, Y, Z) = XY + Y Z ≡
2k 0.
Finally we state a version of Hensel’s Lemma that applies under slightly more general con-
ditions than the above and will be of importance later.

1. CONGRUENCES AND MODULAR EQUATIONS
Theorem 1.37 (Hensel’s Lemma: General Version). Let f(X) ∈Z[X], r ⩾1 and a ∈Z,
satisfy the equations
f(a) ≡
p2r−1 0,
(a)
f′(a) ̸≡
pr 0.
(b)
Then there exists a′ ∈Z such that
f(a′) ≡
p2r+1 0
and
a′ ≡
pr a.

CHAPTER 2
The p-adic norm and the p-adic numbers
Let R be a ring with unity 1 = 1R.
Definition 2.1. A function
N : R −→R+ = {r ∈R : r ⩾0}
is called a norm on R if the following are true:
(Na) N(x) = 0 if and only if x = 0;
(Nb) N(xy) = N(x)N(y)
∀x, y ∈R;
(Nc) N(x + y) ⩽N(x) + N(y)
∀x, y ∈R.
(Nc) is called the triangle inequality. The norm N is called non-Archimedean if (Nc) can be
replaced by the stronger statement, the ultrametric inequality:
(Nd) N(x + y) ⩽max{N(x), N(y)}
∀x, y ∈R.
If (Nd) is not true then the norm N is said to be Archimedean.
Exercise: Show that for a non-Archimedean norm N, (Nd) can be strengthened to
(Nd′) N(x + y) ⩽max{N(x), N(y)}
∀x, y ∈R with equality if N(x) ̸= N(y).
Example 2.2. (i) Let R ⊆C be a subring of the complex numbers C.
Then setting
N(x) = |x|, the usual absolute value, gives a norm on R. In particular, this applies to the cases
R = Z, Q, R, C. This norm is Archimedean because of the inequality
|1 + 1| = 2 > |1| = 1.
(ii) Let
C(I) = {f : I −→R : f continuous},
where I = [0, 1] is the unit interval. Then the function |f|(x) = |f(x)| is continuous for any
f ∈C(I) and hence by basic analysis,
∃xf ∈I
such that
|f|(xf) = sup{|f|(x) : x ∈I}.
Hence we can deﬁne a function
N : C(I) −→R+;
N(f) = |f|(xf),
which turns out to be an Archimedean norm on C(I), usually called the supremum norm. This
works upon replacing I by any compact set X ⊆C.
Consider the case of R = Q, the ring of rational numbers a/b, where a, b ∈Z and b ̸= 0.
Suppose that p ⩾2 is a prime number.
15

16
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
Definition 2.3. If 0 ̸= x ∈Z, the p-adic ordinal (or valuation) of x is
ordp x = max{r : pr|x} ⩾0.
For a/b ∈Q, the p-adic ordinal of a/b
ordp
a
b = ordp a −ordp b.
Notice that in all cases, ordp gives an integer and that for a rational a/b, the value of ordp a/b
is well deﬁned, i.e., if a/b = a′/b′ then
ordp a −ordp b = ordp a′ −ordp b′.
We also introduce the convention that ordp 0 = ∞.
Proposition 2.4. If x, y ∈Q, the ordp has the following properties:
(a) ordp x = ∞if and only if x = 0;
(b) ordp(xy) = ordp x + ordp y;
(c) ordp(x + y) ⩾min{ordp x, ordp y} with equality if ordp x ̸= ordp y.
Proof. (a) and (b) are easy and left to the reader; we will therefore only prove (c). Let
x, y be non-zero rational numbers. Write
x = pr a
b
and
y = ps c
d
where a, b, c, d ∈Z with p ∤a, b, c, d and r, s ∈Z. Now if r = s, we have
x + y = pr ³a
b + c
d
´
= pr (ad + bc)
bd
which gives ordp(x + y) ⩾r since p ∤bd.
Now suppose that r ̸= s, say s > r. Then
x + y = pr ³a
b + ps−r c
d
´
= pr (ad + ps−rbc)
bd
.
Notice that as s −r > 0 and p ∤ad, then
ordp(x + y) = r = min{ordp x, ordp y}.
The argument for the case where at least one of the terms is 0 is left as an exercise.
□
Definition 2.5. For x ∈Q, let the p-adic norm of x be given by
|x|p =



p−ordp x
if x ̸= 0,
p−∞= 0
if x = 0.
Proposition 2.6. The function | |p : Q −→R+ has the properties
(a) |x|p = 0 if and only if x = 0;
(b) |xy|p = |x|p|y|p;
(c) |x + y|p ⩽max{|x|p, |y|p} with equality if |x|p ̸= |y|p.

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
17
Hence, | |p is a non-Archimedean norm on Q.
Proof. This follows easily from Proposition 2.4.
□
Now consider a general norm N on a ring R.
Definition 2.7. The distance between x, y ∈R with respect to N is
dN(x, y) = N(x −y) ∈R+.
It easily follows from the properties of a norm that
dN(x, y) = 0
if and only if
x = y;
(Da)
dN(x, y) = dN(y, x)∀x, y ∈R;
(Db)
dN(x, y) ⩽dN(x, z) + dN(z, y)
if z ∈R is a third element.
(Dc)
Moreover, if N is non-Archimedean, then the second property is replaced by
dN(x, y) ⩽max{dN(x, z), dN(z, y)}
with equality if dN(x, z) ̸= dN(z, y).
(Dd)
Proposition 2.8 (The Isosceles Triangle Principle). Let N be a non-Archimedean norm on
a ring R. Let x, y, z ∈R be such that dN(x, y) ̸= dN(x, z). Then
dN(x, z) = max{dN(x, y), dN(x, z)}.
Hence, every triangle is isosceles in the non-Archimedean world.
Proof. Use (Dd) above.
□
Now let (an)n>1 be a sequence of elements of R, a ring with norm N.
Definition 2.9. The sequence (an) tends to the limit a ∈R with respect to N if
∀ε > 0∃M ∈N
such that
n > M =⇒N(a −an) = dN(a, an) < ε.
We use the notation
lim
n→∞
(N)an = a
which is reminiscent of the notation in Analysis and also keeps the norm in mind.
Definition 2.10. The sequence (an) is Cauchy with respect to N if
∀ε > 0∃M ∈N
such that
m, n > M =⇒N(am −an) = dN(am, an) < ε.
Proposition 2.11. If lim
n→∞
(N)an exists, then (an) is Cauchy with respect to N.
Proof. Let a = lim
n→∞
(N)an. Then we can ﬁnd a M1 such that
n > M1 =⇒N(a −an) < ε
2.
If m, n > M1, then N(a −am) < ε/2 and N(a −an) < ε/2, hence we obtain
N(am −an) = N ((am −a) + (a −an))
⩽N(am −a) + N(a −an)
< ε
2 + ε
2 = ε
by making use of the inequality from (Nc).
□

18
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
Exercise: Show that in the case where N is non-Archimedean, the inequality
N(am −an) < ε
2
holds in this proof.
Consider the case of R = Q, the rational numbers, with the p-adic norm | |p.
Example 2.12. Take the sequence an = 1 + p + p2 + · · · + pn−1. Then we have
|an+k −an|p =
¯¯¯pn + pn+1 + · · · + pn+k−1¯¯¯
p
= 1
pn .
For each ε > 0, we can choose an M for which pM ⩾1/ε, so if n > M we have
|an+k −an|p <
1
pM ⩽ε.
This shows that (an) is Cauchy.
In fact, this sequence has a limit with respect to | |p. Take a = 1/(1 −p) ∈Q; then we have
an = (pn −1)/(p −1), hence
¯¯¯¯an −
1
(1 −p)
¯¯¯¯
p
=
¯¯¯¯
pn
(p −1)
¯¯¯¯
p
= 1
pn .
So for ε > 0, we have
¯¯¯¯an −
1
(1 −p)
¯¯¯¯
p
< ε
whenever n > M (as above).
From now on we will write lim
n→∞
(p) in place of lim
n→∞
(N). So in the last example, we have
lim
n→∞
(p)(1 + p + · · · + pn−1) =
1
(1 −p).
Again consider a general norm N on a ring R.
Definition 2.13. A sequence (an) is called a null sequence if
lim
n→∞
(N)an = 0.
Of course this assumes the limit exists! This is easily seen to be equivalent to the the fact that
in the real numbers with the usual norm | |,
lim
n−→∞N(an) = 0.
Example 2.14. In the ring Q together with p-adic norm | |p, we have an = pn. Then
|pn|p = 1
pn −→0
as n −→∞
so lim
n→∞
(p)an = 0. Hence this sequence is null with respect to the p-adic norm.

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
19
Example 2.15. Use the same norm as in Example 2.14 with an = (1 + p)pn −1. Then for
n = 1,
|an|p = |(1 + p)p −1|p
=
¯¯¯¯
µp

p

p2 ,
since for 1 ⩽k ⩽p −1,
ordp

¶
= 1.
Hence |a1|p = 1/p2.
For general n, we proceed by induction upon n, and show that
|an|p =
1
pn+1 .
Hence we see that as n −→∞, |an|p −→0, so this sequence is null with respect to the p-adic
norm | |p.
Example 2.16. R = Q, N = | |, the usual norm. Consider the sequence (an) whose n-th
term is the decimal expansion of
√
2 up to the n-th decimal place, i.e., a1 = 1.4, a2 = 1.41, a3 =
1.414, . . .. Then it is well known that
√
2 is not a rational number although it is real, but (an)
is a Cauchy sequence.
The last example shows that there may be holes in a normed ring, i.e., limits of Cauchy
sequences need not exist. The real numbers can be thought of as the rational numbers with all
the missing limits put in. We will develop this idea next.
Let R be a ring with a norm N. Deﬁne the following two sets:
CS(R, N) = set of Cauchy sequences in R with respect to N;
Null(R, N) = set of null sequences in R with respect to N.
So the elements of CS(R, N) are Cauchy sequences (an) in R, and the elements of Null(R, N)
are null sequences (an). Notice that
Null(R, N) ⊆CS(R, N).
We can add and multiply the elements of CS(R, N), using the formulae
(an) + (bn) = (an + bn),
(an) × (bn) = (anbn),
since it is easily checked that these binary operations are functions of the form
+, ×: CS(R, N) × CS(R, N) −→CS(R, N).
Claim: The elements 0CS = (0), 1CS = (1R) together with these operations turn CS(R, N) into
a ring (commutative if R is) with zero 0CS and unity 1CS. Moreover, the subset Null(R, N) is

20
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
a two sided ideal of CS(R, N), since if (an) ∈CS(R, N) and (bn) ∈Null(R, N), then
(anbn), (bnan) ∈Null(R, N)
as can be seen by calculating lim
n→∞
(N)anbn and lim
n→∞
(N)bnan.
We can then deﬁne the quotient ring CS(R, N)/ Null(R, N); this is called the completion of
R with respect to the norm N, and is denoted bRN or just ˆR if the norm is clear. We write {an}
for the coset of the Cauchy sequence (an). The zero and unity are of course {0R} and {1R}
respectively. The norm N can be extended to bRN as the following important result shows.
Theorem 2.17. The ring bRN has sum + and product × given by
{an} + {bn} = {an + bn},
{an} × {bn} = {anbn},
and is commutative if R is. Moreover, there is a unique norm ˆN on bRN satisfying ˆN({a}) =
N(a) for a constant Cauchy sequence (an) = (a) with a ∈R; this norm is deﬁned by
ˆN({cn}) =
lim
n−→∞N(cn)
as a limit in the real numbers R. Finally, ˆN is non-Archimedean if and only if N is.
Proof. We will ﬁrst verify that ˆN is a norm. Let {an} ∈ˆR. We should check that the
deﬁnition of ˆN({an}) makes sense. For each ε > 0, we have an M such that whenever m, n > M
then N(am, an) < ε. To proceed further we need to use an inequality.
Claim:
|N(x) −N(y)| ⩽N(x −y)
for all x, y ∈R.
Proof. By (Nc),
N(x) = N ((x −y) + y) ⩽N(x −y) + N(y)
implying
N(x) −N(y) ⩽N(x −y).
Similarly,
N(y) −N(x) ⩽N(y −x).
Since N(−z) = N(z) for all z ∈R (why?), we have
|N(x) −N(y)| ⩽N(x −y).
□
This result tells us that for ε > 0, there is an M for which whenever m, n > M we have
|N(am) −N(an)| < ε,
which shows that the sequence of real numbers (N(an)) is a Cauchy sequence with respect to
the usual norm | |. By basic Analysis, we know it has a limit, say
ℓ= lim
n→∞N(an).
Hence, there is an M′ such that M′ < n implies that
|ℓ−N(an)| < ε.
So we have shown that ˆN({an}) = ℓis deﬁned.

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
21
We have
ˆN({an}) = 0
⇐⇒
lim
n→∞N(an) = 0
⇐⇒
(an)
is a null sequence
⇐⇒
{an} = 0,
proving (Nc). Also, given {an} and {bn}, we have
ˆN({an}{bn}) = ˆN({anbn}) = lim
n→∞N(anbn)
= lim
n→∞N(an)N(bn)
= lim
n→∞N(an) lim
n→∞N(bn)
= ˆN({an}) ˆN({bn}),
which proves (Nb). Finally,
ˆN({an} + {bn}) = lim
n→∞N(an + bn)
⩽lim
n→∞(N(an) + N(bn))
= lim
n→∞N(an) + lim
n→∞N(bn)
= ˆN({an}) + ˆN({bn}),
which gives (Nc).
Thus ˆN is certainly a norm.
We still have to show that if N is non-
Archimedean then so is ˆN. We will use the following important Lemma.
Lemma 2.18. Let R be a ring with a non-Archimedean norm N. Suppose that (an) is a
Cauchy sequence and that b ∈R has the property that b ̸= lim
n→∞
(N)an. Then there is an M such
that for all m, n > M,
N(am −b) = N(an −b),
so the sequence of real numbers (N(an −b)) is eventually constant. In particular, if (an) is not
a null sequence, then the sequence (N(an)) is eventually constant.
Proof. Notice that
|N(am −b) −N(an −b)| ⩽N(am −an),
so (N(an −b)) is Cauchy in R. Let ℓ= limn→∞N(an −b); notice also that ℓ> 0. Hence there
exists an M1 such that n > M1 implies
N(an −b) > ℓ
2.
Also, there exists an M2 such that m, n > M2 implies
N(am −an) < ℓ
2

22
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
since (an) is Cauchy with respect to N. Now take M = max{M1, M2} and consider m, n > M.
Then
N(am −b) = N ((an −b) + (am −an))
= max{N(an −b), N(am −an)}
= N(an −b)
since N(an −b) > ℓ/2 and N(am −an) < ℓ/2.
□
Let us return to the proof of Theorem 2.17. Let {an}, {bn} have the property that
ˆN({am}) ̸= ˆN({bm});
furthermore, we can assume that neither of these is {0} since otherwise the inequality in (Nd)
is trivial to verify. By the Lemma with b = 0 we can ﬁnd integers M′, M′′ such that
n > M′ =⇒N(an) = ˆN({an})
and
n > M′ =⇒N(bn) = ˆN({bn}).
Thus for n > max{M′, M′′}, we have
N(an + bn) = max{N(an), N(bn)}
= max{ ˆN({an}), ˆN({bn})}.
This proves (Nd) for ˆN and completes the proof of Theorem 2.17.
□
Definition 2.19. A ring with norm N is complete with respect to the norm N if every
Cauchy sequence has a limit in R with respect to N.
Example 2.20. The ring of real numbers (resp. complex numbers) is complete with respect
to the usual norm | |.
Definition 2.21. Let R be a ring with norm N, and let X ⊆R; then X is dense in R if
every element of R is a limit (with respect to N) of elements of X.
Theorem 2.22. Let R be a ring with norm N. Then ˆR is complete with respect to ˆN.
Moreover, R can be identiﬁed with a dense subring of ˆR.
Proof. First observe that for a ∈R, the constant sequence (an) = (a) is Cauchy and so
we obtain the element {a} in ˆR; this allows us to embed R as a subring of ˆR (it is necessary
to verify that the inclusion R ,→ˆR preserves sums and products). We will identify R with its
image without further comment; thus we will often use a ∈R to denote the element {a} ∈ˆR.
It is easy to verify that if (an) is a Cauchy sequence in R with respect to N, then (an) is also a
Cauchy sequence in ˆR with respect to ˆN. Of course it may not have a limit in R, but it always
has a limit in ˆR, namely the element {an} by deﬁnition of ˆR.

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
23
Now suppose that (αn) is Cauchy sequence in ˆR with respect to the norm ˆN. Then we must
show that there is an element α ∈ˆR for which
(2.1)
lim
n→∞
( ˆ
N)αn = α.
Notice that each αm is in fact the equivalence class of a Cauchy sequence (amn) in R with
respect to the norm N, hence if we consider each amn as an element of ˆR as above, we can write
(2.2)
αm = lim
n→∞
( ˆ
N)amn.
We need to construct a Cauchy sequence (cn) in R with respect to N such that
{cn} = lim
m→∞
( ˆ
N)αm.
Then α = {cn} is the required limit of (αn).
Now for each m, by Equation (2.2) there is an Mm such that whenever n > Mm,
ˆN(αm −amn) < 1
m.
For each m we now choose an integer k(m) > Mm; we can even assume that these integers are
strictly increasing, hence
k(1) < k(2) < · · · < k(m) < · · · .
We deﬁne our sequence (cn) by setting cn = an k(n). We must show it has the required properties.
Lemma 2.23. (cn) is Cauchy with respect to N and hence ˆN.
Proof. Let ε > 0. As (αn) is Cauchy there is an M′ such that if n1, n2 > M′ then
ˆN(αn1 −αn2) < ε
3;
thus
ˆN(cn1 −cn2) = ˆN
¡
(an1 k(n1) −αn1) + (αn1 −αn2) + (αn2 −an2 k(n2))
¢
⩽ˆN(an1 k(n1) −αn1) + ˆN(αn1 −αn2) + ˆN(αn2 −an2 k(n2)).
If we now choose M = max{M′, 3/ε}, then for n1, n2 > M, we have
ˆN(cn1 −cn2) < ε
3 + ε
3 + ε
3 = ε,
and so the sequence (cn) is indeed Cauchy.
□
Lemma 2.24.
lim
m→∞
( ˆ
N)αm = {cn}.
Proof. Let ε > 0. Then denoting {cn} by γ we have
ˆN(γ −αm) = ˆN
¡
(γ −am k(m)) + (am k(m) −αm)
¢
⩽ˆN(γ −am k(m)) + ˆN(am k(m) −αm)
= lim
n→∞N(an k(n) −am k(m)) + ˆN(am k(m) −αm).
Next choose M′′ so that M′′ ⩾2/ε and whenever n1, n2 > M′′ then
N(an1 k(n1) −an2 k(n2)) < ε
2.

24
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
So for m, n > M′′ we have
N(am k(m) −an k(n)) + ˆN(am k(m) −αm) < ε
2 + ε
2 = ε.
Hence we see that
ˆN(γ −αm) < ε
∀m > M′′.
□
Lemmas 2.23 and 2.24 complete the proof of Theorem 2.22.
□
We will now focus attention upon the case of R = Q equipped with the p-adic norm N = | |p
for a prime p.
Definition 2.25. The ring of p-adic numbers is the completion ˆQ of Q with respect to
N = | |p; we will denote it Qp. The norm on Qp will be denoted | |p.
Definition 2.26. The unit disc about 0 ∈Qp is the set of p-adic integers,
Zp = {α ∈Qp : |α|p ⩽1}.
Proposition 2.27. The set of p-adic integers Zp is a subring of Qp. Every element of Zp
is the limit of a sequence of (non-negative) integers and conversely, every Cauchy sequence in
Q consisting of integers has a limit in Zp.
Proof. Let α, β ∈Zp. Then
|α + β|p ⩽max{|α|p, |β|p} ⩽1
and hence α + β ∈Zp. Similarly, αβ ∈Zp by (Nb). Thus Zp is a subring of Qp.
From the deﬁnition of Qp, we have that if α ∈Zp, then α = {an} with an ∈Q and the
sequence (an) being Cauchy. By Lemma 2.18, we know that for some M, if n > M then |an|p = c
for some constant c ∈Q. But then we have |α|p = c and so c ⩽1. So without loss of generality,
we can assume that |an|p ⩽1 for all n. Now write an = rn/sn with rn, sn ∈Z and sn ̸= 0. Then
we can assume sn ̸≡
p 0 as ordp rn −ordp sn ⩾0. But this means that for each m we can solve the
equation snx ≡
pm 1 in Z (see Chapter 1), so let unm ∈Z satisfy snunm ≡
pm 1. We can even assume
that 1 ⩽unm ⩽pm −1 by adding on multiples of pm if necessary. Thus for each m we have
|snunm −1|p ⩽1
pm .
Then ﬁnd for each m,

Now for each m, there is an km for which

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
25
Hence
lim
n→∞
(p)(α −rknukn (n+1)) = 0,
showing that α is a limit of non-negative integers as required.
□
Now we will describe the elements of Qp explicitly, using the p-adic digit expansion. We will
begin with elements of Zp. So suppose that α ∈Zp. By Proposition 2.27 we know that there is
an integer α0 satisfying the conditions
|α0 −α|p < 1,
0 ⩽α0 ⩽(p −1).
The p-adic integer α −α0 has norm ⩽1/p and so the p-adic number (α −α0)/p is in Zp.
Repeating the last step, we obtain an integer α1 satisfying
|α −(α0 + α1p)|p < 1
p,
0 ⩽α1 ⩽(p −1).
Again repeating this, we ﬁnd a sequence of integers αn for which
|α −(α0 + α1p + · · · + αnpn))|p < 1
pn ,
0 ⩽αn ⩽(p −1).
The sequence (βn) for which
βn = α0 + α1p + · · · + αnpn
is Cauchy with respect to | |p. Moreover its limit is α since
|α −βn|p < 1
pn .
So we have an expansion
α = α0 + α1p + α2p2 + · · ·
reminiscent of the decimal expansion of a real number but with possibly inﬁnitely many positive
powers of p. This is the (standard) p-adic expansion of α ∈Zp and the αn are known as the
(standard) p-adic digits.
It has one subtle diﬀerence from the decimal expansion of a real
number, namely it is unique. To see this, suppose that
α = α′
0 + α′
1p + α′
2p2 + · · ·
is a second such expansion with the properties of the ﬁrst.
Let d be the ﬁrst integer for
which αd ̸= α′
d.
Then we can assume without loss of generality that αd < α′
d and hence
1 ⩽α′
d −αd ⩽(p −1). If
β′
n = α′
0 + α′
1p + · · · + α′
npn,
then
β′
d −βd = (α′
d −αd)pd,
hence
¯¯β′
d −βd
¯¯
p = 1
pd .

26
2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
Notice that
¯¯β′
d −βd
¯¯
p =
¯¯(β′
d −α) + (α −βd)
¯¯
p
⩽max{
¯¯β′
d −α
¯¯
p, |α −βd|p}
< 1
pd ,
which clearly contradicts the last equality. So no such d can exist and there is only one such
expansion.
Now let α ∈Qp be any p-adic number. If |α|p ⩽1, we have already seen how to ﬁnd its
p-adic expansion. If |α|p > 1, suppose |α|p = pk with k > 0. Consider β = pkα, which has
|β|p = 1; this has a p-adic expansion
β = β0 + β1p + β2p2 + · · ·
as above. Then
α = β0
pk +
β1
pk−1 + · · · + βk−1
p
+ βk + βk+1p + · · · + βk+rpr + · · ·
with 0 ⩽βn ⩽(p −1) for each n.
Our discussion has established the following important result.
Theorem 2.28. Every p-adic number α ∈Qp has a unique p-adic expansion
α = α−rp−r + α1−rp1−r + α2−rp2−r + · · · + α−1p−1 + α0 + α1p + α2p2 + · · ·
with αn ∈Z and 0 ⩽αn ⩽(p −1). Furthermore, α ∈Zp if and only if α−r = 0 whenever r > 0.
We can do arithmetic in Qp in similar fashion to the way it is done in R with decimal
expansions.
Example 2.29. Find
(1/3 + 2 + 2 · 3 + 0 · 32 + 2 · 33 + · · · ) + (2/32 + 0/3 + 1 + 2 · 3 + 1 · 32 + 1 · 33 + · · · ).
The idea is start at the left and work towards the right. Thus if the answer is
α = a−2/32 + a−1/3 + a0 + a13 + · · · ,
then
a−2 = 2,
a−1 = 1,
a0 = 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 · 3 ≡
3 0,
and so
a1 = 2 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 · 3 ≡
3 2
where the 1 is carried from the 30 term. Continuing we get
a2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2,
a3 = 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 · 3 ≡
3 0,
and so we get
α = 2/32 + 1/3 + 0 + 2 · 3 + 2 · 32 + 0 · 33 + · · ·
as the sum to within a term of 3-adic norm smaller than 1/33.

2. THE p-ADIC NORM AND THE p-ADIC NUMBERS
27
Notice that the p-adic expansion of a p-adic number is unique, whereas the decimal expansion
of a real need not be. For example
0.999 · · · = 1.000 · · · = 1.
We end this section with another fact about completions.
Theorem 2.30. Let R be ﬁeld with norm N. Then ˆR is a ﬁeld. In particular, Qp is a ﬁeld.
Proof. Let {an} be an element of ˆR, not equal to {0}. Then ˆN({an}) ̸= 0. Put
ℓ= ˆN({an}) = lim
n→∞N(an) > 0.
Then there is an M such that n > M implies that N(an) > ℓ/2 (why?), so for such an n we
have an ̸= 0. So eventually an has an inverse in R. Now deﬁne the sequence (bn) in R by bn = 1
if n ⩽M and bn = a−1
n
if n > M. Thus this sequence is Cauchy and
lim
n→∞
(N)anbn = 1,
which implies that
{an}{bn} = {1}.
Thus {an} has inverse {bn} in ˆR.

CHAPTER 3
Some elementary p-adic analysis
In this chapter we will investigate elementary p-adic analysis, including concepts such as
convergence of sequences and series, continuity and other topics familiar from elementary real
analysis, but now in the context of the p-adic numbers Qp with the p-adic norm | |p.
Let α = {an} ∈Qp. From Chapter 2 we know that for some M,
|α|p =
1
pordp aM ,
which is an integral power of p. So for t ∈Z, an inequality of form
|α|p < 1
pt
is equivalent to
|α|p ⩽
1
pt+1 .
Let (αn) be a sequence in Qp.
Proposition 3.1. (αn) is a Cauchy sequence in Qp if and only if (αn+1 −αn) is a null
sequence.
Proof. See Problem set 3.
□
Next we will now consider series in Qp. Suppose that (αn) is a sequence in Qp. For each n
we can consider the n-th partial sum of the series P αn,
sn = α1 + α2 + · · · + αn.
Definition 3.2. If the sequence (sn) in Qp has a limit
S = lim
n→∞
(p)sn
we say that the series P αn converges to the limit S and write
∞
X
n=1
αn = S.
S is called the sum of the series P αn. If the series has no limit we say that it diverges.
Example 3.3. Taking αn = npn we have
sm =
m
X
n=1
npn
and
sn+1 −sn = (n + 1)pn+1.

3. SOME ELEMENTARY p-ADIC ANALYSIS
This has norm
¯¯(n + 1)pn+1¯¯
p = |n + 1|p
¯¯pn+1¯¯
p
⩽
1
pn+1 ,
which clearly tends to 0 as n −→∞in the real numbers. By Proposition 3.1, (sn) is a Cauchy
sequence and therefore has a limit in Qp.
In real analysis, there are series which converge but are not absolutely convergent.
For
example, the series P(−1)n/n converges to −ln 2 but P 1/n diverges. Our next result shows
that this cannot happen in Qp.
Proposition 3.4. A series P αn in Qp converges if and only if (αn) is a null sequence.
Proof. If P αn converges then by Proposition 3.1 the sequence of partial sums (sn) is
Cauchy since
sn+1 −sn = αn
is a null sequence. Conversely, if (αn) is null, then by Proposition 3.1 we see that the sequence
(sn) is Cauchy and hence converges.
□
So to check convergence of a series P αn in Qp it suﬃces to investigate whether
lim
n→∞
(p)αn = 0.
This means that convergence of series in Qp is generally far easier to deal with than convergence
of series in the real or complex numbers.
Example 3.5. The series P pn converges since in R we have
|pn|p = 1
pn −→0.
In fact,
X
pn = lim
m→∞
(p)
m
X
n=0
pn =
1
(1 −p).
Example 3.6. The series P 1/n diverges in Qp since for example the subsequence
βn =
1
np + 1
of the sequence (1/n) has |βn|p = 1 for every n.
As a particular type of series we can consider power series (in one variable x). Let x ∈Qp
and let (αn) be a sequence. Then we have the series P αnxn. As in real analysis, we can
investigate for which values of x this converges or diverges.
Example 3.7. Take αn = 1 for all n. Then
lim
n→∞
(p)xn



= 0
if |x|p < 1,
⩾1
otherwise.

3. SOME ELEMENTARY p-ADIC ANALYSIS
31
So this series converges if and only if |x|p < 1. Of course, in R the series P xn converges if
|x| < 1, diverges if |x| > 1, diverges to +∞if x = 1 and to oscillates through 0 and −1 if
x = −1.
Example 3.8. For the series P nxn, we have
|nxn|p = |n|p|xn|p ⩽|x|p
n
which tends to 0 in R if |x|p < 1. So this series certainly converges for every such x.
Just as in real analysis, we can deﬁne a notion of radius of convergence for a power series
in Qp. For technical reasons, we will have to proceed with care to obtain a suitable deﬁnition.
We ﬁrst need to recall from real analysis the idea of the limit superior (lim sup) of a sequence
of real numbers.
Definition 3.9. A real number ℓis the limit superior of the sequence of real numbers (an)
if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
(LS1) For real number ε1 > 0,
∃M1 ∈N
such that
n > M1 =⇒ℓ+ ε1 > an.
(LS2) For real number ε2 > 0 and natural number M2,
∃m > M2
such that
am > ℓ−ε2.
We write
ℓ= lim sup
n
an
if such a real number exists. If no such ℓexists then we write
lim sup
n
an = ∞.
It is a standard fact that if the sequence (an) converges then lim sup an exists and
lim sup
n
an =
lim
n−→∞an.
In practise, this gives a useful method of computing lim sup an in many cases.


CHAPTER 4
The topology of Qp
We will now discuss continuous functions on Qp and related topics. We begin by introducing
some basic topological notions.
Let α ∈Qp and δ > 0 be a real number.
Definition 4.1. The open disc centred at α of radius δ is
D (α; δ) = {γ ∈Qp : |γ −α|p < δ}.
The closed disc centred at α of radius δ is
D (α; δ) = {γ ∈Qp : |γ −α|p ⩽δ}.
Clearly
D (α; δ) ⊆D (α; δ).
Such a notion is familiar in the real or complex numbers; however, here there is an odd
twist.
Proposition 4.2. Let β ∈D (α; δ). Then
D (β; δ) = D (α; δ) .
Hence every element of D (α; δ) is a centre. Similarly, if β′ ∈D (α; δ), then
D (β′; δ) = D (α; δ).
Proof. This is a consequence of the fact that the p-adic norm is non-Archimedean. Let
γ ∈D (α; δ); then
|γ −β|p = |(γ −α) + (α −β)|p
⩽max{|γ −α|p, |α −β|p}
< δ.
Thus D (α; δ) ⊆D (β; δ). Similarly we can show that D (β; δ) ⊆D (α; δ) and therefore these two
sets are equal. A similar argument deals with the case of closed discs.
□
Let X ⊆Qp (for example, X = Zp).
Definition 4.3. The set
DX (α; δ) = D (α; δ) ∩X
is the open ball in X of radius δ in X centred at α. Similarly,
DX (α; δ) = D (α; δ) ∩X
is the closed ball in X of radius δ centred at α.
33

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
We will now deﬁne a continuous function. Let f : X −→Qp be a function.
Definition 4.4. We say that f is continuous at α ∈X if
∀ε > 0∃δ > 0
such that
γ ∈DX (α; δ) =⇒f(γ) ∈D (f(α); ε) .
If f is continuous at every point in X then we say that it is continuous on X.
Example 4.5. Let f(x) = γ0 + γ1x + · · · + γdxd with γk ∈Qp be a polynomial function.
Then as in real analysis this is continuous at every point. To see this, we can either use the old
proof with | |p in place of | |, or the following p-adic version.
Let us show that f is continuous at α. Then
|f(x) −f(α)|p = |x −α|p
¯¯¯¯¯
d
X
n=1
γn(xn−1 + αxn−2 + · · · + αn−1)

If we also assume that |x|p < |α|p, then
|f(x) −f(α)|p ⩽|x −α|p max{
¯¯αn−1γn
¯¯
p : 1 ⩽n ⩽d}
⩽|x −α|pB,
say, for some suitably large B ∈R (in fact it needs to be at least as big as all the numbers
¯¯αn−1γn
¯¯
p with 1 ⩽n ⩽d. But if ε > 0 (and without loss of generality, ε < |α|p) we can take
δ = ε/B. If |x −α|p < δ, we now have
|f(x) −f(α)|p < ε.
Example 4.6. Let the power series P αnxn have radius of convergence r > 0. Then the
function f : D (0; r) −→Qp for which
f(x) =
∞
X
n=1
αnxn
is continuous by a similar proof to the last one.
It is also the case that sums and products of continuous functions are continuous as in real
analysis.
What makes p-adic analysis radically diﬀerent from real analysis is the existence of non-
trivial locally constant functions which we now discuss.
First recall the following from real
analysis.
Recollection 4.7. Let f : (a, b) −→R be a continuous function. Suppose that for every
x ∈(a, b) there is a t > 0 such that (x −t, x + t) ⊆(a, b) and f is constant on (x −t, x + t), i.e.,
f is locally constant. Then f is constant on (a, b).
We can think of (a, b) as a disc of radius (b −a)/2 and centred at (a + b)/2. This suggests
the following deﬁnition in Qp.
Definition 4.8. Let f : X −→Qp be a function where X ⊆. Then f is locally constant on
X if for every α ∈X, there is a real number δα > 0 such that f is constant on the open disc
DX (α; δα).

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
35
This remark implies that there are no interesting examples of locally constant functions on
open intervals in R; however, that is false in Qp.
Example 4.9. Let X = Zp, the p-adic integers. From Theorem 2.28, we know that for
α ∈Zp, there is a p-adic expansion
α = α0 + α1p + · · · + αnpn + · · · ,
where αn ∈Z and 0 ⩽αn ⩽(p −1). Consider the functions
fn : Zp −→Zp;
fn(α) = αn,
which are deﬁned for all n ⩾0. We claim these are locally constant. To see this, notice that fn
is unchanged if we replace α by any β with |β −α|p < 1/pn; hence fn is locally constant.
We can extend this example to functions fn : Qp −→Qp for n ∈Z since for any α ∈Qp we
have an expansion
α = α−rp−r + · · · + α0 + α1p + · · · + αnpn + · · ·
and we can set fn(α) = αn in all cases; these are still locally constant functions on Qp.
One important fact about such functions is that they are continuous.
Proposition 4.10. Let f : X −→Qp be locally constant on X. Then f is continuous on X.
Proof. Given α ∈X and ε > 0, we take δ = δα and then f is constant on DX (α; δα).
□
This result is also true in R.
Example 4.11. Let us consider the set Y = D (0; 1) ⊆Qp. Then we can deﬁne the charac-
teristic function of X,
χ→Y : Zp −→Qp;
χ→Y (α) =



1
if α ∈Y ,
0
if α /∈Y .
This is clearly locally constant on Zp since it is constant on each of the open discs D (k; 1) with
0 ⩽k ⩽(p −1) and these exhaust the elements of Zp. This can be repeated for any such open
ball D (α; δ) with δ > 0.
Another example is provided by the Teichm¨uller functions. These will require some work
to deﬁne. We will deﬁne a sequence of functions with the properties stated in the next result.
Proposition 4.12. There is a unique sequence of locally constant, hence continuous, func-
tions ωn : Zp −→Qp, satisfying
ωn(α)p = ωn(α)
for n ⩾0,
(T1)
α =

n=0
ωn(α)pn.
(T2)

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
Proof. First we deﬁne the Teichm¨uller character ω: Zp −→Qp which will be equal to ω0.
Let α ∈Zp; then the sequence (αpn) is a sequence of p-adic integers and we claim it has a limit.
To see this, we will show that it is Cauchy and use the fact that Qp is complete.
By Theorem 2.28, α has a unique p-adic expansion
α = α0 + α1p + α2p2 + · · ·
with αk ∈Z and 0 ⩽αk ⩽(p −1). In particular,
|α −α0|p < 1.
By Fermat’s Little Theorem 1.26, in Z we have
αp
0 ≡
p α0,
hence |αp
0 −α0|p < 1. But this gives
|αp −α|p = |(αp −αp
0) + (αp
0 −α0) + (α0 −α)|p
⩽max{|αp −αp
0|p, |αp
0 −α0|p, |α0 −α|p}
⩽1
since
|αp −αp
0|p =
¯¯¯(α −α0)(αp−1 + αp−2α0 + · · · + αp−1
0
)
¯¯¯
p
⩽|α −α0|p
using the fact that
¯¯¯αkαp−1−k
0
¯¯¯
p ⩽1 together with the triangle inequality.
We will show by induction upon n ⩾0 that
(4.1)
¯¯¯αpn+1 −αpn¯¯¯
p < 1
pn .
Clearly this is true for n = 0 by the above. Suppose true for n. Then
αpn+1 = αpn + β
say, where |β|p < 1/pn. Raising to the power p gives
αpn+2 = (αpn + β)p
= αpn+1 + pαpn(p−1)β + · · · +
µp
k
¶
αpnkβp−k + · · · + βp,
where all of the terms except the ﬁrst in the last line have | |p less than 1/pn+1. Applying the
p-adic norm gives the desired result for n + 1.
Now consider αpn. Then
αpn = (αpn −αpn−1) + (αpn−1 −αpn−2) + · · · + (αp −α) + α
= α +
n−1
X
k=0
(αpk+1 −αpk).
Clearly the diﬀerence αpn+1 −αpn is a null sequence and by Proposition 3.1 the sequence (αpn)
is Cauchy as desired.

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
37
Now we deﬁne the Teichm¨uller function or character,
ω: Zp −→Qp;
ω(α) = lim
n→∞
(p)αpn.
This function satisﬁes
|α −ω(α)|p < 1,
ω(α)p = ω(α).
The inequality follows from Equation (4.12) and the equation from the fact that
³
lim
n→∞
(p)αpn´p
= lim
n→∞
(p)(αpn)p
= lim
n→∞
(p)(αpn+1).
We now set ω0(α) = ω(α) and deﬁne the ωn by recursion using
ωn+1(α) = ω
µα −(ω0(α) + ω1(α)p + · · · + ωn(α)pn)
pn+1
¶
.
□
For α ∈Zp, the expansion
α = ω0(α) + ω1(α)p + · · · + ωnpn + · · ·
is called the Teichm¨uller expansion of α and the ωn(α) are called the Teichm¨uller digits of α.
This expansion is often used in place of the other p-adic expansion. One reason is that the
function ω is multiplicative. We sum up the properties of ω in the next proposition.
Proposition 4.13. The function ω: Zp −→Qp is locally constant and satisﬁes the condi-
tions
ω(αβ) = ω(α)ω(β),
|ω(α + β) −ω(α) −ω(β)|p < 1.
Moreover, the image of this function consists of exactly p elements of Zp, namely the p distinct
roots of the polynomial Xp −X.
Proof. The multiplicative part follows from the deﬁnition, while the additive result is an
easy exercise with the ultrametric inequality. For the image of ω, we remark that the distinct
numbers in the list 0, 1, 2, . . . , p −1 satisfy
|r −s|p = 1.
If r ̸= s, then
|ω(r) −ω(s)|p = 1.
Hence, the image of the function ω has at least p distinct elements, all of which are roots in Qp
of Xp −X. As Qp is a ﬁeld, there are not more than p of these roots. So this polynomial factors
as
Xp −X = X(X −ω(1))(X −ω(2)) · · · (X −ω(p −1))
and the p roots are the only elements in the image of ω.
□
Example 4.14. For the prime p = 2, the roots of X2 −X are 0,1. In fact, the Teichm¨uller
expansion is just the p-adic expansion discussed in Chapter 2.

38
4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
Example 4.15. For the prime p = 3, the roots of X3 −X are 0, ±1. So we replace the use
of 2 in the p-adic expansion by that of −1. Let us consider an example. Setting α = 1/5, we
have 5 ≡
3 −1 and so ω(5) = −1 since
|5 −(−1)|3 < 1.
Hence ω(1/5) = −1 too, so ω0(1/5) = −1. Now consider
(1/5) −(−1)
3
= 6
15 = 2
5,
and notice that 2 ≡
3 −1, hence ω1(1/5) = ω(2/5) = 1. Next consider
(2/5) −1
3
= −3
15 = −1
5 ,
giving ω2(1/5) = ω(−1/5) = 1. Thus
1
5 = (−1) + 1 · 3 + 1 · 32 + · · ·
where we have stopped at the term in 32 and ignored terms of 3-norm less than 1/32.
Example 4.16. If p = 5, there are three roots of X5 −X in Z, namely 0, ±1 and two more
in Z5 but not in Z. On the other hand, (Z/5)× =
­
2
®
as a group. Thus, we can take ω(2) = γ
say, to be generator of the group of (5 −1) = 4-th roots of 1 in Z5. So the roots of X5 −X in
Z5 are
ω(0) = 0, ω(1) = 1, ω(2) = γ, ω(3) = γ2, ω(4) = γ3.
Suppose that we wish to ﬁnd the Teichm¨uller expansion of 3 up to the term in 52. Then we
ﬁrst need to ﬁnd an integer which approximates γ to within a 5-norm of less than 1/52. So let
us try to ﬁnd an element of Z/53 which agrees with 2 modulo 5 and is a root of X4 ≡
53 1. We use
Hensel’s Lemma to do this.
We have a root of X4−1 modulo 5, namely 2. Set f(X) = X4−1 and note that f′(X) = 4X3.
Now f′(2) ≡
5 4 · 8 ≡
5 2 and we can take u = 3. Then x = 2 −3f(2) = −43 ≡
25 7 is a root of f(X)
modulo 25. Repeating this we obtain
7 −3f(7) = 7 −75 = −68 ≡
125 57
which is a root of the polynomial modulo 125. We now proceed as before.
This method always works and relies upon Hensel’s Lemma (see Chapter 1 and Problem
Set 3).
Theorem 4.17 (Hensel’s Lemma). Let f(X) ∈Zp[X] be a polynomial and let α ∈Zp be a
p-adic number for which
|f(α)|p < 1.
Deﬁne a sequence in Qp by setting α0 = α and in general
αn+1 = αn −(f′(α))−1f(αn).
Then each αn is in Zp and moreover
|f(αn)|p < 1
pn .

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp

Hence the sequence (αn) is Cauchy with respect to | |p and
f( lim
n→∞
(p)αn) = 0.
The proof is left to the reader who should look at Hensel’s Lemma in Chapter 1 and Problem
Set 3.
Example 4.18. Let f(X) = Xp−1 −1. Then from our earlier discussion of ω we know that
there are (p −1) roots of 1 in Zp. Suppose we have an α such that |α −γ|p < 1 for one of
these roots γ. By an easy norm calculation, |f(α)|p < 1. So we can take the sequence deﬁned
in (3–15) which converges to a root of f(X), i.e., a (p −1)st root of 1 in Zp.
We now prove another general fact about locally constant functions on Zp.
Theorem 4.19. Let f : Zp −→Qp be locally constant. Then the set
f(Zp) = im f = {f(α) : α ∈Zp}
is ﬁnite.
Proof. For each α ∈Zp we have a real number δα > 0 such that f is constant upon the
open disc D (α; δα). We can assume without loss of generality that
δα =
1
pdα
with dα ⩾0 an integer. Now for each α there is an integer nα such that
|α −nα|p <
1
pdα
and so f(nα) = f(α). By (3–10) we also have
D (α; δα) = D (nα; δα) .
We can in fact assume that nα satisﬁes
0 ⩽nα ⩽pdα+1 −1
since adding a multiple of pdα+1 to nα does not change the open disc D (nα; δα).
We know that
Zp =
∞
[
k=0
D

and f is constant on each of these open discs. But now for each k we have
Zp =
pd0+1
[
k=0
D
µ

.
Now take
δ = max{dk : 0 ⩽k ⩽pd0+1 −1}
and observe that for each k in the range 0 ⩽k ⩽pd0+1, we have f locally constant upon the
disc D
¡
k; 1/pδ¢
. Hence
Zp =

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
and f is constant upon each of these discs–but as there are only a ﬁnite number of these, the
image of f is the ﬁnite set
f(Zp) = {f(k) : 0 ⩽k ⩽pδ}.
This proves the result.
□
A similar argument establishes our next result.
Theorem 4.20 (The Compactness of Zp). Let A ⊆Zp and for each α ∈A let δα > be a
real number. If
Zp =
[
α∈A

then there is ﬁnite subset A′ ⊆A such that
Zp =

.
A similar result holds for each of the closed discs D (β; t) where t ⩾0 is a real number.
We leave the proof as an exercise. In fact these two results are equivalent in the sense that
each one implies the other (this is left as an exercise for the reader).
A direct consequence is the next result.
Theorem 4.21 (The Sequential Compactness of Zp). Let (αn) be a sequence in Zp. Then
there is a convergent subsequence of (αn), i.e., a sequence (βn) where βn = αs(n) with s : N −→N
a monotonic increasing sequence and which converges. A similar result holds for each of the
closed discs D (β; t) where t ⩾0 is a real number.
Proof. We have
Zp =
p[
k=1
D (α; 1) .
Hence, for one of the numbers 1 ⩽k ⩽p, say a1, the disc D (a1; 1) has αn ∈D (a1; 1) for
inﬁnitely many values of n. Then
D (a1; 1) =
p2
[
k=1
D
µ
k; 1
p
¶
and again for one of the numbers 1 ⩽k ⩽p2, say a2, we have αn ∈D (a2; 1/p) for inﬁnitely
many values of n. Continuing in this way we have a sequence of natural numbers an for which
D
¡
an; 1/pn−1¢
contains αm for inﬁnitely many values of m. Moreover, for each n,
D
¡
an; 1/pn−1¢
⊆D (an; 1/pn) .
Now for each n ⩾1, choose s(n) so that αs(n) ∈D
¡
an; 1/pn−1¢
. We can even assume that
s(n) < s(n + 1) for all n. Hence we have a subsequence (βn) with βn = αs(n) which we must
still show has limit. But notice that
|βn+1 −βn|p < 1
pn
since both of these are in D (an+1; 1/pn). Hence the sequence (βn) is null and therefore has a
limit in Zp.
□

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp

Recall the notion of uniform continuity:
Definition 4.22. Let f : X −→Qp be a function. Then f is uniformly continuous on X if
∀ε > 0∃δ > 0 such that ∀α, β ∈X, with |α −β|p < δ then |f(α) −f(β)|p < ε.
Clearly if f is uniformly continuous on X then it is continuous on X. In real or complex
analysis, a continuous function on a compact domain is uniformly continuous.
This is true
p-adically too.
Theorem 4.23. Let t > 0, α ∈Qp and f : D (α; t) −→Qp be a continuous function. Then
f is uniformly continuous.
The proof is a direct translation of that in real or complex analysis.
Similarly, we also have the notion of boundedness.
Definition 4.24. Let f : X −→Qp be a function. Then f is bounded on X if
∃b ∈R such that ∀x ∈X, |f(x)|p ⩽b.
Again we are familiar with the fact that a continuous function deﬁned on a compact set is
bounded.
Theorem 4.25. Let f : D (α; t) −→Qp be a continuous function. Then f is bounded, i.e.,
there is a b ∈R such that for all α ∈D (α; t), |f(α)|p ⩽b.
Again the proof is a modiﬁed version of that in classical analysis.
Now let us consider the case of a continuous function f : Zp −→Qp. By Theorem 4.20, Zp
is compact, so by Theorem 4.25 f is bounded. Then the set
Bf = {b ∈R : ∀α ∈Zp,
|f(α)|p ⩽b}
is non-empty. Clearly Bf ⊆R+, the set of non-negative real numbers. As Bf is bounded below
by 0, this set has an inﬁmum, inf Bf ⩾0. An easy argument now shows that
sup{|f(α)|p : α ∈Zp} = inf Bf.
We will write bf for this common value.
Theorem 4.26. Let f : Zp −→Qp be a continuous function. Then there is an α0 ∈Zp such
that bf = |f(α0)|p.
Proof. For all α ∈Zp we have |f(α)|p ⩽bf. By deﬁnition of supremum, we know that for
any ε > 0, there is a α ∈Zp such that
|f(α)|p > bf −ε.
For each n, take an αn ∈Zp such that
|f(αn)|p > bf −1
n

42
4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
and consider the sequence (αn) in Zp. By Theorem 4.21, there is a convergent subsequence
(βn) = (αs(n)) of (αn), where we can assume that s(n) < s(n + 1). Let α′ = lim
n→∞
(p)αs(n). Then
for each n we have
bf ⩾
¯¯f(αs(n))
¯¯
p > bf −
1
s(n)
and so
¯¯f(αs(n))
¯¯
p →bf as n →∞. Since

¯¯
p −
¯¯f(αs(n))
¯¯
p
¯¯¯ ⩽lim
n→∞
¯¯f(α′ −αs(n))
¯¯
p = 0,
by a result used in the proof of Theorem 2.17), we have bf = |f(α′)|p.
□
Definition 4.27. Let f : Zp −→Qp be continuous. The supremum norm of f is
∥f∥p = bf.
Consider the set of all continuous function f : Zp −→Qp,
C(Zp) = {f : Zp −→Qp : f continuous}.
This is a ring with the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication, and with the constant
functions 0, 1 as zero and unity. The function ∥∥p : C(Zp) −→R+ is in fact a non-Archimedean
norm on C(Zp).
Theorem 4.28. C(Zp) is a ring with non-Archimedean norm ∥∥p. Moreover, C(Zp) is
complete with respect to this norm.
We do not give the proof, but leave at least the ﬁrst part as an exercise for the reader.
Now recall the notion of the Fourier expansion of a continuous function f : [a, b] −→R; this
is a convergent series of the form
a0 +
∞
X
n=1
µ
an cos 2πx
n
+ sin 2πx

¶
which converges uniformly to f(x). In p-adic analysis there is an analogous expansion of a
continuous function using the binomial coeﬃcient functions
Cn(x) =
µx
n
¶
= x(x −1) · · · (x −n + 1)
n!
.
We recall that these are continuous functions Cn : Zp −→Qp which actually map Zp into itself
(see Problem Set 3).
Theorem 4.29. Let f ∈C(Zp). Then there is a unique null sequence (αn) in Qp such that
the series
∞
X
n=0
αnCn(x)
converges to f(x) for every x ∈Zp. Moreover, this convergence is uniform in the sense that the
sequence of functions
n
X
m=0
αmCm ∈C(Zp)
is a Cauchy sequence converging to f with respect to ∥∥p.

4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
43
The expansion in this result is called the Mahler expansion of f and the coeﬃcients αn are
the Mahler coeﬃcients of f. We need to understand how to determine these coeﬃcients.
Consider the following sequence of functions f[n] : Zp −→Qp:
f[0](x) = f(x)
f[1](x) = f[0](x + 1) −f[0](x)
f[2](x) = f[1](x + 1) −f[1](x)
...
f[n+1](x) = f[n](x + 1) −f[n](x)
...
f[n] is called the n-th diﬀerence function of f.
Proposition 4.30. The Mahler coeﬃcients are given by
αn = f[n](0)
(n ⩾0).
Proof. (Sketch) Consider
f(0) =
X
αnCn(0) = α0.
Now by Pascal’s Triangle,
Cn(x + 1) −Cn(x) = Cn−1(x).
Then
f[1](x) = f[0](x + 1) −f[0](x)
=
∞
X
n=0
αn+1Cn(x)
and repeating this we obtain
f[m+1](x) = f[m](x + 1) −f[m](x)
=
∞
X
n=0
αn+mCn(x).
Thus we have the desired formula
f[m](0) = αm.
□
The main part of the proof of Theorem 4.29 is concerned with proving that αn →0 and we
will not give it here.
The functions Cn have the property that
(4.2)
∥Cn∥p = 1.
To see this, note that we already have |Cn(α)|p ⩽1 if α ∈Zp. Taking α = n, we get Cn(n) = 1,
and the result follows. Of course this means that the series P αnCn(α) converges if and only if
αn →0.

44
4. THE TOPOLOGY OF Qp
Example 4.31. Consider the case of p = 3 and the function f(x) = x3. Then
f[0](x) = x3,
f[0](0) = 0,
f[1](x) = 3x2 + 3x + 1,
f[1](0) = 1,
f[2](x) = 6x + 3,
f[2](0) = 3,
f[3](x) = 6,
f[3](0) = 6,
f[4](x) = 0,
f[4](0) = 0,
and for n > 3,
f[n](x) = 0,
f[n](0) = 0.
So we have
x3 = C1(x) + 3C2(x) + 6C3(x).
In fact, for any polynomial function of degree d, the Mahler expansion is trivial beyond the
term in Cd.
The following formula for these an can be proved by induction on n.
(4.3)
f[n](0) =
n

f(n −k).
Example 4.32. Take p = 2 and the continuous function f : Z2 −→Q2 given by
f(n) = (−1)n
if n ∈Z.
Then
f[0](0) = 1,
f[1](0) = 0,
f[2](0) = −1,
and in general
f[n](0) = (−1)n
n

Therefore
f(x) =

Of course, this is just the binomial series for (1 −2)x in Q2.
This ends our discussion of elementary p-adic analysis. We have not touched many important
topics such as diﬀerentiability, integration and so on. For these I suggest you look at Koblitz [3].
I particularly recommend his discussion of the Γ-function and integration and the ζ-function.
The world of p-adic analysis is in many ways very similar to that of classical real analysis,
but it is also startlingly diﬀerent at times. I hope you have enjoyed this sampler. We will next
move on to something more like the complex numbers in the p-adic context.

CHAPTER 5
p-adic algebraic number theory
In this section we will discuss a complete normed ﬁeld Cp which contains Qp as a subﬁeld and
has the property that every polynomial f(X) ∈Cp[X] has a root in Cp; furthermore the norm
| |p restricts to the usual norm on Qp and is non-Archimedean. In fact, Cp is the smallest such
normed ﬁeld, in the sense that any other one with these properties contains Cp as a subﬁeld.
We begin by considering roots of polynomials over Qp.
Let f(X) ∈Qp[X]. Then in general f need not have any roots in Qp.
Example 5.1. For a prime p, consider the polynomial X2 −p. If α ∈Qp were a root then
we would have α2 = p and so |α|p
2 = 1/p. But we know that the norm of a p-adic number has
to have the form 1/pk with k ∈Z, so since |α|p = p−1/2 this would give a contradiction.
We will not prove the next result; the interested reader should consult [3].
Theorem 5.2. There exists a ﬁeld Qalg
p
containing Qp as a subﬁeld and having the following
properties:
(a) every α ∈Qalg
p
is algebraic over Qp;
(b) every polynomial f(X) ∈Qalg
p [X] has a root in Qalg
p .
Moreover, the norm | |p on Qp extends to a unique non-Archimedean norm N on Qalg
p
satisfying
N(α) = |α|p
whenever α ∈Qp; this extension is given by
N(α) =
¯¯minQp,α(0)
¯¯
p
1/d,
where d = degQp(α) = minQp,α(X).
We will denote by | |p the norm on Qalg
p
given in Theorem 5.2.
Let us look at some elements of Qalg
p .
Proposition 5.3. Let r = a/b be a positive rational number where a, b are coprime. Then
the polynomial Xb−pa ∈Qp[X] is irreducible over Qp. Any root α ∈Qalg
p
has norm |α|p = p−a/b.
The proof is a special case of the Eisenstein test which we discuss below. The following is
an important consequence.
Corollary 5.4. If r = a/b is not an integer, then none of the roots of Xb −pa in Qalg
p
are
in Qp.
Proof. We have |α|p = p−a/b which is not an integral power of p. But from Chapter 2 we
know that all elements of Qp have norms which are integral powers of p, hence α /∈Qp.

5. p-ADIC ALGEBRAIC NUMBER THEORY
Theorem 5.5 (The Eisenstein test (or criterion)). Let the polynomial
f(X) = Xd + αd−1Xd−1 + · · · + α1X + α0 ∈Zp[X]
satisfy
(a) for each k in the range 0 ⩽k ⩽d −1, |αk|p < 1;
(b) |α0|p = 1/p.
Then f(X) is irreducible over Qp.
The proof can be found in many books or courses on basic ring theory.
Example 5.6. Consider the polynomial
f1(X) = Xp−1 + Xp−2 + · · · + X + 1.
Notice that
Xp −1 = (X −1)f1(X)
and so f1(X) is the polynomial whose roots are all the primitive p-th roots of 1. Now consider
the polynomial g1(X) = f1(X + 1). Then
Xg1(X) = (X + 1)p −1
= Xp +

for 1 ⩽k ⩽p −1 is divisible by p; also

¶
= p, hence it
is not divisible by p2. By the Eisenstein test, g1(X) is irreducible over Qp and an easy argument
also shows that f1(X) is irreducible. Thus the primitive roots of 1 in Qalg
p
are roots of the
irreducible polynomial f1(X) and have degree (p −1) over Qp. If ζp is a root of f1(X), then
|ζp|p = 1. The remaining roots are of the form ζr
p with 1 ⩽r ⩽p −1.
The roots of g1(X) have the form ζr
p −1 for 1 ⩽r ⩽p −1 and g1(0) = p, so
¯¯ζr
p −1
¯¯
p = p−1/(p−1).
This example can be generalised as follows.
Theorem 5.7. Let d ⩾1. Then the polynomial
fd(X) = f1(Xpd−1)
is irreducible over Qp and its roots are the primitive pd-th roots of 1 in Qalg
p . If ζpd is such a
primitive root, any other has the form ζk
pd where 1 ⩽k ⩽pd −1 and k is not divisible by p.
Moreover, we have
¯¯ζpd
¯¯
p = 1,
¯¯ζpd −1
¯¯
p = p−(p−1)pd−1.

5. p-ADIC ALGEBRAIC NUMBER THEORY
47
Proof. This is proved by applying the Eisenstein test to the polynomial
gd(X) = fd(X + 1),
which satisﬁes the conditions required and has gd(0) = p.
□
Corollary 5.8. If p is an odd prime, then the only p-th power root of 1 in Qp is 1 itself.
If p = 2, the only square roots of 1 in Q2 are ±1.
The proof is immediate.
What about other roots of 1? We already know that there all the (p −1)-st roots of 1 are in
Qp; let us consider the d-th roots of 1 for any d > 1 not divisible by p. We begin by considering
the case where d has the form d = pr −1.
Proposition 5.9. For each r ⩾1, a primitive (pr −1)-th root of 1, ζ say, has degree r over
Qp and has minimal polynomial
minQp,ζ(X) =
Y
06t6r−1
(X −ζpt).
Moreover, |ζ|p = |ζ −1|p = 1.
The proof is omitted.
Now suppose that d is any natural number not divisible by p and ξ is any d-th root of 1.
Then for some m we have
pm ≡
d 1;
we denote the smallest such m greater than 0 by md. Then for any primitive (pmd −1)-th root
of 1, ζpmd−1 say, we can take
ξ = ζt(pmd−1)/md
pmd−1
,
where t is an integer coprime to (pmd −1)/md. This uses the fact that the group of roots of
Xn −1 in Qalg
p
is always cyclic by a result from the basic theory of ﬁelds. From this it is possible
to deduce
Proposition 5.10. Let d > 0 be a natural number not divisible by p. Then any primitive
d-th root of 1, ξ, has degree over Qp dividing md. Furthermore,
|ξ|p = 1,
|ξ −1|p = 1.
Corollary 5.11. ξ ∈Qp if and only if md = 1.
The proofs can be found in [3]. A complete statement is contained in
Theorem 5.12. Let ξ ∈Qalg
p
be a primitive d th root of 1. Let d = d0pt where d0 is not
divisible by p. Then ξ ∈Qp if and only if one of the following conditions holds:
(a) p is odd, t = 0 and md = 1
or
(b) p = 2 and d = 2.
Definition 5.13. Let α ∈Qalg
p . Then α is ramiﬁed if |α|p is not an integral power of p,
otherwise it is unramiﬁed. Let e(α) be the smallest positive natural number such that αe(α) is
unramiﬁed; then e(α) is called the ramiﬁcation degree of α.

48
5. p-ADIC ALGEBRAIC NUMBER THEORY
Example 5.14. Let π be a square root of p. We have seen earlier that |π|p = p−1/2, hence
π is ramiﬁed. In fact e(α) = 2.
This example generalises in an obvious way to roots of the polynomials Xb −pa.
Now we can consider Qalg
p
together with the norm | |p in the light of Chapter 2.
It is
reasonable to ask if every Cauchy sequence in Qalg
p
has a limit with respect to | |p.
Proposition 5.15. There are Cauchy sequences in Qalg
p
with respect to | |p which do not
have limits. Hence, Qalg
p
is not complete with respect to the norm | |p.
For an example of such a Cauchy sequence, see [3].
We can form the completion of Qalg
p
and its associated norm which are denoted
Cp = d
Qalg
p
| |p,
| |p.
Proposition 5.16. If α ∈Cp, then
|α|p = 1
pt ,
where t ∈Q.
Proof. We know this is true for α ∈Qalg
p . By results of Chapter 2, if
α = lim
n→∞
(p)αn
with αn ∈Qalg
p , then for suﬃciently large n,
|α|p = |αn|p.
□
Next we can reasonably ask whether an analogue of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
holds in Cp.
Theorem 5.17. Cp is algebraically closed in the sense that every non-zero polynomial
f(X) ∈Cp[X] has a root in Cp. By construction, Cp is complete with respect to the norm
| |p.
Again, we refer to [3] for a proof. Of course we have now obtained a complete normed
ﬁeld containing Qp which is algebraically closed and this is the p-adic analogue of the complex
numbers. It is helpful to compare the chains of ﬁelds
Q ⊆R ⊆C,
Q ⊆Qp ⊆Qalg
p
⊆Cp,
which are the sequences of ﬁelds we need to construct in order to reach the ﬁelds C and Cp
in the real and p-adic worlds. This ﬁeld Cp is the home of p-adic analysis proper and plays
an important rˆole in Number Theory and increasingly in other parts of Mathematics. We will
conﬁne ourselves to a few simple observations on Cp.
Consider a power series P αnxn where αn ∈Cp. Then we can deﬁne the radius of conver-
gence exactly as in Chapter 3, using the formula
r =
1
lim sup |αn|p
1/n .

5. p-ADIC ALGEBRAIC NUMBER THEORY
49
Proposition 5.18. The series P αnxn converges if |x|p < r and diverges if |x|p > r, where
r is the radius of convergence. If for some x0 such that |x0|p = r the series P αnxn
0 converges
(or diverges) then P αnxn converges (or diverges) for all x with |x|p = r.
The proof is the same as that in Chapter 3.
Example 5.19. Consider the logarithmic series
logp(x) = −
∞
X
n=1
(1 −x)n
n
discussed in Chapter 3. We showed that r = 1 for this example. Consider what happens when
x = ζp, a primitive root of 1 as above. Then |ζp −1|p = p1/(p−1), so logp(ζp) is deﬁned. Now by
the multiplicative formula for this series,
logp((ζp)p) = p logp(ζp),
and hence
p logp(ζp) = logp(1) = 0.
Thus logp(ζp) = 0. Similarly, for any primitive pn-th root of 1, say ζpn, we have that logp(ζpn)
is deﬁned and equals 0.
Example 5.20. Consider the exponential series
expp(x) =
∞
X
n=0
xn
n! .
In Chapter 3, the radius of convergence was shown to be p−1/(p−1).
Suppose α ∈Cp with
|α|p = p−1/(p−1). Then
¯¯¯¯
αn
n!
¯¯¯¯
p
= pordp n/(p−1).
By considering the terms of the form αpn/(pn!), we obtain
¯¯¯¯
αpn
pn!
¯¯¯¯
p
= pn/(p−1)
which diverges to +∞as n →∞. So the series P αn/n! diverges whenever |α|p = p−1/(p−1).
In Cp we have the unit disc,
Op = {α ∈Cp : |α|p ⩽1}.
Proposition 5.21. The subset Op ⊆Cp is a subring.
The proof uses the ultrametric inequality and is essentially the same as that for Zp ⊆Qp.
We end with yet another version of Hensel’s Lemma, this time adapted to use in Cp.
Theorem 5.22 (Hensel’s Lemma: Cp version). Let f(X) ∈Op[X]. Suppose that α ∈Op
and d ⩾0 is a natural number satisfying the two conditions
|f(α)|p ⩽
1
p2d+1 ,
¯¯f′(α)
¯¯
p = 1
pd .

50
5. p-ADIC ALGEBRAIC NUMBER THEORY
Setting α1 = α −f(α)f′(α)−1, we have
|f(α1)|p ⩽
1
p2d+3 .
The proof is left as an exercise.
This result generalises our earlier versions of Hensel’s
Lemma.
