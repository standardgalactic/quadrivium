About the Reviewer
Luca Masini is a Senior Software Engineer and Architect, born as a game developer 
for Commodore 64 (Footbal Manager) and Commodore Amiga (Ken il guerriero), 
soon he converted to Object-Oriented programming and for that, from his beginning 
in 1995, he was attracted by the Java language.
He worked on this passion as a consultant for the major Italian banks, developing 
and integrating the main software projects for which he has often taken the technical 
leadership. He was able to lead adoption of Java Enterprise in an environment 
where COBOL was the flagship platform, converting them from mainframe 
centric to distributed.
He then shifted his eyes toward open-source, starting from Linux and then with 
enterprise frameworks, with which he was able to introduce, with low impact, some 
concept like IoC, ORM, MVC. For that he was an early adopter of Spring, Hibernate, 
Struts, and an entire host of other technologies that in the long run have given his 
customers a technological advantage, and therefore development costs cuts.
Lately, however, his attention is completely directed towards the simplification and 
standardization of development with Java EE, and for this he is working at the ICT of 
a large Italian company to introduce advanced build tools (Maven and Continuous 
Integration), archetypes of project and "Agile Development" with plain standards.
Dedicated to my friend Enzo, and our common passion.

Preface
Hibernate is a popular open-source Java framework. It aims to solve problems 
associated with persistence in the Java world. Whether you are developing a simple 
stand-alone application, or a full-blown, server-side Java EE application, you can 
use and benefit from Hibernate. Although Hibernate has competitors, no other 
persistence framework is as flexible and as easy to learn.
Spring is another popular framework. It aims to simplify Java development in 
many areas, including persistence. However, Spring does not provide a persistence 
framework similar to Hibernate. Instead, it provides an abstraction layer over 
Hibernate to offer more flexibility, produce more effective code, and reduce 
maintenance costs.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring introduces Spring and Hibernate, 
explaining what persistence is, why it is important, and how it is implemented 
in Java applications. It provides a theoretical discussion of Hibernate and how 
Hibernate solves problems related to persistence. Finally, we take a look at Spring 
and the role of Spring in persistence.
Chapter 2, Preparing an Application to Use Spring with Hibernate guides you, 
step-by-step, down the path of preparing your application to use Hibernate and 
Spring. The prerequisites to developing with Hibernate and Spring, including getting 
Hibernate and Spring distributions, setting up a database, and adding extra tools 
and frameworks to your application, are all discussed here.
Chapter 3, A Quick Tour of Hibernate with Spring provides a quick tour of developing 
with Hibernate and Spring. Here, a simple example illustrates the basic concepts 
behind Hibernate and Spring.

Preface
[  ]
Chapter 4, Hibernate Configuration shows you how to configure and set up Hibernate. 
It discusses the basic configuration settings that are always required in any 
application. (Some optional settings are covered in the book's appendix.)
Chapter 5, Hibernate Mappings explains basic issues related to persistent objects 
and their mappings. It starts with basic mapping concepts and then moves on to 
advanced and practical issues.
Chapter 6, More on Mappings continues the mapping discussion with some advanced 
mapping topics. It explains how to map complex objects and create complicated 
mapping files.
Chapter 7, Hibernate Types discusses how Hibernate types help to define which Java 
types are mapped to which SQL database types. It explores the built-in Hibernate 
types. It also looks at custom type implementation when these built-in types do 
not satisfy the application's requirements, or when you want to change the default 
behavior of a built-in type.
Chapter 8, Hibernate Persistence Behavior discusses the life cycle of persistent 
objects within the application's lifetime. This chapter explains the basic persistence 
operations provided by the Session API at the heart of the Hibernate API. The 
chapter also discusses how persistence operations are cascaded between persistent 
objects, and how cascading behavior is defined in mapping files
Chapter 9, Querying in Hibernate explains the different approaches that Hibernate 
provides for querying persistent objects. It investigates HQL, a Hibernate-specific 
query language; native SQL, a database-relevant query language; and the Criteria 
API, a Hibernate API to express query statements.
Chapter 10, Inversion of Control with Spring starts developing with Spring, introducing 
the Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern that is implemented at the heart of Spring.
Chapter 11, Spring AOP investigates Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) as 
another Spring feature. Here, you'll learn what AOP means, how AOP simplifies 
application architecture, and how to implement AOP in Spring.
Chapter 12, Transaction Management discusses transaction management. It explains 
transaction concepts and how transactions are managed in native and Spring-based 
Hibernate applications. It also discusses caching as a persistence aspect that involves 
reliability of data manipulation.
Chapter 13, Integrating Hibernate with Spring explains how Hibernate and Spring 
are integrated and introduces the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. It shows how 
Spring and Hibernate combine to implement this pattern.

Preface
[  ]
Chapter 14, Web Development with Hibernate and Spring provides a quick discussion 
of web development with Spring and Hibernate. It does not provide a detailed 
discussion of web development. Instead, it takes Spring and Struts as sample 
web frameworks to illustrate how you might use Spring and Hibernate to develop 
web applications.
Chapter 15, Testing looks into testing persistence code, with a focus on unit testing. 
It introduces JUnit as an open-source unit-testing framework and discusses which 
aspects of persistence code with Hibernate require testing.
Appendix, Hibernate's Advanced Features looks at some advanced Hibernate topics, 
including some useful Hibernate properties, the event/listener model implemented 
by Hibernate, and Hibernate filters.
What you need for this book
In this book, I assume that you have a good understanding of the Java programming 
language, preferably version 1.5 or later, including the Java syntax and basic APIs. 
You are also expected to have a basic understanding of the JDBC API, relational 
databases, and the SQL query language. For Chapters 14, you should have a basic 
understanding of web development with Java, including HTML, JSP, servlets, and a 
web container such as Tomcat. 
Who this book is for
The book is primarily for Spring developers and users who want to persist using the 
popular Hibernate persistence framework. Java, Hibernate, JPA, Spring, and open 
source developers in general will also find the book useful.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between 
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an 
explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text are shown as follows: "For instance, the == operator can be used 
as follows to check whether object1 and object2 are identical."

Preface
[  ]
A block of code is set as follows: 
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch01;
import java.util.Date;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String ssn;
  private Date birthdate;
  private String stdNo;
  private Date entranceDate ;
}
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the 
relevant lines or items are set in bold:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch01;
public class Course {
  private int id;
  private String courseName;
  private int units;
  //setter and getter methods
}
Any command-line input or output is written as follows:
[Method=setId|Old Value=0|New Value=41]
[Method=setFirstName|Old Value=null|New Value=John]
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the 
screen, in menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "A 
relational database is an application that provides the persistence service".
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

An Introduction to Hibernate 
and Spring
Hibernate and Spring are open-source Java frameworks that simplify developing 
Java/JEE applications from simple, stand-alone applications running on a single 
JVM, to complex enterprise applications running on full-blown application servers. 
Hibernate and Spring allow developers to produce scalable, reliable, and effective 
code. Both frameworks support declarative configuration and work with a POJO 
(Plain Old Java Object) programming model (discussed later in this chapter), 
minimizing the dependence of application code on the frameworks, and making 
development more productive and portable.
Although the aim of these frameworks partially overlap, for the most part, each is 
used for a different purpose. The Hibernate framework aims to solve the problems 
of managing data in Java: those problems which are not fully solved by the Java 
persistence API, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), persistence providers, DBMS 
(Database Management Systems), and their mediator language, SQL (Structured 
Query Language).
In contrast, Spring is a multitier framework that is not dedicated to a particular area 
of application architecture. However, Spring does not provide its own solution for 
issues such as persistence, for which there are already good solutions. Rather, Spring 
unifies preexisting solutions under its consistent API and makes them easier to 
use. As mentioned, one of these areas is persistence. Spring can be integrated with 
a persistence solution, such as Hibernate, to provide an abstraction layer over the 
persistence technology, and produce more portable, manageable, and effective code.
Furthermore, Spring provides other services spread over the application architecture, 
such as inversion of control and aspect-oriented programming (explained later 
in this chapter), decoupling the application's components, and modularizing 
common behaviors.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[  ]
This chapter looks at the motivation and goals for Hibernate and Spring. The chapter 
begins with an explanation of why Hibernate is needed, where it can be used, and 
what it can do. We'll take a quick look at Hibernates alternatives, exploring their 
advantages and disadvantages. I'll outline the valuable features that Hibernate 
offers and explain how it can solve the problems of the traditional approach to Java 
persistence. The discussion continues with Spring. I'll explain what Spring is, what 
services it offers, and how it can help to develop a high-quality data-access layer 
with Hibernate.
If you already have enough background to start learning Hibernate and Spring, you 
can skip this chapter and jump to the next one.
Persistence management in Java
Persistence has long been a challenge in the enterprise community. Many persistence 
solutions from primitive, file-based approaches, to modern, object-oriented databases 
have been presented. For any of these approaches, the goal is to provide reliable, 
efficient, flexible, and scalable persistence.
Among these competing solutions, relational databases (because of certain advantages) 
have been most widely accepted in the IT world. Today, almost all enterprise 
applications use relational databases. A relational database is an application that 
provides the persistence service. It provides many persistence features, such as 
indexing data to provide speedy searches; solves the relevant problems, such as 
protecting data from unauthorized access; and handles many complications, such as 
preserving relationships among data. Creating, modifying, and accessing relational 
databases is fairly simple. All such databases present data in two-dimensional tables 
and support SQL, which is relatively easy to learn and understand. Moreover, they 
provide other services, such as transactions and replication. These advantages are 
enough to ensure the popularity of relational databases.
To provide support for relational databases in Java, the JDBC API was developed. 
JDBC allows Java applications to connect to relational databases, express their 
persistence purpose as SQL expressions, and transmit data to and from databases. 
The following screenshot shows how this works:

Chapter 1
[  ]
Application

Using this API, SQL statements can be passed to the database, and the results can be 
returned to the application, all through a driver.
The mismatch problem
JDBC handles many persistence issues and problems in communicating with 
relational databases. It also provides the needed functionality for this purpose. 
However, there remains an unsolved problem in Java applications: Java applications 
are essentially object-oriented programs, whereas relational databases store data in 
a relational form. While applications use object-oriented forms of data, databases 
represent data in two-dimensional table forms. This situation leads to the so-called 
object-relational paradigm mismatch, which (as we will see later) causes many 
problems in communication between object-oriented and relational environments.
For many reasons, including ease of understanding, simplicity of use, efficiency, 
robustness, and even popularity, we may not discard relational databases. However, 
the mismatch cannot be eliminated in an effortless and straightforward manner.
Identity and equality mismatch
The first and most significant mismatch involves the concepts of data equality. 
Java provides two definitions for object identity and equality. According to Java, 
two objects are called identical when they point to the same reference in memory. 
In contrast, two objects are considered equal when they contain similar data, as 
determined by the developer, regardless of the memory locations to which the 
objects point.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 10 ]
Java offers the equals() method and == operator to support equality and identity, 
respectively. For instance, the == operator can be used as follows to check whether 
object1 and object2 are identical:
object1==object2
The equals() method, used as follows, determines whether two objects are equal:
object1.equals(object2)
When two objects are identical, they refer to the same memory location. Therefore, 
they have the same value and are definitely equal. However, two objects that are 
equal may not be identical since they may point to different locations in memory.
The hashCode() method must be overridden in every class which 
overrides the equals() method. The hashCode() method returns an 
integer as the hash code value for the object on which this method is 
invoked. This code is supported for the benefit of hashing based collection 
classes such as Hashtable, HashMap, HashSet, and so on. Equal objects 
must produce the same hash code, as long as they are equal. However, 
unequal objects do not need to produce distinct hash codes. See the JDK 
documentation for more details.
While Java offers two distinct definitions for object identity and equality, databases 
do not have any corresponding definitions for these terms. In a database, the data 
is represented as table rows, and each table row is identified based on the content it 
holds. A significant mismatch occurs when we map from the object-oriented world 
to the relational world. Although two objects are not identical because they refer 
to different locations in memory, in the database, they may be considered identical 
because they hold the same content.
The common approach to eliminating this mismatch is to use an extra field in the 
object's class, and an extra identifier column in the respective table of the object. 
This approach identifies objects based on the identifier values they hold in either 
object or relational form, instead of identifying them based on their references in 
memory (in the object-oriented world) and based on the content they hold (and in 
the relational world). Therefore, as the following screenshot shows, each object and 
its corresponding row in the table can be identified through the same strategy, that 
is, by considering the identifier value:

Let's look at a simple example. Suppose that our application has a Student class. We 
may typically use a STUDENT table in the database to store Student objects. We may 
also use an extra field in the class, called an object identifier, and a corresponding 
column in the table, called primary key, to allow objects to be recognized when they 
are stored, retrieved, or updated. The following screenshot shows the STUDENT table:
STUDENT

SSN

STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
BIGINT, PK
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
DATE
VARCHAR(50)
DATE

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 12 ]
This table would hold the objects of the class shown in the following code listing. 
Note that, we have just shown the skeleton of the class with its properties and 
without its other details:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch01;
import java.util.Date;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String ssn;
  private Date birthdate;
  private String stdNo;
  private Date entranceDate ;
}
We may also use the following JDBC code in our application to store a Student 
object in the STUDENT table:
Connection c = null;
PreparedStatement p = null;
try {
  Student std = …//a ready to store Student object
  c = …//obtaining a Connection object
  String q = "INSERT INTO STUDENT " + 
    "(ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SSN, BIRTHDATE, STD_NO,
      ENTRANCE_DATE)" + 
    " VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
  p = c.prepareStatement(q);
  p.setInt(1, std.getId());
  p.setString(2, std.getFirstName());
  p.setString(3, std.getLastName());
  p.setString(4, std.getSsn());
  p.setDate(5, new java.sql.Date(std.getBirthdate().getTime()));
  p.setString(6, std.getSsn());
  p.setDate(7, new java.sql.Date(std.getEntranceDate().getTime()));
  p.executeUpdate();
} catch(Exception ex) {
  //handling the exception
} finally {
  if (p != null) {
    try {
      p.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {

Chapter 1
[ 13 ]
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
  if (c != null) {
    try {
      c.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
}
As you can see, to store a Student object, we need to obtain a PreparedStatement 
object with an appropriate SQL query. We then need to put the properties of the 
Student object in the PreparedStatement, and finally execute the update query 
by calling the  executeUpdate() method of PreparedStatement. With all of these, 
we should handle exceptions when there is any problem in communicating to the 
database or executing the query.
Similarly, we may use code such as the following to load a Student object:
Connection c = null;
PreparedStatement p = null;
Student std = null;
try {
  int id = ...//the identifier of the student to  load
  c = …//obtaining a Connection object
  String q = "SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, SSN, BIRTHDATE, STD_NO,
  ENTRANCE_DATE " + "FROM STUDENT WHERE ID = ?";
  p = c.prepareStatement(q);
  p.setInt(1, id);
  ResultSet rs = p.executeQuery();
  if (rs.next()) {
    String firstName = rs.getString("FIRST_NAME");
    String lastName = rs.getString("LAST_NAME");
    String ssn = rs.getString("SSN"); 
    Date birthdate = rs.getDate("BIRTHDATE"); 
    String stdNo = rs.getString("STD_NO"); 
    Date entranceDate = rs.getDate("ENTRANCE_DATE"); 
    std = new Student(id, firstName, lastName, ssn, birthdate, stdNo,
    entranceDate);
    if (rs.next()) {
            //write a message warning about multiple objects
    }
  }  	

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 14 ]
} catch(Exception ex) {
  //handling the exception
} finally {
  if (p != null) {
    try {
      p.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
  if (c != null) {
    try {
      c.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
}
return std;
To load an object from the database, we need to obtain a PreparedStatment with 
an appropriate SQL query, set the required values, execute the query, iterate over 
the result, and produce the Student object. We should also handle the exceptions 
correspondingly.
The most difficult and important parts of the above codes are the SQL 
statements. These statements are expressed in a different language than 
the language that object-oriented languages such as Java use. Besides, 
their syntax can't be checked in the compiled time since they are 
expressed in the raw String.
As it can be concluded from both the previous examples, converting the 
object-oriented and relational forms of data to one another cannot be accomplished 
in an effortless and straightforward manner. After all, any change in the object model 
or the database schema can affect the converting code.
This example demonstrates a primary difficulty in mapping objective and relational 
forms of data. However, this simple case requires only minimal effort to map a 
typical entity object. The mapping of objects could easily be more complicated than 
in the example, especially when an entity object is inherited from or associated with 
another object. Here, we are not going to discuss issues behind persisting inheritance 
and such in detail. However, a quick look at how pure JDBC deals with them offers 
insight into how Hibernate can ease object mapping, as we'll see in this book.

Chapter 1
[ 15 ]
Mapping object inheritance mismatch
Another point where a mismatch occurs is in the mapping of object inheritance. 
While Java lets an object be inherited by another object, relational databases do not 
support the notion of inheritance. This means we need to define our own strategy to 
translate class hierarchy to database schema.
Let's elaborate inheritance by extending our simple example using a general class, 
Person, as a superclass of Student. The class diagram shown in the following 
screenshot shows the Student class, which is now a subclass of Person:
Person
-id
-firstName
-lastName
-ssn
-birthdate
Student
-stdNo
-entranceDate
The question here is, how can the object inheritance be persisted? Can it be persisted 
in one table? If not, how should we establish the relationship between tables?
One solution would be to use individual tables for individual classes in the 
hierarchy. According to this solution, the objects of type superclass are stored 
directly in the superclass's table, but the subclass objects are persisted in both 
superclass and subclass tables. If we chose this strategy for our example, we 
would have two tables, PERSON and STUDENT, as shown in the following figure:
STUDENT
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
SSN
BIRTHDATE
BIGINT, PK
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
DATE
ID
PERSON_ID
STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
BIGINT, PK
BIGINT, FK
VARCHAR(50)
DATE
PERSON

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 16 ]
Because objects of the subclass are spread over two tables, we need a mechanism 
to recognize the association between rows when an object is retrieved, updated, 
or removed. Fortunately, many databases support foreign keys which are used to 
establish a relationship between database tables. This is what I have used in our 
example. As you can see, the STUDENT table takes the ID column as its primary 
key and a foreign key onto the PERSON table, meaning it holds the identifier of the 
associated row in the STUDENT table. When a Student object is stored, updated, or 
removed, the relevant student's data should be inserted in, updated in, or removed 
from the two tables. Moreover, to load a Student object, we need to query both 
tables with SQL joins, like this:
Connection c = null;
PreparedStatement p = null;
Student std = null;
try {
  int id =...//the identifier of the student that is loaded
  c = …//obtaining a Connection object    
  c.setAutoCommit(false);
  String q = "SELECT P.FIRST_NAME, P.LAST_NAME, P.SSN, " + 
             "P.BIRTHDATE, S.STD_NO,
              S.ENTRANCE_DATE "+ 
             "FROM PERSON P INNER JOIN STUDENT S " + 
              " ON P.ID = S.PERSON_ID WHERE P.ID=?; ";
  p = c.prepareStatement(q);
  p.setInt(1, id);
  ResultSet rs = p.executeQuery();
  if (rs.next()) {
    String firstName = rs.getString("FIRST_NAME");
    String lastName = rs.getString("LAST_NAME");
    String ssn = rs.getString("SSN");
    Date birthday = rs.getDate("BIRTHDATE");
    String stdNo = rs.getString("STD_NO");
    Date entranceDate = rs.getDate("ENTRANCE_DATE");
    std = new Student(id, firstName, lastName, ssn, 
                      birthday, stdNo, entranceDate);
    if (rs.next()) {
      //making a message warning about multiple objects existence
    }
  }
  p.close();
  c.commit();
} catch (Exception ex) {
  //handling the exception
} finally {
  if (p != null) {

Chapter 1
[ 17 ]
    try {
      p.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
  if (c != null) {
    try {
      c.close();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
      //handling the exception
    }
  }
}
return std;
As you can see, using SQL joins makes the query expressions more complex, and 
consequently harder to develop, test, and maintain.
Mapping more complicated objects
Many Java objects are associated with other objects. The associated objects may be 
values or entities. Entities are objects that have their own persistent identity and are 
stored as discussed before. In contrast, values are objects that do not define some 
kind of persistent identity. If an entity object is associated with a value object, no real 
problem arises since the value object can be stored with the entity object in the same 
table. However, this is not true in the case of associations between two entity objects. 
Unfortunately, databases do not offer a way to persist object associations by default.
The next mismatch happens when a graph of entity objects must be persisted in 
the database. In this case, the persistence should be accomplished in such a way 
that allows the object graph to be restored to its original form at a later time. As a 
common strategy, for each entity class a database table is used and when an object 
is stored, each object is persisted in its own database table. The next question here is, 
how can object associations be persisted? As with inheritance, foreign keys can 
be taken to establish inter-table relationships and provide table associations.
Let's dig a bit deeper into object associations and extend our example to see how 
JDBC and SQL deal with associations in practice.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 18 ]
Mapping a many-to-many association
Let's assume that each student is associated with an array of courses. If each course 
is represented by another class, Course, then we have an object relationship like the 
one shown in the following screenshot:
Person
-id
-firstName
-lastName
-ssn
-birthdate
Student
-stdNo
-entranceDate
-courses
n
m
Course
-id
-courseName
-units
The following code shows the Course class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch01;
public class Course {
  private int id;
  private String courseName;
  private int units;
  //setter and getter methods
}
And this shows the Student class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch01;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.List;
public class Student extends Person {
  private String stdNo;
  private Date entranceDate;
  private List courses;
  //setter and getter methods
}

Chapter 1
[ 19 ]
When we work with Hibernate, we always use simple classes which do 
not have any special behaviors. It is recommended that these classes be 
expressed with private properties and with setter and getter methods to 
access the properties. This way of class definition has many advantages 
that will be fully discussed in the coming chapters.
Note that, we have designed our classes as simple to be as possible to keep our 
example simple, as well. In this case, the COURSE table needs a foreign key column 
referring to the associated row in the STUDENT table. The tables may be related as 
shown in the following screenshot:
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
SSN
BIRTHDATE
BIGINT, PK
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
DATE
PERSON
STUDENT
ID
PERSON_ID
STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
BIGINT, PK
BIGINT, FK
VARCHAR(50)
DATE
ID
STUDENT_ID
COURSE_NAME
UNITS
BIGINT, PK
BIGNIT, FK
VARCHAR(50)
INT
COURSE
This kind of relationship indicates that when a Student object is persisted, the 
associated Course objects should be persisted as well. However, we may use a 
different strategy for updating or removing associated objects when the object is 
updated or removed. For example, we may decide that the associated objects are 
not to be updated when the object is updated, but they should be erased from the 
database when the object is removed. This is what we call a cascade operation, 
indicating whether the operation, or operations, should be propagated to 
associated entities.
To load an entity object, we must query the appropriate table and any others 
associated with it. The following snippet shows the query to load a Student object 
with its associated courses:
SELECT PERSON.FIRST_NAME, PERSON.LAST_NAME, PERSON.SSN, PERSON.
BIRTHDATE, STUDENT.STD_NO, STUDENT.ENTRANCE_DATE, COURSE.ID, COURSE.
COURSE_NAME, COURSE.UNITS FROM PERSON INNER JOIN (STUDENT INNER JOIN 
COURSE ON STUDENT.ID = COURSE.STUDENT_ID) ON PERSON.ID = STUDENT.
PERSON_ID WHERE STUDENT.ID=?;
It is very difficult, tedious, and error prone to use only pure JDBC and SQL to store 
the object graph in multiple tables, restore the object-oriented form of data, search 
object associations, and handle object inheritance. The SQL statements you use may 
not be optimized, and may be very difficult to test and maintain.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 20 ]
This is the main reason to use a persistence framework such as Hibernate. The next 
section looks at Hibernate's background, as well as its advantages, alternatives, 
and architecture.
Object relational mapping
As the previous discussion shows, we are looking for a solution that enables 
applications to work with the object representation of the data in database tables, 
rather than dealing directly with that data. This approach isolates the business logic 
from any relational issues that might arise in the persistence layer. The strategy to 
carry out this isolation is generally called object/relational mapping (O/R Mapping, 
or simply ORM).
A broad range of ORM solutions have been developed. At the basic level, each ORM 
framework maps entity objects to JDBC statement parameters when the objects 
are persisted, and maps the JDBC query results back to the object representation 
when they are retrieved. Developers typically implement this framework approach 
when they use pure JDBC. Furthermore, ORM frameworks often provide more 
sophisticated object mappings, such as the mapping of inheritance hierarchy and 
object association, lazy loading, and caching of the persistent objects. Caching 
enables ORM frameworks to hold repeatedly fetched data in memory, instead 
of being fetched from the database in the next requests, causing deficiencies and 
delayed responses, the objects are returned to the application from memory. Lazy 
loading, another great feature of ORM frameworks, allows an object to be loaded 
without initializing its associated objects until these objects are accessed.
ORM frameworks usually use mapping definitions, such as metadata, XML files, 
or Java annotations, to determine how each class and its persistent fields should be 
mapped onto database tables and columns. These frameworks are usually configured 
declaratively, which allows the production of more flexible code.
Many ORM solutions provide an object query language, which allows querying the 
persistent objects in an object-oriented form, rather than working directly with tables 
and columns through SQL. This behavior allows the application to be more isolated 
from the database properties.
Hibernate as an O/R Mapping solution
For a long time, Hibernate has been the most popular persistence framework in the 
Java community. Hibernate aims to overcome the already mentioned impedance 
mismatch between object-oriented applications and relational databases.

Chapter 1
[ 21 ]
With Hibernate, we can treat the database as an object-oriented store, thereby 
eliminating mapping of the object-oriented and relational environments. Hibernate 
is a mediator that connects the object-oriented environment to the relational 
environment. It provides persistence services for an application by performing 
all of the required operations in the communication between the object-oriented 
and relational environments. Storing, updating, removing, and loading can be 
done regardless of the objects persistent form. In addition, Hibernate increases the 
application's effectiveness and performance, makes the code less verbose, and allows 
the code to be more focused on business rules than persistence logic. The following 
screenshot depicts Hibernates role in persistence:
Application
Driver
Database
Hibernate
SQL Statements

JTA
JDBC
JNDI
Hibernate fully supports object orientation, meaning all aspects of objects, such as 
association and inheritance, are properly persisted. Hibernate can also persist object 
navigation, that is, how an object is navigable through its associated objects. It caches 
data that is fetched repeatedly and provides lazy loading, which notably enhances 
database performance. As you will see, Hibernate provides caches in two levels: 
first-level built-in, and second-level pluggable cache strategies. The first-level cache 
is a required property for any ORM to preserve object consistency. It guaranties that 
the application always works with consistent objects. This is originated from the 
fact that many threads in the application use the ORM to persist the objects which 
might potentially be associated to the same table rows in the database. The following 
screenshot depicts the role of a cache when using Hibernate:

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 22 ]
Hibernate provides its own query language, which is Hibernate Query Language 
(HQL). At runtime, HQL expressions are transformed to their corresponding 
SQL statements, based on the database used. Because databases may use 
different versions of SQL and may expose different features, Hibernate presents 
a new concept, called an SQL dialect, to distinguish how databases differ. 
Furthermore, Hibernate allows SQL expressions to be used either declaratively or 
programmatically, which is useful in specific situations when Hibernate does not 
satisfy application persistence requirements.
Hibernate keeps track of object changes through snapshot comparisons to prevent 
unnecessary updating.
Other O/R Mapping solutions
Although Hibernate is the most popular persistence framework, many other 
frameworks do exist. Some of these are explained as follows:
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB): It is a standard J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) 
technology that defines a different type of persistence by presenting entity 
beans. Mostly, for declarative middleware services that are provided by 
the application server, such as transactions, EJB may be preferred for 
architecture. However, due to its complexity, nontransparent persistence, 
and need for a container (all of which make it difficult to implement, test, 
and maintain), EJB is less often used than other persistence frameworks.
iBatis SQL Map: It is a result set–mapping framework which works at the 
SQL level, allowing SQL string definitions with parameter placeholders in 
XML files. At runtime, the placeholders are filled with runtime values, either 
from simple parameter objects, JavaBeans properties, or a parameter map. To 
their advantage, SQL maps allow SQL to be fully customized for a specific 
database. To their disadvantage, however, these maps do not provide an 
abstraction from the specific features of the target database.
Java Data Objects (JDO): It is a specification for general object persistence 
in any kind of data store, including relational databases and object-oriented 
databases. Most JDO implementations support using metadata mapping 
definitions. JDO provides its own query language, JDOQL, and its own 
strategy for change detection.
TopLink: It provides a visual mapping editor (Mapping Workbench) and 
offers a particularly wide range of object, relational mappings, including a 
complete set of direct and relational mappings, object-to-XML mappings, 
and JAXB (Java API for XML Binding) support. TopLink provides a rich 
query framework that supports an object-oriented expression framework, 
EJB QL, SQL, and stored procedures. It can be used in either a JSE or a 
JEE environment.

Hibernate designers has borrowed many Hibernate 
concepts and useful features from its ancestors.
Hibernate versus other frameworks
Unlike the frameworks just mentioned, Hibernate is easy to learn, simple to use, 
comprehensive, and (unlike EJB) does not need an application server. Hibernate is 
well documented, and many resources are available for it. Downloaded more than 
three million times, Hibernate is used in many applications around the world. To 
use Hibernate, you need only J2SE 1.2 or later, and it can be used in stand-alone or 
distributed applications.
The current version of Hibernate is 3, but the usage and configuration of this version 
are very similar to version 2. Most of the changes in Hibernate 3 are compatible with 
Hibernate 2.
Hibernate solves many of the problems of mapping objects to a relational 
environment, isolating the application from getting involved in many persistence 
issues. Keep in mind that Hibernate is not a replacement for JDBC. Rather, it can 
be thought of as a tool that connects to the database through JDBC and presents an 
object-oriented, application-level view of the database.
Hibernate architecture
The following screenshot depicts the main participants in the Hibernate architecture:

Database

Persistent Objects

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 24 ]
As the screenshot shows, the main players are Hibernate configuration file(s), 
mapping definitions, and persistent objects. At the heart of Hibernate is its 
configuration. This configuration is always presented by an XML, or a properties 
file and includes the relevant database information, such as database username, 
password, URL, driver class, and SQL dialect that Hibernate needs for connecting 
to the database, communicating with it, and performing persistence operations.
Persistent objects form another part of the Hibernate architecture. These objects 
are what we will persist in the database. These entity objects and their classes, as 
upcoming chapters explain, do not need to exhibit any special behavior, except that 
they must follow some POJO rules.
In addition to the Hibernate configuration file and the persistent objects, Hibernate's 
architecture uses other XML documents, which define how application objects 
should be mapped to database tables. These documents specify the respective 
table of each entity class, the mapping of each class's field to its respective table 
column, and sometimes other mapping information, such as object associations and 
inheritance. These files have a simple syntax, making them easy to develop and 
maintain. However, some utility tools that ship with Hibernate let you automatically 
generate the mapping files, based on the application classes or database schema, and 
also allow you to modify them in a graphic tool.
Although these objects are the main players in the Hibernate architecture, a 
Hibernate application's runtime architecture is not limited to them. As we will see 
in the chapters that follow, the most significant runtime objects are Configuration, 
SessionFactory, Session, and Transaction.
Hibernate can be used as simply as follows to store or retrieve a Student object:
Configuraion cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure();
SessionFactory sessionFactory = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
Student student = …//a new instantiated student object
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(student);
tx.commit();
session.close();
Here, we have just configured Hibernate, started a transaction, stored the student 
object, committed the transaction, and finally disconnected from Hibernate. These 
are actually the required operations to interact with Hibernate. The configuration 
includes setting up Hibernate to work with a particular database with special 
behavior. Every Hibernate interaction should be done inside a transaction, which 
justifies the next step. Don't worry, all of these concepts with their usages will be 
explained in the future chapters.

What is Spring
Now that you've read a bit about Hibernate's background, it is time to look at Spring 
and what it has to offer. Here, we'll take a quick look at Spring, saving the details for 
later chapters.
Spring is an ambitious framework that aims to be a complete solution for entire 
JEE applications. Unlike Hibernate, which works merely on the persistence tier, 
Spring is a multitier framework which offers a wide range of services. It makes JEE 
development easier, by providing a clean separation of concerns, decoupling an 
application's components, and minimizing complexities typically encountered in 
sophisticated JEE environments.
Choosing an appropriate solution for a Java application, particularly when it is 
built with open-source tools, is a common challenge in application design. This 
is another challenge that Spring aims to address. The challenge starts when you 
encounter a large number of open-source technologies that may be used for the 
same purpose, such as Struts, WebWork, JSF, or Tapestry for web, and Hibernate, 
JDO, and iBatis for the persistence tier. Spring lets you use a large variety of 
open-source tools behind the scenes, without needing large amounts of code 
or coupling the application too closely to the underlying frameworks.
Spring is also called a lightweight framework, since it replaces frameworks that are 
restrictive and cumbersome to use, such as EJB, that are already offered by JEE.
Spring is modularized with several components. Each component provides a 
particular service. The following sections summarize some of these.
Inversion of Control container
Inversion of Control (IoC) is the technology most identified with Spring. With 
the IoC core container, Spring enables the management of object dependencies by 
pushing dependencies into objects at runtime, instead of letting the objects pull 
their dependencies from their environment. This approach has many advantages:
All application classes are designed as simple as possible with 
minimum behaviors, and with their only required properties they 
will be well documented.
All application classes are self-documented, and the documentation is always 
up-to-date.
No class has its own configuration management, which allows more 
manageable code.
The application leaves configuration management to the framework.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 26 ]
IoC increases consistency in configuration management, since such 
management is accomplished by the framework.
The application has no need for any configuration management code since 
the framework handles this common aspect of every application.
Chapter 10 discusses Spring's Inversion of Control in depth.
Aspect-oriented programming framework
Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is the perfect complementary approach 
to IoC, solving common problems related to J2EE design. AOP allows us to 
consolidate functionality, which would be otherwise scattered in different places, 
in a single place. Managing transactions is an example of this functionality. With 
Spring, transaction management occurs in a single place and is  not scattered in 
persistence methods.
AOP complements object-oriented programming (OOP) by introducing a new 
concept, called concerns or aspects, to model real-world objects. Concerns are 
processes that are not directly related to the object hierarchy. Instead, they spread 
over sets of operations. For example, logging, security, and transaction are common 
examples for a concern, since they should be applied to sets of methods without any 
relationship to the object hierarchy.
Spring AOP has the following key benefits:
It prevents code duplication and provides more manageable code.
It allows declarative enabling or disabling concerns.
Aspect-oriented programming with Spring is fully discussed in Chapter 11.
Data access abstraction
Spring allows consistent data access to be implemented with solid abstraction. This 
is carried out through a rich hierarchy of exceptions and a set of helper classes, for 
working with a wide range of persistence technologies.
We'll look at Spring's Data Access Abstraction and how Spring is integrated with 
Hibernate in Chapter 13.

Chapter 1
[ 27 ]
Transaction abstraction
Spring provides a transaction abstraction layer over JTA (Java Transaction API) 
global transactions, which span multiple transactional resources. They are managed 
by an application server, or local transactions managed by JDBC, Hibernate, 
JDO, or any other persistence technology. It allows coding transactions, either 
programmatically or declaratively. These topics are discussed in Chapter 12.
MVC web framework
Spring provides a rich, powerful web framework based on the 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The aim of the framework, like 
any other web framework, is to simplify web development. It allows a variety of 
different view technologies, such as JavaServer Pages, Velocity, and iText PDF 
to be used. You can use MVC with Spring's other services, such as AOP and IoC. 
Furthermore, Spring can be integrated with other web frameworks, including Struts, 
WebWork, Tapestry, and JSF. Discussing Spring's web framework is beyond this 
book's scope. However, we will take a quick look at it, along with its alternatives, to 
give you a sense of how, in practice, Spring can be used to make web development 
easier and solve typical problems related to web applications.
Chapter 14 explains in detail the different strategies Spring offers for supporting 
web frameworks.
Testing support
Spring applications are more readily testable than other applications. This is because 
Spring applications rely on POJOs, which do not call any Spring APIs, and their 
dependencies are normally expressed in the form of interfaces that are easy to stub or 
mock. Moreover, Spring provides some useful helper classes for implementing test 
classes that test an application's interaction with Spring.
Moreover, Spring provides a lightweight container against traditional full-blown JEE 
containers. The container provided by Spring can easily be started from the JUnit test 
itself, which is not easy to do with EJB-3 and a JEE container.
Chapter 15 looks at using Spring's testing abilities to test Hibernate and 
Spring applications.

An Introduction to Hibernate and Spring
[ 28 ]
Summary
This chapter looked at Hibernate's background and explored how the framework 
provides a bridge between the object-oriented and relational worlds. This is why 
Hibernate is called an O/R mapping tool.
Enterprise JavaBeans are server-side components which provide another approach to 
persisting Java objects. In addition, enterprise beans provide declarative middleware 
services, such as transaction and security. Developing with enterprise beans is 
not as easy as developing with Hibernate, and using entity beans also requires an 
application server, which is difficult to set up, run, and test.
Hibernate architecture consists of three contributors: persistent objects, configuration 
file(s), and mapping definitions. The Hibernate API comes with three Java interfaces 
which are always involved in persisting the objects. These are org.hibernate.
Session, org.hibernate.SessionFactory, and org.hibernate.Transaction.

Preparing an Application to 
Use Spring with Hibernate
Hibernate, like many other frameworks, must be configured before you can 
use it. However, its configuration is very simple and straightforward. Besides 
configuration, some other settings are required to use Hibernate. These include 
setting up a database, creating the application structure, and adding extra 
frameworks, such as Log4j and Ant to the project.
In this chapter, we will discuss the prerequisites to developing with Hibernate. The 
chapter explains the configuration steps, based on the priority you should take in 
a typical application. Note that, not all steps are mandatory when using Hibernate. 
However, taking the optional steps is highly recommended.
We'll start our discussion by setting up a database. Choosing a database may depend 
on your application requirements, such as robustness, performance, and price, and 
on other special features that your application needs. Fortunately, as a persistence 
service provider, Hibernate supports a range of databases, allowing you to choose a 
database that you prefer, or as your application requirements dictate. This book uses 
a simple, lightweight database, HSQLDB, for its examples.
After you've set up a database, the next step is getting a Hibernate distribution. Next, 
set up the project hierarchy, which includes creating source and build directories, 
installing a build framework (such as Ant), configuring Hibernate, and finally 
adding the Hibernate libraries, the database driver, and any other frameworks 
to the application classpath.
Lets discuss these steps in more detail.

Preparing an Application to Use Spring with Hibernate
[ 30 ]
Setting up the database
Whether or not you are using Hibernate in your application, you need a database to 
store your application data. Therefore, your first step is to set up and run a database. 
Although there are no restrictions in choosing a database when you use Hibernate, 
we will use a simple, lightweight database called HSQLDB in this book. This lets 
us concentrate on Hibernate and explore its features, without getting involved in 
database details.
Getting and installing HSQLDB
HSQLDB is an open-source database that has been fully developed in the Java 
language. It's a small, lightweight database that is easy to install and use, and it 
is supported by Hibernate. To get HSQLDB, go to its home page at http://www.
hsqldb.org, and download the latest version in the form of a compressed file. To 
install, you only need to extract the file anywhere in your file system.
As the next sections explain, you must also put the database driver, hsqldb.jar, in 
the application classpath.
Configuring and running HSQLDB
Although HSQLDB supports different types of databases, and has many features 
that make it flexible and reliable, discussing HSQLDB in detail is beyond this book's 
scope. However, to proceed, we need some primary information about HSQLDB 
and its configuration. Interested readers can get more information by studying the 
documentation packed with its download.
Extract the compressed file somewhere on your file system. After extracting the 
compressed file, you need to configure HSQLDB before you can use it. Configuring 
HSQLDB is easy and straightforward. It is simply performed through a properties 
file, which includes all of the configuration information.
Create the server.properties file with the following content in C:/hsqldb, the 
directory where you've installed HSQLDB:
# Filename: C:\hsqldb\server.properties
# Hibernate examples database - create a database on the default port.
# Specifies the path to the database files – 
# note that the trailing slash IS required.
server.database.0=file:/hsqldb/hibernate/
# Specifies the name of the database
server.dbname.0=hiberdb

Chapter 2
[ 31 ]
The properties file entries represent the configuration arguments of the HSQLDB 
database. In our case, the file includes only two entries:
server.database: This entry determines the relative path of the database 
inside the HSQLDB root directory.
server.dbname: This entry assigns a name to the specified database, by 
which we can then refer to the database.
Note the use of 0 at the end of the server.database and server.dbname properties. 
This number specifies the index of the database being configured and is incremented 
for the second database, and so on.
HSQLDB server modes
HSQLDB can run in different modes based on the protocol used for communications 
between the client and server. The following list gives a brief review on the different 
server modes that HSQLDB supports:
Hsqldb server: The fastest way for running a database server, this mode uses 
a proprietary communications protocol.
Hsqldb web server: This mode is used when access to the computer hosting 
the database server is restricted to the HTTP protocol. The only reason for 
using this mode is restrictions imposed by firewalls on the client or server 
machines. It should not be used where there are no such restrictions.
Hsqldb servlet: This uses the same protocol as the web server. It is used 
when a separate servlet engine (or application server), such as Tomcat or 
Resin, provides access to the database. Since the database server sits on the 
servlet engine to be used, this mode cannot be used without a servlet engine.
In-process (stand-alone) mode: This mode runs the database engine as part 
of your application program in the same Java Virtual Machine. For most 
applications, this mode can be faster, as the data is not converted and sent 
over the network. The main drawback is that, by default, it is not possible 
to connect to the database from outside your application. As a result, you 
cannot check the contents of the database with external tools while your 
application is running.
Memory-only databases: In this mode, HSQLDB holds the data entirely in 
memory without persisting it to disk. Since this mode does not use the disk, 
it is useful only for internal processing of application data, such as applets.
The HSQLDB documentation, which is packed with its distribution, is the best 
reference for more detailed information about these modes.

[ 32 ]
After preparing the server.properties file, run the following command from the 
same directory as the server.properties file, in order to run HSQLDB in the mode 
of server:
java -classpath c:/hsqldb/lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server
This command starts HSQLDB, and the following output is displayed in the 
command window:
C:\hsqldb>java -classpath c:/hsqldb/lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.Server
[Server@1a758cb]: [Thread[main,5,main]]: checkRunning(false) entered
[Server@1a758cb]: [Thread[main,5,main]]: checkRunning(false) exited
[Server@1a758cb]: Startup sequence initiated from main() method
[Server@1a758cb]: Loaded properties from [C:\hsqldb\server.properties]
[Server@1a758cb]: Initiating startup sequence...
[Server@1a758cb]: Server socket opened successfully in 211 ms.
[Server@1a758cb]: Database [index=0, id=0, db=file:/hsqldb/hibernate/, 
alias=hiberdb] opened sucessfully in 1702 ms.
[Server@1a758cb]: Startup sequence completed in 2053 ms.
[Server@1a758cb]: 2008-09-03 11:42:23.327 HSQLDB server 1.8.0 is online
[Server@1a758cb]: To close normally, connect and execute SHUTDOWN SQL
[Server@1a758cb]: From command line, use [Ctrl]+[C] to abort abruptly
You can shut down the server with the SHUTDOWN SQL command, issued as an SQL 
query, in the Database Manager (covered in the next section).
You can also shut down the HSQLDB server by terminating its process, done easily 
by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl and C keys. However, this method is clean and 
safe, because HSQLDB is not allowed to complete its tasks (for example, storing all 
data in memory to disk and closing the database files) in a persistent and safe way.
Now that we have successfully executed HSQLDB, we can continue our work by 
creating the tables that we need.
Managing HSQLDB
The HSQLDB distribution ships with a utility application called Database Manager. 
Database Manager is a tool for managing the database schemas to create, edit, or 
delete tables, and perform many other database operations. To run this application, 
go to the demo directory and execute the runManagerSwing.bat batch file. You'll 
then see a window like the following one:

Chapter 2
[ 33 ]
In the application's input dialog, enter the driver class name, URL, username, and 
password of the database, as shown in the following table:
Option
Value
Setting Name
hibernate-exercise
Type
HSQL Database Engine Server
Driver
org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
URL
jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb
User
sa
Password
--
Notice that we've chosen HSQL Database Engine Server as the value for the Type 
option. The Type option determines what kind of server you want to run.
sa and blank are the default values for username and password when you create a 
schema in HSQLDB. Although these are enough for our application, you can create 
new accounts, as well. Please see HSQLDB's website for more information.
hiberdb is the name of the database schema that we have already defined in the 
server.properties file (and we use that for the examples in this book). After you've 
entered the information, click OK and connect to the specified database schema.
The manager then lets you enter the SQL statements in the top section of this 
window. You can then execute them by clicking the Execute button.

Preparing an Application to Use Spring with Hibernate
[ 34 ]
Getting a Hibernate distribution
To use Hibernate in your application, you first need to get it. Therefore, browse to 
the homepage of Hibernate at http://www.hibernate.org, choose the Hibernate 
Core package, and download the latest version in the form of a .zip or .tar.gz 
compressed file.
Extract the compressed file in a directory on your system. This directory will include 
the Hibernate library hibernate3.jar, optional and required JAR files in the lib 
subdirectory, and Hibernate documentation in the doc subdirectory.
Getting a Spring distribution
As with Hibernate, you must download the full distribution version of Spring 
from its website: http://www.springframework.org. The file, which downloads 
as a .zip or .tar.zip file, contains separate JAR files as Spring libraries in the 
dist/modules subdirectory. (The number of JAR files depends on the version of 
Spring.) Each JAR file contains classes of a particular Spring module. For instance, 
spring-aop.jar contains all of the classes you need to use Spring's AOP features in 
your application. Although not all of these JAR files are required when you are using 
Spring with Hibernate, you can simply add all of them to the project lib directory.
Setting up the project hierarchy
Now that  all of the prerequisites for application development are ready, it's time to 
set up the project. In this section, we'll look at a general project structure that you can 
apply to your Spring and Hibernate projects. We'll use this structure in the examples 
throughout this book.
As the first step, we'll set up the project hierarchy, which includes building the basic 
directories and creating the needed files. The project hierarchy depends on your 
application type and the frameworks that your application uses. As a developer, you 
should note that the basis of your development is providing a clean environment, in 
which all files are classified, and where you always have full control of changes as 
the application grows. Here, we'll see a typical application structure that satisfies the 
most typical application requirements.
First, create and name the application work directory. This directory contains all 
of the application source files, build files, script files, and so on. This directory can 
include the following subdirectories:
www.allitebooks.com

Chapter 2
[ 35 ]
src for the application source files
out for the compiled classes
test for unit tests
lib for libraries used by the application
If you are working on a web application, such as the sample application discussed in 
this book, you may need an additional directory in src. The following figure shows a 
sample layout for this directory:
The build.xml and pom.xml files, which are the Ant and Maven files respectively, 
and other configuration files (such as log4j.properties for configuring logging) 
should be placed in the application's root directory. You must also add all of the 
necessary JAR library files, such as hibernate.jar, spring.jar, the database 
driver, and so on, to the application classpath.
Put the required libraries in the lib directory
Since you are developing a Hibernate with Spring project, you need to put their 
libraries, and also their dependencies, in your project. Therefore, when you create 
the structure of your project, put Hibernate.jar with its dependencies, and 
spring.jar with its required dependencies. Please note that with Hibernate you 
need almost all dependencies, but since Spring is a general and throughout project, 
you may just need a subset of Spring dependencies. A typical lib directory of a 
Hibernate with Spring project may look like the following:
+lib
    antlr.jar
    asm.jar
    asm-attrs.jars
    c3p0.jar
    cglib.jar
    commons-collections.jar
    commons-logging.jar
    dom4j.jar

    slf4j-api-1.5.0.jar
    slf4j-log4j12-1.5.0.jar
    spring.jar
Setting up Ant or Maven in the project
As the next step, you need a build framework in your project, to automatic the build 
and test process. The common solutions for this are the Ant and Maven projects. 
Ant is one of the most popular frameworks in the Java world, and plays an essential 
role in Java applications. It provides an automatic and reliable build process for 
your application, allowing you to define a repeatable and reliable build process in 
XML format. Maven is another build framework with a somewhat similar role in 
Java applications, but does more than what Ant does. Maven can manage the project 
dependencies and resolve them in sophisticated projects, which may consist of many 
other libraries and projects. Almost all of today's projects use Maven as the build 
framework, so using Maven is preferred over Ant. Here, adding and setting up both 
frameworks are briefly discussed. First, let's look at Ant.
To get Ant, go to http://ant.apache.org and download the latest version. Then, 
extract the compressed zip file in a directory in your file system.
To complete the installation process, you need to perform the following two tasks:
1.	 Define the ANT_HOME variable (which points to the Ant's root directory) as an 
environment variable.
2.	 Add Ant's bin subdirectory to the system or command line path.
To check whether Ant has been installed correctly, run the ant command in a 
command window. You should see the following output:
> ant -version
Apache Ant version 1.6.1 compiled on February 12 2004
The message identifies your version of Ant.
The build process for any application accomplished by Ant is defined in an XML file. 
This file, usually called the build file or the Ant file, starts with the XML definition 
and is followed by a <project> element as root. All of the process steps are defined 
inside the project through target elements, one of which is the default.

Chapter 2
[ 37 ]
Targets contain task elements and can depend on other targets. For example, you 
might have a target for compiling, and a target for creating a distributable archive file. 
As you can only build the distributable file after you have compiled the source code, 
the distribute target depends on the compile target. Ant resolves these dependencies.
I won't go into detail here, since Ant is fairly straightforward and widely used. 
To get more information about Ant, refer to its excellent documentation at 
http://ant.apache.org/manual.
To get Maven, go to http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html and 
download the latest version. Similar to Ant, you need to perform two other tasks 
as follows to complete the installation:
1.	 Add the Maven's bin directory to the system or command line path.
2.	 Increase the memory available to Maven with setting MAVEN_OPTS -Xms128m 
-Xmx512m=
Whether you are using Ant or Maven, you need to define a 
system property, JAVA_HOME, which refers to the root of the 
JDK installation directory.
To get more information about Maven and its usage, refer to Maven website at 
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html.
Summary
This chapter demonstrated the basic steps for preparing to use Hibernate. The first 
step is to install and run a database engine. HSQLDB is a simple, lightweight, and 
easy-to-use open-source database. Therefore, it lets us learn Hibernate without 
getting involved in database details.
After setting up a database, the next steps are getting Hibernate and setting up the 
project hierarchy. Although there are some templates for the application structure, 
this structure mostly depends on the application you are working on.
Getting Ant or Maven and adding them to the project are the next steps. Ant is a 
utility project that provides an automatic build process. To start using Ant, extract 
Ant in a directory, set up the ANT_HOME variable in your system properties, add its 
bin subdirectory to the System PATH, and create and set up a build file. Maven is 
another project which is used to build the project and manage project dependencies. 
Like Ant, to use Maven, you need to set up the MAVEN_HOME variable in the system 
properties and add its bin subdirectory to the PATH of the system.


A Quick Tour of Hibernate 
and Spring 
Getting started with a new framework is often the most difficult part of learning 
it. In our case, there are two frameworks to learn, both integrated with each 
other, containing many details, and used for different purposes in the application 
architecture. Therefore, before we dig into the details, it's important to understand 
how to use these frameworks within the context in which they operate. With this 
understanding in place, you'll learn the details more smoothly, with a less steep 
learning curve.
This chapter provides a quick look at different aspects of persistence that typically 
arise during application development. We'll discuss how Hibernate handles 
these cases and simplifies development of the persistence layer. We'll then look at 
the aspects of Spring that are involved in the persistence area of the application 
architecture. Because the main goal of this chapter is to demonstrate the basic usage 
of Hibernate and Spring, simple examples will explain Hibernate's and Spring's basic 
features without presenting anything complicated. First, I'll use a simple Java class, a 
simple database table, and a simple mapper class to explain the core Hibernate API 
and the basic steps in using Hibernate. After that, when we discuss the fundamental 
concepts behind Hibernate, we'll look at other aspects, including the mapping of 
objects association and inheritance, querying persistent objects, object relations and 
navigability, managing transactions, lazy loading, caching, and practical Hibernate 
configuration. At the end of this chapter, I'll review two basic features of Spring: 
Inversion of Control (IoC) and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), looking 
at how these are used in mixed Hibernate-Spring applications.

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 40 ]
Getting started with Hibernate
Hibernate may be used in many different situations. It can be used when you're 
developing a new application from scratch, extending an existing application, or 
developing a new application which works with an existing database schema.
Usually, it's best to develop a new Hibernate application from scratch since you 
can design your database schema flexibly, based on application requirements 
and Hibernate best practices. When you use an existing schema in developing an 
application, you must work with the schema, which is not necessarily consistent 
with new requirements, so you must make "dirty" changes simply to make the 
application work. However, when the database schema exists, utility tools can help 
you to analyze the schema and guide you in designing appropriate Java classes that 
represent the data.
Here, we'll start with the simplest case and discuss how to start a new Hibernate 
application from scratch. When you're developing a new Hibernate application, after 
you have configured it, you should do the following three things:
Design and implement persistent classes, which represent the application's 
live data: The business processes inside the application design and produce 
persistent objects. In fact, they contain significant information to be kept 
in a persistent store for future use. As the first step in developing a new 
Hibernate application, you need to design the object model with which the 
application works.
Design and create database tables: This step involves designing the 
database schema that encompasses the live data. Most of the time, tables in 
the database schema correspond to each class in the object model and are 
designed to hold the data contained by these objects.
Creating mapping metadata: Mapping metadata is the data, defined in 
the Java code as annotations or in XML documents as individual files, 
that describes the relationship of persistent classes to database tables. This 
metadata tells Hibernate how to map the object model to its respective 
database schema.
Upcoming chapters discuss all of these steps in detail. Throughout this book, I present 
a sample application, a comprehensive educational system, to demonstrate how to 
perform these steps in a real application. This demo application manages information 
related to all schools, teachers, students, and courses in an educational system. It 
provides add, edit, and delete operations for teachers, students, and courses, and 
handles the associated business rules. In this and the subsequent chapters, individual 
parts of this application will explain working with Hibernate in detail.

Chapter 3
[ 41 ]
Designing and implementing persistent 
classes
As you remember from Chapter 1, Student objects can be persisted into the STUDENT 
table. Although there would be other persistent classes such as Course, Teacher, 
and School in our application, we will not involve those here in order to keep our 
example as simple as possible.
The Student class looks like the code here:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  //zero-arguement constructor
  public Student() {
  }
  public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public int getId() {
    return id;
  }
  public void setId(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstName;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
  public String getLastName() {
    return lastName;
  }
  public void setLastName(String lastName) {
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (this == o) return true;
      if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 42 ]
    Student student = (Student) o;
    if (id != student.id) return false;
    if (firstName != null ? !firstName.equals(student.firstName) :
                student.firstName != null) return false;
    if (lastName != null ? !lastName.equals(student.lastName) : 
                student.lastName != null) return false;
    return true;
  }
  public int hashCode() {
    int result;
    result = id;
    result = 29 * result + (firstName != null ? firstName.hashCode()
     : 0);
    result = 29 * result + (lastName != null ? lastName.hashCode()
     : 0);
    return result;
  }
}
This class has simple properties: id, firstName, and lastName, all private, and 
accessed by their setter and getter methods.
Classes with no special behavior, only containing some properties 
with their setter and getter methods, are called Plain Old Java Object 
(POJO). POJO classes have critical roles in many new frameworks such 
as Hibernate and Spring. All of the persistent objects that are stored or 
retrieved by Hibernate are POJOs. POJO rules, and characteristics of 
Hibernate persistent classes, are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
This class also has a zero-argument constructor. This is an optional 
(and recommended) requirement that persistent classes in Hibernate 
should meet. Chapter 5 discusses this and other requirements for persistent 
classes in Hibernate.
Creating Database Tables
Now that the Student class has been designed and implemented, we need a table 
in the database to store the student objects. Usually, there should be a database 
table corresponding to each persistent class for the persistence of related objects. 
The following screenshot shows the STUDENT table with the columns in the 
hiberdb database schema, which was set up in Chapter 2.

Chapter 3
[ 43 ]
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
BIGINT, PK
VARCHAR(50)
VARCHAR(50)
STUDENT
The SQL expression used to create this table is shown below:
create table STUDENT (
       ID bigint generated by default as identity (start with 1),
       FIRST_NAME varchar(50),
       LAST_NAME varchar(50),
       primary key (ID)
)
We may use the HSQL Database Manager to create the table, as shown here:
If your query syntax is invalid, or if the manager application is unable to execute the 
query, a dialog box reports the query execution failure.
If you are developing an application from scratch, you can use 
SchemaExport, shipped with Hibernate, to generate your schema from 
the mappings. Additionally, it is also possible to use SchemaUpdate to 
update an existing schema based on the modified mappings.

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 44 ]
Creating mapping metadata
After you've designed the Student class and created the STUDENT table, you need 
to give Hibernate information about the mapping between the Student class fields 
and the STUDENT table columns. For this purpose, Hibernate lets you use either 
XML documents, as individual mapping files, or annotations in the Java code. The 
mapping metadata specifies how to map a persistent class to a database table. In this 
book, I discuss using both approaches: annotations are newer and are used more, but 
the XML approach isn't still deprecated. 
In our example, we can use an XML file to define how each Student property is 
stored, retrieved, updated, and removed from a STUDENT column when a Student 
instance is stored, retrieved, updated, or removed from the database.
As a mapping file, Student.hbm.xml tells Hibernate that id, firstName, and 
lastName of the Student class should be stored, in the respective ID, FIRST_NAME, 
and LAST_NAME columns of the STUDENT table. The following listing shows this file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
       "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
       "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.Student"
    table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="id">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>	
    <property name="lastName" column="LAST_NAME" type="string"/>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As a convention, it's recommended to name the mapping files as className.hbm.
xml, in which className is the name of the matching persistent class. It's also 
recommended that each mapping file be placed in the same package as its persistent 
class. This simplifies the use of Hibernate and helps with application maintenance. 
For instance, if the Student class's package is com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch03, then Student.hbm.xml would be in the com/packtpub/springhibernate/
ch03 directory with the Student class. This approach lets you manage mapping files 
based on the packages of their respective persistent classes.

Chapter 3
[ 45 ]
The content of all mapping files begins with the XML version and encoding 
identifiers, followed by a DOCTYPE declaration:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
       "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0//EN"
       "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
The DOCTYPE instruction identifies the document type definition of the mapping 
document. As we use Hibernate 3 in this book, the DOCTYPE instruction refers to 
hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd. If you use a different version of Hibernate, specify 
the corresponding DTD document in the same way.
After DOCTYPE, the <hibernate-mapping> element is the root element and specifies 
the actual mappings. Inside the root element, at least one <class> element should 
exist. Each <class> element defines the mapping of a persistent class to a database 
table. For our sample application, we use a nested <class> element inside the root 
to determine the mapping of our persistent class, Student, to its respective 
table, STUDENT:
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE … >
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As we currently have only one class, Student, we have used only one <class> 
element inside the mapping document. However, when there are more persistent 
classes in the application, you can use other <class> elements inside the root 
element to map them to their respective tables.
The <class> element comes with two attributes: name and table. These attributes 
specify, respectively, the fully qualified class name you want to map, and the 
database tables to which persistent objects are mapped:
<class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.Student"
 table="STUDENT">
The <class> element and its nested elements specify all relevant information needed 
to map the persistent class to its database table.

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 46 ]
The <id> element, coming as the first element inside <class>, uses the name, type, 
and column attributes to indicate the object identifier name, the corresponding 
Hibernate type for that identifier, and the table's primary key column which holds 
the object identifier respectively. Additionally, the <id> element uses a nested 
<generator> element to determine the Hibernate strategy for generating identifier 
values. The following code shows the <id> element with its attributes and nested 
<generator> element:
<id name="id" type="int" column="id">
  <generator class="increment"/>
</id>
A Hibernate type is a representation of the SQL type of the column in 
which the property's value is stored. Hibernate uses these values when 
it generates an SQL query to insert, update, delete, or perform any other 
persistence operations. These types may also be used when the database 
schema is generated from the mapping definitions. Hibernate types let the 
application be isolated from the underlying database's actual SQL types. 
At runtime, Hibernate types may be transformed to different SQL types 
when different database engines are used with Hibernate. Hibernate 
types are fully discussed in Chapter 7.
The nested <generator> element specifies how to generate an identifier value for a 
new instance when the instance is stored. The value of the class attribute refers to a 
Hibernate-included algorithm, according to which the identifier is generated. In this 
case, we have chosen increment as the identifier generation strategy. This means 
every identifier must be produced by incrementing the preceding one. Chapter 5 
explains this and other algorithms.
After <id>, <property> elements appear as the next elements inside <class>, and 
define the mapping of other class properties to table columns. Every <property> 
element commonly comes with three attributes: name, column, and type, which 
specify the name of the property, the table column, and the column's Hibernate 
type respectively:
<property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
<property name="lastName" column="LAST_NAME" type="string"/>
Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 offer in-depth discussions of mapping concepts.

A simple client
Now that we've completed all three steps in designing and developing our Hibernate 
project, which currently consists of only the Student class, the STUDENT table, and 
the Student.hbm.xml file, the Hibernate API can interact with the database and 
persist the objects.
The following listing shows an immature use of Hibernate to store an instance of the 
Student class into the STUDENT table:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
public class PersistByHibernate {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    //configuring Hibernate
    Configuration config = new Configuration();
    config.setProperty("hibernate.dialect",
                       "org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect");
    config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.driver_class",
                       "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
    config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.url",
                       "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb");
    config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.username", "sa");
    config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.password", "");
    //introducing persistent classes to Hibernate
    config.addClass(Student.class);
    //obtaining a session object
    SessionFactory factory = config.buildSessionFactory();
    Session session = factory.openSession();
    //starting a transaction
    Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
    //persisting…
    Student student = new Student("Andrew", "White");
    session.save(student);
    //commiting the transaction
    tx.commit();
    session.close();
  }
}

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 48 ]
The class shown in the previous code uses Hibernate to save an instance of Student. 
The process for all persisting operations, including save, load, update, and delete, 
consists of the following steps:
1.	 Configuring Hibernate.
2.	 Obtaining a Session object.
3.	 Starting the transaction.
4.	 Performing persistence operation(s).
5.	 Committing or rolling back the transaction.
The next several sections cover these steps.
Configuring Hibernate
Before you can interact with Hibernate and perform any persistence operations, 
you need to configure it. The basic configuration includes specifying the database 
driver, URL, username, password, and dialect (discussed in upcoming chapters). It 
also includes introducing the persistent class names or their mappings. All of these 
settings are represented by a configuration object of type org.hibernate.cfg.
Configuration.
To set each property value, the Configuration class provides a setProperty() 
method, which takes two arguments: the property name and the property value, 
seen here:
public Configuration setProperty(String propertyName, String
  propertyValue)
For instance, invoking:
config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.driver_class",
  "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
sets org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver as the value of hibernate.connection.driver_
class. The Configuration class also provides the addClass() method, which 
introduces a persistent class to Hibernate:
public Configuration addClass(Class aClass) throws MappingException
Note that, both setProperty() and addClass() return an object of type 
Configuration, allowing you to set properties by invoking a chain of 
setProperty() or addClass() methods. I cover configuration in more 
detail in Chapter 4.

Chapter 3
[ 49 ]
Obtaining a session object
With Hibernate, all persisting operations, including save, load, update, and delete, 
are performed through instances of org.hibernate.Session. As you will see, 
these instances are not thread-safe. Session objects are not instantiated directly. 
Instead, they are constructed by invoking the openSession() method of another 
object called a session factory. A session factory is a heavyweight object of type 
org.hibernate.SessionFactory. This object is thread-safe and responsible for 
creating and managing session objects. It's analogous to a connection pool, which is 
responsible for creating and managing database connection objects. Note that typical 
applications need only one SessionFactory object for each database they use. 
Chapter 4 gives an example of how to maintain this condition.
Like Session objects, SessionFactory is not instantiated directly. Instead, 
it is constructed by invoking the buildSessionFactory() method of the 
Configuration object that has already been created.
The following snippet shows the process of obtaining instances of SessionFactory 
and Session:
//obtaining a session object
SessionFactory factory = config.buildSessionFactory();
Session session = factory.openSession();
Starting a transaction
Transaction management is an essential requirement in any application. It lets you 
reliably perform a set of operations, as a unit of work. Both Hibernate and JDBC 
let you mark the boundaries of a set of persistence operations to be performed as 
a unit of work, whether all operations are done successfully or all are failed. In 
Hibernate, you can call the beginTransaction() method of Session to obtain an 
instance of type org.hibernate.Transaction. The Transaction object, in fact, is a 
handler which lets you control the transaction execution, commit, or roll back when 
persistence operations are done.
Hibernate automatically starts the transaction when the beginTransaction() 
method of Session is invoked as follows:
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
//performing operations
As the next section discusses, the started transaction should be committed or rolled 
back after the persistence operation is done.

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 50 ]
Performing the operation
After the transaction has begun, you can perform any desired persistence operations 
with Hibernate. For this purpose, you can use the Session instance, which provides 
distinct persistence methods, including save(), update(), saveOrUpdate(), and 
so on. The Session API and persistence methods exposed through it are discussed in 
Chapter 8.
Committing/rolling back the transaction
When persistence operations are performed, you can decide to commit or roll back 
the already started transaction by invoking the commit() or rollback() method of 
Transaction, respectively, as follows:
//decide to commit
if(every_thing_is_ok)
  tx.commit();
else //roll back
  tx.rollback();
Although, database operations always happen inside transactions (so you need to 
manage transactions in your Hibernate application when persistence operations 
are performed), you can leave transaction management to the database engine by 
setting the connection.autocommit property to true in the configuration file, or 
invoking the setAutoCommit(true) of the associated Connection object to Session 
as follows:
session.connection().setAutoCommit(true);
Then, you will not need to start and then commit or roll back the transaction. The 
database automatically handles transactions and performs every operation in a 
single transaction.
Using auto-commit is mostly impossible. There are common situations 
in a typical project that a persistent operation in the application 
is performed with two or more database operations together. 
Therefore, we need to manage transactions in the application 
for each application-level operation.
Chapter 10 discusses transaction management in detail.

Chapter 3
[ 51 ]
Hibernate declarative configuration
As with many other frameworks, you must configure Hibernate before you can use 
it. The configuration process consists of two parts:
Object Mappings: Determine the object mappings that define how persistent 
objects are mapped to their respective database tables.
Database-Relevant Information: Specify database-relevant information 
to tell Hibernate how to connect to the database and perform persistence 
operations. The basic configuration information is database driver, URL, 
username, and password. However, configuration options are not limited 
to these. Other significant configuration settings include using a container-
managed versus a non-container-managed data source, cache configuration, 
transaction settings, minimum and maximum pool size, and connection 
timeout value.
Earlier, we configured Hibernate programmatically. However, that approach is 
not flexible enough to be used in a real project. Hibernate supports a declarative 
approach for configuration, which makes it more flexible. You can configure 
Hibernate declaratively, either through a properties file, or an XML file. The 
following code is a sample configuration file named Hibernate.cfg.xml:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration SYSTEM
  "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-configuration>
  <session-factory>
    <!-- database related configurations -->
    <property name="connection.driver_class">
      org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    </property>
    <property name="connection.url">
      jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb
    </property>
    <property name="connection.username">sa</property>
    <property name="connection.password"> </property>
    <property name="pool_size">5</property>
    <property name="connection.autocommit">true</property>
    <property name="show_sql">true</property>
    <property name="dialect">
        org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect</property>
    <!-- mapping files-->
    <mapping
     resource="com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch03/Student.hbm.xml"/>
  </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 52 ]
As you can see, configuration values are determined through <property> and 
<mapping> elements. Each <property> element specifies a particular property 
of Hibernate.
The following table explains the properties in the configuration file shown in the 
listing above.
Property name
Meaning
connection.driver_class
refers to the database driver class name
connection.url
specifies the database's URL
connection.username
connection.password
determines the database username and password
pool_size
specifies the number of connection objects held in the 
connection pool
connection.autocommit
specifies whether each database operation is 
performed in an individual transaction and is 
committed automatically
show_sql
determines whether Hibernate-generated SQL 
statements are shown in either the application console 
or the logging files
dialect
specifies the database dialect used to connect to the 
database (the dialect concept is discussed in the 
next chapter)
The last part of the configuration file configures the mapping files. As mentioned, 
Hibernate uses these files to map persistent classes to database tables. Each <mapping> 
element takes a resource attribute, which refers to the relative path of the mapping 
file. For example, the following mapping element specifies Student.hbm.xml, which is 
located in the com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03 relative path:
<mapping
 resource="com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch03/Student.hbm.xml"/>
The application's root directory commonly holds the Hibernate configuration file, 
although you don't have to follow this practice. To configure Hibernate when this 
file is in the root of the classpath, simply instantiate an object of the org.hibernate.
cfg.Configuration class and invoke its configure() method:
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.configure();
Hibernate then automatically loads the defined settings in the configuration file.

Chapter 3
[ 53 ]
When the configuration file is not in the root, specify the relative path of the file as 
the configure() method's argument:
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.configure("relative path");
Configuration details are discussed in Chapter 4.
Some issues in mapping
So far, we have used a simple persistent class, Student, in our example. As 
mentioned in Chapter 1, most persistent classes are not so simple. Many are not 
plain as they may be inherited from or associated with others. As a persistence 
provider, Hibernate should handle these cases. We'll see more about this in Chapter 
5. For now, let's look at how Hibernate caches objects, and how to query the objects 
we've mapped.
Caching
Regarding performance enhancement, Hibernate provides two caches, each in a 
different level. As the first-level cache, each Session object has its own cache, which is 
also called transactional cache. This cache holds the persistent objects of Session, and 
minimizes database interactions, thereby enhancing efficiency and performance.
A third-party cache provider provides the second-level cache, which is configured as 
a plug-in in Hibernate. The second-level cache holds the repetitive persistent objects 
associated with all session objects. The following screenshot depicts the role of these 
two cache levels in Hibernate:
Application
Hibernate
Database
L2 Cache
Session
L1 Cache

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 54 ]
When the application queries a persistent object, the Session instance initially checks 
the first-level cache. If the object is not found, the instance checks the second-level 
cache. If the object is not found in either the first-level or the second-level cache, it is 
loaded from the database. Hibernate does not provide any way to enable or disable the 
first-level cache. However, the second-level cache is optional, so you can ignore it or 
configure Hibernate using any third-party cache provider. You can enable or disable 
the second-level cache through general Hibernate configuration (for all persistent 
objects), or in the mapping definitions (for particular objects).
Chapter 12 discusses Hibernate caching.
Querying objects
You can use the load() and get() methods of the Session instance to load a 
particular persistent object. For example, you can use the load() method as follows 
to load a Student instance with identifier value 41:
Student std = (Student) session.load(Student.class, new Long(41));
You can also use HQL to load persistent objects. With HQL, you can describe the 
objects you are looking for with the from and where clauses, as with SQL. The 
following statement simply queries the Student object with the identifier value 41:
List result = session.find("from Student as s where s.id=41");
The result is a java.util.List object, which contains the Student instance 
associated with identifier value 41. Using HQL, you can specify conditions other 
than the object identifier for the objects being loaded, or you can load many objects 
instead of just one.
Hibernate also provides a rich query API, called the Criteria API, to 
programmatically describe the objects being loaded, and then load them. The 
following snippet shows the Criteria approach to load the Student instance 
with the identifier value 41:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.idEq(new Integer(41)));
List result = criteria.list();
As with HQL, the result object is a java.util.List object, which contains the 
Student instance associated with the identifier value 41.
Although HQL and the Criteria API are interchangeable, in most cases, HQL is a 
better fit than Criteria, and in particular cases Criteria may fit better than HQL. 
All of these approaches are discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

Chapter 3
[ 55 ]
Getting started with Spring
Chapter 1 introduced the Spring services that are typically involved in an 
application's persistence tier. At its core, Spring provides Inversion of Control 
(IoC). This is the main functionality with which Spring aims to simplify application 
architecture. IoC affects all other services provided by Spring.
Here, we'll take a quick look at Spring IoC.
A simple case
In the educational system application, assume that a nonfunctional requirement 
indicates that before execution of any of the application classes setter methods, the 
setter method name, the old value, and the new value being set to the property 
are printed in the application console, a database table, or a log file, based on 
administrator preferences.
To handle this, the application uses three different classes, shown as follows;
SetterInfoConsolePrinter as this:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoConsolePrinter {
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    System.out.println("[Method=" + methodName +
                       "|Old Value=" + oldValue +
                       "|New Value=" + newValue+"]");
  }
}
SetterInfoDBPrinter as this:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoDBPrinter {
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    //connect to database and insert the information
  }
}
SetterInfoLogPrinter as this: 
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoLogPrinter {
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    //insert the method information in the log file
  }
}

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 56 ]
As you can see, all of these classes contain a common print() method, which prints 
the setter method runtime arguments. (To keep the example simple, I have shown 
only the implementation of SetterInfoConsolePrinter.) All of the application 
classes setter methods use one of these three printer classes to print their information. 
For instance, the Student class that uses the SetterInfoConsolePrinter class looks 
like this:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private SetterInfoConsolePrinter printer = new
  SetterInfoConsolePrinter();
  //zero-argument
  public Student() {
  }
  public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public void setId(int id) {
  printer.print("setId", this.id, id);
    this.id = id;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
  printer.print("setFirstName", this.firstName, firstName);
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
  public void setLastName(String lastName) {
  printer.print("setLastName", this.lastName, lastName);
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  //getter methods
  //hashCode() and equals() methods
}
Note that, we have intentionally not shown the getter, hashCode(), and equals() 
methods, which do not affect our example. In this case, it is obvious that if we want 
to change the printing strategy to use a different destination, we must change all 
classes and change the SetterInfoConsolePrinter class with an appropriate 
printer class.

Chapter 3
[ 57 ]
The code we have just implemented can be refactored by adding a 
SetterInfoPrinter interface and a SetterInfoPrinterFactory class. The 
SetterInfoPrinter outlines the print() method as the common method for 
all printer classes, and the SetterInfoPrinterFactory class acts as a factory for 
printer classes, allowing centralized control of the printer class instantiation. This is 
SetterInfoPrinter: 
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public interface SetterInfoPrinter {
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue);
}
And here is SetterInfoPrinterFactory:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoPrinterFactory {
  public static SetterInfoPrinter getSetterInfoPrinter(){
    return new SetterInfoConsolePrinter();      
  }
}
All printer classes now need to implement the SetterInfoPrinter interface, so we 
will have SetterInfoConsolePrinter as follows:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoConsolePrinter implements SetterInfoPrinter{
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    System.out.println("[Method=" + methodName +
                       "|Old Value=" + oldValue +
                       "|New Value=" + newValue+"]");
  }
}
And SetterInfoDBPrinter as this:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoDBPrinter implements SetterInfoPrinter{
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    //connect to database and insert the information
  }
}

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 58 ]
And SetterInfoLogPrinter as this:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class SetterInfoLogPrinter implements SetterInfoPrinter{
  public void print(String methodName, Object oldValue, Object
  newValue){
    //insert the method information in the log file
  }
}
The Student class, and other classes, can now use the SetterInfoPrinterFactory 
class to obtain a printer class. Here is the refactored Student class that uses 
SetterInfoPrinterFactory:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private SetterInfoPrinter printer;
  //zero-argument
  public Student() {
    printer = SetterInfoPrinterFactory.getSetterInfoPrinter();
  }
  public Student(String firstName, String lastName) { 
    this();
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public void setId(int id) {
    printer.print("setId", this.id, id);
    this.id = id;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
    printer.print("setFirstName", this.firstName, firstName);
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
  public void setLastName(String lastName) {
    printer.print("setLastName", this.lastName, lastName);
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  //getter methods
  //hashCode() and equals() methods
}

Chapter 3
[ 59 ]
In this class, we have replaced the instance of the concrete 
SetterInfoConsolePrinter with an instance of SetterInfoPrinter. The 
class constructor uses the SetterInfoPrinterFactory class to obtain a 
SetterInfoPrinter instance when the Student class is instantiated. The only other 
constructor class calls the default constructor to guarantee that the printer instance is 
always instantiated.
Now, our code is more manageable, that is, if the printing strategy changes, only 
SetterInfoPrinterFactory requires modification. The following code snippet 
shows a simple Java program that instantiates a Student object:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student student = new Student();
    student.setId(41);
    student.setFirstName("John");
    student.setLastName("White");
  }
}
The program's execution result is as follows:
[Method=setId|Old Value=0|New Value=41]
[Method=setFirstName|Old Value=null|New Value=John]
[Method=setLastName|Old Value=null|New Value=White]
Although the code we have developed so far works very well, there are still two 
maintenance problems:
Developers must worry about the SetterInfoPrinter instantiation in the 
constructor of the classes
Developers should be careful about invoking the print() method before 
setting a new value for each property
Let's see how Spring IoC can solve the first problem. The second problem is solved 
with Spring AOP, which is outside the scope of this chapter. However, you can read 
about the Spring AOP in Chapter 11.

[ 60 ]
Applying IoC
You can use IoC to eliminate the first problem: the SetterInfoPrinter instantiation 
when the Student instance is created. According to IoC, object instantiation can 
be accomplished by an outside object, instead of by the owner object. In our case, 
this means we can leave the SetterInfoPrinter instantiation to the Spring IoC 
container as an outside object, and always look up the Spring IoC container to 
obtain the Student instances.
In our example, applying IoC requires the following three steps:
1.	 Remove the SetterInfoPrinter instantiation from the Student constructor, 
and implement the setter method for the instance to be provided by the 
outside object.
2.	 Configure the Student object to be created and managed by the Spring 
container, so that Spring knows how to create Student instances and do the 
SetterInfoPrinter instantiation.
3.	 Obtain the configured Student instances from the Spring container instead 
of initializing them directly.
Let's see how to implement each step.
Remove object instantiation and implement the 
setter method
In the first step, you need to refactor the Student class so that the 
SetterInfoPrinter is not instantiated in the constructor and, instead, the setter 
method is implemented for the SetterInfoPrinter instance. Spring uses the setter 
method to provide an instantiated SetterInfoPrinter for the Student instance. 
The following code snippet shows the refactored Student class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
import java.io.Serializable;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private SetterInfoPrinter printer;
  //zero-arguement constructor
  public Student() {
    //no SetterInfoPrinter instantiation
  }

Chapter 3
[ 61 ]
  public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
    this();
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public void setId(int id) {
    printer.print("setId", this.id, id);
    this.id = id;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
    printer.print("setFirstName", this.firstName, firstName);
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
  public void setLastName(String lastName) {
    printer.print("setLastName", this.lastName, lastName);
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
  public SetterInfoPrinter getPrinter() {
    return printer;
  }
  public void setPrinter(SetterInfoPrinter printer) {
    this.printer = printer;
  }
  //getter methods
  //hashCode() and equals() methods
}
Configure the Student object
Next, configure the Student object so that Spring knows how to create and configure 
Student instances.
Spring uses an XML file called Spring context. This file includes information about 
all of the objects that are created and managed by Spring. Each object in this file is 
called a bean and is defined through the <bean> element. A simple Spring context, 
called spring-context.xml, which declares information only about the Student 
object, is shown as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
      xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
 http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 62 ]
  <bean id="student"
   class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.Student">
    <property name="printer">
      <bean
 class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.SetterInfoConsolePrinter"/>
    </property>
  </bean>
</beans>
Like any other XML file, this file starts with the XML declaration, specifying the 
XML version and the document encoding being used. The <beans> element is the 
root element in this file, which introduces the namespaces and the schema document 
according to how the document should be validated. The <beans> element includes 
the entire object configuration defined through individual <bean> elements. Each 
<bean> element declares an object that is created and managed by Spring. The 
<bean> element can come with two attributes: id and name. id assigns an identifier 
to the object, by which the object is identified in the Spring context and which the 
application uses to look up the object. The name attribute determines the concrete 
class from which the object must be instantiated. The <bean> element can nest with 
an arbitrary number of <property> elements; each one determines a property of the 
object that is created, managed, and set by Spring. The <property> element may 
either refer to another managed object inside the Spring context through the nested 
<ref> element, or may use a nested <bean> element to define the class from which 
the property is instantiated.
In our example, we have used the nested <bean> element, so we cannot reuse the 
SetterInfoConsolePrinter definition. However, it is possible to use the <ref> 
element if we want the object to be reused by other instances, as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd">
  <bean id="student"
   class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.Student">
    <property name="printer">
      <ref local="printer"/>
    </property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="printer" 
  class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03.SetterInfoConsolePrinter">
  </bean>
</beans>

Chapter 3
[ 63 ]
Obtain the Student instance from Spring
Finally, replace direct instantiation of the Student object with looking up and 
obtaining the object from Spring. The following shows the Main class, which now 
uses Spring to obtain the Student instance:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch03;
import org.springframework.context.support.
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                           "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch03/
                            spring-context.xml");
    Student student = (Student)ctx.getBean ("student");
    student.setId(41);
    student.setFirstName("John");
    student.setLastName("White");
  }
}
As you can see, we have used the ApplicationContext interface and an 
implementation of this interface, that is, ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, to 
interact with Spring. ClassPathXmlApplicationContext fires up the Spring IoC 
container with an XML context file in the application classpath. The constructor of 
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext takes the relative path of the Spring context 
file as a String argument. When the ClassPathXmlApplicationContext object 
is created, the getBean() method of the ApplicationContext instance, with the 
name of the object configured in the Spring context, is called to obtain the configured 
object. By executing the Main class, you can see the same result as when you do not 
use IoC.
As mentioned before, IoC allows you to manage the object dependencies 
at the development or maintenance time, and inject the dependencies 
at runtime. This functionality made IoC to be renamed with another 
descriptive name Dependency Injection (DI).
IoC is discussed more in depth in Chapter 10.

A Quick Tour of Hibernate and Spring 
[ 64 ]
Hibernate with Spring
As mentioned so far, Hibernate and Spring essentially are used for different 
purposes. Although there are many Spring features, including IoC, which make the 
Hibernate application more maintainable, the main feature of Spring in Hibernate 
applications is Aspect-Oriented Programming(AOP). AOP is an added feature to 
the traditional Object-Oriented programming. As you will see, this feature allows us 
to define common properties for a set of methods. In the case of Hibernate, suppose 
that there are a range of persistence methods that all need transaction management. 
AOP lets us to start transactions at the beginning of those methods and commit at 
the end, or roll back if any exception occurs during the method executions. The main 
benefit of this style of programming is using a declarative approach that, like IoC, 
makes the application clean, simple, and more maintainable.
We will discuss Spring's AOP in-depth in an individual chapter in this book.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the fundamental concepts behind using Hibernate and 
Spring. We started with a simple Student class. Next, we used an XML mapping 
document to define mapping of the class properties to the table columns. Then, we 
called Hibernate to persist a Student object.
You must configure Hibernate before you can use it. You can configure Hibernate 
either programmatically or declaratively. However, for flexibility and maintenance, 
the declarative approach is highly recommended.
Our discussion continued with other issues in object persistence, including object 
querying, caching, and transaction management.
Finally, we looked at the Spring IoC container. Spring provides IoC functionality in 
its core API, meaning that all other Spring services sit around IoC. IoC allows us to 
create and manage objects using the IoC container, instead of using the owner 
objects themselves.

Hibernate Configuration
In Chapter 3, we took a quick tour of the fundamental concepts behind Hibernate 
and Spring. In fact, the steps in using Hibernate do not require much beyond what 
you have already learned. However, since Hibernate provides a persistence service 
for many different environments, it has been designed to be flexible enough for 
use in different environments, under different circumstances, supplying any 
persistence requirements.
Hibernate allows many configuration options, based on an application's persistence 
requirements. However, most of these parameters have default values, which relieve 
us of detailed configuration in most situations.
In this chapter, I will show how Hibernate is configured and examine Hibernate's 
configuration settings. To begin, let's look at the basic configuration information 
that's commonly required. You can find more information about Hibernate 
configuration in the Appendix.
Basic configuration information
Through its configuration, Hibernate allows us to choose either Hibernate-managed 
JDBC connections or a container-managed data source. If you decide to use 
Hibernate-managed connections, you need to tell Hibernate about the database 
properties, such as the name of the driver class, the database JDBC URL, and the 
database username and password. These are the basic configuration settings for 
Hibernate-managed connections. Each of these settings is represented by a name, 
as explained in the following table:

Hibernate Configuration
[ 66 ]
Property name
Property value
hibernate.connection.driver_class
The fully qualified classname of the 
database's JDBC driver
hibernate.connection.url
The database's JDBC URL
hibernate.connection.username
The database username
hibernate.connection.password
The database password
hibernate.dialect
The Hibernate dialect class 
corresponding to the used database 
(see the next section)
To use a container-managed data source, you need to give Hibernate the JNDI 
information of the configured datasource object. The following table shows the 
configuration properties for container-managed connections:
Property name
Property value
hibernate.connection.datasource
Datasource JNDI name
hibernate.jndi.class
The fully qualified name of the initial 
context factory class for JNDI
hibernate.jndi.url
URL of the JNDI provider
hibernate.connection.username
Database username
hibernate.connection.password
Database password
hibernate.jndi.<JNDIpropertyname>
Used for specifying other JNDI properties
hibernate.dialect
The Hibernate dialect class 
corresponding to the database used 
(see the next section)
Between all of these properties, usually hibernate.
connection.datasource and hibernate.dialect are used.
Hibernate uses many more properties than listed in these tables, but we'll put that 
discussion aside and look at dialect, because dialect is a very important aspect of 
Hibernate. Other properties are presented in the following chapters as we discuss 
relevant topics.
You already know a little about Hibernate dialect. Here, let's dig deeper into 
Hibernate dialect and see what exactly a dialect does.

Chapter 4
[ 67 ]
Hibernate dialect
Although JDBC and SQL allow all Java applications to connect to all databases, we 
can't use special database features relying only on standard JDBC and SQL. In other 
words, although most interactions with all databases are treated similarly through 
the standard ANSI SQL, many database properties are essentially used differently, 
and we need to use a slightly different version of SQL to interact with them.
For example, databases may differ in the following ways:
Different databases may define identity columns differently
Different databases may support different column types
Different databases may use SQL syntaxes
Different databases may define foreign key columns differently
Not all databases support cascading delete
To solve this problem, Hibernate dialect allows us to use database features which 
are provided differently by different databases, without having to worry about 
the underlying details. We use a common syntax, and Hibernate translates our 
commands into the language of the database we are using, by applying the 
appropriate dialect. This guarantees application portability.
From an implementation perspective, each dialect is a subclass of org.hibernate.
dialect.Dialect, defining the use of a database's special features in a standard 
way. Each database has its own, individual dialect class. To use a database with 
Hibernate, the dialect class for the database must be specified through the mandatory 
hibernate.dialect entry in the configuration file. You can learn more about 
Hibernate at http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/
html/session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-dialects. 
The following table shows the supported databases and their respective dialect 
classes. You can find the updated list of supported database names on the 
Hibernate website.
When you use Hibernate, don't consider the special features of the 
underlying database. In other words, all applications should view the 
database only as much as Hibernate exposes it and not rely on special 
features of the database that are not exposed by Hibernate. Otherwise, the 
application will depend on the database and will not be portable, which 
may reduce scalability and cause maintenance problems.

If you want to use a database that does not have any built-in dialect in Hibernate, 
you must implement an appropriate dialect class, according to the database.
Let's now see how to use Hibernate's basic properties.

Chapter 4
[ 69 ]
Configuring Hibernate
As you saw in Chapter 3, you must configure Hibernate before you can use it. The 
configuration is represented by an object of type org.hibernate.Configuration. 
This object wraps all of the configuration settings and is used in the next step for 
building a SessionFactory object. (We'll discuss a useful strategy for creating the 
SessionFactory at the end of this chapter.) To configure Hibernate, you first need 
to instantiate a configuration object:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
The actual configuration settings can be divided into two parts: 
Hibernate properties: These include all of the database-related properties 
that Hibernate should consider while connecting to the database, as we 
saw earlier.
Hibernate mappings: These are XML documents that define the mapping of 
the entity classes to the database tables. You'll see a lot more on Hibernate 
mappings in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.
Once you have instantiated a Configuration object, there are two ways to 
configure Hibernate, either programmatically and declaratively. Let's first  
look at programmatic configuration.
Programmatic configuration
Hibernate properties are set in the configuration object through its 
setProperty() method:
public Configuration setProperty(String propertyName, String 
propertyValue)
The first argument determines the name of a Hibernate property that we want to 
configure. The second indicates the actual value for that property. The following 
snippet shows an example:
cfg.setProperty("hibernate.connection.url",
                "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb");
•
•

Hibernate Configuration
[ 70 ]
Note that the setProperty() method returns a Configuration object. This allows 
method chaining to set other properties. For instance, you can set all required 
properties in one single line of code, as follows:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration()
    .setProperty("hibernate.connection.url",
                 "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb")
    .setProperty("hibernate.dialect", "org.hibernate.dialect.
                  HSQLDialect")
    .setProperty("hibernate.connection.username", "sa")
    .setProperty("hibernate.connection.password", "")
    .setProperty("hibernate.connection.driver_class",
                 "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
Another way to set up the configuration object is by passing an instance of 
java.util.Properties to the setProperties() method:
public Configuration setProperties(Properties properties)
To set an XML mapping file, use the addResource() method of the 
configuration object:
public Configuration addResource(String resourcePath) throws
MappingException
The parameter of this method refers to the relative path of the mapping file in 
the classpath.
The following snippet shows an example:
config.addResource("com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch04/Student.hbm.
xml");
In this example, the mapping file is in the com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch04 package in the classpath, next to its respective entity class, com.packtpub.
springhibernate.ch04.Student. Although it's a good idea to place each mapping 
file next to its respective entity class, you don't need to do that.
An alternative way to configure mapping files, when they are in the same package as 
their respective entity classes, is using the addClass() method:
public Configuration addClass(Class aClass) throws MappingException
This method takes the entity class as an argument to find its mapping file, as in 
this example:
config.addClass(com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch04.Student.class);

Chapter 4
[ 71 ]
Hibernate then looks for a mapping file named com/packtpub/springhibernate/
ch04/Student.hbm.xml in the classpath.
This following snippet shows the programmatic configuration of Hibernate:
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.setProperty("hibernate.dialect",
                   "org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect");
config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.driver_class",
                   "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver");
config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.url",
                   "jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb");
config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.username", "sa");
config.setProperty("hibernate.connection.password", "");
config.addClass(Student.class); 
config.addClass(Teacher.class);
config.addClass(Course.class);
Note that all of these configuration settings are set only once, when the first 
interaction with Hibernate is performed.
Because the actual configuration information is specified in the deployment phase, 
or may change in during the lifetime of the application, Hibernate, like other 
frameworks, should be configured declaratively, instead of programmatically 
as we have done in this section.
Declarative configuration
The declarative approach is an alternative way to configure Hibernate. In this 
approach, an XML or a properties file sets up Hibernate properties. This file is then 
loaded in a Configuration object at runtime.
Hibernate supports both XML and properties files as the Hibernate configuration file, 
and there is actually no difference between them in terms of performance. However, 
the XML variant is preferred as this approach is much more flexible when specifying 
hbm mapping files. Let's see how each approach is used in practice.
Using a properties file
As you know, properties files are text files with the properties suffix. Their contents 
are keys and values:
key=value
Every key is a unique word or phrase that corresponds to another word or 
phrase as the value. Therefore, every key leads you or the application to the 
corresponding value.

Hibernate Configuration
[ 72 ]
The following code shows a properties file's contents, specifying the basic 
configuration information of Hibernate:
#hibernate configuration
hibernate.connection.driver_class=org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
hibernate.connection.url=jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb
hibernate.connection.username=sa
hibernate.connection.password=
hibernate.pool_size=5
hibernate.show_sql=false
hibernate.dialect= org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
To configure Hibernate with a properties file, you need to only create a 
Configuration object as follows:
Configuration config = new Configuration();
In this approach, Hibernate searches for a file named hibernate.properties in 
the root of the classpath. If this file exists, all hibernate.* properties are loaded 
and added to the Configuration object. When using this approach, you need to 
introduce mapping files to Hibernate programmatically, like this:
config.addClass(Student.class);
config.addClass(Teacher.class);
config.addClass(Teacher.class);
Note that Hibernate allows neither a different name for this file nor any location 
other than the root of the classpath. If you want to use a different file, or the file in a 
different location than the root of the classpath, you must use the XML approach.
Using an XML file
As mentioned earlier, another variant of declaratively configuring Hibernate is 
the XML approach. Because an XML file allows greater flexibility in specifying 
hbm mapping files, it's preferred to using a properties file and programmatic 
configuration. The following code shows a simple XML configuration file with 
the basic configuration entries:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-configuration SYSTEM 
          "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-configuration
          -3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-configuration>
  <session-factory>
    <!-- Hibernate Properties -->
    <property name="connection.driver_class">

Chapter 4
[ 73 ]
      org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver
    </property>
    <property name="connection.url">
      jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb
    </property>
    <property name="connection.username">sa</property>
    <property name="connection.password"> </property>
    <property name="pool_size">5</property>
    <property name="show_sql">false</property>
    <property name="dialect">
      org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
    </property>
    <!-- Mapping files -->
    <mapping resource="com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch04/
                                      Student.hbm.xml"/>
    <mapping resource="com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch04/
                                      Teacher.hbm.xml"/>
    <mapping resource="com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch04/
                                       Course.hbm.xml"/>
  </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
As this shows, the configuration entry names in the XML file are similar to the 
corresponding names in the properties file, only without the hibernate prefix. 
For example, the hibernate.connection.username entry in the properties file 
corresponds to the connection.username entry in the XML file.
To configure Hibernate with an XML file, create a Configuration object and then 
call its configure() method:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure();
When the configure() method is called, Hibernate searches the root of the classpath 
for a file named hibernate.cfg.xml. If this file exists, Hibernate loads all of the 
settings and then adds them to the Configuration object. If the file doesn't exist, 
Hibernate throws a HibernateException. 
If both hibernate.properties and hibernate.cfg.xml exist in an application, 
Hibernate first loads hibernate.properties, then overrides the loaded settings 
with the values defined in hibernate.cfg.xml.

Hibernate Configuration
[ 74 ]
If you want to use a file with a different name, or a file in a different location 
than the root of the classpath, you need to call the configure() method of the 
Configuration object and pass the file path as the argument. Here is an example:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure("/conf/hibernate.cfg.xml");
Using a single instance of 
SessionFactory
As mentioned in Chapter 3, the application uses session objects to interact with 
Hibernate and to request Hibernate to perform a persistence operation. This 
means the application needs to obtain a session object before issuing a persistence 
request. These objects are not thread-safe, so they cannot be shared. They undertake 
transactions, manage caching, and provide other controls on the persisting of the 
entity objects. However, session objects are not directly instantiated. Instead, they are 
constructed by another object called SessionFactory, which is thread-safe and acts 
as a factory for sessions.
As you saw in Chapter 3, the SessionFactory object is also not directly instantiated 
directly. Instead, it is constructed through the Configuration object by invoking 
the buildSessionFactory() method:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
…
SessionFactory sessions = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
There are many reasons to use only one instance of SessionFactory for an entire 
application. For example, SessionFactory is an expensive object. Instantiating it is a 
time-consuming operation and uses system resources. A SessionFactory is roughly 
analogous to a JDBC connection pool, which holds JDBC connections. However, 
it does more. It instantiates and prepares Session objects and binds them to the 
JDBC connections. It should be noted that only a single instance of SessionFactory 
is used throughout the application for each database that the application uses. 
However, situations when the application uses more than one database schema, 
you must have one SessionFactory for each database.
The following code shows the HibernateHelper class designed for creating a 
single instance of SessionFactory throughout the application. As you can see, 
the constructor of the class is private, meaning no objects of the class can be 
instantiated by other objects.

Chapter 4
[ 75 ]
As you will see in the coming chapters, you will not worry about this 
class anymore if you are using Hibernate with Spring. You can omit this 
class from the application and let Spring configure Hibernate and provide 
a single instance of SessionFactory, and you can even let Spring 
provide Session instances behind the scene.
The sessionFactory object is a private, static member of the class. This member 
represents the single instance of SessionFactory used for the entire application. The 
class also includes the getSession() method, which provides the session objects for 
the rest of the application. Actually, none of the classes that interact with Hibernate 
needs to configure Hibernate or obtain the SessionFactory object itself. A class 
should only invoke the getSession() method of this class to get a session object 
and then perform its desired persisting operation:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch04;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
public class HibernateHelper {
  private static final ThreadLocal session = new ThreadLocal();
  private static final ThreadLocal transaction = new ThreadLocal();
  private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory =
                       new Configuration().configure().
buildSessionFactory();
  //inaccessible constructor
  private HibernateHelper() {
  }
  public static Session getSession() {
    Session session = (Session) HibernateHelper.session.get();
    if (session == null) {
      session = sessionFactory.openSession();
      HibernateHelper.session.set(session);
    }
    return session;
  }
}

Hibernate Configuration
[ 76 ]
JPA configuration
The JPA compatible EntityManager is configured through the persistence.xml file 
located in the META-INF directory of the classpath. The persistence.xml file starts 
with the XML declaration and the persistence element as root. The root defines the 
schema, determining the version of JPA according to which the document is created. 
Inside the root element, an unlimited number of persistence-unit elements can 
be present. In most situations, only a single persistence-unit element is used. 
However, in rare situations when you are using two or more persistence strategies 
together in your application (for example, Hibernate for persisting some classes 
and iBatis for others), you can distinct them with individual persistence-unit 
elements. Here is an example of persistence-unit element with possible attributes 
and subelements:
<persistence-unit name="AUniqueName" transaction-type="JTA|RESOURCE_
LOCAL">             
    <provider>FullyQualifiedClassName</provider>
    <jta-data-source>JNDIName</jta-data-source>
    <jar-file>JARFileName</jar-file>
    <class>EntityClassName</class>
    <properties>
        <property name="propertyName" value="propertyValue"/>
    </properties>
</persistence-unit>
The meaning of these attributes and subelements are as follows:
name is the identifier of the persistence unit. The EntityManger object for this 
unit is configured by the persistence unit identified by this name.
transaction-type specifies the transaction type of this persistence unit. The 
valid values are JTA and RESOURCE_LOCAL. When a jta-datasource is used, 
the default is JTA, and if non-jta-datasource is used, RESOURCE_LOCAL 
is used. The default value in a JavaEE environment is JTA and in a JavaSE 
environment is RESOURCE_LOCAL.
provider specifies the fully qualified class name of the JPA provider. In case 
of Hibernate, it's value is org.hibernate.ejb.HibernatePersistence.
jta-data-source or non-jta-data-source specifies the JNDI name of 
the datasource being used. You may use none of these and use <property> 
elements, as described below, letting Hibernate create and manage 
connections by itself.

[ 77 ]
jar-file refers to a JAR file which includes annotated classes, annotated 
packages, and all hbm.xml files to be added to the persistence unit 
configuration. This element is mainly used in Java EE environment.
exclude-unlisted-classes determines if the annotated classes should 
explicitly be listed with the <class> elements or all should be loaded from 
the JAR file. The default value for this element is true in Java SE, and false 
in Java EE.
class specifies a fully qualified class name of a persistent class. By default, 
if exclude-unlisted-classes is set to true, all properly annotated classes 
and all hbm.xml files found inside the archive are added to the persistence 
unit configuration. This element also allows you to add some external entities 
to the persistence unit.
properties lets you to specify vendor-specific properties. This is where 
you will define your Hibernate-specific configurations, JDBC connection 
information, and so on.
To start up Hibernate with JPA, you should set up the EntityManager 
with the just configured persistence unit. This is done through the static 
createEntityManagerFactory() method of the Persistence class, as follows:
EntityManagerFactory emf =
            Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("instituteWebApp");
instituteWebApp is the value of the name attribute of the used persistence-unit.
If you are deploying in Java SE environment, you will need a utility 
class, like HibernateHelper, to provide only a single instance of the 
EntityManagerFactory object throughout the application.
It is also possible to configure EntityManagerFactory programmatically. Here is 
an example:
Map properties= new HashMap();
properties.put("hibernate.show_sql", "true");
EntityManagerFactory emf =
      Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("instituteWebApp", 
properties);
It then overrides any property already set in the persistence.xml file.

Hibernate Configuration
[ 78 ]
Alternatively, you can use a Hibernate-native API to create and configure the 
EntityManagerFactory instance. Hibernate provides the org.hibernate.ejb.
Ejb3Configuration class for this purpose. It can be used as follows:
Ejb3Configuration cfg = new Ejb3Configuration();
EntityManagerFactory emf =
cfg.configure("/hibernate.cfg.xml")
    .setProperty("hibernate.show_sql", "true")
    .addAnnotatedClass( hello.Message.class)
    .addResource( "/Student.hbm.xml")
    .buildEntityManagerFactory();
After the EntityManagerFactory is created, it can be used as follows to obtain 
EntityManager objects to perform unit of works:
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
The EntityManagerFactory object should be closed by invocation of it's close() 
method when the application has finished using this object, or the application 
shutdowns. Once the EntityManagerFactory has been closed, all of its 
EntityManagers are considered to be in the closed state. You will learn 
more about the EntityManager class in Chapter 8.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed Hibernate configuration settings and how 
Hibernate is configured. Hibernate lets us use a container-managed data source or 
Hibernate-managed connections. In either case, you need to specify the database 
username, password, and dialect. Additionally, when you use a container-managed 
data source, you must also specify the JNDI name of the data source. When you 
use a Hibernate-managed data source, you need to indicate the database URL 
and the classname of the database driver. Although this is the basic configuration 
information for Hibernate, Hibernate allows more configuration settings, making it 
an appropriate solution for any application deployed in any environment with any 
persistence requirement.
You have two options when configuring Hibernate, that is, the programmatic 
approach and the declarative approach. Although there is no difference between 
these two approaches as far as Hibernate is concerned, I prefer the declarative 
variant, because of its greater flexibility and lower maintenance cost.

Chapter 4
[ 79 ]
Hibernate also allows you to use an XML or a properties file as its configuration 
file. If you choose the XML variant, you can also specify the mapping files through 
it, in addition to other properties. Hibernate uses hibernate.properties and 
hibernate.cfg.xml as the default names for the configuration files. If both files 
exist in the application classpath, the hibernate.properties file is read first, then 
all of the read settings are overridden by the values defined in hibernate.cfg.xml.
In Hibernate, every persisting operation is performed through session 
objects. These are not instantiated directly. Instead, they are obtained by a 
SessionFactory object. This object is built by a Configuration object which 
wraps all configuration information.
You only need one instance of SessionFactory for each database in the application.


Hibernate Mappings
In earlier chapters, you have learned how to set up a project from scratch to use with 
Hibernate. You also learned how Hibernate is configured after it has been installed. 
After that, the application is ready to use Hibernate for persisting your objects.
Obviously, we are not going to persist all application objects in the database. 
Only the business entities of the problem domain (such as students and courses 
in an educational system application) are persistent. The classes that implement 
these entities are called entity classes. The persistence with Hibernate is called 
transparent, because the persistent classes never use or call Hibernate APIs and are 
not influenced by the persistent logic. These classes are merely simple data holders. 
We will discuss the implementation details and the persistence capability of these 
classes in this chapter.
For the next phase in Hibernate development, you'll need to tell Hibernate how it 
should map each entity class to its respective database table. This process is called 
object mapping and may involve setting up XML mapping files and/or annotating 
Java classes with Hibernate annotations, to determine the mapping information. To 
complete the process of object mapping, you introduce implemented mapping files 
and annotated Java classes to Hibernate through the Hibernate configuration file. 
Mapping implementations are the subject of this chapter.
Effective database schema design, proper object design, and proper object mapping 
are usually the most critical parts of application development. Any inappropriate 
design of the database's tables, inappropriate object design, or inappropriate object 
mapping hurts the application's performance and may limit its scalability.
This chapter discusses basic issues related to persistent objects and their mappings. 
Our discussion begins with simple cases, moving on to advanced and practical ones. 
The discussion continues into Chapter 6, which presents some advanced concepts 
behind Hibernate mappings.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 82 ]
Persistent entity classes
Entity classes are absolutely unaware of any Hibernate APIs, the underlying 
database and communication language (SQL), and any persistence issues, such as 
transaction. It is the role of Hibernate to work with these simple classes, handle 
persistence issues related to them, and provide a transparent persistence as 
the result.
The structure of persistent classes in Hibernate follows the Plain Old Java Object 
(POJO) programming model. POJOs are a customized and simplified form of 
JavaBeans, a component model for user interface development in Java. However, 
unlike JavaBeans, POJOs can be used in any layer of application architecture. They 
are the essence of many new Java frameworks that simply aim for JEE development. 
In this book, I use POJO to refer to any object that follows the POJO rules, regardless 
of whether it is persistent. I use the term persistent class to refer to any class that is 
persistent with Hibernate.
Let's see what entity classes look like in practice, before we dig more deeply into the 
POJO model and its Hibernate requirements to make these entity classes persistent.
POJOs are simply defined as data holders. They have properties, which hold data  
accessed through setter/getter accessor methods. A simple Hibernate persistent 
class, Student, which was introduced in earlier chapters, is shown below:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch05;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.io.Serializable;
public class Student implements Serializable{
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String ssn;
  private Date birthday;
  private String stdNo;
  private Date entranceDate ;
  //zero-argument constructor
  public Student() {
  }
  public Student(int id, 
                 String firstName, 
                 String lastName, 
                 String ssn,

    this.firstName = firstName;

    this.lastName = lastName;

}
Hibernate does not require persistent classes to extend or implement any 
Hibernate-specific classes, or call any other particular API. Every persistent 
class can be part of any class hierarchy, or may call or use any arbitrary API.
If the persistent objects are distributed over the network, 
or are stored in an HttpSession, they must implement 
the java.io.Serializable interface. 
Although most POJOs are compatible with Hibernate, they should meet a few 
mandatory and optional requirements to be persistent with Hibernate. Upcoming 
subsections discuss these requirements.
Having a zero-argument constructor 
(mandatory)
As Hibernate uses the Reflection API through the newInstance() method with 
no-arguments to instantiate persistent objects, every persistent class must have a 
zero-argument (empty) constructor. You can either define this constructor yourself, 
or not write any constructors at all, which produces a default empty constructor.
The zero-argument constructor can be nonpublic. However, it is highly recommended 
that it is at least package-visible. This allows Hibernate to generate runtime proxies 
to optimize performance. Generating runtime proxies is a mechanism Hibernate uses 
to avoid unnecessary loading of persistent objects, thereby enhancing performance. 
This is the basis of Hibernate's lazy loading feature. Obviously, the subclass cannot 
be created if the persistent class has a private constructor or is defined as final. We'll 
discuss runtime proxies in more depth in Chapter 8.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 86 ]
Providing accessors to access class 
properties (optional)
Each persistent class may have properties that represent the data which the class 
holds, defined as simple values, or other persistent classes, or both. These properties 
are usually defined as nonpublic instance variables, and are accessed through public 
accessor methods called setters and getters with the name of getXxx and setXxx. 
For example, for the Student class with the firstName property of type String, 
the getter and setter methods are respectively named getFirstName() (which takes 
no arguments and returns a String) and setFirstName() (which takes a String 
and has a void return type). Notice the lower-case f in the property name, and the 
upper-case F in the method names).
If a class has a getXxx method, but no corresponding setXxx, then 
the class is said to have a read-only property named xxx. The read-
only property is useful when there is a property in the class but no 
corresponding value for that property in the database. In that case, the 
class may have its own logic to determine the property value, in practice, 
from other properties, or Hibernate may load the property value from a 
column which is valued by a database trigger instead of the application. 
In the Student class above, age is a read-only property calculated from 
the persisted birthdate. You can get more information about JavaBeans at 
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/javabeans/.
The exception to this naming convention is Boolean properties, which uses a method 
called isXxx to look up their values. For example, the Student class might have 
methods called isGraduated() (which takes no arguments and returns a Boolean) 
and setGraduated() (which takes a Boolean and has a void return type), and would 
be said to have a Boolean property named graduated. (Again, notice the lower-case 
first letter in the property name.)
For a configuration setting, you can specify the strategy that Hibernate uses to access 
class properties, either through accessor methods or by direct access. However, 
using accessor methods is recommended, because this allows you to do more 
than accessing properties (such as imposing constraints on property values or 
validating them).
These requirements for accessor methods are rare. They mostly get and set 
values to the properties.

Chapter 5
[ 87 ]
Defining nonfinal classes (optional)
As explained before, Hibernate generates runtime proxies to enhance performance. 
To enable Hibernate to generate runtime proxies, the persistent classes either must be 
declared as nonfinal, letting Hibernate extend them at runtime, or must implement 
a Hibernate interface. Implementing the Hibernate interface is not recommended, 
because this method couples the persistent class to Hibernate. Instead, define the 
persistent classes as nonfinal. Chapter 8 discusses proxy generation in more detail.
Implementing equals() and hashCode() 
(optional)
Hibernate uses snapshot comparison to automatically detect changes, checking 
to see if the objects in memory are dirty and need updating. Hibernate does this 
comparison through the equals() and hashCode() methods implemented in 
the persistent classes. The hashCode() and equals() methods are required if the 
application uses detached objects (the objects which have already persisted and are 
being changed). When you implement the equals() method, you need to implement 
the hashCode() method as well. When two objects are equal, they must have the 
same hash code value.
Object/relational mapping metadata
You now have persistent classes that meet Hibernate requirements for persistence. 
To do its job, Hibernate (or any other object/relational mapping tool) needs 
information about the persistent classes and the target database tables in which 
the objects are persisted. It needs detailed information about the mapping of object 
properties to and from table columns, and of Java types to and from SQL types. 
It may require additional information about establishing foreign keys when the 
persistent class is associated with other(s). This is typical information that object/
relational mapping tools need. Moreover, Hibernate provides features, such as lazy 
loading, cascading, caching, and others, that must be configured. This information is 
represented as object/relational mapping metadata.
Hibernate supports the following three different strategies to describe this metadata:
Setting up XML mapping files
Annotating persistent classes with Hibernate XDoclet tags
Annotating persistent classes with Hibernate annotations
•
•
•

Hibernate Mappings
[ 88 ]
The first approach, which is also the traditional approach, maps metadata in 
Hibernate through XML documents. XML documents are easy to edit and maintain, 
even for administrators who do not know much about Java. Developing XML-based 
metadata is not effortless, especially when the XML schema is complex and no 
element or attribute has a default value.
Hibernate has tried to make using XML as simple and convenient as possible. 
XML-based metadata in Hibernate is well structured, with simple, understandable 
elements and attributes. Many elements and attributes have default values. 
Therefore, they can be dropped if they are worthless. For some elements (and 
even attributes), Hibernate can find the best value by investigating the persistent 
classes, if those elements or attributes are omitted.
In addition to XML, Hibernate supports two other methods for determining 
mapping metadata:
Annotating persistent classes with XDoclet markup
Annotating persistent classes with Hibernate annotations
Hibernate started supporting annotations with XDoclet when there was no support 
for annotations in Java. In this approach, persistent classes are annotated with 
special Hibernate-specific Java doclet tags, and then fed into XDoclet to generate 
XML mapping metadata. With JDK 5.0 annotations, Hibernate has provided its own, 
proprietary annotation API for supporting source-level metadata. This book covers 
both the XML and JPA annotation API approaches to describe metadata.
Next, we'll discuss how XML documents can determine mapping metadata.
Metadata in XML
Let's look at a simple example of object mapping to explore the XML approach. The 
following code shows the Student.hbm.xml file, which represents the mapping 
metadata for the Student class already discussed:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch05.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" column="id" type="int">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <property name="lastName" column="LAST_NAME"   type="string"/> 
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 89 ]
    <property name="ssn" column="SSN"   type="string"/> 
    <property name="birthday" column="BIRTHDAy"   type="date"/> 
    <property name="stdNo" column="STD_NO"   type="string"/> 
    <property name="entranceDate" column="ENTRANCE_DATE"  type="date"/>    
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see in this code, the XML-based metadata, like any other XML document, 
starts with XML and Doctype definitions.
All mapping information is declared inside the <hibernate-mapping> element, 
coming as the root. Within the root, the <class> element specifies the mapping 
information of the persistent class and its respective database table. Other elements are 
defined inside the <class> element to determine the mapping of class properties and 
their respective table columns, in addition to their corresponding Hibernate types.
The upcoming sections have a more in-depth discussion of these elements and 
their meanings.
Doctype
All XML mappings should start with the Doctype declaration, referring to the 
actual path of the DTD document, which is either a file path in the classpath, or 
an Internet URL.
The Doctype element is mandatory. Hibernate's XML parser 
uses this element to validate the mapping document.
The <hibernate-mapping> root element
All mapping definitions in an XML mapping file are enclosed by a <hibernate-
mapping> element. Typically, the mapping of each persistent class is defined in an 
individual XML file. However, you may specify many class mappings in a single file, 
all inside the <hibernate-mapping> element.
This element can come with attributes such as the following:
<hibernate-mapping auto-import="true|false"
               package="defaultPackage"
               default-cascade="none|all|delete|persist|merge|
               save-update|evict|replicate|lock|refresh|delete-orphan"
               default-lazy="true|false"
               default-access="field|property|PropertyAccessorClass">
          <!-- nested subelements -->
</hibernate-mapping>

Hibernate Mappings
[ 90 ]
In this book, underlined words show the default values for each 
element. All attributes are optional, unless otherwise noted.
All attributes specify the global properties values for all enclosed definitions. If these 
values have not been specified, the default value will be used. However, as you will 
see, each enclosed mapping definition can use its own, individual attributes, and 
consequently override the default values or the defined global values. The previously 
mentioned attributes are explained as follows:
auto-import allows you to name persistent classes in Hibernate queries 
with their unqualified names. You may set this to false if you think the 
class name would be ambiguous for Hibernate.
package indicates a package prefix that should be considered for unqualified 
class names in the mapping document.
default-cascade defines how changes made to an object affect its 
associated objects when the object is stored, updated, or removed. Using 
this attribute, you can specify that when the object is stored, updated, or 
removed, the associated objects are also stored, updated, or removed. In 
addition to all, delete-orphan, and none, Hibernate provides various 
cascade values for each basic operation it supports. The default is none, 
meaning that, by default, no persistence operation on an object is propagated 
to its associated objects. Cascading operations are discussed in detail 
in Chapter 8.
default-lazy determines whether associated objects are loaded when the 
object is loaded. The default is true, meaning that, by default, every object is 
loaded with all of its associated objects.
default-access indicates how object fields are accessed, whether directly 
(field) or by getter and setter methods (property). Alternatively, you 
may use the name of a org.hibernate.property.PropertyAccessor 
implementation, which defines a customized access mechanism.
The <class> element
The class element is the first nested element inside the root, which defines the 
mapping of an entity class. The most common attributes of this element are as follows:
<class name="className" 
       table="tableName"
       abstract="true|false"
       dynamic-update="true|false"
       dynamic-insert="true|false"
•

Chapter 5
[ 91 ]
       polymorphism="implicit|explicit" 
       lazy="true|false"
       select-before-update="true|false"
       where="SQLWhereCondition">
…
</class>
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
abstract specifies whether the class being mapped is an abstract class. This 
is used when this class in on the top of a class hierarchy, and if any concrete 
object of this class exists.
name indicates the fully qualified name of the persistent class.
table determines the name of the target database table in which the objects 
of this entity class are persisted.
lazy enables or disables lazy fetching of associated objects. This attribute is 
usually used to change the enclosing mapping's default.
select-before-update determines whether Hibernate must load 
each object before updating it. If the attribute is set to true, Hibernate does 
this to make a comparison and prevent unnecessary updates. However, 
loading objects before any updating is often inefficient. Sometimes when the 
database contains triggers, it can prevent unnecessary updates (which may 
hit triggers).
where specifies an arbitrary SQL WHERE condition to be applied on selecting 
the objects of this class. This attribute allows Hibernate to work with a subset 
of objects.
dynamic-update indicates that Hibernate should update only modified 
columns when it issues a SQL UPDATE statement for updating an object. 
The default is false, which means Hibernate updates all columns whether 
or not the corresponding values have changed. When you use dynamic-
update, Hibernate must have a current snapshot of the object to make a 
comparison. Providing the snapshot and making a comparison have a 
cost in performance, so it's almost wise to avoid them. Using dynamic-
update="true" is recommended only when there are sufficient, convincing 
reasons, such as when you want to use version-based optimistic locking 
(explained in Chapter 12), or when you are working with a table that has an 
extremely large number of columns and only a few columns are updated.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 92 ]
dynamic-insert determines that whether Hibernate should only insert 
not-null values in columns when it issues a SQL INSERT statement for inserting 
an object or not. The default is false, meaning that Hibernate inserts all values 
whether or not any of these values is null. Using dynamic-insert="true" 
may be useful when columns have defaults and writing null values would 
override the defaults. Note that using dynamic-insert="true" may produce 
a performance hit, since Hibernate cannot utilize prepared statement caching 
as efficiently as when null and not-null values are included in the SQL 
INSERT statements.
polymorphism determines if by querying a persistent class, all instances of 
that class and subclasses of that class should be loaded (implicit), or only 
the instances of that class that are mapped explicitly with Hibernate mapping 
metadata is loaded (explicit). This attribute will be discussed later in 
this chapter.
All attributes of the <class> element are optional.
The <id> element
The <id> element determines the object identifier and its corresponding primary key 
column in the table. This element also specifies how identifiers are generated for new 
instances of the class. The general form of the <id> element is as follows:
<id  name="indentifierProperty" 
     type="identifierType"
     column="identifierColumn" 
     unsaved-value=" null|any|none|undefined|id_value">
     <generator class="identifierGeneratorClass"/>
</id>
Here are the meanings of these attributes and their possible values:
name specifies the object identifier's name.
column sets the name of the table column that contains the primary key, and 
therefore holds the object identifier. If the column attribute is not specified, 
the value of the name attribute is considered instead.
type specifies the corresponding Hibernate type for the column. Hibernate 
uses this value with the selected dialect to pick the correct SQL data type 
when Hibernate exports the database schema from the mapping metadata. 
For example, the long and int values in most databases are transformed to 
BIGINT and INTEGER SQL types, respectively. We'll discuss Hibernate types 
in more depth in Chapter 7.

[ 93 ]
unsaved-value indicates the identifier value of the newly instantiated 
objects, which have not yet been persisted. Depending on the value you set, 
Hibernate determines whether an UPDATE or INSERT SQL statement is needed 
when the object is persisted. This attribute is mandatory. Commonly, zero 
(0) is used as the value when the identifier type is a number such as integer, 
long, and so on.
The <generator> element, nested within <id>, specifies how identifiers are 
generated for new instances of the class. This element takes a class attribute, 
that is, a Java class that generates unique identifiers for instances of the persistent 
class. Hibernate provides many built-in generators which satisfy most applications 
requirements. Still, when you need a particular kind of generator not provided by 
Hibernate (such as when you use a particular class instead of string, integer, long, 
and so on for an identifier), you can define a custom generator by implementing the 
IdentifierGenerator interface.
The following table shows Hibernate's built-in ID generators, which can easily be 
referred to by their short names:
Generator Short name
Description
sequence
This generator works with the sequence column type supported 
by DB2, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SAP DB, Mckoi, or a generator in 
Interbase. Both sequence and generator column types hint at 
the database to generate the ID values. The returned identifier is 
of type long, short, or int.
increment
This generator picks up the maximum primary key column 
value of the table at Hibernate startup, and then produces a 
series of identifier values by incrementing the preceding ones. 
This generator cannot be used in situations in which multiple 
processes access the database. The returned identifier value is of 
type long, short, or int.
identity
This generator works with identity columns in DB2, MySQL, MS 
SQL Server, Sybase, and HypersonicSQL. The returned identifier 
is of type long, short, or int.
native
This generator selects another identifier generator, such 
as sequence, identity, and hilo, depending upon the 
underlying database. The main advantage of this generator is that 
it keeps your application portable to many different databases.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 94 ]
Generator Short name
Description
hilo
This generator uses a High/Low algorithm to generate identifiers 
efficiently. According to this algorithm, each identifier value 
is made of two parts: a high value, which comes from a source 
common to all object identifier generators, and a low value, which 
is generated by your local object-identifier generator. The high 
values are more expensive, since they must be fetched from a 
central source available to all, but each of these values is unique 
to an object-identifier generator. The low value is initialized and 
incremented by the generator itself, locally, which makes this 
value easy and fast to obtain and to manage. The concatenation of 
the high and the low makes a unique key. To use this generator, 
you need a table and column (by default, hibernate_unique_
key and next_hi, respectively) as the source of high values.
seqhilo
This generator uses the High/Low algorithm, in which the high 
values are generated by a named database sequence. Note that 
you can use this generator if the database sequence is supported.
guid
This generator uses a database-generated identifier that is unique 
in any context. For this reason, this generator is called global 
unique identifier (guid). The guid generator only works with 
databases that support a guid type, including MS SQL Server 
and MySQL.
uuid
This generator uses a 128-bit Universally Unique Identifier 
(UUID) algorithm to generate identifiers of type string, unique 
within a network. The UUID algorithm uses the local IP address, 
in combination with the startup time of JVM, the current time, 
and a unique static counter in JVM, to generate the unique 
identifier. The generated identifier is encoded as a 32-digit 
hexadecimal string.
assigned
This does not refer to a built-in generator for identifiers. If this is 
used, the application must generate an identifier itself and assign 
it to the object before save() is called. This is the default strategy 
if no <generator> element is specified.
select
This generator performs a select query to read back the primary 
key value that has been assigned by a database trigger to the just-
inserted row. This generator uses a key option, which refers to an 
additional, unique identifier key column, and allows Hibernate to 
select the just-inserted row.
foreign
This generator uses the identifier of another associated 
object. Usually, this generator is used when there is a 
one-to-one relation.

Chapter 5
[ 95 ]
The <property> element
The <property> element maps a primitive property of the class, except for the 
identifier, to a particular column. The common attributes of this element come in 
the following form:
<property  name="propertyName" 
           type="propertyType"
           lazy="true|false"
           optimistic-lock="true|false"
           generated="never|insert|always"
           column="columnName"
           not-null="true|false" 
           unique="true|false"  />
Here are the meanings for these attributes and their possible values:
name refers to the property name, which starts with a lower-case letter.
type specifies the corresponding Hibernate type of the column.
lazy indicates whether the property value should be loaded lazily when an 
instance is first accessed.
optimistic-lock determines whether to use the optimistic lock when this 
property is updated.
generated indicates whether the property value is assigned by the 
application, or generated by the database. The valid values are never, 
insert, and always. The default value never, specifies that the database 
never generates the value. The insert value means that the database 
generates the value when the object is inserted, but never regenerates it in 
subsequent updates. always indicates that the database always generates the 
value, whether an insert or update statement is performed.
column specifies the table column in which the property is persisted. 
However, column may be omitted. When it is, the property name, given by 
the name property, is considered instead.
not-null indicates whether the column may maintain null values.
unique specifies whether to allow duplicate values for the column.
Except for name, all of these attributes are optional.

The formula attribute
The formula attribute can be used with the <property> element to represent a 
computed property. In this case, formula refers to an HQL expression (discussed in 
Chapter 9) by which the property is dynamically computed, instead of being loaded 
from a particular column. For example, consider the count property in the Student 
class, representing the number of all students persisted in the database:
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private int count;
  //other fields and getter&setter methods
}
The formula attribute can indicate how the count property should be initialized with 
the number of all student objects when each Student object is loaded:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch05.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="id">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="count" formula="(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Student)"/>
    <!--other properties -->
<hibernate-mapping>
The insert and update attributes
It is possible to use insert and update attributes for the <property> element, to 
specify if the mapped property should appear in the SQL INSERT or SQL UPDATE 
statements, when the object is inserted (saved for the first time) or updated. For 
instance, you may use insert="false" and update="false" for a property that is 
valued by a database trigger. Therefore, the application never assigns a value to it. 
You may also use insert="true" and update="false" for a property which is just 
inserted and never updated. The insert="false" and update="false" are useful 
for read-only properties that do not have corresponding columns in the database and 
are computed from other class properties.
Metadata in annotations
Let's now see how annotation mappings can be created for our simple class.

Chapter 5
[ 97 ]
Before going ahead, make sure the hibernate-annotations.jar file, 
and ejb3-persistence.jar, in the application classpath. They are the 
required libraries to EJB-3 and Hibernate proprietary annotation API.
The following code shows the Student class which is now annotated:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch05;
import java.util.Date;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.io.Serializable;
import javax.persistence.*;
@Entity
@Table(name="STUDENT")
public class Student implements Serializable{
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;
  private String ssn;
  private Date birthday;
  private String stdNo;
  private Date entranceDate ;
  //constructors

  @Column(name = "ID")
  public int getId() {
    return id;
  }
  public void setId(int id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  @Basic
  @Column(name="FIRST_NAME")
  public String getFirstName() {
    return firstName;
  }
  public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }

  @Column(name="LAST_NAME")
  public String getLastName() {

  }
  @Basic
  @Column(name="SSN")
  public String getSsn() {
    return ssn;
  }
  public void setSsn(String ssn) {
    this.ssn = ssn;
  }
  @Basic
  @Column(name="BIRTHDAY")
  public Date getBirthday() {
    return birthdate;
  }
  public void setBirthdate(Date birthday) {
    this.birthdate = birthdate;
  }
  @Basic
  @Column(name="STD_NO")
  public String getStdNo() {
    return stdNo;
  }
  public void setStdNo(String stdNo) {
    this.stdNo = stdNo;
  }
  @Basic
  @Column(name="ENTRANCE_DATE")
  public Date getEntranceDate() {
    return entranceDate;
  }
  public void setEntranceDate(Date entranceDate) {
    this.entranceDate = entranceDate;
  }
  public int getAge(){

Chapter 5
[ 99 ]
    Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
    c.setTime(new java.util.Date(getBirthdate().getTime()));
    int birthYear = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
    c.setTime(new java.util.Date());
    int now = c.get(Calendar.YEAR);
    return now-birthYear;
  }
  //hashCode() and equals() methods
}
As you can see, the class imports the javax.persistence package. This package 
includes the standard EJB-3 annotation API. This API allows us to develop a 
portable application.
Hibernate annotations may be used to annotate the class definition, the properties, 
and the methods. Let's explore what each annotation means and how it can be used.
@Entity
The @Entity annotation, which comes before the class definition, is used to mark a 
class as an entity class. This is done as follows:
import javax.persistence.*;
@Entity
public class Student implements Serializable{
    …
}
@Entity is located in javax.persistence and is used immediately before the 
class definition.
@Table
Similar to @Entity, @Table is set at the class level and provides information about 
the target table, in which the objects of the entity class are stored. This annotation is 
optional. Therefore, if it is omitted, Hibernate maps the entity class to a table with 
the same name as the entity class. However, you may use the name attribute of this 
annotation to change this default behavior. Here is an example:
import javax.persistence.*;
@Entity
@Table(name="STUDENT_TBL")
public class Student implements Serializable{
    …
}

Hibernate Mappings
[ 100 ]
The objects of this class will be persisted in a table named STUDENT_TBL. @Table has 
another important attribute, named UniqueConstraint. It will be discussed in the 
coming sections.
@Id and @GeneratedValue
The @Id annotation is used to mark a property as the class identifier. This annotation 
can be put either on the property or the corresponding getter method. This 
placement determines the default access strategy to the class properties, either 
field or property.
By default, the @Id annotation chooses the best key generation strategy. However, 
it is possible to override this default behavior through another annotation, named 
@GeneratedValue which has two attributes, strategy and generator.
The strategy attribute can have one of the four values specified by the javax.
persistence.GeneratorType enumeration. The values are as follows:
AUTO makes Hibernate choose the appropriate generator based on 
the database.
IDENTITY makes the database be responsible for key generation.
SEQUENCE makes Hibernate use a database sequence as the generator for 
primary key values.
TABLE tells Hibernate to use a proprietary table in the database to hold the 
key values.
AUTO is the default value for @GeneratedValue, if this 
annotation is omitted.
When SEQUENCE or TABLE is used, you need to use the @SequenceGenerator or 
@TableGenerator to determine the details of the key generation strategy. Here is 
an example of @SequenceGenerator:
@Id
@SequenceGenerator(name="seqId",sequenceName=" SEQ")
@GeneratedValue(strategy= GeneratorType.SEQUENCE,generator="seqId")
public int getId() {
     return id;
}
As you can see, @SequenceGenerator comes with two attributes, name and 
sequenceName. The name attribute only provides an identifier to the sequence 
generator, which can be used by the @GeneratodValue. The sequenceName 
attribute determines the database sequence object.
•

•
•

Chapter 5
[ 101 ]
Similarly, @TableGenerator is used to specify the details of the table sequence 
generator. Here is an example:
@Id
@TableGenerator(name="keys", table="KEYS_TBL")
@GeneratedValue(strategy= GeneratorType.TABLE,generator="keys")
public int getId() {
      return id;
}
The name attribute provides an identifier for the generator. The table 
attribute specifies the name of the table which holds the primary key values. 
@TableGenerator can be used with a variety of other attributes. Most importantly, 
the pkColumnName and pkColumnValue attributes are used when the table is used 
by more than one entity object, and each one has its own primary key column and 
primary key column value.
@Basic
All simple properties of an entity class are stored and retrieved by Hibernate, even 
if they are not marked up with annotations. These simple properties can be Java 
primitives, primitive wrappers, array of primitives, or any Serializable class.
@Lob
Any Java type that is mapped to a target column with the type of java.sql.Blob 
or java.sql.Clob is annotated with @Lob. These types include java.sql.Clob, 
Character[], char[], String for Clob, and java.sql.Blob, byte[], or Byte[] 
for Blob. The following example shows this:
@Lob
public String getDescription() {
    return description;
}
@Lob 
public byte[] getEncryptedCode() {
    return encryptedCode;
}
As you can see, both the String and byte[] types are annotated with @Lob.
@Transient
The @Transient annotation is used to mark a property as transient, so that the 
property will not be persisted.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 102 ]
@Column
By default, Hibernate stores each persistent property in a column with the same 
name as the property. The @Column annotation can be used in cases where the 
column name is not the same as the property name. This annotation also allows 
information to be provided for the DDL.
Mapping inheritance hierarchy
An entity class may be derived from another entity class. Although the subclass 
has its own properties and associations, it also inherits the superclass properties 
and associations. As a result, to persist a subclass object, we need to persist its own 
properties and associations, as well as those it inherits. The persisting should occur 
in a way that allows reconstruction of the original object later.
Databases, however, do not naturally provide a solution for persisting inheritance 
hierarchies. Therefore, each application may use its own solution for this purpose.
Let's continue our discussion with a simple example. The following figure shows a 
class diagram of an inheritance hierarchy with the Person, Student, and Teacher 
classes. Through this example, we will see the different approaches Hibernate 
allows for mapping an inheritance hierarchy.
Person
-id
-firstName
-lastName
-ssn
-birthdate
Student
-stdNo
-entranceDate
Teacher
-degree
-major
Hibernate has three distinct ways to map an inheritance relationship:
Use one table for each concrete (nonabstract) class
Use one table for each subclass, including interfaces and abstract classes
Use one table for each class hierarchy
•
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 103 ]
The sections that follows discuss these approaches, along with their advantages 
and disadvantages.
One table for each concrete class
In this approach, a single table is used for each concrete class. All persisted 
properties of each concrete class, including its own properties and its inherited 
properties, are mapped to a single table. Since there are no instances of interfaces or 
abstract classes, there is no need for mapping definitions.
To map our example class hierarchy using this approach, the database needs the 
tables shown in the following figure. Each table persists its respective entity class 
regardless of any inheritance considerations:
TEACHER
STUDENT
PERSON
PK
PK
PK
TEACHER_ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
DEGREE
MAJOR
STUDENT_ID
STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
SSN
BIRTHDATE
This approach has four shortcomings, which are explained below:
Imperfect support for polymorphic associations: The problem occurs when 
a parent class is associated with another persistent class. In our example, 
suppose Person is associated with an Address class, so both Student and 
Teacher are associated with Address, as well. To map this class hierarchy 
according to this approach, we need these four tables in our database 
schema: PERSON, STUDENT, TEACHER, and ADDRESS. If Address has a 
many-to-one relationship with Person (more than one person may have 
the same address), then the ADDRESS table should provide a foreign key 
reference to all PERSON, STUDENT, and TEACHER tables, in order to establish 
database-level relationship, but this is not possible.
Low-performance capability: Another shortcoming of this approach is 
that all objects persisted in subclass tables are naturally instances of a 
superclass. Therefore, to query all superclass objects, you need to query 
both the superclass and all subclass tables. This results in a negative 
impact on performance, especially when the class hierarchy is complex.
•
•

Hibernate Mappings
[ 104 ]
Verbose query statements: For the same reason as in the previous bullet, to 
query objects of a superclass, you need to write verbose query statements 
which include both subclass and superclass objects. This would be very 
difficult in practice when you are testing the database behavior through 
hand-written queries, or when the database is used by another application 
through pure JDBC.
Difficult to maintain: Another shortcoming of this approach is its 
maintenance cost. It produces a complex and dirty schema as several 
columns are duplicated across many tables. Therefore, any changes to the 
parent class may cause changes to a large number of tables, including its 
respective table and all of its subclass tables. Verbose query statements can 
also increase the maintenance cost.
The mapping of this strategy is very easy and straightforward. If you are using XML 
mappings, you just need to use an individual hbm.xml file for each concrete class 
regardless of their relationship.
To use annotations, you need to use the @Inheritance annotation with its strategy 
attribute. Here is an example:
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public class Student implements Serializable {
    ...
}
As you can see, the strategy attribute determines the type of inheritance mapping, 
which is TABLE_PER_CLASS for this case.
This approach is not recommended, except when the object model is not very 
complex and polymorphism is not required.
One table for class hierarchy
In this approach, the entire class hierarchy can be mapped to a single table. This table 
should have proper columns for all properties of all classes in the class hierarchy. 
The table uses an extra column, called the discriminator column, which allows 
recognition of the class to which each row belongs. The following figure shows 
the PERSON table, which maintains all of the objects of our hierarchy. In this, the 
PERSON_TYPE is the discriminator column:
•
•

Chapter 5
[ 105 ]
PERSON
PK
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
SSN
BIRTHDATE
STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
DEGREE
MAJOR
PERSON_TYPE<<Discriminator>>
The benefits of this approach are simplicity and efficiency. Polymorphic associations 
are implemented simply by foreign key constraints, and you can easily retrieve 
desired objects by simple queries without requiring any JOIN or UNION clause. 
However, this approach also has its disadvantages. Some columns are shared 
between derived classes, and each column must be defined nullable or not-nullable, 
the classes can use different nullable status for their shared columns.
To use this approach, first determine the discriminator column through the 
<discriminator> element, which defines the column name and type. Second, use 
the <class> and its nested <subclass> elements inside the mapping document for 
mapping the superclass and its derived classes. Third, each <class> or <subclass> 
element should use its desired discriminator value. Specify this value through the 
discriminator-value attribute.
The following code shows this approach for mapping the Person, Student, and 
Teacher classes:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC

    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <property name="lastName" column="LAST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <property name="ssn" column="SSN" type="string"/>
    <property name="birthdate" column="BIRTHDATE" type="date"/>
    <subclass name="Student" discriminator-value="ST">
      <property name="stdNo" column="STD_NO" type="string"/>
      <property name="entranceDate" column="ENTRANCE_DATE" 
                                              type="date"/>
    </subclass>
    <subclass name="Teacher" discriminator-value="TE">
      <property name="degree" column="DEGREE"   type="int"/>
      <property name="major" column="MAJOR" type="int"/>
    </subclass>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Note that the discriminator column is used merely for mapping. It has no 
corresponding values in the entity classes.
You can nest a <subclass> element within the <subclass> element to specify the 
mapping of a derived class from the subclass.
As for the table per class strategy, the @Inheritance annotation is used to mark up 
the entity class. But now SINGLE_TABLE is used as the value for the strategy attribute. 
It is also needed to use the @DiscriminatorColumn and @DiscriminatorValue 
annotations to specify the discriminator column, as well as the value in that column 
which is used for the entity class. The following code shows how annotations are 
used to map our example class hierarchy:
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = SINGLE_TABLE)
@DiscriminatorColumn(
    name="PERSON_TYPE",
    discriminatorType=STRING
)
@DiscriminatorValue("PE")
public class Person implements Serializable {
...
}
The @DiscriminatorColumn has two attributes, name and discriminatorType, 
which specify the name and the type of the discriminator column. For 
mapping the subclasses of Person, you just need to use @Inheritance 
and @DiscriminatorValue as follows:

Chapter 5
[ 107 ]
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = SINGLE_TABLE)
@DiscriminatorValue("ST")
public class Student extends Person{
    ...
}
As you can see, ST now is used as the value of @DiscriminatorValue.
One table per subclass
You may use distinct tables for persisting each class in the hierarchy. The 
inheritance relationships between objects are established by foreign key 
constraints between tables.
This approach is analogous to the first approach, in which all of the properties 
of each class (its own and those that are inherited) are persisted into one table. 
However, unlike that approach, the one-table-per-subclass approach lets you use 
one table for each class' own properties. With this approach, you can imagine the 
database schema like the object model, a table corresponding to each class.
The following figure shows tables and their relations for mapping the Person, 
Student, and Teacher classes using this approach:
TEACHER
STUDENT
PERSON
PK
PK
PK
TEACHER_ID
DEGREE
MAJOR
STUDENT_ID
STD_NO
ENTRANCE_DATE
ID
FIRST_NAME
LAST_NAME
SSN
BIRTHDATE
The STUDENT_ID and TEACHER_ID columns are foreign keys to the ID column of 
the PERSON table. While each object of the Person class is persisted with a row in 
the PERSON table, each Student or Teacher object is represented with a row in the 
STUDENT or TEACHER table, as well as a row in the PERSON table. This approach is 
simple to implement since each persistent class and its properties correspond to 
one table and its columns, respectively. The approach is also easy to manage, as any 
changes to a single persistent class makes a single change to the database schema. 
The data is fully normalized.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 108 ]
Use the <joined-subclass> elements in the mapping file to map the class hierarchy. 
The following code shows this approach in persisting our class hierarchy:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="Person" table="PERSON">
    <id name="id" column="ID" type="long">
      <generator class="native"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <property name="lastName" column="LAST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <property name="ssn" column="SSN" type="string"/>
    <property name="birthdate" column="BIRTHDATE" type="date"/>
    <joined-subclass name="Student" table="STUDENT">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <property name="stdNo" column="STD_NO" type="string"/>
      <property name="entranceDate" column="ENTRANCE_DATE" 
                                            type="date"/>
    </joined-subclass>
    <joined-subclass name="Teacher" table="TEACHER">
      <key column="TEACHER_ID"/>
      <property name="degree" column="DEGREE" type="int"/>
      <property name="major" column="MAJOR" type="int"/>
    </joined-subclass>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, each <joined-subclass> element has a nested <key> element, 
which represents the subclass table's primary key column that is a foreign key 
constraint to the parent table. In this example, STUDENT_ID and TEACHER_ID are 
the primary keys, and they are also foreign keys to the PERSON table.
To map this strategy with annotations, strategy=JOINED is used for the 
@Inheritance annotation in the superclass. Without any other annotations, 
Hibernate joins subclass tables with the superclass table using the same primary key 
names. The following code shows using the annotation mapping of the join strategy:
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Person implements Serializable {
     ... 
}
@Entity
public class Student extends Person{
 ... 
}

Chapter 5
[ 109 ]
If tables are joined by columns with different names, the @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn 
and @PrimaryKeyJoinColumns annotations can be used. Here is an example:
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Person implements Serializable {
     ... 
}
@Entity
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="STUDENT_ID")
public class Student extends Person{
 ... 
}
In the example above, the STUDENT table is joined with PERSON using the join 
condition PERSON.id = STUDENT.STUDENT_ID.
The main shortcoming of this approach appears when the class hierarchy grows 
vertically: class A has a B subclass, and class B has a C subclass, and so on. When 
a child class is queried, Hibernate must join the child table and all of its parent 
tables to construct the target objects. This has a negative effect on performance. 
Furthermore, tables in the database are not self-explained. In other words, the 
bounds of the data in those tables are not clear for everyone who uses the data 
directly without Hibernate.
The dynamic-update and dynamic-insert attributes, which are 
used with the class element to avoid inserting null property values 
and to avoid updating unchanged property values, respectively, are not 
inherited by subclasses. For that reason, they should be duplicated in the 
<subclass> or <joined-subclass> elements.
Implicit polymorphism versus explicit 
polymorphism
Hibernate allows polymorphic relations to be handled by providing the 
polymorphism attribute through the <class>, <subclass>, and <joined-subclass> 
elements. With this attribute, you can determine whether to use implicit or 
explicit query polymorphism.

Hibernate Mappings
[ 110 ]
Implicit polymorphism allows querying of all instances of a class and its subclasses 
by a query which only names the class itself. Explicit polymorphism allows 
querying only of instances of the class and its subclasses mapped inside this 
<class> declaration as a <subclass> or a <joined-subclass>. For most purposes, 
the default, polymorphism="implicit", is appropriate. Explicit polymorphism is 
useful when the class hierarchy is mapped to the same table. In that case, we are not 
interested in all instances when querying the superclass.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the principles of entity classes and their mapping 
definitions. Hibernate defines only a few requirements for persistent classes. The 
structure of all persistent classes must follow a POJO programming model, a 
customized and simplified form of the JavaBeans model, with a bit of additional 
requirements. The transparent persistence feature of Hibernate indicates that these 
classes do not depend on the Hibernate API or any persistence logic. This increases 
the application's portability and keeps it consistent with any persistence technology.
After designing the object model, you need to give Hibernate information about 
the target tables and their columns, in which the objects properties are persisted. 
You accomplish this through the mapping documents. Every mapping document 
is written in XML, starting with a mandatory DOCTYPE declaration, referring to the 
DTD document, and followed by <hibernate-mapping> as the root element. Inside 
the root, the <class> element is used to map the entity class. This element comes 
with name and table attributes, indicating the entity class name and the respective 
target table.
Inside <class>, the <id> element comes first. This element associates the identifier 
property of the class with the primary key column of the table. It also specifies how 
to generate an identifier value for new instances of the class. After <id>, <property> 
elements appear to map primitive properties of the class.
Hibernate allows inheritance hierarchies to be mapped in three distinct ways: using 
one table for each concrete class, using one table for each subclass, and using one 
table for each class hierarchy.

More on Mappings
In Chapter 5, you learned the fundamental concepts behind Hibernate mappings. 
In this chapter, we will look at some other issues in mapping definitions, including 
the mapping of collections and associations. We will see how persistent classes can 
be divided into value types and entity types, and how these may affect the mapping 
definition. As you probably know, there are different types of object associations: 
one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many. The many side of the 
relationship is represented by an object of a java.util.Collection or a 
java.util.Map.
The mapping definitions introduced in this chapter are explained with simple 
examples from the educational system application. Let's begin with the simplest 
form of class mapping, called component mapping.
Most examples in this chapter are not listed in complete form. Setter and 
getter methods are always omitted, and each persistent class includes 
only the properties relevant to the current discussion.
Mapping components
Commonly, each persistent class is stored in its own database table. This means 
we normally use a database table which corresponds  to each persistent class. 
Although this is a common approach, it is not always taken. In practice, there is a 
situation where you may want to store more than one persistent class in a single 
database table.

More on Mappings
[ 112 ]
This situation is where you have two persistent classes, one of them is always 
represented as a property of the other one and is used nowhere else. In other words, 
no object of one class that is represented as the property of the other class lives 
independently in the application. For instance, suppose our application includes two 
persistent classes: Student and Phone. If any Phone instance is always a property of 
a Student instance and not of any other class, we can say no Phone object can live 
independently of a Student object in the application. In this case, Phone is called a 
component of Student, or simply a value object.
Why then don't we merge the two classes into a single persistent class? The answer 
is simple: these classes model our domain more comprehensibly. You may then 
ask why we don't treat them normally and persist them in individual tables. This is 
because the two classes together form a single item of data, and it is neither attractive 
nor reasonable to present a single piece of data in two distinct tables. We use one 
identifier for both persistent classes for exactly the same reason. In our example, 
the Phone class does not have an identifier. Instead, it can use its associated 
Student identifier.
Hibernate provides the <component> element for such situations. This element 
is analogous to the <property> element, but unlike <property> which maps a 
primitive type, <component> maps an associated persistent object to extra 
columns in a table. This element is commonly used in the following form:
<component name="propertyName"
           class="className"
           lazy="true|false"
           unique="true|false">
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
name (mandatory) refers to the name of the object field persisted.
class (optional) specifies the classname of the mapped field. If class is not 
specified, Hibernate uses the reflection API to find the field's class. Use the 
qualified name for duplicate classes.
lazy (optional) determines whether lazy loading is used for the field.
unique (optional) indicates whether all columns to which the associated 
object is mapped are unique.
The <component> element can come with other attributes, such as insert, 
update, and access. These have the same meanings when they are used for 
the <class> element.

Chapter 6
[ 113 ]
In this chapter, just like in the previous chapter, underlined 
words show the default values.
The following code shows an example of using the <component> element, in which 
the Student class and its composite field, Phone, are mapped to a single table:
public class Student {
  private Phone phone;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
public class Phone {
  private String comment;
  private String number;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <component name="phone"
class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone">
      <property name="comment" column="COMMENT"/> 
      <property name="number" column="PHONE_NUMBER"/> 
    </component>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Persistent classes are called value types if they do not live 
independently in the application and are always represented 
without an identifier value. Other normal persistent classes are 
called entity types, which live independently and are always 
identified with their identifier value. Phone and Student are 
examples of value type and entity type, respectively.
The following simple rules identify value types:
They do not hold an identifier value.
They do not live independently in the application.
They are never shared between two or more persistent classes.

[ 114 ]
For example, if Phone is a property for both Student and another persistent class 
(for example, Teacher), then you should change Phone to an entity type by assigning 
an identifier property to it and storing its instances in a distinct database table. Note 
that sharing a persistent class among other persistent classes is different from sharing 
an instance among other instances.
The @Embedded annotation is used to annotate a property to map as a component. 
Therefore, in our case, we would have the Student class as follows:
@Entity
@Table(name = "STUDENT")
public class Student {
  @Embedded
  private Phone phone;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
It is also possible to annotate the dependent class as a component with the 
@Embeddable annotation. Therefore, we don't need the @Embedded annotation 
anymore, and Hibernate always maps the object of the dependent class as a 
component. The following shows the Phone class annotated with @Embeddable:
@Embeddable
 public class Phone {
  
  private String comment;
  
  @Column(name="PHONE_NUMBER")
  private String number;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
In the class above, we just marked the Phone class as a dependent component 
class. Therefore, all of Phone's properties will store to additional columns of the 
STUDENT table.
Mapping collections
When a class has a property of type java.util.Collection, or any of its subclasses, 
there is certainly a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between the class and 
the collection's elements. The collection may contain objects of either value type or 
entity type. Regardless of the object type the collection maintains, we always need 
an extra table to store the collection elements. Obviously, this table must include a 
primary key column if the collection maintains entity types.

Chapter 6
[ 115 ]
Java provides different collection types, all represented as subinterfaces or 
implementations of java.util.Collection. Additionally, Java provides maps, 
represented by implementations and subinterfaces of the java.util.Map interface. 
The Map interface does not extend java.util.Collection, so it is not called a 
collection. However, since both maps and collections represent nearly the same 
concepts, with methods of the same names and nearly the same behavior, maps can 
be viewed as collections. Collections and maps provide a hierarchy of interfaces with 
different implementation classes.
The java.util.Collection has two subinterfaces: java.util.List and java.
util.Set. The List allows duplicate elements and maintains elements based on 
their positions in the list. In contrast, Set does not allow duplicate elements and 
does not preserve elements order. Map holds the objects as key/value pairs.
The following table shows the collection and map interfaces and the corresponding 
XML elements used for mapping them. This table also shows which collection and 
map is initialized with which concrete class:
Java Collection Type
Description
Hibernate Mapping 
Definition
java.util.Collection
(Initialized with java.util.
ArrayList) The root interface 
for java.util.List and 
java.util.Set collections. 
It provides methods such as 
add(), remove(), size(), 
and toArray().
Mapped with <bag> and 
<idbag> elements.
java.util.List
(Initialized with java.util.
ArrayList) A collection that 
maintains its elements in a 
particular order unless it is 
modified. Each element can be 
accessed through its index in 
the list.
Mapped with the <list> 
element. This element uses 
an extra column in the 
target table to preserve the 
position of each element 
in the list. Any java.
util.List object can also 
be mapped with <bag> 
and <idbag> if no real 
positional order is needed.
java.util.Set
(Initialized with java.util.
HashSet) A collection that 
extends the java.util.
Collection interface and 
does not allow duplicate 
elements. Its elements are 
not necessarily stored in any 
particular order.
Mapped with the <set> 
element.

Java Collection Type
Description

java.util.SortedSet
(Initialized with java.util.
TreeSet) A subinterface 
of java.util.Set, whose 
elements are sorted.
Mapped with the <set> 
element. This element can 
be used with an additional 
sort attribute, which 
dictates that the elements 
must be sorted based on 
property or object.
java.util.Map
(Initialized with java.util.
HashMap) Holds its elements 
as key/value pairs. The keys 
are always unique, but values 
can be duplicate.
Mapped with the <map> 
element.
java.util.SortedMap
(Initialized with java.util.
TreeMap) Extends java.
util.Map and maintains the 
keys sorted.
Mapped with the <map> 
element. This element can 
be used with an additional 
sort attribute, which 
dictates that the elements 
must be sorted based on 
property or object.
Let's see how the <set>, <bag>, <list>, <idbag>, and <map> elements allow us to 
map collections and maps.
The <set> element
The <set> element maps an object of type java.util.Set which, unlike java.
util.List, does not permit duplicates. This is the common way to use this element:
<set name="setName"
     table="SET_TABLE"
     inverse="true|false"
     lazy="true|false"
     order-by="aTableColumn"
     cascade="none|all|delete|persist|merge|
              save-update|evict|replicate|lock|refresh"
     sort="unsorted|natural|ComparatorClass"/>
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
name (mandatory) refers to the property name that represents an object of 
type java.util.Set.
table (optional) specifies the table that stores the associated entities 
represented by the Set object. If table is not specified, the property name is 
used instead.
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 117 ]
inverse (optional) specifies whether the relationship can be navigated in 
the opposite direction. inverse="true" tells Hibernate the developer is 
responsible to manage the collection and Hibernate should not synchronize 
the collection with the database when the link between two instances 
is manipulated.
lazy (optional) determines lazy loading mode in fetching the objects in 
the set.
order-by specifies an arbitrary SQL ORDER BY clause with an optional asc 
or desc, which affects the populated Set object. Note that the string you use 
for this attribute does not include the ORDER BY keywords. (This is discussed 
separately in the next section of this chapter.)
cascade (optional) determines how any persistent operation on the object 
affects its associated objects in the set.
sort determines whether a sorted set is to be used. The valid values include 
unsorted, natural, or any Comparator class. (This is discussed separately in 
the next section of this chapter.)
Assume that the Student class has a property of type java.util.Set, called 
papers. This property represents all of the papers that a Student has written. The 
papers property maintains the file names of a student's papers in the system, but no 
extra information. To map this structure to the database, we use an extra table called 
STUDENT_PAPER. This table has two columns, STUDENT_ID and PAPER_PATH, which 
determine the identifier of the owner student and the path of the paper in the system, 
respectively. The following shows the Student class and its mapping file:
public class Student {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName; 
  private Set papers = new HashSet();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <set name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
    </set>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>

As you can see, we have specified the STUDENT_PAPER table to store the elements of 
the papers property through the <set> element. The nested <key> element specifies 
the column in STUDENT_PAPER that is a foreign key to the primary key value of the 
associated Student object (in this case, STUDENT_ID is the foreign key to the ID 
primary key). The nested <element> element specifies the type and destination of 
each element in the Set. In our case, this is a string that represents the file path. The 
following figure shows the database table structure for this type of mapping:
The <bag> element 
The <bag> element is used to map an object of java.util.Collection and its 
subinterface, java.util.List. However, the <bag> element is not exactly a match 
for the List interface. While List keeps the items in order, the order of items 
in <bag> is ignored and is not kept in the database. The <bag> element offers 
the order-by attribute, which specifies an arbitrary SQL ORDER BY clause for the 
ordering of populated objects. The main shortcoming in <bag> is the lack of objects 
to be used as keys for the elements in the <bag>, which decreases performance when 
updating or deleting elements. When an element of the bag changes, Hibernate 
must update all of the elements since there is no way for Hibernate to find out 
which element has changed. Except for the sort attribute, all of the <set> 
element's attributes are supported by <bag> and have the same meanings.
To see how to use the <bag> element, suppose the papers property of the Student 
class, which is already presented as an instance of java.util.Set, now has changed 
to a property of type java.util.Collection. Although it is not realistic for the user 
to have written duplicate papers, we suppose that is the case in order to demonstrate 
how to use the <bag> element. Here is the Student class and its mapping definition 
with the <bag> element:
public class Student  {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName; 
  private Collection papers = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}

Chapter 6
[ 119 ]
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <bag name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
    </bag>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As with <set>, we used STUDENT_PAPER to maintain the paper file paths. This table 
includes the STUDENT_ID column, which is a foreign key to the primary key of 
the STUDENT table. The paper file paths are stored in the PAPER_PATH column. The 
database structure for the <bag> element is exactly like <set>. The only difference is 
that with <bag> you are allowed to store duplicate elements.
The <idbag> element
Like <bag>, the <idbag> element can be used to map an object of type 
java.util.List, but not necessarily java.util.Collection. However, 
you can use the <idbag> element for a Collection property if the property is 
initialized with an implementation of type java.util.List. Neither <bag> nor 
<idbag> cares about the order of its elements. However, <idbag> uses an additional 
key table column, which improves the performance of updating and deleting the 
collection's elements. Using this column, Hibernate can determine which element 
has changed or been removed. The following code shows the Student class and its 
mapping definition, which now uses the <idbag> element:
public class Student {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName; 
  private Collection papers = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>

[ 120 ]
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <idbag name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">
        <collection-id type="long" column="STUDENT_PAPER_ID">
            <generator class="sequence"/>
        </collection-id>
        <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
        <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
    </idbag>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, we used a nested <collection-id> element inside <idbag>. The 
<collection-id> element specifies the collection table's primary key column, which 
holds the identifier value for each collection's element. The <generator> element 
determines the Hibernate strategy for generating the value for this identifier. In this 
case, we used sequence. Other elements are like those used for the <bag> element. 
The following figure shows the database table structure for this type of mapping:
The STUDENT_PAPER_ID column never affects the Java code. 
Hibernate uses this column internally to manage the collection.
The <list> element
The <list> element, like <bag> and <idbag>, can map an object of type 
java.util.List. However, unlike those elements, <list> uses an extra column 
to maintain the order of the elements in the List. The nested <list-index> 
element is used for this purpose.

Chapter 6
[ 121 ]
Using the <list> element is similar to <set> and <bag>, but without the sort and 
order-by attributes. The following code shows the Student class where its papers 
property has been defined as an instance of java.util.List:
public class Student {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName; 
  private List papers = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
   table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <list name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <list-index column="POSITION"/>
      <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
    </list>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, we have used a nested <list-index> element to specify the column 
which holds the order of each element in the List. Other elements, <key> and 
<element>, have the same meanings as the <set>, <bag>, and <idbag> elements. 
The following figure shows the database table structure for this type of mapping:

More on Mappings
[ 122 ]
The <map> element
The <map> element maps an object of type java.util.Map. The Map object holds 
elements as key/value pairs. Using <map> is similar to using <set>. In the following 
code, our example has changed to show the mapping of a Map property:
public class Student {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName; 
  private Map papers = new HashMap();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
   table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <map name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <map-key column="PAPER_TITLE" type="string"/>
      <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
    </map>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, in the mapping of a Map, we have used a <map-key> nested element 
inside the <map>. The <map-key> specifies the column name in the STUDENT_PAPER 
table, which holds the map's keys. We have named this column PAPER_TITLE, and it 
maintains paper titles as the map's keys. This approach is realistic since no student 
may write two or more papers with the same title. The following figure shows the 
database table structure for the mapping of a Map:

Chapter 6
[ 123 ]
Mapping collections with annotations
Hibernate provides a proprietary org.hibernate.annotations.
CollectionOfElements annotation to map collections which contain value-typed 
elements. Let's get back to our first example, the Student class with a property of 
java.util.Set. We should use the CollectionOfElements annotation as follows 
to map Set:
@org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionOfElements(
    targetElement = java.lang.String.class
)
@JoinTable(
    name = "STUDENT_PAPER",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
)
@Column(name = "PAPER_PATH")
private Set papers = new TreeSet();
The CollectionOfElements annotation has an optional targetElement property, 
which determines the type of objects held by the collection. If generics are used with 
the collection, then there is no need to use this property.
CollectionOfElements can be used with the IndexColumn annotation to map a 
java.util.List:
@org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionOfElements(
    targetElement = java.lang.String.class
)
@JoinTable(
    name = "STUDENT_PAPER",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
) 
@org.hibernate.annotations.IndexColumn(name="POSITION")
@Column(name = "PAPER_PATH")
private List papers = new ArrayList();
If the index of elements doesn't matter, you may omit the IndexColumn annotation, 
and then the list will be mapped as a bag collection.
You may also use CollectionOfElements with the MapKey annotation to map a 
java.util.Map. Here is an example:
@org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionOfElements(
    targetElement = java.lang.String.class
)
@JoinTable(
    name = "STUDENT_PAPER",

More on Mappings
[ 124 ]
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
) 
@org.hibernate.annotations.MapKey(
    columns = @Column(name="PAPER_TITLE")
)
@Column(name = "PAPER_PATH")
private Map papers = new HashMap();
Notice how other parts of this mapping have never changed.
Sorted sets and sorted maps
The <set> and <map> elements can come with an additional attribute called sort. 
Other collection elements, such as <bag>, <idbag>, and <list>, do not provide this 
attribute. The sort attribute allows us to specify whether Hibernate should sort the 
collection elements retrieved from the database. If so, it determines how they should 
be sorted. The possible values for this attribute are as follows:
unsorted does not impose any sort for elements.
natural indicates Hibernate should use a sorted Set or Map implementation, 
SortedSet and SortedMap, to sort the set or map elements. The elements 
inside a SortedSet instance are ordered according to the elements of the 
compareTo() method. The elements of a SortedMap instance are ordered 
according to the compareTo() method of the SortedMap keys. Note that the 
elements of a SortedSet, and the keys of a SortedMap, must implement 
the java.lang.Comparable interface, which causes them to have the 
compareTo() method.
The name of a comparator class: you may use an implementation of the 
java.util.Comparator class to define a different strategy for sorting.
The following examples show how you can specify a sorting strategy.
This example indicates that no sort operation is performed on the map elements:
<map name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER" sort="unsorted">
  <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
  <map-key column="PAPER_TITLE" type="string"/>
  <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
</map>
•
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 125 ]
This example indicates that the map elements must be sorted based on the map key, 
PAPER_TITLE. Since PAPER_TITLE entries are strings, use the String.compareTo() 
method to sort them:
<map name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER" sort="natural">
    <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
    <map-key column="PAPER_TITLE" type="string"/>
    <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
</map>
Finally, we may implement the java.util.Comparator interface to define a new 
strategy for sorting the Map or Set elements. The following code shows a comparator 
class which defines a different strategy for sorting PAPER_TITLE. This class changes 
the normal sort of strings, in which letters always appear before numeric characters:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06;
import java.util.Comparator;
public class CustomStringComparator implements Comparator<String> {
  public int compare(String s1, String s2){
    if(s1.length()==0){
      return -1;
    }
    if(s2.length()==0){
      return 1;
    }
    char ch1 = s1.charAt(0);
    char ch2 = s2.charAt(0);
    if(ch1 == ch2){
      s1 = s1.substring(1, s1.length());
      s2 = s2.substring(1, s2.12	
length());
      return this.compare(s1, s2);
    }else {
      return this.compare(ch1, ch2);
    }
  }
  public int compare(char ch1, char ch2){
    if(Character.isDigit(ch1)&& Character.isLetter(ch2)){
      return 1;
    } else if(Character.isLetter(ch1)&& Character.isDigit(ch2)) {
      return -1;
    }else {
      return ch1 - ch2;
    }
  }
}

More on Mappings
[ 126 ]
To use this comparator, we only need to specify the fully qualified name of the 
CustomStringComparator class as the value for the sort attribute as follows:
<map name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER"
     sort="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.CustomStringComparator">
  <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
  <map-key column="PAPER_TITLE" type="string"/>
  <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH"/>
</map>
<bag>, <idbag>, and <list> cannot be sorted. The list index 
specifies the elements order in the list.
A collection can be sorted or ordered with the Sort annotation, provided by the 
Hibernate annotation API:
@org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionOfElements(
    targetElement = java.lang.String.class
)
@JoinTable(
    name = "STUDENT_PAPER",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
)
@Column(name = "PAPER_PATH")
@org.hibernate.annotations.Sort(
    type = org.hibernate.annotations.SortType.NATURAL
)
private Set papers = new TreeSet();
The type attribute can have one of the SortType's NATURAL, UNSORTED, and 
COMPARATOR values. All of the values have the same meaning as they are already 
used with the <set> and <map> elements. As before, if COMPARATOR is used, you 
need to introduce an implementation of the java.util.Comparator interface, as the 
customized strategy for sorting the Map or Set elements is through the comparator 
attribute. An example which uses CustomStringComparator, recently implemented, 
is as follows:
@org.hibernate.annotations.Sort(
 type = org.hibernate.annotations.SortType.COMPARATOR,
 comparator=com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.CustomStringComparator
)
Other annotations remain unchanged.

Using the order-by attribute to order 
collection elements
The order-by attribute can be used with <bag>, <idbag>, <list>, <set>, and <map> 
to order the collection elements through an ORDER BY clause when the elements are 
retrieved from the database.
For instance, we may use the order-by attribute, instead of sort, with the <map> 
element to order elements based on the map's keys:
<map name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER" order-by="PAPER_TITLE asc">
  <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
  <map-key column="PAPER_TITLE" type="string"/>
  <element type="string" column="PAPER_PATH" not-null="true"/>
</map>
Note that you can use any column of the collection table to order the 
collection's elements.
The Hibernate annotation API provides the OrderBy annotation to determine, how 
a collection should be ordered on load by the database when the objects are fetched. 
The OrderBy annotation uses the clause attribute to determine the SQL order by 
clause in fetching the objects. The equivalent annotation mapping for the XML 
mapping definition above is as follows:
@org.hibernate.annotations.CollectionOfElements(
    targetElement = java.lang.String.class
)
@JoinTable(
    name = "STUDENT_PAPER",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")
)
@Column(name = "PAPER_PATH")
@org.hibernate.annotations.OrderBy(
    clause = "PAPER_TITLE asc"
)
private Set papers = new TreeSet();
The value of the clause attribute is appended to the SQL fragment generated by 
Hibernate to pass to the database.

Mapping object associations
So far in this chapter, you've learned about mapping components. A component is a 
property of a persistent class represented as another persistent class, which is stored 
with its owner class in one table. Instead of persisting associated classes in one table, 
each class may be persisted in its own table. This approach is the subject of this next 
section. We'll begin by looking at different types of object associations and how they 
are represented in the Java object model.
Suppose there are two persistent classes called A and B. The relationship of A and 
B is called one-to-one if any instance of A is associated with only a single instance 
of B, and no more. A one-to-one association is always presented as an instance of B 
defined as a property of A, or vice versa.
The association is called one-to-many from A to B if any instance of A can be 
associated with more than one instance of B. This relationship is established by a 
property of a collection type of B instances in class A. The one-to-many relationship 
from A to B is called many-to-one when going from B to A. In other words, when 
more than one instance of B can be associated with one instance of A.
The final type of relationship, which is rare, is many-to-many: more than one 
instance of A can be associated with more than one instance of B. In this 
relationship, each instance of A holds a collection of B instances, and vice versa.
Let's see how these object relationships can be persisted with Hibernate.
The <one-to-one> element
Two persistent classes may be associated with each other in a one-to-one 
relationship. A relationship is called one-to-one when each instance of a class 
is associated with a single instance of another class, and vice versa. If, when you 
have an instance of one class, and the other instance can be reached, then the 
one-to-one relationship is called bidirectional. On the other hand, if the objects 
cannot be reached from both sides, the relationship is unidirectional.
For example, consider the Phone and Student classes in the previous section. If each 
student has a unique phone number, and no phone number is shared between two or 
more students, the relationship is one-to-one. This is because each Student object is 
associated with only one Phone object, and each Phone object is owned by only one 
Student object. At the database level, a one-to-one relationship is represented using 
either the same primary keys or unique foreign keys.

Chapter 6
[ 129 ]
When an instance of one class is stored, we expect its associated object to be stored 
as well. This scenario can be true for updating and removing. Note that we can 
configure the cascade operation for each class and disable or enable this behavior. 
Hibernate provides the <one-to-one> element to map a one-to-one relationship 
between two persistent classes. We will discuss each strategy in upcoming sections. 
Here is the common form of the <one-to-one> element:
<one-to-one name="propertyName"
            class="className" cascade="none|all|delete|persist|merge|
                   save-update|evict|replicate|lock|refresh"
            property-ref="propertyNameFromAssociatedClass"
                          constraint="true|false">
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
name (mandatory) refers to the name of the associated object.
class (optional) specifies the class name of the associated object. If class 
is not specified, Hibernate maps this property using the reflection API, to 
discover the associated object's class and find the mapping metadata for 
that class. This attribute is useful when the object's class and superclass(es) 
are mapped differently, and we want to map this property as one of its 
superclasses, instead of as its own class.
cascade (optional) determines how changes to the parent object propagate 
to the associated object when the parent is created, updated, or removed.
property-ref (optional) specifies a property of the associated object. The 
value of this property establishes the relationship between two objects.
constraint specifies that a foreign key constraint links the primary key of 
the associated table to the primary key of the owner table. This guarantees 
that an associated row's primary key references a valid owner primary key.
The <one-to-one> element can come with other attributes, such as access and 
lazy, with the same meanings as with <class>.
Using identical primary keys
The first strategy for mapping a one-to-one relationship is to use identical primary 
key values for associated objects. This means each row of one table is associated with 
a row in another table through the same identifier value.

The following code shows Student and Phone classes with a one-to-one relationship. 
As you can see, this relationship is represented by a property of type Phone in the 
Student class. This relationship is unidirectional because the Phone class does not 
maintain any reference for Student:
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private Phone phone; 
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
public class Phone {
  private int id;  private String comment;
  private String number;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
You can use a <one-to-one> element in the mapping definition to map this 
relationship in Student.hbm.xml, as shown in the following code:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
   table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <one-to-one name="phone" 
                class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone"
                cascade="all"
                lazy="false"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
And here is Phone.hbm.xml:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone" table="PHONE">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="number" column="PHONE_NUMBER" type="string"/>
    <property name="comment" column="COMMENT" type="string"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>

Chapter 6
[ 131 ]
The relationship is unidirectional, each Phone object can be reached from its 
respective Student, but not the reverse. To change the relationship to bidirectional, 
first, Phone must maintain a reference to its respective Student, and second, 
the Phone mapping must include a one-to-one relationship. The following code 
illustrates the changes in the Phone class:
public class Phone {
  private int id;  private String comment;
  private String number;
  private Student student;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
Student.hbm.xml remains unchanged, but Phone.hbm.xml changes as follows:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone" table="PHONE">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="number" column="PHONE_NUMBER" type="string"/>
    <property name="comment" column="COMMENT" type="string"/>
    <one-to-one name="student" property-ref="phone" 
                class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.06.Student"
                cascade="all"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
JPA provides the OneToOne annotation for mapping a one-to-one relationship. To 
map a one-to-one relationship using the identical primary keys strategy, we also 
need the PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation. The following code shows how our 
recent example is mapped through JPA annotations:
@Entity
public class Student {
  @Id
  private int id;
  @OneToOne
  @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn
  private Phone phone; 
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}

More on Mappings
[ 132 ]
If you want to make this relation bidirectional, you need to provide a property of 
type Student in the Phone class, and use the OneToOne annotation with the 
mappedBy, as follows:
public class Phone {
  @OneToOne(mappedBy="student")
  private Student student;
}
As you can see, the value of the mappedBy attribute is the property name, which 
holds a reference of Student in the Phone class.
Foreign key one-to-one
This strategy uses a foreign key column to establish the one-to-one relationship 
between two tables. One table has an extra column as a foreign key to the primary 
key of the other table. To map this relationship, use a <many-to-one> element 
instead of <one-to-one>, because when we say a table has a foreign key to another 
table, many rows in the source table can naturally refer to one single row in the 
target table. However, if the foreign key column is defined as unique, this strategy 
guarantees that only a single row in the source table can be associated with a row in 
the target table.
Student.hbm.xml should change as follows:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
   table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <many-to-one name="phone"
                 class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone"
                 column="PHONE_ID" unique="true"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
And Phone.hbm.xml will change as follows:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone" table="PHONE">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>

Chapter 6
[ 133 ]
    <property name="number" column="PHONE_NUMBER" type="string"/>
    <property name="comment" column="COMMENT" type="string"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
In this example, we have used the <many-to-one> element, which is discussed later 
in this chapter. For now, just note that this element specifies that the STUDENT table 
has a foreign key column, named PHONE_ID, to the primary key of the associated 
table, PHONE.
As before, to change the relationship to bidirectional, first, Phone must maintain a 
reference to its respective Student, and second, the Phone mapping must include a 
one-to-one relationship:
public class Phone {
  private int id;  private String comment;
  private String number;
  private Student student;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Phone" table="PHONE">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="number" column="PHONE_NUMBER" type="string"/>
    <property name="comment" column="COMMENT" type="string"/>
    <one-to-one name="student"
         class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"
                constrained="false" property-ref="phone" />
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, the <one-to-one> element uses two attributes: constrained 
and property-ref. The property-ref element indicates the name of a property 
in the Student object by which the associated Phone object is represented. 
constrained="true" adds a foreign key constraint which links the primary key of 
the PHONE table to the primary key of the STUDENT table. This approach guarantees 
that a PHONE row's primary key always references a valid STUDENT primary key.

More on Mappings
[ 134 ]
The OneToOne annotation can also be used to map a one-to-one relationship using 
the foreign key strategy. For this purpose, you need to use JoinColumn annotation. 
The JoinColumn annotation uses a name attribute which specifies the foreign key 
constraint. The following shows how these annotations are used to map our simple 
one-to-one relationship:
public class Student {
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name="PHONE_ID")
private Phone phone;
}
As with identical primary keys, to make the relation bidirectional you need to 
provide a property of type Student in the Phone class, and use the OneToOne 
annotation with the mappedBy, as follows.
The <many-to-one> element
The <many-to-one> element maps a many-to-one relationship. A relationship is 
called many-to-one when multiple instances of a class are associated with a single 
instance of another class. For example, suppose that more than one student can have 
the same address because they live in the same household. Therefore, many Student 
objects can be associated with one and only one Address object. This relationship is 
usually carried out in the database by defining a foreign key in the many-class table 
which points into the primary key of the one-class table. The common form of this 
element is as follows:
<many-to-one
        name="propertyName"
        column="columnName"
        class="className"
        lazy="proxy|no-proxy|false"
        not-found="ignore|exception">
…
</many-to-one>
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
name (mandatory) determines the name of the property inside the many-side 
class, representing the associated object (the one side).
column (optional) specifies the foreign key column in the many-side table 
that points to the primary key of the one side. If this attribute is missed, the 
name attribute is used as the column name.
•
•

Chapter 6
[ 135 ]
class (optional) represents the class name of the associated object. The 
default value is the property type determined by reflection.
lazy (optional) specifies whether the one-side object loads when the 
many-side object is loaded. Possible values are proxy, no-proxy, and 
false. The default is proxy, which tells Hibernate to load the associated 
object lazily with proxy generation. no-proxy indicates that Hibernate 
should use interception to load the associated object lazily. false means 
Hibernate should always load the associated object with the parent. 
Proxies and interceptions are discussed in Chapter 8.
not-found (optional) describes Hibernate's behavior when the associated 
object (on the one side) does not exist. Hibernate either throws an exception 
or ignores it.
Other attributes for this element are cascade, update, insert, and access, which 
have the same meanings as with <class>.
As we saw earlier, the relationship between the Student and Address objects can 
be considered a many-to-one relationship. Therefore, we will have the Student and 
Address classes as follows:
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private Address address; 
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
public class Address {
  private int id;
  private String street;
  private String city; 
  private String zipCode;
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
The following code shows the mapping for this relation. Note that this example 
shows a unidirectional many-to-one relationship. We always reach an Address from 
its associated Student object, not vice versa. This relationship can be bidirectional if 
the Address class has a property of collections.
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <many-to-one name="address"
                 column="ADDRESS_ID"  
•

•

More on Mappings
[ 136 ]
                 cascade="all"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
And this is Phone.hbm.xml:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Address" 
   table="ADDRESS">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="street" column="STREET" type="string"/>
    <property name="city" column="CITY" type="string"/>
    <property name="zipCode" column="ZIP_CODE" type="string"/>
  <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
We used cascade="all" above to indicate that any operation (save, update, delete, 
and so on) on the many-side object (Student objects) should be propagated to the 
one-side object. Note that the new ADDRESS_ID column in the STUDENT table has 
been defined as a foreign key, pointing to the primary key of the ADDRESS table.
Any many-to-one relationship can be expressed with a one-to-many relationship 
on the opposite side. In other words, if object A has a relationship with more than 
one instance of B, then more than one instance of B may be associated with a single 
instance of A. The one-to-many relationship is always presented as a collection 
of many-side objects in the one-side object. Let's see how to map this type of 
relationship in Hibernate.
JPA provides the ManyToOne annotation to map a many-to-one relationship. 
The following code shows how this annotation is used to map our example:
public class Student {
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name="ADDRESS_ID")
  private Address address;
}
The JoinColumn annotation specifies the foreign key column. This annotation is 
optional. If it is omitted, Hibernate automatically combines the name of the property, 
an underscore, and the database identifier name.

Chapter 6
[ 137 ]
The <one-to-many> element
As with the <many-to-one> element, the <one-to-many> element maps a 
many-to-one relationship, but in the opposite direction. In other words, the 
<one-to-many> element maps a many-to-one relationship in which many objects 
can be reached through their single associated object.
For example, the relationship between School and Student objects can be 
considered one-to-many, because each School object is associated with more than 
one Student object.
The one-to-many relationship is formed when an object (the one side) has a reference 
to more than one other object (the many side). On the many side, each object has a 
reference to only one object. Although this relationship is bidirectional, the reference 
from the one side can be omitted to make it unidirectional.
To establish this relationship in the database, you need an extra column in the 
many-side table which is a foreign key to the primary key in the one-side table. 
The following figure shows the database view of persisting the Student and 
School relationship:
The <one-to-many> element is commonly used in this form:
<one-to-many class="className" not-found="exception|ignore"/>
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
class (optional) specifies the class name of the many-side associated object.
not-found (optional) describes Hibernate's behavior when the many-side 
associated object does not exist by loading the entity object. The possible 
values are exception and ignore, meaning Hibernate must either throw 
an exception or ignore it.
In the Java object model, any one-to-many relationship is represented by an array, 
or by collection instances of the many-side object in the one-side object if the object 
relationship is navigable from the one side to the many side.

More on Mappings
[ 138 ]
Note that since each collection is mapped by using a <list>, <bag>, <idbag>, 
<map>, or <set> element, mapping a one-to-many relationship enforces using 
one of these elements.
Also, note again that each one-to-many relationship on the one side means a 
many-to-one relationship on the other side. For example, the navigation from 
School to Student involves a one-to-many relationship, and the opposite navigation 
involves a many-to-one relationship. The application designer may choose either a 
unidirectional or a bidirectional relationship for persistent objects, and does so based 
on the application's requirements.
These are the Student and School classes:
public class School {
  private int id; 
  private String name;
  private List students = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
public class Student {
  private int id; 
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName; 
  //other fields and getter/setter methods
}
Hibernate provides <list>, <bag>, <idbag>, <map>, or <set> elements for 
mapping Java collections and maps, such as java.util.List, java.util.Map, 
and java.util.Set. Since any one-to-many relationship on the one side is 
represented by a Java collection or map, one of these elements is used for 
mapping the one-to-many relationship. The following code shows the mapping 
of the unidirectional relationship between the Student and School classes. The 
relationship is navigable only from School to Student. Here is the School.hbm.xml:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <bag name="students" cascade="all" >
      <key column="SCHOOL_ID"/>

Chapter 6
[ 139 ]
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"/>
    </bag>
  <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
And the following is the Student.hbm.xml:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="firstName"  column="FIRST_NAME"  type="string"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Here, the <bag> element maps the java.util.List object. The nested <key> 
element inside the <bag> maps the foreign key column in the many-side table 
to the primary key of the one-side table. The <bag> element uses the nested 
<one-to-many> element inside, which determines that the relationship is 
between the School and Student classes.
To map this relationship with annotations, you can simply use OneToMany annotation 
with the mappedBy attribute as follows:
public class School {
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "school")
  private List students = new ArrayList();
}
To change this relationship to bidirectional, make these changes:
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName; 
  private School school;
  //other fields and setter/getter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>

  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"

    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">

    </id>
    <property name="firstName" column="FIRST_NAME" type="string"/>
    <many-to-one name="school"  
                 class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
                 column="SCHOOL_ID"  
                 cascade="all"/>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, the Student class maintains a reference to the associated School 
object. The mapping definition for the Student class now includes a <many-to-one> 
element which defines the mapping of the school property in the Student class.
The ManyToOne annotation is used as follows to map the reverse side of the 
one-to-many relationship:
public class Student {
  @ManyToOne
  @JoinColumn(name = "SCHOOL_ID")
  private School school;
}
Mapping a one-to-many relationship with other 
collections
In all of the examples we've seen so far, the one-to-many relationship is represented 
by an instance of java.util.List in the object model. This object is always mapped 
with the <bag> element. However, a one-to-many relationship can be represented by 
another collection, and may be mapped with another element as well. In this section, 
I have shown how you can map other collections, which maintain entity types, 
with Hibernate.

Chapter 6
[ 141 ]
Mapping a set of entity types
Suppose the School class uses an instance of java.util.Set to maintain its 
associated Student objects:
public class School  {
  private int id; 
  private String name; 
  private Set students;
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
You can map this with the following mapping definition:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <set name="students" cascade="all" >
      <key column="SCHOOL_ID"/>
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"/>
    </set>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, we have a <set> element to map the students property of the 
School class. This <set> element nests with the <key> and <one-to-many> 
elements. The <key> element determines the table column that stores Student 
objects, which is a foreign key to the primary key value of the associated School 
object. In our example, there is a SCHOOL_ID column in the STUDENT table, which is a 
foreign key to the primary key of the SCHOOL table. The <element> element specifies 
the type and destination of each element in the Set, and here, it is the Student class. 
To make this relationship with JPA, you can easily use the OneToMany annotation to 
map the students property as the many side of the relationship, as shown in 
the following:
public class School {
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "school")
  private Set students = new HashSet();
}

Note that you do not specify the foreign key column used to persist the 
relationship. This constraint is specified on the other side, where the 
many-to-one relationship is mapped.
Mapping a collection of entity types with <idbag>
Consider the School class that now uses an instance of java.util.Collection to 
refer to its associated Student objects:
public class  School {
  private int id; 
  private String name; 
  private Collection students = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
The mapping definition is as follows:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <idbag name="students" cascade="all" order-by="firstName">
      <collection-id column="ID" type="int"> 
        <generator class="native"/>
      </collection-id>
      <key column="SCHOOL_ID"/>
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"/>
    </idbag>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, the <idbag> nests with three subelements: <collection-id>, <key>, 
and <one-to-many>. The <collection-id> element specifies the primary key 
column of the collection table, which holds the identifier value for each collection's 
element and identifier generation strategy. <one-to-many> specifies the type and 
destination of each element in the Collection. In our case, it's the Student class.

Chapter 6
[ 143 ]
Mapping a list of entity types
Assume that the School class uses an instance of java.util.List to maintain its 
associated Student objects:
public class School {
  private int id; 
  private String name; 
  private List students = new ArrayList();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <list name="students" cascade="all" >
      <key column="SCHOOL_ID"/>
      <index column="POSITION"/>
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"/>
    </list>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Using a <list> element to map a one-to-many relationship is similar to using it for 
value types, except that the <list> element uses a nested <one-to-many> element to 
specify the persistent instances are held by the java.util.List instance.
Mapping a java.util.Map of entity types
The following School class uses a Map to hold the Student associated objects:
public class School {
  private int id; 
  private String name; 
  private Map students = new HashMap();
  //other fields and setter/gettter methods
}

[ 144 ]
Here is the mapping definition for this class:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <map name="students" cascade="all">
      <key column="SCHOOL_ID"/>
      <index column="SCHOOL_KEY" type="string"/>
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"/>
    </map>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Using a <map> element here is similar to using it for value types, except that the 
<map> element uses a nested <one-to-many> element to specify the type of the List 
elements. In our case, it's the Student class. The SCHOOL_KEY column in the STUDENT 
table maintains the key of each map value. JPA provides the MapKey annotation to 
provide information about the key of the map in relationships which are established 
through java.util.Map. For our example, we would have the following to map 
the relationship:
@MapKey(name="ID")
@OneToMany
private Map students = new HashMap();
MapKey used a name attribute which maps a property of the target entity as the key of 
the map.
The <many-to-many> element
The <many-to-many> element maps a many-to-many relationship. A relationship 
is called many-to-many when each instance of one class is associated with many 
instances of another class, and vice versa. The following figure shows an example 
of a many-to-many relationship between Student and Course objects. As you can 
see in the figure, each Student object can be associated with more than one Course 
object, and vice versa:

Chapter 6
[ 145 ]
 
A many-to-many relationship is usually mapped by using three tables: one for each 
class, and one for expressing their relationship, as shown in the following figure. The 
intermediate table has two columns: one column is a foreign key to the first table's 
primary key, and the other column is a foreign key to the second table's primary key:
The <many-to-many> element is used like this:
<many-to-many column="columnName"
              class="className"
              not-found="ignore|exception"
              property-ref="propertyNameFromAssociatedClass"/>
The meanings of these attributes and their possible values are as follows:
column (optional) refers to the column in the intermediate table which 
maintains the associated object's identifiers.
class (mandatory) specifies the class name of the associated objects.
not-found (optional) determines Hibernate's behavior when an associated 
object identifier exists in the intermediate table, but does not exist in the 
mapped table. Valid values are exception and ignore, meaning Hibernate 
should either throw an exception or ignore it.
property-ref (optional) is used for nonprimary-key associations. This 
attribute specifies a property name of the associated object that must be used 
(instead of the identifier of the associated object) to establish association.

JPA provides the ManyToMany annotation to map a many-to-many relationship. It's 
very simple and easy to use. The following code shows how this annotation can be 
used to map our example:
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
  name = "STUDENT_COURSE",
  joinColumns = {@JoinColumn(name = "STUDENT_ID")},
  inverseJoinColumns = {@JoinColumn(name = "COURSE_ID")}
)
private List courses = new ArrayList();
Note where the intermediate table's name and its columns names appear. This 
relationship is unidirectional. However, you could make it bidirectional with the 
following changes:
public class Course {
  privae int id; 
  private String name; 
  private List students = new ArrayList(); 
  //other fields and setter/getter methods
}
<!-- Course.hbm.xml -->
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Course" 
table="COURSE">
    <id name="id" type="int" column="ID">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="name" column="NAME" type="string"/>
    <bag name="students"  
         cascade="all" 
         table="STUDENT_COURSE" 
         lazy="false">
      <key column="COURSE_ID"/>
      <many-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch06.Student"
                    column="STUDENT_ID"/>
    </bag>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>

[ 148 ]
To map bidirectional many-to-many relationship, you simply need to put another 
ManyToMany annotation on the opposite side of the relationship, as follows:
@ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
private List students = new ArrayList();
The mappedBy attribute refers to the name of property, which holds a list of courses.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed some of the more advanced concepts behind mapping. 
We started our discussion by introducing the <component> element to map a class 
property which is represented as an object of the other class in a single table.
We continued with different kinds of object associations and their mapping. In 
practice, there are four kinds of associations: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, 
and many-to-many. For each kind of association, a corresponding element exists in 
Hibernate mapping. A relationship is called bidirectional, if we can reach one side of 
the association from the other side, and vice versa. In contrast, a relationship is called 
unidirectional when we can navigate the relationship in one direction only.
Hibernate allows you to map collections using <list>, <bag>, <idbag>, <set>, and 
<map> elements. These elements always appear in a one-to-many or a many-to-many 
relationship. While <list>, <bag>, and <idbag> are used to map a collection object 
of type java.util.List, <map> and <set> are used to map objects of type 
java.util.Map and java.util.Set, respectively.
<list> lets you preserve the ordering of collection elements. <idbag> and <bag> 
act similarly, and neither cares about the elements order. However, <idbag> uses 
an extra column to enhance the performance of update and delete operations.

Hibernate Types
Hibernate allows transparent persistence, which means the application is absolutely 
isolated from the underlying database storage format. Three players in the Hibernate 
scene implement this feature: Hibernate dialect, Hibernate types, and HQL. The 
Hibernate dialect allows us to use a range of different databases, supporting 
different, proprietary variants of SQL and column types. In addition, HQL allows 
us to query persisted objects, regardless of their relational persisted form in 
the database.
Hibernate types are a representation of databases SQL types, provide an abstraction 
of the underlying database types, and prevent the application from getting involved 
with the actual database column types. They allow us to develop the application 
without worrying about the target database and the column types that the database 
supports. Instead, we get involved with mapping Java types to Hibernate types. The 
database dialect, as part of Hibernate, is responsible for transforming Java types to 
SQL types, based on the target database. This gives us the flexibility to change the 
database to one that may support different column types or SQL without changing 
the application code.
In this chapter, we will discuss the Hibernate types. We will see how Hibernate 
provides built-in types that map to common database types. We'll also see how 
Hibernate allows us to implement and use custom types when these built-in types 
do not satisfy the application's requirements, or when we want to change the default 
behavior of a built-in type. As you will see, you can easily implement a custom-type 
class and then use it in the same way as a built-in one.

Hibernate Types
[ 150 ]
Built-in types
Hibernate includes a rich and powerful range of built-in types. These types satisfy 
most needs of a typical application, providing a bridge between basic Java types and 
common SQL types. Java types mapped with these types range from basic, simple 
types, such as long and int, to large and complex types, such as Blob and Clob. The 
following table categorizes Hibernate built-in types with corresponding Java and 
SQL types:

Although the SQL types specified in the table above are standard SQL types, your 
database may support somewhat different SQL types. Refer to your database 
documentation to find out which types you may use instead of the standard SQL 
types shown in the table above.
Don't worry about the SQL types that your database supports. The SQL 
dialect and JDBC driver are always responsible for transforming the Java 
type values to appropriate SQL type representations.
The type attribute specifies Hibernate types in mapping definitions. This helps 
Hibernate to create an appropriate SQL statement when the class property is stored, 
updated, or retrieved from its respective column.
The type attribute may appear in different places in a mapping file. You may use it 
with the <id>, <property>, <discriminator>, <index>, and <element> elements. 
Here is a sample mapping file with some type attributes in different locations:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="Person" table="PERSON" discriminator-value="PE">
    <id name="id" column="ID" type="long">
      <generator class="native"/>
    </id>
    <discriminator column="PERSON_TYPE" type="string"/>
    <property name="birthdate" column="BIRTHDATE" type="date"/>
    <list name="papers" table="STUDENT_PAPER">

Hibernate Types
[ 152 ]
        <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
        <list-index column="POSITION"/>
        <element column="PAPER_PATH" type="string"/>
    </list>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
If a property is mapped without the type attribute, Hibernate uses the reflection 
API to find the actual type of that property and uses the corresponding Hibernate 
type for it. However, you should specify the type attribute if that property can be 
mapped with more than one Hibernate type. For example, if a property is of type 
java.lang.String, and its mapping definition does not include the type attribute, 
Hibernate will use the reflection API and select the type string for it. This means 
you need to explicitly define the Hibernate type for a Java String if you want to 
map the String with a character or text Hibernate type.
Custom types
For most mappings, Hibernate's built-in types are enough. However, in some 
situations, you may need to define a custom type. These situations generally happen 
when we want Hibernate to treat basic Java types or persistent classes differently 
than it normally would. Here are some situations where you may need to define 
and use a custom type:
Storing a particular Java type in a column with a different SQL type 
than Hibernate normally uses: For example, you might want to store a 
java.util.Date object in a column of type VARCHAR, or a String object 
in a DATE column.
Mapping a value type: Value types, the dependent persistent classes that do 
not have their own identifiers, can be mapped with custom types. This means 
you can treat value types similarly to primitive types and map them with 
the <property> element, instead of <component>. For example, the Phone 
class in the previous chapter was mapped with <component>. You could 
implement custom type and use it to map Phone objects with <property>.
Splitting up a single property value and storing the result in more than 
one database column: For example, assume that any phone number is 
split-up into four components—representing country code, area code, 
exchange, and line number, stored in four columns of the database. We may 
take this approach to provide a search facility for countries, areas, exchanges, 
and line numbers. If the phone numbers are represented as long numbers 
populated from four columns, we need to define a custom type and tell 
Hibernate how to assemble the number.

Chapter 7
[ 153 ]
Storing more than one property in a single column: For example, in 
Chapter 6, the papers property of the Student class was represented as 
an object of java.util.List and held the file paths of all of the papers 
the student has written. You can define a custom type to persist all of the 
papers file paths as a semicolon-separated string in a single column.
Using an application-specific class as an identifier for the persistent 
class: For example, suppose you want to use the application-specific 
class CustomIdentifier, instead of the int, long, String, and so on, 
for persistent class identifiers. In this case, you also need to implement 
an IdentifierGenerator to tell Hibernate how to create new identifier 
values for non-persisted objects.
In practice, other use cases also need custom types for implementation and use. In 
all of these situations, you must tell Hibernate how to map a particular Java type 
to a database representation. You do this by implementing one of the interfaces 
which Hibernate provides for this purpose. The basic and most commonly used of 
these interfaces include org.hibernate.usertype.UserType and org.hibernate.
usertype.CompositeUserType. Let's look at these in detail, discussing their 
differences, and how to use them.
UserType
UserType is the most commonly used Hibernate extension type. This interface 
exposes basic methods for defining a custom type. Here, we introduce a simple case 
and show how a custom type can provide a convenient mapping definition for it.
Suppose that the history of any school is represented by an individual class, 
History. Obviously, the History class is a value type, because no other persistent 
class uses the History class for its own use. This means that all History objects 
depend on School objects. Moreover, each school has its own history, and history 
is never shared between schools. Here is the School class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07;
import java.io.Serializable;
public class School implements Serializable {
  private long id;
  private History history ;
  //other fields
  //setter and getter methods
  public long getId() {
    return id;
  }
•
•

Hibernate Types
[ 154 ]
  public void setId(long id) {
    this.id = id;
  }
  public History getHistory() {
    return history;
  }
  public void setHistory(History history) {
    this.history = history;
  }
    
  //other setters and getters
}
And this is the History class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Date;
public class History implements Serializable {
  long initialCapacity;
  Date establishmentDate;
  public long getInitialCapacity() {
    return initialCapacity;
  }
  public void setInitialCapacity(long initialCapacity) {
    this.initialCapacity = initialCapacity;
  }
  public Date getEstablishmentDate() {
    return establishmentDate;
  }
  public void setEstablishmentDate(Date establishmentDate) {
    this.establishmentDate = establishmentDate;
  }
}
Note that I have intentionally omitted all irrelevant fields of the 
two classes to keep the example simple.

Chapter 7
[ 155 ]
Our strategy in mapping a value type so far is to use one table for persisting both the 
persistent class and its associated value types. Based on this strategy, we need to use 
a SCHOOL table, which stores all of the School and History properties, and then map 
both School and its History class into that table through the <component> element 
in the mapping file. The mapping definition for School and its associated History 
class is as follows:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07.School" 
table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="long" column="id">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <component name="history"
               class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07.History">
      <property name="initialCapacity" column="INITIAL_CAPACITY"
                type="long"/>
      <property name="establishmentDate" column="ESTABLISHMENT_DATE"
                type="date"/> 
    </component>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As an alternative approach, you can map the History class with a custom type. You 
do this by implementing a custom type, HistoryType, which defines how to map 
History objects to the target table. Actually, Hibernate does not persist a custom 
type. Instead, the custom type gives Hibernate information about how to persist a 
value type in the database. Let's implement a basic custom type by implementing 
the UserType interface. In the next section of this chapter, we'll discuss how to 
map History with an implementation of another Hibernate custom type interface, 
CompositeUserType.
The following code shows the HistoryType class that implements the UserType 
interface, providing a custom type for the History class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07;
import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Types;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Date;

import org.hibernate.HibernateException;

Hibernate Types
[ 158 ]
The following table provides a short description for the methods in the 
UserType interface:
Method
Description
public int[] sqlTypes()
This method returns an array of int, telling 
Hibernate which SQL column types to use for 
persisting the entity properties. You may use 
the SQL types defined as constants in the java.
sql.Types class directly, or you may call the 
sqlType() method of Hibernate types defined 
as constants in the org.hibernate.Hibernate 
class. For example, in HistoryType, recently 
discussed, you may alternatively define the types 
as follows:
private int[] types = {Hibernate.
BIG_INTEGER.sqlType(),Hibernate.DATE.
sqlType()};
Note that you should specify the SQL types in 
the order in which they appear in the subsequent 
methods.
public Class 
returnedClass()
This method specifies which Java value type is 
mapped by this custom type.
public boolean isMutable()
This method specifies whether the value type 
is mutable. Since immutable objects cannot be 
updated or deleted by the application, defining the 
value type as immutable allows Hibernate to do 
some minor performance optimization.
public Object 
deepCopy(Object value)
This method creates a copy of the value type if 
the value type is mutable. Otherwise, it returns 
the current instance. Note that when you create a 
copy of an object, you should also copy the object 
associations and collections.
public Serializable 
disassemble(Object value)
Hibernate may cache any value-type instance in 
its second-level cache. For this purpose, Hibernate 
calls this method to convert the value-type instance 
to the serialized binary form. Return the current 
instance if the value type implements the java.
io.Serializable interface, otherwise, convert 
it to a Serializable object. Chapter 12 discusses 
Hibernate cache services and strategies.
public Object 
assemble(Serializable 
cached, Object owner)
Hibernate calls this method when the instance is 
fetched from the second-level cache and converted 
back from binary serialized to the object form.

Chapter 7
[ 159 ]
Method
Description
public Object 
replace(Object original, 
Object target, Object 
owner)
Assume that the application maintains an instance 
of the value type that its associated session has 
already closed. As you will see in Chapter 8, such 
objects are not tracked and managed by Hibernate, 
so they are called detached. Hibernate lets you 
merge the detached object with a session-managed 
persistent object through the session's merge() 
method. Hibernate calls the replace() method 
when two instances, detached and session-
managed, are merged. The first and second 
arguments of this method are value-type instances 
associated with a detached and session-managed 
persistent object, respectively. The third argument 
represents the owner object, the persistent object 
that owns the original value type: School in our 
case. This method replaces the existing (target) 
value in the persistent object we are merging, 
with a new (original) value from the detached 
persistent object we are merging. For immutable 
objects or null values, return the first argument. For 
mutable objects, return at least a copy of the first 
argument through the deepCopy() method. We 
will discuss the merge operation in Chapter 8.
public Object 
nullSafeGet(ResultSet 
resultSet, String[] names, 
Object owner)
This method constructs the value-type instance, 
when the instance is retrieved from the database. 
resultset is the JDBC ResultSet object 
containing the instance values, names is an array 
of the column names queried, and owner is 
the persistent object associated with the value-
type instance. Note that you should handle the 
possibility of null values.
public void nullSafeSet
(PreparedStatement 
statement, Object value, 
int index)
This method is called when the value-type instance 
is written to a prepared statement to be stored or 
updated in the database. Handle the possibility 
of null values. A multi-column type should be 
written to parameters starting from index.
public boolean 
equals(Object x, Object y)
This method compares two instances of the value 
type mapped by this custom type to check whether 
they are equal.
public int hashCode(
Object x)
This method returns a hashcode for the instance, 
consistent with persistence equality.

Hibernate Types
[ 160 ]
In some of the methods shown in the table above, the owner object is passed as an 
argument to the method. You can use this object if you need the other properties of 
the value-type instance. For example, you can access a property of the owner if you 
need it to calculate the value for a value-type property.
Serializing and caching issue
If the value type, in our case History, does not implement the 
java.io.Serializable interface, then its respective custom type 
is responsible for properly serializing or deserializing the value type. 
Otherwise, the value-type instances cannot be cached by the Hibernate 
second-level cache service.
To use the defined custom type, you need to edit the mapping file as shown below:
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07.School" 
   table="SCHOOL">
    <id name="id" type="long" column="id">
      <generator class="increment"/>
    </id>
    <property name="history"    
              type="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07.
     HistoryType">
      <column="INITIAL_CAPACITY" type="long"/>
      <column="ESTABLISHMENT_DATE" type="date"/> 
    </property>
    <!-- mapping of other fields -->
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Note that you should specify the columns in order, corresponding to the order 
of types returned by the getTypes() method and the index of the values the 
nullSafeGet() and nullSafeSet() handle.
So far, all we have done is implemented a custom type in the simplest form. The 
implemented custom type only transforms the value-type instances to the database 
columns and vice versa. A custom type may be more complicated than we have 
seen so far, and can do much more sophisticated things. The advantage of this 
implemented custom type is obvious: we can define our own strategy for mapping 
value types. For instance, a property of the value type can be stored in more than one 
column, or more than one property can be stored in a single column.

Chapter 7
[ 161 ]
The main shortcoming of this approach is that, we have hidden the value-type 
properties from Hibernate. Therefore, Hibernate does not know anything about 
the properties inside the value type, or how to query persistent objects based on 
their associated value types as problem constraints are involved. Let's look at 
CompositeUserType and how it can solve this problem.
CompositeUserType
Another way to define a custom type is to use the CompositeUserType interface. 
This type is similar to UserType, but with more methods to expose the internals of 
your value-type class to Hibernate. CompositeUserType is useful when application 
query expressions include constraints on value-type properties. If you want to 
query the persistent objects with constraints on their associated value types, map 
the associated value types with CompositeUserType. The following code shows the 
CompositeHistoryType implementation for History:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07;
import org.hibernate.usertype.CompositeUserType;
import org.hibernate.type.Type;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;

Hibernate Types
[ 164 ]
As you can see, this interface exposes some extra methods not seen in UserType. The 
following table shows the functionality of these methods:
Method
Description
public String[] 
getPropertyNames()
This method returns the names of 
the value type's properties that may 
appear in the query constraints. In the 
example shown in the code above, we 
have used both the initialCapacity 
and establishmentDate properties, 
meaning the application can query 
the persistent objects based on these 
property values.
public Type[] getPropertyTypes()
This method returns the corresponding 
types of the properties specified by 
the getPropertyNames() method. 
Each returned Type in the array 
corresponds to a property name with 
the same index in the array returned 
by getPropertyNames(). Each type 
is expressed as an instance of the org.
hibernate.type.Type interface, 
defined as a static member in the org.
hibernate.Hibernate class, or 
a custom type implemented by the 
developer.
public Object 
getPropertyValue(Object 
component, int property)
This method returns a property's value. It 
takes two arguments. The first argument 
is the value-type instance that holds the 
property value we want to fetch. The 
second argument specifies the index of 
the property, based on the property name 
returned by getPropertyNames().
public void 
setPropertyValue(Object 
component, int property, Object 
value)
Hibernate uses this method to assign 
a value to any property of the value-
type instance. This method takes three 
arguments. The first argument refers to the 
value-type instance, the second specifies 
the index of the property based on position 
of the property in the array returned by 
getPropertyNames(), and the third is 
the value assigned to the property.

Chapter 7
[ 165 ]
Using this custom type is same as using UserType, except that you need to specify 
the CompositeHistoryType instead of HistoryType as follows:
<property name="history" 
          type="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch07.
CompositeHistoryType">
  <column="INITIAL_CAPACITY" type="long"/>
  <column="ESTABLISHMENT_DATE" type="date"/> 
</property>
As mentioned earlier, this custom type provides an ability to query on properties of 
the History type. As you will see in Chapter 9, HQL is one approach provided by 
Hibernate to query the persistent object. For instance, suppose we are interested in 
schools established before 1980. The following code shows querying these objects 
with HQL, a Hibernate-specific query language that works with objects:
Calendar c = Calendar.getInstance();
c.set(Calendar.YEAR, 1980);
Query q = session.createQuery(
"select s from School s where s.history.establishmentDate < :edate" 
).setParameter("edate", new Date(c.getTimeInMillis()));
All we have done in this snippet is created a Query object with an HQL expression 
indicating all School objects with establishment date before 1980. Note that 
HistoryCompositeType provides the ability to query the School object with criteria 
applied to History objects. (Don't worry about this for now since upcoming chapters 
cover it in detail.)
The only advantage of CompositeUserType over UserType is that 
CompositeUserType exposes the value-type properties for Hibernate. Therefore, 
it lets you query persistent instances based on values of their associated 
value-type instances.

Hibernate Types
[ 166 ]
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed Hibernate types, which define the mapping of each Java 
type to an SQL type. It is the responsibility of the Hibernate dialect and the JDBC 
driver to convert the Java types to the actual target SQL types. This means a Java 
type may be transformed to different SQL types when different databases are used.
Although Hibernate provides a rich set of data types, called built-in types, some 
situations require the definition of a new type. One such situation occurs when you 
want to change Hibernate's default behavior for mapping a Java type to an SQL 
type. Another situation is when you want to split up a class property to a set of table 
columns, or merge a set of properties to a table column.
Built-in types include primitive, string, byte array, time, localization, serializable, 
and JDBC large types.
Hibernate provides several interfaces for implementation by custom types. The 
most commonly used interfaces are org.hibernate.usertype.UserType and 
org.hibernate.usertype.CompositeUserType. The basic extension point is 
UserType. It allows us to map a value-type, but hides the value-type properties 
from Hibernate, so it does not provide the application with the ability to query 
value types. In contrast, CompositeUserType exposes the value-type properties 
to Hibernate, and allows Hibernate to query the value-types.

Hibernate Persistence 
Behavior
After you've configured Hibernate, it is ready to be used to persist application 
objects. An API, called the Session API, is responsible for persistence in Hibernate. 
This chapter discusses the life cycle of persistent objects in the application's lifetime: 
the states persistent objects go through with respect to persistence. Then, we'll delve 
into basic persistence operations, which trigger changes to the objects' state provided 
by the Session API. Finally, we'll look at some hot topics in object persistence, 
mainly, cascading operation and lazy loading.
The life cycle of persistent objects
Persistent classes follow the simple POJO rules without calling any Hibernate APIs. 
In other words, no persistent class is aware of its own persistence capability. This is 
why Hibernate is called a transparent persistence provider. Transparent persistence 
allows us to develop persistent classes regardless of the underlying persistence 
technology, whether it be Hibernate or another solution. Each POJO object can be 
stored by Hibernate if it meets these conditions:
Its fields are storable in the database.
There is a table in the database to store the object.
There is a mapping definition that determines how to map each field of the 
object to a table column.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 168 ]
To persist objects, the application must call Hibernate through its interfaces, usually 
Session instances. The persistent objects that are passed and given back through 
sessions have these states in their life cycles:
Transient
Persistent
Detached
Removed
Let's look at each of these states.
Transient objects
Transient refers to persistent objects, which are not yet been persisted, and are not 
associated with any table's row in the database. These objects are not stored until 
they are explicitly stored by the issuance of a persistence request to Hibernate. 
Moreover, Hibernate considers transient objects in a nontransactional context: 
Hibernate does not monitor them for any modification, so there is no roll-back 
mechanism for them. Unless Hibernate is asked to persist these objects, Hibernate 
does not care about them, whether they are created, modified, or removed. When the 
application issues a persistence request for a transient object, Hibernate assigns an 
identifier value to the object and stores it in the database. The object is then moved to 
the persistent state until the session is closed, and to the detached state thereafter.
Persistent objects
Transient objects are moved to Persistent when they are stored in the database. 
Persistent refers to objects that have already been persisted. They have a database 
representation with appropriate primary-key values and are associated with valid 
Session objects. Until the associated sessions are closed by invoking the close() 
method, Hibernate caches these objects, tracks the changes, and keeps the database 
representation up-to-date as transactions are committed. Moving to the detached 
state is transparent, meaning no method is called for transition. Invoking the close() 
method of the associated session moves the persistent object to the detached state.
Detached objects
Detached objects, like persistent objects, have already been persisted, but their 
associated sessions have been closed. Hibernate does not care about them. It neither 
caches them nor detects their modifications to keep the database representation 
up-to-date. When reattached to a valid session object, these objects are moved to 
the persistent state.

Chapter 8
[ 169 ]
Removed objects
Removed refers to persistent objects that are arranged by the Session object to be 
removed from the database. The removed objects are removed from the database 
and moved to the transient state as soon as the session's associated transaction 
commits. This may be done either explicitly, through invoking a delete operation for 
those objects, or implicitly, through invoking a delete operation for associated objects 
when the persistent objects have been mapped with cascading delete. Removed 
objects are erased from the database as soon as the session's associated transaction 
is complete, or during the explicit/implicit flushing of the session. They are then 
moved to the transient state.
Persistence with Hibernate
Hibernate's persistence service is exposed through different interfaces, including 
Session, Query, Criteria, and Transaction. Among these, the Session interface 
has a crucial role, since any Hibernate interaction involves at least a Session object.
Session objects perform basic persistence operations. These include storing a 
newly instantiated object and loading, updating, and deleting an already persisted 
object. Session objects provide a transaction handler to perform a set of persistence 
operations as a unit of work. Additionally, a Session object provides a simple cache 
for the objects loaded, stored, or updated through it.
The Session API is generally used for the following purposes:
Performing basic CRUD operations: Performing the basic CRUD operations, 
such as save, load, update, and delete. These operations, which are exposed 
as the save(), persist(), get(), load(), update(), and saveOrUpdate() 
methods on the Session object, are the subject of this chapter.
Managing transactions: Demarcating transactions through the 
beginTransaction(), commit(), and rollback() methods. These 
transactions are discussed in Chapter 12.
Working with filters: Applying, enabling, and disabling filters on the 
data returned by executing queries. This is done by the createFilter(), 
enableFilter(), and disableFilter() methods, which are explained in 
the Appendix.
Creating queries: Creating queries expressed in the Criteria API, or in HQL, 
through the createQuery(), createSQLQuery(), createNamedQuery(), and 
createCriteria() methods. Chapter 9 discusses these methods.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 170 ]
Working with Hibernate resources (Connection, SessionFactory, 
Transaction): Accessing the resources that the session uses behind 
the scenes, including database Connection and Transaction, and the 
SessionFactory object to which the session belongs. This is done through 
the connection(), isOpen(), isConnected(), close(), disconnect(), 
reconnect(), getTransaction(), and getSessionFactory() methods, 
which are discussed in this chapter.
This chapter discusses the basic CRUD operations provided by the Session API. 
Other operations, such as querying objects, with other Hibernate interfaces, such 
as Transaction, Query, and Criteria, are covered in subsequent chapters.
The process of persistence
Any Hibernate interaction involves a resource factory, org.hibernate.
SessionFactory, which is used to create a single-threaded resource, org.
hibernate.Session, for each sequence of operations. The Session and 
SessionFactory objects are roughly analogous to javax.sql.DataSource 
and java.sql.Connection objects, respectively, in the case of JDBC.
The Hibernate interaction is started by configuring a SessionFactory object. 
This object wraps all connection information, and acts as a factory for Session. 
Since SessionFactory is a costly object, the application should use only one 
instance of SessionFactory for each database it uses. The application then obtains 
Session instances from the SessionFactory to perform operations. Regarding 
this, I introduced the HibernateHelper class in Chapter 4, which configures 
SessionFactory and provides Session instances. Using this class, any 
Hibernate interaction can be summarized as follows:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
//perform persistence operation(s)
tx.commit();
session.close();
In the first line, a Session object is obtained. This object may be obtained through 
dealing with SessionFactory directly, or by using a utility class such as the 
HibernateHelper class. Additionally, as you will see in later chapters, Spring 
may be configured and set up to create a SessionFactory and provide Session.
•

Chapter 8
[ 171 ]
The next line starts a Hibernate transaction. Each transaction is applied to a sequence 
of operations, which should be treated as an atomic operation. This means that 
the operations included in the transaction must all be performed successfully, or 
otherwise, all will fail. Since database operations are critical processes inside the 
application, they must be performed inside a transaction. When you are working 
with Hibernate, you may use the Hibernate API, or Spring, to demarcate transaction 
boundaries and manage transaction performance. As you will see, using Spring's 
declarative approach is highly recommended. For now, we will use the Hibernate 
API to demarcate transactions using the beginTransaction() and commit() 
methods of Session.
You are not obliged to manage transactions if your application does 
not have this requirement. In that case, you can set the auto-commit 
property of Hibernate to true, or always invoke the flush() method 
of Session to synchronize the database only for writing operations 
such as save, update, and delete. The flush() method flushes the 
session, and consequently commits all of the object modifications 
managed by the session.
Don't worry about transaction management with Hibernate here as 
Chapter 9 discusses it fully.
When the transaction starts, you are ready to perform your desired persistent 
operations. This is shown with the commented line in the preceding code.
The next line shows how the transaction is committed through the Transaction 
instance's commit() method. This flushes the session and synchronizes the database 
representation with the application's objects.
After everything is finished, the session instance may be closed by invoking its 
close() method. This closes the underlying database connection with which 
the session is associated, and releases other resources, such as the cache. Note 
that you cannot use the session instance after it has been closed. If you try, a 
HibernateException is thrown. Use the isOpen() of Session method to 
check whether the session is open or not.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 172 ]
To use Hibernate with JPA, similar objects to the native Hibernate API are 
involved. javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory, javax.persistence.
EntityManager, and javax.persistence.EntityTransaction are respectively 
similar to SessionFactory, Session, and Transaction, which were recently 
discussed. Therefore, to interact with Hibernate through JPA, we will use code 
similar to the following:
EntityManagerFactory emf =
          Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("instituteWebApp");
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
tx.begin();
//perform persistence operation(s)
tx.commit();
em.close();
Similar to SessionFactory, only one single EntityManagerFactory object is 
needed for each database used throughout the application. The first line of the code 
above does this. The next lines of the code should be done for each interaction with 
Hibernate. The unit of work is marked with begin(), commit(), and rollback() 
methods of the EntityTransaction object.
Using this style of code to manage transactions is only applicable for local 
transaction. As you will see in the next chapters, local transactions are a kind of 
transactions which are involved with only a single datasource. It is also possible 
to manage multiple-datasource transactions, but of course in a managed JEE 
environment. Discussing this type of transaction management is out of this 
book's scope.
Storing objects
When a persistent object is instantiated in memory, it is in the transient state. So 
until the application saves the object by explicitly invoking the save() method of a 
valid Hibernate session, the object is not persisted. A Session object is called valid, 
if it has not been closed by calling its close() method. The saving process can be as 
simple as follows:
Student std = … //std is a transient object
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(std);
tx.commit();
session.close();

Chapter 8
[ 173 ]
The save() method associates the transient object with the current session and 
moves it to persistent state, so that the session tracks the object changes. The object 
is inserted into the database when the transaction is committed, or when the session 
is flushed. The object remains persistent while the session is open. As soon as the 
session is closed, the persistent object is moved to the detached state. After that 
point, the session does not track the object changes.
When you save an object, Hibernate uses an INSERT INTO SQL statement 
to synchronize that object with the database. If the persistent object 
changes after a save() or flush() method is invoked (and, of course, 
before the transaction is committed or the session is closed), Hibernate 
uses additional SQL UPDATE statement(s), besides the already prepared 
INSERT INTO statement, to synchronize the session with the database. 
Regarding performance optimization, call the save() or flush() 
method whenever the object is ready to be stored and no additional 
changes are applicable.
The Session API provides a variety set of save() methods for this purpose:
public Serializable save(Object obj) throws HibernateException
public void save(Object obj, Serializable id) throws 
HibernateException
public Serializable save(String className,Object obj) throws
HibernateException
obj is the transient object we want to save. This object cannot be null. In the first 
save() method, Hibernate uses the reflection API to find the object's class, and then 
uses its already defined mapping to make the object persist. The obj is saved, and 
its assigned identifier value is returned as a Serializable object. The application 
can use the returned identifier value to look up the Session object for accessing the 
persistent object.
The second save() method takes an Object and a Serializable instance as 
arguments, representing the object being stored and the identifier value to be 
assigned to the object. This method is useful when the application, rather than 
Hibernate, generates identifier values.
The third save() method takes a String and an Object instance, which represent 
the classname and the object being stored, respectively. Hibernate uses the classname 
to find the object mapping. This method also returns the assigned identifier value as 
a Serializable instance.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 174 ]
If you don't know whether the object's state is transient or detached, you can use the 
following method as an alternative to save():
public void saveOrUpdate(Object obj) throws HibernateException
When you use this method, Hibernate checks the object identifier to determine 
whether the object is transient, and therefore does not need to be saved or updated. 
Note that an object is in the transient state when its identifier has the unsaved 
value, defined in the mapping file through the unsaved-value attribute, similar 
to the following:
<id name="id" type="long" column="id" unsaved-value="0">
    <generator class="increment"/>
</id>
See Chapter 5 for more information about the unsaved-value attribute.
With JPA, you can use the EntityManager's persist() method to make a 
transient object persistent. Therefore, we have the code like the following to 
save a transient object:
Student std = … //std is a transient object
EntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();
EntityTransaction tx = em.getTransaction();
tx.begin();
em.persist(std);
tx.commit();
em.close();
Unlike Session's save(), the EntityManager's persist() method here does not 
return the object identifier.
Object equality and identity
When an object stored in the database is detached, its corresponding table row is 
updated. If the object is transient, a new row is inserted. Now, if you load this object 
by the same session that was recently used, Hibernate provides the same reference 
to the object. As the result, you can use the == operator to compare persistent 
objects that are managed in the same session. However, if the persistent objects 
are associated with different sessions, the == operator will not work correctly. To 
compare persistent objects, you can implement the equals() method in persistent 
classes. You can find an example of the equals() implementation in Chapter 5.

Chapter 8
[ 175 ]
Loading objects
Hibernate provides several load() and get() methods through Session, for 
loading persistent objects. The required data for loading any persistent object is 
the identifier, which must be Serializable. Here is an example:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Student std = (Student) session.load(Student.class, 1);
tx.commit();
session.close();
This example retrieves a Student object with identifier 1. Note that in this code, 
we have started and committed the transaction. This is not necessary for retrieving 
a persistent object. However, it is recommended because it allows us to insert or 
remove any other persistence operation before or after loading the object.
We can also use the get() method as an alternative to the load() method:
Student std = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);
However, the get() and load() methods work in different ways. If no object 
with the given identifier exists in the database, get() returns null, but the load() 
method throws ObjectNotFoundException. Moreover, the get() method always 
hits the database and fetches a fresh object, whereas load() returns an initialized 
object if the object has already been fetched and is cached by the current session, 
otherwise a proxy is returned. A proxy is an object that simulates the real instance 
without having real values. However, the real values may be loaded from the 
database if they are accessed while the associated session is open.
Although you can use the load() and get() methods interchangeably, each may 
be better suited to a particular case. Use the get() method when you need a fresh 
copy of an existing persistent object. You may then work with the returned object 
in the normal way. The load() method is useful when you merely need a reference 
to the object. For example, to remove the object, change its values, or establish an 
association with another object. In all of these cases, hitting the database is 
not required.
Here are the most common versions of the load() and get() methods:
public Object load(Class clazz, Serializable id) throws 
HibernateException
public Object load(String className, Serializable id) throws
HibernateException
public void load(Object obj, Serializable id) throws 
HibernateException

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 176 ]
public Object get(Class clazz, Serializable id) throws 
HibernateException
public Object get(String className, Serializable id) throws
HibernateException
In all of these methods, the Serializable object represents the identifier value of 
the object being loaded. If the object identifier is of a primitive type, and you are 
using JDK 1.4 or before, the identifier value should be wrapped in the corresponding 
wrapping object. This is not required in JDK 1.5 or later, which use autoboxing. Both 
get() and load() methods may use either a Class instance or a String instance as 
an argument. This argument represents the class of the persistent object that is being 
loaded from the database.
The Object returned by the get() and load() methods represents the persistent 
object being loaded in the application, either as a proxy or a real value. The only 
method that returns void takes the persistent object with the object identifier as 
arguments. The persistent object has two usages:
It helps Hibernate find the persistent class of the object.
Hibernate stores the loaded values in the persistent object.
Certainly, this object cannot be null.
The following snippet uses the load() method to load a Student instance 
with identifier 2:
Session session= HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Student std1 = session.load(Student.class, 2);
Student std2 = session.load("com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.
Student", 2);
Student std3 = new Student();
session.load(std3, 2);
tx.commit();
//use the objects
session.close();
Since all of the std1, std2, and std3 objects use the same session, they have the same 
reference, and comparing them with the == operator results in true.

Chapter 8
[ 177 ]
In addition to this version of load() and get() methods, Hibernate also provides 
these others:
public Object load(Class clazz, Serializable id, LockMode lockMode) 
throws HibernateException
public Object load(String className, Serializable id, LockMode 
lockMode) throws HibernateException
public Object get(Class clazz, Serializable id, LockMode lockMode) 
throws HibernateException
public Object get(String className, Serializable id, LockMode 
lockMode) throws HibernateException
All of these methods use an object of type org.hibernate.LockMode as their last 
argument. The LockMode object determines which locking strategy Hibernate should 
use for fetching the object. The LockMode class, and the locking strategies that 
Hibernate uses, are discussed in Chapter 12.
JPA provides the find() and getReference() methods through the EntityManager 
interface to retrieve the persistent objects:
<T> T find(Class<T> clazz, Object o);
<T> T getReference(Class<T> tClass, Object o);
Both methods receive the class and the identifier of the target object being loaded 
and return the loaded object. Note that the two methods use Java generics, meaning 
no type casting to the expected persistent class is needed. Here is an example:
Student std = entityManager.find(Student.class, 1);
The find() and getReference() methods are respectively equivalent to Session's 
get() and load() methods. While the find() method returns null if there is no 
persistent object with the given identifier in the database, the load() method throws 
EntityNotFoundException. The find() method always hits the database and 
returns the fully initialized persistent object, if any exist. However, getReference() 
returns a proxy object that is initialized when a non-identifier field is accessed.
Refreshing objects
Sometimes, the persistent objects in memory need to be refreshed. Refreshing means 
reloading the in-memory object from the database to ensure that the in-memory 
instance represents the same value persisted in the database.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 178 ]
An advantage of Hibernate is that you usually do not need to worry about 
refreshing. Hibernate always manages the in-memory persistent objects if they are 
associated with valid Session. However, in some situations, including the following, 
persistent in-memory objects need to be refreshed:
When the database is shared between your application and another 
application (or applications).
When your application uses the database both directly and 
through Hibernate.
When the persistent class uses a property that is set by the database triggers, 
so persistent objects need to be reloaded to maintain the correct value.
Hibernate provides the refresh() method exposed by the Session interface to 
refresh persistent objects. This method is provided in two versions:
public void refresh(Object obj) throws HibernateException
public void refresh(Object obj, LockMode lockMode) throws 
HibernateException
For example, suppose the educational system application's Student class uses a 
property of type Date, which represents the time that the student registered. We 
use an extra column in the STUDENT table to hold that information. When Student 
objects are created in the application, we do not want the application to assign the 
registration time, because the registration process may take a long time, and the 
application does not know exactly when it should assign a registration time to the 
student. As the result, we need to use a database trigger to set the time when the 
Student instance is inserted into the database. The following snippet shows how 
the Student instance is reloaded from the database when it is stored:
Student std = new Student();
//set values...
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(std);
session.flush(); // Force the INSERT to occur in the database
session.refresh(std); // Reload the Student object in memory
tx.commit();
session.close();
System.out.println(std.getRegisterTime());
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 179 ]
In the example, Hibernate never inserts or updates the registerTime 
property. Therefore, its mapping should use insert="false" and 
update="false" to specify that this property is not included in the 
SQL INSERT/UPDATE statements when a Student instance is inserted 
or updated.
JPA provide the refresh() method through the EntityManager interface to refresh 
an in-memory object with its data representation in the database. This method's 
signature is as follows:
void refresh(Object obj);
The only parameter for this method is the object to refresh.
Updating objects
As with refreshing, you do not need to worry about updating persistent objects 
while the Session object is open. Hibernate automatically manages all of the objects 
modifications by putting them in a queue and stores the modifications when the 
transaction is committed. This means that you do not need to call any Hibernate 
API regarding the update, as the following snippet shows:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Student std = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);
std.setLastName("Johnston");
tx.commit(); //update the Student instance
session.close();
As soon as the session is closed, the object becomes detached, meaning Hibernate 
does not track changes, and any modification to the object has no effect on the 
persistent representation of the object in the database.
The Session interface provides the update() method for updating detached objects. 
The update() method both reattaches the detached object to a valid session and 
flushes the changes. Here is an example:
Student std = … // Loaded in the previous Session
Session newSession = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = newSession.beginTransaction();
newSession.update(std);
std.setLastName("Johnston");
tx.commit(); //update the database with the new value
newSession.close();

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 180 ]
This example reattaches the std object to a new session by invoking the update() 
method of Session. The object is synchronized with the database by issuing an SQL 
UPDATE statement when the transaction is committed. Note that in this example, 
we have changed the lastName value after invoking the update() method. The 
update() method reattaches the Student object to a new Session. Therefore, the 
object is moved to the persistent state. After all, when the transaction is committed, 
the session is synchronized with the database, and database representation 
is updated.
Note that Hibernate updates all of the object's properties, whether they have 
been modified or not. This is because the session does not use any mechanism for 
identifying modified properties, meaning which properties have changed and 
which have not. Instead, it assumes that all have changed. You may avoid this 
issue by using the select-before-update="true" attribute in the object's 
mapping definition, which forces Hibernate to select the object from the 
database before updating to find the modified properties.
Whether the object is modified before or after invoking the update() 
method, the session is synchronized with the database representation 
when the session is flushed.
Alternatively, you can use the lock() method to associate a detached object with a 
Session object. However, the lock() method does not force Hibernate to update all 
changes before reattaching. This means the Session only tracks those changes to 
the object that have been performed after invoking the lock() method. Here is 
an example:
Student std = … // Loaded in previous Session
Session newSession = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = newSession.beginTransaction();
std.setFirstName("Thomas"); //will be not be updated
newSession.lock(std, LockMode.NONE);
std.setLastName("Johnston");
tx.commit();
newSession.close();
The lock() method takes an org.hibernate.LockMode instance as the second 
argument. The LockMode instance tells Hibernate whether Hibernate should obtain 
a database lock, or perform a version check, to verify that the object in memory and 
data in the database are the same. For example, LockMode.NONE in the preceding 
example tells Hibernate there is no need to obtain any database locks or to perform 
a version check. This and other lock modes are discussed in Chapter 10.

Chapter 8
[ 181 ]
JPA does not provide a specific method for updating. If the object being updated is 
still associated with a valid EntityManager, the object that changes is monitored 
by the EntityManager and it will be updated as soon as the transaction is 
committed. If the object is a detached object, you will need to reattach it with 
a valid EntityManager, through the merge() method, so the object will be 
monitored by the EntityManager. The merge() method will be discussed in 
the sequent sections.
Checking for dirty Sessions
To work more effectively with updating objects, the Session API provides other 
methods to check whether the session is dirty and needs to be flushed. The session 
is called dirty if it includes a modified object that needs to be synchronized with 
the database.
The isDirty()method determines whether session-managed objects have changed, 
and the database representation needs to be updated. Hibernate also offers a flush 
mode, by which you can indicate when Hibernate should flush the session. This 
is represented by an object of type org.hibernate.FlushMode, accessed by the 
following setter and getter methods through the Session object:
public void setFlushMode(FlushMode flushMode)
public FlushMode getFlushMode()
The FlushMode class is a type-safe enumeration with the following values:
ALWAYS: After any query has been executed, the session is flushed.
AUTO: After a query has been successfully executed, the session is flushed.
COMMIT: The session is flushed when a transaction is committed.
NEVER: The application manages session flushing by manually invoking the 
flush() method.
AUTO is the default flush mode. In most situations, you do not need to change it, 
because letting Hibernate handle this automatically usually works best.
JPA provides two values, COMMIT and AUTO through the javax.persistence.
FlushModeType enumeration. The default flush type is AUTO, meaning the database 
representation is synchronized with the object when the EntityTransaction 
is committed, before a query is executed, or when the EntityManager's flush() 
is invoked. Making it COMMIT just flushes the EntityManager when 
the TransactionManager is committed, or when flush() is invoked.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 182 ]
Using the merge() method
The merge()method merges two objects which have different references in memory, 
but represent the same row in the database. If you were to use the update() method 
to associate a detached object with a Session object that already manages another 
instance representing the same row in the database, a NonUniqueObjectException 
is thrown. This indicates that two instances with the same identifier value will be 
managed with the Session object. The following snippet shows how the merge() 
method can be used in such cases:
Student std1 = …//a detached object
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Student std2 = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);
//session.update(std1) Not allowed!, throws exception!
Std2 = session.merge(std1);
tx.commit();
session.close();
With the merge() method, if the session already manages the persistent instance, 
the state of the detached instance is copied onto the persistent instance. Otherwise, 
Hibernate tries to load the persistent instance from the database to merge it with the 
detached instance. If no corresponding object is found, a new object is instantiated to 
be merged with the object and inserted into the database.
Multiple invocation of the merge() method with arguments of different 
in-memory instances of the same database row always returns the same 
object reference.
The EntityManager interface provided by JPA provides a similar merge() method 
with the same meaning, signature, and usage.
Deleting objects
The session's delete() method removes a persistent object from the database. Its 
syntax is as follows:
public void delete(Object obj) throws HibernateException

Chapter 8
[ 183 ]
obj is the persistent object that is removed. This object's identifier is all that Hibernate 
uses, so this object can be a dirty object not synchronized with the database. However, 
there should be a corresponding object with its identifier in the database.
Here is an example:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Student std = (Student) session.load(Student.class, new Long(1));
session.delete(std);
tx.commit();
session.close();
The delete() method moves a persistent object from the persistent to the removed 
state. The object is moved to the transient state as soon as the associated transaction 
is committed.
If your application uses Hibernate interceptors, and the object must be 
passed through these interceptors to complete its life cycle, the object 
must first be loaded as either a proxy or a real object. Refer to the 
Appendix for information about interceptors.
This method will throw a HibernateException, if the object identifier doesn't have 
the value, or no objects in the database correspond to the object identifier value.
In some situations, you may want some operations to be performed when a 
persistent object is removed, meaning that you may want some tasks to be done 
when the delete() method is successfully invoked. The best way to implement this 
mechanism is by using Spring: implementing an advice and then applying it to the 
delete() method. This method is discussed in Chapter 11. In addition, Hibernate 
allows the implementation of an event/listener model, or an interceptor, to handle 
these cases. I have explained these techniques in the Appendix.
In addition to the delete() method provided through the Session interface, you 
may use HQL to remove persistent objects. However, HQL is usually used for 
removing objects when you need to deal with a collection of particular objects, 
rather than a single object. The following snippet shows an example of using 
HQL to remove a Student object with identifier value 1:
String hql = "delete from Student where id = :studentId";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setInt("studentId", 1);
query.executeUpdate();

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 184 ]
Using HQL is often preferred because it does not need to reload the objects. Note 
that the delete() method takes the persistent object as an argument. When using 
this method, you must have already loaded the object. As a result, HQL uses less 
memory, is executed faster, and reduces the network traffic communicating with 
the database.
In addition to using the delete() method and HQL, sometimes an update operation 
may cause Hibernate to remove another object or objects. This happens when there 
is a one-to-many relationship between an object and its associated objects, and their 
relationship is mapped with the delete-orphan cascading operation. Removing 
any associated object from its parent, means the object is removed from the database 
when the parent is updated. In other words, if you remove one or more associated 
objects from the parent, when the parent is saved, the removed objects are erased 
from the database. HQL is discussed in Chapter 9.
JPA provides the remove() method through the EntityManager interface. This 
method is used in the same way as Session's delete() method to remove a 
persistent object from the database. To remove an object, that object must be 
associated with the EntityManager, meaning you must find the persistent object 
through its identifier, through EntityManager's getReference(), and then remove 
the object.
Replicating objects
Hibernate provides a replication feature that may be useful when the application 
works with two or more databases. This feature allows objects to be retrieved from 
one database and then stored in another one. You may need replication when you 
need to synchronize databases with different data, when you need to roll back all 
changes after a particular time or all changes made under particular circumstances 
(for example, during non-ACID transactions), or when you are switching to a new 
database instance and need to move the previous data to the new schema. 
The replicate() method of session is used for this purpose. This method is 
exposed through the Session interface with the following signatures:
public void replicate(Object persistentObject, ReplicationMode 
replicationMode) throws HibernateException;
public void replicate(String className, Object persistentObject, 
           ReplicationMode replicationMode) throws HibernateException;

Chapter 8
[ 185 ]
These methods write a persistent object to the target database with which the session 
is associated. These methods take a persistentObject as an argument, which 
represents the object being replicated. These methods also take an org.hibernate.
ReplicationMode object as an argument, which defines Hibernate's behavior when 
the object already exists in the target database. (Note that we say an object already 
exists in the target database if there is an existing database row with the same 
identifier as the object identifier in the target database.)
The ReplicationMode class is a type-self enumeration with the following values:
ReplicationMode.EXCEPTION: Hibernate throws an exception, if the object 
already exists in the target database.
ReplicationMode.IGNORE: Hibernate ignores replication, if the same object 
is in the target database. 
ReplicationMode.OVERWRITE: Hibernate overwrites the object, if it already 
exists in the target database.
ReplicationMode.LATEST_VERSION: If the source object does not exist in 
the target database, Hibernate copies the object. If the object already exists in 
the target database, Hibernate overwrites the object if and only if the source's 
version is newer than the target's version.
To replicate objects, we first need two Session objects opened from different 
SessionFactorys, in which each SessionFactory works with one distinct database, 
but has been configured with a mapping for the same persistent class. We can 
then retrieve objects from one session and store them in another session. Here is 
an example:
//opening two distinct session objects, referring to two different 
databases
Session session1 = HibernateHelper.getSession1();
Session session2 = HibernateHelper.getSession2();
//retrieving the object from the source database
Transaction tx1 = session1.beginTransaction();
Student std = (Student) session1.get(Student.class, new Long(1));
tx1.commit();
session1.close();
//storing the object to the target database
Transaction tx2 = session2.beginTransaction();
session2.replicate(std, ReplicationMode.OVERWRITE);
tx2.commit();
session2.close();

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 186 ]
Note that in this example, the HibernateHelper class is different from 
the HibernateHelper class in Chapter 4, which only works with a single 
database. Of course, to use the HibernateHelper class in this case, you should 
refactor that class so that it can provide Session objects associated with two 
different SessionFactory. The following code snippet shows the refactored 
HibernateHelper class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;
public class HibernateHelper {
  private static final ThreadLocal session1 = new ThreadLocal();
  private static final ThreadLocal session2 = new ThreadLocal();
  private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory1 =
         new Configuration().configure("/hibernate1.cfg.xml").
buildSessionFactory();
  private static final SessionFactory sessionFactory2 =
         new Configuration().configure("/hibernate2.cfg.xml").
buildSessionFactory();
  //inaccessible constructor
  private HibernateHelper() {
  }
  public static Session getSession1() {
    Session session = (Session) HibernateHelper.session1.get();
    if (session == null) {
      session = sessionFactory1.openSession();
      HibernateHelper.session1.set(session);
    }
    return session;
  }
  public static Session getSession2() {
    Session session = (Session) HibernateHelper.session2.get();
    if (session == null) {
      session = sessionFactory2.openSession();
      HibernateHelper.session2.set(session);
    }
    return session;
  }
}

Chapter 8
[ 187 ]
Cascading operations
A cascading operation indicates how changes to the persistent object affect 
associated objects when an object is persisted. For instance, if the removed object is 
associated with other objects, what should happen to the others when the removed 
object is erased from the database? 
I'll explain with an example. Consider the Teacher class in the educational system 
application. Suppose that each teacher is associated with a single course, meaning 
the Teacher class has a property of type Course. If we use the TEACHER and COURSE 
tables, respectively, to store the Teacher and Course objects in the database, then 
corresponding to each Teacher object is a single Course object, and corresponding 
to each row in the TEACHER table is a single row in the COURSE table. In this situation, 
when a Teacher object is removed, what do you expect to happen to its related 
Course object?
The application's requirements may force you to either delete the associated 
object or to ignore it. In Hibernate, the result of this decision is expressed through 
a configuration option in the mapping definition called cascade. This property 
specifies how changing an object affects its associated objects. In our example, the 
cascade attribute in the mapping file can specify whether or not the Course object 
should be removed when its associated Teacher object is deleted.
Hibernate offers several different values for cascading, including the following:
none: This is the default value and specifies that Hibernate must ignore the 
associated object(s) when it saves, updates, or removes the persistent object.
save-update: This specifies that Hibernate must save or update the 
associated object(s) only when it saves or updates a persistent object.
delete: This determines that Hibernate must delete the associated object(s) 
when it removes the persistent object.
all: This indicates that Hibernate must save, update, or remove the 
associated object(s) when it respectively saves, updates, or removes the 
persistent object.
delete-orphan: This is used in mapping the one-to-many relationship to 
tell Hibernate if a many-side object is removed from its associated one-side 
object, Hibernate must remove the many-side object from the database when 
the one-side is updated.
You can specify cascading operations in the mapping file, where the mapping of 
object associations is defined, through the cascade attribute. Note that the cascade 
attribute can have more than one value. If it does, the values are presented as a 
comma-separated list.
•

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 188 ]
JPA defines different cascading values through the javax.persistence.
CascadeType enumeration. These values, with their meanings, are as follows:
PERSIST: Hibernate persists all associated transient instances of an object 
being passed to the EntityManager's persist() when the EntityManager 
is flushed.
MERGE: Hibernate merges all associated detached instances of an object being 
passed to the EntityManager's merge() method with their corresponding 
persistent values in the database.
REMOVE: Hibernate deletes the associated instances when the object is 
removed by the EntityManager's remove() method.
REFRESH: Hibernate refreshes the associated objects for an object being 
refreshed by the EntityManager's refresh().
ALL: This option allows all of the above cascading operations to be 
used together.
The cascading operation can be defined through the cascade attribute for all object 
associations. Here is an example:
public class Student {
  @ManyToOne(cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST)
  @JoinColumn(name = "SCHOOL_ID")
  private School school;
}
You can also use a comma-separated list of cascading operations, if more than one is 
required. For example you can use:
  @ManyToOne(cascade = {CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE})
That means both merge and persist cascading should be applied on the Student to 
School relationship.
An example cascading operation
Here, I'll explain different cascading values by referring to our example of an 
educational system application. Consider the Student class as shown below:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08;
import java.util.List;
public class Student {
  private int id;
  private String firstName;
•
•
•
•
•

Chapter 8
[ 189 ]
  private String lastName;
  private Address address;
  private List courses; 
  //default constructor
  public Student(){
  }
  public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName= lastName ;
  }
  //setter and getter methods
  //equals() and hashCode()
}
This class is associated with another persistent class, Address. The Student class 
also holds a courses property of type java.util.List, representing all courses 
that a student has passed. Each course is represented by another persistent class 
called Course.
The following code shows the Address:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08;
public class Address {
  private int id;
  private String street;
  private String city; 
  private String zipCode;
  //default constructor
  public Address() {
  }
  public Address(String street, String city, String zipCode) {
    this.street = street;
    this.city = city;
    this.zipCode = zipCode;
  }
  //setter and getter methods
}

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 190 ]
And this is the Course class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08;
public class Course {
  private int id;
  private String name;
  private int unit;
  //default constructor
  public Course(){
  }
  public Course(String name, int unit) {
    this.name = name;
    this.unit = unit;
  }
  //setter and getter methods
}
The following code shows the mapping definition for the Address class:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">

And this is the Student's mapping definition:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>

      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.hibernate.Course"/>
    </bag>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
Note that, the ADDRESS_ID and STUDENT_ID are extra columns in the STUDENT and 
COURSE tables, respectively. They are the foreign keys to the STUDENT table's primary 
key, and refer to the associated Student object.
The Course and Address mapping files do not have considerable information, since 
they consist merely of plain properties. The only thing we are interested in here is 
the cascade attribute in the mapping definition of Student, which currently has a 
save-update value.

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 192 ]
When a Student object is persisted in the STUDENT table, its associated address is 
persisted in another table called ADDRESS. The many-to-one relation in the mapping 
file expresses that every Student object is associated with an Address object. For 
each Student object persisted in the STUDENT table, there should be at least one 
corresponding address object in the ADDRESS table.
The <bag> element specifies that the Student object is associated with a collection of 
the courses the student has passed.
Note that the corresponding mapping file for
private List courses;
has been represented with the <bag> element as follows:
<bag name="courses" inverse="true" cascade="save-update">
    <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
    <one-to-many class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.Course"/>
</bag>
The cascade attribute states how changing a Student object affects its associated 
courses and address. In other words, if a Student object is saved, updated, or 
removed, this attribute states whether the object's associated address and courses 
should be saved, updated, or removed, as well. Let's see what each value for the 
cascade attribute means.
Using cascade="save-update"
In the previous section, relations of the Student with the Course and Address 
objects were mapped by using the save-update cascading operation. We expect 
that when a Student object is saved or updated, its associated objects, address, and 
courses are saved or updated, as well. However, when a student object is removed, 
we do not expect its associated objects to be erased from the database, since the 
cascading operation does not state delete cascading with the value delete. Look 
at the following snippet:
Student std = new Student("Arash", "Hoseini");
Address addr = new Address("Pastor", "Tehran", "1415833243");
Course course1 = new Course("Core Java", 2);
Course course2 = new Course("J2EE Programming", 3);
List courses = new ArrayList();
courses.add(course1);
courses.add(course2);
std.setAddress(addr);
std.setCourses(courses);
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();

Chapter 8
[ 193 ]
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(std);
tx.commit();
session.close();
After this, we expect that when std is saved, course1, course2, and phone are all 
saved, as well.
Using cascade="none"
If we use cascade="none" for each relationship in the mapping, no persistent 
operation on a Student object may be propagated to its associated objects mapped 
with that relationship. In other words, saving, updating, or removing a Student 
object does not lead to saving, updating, or deleting its associated object(s) that 
are mapped with cascade="none".
Note that none is the default value of the cascade attribute.
Using cascade="delete"
cascade="delete" determines that, when a Student object is removed, all of its 
associated objects are erased from the database. However, saving or updating the 
Student object does not affect the associated objects in the database, even if they 
have changed.
Using cascade="delete-orphan"
Another cascade value is delete-orphan, used for objects that have a one-to-many 
relationship with others. This cascade specifies that, if one or more associated objects 
are removed from the parent, the removed object(s) are removed from the database 
when the parent is updated.
For example, suppose that the Teacher class has a property called courses. This 
property represents the list of courses that a teacher teaches. When a Course object 
is removed from the courses property, we want the course to be removed from the 
database when the Teacher object is updated. To do this, we can define the Teacher 
and Course relationship as follows:
<bag name="courses" inverse="true" cascade="all,delete-orphan">
  <key column="TEACHER_ID" />
  <one-to-many  class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.Course" />
</bag>

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 194 ]
The default-cascade attribute of the <hibernate-mapping> 
element can be used to specify a general cascading operation for all of 
the object relationships defined inside the <hibernate-mapping> 
element. Note that each object relationship can use its own cascade 
attribute to overwrite the default value specified generally by the 
default-cascade attribute.
Lazy loading
Loading persistent objects from the database is an expensive operation, particularly 
when the objects are associated with many other objects. To enhance loading 
performance, Hibernate provides a great feature called lazy loading, which we saw 
briefly in Chapter 3. Let's look at it again, now that we know more about Hibernate's 
persistence functionality. Using lazy loading, Hibernate provides proxy objects, 
instead of actual persistent objects, whenever they are queried. The proxy objects 
act like the real object, but without the real values. This prevents Hibernate from 
unnecessary hitting the database, which would reduce the application's performance. 
The real values of the properties, object associations, and collections are loaded from 
the database when their accessors explicitly access them.
In the Loading Objects section of this chapter, you learned how to load persistent 
objects as proxies. Hibernate provides get() and load() methods to retrieve objects. 
get() always hits the database and fully initializes the retrieved object, but load() 
just initializes a proxy object which acts as the real object without real values. When 
each non-identifier property is accessed for an object that is retrieved through 
load(), the database is queried for that property. To provide this functionality, 
Hibernate creates a subclass of the persistent class at runtime, and overrides the 
accessor methods, so that when the accessor methods are called, the real values 
are fetched from the database.
Since proxy objects are instances of Hibernate runtime-generated 
classes, you can not use the loaded instance's getClass() method 
to find the persistent object's class. Instead, you can pass the object to 
the getClassWithoutInitializingProxy() method of the 
org.hibernate.proxy.HibernateProxyHelper class to get 
the actual persistent class.

Chapter 8
[ 195 ]
Proxy generation for a particular persistent class can be disabled with lazy="false", 
in the following mapping definition:
<class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.Student" 
       table="STUDENT"
       lazy="false">
</class>
In this situation, the load() and get() methods for loading the Student instances 
work in the same way.
It is also possible to change the default lazy initialization for a particular associated 
object or collection. By default, Hibernate loads the associated objects and collections 
as a proxy, even if you are loading the persistent object through the get() method of 
Session. To disable lazy initialization, you need to use lazy="false" for mapping 
elements inside the mapping definitions. Here is an example:
<class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.Student" 
table="STUDENT">
    <bag name="courses"  cascade="all" table="STUDNET_COURSE" 
         lazy="false">
      <key column="STUDENT_ID"/>
      <many-to-many 
                   class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch08.Course"
                   column="COURSE_ID"/>
    </bag>
</class>
JPA provides find() and getReference() methods through the EntityManager 
interface, which are somewhat equivalent to Session's get() and load() methods, 
but not exactly the same! While find() always hits the database, getReference() 
always uses a proxy with just initialized identifier. The difference in JPA and 
Hibernate native API is in loading associated objects and collections. While in 
Hibernate, get() always hits the database and load() always loads the object lazily. 
In JPA, find() loads the ManyToOne and OneToOne associations not lazily, but by 
default. The getReference() method always retrieves the associated objects and 
collections lazily.
JPA allows the default behavior of association loading to be changed through the 
mapping metadata. This is done by using the javax.persistence.FetchType 
enumeration with two values: LAZY and EAGER with the same meaning as 
lazy="true" and lazy="false", respectively. Here is an example:
public class Student {
  @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
  @JoinColumn(name = "SCHOOL_ID")
  private School school;
}

Hibernate Persistence Behavior
[ 196 ]
This means the associate School object for each Student must be loaded lazily.
Some useful Session methods
At the beginning of this chapter, we introduced different methods exposed through 
the Session interface. Some of these methods have been discussed in this chapter, 
while others are fully explained in other chapters. However, there are some useful 
methods that fit into this chapter's scope. These methods may be used any time when 
working with a Session object or objects managed by the Session instance. The 
following table summarizes the Session's methods:
Method
Description
void persist(Object 
transientObject)
Takes a transient object as an argument and 
associates it with the current session. The session 
tracks the object's changes and synchronizes the 
object with the database when Hibernate commits the 
transaction or flushes the session.
Serializable 
getIdentifier(Object 
persistentObject)
Returns the identifier of the persistent instance cached 
by the session, or throws an exception if the object is 
transient or is not associated with the current session. 
Note that the object identifier's name is determined 
through the mapping definition. This method allows 
us to access the object identifier when we do not know 
which of an object's properties is its identifier.
boolean contains(Object 
persistentObject)
Determines whether the persistent instance is 
associated with the current session.
void evict(Object object)
Disassociates the persistent instance with the current 
session. The session does not track the changes to be 
synchronized with the database.
void clear()
Clears the session of all cached instances, then 
cancels all pending saves, updates, and deletions that 
are managed by the session to be synchronized with 
the database.
void flush()
Forces the pending saves, updates, and deletions, 
currently managed by the session, to be synchronized 
with the database. This method must be called before 
committing the transaction and closing the session. 
If you do not call this method, the Transaction's 
commit() method calls it internally.
boolean isOpen()
Determines whether the session is open or closed.
boolean isDirty()
Determines whether the session contains any 
pending saves, updates, or deletions that must be 
synchronized with the database.

Chapter 8
[ 197 ]
Summary
All persisting operations in Hibernate are performed through the Session API. In this 
chapter, we discussed the life cycle of persistent objects inside Hibernate. The states 
an object goes through with respect to persistence are transient, persistent, detached, 
and removed. Transient objects are objects that have not been stored yet. Detached 
objects have already been stored but currently are not associated with a valid session 
instance. Persistent objects have already been stored and are currently associated 
with a valid session object. Removed objects are arranged to be removed from the 
database, but have not yet been removed. These objects are removed as soon as the 
session's associated transaction is committed. A session object is called valid when it 
has not been closed by invoking its close() method.
We also discussed the basic persistent operations which are exposed through some 
essential methods of the Session interface. These methods include the load(), 
save(), update(), refresh(), replicate(), and delete() methods.
Cascading operations was another topic introduced in this chapter. Cascading 
expresses what happens to associated object(s) when a persistent object is stored, 
updated, or removed from the database. Some valid values include save, 
save-update, delete, and delete-orphan.
Hibernate, like many other O/R mapping technologies, provides a lazy initialization 
mechanism, called lazy loading. This allows a proxy object to be used, instead 
of loading the real object from the database. Lazy loading enhances persistence 
performance, particularly when huge persistent objects exist in the database. Proxy 
generation can be disabled through the lazy attribute, used with the class and its 
nested mapping elements.


Querying In Hibernate
Queries are the vital part of any data-access code. Almost all applications need to 
investigate persistent objects and explore objects that satisfy specific criteria. SQL is a 
powerful language for querying persistent data and determining query criteria with 
WHERE and JOIN clauses. Using SQL, you can express any query restriction for the 
objects your application needs. As the number of query restrictions grows, the query 
expressions become more complex, making those query expressions hard to develop, 
test, and maintain. Moreover, the created query expressions may not be effective and 
optimized. Querying persistent objects is another area of the persistence layer where 
Hibernate simplifies data access development and produces effective queries.
Hibernate comes with a rich set of approaches to query persisted objects. It provides 
a wide range of querying methods, from native SQL to advanced Hibernate-specific 
approaches. In this chapter, we will discuss the querying approaches supported by 
Hibernate, which include the following:
Hibernate Query Language (HQL): Hibernate's HQL is a flexible, powerful 
SQL-like query approach. However, HQL and SQL have been designed to 
work with different data. While SQL queries deal directly with raw data in 
the database, HQL queries work with persisted objects and their properties 
through Hibernate. In other words, SQL queries are expressed in terms of 
tables, columns, views, and so on, whereas HQL expressions are states in 
object-oriented terms, using classes and properties of classes. Both SQL 
and HQL queries are specified as strings, composed of select, from, or 
where clauses.
Native SQL: Hibernate lets us use native SQL. As we will see later, if you 
use native SQL, you will lose some Hibernate benefits, including caching, 
so using native SQL is not recommended except in special cases.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 200 ]
Criteria API: Criteria API, an alternative to HQL, allows us to express 
queries and their restrictions programmatically, as opposed to HQL queries, 
which are specified as strings. Each query in the Criteria API is represented 
by an object of type Criteria. The Criteria objects use nested Criterion 
objects as their restrictions, which act as filters to pick up the persisted 
objects. The Criteria approach is also enriched by a wonderful capability 
called Query By Example (QBE), which lets you supply example objects to 
indicate the objects you are looking for.
HQL queries are great in most situations, particularly when object inheritance or 
associations come into query restrictions. In contrast, Criteria-based queries are 
useful when the query criteria are changing continuously, perhaps due to user input.
The querying language idea is not unique to Hibernate. Other ORM 
frameworks also provide their own query languages.
In this chapter, we will look at the different approaches provided by Hibernate, 
which may be used either by native Hibernate API or JPA.
The Session API and querying
In all of the approaches mentioned so far, the Session API is used to create an 
appropriate query object. This object is a handler for the query expression to specify 
restrictions or projections of the objects you want to retrieve, to pass runtime query 
parameters to query expressions, and to execute the query and retrieve the results. 
The following table provides a quick overview of the query interfaces involved in 
each approach, and the corresponding methods in the org.hibernate.Session and 
javax.persistence.EntityManager interfaces for supported query approaches:

Note that in all cases, a list() method is always called to retrieve the results.
Let's look at these approaches in detail and see how to use each approach in practice.
HQL
As mentioned earlier, HQL is an SQL-like, Hibernate-specific, and database 
independent language used to query persisted objects from the back-end rational 
database. Since Hibernate handles many relational storage issues, and solves the 
relevant problems when mapping the object-oriented world to the relational world, 
HQL is a great substitute for SQL when you're developing the object-oriented 
application which interacts with a relational database through Hibernate.
HQL is not a substitute for SQL. Rather, it lets us express our queries in an 
object-oriented form. When an HQL expression is executed, it is first transformed 
into an SQL statement. The generated SQL is then executed against the database, the 
result is placed in persistent objects, and the objects are returned to the application. 
The following figure depicts this scenario:
Database
HQL
SQL

Querying In Hibernate
[ 202 ]
The from clause
In its simplest form, an HQL expression consists of a from clause that ends with the 
name of a particular persistent class. Here is an example:
from Teacher
This HQL expression is used to query all instances of the Teacher class. 
Since auto-import is the default in the mapping files (see Chapter 5, the 
<hibernate-mapping> element), the Teacher class does not need to be expressed 
in the qualified form. In situations where the classnames are duplicated in the 
application, the duplicated classnames must be specified in the qualified form.
To execute an HQL expression, an org.hibernate.Query instance is first created by 
invoking the createQuery() method of a Session object. The method signature for 
the createQuery() method of Session is as follows:
public Query createQuery(String hqlQuery) throws HibernateException
This method's only String argument is the HQL expression you are executing. 
The returned Query instance provides many methods to specify restrictions on the 
results, execute the query, and obtain the query results. It also has other methods for 
setting named parameter values, adding a comment to Hibernate-generated SQL, 
setting a JDBC timeout and JDBC fetch sizes, and scrolling the result. We'll see more 
about this later in this section.
After you've created and prepared the Query instance, you can invoke its list() 
method to execute the query against the database and retrieve the results as a list of 
persistent objects. Here is an example:
Query query = session.createQuery("from Teacher");
java.util.List<Teacher> teachers = query.list();
The returned teachers object is the result of query execution, which contains 
persistent Teacher objects satisfying the query restrictions (there is no restriction in 
this query).
Like SQL, HQL is case-insensitive. Because Java is a case-sensitive 
language, you should express all Java-related words (such as 
classnames, property names, and so on) in the correct case. For 
example, the proper form of the HQL expression to query objects 
of the Teacher class is from Teacher, not from teacher, or 
any other variation of the word Teacher.

Chapter 9
[ 203 ]
The as clause
The simplest form of an HQL expression, which includes only a from clause 
followed by a classname, is sufficient to query all persistent instances of a particular 
class. However, in many situations, the application needs a subset of objects that 
match a set of criteria, instead of the entire set. In such situations, you need to assign 
an alias to the superset of objects, so you can refer back to them in other parts of the 
query, such as the criteria expression. For this purpose, you can use the as clause in 
the HQL expression, as in SQL.
For instance, to load all Teacher objects with an age of 30, you can use the 
as clause in the HQL expression (as follows) to assign the teacher alias to the 
persistent Teachers:
from Teacher as teacher where teacher.age=30
As you can see, the teacher alias lets us refer back to the objects in the where clause 
to restrict the result (I'll cover the where clause later in this section as this example 
is fairly self-explanatory). The as keyword is optional. It just provides a sense of 
familiarity for developers who have experience with SQL. Therefore, this HQL 
expression would be expressed as follows:
from Teacher teacher where teacher.age=30
The query expression may include more than one class. Each can have its own alias:
from Teacher as teacher, Student as student
It is good practice to name query aliases using an initial lowercase 
letter, consistent with the Java naming convention for variables.
Query an object's associations
SQL uses the JOIN clause to join two or more tables and query them together. Its 
cousin, HQL, also supports the join clause to query instances of two or more 
persistent classes in a single query. You can also use the join clause when the 
object's association criteria are part of the restrictions.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 204 ]
Hibernate presents five different joins borrowed from ANSI SQL, as shown in the 
following table:
Join Type
Description
Inner Join
Used to select persistent instances from one table, with their associated 
instances in another table. For instance, from Student s inner join 
s.courses as c selects all students with their associated courses. 
If a student instance is not associated with any course, it will not 
be selected.
Cross Join
Used to select persistent instances stored in different tables, whether 
or not they are associated. For instance, to select all Students, 
Teachers, and Courses, you can use HQL from Student s, 
Teacher t, Course c.
Left Outer Join
Is similar to inner join, but additionally selects all instances of the left 
persistent class that are not associated with any instance of the right 
persistent class. For instance, from Student s left outer join 
s.courses as c selects all students with their associated courses, 
and all students that are not associated with any Course instance.
Right Outer Join
Selects all instances of the right persistent class with their associated 
instances of the left persistent class. For instance, from Student s 
right outer join s.phone as p selects all students with their 
associated phones, and all students that are not associated with any 
phone instance.
Full Join
Selects all instances of two associated persistent classes, whether 
or not the instance in the database on either side is associated with 
another instance on the other side. For instance, from Student s 
full join s.phone as p selects all Student and Phone instances, 
that is, both the associated and the unassociated instances.
To understand retrieving persistent objects using join clauses, we assume that the 
STUDENT and COURSE tables contain the data shown in the figure below:
STUDENT
STUDENT_COURSE
FIRST_NAME
1
1
1
2
1

2
3
3
2
3
John
Robert
Kevin
STUDENT_ID
STUDENT_ID
COURSE_ID
COURSE_ID
NAME
Compiler
English
Physics
COURSE
Next, assume that we use the inner join to load the Student and Course instances 
as follows:
String joinHQL = "from Student s inner join s.courses as c";
Query joinQuery = session.createQuery(joinHQL);

Chapter 9
[ 205 ]
List results = joinQuery.list();
for(int i=0; i<results.size(); i++){
  Object[] objects = (Object[]) results.get(i);
  Student student = (Student) objects[0];
  Course course = (Course) objects[1];
}
The result is a list of arrays of Objects (Object[]). The first element of each array is 
a Student, and the second element is a Course instance. The following figure shows 
the structure of the results:
FIRST_NAME
1
1
2

John
John
Kevin
STUDENT_ID
COURSE_ID
NAME
English
English
Physics
results(0)-->
results(1)-->
results(2)-->
objects [0]
objects [1]
The select clause
Like SQL, HQL supports the select clause. This provides an efficient approach, 
letting you select only the desired properties of queried objects. In other words, 
while the from clause works with objects, the select clause works with the 
object's properties.
For example, to query only the first name of teachers, instead of loading the 
entire set of Teacher objects, you can use the following query expression with 
the select clause:
select teacher.firstName from Teacher teacher
If you want to select more than one property, specify the properties names as a 
comma-separated list. For example, to load firstName and lastName of Teacher 
objects, change the HQL query as follows:
select teacher.firstName, teacher.lastName from Teacher as teacher
The result of executing this HQL is a list of arrays. Each array has two members, 
maintaining, respectively, the firstName and the lastName of a selected object.
The generated SQL will only query the FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME columns, instead 
of the entire TEACHER table. Retrieving the required properties, instead of entire 
objects, has a performance effect (reducing network traffic, decreasing memory 
usage, and querying fewer columns in the database) of speeding up execution.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 206 ]
HQL's aggregate functions
HQL provides aggregate functions, so we can query information related to a 
group of objects. The syntax of these functions is the same as the syntax in SQL, 
and they also work in the same way. The only difference is that HQL's aggregate 
functions work with objects and the object's properties, instead of tables and the 
table's columns.
Aggregate functions supported in HQL are avg(), min(), max(), sum(), and 
count(). Each of these methods takes a string as an argument, which is the property 
name on which the function works. For example, the following HQL query returns 
the average age of the students:
select avg(student.age) from Student student
When you execute this query, you get a List object which contains a single Integer 
value. This is the case with all aggregate functions.
The count()function takes a property name as argument and returns the number of 
times that property appears in the result set. This function has two versions:
count(*)
count(aliasName.propertyName)
These count the number of all objects and the number of objects with the property 
propertyName in the result set, respectively.
You can use the distinct and all keywords with the count() function with the 
same semantics as in the count() method in SQL. The distinct keyword tells 
count() to only count the distinct and different values in the result set. For example, 
the following HQL returns only the number of different ages for students:
select count(distinct student.age) from Student student
If your query expression includes more than one aggregate method, the returned 
List object contains a number of objects. Each object corresponds to an aggregate 
method. For instance, the following snippet retrieves the minimum and maximum 
ages of students:
String queryHQL = "select min(std.age), max(std.age) from Student 
std";
Query query = session.createQuery(queryHQL);
List bounds = query.list();
Double min = (Double)bounds.get(0); 
Double max = (Double)bounds.get(1);

Chapter 9
[ 207 ]
The where clause
HQL is as flexible and efficient as SQL, because it provides the where clause to 
restrict a query's result. In HQL expressions, the where clause lets us express 
constraints on the property values of objects returned by the query, and restrict the 
query's result. Additionally, as you will see in this chapter, you may use the where 
clause in bulk-update or bulk-delete query expressions to restrict the objects being 
updated or deleted, respectively. Usually, you refer to the selected objects by an 
alias. If no alias exists, then you may refer to properties by name.
For example, the following query expressions are the same, returning all instances of 
Student with an age greater than 25:
from Student student where student.age>25
from Student where age>25
As you can see in these HQL statements, the where clause may include primitive 
values, such as numbers and Booleans, when a condition is specified. You can also 
use string values for comparisons in the where clause, but these must be inside single 
quotes. Additionally, it is possible to compare properties of objects to other properties.
To express restrictions in HQL and JPA-QL expressions, and define comparison 
restriction between properties, Hibernate and JPA support a wide range of rich and 
powerful comparison operators and functions, including these:
Operators/Functions
Names
Mathematical operators
+, -, *, /
Comparison operators
=, >=, <=, <>, !=, like, not like
Logical operators
and, or, not

minute(), hour(), day(), month(), year()
JPA standardized functions

length(), locate(), abs(), sqrt(), mod(), 
sort(), concat(), locate(), size()

Querying In Hibernate
[ 208 ]
Here is an example of using the not like and > operators to query all students who 
are older than 18, and whose first names do not start with "Jo":
from Student where age>18 and firstName not like ‘Jo%'
The like and not like operators come with the wildcard symbols % and _. The like 
and not like operators allow us to get matches that are, respectively, similar to or 
different from a phrase we supply before or after a symbol.
Refer to the Hibernate documentation at http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/
stable/core/reference/en/html_single/#queryhql-expressions for more 
details about these functions.
Positional versus named parameters
Like JDBC, Hibernate lets us use positional parameters to construct queries 
dynamically at runtime. These parameters are specified with a ? in query 
expressions, and are addressed with their position indexes to be filled with the 
desired values at runtime. The Query interface provides methods similar to the 
java.sql.PreparedStatement methods for binding arguments of Java types. 
These methods include setInteger(), setString(), setDate(), setLocale(), 
and setTimestamp(). Additionally, the Query interface provides the general 
setParameter() method for binding parameters with any type. When you use 
setParameter(), Hibernate automatically detects the parameter type and binds the 
parameter with the proper type. The following snippet uses parameters to construct 
an HQL expression:
String hql = "from Student where firstName = ? and lastName=?";
Org.hibernate.Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setString(0, "Arash"); 
query.setString(1, "Moradi");
List list = query.list();
We may use positional parameters with JPA as follows:
String jpaQL = "from Student std"+
               " where std.firstName=?1 and std.lastName=?2";
javax.persistence.Query query = entityManager.createQuery(jpaQL);
query.setParameter(1, "Arash");
query.setParameter(2, "Moradi");
List list = query.getResultList();
Hibernate index parameters start at 0 (query.setString(
0, "Arash");), whereas JPA's start at 1 (query.setParameter(
1, "Arash");). 

Chapter 9
[ 209 ]
Although this method of constructing a query dynamically is flexible enough, 
the following issue still needs to be addressed. If the position of parameter changes, 
the code that next assigns a value must change, as well. For example, suppose 
we swap firstName and lastName in the preceding HQL. In that case, we must 
change the query.setString() or query.setParameter() statements to assign the 
parameter's values properly.
To deal with this problem, Hibernate offers a more flexible approach, which is 
named parameters. Named parameters let you refer to each parameter with a name, 
instead of by index. Each parameter name is specified with an arbitrary name that 
begins with the prefix in query expressions. Then, parameters are referred to by their 
names, instead of their positions.
The following code shows changes to the previous snippet, which now uses named 
parameters instead of JDBC-style positional parameters:
String hql = "from Student where firstName=:firstName and
lastName=:lastName";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setString("firstName", "Arash"); 
query.setString("lastName", "Moradi");
List list = query.list();
As you can see, named parameters are assigned on the basis of their names, and 
not on their positions in a query. Using named parameters improves application 
maintenance, because adding or removing named parameters may effect fewer 
changes to the code than JDBC-like positional parameters.
HQL also permits us to use object parameters that are filled with persistent objects, 
rather than basic Java types. You accomplish this by using the setEntity() method 
of a Query object, which sets the persistent object as a parameter value. The following 
code queries Student objects that have a particular phone number, represented by a 
Phone object:
String phoneHQL = "from Phone where number='09723455667'";
Query  phoneQuery = session.createQuery(phoneHQL);
Phone phone = (Phone)phoneQuery.list().get(0);
…
String hql = "from Student as student where student.phone=:phone";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setEntity("phone", phone);
List students = query.list();
Note that setEntity() implicitly expands to the identifier of the phone object. 
This means we are looking for all students associated with a phone object that has a 
particular identifier value.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 210 ]
You can still use setParameter() instead of the setEntity() 
method to set a persistent object. In the snippet shown here, simply 
replace query.setEntity("phone", phone); with query.
setParameter("phone", phone);.
The order by and group by clauses
The returned objects of an HQL query may be ordered by any property of the selected 
objects. To do this, use the order by clause in the HQL expressions, either ascending 
(asc) or descending (desc). For example, the following HQL queries Student objects 
older than 20, and sorts them in ascending order by the firstName property:
from Student s order by s.firstName asc
The result can be ordered on more than one property. In this case, you need to add 
additional properties to the end of the order by clause as a comma-separated list. For 
instance, you can do this:
from Student s order by s.firstName asc, s.age desc
This selects all Student objects and first orders them in ascending order by 
firstName, and then in descending order by the age property.
HQL also lets us use the group by clause to group the returned aggregate values by 
any property of the selected objects:
select student.age, avg(student.age), count(student) from Student 
student 
group by student.age
If the underlying database supports it, you can use aggregate functions with having 
or order by clauses.
Neither the group by clause nor the order by clause may contain 
arithmetic expressions.

Chapter 9
[ 211 ]
Bulk updates and bulk deletes with HQL
Using HQL, you can also update or delete a set of persisted objects. The syntax 
of HQL for update and delete operations is similar to SQL. HQL uses the update 
and delete keywords with the set and where clause to update or delete rows that 
satisfy a set of criteria. For instance, to modify the name of a course, you can use the 
following HQL expression:
String updateHql = "update Course set name = :newName where name = :
name";
The usage of the set keyword in HQL is similar to the usage of set in SQL. It 
determines new values for object's properties. You can optionally use the where 
clause to restrict the object being updated.
Similarly, you can use the delete query with an optional where clause to remove a 
set of objects from the database. The following HQL expression is an example of a 
delete query to remove a course with a particular name from the database:
String deleteHql = "delete from Course where name = :name";
Note that both of these examples use named parameters to be set with runtime 
values before query execution.
Other steps of query execution are similar to the execution of an ordinary HQL 
query. You need to obtain a Query instance associated with the query expression, 
and then set the parameter values to the Query object before execution. Finally, you 
must invoke the executeUpdate() method of the Query instance, instead of the 
list() method that is used for normal HQL expressions. Here is an example:
String updateHql = "update Course set name = :newName where name = :
name";
Query query = session.createQuery(updateHql);
query.setString("name","Computer Programming");
query.setString("newName","Java Language Programming");
int rowsAffected = query.executeUpdate();
The executeUpdate() method returns an int value, representing the number of 
rows affected by execution of the update or delete query.
Since bulk-update and bulk-delete queries do not need to reload the 
object before update or delete execution, they are preferred to the 
Session's update() or delete() methods, particularly when there 
are many objects to update or delete.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 212 ]
Queries in native SQL
In addition to HQL, Hibernate lets us load persistent objects with native SQL queries. 
Although using native SQL doesn't seem useful, you may prefer to use native SQL 
in some situations. For example, you may need to utilize database-specific features 
which are not supported by HQL. Another situation is when you want to call a 
stored procedure. Moreover, you may use native SQL when you are migrating from 
a legacy JDBC-based data tier to Hibernate and need to use SQL in the application. In 
these cases, either you must use native SQL, or you may prefer to continue working 
with SQL.
Hibernate provides the org.hibernate.SQLQuery interface to work with SQL 
queries. To use it, pass the SQL query expression as a String argument to the 
createSQLQuery() method of the Session instance and obtain an SQLQuery 
instance. After all, the list() method of SQLQuery executes the query and fetches 
the result. The following snippet shows how to create an SQLQuery instance to 
execute an SQL query and execute it:
String sql = "SELECT * FROM STUDENT";
SQLQuery query = session.createSQLQuery(sql);
List results = query.list();
In its basic form, an SQL query returns a list of scalars. In this example, the results 
are a list of Object arrays (Object[]) that is, each array holds a row of the STUDENT 
table. Hibernate uses ResultSetMetadata to deduce the actual order and types of 
the returned scalar values. You can discard undesired columns, by invoking the 
addScalar() method as follows:
String sql = "SELECT * FROM STUDENT";
SQLQuery query = session.createSQLQuery(sql); 
query.addScalar("ID", Hibernate.LONG);
query.addScalar("FIRST_NAME", Hibernate.STRING);
query.addScalar("BIRTHDAY", Hibernate.DATE);
List results = query.list();
Iterator itr = results.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
  Object[] row = (Object[]) itr.next();
  for (int i = 0; i < row.length; i++) {
    Object column = row[i];
    System.out.println(column);
  }
}

Chapter 9
[ 213 ]
Although the query uses *, and could return more than the three listed columns, 
Hibernate will not use ResultSetMetdata. Instead, it explicitly gets the ID, 
FIRST_NAME, and BIRTHDAY columns as a Long, a String, and a DATE from the 
returned result set. Note that Hibernate still uses "SELECT * FROM STUDENT" to 
query the database. Hibernate then selects the specified columns from the result 
of the query execution and puts each selected row in the returned list as an 
Object array.
In addition to the addScalar() method, SQLQuery provides another method, 
which is addEntity(). With this method, you can tell Hibernate to select only those 
columns from the returned resultset that are required to populate a persistent 
class. Look at the following example:
String sql = "SELECT {student.*} FROM Student student";
SQLQuery query = session.createSQLQuery(sql);
query.addEntity("student", Student.class);
List results = query.list();
{student.*} determines all columns associated with the alias student, that is, 
the STUDENT table, to be selected from the database. After the query executes, the 
results object contains instances of the Student class. Notice that this query is not 
executed in the target database as is. Hibernate transforms it to the appropriate SQL 
of the target database.
Look at another example:
String query = "select {student.*} from STUDENT student" +
     " join ADDRESS address on student.ADDRESS_ID = address.ID" +
               " where address.STREET = :street";
SQLQuery sqlQuery = session.createSQLQuery(query);
sqlQuery.addEntity("student", Student.class);
sqlQuery.setParameter("street", "rockway");
This example queries students who live on the same street. As you can see, the query 
selects the STUDENT table with the alias student, and joins it to the ADDRESS table 
with the alias address. The query uses these aliases to refer to the tables later, in the 
query restrictions. The addEntity() method here indicates that Hibernate should 
only return the columns required to populate the Student class.
Note that this example also shows how to use a named parameter with an SQL 
query. With SQLQuery, you still have the option to use the general setParameter() 
method for setting parameters with any type, or proprietary methods for each Java 
type such as setString(), setDate(), setTimestamp(), and so on.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 214 ]
In addition to the addScalar() and addEntity() methods used for selecting the 
required columns, SQLQuery provides the addJoin() method to select columns of 
tables joined to a table by the query. Look at the following example:
String sql = "select {student.*}, {phone.*} from STUDENT student" +
             " join PHONE phone on student.ID = phone.ID" +
             " where LAST_NAME=:lastName";
SQLQuery sqlQuery = session.createSQLQuery(sql);
sqlQuery.addEntity("student", Student.class);
sqlQuery.addJoin("phone", "student.phone");
sqlQuery.setParameter("lastName", "Romeny");
List results = sqlQuery.list();
This example selects a row of STUDENT, and a row of PHONE, which are associated 
with each other through their ID column for a particular student with last 
name Romeny.
This example selects columns from two tables, and we can select the columns 
obviously with two persistent classes. The addEntity() method selects columns of 
the first table that populate the Student class. The addJoin() method tells Hibernate 
to select columns that populate the associated phone of the Student instance.
Named SQL and HQL queries
Named queries refer to SQL or HQL queries that are defined declaratively in the 
mapping files, but are called programmatically in the Java code. The syntax of named 
SQL and HQL queries is the same as the syntax of ordinary SQL and HQL queries, 
which are defined in the Java code. They could include either JDBC-like positional 
parameters (?) or named parameters.
Named queries have many benefits. At first, their syntax is checked at deploy 
time, and not during program execution. You can have several different named 
queries and easily switch from one to another during development. Additionally, 
because they are kept separated from Java code, they are easy to maintain. During 
application, development or deployment can easily change, without requiring any 
change to the application code.
The <query> and <sql-query> elements are used, respectively, to declare HQL and 
SQL queries in the mapping files. Both use a name attribute, which assigns a name to 
the query to use for calling the query. Note that the name used for each query must 
be globally unique in the application.

Chapter 9
[ 215 ]
The following code shows a definition of both a named HQL query, and an SQL 
query, in the mapping file for the Student class:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class name="com.packtpub.springhibernate.Student">
    <!—properties mappings omitted -->
    <query name="hqlOlderQuery">
      <![CDATA[select std.age from Student std where std.age > :age]]>
    </query>
    <sql-query name="sqlOlderQuery">
      <return-scalar column="age" type="double"/>
      <![CDATA[select std.age from Student as std where std.age>:
       age]]>
    </sql-query>
  </class>
</hibernate-mapping>
As you can see, the <sql-query> element comes with a nested element, called 
<return-scalar>. This element tells Hibernate the type of data it expects to 
receive when the SQL query executes. This element is not used with HQL query 
definitions, since Hibernate parses the HQL queries and discovers the query 
execution's result type.
The <return-scalar> element comes with two attributes, column and type, which 
specify the name of the selected column and its SQL type, respectively.
You should define the SQL or HQL queries inside a CDATA section 
if the query contains XML markup. Doing so maintains the integrity 
of the XML, and ensures that the XML parser can always process the 
query during development and maintenance.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 216 ]
It is also possible to define named queries through JPA annotations. For this purpose, 
JPA provides @NamedQuery and @NamedNativeQuery annotations, located in the 
javax.persistence package, to define named queries inside the Java code. The 
following code snippet shows an example of using the @NameQuery annotation to 
define a named query:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch09;
import ...;
@NamedQueries({
    @NamedQuery(
        name = "hqlOlderQuery",
        query = "select std.age from Student std where std.age>:age"
    ),
    ...
})
@Entity
public class Student { ... }
Every named query is called by its name, defined by the name attribute for that query 
in the mapping file. To execute a named query, first call the getNamedQuery() of 
the Session instance with the specified named query and obtain a Query object. The 
Query instance can then be used as usual to execute the query and fetch the result. 
For example, to execute the previous queries, use the following snippets:
//executing the name HQL query
Query hqlQuery = session.getNamedQuery("hqlOlderQuery");
hqlQuery.setDouble("age", 20);
List r1 = hqlQuery.list();
//executing the name SQL query
Query sqlQuery = session.getNamedQuery("sqlOlderQuery");
sqlQuery.setDouble("age", 20);
List r2 = sqlQuery.list();
To execute a JPA named query, we need to use code similar to the above, but with 
the java.persistence.EntityManager and javax.persistence.Query interfaces, 
as follows:
Query query = entityManager.createNamedQuery("hqlOlderQuery");
query.setParameter("age", 20);
List result = query.getResultList();

Chapter 9
[ 217 ]
Using the Criteria API
The Criteria API is another approach to querying persistent objects. This API 
lets us build query expressions programmatically through Java objects. It provides 
compile-time syntax checking, rather than runtime processing (which is provided 
by HQL).
The Criteria API provides a unique Query By Example (QBE) functionality that is 
not provided by other query approaches. Using QBE, you can create an instance of 
the queried class, and set the instance's properties with the values that you want the 
result to have. The result of the query is all persistent objects that match the instance.
In general, the Criteria approach is less flexible and less powerful than HQL. Criteria 
queries are less readable and harder to understand than HQL queries. Typically, 
creating the right query with Criteria requires more effort. More importantly, 
Criteria queries cannot be declared in the mapping metadata, as HQL queries 
can. This may increase maintenance problems.
Although HQL and Criteria queries are interchangeable, in some situations one is 
more fitting than the other. For instance, when query restrictions are constructed 
from user input, or when they change during application execution, it's better to 
use the Criteria API to create a query expression. HQL expressions are simple string 
literals whose syntax is checked at runtime, whereas the Criteria queries are Java 
objects that naturally are checked at compile time. Therefore, manipulating the 
string query expressions which are constructed from the user input, which might 
fail in some conditions, would be painful. Using Criteria, you can create nested, 
structured query expressions based on the data input by a user, which is a more 
convenient approach.
Using a simple Criteria
Using the Criteria API involves the org.hibernate.Criteria and org.
hibernate.criterion.Criterion interfaces and the org.hibernate.criterion.
Restrictions class. Each query is presented with a Criteria object, and any 
restriction on the query is indicated with an object of Criterion. Because Criteria 
and Criterion are interfaces and cannot be instantiated, session objects and the 
Restrictions class serve as factories for them.
To create a Criteria query, call the createCriteria() method of the Session 
instance. This method takes a java.lang.Class as an argument, which determines 
the persistent class you are going to query, and returns an object of type Criteria. 
Here is an example of querying Teacher instances persistent in the database:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Teacher.class);

Querying In Hibernate
[ 218 ]
The Criteria interface is analogous to the Query interface in HQL. Both 
interfaces have a list() method which returns the query result as an object 
of type java.util.List. You can then iterate over the result to retrieve each 
restrictions-matched object:
List results = criteria.list();
Iterator itr = results.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
  Teacher teacher = (Teacher) itr.next();
}
However, in most situations, you need to retrieve a subset of objects that satisfy a 
set of restrictions, instead of all persistent objects of one type. The Criteria API lets 
you express restrictions with nested, structured Criterion objects. The Criterion 
instances are added in a tree-like structure to express query restrictions.
To create a Criterion instance, call the appropriate factory method of the 
Restrictions class. The Restrictions class provides many static methods to 
create different Criterion objects with different restrictions. Each Criterion object 
represents a specific restriction that corresponds to the factory method that is called 
for creating that object. For instance, the eq() method is used to create an equal 
restriction. Here is an example:
Criterion criterion = Restrictions.eq("firstName","Edward");
In this example, the criterion object indicates that the firstName property must 
have "Edward" as its value.
Next, associate the Criterion object with the Criteria instance through the 
Criteria object's add() method:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Teacher.class);
Criterion criterion = Restrictions.eq("firstName","Edward");
criteria.add(criterion);
List results = criteria.list();
Looking at the Restrictions class's factory 
methods
As mentioned earlier, the Restrictions class provides many static methods which 
express a wide range of restrictions for queries. Let's explore these methods and look 
at examples to see how to use them.

Chapter 9
[ 219 ]
Equality restrictions
We use the eq() and ne() methods to restrict a particular property of objects to have 
or not to have a particular value. Here is the syntax of each:
public static SimpleExpression eq(String propertyName, Object 
propertyValue)
public static SimpleExpression ne(String propertyName, Object 
propertyValue)
Both methods return an object of type SimpleExpression, which is an implemented 
class of Criterion. The first method constructs an equality restriction, which 
determines that the propertyName of the desired objects must have the value 
propertyValue.
For example, the following snippet obtains all Student objects whose firstName 
property has the value "Edward":
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.eq("firstName","Edward"));
List results = criteria.list();
In contrast to eq(), the ne() method specifies inequality. It determines that the 
propertyName of the desired objects must not have the propertyValue value. The 
following snippet retrieves all Student objects whose firstName property value 
differs from "Edward":
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.ne("firstName","Edward"));
List results = criteria.list();
Note that these methods cannot be used to retrieve objects with a property of null 
or not-null values. As you will see, the isNull()or isNotNull() methods are used 
instead. If the value to which the restrictions apply is calculated dynamically by a 
process in the application, or is entered by the user, you must control the values and 
prevent nulls in advance.
In addition to these methods, the Restrictions class provides the allEq() method 
to select objects with several properties that have particular values, so it's like an 
AND operation (discussed later in this chapter). This method's syntax is as follows:
public static Criterion allEq(Map properties)

Querying In Hibernate
[ 220 ]
This method takes a parameter of type java.util.Map. The keys in the map specify 
the property names we want to constrain, and the values in the map indicate the 
corresponding values for those properties. Here is an example of this method:
Map map = new HashMap();
map.put("firstName", "John");
map.put("lastName", "Robinston");
map.put("age", new Double(19));
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.allEq(map));
List results = criteria.list();
The results object contains all Student objects with a firstName of "John", 
lastName of "Robinston", and age of 19.
Null and empty restrictions
The isNull()and isNotNull() methods select persistent objects that have a 
particular property that is null or is not null, respectively:
public static Criterion isNull(String property)
public static Criterion isNotNull(String property)
For instance, the following snippet selects Student objects whose middle names 
are null:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.isNull("middleName"));
List results = criteria.list();
Besides the null restrictions, two other methods provided by the Restrictions class 
constrain an object property to be empty or not empty:
public static Criterion isEmpty(String property)
public static Criterion isNotEmpty(String property)
Likeness restrictions
We can retrieve all objects with a property that matches a given pattern. The 
Restrictions class provides two methods for this purpose: like() and ilike(). 
The simplest forms of these methods are as follows:
public static SimpleExpression like(String propertyName, Object value)
public static SimpleExpression ilike(String propertyName, Object 
value)

Chapter 9
[ 221 ]
Both like() and ilike() methods construct a likeness restriction that is 
transformed into an SQL LIKE clause. The like() method cares about case, while 
ilike() ignores case. The following snippet fetches all Student objects that have a 
firstName starting with "Jo" (case doesn't matter):
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.ilike("firstName","Jo%"));
List results = criteria.list();
Note that we used the % character, which has the same meaning as in the SQL LIKE 
clause, to match patterns in the string.
Two other forms of these methods are as follows:
public static SimpleExpression like(String propertyName, 
                                    String value,
                                    MatchMode matchMode)
public static SimpleExpression ilike(String propertyName, 
                                     String value,
                                     MatchMode matchMode)
These take an extra parameter of type org.hibernate.criterion.MatchMode, 
which lets us specify how the persisted data must match the given pattern. The 
MatchMode class is a type-safe enumeration with four static members, allowing 
specification of four different matches:
ANYWHERE: Any part of the selected data may match the given pattern.
END: The end of the selected data must match the given pattern.
EXACT: The selected data must exactly match the given pattern.
START: The start of the selected data must match the given pattern.
The following snippet gets every Student object that has a firstName which 
includes "bob", in which the matching operation does not care about case:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.ilike("firstName","bob",
                                MatchMode.ANYWHERE));
List results = criteria.list();

Comparison restrictions
The Restrictions class provides several methods for constructing comparison 
expressions. These methods select all objects that have a particular property that is 
greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, less than or equal to, or between the 
specified values, respectively:
public static SimpleExpression gt(String propertyName, Object 
propveryValue)
public static SimpleExpression ge(String propertyName, Object 
propertyValue)
public static SimpleExpression lt(String propertyName, Object 
propertyValue)
public static SimpleExpression le(String propertyName, Object 
propertyValue)
public static Criterion between(String propertyName, Object lowValue, 
ObjecthighValue)
The following snippet shows how ge() can select all students whose ages are greater 
than or equal to 25:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.ge("age",new Integer(25)));
List results = criteria.list();
In addition to these methods, selecting objects by comparing their property values 
with a specified value, the Restrictions class provides other methods that let us 
select objects based on comparing of two properties values. The following code 
shows these methods:
public static PropertyExpression eqProperty(String property1, Object
property2)
public static PropertyExpression leProperty(String property1, Object
property2)
public static PropertyExpression ltProperty(String property1, Object
property2)
These methods indicate, respectively, that two named properties must have the same 
value, that the first named property is less than or equal to the second, and that the 
first named property is less than the second.
For instance, the following snippet selects all customers whose deposits are less than 
their credit:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Customer.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.lt("deposit","credit"));
List results = criteria.list();

Chapter 9
[ 223 ]
Logical restrictions
You can combine Criterion objects to build a nested, structured query expression. 
This means that a Criteria object may be constructed of more than one Criterion. 
This is easy to demonstrate:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.eq("firstName","John"));
criteria.add(Restrictions.ge("age",new Double(19)));
List results = criteria.list();
The results object contains all Student objects with the firstName "John", and an 
age greater than or equal to 19.
When Criterion objects are added to the Criteria by the 
add() method, the operation is interpreted as an AND.
The Restrictions class also provides the or() and and() methods. The or() 
method builds a compound Criterion that satisfies one or both Criterion 
restrictions. In contrast, the and() method builds a compound Criterion that 
satisfies both Criterion restrictions. These methods are as follows:
public static LogicalExpression and(Criterion criterion1, Criterion
criterion2)
public static LogicalExpression or(Criterion criterion1, Criterion
criterion2)
The following snippet shows how to use or(), in which the selected objects must 
either have "John" as their firstName, or be equal to or older than 19:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
Criterion criterion1 = Restrictions.eq("firstName","John");
Criterion criterion2 = Restrictions.ge("age",new Double(19));
criteria.add(Restrictions.or(criterion1, criterion2));
List results = criteria.list();
In addition to AND and OR restrictions, the Restrictions class allows us to build a 
negated Criterion through the not() method:
public static Criterion not(Criterion criterion)
For example, to load all students whose ages are not greater than and equal to 19 
(that is, less than 19), the not() method can be used as follows:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
Criterion criterion = Restrictions.ge("age",new Double(19));
criteria.add(Restrictions.not(criterion));
List results = criteria.list();

Querying In Hibernate
[ 224 ]
Size restrictions
You may also use the sizeXx() methods to construct constraints using size 
comparisons. These methods include the following:
public static Criterion sizeEq(String s, int i)
public static Criterion sizeNe(String s, int i)
public static Criterion sizeGt(String s, int i)
public static Criterion sizeLt(String s, int i)
public static Criterion sizeGe(String s, int i)
public static Criterion sizeLe(String s, int i)
The description of each size restrictions is as follows:
sizeEq: size equality
sizeNe: size not-equality
sizeGt: size greater than
sizeLt: size less than
sizeGe: size greater than or equal to
sizeLe: size less than or equal to
Disjunctions and conjunctions
If you want to create an OR expression with many Criterion objects, you can use an 
instance of org.hibernate.criterion.Disjunction. Using this object is equivalent 
to, but more convenient than, using several OR restrictions. To obtain a Disjunction 
object, call the disjunction() method:
public static Disjunction disjunction()
If you want to create an AND expression with many criterion objects, you can use an 
object of org.hibernate.criterion.Conjunction. The conjunction() method 
returns a Conjunction object as follows:
public static Conjunction conjunction()
The Disjunction class and the Conjunction class provide add() methods to apply 
an OR or an AND, respectively, between the criteria.

Chapter 9
[ 225 ]
The following code uses a conjunction object to construct an AND expression:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
Criterion age = Restrictions.gt("age",new Double(25.0));
Criterion firstName = Restrictions.like("firstName","John%");
Conjunction conjunction = Restrictions.conjunction();
conjunction.add(age);
conjunction.add(firstName);
criteria.add(conjunction);
List results = criteria.list();
SQL restrictions
SQL restrictions are useful when you need to use an SQL clause that is not 
supported by Hibernate through the Criteria query API. Different methods in 
the Restrictions class construct this type of restriction:
public static Criterion sqlRestriction(String) 
public static Criterion sqlRestriction(String, Object, Type)
public static Criterion sqlRestriction(String, Object[], Type[])
The first form of the method only takes a String parameter, indicating the 
SQL restriction. The other forms are useful when the SQL restriction includes 
JDBC parameters (?). The extra arguments determine the value(s) and type(s) 
of the parameters.
The following snippet shows how to use this method to create an SQL restriction:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.add(Restrictions.sqlRestriction("{alias}.FIRST_NAME like
‘John%'"));
List results = criteria.list();
{alias} and FIRST_NAME refer, respectively, to the table and a column in that table 
that store the Student objects, and the firstName property of the Student objects.
Query By Example (QBE)
Hibernate lets us create an example instance of a persistent class and set properties 
of the instance with the desired values, and then use the sample instance to retrieve 
all persistent instances in the database that match the properties of the example 
instance. This functionality, called Query By Example (QBE), provides much flexibility 
in development, and produces cleaner, neater, and more testable code.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 226 ]
QBE is provided by org.hibernate.criterion.Example as a subclass of 
Criterion. To use QBE, create an example instance of the persistent class and set 
the desired values. Then, use the create() method of Example to create an Example 
instance. Use the Example instance in your Criteria construction to find the 
matches. Look at this example:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
Student student= new Student();
student.setFirstName("John");
Example example = Example.create(student);
criteria.add(example);
List results = criteria.list();
The results list contains all persistent Students whose firstName is John. Note 
that Hibernate only takes care of the firstName field, ignoring others that were 
not set. However, it is possible to configure the Example instance to indicate how 
Hibernate should examine the property values to create a query. The methods of the 
Example instance are used for this purpose. The following table summarizes some of 
these methods:
Method
Description
static Example create(java.lang.
Object persistentObject)
Creates a new instance of the Example class, 
which identifies all persistent instances in 
the database that match non-null properties 
of the persistentObject.
Example enableLike()
Enables Hibernate to use the like 
operator when it finds matches for 
String properties.
Example enableLike(MatchMode 
matchMode)
Indicates that Hibernate must use the 
like operator to find matches that occur 
in particular area: MatchMode.START, 
MatchMode.END, MatchMode.ANYWHERE, 
and MatchMode.EXACT. (See the Likeness 
Restrictions section for more information.)
Example excludeNone()
Determines that properties with zero or null 
values should also be used when matches 
are found.
Example excludeProperty(String 
propertyName)
Excludes a particular named property when 
finding matches.
Example excludeZeros()
Excludes properties with zero values when 
finding matches.
Example ignoreCase()
Determines that Hibernate must ignore 
the case of String properties when 
finding matches.

Chapter 9
[ 227 ]
The following code illustrates these methods:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
Student student = new Student();
student.setFirstName("Bob");
Example example = Example.create(student);
example.ignoreCase();
example.enableLike(MatchMode.ANYWHERE);
criteria.add(example);
List results = criteria.list();
This example retrieves all Student instances whose firstName includes the string 
"bob", regardless of case.
Paging the query result
Often, a huge number of persistent objects satisfies your query restrictions. This 
means that many rows of the database are selected, and a large number of objects 
are loaded in memory when the query is executed. Two problems arise:
Loading a large set of data in memory affects the application's performance.
It may not be possible to show the entire set of data in the user interface. 
Even if this is possible, application users do not want to view the entire result 
in a single page.
In these situations, you can use a pagination technique to load and show only a 
subset of data, rather than all of it. The user interface that shows the data allows the 
user to navigate to the next and previous subsets of data.
In Hibernate, the Query and Criteria interfaces both provide the setFirstResult() 
and setMaxResults() methods to implement the pagination technique. The 
setFirstResult() method allows us to specify the starting point of the bounds 
(that is, the first row in the result set to load) using a zero-based index. The 
setMaxResults() method determines the maximum number of objects that 
you expect to load. Note that the pagination technique applies to Query and 
Criteria objects, and does not affect HQL query expressions or the Criteria 
construction process.
Here is an example of using Hibernate pagination when loading objects of 
type Teacher:
Query query = session.createQuery("from Teacher");
query.setFirstResult(10);
query.setMaxResults(20);
List teachers = query.list();
•
•

Querying In Hibernate
[ 228 ]
This snippet retrieves 20 Teacher instances, starting from row 11 and finishing with 
row 30. You can use the returned value of the list() method normally, as when the 
pagination technique is not used. To load the next page of the query result, set up 
the Query instance with the first result 30, and the max result 20, and then execute 
query again.
In addition to the setFirstResult() and setMaxResults() methods, the Query 
and Criteria interfaces both provide the uniqueResult() method, which is useful 
for retrieving the query result when the result set contains only one object:
String hql = "from Teacher where phoneNumber = ‘+98-912-3456789'";
Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
query.setMaxResults(1);
Teacher teacher = (Teacher)query.uniqueResult();
If the result set contains more than one object, calling this method will 
throw org.hibernate.NonUniqueResultException. Note that we used 
query.setMaxResults(1) to retrieve only one object from the database, even 
if more than one object exists, so we prevented a possible exception throwing.
The following code shows how pagination is applied to a Criteria object:
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Teacher.class);
Criterion criterion = Restrictions.eq("phoneNumber","+98-912-
3456789");
criteria.add(criterion); 
criteria.setFirstResult(1);
criteria.setMaxResults(10);
List results = criteria.list();
The pagination is applicable in JPA through the setFirstResult(), 
setMaxResults(), and getSingleResult() methods provided by the 
javax.persistence.Query interface. setFirstResult() and setMaxResults() 
specify the bounds of the retrieved objects. The getSingleResult() method works 
similarly to uniqueResult() in native Hibernate API, but throws an exception 
whether the result is empty, or there is more than one result. The following shows 
an example of JPA pagination support:
String jpaQL = "from Teacher where phoneNumber = ‘+98-912-3456789'";
javax.persistence.Query query = 
              entityManager.createQuery(jpaQL);
query.setMaxResults(1);
Teacher teacher = query.getUniqueResult();

Chapter 9
[ 229 ]
You can find much similarity between JPA and Hibernate native API in the code 
snippet above.
Logging the Hibernate-Generated SQL
In some situations, using an HQL or Criteria query may not provide what you 
want, or you may not know how changing the HQL or Criteria query will affect 
results. In such cases, you can configure Hibernate to show the generated SQL in a 
log file, or in the application console. A query analyzer can then trace or analyze the 
generated SQL.
The simplest way to show the generated SQL is by setting hibernate.show_sql in 
the configuration properties file, or show_sql in the configuration XML file, with 
true. You can also forward the generated SQL in the log files by setting up Log4j to 
debug. Besides, there are specific categories for the SQL log output, providing full 
control on the SQL logging. To learn more about logging in Hibernate, look at this 
book's Appendix, or at the Hibernate website:
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html_single/
#configuration-logging
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed querying in Hibernate. Hibernate provides three 
distinct ways to query the persistent objects: HQL, native SQL, and the Criteria API.
HQL is an SQL-like language that, unlike SQL (which works on raw data in the 
database), lets us express queries in an object-oriented form. Like SQL, HQL is not 
case-sensitive, but Java-related words, such as class and property names, should 
appear in the correct case.
The simplest form of HQL starts with a from clause. A where clause can be added to 
the end of a from clause to restrict the query with constraints.
Hibernate lets us query persistent objects with native SQL. To execute a native 
SQL query, you can pass the query expression to the createSQLQuery() method 
of Session and obtain a org.hibernate.SQLQuery object. You can then treat the 
SQLQuery instance like the Query instance in HQL. Using native SQL bypasses some 
Hibernate benefits, such as caching, so using native SQL is not recommended.

Querying In Hibernate
[ 230 ]
The Criteria API offers another approach to querying objects. This API lets you 
express the desired query programmatically. The core interfaces inside this API 
are Criteria and Criterion. Each Criteria object specifies a query expression, 
which may consist of an arbitrary number of Criterion objects, each one referring 
to a restriction. The Criteria object is obtained through a Session object, and each 
Criterion is constructed by the Restrictions class, which acts as a factory for 
all Criterion.

Inversion of Control 
with Spring
Welcome to Chapter 10, where you will start developing with Spring. This chapter 
introduces the Inversion of Control (IoC) pattern and discusses how Spring 
provides IoC at the heart of its framework. Chapter 1 had a quick discussion about 
IoC and its motivation. In that chapter, you learned why we are interested in IoC and 
how it allows us to create more manageable and maintainable code. Also, Chapter 3 
gave you a simple example of using IoC.
As those chapters discussed, IoC is about application objects. It aims to provide 
a simple mechanism for managing application objects and their dependencies. 
With IoC, the application itself is not responsible for obtaining required objects. 
Instead, Spring (or any other IoC framework) is configured to provide them for the 
application. Using IoC involves two activities:
Defining object relations in terms of Java interfaces or abstract classes.
Calling an outside object, called an IoC container (in our case, Spring), to 
instantiate objects, provide them where they are needed, and manage their 
life cycles.
Objects configured with IoC are not required to have dependencies on the container 
itself. They are also not required to be aware of the concrete classes of their 
relationships or how to locate them.
In contrast to many other features of Spring, which are dedicated to a 
particular layer of application architecture, IoC is a general and extensive 
concept that may appear in any area of application architecture.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 232 ]
In this chapter, you will learn more about IoC and its flavor of dependency injection. 
You will learn how Spring is configured and used as an IoC container for application 
objects. You will also learn about beans, which are the objects managed by the Spring 
IoC container, as well as bean factories and application context (the Spring IoC 
functionality for managing these beans).
IoC is not a Spring-specific concept. Instead, it's based on Java language 
structures. Spring (or any other IoC container) merely provides a 
framework to develop IoC-style code, and allows us to configure 
application objects and their relations in an IoC fashion through XML, 
instantiate objects, and construct object graphs at runtime.
First, let's discuss what the term Inversion of Control means.
Inversion of Control and dependency 
injection
At the lowest level, Java applications consist of Java interfaces and classes. These 
classes and interfaces make up the application components, which interact with 
each other to provide services and accomplish the application's job. These objects are 
dependent on each other, and we call an object dependent if it uses other objects to do 
its job. In this case, all of the other objects that are used by the object are called the 
object's dependencies. The following figure shows a dependency relationship between 
objects A and B:
<<uses>>
A
<<Dependant>>
B
<<Dependancy>>
Dependency push versus dependency pull
It is said that an object pulls its dependencies if the object itself is responsible 
for providing its dependencies from its environment. The object may do this by 
instantiating dependencies, or by looking up an outside object for them, as the 
following figure illustrates:

Chapter 10
[ 233 ]
A
A
<<Dependant>>
<<Dependant>>
B
B
<<Dependancy>>
<<Dependancy>>
1. look up
Outside
(Container)
2. Instantiate
instantiates
3. Use
Pulling dependencies is the traditional object configuration normally used in 
non-IoC-style code.
Most of the time, a common design pattern called Service Locator, is 
used with the pulling approach. A service locator object intermediates 
the dependant and the container, hides the complexities of interacting 
with the container, and provides a single point of control. Sometimes it 
improves performance by providing a caching mechanism.
In contrast, the object may be free from providing its dependencies. Instead, 
another object is responsible for providing dependencies and pushes them into the 
object. This type of object provision, illustrated in the following figure, is called 
dependency pushing:
A
<<Dependant>>
B
<<Dependancy>>
2. Push
Outside
(Container)
1. Instantiate
3. Use
In this push strategy, object A no longer takes care of dependency creation, and the 
container injects the dependency into the dependent.
As its name implies, Inversion of Control indicates inverting the control 
of object instantiations. IoC lets us move control from dependents to the 
container and provide dependents with the dependencies they need.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 234 ]
Dependency injection
Generally, externalizing object creation and management is called Inversion of 
Control, but in practice, different approaches can implement IoC. The type shown in 
the previous figure is a particular type of IoC, in which dependencies are injected by 
the container to the dependent object. This is formally known as dependency injection.
Martin Fowler calls IoC dependency injection when the dependencies 
are provided by a container and injected into dependents. Therefore, 
dependency injection is a specific form of IoC, in which the dependencies 
are provided by a container.
Because it decouples the application code meaningfully, IoC allows the creation of 
more manageable and testable code.
Inversion of Control in Spring
Spring supports IoC at its core. All other features of Spring, such as AOP, the web 
framework, transaction management, and so on, run on its lightweight IoC container. 
This means that you are always involved with the Spring IoC, even if you are using 
another feature of the Spring framework.
Let's continue our discussion with an example application and see how it can be 
implemented with non-IoC-style code. We'll then apply IoC to the application code 
to see how Spring's IoC capabilities decouple application classes and solve the 
dependency problem.
Application definition
Suppose the application uses a class as a notification service to notify the system 
administrator when a fatal problem occurs inside the system. The notification service 
may use either an email notifier or an SMS notifier to report the problem.
Implementing non-IoC-style code
The notification system's class diagram is shown in the following diagram. In 
this diagram, note that Client is a typical class in the application, using the 
notification service:

Chapter 10
[ 235 ]
Client
<<uses>>
<<uses>>
<<uses>>
NotificationService
SMSNotifier
EmailNotifier
As the previous figure shows, any client can call the NotificationService 
class. Consequently, NotificationService may choose either EmailNotifier 
or SMSNotifier, based on the administrator's preference, to report the problem. 
In this example, the Client class is dependent on NotificationService, and 
NotificationService is dependent on EmailNotifier or SMSNotifier. The 
following code shows the EmailNotifier class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class EmailNotifier {
  public void notify(String text) throws NotifyException {
    //sending text as an email to the administrator
  }
}
And this is the SMSNotifier class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class SMSNotifier {
  public void notify(String text) throws NotifyException {
    //sending text as a SMS
  }
}
And here is the NotificationService class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class NotificationService {
  EmailNotifier notifier = new EmailNotifier();
  boolean retryOnFail = true;
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    try {
      notifier.notify(message);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
      if(retryOnFail) {
        //notifying again

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 236 ]
        notify(message);
      } else {
        throw new ServiceException(e);
      }
    }
  }
}
These classes use the specialized exception classes; ServiceException and 
NotifyException extend RuntimeException. 
Now, any client may use code such as the following to notify the administrator:
try {
  NotificationService ns = new NotificationService();
  String msg = "A message indicating "+
               " a fatal error inside the system...";
  ns.notify(msg);
} catch(ServiceException e) {
  //handling exception
}
NotificationService uses an instance of Notifier to notify the administrator. The 
NotificationService class directly instantiates a known types of Notifier, in this 
case, it is the EmailNotifer. As a result, NotificationService has a dependency 
on both the Notifier interface and a specific implementation class: if we want to 
change the notification strategy, we need to change the NotificationService class.
The same problem exists for the client, since this class directly uses a specific type of 
NotificationService, with no possibility of specialization.
Let's discuss how these dependencies can be eliminated when the IoC pattern is 
applied to the code.
Applying IoC
To apply IoC, and see how the object relationships change when they use IoC, we 
split up NotificationService into the NotificationServiceImpl class and 
the NotificationService interface. This interface exposes the functionality of 
the concrete notification class, NotificationServiceImpl. We also define the 
functionality of the two other classes, EmailNotifer and SMSNotifier, through 
another interface, Notifier.

Chapter 10
[ 237 ]
We now have a class diagram, shown in the following figure, in which 
both EmailNotifer and SMSNotifier implement Notifier and 
NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService. The Client 
and NotificationServiceImpl classes use instances of interfaces, instead of the 
concrete implementations. Both the Client and the NotificationServiceImpl 
classes use these instances to interact to the target classes without instantiating them:
<<uses>>
Client
<<uses>>
<<uses>>
<<uses>>
<<uses>>
NotificationService
NotificationServiceImpl
SMSNotifier
EmailNotifier
Notifier
<<implements>>
<<implements>>
<<implements>>
At this time, we still have the option of using either the pull strategy, allowing each 
object to provide its dependencies itself by instantiating them or by looking up 
the container to obtain a prepared one, or the push strategy, letting the container 
create the dependencies and then push them to the dependents. The following code 
implements the traditional pull strategy.
The Notifier interface remains unchanged as follows:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public interface Notifier {
  public void notify(String text) throws NotifyException;
}
The EmailNotifier implements Notifier as follows:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class EmailNotifier implements Notifier {
  public void notify(String text) throws NotifyException {
    //sending text as an email to the administrator
  }
}

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 238 ]
The SMSNotifier class is similar to EmailNotifier, as follows:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class SMSNotifier implements Notifier{
  public void notify(String text) throws NotifyException {
    //sending text as a SMS
  }
}
The NotificationService outlines the service class, as shown in the following code:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public interface NotificationService {
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException;
}
And NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService as follows:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  Notifier notifier = new EmailNotifier();
  boolean retryOnFail = true;
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    try {
      notifier.notify(message);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
      if(retryOnFail) {
        //notifying again
        notify(message);
      } else {
        throw new ServiceException(e);
      }
    }
  }
}
We can now apply IoC to our class diagram. In practice, there are different types 
of IoC:
Setter injection: The IoC container uses the dependents' JavaBean setter 
methods to provide dependencies for them.
Constructor injection: The IoC container uses constructor parameters to 
provide dependencies.
Method injection: The IoC container implements an abstract method in the 
dependents at runtime to provide dependencies for them.
•

Chapter 10
[ 239 ]
The next sections discuss the different types of IoC and how they are implemented 
in Spring.
Setter injection
Setter injection is the most common type of IoC, in which the container injects 
dependencies through the dependent objects' JavaBean setter methods. In this 
approach, the implementation class only uses instances of interfaces, without directly 
instantiating the concrete classes. The dependents must contain JavaBean setter 
methods for their dependencies, by which the container can inject the appropriate 
implementation object. Note that no interfaces change. The following code shows the 
setter-based, IoC-style code for the NotificationServiceImpl class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  Notifier notifier;
  boolean retryOnFail;
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    try{
      notifier.notify(message);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
      if(retryOnFail) {
        //notifying again
        notify(message);
      } else {
        throw new ServiceException(e);
      }
    }
  }
  public void setNotifier(Notifier notifier) {
    this.notifier = notifier;
  }
  public void setRetryOnFail(boolean retryOnFail) {
    this.retryOnFail = retryOnFail;
  }
}
Next, we need to configure object dependencies through the IoC configuration file. 
This file can be either an XML or a properties file.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 240 ]
The following code shows the XML configuration for our example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
             spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
        NotificationServiceImpl">
    <property name="notifier">
      <ref local="notifier"/>
    </property>
    <property name="retryOnFail">
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>
The <bean> elements describe objects managed by the IoC container. Each <bean> 
element takes two attributes, id and class, referring to the name by which that 
object is identified and the concrete class of the object, respectively. In our example, 
we have used two <bean> elements: one for the notification service and another 
one for the notifier. For notificationServiceImpl, we used a nested <property> 
element to determine that the notifier property of this object should be set to an 
instance of the notifier bean, which is defined through another <bean> element. 
Note that we used the <ref> element to refer to another object, notifier, defined 
elsewhere in the XML configuration file. This definition expresses that Spring 
should instantiate the NotificationServiceImpl class when necessary, and 
wire it together with an instance of the EmailNotifier.
At this point, we need to start up the container to obtain the desired objects. The 
IoC container in Spring is called a bean factory. Spring provides different bean 
factories, all as an implementation of org.springframework.beans.factory.
BeanFactory, or any extensions of this interface. Generally, a bean factory creates 
objects, wires the objects together, and manages the objects' life cycles. To start 
up the container, you need to create and configure an object of an appropriate 
bean factory. In our case, we'll use org.springframework.context.support.
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext, a subinterface of BeanFactory, which 
reads object configurations in XML format from the classpath. 

Chapter 10
[ 241 ]
Now, to use an IoC-managed object, you only need to start up the container and 
obtain the object as follows:
try {
  ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                       "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch10/beans.xml");
  NotificationService ns = 
      (NotificationService)ctx.getBean("notificationService");
  ns.notify("A message indicating a fatal error inside the system...");
} catch(ServiceException e) {
  //handling exception
}
The ClassPathXmlApplicationContext class takes the path of the beans.xml file in 
the application classpath. To obtain a configured object from the IoC container, you 
need to call the getBean() method of ClassPathXmlApplicationContext with the 
object identifier, which we have already defined through the <bean> element, as this 
method's argument.
Now, the object of NotificationService is created, configured, and managed by 
the IoC container. All object dependencies have been defined in terms of interfaces. 
No object is aware of the actual implementation of its dependencies. The client 
code does not care about the implementation details of NotificationService, 
nor does NotificationServiceImpl know about the implementation details 
of Notifier. This isolates the client code from the implementation details of 
NotificationService, and NotificationServiceImpl from the implementation 
details of Notifier. It consequently lets us switch the implementation of each object 
to any other implementation, without making any changes in the application code, 
merely by changing the XML configuration file.
Constructor injection
Constructor injection, another type of IoC, is used less frequently than setter 
injection. In this technique, dependencies are supplied to an object through that 
object's constructor. The following code shows the NotificationServiceImpl class, 
which has changed to use constructor injection instead of setter injection:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  Notifier notifier ;
  boolean retryOnFail;
  public NotificationService(Notifier notifier,
                             boolean retryOnFail) {
    this.notifier= notifier;

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 242 ]
    this.retryOnFail = retryOnFail;
  }
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    try {
      notifier.notify(message);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
       if(retryOnFail) {
         //notifying again
         notify(message);
       } else {
         throw new ServiceException(e);
       }
    }
  }
}
As with setter injection, no interface has changed.
As you can see, we have replaced the setter method with a constructor in the 
NotificationServiceImpl class, which takes two arguments of Notifier and 
boolean, respectively. After that, the application context configuration needs to be 
modified so that an object of Notifier and a boolean value for retryOnFail are 
used as an argument of the NotificationServiceImpl constructor, as shown in the 
following code:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-
2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
NotificationServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg>
      <ref local="notifier"/>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg>
      <value>true</value>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>

Chapter 10
[ 243 ]
The Client class that uses notificationServiceImpl remains unchanged:
try {
  ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                      "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch10/beans.xml");
  NotificationService ns = 
      (NotificationService)ctx.getBean("notificationService"); 
  ns.notify("A message indicating a fatal error inside the system...");
} catch(ServiceException e) {
  //handle exception
}
It is highly recommended that you use the <constructor-arg> element with either 
the index or the type attribute. When you don't use these attributes, Spring finds 
a matching bean for each argument based on the type of that argument. Therefore, 
when there are some arguments with the same type, or when there are arguments with 
values specified with string literals that are converted automatically by Spring, failure 
to use these attributes results in ambiguity about which argument you intend. Using 
these attributes can avoid mistakes in the development and maintenance phases.
For example, suppose that the NotificationServiceImpl class uses an extra 
property called prefixMessage. As with notifier and retryOnFail, the 
prefixMessage property is set through the IoC container. The following code 
shows the modified NotificationServiceImpl class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  Notifier notifier ; 
  String prefixMessage;
  boolean retryOnFail;
  public NotificationServiceImpl(Notifier notifier,
                             String prefixMessage,
                             boolean retryOnFail) {
    this.notifier= notifier;
    this.prefixMessage = prefixMessage;
    this.retryOnFail = retryOnFail;
  }
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    String message2Send = prefixMessage +" "+ message;
    try {
      notifier.notify(message2Send);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
      if(retryOnFail) {
        //notifying again
        notify(message2Send);
      } else {

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 244 ]
        throw new ServiceException(e);
      }
    }
  }
}
If we use constructor injection for this property, and the <value> tag to supply the 
value for its argument, Spring may not distinguish the prefixMessage value from 
the retryOnFail value because both prefixMessage and retryOnFail values are 
expressed through string literals. You must use either the type or the index attribute 
to give Spring accurate information about the argument type or order, respectively. 
For our example, the bean definitions are as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
             spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
               NotificationServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg index="0">
      <ref local="notifier"/>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg index="1">
      <value>under-test</value>
    </constructor-arg>
    <constructor-arg index="2">
      <value>true</value>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>
Here, the index attribute determines that the notifier, prefixMessage, and 
retryOnFail are the first, second, and third arguments, respectively, of the class 
constructor. As you can see, the index starts from 0. Therefore, the first argument in 
the argument list, notifier in this case, is specified with index="0". Alternatively, 
we can use the type attribute to specify the type of each constructor argument, and 
let Spring pass the value to the proper constructor argument based on its type:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

</beans>
If you are developing from scratch, there is actually no difference between 
setter injection and constructor injection. However, when you are using 
existing classes, your choice depends on the classes that IoC is applied 
to. In simple words, you need to use setter injection for classes that have 
no-argument constructors with simple javabean properties, and you need 
to use constructor injection for classes that are completely initialized 
through their constructors. For classes that are initialized with the 
combination of constructors and setter methods, you need to use 
mixed approaches.
Method injection
Method injection is another type of dependency injection. With method injection, 
instead of defining a property dependency to be set by the container, we define an 
abstract method which the container implements at runtime. This abstract method 
returns an implementation of the dependency object. Therefore, the dependent class 
can use the abstract method to access the appropriate implementation object on the 
assumption that the container will implement the method at runtime.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 246 ]
When our example uses method injection to provide a Notifier implementation 
for the NotificationServiceImpl, the injection is done through an abstract 
getNotifier() method and allows the NotificationServiceImpl use this 
method to access the Notifier implementation. The configuration file changes 
accordingly to indicate that the container should override the method and provide 
an appropriate implementation object as the method return value. The following 
code shows the NotificationServiceImpl class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
public abstract class NotificationServiceImpl implements 
NotificationService {
  public abstract Notifier getNotifier();
  boolean retryOnFail;
  public void notify(String message) throws ServiceException {
    try {
      getNotifier().notify(message);
    } catch(NotifyException e) {
      if(retryOnFail) {
        //notifying again
        notify(message);
      } else {
        throw new ServiceException(e);
      }
    }
  }
  public void setRetryOnFail(boolean retryOnFail) {
    this.retryOnFail = retryOnFail;
  }
}
The getNotifier() method can be moved in the NotificationService interface. 
However, I intentionally put it in this class to teach you how you can let Spring to 
override an abstract method at runtime, regardless of whether the class implements 
an interface or not.
Here is the beans.xml configuration file which uses the injection approach:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
             spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
               NotificationServiceImpl">
    <lookup-method name="getNotifier" bean="notifier"/>
    <property name="retryOnFail">

Chapter 10
[ 247 ]
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>
As you can see, a <lookup-method> element configures the notifier property to set 
the method injection. This element uses two attributes, name and bean, which refer, 
respectively, to the name of the abstract method and to the name of the property 
that is initialized with method injection. In this example, the notifier property is 
initialized through method injection, while retryOnFail is still set through setter 
injection. Although it is possible to use method injection for retryOnFail, I have 
done it this way because the retryOnFail property has a simple type and the 
application only needs its value. No implementation is defined for this property. 
The client remains unchanged.
Now that we've seen the different approaches to dependency injection, let's look 
at object configuration details, exploring how Spring provides us flexibility in 
configuring and initializing the objects, as well as in wiring them together.
Bean configuration
Bean configuration is at the heart of any Spring-based application. You may 
configure Spring either programmatically (through application code), or 
declaratively (through XML or properties files), as you will see later in this chapter. 
We will focus on the XML approach, because other approaches are neither as flexible, 
nor as powerful as using XML. The XML and properties files used as bean definitions 
in the Spring IoC container are called the Spring application context, or just the 
Spring context.
You have already seen some XML configuration files in the examples. Here, we'll dig 
a bit deeper into XML bean definitions.
Spring XML configuration is started with the <beans> element as the root:
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
           http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-
2.5.xsd">
</beans>

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 248 ]
The <beans> element introduces spring-beans-2.5.xsd, as the XML schema for 
validation of the Spring bean configuration file.
Support for DTD-based configuration
The Spring framework version 1.x uses DTD for validation of the Spring 
application context. Therefore, if you are working in Spring 1.x, you need 
to configure the Spring context with the DOCTYPE declaration and the 
<beans> element as follows:
   <!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC "-//SPRING//DTD BEAN 2.0//EN"
        "http://www.springframework.org/dtd/
              spring-beans-2.0.dtd">
 <beans>
 </beans>
Spring 2.x supports schema-based configuration, along with the classic 
DTD-configuration approach. This means you can still use DTD with 
Spring 2.x. However, you should use the schema variant to simplify the 
configuration file and to use new features provided by Spring.
Any bean is defined with a <bean> element inside <beans>. Each <bean> element 
includes all of the information the container needs to configure an object in an IoC 
style, manage the object life cycle, and provide the object dependencies.
The <bean> element almost always comes with two attributes: id and class. The 
id attribute assigns an arbitrary, unique name to the bean, by which the container 
and other beans can refer to it. The class attribute determines the type of the bean 
that is instantiated. Here is a sample bean definition, which you have already seen in 
previous examples: 
<bean id="notifier" class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
EmailNotifier">
</bean>
In the simplest form, the <bean> element can come with just one 
class attribute. In that form, the bean can only be initialized and 
retrieved by its type.

Chapter 10
[ 249 ]
Alternatively, you may use the name attribute instead of id. The main advantage of 
using name is that you can use more than one ID for the bean, specified as a comma-
separated list. Moreover, the name attribute does not have id naming limitations, 
such as starting with a letter followed by alphanumeric characters with no white 
space. Here is an example:
  <bean name="notifier, emailNotifier"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
In this case, the EmailNotifier object can be referred to as either notifier or 
emailNotifer.
Multiple IDs are useful when the application includes multiple bean definitions. This 
commonly happens when the application consists of multiple modules and each 
module needs its own bean definitions. To make bean definitions more expressive, 
each module may name its beans with a specific prefix. By using multiple IDs for 
shared beans, you can name these beans with more than one name. Each name 
begins with a particular prefix associated with a particular bean definition.
Commonly, the container instantiates beans through their constructors. If the 
constructor takes one or more arguments, use a nested <constructor-arg> 
element to provide the required values for each argument. Here is an example:
  <bean name="notificationService"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
               NotificationServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg>
      <ref local="notifier"/>
    </constructor-arg>
  </bean>
Optionally, you can tell Hibernate to use either a static factory method or a nonstatic 
factory method as an instantiation approach.
You may use a static factory method of a class, instead of the class constructor, to 
instantiate an object. To do so, use the factory-method and class attributes to 
specify the factory method's name and class, respectively:
  <bean name="notifier"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.NotifierFactory"
        factory-method="getNotifierInstance">
  </bean>

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 250 ]
Alternatively, you may use a nonstatic factory method for creating a bean. 
Obviously, the factory method is defined in another bean instance in the container. 
Here is an example:
  <bean name="nonStaticNotifierFactory"...>
  </bean>
  <bean name="notifier, emailNotifier"
        factory-bean="nonStaticNotifierFactory"
        factory-method="getNotifierInstance">
  </bean>
As you can see, we have used the factory-bean attribute to refer to another bean 
instance, including the factory method. Note that we have not specified the type of 
the bean being instantiated in any of the cases so far.
Singleton versus prototype beans
Spring lets objects be configured as either singleton or nonsingleton. An object 
is called a singleton if there is only a single instance of the class throughout the 
application. In Spring, this means multiple invocations of ApplicationContext.
getBean() return the same reference. In contrast, an object can be a nonsingleton 
(also called a prototype) if more than one instance of the class exists in the application. 
This means that multiple invocations of ApplicationContext.getBean() return 
different instances.
By default, all beans in Spring are defined as singletons. To define a bean as a 
prototype, set the singleton attribute to false, as shown here:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-
2.5.xsd">
  <bean name="notifier, emailNotifier" 
        singleton="false"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>
Using a singleton bean is helpful when the creation of more than one instance is 
expensive in terms of time, memory, network bandwidth, or CPU usage. Note that 
if you use the instance in a multithreaded environment, the instance should be 
thread-safe.

Chapter 10
[ 251 ]
Wiring beans
As we've seen, developing an IoC-based application involves defining the objects' 
dependencies in terms of interfaces or abstract classes. The dependencies are then set 
up in the configuration file(s) by specifying the actual implementations. Expressing 
bean dependencies with concrete implementation in the configuration files is called 
bean wiring.
In the previous sections, you learned basic bean configuration using the <bean> 
element. In this section, we will discuss configuration details in more depth. As you 
have seen, each <bean> element assigns a name to an object, indicates which method 
instantiates the object, and determines how to provide object properties.
The <bean> element can contain zero or more <constructor-arg> subelements, 
which define the constructor argument values. The bean may use setter injection, and 
therefore use nested <property> elements. The bean may use a combination of setter 
injection for some properties, and constructor injection for others.
The following example uses constructor injection for the notifier constructor 
argument, and setter injection for the retryOnFail property:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
             spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
               NotificationServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg index="0">
      <ref local="notifier"/>
    </constructor-arg>
    <property name="retryOnFail"><value>true</value></property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier" class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
   EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 252 ]
The <property> and <constructor-arg> elements can contain other elements. 
These elements, including <bean>, <ref>, <idref>, <value>, <null>, <list>, 
<set>, <map>, and <props>, let us provide values for <property> and 
<constructor> in different ways. Note that each <property> or 
<constructor-arg> element can contain a <bean> element that is the same 
as the usual <bean> element. For instance, the recent bean configuration for 
NotificationServiceImpl can be expressed as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
             spring-beans-2.5.xsd">
  <bean id="notificationService"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.
               NotificationServiceImpl">
    <constructor-arg index="0">
      <bean id="notifier"
             class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
      </bean>
    </constructor-arg>
    <property name="retryOnFail"><value>true</value></property>
  </bean>  
</beans>
This type of bean configuration is useful when only the outer bean uses the inner 
bean. No use of the inner bean outside the scope of the outer bean is applicable.
The following sections discuss these elements.
The <ref> element
The <ref> element applies another bean as the value for a property or constructor 
argument. This element has the local, bean, and parent attributes. Here are 
some examples:
<ref local="notifier"/>
<ref bean="notifier"/>
<ref parent="notifier"/>

Chapter 10
[ 253 ]
The local, bean, and parent attributes have these meanings:
local refers to another bean that is defined in the same XML file. Note that 
this attribute can only use the ID (never the name) of the bean to which 
it refers.
bean is similar to local, the only difference being that the bean to which 
it refers can be defined either in another bean definition file or in the same 
definition file.
parent refers to a bean defined in the parent factory. This attribute is 
useful when beans with the same name exist in both the current and the 
parent factory.
The <idref> element
The <idref> element specifies another bean as the value. With this element, an 
exception will be thrown if the container cannot find the specified bean. Here is 
an example:
<property name="beanName"><idref local="notificationService"/>
</property>
The <idref> element can come with local, bean, or parent, with the same 
meanings as for the <ref> element.
The <value> element
The <value> element determines a value for a property or a constructor argument. 
The value is always expressed as a string and is transformed by Spring to the 
appropriate type. For simple values, such as primitive types or their corresponding 
wrapper types, Spring can convert the string literal to the appropriate representation. 
However, for other types, or custom value types, you can implement java.beans.
PropertyEditor and register the implementation with Spring. The implementation 
of PropertyEditor defines how to convert a string literal to the type of target 
property or constructor argument. You can find a number of PropertyEditor 
implementations in the org.springframework.beans.propertyeditors package 
of the Spring distribution.
Here is an example of the <value> element using a primitive boolean type:
<property name="debug">
  <value>true</value>
</property>
<property name="debug" value="true">
•
•
•

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 254 ]
Both of these snippets do the same thing and will set the debug property to true. If 
debug is defined as Boolean, the container automatically converts the string literal 
value "true" to the Boolean or boolean value true.
The <null> element
You can use the <null> element to set a property or constructor argument with 
null, as in this example:
<property name="comment"><null/></property>
Note that if you omit the <null/> element, an empty string will be set instead 
of null.
The <list>, <set>, <map>, and <props> elements
The <list> element sets a value for a property or constructor argument of type 
java.util.List, java.util.Set, or array. The <set> element is similar to <list>, 
but does not accept duplicate values. The <map> and <props> elements set values of 
type java.util.Map and java.util.Properties, respectively. Here is an example:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    <property name="adminEmailMap">

      </props>
    </property>

</beans>
Here, the values of <list>, <map>, and <set> are simple string or numeric values. 
However, any of these elements can be nested with <bean>, <ref>, <idref>, <list>, 
<set>, <map>, <props>, <value>, and <null> elements to hold objects.
Automatic wiring
In the previous section, you learned how to configure objects with their 
dependencies inside the bean configuration file. This way of declaring dependencies 
is called explicit declaration since you manually specify how to configure each object 
using other beans. However, Spring also allows automatic wiring of beans. This 
means you can leave dependencies undeclared in the XML file and let Spring find 
appropriate values for each property or constructor argument.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 256 ]
Autowiring is off by default, so you must enable autowiring before you can use 
it. To do so, set the autowire attribute of the <bean> element with one the 
following values:
no: No autowiring is used for the bean. All dependencies must be declared 
explicitly if the default autowiring is not changed at the bean factory level.
byName: The bean is autowired by property name. Spring uses property 
names to find matching beans in the factory. For instance, if we use byName 
autowiring for the notifier property in the NotificationServiceImpl 
class, Spring sets this property with a bean named notifier. If no bean with 
that name exists, the property remains unset.
byType: The bean is autowired by property type. Spring finds a matching 
bean for each property based on the type of the property. If Spring does not 
find a matching bean, the property remains unset. If more than one matching 
bean exists, an exception is thrown.
constructor: The bean is autowired by type in its constructor. This means 
that Spring finds a matching bean for each constructor argument. If the bean 
has more than one constructor, the bean is autowired with the constructor 
that has the most matching arguments. 
autodetect: The bean is autowired by constructor if it does not have a 
default no-argument constructor. Otherwise, it is autowired by bytype. 
You can use the dependency-check attribute of the bean definition 
to specify whether Spring should treat unmatched properties as an 
error case. dependency-check="none" indicates no dependency 
checking. dependency-check="simple" determines that dependency 
checking is only performed for primitive types and collections. 
dependency-check="objects" specifies that dependency checking 
is only performed only for properties that are objects, neither primitives 
nor collections. Finally, dependency-check ="all" means that 
dependency checking is done for all dependencies, including primitive 
types, collections, and associated objects.
You can mix autowiring and explicit wiring. Therefore, you can declare a bean as 
autowired while some properties or constructor arguments are wired explicitly. 
In this case, Spring first wires the properties or constructor arguments, declared 
explicitly and then autowires others. 
If you don't use it carefully, autowiring may have unexpected results. 
With autowiring, you must always check dependencies in your mind, 
instead of hard-coding them, and track the dependency relationships. Do 
not use autowiring for large deployments.

  <bean id="notificationService" 
        autowire="byType"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.NotificationService">
    <!-- notifier is not wired explicitly -->
    <property name="retryOnFail">
      <value>true</value>
    </property>
  </bean>
  <bean id="notifier"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.EmailNotifier">
  </bean>
</beans>
This example removes explicit wiring of the notifier property, and instead inserts 
autowire="byType" in the bean definition. 
Annotation-based container configuration
Spring allows bean configuration with annotations. Spring 2.0 enabled bean 
configuration with the @Required annotation. Spring 2.5 provides some additional  
annotations, including @Autowired, @Resource, @PostConstruct, @PreDestroy. To 
enable annotation-based configuration, you need to add the <context:annotation-
config> element in your bean configuration file, as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
     http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/
          spring-context-3.0.xsd">
               
     <context:annotation-config/>
     
</beans>
Let's look at the annotations used for bean configuration.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 258 ]
@Required
The @Required annotation is applied to a bean property setter method to indicate 
that the related property must be populated at configuration time. Otherwise, it 
should be treated as an error. The property can then be valued explicitly through 
the bean definition or by autowiring.
Here is an example:
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  private Notifier notifier;
  @Required
  public void setNotifier(Notifier notifier) {
    this.notifier = notifier;
  }
}
As you can see, the @Required annotation is applied to the setNotifier() method. 
Therefore, the notifier property is a mandatory property that must be initialized 
for the NotificationService object.
@Autowired
The @Autowired annotation can be put on any setter method, class property method, 
or even constructor with any arguments. This annotation can be used with the 
required property to indicate whether that property is required for autowiring 
purposes or not. This is an example:
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService{
  private Notifier notifier;
  @Autowired(required=false)
  public void setNotifier(Notifier notifier) {
    this.notifier = notifier;
  }
}
Although there is no limitation on the number of annotated constructors in each 
class, only one annotated constructor can be marked as required. 

Chapter 10
[ 259 ]
@Resource
It is also possible to use JSR-250 @Resource annotation to mark a field or a setter 
method. The @Resource annotation uses an optional name attribute which is the 
name of the object to inject. If this attribute is not specified, Spring uses the name 
of the bean property as the value for this attribute. Here is an example:
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  private Notifier notifier;
  @Resource(name="myNotifier")
  public void setNotifier(Notifier notifier) {
    this.notifier = notifier;
  }
}
By this code, Spring injects the Notifier object whose name in the Spring context is 
myNotifier to the NotificationService object. If the name attribute is not specified, 
Spring injects the bean named notifier to the NotificationService object. 
Classpath scanning for annotated classes
Spring provides stereotype annotations to mark classes as a specific managed bean in 
its context. These annotations are as follows:
@Component: It is the basic annotation type to mark a class as a Spring bean.
@Controller: It is used to mark a class as a controller in the Spring MVC.
@Repository: It marks a class as a repository, such as a Data Access Object.
@Service: This annotation indicates that the annotated class is a part of the 
business logic of the application.
All of these annotations make the annotated class a managed bean in the Spring 
context. The following shows the NotificationService class which is now 
annotated with @Component:
@Component
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService {
  private Notifier notifier;
  @Autowired
  public void setNotifier(Notifier notifier) {
    this.notifier = notifier;
  }
}
•
•
•
•

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 260 ]
When a class is annotated with a stereotype annotation, Spring uses the 
uncapitalized non-qualified class name as the bean name for that object. Therefore, 
for the annotated class above, Spring uses the name notificationService. It is 
also possible to override this default behavior with a name through the stereotype 
annotation like as this:
@Component("myNotificationService")
public class NotificationServiceImpl implements NotificationService{
…
}
Therefore, Spring uses myNotificationService as the name for the 
NotificationService bean.
To Enable Spring to auto-detect the annotated classes, you need to use the 
<context:component-scan> element inside the configuration file to introduce 
the base package in which Spring should look for annotated classes. The following 
shows how it should be done:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
       xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.5.xsd
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/context/spring-context-
2.5.xsd">
               
     <context:component-scan base-package="com.packtpub"/>
</beans>
You can use a comma separated list of packages as the value of the 
base-package attribute, if the annotated classes are located in 
different packages.
Other format forms for bean definition
You can use the properties file format as an alternative to the XML format for bean 
configuration. However, the properties file format doesn't support a number of 
container capabilities that are expressed easily through the XML format, such as 
constructor injection, method injection, nested beans, and so on.

Chapter 10
[ 261 ]
You can also configure the IoC container programmatically. In this book, we are not 
interested in the programmatic approach, because it removes the flexibility from the 
code, and increases maintenance costs.
BeanFactory and ApplicationContext
Spring provides a variety of bean factory implementations to support a range 
of different situations, each having different IoC requirements. All bean 
factories are implementations of org.springframework.beans.factory.
BeanFactory, or any of its subinterfaces. Some of the most significant of 
these are BeanFactory, HierarchicalBeanFactory, ListableBeanFactory, 
AutowireCapableBeanFactory, and ConfigurableBeanFactory.
Additionally, Spring provides ApplicationContext as a specific type of bean 
factory with some advanced functionality. The ApplicationContext interface 
extends the BeanFactory interface, so it does everything a bean factory can do. 
However, application context has additional functionalities such as these:
Application context lets us work with the IoC container in a completely 
declarative fashion. (We refer to both the ApplicationContext object, and 
the bean definition file, as the application context.) Furthermore, Spring 
provides some utility classes which let us add IoC capability to the web layer, 
and allows automatic loading of application contexts in web frameworks. Of 
course, the aim of this is to add IoC functionality to the framework, instead 
of the user's code.
Application context extends the MessageResource interface, so it provides 
messaging functionality.
Application context supports an event-handling model. It can notify 
beans that implement the ApplicationListener interface when an 
ApplicationEvent gets published to the ApplicationContext.
Application context is a resource loader because it extends the 
ResourcePatternResolver interface. This means that ApplicationContext 
can load any resources from almost any location in a transparent fashion, 
including from the classpath, a file system location, or anywhere that can be 
described with a standard URL, and other variations.
In practical applications, ApplicationContext is always 
used instead of BeanFactory.

Let's look at the different bean factories available to us:
BeanFactory: This is the basic interface that defines the general behaviors 
of all bean factories. This interface defines various getBean() methods for 
obtaining beans from the container. It also includes some extra methods, 
such as containsBean(), isSingleton(), and getType(), which allow us 
to query the bean definition in application code. 
HierarchicalBeanFactory: This bean factory provides a factory for 
hierarchical bean definitions. When a factory is queried for a bean, and 
does not have the requested bean, its parent factory is asked for that bean. 
The parent may also ask its own parent when it does not have the bean, 
and so on. This factory is useful when the application has a number of bean 
definitions. If each bean definition has its own beans, and uses some general 
beans of others, you must create a hierarchical bean factory, in which the 
general beans are defined in the parent factory or factories. Note that the 
entire process of bean exploring is transparent for all clients, so you can treat 
this factory the same as other bean factories. The HierarchicalBeanFactory 
interface defines only two methods: getParentBeanFactory() returns the 
current factory's parent factory, and containsLocalBean() determines 
whether or not the current factory contains a particular bean.
ListableBeanFactory: This bean factory allows us to query the beans. This 
factory provides getBeanDefinitionNames() to get the names of all beans, 
getBeanNamesForType(Class class) to get the names of all beans of a 
certain type, getBeanDefinitionCount() to get the number of all beans, 
containsBeanDefinition(String beanName) to check whether any beans 
with a particular name exist, and getBeansOfType(Class aClass) to obtain 
all beans of a certain type in a java.util.Map object. 
AutowireCapableBeanFactory: This bean factory is capable of autowiring 
for existing bean instances. When you are extending an existing application 
that does not rely on Spring for object instantiations, or when you are using 
third-party code that uses its own mechanism for instantiating objects, 
you can use this factory if you want Spring to provide dependencies and 
wire the objects together. The main method of this factory is autowire(), 
which lets you specify a class name to the factory and get a fully configured 
object. Two other significant methods are autowireBeanProperties() 
and applyBeanPropertyValues(), which let you configure a preexisting 
external object and supply its dependencies using Spring 3.

Chapter 10
[ 263 ]
Although Spring allows us to configure the IoC container either 
programmatically, through its rich API, or declaratively, through different 
configuration formats, this book discusses only declarative bean factories 
and application contexts with XML as the configuration format.
Now that we've seen the various bean factories, let's look at the different application 
contexts available in Spring:
ApplicationContext: This interface is the basic application context. 
It extends BeanFactory and defines the basic functionality for all 
application contexts. 
WebApplicationContext: This subinterface of ApplicationContext defines 
an extra getServletContext() method, and provides IoC ability in web 
applications. I will discuss this application context in Chapter 14. 
FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: This implementation of the 
ConfigurableApplicationContext interface allows us to work with XML 
configuration files represented as plain string paths to the file system or 
URLs. This can be used in stand-alone applications or for testing purposes. 
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: This general-purpose application 
context may be used in any environment and condition. It allows us to 
configure the container through an XML file in the classpath. The path 
is expressed as a plain string relative to the root of the classpath and is 
separated by a forward slash (/) instead of a dot (.).
Applying IoC to Hibernate resources
Hibernate applications may use either container-managed or application-managed 
connections behind the scenes. We can use IoC in a Hibernate application and 
configure a data source as a bean. IoC lets us manage the data source transparently 
and declaratively. Therefore, we can look up the container to obtain the 
SessionFactory object initialized with a configured data-source object. 
We can assume that SessionFactory is a singleton bean in the Spring IoC container. 
However, configuring a SessionFactory as a bean is not effortless as it has many 
properties and a complex structure. For this and similar cases, Spring provides a 
specific type of bean called a factory bean.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 264 ]
A factory bean is a bean inside the IoC container that produces other objects. Note 
that a factory bean is different from a bean factory. Bean factories are the Spring 
containers that instantiate and manage beans, whereas factory beans are normal 
beans managed by a bean factory. However, when a factory bean is referred to 
by another bean in the container, or by application code by using the getBean() 
method, the container does not return an instance of the factory bean. Instead, it 
returns an object that the factory bean produces. 
You can easily define a factory bean by implementing the org.springframework.
beans.factory.FactoryBean interface: 
public interface FactoryBean {
  Object getObject() throws Exception;
  Class getObjectType();
  boolean isSingleton();
}
The getObject()method returns the output object of the factory. The container 
automatically calls it when the factory bean is accessed. The isSingleton() 
flag determines whether the returned object is a singleton or not. Finally, the 
getObjectType() method determines the type of the output object (null if this 
is not known). 
Let's look at an example to see how a FactoryBean is implemented and used. 
Suppose that we need to obtain a distinct java.sql.Connection object whenever 
the container is looked up by the connection name, as follows:
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                      "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch10/beans.xml");
Connection connection = (Connection)ctx.getBean("connection"); 
Because java.sql.Connection cannot easily be configured in the bean 
definition, we may decide to implement a BeanFactory class and use it as 
a factory for Connection objects in the Spring context. The following code 
shows this implementation:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.FactoryBean;
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.util.Properties;
public class ConnectionFactoryBean implements FactoryBean {
  String url;
  String driver;
  String username;

Chapter 10
[ 265 ]
  String password;
  Properties props;
  public Object getObject() throws Exception {
    if(props == null) {
      props = new Properties();
    }
    if(username != null) {
      props.setProperty("username", username);
    }
    if(password != null) {
      props.setProperty("password", password);
    }
    validateUrl();
    validateDriver();
    Class.forName(driver);
    return DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);
  }
  public Class getObjectType() {
    return Connection.class;
  }
  public boolean isSingleton() {
    return false;
  }
  private void validateUrl() throws Exception {
    if ((url == null) || (url.equals(""))) {
      url= props.getProperty("url");
    }
    if(url == null) {
      throw new Exception("Database URL is not configured or is 
invalid");
    }
  }
  private void validateDriver() throws Exception {
    if ((driver == null) || (driver.equals(""))) {
      driver= props.getProperty("driver");
    }
    if(driver == null) {
      throw new Exception("Database Driver is not configured or is 
invalid");
    }
  }
  public void setUrl(String url) {

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 266 ]
    this.url = url;
  }
  public void setDriver(String driver) {
    this.driver = driver;
  }
  public void setUsername(String username) {
    this.username = username;
  }
  public void setPassword(String password) {
    this.password = password;
  }
  public void setProps(Properties props) {
    this.props = props;
  }
}
This class has five properties that are set through setter injections. These 
properties determine the database URL, the driver's class name, username, 
password, and optional JDBC properties for the database connection. To use 
ConnectionFactoryBean, you need to configure it in the Spring context as follows:
<bean id="connection" 
      class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10.ConnectionFactoryBean">
  <property name="username" value="sa"/>
  <property name="password" value=""/>
  <property name="driver" value="org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"/>
  <property name="url" value="jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb"/>
  <property name="props">
  <value>
    defaultRowPrefetch=15
  </value>
  </property>
</bean>
Note that this example would not be used in a real application, because in practice, 
there are better approaches to obtain the Connection object, such as looking up an 
application server.
Although you can implement a factory bean whenever you need to, Spring includes 
some useful factory beans for common resources and services. The following table 
shows some of these factories:

Chapter 10
[ 267 ]
Factory Bean
Description
JndiObjectFactoryBean
Returns the result object of a JNDI lookup.
ProxyFactoryBean
Returns a proxy object. A proxy is an object that 
wraps an existing object and provides added 
functionality for the wrapped object. Chapter 11 
discusses proxies in detail.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean
Returns a transactional proxy for persisting objects, 
such as Data Access Object (DAO) classes. I have 
discussed TransactionProxyFactoryBean in 
Chapter 11 and Chapter 12.
LocalSessionFactoryBean
Returns a configured Hibernate 
SessionFactory object that may be used in 
DAO classes.
PropertyEditors
PropertyEditor defines how to convert a string literal that is defined as a value for 
a property, or constructor argument in the bean definition files, to the target type. 
Spring can convert simple primitive values (such as int, long, and boolean) and 
their corresponding wrapper types (such as Integer, Long, and Boolean) from the 
string form to the target primitive type. Additionally, Spring uses a number of built-
in PropertyEditor, allowing some extra types to be converted. The following table 
shows these built-in PropertyEditor and the target type to which each converts the 
string literal. All of these PropertyEditor are located in the org.springframework.
beans.propertyeditor package: 
Built-in PropertyEditor
Description
ClassEditor
Converts a string literal that represents a class to 
an object of java.lang.Class. If the class is not 
found, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
FileEditor
Converts a string literal that represents a file to an 
object of java.io.File.
LocaleEditor
Generates a java.util.Locale from a string 
literal expressed as [language]_[country]_
[variant].
PropertiesEditor
Converts strings expressed as the key and value 
pairs (key=value) to an object of java.util.
Properties.
StringArrayPropertyEditor
Converts a comma-delimited list of strings to an 
array of String.
URLEditor
Resolves a string representation of a URL to an object 
of java.net.URL.

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 268 ]
Let's look at a simple example to see how Spring uses these PropertyEditor. 
Suppose the application uses a ConfigurationBean class, shown in the 
following code:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch10;
import java.io.File;
import java.net.URL;
import java.util.Locale;
import java.util.Properties;
public class ConfigurationBean{
  private int intValue;
  private boolean booleanValue;
  private String[] stringArray;
  private Class clazz;
  private File file;
  private Properties props;
  private Locale locale;
  private URL url;
  public int getIntValue() {
    return intValue;
  }
  public void setIntValue(int intValue) {
    this.intValue = intValue;
  }
  public boolean isBooleanValue() {
    return booleanValue;
  }
  public void setBooleanValue(boolean booleanValue) {
    this.booleanValue = booleanValue;
  }
  public String[] getStringArray() {
    return stringArray;
  }
  public void setStringArray(String[] stringArray) {
    this.stringArray = stringArray;
  }
  public Class getClazz() {
    return clazz;
  }
  public void setClazz(Class clazz) {
    this.clazz = clazz;
  }
  public File getFile() {
    return file;
  }
  public void setFile(File file) {
    this.file = file;

Chapter 10
[ 269 ]
  }
  public Properties getProps() {
    return props;
  }
  public void setProps(Properties props) {
    this.props = props;
  }
  public Locale getLocale() {
    return locale;
  }
  public void setLocale(Locale locale) {
    this.locale = locale;
  }
  public URL getUrl() {
    return url;
  }
  public void setUrl(URL url) {
    this.url = url;
  }
}
The following code shows how an object of this class can be configured as a bean in 
the Spring bean definition file:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"

    </property>
  </bean>
</beans>

Inversion of Control with Spring
[ 270 ]
When the client obtains the bean, the container automatically converts literal strings 
to the proper types. 
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about Inversion of Control (IoC) and dependency 
injection. Inversion of Control, a concept based on Java language constructs, allows 
us to define object dependencies in terms of interfaces or abstract classes, and lets an 
outside object, the IoC container, instantiate them from concrete classes. 
We saw how the Spring IoC container can be used to develop IoC-style code. First, 
you must define all object dependencies of interfaces or abstract classes. Then, you 
must configure bean definitions to tell the container which dependency of which 
concrete class should be instantiated. Finally, you must start up the IoC container 
and obtain configured objects by their names. 
In Spring, bean definitions can be in XML or properties files. In this chapter, we 
discussed the XML variant only, because it's the most widely used format for bean 
definitions. Each XML bean definition starts with an XML declaration, followed by 
a <beans> element as its root. The <beans> element introduces the schema version 
that Spring uses for validation of the bean definition file. All beans are declared 
through <bean> elements inside <beans>. Any <bean> can come with two attributes: 
id and class. The id assigns an identifier to the bean, by which it is referred to 
along the bean definition or in the application code. The class specifies the class of 
which the object is instantiated. The <bean> element can nest with <property> and 
<constructor-arg> elements, which determine IoC injection values for the object 
properties or constructor arguments, respectively. 
We also learned how to create the SessionFactory object in IoC-style code. To do 
this, we used LocalSessionFactoryBean as the factory bean, which is configured 
in the same way as any normal bean in the Spring IoC container. Accessing it always 
returns an object of SessionFactory. 
Finally, we looked at PropertyEditors, which define how Spring converts a 
property value expressed as a string literal to a Java object.

Spring AOP
Today, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a common development 
methodology for almost all software applications. With OOP, the application 
comprises a collection of classes and interfaces. OOP indicates that classes have clear, 
simple, and distinct definitions and responsibilities. Minimizing the interdependency 
of classes makes it easier to create, test, and maintain the application. To achieve 
this, you should break the application into smaller and smaller meaningful, simple, 
and well encapsulated classes. However, the nature of OOP means that this is not 
always possible. Sometimes, it is difficult, or even impossible, to express logic in an 
encapsulated class. In such situations, developers must mix the logic with functions 
and responsibilities of other classes.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a new methodology which offers software 
developers clean separation of concerns. When you use AOP, the application is 
organized by clean, simple, well encapsulated classes without interference from 
other classes' functions.
AOP does not compete with OOP. Instead, it complements OOP 
where OOP cannot perform its role perfectly.
This chapter has four sections:
Introduction to AOP: This section provides an overview of what AOP is, 
what it offers us, and how it is organized. This section discusses how AOP 
solves the problems associated with OOP.
Using Spring AOP with Spring IoC: An example: This section uses a simple 
example to demonstrate how, in practice, AOP concepts are implemented 
with Spring AOP.

Spring AOP
[ 272 ]
Spring's AOP Framework: This section delves into the implementation 
details of Spring AOP. This section explains different aspects of Spring AOP 
that you can use to implement simple, flexible, and powerful AOP.
Moving to Spring 2.x's AOP: This section offers insight into new AOP 
features introduced by Spring 2.x. This section explains how AOP 
components are easily declared in the Spring context through new XML 
elements defined by the AOP schema. 
Introduction to AOP
Before discussing AOP, I want to introduce a new term: concern. A concern is 
a function or behavior that the application performs. For example, persistence, 
validation, security checking, and so on are typical concerns. Application 
development is the process of implementing all application concerns.
With OOP, developing a concern means creating a class which fully encapsulates the 
concern's functionality. Each concern that is implemented as a class is instantiated 
and is used by other concerns, which in turn are implemented by other classes. Using 
this approach, the concerns are individual classes, which are easy to debug, refactor, 
document, and support. Unfortunately, this approach is not always appropriate. In 
practice, concerns may be scattered over many other concerns. For example, consider 
the logging concern that is always implemented as glue code in other concerns. To 
implement the logging concern, you need to mix logging code with other application 
code. Relying on OOP, the logging concern cannot be encapsulated in an individual 
class. Logging and similar concerns are called cross-cutting concerns since they are 
logic scattered over other concerns' logic.
Here are some other examples of cross-cutting concerns:
All of the methods with certain names are logged by the application's 
logging mechanism.
All of the persistent methods are invoked inside a transaction.
Exceptions thrown by certain methods are handled similarly.
The application provides customers' statistical information, reporting 
information about different parts of the application.
Only authorized clients can invoke certain methods.

Chapter 11
[ 273 ]
To implement these concerns with OOP, you must change the code to insert the 
concern code. If any of these concerns needs to be updated or removed, you must 
change the other concern's code to update or remove the concern. More importantly, 
a concern is logic that may be applied to many objects, which means you must 
change many methods just to insert or update the same logic. Obviously, this is not 
an effective approach because it does not follow the encapsulation model provided 
by OOP, or provide reusable functionality. As a result, the code is difficult to test 
and maintain.
Although the application concerns can be implemented by the developer 
to be managed by the AOP container, they are almost always ready 
implemented concerns that are only configured to be managed by the 
container. Security and transaction are common cases for concerns.
As you can see, OOP cannot provide a neat, clean solution in such cases. This is 
where AOP comes in. AOP provides a mechanism to fully separate concerns, and 
to describe cross-cutting concerns with individual classes in a way that's similar to 
other ordinary concerns. 
To see how AOP helps us to implement cross-cutting concerns, let's refer back to an 
example from Chapter 3 and see how OOP and AOP handle these concerns.
Implementing cross-cutting concerns 
with OOP
Chapter 3 introduced a simple case to demonstrate Spring IoC. According to 
that case, a nonfunctional requirement indicates that the application records any 
change of an object's properties for auditing purposes. In that example, three 
different recorders were introduced: SetterInfoConsolePrinter for recording 
object modifications in the console, SetterInfoDBPrinter for recording object 
modifications in the database, and SetterInfoLogPrinter for recording object 
modifications in log files. Each of these classes implements a common interface, 
called SetterInfoPrinter, which outlines the recorder behavior.

Spring AOP
[ 274 ]
You change object properties through their setter methods. This means we need to 
track the invocation of objects' setter methods to record object modifications. For this 
purpose, we changed the Student class, as shown in code below, to record object 
modifications in the console, database, or log files:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private SetterInfoPrinter printer; //ideally initialized through 
Spring IoC
    //zero-argument
    public Student() {
    }
    public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this();
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        printer.print("setId", this.id, id);
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        printer.print("setFirstName", this.firstName, firstName);
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }
    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        printer.print("setLastName", this.lastName, lastName);
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    //getter methods
    //hashCode() and equals() methods
    public void setPrinter(SetterInfoPrinter printer) {
        this.printer= printer;
    }
}

Chapter 11
[ 275 ]
The recording requirement is a cross-cutting concern because it is scattered over 
many setter methods. To change the recording strategy, or to remove the recording 
functionality from the code, we need to change all of the classes to update or remove 
the recording functionality. The following figure depicts the OOP approach for 
implementing the recording concern in the Student class:

The OOP approach of implementing a cross-cutting concern has the 
following shortcomings:
Code duplication: We need to add duplicate code to every method. In our 
example, the recording code is put in all of the setter methods.
Testing problems: Testing the final code would be very difficult because 
the cross-cutting concern is not located in one place, where it could be easily 
tested. In our example, we need to test all setter methods one-by-one.
Maintenance difficulty: If the requirements change, we must change the 
code in many places. For example, if a business requirement indicates that 
no exception handling is needed, or that exceptions should be logged instead 
of notifying the administrator, we must change many areas of the code to 
satisfy the new requirement.
Now that you understand what OOP lacks when implementing cross-cutting 
concerns, we are in a position to dig into the details of AOP and see how it 
complements OOP. Before we do that, though, let's go over some AOP terminology.
AOP terminology
As with other methodologies, AOP has a terminology to describe different 
participants in an AOP operation. The following list briefly defines AOP terms:
Advice: Advices implement concerns. An advice is a behavior or reaction 
that is performed at particular points of the application (for example, the 
recording functionality mentioned in the previous section). Spring supports 
five different types of advice: 
Advice executed around method execution, both before and 
after method invocation.
Advice performed before method invocation.

Spring AOP
[ 276 ]
Advice performed after method invocation when the method 
normally returns.
Advice executed after method invocation when the method 
throws an exception and returns abnormally.
Advice executed after method invocation. Either the method 
returns normally or it throws an exception and returns 
abnormally. (This is only supported by Spring 2.x.)
Joinpoints: These are the points in the application where the advice is 
invoked. Joinpoints are where we insert the cross-cutting logic provided by 
an advice (setter methods in the previous example). Typical joinpoints are 
a call to a method, the method invocation itself, class initialization, and 
object instantiation.
Pointcuts: Any pointcut can be considered a collection of joinpoints. 
Pointcuts allow us to group joinpoints, and then apply an advice to them. 
For instance, you can define all methods of a particular class as a pointcut.
Advisors and interceptors: These objects are responsible for executing advice 
in the pointcuts.
Target or advised object: This is the object that includes the main concern, 
and to which the cross-cutting concern is added (Student objects in 
the example).
Proxy: This is an intermediate object that resides between the calling 
object and the target object. It's responsible for applying a chain of 
advisors or interceptors.
The following figure shows AOP participants and how they relate to the 
AOP framework:

Now that you've seen all of the AOP participants, you may ask what 
the aspect in Aspect-Oriented Programming refers to. As with many 
other AOP terms, this term originates from the old frameworks, such 
as AspectJ, which provide AOP functionality. As you will see later in 
this chapter, this term has come to Spring from release 2.0, when Spring 
provides AspectJ-style AOP implementation.

Let's apply AOP to our recording example. AOP allows us to remove recording code 
from the setter methods, and instead define the recording concern as a distinct class 
to record generally a property modification. We can tell the AOP framework to apply 
the recording concern before a setter method is called. The following figure shows 
the AOP approach to implementing the recording concern:
Client
Spring-AOP
Student

RecordingConcern

The process of AOP development can be summarized as follows:
1. Implement the advice: Remove the cross-cutting concern from the main 
concern and implement it as an individual class.
2.	 Determine pointcuts: Use Spring's built-in pointcuts or implement custom 
pointcuts to select target methods. Note that we do not involve the joinpoint 
objects. Each pointcut object notionally refers to a set of joinpoints with 
common characteristics. For example, a setter pointcut determines all setter 
methods, each of which is a joinpoint.
3.	 Create an advisor: Use Spring's built-in advisors to combine the pointcuts 
and the advice created in the previous steps.
4.	 Create a proxy: Use Spring's built-in classes to create a proxy object. Each 
proxy holds the target object with a set of advisors. The proxy applies the 
advisors, one-by-one, to the target object. The advisor is responsible for 
selecting the target methods of the target object (based on the pointcut) and 
applying the advice. However, each advice can be added directly to the 
proxy instead of the advisor.
Spring lets you use its IoC container and then configure all of the AOP 
objects declaratively in the Spring context. This means only the advice 
implementation is mandatory when you use AOP with Spring IoC.
Next, let's see how these concepts work in practice.

Spring AOP
[ 278 ]
Implementing cross-cutting concerns 
with AOP
To use AOP, we can simply remove the recording concern from the Student class, as 
shown in the code below:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    //zero-argument
    public Student() {
    }
    public Student(String firstName, String lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
    }
    public void setLastName(String lastName) {
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }
    //getter methods
    //hashCode() and equals() methods
}
Then, we must define the recording concern as an advice class, as shown in the 
following code:.
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public class RecordingConcern implements MethodBeforeAdvice {
    private SetterInfoPrinter printer; //ideally initialized with 
Spring IoC

Chapter 11
[ 279 ]
    public void before(Method method, Object[] args, Object target) 
                                                    throws Throwable {
        if((method.getName().startsWith("set"))
                               &&(target.getClass()==Student.class)) {
            String methodName = method.getName();
            Object newValue = args[0];
            Method getter= getterForSetter (Student.class, 
              methodName);
            Object oldValue = getter.invoke(target, args);
            printer.print(methodName, oldValue, newValue);
        }
    }
    public Method getterForSetter(Class clazz, String methodName) {
        try {
        return clazz.getMethod(methodName.replaceFirst("set", "get"));
        } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
            ;
        }
        return null;
    }
    public void setPrinter(SetterInfoPrinter printer){
        this.printer = printer;
    }
}
As you can see, the RecordingConcern class implements the 
org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice interface. This is a Spring 
interface that implements a before advice, called before method invocation. In our 
example, we need to call the recording concern to record the method name, the old 
value, and the new value, so our advice class implements MethodBeforeAdvice. As 
you will see, Spring also provides other types of advice, to be called after method 
invocation, or after an exception is thrown through the method invocation.
You can now apply RecordingConcern to an instance of the Student class through 
Spring AOP. The following code shows a simple class with a static getStudent() 
method. This method, a factory for Student instances that instantiates the Student 
instance, uses the Spring AOP API to apply the RecordingConcern advice to that 
instance, and returns the prepared Student instance:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory;
public class StudentFactory {
    public static Student getStudent() {

Spring AOP
[ 280 ]
        Student std = new Student();
        //create and configure the advice object
        RecordingConcern advice = new RecordingConcern();
        SetterInfoPrinter printer = new SetterInfoConsolePrinter();
        advice.setPrinter(printer);
        //create proxy
        ProxyFactory pf = new ProxyFactory();
        //introduce target & advice to proxy
        pf.addAdvice(advice);
        pf.setTarget(std);
        //use proxy object instead of actual target object
        Student proxy = (Student) pf.getProxy();
        return proxy;
    }
}
If you use this factory class now to obtain Student instances, instead of directly 
instantiating the Student class, the advice is applied to the Student instances. 
Therefore, just replace:
Student student = new Student();
with:
Student student = StudentFactory.getStudent();
Although this works, this approach to AOP implementation is not effortless. In 
practice, Spring IoC and Spring AOP work together to reduce effort and create more 
effective code.
The next section discusses another, more practical example that relates to our sample 
educational system application. The example shows how Spring AOP and Spring 
IoC are integrated to simplify application development, and to produce neat, clean, 
effective code.
Using Spring AOP with Spring IoC: 
An example
In Chapter 10, we wrote a notification service that notifies the system administrator 
whenever a fatal error occurs in the system. Obviously, the notification service is a 
cross-cutting concern because the notification logic is scattered throughout many 
methods in many classes. Implementing the notification logic with OOP involves 
changing the other concerns.

Chapter 11
[ 281 ]
Assume that we have a StudentService class in our application, which performs all 
student-relevant operations, including student registration, profile updating, and so 
on. A requirement of the application indicates that StudentService must notify the 
system administrator after an exception is thrown in the StudentService object.
Let's see how the code looks with OOP, and then explore how this concern can be 
implemented with AOP to overcome OOP's deficiencies.
Implementing the notification concern 
with OOP
Following Spring's best-practice implementations, we need an extra interface, 
StudentServiceInf, which exposes all of the StudentService methods, lets us 
configure StudentService in the IoC container, and implement IoC-style code. This 
StudentService class uses instances of StudentDao and NotificationServiceInf, 
which are provided by the IoC container through setter injection, to perform 
student-related operations and to notify the administrator when an exception is 
thrown, respectively.
The following code shows StudentServiceInf:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import java.util.List;
public interface StudentServiceInf {
    public List getAllStudents() throws ServiceException;
    public Student getStudent(Long stdId) throws ServiceException;
    public Student saveStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException;
    public Student removeStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException;
    public Student updateStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException;
}
And here is the StudentService method as the implementation of 
StudentServiceInf. Note that I have intentionally omitted other business 
methods of the StudentService class to keep the example simple:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException;
public class StudentService implements StudentServiceInf {
    StudentDao studentDao;
    NotificationServiceInf notificationService;
    public List getAllStudents() throws ServiceException {
        try {
            return studentDao.getAllStudents();
        } catch (HibernateException e) {

Spring AOP
[ 282 ]
            notificationService.notify(e.getMessage());
            throw new ServiceException(e);
        }
    }
    public Student getStudent(Long stdId) throws ServiceException {
        try {
            return studentDao.getStudent(stdId);
        } catch (HibernateException e) {
            notificationService.notify(e.getMessage());
            throw new ServiceException(e);
        }
    }
    public Student saveStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException {
        try {
            return studentDao.saveStudent(std);
        } catch (HibernateException e) {
            notificationService.notify(e.getMessage());
            throw new ServiceException(e);
        }
    }
    public Student removeStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException 
{
        try {
            return studentDao.removeStudent(std);
        } catch (HibernateException e) {
           notificationService.notify(e.getMessage());
            throw new ServiceException(e);
        }
    }
    public Student updateStudent(Student std) throws ServiceException 
{
        try {
            return studentDao.updateStudent(std);
        } catch (HibernateException e) {
            notificationService.notify(e.getMessage());
            throw new ServiceException(e);
        }
    }
    //other student-related business methods
    //setter methods for dependency injection
    public void setStudentDao(StudentDao studentDao) {
        this.studentDao = studentDao;
    }
    public void setNotificationService(NotificationServiceInf 
notificationService){
        this.notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}

Chapter 11
[ 283 ]
As you can see in the listings above, interacting with any method of StudentDao 
may throw a HibernateException, which is caught in the StudentService class, 
and then notifies the administrator. The notification process happens by invoking 
the notify() method of the NotificationServiceInf instance with a message 
as an argument. After that, a new ServiceException is thrown, to be propagated 
to the layer above, which uses the service layer. The following code shows the 
ServiceException class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
public class ServiceException extends RuntimeException {
    public ServiceException() {
    }
    public ServiceException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
    public ServiceException(Throwable cause) {
        super(cause);
    }
    public ServiceException(String message, Throwable cause) {
        super(message, cause);
    }
}
ServiceException is a runtime exception, so it may be handled by the calling layer 
or ignored.
We can simply throw a RuntimeException so there will no need 
to implement the ServiceException class. However, it would be 
a good idea to differentiate typical RuntimeExceptions that may 
occur everywhere, and the exceptions which are originated with 
HibernateExceptions.
The code we have written so far mixes two distinct concerns: student-relevant 
operations and administrator notification. All methods have code to handle 
HibernateException in the same way, by notifying the administrator and 
throwing a new ServiceException.
Administrator notification is a cross-cutting concern because this is a distinct 
logic outside of the main responsibility of StudentService and scattered over 
all methods.
Let's refactor our implementation with Spring AOP.

Spring AOP
[ 284 ]
Implementing notification concern with AOP
With AOP, StudentService is modularized into its main responsibility 
(student-related operations) and the notification concern. Two modules then 
can be mixed together by the Spring AOP framework when a StudentService 
method is called.
The following code shows the StudentService class, with the notification concern 
code omitted:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import java.util.List;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
public class StudentService implements StudentServiceInf {
    StudentDao studentDao;
    public List getAllStudents() throws HibernateException {
        return studentDao.getAllStudents();
    }
    public Student getStudent(Long stdId) throws HibernateException{
        return studentDao.getStudent(stdId);
    }
    public Student saveStudent(Student std) throws HibernateException{
        return studentDao.saveStudent(std);
    }
    public Student removeStudent(Student std) throws 
HibernateException{
        return studentDao.removeStudent(std);
    }
    public Student updateStudent(Student std) throws 
HibernateException {
        return studentDao.updateStudent(std);
    }
    //other student-related business methods
    public void setStudentDao(StudentDao studentDao) {
        this.studentDao = studentDao;
    }
    public void setNotificationService(NotificationServiceInf 
notificationService){
        this.notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}

Chapter 11
[ 285 ]
In the following code, the notification concern is implemented as another class, 
NotificationThrowsAdvice, to be called by the Spring AOP framework after a 
HibernateException is thrown:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice;
public class NotificationThrowsAdvice implements ThrowsAdvice {
    NotificationServiceInf notificationService ;//initialized via IoC
    public void afterThrowing(HibernateException ex) throws Throwable 
{
        notificationService.notify(ex.getMessage());
        throw new ServiceException(ex);
    }
    public void setNotificationService(NotificationServiceInf
notificationService){
        this.notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}
As you can see, this class implements the org.springframework.aop.
ThrowsAdvice interface. This interface is just a marker interface, not enforcing to 
implement any method in the implemented class. This interface is a Spring interface 
to implement advice called after a particular exception is thrown in the target objects. 
The NotificationThrowsAdvice class has an afterThrowing() method, which 
takes a HibernateException object as an argument. Spring calls this method after 
a HibernateException is thrown in the target methods. As we will discuss, this 
class can have other afterThrowing() methods to handle exceptions of different 
types. For example, the NotificationThrowsAdvice class may have an additional 
afterThrowing() method with the following signature to handle exceptions of type 
java.io.IOException when they are thrown in the target object:
public void afterThrowing(java.io.IOException ex) throws Throwable {
    notificationService.notify(ex.getMessage());
    throw new ServiceException(ex);
}
Now that the advice has been implemented, it can be applied either programmatically 
or declaratively to the target objects. In the previous code, you saw how an advice can 
be applied programmatically. However, it would be more flexible to use the Spring 
IoC container with Spring AOP to configure and apply the advice to the target object. 
This mechanism lets you apply the advice with minimal Java code, as well you can 
modify or remove the advice or insert another advice without having to change the 
Java code.

Spring AOP
[ 286 ]
Here are the bean definitions for the NotificationService and 
NotificationThrowsAdvice objects in the Spring context:
<bean id="notificationThrowsAdvice"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.
NotificationThrowsAdvice">
    <property name="notificationService">
        <ref local="notificationService"/>
    </property>
</bean>
<bean id="notificationService"
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.NotificationService">
    <property name="notifier">
        <ref local="notifier"/>
    </property>
    <property name="retryOnFail">
        <value>true</value>
    </property>
</bean>
<bean id="notifier" class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.
EmailNotifier">
</bean>
The configured advice can now be applied to any number of objects, including the 
StudentService instance, managed by the Spring container. Here's how you would 
apply the implemented advice to the configured StudentService object:
<bean id="studentServiceTarget"
      class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.StudentService">
  ...
</bean>
<bean id="studentService"
      class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.
BeanNameAutoProxyCreator">
    <property name="beanNames">
        <value>studentServiceTarget</value>
    </property>
    <property name="interceptorNames">
        <list>
            <value>notificationThrowsAdvice</value>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
You can look up the IoC container to use StudentService object as follows:
ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                       "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch11/beans.xml");
StudentServiceInf studentService =
                   (StudentServiceInf)ctx.getBean("studentService");

Chapter 11
[ 287 ]
Note that the bean with the name studentService refers to an object of org.
springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.BeanNameAutoProxyCreator, 
instead of StudentService, which works as a proxy for the StudentService 
instance configured by the IoC container. This proxy is responsible for 
applying all advice specified through the interceptorNames property. The 
BeanNameAutoProxyCreator instance also uses another property with the 
name beanNames, referring to the target objects to which the advice should be 
applied (studentServiceTarget in our example, which refers to the configured 
StudentService object).
You have many options when applying a Spring advice to target objects. However, 
the result will be the same. Don't worry about the details. We will discuss those later 
in this chapter.
In this example, we have not specified the target methods to which 
the advice should be applied. In such cases, the advice is applied to all 
methods of the target object. However, as you will see, Spring lets you 
select the target methods through pointcut objects.
Now that you have sufficient background in AOP implementation, let's explore the 
Spring AOP framework in more detail.
Spring's AOP framework
Spring provides a rich and powerful AOP framework. In this section, we will discuss 
the different kinds of advice Spring provides, how advice can join with a target 
object through joinpoints, and how the joinpoints can be accumulated as pointcuts. 
Finally, we will look at the different proxy generator classes Spring provides.
Advice
The most important part of AOP is advice. An advice defines the custom behavior 
or reaction that is accomplished at joinpoints. Spring wraps a method invocation in 
a chain of interceptors behind the proxy object. Each interceptor is responsible for 
applying an advice.

Spring AOP
[ 288 ]
Spring allows us to use different kinds of advice, and each is useful for a particular 
case. The following table lists these advice types:
Advice Type
Description
Around advice
This type of advice provides an opportunity to implement 
custom code to be executed before or after method invocation. 
This advice is an implementation of the org.aopalliance.
intercept.MethodInterceptor interface. This interface 
does not belong to Spring. Instead, it is part of the AOP 
Alliance API (discussed in this chapter).
Before advice
This type of advice is exposed through the org.
springframework.aop.BeforeAdvice interface. It lets us 
implement an advice to be executed before method invocation.
After returning advice
This type of advice is exposed through the org.
springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice 
interface. It lets us implement an advice to be executed after 
normal execution of the method when no exception is thrown.
Throws advice
This type of advice is exposed through the org.
springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice interface. It lets us 
implement an advice to be executed after abnormal execution 
of the method when an exception is thrown.
Additionally, you can define a custom advice in situations when none of the types 
listed in the table above suits your needs. Let's discuss how each of these advice 
types is implemented and used.
The AOP alliance
The AOP Alliance is an API that includes a small set of interfaces and 
provides a common foundation for different AOP implementations. This 
means different AOP implementations use this API to provide reusability 
for advice or other AOP components. For the most part, Spring defines 
its own kinds of advice based on this API. It allows us to reuse the 
implemented Spring advice with other AOP frameworks that support 
the AOP Alliance API. The most significant interface in this API is org.
aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor, which is used to 
define an advice.
The AOP Alliance libraries are shipped with the Spring distribution. 
You can check out this API's source files at http://aopalliance.
sourceforge.net.

Chapter 11
[ 289 ]
Around advice
The around advice is a basic advice that lets us implement code to be executed 
before, after, or before and after the method invocation. This advice is provided 
by the AOP Alliance API through the MethodInterceptor interface, shown in the 
following code:
package org.aopalliance.intercept;
import org.aopalliance.intercept.Interceptor;
import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;
public interface MethodInterceptor extends Interceptor {
    Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable;
}
This interface includes only one invoke() method, which takes an object of org.
aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation as an argument, and uses Object 
as the return type. The MethodInvocation argument exposes the target method 
being invoked with its arguments and the target joinpoint. The return value of the 
invoke() method represents the result of the target method invocation. To execute 
code before or after method execution, you need to implement custom code before or 
after the MethodInvoation.proceed() call, respectively. The following code shows 
an example of MethodInterceptor implementation, which measures and logs the 
time taken by the target method invocation:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInterceptor;
import org.aopalliance.intercept.MethodInvocation;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class PerformanceInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    private static Logger logger =
             Logger.getLogger(PerformanceInterceptor.class.getName());
    public Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable 
{
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        try {
            Object result = invocation.proceed();
            return result;
        }
        finally {
            long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
            long timeMs = end - start;

Spring AOP
[ 290 ]
            logger.log(Level.INFO, "Method: " +
                       invocation.getMethod().getName() +
                       " took: " + timeMs + "ms.");
        }
    }
}
The call of the proceed() method on the MethodInvocation instance calls the next 
associated interceptor in the chain. If no other interceptor is associated with the 
joinpoint, the joinpoint itself is called. You can also throw an exception if you do not 
want the target method to be called. This mechanism is particularly useful when you 
want to control the client's access to the target method.
Before advice
Spring provides the org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice interface, 
which can be used to implement a method interceptor that is always executed 
before the joinpoint. The following code shows the MethodBeforeAdvice interface, 
extending the generic org.springframework.aop.BeforeAdvice interface used for 
any kind of joinpoint:
package org.springframework.aop;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public interface MethodBeforeAdvice extends BeforeAdvice {
    void before(Method method, Object[] args, Object target) throws 
Throwable;
}
The only before() method in this interface takes three arguments of type java.lang.
reflect.Method, Object[], and Object, representing the target method being 
called, the target method arguments, and the target object, respectively. The return 
type of this method is void, which means this advice does not allow changing of the 
method's return value. However, the before() method throws Throwable exception, 
which lets you throw an exception to break the interceptor chain.
The following code shows a simple before advice, which logs the method 
invocation's starting time:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.MethodBeforeAdvice;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;

Chapter 11
[ 291 ]
public class LogBeforeAdvice implements MethodBeforeAdvice {
    private static Logger logger =
                  Logger.getLogger(LogBeforeAdvice.class.getName());
    public void before(Method method, Object[] args, Object target)
                                              throws Throwable  {
        long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, method.getName()+" starts at " + 
start);
    }
}
After returning advice
The org.springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice interface, shown in the 
following code, lets you implement an advice to be executed after the method has 
finished successfully, without throwing an exception:
package org.springframework.aop;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
public interface AfterReturningAdvice extends AfterAdvice {
    void afterReturning(Object returnValue,
                        Method method,
                        Object[] args,
                        Object target) throws Throwable;
}
The afterReturning()method of this interface takes instances of Object, 
java.lang.reflect.Method, Object[], and Object as arguments, which represent, 
the return value of the target method, the target method, the target method's 
arguments, and the target object, respectively. As with the before() method in the 
BeforeMethodAdvice, the afterReturning() method returns void; and it does not 
allow changing of the return value.
The following code shows an implementation of AfterReturningAdvice, which 
logs the finishing time of the method invocation:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.AfterReturningAdvice;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class LogAfterAdvice implements AfterReturningAdvice {
    private static Logger logger = .
                Logger.getLogger(LogAfterAdvice.class.getName());

Spring AOP
[ 292 ]
    public void afterReturning(Object object, Method method,
                               Object[] args, Object target)
                                                     throws Throwable 
{
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, method.getName()+ " ends at " + end);
    }
}
This AfterReturningAdvice is only applied to target methods 
that have finished successfully without throwing an exception. The 
implemented advice in the code above only logs the finishing time of 
successful method execution.
Throws advice
The final type of advice provided by Spring is exposed through the 
org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice interface, shown in the 
following code:
package org.springframework.aop;
public interface ThrowsAdvice extends AfterAdvice {
}
This allows you to implement an advice that is applied when the target method 
throws an exception. Note that the ThrowsAdvice interface does not expose any 
method to be implemented. You have an option to implement any number of 
methods with the following signature:
afterThrowing([Method, args, target,] Throwable)
Method, args, and target represent, the target method being called, the target 
method's arguments, and the target object, respectively. Throwable exception 
represents a subclass of the java.lang.Throwable class that is thrown in the target 
method and causes this advice to be called. In all of the methods that implement this 
signature, only Throwable is mandatory. The other arguments are optional, meaning 
you can implement all three of the other arguments, or omit them all.

Chapter 11
[ 293 ]
The following code shows a ThrowsAdvice that logs the type of the exception 
thrown by the target method:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice;
import java.lang.reflect.Method;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class LogsThrowsAdvice implements ThrowsAdvice {
    private static Logger logger = 
                Logger.getLogger(LogsThrowsAdvice.class.getName());
    public void afterThrowing(Method method,
                              Object[] args,
                              Object target,
                              Exception ex) throws Throwable {
        logger.log(Level.INFO, ex.getClass()+" thrown in " + method);
    }
}
The afterThrowing()method can be overloaded with different types of exception 
as arguments to handle different exceptions differently. The following code shows a 
throws advice that logs java.io.IOException, but notifies the system administrator 
when an org.hibernate.HibernateException is thrown:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.springframework.aop.ThrowsAdvice;
import java.io.IOException;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class CustomExceptionsThrowsAdvice implements ThrowsAdvice {
    private static Logger logger =
       Logger.getLogger(CustomExceptionsThrowsAdvice.class.getName());
    NotificationServiceInf notificationService;
    public void afterThrowing(HibernateException ex) throws Throwable 
{
        notificationService.notify(ex.getMessage());
    }
    public void afterThrowing(IOException ex) throws Throwable {
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "An IOException occured");
    }
    public void setNotificationService(NotificationServiceInf 
notificationService){
        this.notificationService = notificationService;
    }
}

Pointcuts
As mentioned earlier, a pointcut is an object comprising a set of joinpoints, which 
identifies where advice applies. Here are some examples of pointcuts:
All methods of a class
All methods of a class with names that start with do
All getter or setter methods of a class
All methods returning void
All methods that do not have any arguments
All of these pointcuts are called static because they are identified based on static 
information before runtime. However, it is possible to determine a pointcut based on 
runtime information. For instance, as you will see with an upcoming example, you 
can define a pointcut that identifies all methods that are passed null as their first 
argument at runtime. Such pointcuts are called dynamic.
Pointcuts only specify the target methods, regardless of the target 
object to which the methods may belong.
The following table briefly describes all pointcuts shipped with Spring:
Spring Pointcut
Description
Setter and getter pointcut
The org.springframework.aop.support.
Pointcuts class has two final static members, which 
determine pointcuts for the getter and setter methods.
Name matched pointcut
This type is presented through the org.
springframework.aop.support.
NameMatchMethodPointcut class, allowing us to 
select the target methods based on their names. With 
this pointcut, regular expressions cannot be used for 
method names.
Regular expression pointcut
This type is provided through org.springframework.
aop.support.JdkRegexpMethodPointcut class, 
allowing us to select the target methods with the Java 1.4 
regular expression API. The target method name(s) are 
specified with regular expressions through the pattern 
or patterns properties, respectively.

Spring Pointcut
Description
Static matcher pointcut
This type is provided through the 
org.springframework.aop.support.
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut class to select target 
methods based on static information, such as the method 
names, the number of arguments, the arguments' types, 
and so on.
Dynamic matcher pointcut
This type, provided through the 
org.springframework.aop.support.
DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut class, allows us to 
select target methods based on the argument values at 
runtime, in addition to static information provided by the 
static matcher pointcut.
As you will see, the pointcuts listed in the table above may be used for programmatic 
proxy creation, as well as configuration in a Spring factory through setter injection.
The sections that follow explain each pointcut and how it is used, both 
programmatically (through the Java code) and declaratively (through the 
Spring context).
Setter and getter pointcut
The org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts class defines two static 
members for declaring a setter or getter method as a pointcut. These members are: 
GETTERS and SETTERS. Each specifies JavaBean-style getter methods and setter 
methods, respectively, of any class. For instance, you may create a pointcut object 
programmatically as follows:
Pointcut setterPointcut = org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts.
SETTERS;
Pointcut getterPointcut = org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts.
GETTERS;
Alternatively, you may define a pointcut object declaratively in the Spring context 
as follows:
<bean id="getterPointcut"
      class="org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts.GETTERS"/>
This pointcut specifies all getter methods of the target object.

Spring AOP
[ 296 ]
Name matched pointcut
The org.springframework.aop.support.NameMatchMethodPointcut class allows 
us to create a pointcut that selects target methods with a specific name. This class 
provides three methods for specifying the target methods' names:
public void setMappedName(String methodName)
public void setMappedNames(String[] methodNames)
public NameMatchMethodPointcut addMethodName(String s)
setMappedName() and setMappedNames() take a String or an array of Strings 
that represents the name or the names of target method or methods, respectively. 
Additionally, the addMethodName() method allows us to specify the target 
method names multiple times. Here is an example of programmatic creation of 
NameMatchMethodPointcut, which specifies all of the methods with the name 
saveStudent or updateStudent in the target object:
NameMatchMethodPointcut nmpc = new NameMatchMethodPointcut();
nmpc.setMappedNames(new String[]{"saveStudent", "updateStudent"});
The same object may be created through the addMethodName() as follows:
NameMatchMethodPointcut nmpc = 
        new NameMatchMethodPointcut().addMethodName("saveStudent").
                                     addMethodName("updateStudent");
Alternatively, you may configure an instance declaratively in the Spring context, 
as follows:
<bean id="studentDaoPointcut"
      class="org.springframework.aop.support.NameMatchMethodPointcut">
    <property name="mappedNames">
        <list>
            <value>saveStudent</value>
            <value>updateStudent</value>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>

Chapter 11
[ 297 ]
Regular expression pointcuts
This type of pointcut lets you specify the target method names with Java regular 
expressions. A regular expression allows you to describe the names of the target 
methods with strings. These strings may use wildcards to match or exclude groups 
of characters and markers that are required for matching in particular places. This 
type of pointcut is provided through the org.springframework.aop.support.
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut class. The following are the most useful methods of 
this class:
public void setPattern(String pattern)
public void setPatterns(String[] patterns)
public void setExcludedPattern(String pattern)
public void setExcludedPatterns(String[] patterns)
The setPattern()and setPatterns() methods allow us to specify, a regular 
expression or an array of regular expressions that the target method names should 
match. Two other methods, setExcludedPattern() and setExcludedPatterns(), 
let us determine a regular expression and an array of regular expressions that the 
target method names should not match.
Refer to http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/
essential/regex for more information about the regular expression 
syntax and wildcards.
Here is an example of using JdkRegexpMethodPointcut to select all methods whose 
names end with either Student or Course:
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut pc = new JdkRegexpMethodPointcut();
pc.setPatterns(new String[]{".*Student", ".*Course"});
This is the declarative approach for selecting the same methods:
<bean  class="org.springframework.aop.support.
JdkRegexpMethodPointcut">
    <property name="patterns">
        <list>
            <value>.*Student</value>
            <value>.*Course</value>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>

Spring AOP
[ 298 ]
Static matcher pointcut
Using this pointcut, you can select target methods based on static information of 
target methods and target classes, the information that can be estimated at compile 
time. This information includes the package name, class name, method name, the 
type of method's arguments, and so on. This type of pointcut is provided through 
org.springframework.aop.support.StaticMethodMatcherPointcut. To use it, 
create a subclass of StaticMethodMatcherPointcut, either as an individual class 
or on the fly (as you will see in the example), and implement its abstract matches() 
method. The matches() method has this signature:
public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass) {
    //select the target method
}
The matches() method takes two arguments: an instance of java.lang.reflect.
Method and a java.lang.Class instance. The first argument specifies the selected 
target method and the second argument determines the class to which the target 
method belongs. Here's an example:
public static Pointcut myStaticPointcut = new 
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut() {
    public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass) {
        String className = targetClass.getName();
        String methName = method.getName();
        if((className.indexOf("Test")==-1)&&(methName.
indexOf("Student")>-1)){
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
This pointcut selects the methods whose name includes the word Student, and 
whose classname does not contain the word Test.
Dynamic Matcher Pointcut
A dynamic matcher pointcut lets you create pointcuts that select target methods 
based on -information at runtime, which includes the actual values passed to the 
methods at runtime. This kind of pointcut is a superset of static matcher pointcut 
that was already discussed. This means you can use dynamic matcher pointcut 
to select targets based on the static information, estimated at compile time, and 
dynamic information at runtime. To implement this type of pointcut, create a 
subclass of org.springframework.aop.support.DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut 
and override its abstract matches() methods. The matches() methods in the class 
have these signatures:

Chapter 11
[ 299 ]
public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass) {
    // select the target method
}
public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass, Object[] 
args) {
    // select the target method
}
The two-argument matches() method is the same as you already saw for the static 
matcher pointcut, with the same functionality. The other variant of this method takes 
an array of Object as an extra argument, representing the arguments of the target 
method. You may evaluate these arguments to check whether the current method 
satisfies your criteria. Note that the three-argument matches() method is only called 
for target methods that satisfy the two-argument method.
As with the static matcher pointcut, you may create an individual subclass, or 
implement a subclass on the fly. Here is an example:
public static Pointcut myDynamicPointcut = new 
DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut() {
    public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass) {
        String className = targetClass.getName();
        String methName = method.getName();
        if((className.indexOf("Test")==-1) && (methName.
          indexOf("Student")>-1)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    public boolean matches(Method method, Class targetClass, 
     Object[] args) {
        if ((args.length > 0) && (args[0] != null)) {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
This pointcut selects methods whose name includes the word Student, that have at 
least one argument (the first of which is not null), and whose classname does not 
contain the word Test.

Spring AOP
[ 300 ]
Pointcut composition
It is possible to combine pointcuts to create a complex pointcut. The resulting 
pointcut may use a combination of logic to select the target methods. The 
org.springframework.aop.support.Pointcuts class provides the union() 
and intersection() methods, which can be used for this purpose as follows:
public static Pointcut union(Pointcut p1, Pointcut p2)
public static Pointcut intersection(Pointcut p1, Pointcut p2)
The union() result of two pointcuts is a pointcut that selects any method which 
satisfies at least one of the input pointcuts. The intersection() result is a pointcut 
that selects only methods matched by both pointcuts.
Unfortunately, there is no way to compose pointcuts declaratively.
Advisor
Spring uses an extra object, called an advisor, to apply advice to the target methods. 
This object wraps an advice, and a pointcut and is responsible for applying the 
advice to the pointcut.
To create an advisor, you need to implement the org.springframework.aop.
Advisor interface. Spring provides a set of convenient implementations, which 
relieve you from having to implement a new advisor. A common implementation 
that can be used with any Spring advice type is org.springframework.aop.
support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor. A DefaultPointcutAdvisor instance may be 
created programmatically with an already created pointcut and advice as follows:
DefaultPointcutAdvisor advisor = new DefaultPointcutAdvisor(pointcut, 
advice);
Alternatively, you can create the advisor declaratively in the Spring context 
as follows:
<bean name ="advisor"
      class="org.springframework.aop.support.DefaultPointcutAdvisor">
    <property name="pointcut">
        <ref local="pointcut" />
    </property>
    <property name="advice">
        <ref local="advice" />
    </property>
</bean>

Chapter 11
[ 301 ]
You may use an advice without specifying any pointcut. When you do, 
the advice is applied to all methods of the target object. Additionally, 
Spring lets you use an advice without an advisor. The advice is 
automatically wrapped in an advisor object and applied to all methods 
of the target object.
Proxy configuration and creation
The proxy object starts the invocation chain of advisors, which ends with the target 
object. Like many other AOP components, Spring allows us to create proxy objects 
both programmatically and declaratively. To create a proxy object, you need to 
configure it with any already defined Spring proxy classes. There are proxy factories 
to create a proxy object whenever it is needed. The following table lists the essential 
proxy factory types:
Proxy Factory Type
Description
ProxyFactory
This is used to create proxy objects 
programmatically, without an IoC container.
ProxyFactoryBean
This is used to configure and create proxy 
objects in the IoC manner with the Spring 
application context.
AbstractAutoProxyCreator
This abstract class defines a proxy factory used 
to implement automatic proxying.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean
This is a specialization of the 
ProxyFactoryBean used to create a 
transactional proxy, discussed in Chapters 12 
and 13.
Let's see how each factory can be used to create proxy objects.

Spring AOP
[ 302 ]
Using ProxyFactory
Spring provides the org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactory class to 
create proxy objects programmatically. At the start of this chapter, you saw a simple 
example. The following table describes some of its useful methods:
Method
Description
void addAdvice(Advice advice)
This method takes an org.aopalliance.
aop.Advice object as its argument, and 
adds it to the tail of the advice chain.
void addAdvisor(Advisor advisor)
This method adds an advisor of type 
org.springframework.aop.Advisor.
void addInterface(Class aClass)
This method adds a new proxied interface. 
If it is not used, the AOP framework 
automatically proxies all interfaces 
implemented by the target.
void setTarget(Object o)
This method sets the given object as the 
target to which all advice is applied.
java.lang.Object getProxy()
This method creates and returns a new 
proxy according to the settings used for 
this factory.
Using ProxyFactoryBean
The most commonly used proxy factory in Spring's AOP framework is 
ProxyFactoryBean. It allows us to configure the proxy factory in the Spring context 
as a bean of type org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean.
To use this proxy factory, you need to configure the required objects, such as 
advisors, advice, and pointcuts, as individual beans in the Spring context. Then, 
configure the ProxyFactoryBean instance with its required properties, which are 
explained in the following table:
Property Name
Meaning
proxyInterfaces
This property specifies the interfaces implemented by the target 
object, which should be proxied.
interceptorNames
This property indicates a list of names of advice, advisors, 
or interceptors linking the advice/advisor/interceptor 
chain together.
target
This property determines the target object to which the 
advisor/interceptor chain is applied.

Chapter 11
[ 303 ]
Here is an example of ProxyFactoryBean configuration:
<bean id="studentService"
      class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
    <property name="proxyInterfaces">
        <value>com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.StudentServiceInf</
value>
    </property>
    <property name="target">
        <ref local="studentService"/>
    </property>
    <property name="interceptorNames">
        <list>
            <value>advisor</value>
            <value>advice</value>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
The advice, advisors, or interceptors specified through the 
interceptorNames property are applied based on the order in 
which they have been specified.
Assembling the AOP components
We can now arrange all of the AOP components and see what they look like. 
The following code shows the Spring context that includes all of the AOP 
component definitions:

Moving to Spring 2.x's AOP
So far in this chapter, we have discussed only AOP implementations that 
were introduced in Spring 1.2.x. Spring 2.0 comes with a different AOP 
framework. The new AOP framework is fully integrated with AspectJ. AspectJ 
(http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj), an extension to the Java language, provides 
aspect-oriented programming features. The most valuable feature of AspectJ, in 
addition to its simplicity and maturity, is its pointcut expression language, which 
lets us express pointcuts with simple string literals.
With its AspectJ support, Spring 2.0 adds a new term to its AOP terminology: 
aspect. As you will see, an aspect is basically an advisor which encapsulates a 
pointcut and an advice.
With Spring 2.0, you can still use the classic AOP features provided 
by Spring 1.2.x.
The most significant improvements of the Spring 2.0 AOP can be summarized 
as follows:
Easier AOP configuration: Spring 2.x introduces new schema support 
for defining aspects backed by aspect definition with the general 
<bean> element.
Support for AspectJ integration: Spring 2.x takes advantage of AspectJ, 
a powerful, full-blown AOP framework for Java. Additionally, Spring 2.x 
supports aspects defined using the @AspectJ annotations. These aspects, 
which can be shared between AspectJ and Spring AOP, require only 
simple configuration.
Support for the bean name pointcut element: Spring 2.5 introduces 
support for the bean(...) pointcut element, matching specific named 
beans according to Spring-defined bean names.

Spring AOP
[ 306 ]
Let's look at AOP configuration with the AOP schema, and explore how to use new 
features of the Spring AOP framework.
Classic AOP development with Spring allows us to implement and use 
only four types of advice: MethodInterceptor, MethodBeforeAdvice, 
AfterReturningAdvice, and ThrowsAdvice. Spring 2.0 has added another kind 
of advice, called after advice, which is called when the joinpoint method returns 
successfully, or breaks with an exception.
Moreover, with Spring 2.x you must implement a subclass of a Spring or an 
AspectJ-specific class to define an advice. However, you can turn any method of 
any class into an advice method. This means that any ordinary class can be an 
advice. To keep things simple, let's assume that we are going to apply a simple 
advice to pointcuts. The advice prints out a message in the application console when 
the joinpoint method executes. The following code shows the MessageWriter class 
that does this with its writeMessage() method:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
public class MessageWriter {
    public void writeMessage() {
        System.out.print("Simple Message");
    }
}
Let's see how this advice can be configured in the Spring context and applied to the 
joinpoint method.
To use the new features of Spring 2.0 AOP, you need the AspectJ library, 
distributed with Spring, in your application classpath.
AOP configuration with the AOP schema
To use Spring 2.0 AOP's new features, you must declare the AOP namespace (aop) 
with the actual schema location (http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/
spring-aop-2.5.xsd) in the Spring context, as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/
                        spring-beans-2.5.xsd

Chapter 11
[ 307 ]
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/
                        spring-aop-2.5.xsd">
</beans>
This configuration lets you use proprietary AOP XML elements in the Spring 
configuration file. However, you still have an option to configure AOP components 
classically, as discussed with Spring 1.2.x.
To configure AOP components, add the <aop:config> element to the Spring 
configuration file, as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
       xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:aop="http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop"
       xsi:schemaLocation="
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-
beans-2.5.xsd
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop
                   http://www.springframework.org/schema/aop/spring-
aop-2.5.xsd">
    <aop:config>
    </aop:config>
</beans>
All of the AOP components are configured through nested elements within the 
<aop:config>. These elements are as follows:
<aop:aspect>
<aop:pointcut>
<aop:before>
<aop:after-returning>
<aop:after-throwing>
<aop:after>
<aop:around>
The subsequent sections discuss how each of these elements is used to declare an 
AOP component.

Spring AOP
[ 308 ]
Defining aspects
The <aop:aspect> element is used within the <aop:config> element to define an 
aspect. Each <aop:aspect> element comes with two attributes, id and ref. The id 
attribute specifies an identifier for the aspect, and ref refers to another bean defined 
in the configuration file. The bean referred by the ref attribute is a simple Java object 
defined as an ordinary bean inside the configuration file. Actually, this bean specifies 
the advice object. In our example, this bean represents the MessageWriter object, 
and can be configured as follows:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
      ...
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>
This code simply defines an aspect with the aspect1 identifier. This aspect refers to 
the ordinary messageWriter bean as the advice. This aspect configuration won't do 
anything. We must complete the <aop:aspect> configuration with pointcuts and 
advice. Let's see how the other elements come into play.
Defining pointcuts
The <aop:pointcut> element defines a pointcut. A pointcut can be defined either 
inside an <aop:config> element, to be shared across several aspects and advisors, 
or directly inside an <aop:aspect> element, to be used proprietarily for the aspect 
specified through the <aop:aspect>.
The <aop:pointcut> element takes id and expression as attributes. id assigns 
an identifier to the pointcut, which lets you refer to the pointcut when the aspect is 
defined. The expression attribute determines the joinpoints with which the pointcut 
is associated through the AspectJ pointcut language. The following code shows an 
example of a pointcut definition directly within the <aop:config> element:
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
</aop:config>
This pointcut selects all of the methods defined in the service classes, the classes 
located in the com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11 package whose names end 
with Service.

Chapter 11
[ 309 ]
The AspectJ language's rules are easy and simple. They can be summarized 
as follows:
Pointcut designators: The most significant designators are execution() and 
within(). The execution() method allows matching execution joinpoints. 
The within() method limits matching to joinpoints with certain types. For 
example, execution(public * *(..)) selects all public methods, and 
within(com.service.*) selects all methods located in classes in the 
com.service package.
Pointcut compositors: These are the AND (&&), OR(||), and NOT (!) 
operators that narrow down the selection. For example, execution(* 
get(..))&&execution(* set(..)) selects all setter and getter methods.
Visibility selectors: These are public and protected operators that narrow 
down the selection to only public or protected methods. For example, 
execution(public * *(..)) selects all public methods.
Package, class, and method selectors: These selectors are the full or partial 
name of a package, a class, and a method that narrow down the selection 
to specific packages, classes, and methods. For example, execution
(* set*(..)) selects all methods starting with the word "set" in any 
class and in any package, and * com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..) selects all methods of the service classes.
Annotations: These are annotations in Java code to select methods. For 
example, @target(org.springframework.transaction.annotation.
Transactional) selects all methods in the target object annotated with 
@Transactional.
For a full discussion of AspectJ's pointcut language, see the AspectJ 
Programming Guide at http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/
doc/released/progguide/index.html.
Defining an advice
As mentioned earlier, with Spring 2.0 you can define five kinds of advice. Each 
advice is defined as an individual element within <aop:config>. The following 
subsections discuss how to implement and define these kinds of advice.
•
•
•
•
•

Spring AOP
[ 310 ]
Before advice
A before advice executes before a joinpoint method's execution. This advice is 
defined through the <aop:before> element within <aop:aspect>. Here is 
an example:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
        <aop:before pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" 
method="writeMessage" />
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>
The pointcut-ref attribute refers to a configured pointcut. The method 
attribute specifies the method of the messageWriter bean to be used as 
the advice method. The <aop:before> element turns the writerMessage() 
method on the messageWriter bean into an advice method, so the 
MessageWriter.writeMessage() method is invoked before any 
method matching the joinpoints is executed.
After returning advice
An after returning advice executes after the method successfully returns without 
throwing an exception. The <aop:after-returning> element is used within 
<aop:aspect> to define an after returning advice. Here's an example:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
        <aop:after-returning pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut"
method="writeMessage"/>
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>

Chapter 11
[ 311 ]
The after returning advice can be used with an additional attribute called returning, 
as shown here:
<aop:after-returning pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" 
method="writeMessage"
 returning="retValue"/>
This attribute lets us get hold of the return value within the advice body. The 
returning attribute specifies the name of the parameter of the advice to which the 
return value of the method matched by the pointcut is bound. With the preceding 
configuration, the writeMessage() method would have this signature:
public void writeMessage(Object retValue)
After throwing advice
This advice executes after the joinpoint throws an exception instead of returning 
normally. To define this kind of advice, use the <aop:after-throwing> element 
within the <aop:aspect> element. The <aop:throwing> element uses an additional 
throwing attribute, which specifies the name of the method parameter to which the 
thrown exception should be bound. Here is an example:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
        ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
        <aop:after-throwing pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" 
          method="writeMessage" throwing="thrownException"/>
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>
With the preceding configuration, the writeMessage() method would have 
this signature:
public void writeMessage(Exception thrownException)
Here, the exception thrown by the method matched by the pointcut is passed to the 
writeMessage() method through the thrownException argument.

Spring AOP
[ 312 ]
After advice
An after advice executes after method execution, whether the method returns 
successfully or throws an exception. This kind of advice is analogous to the 
finally block in Java code, which is always executed when the try or the catch 
block executes. This advice is defined through the <aop:after> element within 
<aop:aspect>, as in this example:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
        <aop:after pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" 
method="writeMessage"/>
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>
The writeMessage() method on the messageWriter instance is called whenever 
the method matched by the pointcut finishes.
Around advice
This kind of advice lets you execute code before or after joinpoints. Similar to what 
you have already seen in Spring 1.2.x, the around advice can prevent the execution 
of the joinpoint method. The <aop:around> element is used within <aop:aspect> to 
define the around advice. Here's an example:
<bean id="messageWriter"
    class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11.MessageWriter">
</bean>
<aop:config>
    <aop:pointcut id="servicesPointcut"
       expression="execution(* com.packtpub.springhibernate.
ch11.*Service.*(..))"/>
    <aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
        <aop:around pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" 
method="writeMessage"/>
    </aop:aspect>
</aop:config>

Chapter 11
[ 313 ]
The around advice is the only advice that needs to be AspectJ-aware. With this kind 
of advice, the method of the advice class is implemented with an extra argument 
of type org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint. The ProceedingJoinPoint 
method is analogous to the AOP Alliance's MethodInterceptor, which lets you 
control the joinpoint method's execution, whether the joinpoint method executes 
or is ignored. The following code shows the MessageWriter class, which now is 
an AspectJ around advice:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch11;
import org.aspectj.lang.ProceedingJoinPoint;
public class MessageWriter {
    public void writeMessage(ProceedingJoinPoint call) throws 
Throwable {
        System.out.println("Before Target");
        call.proceed();
        System.out.println("After Target");
    }
}
Note that the custom code executes before and after invocation of the 
call.proceed() method.
Advice parameters
You may wonder how an advice can access joinpoint methods. The answer is 
through an additional attribute named arg-names. This attribute lets you specify 
the joinpoint method's arguments which are provided for the advice method. For 
instance, suppose the joinpoint method uses two arguments: beforeMessage and 
afterMessage. The <aop:advice> element can be configured as follows, so that 
both arguments are provided for the advice method:
<aop:aspect id="aspect1" ref="messageWriter">
    <aop:around pointcut-ref="servicesPointcut" method="writeMessage"
       arg-names="beforeMessage, afterMessage"/>
</aop:aspect>
As you can see, the arguments are specified as a comma-separated list of 
argument names. By this, the writeMessage() method of the advice would 
have the following signature:
public void writeMessage(String beforeMessage, String afterMessage)
Note that the beforeMessage and afterMessage arguments, which are the joinpoint 
method's arguments, are provided for manipulation in the advice method.

Spring AOP
[ 314 ]
If you've tried to execute the examples in this chapter, you've seen that 
they work without a proxy object defined. Spring 2.0 uses automatic 
proxy-type detection for all advised objects.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technology as a 
complementary approach to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). AOP technology 
defines the aspect, a new concept in system development.
AOP development involves five components: advice, pointcut, advisor, target object, 
and proxy. Advice specifies the logic that is performed. A pointcut determines 
the target methods that are advised. An advisor, or aspect, pulls an advice and a 
pointcut together, and is responsible for applying the advice to the pointcut. The 
target object is the object that includes the advice methods. A proxy, the object 
delegated by the method invocation, calls advisors behind the scenes.
Spring provides three types of advice in addition to the MethodInterceptor 
inherited from the AOP Alliance: ThrowsAdvice, BeforeAdvice, and 
AfterReturningAdvice. ThrowsAdvice allows us to implement an advice that 
is called when the target method throws an exception. BeforeAdvice is used to 
implement advice called before method execution. AfterReturningAdvice is used 
to implement advice called after normal execution of the target method.
To create a pointcut, you must create instances of the Pointcut implementations. 
These are NameMatchMethodPointcut, JdkRegexpMethodPointcut, 
StaticMethodMatcherPointcut, DynamicMethodMatcherPointcut, which allow 
you to select the target methods based on their names, Java regular expressions, 
static information, or dynamic information at runtime, respectively. Additionally, 
you can use Pointcuts.SETTERS and Pointcuts.GETTERS to select target methods, 
which are setter and getters, respectively.
Spring's advisors are implementations of the Advisor interface. The most common 
implementation is DefaultPointcutAdvisor, which can be used with any Spring 
advice type and the AOP Alliance's MethodInterceptor.
You must create a proxy object to delegate method invocation and call any advice, 
advisor, or interceptor behind the scenes. Proxy objects are not created on their own, 
but are created by proxy factory objects. Spring provides a range of different proxy 
factory classes: ProxyFactory, ProxyFactoryBean, AbstractAutoProxyCreator, 
and TransactionProxyFactoryBean, which are used, respectively, to create a proxy 
object programmatically, to create one declaratively, to automate proxy creation, and 
to create a transactional proxy.

Chapter 11
[ 315 ]
Spring 2.0 comes with full support for AspectJ integration. Spring 2.0 provides a 
proprietary XML schema to configure and wire AOP components together. The 
main features of Spring 2.0 for AOP implementation are easier XML configuration 
and support for comprehensive advice. To use Spring 2.0 AOP, you must declare the 
Spring AOP schema with its location. You can then use <aop:config> as the root 
element for AOP configuration, <aop:aspect> to define an aspect, <aop:pointcut> 
to declare a pointcut, and <aop:before>, <aop:after>, <aop:after-returning>, 
<aop:after-throwing>, and <aop:around> to define types of advice.


Transaction Management
Enterprise applications let users insert new data or manipulate existing data. In most 
situations, this data is crucial, so the application must perform data manipulation 
reliably. This reliability is guaranteed through transactions, the subject of this chapter.
A transaction is defined as a unit of work, a sequence of operations that must be 
completed all together, that must be performed reliably. Although this is not a 
comprehensive definition of a transaction, it's sufficient to give us an idea of what 
transactions aim to provide. 
Databases are the main context in which transactions are discussed. In a database, a 
transaction implies the reliable performance of a unit of persistence operations. As 
applications interact with databases, these interactions involve transactions, as well. 
Applications do not need to implement transactions themselves. Instead, they rely on 
transaction services exposed by the underlying database or by the application server. 
This means the application's job is managing transactions, not implementing them. 
Transaction management includes two activities:
Configuring transactions: How are persistence operations grouped as 
transactions? How are they isolated from each other?
Determining application reactions: What is the application's response when 
a transaction's execution succeeds or fails? 
Java, and other enterprise languages, provide APIs to configure transactions and 
determine how the application reacts to them. This is the role of a language in 
managing transactions.

Transaction Management
[ 318 ]
This chapter explains concepts related to transactions and how transactions are 
managed in native and Spring-based Hibernate applications. It also discusses 
transactional and non-transactional caching as two level caching supported by 
Hibernate. In particular, the chapter covers these topics:
Transaction essentials
The Hibernate Transaction API
The Spring Transaction Abstraction API
Caching
Transaction essentials
Put simply, a transaction is a set of operations that must be considered as a single 
unit of work. All of the operations must be completed successfully, or none must be 
carried out. If, for any reason, one or more operations fail, any successful operations 
in the transaction (or their effects) must be undone. 
If the unit of work includes one operation, a transaction for that unit means either 
that the operation must be completed successfully, or that no persistent state must 
ever be affected. Additionally, that operation must be performed in isolation from 
other operations associated with other transactions and executed concurrently. 
The same statements are true for a unit of work with multiple operations. All of 
the transaction's operations must be performed successfully, or all must be failed 
together as if nothing ever happened. The operations associated with one transaction 
must be isolated from concurrent operations associated with another transaction. 
A common example of a transaction is transferring money from one account to 
another. As debiting the first account and crediting the second must be considered a 
single job, we expect these actions to be done as parts of a single transaction. In other 
words, if one operation fails, we expect that the other operation will also fail or will 
be undone. Otherwise, the transfer is not balanced. 
Each transaction starts from an initial state. The initial state is the data's state before 
any changes are applied during the transaction. All other transactions that work 
with this data see the data as it is in this state. The transaction is executed, and the 
data may change. When all changes are successfully completed, the transaction is 
committed, meaning all changes are applied and the transaction moves to a stable 
state. If a change is not successfully completed, the transaction is rolled back, meaning 
that all changes are undone and the transaction moves to the initial state from which 
it started. The following figure shows this process for our example transaction:

Transactions are often described using a set of properties called ACID, which 
stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. The ACID properties, 
described in the following list, are the rules that transactions must obey: 
Atomicity: Each transaction is done as a unit of work. If one step of the unit 
fails, other steps must not be carried out, or must be undone. 
Consistency: Each transaction must obey the rules of the affected resource 
and move it to a consistent state. 
Isolation: Each transaction must operate in isolation from other, concurrent 
transactions. If two transactions are executed concurrently, one cannot affect 
the other's results before each transaction is committed. For instance, in the 
educational system application, each course is associated with only a single 
teacher. When a course is assigned to a teacher in a transaction, another 
transaction cannot assign the same course to another teacher while the first 
transaction is not committed. The isolation aspect of transactions guarantees 
that any transaction data cannot be changed by another transaction while it is 
being processed. 
Durability: Each transaction result must be maintained until another 
transaction is performed against the result. 
Of these properties, only atomicity and isolation are configurable properties that 
affect application code. Consistency and durability (permanent, fixed properties that 
are not configurable) are provided and managed by databases.
Managing transactions in Java 
Java applications offer a range of different APIs for managing transactions. Based 
on your application type or your application requirements, you may prefer (or be 
forced) to use a particular API. Transaction APIs can be summarized as follows:
JDBC Transaction API: This is the core Java API for managing transactions 
that are associated with a single database. This API is exposed through 
the java.sql.Connection interface, which provides setAutoCommit(), 
commit(), and rollback() methods to manage transactions.
•
•

Transaction Management
[ 320 ]
Java Transaction API (JTA): This is the Java EE standard API for managing 
transactions, particularly in distributed environments such as application 
servers. This API, which is exposed through the javax.transaction.
UserTransaction interface, is useful in situations where application 
involves multiple transactional resources.
Hibernate Transaction API: This is a Hibernate-specific API and JPA 
Transaction API for transaction management in Hibernate applications. 
These APIs, which are respectively exposed through the org.hibernate.
Transaction and javax.persistence.EntityTransaction interfaces, 
transmit transaction calls to associated java.sql.Connection instances. 
Spring Transaction Abstraction API: Part of the Spring API, this is for 
abstracting the application from the underlying transaction API.
Local versus global transactions
Transactions come in two flavors: local and global. Local transactions involve only 
a single transactional resource (for example, a single database). There may be many 
transactional resources, but if each resource has its own transactions isolated from 
other resources' transactions, the transactions are local ones. The code to manage this 
type of transactions is simple because all transaction implementation is located in a 
single resource. In the case of a database, the application code simply uses the JDBC 
API with commit() and rollback() methods to manage transactions. 
In contrast, global transactions (also called distributed transactions) involve multiple 
transactional resources (for example, multiple databases). To manage distributed 
transactions, the application uses JTA to interact with a third entity, which is called 
the transaction manager. A transaction manager is typically an application server, 
such as IBM WebSphere or BEA WebLogic, and is responsible for coordinating 
transactions among resources and providing a two-phase commit process. This 
two-phase commit ensures that all involved resources commit their associated 
transactions successfully or, if one transaction fails, all other transactions are rolled 
back. JTA defines a standard API to interact with different transaction managers. 
Distributed transactions are more difficult to manage, and, of course, they are 
executed with overhead that decreases performance. 
JTA can be used to manage local transactions, as well. However, JTA 
needs a JTA provider (for example, Tomcat and any standard application 
server) and always has overhead.

Chapter 12
[ 321 ]
Transaction demarcation
When managing transactions, you need to mark where each transaction starts and 
ends. This is called transaction demarcation, and there are two different approaches 
to it: programmatic and declarative. Next, we'll discuss how these approaches are 
implemented in Hibernate applications.
Programmatic transaction demarcation
Transactions can be demarcated programmatically. JTA or JDBC APIs can be used 
directly in the application code to begin and commit or roll back transactions. With 
JDBC, the setAutoCommit(false) method is called on the Connection object to 
begin a transaction. The started transaction can be committed or rolled back via 
commit() or rollback() on the Connection instance, respectively. In the case of 
a global transaction, a UserTransaction object is obtained from the transaction 
manager through looking up the manager. The UserTransaction instance is used 
as a handler to signal the manager where the transaction starts, UserTransaction.
begin(), and where the transaction is committed, UserTransaction.commit(), or 
rolled back, UserTransaction.rollback().
When the application uses Hibernate to interact with a single database, you obtain 
an org.hibernate.Transaction object from the Session instance as a handler to 
work with the underlying JDBC transaction API. Although it is still possible to use 
the JDBC API directly in Hibernate applications, the applications should always rely 
on the Hibernate API instead of binding to the JDBC API. Global transactions are 
always managed in the same way, whether the application uses Hibernate or another 
O/R framework. 
Declarative transaction demarcation
The declarative approach makes it possible to mark transaction boundaries 
declaratively through XML files or Java annotations instead of calling a particular 
API, such as JDBC or JTA. There are actually two approaches to declarative 
transaction demarcation: using EJB as a part of the Java EE specification, and using 
Spring. Using EJB is outside of this book's scope. However, at the end of this chapter, 
we'll take a look at Spring and how it manages transactions.

Transaction Management
[ 322 ]
Transaction attributes
Transactions can be configured with various attributes to provide more control of 
transaction execution. These attributes include the following: 
Isolation level: This is the first and most significant transaction attribute. 
Although the underlying database uses a particular isolation level by default, 
you may decide which isolation level suits your application's needs. The 
following table shows the isolation levels that are supported by JDBC and 
most databases. All isolation levels are defined as static members of the 
java.sql.Connection interface.
Propagation behavior: This describes how one or more transactions 
participate in a bigger transaction and affect its result. The table, shown 
after isolation level table, lists the different propagation behaviors. 
Timeout: This specifies how long a transaction is permitted to run. If 
the execution time for that transaction exceeds the specified timeout, the 
transaction must be canceled and rolled back.
Read-only: This specifies whether the transaction is allowed to modify the 
resource data. Setting this attribute to true allows the transaction provider 
(for example, Hibernate) to provide some optimizations. 
Here are the isolation levels and their equivalent values:
Isolation Level
Equivalent Value
TRANSACTION_NONE
0
TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED
1
TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
2
TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ
4
TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE

And the following table shows different propagation behaviors:
Propagation Value
Description
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED
The method participates in the current transaction. 
If no transaction exists, a new one is created.
PROPAGATION_SUPPORTS
The method participates in the current transaction. 
If no transaction exists, the method executes without 
a transaction.
PROPAGATION_MANDATORY
The method participates in the current transaction. 
If no transaction exists, an exception is thrown.
PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW
The method executes in a new transaction. If a 
transaction exists, the transaction will be suspended.

Chapter 12
[ 323 ]
Propagation Value
Description
PROPAGATION_NOT_SUPPORTED
The method executes without a transaction. If a 
transaction exists, the transaction will be suspended.
PROPAGATION_NEVER
The method executes without a transaction. If a 
transaction exists, an exception is thrown.
PROPAGATION_NESTED
The method executes within a nested transaction if a 
current transaction exists. Otherwise, it behaves like 
PROPAGATION_REQUIRED.
Now that you've seen some background material for transactions, it's time to 
look at transaction implementation details, both in native and in Spring-based 
Hibernate applications.
Transactions in Hibernate applications
With JDBC, java.sql.Connection objects are always used to interact with the 
database, perform persistent operations, and manage transactions. With Hibernate, 
org.hibernate.Session objects are used to interact with the database. In turn, the 
Session objects use the Connection objects. 
Each Session object uses an individual Connection object behind the scenes to 
perform persistent operations and manage transactions. The following snippet 
shows a typical procedure for transaction management with Hibernate:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = null;
try {
  tx = session.beginTransaction();
  // Unit of work inside the transaction
  tx.commit();
  tx = null;
} catch (Exception e) {
  if (tx != null) 
    try {
      tx.rollback();
    } catch (HibernateException innerEx) {
      logger.log("Couldn't roll back transaction", innerEx);
    }
} finally {
  session.close();
}

Transaction Management
[ 324 ]
Let's go through the code and see what each line does:
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession(): A Session instance 
is obtained from the SessionFactory. Obtaining a Session object notionally 
means fetching a Connection object from the connection pool. However, the 
Session object does not fetch a Connection from the pool until the Session 
transaction starts by invoking Session.beginTransaction(). 
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction(): The 
beginTransaction() method of Session marks the starting point of the 
transaction. This method returns an org.hibernate.Transaction instance 
as a handler to commit or roll back the transaction at the end. By calling the 
beginTransaction() method, the Session is bound to a fresh Connection 
object from the connection pool, the setAutoCommit(false) method on the 
associated Connection object is called, and the transaction starts.
Performing persistent operations: The Session object is used to perform 
persistent operations that must be done as a unit of work inside a transaction. 
tx.commit(): This is the transaction's end point, where you decide whether 
to commit all changes to the database. If everything goes well, the transaction 
is committed. This flushes the Session instance, synchronizes it with the 
database, and releases the Connection object to which the Session is bound. 
tx=null: The Transaction instance is thrown away. Assigning null to 
the Transaction instance allows us to check in the catch block whether 
the transaction successfully committed. (tx=null is invoked when the 
tx.commit()executes without an exception.)
catch block: The only operation in the catch block is rolling back the 
transaction if it has not committed successfully. 
session.close(): You need to clean up the Session instance and release 
its resources. 
Many Session and Transaction methods throw a 
HibernateException. However, because HibernateException is 
an unchecked exception, you don't need to catch it if you don't want to. 
Often, we should worry about commit fulfillment, as we have done here, 
so we catch exceptions only for rolling back the transaction.

[ 325 ]
Using JTA in Hibernate applications
In rare situations, an application uses more than one database. One valid use case 
for this situation is when your data is not in one database, and is scattered among 
many databases. In such situations, the JDBC API, which Hibernate uses internally 
to manage transactions, is not sufficient. In this case, you must use JTA to manage 
transactions. However, JTA is available only in managed environments (for example, 
a Java EE application server, such as IBM WebSphere (http://www.ibm.com/
websphere), or a stand-alone JTA provider, such as ObjectWeb JOTM 
(http://jotm.objectweb.org)). 
To use JTA, Hibernate should be configured as follows:
In the Hibernate configuration file, set the hibernate.transaction.
factory_class property to org.hibernate.transaction.
JTATransactionFactory. (The default value for the hibernate.
transaction.factory_class property is org.hibernate.transaction.
JDBCTransactionFactory, meaning that Hibernate uses the JDBC 
transaction API by default.)
Set hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class to an appropriate 
TransactionManagerLookup implementation corresponding to the managed 
environment that provides transactions. (For instance, use org.hibernate.
transaction.WebSphereTransactionManagerLookup when you are using 
IBM WebSphere as the managed environment.)
Configure Hibernate with the right values for hibernate.jndi.url and 
hibernate.jndi.<JNDIpropertyname> to use managed connections from 
the container. (Refer to Chapter 4 for more information.)
Obtain a javax.transaction.UserTransaction object by looking up an 
environment JNDI node, and use the obtained object to commit or roll back 
the transaction.
The following code shows how to use JTA to perform persistent operations with 
two databases:
UserTransaction utx = 
  (UserTransaction) new InitialContext().lookup("java:comp/env/tx");
Session session1 = null;
Session session2 = null;
try {
  utx.begin();
  session1 = HibernateHelper.getSession1();
  session2 = HibernateHelper.getSession2();
  // interacting with server
  // Unit of work inside the transaction
•
•
•
•

Transaction Management
[ 326 ]
  utx.commit();
} catch (RuntimeException ex) {
  try {
    utx.rollback();
    throw ex;
  } catch (SystemException sysEx) {
    logger.log("Couldn't roll back transaction", sysEx);
  }
}
As you can see, a UserTransaction object is obtained through looking up the 
container. The begin() method is called on the obtained UserTransaction to start 
the transaction. After all of the work has been done, the commit() method is invoked 
on the UserTransaction object to commit the transaction. Any exception during the 
databases' interaction caught in the catch block rolls back the transaction. 
Spring transaction abstraction 
So far, you have learned how to manage Hibernate transactions through JDBC 
(when Hibernate uses a single database) and through JTA (when Hibernate 
interacts with multiple databases). Spring can simplify transaction management 
in Hibernate applications by providing a transaction infrastructure to abstract the 
application code from the underlying transaction strategy. Using Spring, transaction 
management code that's bound to a specific API, such as JDBC or JTA, is omitted 
from the application. With Spring, you can manage transactions programmatically 
or declaratively. However, the declarative approach has certain advantages and is 
always preferred. 
Transaction management with Spring is powerful and flexible because Spring 
provides a rich set of options for a range of different environments. With Spring, 
you can easily switch to a different transaction strategy without making significant 
changes to the application code.
How Spring manages transactions
In the previous chapter, we established that transactions are cross-cutting concerns. 
Transaction management is logic that is scattered over the entire application. 
With Spring, we can implement transaction management code as advice applied 
to particular classes of the application. The following figure shows the individual 
participants in Spring's transaction management:

Chapter 12
[ 327 ]

Transaction

Only the gray objects in the figure above are used in the application code. 
The white objects are wholly configured, instantiated, and managed by 
the Spring container.
The following table describes the role of each object in the above figure:
Object
Role
Data source
This object represents the java.sql.Connection factory. It is 
configured as a bean of type javax.sql.DataSource.
Transaction 
manager
This object abstracts the application code from the 
underlying transaction API. There is an individual 
implementation of org.springframework.transaction.
PlatformTransactionManager for each persistence technology 
supported by Spring.
Transaction 
interceptor
This is an around advice that binds methods to transactions.
Transactional 
object
This is the object that is bound to the transaction interceptor.
Transaction 
proxy
This is an intermediate object, residing between the calling object and 
the transactional object. It is responsible for applying the transaction 
interceptor.
Calling object
This is the object that calls the transactional object. Actually, the calling 
object interacts with a transaction proxy to call the transactional object.
Let's go through this list and see how each object is configured.
The choice of transaction manager
Spring provides a distinct transaction manager for each persistence technology that it 
supports. The transaction manager abstracts the details of the underlying transaction 
management API. The following table shows the different transaction managers 
that Spring provides. Each transaction manager is an implementation of 
org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager:

TopLinkTransactionManager
This manages transactions associated 
with TopLink's Sessions.
org.springframework.jta.
JtaTransactionManager
This manages transactions associated 
with JTA's javax.transaction.
UserTransaction objects.
To use the Spring transaction API, you must use a transaction manager that's 
appropriate to the persistence technology your application uses. Additionally, you 
must use an appropriate connection factory, creating connection objects of the 
target persistence technology. The following table shows the factory classes 
provided by Spring:
Factory Class

org.springframework.orm.hibernate. 
LocalSessionFactoryBean
This is a factory for Hibernate 2's 
Sessions.

This is a factory for JDO's 
PersistenceManager.

[ 329 ]
Using the Hibernate transaction manager
Setting up the transaction manger for a Hibernate application includes declaring 
factory and transaction manager objects in the Spring context, and then wiring them 
together, as shown here:
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
  <property name="driverClassName">
    <value>org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</value>

[ 330 ]
      class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateTransactionManager">
  <property name="sessionFactory">
    <ref local="sessionFactory"/>
  </property>
</bean>
As you can see, the configuration file includes three bean definitions: one for the 
data source, one for the factory object, and one for the transaction manager object. 
The SessionFactory object is configured with three properties: mappingResources, 
hibernateProperties, and dataSource, which specify the Hibernate mapping 
paths, the Hibernate configurable properties, and the data source that creates JDBC 
Connections, respectively. The TransactionManager is configured with only one 
property: sessionFactory.
Using the JTA transaction manager
You can use the JTA transaction manager in a Hibernate application when the 
application works with multiple databases. The configuration for using the JTA 
transaction manager is very similar to using a normal Hibernate transaction 
manager, as recently discussed. The difference is using JtaTransactionManager, 
instead of HibernateTransactionManager, and configuring it without a 
sessionFactory property. The following code shows how to use the JTA 
transaction manager:
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.
JndiObjectFactoryBean">
  <property name="jndiName">
    <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/MyDB</value>

      <!-- Other hbm files -->
      </list>
  </property>
  <property name="hibernateProperties">

</bean>
<bean id="transactionManager"
      class="org.springframework.transaction.jta.
JtaTransactionManager">
</bean>
Spring transaction configuration
When you've configured the SessionFactory and the transaction manager, you 
need to configure which methods to execute inside transactions. The configuration 
is similar to what you have already learned in Chapter 11 about AOP configuration. 
Similarly, you may use the classic bean definitions introduced by Spring 1.x, or the 
schema-based transaction configuration introduced by Spring 2.x. Additionally, 
Spring 2.x introduced an annotation-based transaction configuration. 
Although using Spring 2.x's new features is always recommended, 
you still have the option to use a classic bean configuration provided 
by Spring 1.x when you are using Spring 2.x.
The only difference between Spring 1.x and Spring 2.x transaction configuration has 
to do with interceptor and proxy configuration. In the following subsections, we'll 
look at both classic and schema-based interceptor and proxy configurations.
Transaction configuration in Spring 1.x
The transaction interceptor is configured as an instance of org.
springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionInterceptor. 
The TransactionInterceptor is an around advice, implementing the 
MethodInterceptor interface. TransactionInterceptor begins a transaction 
before target method execution, and commits the transaction after the 
method executes normally, without throwing an unchecked exception. 
TransactionInterceptor rolls back the transaction if an unchecked 
exception is thrown. Here's an example of interceptor configuration:
<bean id="transactionInterceptor"
      class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionInterceptor">

Transaction Management
[ 332 ]
  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
TransactionInterceptor is configured with two properties: transactionManager 
and transactionAttributes. The transactionManager refers to the configured 
transaction manager inside the Spring context. transactionAttributes lets you 
select target methods based on their names, and define transaction attributes, such 
as propagation behavior. In this example, this attribute uses * to indicate that all of 
the target methods must be executed inside transactions. We could specify another 
pattern, such as save*, which means only methods whose names start with the word 
save are executed inside a transaction. PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, as you have already 
seen, specifies how multiple transactions interact with each other. 
The TransactionInterceptor instance starts a transaction before the target 
method is invoked, and commits the transaction after the target method returns 
normally. If the target method throws an unchecked exception (thereby returning 
abnormally), TransactionInterceptor rolls back the transaction. However, if 
TransactionInterceptor encounters a checked exception, it ignores the exception 
and commits the transaction. You can also configure rollback conditions for the 
interceptor. For this purpose, append a comma-separated list of exception types, 
which must make transactions roll back to the transaction's propagation behavior. 
For example, transactionInterceptor can be configured as follows to indicate that 
throwing any type of exception rolls back a transaction:
<bean id="transactionInterceptor"
      class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionInterceptor">
  <property name="transactionManager" ref="transactionManager"/>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED, -Throwable</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
Each exception type must have a minus (-) symbol as 
a prefix.

Chapter 12
[ 333 ]
Proxy configuration
The proxy is another object that should be configured. This object intercepts calls 
to the target methods, and applies the configured transaction interceptor to the 
target methods. As you have already seen, Spring provides the general org.
springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean class as a proxy object 
to be configured inside the Spring context. The following code shows how this 
class can be used:
<bean id="transactionalStudentDao"
      class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="target">
    <ref local="studentDao"/>
  </property>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <idref bean="transactionInterceptor"/>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
As you can see, the transaction proxy is configured with two properties: target and 
interceptorNames. The target property refers to the target object, the method that 
must be executed inside a transaction. The interceptorNames property specifies a 
list of interceptors, including the transactionInterceptor, which must be applied 
to target method invocations. 
Remember to use the proxy, rather than the actual target object, in your other bean 
definitions that use the DAO bean.
Autoproxy creation
Spring provides an autoproxy approach to proxy advice and interceptors 
automatically, making XML configuration less verbose. Using this approach, 
you can declare an org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.
BeanNameAutoProxyCreator bean, which wraps all of the target objects and 
interceptors. When the target objects are invoked, it applies all of the interceptors to 
the target objects. The following snippet shows how this approach can be used for 
our example:
<bean class="org.springframework.aop.framework.autoproxy.
BeanNameAutoProxyCreator">
  <property name="beanNames">
    <list>
      <idref bean="studentDao"/>
    </list>

Transaction Management
[ 334 ]
  </property>
  <property name="interceptorNames">
    <list>
      <idref bean="transactionInterceptor"/>
    </list>
  </property>
</bean>
As you can see, the BeanNameAutoProxyCreator bean is configured with two 
properties: beanNames and interceptorNames. The beanNames specifies a list of 
transactional target objects, the objects that must be executed inside transactions. 
interceptorNames specifies the advice, including the transaction advice, applied 
to the target objects. This time, you can use the original studentDao bean in your 
other beans.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean
Using TransactionProxyFactoryBean is the easiest way to wrap a target object into 
a transaction proxy. It allows us to omit the TransactionInterceptor definition 
from the XML configuration and define a new bean, which wraps the target, 
interceptors, and transactionAttributes. The following code shows our 
example, which now is configured with TransactionProxyFactoryBean:
<bean id="transactionalStudentDao"
    class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="transactionManager">
    <ref bean="transactionManager"/>
  </property>
  <property name="target">
    <ref local="studentDao"/>
  </property>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="save*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
To use TransactionProxyFactoryBean, you should configure each transactional 
object as a separate bean. In this case, you must use this in place of the original 
studentDao bean.

Chapter 12
[ 335 ]
It's also possible to define the target object in the TransactionProxyFactoryBean 
definition, so there's no need for another bean:
<bean id="transactionalStudentDao"
    class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="transactionManager">
    <ref bean="transactionManager"/>
  </property>
  <property name="target">
    <bean class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch12.StudentDaoImpl">
      <property name="sessionFactory">
        <ref local="sessionFactory"/>
      </property>
    </bean>
  </property>
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="save*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
Transaction configuration in Spring 2.x
To use the convenient configuration features provided in Spring 2.x, you need to 
import the transaction schema to the Spring context as follows:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:tx="http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd
          http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx
          http://www.springframework.org/schema/tx/spring-tx.xsd">
    <!--transaction configuration here-->
</beans>

Transaction Management
[ 336 ]
The specific elements which can come for transaction configuration in the spring 
context are as follows:
spring-tx.xsd: This defines custom elements to make transaction 
configuration more convenient. The custom elements used for transaction 
configuration are as follows:
<tx:annotation-driven>: This configures the transaction 
manager with target classes, which are annotated with the 
Spring @Transactional annotation. (This relies on the Java 
annotation API, so it's not discussed in this book.)
<tx:advice>: This element declares a transaction as an 
advice to be applied to the target objects.
<tx:attributes>: This element configures a transaction 
advice. The configuration attributes include the propagation 
behavior, read-only flag, roll back for, and so on.
<tx:method>: This element specifies methods as target 
transactional methods.
The following code shows our example, which now has been refactored to use 
Spring 2.x's custom schema elements:
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.
JndiObjectFactoryBean">
  <property name="jndiName">
    <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/MyDB</value>

As you can see, only the transactionInterceptor and target declarations have 
changed. transactionInterceptor is defined as an advice. This advice is applied 
to all methods (*) of the target object. The <aop:advisor> element defines the target 
methods to which the declared advice is applied. This element uses a pointcut 
attribute to select target methods.
Another topic that may involve reliable data manipulation is caching. Caching, of 
course, is managed by Hibernate, so it always provides reliable data. However, this 
is a good place to look at Hibernate's caching mechanism, and see how it improves 
performance and provides reliable data. 
Caching
Interacting with a database is an expensive operation. This is due to the fact that any 
database interaction consists of sending a query request over the network, compiling 
the query on the database server, executing the query, producing the result, and 
finally sending the result back to the client. 

Transaction Management
[ 338 ]
Databases use different strategies to optimize performance. One of these strategies is 
caching the data for a period of time. Caching prevents unnecessary query compiling 
and disk I/O. Although the database-side caching strategy can be very effective 
(because it does not consider network traffic), this strategy has limited value when 
there are a large number of requests.
A typical strategy in this situation is an application-side cache mechanism. Instead 
of using the database to cache data, the application caches the data. When direct 
JDBC is used, the application is responsible for providing and managing the caching. 
However, Hibernate provides a rich, easy-to-use cache mechanism on two levels. 
Although the first-level cache is mandatory for all interactions (meaning that all 
database requests must pass through this level), the second-level cache is optional 
and configurable.
The first-level cache, provided by the Session object, holds the repetitive requested 
objects in memory and prevents Hibernate from loading an object multiple times. 
This cache can be discarded for an individual object by invoking the evict() 
method of the session object: 
public void evict(Object o) throws HibernateException
o is an object that you want to remove from the cache.
You can also use the clear() method to disable this cache for all objects:
public void clear()
The second-level cache is an external cache provided as a third-party project and 
plugged into Hibernate. The Session object accesses this cache transparently. Last 
figure in Chapter 3 shows the relationship of two caches with the session object 
inside Hibernate.
Hibernate lets us use any third-party cache implementation by providing the 
org.hibernate.cache.CacheProvider interface as the handler for interacting with 
that cache implementation. The implemented class should be specified through the 
hibernate.cache.provider_class property in the configuration file. The following 
table shows the cache providers which Hibernate currently supports. By default, 
Hibernate uses Ehcache for JVM-level caching:

All of the cache provider classes are in 
the org.hibernate.cache package.
Hibernate lets you configure the type of access to the second-level cache. You do this 
via an object of the org.hibernate.CacheMode class that is applied to a Session 
object by invoking its setCacheMode() method:
public void setCacheMode(CacheMode cacheMode)
This tells Hibernate how to interact with the second-level cache. For example, you 
can use CacheMode.IGNORE to tell Hibernate not to use the second-level cache in 
this particular Session. Suppose you are storing a huge number of students in the 
database. To reduce memory usage, you can disable the second-level cache by setting 
the cache mode of Session to org.hibernate.CacheMode.IGNORE as follows:
List students = ...//prepared through the business layer
Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.setCacheMode(CacheMode.IGNORE);
         
for (int i = 0; i < students.size(); i++) {
  session.save(students.get(i));
  if (i % 20 == 0) {
    session.flush();
    session.clear();
  }
}
tx.commit();
session.close();

Transaction Management
[ 340 ]
In this example, the first-level cache is flushed for every 20 objects stored. 
The following table shows the cache modes that can be applied to Session 
objects. Notice that all of these modes have been defined as static members in 
the CacheMode class:
Cache Mode
Description
IGNORE
This mode specifies that items are never read from, or written to the 
second-level cache.
REFRESH
This mode indicates that items are written to the second-level cache, 
but are not read from it. This mode bypasses the effect of hibernate.
cache.use_minimal_puts, forcing a refresh of the second-level cache 
for all items read from the database.
PUT
The second-level cache is only applied to put (write) requests, but 
Hibernate won't read from the second-level cache.
GET
The second-level cache is only applied to get (read) requests, but 
Hibernate won't write to the second-level cache, except when 
updating data.
NORMAL
This is the normal behavior, reading items from and writing items to the 
second-level cache.
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the fundamental concepts behind transactions and 
caching, and how they are implemented in Hibernate.
Conceptually, a transaction is a group of operations that must be done reliably 
against a database or any other resource. Every transaction is specified by its so-
called ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Of these 
properties, only atomicity and isolation are of concern to the application developer. 
The other two are implemented internally by the transactional resource. 
Hibernate allows you to configure transaction isolation through the configuration 
file. This is done through the hibernate.connection.isolation entry in the 
configuration file with a value defined as a static member of the java.sql.
Connection interface. 
Regarding atomicity, you need to obtain a Transaction object before any operation 
by invoking the beginTransaction() method of Session. You can decide to 
commit or roll back the transaction by calling either the commit() or the 
rollback() method. 

Chapter 12
[ 341 ]
Transactions also have other configurable characteristics, called transaction 
attributes. These include transaction timeout, transaction propagation, and 
read-only flag. 
Spring provides a transaction API to abstract the application code from the specific 
transaction API exposed by different persistence technologies. Moreover, Spring lets 
you apply transactions as advice to the target transactional objects. To use the Spring 
transaction API, you must configure a transaction manager, a transaction interceptor, 
and target transactional objects. The transaction manager is the object that delegates 
transaction invocation to the underlying transaction API. The transaction interceptor 
is an around advice, applying transactions as advice to the target transactional 
objects. To configure these objects, you may use classic bean configuration exposed 
through Spring 1.x, or schema-based bean configuration provided by Spring 2.x. 
Hibernate also provides caching in two levels to enhance persistence performance. 
Although the first-level cache is provided by the session objects and cannot be 
disabled, the second-level cache is served by third-party cache projects plugged into 
Hibernate. The second-level cache is configurable and can be disabled. You can also 
configure Hibernate to indicate how it should interact with the second-level cache. 
This is done by the setCacheMode() method of Session, with a value defined as a 
static member of the CacheMode class. 


Integrating Hibernate 
with Spring
As you've seen, Spring is a general-purpose framework that plays different roles in 
many areas of application architecture. One of these areas is persistence. Spring does 
not provide its own persistence framework. Instead, it provides an abstraction layer 
over JDBC, and a variety of O/R mapping frameworks, such as iBATIS SQL Maps, 
Hibernate, JDO, Apache OJB, and Oracle TopLink. This abstraction allows consistent, 
manageable data-access implementation. 
Spring's abstraction layer abstracts the application from the connection factory, 
the transaction API, and the exception hierarchies used by the underlying 
persistence technology. Application code always uses the Spring API to work with 
connection factories, utilizes Spring strategies for transaction management, and 
involves Spring's generic exception hierarchy to handle underlying exceptions. 
Spring sits between the application classes and the O/R mapping tool, undertakes 
transactions, and manages connection objects. It translates the underlying persistence 
exceptions thrown by Hibernate to meaningful, unchecked exceptions of type 
DataAccessException. Moreover, Spring provides IoC and AOP, which can 
be used in the persistence layer. 
In the previous chapter, you learned about transaction management 
strategies for a Hibernate application. You also learned how Spring undertakes 
Hibernate's transactions and provides a more powerful, comprehensive approach 
to transaction management. 
This chapter discusses how Spring affects the application's data-access layer. Our 
discussion starts with the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. This pattern, which 
is popular in the Java world, allows for a more manageable, more maintainable 
data-access tier. Then, we'll discuss how Spring affects application DAO classes 
when integrated with Hibernate. 

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 344 ]
The Data Access Object pattern
Although you can obtain a Session object and connect to Hibernate anywhere in 
the application, it's recommended that all interactions with Hibernate be done only 
through distinct classes. Regarding this, there is a JEE design pattern, called the 
DAO pattern. According to the DAO pattern, all persistent operations should be 
performed via specific classes, technically called DAO classes. These classes are used 
exclusively for communicating with the data tier. The purpose of this pattern is to 
separate persistence-related code from the application's business logic, which makes 
for more manageable and maintainable code, letting you change the persistence 
strategy flexibly, without changing the business rules or workflow logic. 
The DAO pattern states that we should define a DAO interface corresponding to 
each DAO class. This DAO interface outlines the structure of a DAO class, defines 
all of the persistence operations that the business layer needs, and (in Spring-based 
applications) allows us to apply IoC to decouple the business layer from the 
DAO class.
Service Facade Pattern
In implementation of data access tier, the Service Facade Pattern is always used in 
addition to the DAO pattern. This pattern indicates using an intermediate object, 
called service object, between all business tier objects and DAO objects. The service 
object assembles the DAO methods to be managed as a unit of work. Note that only 
one service class is created for all DAOs that are implemented in each use case.
The service class uses instances of DAO interfaces to interact with them. These 
instances are instantiated from the concrete DAO classes by the IoC container 
at runtime. Therefore, the service object is unaware of the actual DAO 
implementation details. 
Regardless of the persistence strategy your application uses (even if it 
uses direct JDBC), applying the DAO and Service Facade patterns to 
decouple application tiers is highly recommended. 

Chapter 13
[ 345 ]
Data tier implementation with Hibernate
Let's now see how the discussed patterns are applied to the application that directly 
uses Hibernate. The following code shows a sample DAO interface:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import java.util.Collection;
public interface StudentDao {
  public Student getStudent(long id);
  public Collection getAllStudents();
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents();
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName);
  public void saveStudent(Student std);
  public void removeStudent(Student std);
}
The following code shows a DAO class that implements this DAO interface:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.hibernate.Query;
import java.util.Collection;
public class HibernateStudentDao implements StudentDao {
  SessionFactory sessionFactory;
  public Student getStudent(long id) {
    Student student = null;
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      student = (Student) session.get(Student.class, new Long(id));
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;
    } finally {

      session.close();
    }
    return student;
  }
  public Collection getAllStudents(){
    Collection allStudents = null;
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      Query query = session.createQuery(
             "from Student std order by std.lastName, std.firstName");
      allStudents = query.list();
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
    return allStudents;
  }
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents(){
    Collection graduatedStudents = null;
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      Query query = session.createQuery(
                        "from Student std where std.status=1");
      graduatedStudents = query.list();
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;
    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
    return graduatedStudents;
  }

Chapter 13
[ 347 ]
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName) {
    Collection students = null;
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      Query query = session.createQuery(
                  "from Student std where std.lastName like ?");
      query.setString(1, lastName + "%");
      students = query.list();
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;
    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
    return students;
  }
  public void saveStudent(Student std) {
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      session.saveOrUpdate(std);
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;
    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
  }
  public void removeStudent(Student std) {
    Session session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
    Transaction tx = null;
    try {
      tx = session.beginTransaction();
      session.delete(std);

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 348 ]
      tx.commit();
      tx = null;
    } catch (HibernateException e) {
      if (tx != null)
        tx.rollback();
      throw e;
    } finally {
      session.close();
    }
  }
  public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
    this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
  }
}
As you can see, all implemented methods do routines. All obtain a Session object 
at first, get a Transaction object, perform a persistence operation, commit the 
transaction, rollback the transaction if exception occurs, and finally close the Session 
object. Each method contains much boilerplate code that is very similar to the 
other methods. 
Although applying the DAO pattern to the persistence code leads to more 
manageable and maintainable code, the DAO classes still include much boilerplate 
code. Each DAO method must obtain a Session instance, start a transaction, perform 
the persistence operation, and commit the transaction. Additionally, each DAO 
method should include its own duplicated exception-handling implementation. 
These are exactly the problems that motivate us to use Spring with Hibernate. 
Template Pattern
To clean the code and provide more manageable code, Spring utilizes 
a pattern called Template Pattern. By this pattern, a template object 
wraps all of the boilerplate repetitive code. Then, this object delegates the 
persistence calls as a part of functionality in the template. In the Hibernate 
case, HibernateTemplate extracts all of the boilerplate code, such as 
obtaining a Session, performing transaction, and handing exceptions.

Chapter 13
[ 349 ]
Data tier implementation with Spring
With Spring, you do not need to implement code for obtaining Session objects, 
starting and committing transactions, and handling Hibernate exceptions. Instead, 
you use a HibernateTemplate instance to delegate persistence calls to Hibernate, 
without direct interaction with Hibernate. 
Here are some benefits of using Spring in the persistence layer, instead of using 
direct interaction with Hibernate:
With Spring, the HibernateTemplate object interacts with Hibernate. This 
object removes the boilerplate code from DAO implementations.
Any invocation of one of HibernateTemplate's methods throws the 
generic DataAccessException exception instead of HibernateException (a 
Hibernate-specific exception).
Spring lets us demarcate transactions declaratively, instead of implementing 
duplicated transaction-management code. 
The HibernateTemplate class uses a SessionFactory instance internally to obtain 
Session objects for Hibernate interaction. Interestingly, you can configure the 
SessionFactory object via the Spring IoC container to be instantiated and injected 
into DAO objects. 
The next sections discuss how HibernateTemplate is used in DAO classes, and how 
it is configured with SessionFactory in the Spring IoC container. First, let's look at 
the Spring exception hierarchy. 
Spring exception translation
Spring provides its own exception hierarchy, which sits on the exception hierarchies 
of the O/R mapping tools it supports. It catches any database exception or error 
that might be thrown through JDBC, or the underlying O/R mapping tool, and 
translates the caught exception to a corresponding exception in its own hierarchy. 
The Spring exception hierarchy is defined as a subclass of org.springframework.
dao.DataAccessException. Spring catches any exception thrown in the underlying 
persistence technology and wraps it in a DataAccessException instance. The 
DataAccessException object is an unchecked exception, because it extends 
RuntimeException and you do not need to catch it if you do not want to.

[ 350 ]
Refactoring DAO classes to use Spring
Spring provides distinct DAO base classes for the different data-access technologies 
it supports. For instance, Spring provides HibernateDaoSupport for Hibernate, 
SqlMapClientDaoSupport for iBATIS SQL Maps, and JdoDaoSupport for JDO. 
These classes wrap the common properties and methods that are required in all 
DAO implementation subclasses. 
When you use Hibernate with Spring, the DAO classes extend the Spring 
org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.support.HibernateDaoSupport 
class. This class wraps an instance of org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateTemplate, which in turn wraps an org.hibernate.SessionFactory 
instance. As you will soon see in this chapter, extending the HibernateDaoSupport 
class lets you configure all DAO implementations consistently as beans inside the 
Spring IoC container. Their SessionFactory property is configured and set up via 
the Spring context. 
The following code shows a simple DAO interface for a Spring-based DAO 
implementation:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import java.util.Collection;
public interface StudentDao {
  public Student getStudent(long id);
  public Collection getAllStudents();
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents();
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName);
  public void saveStudent(Student std);
  public void removeStudent(Student std);
}
Here, StudentDao is the DAO interface, with the same structure as the interface 
shown in the following code.
HibernateException is thrown for any failure when directly 
interacting with Hibernate. When Spring is used, HibernateException 
is caught by Spring and translated to DataAccessException for any 
persistence failure. Both exceptions are unchecked, so you do not need to 
catch them if you don't want to do.

Chapter 13
[ 351 ]
The following code shows the DAO implementation for this DAO interface, which 
now uses Spring to interact with Hibernate:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.support.HibernateDaoSupport;
import java.util.Collection;
public class HibernateStudentDao extends HibernateDaoSupport 
implementsStudentDao {
  public Student getStudent(long id) {
    return (Student) getHibernateTemplate().get(Student.class, new
     Long(id));
  }
  public Collection getAllStudents(){
    return getHibernateTemplate().
      find("from Student std order by std.lastName, std.firstName");
  }
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents(){
    return getHibernateTemplate().find("from Student std where
     std.status=1");
  }
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName) {
    return getHibernateTemplate().
      find("from Student std where std.lastName like ?", lastName + 
"%");
  }
  public void saveStudent(Student std) {
    getHibernateTemplate().saveOrUpdate(std);
  }
  public void removeStudent(Student std) {
    getHibernateTemplate().delete(std);
  }
}
Notice that the DAO class still implements the DAO interface, which outlines all of 
the persistent operations implemented by the DAO class. As you can see, all of the 
persistent methods in the DAO class use the getHibernateTemplate() method 
to access the HibernateTemplate object. As you saw in the previous section, 
HibernateTemplate is a Spring convenience class that delegates DAO calls to the 
Hibernate Session API. This class exposes all of Hibernate's Session methods, as 
well as a variety of other convenient methods that DAO classes may need. Because 
HibernateTemplate convenient methods are not exposed by the Session interface, 
you can use find() and findByCriteria() when you want to execute HQL 
or create a Criteria object. Additionally, it wraps all of the underlying 
exceptions thrown by the Session method with instances of the unchecked 
org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException. 

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 352 ]
For convenience, I recommend using the HibernateDaoSupport class as the base 
class for all Hibernate DAO implementations, but you can ignore this class and work 
directly with a HibernateTemplate instance in DAO classes. To do so, define a 
property of HibernateTemplate in the DAO class, which is initialized and set up 
via the Spring IoC container. 
The following code shows the DAO class, which now uses HibernateTemplate 
directly. Note that this approach is not recommended because it gets you 
involved with the HibernateTemplate object in both the DAO class and the 
DAO configuration in the Spring context:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate;
import java.util.Collection;
public class HibernateStudentDao implements StudentDao {
  HibernateTemplate hibernateTemplate;
  public Student getStudent(long id) {
    return (Student) getHibernateTemplate().get(Student.class, new
Long(id));
  }
  public Collection getAllStudents(){
    return getHibernateTemplate().
      find("from Student std order by std.lastName, std.firstName");
  }
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents(){
    return getHibernateTemplate().find("from Student std where
std.status=1");
  }
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName) {
    return getHibernateTemplate().
      find("from Student std where std.lastName like "+ lastName + 
"%");
  }
  public void saveStudent(Student std) {
    getHibernateTemplate().saveOrUpdate(std);
  }
  public void removeStudent(Student std) {
    getHibernateTemplate().delete(std);
  }
  public HibernateTemplate getHibernateTemplate() {
    return hibernateTemplate;
  }
  public void setHibernateTemplate(HibernateTemplate 
hibernateTemplate) {
    this.hibernateTemplate = hibernateTemplate;
  }
}

Chapter 13
[ 353 ]
The DAO class now has the setHibernateTemplate() method to allow Spring to 
inject the configured HibernateTemplate instance into the DAO object.
Moreover, the DAO class can abandon the HibernateTemplate class and use 
the SessionFactory instance directly to interact with Hibernate. The following 
code shows HibernateStudentDao, which now works directly with the 
SessionFactory object:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.Query;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils;
import java.util.Collection;
public class HibernateStudentDao implements StudentDao {
  SessionFactory sessionFactory;
  public Student getStudent(long id) {
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      return (Student) session.get(Student.class, new Long(id));
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);
    }
  }
  public Collection getAllStudents(){
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      Query query = session.createQuery(
                  "from Student std order by std.lastName, std.
firstName");
      Collection allStudents = query.list();
      return allStudents;
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 354 ]
    }
  }
  public Collection getGraduatedStudents(){
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      Query query = session.createQuery("from Student std where std.
status=1");
      Collection graduatedStudents = query.list();
      return graduatedStudents;
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);
    }
  }
  public Collection findStudents(String lastName) {
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      Query query = session.createQuery(
                  "from Student std where std.lastName like ?");
      query.setString(1, lastName + "%");
      Collection students = query.list();
      return students;
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);
    }
  }
  public void saveStudent(Student std) {
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      session.save(std);
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);
    }

Chapter 13
[ 355 ]
  }
  public void removeStudent(Student std) {
    Session session = SessionFactoryUtils.getSession(this.
sessionFactory,
true);
    try {
      session.delete(std);
    } catch (HibernateException ex) {
      throw SessionFactoryUtils.convertHibernateAccessException(ex);
    } finally {
      SessionFactoryUtils.closeSession(session);
    }
  }
  public void setSessionFactory(SessionFactory sessionFactory) {
    this.sessionFactory = sessionFactory;
  }
}
In all of the methods above, the SessionFactoryUtils class is used to obtain a 
Session object. The provided Session object is then used to perform the persistence 
operation. SessionFactoryUtils is also used to translate HibernateException 
to DataAccessException in the catch blocks and close the Session objects in 
the final blocks. Note that this DAO implementation bypasses the advantages of 
HibernateDaoSupport and HibernateTemplate. You must manage Hibernate's 
Session manually (as well as exception translation and transaction management) 
and implement much boilerplate code. 
org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.SessionFactoryUtils 
is a Spring helper class for obtaining Session, reusing Session within 
transactions, and translating HibernateException to the generic 
DataAccessException.
This way is absolutely not the way to work with Session in Spring. Always use 
the HibernateTemplate class to work with Session objects behind the scenes. 
However, in cases where you need to work directly with Session objects, you 
can use an implementation of the org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateCallback interface as the handler to work with Sessions. 
The following code snippet shows how this approach is:
public void saveStudent(Student std) {
  HibernateCallback callback = new HibernateCallback() {
   public Object doInHibernate(Session session) throws 
HibernateException,

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 356 ]
SQLException {
    return session.saveOrUpdate(std);
   }
  };
  getHibernateTemplate().execute(callback);
  
 }
In this code, an implicit implementation of HibernateCallback is created and its 
only doInHibernate() method is implemented. The doInHibernate() method 
takes an object of Session and returns the result of persistence operation, null if 
none. The HibernateCallback object is then passed to the execute() method of 
HibernateTemplate to be executed. The doInHibernate() method just provides a 
handler to work directly with Session objects that are obtained and used behind 
the scenes.
Configuring Hibernate in a Spring 
context
As discussed in Chapter 10, Spring provides the LocalSessionFactoryBean class 
as a factory for a SessionFactory object. The LocalSessionFactoryBean object is 
configured as a bean inside the IoC container, with either a local JDBC DataSource 
or a shared DataSource from JNDI.
The local JDBC DataSource can be configured in turn as an object of org.apache.
commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource in the Spring context:
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource">
  <property name="driverClassName">
    <value>org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver</value>
  </property>
  <property name="url">
    <value>jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost/hiberdb</value>
  </property>
  <property name="username">
    <value>sa</value>
  </property>
  <property name="password">
    <value></value>
  </property>
</bean>

Chapter 13
[ 357 ]
In this case, the org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource (the Jakarta 
Commons Database Connection Pool) must be in the application classpath.
Similarly, a shared DataSource can be configured as an object of 
org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean. This is the 
recommended way, which is used when the connection pool is managed 
by the application server. Here is the way to configure it:
<bean id="dataSource" class="org.springframework.jndi.
JndiObjectFactoryBean">
  <property name="jndiName">
    <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/HiberDB</value>
  </property>
</bean> 
When the DataSource is configured, you can configure the 
LocalSessionFactoryBean instance upon the configured DataSource as follows: 
<bean id="sessionFactory"
            class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
LocalSessionFactoryBean">
    <property name="dataSource">
        <ref bean="dataSource"/>
    </property>
    …
</bean>
Alternatively, you may set up the SessionFactory object as a server-side resource 
object in the Spring context. This object is linked in as a JNDI resource in the JEE 
environment to be shared with multiple applications. In this case, you need to use 
JndiObjectFactoryBean instead of LocalSessionFactoryBean:
<bean id="sessionFactory" class="org.springframework.jndi.
JndiObjectFactoryBean">
  <property name="jndiName">
    <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/hiberDBSessionFactory</value>
  </property>
</bean>
JndiObjectFactoryBean is another factory bean for looking up any JNDI resource. 
When you use JndiObjectFactoryBean to obtain a preconfigured 
SessionFactory object, the SessionFactory object should 
already be registered as a JNDI resource. For this purpose, you may 
run a server-specific class which creates a SessionFactory object 
and registers it as a JNDI resource. 

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 358 ]
LocalSessionFactoryBean uses three properties: datasource, mappingResources, 
and hibernateProperties. These properties are as follows:
datasource refers to a JDBC DataSource object that is already defined as 
another bean inside the container. 
mappingResources specifies the Hibernate mapping files located in the 
application classpath. 
hibernateProperties determines the Hibernate configuration settings. 
We have the sessionFactory object configured as follows:
<bean id="sessionFactory"
      class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
LocalSessionFactoryBean">
  <property name="dataSource">
    <ref bean="dataSource"/>
  </property>
  <property name="mappingResources">
    <list>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Student.hbm.xml</value>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Teacher.hbm.xml</value>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Course.hbm.xml</value>
    </list>
  </property>
  <property name="hibernateProperties">
    <props>
      <prop key="hibernate.dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.
HSQLDialect</prop>
      <prop key="hibernate.show_sql">true</prop>
      <prop key="hibernate.max_fetch_depth">2</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
The mappingResources property loads mapping definitions 
in the classpath. You may use mappingJarLocations, or 
mappingDirectoryLocations to load them from a JAR file, 
or from any directory of the file system, respectively.

Chapter 13
[ 359 ]
It is still possible to configure Hibernate with hibernate.cfg.xml, instead of 
configuring Hibernate as just shown. To do so, configure sessionFactory with the 
configLocation property, as follows:
<bean id="sessionFactory"
      class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
LocalSessionFactoryBean">
  <property name="dataSource">
    <ref bean="dataSource"/>
  </property>
  <property name="configLocation">
    <value>/conf/hibernate.cfg.xml</value>
  </property>
</bean>
Note that hibernate.cfg.xml specifies the Hibernate mapping definitions in 
addition to the other Hibernate properties.
When the SessionFactory object is configured, you can configure DAO 
implementations as beans in the Spring context. These DAO beans are the objects 
which are looked up from the Spring IoC container and consumed by the business 
layer. Here is an example of DAO configuration:
<bean id="studentDao"
class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13.HibernateStudentDao">
  <property name="sessionFactory">
    <ref local="sessionFactory"/>
  </property>
</bean>
This is the DAO configuration for a DAO class that extends HibernateDaoSupport, 
or directly uses a SessionFactory property. When the DAO class has a 
HibernateTemplate property, configure the DAO instance as follows:
<bean id="studentDao" class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13.
HibernateStudentDao">
  <property name="hibernateTemplate">
    <bean class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateTemplate">
      <constructor-arg>
        <ref local="sessionFactory"/>
      </constructor-arg>
    </bean>
  </property>
</bean>

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 360 ]
According to the preceding declaration, the HibernateStudentDao class has 
a hibernateTemplate property that is configured via the IoC container, to be 
initialized through constructor injection and a SessionFactory instance as a 
constructor argument.
Now, any client of the DAO implementation can look up the Spring context to obtain 
the DAO instance. The following code shows a simple class that creates a Spring 
application context, and then looks up the DAO object from the Spring IoC container:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13;
    
public class DaoClient {
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ApplicationContext ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(
                       "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/
applicationContext.xml");
    ����������������������������������������������������������
StudentDao stdDao = (StudentDao)ctx.getBean("studentDao");
    ����������������������������
Student std = new Student();
    
    //set std properties
    
    //save std
    stdDao.saveStudent(std);
  }
}
Spring transaction management
One reason to integrate Hibernate with Spring is transaction management. Spring 
provides a transaction abstraction layer over the Hibernate transaction API, and 
enables persistent operations to participate in global transactions. Moreover, Spring 
provides declarative transaction demarcation, which produces more readable and 
maintainable Java code. The declarative approach lets us change the transaction 
strategy easily, without changing the code. 
The Spring transaction demarcation API has two classes for working with 
Hibernate applications: 
org.springframework.transaction.support.TransactionTemplate for 
a programmatic approach.
org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean for a declarative approach.

Chapter 13
[ 361 ]
Behind this API, you may use one of Spring's two transaction managers:
org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTransactionManager: 
Use this when the application involves a single data source and Hibernate 
alone is needed. This covers local transactions executed on a single 
SessionFactory. This manager is commonly used, since most Hibernate 
applications work with a single database. 
org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager: This 
is Spring's global JTA transaction manager. Use it when the application 
participates in global transactions in a Java EE environment, in which 
multiple SessionFactory methods are involved, and transactions are 
scattered over them. 
Note that we can develop DAO classes that are not involved in transaction 
management. This is an advantage Spring provides for the application, so that all 
DAO classes work with transactional Session objects provided behind the scenes by 
the Spring IoC container. 
You configure Spring's transactions by setting up the transaction-manager instance 
as a bean inside the IoC container. The bean configuration depends on which 
transaction strategy you are using: local or global. 
Lets look at the transaction configuration in detail. 
Local transactions
When the application uses only a single data source (a single SessionFactory 
in Hibernate), you can define the transaction manager as an instance of 
HibernateTransactionManager as follows:
<bean id="transactionManager"
      class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateTransactionManager">
  <property name="sessionFactory">
    <ref bean="sessionFactory"/>
  </property>
</bean>
•
•

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 362 ]
Then, define DAO and Service beans, respectively, as instances of the DAO and 
service classes. Here is an example:
<bean id="persistenceService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13.PersistenceService">
    <property name="studentDao">
      <ref bean="studentDao"/>
    </property>
  </bean>
<bean id="studentDao"
      class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch13.HibernateStudentDao">
  <property name="sessionFactory">
    <ref bean="sessionFactory"/>
  </property>
</bean>
Finally, the DAO instances are wrapped in a proxy transaction. As you saw in 
Chapter 11, transactions are cross-cutting concerns that are not dedicated to the 
function of a particular method. Instead, they are scattered over many persistence 
methods. With Spring, DAO functionality can be split into two modules: 
DAO implementations, which perform persistence operations. 
Transaction advice, which defines how persistence operations are performed 
in transactions. 
Modularizing DAO implementations to carry out persistence operations, and not 
transaction management, avoids boilerplate transaction-management code in every 
persistence method. To apply transaction advice to the target methods in the DAO 
implementations, we need proxy objects. 
Each proxy is an object that intermediates between two other objects (a calling object 
and an invoked object), and applies a concern (a transaction in our case) to the object 
invocation. Actually, the business layer always works with instances of proxies 
instead of service objects. Here is an example of the transaction proxy definition:
<bean id="studentDao"
class="org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
       TransactionProxyFactoryBean">
  <property name="transactionManager">
    <ref bean="transactionManager"/>
  </property>
  <property name="target">
    <ref bean="persistenceService"/>
  </property>
•
•

Chapter 13
[ 363 ]
  <property name="transactionAttributes">
    <props>
      <prop key="save*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
      <prop key="*">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
    </props>
  </property>
</bean>
As you saw in Chapter 12, the TransactionProxyFactoryBean object is configured 
with three properties: 
transactionManager, declared as an individual bean, is an object which 
provides an abstraction API between the application code and Hibernate 
transaction API. 
target represents the object to which the transaction concern must 
be applied. 
transactionAttributes defines how to select the transactional methods. 
For instance, save* selects all methods of the target object that start with the 
save word. 
In our example, PROPAGATION_REQUIRED and readOnly specify, respectively, how 
multiple transactions participate, and whether the transaction is allowed to only read 
the data. 
Global transactions
You can configure Spring to use global transactions for synchronizing persistent 
operations that are performed in a Java EE environment across multiple data sources. 
The configuration process is similar to configuring a local transaction, but you need 
to define multiple data sources, as well as multiple SessionFactory and DAOs. 
The transaction-manager object is now defined as an instance of 
JtaTransactionManager, instead of HibernateTransactionManager. 
Here is an example: 
<beans>
  <!-- the datasource1 declartion, registered to node ds1 on the JNDI 
tree-->  
<bean id="datasource1" class="org.springframework.jndi.
JndiObjectFactoryBean">
    <property name="jndiName">
      <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/ds1</value>

Integrating Hibernate with Spring
[ 366 ]
Alternatively, you can configure the transaction manager as a bean of type 
JndiObjectFactoryBean in the IoC container. JndiObjectFactoryBean is a factory 
bean which obtains the transaction-manager object by looking up a JNDI resource. If 
you choose this strategy, the SessionFactory configuration changes as follows: 
<bean id="sessionFactory"
      class="org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
LocalSessionFactoryBean">
  <property name="dataSource">
    <ref bean="dataSource"/>
  </property>
  <property name="jtaTransactionManager">
    <ref bean="transactionManager"/>
  </property>
  <property name="mappingResources">
    <list>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Student.hbm.xml</value>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Teacher.hbm.xml</value>
      <value>com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch13/Course.hbm.xml</value>
    </list>
  </property>
  <property name="hibernateProperties">
    <props>
      <prop key="hibernate.dialect">
        ���������������������������������
org.hibernate.dialect.HSQLDialect
      </prop>
    ��������
</props>
  </property>
</bean>
You must also configure a transaction-manager object: 
<bean id="transactionManager"
      class="org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean">
  <property name="jndiName">
    <value>java:comp/env/jdbc/mytm</value>
  </property>
</bean>
In this way, we configured transactionManager as a bean produced by 
JndiObjectFactoryBean. This factory bean returns transaction-manager objects by 
looking up a server-specific JNDI location. 
Please refer to Chapter 12 for more details about transaction management.

Chapter 13
[ 367 ]
Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the Data Access Object (DAO) pattern. This 
pattern allows all interaction with the data tier to be done through specific classes, 
called DAO classes. According to this pattern, a DAO interface is defined to 
correspond to each DAO class, defining all persistent operations that the business 
layer needs. The main goal is to decouple the business layer from the data layer. 
DAO interfaces are the only references that the business layer uses to perform 
persistent operations. At this point, Spring is configured to instantiate these 
references with the actual implementations at runtime. 
You can integrate Hibernate with Spring to simplify DAO implementation. Spring 
provides a transaction abstraction layer on the local transaction API provided by 
Hibernate, and allows declarative transaction demarcation. Moreover, it converts 
HibernateException into Spring's generic DataAccessException hierarchy, and 
allows the use of IoC in the data tier. 
Spring supports DAO implementation with two helper classes: org.
springframework.orm.hibernate3.HibernateTemplate and org.
springframework.orm.hibernate3.support.HibernateDaoSupport. All 
DAO classes extend HibernateDaoSupport and use HibernateTemplate 
to perform persistent operations. Spring provides org.springframework.
orm.hibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBean as a factory bean to configure 
and set up a SessionFactory object in an IoC-style manner. For transaction 
management, Spring provides org.springframework.orm.hibernate3.
HibernateTransactionManager and org.springframework.transaction.jta.
JtaTransactionManager for managing local and global transactions, respectively. 
Moreover, Spring provides org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.
TransactionProxyFactoryBean, which acts as a proxy to apply transaction 
concerns to persistent operations.


Web Development with 
Hibernate and Spring
Most enterprises applications today provide a web-based user interface to interact 
with end users. This means Hibernate and Spring developers often encounter 
situations involving web development. The problem is that the JSP and servlet 
technologies typically used to produce dynamic web content are not simple Java 
classes to be configured in the Spring context. 
This chapter begins by exploring how Model-View-Controller (MVC) web 
frameworks are integrated with Spring, and then briefly discusses the Spring 
MVC components and features.
When a web application uses Hibernate without Spring, every JSP page 
or servlet class can simply obtain a service object to interact with the 
business layer, and persist the entity objects via Hibernate behind the 
scenes. The problem is when Hibernate and Spring are used together, we 
expect Spring to inject objects via IoC in JSP or Servlet pages. As soon as 
you obtain Spring-managed objects in JSP pages or servlet classes, you 
can interact with Hibernate via the Spring-managed service objects.

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 370 ]
Problem definition
Let's take a simple portion of our sample application to explain how to use Spring 
in web applications. Consider this use case: the user submits a web request with a 
student identifier to see a student's details. The web layer of the application obtains a 
StudentService instance by looking up the Spring context. The StudentService is 
configured as a bean in applicationContext.xml, as follows:
<bean id="studentService"
      class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch14.StudentService">
  <property name="studentDao">
    <ref local="studentDao"/>
  </property>
</bean>
The web layer then uses the getStudent() method on the StudentService instance 
to get the requested student. The getStudent() method signature provided by 
StudentService is as follows:
public Student getStudent(String studentId)
In upcoming sections, we will discuss how each web technology deals with this 
problem. Before we do that though, let's look at the basic configuration that is 
always applied to each framework. 
Common configuration for Spring integration
Web applications include JSP pages and servlets, which provide dynamic content for 
end users. To integrate web applications with Spring, we must access Spring services 
in these JSP pages and servlets. Fortunately, we can do this using ServletContext, a 
long-lived object initialized at application startup that's accessible in every JSP page 
and servlet. The servlet specification also defines that we can implement a context 
listener to execute customized behavior when the ServletContext is initialized or 
destroyed. Using the ServletContext and a context listener, we can load the Spring 
context at application startup, and store the loaded context in ServletContext. 
Spring provides org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener 
as the context listener, which loads the Spring context, and stores it in the 
ServletContext. To use this listener, you need to configure it in web.xml, as follows:
<web-app>
  <listener>
    <listener-class>
      org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener
    </listener-class>
  </listener>
  ...
</web-app>

Chapter 14
[ 371 ]
By default, ContextLoaderListener loads the Spring context file named 
applicationContext.xml located in the application's /WEB-INF directory. 
However, you can load a Spring context with another name or location. For this 
purpose, you can use the <context-param> element in web.xml to specify the 
name and location of the Spring context, as follows:
<web-app>
  <context-param>
    <param-name>contextConfigLocation</param-name>
    <param-value>/springContext.xml</param-value>
  </context-param>
  <listener>
    <listener-class>
      org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener
    </listener-class>
  </listener>
  ...
</web-app>
This example specifies springContext.xml as the name of the Spring context file, 
which is located in the web application's root directory.
Spring provides org.springframework.web.context.support.
WebApplicationContextUtils as a utility class to access the Spring context in a JSP 
page. This class provides the following two static methods to access the application 
context stored in the ServletContext:
public static WebApplicationContext 
  getRequiredWebApplicationContext(ServletContext sc)
and
public static WebApplicationContext getWebApplicationContext
(ServletContext sc)
These methods do the same job with the only difference that if no Spring 
context is found, the getWebApplicationContext() method returns null, but 
getRequiredWebApplicationContext() throws an IllegalStateException. The 
following code shows how you can call getRequiredWebApplicationContext()in a 
JSP page to obtain the ApplicationContext:
ApplicationContext context =
    WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(
     application);
application represents the ServletContext object that is provided by the web 
container in all JSP pages.

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 372 ]
The getRequiredWebApplicationContext() method is useful when 
the context is absolutely required, and you need the application to treat 
the absence of the Spring context file as an error.
You may use the same code to obtain the Spring context in a servlet class, but you 
need to obtain the ServletContext via the getServletContext() method, instead 
of using the application variable, as follows: 
ServletContext sContext = getServletContext();
ApplicationContext appContext =
WebApplicationContextUtils.getRequiredWebApplicationContext(sContext);
Before discussing how to integrate practical web frameworks with Spring, let's look 
at the common MVC pattern implemented by web frameworks.
The MVC architectural pattern
The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern's purpose is to decouple user 
interfaces, data, and business logic, which are called views, models, and 
controllers, respectively. This separation simplifies application architecture and 
makes development, testing, and maintenance easier. This architecture avoids code 
duplication in many situations, and provides reusability in views, models, and 
business logic. 
All web frameworks implement the MVC pattern. The following figure depicts the 
basic scenario that is accomplished in web frameworks for a typical user request:
Client
(Web Browser)
Server
(Web Server)
Controller
Model
View
The controller is an object that processes the request, updates the model object, and 
forwards the request to the view. The JSP page uses the updated model to generate 
output for the user. 

Chapter 14
[ 373 ]
The following list provides a summary of the MVC components in web frameworks:
Model components: These components provide an interface to the data 
and services used by the application. In some cases, model components 
are simple value objects, represented as instances of simple JavaBeans, 
transmitted between view and controller components. However, model 
components can be more complex and include business logic to access and 
manipulate data, such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs). Model components 
allow controller components to work transparently with view components. 
View components: These components are responsible for generating 
the application view, which is what the user sees, based on the model 
components. Most of the time, view components are simple JSP or HTML 
pages. However, they can be of any other type, such as PDFs.
Controller components: These components have a crucial role in the MVC 
model. Sometimes, it is possible to omit a model component, or even a view 
component, but controller components are essential. The controller receives 
requests, processes them, creates the model, and forwards the prepared 
model to the view component. 
Web frameworks use an additional object, called a front controller servlet. This 
object, which is responsible for receiving requests and dispatching them to the 
appropriate controllers, allows us to create cleaner code that eliminates unnecessary 
request processing in controllers. The following figure shows the role of the front 
controller servlet in a web framework's architecture:
Client
(Web Browser)
Server
(Web Server)
Front Controller
Controller
Model
View
Now that I've given some background material regarding web frameworks, let's look 
at some actual web frameworks and see how we can integrate them with Spring in 
order to provide Spring services in a web implementation.

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 374 ]
This chapter looks at two primary web frameworks that implement the 
MVC pattern. First, I'll discuss Spring, with which you can easily use 
other Spring services in web implementations. Then, I'll explain Struts, 
an older, very popular web framework. You can find more information 
about integrating other frameworks in the Spring documentation.
Spring MVC web framework
Spring is a popular MVC-based web framework. Besides many services, such as 
IoC, AOP, and transaction management provided by Spring and discussed so 
far, Spring provides full functionality for building robust web applications. This 
functionality is supported in two ways. First, Spring can be integrated with other 
web frameworks, such as Struts, WebWork, Java Server Faces, and Tapestry in order 
to use Spring's services such as IoC and AOP, and second, Spring provides its own 
MVC web framework. 
In this section, we will look at Spring MVC and its various components, including 
Dispatcher Servlet, Handler Mappings, Controllers, Model and Views, and View 
Resolvers. As advantages of Spring, Spring MVC is not tightly coupled with Servlet 
and JSP to render the View to the clients, and can be integrated with other view 
technologies like Velocity, Freemarker, Excel, and PDF.
Spring MVC workflow
Before digging into Spring MVC details, let's explore Spring MVC architecture and 
various components involved. The main components are front controller, handler 
mappings, controllers, view resolvers, and views. The basic workflow to handle a 
request are as follows:
1. A web request is submitted to the application.
2.	 The Front Controller receives the request and interprets it to find the 
appropriate handle mapping. The handle mapping maps the request to an 
appropriate Controller object.
3.	 The front controller forwards the request to the controller object.
4.	 The controller receives the request, processes it, and returns a Model and 
View object to the front controller.
5.	 The front controller uses View Resolvers to find the appropriate View object.
6.	 The view object is used to render the result which then sends it back to 
the client.

Chapter 14
[ 375 ]
Now let's continue our discussion with a bit of a detailed  explanation on 
each component.
Front controller
The front controller in Spring MVC is an object of org.springframework.web.
servlet.DispatcherServlet. As the first step to use Spring MVC, you need to 
configure front controller in web.xml to intercept all of the client requests. This is 
done as follows:
<servlet>
  <servlet-name>action</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>
    org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet
  </servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping> 
  <servlet-name>action</servlet-name> 
  <url-pattern>*.html</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
This configuration tells the container all requested URLs with .html extension 
must be processed by the DispatcherServlet object. In addition to being a front 
controller object, the DispatcherServlet object finds the Spring application context 
file named as <servlet-name>—servlet.xml and located in /WEB-INF directory. In 
our case, this means DispatcherServlet tries to find /WEB-INF/action-servlet.
xml, and then loads and binds it to the ServletContext object. Alternatively, it is 
also possible to use ContextLoaderListener discussed to load the Spring context 
files. You need to use this approach if you have different file names, or the context 
files are located in a different directory than WEB-INF.
Handler mappings
As mentioned, the DispatcherServlet object finds an appropriate handler mapping 
object, and then uses it to map the request to a controller. Actually, the handler 
mapping object tells Spring how the requested URL must be mapped to controllers. 
The most common types of handler mappings are BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping, 
ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping, SimpleUrlHandlerMapping. These handler 
mappings are explained as follows:

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 376 ]
BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping
This handler mapping simply maps the requests to controller based on the name 
of the requested URLs. For instance, for the URL http://hostname:port/
webAppName/viewStudent.html, the request is passed to a controller configured as: 
<bean name="/viewStudent.html"
      class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch14.ViewStudentController">
</bean>
To use this handler mapping, BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping must be configured as a 
bean in the Spring context as:
<bean id="beanNameUrl"    class="org.springframework.web.servlet.
handler.BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping"/>
ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping
This handler mapping takes the name of the controller from the requested URL 
with some modifications. For instance, requests for any URLs that follow the pattern 
/viewStudent* will be processed by the controller ViewStudentController. This 
handler mapping simply strips Controller off the controller's name to determine 
the URLs for that controller. To use this kind of mapping, you need to have a bean 
definition as follows:
<bean id="controllerClassName" class=" org.springframework.web.
servlet.mvc.support.ControllerClassNameHandlerMapping "/>
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping
Directly maps the URLs to controllers. The following code shows how this mapping 
is configured and used:
<bean id="simpleUrlMapping" 
class="org.springframework.web.servlet.handler.
SimpleUrlHandlerMapping">
    <property name="mappings">
        <props>
            <prop key="/viewStudent.html">
                viewStudentController
            </prop>
            <prop key="/listStudents.html">
               listStudentController
            </prop>
            <prop key="/deleteCourse.html">
               deleteCourseController

Chapter 14
[ 377 ]
            </prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean>
The URL /viewStudent.html will be processed by a controller named 
viewStudentController in the Spring context.
Controllers
Controllers have the responsibility to process the requests, do the business logic, 
and produce the viewable result. Spring provides the Controller interface as the 
super-interface for all controller implementations. This interface is as follows:
public interface Controller  {
ModelAndView handleRequest(HttpServletRequest request,         
                     HttpServletResponse response) throws Exception;
}
To make it easy, Spring provides a variety of built-in controller implementations, 
which is useful for a specific purpose. The most common controllers are as follows:
AbstractController
AbstractCommandController
SimpleFormController
CancellableFormController
MultiActionController
ParameterizableViewController
ServletForwardingController
ServletWrappingController
UrlFilenameViewController
Let's have a quick look at some of these controllers and the way they are used.

[ 378 ]
AbstractController
This class provides the basic implementation for all other Spring built-in controllers. 
Therefore, you shouldn't implement a custom implementation of the Controller 
interface if you want to implement a custom controller from scratch. The 
AbstractController class provides the protected handleRequestInternal() 
method to be implemented by subclasses. This method receives two parameters as 
object of HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse, just like servlet methods 
and returns an object of ModelAndView. The ModelAndView object is a Spring specific 
class representing the model, the result of request processing, and information about 
the target page that will render the model. The ModelAndView object doesn't directly 
refer to a specific page. Instead, it just provides a logical view name to be mapped to 
the physical path of the target page. The ModelAndView class will be discussed later 
in this chapter.
The following code shows how our ModelAndView can be implemented with 
AbstractController:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch14;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.AbstractController;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
public class ViewStudentController extends AbstractController {
  StudentService studentService;
  public ModelAndView handleRequestInternal(HttpServletRequest 
request, HttpServletResponse response)
          throws Exception {
    // create a model-and-view object
    ModelAndView modelAndView = new ModelAndView("viewStudent");
    String studentId = request.getParameter("studentId");
    Student student = studentService.getStudent(studentId);
    // add an object to render in the view 
    modelAndView.addObject("student", student);
    return modelAndView;
  }
  public void setStudentService(StudentService studentService) {
    this.studentService = studentService;
  }
}

Chapter 14
[ 379 ]
Note that the dispatcher servlet always calls the handleRequest() 
method to forward the request to a AbstractController object. 
The AbstractController object does some control checking. 
Namely, checking if the HTTP request method is supported by 
this controller, checking whether session exists if it needs the 
session, setting cache control headers, and so on, and then calls the 
handleRequestInternal() method internally to process the request.
AbstractCommandController
This controller is essentially used to process a user request, which always build with 
parameters. This class provides a handle() method which takes an object parameter 
in addition to HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse. With this kind of 
controller, we can deal with a command object, including all of the submitted values, 
instead of working with HttpServletRequest to obtain the request parameters. The 
command object can be a simple POJO object populated with request parameters. 
The following code shows our simple example, which now is implemented with 
AbstractCommandController:
public class ViewStudentController extends AbstractCommandController {
    
    StudentSeverice service;
    
    public ViewStudentController() {
        setCommandClass(StudentInfo.class);
    }
    
    protected ModelAndView handle(HttpServletRequest request,
    HttpServletResponse response, Object command, 
    BindException errors) throws Exception {
        StudentInfo info = (StudentInfo) command;
        Student std = //service object to obtain the student
        if(std == null){
            return new ModelAndView("failure"); 
        }else{
           return new ModelAndView("success", "student", std); 
        }
    }
    public void setService(StudentSeverice service) {
        this.service = service;
    }
}

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 380 ]
Note how in the constructor we introduced the command class to the controller.
The handle() method takes a BindException object, which represents 
the validation result of command object, if validation has been set for 
that command.
The following code shows the command class:
public class StudentInfo {
    String id;
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}
SimpleFormController
SimpleFormController is used to handle request submission. This controller 
provides a variety of methods to process the user submission. 
The following code uses the onSubmit() method in the controller to process 
the request:
public ModelAndView onSubmit(Object command) throws Exception{
        StudentInfo info = (StudentInfo) command;
        Student std = //service object to obtain the student
        if(std == null){
            return new ModelAndView("failure");
        }else{
           return new ModelAndView("success", "student", std);
        }
    }
The input page, which provides the submission information to this controller, 
and the success page, which renders the result, are respectively specified via the 
formView and successView properties. The following bean configuration shows 
how SimpleFormController is configured:
<bean id = "studentView" class="StudentViewController">
    <property name="formView">
        <value>allStudents</value>
    </property>

Chapter 14
[ 381 ]
    <property name="successView">
        <value>studentDetails</value>
    </property>
</bean>
Note that the values are just logical view names, which are then mapped to the 
physical page locations.
CancellableFormController
This controller provides more functionality over SimpleFormController. By 
this kind of controller, it is possible to handle the user cancelation for the form 
submission by its onCancel() method. The following code shows how onCancel() 
is implemented:
public ModelAndView onCancel(Object command) throws Exception{
        return new ModelAndView("viewAll");
}
The onCancel() method is called to process the request when the framework finds 
a request parameter named _cancel. You can change this parameter name by 
the cancelParamKey property for the CancellableFormController object. The 
following code shows how CancellableFormController is configured:
<bean id="viewStudentController" class="com.packtput.springhibernate.
ch14.ViewStudentController">
        <property name="useCacheControlHeader" value="false"/>
        ...
        <!-- Required for CancellableFormController -->
        <property name="cancelParamKey" value="cancel"/>
        <property name="cancelView" value="redirect:myCancel.action"/>
        <!-- Standard FormController properties -->
        <property name="formView" value="studentList.jsp"/>
        <property name="successView" value="success"/>
</bean>
Model and View
In the Spring MVC, each controller returns an object of org.springframework.
web.servlet.ModelAndView, representing the model and the logical view name 
to render the model. The ModelAndView object includes three parts, the model, a 
map object, and the view, an implementation of the org.springframework.web.
servlet.View interface. The view can be a simple string literal that is mapped by 
the view resolver to an actual JSP page.

Web Development with Hibernate and Spring
[ 382 ]
View resolvers
Finally, when the data is ready to render, the view resolver is invoked to find 
the actual JSP page responsible to render the result. Similar to controllers, 
Spring provides a variety of view resolvers, all as implementation of the 
org.springframework.web.servlet.ViewResolver interface. The view 
resolvers Spring provides are BeanNameViewResolver, FreeMarkerViewResolver, 
InternalResourceViewResolver, JasperReportsViewResolver, 
ResourceBundleViewResolver, UrlBasedViewResolver, 
VelocityLayoutViewResolver, VelocityViewResolver, XmlViewResolver, 
XsltViewResolver. Here, we will just look at two most common view resolvers, 
InternalResourceViewResolver and BeanNameViewResolver.
InternalResourceViewResolver
This view resolver simply appends prefix and suffix to the logical view name to find 
the physical page locations. For instance, the following configured view resolver 
object maps any logical view name to a JSP page with the same name located in the 
WEB-INF directory:
<bean id="viewResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.
InternalResourceViewResolver">
    <property name="prefix"><value>/WEB-INF/</value></property>
    <property name="suffix"><value>.jsp</value></property>
</bean>
By this code, if the logical view name has been set to viewStudent, the /WEB-INF/
viewStudent.jsp page is chosen to render the result.
BeanNameViewResolver
BeanNameViewResolver allows us to dynamically generate in any format, which is 
something that is not possible with InternalResourceViewResolver. For instance, 
suppose we want to generate a PDF page from the model on the fly. It is possible 
to use BeanNameViewResolver with an implemented AbstractPdfView object to 
generate the PDF. The following shows the code to do so:
<bean id="beanNameResolver" class="org.springframework.web.servlet.
view.BeanNameViewResolver"/>
<bean id = "pdf" class = "com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch14.
CustomPdfGenerator"/>
Any ModelAndView object with the logical pdf view name will then be processed by 
CustomPdfGenerator.

Chapter 14
[ 383 ]
Render the result through JSP
Finally, a JSP page can render the result. The following code shows a partial JSP page 
to render the student instance:
<table width="637" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
      <tr>
        <td>Student Number</td>
        <td><c:out value="${student.stdNo}"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>First Name</td>
        <td><c:out value="${student.firstName}"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Last Name</td>
        <td><c:out value="${student.lastName}"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SSN</td>
        <td><c:out value="${student.ssn}"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Birthday</td>
        <td><fmt:formatDate value="${student.birthday}" 
          type="both"/></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Entrance Date</td>
        <td><fmt:formatDate value="${student.entranceDate}"
             type="both"/></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
There is nothing special about this page, only that is uses JSTL to render the 
student instance.

Summary
This chapter discussed how to use Spring in web applications. We started 
with a quick overview of the MVC pattern. Our discussion continued with the 
common configuration to integrate web frameworks with Spring. We used the 
org.springframework.web.context.ContextLoaderListener class to load 
the Spring application context at application startup, and then store it in the 
ServletContext. In any JSP page or servlet class, the stored ApplicationContext 
can be accessed through Spring utility class: org.springframework.web.util.
WebApplicationContextUtils.
To develop a web application with the Spring MVC framework, you must configure 
the DispatcherServlet as the front controller. DispatcherServlet accepts all web 
requests, and forwards each to the appropriate controller. You must also configure 
the web application to use ContextLoaderListener to load the Spring context 
files at application startup. You will be able to implement controller classes as an 
implementation of Controller, and configure them in the Spring context as beans. 
Additionally, you should specify a resolver, which resolves names to paths, and 
use handler mapping to map URL patterns to bean names. You can then render the 
result in JSP pages.

Testing
When developing an application, we need to apply a testing mechanism to ensure 
that the application works as we intend. In practice, different kinds of testing exist, 
each with different goals, including quality assurance testing, acceptance testing, 
performance testing, integration testing, and unit testing. Customer satisfaction 
tests, performed by the quality assurance team, verify that the application meets the 
customer's needs and expectations. Acceptance tests exercise all operating conditions 
of the user's environment or features of the system. Performance tests evaluate 
how the application responds to a large number of requests, specifically testing 
the application's robustness, memory usage, and response time. Integration tests 
ensure that all of the application's parts work correctly when they are assembled 
in a simulated production environment. 
However, not all of these tests are the subject of this chapter. Instead, this chapter 
discusses two types of testing: unit testing, to test all smallest parts of the application 
work properly, and integration testing, to make sure these smallest parts work 
correctly when they merge. Unit testing is the first step in the application testing 
process and uncovers defects and program errors. The developers write and execute 
simple blocks of code as tests, verifying the functions, behavior, and performance of 
an object to make sure that the object meets its functional requirements. Unit testing 
allows developers to produce more productive and effective code with fewer bugs. 
Integration testing means testing the combination of units.
This chapter discusses the aspects of Hibernate and Spring applications that require 
testing and how to implement test cases for those aspects. Our discussion begins with 
a quick overview of unit testing and the popular unit test framework JUnit. We'll then 
discuss how JUnit lets us create effective test code and run it automatically. 

Testing
[ 386 ]
An introduction to unit testing
A unit test is a chunk of code that examines the functionality of a very small part of 
the application code: in practice, a method. Developers write unit tests to find defects 
and verify that their code meets its requirements in isolation from other code in the 
application. The test should provide all of the possible circumstances, situations, 
and conditions in which the code may be executed and that may potentially break 
the code. Unit testing is part of the philosophy that, when we're developing code, 
we should find any defects as soon as possible. The longer a bug exists, the more 
dramatically the cost of finding and fixing a bug increases. Using unit testing, 
developers can learn, as soon as possible, where and how their code breaks, fix 
the problem, and test again and again until no problem exists. 
During application development, when you add a component to the application, 
you must implement and add a unit test, as well. Each unit test guarantees that a 
component works as expected. After the application has been fully developed, you 
will have a set of unit tests for all of the application's components. If all components 
pass the tests without any failures, you can conclude that the application's 
components work properly in isolation from each other.
In practice, we implement a test class for each class of the application. Each test class 
implemented with JUnit is called a test case. For each method of the class being 
tested, we implement one or more test methods in the test class. To examine whether 
a method works as it should, we must call the method with its required parameters 
and conditions in a test method, and then verify that the method's result is what 
we expect.
The following figure shows the relationship between application classes and 
unit tests:
Application Test
Application
Class1
tests
+methodA()
+methodB()
TestCaseClass1
+testMethodA1()
+testMethodA2()
+testMethodB()
Test classes include test methods. Each test method provides a particular condition 
that may break the method under test, invokes the method under test, and verifies 
the result.

Chapter 15
[ 387 ]
Unit testing with JUnit
JUnit is a Java framework for unit testing. The benefits of using JUnit, rather than 
implementing unit tests on your own code, can be summarized as follows:
Create simple and effective test programs.
Create test programs in a public and standard structure.
Receive a report of the test's results.
Execute the tests automatically with Ant.
JUnit is the foundation for more specialized unit-testing tools, such as Cactus, mocks, 
JMeter, Jester, JUnitPerf, DbUnit, and HttpUnit.
JUnit can be found at http://www.junit.org, along with sample usages 
and documentation.
The structure of test classes with JUnit
New releases of JUnit support annotation-based unit tests. Therefore, we can develop 
unit test in a different style of old releases of JUnit. Here we will discuss the old and 
new approaches and for that we will use JUnit 3.8 as the old version and JUnit 4.0 as 
the new version.
JUnit provides a basic test class, called junit.framework.TestCase. To develop 
with JUnit 3.8, we must always create a subclass of TestCase as a test class for each 
class being tested with JUnit. TestCase is a JUnit utility class which provides basic 
assertion methods (discussed soon) to verify test results. Moreover, JUnit's test 
runners identify test classes that extend the TestCase class in order to execute them.
As a convention, name test classes after the class being tested with a common 
prefix or suffix, such as TestCase. This naming convention allows you to identify 
the test classes throughout the application and give Ant a pattern for automatic 
test execution. As a mandatory naming convention with JUnit 3.8 and before, the 
name of the test method is the name of the method being tested with the test 
prefix. This convention allows JUnit's test runners to distinguish the test methods 
from other helper methods inside test classes. For instance, a method that tests the 
saveStudent() method would be named testSaveStudent(). If more than one 
test method exists for a method, you can append a number: testSaveStudent1(), 
testSaveStudent2(), and so on.
With JUnit 4.0, the test case class doesn't need to extend the TestClass, and the test 
method's name no longer needs to start with test. Any class can be used as a test case, 
in which test methods are marked with the @Test annotation.

Testing
[ 388 ]
Whether you are using JUnit 3.8 or JUnit 4, test classes must follow these steps, 
in order:
1.	 Provide the required conditions and circumstances that are needed to test 
the method.
2.	 Call the method being tested in the test method.
3.	 Verify the method's result to check whether it operated as expected.
4.	 Perform finalization operations.
Let's go through this process.
Setting up the preconditions
Each test case has its own preconditions, which must be provided before execution 
of any test. With JUnit 3.8, you need to implement the TestCase's setUp() method 
as follows:
protected void setUp();
This method is automatically called by JUnit before each test method is executed. 
You can override it to provide the preconditions for executing the test methods 
(all methods in the test class named with the test prefix). Typically, you may use 
this method to create the required objects for invoking the method being tested, look 
up a resource, and so on. 
With JUnit 4, you can mark any method with the @org.junit.Before annotation to 
act as the setUp() method. 
Call the method being tested and verify the result
With JUnit 3.8, test methods with the test prefix call the methods being tested with 
the required parameters and check for the expected result. Here is an example of a 
test method:
public void testSaveStudent() {
    //call the method being tested
    //verify the result 
}

Chapter 15
[ 389 ]
Test methods have void as the return type and take no argument. These methods 
call the methods of the object(s) prepared by the setUp() method. To verify the 
result, the TestCase class provides some helper methods, called assertion methods. 
Assertion methods help you compare the result with the value you expected. 
For instance, if you expect the return value of a method to be 1, you may use the 
following code to verify it:
assertEquals("Should be 1", 1, result);
The result is the actual returned value of the method invocation. JUnit checks 
whether the result equals 1. If it does, the test succeeds, and if not, the test fails and 
the message "Should be 1" is reported via the application console, the log files, or 
another user interface (based on how the test is executed). The message argument for 
assertion methods, "Should be 1" in this case, is optional. 
JUnit provides many other useful assertion methods. The following table shows 
some significant TestCase assertion methods:
Method
Description
assertEquals([String 
message],expected, actual)
Verifies that the actual value is the expected 
one. For primitive types, such as boolean, 
int, short, and so on, this method performs 
a simple value comparison. For objects, 
this method uses the equals() method to 
perform comparison.
assertNull([String message], 
Object o)
assertNotNull([String message], 
Object o)
Checks whether the object o is null or is not 
null.
assertSame([String message], 
expected, actual)
assertNotSame([String message], 
expected, actual)
Checks whether the expected and actual 
objects have the same reference, or do not 
have the same reference.
assertTrue([String message], 
boolean condition)
assertFalse([String message], 
boolean condition)
Checks whether the condition variable is 
true or false.
fail([String message])
Fails the test intentionally when an undesired 
condition happens. For instance, this method 
can be used in a section of code that must 
never be reached (for example, in a catch 
block if you do not expect an exception be 
thrown, or immediately before a catch block 
if you do expect an exception to be thrown).

Testing
[ 390 ]
The message argument shown as [String message] in all of the 
methods listed in the table above is optional. This argument represents 
the message that is reported if the test fails.
With JUnit 4, test methods are simple public methods marked with the @Test 
annotation. Here is an example:
@Test
public void saveStudent() {
    //call the method being tested
    //verify the result 
}
To make assertion, JUnit 4 provides Assert class with public static assert 
methods to evaluate the test results. The assert methods provided by the 
Assert class are similar to the TestCase's assert methods with the same 
meaning and syntax.
Perform finalization operations
The TestCase class provides the tearDown() method, similar to the setUp() 
method, and is called by JUnit after each test method is executed. The tearDown() 
method's signature is as follows:
protected void tearDown();
With JUnit 3.8, you can override this method in test classes to perform finalization 
operations, such as object clean up or releasing a resource such as a file. With JUnit 4 
and later, you can simply mark a method with the @org.junit.After annotation to 
act as tearDown() method.
Running JUnit tests
Almost all Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are integrated with JUnit, 
and you may easily use the IDE to run test cases. However, we never want to make 
our development dependent on a particular product. Instead of using a particular 
IDE, you can rely on JUnit itself for running the tests. JUnit provides the org.junit.
runner.JUnitCore class for running test cases. You can execute test cases through 
the java command with the JUnitCore class as follows:
java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore TestClass1.class [TestClass2.class ...]

Chapter 15
[ 391 ]
You can also use the JUnitCore class in application code, as follows:
org.junit.runner.JUnitCore.runClasses(TestClass1.class [,TestClass2.
class, ...]);
In practice, Ant and Maven are used to automatically run unit tests 
as a part of the build process. 
Integration testing data-access layer
When developing with Hibernate, we need to test whether the application's 
data-access layer works properly. This involves testing the following:
Whether classes are persistent
Whether all classes' fields are persistent
Whether HQL expressions return valid results
Whether persistent operations are cascaded as they are configured in the 
mapping definitions
Let's take the HibernateStudentDao class as a representation of the data-access layer 
and see how test cases are implemented for this class. The following code shows the 
StudentDao interface implemented by HibernateStudentDao:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15;
import java.util.Collection;
public interface StudentDao {
    public Collection getAllStudents();
    public Student getStudent(Long studentId);
    public Student saveStudent(Student student);
    public Student removeStudent(Student student);
    public Student updateStudent(Student student);
}

We create the TestCaseHibernateStudentDao class as a test class for 
HibernateStudentDao, and implement appropriate test methods. All we need to 
do in the test methods is to verify that the DAO methods work properly when they 
are invoked. For example, the saveStudent() method stores a newly instantiated 
Student instance with all of its persistent properties. To do so, we can use a 
HibernateStudentDao instance and a Hibernate Session object concurrently 
to verify, for example, getAllStudents() returns all persistent students, and 
getStudent() returns the persisted Student instance correctly with all of its 
persistent fields. If we do this, we must provide a Session instance in the setUp() 
method, and close the Session instance in the tearDown() method, as the start and 
end of each test method's process. The following code shows the basic structure of 
the test class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
import org.hibernate.Session;
public class TestCaseHibernateStudentDao extends TestCase {
    Session session;
    StudentDao dao;
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
       //a Hibernate Session and a HibernateStudentDao object are used
       //by all the test methods, so those object creation are 
         performed here
        session = HibernateHelper.getSession();
        session.connection().setAutoCommit(true);
        dao = new HibernateStudentDao();
    }
    public void tearDown() throws Exception { 
        //as the finalized step we need to close the Hibernate Session
        // instance to release the Session's resources
        if(session.isOpen())
            session.close();
    }
}
The tearDown() method checks whether the session is open before 
closing it. This is reasonable. If we do not use the session in the test 
method (for example, to start any transaction with the session), the 
session remains closed.
Next, I'll explain how a test method is implemented for each method.

Verify that the entity class is persistent
To test the saveStudent() method, we create a testSaveStudent() method in the 
test class as follows:
public void testSaveStudent() {
    Student student = createADummyStudent();
    Student retStudent = dao.saveStudent(student); 
    //the value returned by the DAO must be equal to 
    //the original value
    assertEquals("The DAO's returned value of saving"+
                 "must be equal to original",                                                               
                                     student, retStudent);
    //look inside the database through direct Hibernate
    //the session is auto-commit, so we are sure that the 
    //transaction is committed, the session is flushed 
    //after each operation
    Student actualStudent = (Student)session.get(Student.class,
                                           retStudent.getId());
    //the actual Student object in the database must be 
    //equal to the original value
    assertEquals("Actual Student and DAO's returned "+ 
                 "Student must be equal",
                  student, actualStudent);
}
private Student createADummyStudent() {
    Student student = new Student();
    Calendar birthday = Calendar.getInstance();
    birthday.set(Calendar.YEAR, 1982);
    birthday.set(Calendar.MONTH, 3);
    birthday.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 21);
    student.setBirthdate(birthday.getTime());
    Calendar entranceTime = Calendar.getInstance();
    birthday.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2005);
    birthday.set(Calendar.MONTH, 7);
    birthday.set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 1);
    student.setEntranceDate(entranceTime.getTime());
    student.setFirstName("John");
    student.setLastName("White");
    student.setSsn("121-21212-211");
    student.setStdNo("832423472");
    return student;
}

As you can see, a Student instance is created and is stored via the DAO object. 
The object returned by the DAO must be equal to the original object. The Session 
instance uses the returned value to load the Student object from the database. 
Loaded instances can be used to verify that the actual data in the database holds 
the correct values for the Student instance.
In all test methods, we look at DAO classes as black boxes. It does not 
matter whether a DAO class uses Hibernate or any other O/R mapping 
technology. We test the DAO's functionality regardless of the technology 
it uses.
Verify that all entity fields are persistent
To verify all properties are persistent, we can simply compare the original object with 
the persistent object with the assertEquals()method. The testSaveStudent1() 
shows how it can be done:
public void testSaveStudent() {
    Student student = createADummyStudent();
    Student retStudent = dao.saveStudent(student); 
    assertNotNull(retStudent);
    //set the identifier to let the equals() method proceed.
    student.setId(retStudent.getId()); 
    //the returned value by the DAO must be equal to
    // the original value
    assertEquals("The DAO's returned value of saving" +
                 " must be equal to original",
                                      student, retStudent);
    //look inside the database using Hibernate directly
    Student actualStudent = 
            (Student)session.get(Student.class, retStudent.getId());
    //the actual Student object in the database must
    // be equal to the original value
    assertEquals("Actual Student and DAO's returned" +
                 " Student must be equal",
                                  student, actualStudent);
}
The assertEquals() method uses the Student's equals() method to compare 
two objects.

Chapter 15
[ 395 ]
Although you should test every behavior of the class, the setter and getter 
methods commonly just assign and return the field values, so these are 
easily tested. However, if these methods have side effects, or nontrivial 
functionality, they should be tested.
If you are using a Hibernate Session in each test method to perform a distinct 
persistent operation, it is a good idea to put the Session obtaining code in the 
setUp() and close the Session in the tearDown() method. However, if the test 
methods take the Session obtaining or the Session closing as a part of the test logic, 
you cannot put obtaining and closing the Session instance generally in the setUp() 
and tearDown() methods. 
Verify that HQL works properly
While testing the data-access layer, you need to verify that HQL expressions load 
persistent objects correctly. For instance, in our example you must verify that the 
searchStudentsByFirstName() method takes a String parameter as the student's 
first name, and retrieves all Student instances with the specified first name. The 
testSearchStudentsByFirstName() method verifies this:
public void testSearchStudentsByFirstName(){
    Student student = createADummyStudent();
    dao.saveStudent(student);
    Collection students = 
           dao.searchStudentsByFirstName(student.getFirstName());
    assertNotNull(allStudents);
    String hql = "from Student s where s.firstName like :firstName";
    Query query = session.createQuery(hql);
    query.setString("firstName", student.getFirstName());
    Collection actualStudents = 
                    query.list();
    assertEquals("All students should be the same", 
                                  allStudents, actualStudents);
}
Verify cascading operation
Verifying the cascading operation is one of the important aspects. We want to make 
sure when an object is stored if its association are persistent properly. With what 
we have done so far, doing it is very easy and straightforward. We are just going 
to test the save-update cascading operation. You will then be able to test all other 
cascading operations. 

Testing
[ 396 ]
Suppose the Student object is associated with an Address object, and their relation is 
mapped with the save-update cascading operation. When a Student object with its 
Address associated is stored, we expect both objects persisted properly:
public void testSaveStudent() {
    Student student = createADummyStudent();
    Address address = createADummyAddress();
    student.setAddress(address);
    Student retStudent = dao.saveStudent(student); 
    //look inside the database through direct Hibernate
    //the session is auto-commit, so we are sure that the 
    //transaction is committed, the session is flushed 
    //after each operation
    Student actualStudent = (Student)session.get(Student.class,
                                           retStudent.getId());
    Address actualAddress = actualStudent.getAddress();
    assertNotNull(actualAddress);
    //set the identifier, to let the equals() method proceed.
    address.setId(actualAddress.getId());
    student.setId(actualStudent.getId());
    //the actual Student object in the database must be 
    //equal to the original value
    assertEquals("Actual Student and DAO's returned "+ 
                 "Student must be equal",
                  student, actualStudent); 
    assertEquals("Actual Address and DAO's returned "+ 
                 "Address must be equal",
                  address, actualAddress);
}
It is assumed that the Student's equals() method does not care about the equality 
of the associated Address object. We have used an extra assertEquals() to verify, if 
the persistent associated Address object is equal to the original Address object.
Testing Inversion of Control
One of Spring's benefits is that most of the objects managed by Spring are unaware 
of the Spring framework API. This makes it easy to use Java code to create and wire 
together an instance of the class being tested with its required dependencies.

Chapter 15
[ 397 ]
Look at the Spring context with two configured objects, as shown in the 
following code:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-
             2.5.xsd">
    <bean id="studentService" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15.StudentService">
        <property name="studentDao">
            <ref local="studentDao"/>
        </property>
    </bean>
    <bean id="studentDao" 
        class="com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15.HibernateStudentDao">
    </bean>
</beans>
The test class to initialize the Spring context and obtain a StudentService instance 
is shown in the following code:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15;
import org.springframework.context.support.
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
public class TestCaseStudentService extends TestCase {
    ApplicationContext ctx;
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(                      
"com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch15/applicationContext.xml");
    }
    public void testStudentDaoInjection() throws Exception {
        StudentService ss = 
                (StudentService) ctx.getBean("studentService");
        assertNotNull("StudentService should not be null", ss);
        assertNotNull("StudentDao should not be null", 
                                           ss.getStudentDao());
        assertEquals(ss.getStudentDao().getClass(),
                                         HibernateStudentDao.class);
    }
}

Testing
[ 398 ]
Note that, we still need to implement typical test methods to verify the functionality 
of StudentService methods.
Unit testing using mocks
With unit testing, as a rule, it is always necessary to test each object without relying 
on other application's objects which need testing as well. However, in many 
situations, the object being tested is tightly coupled with other objects. For example, 
the object being tested uses other objects to do its job. In such cases, mock objects 
help us to test the object conveniently without relying on other application's objects. 
Mock objects are also used in situations where testing an object needs to create other 
objects, such as connecting to a database, starting an application server, providing a 
socket object, and so on, that are costly. Mock objects work similarly to real objects, 
but we are sure about their operations and do not need to test them. This means that 
we can be confident in using them, instead of real objects, to test a dependent object.
For instance, how can we ensure that StudentService always uses the StudentDao 
instance, when there is no approach to look inside the StudentService class and 
verify that the StudentDao instance is always used? In this case, we can create a 
mock implementation of the StudentDao interface, and manually inject it into the 
StudentService instance. Based on the objects returned by the mock StudentDao 
implementation, we can determine whether StudentDao is used. The following code 
shows this approach:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.Collection;
import  java.util.ArrayList;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.springframework.context.support.
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import junit.framework.TestCase;
public class TestCaseStudentService1 extends TestCase {
    ApplicationContext ctx;
    StudentService ss;
    public void setUp() throws Exception {
        ctx = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(                          
       "com/packtpub/springhibernate/ch15/applicationContext.xml");
        ss = (StudentService) ctx.getBean("studentService");    
    }

        Collection allStudents = ss.getAllStudents();

In this class, we simply created a mock implementation of the StudentDao interface. 
Although, you can always use this approach to create mock objects, it is not 
always as simple and straightforward as in the example. For instance, to create a 
mock implementation of interfaces with many methods, you need to implement 
all of the methods, even if you do not need them all. For example, when you are 
developing a web application and dealing with the HttpServletRequest and 
HttpServletResponse interfaces, it is not simple to create a concrete implementation 
of these interfaces as mock classes. Fortunately, Spring includes some mock classes 
for common interfaces, such as MockHttpSession, MockHttpServletRequest, 
and MockHttpServletResponse as mock implementations of the HttpSession, 
HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse interfaces, respectively.

Chapter 15
[ 401 ]
Additionally, you can use easy mock objects. EasyMock (http://www.easymock.
org) is a library for creating mock objects dynamically without implementing mock 
classes. You specify the method, which the mock object should provide, and the 
value that method should return when called. Then, you can use the object, which 
acts similarly to the real object. These objects work in two modes: record mode and 
replay mode. Record mode is the state in which the object records a method and the 
return value it should provide. Record mode can switch to replay mode, in which the 
object is ready to be used. 
To use a mock object, follow these steps:
1.	 Create a mock object for the interface you want to simulate.
2.	 Record the expected behavior.
3.	 Switch the mock object to the replay state.
The following code shows the StudentServiceTest2 class, which uses mock objects 
to test the StudentService class:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.ch15;

        ss = (StudentService) ctx.getBean("studentService");
        //create a mock object which represents
        // the StudentDao instance 
        dao = EasyMock.createMock(StudentDao.class);
    }
    public void testStudentDaoUsageEasyMock() throws Exception {

In this example, we call the createMock() static method of the org.easymock.
EasyMock class to create a StudentDao mock object. We then register a method call 
on the mock object, specify that the mock should return the test data, and feed the 
mock object to the StudentService instance provided by the Spring IoC container. 
Later, we can call EasyMock.verify() to ask the mock object to verify that the 
method we registered was actually called.
Automating tests with Ant
Ant provides several tasks to run test classes from the build file and generate test 
reports. To use these tasks, the junit.jar file must be in the Ant classpath (in the 
ANT_HOME/lib directory) or in the application classpath (in the application's 
lib directory). 
The junit task is an Ant task that allows us to execute the test classes automatically 
with the application's build process. Here is a typical usage of the junit task inside 
the build.xml file, introduced in Chapter 2:

    </junitreport>
</target>
The junit and junitreport tasks run test cases and create a document to show the 
test case's result, respectively. Here are short explanations for these tasks:
The <junit> element can be used with the optional printsummary attribute, 
which determines whether to print one line statistics for each test case. The 
nested <formatter> elements within the <junit> element lets you choose 
different formats for the test result. The valid values, which are specified 
through the type attribute of the <formatter> element, are plain, xml, and 
brief. The xml prints the test results in XML format. plain and brief emit 
plain text, but brief provides a shorter description for tests than plain does. 
The nested <batchtest> element lets you select test cases based on 
pattern matching. 
junitreport lets you create a document to show test results. It merges the 
individual XML files generated by the junit task, and applies a style sheet 
to the result to produce browsable test-case results. The todir attribute 
determines the location of the XML file aggregated from the results of all 
tests. The nested <fileset> element lets you select individual XML files 
generated by the junit task. The nested <report> element generates a 
browsable report based on the document created by the merge.
For a more in-depth discussion about the junit and junitreport tasks, see the 
JUnit documentation, or Pro Apache Ant by Matthew Moodie (Apress, 2005).

Summary
Unit testing, a critical part of application development, ensures that the 
application works as expected. A good practice for unit testing is to execute 
test classes automatically.
A test class is implemented for each Java class. Each test class includes the 
required methods for testing an application class in isolation from other 
application and test classes.
JUnit is a Java framework that simplifies test development. Using JUnit, you 
can easily verify that the method invocation results match the expected values. 
Extensions exist for the JUnit framework, such as Cactus, JMeter, DbUnit, HttpUnit, 
and so on.
To implement a test class with JUnit 3.8 and before, you only need to create a 
subclass of TestCase, and then implement the initialization process in the setUp() 
method and the finalization process in the tearDown() method. Then, implement the 
test methods, whose names begin with the test prefix. With JUnit 4 or later, you can 
simply use any class as a test class. In the test class, any public method which doesn't 
take any parameter and returns void can be marked with @Test to be a test method. 
It is also possible to mark methods with the @Before and @After annotations to act 
as setUp() and tearDown() methods. 
JUnit automatically explores the test classes to find and run test methods.


Some of Hibernate's 
Advanced Features
Throughout this book, you have learned essential information about Hibernate. 
Hibernate is flexible enough to be used in any environment, providing advanced 
features that are the subject of this appendix.
This appendix discusses the event/listener model that Hibernate implements. Using 
this model, you can customize normal persistence behavior exposed by Hibernate. 
We also look at filters, which let you work with a subset of persistent data. Finally, 
we'll explore some useful Hibernate properties that you may need in advanced cases.
Hibernate's Event/Listener model
At times, you'll need to perform a task when a persistence operation is done. 
Normally, you may change the persistence operation and insert the task's code 
before or after the operation, based on your requirements. Although this solves 
the problem, it may not suit your needs: the task may not be part of a persistence 
operation, or it may be temporary. You want a method to add and remove the task 
easily without changing the other code. 
In Chapter 11, you learned how to create and apply an advice. Advice is useful 
when you want to perform a different concern from the main concern. In addition 
to implementing and using advice, Hibernate 3 provides an event/listener model 
which is useful in such cases. Using this feature, you can create a listener class that 
is notified when a particular persistence event occurs. You should then register the 
listener programmatically with the Configuration instance that you use to build 
SessionFactory. It is also possible to configure the listener declaratively in the 
hibernate.cfg.xml file.

Some of Hibernate’s Advanced Features
[ 408 ]
Like the event/listener model common in the Java world, any listener is an instance 
of a class that implements a particular interface. An event is also an instance of a 
particular event class. The following table shows the listener interfaces, the events 
that notify them, and the associated persistence operations that fire the events:

Some of Hibernate’s Advanced Features
[ 410 ]
To use any of the listeners listed in the table above, you must implement the 
appropriate listener interface and override the required methods. You should then 
apply the listener either declaratively, through the Hibernate configuration file, or 
programmatically, via the Configuration object. The following code shows 
an example:
package com.packtpub.springhibernate.appendix;
import org.hibernate.HibernateException;
import org.hibernate.event.SaveOrUpdateEvent;
import org.hibernate.event.SaveOrUpdateEventListener; 
import org.apache.log4j.Level;
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
public class SaveNewCourseListener implements 
SaveOrUpdateEventListener {
  static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(SaveNewCourseListener.
class);
  public void onSaveOrUpdate(SaveOrUpdateEvent event) throws
HibernateException {
    if (event.getObject() instanceof Course) {
      Course c = (Course) event.getObject();
      logSaveOrUpdate(c);
    }
  }
  private void logSaveOrUpdate (Course c) {
    // prepare the message
    String message = c + " is added.";
    logger.log(Level.INFO, message);
  }
}
In the previous table, you can see the SaveOrUpdateEventListener listener is called 
when Session.save(), Session.update(), or Session.saveOrUpdate() is called. 
This means onSaveOrUpdate() is called by these Session methods.
After all, you may apply the implemented listener declaratively in the Hibernate 
configuration file as follows:
<hibernate-configuration>
    <session-factory>
        <listener type="save-update"              class="com.packtpub.
springhibernate.appendix.SaveNewCourseListener"/>
        …
    </session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>

Appendix
[ 411 ]
The <session-factory> element can nest with an arbitrary number of <listener> 
elements. Each <listener> element identifies a particular listener with the type and 
class attributes, which specify, respectively, the type of the listener and the class of 
the listener.
Alternatively, you can apply the implemented interface programmatically to the 
Configuration object as follows:
Configuration config = new Configuration();
config.setListener("save-update", new SaveNewCourseListener());
Interceptor
Hibernate provides full control of an object's states in its life cycle, allowing you 
to define custom behaviors when the object's state changes. Hibernate can do this 
thanks to interceptors and listeners. An interceptor is an old mechanism used by 
Hibernate 2.x. Hibernate 3 introduced the event/listener model instead, but has not 
removed support for interceptors. Although any interceptor lets you define custom 
behaviors for all object states, listeners are used at a particular state of an object. To 
define an interceptor, first implement the Interceptor interface and override the 
appropriate methods, and then apply it to the Configuration or Session object. 
Notice that the implemented interceptor cannot be declared declaratively through 
either the configuration file or the mapping files. Here are some methods of the org.
hibernate.Interceptor interface:
afterTransactionBegin(): Is called after the transaction is started 
via calling of Session.beginTransaction() This is called if Spring 
manages transactions. 
beforeTransactionCompletion(): Is called before a transaction is 
completed, but not before rollback. This method can be used to roll back 
the transaction.
afterTransactionCompletion(): Is called after the transaction is 
committed or rolled back.
instantiate(): Is always called when the Session needs to create a new 
instance of the persistent class. This method is useful when the persistent 
class does not have a default constructor and Hibernate does not know 
how to instantiate the persistent class. If the persistent class does not 
have a constructor, create and return an instance of the persistent class, 
otherwise return null.

[ 412 ]
onSave(): Is called before a persistent instance is saved. You may use this 
method to change the persistent instance's state. If you want to change the 
state of the persistent instance before the instance is saved, return true, 
otherwise return false. 
onDelete(): Is called before a persistent instance is removed. 
onLoad(): Is called immediately before a persistent instance is initialized 
from the database.
getEntity(): Is called by the Session object to look up the second-level 
cache when a persistent instance is not found in the Session's own cache.
getEntityName(): Is called by the Session to determine a persistent 
object's name. 
isTransient(): Is called by the Session to determine whether the instance 
being saved is a transient instance.
preFlush(): Is called immediately before Session.flush() is called.
onFlushDirty(): Is called when the session is flushed after the persistent 
instance is identified as dirty. 
findDirty(): Is called when Session.flush() is called. This method 
returns an array of int, which indicates that the indices of the dirty 
properties have changed and need to update, or it returns null when 
no property needs to update. This method may be used to change the 
persistent instance's state. To change the instance's state return true, 
otherwise return false.
postFlush(): Is called after a flush. 
Hibernate provides a default implementation class for the Interceptor 
interface, called org.hibernate.EmptyInterceptor. This default 
avoids implementing unnecessary methods when you do not actually 
need them.
Let's look at a simple example to see how to implement a Hibernate interceptor.
Suppose we want the application to log every student's result when the system 
administrator enters exam results (passed, failed, or conditional) into the system. 
The results are then stored in the database. Because printing the results and storing 
the objects are clearly distinct concerns, we may prefer to use an interceptor to 
implement the reporting rule. The following code shows an interceptor class in 
which the onSave() and afterTransactionCompletion() methods have been 
implemented. Notice that the onSave() method holds all of the entities saved in 
a HashSet object. After the transaction has been committed, all held objects are 
retrieved from the HashSet and an appropriate form printed for each:

After an interceptor has been implemented, it should either be applied to 
the Configuration or a Session object. Notice that when it applies to the 
Configuration object, it means that the interceptor should be applied to the 
persisting objects of all entity classes. In contrast, when the interceptor applies 
to a Session object, it only applies to the persisting objects that are persisted by 
that session. 
In our example, we are only concerned with Student objects, so we apply the 
implemented interceptor only to the Session object that is specifically used to 
save Student objects:
Course course = …//new instantiated course
CourseSavingInterceptor interceptor = new CourseSavingInterceptor();
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure();
SessionFactory sf = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
Session session = sf.openSession(interceptor); 
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
session.save(course); // Triggers onSave() of the Interceptor
tx.commit();
session.close();
Spring AOP can do the same work. Typically, Spring AOP is preferred 
because it allows you to do all of your work declaratively.
Alternatively, the interceptor may be applied to the Configuration object. This 
means that the interceptor will be applied to all of the Session:
new Configuration().setInterceptor(new CourseSavingInterceptor());
Filters
There are situations where you may want to work with a subset of objects, instead 
of the entire set of objects. In such situations, you may implement appropriate 
HQL expressions to load the desired objects. This is not a good practice, because 
you always need to call HQL expressions to load the objects. In our example of an 
education system application, suppose a requirement indicates that the application 
must be implemented so that we can configure it to view and use the information 
for only current students, only those students who have graduated, or only those 
students older than a specified age.

Appendix
[ 415 ]
Hibernate allows us to filter the returned objects at the Session level. To use filters, 
follow these three steps:
1.	 Define a filter: This step includes filter definition in the mapping files 
through the <filter-def> elements.
2.	 Apply the filter: This step includes using the <filter> element inside of the 
mapping definitions to refer to the defined filter.
3.	 Enable the filter and set up parameters: You do this by invoking the 
enableFilter() method of Session, which returns an object of 
org.hibernate.Filter used for setting up the filter's parameters. 
You must specify the filter's runtime criteria restrictions.
The sections that follow elaborate on these steps.
Defining a filter
Hibernate filters are defined through <filter-def> elements inside the mapping 
files. This element assigns a name to the filter. After that time, the filter is referred 
to by that name. The <filter-def> element comes with an arbitrary number 
of <filter-param> elements, which specify the filter's parameter names. Each 
<filter-param> element comes with name and type attributes, which specify 
the name and the type of each parameter, respectively. The following snippet 
shows a filter definition: 
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class ...
  </class>
  <filter-def name="statusFilter">
    <filter-param name="status" type="boolean"/>
  </filter-def>
</hibernate-mapping>

Some of Hibernate’s Advanced Features
[ 416 ]
Applying the filter
In the second step, apply the defined filter to the target class or classes through the 
mapping definition. For this purpose, you need to insert the <filter> element 
inside the <class> element, and refer back to the defined filter using its name and 
parameters. The <filter> element comes with two attributes, name and condition, 
which specify, respectively, the filter being used and the restrictions the filter uses. 
The following snippet shows how to do this step:
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC 
    "-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD//EN"
    "http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd">
<hibernate-mapping>
  <class …
    <filter name="statusFilter" condition=":status=studentStatus"/>
  </class>
  <filter-def name="statusFilter">
    <filter-param name="status" type="boolean"/>
  </filter-def>
</hibernate-mapping>
Enabling the filter and setting up parameters
Although you have called a filter in the mapping of a persistent class, the filter 
will not be applied unless it is enabled programmatically. To use the filter, you 
must enable it and pass the parameters' values. The Session interface provides the 
enableFilter() method, which takes the filter name as a String argument, and 
returns an object of type org.hibernate.Filter to be used as a reference to set 
the parameters:
org.hibernate.Filter enableFilter(String filterName)
The org.hibernate.Filter interface provides the following methods for setting up 
parameter values:
org.hibernate.Filter setParameter(String paramName, 
                                       Object paramValue)
org.hibernate.Filter setParameterList(String paramName, 
                                       Collection paramValues)
org.hibernate.Filter setParameterList(String paramName, 
                                       Object[] paramValues)

Appendix
[ 417 ]
The first setParameter() methods set paramValue for a given parameter, with the 
name paramName. Two other methods are used for setting parameter values using an 
IN clause. 
The following snippet shows how the filter defined in the previous examples is 
applied to Student objects:
Filter f = session.enableFilter("statusFilter");
f.setParameter("status", Boolean.TRUE);
List results = session.createQuery("from Student").list();
More on Hibernate configuration
Although database properties, dialect, and mapping files are the most important 
parts of a Hibernate configuration file, Hibernate's configuration properties include 
far more than what you have seen so far. This section discusses some of these 
configuration properties.
JDBC properties
These properties relate directly to the java.sql.Connection and 
java.sql.Statement objects, which Hibernate uses behind the scenes 
to interact with the database:
hibernate.jdbc.fetch_size: This property specifies the number of 
database rows that are buffered with every fetch. Using this property 
can improve performance when the application retrieves many rows. 
The optimized value can be achieved by balancing memory usage and 
network traffic. To use this property, the database driver must support 
this functionality. The default value depends on the java.sql.Statement 
implementation used by the database driver. However, you can set the 
desired value by calling Statement.setFetchSize().
hibernate.jdbc.batch_size: This property determines the maximum 
batch size for updates. When the session is flushed, modified objects are 
synchronized with the database through a JDBC batch. Configure this 
property with the maximum batch updates that may potentially occur: 
the recommended values are between 5 and 30.
hibernate.jdbc.batch_versioned_data: If the used JDBC driver 
has been properly implemented, and returns the correct row count for 
executeBatch(), true is used for this option. Hibernate uses the return 
value of this method to check whether a batch update was successful. The 
default value is false.

[ 418 ]
hibernate.jdbc.use_scrollable_resultset: This property determines 
whether Hibernate uses the JDBC2 scrollable resultsets for a user-provided 
JDBC. This property is only necessary when you are using user-supplied 
JDBC connections. Otherwise, Hibernate uses connection metadata.
hibernate.jdbc.use_streams_for_binary: This property specifies 
whether the binary data or Serializable types are read or written over 
JDBC as streams.
hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys: This allows Hibernate to use 
natively generated keys after SQL INSERT statements if the JDBC driver 
supports JDBC3 autogenerated key feature. Set it to false if your driver 
has problems with the Hibernate identifier generators. If this property is 
not specified, Hibernate tries to determine the driver capabilities by using 
connection metadata.
hibernate.connection.provider_class: This indicates a class that 
implements the org.hibernate.connection.ConnectionProvider 
interface and provides java.sql.Connection objects for Hibernate. Use 
this option if you want to provide Connection objects in a specific way. 
hibernate.connection.isolation: This determines the transaction 
isolation level that JDBC connections use in Hibernate. The valid values 
have been defined as static members in java.sql.Connection. The default 
isolation level of the DBMS is usually read as committed or repeatable read. 
It can change either on the application side (through this property) or on the 
database side (through database configuration). Not all databases support all 
isolation levels. Look at Chapter 12 for more details.
hibernate.connection.autocommit: This property turns autocommit 
behavior on or off for JDBC connections. Autocommit is disabled by default.
hibernate.connection.<propertyName>: This configures the 
propertyName of the JDBC connection used by Hibernate.
hibernate.jndi.<propertyName>: This passes the property propertyName 
to the JNDI InitialContextFactorys. Use this option when Hibernate uses 
a container-managed data source.

Hibernate properties
This section describes properties directly related to Hibernate. Use these 
configuration settings to optimize Hibernate's performance:
hibernate.show_sql: This property enables or disables the printing of all 
SQL executed by Hibernate to the console. This option can be a problem in a 
high transactional system, so it is useful only in the development time, and 
not deployment. The right approach to monitor SQL is to enable SQL-logging 
of Hibernate, as you will see in the coming section. 
hibernate.default_schema: This specifies the default database schema for 
which Hibernate generates unqualified table names in the generated SQL.
hibernate.session_factory_name: This binds the Hibernate 
SessionFactory to a JNDI node when Configuration.
buildSessionFactory() is called. It then lets you access the 
SessionFactory object by looking up the bound SessionFactory object 
anywhere in the application.
hibernate.max_fetch_depth: This property determines the maximum 
depth size to which Hibernate will go when fetching the outer-join fetch tree. 
By default, no limit is set. The recommended values are between 1 and 5. A 
value of 0 disables join fetching.
hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size: This sets a default size for 
Hibernate batch fetching of associations. The recommended values 
are 4, 8, 16.
hibernate.order_updates: This property forces Hibernate to order SQL 
updates by the primary key value of the items being updated, resulting in 
fewer transaction deadlocks in highly concurrent systems.

hibernate.generate_statistics: Hibernate can be configured to collect 
statistics about the persistent operations that are performed. These statistics 
are useful for performance tuning. Typical information includes flush count, 
delete count, insert count, query execution count, second-level cache look 
up counts, and so on. hibernate.generate_statistics indicates whether 
Hibernate collects these statistics. The collected statistics, represented 
as an object of org.hibernate.stat.Statistics, can be obtained 
programmatically by the SessionFactory's getStatistics() method. It 
is also possible to publish these statistics through a JMX MBean whether the 
Hibernate application is a standalone application or a JEE application. For 
information about how to use JMX with Hibernate statistics, look at 
https://www.hibernate.org/216.html. The following code shows 
an example of how to obtain these statistics:
Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
cfg.configure();
SessionFactory sf = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
Statistics stats =sf.getStatistics();
stats.setStatisticsEnabled(true);
stats.getSessionOpenCount();
stats.logSummary();//logs main statistics in the log file
long flushcount = stats.getFlushCount();
long deletecount = stats.getEntityDeleteCount();
long insertcount = stats.getEntityInsertCount();
long queryCount = stats.getQueryExecutionCount();
long lookupCacheCount = stats.getSecondLevelCacheHitCount();
hibernate.use_sql_comments: This property causes Hibernate to put 
comments inside all SQL statements executed by Hibernate, which may help 
in debugging code. You can also set a custom comment for query expressions 
through the setComment() method for all of the org.hibernate.Query, 
org.hibernate.SQLQuery, org.hibernate.Criteria instances, as follows:
Query query =  session.createQuery("from Student");
query.setComment("HQL-Select All Students: ");
SQLQuery sqlQuery = session.createSQLQuery("SELECT * FROM 
STUDENT");
sqlQuery.setComment("SQL-Select All Students: ");
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.setComment("Criteria-Select All Students: ");
This option is useful for tracking Hibernate-generated SQL for optimization.

[ 421 ]
Cache properties
The properties described in this section relate to second-level cache configuration:
hibernate.cache.provider_class: This specifies the second-level cache 
provider for Hibernate by determining the name of a class that implements 
the org.hibernate.cache.CacheProvider interface. 
hibernate.cache.use_minimal_puts: This property enhances 
second-level cache performance by forcing Hibernate to add an item to 
the cache, only after ensuring that the item isn't already cached. This 
option is helpful when you're using cluster cache providers and writing 
to the cache is more expensive than reading.
hibernate.cache.use_query_cache: This property triggers Hibernate 
to cache each query result in queries for which caching is enabled 
programmatically through the setCacheable(true) method, as follows:
Query query =  session.createQuery("from Student");
query.setCacheable(true);
SQLQuery sqlQuery = session.createSQLQuery("SELECT * FROM 
STUDENT");
sqlQuery.setCacheable(true);
Criteria criteria = session.createCriteria(Student.class);
criteria.setCacheable(true);
Note that no query result is cached by default.
hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache: This enables or disables 
second-level cache service. Using false for this property disables all other 
cache-related settings.
hibernate.cache.region_prefix: Use this property when the 
application works with multiple databases, and therefore with multiple 
SessionFactorys. Because a persistent instance may belong to different 
databases, you must refer to each instance with a prefix. This property 
specifies a region-name prefix for a particular SessionFactory. For instance, 
with the prefix db1, Student objects are cached in an area of the cache named 
db1.com.packtpub.springhibernate.appendix.Student.

Transaction properties
This section describes configuration settings for transaction management:
hibernate.transaction.factory_class: This setting determines if an 
implementation of org.hibernate.transaction.TransactionFactory 
is used by Hibernate to obtain Transaction objects. The default value is 
org.hibernate.transaction.JDBCTransactionFactory, used for the 
transaction API in Java SE and in direct JDBC.
jta.UserTransaction: This determines a JNDI name that points to a 
javax.transaction.UserTransaction object, held by the application 
server, and looked up by JTATransactionFactory.
hibernate.transaction.manager_lookup_class: This property 
specifies a class which implements the org.hibernate.transaction.
TransactionManagerLookup interface. Hibernate uses this class to find the 
JTA implementation on which the application deploys.
hibernate.transaction.flush_before_completion: This determines 
whether the session is automatically flushed before the transaction is 
complete. If set to true, the property makes flushing part of the transaction 
manager's internal synchronization procedure.
hibernate.transaction.auto_close_session: This determines whether 
the session is automatically closed after the transaction is complete. If set to 
true, the property makes session closing part of the transaction manager's 
internal synchronization procedure.
Logging configuration in Hibernate
To provide logging, Hibernate uses SLF4J  (http://www.slf4j.org) as the logging 
framework. SLF4J does not provide a logging alternative to Log4j, the Java logging 
API, or to any other. Instead, it is an API that sits on top of these other APIs to 
provide you with a common logging API to use in the source code. It forwards all 
logging events to either a logging framework, such as Log4j, the Java logging API, 
JCL, or so on. For each supported logging framework, SLF4J provides a JAR file, 
called SLF4J Binding, that must be in the application classpath when that framework 
is used as the underlying logging framework. For instance, SLF4J provides 
slf4j-log4j12.jar for Log4j that must be in the classpath when SLF4J is used 
with Log4j. Note that to use Log4j, you must put log4j.properties, the Log4j 
configuration file, in the root of the application classpath.

Appendix
[ 423 ]
The following table shows Hibernate's categories for log messages:
Category
Function
org.hibernate.SQL
Log all SQL DML statements when they are 
executed
org.hibernate.type
Log all JDBC parameters
org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl
Log all SQL DDL statements as they are executed
org.hibernate.cache
Log all second-level cache activity
org.hibernate.transaction
Log transaction-related activity
org.hibernate.jdbc
Log all JDBC resource acquisitions
org.hibernate.secure
Log all JAAS authorization requests
org.hibernate
Log everything (a lot of information, but very 
useful for troubleshooting)
The practical approach to monitor the generated SQL is using the 
debug level for the category org.hibernate.SQL. Do not enable 
the hibernate.show_sql property in the production system.

Thank you for buying 
Spring Persistence with

Packt Open Source Project Royalties
When we sell a book written on an Open Source project, we pay a royalty directly to that 
project. Therefore by purchasing Spring Persistence with Hibernate, Packt will have given 
some of the money received to the Spring project and Hibernate project.
In the long term, we see ourselves and you—customers and readers of our books—as part of 
the Open Source ecosystem, providing sustainable revenue for the projects we publish on. 
Our aim at Packt is to establish publishing royalties as an essential part of the service and 
support a business model that sustains Open Source.
If you're working with an Open Source project that you would like us to publish on, and 
subsequently pay royalties to, please get in touch with us.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals 
should be sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you 
would like to discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our 
commissioning editors will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective 
MySQL Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing 
highly focused books on specific technologies and solutions.  
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting 
and customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books 
give you the knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using 
to get the job done. Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have 
seen in the past. Our unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, 
giving you more of what you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality, 
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike. For 
more information, please visit our website: www.PacktPub.com.
