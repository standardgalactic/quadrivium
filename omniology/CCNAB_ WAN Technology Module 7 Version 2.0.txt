The following information is for FCC compliance of Class A devices: This equipment has been tested and 
found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC rules. These limits 
are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a 
commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio-frequency energy and, if not 
installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio 
communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference, in 
which case users will be required to correct the interference at their own expense.  

 
 
The following information is for FCC compliance of Class B devices: The equipment described in this manual 
generates and may radiate radio-frequency energy. If it is not installed in accordance with Cisco’s installation 
instructions, it may cause interference with radio and television reception. This equipment has been tested and 
found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device in accordance with the specifications in part 15 of 
the FCC rules. These specifications are designed to provide reasonable protection against such interference in a 
residential installation. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular 
installation.  
You can determine whether your equipment is causing interference by turning it off. If the interference stops, it 
was probably caused by the Cisco equipment or one of its peripheral devices. If the equipment causes 
interference to radio or television reception, try to correct the interference by using one or more of the 
following measures: 
• Turn the television or radio antenna until the interference stops. 
• Move the equipment to one side or the other of the television or radio. 
• Move the equipment farther away from the television or radio. 
• Plug the equipment into an outlet that is on a different circuit from the television or radio. (That is, make 
certain the equipment and the television or radio are on circuits controlled by different circuit breakers or 
fuses.)  
Modifications to this product not authorized by Cisco Systems, Inc. could void the FCC approval and negate 
your authority to operate the product.

A wide-area network (WAN) is a data communications network that covers a 
125 
relatively broad geographic area and that often uses transmission facilities provided 
126 
by common carriers, such as telephone companies.  
127 
 
128 
WAN connections may be made through a service provider in several ways, 
129 
including (see Figure [1]):  
130 
 
131 
I 
Dialup: Dialup lines are paid for only when they are used. Dialup lines are 
132 
perfect for the small or branch office or for telecommuters or mobile 
133 
workers. This means that the line is active only when the user dials up.  
134 
The disadvantage of dialup connection is that the connection speed is slow 
135 
(less than 56 Kbps). 
136 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 7: WAN Technologies 
7-7 
I 
ISDN: Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is an efficient 
137 
alternative to dialup for connecting over basic telephone service (POTS). 
138 
ISDN is explained further in this lesson.  
139 
I 
Leased line: Service providers also offer leased lines, or point-to-point 
140 
connections. With leased lines, companies pay for a continuous connection 
141 
between two remote sites. This means the line is active 24 hours a day, 7 
142 
days a week. The disadvantage of leased lines is that they are generally 
143 
expensive, and the expense is related to distance. 
144 
I 
Frame Relay: Frame Relay provides connection-oriented data link layer 
145 
communication. This service is implemented using virtual circuits.  
146 
A virtual circuit is a logical circuit created to ensure reliable 
147 
communication between two remote network devices. For example, Figure 
148 
[2] shows a hub and spoke topology used to connect a headquarter router to 
149 
three remote routers. Even though the headquarter router only has one 
150 
physical connection to the service provider (like a Frame Relay service 
151 
provider), that physical connection is logically divided into three logical 
152 
connections (virtual circuits), with each virtual circuit connecting to a 
153 
different remote router. At the remote routers, their physical connection will 
154 
only contain one virtual circuit since the remote routers only need to 
155 
connect to the headquarter router. 
156 
Frame Relay works at Layer 2 of the OSI reference model, within the Frame 
157 
Relay (Layer 2) header, there is an identifier (Data Link Connection 
158 
Identifier [DLCI]) used to indicate which virtual circuit a frame belongs to, 
159 
the Frame Relay service provider make its switching decision based on the 
160 
DLCI. In Figure [2], the headquarter Frame Relay connection is provisioned 
161 
with three virtual circuits. The headquarter router will use DLCI 102 in the 
162 
Frame Relay header for sending data to the LA router, DLCI 101 for the NY 
163 
router, and DLCI 100 for the Chicago router.  
164 
I 
ATM: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) comprises specifications at 
165 
both the physical and data link layers. Like Frame Relay, this service is 
166 
implemented using virtual circuits. With ATM, the data packet is divided 
167 
into small 53 bytes cells before it is transmitted. In the ATM cell header, 
168 
there a field called the VPI/VCI (Virtual Path Identifier/Virtual Channel 
169 
Identifier) used to indicate which virtual circuit an ATM cell belongs to. At 
170 
the physical layer, ATM can run over a variety of physical media, including 
171 
fiber optics using SONET framing and coaxial cable using digital signal 
172 
level 3 (DS3).  
173 
I 
Other: Additional WAN connection options include using DSL, cable, 
174 
wireless, and X.25. 
175 
 
176 
WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the OSI reference 
177 
model: the physical layer, the data link layer, and the network layer. WAN 
178 
connections can be purchased or leased in a variety of speeds or bandwidths. Start 
179 
with the simple DS0 (64 Kbps), which is the speed of a typical digitized phone call. 
180 
Bundle (Multiplexing) 24 DS0s to get a DS1/T1 line (1.544 Mbps). Then bundle 
181 
(Multiplex) 28 DS1s to get a DS3/T3 (44.736 Mbps). The DS technically refers to 
182 
the rate and format of the signal, whereas the T designation refers to the equipment 
183 
providing the signals. In practice, “DS” and “T” are used synonymously (see Figure 
184 
[3]).  
185 
 
186

E1 (2.048 Mbps) and E3 (34.368 Mbps) are European standards similar to T1 and 
187 
T3, but they possess different bandwidths.  
188 
 
189 
Multiplexing is a process in which multiple data channels are combined into a 
190 
single data or physical channel at the source. Multiplexing can be implemented at 
191 
any of the OSI layers. Broadband WAN lines use multiplexing technology.  
192 
 
193 
Demultiplexing is the process of separating multiplexed data channels at the 
194 
destination.  
195 
 
196 
There are four primary types of multiplexing (see Figures [4]):  
197 
 
198 
I 
Time-division multiplexing (TDM): In TDM, information from each data 
199 
channel is allocated bandwidth based on preassigned time slots, regardless 
200 
of whether there is data to transmit (see Figure [5]). As a result, bandwidth 
201 
is wasted when a data channel has nothing to transmit during its assigned 
202 
time slot.  
203 
I 
Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM): In FDM, information from each 
204 
data channel is allocated bandwidth based on the signal frequency of the 
205 
traffic (see Figure [6]). For example, FM radio broadcast used FDM. Each 
206 
FM station is assigned a specific frequency to use for broadcasting their 
207 
radio programs. 
208 
I 
Statistical multiplexing (STM): In statistical multiplexing, bandwidth is 
209 
dynamically allocated to any data channels that have information to transmit 
210 
(see Figure [7]). With STM, bandwidth is not wasted when a data channel 
211 
has nothing to transmit, because the time slot is given to a data channel that 
212 
has something to transmit.  
213 
I 
Wave-division multiplexing (WDM) and dense WDM (DWDM): These 
214 
optical multiplexing technologies are discussed in Module 9 of this course.  
215

238 
Packet switching is a WAN switching method in which users share common carrier 
239 
resources. Because this allows the carrier to make more efficient use of its 
240 
infrastructure, the cost to the customer is generally much better than with point-to-
241 
point lease lines. In a packet switching setup, networks have connections into the 
242 
carrier's network, and many customers share the carrier's network. The carrier can 
243 
then create virtual circuits between customers' sites by which packets of data are 
244 
delivered from one to the other through the network. The section of the carrier's 
245 
network that is shared is often referred to as a cloud. Frame Relay is an example or 
246 
packet-switched WAN technology (see Figure [1]). 
247 
 
248 
Circuit switching is a WAN switching method in which a dedicated physical circuit 
249 
is established, maintained, and terminated through a carrier network for each 
250 
communication session (see Figure [2]). 
251 
 
252 
Circuit switching operates much like a normal telephone call and is used extensively 
253 
in telephone company networks. ISDN is an example of a circuit-switched WAN 
254 
technology.

7.1.3 Leased Line 
264 
Figure 1: Leased Line  
265 
 
266 
 
267 
A point-to-point link provides a single, pre-established WAN communications path 
268 
from the customer premises through a carrier network, such as a telephone 
269 
company, to a remote network. Point-to-point lines are usually leased from a carrier 
270 
and thus are often called leased lines. For a point-to-point line, the carrier allocates 
271 
pairs of wire and facility hardware to your line only. These circuits are generally 
272 
priced based on bandwidth required and distance between the two connected points. 
273 
Point-to-point links are generally more expensive than shared services such as 
274 
Frame Relay. The cost of leased-line solutions can become significant when they 
275 
are used to connect many sites. 
276 
 
277 
When leased-line connections are made, a router serial port is required for each 
278 
connection, along with a channel/data service unit (CSU/DSU) and the actual circuit 
279 
from the service provider. The CSU is a device that performs diagnostic functions 
280 
(like loopback test) for a telecommunications line. The DSU is a device that 
281 
connects a terminal (like a router serial port) to a digital line (like a T1). Typically, 
282 
the two devices are packaged as a single unit. You can think of it as a very high-
283 
powered and expensive modem, which connects to a digital line (like a T1). Such a 
284 
device is required for both ends of a T-1 or T-3 connection, and the units at both 
285 
ends must be set to the same communications standard.

Frame Relay devices have two classes: 
312 
 
313 
I 
Data terminal equipment (DTE): Terminating equipment for a specific 
314 
network and typically located on customer premises. Examples of a Frame 
315 
Relay DTE device is a router or a FRAD (Frame Relay Access Device) 
316 
I 
Data communications equipment (DCE): Carrier-owned internetworking 
317 
devices that provide clocking and switching services within a network. 
318 
Example of a Frame Relay DCE device is the Frame Relay Switch. 
319 
 
320 
Frame Relay Virtual Circuits 
321 
A Frame Relay virtual circuit is a logical connection created between two DTE 
322 
devices across a Frame Relay network (see Figure [1]). Frame Relay virtual circuits 
323 
fall into two categories: 
324 
 
325 
I 
Permanent virtual circuit (PVC)  
326 
I 
Switched virtual circuit (SVC) 
327 
Virtual circuits provide a bidirectional communications path from one DTE device 
328 
to another. A data-link connection identifier (DLCI) within the Frame Relay address 
329 
header uniquely identifies them.  
330 
 
331 
A virtual circuit can pass through any number of intermediate DCE devices (Frame 
332 
Relay switches) located within the Frame Relay packet-switched network (PSN). 
333 
Numerous virtual circuits can be multiplexed into a single physical circuit for 
334 
transmission across the network.  
335 
 
336 
PVC [2] 
337 
PVCs are permanently established connections that are used when there is frequent 
338 
and consistent data transfer between DTE devices across the Frame Relay network. 
339 
Communication across a PVC does not require the call setup and termination states 
340 
that are used with SVCs. DTE devices can begin transferring data whenever they 
341 
are ready because the circuit is permanently established. PVC works like a lease-
342 
line connection, it is always connected. 
343 
 
344 
SVC [3] 
345 
SVCs are temporary connections that are used when there is only sporadic data 
346 
transfer between DTE devices across the Frame Relay network. After the virtual 
347 
circuit is terminated, the DTE devices must establish a new SVC if there is 
348 
additional data to be exchanged. SVC works like a dialup connection, where a call 
349 
has to be made before the data can be transmitted, like making a telephone call.

7.1.5 ATM and Cell Switching 
361 
Figure 1: ATM and Cell Switching  
362 
 
363 
 
364 
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a technology that is capable of transferring 
365 
voice, video, and data through private and public networks. It is built on a cell-based 
366 
architecture rather than a frame-based architecture. ATM cells are always a fixed 
367 
length of 53 bytes, whereas the sizes of frames and packets vary. The 53 bytes ATM 
368 
cell is made up of a 5 bytes ATM header followed by 48 bytes of ATM Payload 
369 
(User Data). Small fixed-length 53 bytes cells are well-suited for carrying data, 
370 
voice, and video traffic because voice and video traffic are intolerant of delay that 
371 
can result from having to wait for a larger data packet to be transmitted ahead of a 
372 
voice or video packet. 
373 
 
374 
An ATM switch is responsible for cell transit through an ATM network. It accepts 
375 
the incoming cell from an ATM endpoint or another ATM switch. It then reads and 
376 
updates the cell-header information and quickly switches the cell to an output 
377 
interface toward its destination. 
378 
 
379 
ATM is used primarily in enterprise LAN backbones or WAN links.  
380 
 
381 
An ATM virtual circuit is a logical connection created between two ATM endpoints 
382 
across an ATM network. ATM virtual circuits fall into two categories: 
383 
 
384 
I 
Permanent virtual circuit (PVC)  
385 
I 
Switched virtual circuit (SVC) 
386 
 
387 
Virtual circuits provide a bidirectional communications path from one ATM 
388 
endpoint to another. The VPI/VCI (Virtual Path Identifier/Virtual Channel 
389 
Identifier) within the ATM cell header uniquely identifies them.  
390 
 
391 
A virtual circuit can pass through any number of intermediate ATM switches in the 
392 
ATM network. Numerous virtual circuits can be multiplexed into a single physical 
393 
circuit for transmission across the network.

Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) refers to a set of communication 
475 
protocols proposed by telephone companies to permit telephone networks to carry 
476 
data, voice, and video (see Figure [1]).  
477 
 
478 
In general, ISDN provides a set of digital services that concurrently deliver voice, 
479 
data, text, graphics, music, video, and information to end users. ISDN was 
480 
developed to permit faster access over existing telephone systems without the 
481 
additional call setup time.  
482 
 
483 
ISDN offers two types of services: Basic Rate Interface (BRI) or Primary Rate 
484 
Interface (PRI). 
485 
 
486 
The ISDN BRI service, intended for the home and small enterprise, provides two B 
487 
channels (128 Kbps) and one D channel (16 Kbps). The BRI B channel carries user 
488 
data, whereas the BRI D channel usually carries control and signaling information.  
489 
  
490 
The ISDN PRI service, intended for larger installations, delivers 23 B channels and 
491 
one D channel in North America for a total bit rate of up to 1.544 Mbps (T1).

515 
In the late 1980s, Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) was limiting growth of the 
516 
Internet. Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) was created to solve remote Internet 
517 
connectivity problems (see Figure [1). Additionally, PPP was needed to be able to 
518 
dynamically assign IP addresses and allow for use of multiple routed protocols. PPP 
519 
provides router-to-router and host-to-network connections over both synchronous 
520 
and asynchronous circuits.  
521 
PPP 
Encapsulation

Module 7: WAN Technologies 7-21 
 
522 
The PPP provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over 
523 
point-to-point links. PPP is comprised of three main components (see Figure [2]):  
524 
 
525 
I 
A method for encapsulating multi-protocol datagrams.  
526 
I 
A Link Control Protocol (LCP) for establishing, configuring, and testing the 
527 
data-link connection.  
528 
I 
A family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and 
529 
configuring different network-layer protocols.  
530 
 
531 
In order to be sufficiently versatile to be portable to a wide variety of environments, 
532 
PPP provides a Link Control Protocol (LCP). The LCP is used to automatically 
533 
agree upon the encapsulation format options, handle varying limits on sizes of 
534 
packets, detect a looped-back link and other common misconfiguration errors, and 
535 
terminate the link. Other optional facilities provided are authentication of the 
536 
identity of its peer on the link, and determination when a link is functioning 
537 
properly and when it is failing.  
538 
 
539 
The authentication phase of a PPP session is optional. After the link has been 
540 
established and the authentication protocol chosen, the peer can be authenticated. If 
541 
it is used, authentication takes place before the network-layer protocol configuration 
542 
phase begins.  
543 
 
544 
The authentication options require that the calling side of the link enter 
545 
authentication information to help ensure that the user has the network 
546 
administrator's permission to make the call. Peer routers exchange authentication 
547 
messages. 
548 
 
549 
When configuring PPP authentication, you can select Password Authentication 
550 
Protocol (PAP) or Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP). In 
551 
general, CHAP is the preferred protocol. PAP and CHAP are discussed in the 
552 
following sections. 
553 
 
554 
PPP Encapsulation [3] 
555 
PPP is a standard serial-line encapsulation method (described in RFCs 1332 and 
556 
1661). This protocol can, among other things, check for link quality during 
557 
connection establishment. In addition, there is support for authentication through 
558 
Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) and Challenge Handshake Authentication 
559 
Protocol (CHAP).

7.2.3 PAP 
573 
Figure 1: PAP  
574 
 
575 
 
576 
As shown in Figure [1], PAP provides a simple method for a remote node to 
577 
establish its identity, using a two-way handshake. After the PPP link establishment 
578 
phase is complete, a username/password pair is repeatedly sent by the remote node 
579 
across the link until authentication is acknowledged or the connection is terminated. 
580 
PAP is not a strong authentication protocol. Passwords are sent across the link in 
581 
clear text (not encrypted), and there is no protection from playback or repeated trial-
582 
and-error attacks. The remote node controls the frequency and timing of the login 
583 
attempts. 
584

7.2.4 CHAP 
594 
Figure 1: CHAP  
595 
 
596 
 
597 
CHAP is used to periodically verify the identity of the remote node, using a three-
598 
way handshake, as shown in Figure [1]. This is done upon initial link establishment 
599 
and can be repeated any time after the link has been established. CHAP offers 
600 
features such as periodic verification to improve security, making CHAP more 
601 
effective than PAP. PAP verifies only once, making it vulnerable to hacks and 
602 
modem playback.  
603 
 
604 
Further, PAP allows the caller to attempt authentication at will (without first 
605 
receiving a challenge), making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks, whereas CHAP 
606 
does not allow a caller to attempt authentication without a challenge.  
607 
 
608 
After the PPP link establishment phase is complete, the host sends a challenge 
609 
message to the remote node. The remote node responds with a value. The response 
610 
value is calculated based on the shared password between the two devices. The host 
611 
checks the response against its own calculated value. If the values match, the 
612 
authentication is acknowledged. Otherwise, the connection is terminated. 
613 
 
614 
CHAP provides protection against playback attacks through the use of a variable 
615 
challenge value that is unique and unpredictable. The use of repeated challenges is 
616 
intended to limit the time of exposure to any single attack. The local router (or a 
617 
third-party authentication server, such as Netscape Commerce Server) controls the 
618 
frequency and timing of the challenges.

7.2.5 HDLC

Figure 1: HDLC and Cisco HDLC  
632 
 
633 
 
634 
High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) is an IOS standard data link layer protocol. 
635 
It specifies an encapsulation method for data on synchronous serial data links using 
636 
frame character and checksum. HDLC supports both point-to-point and multipoint 
637 
configurations. No authentication can be used with HDLC. HDLC might not be 
638 
compatible between different vendors because of the way each vendor has chosen to 
639 
implement it. 
640 
 
641 
HDLC is Cisco’s default encapsulation for serial lines. This implementation is very 
642 
streamlined; there is no windowing or flow control, and only point-to-point 
643 
connections are allowed. Cisco’s HDLC is proprietary—it will not communicate 
644 
with any other vendor’s HDLC implementation. 
645 
 
646 
As shown in Figure [1], the reason that each vendor has a proprietary HDLC 
647 
encapsulation method is that each vendor has a different way for the HDLC protocol 
648 
to communicate with the network layer protocols. This proprietary header is placed 
649 
in the data field of the HDLC encapsulation. The Address field is always set to all 
650 
ones. Furthermore, Cisco’s HDLC include a 2-byte proprietary type code is inserted 
651 
after the control field, meaning that the Cisco’s HDLC framing is not interoperable 
652 
with other vendors' equipment.   
653 
 
654 
If both ends of a dedicated-line connection are routers or access servers running 
655 
Cisco IOS® Software, Cisco’s HDLC encapsulation typically is used. Because 
656 
HDLC encapsulation methods may vary, you should use PPP with devices that are 
657 
not running Cisco IOS Software.

A modem is an electronic device that is used for computer communications through 
708 
telephone lines. It allows data transfer between one computer and another over the 
709 
PSTN. Typically, modems send data in blocks of bytes. After each block, some 
710 
basic math is performed to analyze the block, and the computer on the receiving end 
711 
is asked whether it agrees with the results. If any differences appear, the block is

sent again. The modems convert digital data to analog signals and analog signals 
713 
back to digital data.  
714 
 
715 
The term modem actually derives from the function of this device. The process of 
716 
converting analog signals to digital and back again is called 
717 
modulation/demodulation (hence the term modem).  
718 
 
719 
A typical modem connection is depicted in Figure [1]. The modems connect digital 
720 
computers to the digital telecommunications company (Telco) network via analog 
721 
local loops. When the Telco switch receives the modems’s analog signal, it must 
722 
encode the signals so that it can traverse the digital network. 
723 
 
724 
Modem-based transmission is remarkably accurate, despite the fact that telephone 
725 
lines can be quite noisy because of clicks, static, and other problems. 
726 
 
727 
There are four main types of modems:  
728 
 
729 
I 
Expansion cards: They are the most common. They plug into the 
730 
motherboard expansion slots (Industry-Standard Architecture [ISA] or 
731 
peripheral component interconnect [PCI]) and are called internal modems.  
732 
I 
PC Card modems: They are a variation of modems designed for easy 
733 
installation in notebook computers. Also known as PC Cards, they look like 
734 
credit cards and are small and very portable. 
735 
I 
External modems: They can be used with any computer by simply 
736 
plugging into a serial port (COM1 or COM2) on the back of the computer.  
737 
I 
Built-in modems: Some notebook computers have dedicated, built-in 
738 
modems. 
739 
Internal modems simply plug into one of the expansion slots on the motherboard 
740 
(see Figure [2]). These internal modem varieties, therefore, do not take up extra 
741 
space on the desktop. They usually cost a little less than the ones that are plugged 
742 
externally into the computer. To configure them, jumpers may have to be set in 
743 
order to select the interrupt request (IRQ) line and input/output (I/O) addresses. No 
744 
configuration is needed for a “plug-and-play” modem, which is installed on a 
745 
motherboard that supports plug and play. A modem using a serial (COM) port that 
746 
is not yet in use must be configured. Additionally, the software drivers that come 
747 
with the modem must be installed for the modem to work.  
748 
 
749 
External modems are typically a bit more expensive than the internal varieties (see 
750 
Figure [3]). However, they connect to the computer simply by plugging into one of 
751 
the serial ports. The computer case does not have to be opened. Newer universal 
752 
serial bus -(USB) modems are plugged into a USB port or hub. An external modem 
753 
uses the IRQ and I/O address assigned to the serial port. A status light on the 
754 
modem indicates whether or not the modem is on line. Software must be installed in 
755 
order for the external modem to work properly.   
756 
Practice 
757 
1. Which of the following is true of analog modems? 
758 
 
759 
A. They allow data transfer between one computer and another over the 
760 
PSTN. 
761 
B. They send data in blocks of bytes.

7.3.2 Analog Modem Standards 
765 
Figure1: Analog Modem Standards 
766 
Standard  
Meaning  
V.22bis 
The first true worldwide standard for full-duplex modems 
sending and receiving data across telephone line at 2400 bps 
at 600 baud. 
V.32  
The standard for full-duplex modems allows sending and 
receiving data across phone lines at 4800 or 9600 bps at 2400 
baud. V.32 modems automatically adjust their transmission 
speed based on the quality of the lines. 
V.34  
The standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving 
data across phone lines at up to 28.8 Kbps. V.34 modems 
automatically adjust their transmission speed based on the 
quality of the lines. It is backward compatible with V.32. 
V.42  
It has the same transfer rate as V.32, but with better error 
correction and therefore more reliable. V.42 can be used with 
digital telephone networks. 
V.90  
The standard for full-duplex modems sending and receiving 
data across phone lines at up to 56 Kbps downstream. 
 
767 
A modem modulates outgoing digital signals from a computer or other digital device 
768 
to analog signals for a conventional copper twisted pair telephone line and 
769 
demodulates the incoming analog signal and converts it to a digital signal for the 
770 
digital device. Modems work at OSI model Layer 1. At Layer 2, a protocol like PPP 
771 
is often used. 
772 
 
773 
Figure [1] includes several most commonly used modem standards approved by the 
774 
International Telecommunications Union (ITU-T).  
775 
 
776 
The first true worldwide standard for modems is V.22bit, which allows 2400 bits 
777 
per second (bps) at 600 baud. V.34 is a full-duplex modem standard that allows the 
778 
modems to send and receive data across phone lines at up to 28.8 Kbps and 19.2 
779 
Kbps. V.34 modems can automatically adjust their transmission rate according to 
780 
the quality of the phone lines. 
781 
 
782 
V.90 standard was approved by ITU-T in February 1998. V.90 allows the data 
783 
downstream transmission rate up to 56,000 bps and data upstream transmission rate 
784 
up to 33,000 bps. V.90 standard was a combination of the x2 technology from US 
785 
Robotics (now part of 3Com) and the K56flex technology from Rockwell. 
786 
 
787 
In recent years, the 2400 bits per second modem that could carry e-mail has become 
788 
obsolete. 14.4 Kbps and 28.8 Kbps modems were temporary landing places on the 
789 
way to the much higher bandwidth devices and carriers of tomorrow. From early 
790 
1998, most new personal computers came with 56 Kbps modems.

846 
Digital subscriber line (DSL) technology is a modem technology that uses existing 
847 
twisted-pair telephone lines to transport high-bandwidth data, such as multimedia 
848 
and video, to service subscribers. Because DSL uses existing phone lines, in most 
849 
cases there is no need to dig a new trench as with cable or install a dish as with 
850 
wireless (see Figure [1]). Wherever there is a phone line there is the potential of 
851 
getting DSL service, if the line conditions are right, for example, you must be within 
852 
a certain distance of the central office and the central office must have DSL 
853 
equipment to connect to.   
854 
 
855 
Products such as the Cisco 827 ADSL router integrate a fully functional Cisco IOS 
856 
router and DSL modem into one unit (see Figure [2]). 
857 
 
858 
DSL provide a full-time connection. As soon as users turn on their computers 
859 
connected to the DSL modem, they are connected. This setup removes the time and 
860 
effort of dialing in to establish a connection.

870 
Figure 1: DSL Service Types Overview  
871 
 
872 
 
873 
The two basic types of DSL technologies are asymmetric (ADSL) and symmetric 
874 
(SDSL). All forms of DSL service are categorized as one or the other, and there are 
875 
numerous varieties of each type.  
876 
 
877 
The term xDSL is sometimes used to refer generically to any of the various forms 
878 
that exist. Asymmetric service provides a higher download or downstream speed (in 
879 
bits per second, or bps) than upstream speeds. Symmetric service provides the same 
880 
speed in both directions.   
881 
 
882 
Downstream information, such as requested Web pages, comes from the Internet to 
883 
the user (from the central office [CO] to the subscriber). Upstream information is 
884 
sent from the user to the Internet (from the subscriber to the CO). Asymmetric types 
885 
of DSL generally use analog transmission encoding (modulation) technology, 
886 
whereas symmetric forms generally use digital transmission encoding (modulation) 
887 
techniques.

903 
Standards benefit the consumer and the industry in general. They may take a while 
904 
to evolve, but they tend to level the playing field, allowing more competition with 
905 
improved interoperability. They also contribute to consumer confidence. Numerous 
906 
standards organizations and industry consortia have contributed to the evolution of 
907 
DSL. Among these are the DSL Forum, ANSI, ITU-T, DAVIC, and ETSI. Web sites 
908 
for these organizations and others are listed in Figure [1] along with some other 
909 
informative DSL Web sites. 
910

Figure [2] lists each DSL technology and the relevant standards organizations and 
912 
standard numbers associated with those technologies. Not all the DSL technologies 
913 
listed have a standard associated with them. Also listed is the modulation or 
914 
encoding standard(s) used by the DSL modems to place digital data bits onto the 
915 
wire. The most important standards listed in Figure [2] are asymmetric DSL 
916 
standards G.992.1 (G.DMT) and G.992.2 (G.lite) as well as symmetric standard 
917

930 
Figure 1: OSI and DSL Related Protocols  
931 
 
932 
 
933 
DSL operates at Layer 1 or the physical layer of the OSI model. It is basically a bit 
934 
pump data-transmission technology that relies on higher-layer protocols to 
935 
encapsulate the data to the central office and the Internet service provider (ISP). 
936 
Protocols most often include Layer 2 protocols such as Ethernet, ATM, and PPP, as 
937 
well as the IP Layer 3 protocol. Other higher-layer protocols such as Dynamic Host 
938 
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) and services 
939 
such as Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) also play a part in 
940 
the complete DSL picture from subscriber to ISP. The DSL provider and ISP also 
941 
have a choice of providing bridged or routed service to the subscriber.

7.4.5 DSL Benefits 
954 
Figure 1: Advantages and Disadvantages of DSL  
955 
Advantages of DSL 
956 
- 
DSL offers speeds up to and exceeding those of T-1, at just a fraction of 
957 
the cost. 
958 
- 
DSL service can be added incrementally as more users subscribe. 
959 
- 
Both voice and data can be transmitted over the same line at the same 
960 
time. 
961 
- 
DSL is an always-on technology. This means users do not need to dial 
962 
up each time they wish to connect to the Internet.  
963 
- 
DSL is backward compatible with conventional analog phones. 
964 
 
965 
Disadvantage of DSL 
966 
- 
The availability of DSL is presently still limited, with service for most 
967 
“flavors” or varieties only possible for areas that fall within a specified 
968 
number of feed from the telephone company central office (CO) of the 
969 
service provider. 
970 
- 
The telephone company CO that is servicing the location must have DSL 
971 
equipment installed. 
972 
- 
The best form of voice support is still being debated. 
973 
 
974 
DSL service can be added incrementally in any area. That means that the service 
975 
provider can literally start up with a handful of clients and upgrade the bandwidth to 
976 
coincide with the growth in subscriber. DSL is also backward compatible with 
977 
analog voice and makes good use of the existing local loop. This means that very 
978 
little need to be done to use the cable services simultaneously with normal phone 
979 
service. 
980 
 
981 
However, DSL suffers from distance limitations. Most DSL service offerings 
982 
currently require the customer to be within 18,000 feet of the provider’s central 
983 
office (CO) location. Additionally, the longer and older loops present problems, and 
984 
the best form of voice support is still being debated. Also, upstream (upload) speed 
985 
is usually considerably lower than the downstream (download) speed. 
986

988 
 
989 
A. DSL service can be added incrementally in any area.

7.5.1 Cable-Modem Basics 
1031 
Figure 1: Cisco uBR 900 Universal Broadband Router Cable Modem

1033 
 
1034 
Cable modems enable two-way, high-speed data transmissions using the same 
1035 
coaxial lines that transmit cable television. Some cable service providers are 
1036 
promising data speeds up to 6.5 times that of T1 leased lines. This speed makes 
1037 
cable an attractive medium for transferring large amounts of digital information 
1038 
quickly, including video clips, audio files, and large chunks of data. Information that 
1039 
would take two minutes to download using ISDN BRI can be downloaded in two 
1040 
seconds through a cable-modem connection.  
1041 
 
1042 
Cable-modem access provides speeds superior to leased lines, with lower costs and 
1043 
simpler installation. When the cable infrastructure is in place, a firm can connect 
1044 
through installation of a modem or router. Additionally, because cable modems do 
1045 
not use the telephone system infrastructure, there are no local-loop charges. 
1046 
Products such as the Cisco uBR 904 Universal Broadband Router Cable Modem 
1047 
make cable access an even more attractive investment by integrating a fully 
1048 
functional Cisco IOS router, four-port hub, and cable modem into one unit (see 
1049 
Figure [1]). This combination allows businesses to replace combinations of routers, 
1050 
bridges, hubs, and single-port cable modems with one product.  
1051 
 
1052 
Cable modems provide a full-time connection. As soon as users turn on their 
1053 
computers, they are connected to the Internet. This setup removes the time and 
1054 
effort of dialing in to establish a connection. The “always-on” cable connection also 
1055 
means that a company's “information pipe” is open at all times. This setup increases 
1056 
the vulnerability of data to hackers and is a good reason to install firewalls and 
1057 
configure cable routers to maximize security. Fortunately, the industry is moving 
1058 
toward the standardization of cable modems, and the move is likely to address 
1059 
encryption needs. For instance, new models of the Cisco uBR 904 Cable Modem 
1060 
will provide IP Security (IPSec) and firewall capabilities. These features protect 
1061 
company LANs and provide virtual private network (VPN) tunneling, with options 
1062 
for authentication and encryption.

1067 
There is currently no standard for cable modems in the cable access industry. As a 
1068 
result, there are many competing proprietary products. Cable service, speed, 
1069 
reliability, setup, and configurations may vary significantly from one cable company 
1070 
to another. Currently, the most common cable-modem brands are from Cisco 
1071 
Systems, 3Com, Com21, Bay Networks, Motorola, RCA, Toshiba, and Terayon.

1094 
 
1095 
Like analog modems, cable modems modulate and demodulate data signals. 
1096 
However, cable modems incorporate more functionality designed for today’s high-
1097 
speed Internet services. In a cable network, data flowing from the network to the 
1098 
user is referred to as downstream and data flowing from the user to the network is 
1099 
referred to as upstream. From a user perspective, a cable modem is a 64/Quadrature 
1100 
amplitude modulation (QAM) radio frequency (RF) receiver capable of delivering 
1101 
up to 30 to 40 Mbps of data in one 6 MHz cable channel. This is almost 500 times 
1102 
faster than a 56 Kbps modem. The headend manages traffic flow from the user to 
1103 
the network (see Figure [1]). 
1104 
 
1105

Module 7: WAN Technologies 7-45 
Note: Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is a method for encoding digital 
1106 
data in an analog signal in which each combination of phase and amplitude 
1107 
represents one of 16 four-bit patterns. 
1108 
 
1109 
With a cable modem, a subscriber can continue to receive cable television service 
1110 
while simultaneously receiving data to be delivered to a personal computer. This is 
1111 
accomplished with the help of a simple one-to-two splitter (see Figure [2]). The data 
1112 
service offered by a cable modem can be shared by up to 16 users in a LAN 
1113 
configuration.

7.5.3 Cable-Modem Benefits 
1124 
Figure 1: Advantages and Disadvantages of Cable Modems  
1125 
 
1126 
 
1127 
The advantage of using cable-modem high-speed access is that coaxial cable wiring 
1128 
offers greater bandwidth using broadband for more applications to the home 
1129 
network LAN. Additionally, cable lines are already in place in most of the country 
1130 
because of the wide deployment of cable television throughout the last few decades. 
1131 
Therefore, cable-modem high-speed Internet access is more readily available in 
1132 
most areas than DSL. 
1133 
 
1134 
Unfortunately, upgrading of the cabling infrastructure that is needed to support 
1135 
cable-modem technology has been slow, so most homes in the United States cannot 
1136 
use this technology. Upgrading is a big investment, particularly for small providers. 
1137 
Practice 
1138 
1. Which of the following is an advantage of cable modem? 
1139 
 
1140 
A. Upgrading of the cabling infrastructure. 
1141 
B. Because cable modems exist in a shared-media structure, the more users 
1142 
come on the network, the less bandwidth is available for each user. 
1143 
C. Coaxial cable wiring offers greater bandwidth using broadband for 
1144 
more applications to the home network. **

7.5.4 Cable and the OSI Model 
1148 
Figure 1: Cable and the OSI Model  
1149 
 
1150 
 
1151 
The cable data system comprises many different technologies and standards. For 
1152 
cable modems to be mainstreamed, modems from different vendors must 
1153 
interoperable. 
1154 
 
1155 
Physical Layer 
1156 
Downstream Data Channel 
1157 
At the physical layer, downstream data channel is based on North American digital 
1158 
video specifications (specifically, International Telecommunications Union [ITU-T] 
1159 
Recommendation J.83 Annex B) and includes the following features:  
1160 
 
1161 
I 
64 and 256 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)  
1162 
I 
6 MHz-occupied spectrum that coexists with other signals in the cable plant  
1163 
I 
Variable-length interleaving support, both latency-sensitive and latency-
1164 
insensitive data services  
1165 
I 
Contiguous serial bit stream with no implied framing, providing complete 
1166 
physical and MAC-layer decoupling  
1167 
 
1168 
Upstream Data Channel 
1169 
The upstream data channel is a shared channel featuring the following:  
1170 
 
1171 
I 
Quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) and 16 QAM formats  
1172 
I 
Data rates from 320 kbps to 10 Mbps  
1173 
I 
Flexible and programmable cable modem under control of cable modem 
1174 
terminal server (CMTS)  
1175 
I 
Time-division multiple access  
1176 
I 
Support of both fixed-frame and variable-length protocol data units (PDUs)  
1177 
Note: Quaternary phase-shift keying (QPSK) is a digital frequency modulation 
1178 
technique used for sending data over coaxial cable network. 
1179 
 
1180 
Data Link Layer 
1181 
The data link layer provides the general requirements for many cable-modem 
1182 
subscribers to share a single upstream data channel for transmission to the network. 
1183 
Among these requirements are collision detection and retransmission capability. 
1184

The large geographic reach of a cable data network poses special problems. These 
1185 
problems are as a result of the transmission delay between users close to headend 
1186 
versus users at a distance from cable headend. To compensate for cable losses and 
1187 
delay as a result of distance, the MAC layer performs ranging, by which each cable 
1188 
modem can assess time delay in transmitting to the headend. The MAC layer 
1189 
supports:  
1190 
 
1191 
I 
Timing and synchronization  
1192 
I 
Bandwidth allocation to cable modems at the control of CMTS  
1193 
I 
Error detection, handling and error recovery  
1194 
I 
Procedures for registering new cable modems  
1195 
 
1196 
Network Layer 
1197 
Cable data networks use IP for communication from the cable modem to the 
1198 
network. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) compliant DHCP typically 
1199 
forms the basis for IP address assignment and administration in the cable network.  
1200 
 
1201 
Transport Layer 
1202 
Cable data networks support both the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the 
1203 
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) at the transport layer.  
1204 
 
1205 
Application Layer 
1206 
All of the Internet-related applications are supported here. These applications 
1207 
include HTTP, FTP, e-mail, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP), news, chat, and 
1208 
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The use of SNMP provides for 
1209 
management of the CMTS and cable data networks.  
1210 
Practice 
1211 
1. Which of the following applications is supported by the cable network? 
1212 
 
1213 
A. HTTP

Summary 
1218 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
1219 
 
1220 
I 
Cable modems put data signals on the same cable as television signals. 
1221 
Cable-modem access provides speed superior to leased lines, and cable 
1222 
modems provide a full-time connection. 
1223 
I 
The advantage of using cable-modem access is that coaxial cable is already 
1224 
in place in most of the country. However, the disadvantage is that the cable 
1225 
modem shares the media with cable TV. Thus, the more users that come on 
1226 
the network the less bandwidth is available for users.
