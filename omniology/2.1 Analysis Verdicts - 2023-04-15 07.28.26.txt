File Analysis Verdicts

Purpose of File Analysis Verdicts
COMMUNICATE POTENTIAL DANGER
can the file cause harm or damage?
COMMUNICATE RELEVANCE
should I even look into this?
SUMMARIZE ANALYSIS RESULT
the tl;dr of the report in one word
CLASSIFY SAMPLES
collect statistical data
use for AI training
use for security product tests

CLEAN
RISKWARE
GRAYWARE
3

Malware
Programs that are designed to cause damage or harm or 
unintenionally do so.
financial
physical
mental
systemic
DEFINITION
KINDS OF DAMAGE/HARM
4

Malware
Whether something is malware can depend on context!
Example: Program that downloads a file and executes it.
If the downloaded file is clean, e.g., an update or a patch, then 
the program is also clean.
But the downloaded file is an external component that can 
change. If the program downloads malware at some point, it 
suddenly becomes malware too.
CONTEXT MATTERS
5

Malware
The malware verdict communicates that the sample is 
dangerous and undoubtedly has to be detected by antivirus 
software.
WHY THIS VERDICT
6

PUP - Potentially Unwanted Program
Non-malicious, legal programs that are usually not wanted by 
the user.
They often use psychological tactics to manipulate users into 
accepting or paying for the installation.
DEFINITION
7

PUP - Potentially Unwanted Program
suddenly new advertisments, pop-ups
changed browser settings: default page, search settings, 
toolbars, changes can be hard to remove
newly installed programs, unknown to user
user was tricked into payment of a useless program
often via exaggerated warnings, problems with a promise to 
repair
TYPICAL SYMPTOMS
USELESS PROGRAMS
8

PUP - Potentially Unwanted Program
illegal programs are never PUP but grayware or malware
malware may show same symptoms, but usually arrives 
without consent whereas PUP tricks into consent
REMARKS
9

PUP - Potentially Unwanted Program
Some people love their PUP software and want to keep using 
it.
For other people it is akin to an infection.
PUP is the best verdict to describe that a program is legal but 
still annoying.
WHY THIS VERDICT
10

Riskware
Programs that pose a serious security risk or indicate a 
compromised system or network.
DEFINITION
11

Riskware
password recovery or credential dumping tools
vulnerable drivers
so called "hacking tools" used by attackers to invade 
systems or move in the network
EXAMPLES
12

Riskware
Presence of riskware on company systems may indicate a 
serious compromise. The underlying issue can be more severe 
than the presence of "just" one malware.
Sometimes administrators use riskware to test and secure 
their systems, so whether the presence of these programs is a 
problem depends on who used these tools and why
WHY THIS VERDICT
13

Corrupted or Junk
Programs that are damaged to a point that they do not 
execute.Â 
Documents that are damaged so that they cannot be opened 
anymore.
Files that serve no purpose. For example empty files, zero 
filled files or files filled with data that cannot be determined 
and seems random.
DEFINITION CORRUPTED
DEFINITION JUNK
14

Corrupted or Junk
Junk and corrupted cannot always be clearly distinguished 
nor does it make sense to do so.
Junk files may actually serve a purpose in context but for the 
analyst this context is not known and cannot be determined.
Caution: If a program executes and then exits with an error 
message, it is not corrupted. It still runs.
REMARKS
15

Corrupted or Junk
With corrupted files there is often missing information to 
create a verdict of their original state because the files cannot 
be viewed or executed.
At the same time the verdict of their original state is not that 
important because they cannot be run anyways.
The verdict communicates that the sample is irrelevant.
WHY THIS VERDICT
16

Grayware
Samples that are not malicious but illegal or for other reasons 
not okay to be used.
DEFINITION
17

Grayware
Clean carries the association that a file is perfectly fine to be 
used and not associated with anything shady, illegal or 
phishy.
So in communication with others it should be made clear 
when this is not the case even though a file is "technically" 
clean.
Furthermore, it is optional for certain samples that they are 
quarantined by antivirus software. Such samples may also get 
the verdict grayware.
WHY THIS VERDICT
18

Grayware
software cracks, keygens
child abuse material
ransom notes
EXAMPLES
19

Clean
The clean verdict is given by exclusion of all other verdicts.
Clean samples are:
legal
free of serious security risks
do not use shady tactics for installation
somewhat useful / no junk
DEFINITION
20

Clean
In colloquial terms his verdict is given whenever it is okay to 
use this program or file.
There are no doubts and no considerable security risks 
involved.
A clean verdict communicates that nothing else needs to be 
done.
