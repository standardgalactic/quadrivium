Preface
Just how harsh is the space environment into which you thrust your DIY sat-
ellite? We look at what conditions your satellite must endure, how to test your 
satellite, and what launch, ground and orbit support you will need. In addition, 
we provide tips on making your overall plan and schedule, including the most 
important tests that will help your satellite survive and thrive in space.
Chapter 1 gives you a quick primer on what space and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
actually is, while Chapter 2 goes deeper with actual numbers that describe 
the conditions your satellite will be facing in space. Having set the scope of 
what space conditions are, Chapter 3 goes into more into detail about the 
radiation environment you’ll be facing in the ionosphere and how to mitigate 
its risks. Chapter 4 provides you with a discussion of what testing is all about 
as well as offering some sample NASA CubeSat requirements and a smidgen 
of formal systems engineering.
In Chapter 5, we get into building a thermal vacuum chamber for mimicking 
the space environment. Chapter 6 walks you through building and running a 
vibration shake test to mimic the difficulties of your anticipated rocket 
launch. Chapter 7 guides you through high G-force testing of your payload 
using a homebuilt centrifuge.
Chapter 8 closes the book with a discussion on the usefulness of flight spares, 
guidelines on scheduling your tests, and help in choosing appropriate clean 
room or lab in which to test. In summary, the book tells you where your sat-
ellite is heading, what to test, and how and where to test it. We hope this book 
also serves you as a basic text on the Low Earth Orbit environment in general, 
so that you can design, build and test a spaceworthy picocraft.
By the end of this book, you will be ready to prove your picosatellite has the 
right stuff to deploy via a fiery rocket launch into the harsh vacuum of space. 
We also recommend the other books in this series: our primer on designing 
and building your craft in DIY Satellite Platforms, crafting your mission’s sci-
ence and technical goals in DIY Instruments for Amateur Space, and com-
manding, operating and downloading data from your satellite in DIY Data 
Communications for Amateur Spacecraft.
But first, let’s really test the limits of the picosatellite you’ve built.

viii Preface

1/Life as a Satellite
…we’ve got to go out to Asteroid HS-5388 and turn it into Space Station 
E-M3. She has no atmosphere at all, and only about two per cent Earth-
surface gravity. We’ve got to play human fly on her for at least six 
months, no girls to date, no television, no recreation that you don’t de-
vise yourselves, and hard work every day. You’ll get space sick, and so 
homesick you can taste it, and agoraphobia. If you aren’t careful you’ll 
get ray-burnt. Your stomach will act up, and you’ll wish to God you’d 
never enrolled. But if you behave yourself, and listen to the advice of the 
old spacemen, you’ll come out of it strong and healthy, with a little credit 
stored up in the bank, and a lot of knowledge and experience that you 
wouldn’t get in forty years on Earth.
— ROBERT HEINLEIN
 "Misfit"
What’s it like up there? Every 90 minutes, your satellite orbits the Earth. Each 
orbit passes high over a different geographic coordinate. The atmosphere 
you encounter is negligible, a residue of trace oxygen and other atoms with 
no real pressure to sustain you, just enough pressure to cause drag and (in 
months or years) reduce your orbit and cause reentry.
The Sun bathes you in heat and ultraviolet (UV) and X-rays and all the oth-
er wavelengths of light. When in sunlight, your satellite heats up, perhaps 
uncontrollably. For half of each orbit, the Earth blocks the Sun and your 
satellite radiates out into that cold 3-degrees above absolute zero ambient 
temperature of space.
High energy particles (protons and electrons) stream from the Sun and 
interact with the Earth’s magnetic field, creating beautiful aurora and po-
tentially frying your electronics (see Figure 1-1). Very rarely, you might en-
counter space dust or tiny bits of orbital debris.

All this assumes you survived the rocket launch.
Space is a harsh and unforgiving environment. It is harsh because it has no 
pressure or outside forces to provide structure, just vacuum. There is no air 
or liquid to conduct heat or buffer temperatures. It is filled with electromag-
netic and particle radiation. Worse, if something breaks, you can’t pop over 
to fix it. You get one shot and have to make that one shot work. Fortunately, 
through testing, you can practice your shots before the real event.
Space Is…
Space:
• is airless
• yet has atmospheric drag
• is hot and cold
• is insulating
• has electric and magnetic fields (as well as field hot spots like the South 
Atlantic Anomaly, where the Van Allen belts dip close to Earth)
• is influenced by solar weather
• lets the spacecraft jitter in attitude, bounce, and overall momentum
• requires orbital maneuvering rather than line-of-sight travel
Space is the highest of the three final frontiers (see “Frontiers” (page 3)). It 
is an airless, inhospitable place where your three biggest problems are a lack 
2 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

of air, extremes of hot and cold, and a surplus of electromagnetic energy. It 
also takes an enormous amount of fuel to get up there. To succeed in space, 
you must be lightweight, pack small, and be tough. This book tells you how 
to test whether your satellite will survive low earth orbit (LEO).
The air pressure in LEO is effectively nil. There’s just enough air to provide 
atmospheric drag to de-orbit your satellite, but not nearly enough air to pro-
vide any structural or navigational assistance.
In space, there is no thermal blanket of air or water to help you retain or 
dissipate heat. Therefore, when the sun shines, you heat up—rapidly. When 
you are in darkness, you cool through radiative heat, and can keep cooling 
(in theory) until you reach 3K, or about -270 C or -454 F (for this work we’ll 
be using Celsius).
To this environment, we add a fourth challenge—the rumbles required to get 
there. A rocket launch will apply intense g-forces, where acceleration of the 
rocket presses your payload as if it were feeling strong gravity. The rocket 
will vibrate and shake at different rates as it goes through different stages. 
Finally you get a thump as your satellite is ejected from the final stage. Here 
is where your satellite may drop a few inches very quickly. In any part of this, 
there may be mechanical mishaps as well.
Frontiers
The frontiers of space, the deep oceans, and the mind compete for the title 
of final frontier, but space got the official nod from Star Trek. "Space, the final 
frontier" is an extremely famous line from the opening of the original "Star 
Trek". The brain is often called "the final frontier of science", and ocean doc-
umentaries often dub the deep sea "our final frontier" or, in a bit of one-
upmanship from the magazine COSMOS, "the real final frontier". In a hu-
morous twist, death gets called "the undiscovered country" by Shakes-
peare, then re-appropriated by Star Trek as peace being the undiscovered 
country. In this context, we could call DIY Space the first, best hope for ex-
ploring one of the final frontiers. Hopefully peacefully, or at least with as little 
death as possible.
Launch Trouble
Looking at what can go wrong with a rocket launch, we’re hard put to find 
something that can’t go awry. Here’s a short list of just some of the things 
that can go wrong during launch and early orbit checkout. You might have a 
launch vehicle problem and get into an improper orbit. Or, the forces of 
launch can damage your satellite from acoustics, g-forces, vibration, 
changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature changes, or outgassing. You 
may reach orbit but not have the right facing or spacecraft attitude (not an 
Life as a Satellite 3

emotion, just means facing and orientation), making it difficult to communi-
cate or misaligning your solar panels to the sun so you can’t get power. Your 
satellite may underperform or overperform. You may miss detecting time-
critical anomalies (satellite bits that go wrong) or situations (events that go 
wrong). Your team can make a hasty or incorrect decision. Your operating 
procedures may be incorrect. Your hardware or software may have bugs. 
(Thanks to Squibb, Boden and Larson, Cost-Effective Space Mission Opera-
tions, 2nd edition, pg 304, for this list.)
If all this sounds pessimistic, remember this is the book on testing. Your plan 
is to perform reasonable tests to mimic the conditions the satellite will face 
when you deploy for real. Good testing reduces risk, though you can never 
eliminate it. In fact, you need to be sure you don’t get overzealous with your 
testing and actually break something for no other reason than testing it.
For example, if you want to test whether your car door is closing properly, 
you may want to slam it closed two or three times. But slamming it fifty times 
won’t give you more information—and may break something that was work-
ing perfectly.
So our mantra is to devise a thorough test plan, carry it out in a reasonable 
fashion, analyze your test data, then stop. Each of those four steps is 
important.
How High Is Space?
How high is space, how far can you fall with a parachute, where do Low Earth 
Orbit (LEO) satellites reside, and where does the hard radiation from the sun 
get nasty? Gathered for the first time in one place is our High Altitude 
Explorer’s Guide (Figure 1-2).
A typical airplane cruises at 9 km (6 miles) up, around 30,000 feet. Military 
jets (from the SR-71 onward to modern planes) can hit over 30 km (19 miles) 
up, over 100,000 feet. You can parachute from that height. In 1960, Joseph 
Kittinger set the record at 31.3 km (19.5 miles), or 102,800 feet. Felix Baum-
gartner is planning to use a rocket to freefall from 36 km (over 22 miles)—
an 118,000 feet fall—some time before 2015.
But those aren’t space (Chapter 2). In the US, “space” begins at 80.4 km (50 
miles), or 264,000 feet. General international consensus sets a similar lim-
it for the start of space as 100 km (62 miles), or 380,000 feet.
“Low Earth Orbit” (LEO), where many satellites live, goes from 160 km (100 
miles, 525,000 feet) to 2,000 km (1,240 miles, 6.5 million feet). My own 
Project Calliope picosatellite will be 230 km up (143 miles, 755,000 feet). The 
International Space Station (ISS) cruises higher up, from 278 km (173 
miles, 912,000 feet) to 460 km (286 miles, 1.5 million feet).
4 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Figure 1-2. Layers of the Earth’s atmosphere (courtesy NASA/MSFC)
Starting above the space limit but a bit before LEO, the inner Van Allen Belts, 
which magnetically shield the Earth’s surface from high energy particles, 
extend from 100 km (62 miles, 33,000 feet) up to 10,000 km (6,200 miles, 
3.3 million feet).
Finally, geostationary orbits are at 35,786 km (22,236 miles, 117.5 million 
feet). These geosynchronous orbits, lined up above the Earth’s equator, have 
an orbital period equal to one day, so they hover over the same spot of the 
Earth.
Together, that’s “space”, with an emphasis in this book on LEO. We’ll walk 
through several bits of homemade gear to tackle these tests. For a vacuum 
test, you can make a simple chamber using a pressure cooker and an auto-
motive brake vacuum pump. For thermal vacuum, you need to add an IR heat 
Life as a Satellite 5

source. For vibration and shake testing, you can modify power tools to do 
simple test scenarios. G-forces can be tested primitively using the centrifu-
gal force provided by you swinging a rope, or with more technical elan us-
ing a power drill and a long pair of swing arms. As for the drop test, that’s 
both the simplest and most nerve-wracking, as you simply have to be will-
ing to drop your work. But first, a deeper look at space. Let’s look at the hard 
numbers for where we’ll be sending our picosatellite.

2/The Measure of 
Space
By the numbers, we’re 1.496 x 108 km from the Sun, aka 1 Astronomical 
Unit (AU). It takes about 8 minutes for light or any kind of radiation from the 
Sun to reach the Earth. Some events—like plasma thrown off from the Sun
—can take 1-4 days to reach us. The sun throws out light (radio through 
gamma) as well as energetic electrons and protons, and big wind-like 
streams of hot hydrogen gas (solar plasma), as shown in Figure 2-1.

tesy JAXA)

While Earth’s atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, up at Low Earth Orbit (LEO) 
has almost no atmosphere at all. We get the worst of both really—no air to 
use for breathing, but just enough molecules of air to cumulatively cause 
drag and eventually make our LEO satellites de-orbit.
Our atmosphere blocks most of the harder radiation the Sun puts out—
X-rays and UV (especially, for UV, the Ozone Layer). By definition what we 
see on Earth is visible light, plus a little light UV and a fair amount of invisi-
ble radio emission. All that blocked stuff is visible from orbit, however.
In fact, that’s why we launch satellite telescopes—less atmosphere to block 
any kind of light.
Note some plastics (polymers) are sensitive to UV—they break down in the 
presence of UV. Fine on Earth, but terrible for space-going hardware. ESA 
maintains a large list of materials and their responses to the space environ-
ment in their ESA materials database at http://esmat.esa.int/. In general, if 
it’s a material that has a strong smell or that oxidizes (rusts) easily, it’s a poor 
choice for space.
At sea level, our atmosphere has a pressure of 1 x 105 Pascals (Pa), with a 
density of 1.225 kg/m3 (and 1024 molecules/m3, if you like counting mole-
cules), assuming a moderate reference temperature temperature of 288 K 
(15 C). The US Standard Atmosphere model (Figure 2-2) illustrates the tem-
perature, density and pressure variation as you increase in altitude.
By 86 km up (which is where the US Standard Atmosphere model stops 
calculating), you are facing (at 187 K/14 C) pressure of 0.3 Pa (3x10-5 at-
mospheres) and only 0.000006 kg/m3 of air mass. At that height, you’re still 
not officially in space and would not count as an astronaut if you flew there. 
Space is typically defined as 100 km up and higher. Putting these together 
in comparison, 99.9% of the Earth’s atmosphere is in the layers below 50 
km, while only 0.1% of the atmosphere in the 50 km to 400 km range.
For LEO, in the range of 300-900 km, the atmosphere is thin (low density) 
but not zero. LEO is in the part of the atmosphere called the Thermosphere, 
and the Thermosphere contains the region called the Ionosphere. The Iono-
sphere is where auroras occur. By 400 km up, you have about 1014 mole-
cules per cubic meter (10-10 kg/m3), with an equivalent pressure of, for all 
practical purposes, nil (10-5 Pa and lower).
Pressure is hard to define in the ionosphere, since pressure is a measure of 
air molecules impacting a given object, and there just aren’t many mole-
cules at that height. Put another way, any individual molecule will typically 
travel 1 km or so before colliding with another molecule. The ionosphere’s 
density also varies with solar activity and whether you are in sunlight or dark. 
As you will often read in this book, LEO is a vacuum in terms of harsh unsur-
vivability, with just enough gas molecules to cause oxidation and drag in the

long term. It’s the worst of both worlds: no air to use, just enough to eventu-
ally force reentry. Most of that is oxygen, which means you have oxidation 
(corrosion) to worry about. Atomic oxygen is the major component of the 
residual LEO atmosphere (Figure 2-3).
By the time you reach geosynchronous height, 36,000 km up, the density 
is 10-20 kg/m3 and the pressure is 10-15 Pa, and it pretty much stays at that 
low density as you travel within the solar system.
You heat up due to absorbing solar radiation (1371+- 5 W/m2 or so, ref) as 
well as sunlight reflected off the Earth (Earth’s albedo) plus Earth black-body 
emission, totaling perhaps 200 W/m2. While the solar wind is at 2 x 105 K, it 
is so thin it provides no real heating.
The ionosphere by definition is where ionization of plasma occurs, and is the 
region above 86 km. The incoming solar radiation (called incident solar UV, 
a fancy term for the sun’s ultraviolet light) disassociates the atmosphere into 
its individual elements, then disassociates the electrons from the nuclei. Its 
peak density is in the 300-400 km range, though the density of the plasma 
is still less than the density of the neutral molecules; both co-exist.

Outgassing
Back to the lack of air. Every get something wrapped in plastic and it smells 
all plastic-y? You’re sniffing some plastic molecules that outgassed from the 
wrapping material. Outgassing (also called sublimation) is the vaporization 
of a solid going to a gas state due to low pressure. At the typical 10-11 to 10-15 
Pa of LEO, many materials stable in an Earth lab will outgas. Heating increa-
ses outgassing.
Outgassing has two problems; it erodes the material that is outgassing, true
—but more crucial, the outgassed material may condense on—and thus coat
—other surfaces. This can change their conductance or, for optics and de-
tectors, coat them so they no longer can see.
For this reason, do not put lubricants into space. Ground-based lubricants 
have a high vapor pressure and outgas quickly. They therefore are terrible as 
lubricants, since they evaporate off your moving parts, and terrible as a con-
taminant, since they’ll coat random surfaces.

Environment and Thermal References
The bulk of these orbital environment reference numbers come from Space-
craft Systems Engineering, 4th ed, Wiley, 2011, by Peter Fortescue, Gra-
ham Swinerd, and John Stark. Thermal modeling in the next section is based 
on Table 11-43 “Typical Operating Temperature Ranges for Selected Space-
craft Components,” from Space Mission Analysis and Design, 1999, edited by 
Wertz and Larson. They devote an entire chapter to the subject, and it’s a 
non-trivial exercise to come up with any sort of answer. For a sample exact 
thermal calculation, the NASA Glenn Center website provides the full calcu-
lation for “Estimating the Temperature of a Flat Plate in Low Earth Orbit” 
(http://http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/Numbers/Math/
Mathematical_Thinking/estimating_the_temperature.htm).
Orbital Thermal Profiles
In space the temperature can range from -269 C (4K absolute background) 
to over 400 C. Low Earth Orbit has some cooling/heating cycles as you are 
in and out of sunlight, and you can expect a floating object to experience a 
range from -160 C to 200 C (as a rough estimate). By clever thermal design
—described below, and using tricks like rotating your craft to distribute heat 
more evenly and using insulation, you can cut this to a range of -100 C to 100 
C. This is still outside the range most off-the-shelf electronics can handle.
If you minimize your radiative properties (choosing white or reflecting cas-
ings) to reduce both heating due to the sun and re-radiating that heat in the 
dark, and you assume there is some on-board heating of your components 
due to being in use, you can achieve a temperature range of -30 to 90 de-
grees as typical. Why are these typical? Those are often the limits that off-
the-shelf electronics function at, so we’re going to assume you design your 
craft to keep to that temperature range.
For a more thorough answer on temperature profiles, I quote “IRStuff” from 
eng-tips.com (http://www.eng-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=102652):
An unpowered, unilluminated object, in deep space, will equilibrate to 
approximately 4 Kelvins. You can passively verify that temperature the 
same way that the COBE satellite measures the space background, e.g., 
through the blackbody emissions of the object in the microwave re-
gime. In any region close to the Earth, the temperature can vary from 
about -160C to over 200C.
Complete thermal calculations are very complex (see sidebar “Environ-
ment and Thermal References” (page 11)) and, for a picosatellite, perhaps 
overkill. One advantage of small size is that you can assume the satellite is 
approximately a black box that equally absorbs and radiates uniformly.
The Measure of Space 11

Magnetic Fields
The Earth has a magnetic field; it’s what makes compass needles point to-
wards the poles. This field is also what protects us from the worst of the 
charged particles that stream from the Sun. The earth’s magnetic field at the 
surface is due to the Earth’s core, but in the ionosphere we have both the 
core field and reaction of the Earth’s magnetosphere to the solar wind.
The magnetic field as a flux density is about 1T at the surface and drops only 
about a factor of two by 400 km. You have to get more than 2000 km up 
before you lose even half the magnetic field flux. For the full picture, there 
are very complex models (NASA models AE8 and AP8) that can predict the 
electron and proton (charged particle) fluxes for any LEO orbit during differ-
ent parts of the 11-year solar cycle. Most of these charged particles are kept 
from LEO by the magnetosphere, but again, in LEO you will experience some 
of the particle fluxes.
Aurora occur at the poles, where the magnetic field lines dip (Figure 2-4). 
There is also the South Atlantic Anomaly, a region where the Earth’s mag-
netic field lines dip lower and thus increase the electron/proton flux experi-
enced in orbit. Charged particles can cause temporary and permanent 
damage.
Charged particles cause single event upsets (SEUs) that make random sig-
nals appear in your electronics. Charged particles also degrade solar ar-
rays and electronic parts, and can dump charge into electronics to cause 
surges (dielectric charging). LEO is more dominated by protons, with elec-
trons more common in higher orbits, but again this fluctuates and depends 
on solar activity. Protons do more damage, particle for particle, than elec-
trons, as they are heavier and thus carry more momentum.
Orbital Mechanics
How objects move in orbit is key to understanding your satellite’s environ-
ment and behavior. Put simply, for a given orbit, everything moves at the 
same speed regardless of mass. If you have the ISS, VelcroSat, and a cloud 
of debris in the exact same orbit, they’d all move at the same speed but never 
intercept each other.
Also, if you speed up in an orbit, you also change your orbital path to a high-
er one (because your centripetal force outwards is greater so you’re over-
coming more of gravity’s downward pull). If you slow down in an orbit, you 
are giving in to gravity and your orbit decays.
To make it weirder, the speed you need to have in an orbit is lower the high-
er up you are—because again, you are fighting less gravity higher up, so you 
need a lower speed.
12 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Figure 2-4. An aurora viewed from orbit, and just the sort of thing you don’t 
want an untested satellite to fly through (image courtesy NASA)
How can this be—first I say “if you slow down, you go down” then I say “if you 
are higher up, your orbital velocity is slower”. These seem contradictory, but 
they actually are two different problems.
Each orbit is like a rigid track—if you have a specific orbital radius, you have 
a fixed velocity for that orbit. And the higher the track, the slower the veloc-
ity you need to stay there. The track is a perfect balance of centripetal force 
and gravity.
However, to transfer to a different orbit, you have to jump up (or drop down)--
briefly. You have to either give yourself a kick to jump higher, or let gravity 
briefly take over. That extra kick up (extra energy) gets used up in moving 
you higher. Similarly, that loss of velocity (and thus loss of kinetic energy) 
lets gravity take over and drop you down.
So you spend energy to move up to a higher orbit but, once you get there, 
the total kinetic energy you need to stay there is lower than before.
Meanwhile, the Earth is rotating below, so the ground track or ground trace 
of the path of your orbit shifts relative to land (Figure 2-5). Over one day, an 
LEO satellite may pass over the Earth 15 times (Figure 2-6), each time with 
position shifting a bit. This also means that a fixed ground communications 
antenna will only be able to see a subset of the entire day’s orbits.
The Measure of Space 13

Figure 2-5. Three successive orbits plotted for an LEO satellite. Each 
curved line is one orbit. Note how each orbit is over a slightly different set of 
geographic positions. Image courtesy NASA.
Figure 2-6. A full day’s worth of orbit tracks for the now-gone UARS satel-
lite, showing just how much ground an LEO satellite can cover in one day.
In an elliptical (not circular) orbit, you move faster when you’re closer to the 
Earth, and slower when you’re further out. It’s a stable orbit, but the speed 
varies. Also, how it’s aligned to the Earth varies.
Orbital Debris
And now space debris. There’s junk in space, and it can present a hazard for 
spacecraft (Figure 2-7). Are impacts an issue? Micrometeors and debris are 
infrequent and, for picosatellite work, negligible. If you’re tiny and don’t last 
long in orbit, they are the least of your problems. While a picosatellites might 
encounter space debris, our small size, hardiness, and short lifetime make 
it a possibility not worth accounting for.
14 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Figure 2-7. Plot of debris size versus where it is found, just so you can 
worry.
If you are expecting trouble, you can look up multilayered insulation (MLI) 
shields, such as used on the ISS. A common meteor shield design is the 
Whipple bumper, which has a thin shield layer that shatters the incoming 
particle, an empty gap, then a thicker inner shield layer that acts as a back-
up wall. The first layer spreads out the incident particle so the second layer 
can stop it.
Capturing orbital debris is a problem DARPA and others are trying to solve, 
including using a “catcher’s mitt” to clean things up. What this means in 
terms of maneuvering is we cannot just fire a rocket to fly faster and hope to 
catch debris that’s ahead—because that would also change our orbit. It al-
so means, in general, we can’t say we’ll fly faster than the stuff in our orbit 
and sweep stuff up. Instead, any change in speed also changes our orbit’s 
altitude and/or shape (eccentricity).
The Measure of Space 15

Figure 2-8. Simulated image showing debris in LEO up to 2000 km up 
(courtesy JSC/NASA).
Since we can’t just be like a pool net, sweeping out an orbit, how do we 
intercept debris? What makes this solvable is primarily that orbits aren’t 
circular—especially for debris. The eccentric (squished circle) orbits there-
fore intersect in different ways, creating the debris problem.
However, picosatellites are an excellent testbed for trying out orbital debris 
concepts. This is why I’m happy to be advising the Capitol College’s Vel-
croSat orbital debris removal prototyping picosatellite effort. Ergo, a debris-
catcher can, via timing, work to intercept debris that is in a different orbit 
that has a brief overlap with the VelcroSat orbit. This is also why debris 
collisions occur—items in orbits of different eccentricity and orientation col-
lide (Figure 2-8).
Now that we know what we are going to be facing, let’s look at how we’re 
going to schedule out our tests. After that, we’ll get into building the test gear.
16 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

3/Space Radiation 
Environment
Picosatellites, like any Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEO), are going up to, well, 
LEO. Space weather—radiation and energetic particles emitted from an ac-
tive Sun—can damage satellites. This region of space is partially protected 
from the worst effects of space weather by the Earth’s ionosphere, but it is 
an active and threatening place.
If space wasn’t active, there wouldn’t be any point in sending up my own 
Project Calliope to measure it. However, we’d prefer to keep the physical 
damage to the electronics to a minimum. The primary source of damage due 
to solar activity is due to highly energetic electrons, protons, and ions emit-
ted by the Sun (see Figure 3-1).
Figure 3-1. Aurora caused by solar activity charging the Earth’s iono-
sphere, as viewed from space. Image courtesy of NASA.
The particle and radiation environment is not static. Besides time variation 
due to solar activity, the shape of the Earth’s magnetic field also can lead to 
dips in the field that cause a higher hazard in certain geographic areas. The 
17

most known dips are where the field lines converge at the Earth’s north and 
south poles. These are responsible for the aurora. There is also a dip near 
Brazil, called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) (Figure 3-2) that LEO satel-
lites can pass through during one or more orbits each day. Satellites with 
sensitive detectors often decide to either shut down or cease collecting data 
during the SAA passage, as the increased background can make the data too 
noisy to use (as well as risking damage to the satellite electronics).

area for LEO satellites. Graphic courtesy of NASA.
Space Weather Events
Space weather can kill astronauts. This is one of the motivations for fund-
ing space weather efforts. Solar events—flares, particle storms, and coro-
nal mass ejections—can knock out GPS and cell phone reception, screw up 
radio and radar, and endanger airline pilots flying the polar routes. All of these 
damaging effects are well worth mitigating. But what about circumstances 
higher up?
In an article titled “Fake Astronaut Gets Hit by Artificial Solar Flare”, NASA 
reports on their upcoming experiment to see just how much damage a so-
lar flare would cause to an unprotected astronaut.
On Earth, we have the luxury of being able to do something, if given ad-
vance notice. Travelers can be advised about GPS and cell phone outages. 
18 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

The military can plan around disruption. And airplanes can and do reroute 
when there’s a chance of solar trouble. But what befalls an astronaut, up past 
the shielding we get from Earth’s magnetic field, when they get notice of an 
event hours or minutes away? Where can they go?
I was told a possibly apocryphal take from the Apollo, on the instructions to 
astronauts if there should be a solar event while they were on the Moon. 
“Maximize shielding. Climb into the lowest point of the lunar lander. Have 
one astronaut lay on top of the other. The one on the bottom might live.”
In 1972, there was a massive solar flare, between the Apollo 16 and 17 mis-
sions. NASA decided to see what would have happened if, oh, there had been 
astronauts up in an Apollo 16.5 at the time. Now, when I did work predict-
ing how long CCD (charge-coupled device) detectors could last in space, I 
used Monte Carlo computer simulations, and there’s only so far a simula-
tion can take you when dealing with a complex system. And few things are 
more complex than the human body.
NASA’s method for testing human survivability in high radiation environ-
ments is brutally clever. They created a dummy, filled it with human blood 
cells, then stuck it in front of the Brookhaven particle accelerator and simu-
lated a solar proton storm. They took it out and measured the cell damage, 
refilled it, and repeated this test.
These particles can penetrate past the satellite’s skin and the surface of the 
electronics and dump their energetic charge into the electronics itself. This 
can cause glitches—Single Event Upsets, where the electronics briefly get a 
wrong signal value. It can also degrade or erode the solar panels and other 
sensitive bits—though this is less of a factor for our short-lifetime (6 weeks, 
nominally) mission.
If a picosatellite was a person, the radiation could damage DNA and similar. 
For now, though, we can just shield our satellite from particles and be safe, 
correct?
Shielding
In a French word, non. Shielding can help protect electronics, but due to the 
actual mechanism that causes damage, shielding can also increase the risk 
of damage. Unlike armoring a medieval knight, where you want to add as 
much armor as they can carry, for satellites you need to understand how the 
potentially damaging particles interact with the spacecraft.
First, it is only specific particles, of a specific energy, that will react with the 
electronics. Particles of low energy will be shielding by the body of the space-
craft or even the paint and thin silicon layer coating the electronics. Like these 
incredibly detailed schematic show:
Space Radiation Environment 19

Figure 3-3. Electron distribution versus altitude. If you really want to ex-
plore shielding, I figured this graph wouldn’t scare you off. Figure courtesy of 
NASA.
Particles (electron or proton or ion):
20 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

the electronic component:
their interaction (particle stopped):
Particles of very high energy will barely be slowed by the small amount of 
material and will typically pass straight through the satellite and electron-
ics, reacting negligibly:
The damaging particles are, in a Goldilocks fashion, the particles at a just 
right energy. They have enough energy to pass through the blocking mate-
rials to get into the electronics, but not so much energy as to zip out. Instead, 
they deposit all their impact into the electronics, causing the SEU or damage:
To protect from these, first, you have to know what the range (or spectrum) 
of particles are in space. Here (Figure 3-4) are two sample spectra, of very 
different shapes. The energy of the particles range from some low E0 up to 
higher values, ending at E3. One spectrum has more low energy particles 
than high energy, the other is the opposite (more high energy particles than 
low energy ones).
Space Radiation Environment 21

Figure 3-4. Two sample incident damaging particle spectra. One spectra is 
mostly high-energy particles, the other mostly low-energy particles. We as-
sume low energy particles get absorbed by your electronics, causing dam-
age, but higher energy particles zip through with little effect. For Spectrum 
1, adding shielding will end up attenuating the bulk of the particles and re-
sult in an increase in damage.
Let’s add a detail—say all particles of energy E0 or lower are blocked by the 
satellite as it is, and do no damage. And all particles of energy E2 or higher 
go straight through and cause little or no damage. The only particles that will 
damage our satellite are those of energy E1.
If the particles appear as per Spectrum 1, then we get around 20 of the 
damaging E1 particles. If Spectrum 2 is the case, we get around 30 of the 
damaging E1 particles. The damage the satellite receives obviously de-
pends on which spectrum the Sun is emitting.
Now let’s add shielding. Shielding attenuates, or slows down, all particles. If 
particles are of low energy, they get slowed down so much they are com-
pletely blocked. If particles have high energy, they lose some energy pass-
ing through the shielding, but still continue on—at a lower energy.
So now we add a block of shielding. Let’s say it’s enough to slow down each 
particle by 1 of our labeled energy levels. An E3 particle gets slowed down to 
become an E2 particle. E2s turn into E1s. E1s turn into E0s. E0s get blocked 
completely by the shielding.
What then happens to our satellite if we shield it? Suddenly, with shielding, 
everything at E1 or lower is blocked but the E2 particles get downshifted to 
E1 and cause damage (and the E3 get slowed to E2 and therefore still pass 
through without causing any trouble).
Under this, Spectrum 1 has 30 formerly E2 particles that get slowed by the 
shielding, become E1, and thus damage the electronics. With Spectrum 2, 
there are only 20 formerly E2 particles that turn into damaging E1 particles.
22 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

As a little table, then, we find that, without shielding, the satellite takes more 
damage if the Sun emits Spectrum 2, but with shielding, Spectrum 1 will do 
more damage. The choice of whether to add shielding or not therefore de-
pends not just on the amount of shielding, but on understanding what the 
specific energies and amounts of particles the Sun is likely to emit. Adding 
more shielding can, in some cases, actually increase the damage and risk to 
your electronics.
For a larger space mission, you can obtain the predicted space environ-
ment and also create a 3D model of the attenuation curves for the materi-
als and thicknesses of your satellite in order to create an estimate on parti-
cle damage. To be very accurate, you should run multiple Monte Carlo sim-
ulations of particles hitting the satellite, since real particles have a probabil-
ity of interaction rather than the simple hit/miss model I give here. That is a 
subject for a future… no, wait, that was my Master’s thesis way too long 
ago (later published as Antunes et al, 1992, in Experimental Astronomy, vol. 
4, no. 2.)
History of Damage
Most picosatellites are not just limited in weight, but also don’t need to real-
ly worry about short-term transient damage like SEUs. Instead, we’ll just take 
our lumps and hope that the bulk of the data we download—itself just a 
fraction of the entire data captured—will suffice.
A case study of cumulative damage to imaging CCD detectors (back in 1992, 
by Antunes et al) discusses how the noise of the detectors increase as they 
suffer radiation damage. Electrons affect CCDs by increasing background 
rates and by producing ionization damage. Low energy electrons produce 
signal change indistinguishable from x-ray events. Ionization within the oxide 
insulating layers can produce flatband voltage shifts and increased contri-
butions from surface state dark currents. Within one to two years, they 
lose 10-5 in charge transfer efficiency, which means (multiplied by the num-
ber of pixels you read per row, e.g., a 512 x 512 CCD would suffer 512x105 in 
additional noise). This substantiates our claim that, in general, a short-lived 
picosatellite does not have to significantly worry about the radiation envi-
ronment for their typically shorter lifetimes.
Electronics Noise
In addition to the radiation environment provided by space, your satellite 
electronics are going to bring along their own noise and interference. One 
part of assembly is making sure all my circuits are properly shielded and not 
sending out interfering signals. A decent magnetometer—a meter to meas-
ure magnetic fields—costs $200-$700 dollars. While at the vitamin shop, I 
Space Radiation Environment 23

beheld a CellSensor, a device that measures and traces cell phone and pow-
er line RF (radio frequency) emission. It has a range of milliWatts (for RF 
radiation) and milliGauss (for magnetic fields). And it was discounted to $20 
(Figure 3-5).
Figure 3-5. A (commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electromagnetic (EM) de-
tector, sold at a health food shop to paranoid grounddwellers but repur-
posed for space work.
So, for $20, I now have a new addition to my test rig and construction set-
up! One part of ‘do it yourself’—in any domain—is reappropriating hard-
ware for your own purposes. One person’s fear of cell phones led to me saving 
several hundred $$ for my lab.
Meanwhile, up in space, I’m trying to estimate the magnetic field of the iono-
sphere. My current detector measures scales in 10s of Gauss, the iono-
sphere has a field strength on order of 0.3–0.6 Gauss, with fluctuations of 
5% (plus we’ll have orbital variations). Since what my Calliope picosatellite 
is measuring is the fluctuation, not the field strength, this means I need to 
capture 0.06–0.1 Gauss signals if I want to simulate a magnetic detector on 
Earth.
However, that’s just based on uniform signal…we’ll be in a polar orbit, and 
the field lines dip more there so the magnetic field (and variability) will be 
24 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

higher. Clearly I need to do some orbital simulations. I suspect I will need to 
either rewire or rework the existing sensors. It’s a good thing I have a test rig
—every $10 spent on the ground saves thousands in potential failed mis-
sion risks!
Space Radiation Environment 25


4/Testing Formalism
There is functional testing, as opposed to environmental testing, which is 
different from launch survivability testing—oh my, so many tests. Function-
al testing is where you verify whether a component works or not, either iso-
lated or when integrated into your overall satellite. All the steps laid out pre-
viously provide you with a functional test schedule.
Environmental testing is where you test that a working component contin-
ues to work even when subject to the rigors of space. This primarily means 
vacuum testing and thermal testing. A homemade thermal vacuum cham-
ber will do nicely. This testing should be done for each of the isolated com-
ponents. Vacuum testing is a pain, because you had to:
1. Insert the part into your thermal vacuum chamber
2. Set up some test measurement system
3. Get to vacuum, run the test
4. Repressurize
5. Test the component once it comes out of thermal vacuum chamber, to 
ensure repressurizing didn’t damage everything
I recommend you do thermal vacuum chamber testing after you’ve finish-
ed your functional testing. You will have to break down your full assembly 
and retest each component in isolation, which is tedious. However, you will 
already have verified your original design and assembly and integration, so 
the bulk of this book is the test of survivability. Further, because you know 
integration works, you can reduce the number of test steps while maintain-
ing accuracy.
NASA CubeSat Requirements
NASA has one formal specification (among many) from their Launch Servi-
ces Program titled “Program Level Poly-Picosatellite Orbital Deployer 
(PPOD) 
and 
CubeSat 
Requirements 
Document” 
(http://
www.nasa.gov/pdf/627972main_LSP-REQ-317_01A.pdf). This short docu-
ment (nearly shorter than its title, at just 14 pages) gives a set of NASA 
specifications on the requirements for CubeSat and PPOD (CubeSat de-
ployment racks). They include vibration, shock, and thermal requirements 
27

as well as broader categories like power limits during phases of launch. If 
your satellite matches these requirements, you can likely be permitted on a 
NASA rocket. If you fulfill the NASA requirements, you likely can fulfill any 
private launcher’s requirements as well.
Among their requirements are several policy-level issues that are worth ex-
amining when you are designing your payload. The following are forbidden: 
pressurized vessels, propulsion systems, radioactive materials, explosive 
devices (including release bolts to open or expand mechanical assemblag-
es). Several picosatellite teams are specifically using picosatellites to devel-
op ion drive or pulsed plasma propulsion systems, so be aware that you may 
need to negotiate with your rocket provider if you are moving into territory 
this one set of NASA requirements forbids. That doesn’t mean you can’t do 
your experiment, but it does tell you that you will have to do additional justi-
fication and testing.
Other requirements are operational requirements. CubeSats under this spec 
must be powered off from the time of delivery until after deployed in-orbit 
(no power on during launch). Likewise, they cannot radiate RF (radiofre-
quency emission, either as radio signal or electronics noise) until 45 mi-
nutes after being deployed in-orbit. NASA under this spec presumes the 
payload is a CubeSat being deployed via a PPOD deployment mechanism. 
Again, you can do another plan, but the more you drift from this spec, the 
more paperwork you will incur.
In favor of picosatellites and standardization is that you can escape some of 
the risks that larger, more complicated missions face. Picosatellites are 
compact and minimalist payloads. I think most TubeSats and CubeSat are 
more resilant than a larger traditional satellite payloads (that might have 
extendable solar panels, optical benches, alignment requirements of 1mm, 
etc.), so such homebuilt tests in this book (I am hoping) will be sufficient pre-
tests for most DIY satellite projects. Folks doing plasma drives or that require 
alignment can chime in with a rebuttal, since they’re doing more mechani-
cally precise work.
The primary limitation in home test gear is we cover only a partial span of the 
entire range of potential launch problems that can occur. For example, our 
homemade shake table, built with an orbital sander on a router control, can 
span vibration frequencies up to 250 Hz. While that covers only the lower end 
of all possible rocket launch vibrations, it does a good enough job at break-
ing poor soldering joints such that a payload that survives that will likely 
survive launch. Similarly, you can get 3G of false gravity from the home cen-
trifuge we offer here—lower than the 10G limit a rocket potentially might 
have, but certainly good enough to do your primary structural testing.
28 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Just as important is that this book’s tests will let you quickly find problems 
and faults early in your build. We do not guarantee passing our tests en-
sures your satellite will survive every disaster launch might bring, but we can 
say with certainty that these tests will let you quickly find and fix early stage 
problems that would otherwise render your satellite dead on arrival.
Choosing and De-rating Parts
If you use off-the-shelf electronics parts instead of expensive, hard-to-find 
space-rated gear, will your satellite work? The process of derating will let you 
do this. Engineer Amanda Shields contributes this explanation: electrical 
components for spacecraft have to be derated. Basically, that means that 
you take the electrical component and you look at the data sheet for that 
piece and you have to say, “Well, according to the datasheet it can have a 
maximum input power of XX, but NASA says that it has to be derated to 80% 
of that, so we can actually only have an input power of YY.”
You have to do this for DoD type equipment because it is more critical for the 
project to succeed that a $5 mass produced alarm clock (that the owner can 
just send back to the company for a replacement). Traditionally they use this 
as the guideline for parts derating for spacecraft: http://snebulos.mit.edu/
projects/reference/International-Space-Station/SSP30312RH.pdf. 
There 
are other options out there, Goddard has a set of requirements that are lis-
ted here: https://nepp.nasa.gov/index.cfm/12821
There is also a list of Qualified Manufactures and Qualified Products (http://
nepp.nasa.gov/npsl/npsl_toc.htm). If you use an item off this list, that means 
it’s been approved for use and doesn’t have to be derated. There aren’t that 
many listed here and it’s usually cheaper to buy commercial parts and just 
go through the derating process.
(Amanda is working on the Capitol College VelcroSat orbital debris removal 
testbed picosatellite project.)
Sample Test Schedule
A sample test schedule would include:
I: Survival test and primary outgassing 
Place each board alone into chamber, run thermal vacuum cycle, re-
move boards and retest in isolation. This ensures that the conditions of 
space did not permanently destroy or distort any part of the board. It 
also allows for primary outgassing—the initial vaporization of any sol-
vents, chemicals, or other contaminants on your boards. Since materi-
als outgas in space, you want to let each board outgas on its own, so its 
outgassing components (if any) do not contaminate another board. See 
a sample schedule in “NASA Bakeout” (page 30).
Testing Formalism 29

II: Full system test 
Re-integrate your components, ensure they work on the lab bench, 
make sure your battery is charged, then run a full system thermal vac-
uum test. This complete test lets you use your existing comm system 
on the satellite to monitor your spacecraft’s functionality as it experi-
ences the vacuum and thermal cycles. This is a pass/fail test. If your 
spacecraft passes this test, you are in great shape and ready to move on.
If your spacecraft fails this test, much like the extended analogy of a dead 
PC, you now have a lot of work to do isolating components and retest-
ing. The general procedure if you fail this full system test is, first, test it 
fully assembled but out of vacuum.
If it doesn’t work outside of the chamber, that means vacuum or ther-
mal conditions broke something. Go back to your build-and-integrate 
steps, find the bad component, fix, and repeat. If your new build works, 
you’re set! If you keep breaking the same component in thermal vac-
uum testing, that means a design flaw and you have a design that isn’t 
space worthy, and thus you must redesign that component before 
proceeding.
NASA Bakeout
NASA has a formal thermal-vacuum bakeout process you must perform be-
fore integrating your payload into a NASA rocket, listed in the PPOD/CubeSat 
Requirements Document we cited earlier in this chapter. Their justification 
is “thermal-vacuum bakeouts are critical in assemblies of space flight hard-
ware to ensure the lowest levels of outgassing.” A short form of it starts with 
bringing your vacuum chamber (with payload inside, of course) to at least 5 
x 10-4 Torr. Record the pressure level and temperature, and keep recording 
this every 10 minutes. Raise the temperature from room temperature (25 C) 
to 70 C. Let it bake at 70 C for one hour, bring it back to room temperature, 
wait an hour, then do a second (final) bakeout up to 70 C for an hour, then 
finally let it come back to room temperature. “This will eliminate most of the 
outgassing that will occur at this temperature extreme.”
Solving Problems
Did it fail testing after you took it out of thermal vacuum? If so, there’s a part 
that’s failing due to space conditions. That is a serious problem. There are 
three approaches to solving this: brute force, stepwise integration, or bet-
ter testing.
30 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

For brute force, you simply test your flight spare instead and hope it works. 
If it does, your original had some subtle manufacturing or assembly defect, 
so toss it aside (with red stickers indicating DOA so you don’t accidentally 
use it!) and move on.
Stepwise integration is an approach you can immediately do instead of brute 
force, or the first thing to try if brute force failed (if the flight spare had the 
same thermal vacuum failure to operate). In this, you separate then slowly 
re-integrate each item in a series of thermal vacuum steps. A suggested 
sequence uses a truncated version of the original integration tests. I 
recommend:
1. Power + comm system to test that it can send signals (functionality 
retained in thermal vacuum)
2. Power + comm + CPU to test full functionality is maintained in thermal 
vacuum
3. Power + comm + CPU + sensors
4. All components, mounted in the skeleton: full build test
A better testing approach requires you incorporate test gear into your ther-
mal vacuum chamber. The intent here is that you can test each piece in 
isolation while it is within the thermal vacuum chamber. Typically, this means 
creating an extra port on your chamber so you can run your lab bench test 
leads (whatever you used to test it earlier) into the chamber. Then, you go 
through the full build-and-integrate test schedule, only this time in thermal 
vacuum, in order to precisely determine the point of failure. Armed with this 
information, you can then assess whether it is a manufacturing defect or a 
design flaw.
Test Sequence
From this, we get our set of required tests:
1. Vacuum testing I: Primary outgassing
2. Vacuum testing II: Surviving in an airless environment
3. Vacuum testing III: Thermal vacuum testing
4. Vibration and shake testing: Simulating a rocket launch
5. G-forces: Simulating the thrust of a rocket launch
6. Drop test: Simulating a drastic quick shift in position
7. Electromagnetic interference testing: Shielding and noise response in 
your circuits
Testing Formalism 31

What Exactly Are We Testing?
If you’re new to electronics, you may wonder what exactly we are testing, in 
a physical sense. There are three main things to check after any of these 
vibration, gravity, stress, bounce, and destruction tests. These are: gross 
physical damage, continuity, and actual operations. First, give the tested part 
a visual inspection to check for gross physical damage. Have any parts fall-
en off or become loosened? In particular, look for loose connections and 
loose solder joints.
If everything is tight, then you want to do a quick test with a continuity probe 
or voltameter to ensure that the circuits are indeed working. Working means 
that parts that should be connected still are, and that parts that shouldn’t 
touch are indeed not touching (and not causing a short circuit). You can 
specifically test for voltage drops and voltage level at key test points in your 
circuit. Key test points are something your schematic diagram indicates 
should have a specific value (a zero reference value, or a specific measured 
voltage). As part of this check, ensure that all grounds are indeed solidly 
attached to your primary ground.
Finally, you should power up the circuit and check that it functions as it 
should. Test it with appropriate input to make sure it is producing the de-
sired output. If it’s tight, connected, and working, it passed the test.
Formal Risk Analysis
A “risk” is the term for something that could go wrong. A formal look at risk 
analysis (part of systems engineering) deals with concepts such as risk cat-
egories, bundling risks, availability analysis, and making requests for 
changes (RFCs). The first step is to categorize a given risk as technical, 
schedule, or cost risk.
Technical 
Product may not be satisfactory
Schedule 
An essential milestone may not be met
Cost 
Cost budget may be exceeded
Risks are ranged by their likelihood of occurrence (low/medium/high) ver-
sus the consequences if risk is realized (low/medium/high). This gives you 
the overall severity (small, medium, large), often plotted as a 5x5 matrix 
(Figure 4-1).
32 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Availability analysis looks at mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean 
time to restore (MTTR) where availability A = MTBF/(MTBF+MTTR). For 
example, given a time between failures MTBF=400 hrs and a time to re-
store MTTR=2 hrs, we get an availability A=0.995, or during 1 year the sys-
tem is unavailable 16.7 times for a total of 43.8 hrs.
Figure 4-1. A standard risk matrix, image from the NASA Procedural Requi-
rements.
Going deeper, formal Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FME-
CA) is a process. In NASA’s MIKL-STD-1629A, “Procedures for performing a 
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis”:
1. Define conditions and constraints for each component
2. Define what constitutes failure
3. Assign probabilities and severities
Once you have a failure occur—an anomaly—you need to resolve it. The 
fundamental rule in anomaly resolution is that an anomaly, no matter how 
complex, has one and only one cause. The corollary: multiple failures don’t 
occur unless they cascade from a single root cause. From a testing point of 
view, this means that, if a component is not working or has a fault, you need 
to keep drilling down until you find a single root cause.
To give an example, if you plug in a TV and it doesn’t turn on, the problem 
could be the power, the on button, the TV’s display panel, or a variety of other 
causes—but it’s not all of them. Your job in testing and anomaly resolution 
is to find the one thing that went bad and caused the failure.
Testing Formalism 33

Fun fact: a survey of 13 spacecraft over 2 years indicates 
anomalies occur about every 7 months of spacecraft opera-
tions, with 1 lost during launch. For picosatellites with a life-
time in weeks, this figure isn’t useful. If your satellite is going 
to stay up for years, however, then you need to accept from 
the start that there will be anomalies.
The bulk of anomalies for satellites occur during launch and early orbit. This 
is the unproven time, the portion where a new satellite is experiencing the 
rigors of space and being powered up and operated for the first time in or-
bit. A short list of possible disasters to expect during launch and early orbit 
includes (from Squibb, Boden & Larson, Cost-Effective Space Mission Oper-
ations, 2006, pg 314):
• Increased volume (3x) of real-time events
• Volume of commanding (amount of instructions being received and run 
by the spacecraft computers)
• Amount of data processing for engineering telemetry
• Number of people involved in operations
• Number of activities that must be scheduled, checked, and conducted
• Shortened cycle times (doing more in less time; less time to move from 
activity to activity)
• Increased risk
• Tremendous forces on the rocket during its ascent
• Many firsts associated with each activity and subsystem
• Rapid sequential activities
• Single-point failures in the system design
• Demands on the ops team’s reaction (human factor)
• Launch and deployment
That’s a lot that can go wrong. Let’s start building gear to help launch-proof 
and orbit-harden our satellite on the ground, while it’s still in our hands.
34 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

5/Thermal Vacuum 
Chamber
Vacuum is a nasty environment. We have no pressure, we have outgassing, 
and (least we not forget) we have the simple removal of air. Materials out-
gas, which is to say, liquids and volatile solids boil off. This outgassing can 
then coat itself onto nearby parts. Ever buy something wrapped in plastic, 
and the item smells like plastic for the entire day after you unwrapped it? 
That’s outgassing. Now imagine plasticky vapor depositing itself on, oh, your 
eyes, and bonding there. Because in space, the outgassing stuff just may hit 
parts of the satellite as it evaporates away.
That is bad. It can coat detectors or solar cells. If any outgassing materials 
happen to be conductive (unlikely but possible), you can mess up circuits. 
Plus, it’s not tidy, letting stuff swirl away like that. However, in a vacuum 
chamber, you can have the bulk of the outgassing occur safely on the ground, 
sparing your components once in orbit.
Vacuum testing also ensures your soldered links are stable, and aren’t go-
ing to break due to air pockets, air conducting where there should be sol-
der, and similar mishaps. That’s part of the no pressure and removal of air 
issues. Maybe there’s a part or two that is fragile and can’t take the drop to 
zero pressure. Maybe there are air bubbles in a component due to poor 
manufacturing, which will cause it to break when it hits vacuum, as shown in 
Figure 5-1. (As the external pressure lowers, the balloon expands due to in-
ternal pressure.)
This is why you want to test your satellite in conditions as near to where it will 
be to make sure it can handle space. It’s pretty straightforward, actually. 
Imagine if you were building an underwater detector—you’d want to send it 
underwater. You don’t have to enumerate everything that might go wrong, 
you just immerse and see what happens.
So it is with vacuum. Instead of imagining every possible mishap, just test 
the sucker. And one usually does thermal testing along with vacuum test-
ing. Heat and cool your satellite while it’s in a vacuum to mimic the space 
conditions you expect. Hope it survives. Repeat if necessary.

If you’re curious what happens to humans in space, here’s the scoop from 
Imagine

answers/970603.html). Summary: a human in vacuum doesn’t explode, but 
does black out in about 15 seconds. Turns out our skin is like a good quality 
balloon; it holds us together quite well.
36 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Pressurized components, microfine wires, and highly finicky components 
are a separate issue. If you are flying an item that is pressurized and must 
keep that pressure even in space, without leakage, then you have to do ex-
tended vacuum testing. If you have a component that is in vacuum during 
launch and must remain evacuated until it gets to orbit, you have a situa-
tion requiring additional shock and vibration testing.
What is it like in orbit once we get there? In many ways, being in orbit 
(while a challenge) is, at least, less difficult than surviving the trip to orbit. 
Historically, more picosatellites have been lost during launch than during in-
orbit operations. However, vacuum is where the satellite will spend most of 
its life, so it needs to survive in an airless hot/cold environment.
Vacuum is hard to survive, as I keep emphasizing. Building a vacuum cham-
ber can be harder. Conceptually, it is simple: an airtight chamber attached 
to a vacuum pump, that is strong enough not to shatter inward due to pres-
sure differences. In practice, as with any plumbing or pressure work, you hit 
problems:
1. Any weak point will pop, ruining your vacuum.
2. If there is no weak point, the whole thing might up and burst.
The core orbit tests are vacuum and thermal conditions (Figure 5-2).
Pressures and vacuum notation
The only thing harder than getting a good vacuum is learning all the sche-
mas for describing it. Pressure is often measured in Pascals (Pa), Torrs, or 
atmosphere. A Torr is, by definition, 1 mm of Mercury displaced under nor-
mal gravity and pressure (written as 1 mm Hg). Sometimes inches Hg are 
used instead of mm Hg (1 inch = 25.4 mm). A Torr is 1/760th of an atmos-
phere and also equal to 134 Pa. Conversely, one atmosphere is 760 Torr or 
101.325 kPa (kiloPascals) or 29.92 in Hg.
Since vacuum one Earth is a negative pressure, vacuum pumps such as the 
COTS auto one chosen here use a scale of both mm Hg and Torr (0-30 in-
ches Hg equating to 0-760 Torr). I used Torr as a measurement unit be-
cause that is the unit my gauge uses for calibration. With atmosphere at 760 
Torr, a soft vacuum is anything below that down to perhaps 25 Torr, a good 
hard or high vacuum (desirable) is 1x10-3 Torr, and space itself is 1x10-6 Torr. 
If you have a gauge using inches, 1 atm = 29.92 in Hg.
Thermal Vacuum Chamber 37

Building and Using a Thermal Vacuum 
Chamber
Pumping down to -20 Torr (total pressure 740 Torr) technically is consid-
ered a dessicant, while pulling more than -20mm Torr of vacuum pressure 
are proper vacuum chambers. In absolute measures, a soft vacuum (or low 
vacuum/coarse vacuum/rough vacuum) is an absolute pressure going from 
just below 760 Torr atmosphere to perhaps an absolute level of 25 Torr and 
below, while the hard vacuum expected in LEO is a more characteristic 0.001 
Torr (1x10-3 Torr) and below, ideally getting down to 10-6 Torr. Achieving a 
stable hard vacuum is very hard, often expensive, and immensely finicky. For 
about $50, a half hour’s work, and no serious measuring, you can have a 
chamber capable of fitting a CubeSat and achieving soft vacuum (est. 250 
Torr).
Fortunately, the resin/modeling community has done good work in home-
made low vacuum chambers. For home use, we distinguish between high 
vacuum chambers and low vacuum chambers. We’re aiming for the latter.
Low vacuum is easier to reach and achieves most of our core goals:
• Outgassing
• Surviving vac/low pressure
• Thermal/radiative heat testing
As it happens, I ran into another “human vacuum” issue when buying the 
pump for my DIY chamber. For preliminary testing, I picked up a hand vac-
uum pump, the type often used to check automobile break lines. It’s not the 
hardest vacuum, but it’s enough to do the primary outgassing and basic 
sanity checks I’ll need early on.
The vacuum hand pump presented an unexpected challenge, particularly 
when hunting on eBay. It turns out there is an, err, type of vacuum hand pump 
that is used for, umm… enhancing the size of the male sexual organ. I did not 
want (nor need) that.
38 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Besides, those pumps look to be flimsy plastic, unable to hold a hard vac-
uum. And I want to test the satellite at levels that would make a typical sex 
organ simply explode (and not in a good way). As a matter of fact, even for 
automotive-grade parts, the plastic pumps are to be avoided; I went with 
metal.
High-grade vacuum pumps
On pro-grade oil pumps for vacuums. The good part is they can reach a 
higher (harder) vacuum. The downsides are they have a higher cost and, if 
your chamber fails, they have a backspray of oil that renders the entire 
chamber and all its contents oil-soaked and unusable without significant 
cleaning.
In the end, I bought a simple brass brake bleeder hand vacuum pump at 
Harbor Freight. On sale for $20, bargain! And best of all, I can safely certify 
that my satellite is 100% sex gadget free. Still keeping our PG rating, woo!
I hunted up DIY vacuum chamber construction ideas from others, and the 
best set of informational links was at DVForum. They use vacuum to make 
bubble free wax. Okay.
Among the other materials I need is a primary retort, and material I can use 
to make a lid. The lid will be plastic—thick acrylic. As it happens, I learned 
how to work acrylic when making custom pickguards for the electric gui-
tars I like to build.
So a technique from building electric guitars comes in handy when making 
a musical satellite. That shows that DIY hobby work is just like being in or-
bit. What goes around comes around.
Any good plan needs a fallback. If my DIY isn’t sufficient to pass InterOrbi-
tal spec, I can always hit up a nearby university to see if I can borrow their 
chamber—it’s a lot easier to borrow something if you’ve already tested the 
payload in your chamber so it’s not likely to explode in theirs.
The $100 Thermal Vacuum Chamber
The components (and one tool required) are:
1. A cheap 8qt (or bigger) stainless steel pressure cooker
2. A 1 foot x 1 foot sheet of Lucite or similar transparent plastic
3. A 1 foot x 1 foot 1/8" thick 60A smooth rubber sheet
4. A hand-pump auto/brake line bleeder vacuum pump
5. A brass hose fitting
6. Drill with spade bit able to make hole for hose fitting (typically 3/4")
Thermal Vacuum Chamber 39

7. Use of a tap-and-die to make screw threads for 3/4" hose hole
The main engineering required is that you’ll throw out the top of the pres-
sure cooker to make your own, using the rubber sheet as a soft washer to 
make a seal and the plastic to provide rigidity.
You put the rubber sheet on top of the pot, then the rigid plastic on top of 
that. Drill a hole in the plastic and a corresponding hole in the rubber for where 
the pump will attach. Cut out an observation window in the rubber—but make 
sure to leave a larger border (at least 1") around where the rubber meets the 
top of the pot. Drill, thread, and install the hose fitting into the plastic. Hook 
up the pump and you’re ready!
By the numbers:
1. Throw away the top of the pressure cooker and just keep the pot.
2. Lay the rubber sheet on top of the pot.
3. Lay the Lucite on top of the rubber. Decide where you want to drill for 
the hose fitting, and where you’ll want to have a see-through observa-
tion window.
4. Cut a hole in the rubber sheet in the places corresponding to the hose 
fitting.
5. Cut the rubber sheet to make the observation window, again keeping at 
least a 1" border around where the rubber meets the top of the pot to 
ensure a good seal.
6. Drill the hole in the Lucite for the hose fitting, thread the hole, then screw 
the hose fitting in (including a rubber washer, which is usually includ-
ed in the vacuum pump kit).
7. Using the hoses provided in the vacuum pump (and following that kit’s 
set-up instructions), attach the pump to your new hose fitting.
8. Make sure everything is clean and dry.
9. Lay the rubber on top of the pot, the Lucite on top of the rubber, and 
begin pumping (Figure 5-3)!
The rubber sheet will have an initial outgassing, so do your early tests and 
cycle the chamber (evacuate then let come back to normal pressure) sev-
eral times to allow this outgassing, before you even think of putting your gear 
in it.
40 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

On Pressure Cookers
Can’t you just use the pressure cooker as is for vacuum? Some people on the 
Web have reported using a pressure cooker as-is to maintain vacuum, and 
that is very tempting since it includes a hose fitting in the steel top. Howev-
er, the existing sealing mechanism is designed to be tight only when there is 
high pressure inside, and when you instead do the negative pressure of a 
vacuum, it’s leaky. Also, pressure cookers have a latch/valve combo on the 
handle that seals only if there is positive pressure. Although you can drill out 
the latch and manually hot-glue seal the valve, you still find that the includ-
ed gasket requires positive pressure to seal, and is not useful for a vacuum. 
There may be some brands of pressure cooker that are vacuum-ready, but 
if so, I haven’t found them.

Chamber Performance
We are using a hand pump, so this can be a little tiring. It took just 1 minute 
and 100 pumps to reach -130 Torr (-5 in Hg); 5 minutes of pumping to 
reach -380 Torr (-15 in Hg); another 5 to reach -500 Torr (-20 in Hg). Fif-
teen minutes of pumping reached -560 Torr (-23 in Hg), at which point I 
believe the chamber reached its limits. Past that, I could maintain but not 
increase the vacuum level. Engineers making a chamber with higher fidelity 
can certainly improve on this design, however, we repeat that a $50 cham-
ber that reaches soft vacuum and allows for outgassing and desiccation is 
an ideal component for any picosatellite builder.
For holding the vacuum, when set to an initial vacuum of -500 Torr (-20 in 
Hg), it dropped to -380 Torr (-15 in Hg) after 1 hour, and by 7 hours was at 
-130 Torr (-5 in Hg). If you want to do a lengthy outgassing or longer testing, 
you simply need to pump more. For those curious on the decay rate, using 
approximate conversion factors (it’s not that accurate a scale, after all):

Thermal/Vacuum Testing
Briefly, there are three ways that heat works in Earth. You can gain heat or 
lose heat (cool off) through conduction, convection, and radiation (radia-
tive heating and radiative cooling).
Conduction 
The heat flows from hot region to cold for a given solid, liquid, or gas. 
This includes flowing through anything touching your payload. If your 
payload has a different temperature than its surrounding air (or liquid), 
it will equalize. The material doesn’t change or move, the heat just dif-
fuses from hot to cold.
Convection 
The heat moves via currents in the material. Think of heat causing the 
material to flow away, carrying more heat than conduction.
Radiative 
This is heating up by absorbing photons (light) or cooling by radiating 
photons (light). For example, laying in the sun on a beach during the day, 
you absorb the Sun’s visible photons and heat up. Once it gets dark, you 
radiate out that acquired heat as infrared light and cool down. Color 
Thermal Vacuum Chamber 45

affects the rate of radiative heating and cooling. In general, darker col-
ors both absorb photons more readily, and radiate that heat back with 
equal strength if there is no light. Light or silvered objects absorb less, 
but also radiate less.
There is no conduction or convection in space, because there is only vac-
uum around you—no material to conduct heat, no material that could have 
currents to carry away heat. Only radiative heating and cooling occurs in 
space. In orbit, your problem is, further, that you alternate being in hot sun 
and cold dark. You tend to either heat rapidly, or cool rapidly, without hav-
ing any buffer between the two states.
For example, NASA notes at “Staying Cool on the ISS” (http://
science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/) that 
“without thermal controls, the temperature of the orbiting Space Station’s 
Sun-facing side would soar to 250 degrees F (121 C), while thermometers on 
the dark side would plunge to minus 250 degrees F (-157 C).”
A lighter color moderates the heating/cooling rate, so you get less hot in the 
sunlight and you hold the heat a little better so you get less cold in the dark. 
This is why the shuttle is painted white; it gives it better thermal control. 
Adding insulation also slows down the rate that you heat and cool, and this 
in turn reduces the extremes in temperature you will experience. If you can 
slow down the rate of heating, for example, then you don’t get as hot be-
fore the next dark cooling period begins.
For thermal/vacuum testing (literally testing the thermal properties while in 
a vacuum), I had two internal setups. One was to place the piece being tes-
ted directly on the base of the chamber. As an offset, I used a metal mini anvil 
as a platform. Given the size and scope of our chamber, I do not think there 
is a strong difference in either outgassing or vacuum testing with either ap-
proach. However, they will behave differently for thermal testing.
In thermal testing, there are (in the absence of air) only two heating and 
cooling mechanisms available: conductive and radiative. True LEO vacuum 
has only radiative (nothing there to conduct), but for our chamber, you have 
the contact point between the piece and the chamber itself to allow you more 
direct thermal conduction.
I recommend a direct approach for thermal tests, using external heat and 
cold sources conducting through the chamber walls directly to the test piece 
in order to test the thermal response of the pieces under temperature ex-
tremes. Choose the temperature extremes you expect from our earlier dis-
cussion (such as -30 C to 120 C), you can easily get to 0 C using ice or 
-78C using dry ice, and a high of 100 degrees simply with a boiling water bath, 
or higher using a hot plate or gas burner.
For this, you simply heat (using a burner) or cool (using ice or dry ice) the 
outside of the chamber near where the work is placed. Assuming you place 
46 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

the piece directly on the floor of the chamber or on a platform attached to 
the floor, that means just heating or cooling the base. You do not want to 
provide strong heating or cooling to the top of the chamber, as that may make 
the rubber seal brittle or leaky and damage your chamber.
You can heat or cool the bottom of the chamber, and the portion of the piece 
inside that is touching the chamber or platform will then heat (or cool). By 
varying this, you run the piece through its temperature extremes.
Heating Rates Due to Sunlight and 
Dark
For an object in Earth orbit, the sun puts out 1361 Watts per square meter 
(called the solar constant), assuming you’re facing it straight on. Assuming 
a 10cm x 10cm Cubesat profile, that means it gets about 14 Watts of direct 
heating on its surface. Alternately, you can call the solar constant 0.13 Watts/
cm2. We want to mimic this to see how our payload’s temperature will vary 
in space over time.
For a pure radiative setup, you can offset the object from the base using some 
sort of platform. You must minimize the amount of junk inside the cham-
ber, so avoid plastics or foam as much as possible. Otherwise, your plat-
form will outgas and contaminate the work! If you want a platform, the met-
al mini-anvil plus a thin foam or rubber coating to thermally isolate would 
suffice.
To provide purely radiative heating, shine a hand-held incandescent 100-
Watt light bulb over the display window to provide heating of the top side of 
the material. We are estimating that a 100 Watt bulb in a reflector housing 
(so the bulk of the light is directed out) is spread over the approximately 1/3 
meter diameter chamber yielding about 100 Watts over 706 cm2, or 0.14 
Watts/cm2—pretty near our required solar constant of 0.13 Watts/cm2. A 
more formal test should also use ultraviolet (UV) light, which requires spe-
cial bulbs (blacklight bulbs from novelty stores are a source of low power UV 
light, in a pinch).
The bottom side and any parts not in direct contact with the light will expe-
rience much less radiative heating—and that is only from reflections from 
the chamber’s interior. Any part that is in darkness will have no radiative 
heating, and will only feel heat due to slow conduction through the piece itself.
To ensure only radiative cooling, cover the observation window and chill the 
outside of the chamber (surrounding it with ice, for example). The item will 
emit infrared light, cooling in the process. The reason for chilling the cham-
ber is to ensure that any emitted IR that impinges on the chamber walls will 
be carried to the outside, and that the chamber itself does not emit IR to head 
the object. Radiative cooling is a very slow process.
Thermal Vacuum Chamber 47

For these tests, you want to monitor how quickly the temperature rises or 
falls when it is in sunlight or in darkness. This will give you an idea of how the 
payload temperature will vary. If you run a pair of 90-minute orbit simula-
tions, you can gain a very good idea of the likely temperature range it will 
experience as well.
To run this, just place the object in the chamber and evacuate to soft vac-
uum. Keep the chamber dark, surround it with ice, and let it cool to a low 
equilibrium of a bit above 0 C. This is our estimate of the initial cold 
temperature your spacecraft is likely to experience. As we noted earlier, your 
spacecraft will swing between temperature extremes over the course of a 
90-minute orbit, and part of this test design is to try and discover what those 
limits will be for your satellite’s exact shape and materials.
To run the thermal test, shine the radiative light source on the payload for 45 
minutes (half an orbit), then go dark for 45 minutes, then light it for 45 mi-
nutes, then go dark for 45 minutes. The temperature change over time for 
that second pair of light/dark should give you a decent estimate of how 
quickly your satellite heats and cools, and what limits are likely.
These limits derived from simulated orbit day/night cycles are the temper-
ature operating range that your satellite must be able to function within.

6/Launch Tests
Historically, a number of CubeSat and conventional satellites fail to reach 
orbit or fail upon arrival into orbit. The stresses of a rocket launch are the 
number one killer of satellites. Preparing for the initial launch and early op-
erations phase of your mission is therefore the most critical in determining 
whether your mission succeeds.
However, rocket testing is harder than in-orbit testing. You can cook up a 
thermal vacuum chamber to test vacuum and temperature swings expect-
ed during the mission lifetime. It is harder to simulate a rocket launch. We 
will walk through some testing to prepare. The testing you need to do is 
primarily shake, rock, and roll.
Shake tests are vibration and acoustic testing to ensure your satellite can 
handle the rattle and hum of the rocket launch. Rock-and-roll testing is the 
centrifuge G-force testing to simulate your satellite being crushed by G-
forces as the rocket barrels up in flight. A drop test neatly wraps up the set, 
simulating small, sharp movements during prep, launch, or in deployment. 
All three are ways your satellite can be battered about any of its axes.
Key to note is that, since picosatellites are often a secondary payload, you 
may not know which way will be up for your satellite launch. You cannot build 
assuming a specific orientation. Therefore, you need to test how your satel-
lite survives G-forces along all directions.
At a recent nanosatellite conference, I asked whether NASA or other places 
could assist with testing for survivability on a rocket. The answer was mixed. 
Basically, there are places that have facilities for test, that you can either beg 
time or pay for time to use them. This is almost always on a who you know 
basis, however. You need to contact or network with people at a well-
equipped university that does picosatellite work, in order to use their shake-
rock-and-roll testbed.
Vibration Testing
Michael Collins of Apollo 11 wrote about his earlier Gemini rocket flights, “The 
first stage of the Titan II vibrated longitudinally, so that someone riding on it 
would be bounced up and down as if on a pogo stick. The vibration was at a 
relatively high frequency, about 11 cycles per second, with an amplitude of 
plus 
or 
minus 
5 
Gs 
in 
the 
worst 
case.” 
(source: 
http://
www.vibrationdata.com/rocket.htm) The Constellation program had a pri-
mary typical frequency of 10-15 Hz (cycles per second).
49

Figure 6-1. The van-sized Astro-E X-ray satellite is put on a shake table, 
with 100 accelerometers attached to measure stress and strain as it is put 
through the shake test.
A rocket vibrates as it launches, due to engine throttling and (during the early 
parts) wind resistance. Each stage of the rocket will induce changing vibra-
tions, as well as the vibration from stage shutdowns and stage separations. 
The range of vibration depends on the rocket.
The NASA Preferred Reliability Practices report (Practice No. PD-ED-1259) 
gives the typical range as being from 20 Hz to 2,500 Hz, with carry-over 
frequencies up to 10,000 Hz. This wide a range is perhaps beyond home 
testing.
Vibration testing can be done on a rocker table, shaker table, or other appa-
ratus to mimic these cases. Many professional testbeds can do frequen-
cies up to 10,000 Hz with a 2-inch throw (moving the object back-and-forth 2 
inches over 10,000 times each section!) (Figure 6-1). We’re going to aim for 
a shorter throw and focus on the lower frequencies in our home testing.
50 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Vibration Spectra
Vibrations have both frequency and amplitude. Frequency is how many times 
per second there’s a shake, and amplitude is the strength of each shake. To 
give an example, if I tap you three times each second, that’s 3 Hz in frequen-
cy (3 times per second, since 1 Hertz = 1 Hz = once/second) with a low 
amplitude. If I punch you three times each second, it’s the same frequency 
but with a stronger amplitude, and you will therefore take more damage.
Each rocket has its own vibration spectra, which is a profile of the range of 
frequencies and amplitudes that your payload on that rocket will suffer. The 
NASA spec mentioned in Chapter 4 provide one set of numbers. Alternate-
ly, this handy reference from the CalPoly “Test Pod’s User’s Guide” to the 
NASA GEVS worst case profile: (http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mjregan/
MCubed/Pages/Documents/TestPodUser%27sGuide.pdf) gives you a set 
of limits. If you can survive the GEVS worst case, you can survive any rock-
et out there.

The CalPoly reference also includes the schematics for a test PPOD, or test 
rig that simulates the brief shock of deploying from your rocket to space. For 
those seeking specific hardware tests, I recommend you consult that docu-
ment and also request the vibration spectra from your rocket launch com-
pany. Again, our focus in this book is DIY testing to improve the robustness 
of your satellite and increase your chances of surviving launch, successful-
ly deploying, and surviving orbit for several months. Ideally, even if you have 
access to a university, corporate or government test facility, you will want to 
do the tests in this book to ensure your satellite has greater odds of pass-
ing their more thorough (and more expensive) testing regime. Either way, 
you win.
Launch Tests 51

Figure 6-2. All you need for a homebuilt short-throw vibration table: an os-
cillator sander, a workbench, cable ties, and a router speed control.
Shaker Design
For our inexpensive homebuilt shaker table design, I modified an electric 
orbital sander to hold the spacecraft, then added a variable speed control 
(rheostat). You can also get variable speed orbital sanders. Look for a 
random-orbit or oscillating sander, typically available for $25-$60. The fre-
quency for these can range up to 15,000-25,000 rotations-per-minute (rpm, 
e.g., with a DeWalt random orbital sander), which yields approximately 250 
Hertz or higher (or 250 cycles per second) of vibratory oscillation. To this 
you’ll add a router speed control, nylon, cable ties, and something to bolt it 
to (Figure 6-2).
By design, these tend to be fixed-speed devices, so you’ll also need to pur-
chase a router speed control, which is a 120V AC potentiometer designed to 
make any power tool variable speed (Figure 6-3). Being able to dial this down 
yields a range of 10 Hz to 250 Hz, giving you an inexpensive test of the pri-
mary resonance vibrations that you have to survive during launch.
The sander needs a solid base. I used the same $25 vise workbench used for 
the homemade centrifuge. Vise the sander in, then add a shield around at 
least three sides of the device in case parts go flying off during testing 
(Figure 6-4). Seriously, this setup will put out very potent shakes, and you 
need to minimize potential collateral damage if a part breaks loose.
52 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Figure 6-3. An off-the-shelf router control will let you dial down the fixed-
speed sander to cover the range needed. (image courtesy of router 
manufacturer)
Figure 6-4. A sturdy workbench holds the sander, and a cardboard shield 
protects bystanders from flying debris.
Finally, you need to fasten the payload to the vibration pad. Use two sets of 
nylon cable ties. The sander bed uses a lever that is usually there to tighten 
down on the sandpaper. Since we are not using sandpaper, instead you open 
the lever. Then, fasten the payload with one set of cable ties so it’s slightly 
tight. Practice closing the level—tightening the cable ties—until the ties are 
at maximum tightness with the lever closed.
Launch Tests 53

Figure 6-5. Use double twist ties to ensure the work doesn’t fly across the 
room and smash into a window.
Now, attach the second set of cable ties to the fixed payload and hand-
tighten. Make sure that the two sets of cable ties are applying their force to 
different sections of the payload, so that you have two points of stability 
where they are fixed to the sander.
At this point, you are ready to test. As with any of our home-built power tool 
setups, make sure you stay below the apparatus, so that any parts that break 
up fly away safely overhead.
Run the vibration cycle slowly from low- to high-frequency, then dial it back 
down. I recommend you run it for at least 1 minute at each of a half dozen 
frequencies, doubling each frequency shift: 10 Hz, 20 Hz, 40 Hz, 80 Hz, 160 
Hz, 250 Hz. Assume a linear response, that is, given a frequency of 10 Hz at 
the lowest setting and 250 Hz at the highest, you can estimate where each 
frequncy interval is (approximately). During the transition between frequen-
cies, do this as slowly as patience allows.
54 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Acoustic Testing
A NASA report definition states that “acoustic noise results from the prop-
agation of sound pressure waves through air or other media. During the 
launch of a rocket, such noise is generated by the release of high velocity 
engine exhaust gases, by the resonant motion of internal engine compo-
nents, and by the aerodynamic flow field associated with high speed vehi-
cle movement through the atmosphere.”
Figure 6-6. The acoustic test chamber at NASA/GSFC, big enough to fit a 
truck (or a satellite). Figure courtesy of NASA.
Acoustic testing is similar to vibration testing (as it is sound-induced vibra-
tion) combined with pressure testing. In this case, the acoustics can cause 
pressure increases on the payload. Acoustic waves up to 160dB are used in 
professional tests. Space Travel notes a testing device that spans a frequen-
cy range of 20-5,000 Hz at pressures (amplitudes) up to 160dB. If you wish 
to do industrial-grade testing, however, that is beyond the scope of this 
document.
I cannot recommend doing 160dB acoustic testing in a home lab. At NASA’s 
GSFC, their acoustic testing uses speakers taller than a person, do not al-
Launch Tests 55

low anyone in the room, and use tremendously thick doors to ensure sound 
leakage out of the room doesn’t deafen bystanders. The American Hearing 
Research 
Foundation 
(http://american-hearing.org/disorders/noise-
induced-hearing-loss/) lists 15 minutes at 115dB as auto horn/loud rock 
concert level, causing damage in just 15 minutes of exposure. At 140 dB 
(jet engine, gun shot), damage occurs even if exposure in brief.
If you have a sine-wave generator hooked up to a normal stereo amplifier and 
wish to sweep, briefly, across a 20-5,000 Hz frequency range at low ampli-
tudes (below 100dB, aka chainsaw level), that should suffice for picosatel-
lite work. Remember that the acoustic vibrations are already covered in your 
vibration testing, and the pressure differentials set by acoustics are less for 
a compact picosatellite than it would be for the extended body of a larger 
satellite, ergo, neglecting acoustic testing should not greatly increase your 
risk.
Drop Testing
This is the easiest test. It is designed to mimic any of the several short, sharp 
movements your payload will encounter, including:
• An accidental drop during transport or integration
• The small kachunk drop that occurs when your payload is placed into 
the payload compartment
• The small kachunk as the payload is attached to the rocket
• Any less-than-gentle placement of the rocket onto the rocket launch 
stand
• Any short impulses that occur as your payload is ejected from the rock-
et during deployment
You can see why it’s very useful to have a payload that can survive a brief 
short shock. I once saw a NASA/JAXA satellite do a drop test. It was anticli-
mactic. The entire payload was in a stand, then poof the whole thing drop-
ped a very short distance. You can mimic this with the famous one-foot drop 
test used by computer hardware people. Take your payload, lift it a foot above 
your desk, then drop it. If it can’t survive that (from any facing), redesign.
A more formal drop test can be done to ensure that any momentum trans-
fer from weight surrounding your picosatellite doesn’t add to the impact. Add 
a flat five pounds of weight on top of the payload, and drop from one foot 
(again). This adds crushing to the previous drop’s “impact shock”.
Most picosatellites tend to be either a titanium CubeSat shell or strong plas-
tic tubing braced against boards using steel screws (like TubeSats). I’ve had 
a friend stand on a CubeSat shell and it hasn’t buckled. Use the drop test to 
make sure that everything is extremely firmly fastened into place and tight-
ly held together.
56 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

A common formal spec is to have a safety factor of 1.25 or more. Given our 
on-the-fly calculation style and use of estimation, though, that’s 1.25 of an 
already vague number. For now, we go with test it hard.
Note this is all completely different from a drop test used to test parachute 
landings or payload recovery. Consider this the launch-drop or accidental-
drop testing, not a recovery drop test.
Static Loading
Larger satellites are tested for stress and strain—forces pulling unevenly 
upon them. For picosatellites, being small and compact is an advantage. A 
picosatellite performs as a nearly perfect rigid compact body, and builders 
can often neglect issues of whether there is a different strain on one end 
versus the other. Picosatellites with extended components—expanding so-
lar panels or robot arms—will be deploying such items only after launch, in 
zero-G conditions, so testing as a rocket test component is not necessary 
here.
We now handle the last portion of our rocket test, building a centrifuge to see 
how our picosatellite handles the crushing thrust forces of launch.
Launch Tests 57


7/G-Force Testing
Rockets are powerful stuff, and satellites and astronauts experience tre-
mendous G-forces pushing down on them during launch. Your satellite will 
experience up to 10G (10 times Earth’s gravity) during launch. It is impor-
tant to test this. For picosatellite work, it is necessary that your design be 
able to withstand these forces. To test this, the easiest way is to build a 
centrifuge. It is also easy to test. We’ll offer two systems—the lab-oriented 
motor centrifuge and a more casual rope centrifuge. Both can reach up to 
3G force.
Think of the spinning bucket gimmick. If you tie a bucket to a rope and fill it 
with water, you can make the bucket swing in a loop-the-loop over your head 
and not spill, as long as it is spinning fast enough. You need enough spin to 
counteract the 1G of the Earth’s pull, so you need a spinning centrifuge of at 
least >1G.
Most homebuilt centrifuges are used by mad scientists doing medical or 
chemical studies that require they separate a fluid by density. For satellite 
building, we can use a far simpler design. Yes, you can actually just spin your 
satellite in a bucket at the end of a rope—or build a 3G spinning rig using an 
ordinary electric drill.
G-Force Theory
For both designs, you are going to spin your satellite on the end of a long rod 
or rope in order to create centrifugal force to mimic high G forces. This is how 
exciting amusement part rides can spin you and force you back into your 
seat (or why you get thrown against the door during a very fast automobile 
turn).
The governing equation is that force = mass * acceleration = mass * 
gravity. Since we’re trying to create pseudogravity by the acceleration due 
to spinning, we use the centrifugal term where acceleration = velocity 
squared / radial distance out, or our angular velocity (rotations per 
second) squared * radius.
Put simply, if you double your spinning radius for a given spin rate, you dou-
ble the G force you’re creating. If you double your rate of spin, your G forces 
goes up by a factor of four. So we can look at four setups:
59

Electric Drill 
1. Attaching a half-meter throw arm to an electric drill
2. Attaching a longer meter throw arm to an electric drill
Swinging a Rope 
1. Swinging a payload at the end of a 1 meter rope by hand
2. Swinging a payload at the end of a 2 meter rope by hand
We have to look at the specifications for electric drills both in terms of how 
fast they turn (rpm) and how much torque or twisting power they can pro-
vide. We’ll need both—we are generating false gravity by the spin rate, but 
we need the torque to actually move our spinning test rig at all. An ordinary 
1/4" electric drill typically spins at 1,600-2,800 rotations per minute (rpm), 
or 24-48 Hz (rotations per second). A 3/8" electric drill provides more tor-
que in return for a penalty of a slightly slower spin rate of 300-1,600 rpm. 
Finally, a heavier-duty 1/2" drill drops to 500 rpm or under 10 Hz, in favor of 
higher torque.
For our rig, we chose a 3/8" drill simply because we found a 1/4" drill did not 
have enough torque to move our centrifuge rig. Torque is crucial, in partic-
ular because the drill has to move not just the payload, but everything at-
tached to it. We are applying a heavy load by attaching a centrifuge swing 
arm, dropping the speed by an estimated 50%. We also have to factor in the 
weight of the centrifuge arm. For each kg of our desired payload, we will end 
up having several kg of centrifuge arm to support this.
Alternately, we can simply use a bucket on a rope method and fasten our 
payload to the end of a sturdy rope, then spin that rope by hand to achieve 
our requisite force. How many rotations per second must we achieve? Let’s 
look:
• 1 Gravity is 9.8 m/s2, which we’ll round to 10 m/s2 for convenience.
• Our pull in Gs = w2 * radius (meters), where w = radians per second.
• One rotation is 2pi radians, so Gs = (2pi)2 * rps2 * radius (meters), 
or approximately 36 * rps2 * radius.
• Assuming a 1 meter throw arm, then our pull in Gs is (36 * 1m/10 m/s2) 
* rps2 = 3.6 * rps2.
To achieve (for example) 10 Gs, we need 6 rps (36 = rps2)! If we reduce our 
throw arm to 0.5 m, we need just over 8 rps (72 = rps2). If we increase our 
throw arm to 2 m, we need just over 4 rps (18 = rps2).
Experimentation shows that a typical 3/8" drill can manage 3G using an 1 
meter throw arm, while a sufficiently slow build-up can lead to spinning a 2-
meter rope at 3G.
60 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Danger! By definition you are spinning a heavy object at very 
high speed. If your apparatus breaks, you basically have shrap-
nel flying around your lab. Do not do any 10G centrifuge work 
in the presence of people, animals, windows, or breakables. If 
your 1-meter long throw arm breaks during a full speed test, 
that object is going to fly off with a velocity equal to dropping 
that object on your head from a second story window. It’s 
basically a 1kg weight traveling at the speed of a shotput. So 
be careful and remove living creatures and breakables.
A typical 3/8" electric drill can spin from 300 to 1600 rpm (rotations per 
minute), providing a torque (or spinning power) of 500-100 Newton me-
ters, i.e., at 300 rpm you get 500 Nm, at 1600 rpm you get 100 Nm. Often 
drills say they can get only half their usual rpm under a heavy load, which 
we’ll factor in later. A drill rpm * a conversion factor of (60sec per min) yields 
the rps, or put simply, rps = rpm * 60. For proper geometric calculation, you 
convert rps to the odd unit of radians per second by multiplying by 2pi. 
Torque, or twisting force, is given as Torque = Force * length = (for this case) 
F * arm_radius.
This actually makes a handy lab for a physics class. For the simple case of 
a 1-meter rotational arm, we calculated the necessary rotations per second 
earlier. Torque is more key—do you have enough twisting power to spin it? 
Given torque = G * radius (where “G” equals whatever G force we are try-
ing to achieve) and we’re using a lever arm of radius=1m, you need to be able 
to pull 10 N*m of torque—again within the limits of most electric drills. That 
is just for the payload, though, and neglecting the mass (moment of inertia) 
of the arm itself.
Roughly, for each kilogram of apparatus that must spin, you can multiply the 
torque necessary by that factor. So if we need 10 N*m of torque per de-
sired G-force for a 1kg payload, adding on 4kg for a sample apparatus means 
we’ll need 4*10 N*m of torque (4x the amount). So to pull 3G, we’ll need 3 * 
4*10 N*m of torque, or 120 N*m. Remember now our factor of 50% efficien-
cy if the drill must operate at high torque, and suddenly we’re at 300 N*m of 
torque needed. Assuming a 1-meter arm and thus needing 6 rps (aka 360 
rpm), that means we’re just about at the limits of our drill.
A writeup at the Aquatic Pathobiology Laboratory suggests plotting a nono-
gram of RPMs versus G-forces needed as a visual comparison of G-force 
(maximum relative centrifugal force) to RPMs (rotations per minute). Over-
kill for this level work, but it’s worth introducing the term for those who wish 
to study further.
G-Force Testing 61

Hand-Powered G-force Rig
As mentioned, you can simply place your payload in a bag at the end of a 2-
meter rope, then go outside and start swinging the rope around. I was able 
to reach G-forces (see sidebar for using a smartphone to measure it) of 
2.5G with simple manual spinning. While this may lack a certain coolness, 
it’s a very quick and easy way to do some initial structural tests.
Accelerometers
You will want to calibrate your system to see how many Gs you can pull. 
Almost all smart phones now include an accelerometer, as do a number of 
gaming devices. An accelerometer is a device that measures how much you 
move (or accelerate) your device in any direction. It’s a fancy term for a type 
of internal motion sensor. There are several iPhone and Android apps for 
measuring G-forces, including listings under accelerometer, elevator, and 
Porsche. I recommend you run the rig with a smartphone running in an ac-
celerometer mode (Figure 7-8) to see how high a G-force you are achieving.
Many amateur high altitude balloon projects have flown an iPhone or Android 
phone as their balloon payload. Some picosatellite builders are contemplat-
ing the next step of flying an iPhone as their primary satellite command and 
communication system. With the growing number of sensors being built into 
smart phones, your smart phone could also service as a science device. For 
now, though, we’ll just use it for assistance in testing.
The usual warnings apply: do this in an open area, clear the area of any-
thing that an escaping payload might damage, and clear all bystanders out 
of the area. One plus is, since you’re the motor at the center of this setup, 
you’re in the safest place possible. You will want to adjust the length of the 
rig to find a personal sweet spot. I found a 20-foot rope had too much drag 
to spin fast enough, while a 5-foot rope was easily spun but needed much 
higher RPMs to get a decent G-force (Figure 7-1). For my rig, a middle length 
of 12 feet worked best, but of course it’s both easy and more practical for you 
to find one that works for your own level of personal strength.
The Drill-Powered G-force Rig
The components you need are very simple: a spade bit to use as the axle, 
wood blocks to secure the axle, a long piece of wood as a throw arm, glue to 
fasten it together, a workbench to brace it, a drill to power it (Figure 7-2).
62 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Figure 7-1. An extremely simple hand-spun G-force rig that takes about 1 
minute to build and can reach 2.5 G without trouble.
Figure 7-2. Everything needed to build your own 3-G centrifuge.
First you need to build the swing arm that fastens to the drill. We use a 1" 
wood boring spade bit as our axle. We’ll take advantage of the flat head of 
this bit by encasing it in wood blocks (Figure 7-3). We can then attach our 
long wood arm to this axle and have a stable propellor-like centrifuge swing 
arm.
To build the housing for securing the spade bit, first lay the three pieces of 
wood as if they were a solid block and examine how the bit will fit. In our case, 
G-Force Testing 63

Figure 7-3. A snapshot of the axle during assembly, showing the layers.
we drilled a hole for the base block, a slot for the middle long arm, and a hole
+half slot for the top block. This way, the three blocks will solidly trap and 
encase the spade bit and create a very solid connection. Glueing the three 
blocks will create a solid connector (Figure 7-4).
Once built, you now have a propellor-like swing arm that will fit into any stan-
dard drill. We need to put it onto our 3/8" drill and find a way to secure this 
rig so it’s stable.
You need a very solid base. I used an inexpensive ($25) vise worktable to 
serve as the centrifuge base. The drill clamps vertically into the table, allow-
ing for a free horizontal spin path for the centrifuge (Figure 7-5). Your rig 
doesn’t have to be perfectly aligned or balanced, but aim to get close to that. 
Setting the axle by hand sufficed, and I found (for 1kg payloads) I didn’t need 
to add a counterweight to the other end. Warning—a homebuilt centrifuge 
can seriously hurt you.
You can’t run this setup by holding the drill in your hand, obviously. I picked 
up a $20 workbench to fasten this to. Ideally, you should run this outside, 
using tent stakes and rope to ensure the base is secure. Place the drill in-
side the vise-top, then tighten it down. Most drills have cheap plastic cas-
ings so it can be hard to find a stable part to vise into. I found near the drill 
chuck was more solid than the body. Once it’s vised in place, realize it is now 
fixed along one axis (left to right) but can still tilt up or down slightly, as the

vise is not directly preventing that direction. The resulting wiggle along that 
direction was extremely strong and therefore requires more support. Clamp-
ing in crossbars was sufficient to create a stable hold along both directions 
(Figure 7-6).
Figure 7-6. Firmly brace your centrifuge, using the vice-like table for one 
axis and either clamping or (for a more permanent rig) nailing down cross-
bars to support the other axis.
To fasten the payload, I drilled holes at the beam’s end, then used twist ties 
to secure the payload onto the bar. Pictured is a test setup using a bare 
TubeSat shell (Figure 7-7).
Drill: you need a variable speed drill, the sort that goes faster the more you 
push the trigger. You need to start slow then let it gradually come up to speed. 
A $25 3/8 inch drill from Harbor Freight sufficed for me. I did try it with a 
fixed-speed drill; the jerk where the drill tries to go from zero to full speed 
nearly flipped the rig over. So go variable and go slow. The safest place to be 
during a run is underneath it, which puts you nicely in place to run the test.
66 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

1. Set up rig securely, and fasten in payload.
2. Give it a test spin to make sure it’s roughly balanced.
3. Crouch underneath and slowly bring it up to speed.
4. Run it a minute or so, then let it slow down.
5. Remove and examine.
Figure 7-7. A sample payload on our homebuilt 3-G centrifuge.
With our heavy test setup, we were able to achieve 3G with the standard 3/8" 
electric drill. At that level, though, the drill engine actually smoked. It still ran, 
but it was clearly at its operational limit. A better design would minimize the 
weight of the axle mounting blocks and the centrifuge throw arm, as they 
weighed significantly more than the payload and thus the bulk of the drill’s 
torque was not being used by the payload. However, even a 3G rig that costs 
under $50 and can be built in 20 minutes will be of great use in doing your 
initial rocket gravity testing.
G-Force Testing 67

Avoiding Harm to People and Things
Two of the pieces of test gear (G-force centrifuge and Shake table) use or-
dinary power tools (electric drill and oscillating sander, respectively) but can 
do significant damage to a workshop or person if there is a malfunction and 
the user doesn’t take precautions. For the G-force rig—basically a giant hor-
izontal propeller with the payload attached the end—if it breaks loose from 
the vise mounting or the actual rig or payload detaches, it will fly out at great 
force and can break a window (or person, if someone is careless enough to 
stand anywhere other than where I recommend, which is underneath the rig 
in the operator’s station). For the shake tester, we’re vibrating the payload 
at high oscillations and a part could conceivably break free (or the entire 
payload could become unattached) and go shooting across the room (I rec-
ommend safety goggles, placing it in a cardboard enclosure, and as always 
staying in the operating station underneath the rig.)
By analogy, it’s about the same danger as using a chainsaw to cut down trees
—not a problem if you follow procedures but not quite as routine as drilling 
a hole.

8/Good Test 
Procedures
The answer to where you should test your picosatellite is everywhere. You 
need to test it in the lab while it’s being built, then after it is being built. Then 
test it remotely from across the lab, hands-off, to make sure the basic com-
munications channels work. You can then fly it on a helium low-altitude bal-
loon to make sure it works floating free and that you can communicate with 
it and operate it. Try a high altitude balloon if you can, to see how it be-
haves in rarified air. Booking a sub-orbital or ballistic launch can give it a good 
rocket test and vacuum test, though it’s worth pointing out that will make it 
experience extra jarring.
Your satellite will by nature be modular in design. It will have the basic bus or 
platform (one component), then the instruments or experiment. A given bus 
design can be reused for different experiment packages, so having a robust 
bus that survives one flight is a great way to start a series of picosatellite 
missions, each building on the last. Finally, picosatellites come in 1U (single 
cube), 2U (two cubes), and 3U (3 cube) form factors, and you can consider 
testing them in segments.
Flight Spares
You must always build at least two of every spacecraft board. I cannot em-
phasize this enough. During testing, you will have a primary build set that you 
are using, and your flight spare. Both should be tested. By definition, your 
flight model will be the board that best passes testing, and the spare is the 
second best of the boards that survived testing. (Any board that fails test-
ing is simply DOA—dead on arrival—and should be thrown out or reworked.) 
Further, if a board fails on your primary at any stage of the test, you can swap 
in the working flight spare and be able to proceed without having to restart 
at square one.
This can be illustrated by example. A designer (call her Gallant) builds two of 
each board. It’s not much work to build two at a time, since all the equip-
ment and gear is already set up. Once done, she can put away the current 
gear and then set up her lab bench for the next step, so everything is mov-
ing in a timely, well controlled fashion. Each of her boards test well in isola-
tion, and also when tested solo in a vacuum chamber. While doing a final test 
69

of the satellite in the vacuum chamber, however, it doesn’t work, and exami-
nation reveals a capacitor split open. Gallant can simply take the tested flight 
spare, swap it into the integrated build, and retest in the vacuum chamber. 
It passes, so she’s ready to move on.
Meanwhile, a second designer (call him Goofus) builds only one of each 
board. Again they test well in isolation on the bench and in the vacuum 
chamber. But when his integrated build fails, he now has more work. He has 
to rebuild the defective board, and test it on the bench, and retest it accord-
ing to the integration test, then retest it solo in vacuum. Each time, he has to 
remember how he did the original, reset his work environment, and redo all 
those steps. Only then can he swap in the new component and get back to 
the integrated testing. Poor Goofus has blown his build schedule by not hav-
ing a flight spare.
Often, you’ll make several of a key component—a CCD, a collimator, an am-
plifier. Then you’ll test them all, and put the highest performing one onto the 
final payload. So the spares aren’t bad, per se, but they are not as optimal as 
the ones you use (obviously enough).
Should you do more than two? Heck yes. If you can afford it, build three or 
four of a given component. For expensive items, such as solar cells or Radio-
metrix transmitters or (depending on your budget) Arduino or BasicX-24 
chips, you may be limited to two. However, you can still get 3-4 of a given PCB 
printed and place the stock components, neglecting only the expensive 
parts, so that you can do a quick swap-and-go refit if a primary board fails 
due to a solder joint or a non-expensive component.
The pluses of using flight spares is that the hardware research is already 
done, as is most of the manufacturing. So the cost is much lower. The down-
side is, a flight spare isn’t a ready-to-fly backup. Instead, it’s one or more 
partial assemblies of the equipment. Typically, it hasn’t been tested—or it’s 
the parts that were tested and failed, so they got shuffled out of the final 
payload. So flight spares can be a source of parts, but slightly lesser parts.
For those that are future-looking, having working, tested spares around al-
so means your second and third satellite are very evolved after your first 
launch is a success. No one said you only have to fly once!
Test Scheduling and Isolated Testing
A good test schedule is folded into your build and integration timeline. You 
are not going to go straight from building a satellite on a lab bench to launch-
ing it into orbit. Part of testing is testing each component in isolation be-
fore you hook it up to the other parts. Then you test the entire build while it’s 
on the ground. From that, you do distance tests to ensure both that the 
satellite components work and that, equally important, you are able to re-
motely send and receive sufficient health and safety information that you 
know whether it works.
70 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Next, an optional but recommended step is to do a short balloon launch, 
using an easy-to-get weather balloon and store-bought helium. This test is 
like a warmup run, a full shake-out that has a little bit of shaking and mov-
ing, a little bit of distance command and control, and the tiniest bit of pres-
sure work. A balloon that goes up only to the height of a typical model rock-
et launch, say 1100 feet (335 meters), is only going 1/1000th of the height 
you need to get to orbit, and will experience only a 4% pressure drop from 
normal atmospheric pressure. However, it experiences all those changes—
shake, distance, and pressure—at the same time. One way to think of the 
balloon test is that, while it will not ensure success, it can let you quickly 
diagnose any major problems cheaply and easily, well before you launch into 
space and have no recovery or recourse available.
For such low altitude ballooning, you can use a tether line to ensure you can 
recover your balloon. For more extreme altitude balloon tests, issues such 
as tracking, range safety (i.e., avoiding hitting houses, powerlines, and air-
craft), and recovery of your balloon are a topic for a separate book. One 
dubious advantage of rockets is that recovery of our picosatellites is easy—
there isn’t any recovery, they burn up on reentry.
Even before we get to testing your entire satellite, though, we must first test 
each piece as it is being built. There are two categories of problems you will 
run into while testing: component failure and integration issues. Compo-
nent failure means that a given component or board simply does not work. 
It could have a bad part, an error in assembly, or an incorrect design. What-
ever, it just doesn’t work. Integration failure, in contrast, is when two work-
ing parts do not work when put together.
Integration errors are the more frustrating part, because they can be hard-
er to isolate and diagnose. Therefore, you want to test each individual part in 
isolation before you put the parts together.
Imagine that you bought a new PC and you hook up the computer to a mon-
itor, keyboard, and mouse—and the darn thing shows a blank screen. As a 
system, you have very little information other than “it doesn’t work”. The first 
thing most technical people do is try to isolate the problem. Is the monitor 
on and working? Does the keyboard and mouse work on a different PC? Is 
the computer powering on? Does it work with a different monitor? In es-
sence, you are testing each component to determine, isolate, and localize 
the failure. With that, you know which one part to repair or replace.
Since you are building everything one piece at a time, you can save yourself 
many “it doesn’t work when put together” problems by testing each piece 
before you marry it to another. In isolation means you test that piece on its 
own, using whatever power or computer or network connections it may re-
quire to operate. For example, testing the communications radio in isola-
tion means you hook up your satellite radio board to a spare battery and a 
temporary antenna and see if it sends and receives signals. You can use any 
signal generator or a PC or an Arduino board or a BasicX-25 board or any 
Good Test Procedures 71

similar tool to handle the inputs and outputs. Only after you have tested the 
comm unit in isolation, to ensure it works, do you marry it to your actual flight 
CPU for further testing. This way, any problems in one unit are easily diag-
nosed.
Suggested Build-and-Test Schedule for 
a Typical Picosatellite
• Power bus (using a rechargable battery)
• Solar cells (isolated test)
• Solar cells + power bus to ensure the solar cells can charge the battery 
(then put aside the solar cells for now, as they are fragile)
• Communications (radio) as a stand-alone unit, using a temporary an-
tenna
• Communications using the power bus
• Communications using the flight antenna (then put the antenna away 
for now, as it is a speciality part)
• Controller/CPU in isolation
• Controller/CPU using power bus
• Controller/CPU and communications together using power bus
• Sensors and instruments and other payloads in isolation
• Sensors and instruments and other payloads using power bus
• Sensors and instruments and other payloads using power bus and CPU
• Sensors and instruments and other payloads using power bus and CPU 
and communications
• Sensors and instruments and other payloads using power bus and CPU 
and communications while housed in your satellite skeleton
At the end of all of this, you have a satellite!
Defects
Defects can exist because:
1. You ran into a bad commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) part. Swap it and 
move on.
2. A COTS part failed due to bad tolerances or an incorrect choice of a COTS 
part (tolerances not sufficient for operations in space). This is partially 
72 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

a design issue; a part rated at +/-10% might have worse performance in 
space or at temperature extremes, or the given part is not rated to the 
temperature range expected in space so you need to choose an alter-
native part with better tolerances.
3. Failure in assembling your board (such as a bad soldering joint). Rebuild 
and retest.
4. Design failure (as built, the board fails in space due to a fundamental 
issue). Tricky. Design failures are the worst because you have to go all 
the way back to your pre-build stage and do the entire process over 
again.
Frame Testing
Mount the components into the satellite skeleton and ensure they still work. 
Yes, we are suggesting you not put the boards into your pretty CubeSat or 
TubeSat frame until they all work. This saves wear and tear on the mount-
ing hardware. If all your components work when put together on your lab 
bench, odds are good you only have to put them into your satellite skeleton 
once. On the other hand, if you try to keep installing the boards into your 
skeleton before testing them solo, you may end up screwing and unscrew-
ing the pieces so often your screws and screw holes and mounting hard-
ware begins to get worn. Worn hardware will fail launch testing. So remember
—test in isolation, test together, then test as a satellite.
Alternately, if you have more than one skeleton (as with both the CubeSat 
and TubeSat examples here), by all means feel free to use one skeleton as a 
test rig and keep a second, pristine skeleton for your final assembly. Even in 
this case, I recommend you do as little mechnical assembly as possible un-
til all the parts are tested.
Rocket science, in the end, is more about risks than easy answers.
Clean Rooms
A clean room refers to a room that is clean, usually kept that way by having 
filtered air pumped in and maintaining positive pressure so no other out-
side air can enter. Clean rooms can fit a satellite and the team needed to build 
it (Figure 8-1), but for picosatellite work, we have to aim smaller.
My clean storage device of choice is a rolling trunk (Figure 8-2), and I’ll ad-
mit it’s not the most exciting science prop. But there are four important 
details that make this an important detail in DIY satellite building.
Good Test Procedures 73

nants is a positive step.
74 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

Pragmatics 
I need a place to store the satellite and components when I’m not work-
ing on it.
Conveyance 
I need something to lug the kit around when I take it over to my friend’s 
workshop, when we eventually get to final assembly.
Promotion 
I need to be able to lug the satellite (or flight spare) to classrooms when 
I talk to K12 students about cool rocket science. The wheels are a cru-
cial help here.
Cats 
Notice the blur of the fast-moving cat to the left of the rolling trunk? Yes, 
we have a cat infestation problem in our house.
Back when I worked at Naval Research Lab, we had cats—strays that roamed 
the garages and underbrush around the facility. But we never had cats in-
doors, and certainly did not have cats in our assembly rooms and labs.
But being stuck with a home lab means I must somehow ensure the cats 
don’t mess up the satellite. I’ve declared our cat-free guest room as my lab, 
so I’m not worried about cats knocking stuff down or—worse—rewriting then 
recompiling the sensors code. No, my worry is fur.
I want my picosatellite to be the first musical satellite, not the first fur-covered 
non-functioning cat satellite. This means I have to set up a clean room. A 
clean room in rocket parlance is exactly what it sounds like—a very clean 
room. Typically, this means taking a room that is spic-and-span, and creat-
ing positive pressure. You make sure that clean air is being pumped into the 
room, and rely on the fact that the air has to leave as your way of keeping 
dust out.
A common setup is to run powerful intake fans that are well filtered, so they 
pump and filter lots of outside air in. You surround it with plastic curtains, so 
the air can escape, and rely on the mild wind (for want of a better term) to 
ensure no outside dust enters.
DIY Clean Room/Box
For bonus points, you can make the scientists wear bunny suits—that’s the 
actual name of the white cleanroom outfits. There are varying degrees of 
clean room standards. A large clean room can be built using the “DIY Clean 
Room” instructions at the fine http://instructables.com site. For our work, 
we aren’t doing fine optics or detectors with a high contamination risk, so we 
need only a moderate system.
Over at Make, they have something more my speed (http://
blog.makezine.com/2006/10/how_to_make_clean_box_low/)—a 
Good Test Procedures 75

homemade clean, err…clean box. It’s really more my speed. It’s just what it 
looks like—a plastic tub covered in transparent plastic, with little rubber 
gloves inside that you access from holes on the outside. But even that may 
be overkill for our picosatellite, because, again, we have no optics, sensitive 
electronics, or other easily contaminated items.
In previous NASA missions, I’ve seen—on rare occasion—flight hardware 
sitting in the middle of dusty labs. Most hardware is fine that way, because 
most of it is a big hunk of metal. The only time for clean rooms is final as-
sembly, when you put in the sensitive optics. You do vacuum tests later, and 
outgassing usually removes most contaminants. Vibration testing, likewise. 
Wrap it up and you’re done.
Cleanliness is a progression, not an absolute from square one. So first I’ll just 
be in a clean, cat-free room. Later, I’ll use the trunk to transport to the met-
al shop. Then back to the lab. I’ll be building a vacuum chamber and vibra-
tion rig for testing. After that, I will transfer it to a sealed bag for final ship-
ment. The result will be a clean, but not ultra-clean, functional satellite.
Someday, you picosatellite builders may get to work on a major project, such 
as shown in this panorama of the JWST being assembled in the world’s larg-
est clean room (Figure 8-3). Note the engineers in bunny suits at the far 
corner.

The Money Build
There exists an industry of pre-made satellite boards. Much as you can as-
semble Lego Mindstorm or other kits of parts to build a robot as purely an 
integration exercise, so it is with Cubesats. You can buy, mix, and match. This 
leads to the existence of the “money build”, where the do it yourself aspect 
is lessened and the kit-bashing operation of buying pre-made components 
and entire satellite subsystems is maximized. In short, you’re spending 
money to avoid building things yourself.
76 Surviving Orbit the DIY Way

The question this raises is why you are building and launching a satellite. 
There are many reasons (covered in the previous book, DIY Satellite Plat-
forms), but from a construction point of view, we can break this into two 
reasons. You either want to learn to build satellites or you don’t care about 
the satellite bus, just the payload.
Using an existing set of boards will teach you how satellites work. Likewise, 
making satellite boards from any of the various levels of from scratch is fine, 
whether that means designing your own circuits, fabricating using existing 
schematics, or buying pre-made kits. It’s all relevant experience and you get 
to choose how deep you want to delve.
I’ll argue a money build is an excellent exercise. There are three reasons not 
to just buy pre-fabricated parts. The first is that you want detailed experi-
ence in electrical engineering or satellite electronics concepts, those skills 
you only get by building from scratch. Bear in mind that everyone has a 
different level of from scratch. For some people, integrating existing boards 
is a sufficient design challenge. Other people would be satisfied with noth-
ing less than creating your own schematics (no pre-existing circuit board 
layouts!) and then using only a rocket you engineered yourself. Anything in 
between is up to you—DIY means you get to choose your own path.
The second reason you may not want to use pre-fab components is that you 
want to build a satellite to do or test something for which a pre-fabricated 
board does not exist. In that case, you have the option of using pre-fab for 
standard components (radio, say) and focusing your design skills on the 
novel parts.
The third and most common option not to use pre-fab components is cost. 
At $2K-$8K per board, you can easily spend $50K on your satellite build. 
Adding to this, if you want to do a series of satellites (each advancing on the 
previous design), each satellite will have that same base cost. Designing, 
fabricating, or assembling in-house, by contrast, gives you a lower cost-per-
satellite simply because it’s not significantly more work to create four 
assembly-line style boards than it is to solder up your first, so you gain econ-
omy of scale.
My recommendation is not to be motivated by ego (“must do it all solo”) and 
instead approach it from a systems engineering perspective. Using pre-fab 
pieces reduces risk because they are tested and proven solutions, but in-
creases material cost. Pre-fab parts will likely reduce your labor costs—re-
duce the time it’ll take you to build. Factor in how much you value your time 
and what aspects of the project are most enjoyable or educational for you, 
they balance the key trade-off of cost versus risk and cost versus time.
In my thoughts, you’re as authentic a DIY satellite builder whether you slap-
ped together CubeSatShop components to fly a Sputnik-type signaler, or 
smelted your own copper to build your own circuits. The DIY is “yourself” and 
your goals, no one else’s.
Good Test Procedures 77

When to Commit
I got into an argument with a NASA engineer over the use of clean rooms for 
picosatellites. His claim was that you cannot build a satellite outside of a clean 
room. My stance is that it is perfectly fine to build and test your picosatel-
lite in a typical air-conditioned sealed non-industrial lab. By non-industrial, I 
mean a lab set aside for the satellite work and not containing any machi-
nery that puts out smoke, oil, or metal shavings. No building your satellite in 
a metal shop—build components there, clean them, then bring them to 
your (reasonably) clean lab bench.
Although I did not build hardware for the NASA missions under which I hel-
ped do science work, I did get to see some of the flight hardware and flight 
spares. For a small mission in the early stages, due to pragmatics you will 
often assemble them in a lab. You are trading off the cost and speed advan-
tages of using an ordinary lab, against the necessary fidelity of the instru-
ment. Under this, your need for clean room assembly is partially driven by 
the quality and complexity of your design.
If you are creating James Webb Space Telescope-level mirrors at a cost of 
many millions of dollars, you are justified in also building the world’s larg-
est clean room to assemble these. These are extremely large yet extremely 
high quality optics. However, if you are building a 6cm x 6cm x 6cm satel-
lite to prototype a new controller chip or set of store-bought components, 
your requirements can relax the clean room standards to using just, well, a 
room that is clean (as opposed to a vented positive-pressure clean room).
Either way, at a certain point you need to shift from your lab/bench world to 
the pristine environment of pre-launch. A picosatellite is supposed to be 
developed on a short timescale using simple tools. As one builder put, if 
you’re spending five years and hundreds of thousands of dollars on your 
picosatellite, you’re doing it wrong. But with a bit of boldness and a strong 
do-it-yourself spirit, you can be flying (Figure 8-4) your own picosatellites 
“the maker way”.

upon realizing the desire to understand the universe doesn't mean you have 
to be the one to discover everything personally. There's a lot of excellent 
science out there, and Sandy enjoys bringing it to the world's attention. 
Sandy recently achieved a professorship at Capitol College's Astronautical 
Engineering department, which he credits to his NASA work, his solo build 
of the Project Calliope picosatellite, and his writing for Science 2.0 and via 
O'Reilly Media.
Surviving Orbit the DIY Way is the second book in the four-book DIY Satel-
lite series. The first, DIY Satellite Platforms, covers the basics in designing 
and building your own satellite. Book 3 will be on instruments and science 
you can do with your own satellite, and Book 4 will provide how to commu-
nication with and operate your picosatellite once it is safely up in space.
