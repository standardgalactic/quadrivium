Chapter 1 
Introduction and Motivation 
The book begins with an introduction to research on High-Growth Firms and scale-
ups, focusing on the development of the literature, and observing that early work on 
scale-ups focused on anecdotal evidence and case studies. In contrast, this book seeks 
to develop a rigorous and general deﬁnition of scale-ups that is amenable to being 
applied to datasets of ﬁrm populations from different countries and time periods. 
1.1 
Introduction 
Scale-ups have received an almost mythical status, following on from the rapid 
growth and phenomenal proﬁts of a handful of extremely successful ﬁrms such as 
Facebook, LinkedIn, Tesla, AirBnB, Uber, and so on. Mystery surrounds these ﬁrms, 
in terms of the secrets of their extraordinary dynamics, as well as their true nature. 
Indeed, we are not fully aware of how common scale-ups actually are, because there is 
still no agreed-upon empirical deﬁnition that allows us to identify and count scale-ups 
in the business population. 
Scale-ups are an elite few. Most ﬁrms do not grow at all, while a small number 
enjoy very high growth rates. These fast-growing ﬁrms have received considerable 
attention in the entrepreneurship literature (Coad et al., 2014; Demir et al., 2017), and 
are labeled gazelles, high-growth ﬁrms (HGFs), and high-impact ﬁrms. Other terms 
include unicorns (and decacorns), which are private ventures with a valuation of at 
least $1 billion (and $10 billion, respectively) (Kuratko et al., 2020). More recently, 
an emerging body of work focuses on scale-ups. While scale-ups are argued to be of 
great economic and theoretical relevance (Autio et al., 2018; Monaghan et al., 2020), 
there seems to be a lack of a common understanding of what constitutes a scale-up 
and how it differs from an HGF. 
Is it worth adding a new category of rapid growth ﬁrms (i.e. scale-ups) to the 
lexicon? Amid the excitement about scale-ups, there is also much confusion, with

Introduction and Motivation
different (and sometimes conﬂicting) ideas emerging from different sources. A 
number of recent publications from academic scholars (e.g. DeSantola and Gulati, 
2017; Giustiziero et al., 2023) and international organizations (e.g. OECD, 2021; 
Vandresse et al., 2023) focus on scale-ups as an important new category of dynamic 
ﬁrms, emphasizing that scaling up is something distinct from growth, and that scale-
ups are not just high-growth ﬁrms, while at the same time containing empirical 
analysis that deﬁnes scale-ups in exactly the same way as one deﬁnes high-growth 
ﬁrms (e.g. Belitski et al., 2023; OECD, 2021, p. 42). It seems somewhat incoherent 
to claim that scale-ups are different from HGFs, while at the same time deﬁning 
scale-ups in terms of HGFs. 
Another problem is that the literature contains various deﬁnitions of scale-ups, 
which is problematic for empirical measurement, knowledge accumulation, compar-
ison across countries and over time; leading to problems in developing a generalizable 
theory (Lee and Kim, 2023; Vandresse et al., 2023). This book seeks to clarify the 
confusion in the area, taking the space granted to book-length publications to enter 
into the required detail to give a deeper and multifaceted understanding of the term 
scale-up, as well as a practical discussion regarding how scale-ups can be measured 
in empirical analysis. 
1.2 
Early Work Focused on Anecdotes and Case Studies 
The literature has identiﬁed several case studies of successful scale-ups (e.g. Uber 
[Pfotenhauer et al., 2022], PayPal, Facebook, Tesla, and LinkedIn [Hoffman and 
Yeh, 2018], and many more) that have been useful in introducing the phenomenon, 
showing that some ﬁrms grow by a process of “scaling up” that differs from normal 
growth. However, it is not clear whether these case studies are outliers or representa-
tive of average ﬁrms (Tippmann et al., 2023). For example, are all ﬁrms that attempt 
scaling-up successful, or are failure rates higher for scale-ups? Is a dead scale-up 
a scale-up, in the same sense that a dead lion is a lion?1 If a scale-up were never 
proﬁtable, should we still call it a scale-up?2 
The questions above suggests that it is necessary to move to the next stage of 
empirical analysis of the phenomenon of scale-ups, i.e. from case studies and anec-
dotes to analysis of large sample representative panel datasets through “new large-
sample quantitative studies” (DeSantola and Gulati, 2017, p. 656) that can investigate
1 In our view, a dead scale-up would only be considered to be a scale-up if it satisﬁed various 
conditions, including the condition that it grew sufﬁciently fast over a three-year period to ﬁnd 
itself in the set of HGFs. A potential scale-up or a baby scale-up would therefore not be a scale-up. 
A ﬁrm that grows fast but never becomes proﬁtable could be a scale-up, however (as discussed 
later). 
2 Growth via scaling up should theoretically be proﬁtable, because revenues grow rapidly while 
variable costs are low (although ﬁxed costs are high and may increase as production processes invest 
heavily in intangibles; De Ridder, 2023). However, an unproﬁtable ﬁrm may still be classiﬁed as a 
scale-up as long as it satisﬁes our empirical deﬁnition presented in Chap. 6. 

1.4 Why a Book on Scale-Ups?

issues such as survivor bias and selection bias, as well as showing population-level 
proportions and tracking the development of scale-ups over time. 
Hence, although the methodology of scale-up research has generally been a discus-
sion of cases (Ries, 2011; Hoffman and Yeh, 2018; Kuratko et al., 2020; Reuber et al., 
2021), there is growing interest in investigations of proportions of scale-ups in large 
samples (OECD, 2021). This book seeks to help the transition from the former to 
the latter. Now that the term “scale-up” is entering into empirical investigations and 
policy discussions, it is time for a precise deﬁnition. Academics need to move on 
from the way of thinking that might be caricatured as follows: “on the one hand this 
ﬁrm is a scale-up, and on the other hand it isn’t a scale-up.” Saying that a ﬁrm is 
“somewhat like a scale-up” is not helpful for the emerging body of empirical analysis 
that needs a binary variable to classify ﬁrms into scale-ups vs non-scale-ups. Policy 
often draws on such empirical analysis to consider questions such as the following: 
are scale-ups valuable? What are the characteristics of scale-ups? Are they ﬁnan-
cially constrained? How should policy help them? As such, this book addresses the 
need for a clear binary deﬁnition of what a scale-up is. 
1.3 
Scope of the Book 
There is some debate about whether scaling-up occurs at the level of ﬁrms, or whether 
it can also occur at other levels, such as the levels of initiatives within ﬁrms (Tipp-
mann et al., 2023) or at the product-level (e.g. the scaling-up of the iPhone, Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018), or at the level of ecosystems that include ﬁrms (Tippmann et al., 
2023). This book focuses on the ﬁrm level. To the extent that scale-up ﬁrms are hyper-
specialized single-product ﬁrms (Giustiziero et al., 2023), the distinction between 
ﬁrm-level and product-level disappears. Our focus is on the ﬁrm-level because (as 
with HGFs) this is the level at which SME and entrepreneurship policy focuses (e.g. 
OECD, 2021). 
1.4 
Why a Book on Scale-Ups? 
Given the apparent confusion in this area, it seems worth having a book-length 
(rather than article-length) discussion of the matter. We draw upon various literatures 
(practitioners, policy literature from countries and international organizations, and of 
course academics) and various academic disciplines (entrepreneurship, international 
business, strategic management, economics) and various theoretical concepts (such 
as stages of growth models, ﬁxed vs marginal costs, intangible capital, network 
externalities affecting consumer demand) to explain in what ways scale-ups are 
theoretically different from HGFs. We then discuss how a scale-up deﬁnition can 
be operationalized empirically as the literature matures, moving from anecdotes to 
large-sample analysis.

Introduction and Motivation
It would arguably not be possible to discuss the many facets in a journal article 
format. Journal articles must be concise, to the point that they must abandon descrip-
tive approaches in the struggle to emphasize their novel contributions. (Furthermore, 
it is often faster to publish a ﬁrst draft of a book manuscript than the ﬁrst draft of a 
journal article.) Given that considerable confusion remains regarding what a scale-up 
is, and how scale-ups should be deﬁned (both in terms of theoretical concepts and 
in terms of deﬁning scale-ups in terms of the variables usually observed in standard 
datasets), there seems to be a genuine need for this short book. 
1.5 
Overview of This Book 
Chapter 2 contextualizes the literature on scale-ups by discussing the related literature 
on High-Growth Firms (HGFs). Chapter 3 discusses stages of growth models, a 
strand of literature that, despite risking oversimpliﬁcation, gives a theoretical model 
of the stages through which growth unfolds. Scaling up is presented as a relatively 
advanced stage in the development of a new venture after it has overcome hurdles 
related to product design, development, and product-market ﬁt. Chapter 4 contains 
eight propositions about scale-ups, building up towards the theoretical deﬁnition in 
Chap. 5, and the empirical deﬁnition in Chap. 6. Given that many of the concepts 
and ideas used in the theoretical deﬁnition do not correspond closely to the variables 
found in standard datasets, there is a difference between our theoretical deﬁnition 
(Chap. 5) and our empirical deﬁnition (Chap. 6). Chapter 7 contains some preliminary 
explorations of measuring scale-ups using Swedish data. Finally, Chap. 8 concludes.

Firm Growth, and High-Growth Firms 
This chapter discusses previous research into ﬁrm growth. In particular, Eurostat 
and the OECD proposed an indicator of High-Growth Firms in 2007 that has helped 
develop the ﬁeld of HGF research, because having a standardized HGF deﬁnition 
fostered comparisons of research ﬁndings and cumulativeness of knowledge. 
2.1 
Introduction 
Since decades, there has been a keen interest in measuring ﬁrm growth. A main reason 
for this was due to popular interest in job creation. Pioneering work by David Birch 
(Birch, 1979) investigated the dynamics of employment growth by entrepreneurial 
ﬁrms. An important contribution of David Birch was moving beyond anecdotal cases 
to focus on large-sample datasets thereby gaining a representative view of job creation 
by SMEs. In particular, it was his ﬁnding that a small number of ﬁrms create a 
disproportionately large number of jobs, that led him to introduce the term “gazelles” 
to describe high-growth ﬁrms. Since Birch (1979), the literature on HGFs has been 
further developed and standardized such that major statistical ofﬁces (e.g. Eurostat 
and the OECD) collect data on HGF shares in regions and countries over time. 
2.2 
Empirical Deﬁnition of Firm Size and Firm Growth 
A ﬁrst challenge for empirical work on ﬁrm growth is to decide upon how to measure 
growth. This task is not necessarily as simple as it sounds. For example, according 
to an indicator based on a layman’s understanding of growth rates, when a ﬁrm with 
100 employees that grows by 50% and then declines by 50% will not actually end up

back where it started (100 employees) but will end up with 75 employees.1 Tornqvist 
et al. (1985) discuss the various ways in which growth rates can be measured, and 
discuss the desirable statistical properties of growth rates indicators, and conclude 
by recommending that growth rates should be measured in terms of log-differences:

For ﬁrm i at time t. Firm size is measured in terms of variable X, which usually corre-
sponds for total sales or employment, although other size indicators are sometimes 
used (such as value added or total assets).2 
Research on ﬁrm growth has generally measured growth on an annual basis (Coad, 
2009). Measuring growth over a period shorter than one year leads to problems due to 
within-the-year seasonality and is also difﬁcult given that ﬁrm-level data are usually 
reported at annual intervals in most datasets. 
Measuring growth over a period longer than one year has the advantage that 
random ﬂuctuations might become smoothed out, thus reducing the role of statistical 
noise and boosting the signal-to-noise ratio. However, measuring growth over a 
longer period results in fewer observations in the dataset, and many ﬁrms that do not 
survive until the end of the growth period are then not observed. Given this tradeoff, 
the standardized deﬁnition of HGFs focuses on growth over a period of three years 
(Eurostat-OECD, 2007). 
2.3 
High-Growth Firms: The Eurostat-OECD (2007) 
Deﬁnition 
Eurostat-OECD (2007) propose a binary variable for HGFs, which is equal to one 
for ﬁrms that have at least 10 employees in the initial period and a geometric average 
of at least 20% growth per year over a three-year period.

per E Sub
script t equals 0 Baseline greater than or equals 10
where uper E Subscript t is the number of employees at time t, and uper S Subscript t is an indicator of ﬁrm size 
(which can be either sales or employees). This HGF indicator has been applied by 
many researchers in academic and policy publications (Henrekson and Johansson,
1 The ﬁrm that starts with 100 employees has 150 employees after growing 50%, and only 75 
employees after declining 50%. 
2 Daunfeldt et al. (2014) provides an overview of growth indicators used to deﬁne HGFs in the 
literature.

Benedetti Fasil et al., 2021), and is generally seen as the standard deﬁnition of HGF. 
Having a standardized HGF indicator has several beneﬁts. It means that HGF-
shares can be compared across countries and industries over different time periods. 
Econometric results can thus become comparable across studies, leading to a shared 
understanding between researchers, cumulativeness of knowledge, and meaningful 
theory-building. 
However, the Eurostat-OECD HGF indicator is not without drawbacks, two of 
which are mentioned here. First, an issue with this HGF indicator is that micro ﬁrms 
(fewer than 10 employees at the start) are excluded from the analysis (Daunfeldt 
et al., 2015). These ﬁrms constitute a lion’s share of all jobs created in the economy. 
This latter concern can be addressed by using a modiﬁed HGF indicator that includes 
micro ﬁrms. One way of doing this is as follows. Recall that a ﬁrm starting with 10 
employees must grow by at least 8 employees to qualify as an HGF; we can apply 
this same growth amount to consider that any ﬁrm with fewer than 10 employees at 
start must grow by at least 8 employees if it should be counted as an HGF (Coad and 
Srhoj, 2020). For example, a ﬁrm with 2 employees at start can become an HGF if 
it grows to 2 + 8 = 10 employees after the three-year period. 
Second, requiring that HGFs grow by 20% on average each year can result in 
a small number of HGFs in the dataset. As such, there has been a recent shift to 
complement results from a 20% growth threshold with results from a 10% threshold 
for average annual growth when measuring HGFs (e.g. Flachenecker et al., 2020; 
OECD, 2021; Benedetti Fasil et al., 2021) to avoid the statistical problems of having 
too few observations in the HGF = 1 category.3 Interestingly, scale-up authors have 
sometimes taken a different view, arguing that the 20% threshold is too low. Reuber 
et al. (2021, p. 1033) explain that “it is not unusual for globally scaling ﬁrms to 
exceed a 40% compound annual growth rate.” Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 46) even 
state that “[d]ropping below even 40% annual growth is a warning sign for investors.” 
To conclude, this chapter introduced a quantitative indicator of ﬁrm growth, the 
HGF deﬁnition. Note that no attention is given to how a ﬁrm achieves its growth. A 
fuller consideration of the style of growth is the topic of the next chapter, on stages 
of growth models.

Stages of Growth Models 
Stages of growth models are important for understanding scale-ups. One of the 
differences between scale-ups and HGFs is that research on HGFs does not take 
growth stages into account, as long as growth is fast enough. This chapter presents 
Steve Blank’s 4-stage model of ﬁrm growth, where scaling up is stage 3. Hence, 
scaling-up does not occur directly at birth, among the youngest ﬁrms, but preparation 
is needed before scaling up. Differences between scaling up and so-called blitz-
scaling are also discussed. 
3.1 
Stages of Growth Models and Their Discontents 
Young ﬁrms go through considerable metamorphosis as they grow to become large 
mature organizations. Researchers have investigated the idea that ﬁrm growth unfolds 
according to a set of pre-determined stages. Prominent in this strand of literature 
is Greiner (1998; ﬁrst published in 1972). Greiner’s model starts with the case of 
an entrepreneurial young venture in which employees enjoy frequent and informal 
communication with the founding entrepreneur(s), known as the creativity stage. 
Then, after a crisis of leadership, a capable business manager is hired and business 
processes become more professionalized. Then, after a crisis of autonomy, the ﬁrm 
enjoys a period of growth through delegation, as the organizational structure becomes 
decentralized, and managers and employees are motivated by greater responsibility 
and ﬁnancial incentives. The next stage emphasizes coordination through the use of 
formal systems such as planning systems and control & review procedures. Finally, 
the ﬁfth stage prioritizes interpersonal collaboration and team action as a counter-
reaction to perceptions of excessive bureaucratic red tape. Besides Greiner’s model, 
other stages of growth models have also been proposed. 
Stages of growth models have been investigated in empirical research. When 
submitted to rigorous analysis, stages of growth models do not give precise guidance

Stages of Growth Models
for the real-world growth process because ﬁrms may pass through the stages in 
different orders, or keep facing the same problems many times, or perhaps even 
entirely skip some stages (Levie and Lichtenstein, 2010). As such, stages of growth 
models can give a useful rough idea of the types of challenges faced by growing 
ﬁrms, but they should not be taken too literally. 
3.2 
Scaling up as a Stage of Growth 
At a basic level, the idea of two stages in the ﬁrm’s life course is implied by slogans 
such as “from startup to scaleup” (Duruﬂé et al., 2017; Reypens et al., 2020; Vandresse 
et al., 2023) and “nail it then scale it” (Furr and Ahlstrom, 2011). Subsequent authors 
went beyond two stages, e.g. Piaskowska et al. (2021, p. 1): “we propose to deﬁne 
scale-ups as high-growth ﬁrms at an intermediate stage of organizational develop-
ment (situated between the start-up and mature ﬁrm stage in the organizational life 
cycle), which pursue strategies that prioritize the attainment of economies of scale.” 
As such, the timing of scaling up is important (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018; Lee  
and Kim, 2023). Scaling-up is not something that ﬁrms should do from day 1, and 
scaling up is not something that ﬁrms should always be doing. Instead, scaling up is 
recommended only when “the time is right” (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 121) and 
conditions are favorable, i.e. when initial product development and testing stages are 
ﬁnished, when a product-market ﬁt has been found, and the core business idea is 
sufﬁciently developed that it can be replicated at scale: “Scale-up is a stage when a 
company takes a proven concept and delivers it to a wider audience, often through 
market penetration and geographic expansion” (Hellmann and Kavadias, 2016, cited 
in Coviello, 2019, emphasis ours). 
Similar in spirit, Contigiani and Levinthal (2019, p. 554) link scaling-up to the 
stages of a lean start-up approach: 
Speciﬁcally, the lean start-up approach explicitly distinguishes between a learning intensive 
phase, where the venture looks for product market ﬁt, and a scaling phase, following the 
achievement of product market ﬁt … the emphasis on self-conscious, dedicated effort on 
experimentation is speciﬁc to the ﬁrst phase, while the leveraging of the learning obtained 
is central in the second phase. 
In this vein, Sutton and Rao (2016, p. 269) warn against ‘premature scaling’ 
which involves adding employees before they are needed. “Hiring too many people 
too soon burns through cash, creates unnecessary administrative burdens, undermines 
innovation, and causes companies to focus on landing customers before they have 
anything worthwhile to sell them.” 
Figure 3.1 shows the “stages of growth” model put forward by Blank (2013), 
which helps illustrate the idea of scaling up.
With stages of growth models, it is easy to get an impression of the intuition behind 
this broad heuristic, although such an impression is vague and becomes difﬁcult to 
empirically deﬁne when one starts to examine the details. This means that being a

scale-up is not a stable trait of a ﬁrm, or a stable category of ﬁrms, but a short-lived 
episode. Furthermore, we can expect all the usual problems of “stages of growth” 
models (Levie and Lichtenstein, 2010), including that stages may not appear in order, 
ﬁrms may enter the various stages more than once, or perhaps in parallel, or perhaps 
not at all. In particular, many (probably most) ﬁrms will never be in a position where 
scaling up would be appropriate, if for example their core business idea has not 
achieved remarkable product-market ﬁt that makes it amenable to massive growth in 
circumstances of near-zero marginal costs of production and distribution (Masters 
and Thiel, 2014). While stages of growth models may be useful heuristic tools to 
form an initial rough impression, they become increasingly unhelpful if one takes 
them too seriously (Coad, 2009; Levie and Lichtenstein, 2010).

Stages of Growth Models
3.3 
Changes in the Structure of Growing Firms 
Firm growth is not a homogenous quantity, there are different ways in which ﬁrms 
can grow. This leads to interest in “how” ﬁrms grow, as opposed to just “how much” 
ﬁrms grow (McKelvie and Wiklund, 2010). An analogy from humans would be that 
we can grow in terms of bone mass, in terms of muscle mass, or in terms of fat, or 
any combination of these. For an athletics trainer, there is a big difference if a 3 kg 
weight gain comes from gaining fat, gaining muscle, or becoming pregnant. Scaling 
up does not correspond to all possible kinds of growth, but a very speciﬁc type of 
growth. This is why we are unconvinced by attempts to deﬁne scale-ups exclusively 
in terms of growth amount (e.g. Belitski et al., 2023; Denney et al., 2023; OECD, 
2021). Instead, we think it is important to deﬁne scale-ups in terms of how they grow: 
a key role of up-front costs, intangible assets, marketing investments; a growth that 
involves near-zero marginal costs, as well as a growth style that corresponds to a 
shift from iteration and pivoting to a standardized product prototype and business 
model that is ready to be scaled up. 
Scaling up is a supply-side push. Uncertainty surrounding the product offering 
has been substantially removed because of the emergence of a satisfactory product. 
The demand conditions for the product are favorable (e.g. if demand is characterized 
by increasing returns and network externalities, Giustiziero et al., 2023), now that 
product-market ﬁt has been achieved between what customers seek and what the 
reﬁned product offers. 
3.4 
Born Scale-ups? 
The literature on entrepreneurship and international business has expressed interest 
in the phenomenon of ‘born globals’—ﬁrms that internationalize from an early age. 
Is there such a thing as ‘born scale-ups’? Can some ﬁrms start scaling right from 
birth? 
In the light of the stages-of-growth perspective, it becomes clear why we consider 
that scale-ups are young but not too young. Scaling up is not the ﬁrst stage in a 
stages-of-growth model, but the third (see Fig. 3.1). Hence, the probability of being 
a scale-up is not necessarily the highest at birth. While relatively young, scale-ups 
cannot correspond to the youngest group of ﬁrms because of the preparatory stages 
they need to ﬁnish before starting to scale. A “born scaler” probably is just a case 
where the early stages of pivoting and search have not been recorded properly (e.g. 
occurring in stealth mode while working for a previous employer) such that the 
ofﬁcially registered date of birth is mismeasured. 
Given that scaling up is a stage that takes place after birth, rather than at the time 
of birth, researchers are encouraged to investigate what happens in the stages before 
scaling up.

3.5 Can Scale-ups Have More Than One Product?
15
More attention is needed to understand what happens during the periods leading up to scaling 
and accelerated growth – what actions do ﬁrms take and what preparatory capabilities do 
they seek to cultivate to facilitate scaling? (Jansen et al., 2023, p. 15) 
Scaling up is the time for applying rather than the time for learning. Learning 
activity is concentrated in the stages preceding scaling; and the scaling stage is the 
time for applying the knowledge that has been so far accumulated. Nevertheless, 
scaling that involves growth into international markets might need some learning 
and adapting to local markets characteristics (Tippmann et al., 2023; Jansen et al., 
2023), even for ﬁrms in the scale-up stage. Hence, while saying that most learning/ 
development/adaptation happens before the scale-up stage (Blank, 2013), never-
theless there is still the need for some learning to take place during scaling. Such 
learning that occurs during scaling could refer to learning about customer needs in 
new markets, as opposed to learning how to reﬁne the basic features of the product 
such that the product’s performance increases. 
3.5 
Can Scale-ups Have More Than One Product? 
Scale-up is generally considered to be a single-minded focus on delivering an inno-
vative new product or service. The literature has discussed whether multi-product 
ﬁrms can become scale-ups (e.g. Giustiziero et al., 2023; Jansen et al., 2023). The 
scaling-up of multi-product ﬁrms is unlikely because it would draw away resources 
from other products, even if it does not lead to cannibalization. Practitioners have 
stated that scaling-up that involves multiple products is particularly complicated.1 
Also, empirical analysis might ﬁnd it difﬁcult to detect this scaling up if the overall 
scaling event is “diluted” and hidden when looking at aggregated data (i.e. aggregated 
across products up to the ﬁrm level). 
In our deﬁnition (shown later), a scale-up must have annual growth of 20% on 
average at the ﬁrm-level (not just at the product level), and multiproduct ﬁrms with 
fast-growing products might struggle to reach this threshold when their growth is 
considered at the ﬁrm-level. Nevertheless, a multi-product ﬁrm could be a scale-up: 
either if one product is growing very fast (e.g. Apple at the time of surging iPhone 
sales (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018), or in the case where multiple products are being 
driven by a single scalable technology or capability (c.f. Braguinsky et al., 2021; 
Srhoj et al., 2022). Therefore, multi-product ﬁrms can potentially be scale-ups, as 
long as they satisfy the empirical requirements. However, as discussed before, our 
focus is on the ﬁrm-level. This means that product-level scaling-up will only be

parts of scaling” Mariam Naﬁcy, founder and CEO of Minted (Gil, 2018, p. 160).

manifest in our scale-up indicator if the product’s growth has sufﬁcient effects at the 
aggregate ﬁrm-level to push the ﬁrm into the scale-up category.2

The stages-of-growth model in Fig. 3.1, based on principles of lean startup (Ries, 
2011; Blank, 2013) has been criticized by Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 75): “we’re 
huge fans of Eric Ries and his lean start-up methodology. It is an excellent process 
for systematically tackling risk. But the fact is that most start-ups don’t follow that 
process.” 
Speciﬁcally, the Blitz-scaling concept introduced by Hoffman and Yeh (2018) 
takes an even more extreme view on scaling: ﬁrms should start furiously scaling up 
even if they do not yet have a decent prototype: 
Starting a company is like jumping off a cliff and assembling an airplane on the way down. 
(Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 28) 
Instead of waiting to have developed a viable product, the recommendation to 
startups is to move fast, even to the point that entrepreneurs should “launch a product 
that embarrasses you” (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 206). This is because blitz-
scaling prioritizes speed over efﬁciency: no matter how many mistakes are made, the 
important thing is getting big fast, pre-empting the competition and accelerating the 
virtuous cycle of positive network externalities for a growing user base (Hoffman and 
Yeh, 2018, p. 5). A vivid illustration of the urgency of growth, even at the expense of 
efﬁciency, comes from a conversation between Reid Hoffman and PayPal co-founder 
Peter Thiel: 
Peter, if you and I were standing on the roof of our ofﬁce and throwing stacks of hundred-
dollar bills off the edge as fast as our arms could go, we still wouldn’t be losing money as 
quickly as we are right now. (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 43)3 
Fortunately, the blitz-scaling method worked well for Reid Hoffman and his 
ventures PayPal and LinkedIn. 
However, this extreme type of scaling (i.e. blitz-scaling) has been the subject of 
criticisms. O’Reilly (2019) writes that “blitzscaling is not really a recipe for success 
but rather survivorship bias masquerading as a strategy.” Lee and Kim (2023) provide 
evidence that scaling too early is generally more problematic than scaling too late, 
in their large-sample analysis of scaling up.
2 Authors interested in the phenomenon of scaling of products inside multiproduct ﬁrms may want 
to develop their own product-level indicator (such a task is beyond the scope of this book, but a 
useful starting point could be Baumgartner et al., 2023). 
3 The context behind this quote is that, during PayPal’s early days, the company was growing 5% 
per day, but losing money on transactions, because customers could use the service for free while 
paying with credit cards. As such, PayPal was absorbing the 3% credit charge processing fee, while 
charging users nothing.

Eight Propositions About Scale-ups 
This chapter pushes further in our investigation of the nature of scale-ups by intro-
ducing the following eight propositions about scale-ups: (1) a scale up is a concept 
born of practitioners, not academics; (2) scale-ups are not just in the IT sector, but 
may be enabled by IT; (3) a scale-up is a qualitative concept from a ‘stages-of-
growth’ model; (4) scaling up involves structural transformation; (5) a scale-up does 
not exist anywhere in a pure form; (6) scale-ups differ by degree, not by kind; (7) 
many scale-ups are exceptions; and (8) there may never be a standardized empirical 
deﬁnition of scale-up. Each of these eight propositions was either not clear, or was 
misunderstood, in some previous work. 
4.1 A Scale-up Is a Concept Born of Practitioners, Not 
Academics 
Scaling was a ‘hot topic’ in the practitioner literature for a long time, while being 
conspicuously absent in the academic literature (Shepherd and Patzelt, 2022; Jansen 
et al., 2023). The concept of scale-up is closely linked to the Silicon Valley venture 
capital scene. Scaling up concepts have long been analyzed by authors such as 
Steve Blank (2013), Furr and Ahlstrom (2011), and Eric Ries (2011) from the ‘Lean 
Startup’ movement, as well as Reid Hoffman, co-founder of PayPal and LinkedIn 
(Sullivan, 2016; Hoffman and Yeh, 2018; see also Kuratko et al., 2020), and Peter 
Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, and the ﬁrst outside investor in Facebook 
(Masters and Thiel, 2014), and also bloggers such as Paul Graham, co-founder of 
the startup accelerator Y-combinator (e.g. Graham, 2013). These authors went far 
beyond the conﬁnes of their ‘day jobs’ (i.e. investing and supporting startups) to 
develop concepts, share ideas (while sometimes respectfully disagreeing on some

points),1 and grow a community of rigorous thinking about the science behind new 
venture performance. For example, Graham’s 2013 blog post beneﬁtted from inter-
actions with peers including Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) and Patrick Collison 
(co-founder and CEO of Stripe). 
Scale-ups have also received attention from policymakers (e.g., OECD, 2021), 
with a number of policy reports and ‘grey literature’ focusing on the phenomenon 
of scale-ups (e.g. Coutu, 2014; Hellmann and Kavadias, 2016; Duruﬂé et al., 2017; 
Reypens et al., 2020; Vandresse et al., 2023). Meanwhile, it seems that academics 
are playing catch-up; still trying to determine what exactly a scale-up is and how 
to deﬁne it. Academics started exploring the concept of scaling-up starting with 
publications such as Sutton and Rao (2016) and DeSantola and Gulati (2017), and 
some recent journal special issues at the Journal of Management Studies (Jansen 
et al., 2023), Journal of Business Venturing (Autio et al., 2021) and Journal of World 
Business.2 These early academic publications did not give speciﬁc details regarding 
the deﬁnition and identiﬁcation of scale-ups, however: Sutton and Rao (2016) (as  
well as follow-up work by Shepherd and Patzelt, 2022) focus their discussion on 
the important topic of how to scale-up excellent practices throughout a growing 
organization, although they do not deﬁne a scale-up and some of their examples even 
seem to refer to ﬁrms that have not grown in a long time.3 Meanwhile, DeSantola 
and Gulati (2017) discuss the organizational transformations in growing ﬁrms at a 
relatively abstract theoretical level. 
4.2 Scale-ups Are Not Just in the IT Sector, But May Be 
Enabled by IT 
Scale-ups have repeatedly been linked to digitalization and the IT sector (Adner 
et al., 2019). “Software has a natural afﬁnity with blitzscaling, because the marginal 
costs of serving any size market are virtually zero” (Sullivan, 2016, p. 46). IT is a 
GPT (General Purpose Technology) that permeates all sectors and lowers the costs 
of scaling by reducing the costs of distribution, storage, processing and replication 
of data for a broad set of tasks in all sectors. Unlike physical assets, digital assets 
such as databases can be “reused, repackaged, and resold ad inﬁnitum” (Adner et al., 
2019, p. 257), such that data continue to provide value for a ﬁrm even if it has already 
been applied in different contexts. This can help ﬁrms to overcome the usual limits 
to growth (i.e. Penrose effects, Piaskowska et al., 2021, p. 5). The development of 
IT has also enabled the phenomenon of viral marketing, which is enabled by IT and

by Blank and Ries (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 75), and O’Reilly (2019) explains why he disagrees

social media, although the beneﬁts of viral marketing are not conﬁned to IT sectors 
but can beneﬁt all sectors. 
A ﬁrst implication of digitalization is that distribution costs become close to 
zero for digital goods and services such as Software-as-a-Service (Adobe), music 
(Spotify) and video (Netﬂix) (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). Distribution of goods via 
the internet gives a crushing advantage over distribution of physical goods via brick-
and-mortar outlets, as evidenced by the disruption of Blockbuster video by Netﬂix. 
A second implication is that products sold to customers over the internet (such as 
Software-as-a-Service) can be easily tweaked and updated (Nambisan et al., 2019). 
Software updates can be sent out to users that are implemented over an internet 
connection. An implication of this is that software products can be sold in an interim 
and incomplete condition, with the understanding that improvements will regularly 
be sent out to users to ensure that the security and performance of the software 
product are up-to-date. Software is clearly easier to update over an internet connection 
than hardware. This leads us to the 4th rule of blitz-scaling: “launch a product that 
embarrasses you” (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 206). Software companies can sell an 
embarrassingly bad version of their product as long as this can quickly be updated 
when the improved version is ready. Selling a premature and incomplete product 
could give software companies the edge they need, if they strive for a fast launch, pre-
empting the competition, and dominating the market as they beneﬁt from a virtuous 
cycle of positive demand-side network externalities (whereby new users prefer to 
join a network that already has a large number of established users, resulting in a 
situation whereby large increases in demand occur without much effort on the part 
of the producing ﬁrm (Mithani, 2023; Huang et al., 2017)). 
Launching an embarrassingly bad product has been attempted by producers of 
physical products, with less success. One example would be Jawbone, a producer of 
Bluetooth headsets (Kuratko et al., 2020). Jawbone launched an incomplete product 
with the hope that imperfections could be ﬁxed through software updates, although it 
transpired that the hardware itself also needed ﬁxing, leading to customer refunds and 
a spectacular drop from its previous unicorn status valuation. A second example of a 
scale-up built around a physical product could be Tesla Motors (Hoffman and Yeh, 
2018). Tesla sold the promise of Full Self Driving (FSD) mode that, when it became 
available, could be remotely retro-ﬁtted (like a software update) on pre-existing Tesla 
vehicles (Niedermeyer, 2019). Such promises have failed to materialize, however, 
potentially leading to legal and ﬁnancial liabilities.4 
Discussions of scaling seem to focus ﬁrst on prototypical examples of software/ 
IT ﬁrms, and then zoom out and concede that scaling-up also occurs in other sectors. 
While software-as-a-service seems particularly amenable to scaling-up (Nambisan 
et al., 2019), nevertheless any sector can have its scale-ups as long as it can accom-
modate ﬁrms with low marginal costs of scaling up their revenues (for example, via 
strategies of setting up their own platforms). Presumably if a scale-up exists in other 
sectors, it is likely that it is powered by IT capabilities in many cases, e.g. Uber in the 
taxi industry, Airbnb in the hotels industry, or the case of Copenhagen Seafood A/

S discussed in Nielsen and Lund (2018). It would be surprising indeed if a scale-up 
did not even have its own website. 
4.3 A Scale-up Is a Qualitative Concept from a “Stages 
of Growth” Model 
A scale-up is a qualitative concept that emerged from the “stages of growth” school 
of thought—as discussed above in Chap. 3.2. Understanding scale-up as a growth 
stage is important and helps us realize that not all ﬁrms are well-positioned to launch 
into scaling if the background conditions and preparatory work have not been satis-
factorily set up in place. Therefore, while scale-ups are younger on average, stages 
of growth models help us to understand that the very youngest ﬁrms are unlikely to 
become scale-ups because they are probably too young to have passed through the 
initial stages. A frequent problem among startups seems to be that they scale too 
early (Lee and Kim, 2023). 
4.4 Scaling up Involves Structural Transformation 
After a period of scaling up, a ﬁrm has a different structure than beforehand 
(Kimberly, 1976; Flamholtz and Randle, 2015), although such structural transfor-
mation is not necessarily required under the deﬁnition of HGFs. Growth by scaling 
up involves rapid increase in revenues but a negligible increase in costs, therefore 
the share of costs in total revenues is lower at the end than before scaling up. The 
capital intensity (assets/sales) of a scale-up is presumably very high initially (given 
the initial ﬁxed costs of setting up the IT infrastructure and platform), although it is 
lower at the end of the period because the denominator (sales) has increased. Given 
their focus on platform strategies and ICT-powered business processes, scale-ups 
are presumably intensive in intangible assets such as software and IT infrastruc-
ture (Haskel and Westlake, 2017; De Ridder, 2023). Firms preparing to scale up 
will invest in the upfront costs of enlarging their corporate infrastructure, such as 
building bigger and better IT systems, and setting up centralized HRM systems 
(Von Krogh and Cusumano, 2001). The labor intensity (employees/sales) decreases 
over the course of the scale-up process because sales increase without requiring the 
addition of employees. 
On the ﬂipside, if a ﬁrm has the same structure (cost structure, capital intensity, 
labor share) after the growth event compared to before, then such a ﬁrm would not 
be a scale-up (although it may well satisfy the deﬁnitional requirements of an HGF). 
Later on in this book, we suggest that an empirical deﬁnition of scale-ups (as 
opposed to regular-growth ﬁrms) could draw on the idea that scale-ups have a 
signiﬁcantly different structure before and after the growth period.

4.5 A Scale-up Does Not Exist Anywhere in a Pure Form

4.5 A Scale-up Does Not Exist Anywhere in a Pure Form 
A ‘pure form’ of scaling up would have the following characteristics. Scaling up 
is a stage in a startup’s life course whereby learning no longer occurs, because the 
ﬁrm exclusively leverages existing knowledge. Scaling up is a type of growth which 
incurs zero marginal costs, as ﬁrms strive to reduce the marginal costs of growth 
while frontloading the cost structure with higher ﬁxed costs (De Ridder, 2023). 
Scale-ups, in pure form, would be entirely composed of scalable resources, and 
would not contain any non-scalable resources (Levinthal and Wu, 2010). Scaling up 
involves zero product reﬁnements, because issues surrounding product development 
were fully addressed in the previous growth stage (c.f. the stages-of-growth model 
in chap. 3.2). Such a ‘pure form’ of a scale up presumably does not exist anywhere. 
Firms can never, for long, increase output without incurring positive marginal 
costs or modifying their product design. Even digital ﬁrms are bundles of resources 
that include (to some extent) resources that are not fully scalable (Giustiziero et al., 
2023; Levinthal and Wu, 2010). The idea of zero marginal costs is an attention-
grabbing notion and an over-simplifying metaphor, but upon a moment’s reﬂection 
it cannot (for long) correspond to real-world growth. 
In the context of internationalizing new ventures, “scaling internationally requires 
carefully synchronizing functional departments and value chain activities across 
geographies at a much larger scale. It involves coordination and mutual adjustment 
across domains of the organization to ensure coordination, foster collaboration, and 
reduce conﬂicts” (Jansen et al., 2023, p. 9). Therefore, scaling requires creating new 
functions, hiring new employees, and focusing attention on new problems. 
Investments in ﬁxed costs that might not have been worthwhile with a small 
customer base might suddenly become worthwhile when the customer base is ten 
times larger, such as strengthening the internet infrastructure for higher trafﬁc, and 
streamlining the user experience in subtle almost-indistinguishable ways. Hence, 
growth of quantity may lead to increases in ‘ﬁxed costs’, and ‘ﬁxed costs’ may not 
be truly ﬁxed at the start of the growth period. 
Scaling is easier for digital ﬁrms compared to traditional manufacturing ﬁrms 
(e.g. because of low distribution costs; Kuratko et al., 2020), but even there it is 
not perfect. Digital ﬁrms have resource bundles that include non-digital resources 
(such as warehouses, inventory, and packing employees in the case of Amazon) and 
therefore cannot be costlessly scaled up. Giustiziero et al. (2023, p. 1396) continue 
along these lines: 
For example, software and AI platforms need experienced engineers to develop, main-
tain, and improve them, marketers and salespersons to sell their outputs, customer service 
professionals to improve service quality, and managers to oversee and direct the enterprise. 
Often, physical resources such as factories, ofﬁces, and warehouses, and even hardware and 
telecommunication infrastructure to host and deliver digital products, are also required. 
Even digital ﬁrms with scalable resources must somehow combine these with 
tangible harder-to-scale resources (Levinthal and Wu, 2010), such as for example 
allocating managerial attention to learning and the coordination of activities.

Eight Propositions About Scale-ups
4.6 Scale-ups Differ by Degree, Not by Kind 
A scale-up is an impossible ideal-type. It is an extreme and never-attained end of 
a continuum.5 Instead of distinguishing between pure scale-ups and non-scale-ups, 
the task therefore is to distinguish between ‘almost-scale-ups’ and ‘not-so-much 
scale-ups’, and this latter distinction has a blurred boundary and necessarily leads 
to some arbitrariness in ﬁxing a threshold between ﬁrms labelled as scale-ups and 
non-scale-ups. 
Let us consider the simplistic case whereby a single variable (such as the marginal 
sales/cost ratio or perhaps a spike in marketing expenditure) can be used to distinguish 
between scale-up HGFs and non-scale-up-HGFs. As such, it would be theoretically 
interesting to see the empirical distribution of this, in the set of HGFs. For the 
conceptual diagrams below (Fig. 4.1), the relevant sample is HGFs only, and we 
compare scale-up HGFs with non-scale-up-HGFs. Figure 4.1 (left) below has no 
clear distinction between scale-ups and non-scale-up-HGFs. It is hard to make the 
case that scale-ups are a different category. In contrast, Fig. 4.1 (right) is a far more  
interesting case (in the sense of having theoretical clarity), showing a clear separation 
between scale-ups and non-scale-up-HGFs. In Fig. 4.1 (right), scale-ups appear to be 
a distinct phenomenon. Ideally, we would ﬁnd a variable that can distinguish between 
scale-up HGFs and non-scale-up-HGFs in a way that shows clear bimodality (two 
peaks).6 If such bimodality is not observed, however, then we would be in the case 
of Fig. 4.1 (left), where the distinction between scale-ups and non-scale-ups seems 
arbitrary. As we will see, Fig. 4.1 (left) ﬁts the data much better than Fig. 4.1 (right).
Figure 4.2 above analyzes our Swedish data (introduced in detail in Chapter 7). 
In line with previous research (e.g. Varga et al., 2023; Palmié et al., 2023), scale-ups 
are deﬁned in Fig. 4.2 as the subset of HGFs that have relatively rapid growth of the 
sales/cost ratio over a three-year period (high sales growth, but negligible growth 
of costs).7 This is an imperfect empirical deﬁnition of scale-ups (as discussed in
5 Moreover, it is not clear what would be at the other end of the continuum. Presumably this is 
because a scale-up is not just based on a continuum along a single dimension, but is the conﬂuence 
of many simultaneous conditions (reminiscent of a multidimentional matrix: a scale-up is a ﬁrm that 
is growing fast while also having low marginal costs and also aggressively marketing a relatively 
standardized new product, and so on). 
6 Statistical tests for establishing the statistical signiﬁcance of bimodality (e.g. Silverman, 1981) 
could prove useful. 
7 In constructing this sales-cost ratio (SC-ratio), we can use the HGF-deﬁnition to identify scale-ups, 
where scale-ups are captured as those ﬁrms with increases in sales divided by costs that are greater 
than 20% annually. In that way, our approach is consistent with the Eurostat-OECD (2007) HGF 
deﬁnition but emphasizes the efﬁciency and sales increase components that are salient in extant 
deﬁnitions of scaling. However, growth in the SC-ratio could be inﬂated by cost reductions rather 
than increased sales. We want to hedge against ﬁrms who do not meet the spirit of scaling even 
if they meet the empirical benchmark brought forward. To account for this, we require scale-ups 
to have non-negative cost growth. This additional constraint practically implies that ﬁrms need to 
increase sales by at least 73% during a three-year period while keeping costs constant to meet this 
threshold. With this relatively strict deﬁnition, we ﬁnd that 13% (5659 ﬁrms) of HGFs are classiﬁed 
as scale-ups at some point during our 21 years of study.

Chapter 6), although it is illustrative and sufﬁcient for our current purposes. The 
main message from Fig. 4.2 is that there is no natural dividing line to distinguish 
between a species of scale-ups compared to other HGFs. When measured in terms 
of growth of the sales/cost ratio, scale-ups are not a radically different breed of ﬁrm 
(i.e. not the case of Fig. 4.1 right), but that they are a category that is created by being 
beyond a somewhat arbitrarily-deﬁned threshold (i.e. the case of Fig. 4.1 left).
4.7 Too Many Exceptions 
Scale-ups are, by nature, exceptional ﬁrms that ﬁnd proﬁtable markets by doing 
things differently. Hence, it is difﬁcult to generalize about scale-ups because they are 
so unique. Practitioners pioneered the study of scale-ups from an angle of case studies 
and anecdotes (e.g. Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). If we try to apply a strict deﬁnition 
of a scale-up to large sample data, we might end up misclassifying a few scale-ups 
when comparing to what popular discourse considers to be “a real scale-up”. 
Some authors claim that scale-ups should be proﬁtable. But Uber is often called 
a scale-up, considered by some to even be a prototypical example of a scale-up (e.g. 
Pfotenhauer et al., 2022), and yet it was not proﬁtable even up until its IPO in 2019. 
Kuratko et al. (2020) even go so far as to say that “most” scale-ups are not proﬁtable. 
Also, there are too many paradoxes. For example, a popular blogpost in the VC 
community suggests that scalers need to do things that don’t scale (Graham, 2013; see  
also Hoffman and Yeh, 2018), referred to as “throwaway work” (Hoffman and Yeh, 
2018) that serves a temporary purpose as the ﬁrm moves down the long road towards 
ultimately ending up with highly-scalable business processes. Thus, the best way of 
production might involve capital-intensive high-ﬁxed-cost intangibles-rich processes 
that take a long time to set up. But in the scale-up phase, you have to do things that 
can’t scale, like a CEO putting their personal mobile phone number as the customer 
complaints helpline (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 216), or Airbnb founders personally 
taking photos of the Airbnb rooms to help these rooms look more attractive on the 
internet (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018), or perhaps the case of Tesla aspiring towards solar 
power charging capabilities while actually using diesel-powered generators hidden 
round the back of charging stations to recharge the batteries of its cars (Niedermeyer, 
2019). 
More generally, Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 198) formulate a list of 9 counterin-
tuitive rules8 of blitz-scaling, whereby scale-ups do the opposite of what we might 
expect from a scale-up. 
Given that the origins of scale-ups are from anecdotal analysis from non-
academics that do not particularly have the mindset of an applied statistician, a troupe 
of scale-ups will include lots of exceptions. These exceptions will be a headache as
8 These nine rules are: Embrace chaos; Hire Ms Right Now, not Ms Right; Tolerate “bad” manage-
ment; Launch a product that embarrasses you; Let ﬁres burn; Do things that don’t scale (throwaway 
work); Ignore your customers; Raise too much money; Evolve your culture.

we try to formulate a generalizable deﬁnition of a scale-up that can be applied at 
scale to a broad range of datasets. 
4.8 There May Never Be a Standardized Empirical 
Deﬁnition of Scale-up 
While there is a fairly standardized deﬁnition of an HGF (Eurostat-OECD, 2007), 
a standardized deﬁnition of scale-up is more problematic. An empirical deﬁnition 
of a scale-up (which relates to ﬁrm growth as well as data on costs, marketing, and 
organizational structure) draws upon variables that may not always be available in 
a researcher’s dataset. We expect that researchers analyzing different datasets will 
not have access to the same variables as we have. Furthermore, unlike HGFs, the 
pure-form of a scale-up may not even exist in the real world (as discussed in Sect. 4.5). 
Let us try to be as speciﬁc as possible. Scale-ups are a particular type of HGFs. 
Hence, there is a standardized deﬁnition of HGFs. Researchers might generally agree 
that scale-ups are a subset of HGFs, but they will probably disagree regarding exactly 
which subset of HGFs. Scale-up studies will probably agree on the ﬁrst stage (the 
subset of HGFs), but ﬁnd it more difﬁcult to have identical operationalizations on 
the second stage (which subset of HGFs). 
Some implications can be discussed. The probable lack of standardization in 
scale-up deﬁnitions makes it important for scholars to be cautious when generalizing 
across scale-up studies (especially for literature reviews and meta-analyses). Scale-
up researchers should make it as clear as possible (e.g. in the abstract) how scale-ups 
are measured. Scale-up researchers should focus more closely on the previous scale-
up papers that have a similar deﬁnition. Furthermore, the sensitivity of empirical 
ﬁndings to different scale-up deﬁnitions should be explored, where data allows.

Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up 
This chapter draws on the literature to develop our theoretical deﬁnition of a scale-
up. A critical discussion of previous literature helps distinguish between aspects that 
are essential or unnecessary for a deﬁnition of a scale-up. We then put forward the 
following ﬁve suggestions for a theoretical deﬁnition of a scale-up: (1) Scale-ups 
are in all sectors, not just IT; (2) Scale-ups have relatively high levels of spending 
on marketing and sales; (3) Scale-ups have low marginal costs of production; (4) 
Scale-ups are young, but not too young; (5) In deﬁning scale-ups, we start from the 
set of HGFs. The chapter ends with our own theoretical deﬁnition of a scale-up. 
5.1 
Firm Growth or Scaling: Reinventing the Wheel? 
There seems to be a fashion among scholars to give new names for already-established 
phenomena. This might be an effort to make their contributions seem more original, 
while at the same time releasing them from the duty to cite previous related work.1 For 
example, “knowledge acquisition” sounds different from ‘learning’ although it would 
be difﬁcult to explain how these two concepts differ. It seems that many scholars use 
the word “scaling” when they could simply refer to “growth”. There is already a huge 
literature on ﬁrm growth. However, a 2014 paper on “scale adjustment” in Strategic 
Management Journal starts with these words: 
While much is understood about the general pattern of industry dynamics, a critical element 
underlying these dynamics, the rate of expansion of individual ﬁrms, has been largely 
overlooked.2 
1 The present authors may also be ‘guilty’ of such activity, although we hope that we will avoid this 
in future.

Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
If, however, we call it “ﬁrm growth” rather than “the rate of expansion of individual 
ﬁrms” it is much harder to claim that the topic has been overlooked. That is why, 
four years earlier, McKelvie and Wiklund (2010, p. 261) wrote that “Firm growth 
constitutes one of the central topics of entrepreneurship research”, and refer to the 
“massive empirical research” that had already focused on ﬁrm growth. 
One the one hand, research on scaling might be an attempt at reinventing the 
wheel, using a new term (scaling) to describe an older familiar concept (HGFs), 
jettisoning the duty to cite previous work, and avoiding previous inconvenient results 
(e.g. difﬁculties in predicting HGFs, lack of persistence in HGFs over time, and the 
surprising ability of random walk models in providing statistical explanations of 
ﬁrm growth patterns). This motivation of ‘reinventing the wheel’ seems particularly 
salient when scale-ups are deﬁned precisely according to the HGF deﬁnition, which 
will annoy both HGF researchers (because of reinventing the wheel) and scale-up 
researchers (because a scale-up is not really the same thing as an HGF). 
On the other hand, scaling is not just reinventing the wheel, if scaling is considered 
a distinct type of growth from just rapid growth. This chapter emphasizes that scaling 
up is indeed distinct from just ‘plain old growth’. 
We seek to provide a clear deﬁnition of scaling up, and encourage future scholars 
to use the word “growth” unless they speciﬁcally have in mind scaling. Scaling and 
growth are not synonyms, and we hope that after this book, the two terms will be 
used less often as synonyms. Furthermore, a scale-up is not a synonym for an HGF, 
neither at an empirical level nor at a theoretical level. Instead, the core concept of 
scaling up refers not to growth in general, but to a unique mode of growth. 
While a precise and standardized deﬁnition of scale-up has not yet been agreed 
upon by the broader community, we discuss the core idea of a scale-up, and its 
essential characteristics, before pragmatically discussing (in the next chapter) how a 
scale-up could be empirically deﬁned with the available data. 
5.2 
Previous Deﬁnitions: A Critical Discussion 
Many deﬁnitions of scale-ups can be found in the previous literature, as the study of 
scale-ups has evolved and gained sophistication. Our goal here is not to “name and 
shame”, but to highlight the different deﬁnitions that have been used, explain their 
strengths and shortcomings, and to encourage some steps towards a standardization 
of a deﬁnition. 
Coutu (2014) deﬁnes scale-ups in line with the Eurostat-OECD (2007) deﬁnition 
of a HGF, i.e., with average annualized sales growth greater than 20% over a three-
year period, and with ten or more employees at the beginning of the observation 
period. This deﬁnition has been adopted by a number of other scholars as well 
(e.g., DeSantola and Gulati, 2017; Duruﬂé et al., 2017; Gulati and DeSantola, 2016; 
Belitski et al., 2023; Denney et al., 2023). Scale-ups are indistinguishable from HGFs 
in this deﬁnition. Some scholars consider that HGFs and scale-ups are synonyms (e.g.

5.2 Previous Deﬁnitions: A Critical Discussion

Zeng et al., 2023).3 However, applying various terms to study a single phenomenon 
leads to confusion, impedes interdisciplinarity, and retards the development and 
accumulation of theoretical and empirical insights. On this point, we agree with 
Coviello (2019, p. 5), who writes with bold in and block capitals: “Scaling is NOT 
just about high growth.” 
Other deﬁnitions of scale-ups are difﬁcult to measure and evaluate. Coviello (2019, 
p. 15) argues that scaling is more a reﬂection of a stage of development where a 
ﬁrm delivers a proven concept to a wider audience and includes standardization/ 
automation for efﬁciency gains, has a diverse management team, has high absorptive 
capacity, moves into international markets and is relatively asset-light. We agree with 
some, but not all, of these suggestions. In our view, a deﬁnition of scale-ups does not 
necessarily require a diverse management team.4 While such diversity (i.e. employee 
diversity, diversity of the top management team (TMT)) may be desirable (Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018), it does not seem to be a critical deciding factor that allows us to 
discriminate between scale-ups and non-scale-ups. 
Also, in contrast to Coviello (2019), we consider that scale-ups do not necessarily 
have to have growth that is international (as opposed to being domestic). There is a 
lot of interest in scaling from IB (International Business) scholars (e.g. Mihailova, 
2023; Mithani, 2023; Monaghan et al., 2020; Reuber et al., 2021; Tippmann et al., 
2023). Scaling lends itself to internationalization well (e.g. Table 1 in Reuber et al., 
2021). Internationalization is indeed compatible with a scaling approach to growth. 
However, it is not a strict requirement: there are some ﬁrms that can scale up without 
internationalizing. Indeed, scale-ups may thrive for a long time in countries with 
large domestic markets such as USA or China.5 Stallkamp et al. (2022) investigated 
a sample of digital ﬁrms that achieved an IPO and observed that “among the digital 
ﬁrms in our sample, almost 30% had no foreign sales when they ﬁled for IPO” 
(p. 103). 
A further divergence with Coviello (2019) is that, in our view, it seems unneces-
sary to refer to absorptive capacity, ﬁrst because absorptive capacity is difﬁcult to 
measure, and second because there may be some scale-ups that can grow fast without 
necessarily having above-average levels of absorptive capacity. These factors (diver-
sity, internationalization, absorptive capacity) may be in place among scaling ﬁrms 
but provide undue characteristics of a deﬁnition.
3 See for example these quotes: “HGFs, often referred to as scale-ups, have been studied from 
a variety of perspectives…” (Zeng et al. 2023 pp. 608–609): “extant HGF studies have almost 
exclusively viewed scaling as either an ‘input’ or an ‘output’” (Zeng et al. 2023, p. 609). 
4 Presumably Coviello (2019) is echoing ideas from Sutton and Rao (2014) on the advantages of 
diverse teams, e.g. “although most people prefer to be around others who are similar to them, new 
mindsets, skills and practices travel faster and farther when team members have varied backgrounds, 
skills, and viewpoints.” Sutton and Rao (2014, p. 284). 
5 China is the land of blitzscaling, according to Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 8). They describe 
how WeChat got its 100 millionth user after 16 months, without pursuing a strategy of noteworthy 
internationalization.

5
Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
Similarly, Shepherd and Patzelt (2022) draw upon Sutton and Rao (2016) to  
conceptualize ‘organizational scaling’ as “spreading excellence within an organi-
zation as it grows” (Shepherd and Patzelt, 2022, p. 1).  This  seems to us to be an  
inspiring although impractical deﬁnition. Spreading excellence is an assumption 
that is not only unhelpful for empirical work (since excellence is rather vague and 
unmeasurable), but also unnecessary for theoretical work. A scale-up presumably has 
excellent routines and practices to have such a rapidly growing user base (otherwise 
it would not grow), but even if it has only a rapidly growing customer base but not 
excellent routines (e.g. clumsily exploiting a valuable government monopoly) then 
it could still be classiﬁed as a scale-up, largely on the basis of its realized growth. 
There are thus distinct challenges in pinpointing what a scale-up is, and how 
scale-ups should be operationalized and measured using available data. It is also 
challenging to argue that the characteristics attributed to scale-ups do not apply to 
HGFs, furthering the deﬁnitional blurred lines between scale-ups and HGFs. 
Some authors suggest that scaling can be either fast or slow (e.g. Büge and 
Ozcan, 2021; Stallkamp et al., 2022). The idea of ‘slow scaling’ could be poten-
tially confusing because in our deﬁnition scale-ups are a subset of high-growth ﬁrms. 
Büge and Ozcan (2021) suggest that Facebook’s Libra would have done better to slow 
down its scaling in the face of high regulatory complexity and risk. In our approach, 
a ﬁrm engaging in ‘slow scaling’ (e.g. reducing its growth rate from 250 to 25% per 
year) would still be a scale-up if its average annual growth rate is above the growth 
threshold. 
Another recent deﬁnition of a scale-up is from Jansen et al. (2023, p. 6):  “We  
deﬁne scale-ups as those HGFs up to 10 years old that have grown to at least 50 
employees or more by the tenth year of existence or at the year of measurement, 
whichever is less.”6 This differs from the deﬁnition that we will later propose. What 
we like about this deﬁnition is that scale-ups are a subset of HGFs. Where we disagree 
with this deﬁnition, however, is that considerations of scaling up as a growth stage 
(as discussed in Chap. 3.2) are not considered, and that the structural changes due 
to scaling are not mentioned (e.g. low marginal costs, ramping up of marketing 
expenditure). 
Some deﬁnitions of scale-ups mention that eligible ﬁrms should be innovative 
(e.g. Vandresse et al., 2023, pp. 40, 46). While our expectation is that scale-ups are 
somehow innovative, their innovative nature may not be visible in standard indicators 
such as R&D investment and patents. Indeed, it is hard to believe that an HGF would 
not be innovative in one way or another. At a minimum, all HGFs (and a fortiori all 
scale-ups) are innovative in the sense of having the new-to-the-ﬁrm ‘organizational 
innovations’ (i.e. structural transformations) which are an inevitable outcome of 
growth. 
Further discussion about deﬁning scale-ups can be found in Bohan et al. (2024) in  
their ‘Journal of Business Venturing’ article entitled “What is scaling?”. They deﬁne 
scaling in terms of sustained exponential growth. This deﬁnition seems unhelpful for 
several reasons. First, exponential growth is actually the baseline understanding of
6 A similar deﬁnition is used by the Kauffman Foundation (2017), cited in Coviello (2019, p. 4).  

5.3 Five Suggestions for How a Scale-up Should Be Deﬁned
35
growth in the academic and policy literature, and is nothing exceptional. For example, 
growing 10% in each year will inevitably mean that the growth amount is increasing 
exponentially, while the growth rate is constant (e.g. Tornqvist et al., 1985). Hence, 
claiming that scaling is exponential growth is somewhat trivial. Second, there is 
nothing in this deﬁnition about the minimum growth threshold to qualify as a scale-
up. Growing 0.5% in each year for a decade should hardly qualify a ﬁrm as a scale-
up. Third, there are growth setbacks, such that growth may be negative in year 2 but 
positive overall for years 1–3, hence problematic for ﬁtting an exponential curve. 
Fourth, there is insufﬁcient consideration of scaling as a growth stage: the ramping 
up of production after ﬁnding product/market ﬁt in the context of a stages-of-growth 
model. 
In sum, the literature is missing a shared understanding of how scale-ups should 
be deﬁned. The need for a shared understanding and standardized deﬁnition of a 
scale-up was recently expressed by Jansen et al. (2023, p. 7):  
Various deﬁnitions and key attributes of scaling have emerged during the last couple of years, 
yet contributions have been developed rather independently. This has led to a scattered 
collection of narrowly deﬁned studies across different domains with limited synergies in 
conceptual development. 
To clarify this deﬁnitional quagmire, we seek a data-friendly deﬁnition that is 
simple, direct and captures the efﬁciency arguments of scaling in the literature while, 
at its core, takes into consideration the logic of economies of scale and the potential 
for having a rapidly expanding business model that has certain characteristics such 
as high ﬁxed costs, low marginal costs, and efﬁciency in production and replication. 
5.3 
Five Suggestions for How a Scale-up Should Be Deﬁned 
Scaling-up is a stage in the life-cycle model of ﬁrms, and there have always been major 
practical problems with attempts to empirically operationalize these stages-of-growth 
models (for reviews, see Coad, 2009; Levie and Lichtenstein, 2010). Furthermore, 
even if the theoretical constructs in the stages-of-growth depiction of the scale-
up construct correspond to real-world phenomena, they might not be measured in 
databases that are available to most scholars. Ideal data would include variables such 
as marketing expenditures, and perhaps also hard-to-obtain data such as marginal 
costs as well as business model reconﬁguration (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010). 
Ideally, we would have large-sample representative data, to accurately gauge the 
proportions of ﬁrms that are scale-ups. 
That said, clearly not all ﬁrms that suddenly ramp up marketing expenditure are 
scale-ups. For example, a ﬁrm producing a stable product that ramps up marketing 
in time for Christmas (an annual event) or a one-off event (such as the Olympics or 
FIFA World Cup), might temporarily display the symptoms of scaling-up (i.e. high 
marketing spend), but would not necessarily correspond to the concept of a scale-up. 
Hence, not all ﬁrms that look like scale-ups are “true” scale-ups. This is not the case

Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
for HGFs though—any ﬁrm satisfying the growth requirements would qualify for 
the HGF label. 
Based on these insights we propose ﬁve suggestions for the deﬁnition of a scale-up: 
Suggestion 1 Scale-ups are in all sectors, not just IT. 
IT intensive sectors are particularly amenable to the scaling up of growing new 
ﬁrms, because of characteristics linked to digitalization. Digital resources such as 
data, software, and AI are essentially scale free, such that ﬁrms’ marginal costs 
remain low for very large production quantities (Adner et al., 2019). As a result, 
studies of scaling have often focused on the IT sector (e.g. Giustiziero et al., 2023), 
or the ﬁntech sector (Jansen et al., 2023, page 10). 
Giustiziero et al. (2023, p. 1392) motivate their theoretical focus on digital ﬁrms: 
“We use the term “digital ﬁrms” (contrasted with “industrial ﬁrms”) to describe ﬁrms that 
participate heavily in the digital economy by either using a signiﬁcant share of digital 
resources (e.g., software, algorithms, data) and/or by selling a signiﬁcant share of digital 
products and services (e.g., platforms, software, media). We posit that digital ﬁrms tend to 
have more scalable resource bundles due to signiﬁcant economies of scale in their productive 
resources and due to markets with low distribution costs and strong network effects” 
That said, scale-ups can also be found in other sectors that do not focus speciﬁcally 
on IT, such as the case of Copenhagen Seafood A/S (Nielsen and Lund, 2018) and 
IKEA in furniture (Jonsson and Foss, 2011).7 This is because digitalization and IT 
have features of a general purpose technology (GPT) that enhances the productivity 
of operations across many sectors. 
It is difﬁcult, and in our view unfruitful, to try to delimit which sectors include 
bundles of scalable versus non-scalable productive resources. Therefore, we infer 
whether it is possible for ﬁrms in a sector to scale based on whether we observe 
growth behavior of ﬁrms that is indicative of scaling (without attempting to observe 
particular aspects of the scalability of their resource bases). It is perhaps unlikely 
that a ﬁrm in the ready-mixed concrete industry can scale as rapidly as a ﬁrm in the 
software industry, but we do not rule this out. 
Suggestion 2 Scale-ups have relatively high levels of spending on marketing and 
sales (Blank, 2013). 
Here we could consider the scale-up stage to commence if there is a sudden 
step-change in marketing costs (in terms of total amount as well as in terms of the 
share of total revenues) that happens a few years after entry and that continues for 
a few years, and that occurs before or at the same time as the ﬁrm achieves rapid 
growth. When looking at the distribution of marketing spend among HGFs, it would 
be reassuring if there was a peak in the time series, indicating a step change or 
discontinuity to distinguish between scale-up HGFs and non-scale-up HGFs, such 
that scale-up HGFs would have a visibly separate cluster of characteristics compared
7 Jonsson and Foss (2011) do not actually use terms such as “scaling” or “scale-up”, but it seems 
relevant to cite them here. 

5.3 Five Suggestions for How a Scale-up Should Be Deﬁned
37
to non-scale-up HGFs. If there were no such bimodality in the HGFs’ distribution 
of marketing spend (i.e. non-scale-up HGFs with low marketing spend, and scale-up 
HGFs clustered around a second mode corresponding to high marketing spend), such 
a lack of bimodality would reinforce intuitions that scale-up HGFs are only different 
from non-scale-up HGFs by degree, and not by kind (see above, Chap. 4.6). 
That said, the gang of scale-ups comprises many exceptions. Some scale-ups 
may grow through viral marketing, which need not be expensive. One example 
would be Hotmail, which grew fast in terms of its user base thanks to its strategy 
of automatically attaching a short advertising message at the bottom of emails sent 
by Hotmail users to others.8 Another example would be LinkedIn, which expanded 
its network at viral speed by introducing an innovative feature that allowed users to 
import their address book contacts into LinkedIn (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). Hence, 
an indicator of scale-ups should not necessarily exclude ﬁrms that are not starting to 
spend more on marketing. 
Suggestion 3 Scale-ups have low marginal costs of production. 
Low marginal cost of production is a key feature of scaling up (De Ridder, 2023), 
and it explains why scaling up is strongly linked to proﬁtable growth (Nielsen and 
Lund, 2018). This idea of low marginal costs of production leads to two major prac-
tical problems. First, as competition policy and industrial organization researchers 
are painfully aware, it is hard9 to proxy for “marginal costs of production” with avail-
able data. Second, it is too simplistic to distinguish between ﬁxed costs and marginal 
costs because of feedbacks between them. For example, a minor improvement in a 
software’s functionality might not be worthwhile when there are ten customers but 
would be worthwhile when there are 10,000 customers. Hence, as the customer base 
grows, the product improves in a way that corresponds to ﬁxed costs, but these ﬁxed 
costs only become worthwhile once the ﬁrm has crossed a certain size threshold. 
Before crossing such a size threshold, scale-up ﬁrms would be recommended to do 
“things that don’t scale” (Graham, 2013; Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). Hence, they are 
“ﬁxed costs” (paid one time only for all customers) but they depend on the size of 
the customer base (if there are enough customers, the ﬁxed cost is worth paying). 
The total “ﬁxed costs” thus are not so ﬁxed because they vary with the size of the 
customer base. 
Suggestion 4 Scale-ups are young, but not too young. 
Scale-ups need to spend time iterating, revising and reconﬁguring their business 
model before they reach the scale-up stage. There is presumably no such thing as 
a “born scale-up” because this neglects the time spent in the two search stages in 
Fig. 3.1, unless of course the ﬁrst two search stages occurred during the ‘gestation’ 
period before the ﬁrm’s ofﬁcial birth. The search stage may have occurred in ‘stealth 
mode’ before the ﬁrm was ofﬁcially registered in a business register, or perhaps while

Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
working for a previous employer. It thus may appear to be a “born scale-up” even if a 
lot of preparatory work was done before the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst ofﬁcial business day. In other 
words, the ﬁrm-speciﬁc preparatory groundwork before scaling-up may be brought 
to the nascent ﬁrm as an initial endowment at the time of birth, drawing on work 
done during the gestation stage, rather than being categorized as post-entry activity. 
Suggestion 5 In deﬁning scale-ups, we start from the set of HGFs. 
Scale-ups are assumed to be HGFs, while not all HGFs are scale-ups (Coviello, 
2019). Scale-ups are thus a subset of HGFs that satisfy the ideas above, and in 
particular, Suggestion 2 (ramping up of marketing investment before the high-growth 
episode) and Suggestion 4 (scale-ups are not newborns but not old either).

Discussion of Well-Known Cases 
5.4.1 
Is Uber a Scale-up? 
Is Uber a scale-up? Uber has been notorious in making losses in the years leading 
up to its IPO in May 2019 (O’Reilly, 2019), with an EBITDA more negative than
-$2billion in each year from 2016–2021.10 It would thus not qualify as a scale-
up, if scaling up is deﬁned in terms of proﬁtable growth. However, it did rapidly 
scale up its operations on the basis of a business plan that had been reﬁned and 
redesigned to be rolled out at scale. So, on that basis, we could consider that, ideally, 
an indicator of scale-up used in empirical analysis would highlight that Uber is a 
scale-up. Other authors have considered that Uber is a scale-up (e.g. Hoffman and 
Yeh, 2018; Pfotenhauer et al., 2022). This implies that a proﬁtable ﬁnal state should 
not be a necessary part of the deﬁnition of scale-up. 
A desirable property of an empirical deﬁnition of scale-up is that ﬁrms that are 
generally considered to be prototypical “scale-ups” would not be classiﬁed by the 
empirical deﬁnition as non-scale-ups. For example, if we restrict the set of scale-ups 
to proﬁtable ﬁrms only, then we would have to exclude Uber which was unproﬁtable 
for a long time (even after its IPO). Kuratko et al. (2020, p. 112) actually state that 
the majority of blitz-scaling companies are NOT proﬁtable. 
5.4.2 
Is Apple a Scale-up? 
Sometimes large mature multiproduct ﬁrms are described as engaging in scaling. 
For example, Apple is presented as a serial blitz-scaler, due to scaling waves enabled

by products such as the iPod, iTunes, the iPhone, and the iPad (Hoffman and Yeh, 
2018, p. 13). Microsoft has been described as a blitz-scaler on account of its cloud 
computing service Azure (Kuratko et al., 2020, p. 111). 
At the time of the iPhone’s success, was Apple a scale-up? Apple was already 
large and had many products at that stage. Theorizing about scale-ups often considers 
that it is a unique growth stage that happens shortly after entry (e.g. Hellmann and 
Thiele, 2022). Some consider that scale-ups are specialized (Giustiziero et al., 2023) 
rather than multiproduct ﬁrms.11 Most would agree that, to the extent that the iPhone 
operated as a standalone product, then the iPhone could be considered as a scale-
up—at the product-level of analysis. At the ﬁrm level, it would also be possible 
that Apple could be classiﬁed as a scale-up, if it satisﬁes (at the ﬁrm-level) the 
empirical requirements presented in the next section, such as 20% annual growth for 
a three-year period. 
5.4.3 
Was Obama’s 2012 Campaign a Scale-up? 
Hoffman and Yeh (2018) consider that Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential candidate 
campaign can be considered to be an instance of blitz-scaling. Obama’s campaign 
grew from zero to 700 employees in a single year, as well as having orders-of-
magnitude more volunteers. The campaign leveraged technology to achieve viral 
growth and powerful distribution through existing networks. Non-proﬁt-oriented 
social movements such as Obama’s campaign can be extremely effective ways of 
amplifying new ideas and messages to have large scale impacts on society (Chliova 
and Ringov, 2017; List, 2022). According to our deﬁnition, however, Obama’s 2012 
campaign would not be counted as a scale-up, because it would not satisfy the 
empirical requirements of being a business ﬁrm that survives for at least three years.
11 Giustiziero et al. (2023, p. 25): “When digital ﬁrms have scalable resource bundles (arising in 
part due to demand-side network effects in platforms), our theory suggests that they may be driven 
toward greater specialization even in the presence of signiﬁcant transaction costs.“.

Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
5.5 
Our Theoretical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up 
We conclude this chapter by stating our theoretical deﬁnition of a scale-up: 
Theoretical Deﬁnition of scale-up scale-ups are a subset of high-growth ﬁrms 
that have a speciﬁc style of growth that requires ramping up production of a 
new product (or service). This product has ﬁnished the processes of reﬁnement, 
the business model need not pivot but has become clear, and no further iteration 
stages are required to ﬁnd a good ﬁt with the market. All that remains is scaling 
up. Crucial elements of this deﬁnition are that scaling-up is a stage in a stylized 
life-course model of ﬁrm evolution. Scaling-up changes the proportions of a 
ﬁrm (in terms of raising ﬁxed costs, reducing marginal costs, having an above-
average capital intensity in terms of tangible capital and intangible capital 
and also with regards to IT and perhaps also robots and automated systems). 
Scaling-up connects favorable supply-side conditions (initial product develop-
ment costs are near their end; low marginal costs of production) to favorable 
demand conditions (marked perhaps by increasing returns due to network exter-
nalities). Scaling-up is often observed alongside a burst of marketing effort to 
accompany what is essentially a pent-up supply-side push towards a hungry 
market.

Chapter 6 
Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up 
This book distinguishes between a theoretical deﬁnition and an empirical deﬁnition. 
The theoretical deﬁnition seeks to clarify the concept of a scale-up in the minds 
of readers, using familiar theoretical concepts (such as marginal cost) that may be 
prohibitively difﬁcult to measure in standard datasets, because the theoretical ideas do 
not map neatly into empirical variables. An empirical deﬁnition is stated in terms of 
empirically relevant variables and concepts such as growth rates, growth indicators, 
and other variables that are found in available datasets. This chapter develops the 
empirical deﬁnition. It starts by stating four desirable properties of an empirical 
deﬁnition, and proceeds in 2 steps: Step 1 involves taking the subset of HGFs; and 
Step 2 involves selecting scale-ups from among non-scale-up HGFs on the basis of 
seven proposed conditions. 
6.1 
Scaling up Is More Than Just Growth, or Not? 
Some authors use the terms HGFs and scale-ups as synonyms (e.g. Zeng et al., 2023). 
Other authors deﬁne scale-ups in empirical analysis using the HGFs deﬁnition (e.g. 
Belitski et al., 2023). Others emphasize that scale-ups are not the same thing as 
HGFs, but end up deﬁning scale-ups in terms of the HGF deﬁnition.1 
We have previously explained why we think that scaling up is not the same thing 
as growth, and why scale-ups are different from HGFs. Scaling up is a speciﬁc type of 
growth. The challenge is to set out an empirical deﬁnition that distinguishes between 
the set of HGFs and the subset of scale-ups in available datasets.
1 OECD (2021, p. 14) states that “scaling up being more than “just” a period of rapid growth”— 
but then later on (OECD, 2021, Box 1.2) deﬁnes HGFs as ﬁrms that have 20% average yearly 
growth over a three-year period, whereas “scalers” are ﬁrms who reach the growth threshold of 
10% (instead of 20%). The 10% threshold, however, is often taken to measure HGFs (e.g. by the 
European Commission. Flachenecker et al., 2020).

Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
6.2 
Four Desirable Properties of an Empirical Deﬁnition 
A ﬁrst desirable statistical property would be that we have a (binary) dummy variable 
that indicates whether a ﬁrm is a scale-up or not, i.e. like a HGF dummy variable. A 
binary variable would be useful for applying statistical techniques, such as logistic 
regression and classiﬁcation trees, for the purposes of investigating and predicting 
scale-ups. 
A second desirable property of an empirical deﬁnition of scale-up is that ﬁrms that 
are generally considered to be stereotypical “scale-ups” would not be classiﬁed by the 
deﬁnition as non-scale-ups. For example, if we impose the restriction that scale-ups 
must be proﬁtable, then we would have to exclude Uber which was unproﬁtable for 
a long time (even after its IPO), which would be unfortunate because Uber is one of 
the ﬁrst companies to come to mind when the word ‘scale-up’ is evoked (Pfotenhauer 
et al., 2022). 
A third desirable property is that the indicator is standardized and comparable 
across time and across countries. Hence, it should ideally be an absolute indicator 
(leading to different percentages of scale-ups across countries) rather than a relative 
indicator (e.g. if the top 5% of ﬁrms in each subsample are called scale-ups, therefore 
each country has the same proportion of scale-ups, equal to 5%). The indicator may 
vary over the business cycle, of course. 
A fourth desirable property is that within the set of HGFs, an appropriate share 
of HGFs are scale-ups. For example, within the set of HGFs, we could calibrate the 
thresholds such that 20–50% could be scale-ups whereas 50–80% are not. If we are 
too restrictive, then there will be too few scale-ups for statistical analysis.2 Already 
the set of HGFs is small, and a tiny subset of a small set of HGFs could end up 
being so small that the application of standard statistical techniques could become 
problematic, increasing volatility and statistical noise. As discussed earlier, scale-
ups differ by degree and not by kind, which means that the distinction between a 
scale-up and non-scale-up ultimately is due to some arbitrary threshold rather than 
some innate natural cleavage. 
6.3 
Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up, in 2 Steps 
6.3.1 
Step 1: Identify the Set of HGFS 
Scaling up corresponds to rapid growth, although rapid growth does not necessarily 
imply scaling up (Coviello, 2019). As such, a ﬁrm that is an HGF is potentially a 
scale-up. Conversely, a ﬁrm cannot be a scale-up if it is not growing fast.
2 A fairly restrictive deﬁnition of rapidly-growing ﬁrm was taken by Guzman and Stern (2020), 
who measure growth in terms of a binary variable, with only 0.07% of their sample being growth = 
1 (and the rest as growth = 0). These authors had a large enough sample size of US ﬁrms to allow 
them to do this, however. 

6.3 Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up, in 2 Steps

That said, which indicator should be taken to measure growth? Consider the case 
of Instagram, which was “acquired by Facebook for $1bn, when it had over 100 m 
users but just 13 employees and no signiﬁcant revenues” (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, 
p. 39). In the case of Instagram, focusing on revenue growth would have missed the 
action. 
Scale-ups such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Dropbox and AirBnB gained attention 
from investors on the basis of the growth of the user base (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018), 
even if they had no signiﬁcant revenues (Moogk, 2012, p. 24). Growth of the user 
base led to employment growth to keep up with the increased workload, while sales 
growth came later (e.g. it takes time for users to get ‘hooked’ and pay for premium 
services), and proﬁts came even later than that. Indeed, the freemium business model, 
which is often associated with scaling up (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018) can mean that 
growth of sales and proﬁts occur relatively late in the process. Therefore, measuring 
scale-ups in terms of proﬁts growth would be inappropriate. 
Measuring scale-ups in terms of growth of the user base (registered users, page 
visits) would be useful in theory, although in practice this would be problematic 
because this kind of data is not usually available in large-sample datasets. It thus 
seems better to deﬁne scale-ups in terms of employees. This aligns with the advice 
in Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 38): “the most obvious, visible, and impactful change 
in a scale-up is the number of people it employs … other measures of scale include 
the number of users (user scale), the number of customers (customer scale), and total 
annual revenues (business scale).” For scale-ups, there is so much work to be done 
that new employees are hired rapidly, leading to the urgent need for capabilities for 
rapid onboarding of new employees outside of the usual HR procedures (Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018), such as hiring anyone with satisfactory education credentials, and 
hiring immediately upon receiving personal recommendations from other employees 
(Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). 
As in the case of HGFs, therefore, a ﬁrm’s identity as a scale-up refers to a speciﬁc 
episode rather than being a life-long trait (Grover Goswami et al., 2019). Scaling up 
in the past is no guarantee that scaling up will continue in the future. 
6.3.2 
Step 2: Scale-ups as a Subset of HGFs 
CONDITION 1: Scale-ups spend more on marketing. 
Scaling up is a stage in the ﬁrm’s life course associated with a step change in 
marketing activity surrounding the launch of a viable product (Reuber et al., 2021). 
At the very least, we can thus remove ﬁrms from the sample of potential scale-ups 
if they have a DECREASE in marketing spend during the rapid growth period. One 
way of operationalizing the focus on marketing spend would be to suggest that scale-
ups spend more on marketing than they did before. There may be a step-change in 
marketing spend.

Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
A possible caveat is that sometimes viral marketing need not be very expen-
sive, such that marketing spend is not a good indicator. Facebook achieved incred-
ible virality by deciding to “deliberately delay launching at a college campus until 
over 50% of the students had requested it so that local critical mass was reached 
almost immediately” (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018, p. 115). Dropbox enjoyed ‘organic 
virality’ because of how users share ﬁles with non-users, as described in Hoffman and 
Yeh (2018). Cisco had a conspicuous lack of marketing expenses (no professional 
sales staff, and no standard marketing campaign, at the time of their IPO) because 
it harnessed the power of organic virality afforded by intimately understanding 
customer pain points and turning customers into partners (Furr and Ahlstrom, 2011, 
p. 135). Another caveat, of course, is that information on marketing expenditure may 
not be available in the data at hand. 
Lee and Kim (2023) investigate the timing of scaling-up in a large sample of 
ﬁrms, deﬁning the start of a scaling episode in terms of the hiring of a ﬁrm’s ﬁrst 
sales personnel (reﬂecting outward-oriented aspects of growth) as well as the hiring 
of a ﬁrm’s ﬁrst manager (reﬂecting the challenges of growth in terms of internal 
organization). This is done using detailed data on job postings. The idea of iden-
tifying scale-ups using the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst job posting for a sales position is a clever 
and meaningful indicator in our view, although we do not pursue it here because 
such information does not appear in standard datasets, and not many researchers 
(including ourselves) will have such rich data at their disposal. 
CONDITION 2: Scale-ups are relatively young. 
This could be operationalized by saying that scale-ups have below-median age in 
the sample of HGFs. 
As discussed in Chap. 3.2 on stages of growth models, scale-ups are relatively 
young, although scaling up is not something that happens immediately at birth. 
Young ﬁrms are more likely to scale up, because they have organizational ﬂexi-
bility, dynamism, and are free from concerns of cannibalizing existing products. A 
caveat, though, is that sometimes relatively mature ﬁrms can successfully navigate 
the torturous path of scaling up, for example when Apple had signiﬁcant ﬁrm-level 
growth derived from scaling up the iPhone (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). 
CONDITION 3: Scale-ups strive to reorganize in order to have large ﬁxed costs 
and low variable costs. 
Scale-ups seek to restructure their costs, substituting towards intangible inputs, 
such that there are high ﬁxed costs but marginal costs that are low, as close to zero 
as possible (De Ridder, 2023). This makes sense in theory, although in practice it is 
notoriously hard to obtain ﬁrm-level data on ﬁxed costs and marginal costs. Also, as 
discussed earlier (e.g. in Sect. 4.4), scale-ups have been encouraged to “do things that 
don’t scale up” (Graham, 2013; Hoffman and Yeh, 2018) to survive challenges in the 
short-term, which means that many scale-ups may temporarily be exceptions to this 
general tendency to tilt the cost function towards having large ﬁxed costs and low 
variable costs. It has even been suggested that, until the winning business model has

6.3 Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up, in 2 Steps
47
been ‘nailed’, ambitious startups should seek to turn ﬁxed costs into variable costs 
to reduce their burn rate, and have the ﬂexibility to pivot and adjust before reaching 
the end of their ﬁnancial ‘runway’ (Furr and Ahlstrom, 2011, p. 164). 
This condition could be operationalized by keeping only those HGFs whose 
spending on IT and/or software (and perhaps other intangibles) has had an above-
median growth over the HGF period (in line with De Ridder, 2023). At a very 
minimum, spending on IT/software (and other intangibles) should be higher at the 
end of the growth period than at the start. 
Low marginal costs need not imply that a ﬁrm is a scale-up, however. Firms can 
be considered as bundles of lumpy indivisible resources (Penrose, 1959; Coad et al., 
2021). In some cases, growth can feed off organizational slack and unused capacity 
such that the marginal costs of increasing production are low. In other cases, ﬁrms 
in a state of full capacity utilization cannot increase production without engaging in 
broad-based investments that would correspond to high marginal costs. Growth is a 
lumpy phenomenon and marginal costs ﬂuctuate considerably over time, depending 
upon a ﬁrm’s degree of capacity utilization (Coad et al., 2021). 
CONDITION 4: Scale-ups have non-negative growth of inventory. 
The reasoning here is that, before scale-up, inventory starts at zero, because the 
prototype has been discovered but not yet produced at scale. Then, scale-ups move 
from a learning stage (product development) to the stage of furious expansion of 
production capacity. This condition could potentially be useful if it highlights the 
change in production activity. In line with this logic, Coad and Srhoj (2020) observe 
that low inventories are associated with higher chances of subsequently becoming 
an HGF. 
However, this condition also has some potential caveats. It could be that the 
inventory is ‘sold out’ during scaling, for example in the case of Tesla Motors, which 
has been identiﬁed as a scale-up (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018) although it has long 
struggled to produce enough cars to satisfy its order books (Niedermeyer, 2019). 
Another potential caveat could be that struggling scale-ups may have (at least in 
accounting terms) a large inventory of imperfect models at the start of the scale-up 
period. Furthermore, the concept of inventory is more relevant for physical products 
than it is for software-as-a-service ﬁrms and digital products that can be instantly 
replicated and duplicated at near-zero cost. Indeed, it would be wrong to put digital 
ﬁrms in a disadvantaged position for the title of scale-up (see also our next condition 
on this point). 
As such, this condition relating to stocks of inventory could be useful to identify 
which ﬁrms might be scale-ups, although ﬁrms that do not satisfy this condition 
should not be excluded from the set of potential scale-ups. 
CONDITION 5: Scale-ups are in the digital/ICT sectors. 
The prototypical scale-up is a digital ﬁrm (Giustiziero et al., 2023) because the 
ICT (Information and Communication Technology) sector has a natural afﬁnity with 
scaling up (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018), given that it is possible for software products

48
6
Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
and digital goods and services to be replicated and distributed at near-zero cost, 
allowing digital ﬁrms to expand globally without having any signiﬁcant physical 
presence. In addition, the value of digital platforms and goods/services often beneﬁts 
from network externalities, that lead to increasing returns to scale for users, thereby 
propelling successful digital ﬁrms onto a trajectory of rapid scaling. Authors are 
quick to concede, perhaps as an after-thought, that ﬁrms from traditional sectors 
(such as retail, hospitality, and transportation) can also be scale-ups (e.g. Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018), such that ﬁrms should not be excluded from the category of scale-up 
simply because they are not primarily in the ICT sector. 
CONDITION 6: Scale-ups are the subset of HGFs with the highest growth of sales/ 
employee and sales/costs. 
A basic premise behind scaling is that ﬁrms leverage economies of scale, with 
low marginal costs of production, to grow revenues faster than costs (Coviello, 2019, 
p. 5). In this vein, Palmié et al. (2023, p. 2) describe scaling as “increase in the size 
of a focal subject that is accompanied by a larger-than-proportional increase in the 
performance resulting from the said subject, with “subject” referring to what is being 
scaled (e.g., number of products sold, number of customers, or number of markets 
served).” The intuition behind these claims seems well-founded. 
Scale-ups grow rapidly according to all dimensions, such as user base, employees, 
sales, and proﬁts. A relatively lenient condition could be that, for scale-ups, growth of 
sales is relatively faster than growth of employees or the growth of costs (compared 
to other HGFs). Hence, even if sales are low at the start of the scaling period, sales 
growth may appear large if it started from a low base. 
It may be that fee-paying customers only arrive in large number after a certain 
lag. This is especially likely given that many scale-ups operate on a freemium model, 
where they accept initial losses by most users in the hope that these will eventually be 
cross-subsidized by a minority of fee-paying customers (Hoffman and Yeh, 2018). 
Hence, a caveat of this condition is that there may be exceptions that some fast-
growing scale-ups have not yet reached the expected explosive growth of revenues. 
A corollary to the changing proportions of sales per employee is that scale-
ups enjoy labor productivity growth (deﬁned as sales/employee or value-added/ 
employee). In the period before scale-up, productivity is low, because sales are low. 
As scaling unfolds, however, sales grows faster than the employee input, leading to 
labor productivity growth. 
Another possible indicator, besides labor productivity, could be market value. 
Market value is a forward-looking measure that potentially considers future business 
prospects based on today’s knowledge and capabilities, although a problem with 
focusing on market value is that this variable is difﬁcult to measure for small private 
ﬁrms. 
CONDITION 7: Scale-ups have high gross margins. 
While not all scalers achieve proﬁtable outcomes, nevertheless proﬁtability is a 
main goal of scaling: “Scalability is about achieving proﬁtable growth” (Nielsen and 
Lund, 2018, p. 65).

6.3 Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up, in 2 Steps
49
Gross margins refer to product revenue minus product cost (Furr and Ahlstrom, 
2011, p. 164). HGFs with gross margins at a very high level, for example above 30% 
or 40%, at the end of the growth period would be scale-ups (in line with Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018). This is because such very high gross margins are a signal that the 
ﬁrm has tilted its cost structure towards having high ﬁxed costs and low marginal 
costs, which is ideal for scaling up (De Ridder, 2023). Firms with such high gross 
margins will likely have achieved a monopoly position by growing a new submarket 
around their innovative product, in a situation that is often associated with IT services 
sectors and digital platforms, where scale-ups seem to be more common (Hoffman 
and Yeh, 2018). 
Hoffman and Yeh (2018, p. 63 and 243) give some numbers for the values of gross 
margins reached by some superstar scalers: 61% for Google; 87% for Facebook; 86% 
for LinkedIn; and 35% for Amazon; as well as 57% for Zara, and 55% for H&M. 
These ﬁrms successfully scaled up to reach these enviable market positions. Similarly, 
Furr and Ahlstrom (2011, p. 165) refer to a target of gross margins of around 50% 
or more. 
Flexibility in the Second Step 
Table 6.1 summarizes the advantages and drawbacks of the 7 conditions taken 
individually.
All potential scale-ups must satisfy the ﬁrst step, but not necessarily satisfy all 
conditions at the second step. While there is a theoretical basis behind the conditions 
at the second step, there are also various caveats with these conditions because scale-
ups are such a heterogeneous troupe. Given the principle of ‘too many exceptions’ 
(as mentioned above in Subsection 4.7) we might want to allow for the case where 
failing one condition might not be fatal. Therefore, we tentatively suggest that ﬁrms 
can still become scale-ups if they satisfy a minimum number of conditions (e.g. 4 or 
5 out of 7 conditions).

Empirical Deﬁnition of a Scale-up
Table 6.1 Advantages and drawbacks of these seven empirical conditions for being classiﬁed as a 
scale-up, taken individually 
Advantages
Drawbacks 
CONDITION 1: Scale-ups 
spend more on marketing  
Scaling up is the stage when a 
ﬁrm has a market-ready 
product 
Marketing need not cost much 
to be effective, e.g. viral 
marketing 
CONDITION 2: Scale-ups are 
relatively young 
Scaling up usually occurs 
when young single-product 
ﬁrms launch into growing 
their ﬁrst product 
It is rare, but not impossible, 
for mature multiproduct ﬁrms 
to scale up 
CONDITION 3: Scale-ups 
strive to reorganize in order to 
have large ﬁxed costs and low 
variable costs 
A deﬁning feature of scale-ups 
is that marginal costs of 
production are low, spurring 
on dramatic increases in scale 
Marginal costs can be hard to 
measure. Also, ‘ﬁxed costs’ 
may grow as ﬁrms become 
larger 
CONDITION 4: Scale-ups 
have non-negative growth of 
inventory 
Scaling up is a stage of rapidly 
increasing production to 
accompany the product launch 
Inventory is not a useful 
concept in some sectors (e.g. 
Software as a Service) 
Demand might outstrip supply 
for some scale-ups, such that 
inventory is not positive 
CONDITION 5: Scale-ups are 
in the digital/ICT sectors 
The prototypical scale-up is a 
digital ﬁrm, because digital 
strategies have near-zero 
marginal costs of production, 
low-cost distribution, and 
network effects 
ICT is a general purpose 
technology (GPT) that can be 
applied in all sectors 
Broad agreement that 
scale-ups can be found in all 
sectors, not just ICT 
CONDITION 6: Scale-ups are 
the subset of HGFs with the 
highest growth of sales/ 
employee and sales/costs 
If marginal costs are low, total 
revenues grow faster than the 
growth of inputs 
Due to the freemium business 
model, and the focus on 
growing the user base while 
delaying value capture, 
scale-ups may remain in a 
position of relatively slow 
sales growth 
CONDITION 7: Scale-ups 
have high gross margins 
The prototypical scale-up is a 
tech ﬁrm in an emerging 
market that strives for a 
monopoly position in order to 
obtain high margins 
Some scale-ups are not 
proﬁtable, even after 
completing their IPO, such as 
Uber
Box 2 summarizes these ideas to present our empirical deﬁnition of a scale-up. 
The next chapter seeks to apply some of these ideas to Swedish data.

Empirical Deﬁnition of Scale-up a dummy variable takes the value of 1 if a 
ﬁrm satisﬁes the requirements of a scale-up. There are two steps in identifying 
scale-ups. In the ﬁrst step, we select the set of High Growth Firms (HGFs), 
where growth is measured in terms of employment. In the second step, we 
select the subset of scale-ups from among the set of HGFs by referring to 
seven conditions: (1) Scale-ups have a non-negative change in marketing; (2) 
the age of scale-ups is below the median for the set of HGFs; (3) Scale-ups have 
a non-negative change in intangible assets; (4) scale-ups have a non-negative 
growth of inventory; (5) scale-ups are in the digital/ICT sector; (6) for scale-
ups, growth of sales is faster than growth of employees; (7) scale-ups have high 
margins (e.g. operating margins above 30%). 
In the second step, ﬁrms do not need to satisfy all seven of these conditions 
to qualify as scale-ups, because this would be unnecessarily restrictive and it 
would select only a tiny number of ﬁrms. Instead, ﬁrms that satisfy 4 or 5 out 
of 7 conditions in the second step can qualify as scale-ups.

In Search of Scale-ups: Empirical 
Analysis 
This chapter takes our empirical deﬁnition of scale-up to the data: Swedish register 
data on over 700,000 ﬁrms for the period 1997–2021. 1.28% of ﬁrms meet the HGF 
criteria. Among these HGFs, it is rare for a ﬁrm to satisfy all 7 scale-up conditions 
(in line with the idea of ‘too many exceptions’). 25.89% of HGFs satisfy 5 or more of 
the 7 conditions for scale-ups, while 60.75% of HGFs satisfy 4 out of 7 conditions. 
Our analysis highlighted how missing values can cause problems when investigating 
which HGFs are scale-ups. 
7.1 
Data Description 
We use a Swedish register database that includes all limited liability ﬁrms active at 
some point for the years from 1997 to 2021 (n = 8,294,726 ﬁrm-year observations).1 
This reduces our dataset to 6,888,528 ﬁrm-year observations, covering 739,094 ﬁrms. 
The database contains audited annual report information, such as yearly revenues, 
as well as costs for machinery, buildings, employees and salaries, and intellectual 
property, among other variables. It also includes information on ﬁrm age, ﬁnancial 
strength, location, industry classiﬁcation, and much more. 
This database has been widely used to study, for example, the effects of employ-
ment protection (Bornhäll et al., 2017), barriers to ﬁrm growth (Bornhäll et al., 2016), 
ﬁrm growth paths (Coad et al., 2018, 2022) and high-growth ﬁrms (Daunfeldt et al., 
2014; Daunfeldt and Halvarsson, 2015).
1 In 1997 the database went from covering a sample of Swedish ﬁrms to covering the full population 
of them. Unfortunately, this reduced the quality of the data for the year 1997. The last year, 2021, is 
used to identify ﬁrm exits making it unsuitable to include in the analysis. The main analysis of the 
Swedish scale-ups is based on three-year periods, meaning that we only include data from 2000 to 
2020 to obtain seven fully covered three-year periods.

HGFs are deﬁned as ﬁrms with an average annualized employment growth greater 
than 20% over three years and with ten or more employees at the beginning of 
the observation period. We divide our data into seven three-year periods: 2000– 
2002, 2003–2005, 2006–2008, 2009–2011, 2012–2014, 2015–2017, and 2018–2020. 
During these seven three-year periods, we identify 9,448 ﬁrms (1.28 %) that meet 
the HGF criteria, of which 12% (1,157 ﬁrms) meet the criteria during more than one 
period.

7.2.1 
Frequency of HGFs 
Table 7.1 shows that HGF events are rare and that only 1.28% of all Swedish ﬁrms ever 
experience a high-growth period. Also, previous work on Swedish data has shown 
that HGFs are ‘one-hit wonders’ (Daunfeldt and Halvarsson, 2015) and unlikely to 
repeat their HGF episode. These ﬁndings are supported by our results, showing that 
only 0.16% (1,157) of the ﬁrms manage to meet the HGF criteria for more than one 
period.2 If HGFs are rare and lack persistence, we can expect this from scale-ups too. 
Scaling is likely to be a short-lived episode that is more akin to a ‘stage of growth’ 
(Blank, 2013) than a durable ﬁrm-speciﬁc trait. 
7.2.2 
How Many HGFs Satisfy the Conditions for Being 
Scale-ups? 
Table 7.2 shows many interesting ﬁndings. Regarding Condition 1 (non-negative 
change in marketing): we had severe problems of missing values for this case. We

could only calculate the growth in “cost of sales” for 598 of the high-growth events. 
543 (90.80%) of those had a non-negative growth in cost of sales during their high-
growth period. This also highlights the difﬁculties in getting data to test this condition 
properly. 
Regarding the age distribution of HGFs, some key percentiles are as follows: 25th 
percentile: 6 years; 50th percentile: 11 years; 75th percentile: 18 years. Therefore, it 
might be appropriate to take age 10 as a cut-off point (following previous work e.g. 
Coad et al., 2016; Vandresse et al., 2023). Firms older than 10 years would probably 
not correspond to a common understanding of what is a scale-up. However, we must 
stress that our methodology allows for exceptions too. Restricting in this way means 
we still have about half of high growth events (5,296 out of 10,732) remaining in the 
category of potential scale-ups. 
Condition 3 focuses on a non-negative change in intangible assets. Intangible 
assets are our best-available proxy for software, which is crucial for scale-ups (De

In Search of Scale-ups: Empirical Analysis
Ridder, 2023). Data for intangible assets show that 7,987 (85.25%) ﬁrms had a 
non-negative growth of intangible assets during the HGF period compared to 1,382 
(12.88%) ﬁrms that had a decline in intangible assets. 
Condition 4 relates to non-negative growth of inventory. 8,292 (88.52%) out of 
9,367 high-growth events were associated with a non-negative growth of inventory. 
1,075 (11.48%) of the high-growth periods had a decline in inventory. 
Condition 5 focuses on the industry classiﬁcation of the HGFs, in particular 
whether they are in the digital/ICT sector. This is operationalized using the NACE 
codes in the classiﬁcation scheme in OECD (2011). 492 (5.67%) out of 8,680 HGFs 
are active in the ICT sector. 8,188 (94.33%) are active in some other sector. This 
shows that scale-ups appear in a variety of industry sectors as opposed to solely in 
Information Technology. In that way, they are similar to HGFs that appear across all 
types of industries (Daunfeldt et al., 2015). 
What is notable about this ﬁnding, however, is that much of the scaling is in 
great part thanks to general purpose technology that these scaling ﬁrms leverage 
to increase their efﬁciencies over time. Further examining the details of industry-
based differences and how scaling is possible may offer greater conceptual insights. 
Studying the limited number of ﬁrms that can scale, despite what seems to be a 
challenging environment to scale, may also open up new avenues for understanding 
what entrepreneurs can accomplish within what may appear to be externally objec-
tive challenges, but where subjective perceptions of opportunity may vary greatly 
(McKelvie et al., 2018). These deeper examinations may also promulgate genius 
ways in which entrepreneurs leverage technology or investments to scale. 
Condition 6 stipulates that growth of sales is faster than growth of employees. In 
our data, 4,193 (44.87%) of HGFs experienced higher growth in sales than in employ-
ment during their high-growth phase. 5,151 (55.13%) experienced the opposite. No 
HGFs had equal growth in sales and employment. 
Condition 7 requires that HGFs have gross margins that are high, above 40% 
(or alternatively above 30%). We consider two indicators of ﬁnancial performance: 
gross margins (which suffers from problems of missing values) and operating margins 
(where there are far fewer missing values). Our preferred indicator (that will be used 
in Table 7.3) is the number of HGFs with an operating margin above 30%.
Table 7.3 shows the number and percentage of the sample of HGFs with non-
missing values for the 7 conditions. There are 502 HGFs with non-missing values 
for all of the 7 conditions. From the set of 502 HGFs, there is only one that satisﬁes 
zero conditions. Clearly, this would not be a scale-up. In contrast, only 2 HGFs 
satisfy all 7 conditions. The most common case is for HGFs to satisfy 4 out of 7 
conditions (34.86% of HGFs). There are 25.89% of HGFs (= 21.71 + 3.78 + 0.40) 
that satisfy 5 or more of the 7 conditions for scale-ups, while 60.75% of HGFs satisfy 
at least 4 out of 7 conditions.

Chapter 8 
Concluding Remarks 
This chapter closes the book with a brief summary of the book’s purpose, and a brief 
statement of the theoretical and empirical deﬁnitions of scale-ups. While we argue 
that our book is timely, we also acknowledge the limitations of our book, chief among 
which is the data limitation of missing values affecting our empirical analysis. 
8.1 
Concluding Remarks 
There is growing interest in scale-ups and high-growth ﬁrms from various stake-
holders: entrepreneurs, academics, policymakers, investors, and the business press. 
However, growing research efforts in this area have led to a potentially confusing 
variety of deﬁnitions of scale-ups. This book to the opportunity for a detailed discus-
sion of the concept of scale-up. It began by discussing the literature on high-growth 
ﬁrms (HGFs), noting that this research area has beneﬁtted from having a standard-
ized deﬁnition of a High-Growth Firm (Eurostat-OECD, 2007). Within the set of 
HGFs, scale-ups are HGFs that are at a speciﬁc stage in their life course, leading us 
to discuss scaling as a stage of growth. We present eight propositions about scale-ups 
in Chapter 4, before presenting a theoretical deﬁnition (Chapter 5) and also trans-
lating this into an empirical deﬁnition (Chapter 6) that allows researchers to identify 
scale-ups using the (potentially restrictive) set of variables available in standard 
datasets. 
Scale-ups are a subset of high-growth ﬁrms that launch into rapid growth after 
having achieved product-market ﬁt. Scaling-up is a stage in a stylized life-course 
model of ﬁrm evolution. Scaling-up changes the proportions of a ﬁrm (e.g. in 
terms of raising ﬁxed costs and reducing marginal costs). Scaling-up connects favor-
able supply-side conditions (such as low marginal costs of production) to favorable 
demand conditions (such as increasing returns due to network externalities). Scaling-
up is often observed alongside a burst of marketing effort to accompany what is

Concluding Remarks
essentially a pent-up supply-side push towards a hungry market. In our empirical 
deﬁnition, scale-ups are identiﬁed using a dummy variable takes the value of 1 if 
a ﬁrm satisﬁes the requirements of a scale-up. There are two steps in identifying 
scale-ups. In the ﬁrst step, we select the set of High Growth Firms (HGFs), where 
growth is measured in terms of employment. In the second step, we select the subset 
of scale-ups from among the set of HGFs by referring to seven conditions that are 
particularly relevant for the style of growth associated with scaling up (referring to 
variables such as marketing expenditure, young age, and high gross margins). 
Our book seems timely. At present, policymakers are interested in gathering repre-
sentative data on the number of scale-ups in regions and countries (e.g. OECD, 2021), 
although there is a confusing range of (sometimes conﬂicting) deﬁnitions in the 
literature. A number of recent special issues in journals have focused on scale-ups, 
although we feel that they have not resolved the confusion surrounding how to deﬁne 
a scale-up. It is worth repeating that scaling up is not just ﬁrm growth: it is more 
nuanced. This book draws on theory and case discussions, with the goal of providing 
general rules for empirical researchers to identify scale-ups in their datasets. We hope 
to have contributed to a step forward in understanding, such that ﬁrm growth and 
scaling up are no longer considered as synonyms. 
Some recommendations emerge from our work. Researchers should not talk about 
scale-ups if they have in mind HGFs. Previous analysis has deﬁned scale-ups in terms 
of HGFs, ignoring the differences between these two. Regarding economic policy, 
it would be a pity if policy interventions targeted towards scale-ups end up being 
gobbled up by HGFs. A practical recommendation for scale-up research recognizes 
that scale-ups have a nuanced deﬁnition and lack the deﬁnitional clarity of HGFs, 
although they can be considered to be a subset of HGFs. Therefore, studies that 
report the number of scale-ups should also (for comparison and for context) report 
the number of HGFs. 
Future work could involve a deeper treatment of marginal costs of production 
as ﬁrms scale. Scale-ups are argued to have low marginal costs to allow for scaling. 
However, marginal costs are highly volatile and vary greatly over time, even for ﬁrms 
that have smoothly-increasing demand conditions (Coad et al., 2021). 
As with all studies, ours is not without limitations. A major impediment was that 
our data analysis was affected by missing values. This was a problem even in our 
relatively rich Swedish data, hence a fortiori the problem of missing values can be 
expected to arise for other researchers working on databases from other countries. 
Hence, data limitations may restrict the ingenuity of researchers in identifying the 
peculiar characteristics of scale-ups. Data limitations may also prevent subsequent 
researchers from applying our deﬁnition to their data in full, although we hope at 
least that our deﬁnition can be applied in near-complete form. Another limitation, as 
ever, is that our reliance upon Swedish panel data might be affected by the unique 
Swedish cultural and regulatory contexts, and furthermore a reliance on ﬁnancial 
statement-based measures rather than other variables that might be more salient 
from a theoretical angle. Further, we have not yet delved deeper into the comparative 
heterogeneity of scale-ups to understand their variety at a more detailed level, such 
as whether the scaling took place by entering foreign markets, by expanding into

other local or domestic markets, or other market-based mechanisms through which 
scale-ups ‘take a proven concept and deliver it to a wider audience’ (Hellmann and 
Kavadias, 2016; Piaskowska et al., 2021). 
Despite the limitations discussed above, we believe that our empirical work is a 
potentially valuable foray into pinpointing the distinctiveness of scale-up ﬁrms. To 
that end, we believe that our empirical deﬁnition and ﬁndings offer preliminary but 
useful avenues for future work that help bring to the fore a unique and operational-
izable deﬁnition that furthers the study of scale-ups in the future. Our analysis relies 
upon access to rich data, beyond what many may be able to access, and where the 
variety of scale-ups precludes there from pinpointing one ‘pure form’. Yet, we also 
recognize that this attempt is insufﬁcient in leading to a standardized scale-up deﬁ-
nition for all to emulate (standardization which was arguably achieved in the case of 
Eurostat-OECD (2007)’s widely-adopted HGF deﬁnition). 
Overall, in this study, we identify some core differences between scale-ups and 
HGFs. By providing an objective deﬁnition of scale-ups that is based on accessible 
ﬁrm-level data, we hope that the scholarly community can continue its pursuit of 
identifying, dissecting and theorizing about the emerging yet fabled category of 
ﬁrms known as scale-ups.
